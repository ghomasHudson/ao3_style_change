He kept a very close eye on Tony while waiting for his answer, to see how he'd react. Tony did, in fact, grow more sober, his smile vanishing. "It was unpleasant, but I dealt with it. I'd rather not talk about it."
Tony needs to talk to Steve so badly, but even though he's been saved from certain death by the miraculous android intervention, he still can't move a muscle.
"Not really. Only thing I can think of is the ancient culture?" Jan suggested, mirroring Jarvis's earlier words. "Tony's certainly visited plenty of Mayan ruins. Maybe even on this recent expedition. I'm sorry, I didn't catch the details of it, so I'm not sure."
Everyone else started filing out of the room—a stylish conference room a dozen floors down from Tony's residence in Stark Tower, with minimalistic grayscale decor and large windows similar to those Steve was used to on the higher floors—but Steve lingered behind with Tony.
Steve bashed his opponent with his shield and turned around. Everywhere around him, his teammates were surrounded, struggling against insurmountable odds. Dum Dum and Morita were down, and Steve couldn't tell how bad it was.
"There's no point in pretending, Stane," Natasha said, the smile she was giving him as dangerous as any Stane had ever pointed at Steve. "We have more than enough ground for arrest, including the accounts of Tony's close friends and some very incriminating statements you've just made yourself."
His second stop for the night was a place called the Groggy Cod. It was fifteen minutes' walk from Lorenzo's, and it couldn't have been more different. As the name implied, it was a pub of sorts. It almost seemed like a speakeasy that had yet to figure out that the prohibition had ended over a decade ago. It was in the basement, and the text announcing its name was only written on the door in small letters, with a tiny fish painted next to it. Even though there was no grille in the door, Steve half expected someone to ask him for a password, but it wasn't locked, and there was no bouncer behind it, either.
"I can't claim to know everything about them. I've only talked to them that one time. Still, I'm convinced they're working against Hydra, not for them. They're not going to sell us out," Steve insisted.
He shifted his hold, his fingertips searching Tony's wrist for a pulse. He found one, to his surprise, slow but steady. Maybe it was just the sunstone. Maybe it meant nothing.
Steve expected Miss Potts to lead him through the clinic to a common garage, but instead, one of the doors opened directly to a private landing platform. A sleek limousine of a design that Steve hadn't seen before waited for them there, true to Tony's style. Settling on the luxurious leather-covered seats inside brought up a strange mix of nostalgia and revulsion.
"Captain is fine, or Cap, if you prefer that," Steve said, still smiling, and leaned a little closer to her, one hand on the counter. "I'm looking for someone, actually. A man who goes by Ed, or maybe Edward, and might be wearing coveralls. Dark hair, blue eyes, with a beard and a moustache."
The receptionist returned and placed a black leather wallet on the counter, the same one Tony had kept in his pocket.
Steve pursed his lips.The source of that information had been Ultron, who seemed like one of the least trustworthy individuals he'd met in the future so far. "I don't really know what to think or to believe anymore," he said.
He shook his head at Steve. "There's an equally good change that I did. And whether I did or not, that fire would've been contained faster if I hadn't made it worse. Even if Jan said she doesn't blame me, I still caused her plenty of grief." He sighed, leaning against the car seat. "Not to mention all those people who got hurt. I can spend the rest of my life rebuilding the houses I destroyed, but that won't heal anyone's burns, let alone bring back the dead."
"Yeah, I'm fine. Aside from an itchy knee," Tony said, and reached down to rub at his right knee. The leg of his trouser was completely burned away, and some of the smears on his bare skin looked suspiciously like blood, but there was no obvious injury there that Steve could see.
Steve placed one hand on Iron Man's metal-covered thigh to keep him in place a little longer. "I guess you're not going to let me reciprocate?" he tried.
Steve had to restrain himself not to rush that way instantly. That would most likely be pointless. Almost an hour had passed since then; the mysterious burning man might be miles away by now, especially if he could move faster than a normal person.
"Well, my shoulder doesn't feel quite right." Rhodey rolled his unarmored shoulder to demonstrate and grimaced. "I don't think it's serious either, just bruised, and there are plenty more of those under the armor."
A voice from the room outside brought him out of his gloomy thoughts; a unique one with a metallic echo that he would recognize anywhere. "Cap? Are you there? Are you okay?"
"Would it bother you if I were?" Tony had come to a stop next to Steve, and was now peering at the stasis box over his shoulder. "Aw, you're cute. Is that why you come here? To admire yourself from an outside perspective?"
Steve sat back, his eyes fixed on Tony's, and took Tony's hands in his. "You're not going to harm them." There was no trace of uncertainty in his voice; clearly, from his point of view, he wasn't trying to reassure Tony, but simply stating a fact. "We've been over this. Every time you've lost control, you've been injured yourself. That's not going to happen here. You're perfectly safe, and so is everyone else."
Steve tried to focus on his breathing and clear his head, but even when he managed that, as soon as he started drifting off into the twilight zone between wakefulness and sleep, he found himself in his bedroom in the Tower again. He was able to cut it short before it turned into a proper flashback, startling awake as if from a nightmare, but after a few repeats, he knew this wasn't going to work.
"You don't have to. I'm not here to take you away," Steve said, careful not to raise his voice in response. He stepped off his bike and spread his arms placatingly. "I just want to talk."
Pepper was frowning at him. "If you're matched, he'll feel it, too," she said. "You should test it so you'd know for sure. Maybe this is something else. There are theories about partial matches and synchronization that's not DNA-based and other things like that."
Tony turned around to rest his cheek on Steve's shoulder. "I love you, Steve," he murmured into Steve's neck. He hadn't said it before, but this felt like the time to do it.
Tony was opening his arms in clear invitation, and without a word, Steve grabbed him in a tight hug. Tony clung to him, fingers digging into Steve's shoulder blades, and Steve held him close, one hand on the small of his back, the other up at his neck, which was unmarred, no longer damaged, like it had been in framespace. His chest felt smooth against Steve's as well, without the circle of hard metal in the middle. As much as Steve knew that this was virtual, he relished every second and every detail of it, the warmth of Tony's body pressing into his, the illusion of his heart beating close to Steve's.
Tony set his glass on the sofa table. "Wow. Pepper really left everything to me. Okay." He put his palms together, pressing his fingers over his mouth.
The dinosaur roared again, and the sound was almost like a physical blow, rattling Bucky's very bones.
"So, have you solved the case yet, Sherlock?" Tony asked as Steve joined him on the landing platform at the appointed hour of departure.
"I guess it's good to know that some things don't change," he muttered to himself, watching the platform fall away behind them.
Tony grabbed the bars of his cell and "Hey! Wait!" after them, also in English, but while James turned to cast a hesitant glance at him, Rumlow put a hand on his shoulder and ushered him out of the room.
At the Kingpin's command, more men had raised their guns, and the next volley of bullets caught Tony in the chest.
"Okay, you do have a point," Tony has to admit. It's not like he hired Pepper to do his housekeeping. It's just that he's busy and it's convenient, and she is so efficient and good at keeping his life from sliding into chaos that he ends up leaning heavily on her for that. "So, can you do those things?" he checks with Steve.
Fury faced him unblinkingly. "Because we didn't know what to make of you, but we knew you could be important."
And most importantly, was there, somewhere, hidden among the three billion base pairs, a particular sequence that was also in Tony's genome, the one could blame for his misery?
"There are advantages to you having that biocomponent," Steve replies, in place of a proper technical explanation. "If you were an android, I could link with your mind and share my experience in full detail, but this is the next best thing."
If Steve had only been Steve Rogers, he would've written Tony a letter telling him he'd indeed like to meet again, and to sort out a suitable time for his visit. He wasn't, though, and he was certainly not going to wait as long as it took for a letter to reach Tony's hideout, and then the same time again for Tony's reply.
"Well, it seems like simple enough mathematics," Jan said, biting her lip. "Two fires, and Tony caught in both of them—I bet he's angered someone he shouldn't have. Would hardly be the first time. I guess that could explain all the secrecy."
Tony's starving, so he steers clear of any deep conversations and focuses on wolfing down a mountain of pancakes and drinking gallons of coffee. Steve sits at the table with him and gives him a summary of what he missed while he was away on his mission. He listens to it with half an ear. He knows that if there's something really important he needs to be aware of, Steve, Pepper or JARVIS will remind him of it later. Possibly all three of them.
Tony made another desperate sound, his knees bending so his feet came to rest against the surface beneath him, scrabbling against the soft fabric.
As lovely as it is to hear Steve say such things, it's too good to be true, and still far too easy to explain away. "You can't be sure that's not just your programming talking, telling you to protect me."
He didn't know what to do. Maybe he should just leave, like Tony had told him to. That would be the easiest and simplest solution. It would also be the most cowardly one. Walk away, forget about Tony, let him spend the rest of his days in hiding. Try to never think about any of this again.
The warning gave Steve just enough time to knock down the man he'd been fighting and turn towards the gates before all hell broke loose.
He's so deep in thought that he almost misses the first gentle tug at the line. The next one is more insistent. Success! As carefully as he can, Tony reels in the line and pulls up his breakfast.
Steve and Tony were kissing, and it looked as if they’d forgotten that they weren’t alone: unrestrained and extremely enthusiastic. They were all over each other, bodies pressed together and hands roaming over clothes. The earlier heated argument had given way to comments like “you drive me crazy.”
"Can't I just blast him dead right here and now?" Ultron asked, the petulant voice emanating from the cannon-armed drone.
"Sentimental reasons, mostly. I got over that," Tony said, as if brushing aside something embarrassing.
She clambered up to the pier and stayed on the ground on all fours, water dripping from her soaked clothes. "I have no idea where you appeared from, but thank you, Captain," she said between chattering teeth.
"Why a police escort?" Steve's mind instantly leaped to thinking it might be because the burn victim needed to be kept safe, but he did realize that wasn't the only possible explanation.
The nurse who shows up seconds later does support a northern location. She's a perfect specimen of Scandinavian beauty: tall, blonde, and blue-eyed. She greets him in slightly accented English. "Good morning, Mr. Stark. How are you feeling?"
The wormhole started to shrink, the unnatural gap into some alien void sealing itself, but just before it vanished entirely, Steve could see a tiny shape emerging through it. A human figure, hurtling towards the ground. Iron Man.
"All right," she acknowledged, and passed the word to the ceratopsian in some saurian dialect or the other—Steve still struggled to tell them apart.
"This is weird, but it wasn't weird to have your highly educated personal assistant do it?" Steve asks him.
Tony didn't seem amused at all. "I've always admired you, you know, Captain. Since I heard about how you volunteered for that experiment, and about your bravery during the war. You're the kind of man I'd like to be, but I'm not. I'm all too aware of that. I've questioned many things I've done over the years. Like I said, a lot of what I've done has been driven by, well, personal reasons, and just seeking a thrill, always looking for something new and exciting. Sometimes I think I'm the most selfish person there is." He paused to take a shaky breath. "On some level, I kind of feel that maybe I deserve what's happened to me. Reap what you sow, and all that."
If only he'd stepped in and offered his help earlier. Things could've been very different. The way they were now, he was afraid he'd been too late; it was obvious that Stark was at death's door.
The only explanation he could think of for what had happened between them was that creature. That slime must’ve messed with Tony’s head, and Steve had taken advantage of it. It was as if he’d forced himself on Tony. God. Oh God. How could he?
It occurs to him that Steve is out here, too, somewhere. He should probably try to find Steve. He doesn't know if Steve knows about the building. Steve could be in trouble.
Tony grinned, his face lighting up. He didn't need to move much to shift closer to Steve again, so close that they were chest to chest. He clasped his hands together behind Steve's waist. "Then I'd say I'd be happy to indulge you."
That was a promise on its own: that there would be other times. Maybe one day, Iron Man would strip more of that armor and let Steve explore his body the way he'd explored Steve's tonight. Maybe one day, he'd let Steve see his face.
Back in the living room, he opens the TV to see it for himself. His weapons, civilian casualties. People used as human shields. He feels sick.
He'd never liked Rumlow much, but he hadn't expected the rogue elements in SHIELD to act this openly. This hadn't been a mission. This had been an execution.
Steve captured Tony's hand between both of his and squeezed it. "There you go. Just keep breathing. Everything will be fine."
Suddenly, like the final piece of a puzzle falling into place, Steve realized what might be going on. He dropped the phone on the nightstand with a clatter and sat down on his bed so heavily, both the springs and the floor creaked in protest.
It was Steve's turn to avoid eye contact; he looked away, at where the sun had disappeared behind the horizon, leaving a soft glow like dying embers. "That wasn't the only thing I wanted to say."
This was too real, too detailed, and too visceral to be a dream—but he knew he'd gone to sleep, and he was sure he hadn't woken up.
Steve considers whether he should disclose that he had that monologue while cuddling Tony's naked body, but quickly decides against it. If Tony doesn't remember that particular detail, it's probably best left forgotten for now. "Yes. I did say those things, and I meant everything I said back then. I still do, here and now. You probably hate me, and you have plenty of reasons to. I wrote it to you once, but I should've said it in person: I'm sorry."
The distance from the cells to the Vault felt longer than many full days of strenuous hiking that Tony had endured. He wouldn't even have made it the few feet from their cell block to the door leading out to the corridor without help. He felt like he was treading water, desperately trying to keep his head above the surface, half-drowned already. His heart was fluttering, too fast and too weak to keep him on his feet. Gray spots were dancing in his blurry field of vision. He made his best effort to stagger forwards, but most of the way, he was a dead weight that Bucky had to drag along.
"Right." Steve wasn't convinced that was a good thing, but getting hung up on Tony's character flaws wasn't going to advance the investigation. "How about the second attack, then? You implied it was more elaborate?"
The next morning, he felt slightly embarrassed he'd even done that. Why waste so much time and lose sleep thinking about someone who'd be happier if the two of them had never even met?
He backed away, then took a few running steps to gather momentum, launching himself at the wooden surface, smashing his shoulder into it with all his considerable strength.
Soft bed or not, he struggles to fall asleep. Tony's condition was precarious when Steve last saw him, and his concern won't let him rest. In the end, he decides to call the hospital, and manages to get an update. With the reassuring knowledge that Tony is stable, his temperature back in normal range, Steve is finally able to drift off.
"I was so worried," Steve said when they finally pulled apart, one hand on Tony's shoulder, the other cupping his face.
Steve takes a few steps towards Tony, but doesn't go for a seat. "So, how are you feeling?" he asks, because that seems like the thing he should be saying, and he's suddenly feeling very awkward.
"Your lady friend ain't here," said one of them, a man dressed in a well tailored suit and a fedora.
When it was finally getting close to the appointed hour, he dressed up in his costume. It made him feel like he was an impostor himself, trying to hide his misdeeds under the flawless guise of Captain America. Cap wouldn't do what he'd done. Not in a million years. And yet, if Steve Rogers hadn't, he wouldn't have known about this meeting, and Tony would've walked into a very likely trap without backup.
Almost every element he was using had already been tested in some other context: the pared-down version of Extremis, with far fewer side-effects than the original, was currently undergoing clinical trials, as was CRISPR/Cas, the gene editing tool that'd do the actual work. From what he'd gathered, at the worst, he might have to deal with a few days of flu-like symptoms—plus the consequences of modifying his INCS, which was the big unknown here. He'd purposefully designed the modifications so that the resulting sequences were unlikely to match anyone, assuming the current science that said INCS followed certain rules was solid. That shouldn't be a problem. People could live their entire lives without meeting their match, so that those sequences would remain dormant. As far as anyone could tell, lacking a soulmate wasn't fatal.
He walked over and looked into the room beyond. It was as white and featureless as everything else here except for the bloodstains on the floor and the walls, some of them older and dried, others standing out bright red. There was a person sitting in the far right corner, knees pulled up, facing away from the door. His unclothed back was covered in bruises and bleeding whip marks, and the white hair and outline of the naked body were clearly Tony's.
The Mayor's assistant escorted Bucky to her office, which was as severe-looking as she was, its walls lined with bookshelves, with no decorations aside from a few antique items displayed on pedestals. The Mayor herself sat behind a large desk covered in neatly stacked papers, but she smiled as her eyes met Bucky's.
"I didn't expect this to be easy. I know you're as tough as they come," Tony said conversationally, as if he wasn’t currently squeezing the life out of Steve's frame. "Oh, well. I'm a patient man. I'm sure we'll get there, eventually."
There was nothing sinister about the warm feeling that took over Tony now, seeing that fond look on Steve's face, and hearing him allude to a future together. Even if they were still in the early days of this relationship, and Tony was well aware that things might change, it gave him hope.
"James, I know you're having a difficult time with everything that's happened, but I think it's time you learned more about where you are. There are some things you need to know," she said, pulling up a chair to sit by Bucky's bed.
Fully naked, he stepped over to where Tony was standing, and went for the zipper at the front of his coveralls. Opening it revealed nothing but bare skin.
Maya wouldn't have it. "I don't want to show my face around—I'm sure you understand. It's this, or I go to ground, and you get no answers."
Tony blows out a breath. He wants to know more about this model of android, so he's not going to turn down the chance to get some answers, no matter how much he also wants to run away and possibly scream.
"If you're sure," the Mayor said, not looking entirely convinced. "Perhaps we'll sleep over this and reconsider the situation tomorrow."
He didn't know what would happen, or how long he had left. In the past, he'd had many conversations about his heart issues with his personal physician, Doc Kyna—a
"If you don't take it, you'll only have even more difficult options left. If you go for a secret trial, there's no guessing what the outcome might be, and they control so much of the system, there's only so much I can do to help," Nelson elaborated, summarizing what he had already said earlier during the meeting . "And if you make everything public, they'll fight you tooth and nail, every step of the way, twist everything you say to turn public opinion against you."
Steve didn't feel hungry at all, but he knew he needed to make sure his energy reserves were full for tomorrow. Since he had an expensive synthetic frame with human-like nutrient handling, the easiest way to do that was to eat. The food turned out to be delicious; calling it a riot of flavors would have been accurate, not hyperbole. Tony did have good taste, or at least his taste aligned with Steve's. Even though Steve saw them as fundamentally incompatible, they still clicked in many things. Otherwise, their affair wouldn't have worked out in the first place.
Holding his ear over Tony's mouth and nose gave him his answer, and it was exactly the one he'd feared: he didn't feel or hear the slightest whisper of air. The blue light in the chest of Tony's armor had gone out. Steve had read his file, and he knew Tony needed that to live.
Whatever was wrong with Stark, it seemed serious. The brief walk through the corridors had left him leaning on Bucky and panting like he'd run a marathon. A small, mistrustful voice at the back of Bucky's mind kept reminding him that this could all be a ploy. Maybe Stark had planned something with the big beast in the Vault, and was feigning illness to make Bucky more sympathetic. Then again, Bucky couldn't imagine how Stark could possibly be faking the ghostly pale shade of his complexion.
"Never mind, I just thought you were worried about that," he said quickly. Tony seemed genuinely confused by the question, and if he had no clue something was going on, then Steve shouldn't have mentioned it.
The moment Tony set eyes on Captain America, his expression shifted from wary to openly hostile. He didn't quite raise his fists, but he did steel his shoulders and put his weight on his heels in a defensive stance. "I'm not going anywhere," he announced in a low, dangerous growl.
After a few final licks, Tony sat down on his haunches, glancing up at Steve. That, right there, was something else that Steve doubted anyone would've believed: Tony Stark looking all smug, utterly debauched, and distinctly submissive. It was a look did things to Steve, lighting up a warmth to challenge Tony's at the pit of his stomach.
Two guards were sitting propped against the wall, carefully bound, and Pepper, Rhodey, and Sam were scrutinizing the still-closed gates to the dungeon tunnel, conversing in sharp whispers. The gates were a pair of sturdy wooden doors, wide and high enough for all but the largest of dinosaurs to pass through, and as Steve focused on them in the lantern light, he saw that there was no visible lock on them.
The relief was so overwhelming, Steve nearly dropped the handset. His knees felt a little weak, too. He leaned on the wall for balance.
That clearly took Tony by surprise; he froze, at first, but when Steve didn't let go, he started to relax into it, putting his arms around Steve, his head against Steve's shoulder.
"I think that's enough, Steve," Natasha's voice suddenly spoke up in Steve's ear, startling him. "Just hold on a few more minutes and we'll be there."
Tony finished off the glass of whatever he'd been drinking before the beer, and then answered, "Oh, not really. Sometimes. Not my usual kind of place."
Of course, Tony would've taken precautions. The question was, would he have done this before or after the last fire? None of Tony's friends had mentioned talking to him after he'd first gone into hiding, after the fire at Maya's apartment, but clearly, Jarvis must've been in touch with him at some point.
"How much do you remember about it all?" Steve asked. As soon as the words were out, he realized that it might make Tony uncomfortable, and maybe he shouldn't have gone straight for that the topic. "You don't need to talk about it if you don't feel like it, of course," he added quickly.
"No. Stark Interplanetary," Tony replied, pronouncing his own company's name with the deepest loathing. "Ultron. He caught us red-handed."
"You're very lucky, James, that we found you first," Lina went on. "Otherwise you would've had a very different welcome. Here, you're among your own kind, and we'll do whatever we can to help you heal."
His second obsession doesn't go anywhere beyond being a constant source of guilt that he concretely carries around in his chest. He wouldn't have any of this without the android. He wishes he had a name or even just a model designation to use, but he doesn't. It didn't have one on its clothes or its skin or any of its parts. There was a serial number, which Tony memorized, but it doesn't give him any hits in any of the searches he runs.
"Me? Caught?" Tony exclaims incredulously. "I just need more eyes in the sky. It's going to be fine. Let's see..."
In a way, the touch cut deeper than a knife. With violence and pain, it had been easy to convince himself it wasn't really Tony he was facing and to distance himself from it. This—this was too close to how things had been between him them, so that even as it made him feel queasy, it also brought up a yearning that made his face burn with shame. He did miss something like this, he missed Tony, the one from the past, and he missed being touched.
The cryo storage chamber did resemble a mausoleum, even if its occupants weren't actually dead. The difference between the quiet, windowless room and the corridor they stepped into was striking: the glass-walled walkways of SHIELD headquarters were bathed in rosy-hued sunset light, and there were plenty of people bustling about. The criminal masterminds of the Solar System didn't care for office hours, so neither did SHIELD.
It was a lovely idea that he could keep seeing Tony, but it was a complete fantasy, and he knew it. Even if this case somehow ended up resolved in a way that cleared Tony of all suspicions—which seemed extremely unlikely—any kind of actual relationship with him would be awkward at best, since the very foundation of it was built on false pretenses. Maybe, if Tony wasn't guilty, and if they only saw one another every now and then, and it stayed casual, there was a tiny chance they could make it work so that it'd be something they both enjoyed—but Steve could imagine far too many scenarios in which it would end in disaster.
He held onto the door handle for a moment longer, considering it. He was fairly confident he could force his way into the stairwell before Ultron's drones reached the landing, but that wouldn't get him very far. If he stayed down here past the curfew, he'd soon be facing police officers and maybe even SHIELD in addition to the drones.
Steve huffed at him, making sure to pout when Tony glanced up. "Okay, I was wrong. Clearly you're confused and don't know your way around my frame," Steve complained.
Tony's hand lingered on Steve's shoulder as he sat back, then traveled to his cheek, his thumb brushing over Steve's lower lip. "Are you suggesting we move on to the frame test-driving, now?"
Steve stops to take in the rugged character of the landscape around him. It's beautiful, in its unspoiled way, a view that has probably stayed unchanged for thousands and thousands of years. His decades in the ice were a blink of the eye compared to this.
Stark let go of Bucky and took a few stumbling steps backwards. "No, please don't. They can't help, and that would be very bad," he said hurriedly, his eyes wide, as if the very idea was something shocking that hadn't even crossed his mind.
"What's that? Already getting impatient?" Tony commented, peering at Steve through his lashes. He ran his fingers up and down Steve's shaft, a more tangible contact, but still not nearly enough, then dipped under it to cup his balls, which were aching for release. "You know I haven't touched anyone like this in ages. Got to make sure I get it right. Wouldn't want to miss any important details." His fingers went to combing through Steve's pubic hair instead of any of the more exciting parts.
"Damn it," Steve swore, slamming his hand on the desk, making Bucky's book jump an inch. He'd been hoping he could talk to Simon today, and perhaps get another perspective on that unlucky expedition. "What about the good news?"
Of course, Ultron didn't miss it, either. "Nervous, are we?" he commented through the elevator's speakers instead of the drones.
Tony's glad he hasn't gotten the coffee he's craving for yet, because he would either have spit it all over himself or choked on it. "What?"
Tony only budges from Steve's side to argue with the SHIELD medical staff about treatment options. They don't come up with much. Their working hypothesis is that as long as they keep the surroundings safe and warm, Steve will surface on his own, eventually. They are reluctant about trying to wake him with medication, particularly since the serum tends to make estimating doses nearly impossible.
An idea was starting to take form in Steve's mind, an extremely risky one, but one that could solve everything if they got it right.
"What makes this time different? If there's anything you can tell me, that'd be very helpful." Steve leaned towards her, looking into her eyes, his coffee forgotten for the moment.
The elevator announced its arrival in the sleazy voice of the local AI, and they stepped into it in a shocked silence.
He sighs, frustrated. Having walls and a ceiling to protect him from the rain is nice, but he was hoping for more than that.
Randall backed away, definitely unnerved. "Really, Mr. Rogers, there's no need for that. I'm only thinking of what's best for you. Don't say I didn't warn you." He paused, as if for dramatic effect. "Your mind has been in penitentiary storage for the past eighty-five years. I'm afraid your original body was not preserved."
He grabbed his jacket from the ground and hurried out the door, leaving Steve staring after him, feeling like someone had punched his top-notch combat frame in the gut hard enough to knock the wind out of it.
The town wall was built of large blocks of stone that must've come from the cliffs by the shore. The seams between them offered plenty of good handholds, and scaling the twenty or so feet of it gave Steve no trouble at all. He was sure Natasha would be just as quick on her side. Her background before she'd ended up on the island was still a mystery to Steve, but based on what he'd seen of her, she was as fast and agile as anyone he knew.
Steve, or rather, Captain America, had indeed met Tony Stark during the war. Tony and his armored alter ego, Iron Man, had been at least as famous as Cap. Unlike Steve, Tony hadn't hidden his true identity, and his past as an adventurer with a popular magazine had made him one of the best known heroes on the front. They had been aware of one another, had met a few times and shaken hands, but they'd never had a proper conversation beyond passing small talk. Steve couldn't deny that based on those brief encounters, he'd found Tony intriguing, even charming.
Tony pursed his lips and shook his head. "I don't even remember how I got here, wherever here is. Honestly, it's pretty disturbing."
"I don't!" Tony exclaimed, holding up his hands, palms out. "Matching might be good for business, but if I could decide, I'd rather just forget that there are those stupid chunks of junk DNA in our genomes."
"I was going to run away and let him deal with it himself," Steve admitted. He wasn't overly fond of the idea that he'd have to go back, and even less so of the resistance thinking that he could play the role of some romantic hero who broke Tony out of his shell.
These memories felt more distant than the viscerally real recollection of lying on the cold concrete, his team dead and dying around him, the pain of the stun prod coursing through his body. That could've happened half a minute ago. The interrogation was somewhere far in the past. He knew that couldn't be right. He supposed his mind must've been scrambled by being stuck into VR for interrogation right after the frame had died.
Bruce's lips curled in a rueful smile. "Now, there's a feeling I'm all too familiar with. Luckily, in her case, it might be reversible."
It's the middle of the night, but Steve is waiting for him, sitting on the top step. Of course he is; androids don't sleep. His LED is yellow again, almost as if it had stayed that way the whole time Tony was away, but that's not possible. Tony's sure Steve would've overheated and shut down if it had.
“Absolutely,” Steve said, and patted him on the shoulder. “Thank you, Bruce. So, how long did you say until he wakes up?”
The NYPD had graciously offered Steve a temporary office within their headquarters at 240 Centre Street that he could use for the duration of this investigation. Bucky's current job was to sit there by a radio receiver, listening in on emergency traffic to keep a close ear on reports of any unusual fires anywhere in the city. This was how they'd caught the warehouse fire on the previous day.
"Besides, let me tell you, at the risk of being an alarmist: once we leave this room and face everything that awaits us out there, things won't feel too perfect anymore," Steve added.
When he returned a minute later, his expression had turned grave. Tailing him was a petite, dark-haired lady in a skybax rider's uniform who looked equally serious.
"I'm here," the dinosaur replied him in a sibilant theropod accent, settling on the ground by the bars of the cell. "I'm Seren, daughter of Tharen, and I'd be lying if I told you I'm alright. You won't be, either. We are prisoners in the North, and nothing here is alright."
"I'm so very interested, you have no idea," Tony confesses. It's not like he hasn't been attracted to that gorgeous android body since he first saw it, as much as he's tried to ignore it and berated himself for it. "But I don't want to take advantage of you."
Steve doubled his efforts, using all the strength of will that he had, but he was already too far gone. There was no air. There was nothing he could do; he couldn't even control his thoughts, let alone his body. There was just pure, primitive terror, because he knew he was dying and there was no way out.
"Oh well, never hurts to try. A hundred, because for a high-level guy, you've got very soulful eyes. If it's SHIELD that's after you, you won't have a lot of time to spend the money anyway," she said ominously.
That could be interpreted in a couple of different ways, but really, Steve was practically asking Tony if he'd looked for a match. He could've laughed. If he'd needed further proof Steve didn't suspect a thing about the two of them, it was right there.
Whenever he'd been actually, physically in the same place with Tony and talking to him, properly focusing on the conversation, he'd often had this hard to pin down sensation of something being a little off, not just in his head but physically, almost like he was coming down with something. He called to mind what he'd read about how people felt when they were around their soulmates. Lightheadedness, shortness of breath, palpitations, disorientation, dissociation, sudden mood swings—he could tick off every single thing he could remember. He hadn't felt all of that at once, of course, but one time or the other, so that there was definitely a pattern there.
It doesn't make any sense. CyberLife has a catalogue that, according to their own description, includes every android they've ever produced, and none of them match the one Tony's looking for. He goes through every single combat and security model there is, and none have the exact specifications that he's so intimately familiar with after taking apart his nameless savior.
They got out of the car. Standing up felt like Steve's frame weighed a ton, and after a few wobbly steps, he had to accept Rhodey's offer of a shoulder to lean on.
Tony blows out a breath, and brings his hand to the android's chest again, his fingers finding the edges of one particular biocomponent. A quick twist and it comes loose, like it's meant to. All CyberLife androids have a modular build, so the parts can be easily removed to be serviced or replaced.
"It's not," Bucky replied quickly as they started walking in the direction Steve had suggested. "I mean, it's a surprise, but I don't mind. Tony seems like an amazing person. I'd like to get to know him better. You came here to rescue him and the dinosaurs, right?"
For all his reputation as an inspiring speaker, Steve isn't sure he's making much sense at all. Tony probably wouldn't be very convinced if he were conscious. But he isn't, which means Steve is as good as alone in this quiet hut, and he keeps talking.
Steve already had a backstory in mind, one that wasn't even too far from the truth. He looked away sheepishly when he answered. "Well, it's only one part luck, and a few parts hard work. I really wanted to see you again. I may have gone to the Groggy Cod, and then visited a few other places tonight, hoping you'd be in one of them."
"It's fine, I'm used to this by now," Steve said. "So, is there any way to delete those backups without physically traveling to Luna?"
He meant it, too. A tiny part of him still held onto the hope that somehow, he and Steve could work things out and end up as something more than teammates. Until he managed to extinguish that, he wasn't going to do anything extreme. Besides, it wasn't like he could whip up something like that overnight on his own. Even though he was an engineering genius, he was no genetic engineer. He wouldn't even know where to start.
Steve shook his head. "I don't know if he'd go for that. He's not particularly sympathetic towards others' suffering."
The breeze is still favorable for flying his kite, so he uses it to check his position and make sure he has the correct compass bearing. He doesn't see Steve. The hut looks closer than yesterday, but his skills at estimating distances and hiking speeds haven't magically improved overnight. He knows he won't be any faster today than he was yesterday, considering how tired he is, not to mention that it's painfully obvious his shoes are poorly suited for covering long distances. He expects that before the day is over, his blisters will have blisters.
"By some definition," Tony mutters. He supposes Kamski will be contacting him later to collect, now that he's answered Tony's question about the android's model. "And if I say I don't want this gift?"
Natasha and the others were on their way. The trap was sprung. He had no reason to hold back anymore. He swung his fist at Stane, catching him square in the face.
The drone holding Steve released one of its pincers and smashed it into the side of Steve's face. It connected with such force that he saw stars for a few seconds, his legs going limp involuntarily. The drone moved in to press one of its metallic knees over Steve's thighs, pinning him in place.
He stepped in, trying his best to look like he was just there looking for a bite to eat. It was dinner time, anyway.
Steve squares his shoulders. "I always do my best to fulfill whatever task I'm given. Currently that is to take care of your safety and well-being, which is exactly what I'll do, to the best of my ability," he announces in his official CyberLife voice. "If it's not what you want, maybe you should give me different orders."
To start with, he drove over to the police precinct where Bucky was currently stationed, and stopped on the way to pick up sandwiches for lunch. It was around midday, after all, and he could use a bite.
Not that Steve was currently being a beacon of morality, himself. He should back off and push Tony away. Whichever way he considered the situation, it was all wrong. If he told himself he was doing this just because he was fascinated by Tony and wanted to learn more about him, he was being unprofessional. If he claimed it was to gain information from Tony because of the case, well, that was a seriously unethical way to conduct the investigation.
He couldn't keep trying to fight with kid gloves on. The move had put his opponent close to him. He reacted quickly, ignoring the pain of the claw digging into his leg, and smashed his elbow into the reptilian's face. They staggered away, growling.
willing to listen when you tell me important stuff that's directly relevant to me, instead of keeping it to yourself because of whatever convoluted excuse you happen to come up with."
Steve had never dared to even dream of finding his soulmate, certain that if he'd been destined to have one, he'd left them behind when he'd fallen into the ice. He'd never thought he'd see what he was now looking at: a red string so fine that it seemed ethereal, but somehow simultaneously more solid than anything else in the room, one end of it tied around his pinky, the other disappearing into thin air.
"Knowing you, he probably would've escaped and taken down a bunch of bad guys while doing so," Tony guesses, then leans back on the couch and sighs. "Look, if you're trying to make me feel better—"
Natasha's eyes had gone straight to the map, and she walked closer to the able to inspect it. She ran a finger along the coastline, stopping on each of the larger Northern towns in turn. "I'm not convinced this is up to date," she commented.
"Yeah, tell me about it," Steve muttered, the memory of Rumlow and his last mission flashing through his mind again.
. That's not in his programming. JARVIS may be a learning, adapting machine consciousness—and Tony does think JARVIS is self-aware at least by some definition of the word—but emotions are not a part of it.
As Steve reassesses the situation, his initial elation quickly fades, the earlier deep concern returning in full force. What looked like a wake has turned into an urgent wilderness rescue, and it's still not a given that Tony will survive.
"And I'm pretty sure Hydra isn't doing this to help him, it's just to sweep the whole mess under the rug. Otherwise, someone might ask inconvenient questions about how Stane was able to pull off his takeover so easily. Honestly, I expect he'll have an accident of some sort one of these days," Clint said casually. Steve wasn't entirely sure whether he was implying Hydra would have Stane killed, or that he might do it himself. He wasn't sure he even wanted to know.
"Yeah. The honest truth is, I don't know how it's going to play out. No one does. It was the best we could come up with in a hurry. We had to get you out of there as soon as we could, because we didn't know how long your frame would last," Steve said. It might've sounded ever so slightly defensive.
"Oh, thank God," Steve says, his voice stifled. "I was so sure you were gone. I've never been this glad to be wrong."
It hadn't even crossed Tony's mind that the man wearing the costume might be a flawed one that held just as many secrets as Tony did.
"I am the engineer here, so that's a yes. Is that going to be a problem for you? In that big dominant frame of yours?" Tony asked back, and got on the bed on his hands and knees, settling above Steve, face right above his.
"I wasn't planning on it. They caught me," Steve explained. "I promised to help them if I could. They were hoping I could convince Tony to join their cause, but they didn't know Tony isn't really Tony. If they understood the actual situation, I'm sure they'd help us. Everyone could benefit from an alliance."
When he finally walked through the inconspicuous door and down the few steps into the Groggy Cod, still in costume, his combined concern for Tony and frustration for his slow progress had reached a level where he was almost hoping for a fight. Unlike last time, he had no need to avoid attention. On the contrary, he let the door slam shut loud enough that most eyes in the room were on him when his boots hit the floor.
"It's not, though, just a regular fire, and the situation is under control," Steve said reassuringly. "You don't remember?" If Tony had no memory of what'd happened, that was worrisome. "Did you hit your head?"
"Nothing at all," Steve confirmed. "He was badly wounded last night, though. I won't lie to you, it looked lethal to me, and I've seen plenty of bullet wounds in my day."
The pair of Northerners stepped in and locked heavy manacles around Tony's wrists, restraining his hands behind his back. Definitely very secure and not something he could easily break free from. An inconvenience, but he could deal with it. For now, he played the part of an obedient prisoner and allowed his captors to lead him away from the tracks and into the jungle, following a path that they must've cleared for themselves on their way in.
None of the death and destruction he'd witnessed or any of the hits he'd taken during the long and terrible day had hurt Steve as much as it did to see Iron Man fly into that wormhole. It was a one-way trip, and they all knew it. He waited until the very last minute, holding on to hope that Tony would somehow make it back anyway, but in the end, he had to accept the grim reality. He told Black Widow to close the portal.
"Any chance he'll make it?" Steve gestured towards the gurney that was being lifted to an ambulance.
After they'd caught and secured Loki, the demigod who'd stolen the Tesseract, Steve and Tony faced one another properly for the first time. Standing at the back of the Quinjet, Tony took off his helmet, his big brown eyes meeting Steve's, and—there was something about him that Steve couldn't put a finger on that set him on edge, sent a shiver down his spine and made his pulse jump uncomfortably. If he'd ever felt like someone was walking over his grave, this was it.
It was the same old dilemma: Stark's word against those of Bucky's new friends. Still, one thing was clear. No matter who was telling the truth, if Stark wasn't faking this illness, then helping him would be the right choice.
Steve stays at the doorstep, his frown deepening. "Sorry. It's a basic function, I can't turn it off. Can I come in?"
"Sometimes, you just step on that gangway on the wrong foot, and that's a mistake that can be fixed," Steve tried.
For the first few times Steve fights by Tony's side, he goes out dressed in dark fatigues and a mask to cover his features and the LED that marks him as an android. It doesn't sit right by Tony, so he makes Steve a uniform: a modernized take on the suit of the hero SR100 is based on, with advanced composite material to protect him from bullets and a cowl-like helmet to hide his face. He recreates Cap's shield for Steve, as well, and Steve is a holy terror with it, since regardless of all the additional fighting skills he was given, the shield is what he learned about first from all the historical materials about the man he was modeled after.
"Technicalities," Tony said dismissively. Steve could still feel his slight unease at the topic, both through the bond and in the way his fingers twitched. "I have an excellent legal team. We'll deal with all of that. Soon." Tony shifted to rest on his side, placed one hand between Steve's shoulder blades and hooked a leg around Steve's, pulling him closer again. "Right now, I'm still under strict orders to rest, and I'd really like to kiss you again."
The second dose didn't feel any different from the first, going in, but maybe ten minutes after it, what had started as a barely noticeable headache, sometime between doses, had grown so painful, it was impossible ignore.
Ultron would know he hadn't been wearing the watch—the loss of the activity and health data flows would've made that obvious—but since the fake tracker signal matching his frame had remained at the police station throughout the day, he could claim he'd just taken the watch off his wrist for whatever reason. He quickly checked the missed calls. Ten from Ultron, which he'd been expecting, and more surprisingly, four from Pepper. He wasn't going to call them back. He'd see them both soon enough.
"Good," Tony said, and gave Steve's lips a quick peck, his expression shifting to something more playful after the brief serious interlude. "So, you think you could go again? Would you like to? We're only halfway through that list of yours. I seem to remember there was something about riding."
Now that he thought of it, it occurred to Steve that unlike every other time he'd been this close to Tony, there was no echo of emotions that weren't his own. The only hint of what might be going through Tony's head was the tired, resigned look on his face.
The problem was that even heroic self-sacrifice wouldn't help him prevent the worst case scenario. If he held on until he died, there'd be a good chance his captors would recover the sunstone from his body and eventually figure out what it did.
He'd managed to come in frames with a similar setup before, and dry climaxes like that could be really intense, if he did get there. It helped that Tony tended to be extremely enthusiastic.
The officials had seemed relieved to hear that Cap already had a plan for how Tony could compensate for the harm he'd done, and that he was willing to oversee the process. If they'd known of Steve's personal involvement with Tony, their opinion would certainly have been different, but as it was, they now had an arrangement that satisfied all parties. To Tony, it felt like it was more than he deserved.
Outside his room, the workshop was quiet, the lights low. He didn't know what time it was, but probably very early in the morning. He found the bathroom right next to his bedroom, only to realize as he was about to fill the bottle from the tap that the water might not be safe to drink down here. Adding the risk of some infection on top of all the things his frame had been through wouldn't be smart.
Tony has no idea where this is going, but even after everything he's been through today, he's more curious than concerned.
A general overview of key political events during his time in storage supported this impression. SHIELD seemed to have grown from an organization that mainly worked behind the scenes into a major player in global politics, and a planetary police that held far more influence than any local ones. When Steve asked if there was any chance that he could meet with someone currently working for them, Ultron said he would have to run that by Tony first. That was a reply Steve got for several other questions that might've helped him figure out the past. Almost as if Tony didn't want him to know.
There were three doors in the room in addition to the front door and the one the waiter had walked through. Some of those would no doubt be restrooms, but probably not all. Maybe there was a back room for clandestine meetings behind one of them.
That was the plan, now: Tony was going to dedicate his time and his money to repairing and rebuilding the property he'd damaged on his fiery rampages. This was the consensus of an off the record meeting with some of the higher-ups from the police and fire departments. Tony wasn't sure how much of his account of the events they had believed. Even in a world where men like Toro and Captain America were widely known, Tony's particular powers and their origin sounded outlandish. Still, they had accepted Cap's insistence that Tony had only ever acted in self-defense.
"Another coat and a hundred coins in cash," Steve said. In reality, that one single coat was probably worth more than all the clothing in the stall put together, but he wasn't going to get greedy. He just needed something fast.
Tony's foot stopped moving, as did his hips. "Oh, do I ever, but I'm not sure that's safe," he said, his tone suddenly serious.
Tony was stuck in an inferno, the blistering hot air burning at his lungs as he struggled to draw breath. He thought someone was screaming, but he wasn't sure, maybe that was just his ears ringing. It was too bright, so bright, he couldn't see, and—
"I don't care about that," Steve assured him. "I used to change frames like shirts. It's the person inside that counts."
"It was in another part of the world entirely," Tony began for the third time. "High up in the Himalayas, where we had heard rumors of a magical gem with unimaginable powers hidden away in a secret, sacred cave. The climb was one of the most memorable that I've done. The views were breathtaking—that's a pun, of course, the air was very thin—and the walls we had to scale really tested our skills. We had to haul poor Virgil up the worst parts like a piece of luggage.
Bucky greeted everyone with an easy smile and pulled up a chair next to Steve. "Cap. Are you sulking, or is that just the frame?"
He hangs the carcass by the feet. The bird is fairly big; he'd guess its weight at close to two pounds. Enough to last him the whole day. He just needs to figure out how to cook it, because he's nowhere near desperate enough to consider eating raw poultry.
"Let's leave that for later," Randall said ominously. Either it had been a long time and he wasn't telling Steve to avoid upsetting him, or he just wanted to keep Steve in the dark. "First, how are you feeling?"
"What about your news? Did you find out anything last night? Meet any mobsters?" Bucky asked curiously.
They find Steve curled up inside a rudimentary shelter he's built. From a distance, Sam can tell with his scanners that Steve's alive. His temperature has dropped to 30 °C, and his pulse is much too slow, as one could expect in this kind of a scenario, but he's definitely alive.
"So, you found me, an opportunity offered itself for you to do some advanced intelligence gathering, and you took it," Tony summarized, scornful.
Holding his breath, half expecting there to be an army of guards waiting for him behind it, Bucky pushed the door open.
The table was set for six; Hammer motioned at Tony's group to take one side. A man and a woman, a blonde and a brunette, joined the group to flank Hammer, taking the seats by his sides. Their frames were so picture-perfect that they looked like plastic fakes, though Steve was pretty sure someone as rich as Hammer would only put his staff in organics.
Steve nodded. "I understand." Secrecy was often part of his work, although this, using a jamming device inside their own headquarters, was unprecedented.
Bruce eyed him skeptically. "I may not be the most perceptive guy there is, but surely it's more than that. She cares for you, just like you do for her."
All through the meal, Steve kept a careful watch on the room around them, but there was no sign of anything unusual. The lines of drones stayed unmoving, and the waiters went back and forth between the kitchens and the table with clockwork precision and impeccable manners. Outside, all traffic seemed to be giving the restaurant a wide berth. Perhaps Hammer or Tony had set up additional drones to patrol the skies.
He made his way back to the trident, followed a path to the water and scrambled up to perch on a less formidable rock shoreside. From there, he could see everyone approaching the area, but wouldn't instantly be seen by anyone.
Eliana bowed her head briefly before confirming his fears. "I'm afraid so. The caravan he was traveling with was ambushed. The Northerners took him."
Tony gave a startled jolt, his hand dropping away from Steve's arm. "I didn't realize you were awake! You heard all of it?"
Not wanting to waste a second, Steve climbed over the parapet and jumped down. It was a high leap, but the grass was soft, and he landed with a graceful roll, again feeling that exhilaration of being out and putting his talents to good use. He got to his feet and crossed the distance to the gates at a run. The night remained quiet, without a single sign that anyone had raised an alarm about their stealthy attack.
When he let go, Tony was giving him the most beautiful, radiant smile. "No one sees me like you do, Steve. I don't know what I've done to deserve you." He gave Steve's cheek a quick peck. "I used to think ending up on this island was the best thing that ever happened to me, but I was wrong. It's you."
"I doubt there are many who haven't," Tony said, like that was the most obvious thing in the world. "Your costume doesn't exactly hide your body, you know. Peak human perfection—makes one wonder whether that applies to every part of you. I guess I already got the answer. It was obvious there was something unusual about you, that night."
"So, tell me, what do you have on your mind? I can see you're troubled," the Mayor asked as they waited for the soup to arrive.
Bucky would have recognized the name even without the familiar-looking picture. He'd seen drawings of this man before, on the cover of a magazine called Marvels; he'd quite enjoyed reading those adventures. "I have, and I know he's intelligent, but I don't think he's evil."
"To be honest, I didn't expect you to just walk in here, alone and unarmed," Ultron went on conversationally. "What's your plan, Cap?"
Steve was glad to hear at least some part of Jarvis had survived. Still, that was a drop in the ocean, compared to everything that had been in that workshop. Thinking of the years of tinkering that must've gone into it as Tony had rebuilt his life from absolute rock bottom—it was deeply disheartening to think that Ultron had undone so much in a matter of minutes. He wished they could go back and at least see if there was something salvageable left, but that would be too dangerous. Ultron would surely be keeping an eye on the place.
Jan's townhouse was close enough to Tony's that one could've covered the distance on foot, but since it was currently undergoing cleanup and repairs after the fire, she'd taken refuge in a suite at the Waldorf Astoria. Not quite as near, but still, only a couple of miles, and the traffic wasn't bad. On his bike, it took Steve just under ten minutes.
Steve already had a connection with someone. He loved Peggy, even though he hadn't found the courage to act on those feelings yet. It never seemed like the right moment. They were always on some mission, or crossing paths between assignments. There was too much going on to think about proper relationships. The last thing he wanted with her was some kind of hurried and meaningless wartime fling. She deserved so much more than that. If he ever got together with her, he wanted it to be serious.
Staring into the distance almost makes him miss the clue that's right under his nose. Uphill and to the left, less than a hundred feet from him, the camo-green parachute container sits abandoned on the hillside.
Tony took Steve's chin between his fingers, tilting his head slightly backwards, looking at his face appraisingly. "Top marks for this part, I have to say," he announced.
Tony turned his back on the windows to face Steve properly, a fond smile on his lips. His eyes seemed to go through a dozen emotions in one blink, flickering between doubt and hope. It was an expression that no impostor would've been able to copy. "You know, they're right to be afraid of you, because when you say it like that, I believe you."
Again, the answer wasn't what he'd first thought. "There were certain suspicions of his involvement in the fire. One of the policemen recognized him as someone who's been mixed up in shady business before. I didn't catch a name. You should go ask them." The fireman finished by nodding towards the police patrol Steve hadn't yet had a chance to talk to.
The thing that finally broke through the trance was everyone else in the room freezing to stare at Bruce, who was holding Loki's scepter.
He touched down, his boots splashing in the layer of filthy water on top of the tarmac. That, at least, hadn't changed.
Unlike Ultron, the cab AI wasn't going to start making assumptions and second-guessing what Steve might be up to. It simply acknowledged his request and started making its way down and north at a steady, safe speed.
"Yes. He's currently incorporeal," Dr. Cho replied, a chillingly casual way to say that although Tony's mind was safe, his body was gone. "You can meet him in VR as soon as the neuropsych team is done with their evaluation, assuming that they deem him fit for it."
"Well, whether it helped or not, it was stupidly risky. Ultron could've caught you in some kind of a loop. You could've ended up stuck there with me. Shit." Tony let out a shaky breath and buried his hands in his hair, hunched into himself. "You shouldn't have. All of that. I don't deserve this. You and all the others, you'll be in so much trouble now. You should've just—"
Tony, for example, for all his adventurous tendencies, had never been in any body but his own. Not that he would've had any particular reason to swap, either; he was an engineer, not an Agent. Besides, unlike Steve, he'd been born gorgeous.
It happened when he was, as usual, up to his waist inside the machinery of the strutter, working on making sure that each compartment was sealed and watertight. It wasn't dramatic; he didn't pass out and collapse to the ground, or get assailed by chest pains. Instead, he started feeling faint and then realized that something was wrong.
Steve had known Tony for less than a day, but the man had gotten under his skin in a way he couldn't have expected. Tony was loud and annoying and confrontational, but he was also bright and funny and charismatic, and he seemed to fill a room the second he walked into it, instantly catching everyone's full attention. The thought that he was gone hit Steve hard. It felt as if something were missing, something he'd not even realized was there, like a background noise just at the threshold of his hearing that had been silenced. The world felt terribly empty and lonely without it.
Steve took Tony's fingers deeper, working them the same as he would have with Tony's cock, and with his other hand, finally captured one of Tony's nipples, pinching it lightly.
“I wasn’t going to let you get injured!” Tony exclaimed. “You’re too important to the team. And to me.” He hadn’t meant to actually say the last part aloud, but there it was. Too late to take it back.
"Oh, he tried to. But I already had the repulsor pump then, and the cover plate made the blade slip. Gave me a nasty gash on the arm. I can show you the scar sometime," Tony replied, shrugging his left shoulder. "Like I said, by that time, the noise had brought the others out of their tents, and we managed to subdue Cauac. Turned out he was part of a cult that claimed to be the offspring of the original temple builders. Some villagers we met later told us that it was nonsense, and that no one really knew the deities the temple was dedicated to anymore."
His words are cut short by Steve's fist connecting with his face. Obie disappears from Tony's field of vision and hits the floor with a heavy thud. Steve follows, going out of sight as well.
Steve pushed back the blankets covering Tony, trying to understand what was going on. There was a short stretch of IV tubing taped to Tony's arm. He had no idea what it was for, but it couldn't be anything good. A chill ran down Steve's spine.
After leaving Tony alone in the pocket dimension Strange had created, Steve had thought things couldn't possibly get any worse—and then they'd lost the voice connection to him, too. While they'd had it, Steve had at least been able to talk to him, to tell him to hold on and that the Avengers were looking for a way to bring him back, and to be sure that he was still alive. Now, he didn't even know that.
The dinosaurs, including the one carrying Tony and Bucky, who probably hadn't spotted Steve in the faint dawn light, continued their charge without slowing down, following the track leading towards the shore.
Tony settled on his back on the chaise longue, his hands behind his head, his hooded eyes on Steve. As relaxed as the pose was, Steve could feel the tension in the muscles beneath his fingers.
There were shouts of "Run!" and "Let's get the hell out of here!" from amidst the thugs, and they hurried to their cars. The Kingpin didn't try to stop them, instead following the group. The slower men had doors slammed in their faces, and then all three cars sped away, tires screeching.
Jarvis raised his bushy eyebrows, but Steve couldn't say whether he was surprised at the question because it was so unexpected, or because it did mean something to him. "Of course it does. They were one of the most advanced Mesoamerican cultures. What does that have to do with anything?"
"Good thing you did, otherwise I never would've found you." Steve doesn't admit aloud how surprised he is to hear Tony's words, and how hopeful they make him. There's a warmth in his chest that's more comforting than the thickest blanket in his hotel bed. "And I'm truly glad that I did. It means we get another chance, one that I don't want to waste. I hope you feel the same way about it."
"I don't see how he could've," Steve replied. As much as he wanted to believe otherwise, it seemed very unlikely.
"He was," Jan admitted. "He tends to be, if he's in town, and whenever he organizes something, I'm there in turn. Always good fun. If I may ask, why're you so interested in what Tony's up to?"
It only took a few more minutes after that for them to make their way to the dungeon and fetch Stark from his cell.
"Anyway, he was still alive when the drones took him, right?" Steve checked. That was what Rhodey had implied earlier. If he didn't know whether Tony was alive, at least there was a chance that he wasn't dead.
"No, no, definitely not. They were all men. At least two, maybe three, and they were arguing. I couldn't make out the words," the lady said apologetically.
"That's just a reaction," Pepper said soothingly. "You'll feel more rational about it once you get used to the idea."
“JARVIS isn’t infallible or all-knowing,” Steve said. It had been reassuring to hear the AI declare that Tony’s injuries weren’t severe, because JARVIS wouldn’t hesitate to say so if he suspected that, but Steve still wanted to see for himself. Just to put his mind to rest.
Tony's deflections might've been more convincing if Steve hadn't noticed that these access limitations were inconsistent. On the first day after he'd woken up, during the first conversation he'd had with Tony, Ultron had said that Bucky was missing, but presumed alive. Steve couldn't even get that much when he asked about it himself. Ultron downright denied having access to such files, and Tony shrugged and suggested that maybe the clearance level had changed.
"Aren't you skipping ahead a little? What about the conversation that we never finished?" Steve said. He wanted nothing more than to bridge the nearly non-existent gap between their lips, but he also thought they should be absolutely clear on what they were doing, and that they were on the same page.
He'd never thought he might some day consider "mind control" the lesser evil out of any set of options, but in this case, it really would've been. The problem was, he knew he was grasping at straws. He'd felt what he'd felt. It had been real. He was still all too aware of Steve standing next to him, and he couldn't shake that off.
"That's one of the questions I wanted to ask you," Steve said. "So far, there have been three fires. He's the only person I know of who's definitely been present at two of them, and I have reason to suspect he's connected to the latest one as well. That's not solid evidence of anything, but it seems unlikely to be a coincidence."
He was considering turning around and heading back to the others when a noise from deeper within the ruins caught his ear: a low groan that could've been just from the strain on the fallen sheets and beams of metal. Moving cautiously, trying not to step on anything unsteady or scalding hot, he made his way closer.
"It's a sublingual film," Rhodey said. "If the first one's not enough, take another. Your frame's pretty big and I bet it has a high metabolism."
"There's someone we need to capture, a malicious and very intelligent man who could be invaluable to our cause if we can get him to cooperate. Perhaps you've heard of him in the outside world. His name is Tony Stark," the Mayor said, handing Bucky a sketch of a man with a beard and a mustache.
This time, their breakneck flight brought them to the landing platform closest to Steve's floor without any paparazzi in sight.
He kept checking the time. The minutes were inching forwards so very slowly. Even looking at the watch reminded him of Tony: it had been damaged by the explosion and the sea water when Steve had ended up on the island, and Tony had fixed it for him.
"Better, I think," Bucky replied. Even though he still sounded weak, at least he could talk properly, without the raspy undertone or the constant coughing fits.
"All the more reason to explore it further. If that's something you might be interested in," Steve suggests, and whoever designed his eyes to enable this particular flirty look through those long lashes deserves a prize.
"It's not like you're asking me to marry you," Steve said. "I'd like to have a real relationship. See how that goes. Besides, we already know the sex would be great."
"Well, let me know when you have. And just so we're clear, I'll be happy with what you pick, too," Tony said, giving Steve's thigh a pat.
"Now, I know that all of you would like to march in through the town gates and interrogate every local you see about Tony's whereabouts," Natasha went on after everyone had expressed their joy about the good news, "but I think a more subtle approach would make more sense. I could go alone and ask around before we give ourselves away."
Its torso is just as lifelike as its face, all perfectly sculpted muscle that'd put most humans to shame. It doesn't seem to be breathing—the obscenely well-formed pecs are still as death. Tony isn't sure if a military model would breathe even while intact, but if he had to guess, he'd say yes. Most of the detail on this android is pointless; there's absolutely no reason for it to look so pretty, and yet, there it is.
"Likewise. So very glad." Bucky didn't really have the words to describe how happy he was to see Steve again, but hopefully, Steve knew anyway. "You made it without any injuries?"
"My point exactly," Rhodey said, smirking at him. "At least I'm humble enough to admit that I've no clue. Genome-wide scan? Candidate loci?"
"It might take weeks before I can put together something that works! I swear I'll behave. I just want to see the sun again." Stark was almost pleading now.
Boiling with fury, he turns to head downstairs, and almost bumps into Steve, who's standing next to him, stock still, eyes fixed on the screen.
He'd survived, against all odds. He had a vague memory of seeing Steve, even though that made no sense. Steve had to be hundreds of miles away. He must've been dreaming.
The sound had already stopped when Steve picked up his phone. The screen showed it hadn't been a call but a text message. He opened it right away.
Steve knew more than Tony believed, but it definitely wasn't enough. He would've liked to know more. "You can tell me, whatever it is. I'm not going to think the worse of you."
"I know it's unfair of me to say this, but I'm going to miss you," Tony noted, lingering by the bathroom door wearing nothing more than a towel around his waist.
He stepped away from the wall, revealing himself to her, and she waved a hand in greeting, walking until she was close enough to whisper into his ear. "I met one guard. You?"
"You don't believe that, do you? He wouldn't have," Steve said. Tony had never liked his father, but he'd been close with his mother, and regardless of Steve's opinions on his moral integrity, surely Tony wouldn't have been capable of wiping his parents in cold blood.
Steve felt slightly envious of Bruce whenever he saw him and Tony together; they were usually chatting away about some advanced science or engineering topic that Steve couldn't hope to comprehend, and they seemed perfectly at ease with one another. He would've liked to have that, too.
This time, he distinctly remembers he was talking to Steve, but it was such a wish-fulfilling, warm and fuzzy conversation that it's difficult to believe it actually happened. It seems more like a daydream—it definitely wouldn't be the first one of its kind.
When consciousness threatened to return, he tried to resist it. He really didn't want to wake up. He knew it would suck. He squeezed his eyes closed and pressed his face into the sofa cushions, but it was already too late.
Steve unclenched his hands, leaving the fabric at Tony's shoulders bunched up, and cupped Tony's face with one hand, running his thumb over his beard. He couldn't spot a single stain in it. Tony had caught every last droplet in his mouth.
He lets his hand fall, repositioning his arms around Tony. The rise and fall of his ribs is much more noticeable now, and Steve feels like he can breathe easier, himself, the knot of dread in his chest loosening a little.
Waiting for the specialists to reach them, he tried to fervently think of something he could do to help. He knew that what was going on in VR and in Tony's brain wouldn't directly translate to physical harm; the reason his frame was failing was that it had been old and exhausted to start with, and all the stress piled up on it, possibly compounded by injuries from the earlier battle, was too much for him to handle.
Steve knew that already, and he'd like nothing more than to get rid of the tracker. He had no idea if Pepper and Rhodey knew about the second one the resistance had put on him. Hopefully not. It would be his insurance. He didn't know what these two wanted from him, after all, even though the fact that they clearly weren't on Tony's side was promising.
"Just like that, yeah, put those big fake fingers to good use," Tony encouraged him, squirming against Steve.
"Doesn't it weird you out, looking at yourself like that?" Tony's voice called out from the doorway across the chamber, startling Steve out of his thoughts.
If he'd have to guess, he'd say Tony must've suspected this for a long time, maybe from the day they'd first met. It'd explain why he'd always been so awkward around Steve, always on the defensive, hiding behind either actual distance or biting wit, never letting him close. He'd realized they were soulmates, and he hadn't wanted that. Maybe he'd even hoped Steve wouldn't realize it.
Steve scans the surroundings once more. As he thought, aside from the outhouse behind the hut, there are no other buildings nearby. It's only when he walks up to the lakeshore that he spots a lone tent around a quarter of a mile away. It's set up next to a thicket of bushes, its camo green color blending into the landscape.
Never in his life, not even before the Accords, did Steve expect to end up this close to Tony. Of course, given the circumstances, there's no mistaking this for anything other than an emergency measure—Tony is so cold, he might as well be clinging to a corpse. Even with his arms around Tony's ribcage, his breaths are too faint to notice.
Steve replied to him, tugging at the yarn in rapid sequence—so fast, in fact, that Tony asked him to slow down. Steve did, but he didn't stop.
"It was temporary, and it felt great," Steve said once more. "I wish you could feel it too. You sure you'd never consider a swap?"
With Steve's support, the man climbed out of the space he'd been in—a nook between fallen beams leaning against one another, just large enough to fit him. As soon as he was on level ground, he straightened up, taking in the sad state of his clothing. There was barely enough fabric left to keep him decent; the remains of his trousers were hanging from his belt like a loincloth, and what must've been a jacket and a shirt now resembled a vest, revealing glimpses of wiry muscles underneath.
The meeting with the local elders turned out to be a waste of time. They had no information to give on the Northerners' strongholds, and the very suggestion of sending out a rescue party was met with suspicion and reluctance.
"Huh?" Steve thought it'd been quite obvious. "Well, I came?" he said anyway. It sounded dumb, not to mention a poorly inadequate description for what he'd felt.
Coulson accompanied Steve to the landing platform and the awaiting limo. It sat there like some gold-plated, silk-lined cage. Steve had been so close to being free, and here he was, choosing to return to servitude. If not for the possibility of helping many more people than just himself and his team, he would never have done it. He still wasn't convinced that this was the right choice and that there was anything to be gained from spending more time with Tony, but he'd promised to try. At least he now had an out if he wanted it: he could contact the resistance through Coulson, and they'd be able to help him.
He fell into the cold wind, his clothes flapping wildly about him, drizzly rain lashing against his unprotected face. A fast-moving car swerved past him, so close that he could feel the warmth of its exhaust.
The android's skin doesn't feel human under his fingertips, but it doesn't feel like a machine, either. It's cool and has a slight give to it, like silicone. It takes conscious effort to ignore the parallels his mind wants to draw to how much it resembles a high-quality sex toy. God. He knows Kamski also does androids for those purposes. He can't say the idea isn't a turn-on, but again, it also bothers him, which is why he's never tried one of those—and why he's doing his best not to think of how hot this high-tech artificial Adonis in front of him happens to be.
Steve's mind, full of thoughts that had nothing to do with work, instantly leaped back to wondering whether she knew about him and Tony, and if she found it distasteful. He was glad that this frame wouldn't blush. "Fine, so far," he replied quickly. "It's very impressive."
"I think he's going to be okay," said the older and shorter of the two black men Bucky had spotted among Steve's friends. He'd crouched next to Tony and Steve on the ground and taken a good look at the mysterious gem embedded in Tony's chest. "Jarvis knows more than I do, so I suggest we continue to the camp."
"Steve, oh fuck, that's—" Tony's hand tensed in Steve's hold, and then went slack, slipping out of Steve's mouth.
He couldn't even hold a book and turn the pages at the same time, because he would've needed two hands for that.
A shiver ran through the ground, then another, and after the third, Bucky realized it wasn't a small earthquake, but the footsteps of a massive beast lumbering through the forest. The sounds of breaking branches followed, and then, a roar louder than any animal sound he'd ever heard before.
The receptionist watched him cross the room with a thoroughly disinterested look, but Steve still imagined there was some disdain in it. He couldn't have seen Steve when he'd stopped by at Tony's door with breakfast, but he'd probably seen Steve follow Tony upstairs yesterday. Steve wondered if some of the other occupants might've also heard them last night. They hadn't been particularly loud, but not exactly noiseless, either, and he didn't expect the building to have the best soundproofing.
"That wasn't you," Steve said, as much to himself as to Tony. He had to cling to that. If he didn't, the betrayal would make everything hurt even worse.
Her reaction to seeing Tony shirtless, with the thirium reactor in full view, is even more shocked than Tony expected, which is saying a lot, since Tony knew she'd freak out.
"Of course," Steve said, his stomach dropping at the mention of a casualty. Had Tony's pursuers finally gotten to him? Was Steve going to end up investigating a homicide instead of arson?
"Just him. We didn't know about the dinosaurs," Steve said. "It's good that you helped all of them escape."
Pepper had broken Steve out from a very similar predicament just a few days ago, but Steve doubted it would work a second time. Stane would have tightened his security measures. Besides, there was no way they could pull Tony out of VR the way Pepper had done with Steve. The strain of that would kill him as surely as putting a gun to his head.
Tony's expression brightened up at that. "It was excellent. All the way up to the point where I worried I'd have to haul you back to HQ and try to explain why you'd suffered some kind of mysterious mind/frame disconnect." He fell silent for a moment, then chuckled, this time sounding genuinely amused. "I can't believe I thought I might've broken your top-of-the-line combat frame with my ass. That's incredible. I'll treasure the memory."
"And yet, you always do your best to hide it," Steve insisted, squeezing Tony's fingers. "He's an awesome person, that Tony Stark from Marvels, the one whose life is a continuous adventure, whose heart is whole and who's never been afraid or uncertain of anything. I just like you better."
There was a whirring, whining noise, and a movement in one corner of the room. The source of it was half hidden behind ceiling-height shelving, but Steve could see light glinting from something silvery. He stopped in his tracks.
"Look, I appreciate what you're trying to do, but if my heart stops, I can't will it into starting again, no matter how much I want to," Tony said. It was melodramatic and unfairly irritable, but he had no patience left for platitudes.
It's an easy choice to make. He might waste a few hours, but he'll be able to travel faster when he's not half starved.
"I found my—" Steve stumbles, looking for the right word, since Tony is not his teammate anymore, and they're not on particularly good terms—but he settles on "friend," anyway. "He was lost on the fell, and he's badly hypothermic. I have to get him to a hospital."
Exactly one hour later, as requested, Steve took the private elevator back to Tony's floor, ready to start his first day of servitude. To Steve's surprise, Tony was there as well, looking sharp in a business suit. Back in the day, Tony had rarely showed up at HQ before ten, and usually he'd spent his first hour inhaling caffeine. It wasn't even nine o'clock yet. Things had definitely changed.
Tony's hand stilled under Steve's, but stayed tense. "You know. Waking up in another body," he clarified.
"Confused, and weirdly turned on," Tony blurts out, rubbing at his chest. "I've got so many questions, starting with 'what the hell was that?'"
"Damn him," Jarvis swore once Steve was through the day's second retelling of the recent events. "He should've told me—we looked into this, and we were convinced he must've been in contact with the Fountain, the way he'd healed, but we never saw a trace of these side-effects."
The hour was fairly early for hanging out at a shady bar, and there were only around ten people in the room, in addition to the lone bartender. The crowd was varied enough that Steve didn't particularly stand out. Preferring to keep it that way, he first approached the bar. As he did, his eyes landed on the man sitting on one of the bar stools. The unexpected, very familiar-looking man.
Steve didn't carry weapons, of course. He could defend himself just fine without. Tony's hands came to rest at Steve's hips, and he gave Steve a demure look through his long lashes. "So, tough guy. Tell me more about your plans for me."
"I'm not going anywhere until I've got the full picture," Steve said, keeping his tone neutral. "Help me understand."
"Oh. I never did tell you his full name, did I?" Steve said, sheepish. He sat back from Tony and motioned at Bucky to move closer. "Tony Stark. Meet James Buchanan Barnes. Bucky, to his friends."
"Mostly dumb luck. I heard you calling out and came looking for you. I'd already found my way to a cabin, and there was a local man camping nearby who had a phone, so we were able to contact the rescue services," Steve summarizes. It feels like all that happened ages ago, even though it hasn't even been a full day yet.
He couldn't yet wrap his mind around everything that had happened during the past few days, on his subjective timeline. He'd thought he'd lost everything when he'd died on that rooftop, and yet, somehow, even though he wasn't dead, things were even worse than he'd expected.
"And she's happily matched with Happy." As soon as the words were out, Tony realized they'd probably sounded bitter, even though he hadn't meant it that way. Really, it was best for everyone.
"I got where I am by being smarter than him," Stane returned sharply, pointing his forefinger at Tony. "Tony Stark," he spat out the name, eyes on the motionless figure in the chair, "would've wasted the company's resources in a futile fight for some utopian future. It might've taken longer, but he'd have ended up exactly where he is now, either way: a penniless nobody. I did everyone a favor by taking him down before he could wreck Stark Interplanetary."
Everything hurt, worse than anything Bucky had ever felt. Even thinking. The worst of all was his arm. Starting from his left shoulder, he felt nothing except brightly flaring agony, as if the entire limb were on fire. When he tried to take a deep breath, it sent him coughing, the fire spreading to his lungs as well, suffocating him. For a a small eternity, all he could do was cling to consciousness, because he was sure that if he let go, he wouldn't wake up again.
"Shhh, we can talk later." Steve tightened his arms around Tony in something resembling a hug, holding him in place firmly, but gently. "All that matters is that you're back with us."
"From now on, you will be responsible for him," the Mayor added. "We want him to stay on our side, and Rumlow's approach would be counterproductive. I think you'll do much better."
Tony's mouth was a thin line, his eyes the exact shade of disappointed that had now become linked to a primitive, subconscious terror in Steve's mind. He had to look away, his arms wrapped around his knees, concentrating on the rough texture of the blanket under his fingers.
"So, the question is, what do we want to do about it," Tony went on. The color was returning to his cheeks, and the look he gave Steve was openly flirty. "Because I've got some ideas, and I've gotten a certain impression from you, based on, you know," he waved a hand in the air between them, vaguely indicating the bond they shared, "but I don't want to jump to conclusions."
"I always thought it was hogwash," Steve said, shaking his head and crossing his arms. Hearing it from Fury, who was no-nonsense about everything, somehow made it seem more tangible than the dozens of websites and the handful of scientific texts he'd read.
"Hopefully sooner. For now, I'm going to look into Maya Hansen and her academic friends," Steve decided.
Whatever the results, it'd be painful, and it wouldn't change anything; whether they were a match or not, Steve would still hate him and wouldn't want anything to do with him.
Tony raised his eyebrows. "Oh? What kind of work dealings would a nice, handsome guy like you have in a place like this?"
Steve caught one of Tony's nervously gesturing hands between his, running a soothing thumb over the back of it. "You're definitely allowed, and I'm not about to complain as long as you didn't pick it because you think it's what I want. How does it feel?"
"Yes, exactly," Steve says. "And not just where it comes to looks or skills. They modeled my mind after his, and used all the available historical data to train my behavioral patterns."
The thought crossed Steve's mind that he might've set himself up for a mission that was doomed to fail. Counting the years, Stane had been playing the part of Tony Stark in the public eye longer than Tony himself. He wasn't going to slip accidentally. But Steve had known this wouldn't be easy, and he was going to try as hard as he could to get what he needed.
He kept going with his exploration, letting his hands travel lower along Tony's thighs, his knees, his legs, then up again, skimming his inner thighs. He still didn't touch Tony's cock, though he let the fingers of one hand brush against his balls.
Steve had already known that, because the thread would only be there if there feelings were mutual, but it still made his heart soar that it was the first thing Tony had chosen to tell him after that awful silence.
Steve wasn't going to. Whatever she had to say, he wasn't interested. He ran past the stalls where he'd shopped earlier, water splashing at his feet.
"So, on the plus side, the armor upgrade is awesome." Tony rubbed at the micro-repeater implant on one forearm. Unlike the arc reactor, which was a constant background ache even on a good day, he could barely feel the chips that allowed him to link with Mark 42. "On the downside," he went on, "a lot of good people paid a high price for me being an asshole. Overall? A spectacular clusterfuck, even by my standards."
He headed back into the ruined building, looking around for any clues he might've missed. The spot where he'd found Tony was as they'd left it; the beams hadn't collapsed any further, and the small space where Tony had been stuck was still open. Moving as cautiously as he could, Steve peered into it.
Rhodey raised his eyebrows. "Biotech project? Should I be worried?" He nodded towards Tony, casting a pointed glance at the glow of the arc reactor.
Tony picked up a mug from the table—coffee, probably, and cold going by his frown. He set it down again, untouched. "So, yeah," he went on. "So far, I've only talked to a bunch of doctors, and they only knew the medically relevant details. I remember the fight at the workshop, some of that stuff in VR," a look of discomfort passed his face, "and I know that there were some complications getting me back to frame space. I have no clue how you actually managed to get in the Tower. What happened to Obie, anyway? I hear I'm officially myself now, so clearly he's no longer Tony Stark."
"Is it okay if I'm here?" Tony asked, sounding timid in a way that reminded Steve of their last night together at Steve's apartment, all those decades ago. He'd stayed in the background, behind Rhodey and Pepper, leaning on the doorframe.
He felt a tad too excited as he knocked on the door and waited for someone to answer. He reminded himself he wasn't here to make friends, but to work on the investigation.
Steve was all too familiar with those villains, but so far, he hadn't seen anything to suggest they might be playing a part here. "Do you have any particular reason to suspect Hydra involvement in the current events?"
"I couldn't agree more. I'll see to it," Tony declares, and waves a hand at the TV. "JARVIS, close that. We've seen enough."
The neighborhood was middle-class, that neutral halfway point between the seedy warehouse and Tony and Jan's luxurious homes. Even without the fire engines parked in front of the five-story apartment building and the ladders leaning against the wall, it wouldn't have been difficult to see which apartment was burning: thick smoke was rising from several open, or broken, windows.
His plan for breaking out was so flimsy that it barely deserved to be called a plan at all. Since the strutter was useless without a power source, what he had left was setting off the charges. They could then use the resulting chaos to break free through the back gate. It was something he'd learned about from Pearly-eye; conveniently close to the Vault and also the only possible exit for the
Tony did lie down, landing heavily on his back on his wide, luxurious bed as soon as he'd reached it.
Tony was still smiling, and it was every bit as charming as it had been last time. Again, it looked and sounded a whole lot like he was trying to flirt with Steve. In fact, Steve would've been hard pressed to figure out how he could've been more flirty. In spite of his resolution to play this carefully, it put Steve's foot firmly in his mouth when he tried to reply.
Tony thinks he won't be looking forward to it, himself. He'll probably spend the following month dreading it, both because his previous memories of that place aren't particularly great, and because he's terrified of confronting all their issues in earnest. There's a good chance that the whole thing will backfire, and this delicate truce that they've built will dissolve to nothing. Still, it's worth a shot. It's not as if things between them can get much worse than they were.
There was a cool cloth on his brow, one soothing feeling to counteract all the pain, and he felt himself starting to drift away.
A fireman with weather-beaten skin and a graying beard acknowledged him with a nod. "Captain. What can we do for you?"
"Believe me, the people working for me don't care about that in the least," Fury said. "We'd prefer for you to stay out of storage."
"Day's specialties are on the board," the waiter said, waving a hand at the blackboard on the wall without taking his eyes off of Steve.
The incident that had originally sent Steve on Tony's trail was the biggest gap left in Tony's knowledge of what had happened. Maya had told him the events at the Fountain, and various mobsters had described their encounters with him before every other fire, but none of them had admitted to having ever been to Jan's townhouse.
When Steve let go, he was frowning at Bucky. "What happened to your arm?" he asked, and took hold of Bucky's metal hand, pulling back his sleeve to reveal more of the prosthetic.
"If you describe the best-working democracy I've ever witnessed as oppression, I'm extremely curious to hear what your alternative would be," Stark replied skeptically.
He realized Steve must also be catching some of his feelings, but this wasn't like telepathy. Steve wouldn't know what he was thinking. He supposed what Steve could catch would be just as confusing as what Tony was getting from Steve.
Tony sighed and pursed his lips. "I'm sorry you don't believe it, but I actually do. If I didn't, you'd still be in storage. I could've picked anyone to tackle this case. I picked you."
For a brief moment, he was overjoyed, only to have that turn into a cold fear clawing at his gut when Tony didn't slow down. He wasn't flying, he was falling.
"I'm trying to make sure we all get to keep our limbs, you bonehead," Stark snapped back when Rumlow let go of his face, and then switched to the dinosaur language again.
Tony laughed, a chilling, joyless, almost deranged sound. He shook his head once more, pressing a hand over his eyes. "That's what you always say. No. I'm done playing. I quit. Go away."
He closed his eyes and maybe lost track of time for a bit, because the next thing he knew was Pepper's voice shouting "Boss," except that it wasn't Pepper, it was Friday. "Boss! Tony? Please let me call for help, your vitals are all over the place."
"I know exactly how that goes, and I understand. I just wanted to tell you that you don't need to put on a brave face for me," Steve said. "You never think any less of me if I admit that I'm weary and hurting, right? You shouldn't think any less of yourself, either."
"I wasn't always the man you've learned to know," Tony went on. He still spoke in that serious tone, completely different from the one he'd used when spinning his previous yarns. "When I turned 18 and got my hands on the inheritance, it wasn't pretty. I'd lost my parents. I'd been told that because of my weak heart, I might not live to be very old myself. The way I saw it, I could either spend my short life moping, or I could have some fun. The latter sounded like the better plan.
He wouldn't think of how trapped he was. He was exactly where he wanted to be. This was going according to plan. He squared his jaw and stared at the matte gray walls.
"They're all great stories, and true, too, but none of them answer your question," Tony said, his voice soft and somber. "The one that does, well, that isn't a good story at all." He fell silent, as if waiting for Steve to react.
Rumlow had stepped in to restrain Stark, with Stark squirming against his hold. The other members of the party were pointing guns at the monster. Bucky did so, too, although their haphazard collection of firearms seemed like a poor match against such an unimaginably horrifying creature. He would've been lying if he'd said his human hand wasn't shaking.
"I know you think what happened to you is more of a curse than a blessing," Steve said softly, "but it's not all bad. I'm so glad you're all right."
It took a while for Tony to pick up. It occurred to Steve that Tony was probably so busy running his company and working on his countless engineering projects that he might not have time for random phone calls. Steve was considering if he should just send an email instead or wait and call again later when Tony finally answered.
Tony did his damnedest to hold back what he felt and to answer every single word Steve said with a quick wisecrack, simultaneously searching for any sign of a reaction on Steve's extremely handsome face. He couldn't catch one, nothing beyond exasperation and confusion, and try as he might, he couldn't tell if some of the jumble of feelings buzzing through his mind might be coming from Steve.
Howard dropped the journal on the table and raised his hands in surrender. "No, no, that's not what I'm saying! All love is important. No one knows that better than I do, I've loved lots of ladies in my day!" he said hurriedly. "I'm all for everyone getting together with whoever they want to, it's all good. I'm just saying, if there were someone out there you could have this special connection with, wouldn't you want to know?"
The moment the guard's mouth was free, he let out a high-pitched call that rang loudly in the still night.
Steve tried to figure out the timeline in his head. The drones had invaded the workshop while Stane's mind was still somewhere in the middle of the transfer and re-frame process. He'd probably be waking up in the new clone any moment now, but after that, he'd need time to settle in and catch up on the time he'd missed; the backup would be from last night, so he wouldn't know anything about what had happened today. That actually made the situation more hopeful.
Rumlow clamped a hand over Stark's mouth before he managed to say anything else. "This had better not be another escape attempt. We were told to bring you in alive, sure, but no one said you need to have all your limbs intact," he hissed into Stark's ear.
Tony hooked his foot around Steve's ankle. "I wasn't expecting to see you again either, and I regretted that. I swear I'm usually not this forward. It's just, things are a little complicated for me right now, and I don't know what the future will bring, so I'd like to make the best of this, while we can," he explained, speaking with more intensity than he had so far. "If you want to."
"Jarvis," the not-butler said, without elaborating on what it was that he actually did, and shook Steve's hand firmly.
Tony finally turned his eyes towards her, to see that there was a smile playing on her lips. Tony scowled at her. How could she not see this for what it was?
Steve frowned. "So, you're not going to bring Stane to justice, or expose his crimes to the public eye?"
Bucky could barely believe it, but Stark had to be telling the truth. The only person who could've told him that Steve was Cap was Steve himself.
The way Tony said that, without any hesitation, like he was stating a fact, made Steve feel a little foolish, but he couldn't shake his discomfort. "Not wrong. It's just—it's not decent. It's not something Captain America would do."
After he'd spent the morning fruitlessly combing through the ruins, he contacted Pepper, and asked if she could arrange a meeting, because he had bad news. A few hours later, they gathered at Tony's townhouse: Pepper, Jarvis and James Rhodes, a black man in a uniform with a colonel's insignia. Steve couldn't tell if Rhodes was serious and quiet by nature, or if it was the occasion. He didn't smile once, but neither did anyone else.
"Really? That's all you've got to say about me? Aw, Tony," the AI complained. "I'm also smarter, faster, and I've got bigger guns, too." Not the sort of attitude that Steve found confidence-inspiring, coming from a disembodied intelligence.
"No virtual realities today, I promise," Hammer said, and picked up his glass. "Everything is one-hundred-percent real here, and organic, too. Waiters, food, wine. To your good health." He raised the glass towards Tony.
He'd started noticing things perhaps half a year ago; nothing too glaring, but they'd been getting more and more missions that were simple raids and relied on brute force. A year ago, an assignment that ended up with not only a body count but actual irreversible deaths had been rare. Now, they were becoming an almost weekly occurrence. He didn't like that. Whatever one's crimes, a node kill was always too harsh a punishment.
Tony doesn't have the energy to argue, but he definitely doesn't want to be carried. He's still got some dignity left.
"Yes, but she'll be heading home any minute now," the guard answered. "Whatever it is, you should wait for tomorrow."
"I'm glad you've found work for the SR100 that fits its talents so perfectly," Kamski notes, not directly referring to Captain America, but obviously implying he's figured out what's going on. "Even though it was a bit of an oddball and gave us a lot of trouble, it was one of my favorite designs, and I was sad to have to keep it stored away indefinitely."
Finally, after a trip that felt much longer than the five hundred meters Pepper had described, they came to a halt in front of a door with a bio-ID lock. Pepper faced it, and the door slid open right away, revealing a room more brightly lit than any of the spaces they had traversed.
"You hear that, Cap? I told you! It's not just a thing out of romance novels," Howard announced, his flashy grin particularly triumphant. "There's science! There's solid evidence right here!" He tapped at the science journal on the table in front of him with his index finger.
After four days of this almost-pleasant trekking, they descended to the Northern Plains, where they met another small group of Northerners guarding a larger group of steeds. Unsurprisingly, these weren't dinosaurs, but some type of early horse ancestors. From there on, the trip became far less fun: Tony's captors locked him in a carriage, where he sat as they rode across the plains. Again, it wasn't as bad as it could've been. They still let him out a few times every day so that he could stretch his legs and answer nature's call, and they still gave him food and water, but spending day and night in a windowless cabin wasn't exactly his idea of a good time—and he suspected it was only a prelude to what he had to look forward to later.
"Yes. Been wondering about that since he first put me on the case," Steve said between spoonfuls of gruel.
Tony put his arm around Steve's waist, leaning his head against Steve's side. "I really don't deserve you. I don't. But thank you, for everything," he murmured.
Unsurprisingly, Tony hasn't woken up while Steve was away. In fact, if he's improved at all, Steve can't tell. Tony's breathing and heartbeat are still almost imperceptible and extremely slow, and his skin feels just as chilly as before.
Cornucopia was a picturesque town of small, rustic houses, surrounded by the plentiful fields and orchards that gave it its name. Jarvis had reserved an entire floor of a guesthouse for the group, which they would pay for by helping in various tasks; Jarvis's skills as a mechanic were particularly sought-after. Rhodey was already there as well, but to Steve's surprise, none of Tony's dinosaur friends were anywhere to be seen.
Tony gave him a lopsided grin. "That's sweet of you, but not what I meant. You're not going to be limited by that deal you made with Obie anymore. You'll be able to swap, too, if you want. And cost isn't an issue. Name any frame you'd like, and I'll make it happen."
Together, they make their slow way to the bedroom upstairs, Steve supporting Tony when he's hit by a dizzy spell and stumbles on his feet.
It was like some antique myth. Steve could have what he wanted, as long as he didn't look. He hoped against hope that one day he could yet see Iron Man's face, but today, he wasn't about to press the matter. "I won't," he said solemnly.
"You're not making any sense!" Bucky exclaimed, frustrated. Insisting that getting outside would help while actual medical attention wouldn't was so bizarre, it definitely sounded like a scheme. "How do you expect me to help you when you're refusing to explain what's wrong?"
As much as Steve knew that the body Tony was admiring was just a fake and not his own, that hungry look was still flattering, and a huge turn-on, enough so that his cock was starting to harden.
“Oh,” Tony said. Steve could’ve sworn he almost looked disappointed. “We did make out in the quarantine room, though, didn’t we? Or was that all a slime-induced hallucination?”
Tony’s flirty look made a comeback accompanied by a lopsided grin. “Not if Bruce was watching, I wouldn’t.”
He reaches to feel for a pulse at Tony's throat, but just as he knows to expect, the skin beneath his fingers is cold and lifeless.
"He meant every word of it, you know," Pepper said softly. "He didn't want you out because we need your help. It was because he was worried he'd lose you for good."
He was going for a gun. He was cornered, and he knew that any investigation would be rendered pointless if Tony was dead.
"Pepper's the one currently writing it. Raised quite the hubbub when the first issue came out with her name on the cover," Jarvis explained. "And no, she's not his lady."
"Clearly you're not fine, then," Steve said, his mind made up. "I'll escort you to the emergency personnel, have someone make sure you don't have a concussion."
Tony stepped back and caught hold of Steve's hands as they fell away from him. "Yeah. True. That conversation. I need to get it right, this time. Talk first. I'll try not to ruin it."
Steve grabbed a bar stool and raised it in front of himself just in time to parry the first attack. The claws cut into it, slicing the seat cushion in half and leaving him holding just a metal frame. He turned it sideways to put at least something between himself and his attacker, blocking another sharp-clawed lunge.
"Stop," the Kingpin said, raising his hand, palm outwards, at his men. He left the ring of guards around Tony and walked over to Maya, stopping right in front of her. He didn't make a single threatening gesture, but just his figure looming over her was enough to give the effect. "You'd better explain yourself, and fast, Dr. Hansen. You're the one who said he had it, and I find it hard to believe that things just happen to spontaneously combust around Mr. Stark for no reason at all."
The next thing he did feel was someone toeing him in the ribs, sharply. Then what must've been the same boot turned him over on the ground so that he was lying on his back, staring up. His vision cleared slowly, the too-bright haze coalescing into a figure towering above him. It was holding a stun prod.
Tony drew a sharp breath and blinked, his eyes seeming to refocus on the cavern around them. Clearly, Steve had caught him by surprise. Finally, he looked down at Steve, and said, "Hm, I did, didn't I? It's quite the story. I guess now is as good a time for it as any."
"If I do anything that you don't like, anything that doesn't feel okay, just let me know, right?" Steve checked.
To cover for the moment of distraction, Steve leaned closer and pressed a kiss on Tony's stomach. Doing that, he realized that every inch of skin that he saw was perfectly smooth. He wouldn't have expected that. He knew Tony had been in the war, just as Steve had, and had been adventuring for many years before that. Surely he must've been injured at least a few times. There should've been some scars.
"Which means I've had plenty of time to settle in already," Steve said, planting his hands on Tony's knees, looking him in the eyes. "Look, if you don't want this, that's perfectly fine. You can say so. We can focus on me instead, or just cuddle or have a cup of coffee, leave the other stuff for later. But if you're just protesting because you think this is some huge favor that you don't deserve, you can stop worrying. I want to do this for you. I want to touch you. I want to feel every micron of your body."
Steve knocked the guard's head against the wall behind him, hard. He fell quiet except for a hiss of pain, followed by equally harsh breaths. Steve felt no sympathy for him as he quickly gagged him again.
Steve knew how well-endowed this frame was, but Tony had yet to find out. Steve grinned at him, and let him pull his pants and briefs down to his ankles.
That wasn't what Steve had expected; by the sound of it, Tony was lacking some puzzle pieces as well. Waiting for Maya's reply, he barely dared to breathe for fear of missing some crucial word.
"Okay, sure. Where do I start?" Tony sighed, looking away from Steve, his troubled expression just like that of his younger self, eighty-five years ago in Steve's living room. "I never stopped thinking about you. All those years. Wondering what I should've done differently, and if I could've somehow prevented you from getting killed and set up."
He sits there in silence for a moment, watching the still figure of the android bathed in that undulating orange light, feeling the equally sluggish beat of his own damaged heart. His chest hurts constantly, these days; a brighter, sharper pain around the rim of the electromagnet buried in the center of it, and a deep ache beneath, as if he can feel the shrapnel inching closer.
"Jarvis, we've talked about this. No need to rub it in," Tony said, scowling at the ceiling. "Anyway. I'd love to stay in bed all day, but I'm worried we're working against the clock, and we have an assassination to plan. If you're still in, that is." he turned his eyes towards Steve again.
Steve’s expression was inching away from slightly grumpy towards full-on righteous Cap wrath. “An adult? Like you? You’re a narcissistic jerk with a god complex!”
Finally, finally he slumps into bed, still dressed in his undersuit. He can't be bothered to get in properly, but lays on top of the bedspread and pulls one edge of it over himself, mumbling "thanks and good night" at Steve.
"It had better be," Tony said. He'd already sent her samples to his top geneticists. There were certain advantages to having a strong presence in the biotech field. "Honestly, she's put up with so much crap from me, she should be nominated for sainthood. It's a proper miracle she hasn't walked away ages ago."
He backtracks to the rocky outcrop he crossed earlier. It doesn't take long for him to find a nook between boulders that offers a modicum of shelter. It won't keep him dry if there's rain, but it will protect him from the worst of the wind that's starting to pick up. He'll also be hidden from view in the unlikely situation that someone comes looking for him. It's never a bad idea to be prepared, even if there's been no sign of Tony's would-be kidnappers making a reappearance.
Steve hadn't even gotten off his bike when Tony emerged from the house, no doubt alerted by the sound of the approaching engine.
There was a sudden loud crack, and the car rocked around them. They'd taken a hit. As if they'd needed a reminder of how urgent the situation was.
"Not really," Steve said. It was true, too; during the war, he'd hardly had time for relationships, not to mention the challenges of maintaining his secret identity. Since the end of it, he'd had nothing beyond brief and often anonymous encounters with no emotional attachment.
"Shh," Steve hushed him, and peeled off his sock to press a kiss on the bridge of his foot. "I'm not the one who just practically came back from the dead."
Tony took a few stumbling steps backwards until he hit the chaise longue. He fell heavily into it, wide-eyed and panting.
The only person he'd known who was still alive and not a fugitive was Tony, and going by this conversation, he'd grown up to exemplify everything that Steve hadn't liked about him: he was self-centered, shallow and callous. As if there was nothing left but the worst parts.
It was difficult to admit that he might've let himself be misled so badly; it was both embarrassing and infuriating. Steve would've been ashamed of him.
He places a cautious hand on the android's shoulder and gives it a nudge. "Hey, you awake?" he tries.
Hammer looked shocked enough that Steve believed him—but for solving their current predicament, it didn't really matter. Regardless of who had been controlling the drone that had started the firefight, now that all of them registered the opposing side as a threat, they would keep on fighting until one side had completely destroyed the other.
He could've made an effort towards his new goal right away and asked Tony if they could spend more time together tonight—have dinner, for example—but he needed time alone to catch his breath. The way his mind was buzzing with the day's events, he probably would have been too distracted to carry on a conversation anyway.
"After a week, late in the afternoon, we came across a statue half buried in the undergrowth. It was a sign that we were getting close, Juan said, but it would still take half a day to reach the temple itself, so we decided to set up camp for the night. As usual, Cauac wandered off. No one paid much attention to that— we knew that he'd be back by morning. After a pleasant evening spent in good company, we alI settled in our tents to rest.
The thought came with an instant wave of guilt and regret. This was wrong. This was so wrong. Steve shouldn't be here and he shouldn't be doing this. He should stop. He should tell Tony who he really was. He should handcuff Tony and drag him to the police.
Kamski quits CyberLife before the end of 2028. The reason for this is left vague in the press releases, and he doesn't give a single interview afterwards. Possibly related to whatever circumstances led to this, he never contacts Tony to ask for the thirium reactor plans. Tony certainly doesn't mind getting off the hook thanks to this, but he eventually decides to gives Kamski a call anyway, because he feels like there's unfinished business between them.
"How's the frame handling?" Peggy asked conversationally as they waited for the elevator to climb up to the administrative floor.
"It's just for tonight, we can manage," Steve said. He was used to cramped sleeping arrangements—during the war, they'd been the norm more than the exception.
As soon as he was entirely free, the dinosaur started lumbering towards Stark. Bucky followed, trying to push down the nonsensical protective urge to try to hold back the dinosaur. He wasn't sure where that came from: was it because he'd grown to respect Stark, or because he felt guilty, or perhaps the very selfish concern that if Stark didn't make it, he'd have no one to guide him back to Steve?
He reached for the water bottle to rinse away the phantom taste of copper in his mouth. It was almost empty. He drank the last drops and got up, slowly and cautiously, the concrete cold and rough under his bare feet. He still felt dizzy, but not overwhelmingly so.
Steve turns towards him, instantly folding away the paper. "I promised I'd stick around, didn't I?" he replies, with a slight smile, which seems out of place with the depression beard.
"There, good as new," he said. "I don't think it's too serious, but if you start feeling nauseous or get a bad headache, let us know."
"And why not? Not like you had any issues with leaving me alone when we first got there," Tony reminds him. A slight flush has appeared on Tony's cheeks, and while it makes him look a little healthier, this isn't how Steve wanted to get there.
"Hot damn," Tony breathed. "You sure they didn't accidentally put you in a sex bot? That's, I'd call that excessive for your line of work."
He went back to the beginning and told Bucky the whole story as he'd been able to piece it together: Maya's mob-funded expedition and Tony's group running into them, the Fountain of Youth, the fight that had taken place there, and the events after they'd returned home, from Maya's changing stories to the Kingpin to Tony's plight with the mob that had led to the fires. For some parts of the tale, Steve only had Maya's word to go on, but that was all anyone had. Tony had claimed not to remember the events at the Fountain, and whether he did or not didn't really matter, since he wasn't around to give his account.
"You know what it also means?" Pepper pushed on, because they didn't share a mystical connection, and obviously all she could see was Tony staring mournfully at his empty glass.
It's been months since Tony last set eyes on Steve, back in Siberia, when everything went to hell. Steve has changed during the time he's spent as a fugitive, his all-American perfection giving way to a dark-dyed costume and a scraggly beard that shouldn't look good, and yet, he still manages to pull it off. Of course he does. That doesn't make Tony any less annoyed at seeing him. More than annoyed, though, he's confused.
"You did. You just had to ride to the rescue, didn't you? You fought Mallen, but you were no match for him. He'd already killed Al. Everyone else had fled," Maya explained, her face reflecting the horror she must've felt back then. "You were badly injured. Dying, probably. I told you we should run to safety, but you argued that you wouldn't make it, and that someone needed to stop him. So I helped you into the Fountain."
That, he might do, Steve had to admit: like Tony's friends always said, he was a survivor, and if survival had required feigning obedience, he would have gone for it. "Well, whatever's going on, it won't matter anymore," Steve said. "We're going to get him out of there tonight. We should go tell the others and start preparing for the operation."
"Tony?" Rhodey asks him without letting his eyes off Steve's. "This android claims to be working for you."
Steve did get distracted, his own hand on Tony's cock half forgotten as he thrust into Tony's fist. "Tony," he moaned breathlessly. He'd had to avoid using that name the last time they'd been together. It felt good to be finally able to say it aloud. No more lying and hiding.
He was having breakfast on the third morning after Tony's text when the phone started ringing. It wasn't Tony, but an unknown number. That shouldn't have been possible.
Steve almost chuckled aloud at that. "That's got to be a first, someone worrying that they'd hurt Captain America."
"As long as it's good down here, I don't care. But if you're lying to me, I'll come back and find you." Steve gave her his most menacing glare.
"As a matter of fact," Tony began, but the waitress finally showed up, saving Rhodey from Tony's best take on Modern Molecular Genetics for Dummies. Not that Tony was about to complain; this also meant that he finally got his coffee and put in an order for a pile of eggs, bacon and pancakes. After last night's party, he needed some salt and grease with his caffeine. Which made this exactly like most mornings in his life.
"On the bed, you," Tony called out as he stepped through the doorway, right on Steve's heels. "I wasn't nearly done with the inspection yet."
He missed Tony so, so much. The thought of losing him was unbearable. Steve had barely come to terms with the loss of Bucky, and in that, having Tony by his side had helped, even if he had mostly avoided speaking of the topic. The emotions were still too raw, the memories too recent. Of course, if the worst came to pass with Tony, at least he wouldn't be facing it alone. He had other friends, now, like the group he was traveling with. They were all good people, and he was glad for their company, but it wasn't the same. Tony had become so much more than a friend. Steve had pictured them spending the rest of their lives together; a future brighter than he'd ever dared to imagine for himself.
"I always do that, but I'll try to be extra careful this time," he promised. "Is it all right if I ask my teammates to do the same? I won't tell them why. They won't know about this conversation."
Tony made a little shrug. "Yeah. Kind of sentimental, I guess. I'm an old man. I'm allowed." For all that Steve kept saying that the frame didn't matter, that still sounded odd coming from someone looking so young.
Steve is all too aware of how vast the wilderness is. Even if Tony isn't very far, he won't be easy to find. It doesn't help that he was wearing a light-colored suit that will blend in with the terrain. At least the visibility has gotten better, with most of the mist dispersed from the valleys.
They head home towards the Tower at top speed, through one of Thor's wind tunnels. Natasha takes the helm, with Hulk and Clint staying out of the way while Sam and Tony see to Steve.
"The hard part? No, that was the easy part," Tony says—going straight back to disagreeing with Steve, as usual. Instead of elaborating, he yawns, which turns into a sigh.
Steve gaped at him, trying to make sense of the story. If there'd been another fire last night, the FDNY hadn't been contacted about it, but then, that didn't mean it wasn't true. If the mob was involved, maybe they'd wanted to keep it under wraps.
He ate mechanically, without tasting a thing, his thoughts on the last meal he'd had, the last night that he could remember, eating the take-out that Tony had picked for him. The younger, kinder Tony, the one with everything ahead of him, the one Steve had hoped might prove him wrong and turn out to be a better man than Steve expected of him.
"Thanks, but I think the floor looks extremely inviting," Tony returned curtly. The look on his face was mildly hostile, in line with his voice, and yet, somehow, Steve was sure Tony was more anxious than angry. So sure, he felt his own heart beat faster in response.
On many days, Steve felt guilty that he was just sitting around instead of actively going  after his teammates, but logically, he knew that disappearing like that would only make his position more complicated, and could reflect badly on the entire case. Now wasn't the time. He'd go later, when he had Tony to support him.
"Sorry it took me so long," Steve says, moving his hand to cup Tony's face, his thumb brushing Tony's cheek. "I'll be back in a moment. I just need to make sure this scumbag doesn't try anything."
"No. Not more than usual," Jarvis replied. Again, as hard as Steve tried to interpret his tone and expression, he couldn't decide whether Jarvis had maybe replied just the fraction of a second too quickly, or if that was just how he usually spoke.
Tony's breath was coming in shaky gasps, his chest heaving under Steve's caresses as he passed his nipples, this time purposefully not touching them. The look on his face when Steve glanced at him spoke clearly enough that even though he was every bit as tense as before, this was in a good way, his cheeks flushed, his mouth slightly open, his eyes closed.
Tony sighed and pressed his forehead against the bars. With his keepers' taking away their bright lantern, the room was illuminated only by a much smaller one hanging on the wall close to the doorway, its light barely reaching the furthest corners of Tony's cell. The back and left walls of his cell were stone, with no windows, while the bars of the front and right walls were spaced closely enough that only the tiniest of dinosaurs would be able to slip past them. There were four cells in total: one next to Tony's, two across on the other side of the corridor dividing the space.
"You're the people who kidnapped me. You might want to take a good look at who the real villains are in this scenario," Tony retorted, his eyes on Bucky's.
He's used to napping in all kinds of extreme circumstances. This shouldn't be any different. Besides, there's an additional advantage to the crevice he's hiding in compared to most other places: it's in the shadow. He already knows from last night that the sun doesn't entirely set here, suggesting that they must be above the Arctic Circle. Beyond his niche, it's still not entirely dark, bright sunlight lingering just above the horizon.
Tony gave him a wide grin, no doubt enjoying Steve's flabbergasted expression. "You going to come in, or just stand there looking like a fish out of water?"
He approaches the pack, glancing up and down the slope as he goes, and it doesn't take him long to catch sight of the figure on the ground, around five hundred feet across and uphill from him. It has to be Tony; the clothing matches what he was wearing when Steve last saw him. He's face-down and completely still, so it's no wonder Steve didn't spot him earlier.
Just a few stretches of corridor away he'd probably find everything he could hope for to break out of here, if he just played this carefully.
Clearly, Tony wasn't that deeply asleep; he blinks, looks up at her, and then seems to spot Steve, his eyes going wide. "Sorry, I don't think I'm awake yet," he says. "I'm seeing things that make no sense."
