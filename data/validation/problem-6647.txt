They hurried inside the lobby, which was three stories tall and boasted several elaborate fountains.  The man and girl were just disappearing down an escalator; Tony and Steve walked swiftly across the marble floor after them.
Steve broke into a run. He didn't need to understand Russian to know what the HYDRA symbols on their shoulders meant.
Steve did whimper, loudly, as Tony pulled him closer. It was good, the other's hand on his thigh gave him more support which he would definitely need soon enough. He was pretty sure his legs were about ready to give way beneath him. "T-Tony... fuck!" He trembled as Tony pushed his fingers inside. It always made him come apart quicker if Tony fingered him. It never quite felt the same, unless something was inside of him.
"They recommended I get a dog, actually," Steve whispered after a moment. "They were scared about me feeling isolated in the 21st century. And apparently they can help with PTSD."
It was Madeline Turner's card that Piper had given to him.  Tony pulled out his wallet and held it up. "This is what Piper gave us."
"G'night Steve.  Wake me up when it's tomorrow," mumbled Tony, pulling Steve close to him, cuddling their bodies together.  Steve's was smooth and warm against his.  This was how honeymoons were supposed to be; not scrambling away from exploding artillery shells and dodging electrified whips and flinging I-beams around.  This was normal, domestic, safe.  Even with the sunlight filtering in through the ceiling-to-wall windows that lined the west wall, Tony passed out easily, his head resting on top of Steve's, his arms around the blond.
"Tony.  Focus," said Pepper, who was used to Tony's odd over-focusing and distractability as a defense mechanism.  "Did you say Steve was re-bonded?"
Tony's mania was increasing; he was the same jittery, overly-excitable creature he'd been in Monaco just before the race, and he didn't wait for anyone to agree to anything; he tossed Natasha the cables, shoved a sledge hammer into Steve's hands, and then spent the next twenty minutes on the floor of the shop bending pieces of metal yanked off one of his cars into a series of small clips and rings, murmuring excited notes to JARVIS, who was keeping a projected lab notebook up in the shop that was utterly incomprehensible to anyone but Tony.
Tony finished grooming and followed Steve into the bedroom.  "Steve... are we gonna stay here?  Your place?  Because I have, you know... I have a place of my own worth, like, twenty-four million dollars that's currently sitting completely empty on the beachside.  I miss my shop.  My place also has a pool.  And a home gym.  And JARVIS.  I'm just saying."
"I love you," Steve whispered and then stepped back, head ducked down. Bucky followed. "Listen to me." He held up his hands. "You need to get out of here and you need to get Wanda and Pietro safe!"
They got into the car and Donner vaguely entertained the idea of belting it down the street. It was the kind of thing Steve would do. But where would he go? He had no money, no family that would speak to him. This was his best chance. Donner was a rational person. He wouldn't, and couldn't, try to run.
By the time JARVIS announced that he had re-calibrated his self-awareness programs, Tony was fast asleep on a pile of old photos, the bottle in his hand nearly empty.
"Like anyone even gives two shits' about omega rights.  They're just trying to distract us, man.  Stark's back in business and anyone with half a brain can tell this is all about Big Government trying to win us over with some pre-arranged bond--"
Tony grabbed the phone and went to the bar and grabbed Steve a bottle of water, too, offering it to him.
"I got a call from Ty.  He wanted to extend his congratulations.  Your phones are back at the hotel, I assume?"
"Not voting at all is still better than voting Republican," Steve mumbled under his breath and Banksy grinned.
"He's bad," added Vigor, who seemed more nervous than his sister.  "We can take care of you; you don't want Fletch. He's bad."
"...I created that new element," blurted Tony, trying to fill the silence.  He was suddenly very aware that he was only wearing boxer-briefs.
"Steve, maybe you should take a break from SHIELD for a little while," he said tentatively.  "You know, kick back, relax... not go on any dangerous missions... y'know, it'd take you all week alone to see everything at the Expo.  And you really need to get caught up on all the latest tech.  Hey, didn't you go to the one in '43?  Yeah, no, this one's better... the best one yet.  'Cause I made it myself."
Tony started to reassure Steve that he was already good, but he stopped.  That wasn't the right answer.  Steve wanted to be given a task to comply with.
Steve didn't say anything about his body rejecting the bite. The pain made it feel like the bite was fighting to stay, earning its place, and it meant that Steve was constantly reminded of its presence. Consciously,
"Captain Rogers... I think I might... might have something wrong with my head," he admitted carefully.  He didn't want to say he was incompetent for battle; he was certain he could follow orders if they were given to him.  He didn't want to make a big deal out of this.  He was great at hiding things.  Case in point: he'd longed to mate his omega for years and had forced himself not to because he knew he'd only hurt him, and he'd also hidden the palladium poisoning from Pepper, of all people, who was pretty much always at arm's length and probably had X-Ray vision.
His fingers ghosted briefly, delicately over Steve's lips, but then he pulled back and returned to cupping Steve's jawline, stroking his cheek, looking into his eyes.  Steve was looking up at him coyly, shy, his eyes darting down every few moments.  Tony held his gaze steady.  This was how Alphas stared; Steve's small, downward glances were how omegas showed respect and deference.  Tony hadn't been raised with that sort of old-fashioned etiquette but it came to him naturally, instinctively.  He was barely aware how intently he was staring into Steve's eyes.
"You excited to show me Brooklyn later?" asked Tony.  His tone was still flat, but he was trying. He paused, then added, "We can visit your mom, too, if you want.  She's in Brooklyn, right?" Tony's own parents were in Long Island, where he'd been born and raised. He couldn't help but notice, when they drove by the estates and country clubs and golf courses and stables and other such areas on the way to the graveyard, the occasional Alpha-omega pair.  He'd espied one where the omega was wearing a collar and looked away, hoping Steve hadn't noticed. Tony had never really paid attention to the fact that he had been bred and raised in a conservative, upper-crust, obscenely wealthy slice of society. Coming back with Steve had made it painfully obvious.  Every house was huge, a mansion, really, and all the cars had chauffeurs. Tony had felt an acute sense of embarrassment which he'd tried to dismiss by reminding himself that it wasn't really his fault Steve had grown up poor; besides, Steve was from the Great Depression,
"Every word that you utter that isn't answering my questions means another bone broken. Do I make myself clear?"demanded Steve.
"It's at least sprained," Doctor McCloud hummed and knelt down to look at it. She then grabbed some scissors to cut the bottom off of his jeans before pulling off his shoe. She didn't expect Tony to be prepared to move away from his mate again just yet. "I need this X-rayed. For now I want it bandaged with a splint," she told the nurse who was finishing up Tony's face.
for a while?  You're acting all screwy.  You're safe now, you can calm down."  Steve's domineering attitude was usually charming, but right now, Bucky was feeling annoyed by Steve acting like
"Come on, let's go," Howard said, curling an arm around his waist. Steve let him lead him out, still honestly half asleep. He grabbed his jacket off the clothes hook by the door. His ma's coat wasn't hung up there. Now that just wasn't....right.  Was she out?  A double-shift at the hospital, maybe?
"...hi.  Wow. Oh, wow.  Wow. Hi," he said, clearly not expecting a rumpled-looking Tony Stark to answer his own front door.
"Well, we'd better go get his dry cleaning.  The car looks great, huh, Steve? Here, Jorge..."  Tony pulled out a pair of hundreds and handed then to Jorge.  Jorge thanked him.
"I like assertive Alphas," hummed Cupid mildly next to Steve, smiling a vapid, serene smile while the headmaster sputtered.
"--Steve? Are you okay?" Aria had a hand on his arm. She was watching him with concern. So were the other agents. Steve looked across the room and realized he'd thrown his coffee against the wall.
Natasha's grip remained on his wrist, but Steve made no motion to pull away; he really didn't have anything left to give.
The conversation on the phone lasted a while and Steve sat by nervously. He was nervous about what Clint was saying and wished he could hear it himself. Although, it was obvious that he hadn't told Tony about his own family, from the half of it that Steve was hearing. If Clint had, Tony would have no doubt reacted in a rather noticeable way. Even when Tony lowered his voice to try and be subtle, Steve could still hear him because of his superior senses senses, but he ducked his head down, nose into the SNL script with him as president, and tried to pretend he wasn't listening.
It’s studies – artistic studies. Of people. Of Tony. So many of Tony. He pushes the papers around, seeking. Looking. In one he’s smiling. In another he’s pensive. Another he’s angry. Tony flips through the drawings. There’s no way Steve did them all over the long weekend. No one – not even a super soldier – can work that fast. Then he finds the one Steve did today. It’s rough, but it’s beautiful. The lighting especially emphasizes the contemplative look on Tony’s face. The curl of his hand and bend of his wrist as his face leans against it is exquisite. The touch of light across his scarred chest has signs of love and adoration with every stroke.
Tony shakes his head. “I’ve no idea, but I suspect it’s the little worm I implanted in his brain. So, it’s a tit for tat kind of thing right now.”
Thrill pulsed through Tony and he smiled at his father. “Wow! You made this, right?” It said so in the book, so he knew he was correct.
She ignored his protests. “Clint can’t keep the doors closed forever.” She bent down and brought Steve to his feet. Steve’s legs nearly collapsed under him. His lips were colorless, his eyes sunken. “Help me save him.”
With ease, Tony instructs Steven to the center of the large rack that looks more like a work out station with bars and swings. He brings a harness around and wraps it around Steven’s chest, securing it along his backbone with snaps. The chains that link the harness to the rack jingle as he works. Tony swallows several times. Even out of urgency this omega does him harm.
His mind drifts back to what he witnessed and he’s not sure he’s entirely sane. A man turned into a lion by some cosmic trickery? He recalls the lion in the cave when he was abducted but now, he’s questioning everything. Perhaps there was no lion. There’s no one to ask, Yinsen is dead, the Ten Rings members who held him prisoner are all dead, Obie is dead. No one can confirm what he saw. He glances back at Steve whose wearing his shirt around his waist and the armor’s boots. He keeps his sights in the far distance and Tony catches him sniffing at the light breeze like an animal, a predator trying to assess the threats.
“Divini?” The sure as hell sounded like god to him. It made no sense. It was also a little presumptuous of them – considering the name. The thing inside of him, the cancer growing to consume the rest of his energy shuddered at the name, as if it understood the consequences. He couldn’t understand this dichotomy within his thoughts, he couldn’t control it. “Just what the hell are you talking about?” The anger and fear welled up inside of him. What happened to Tony? What the hell was happening to him? “What happened to Tony? What aren’t you telling me?”
It deflated Tony as he considered Bruce’s words. He was right, of course.  Right now, Steve fought for his life just meters away from Tony. When he’d touched Tony and murmured the words, the bond felt bright, brilliant, but also brittle as if it might snap. The reality struck him and he swallowed down both fear and anxiety. “It might not stay. It’s not strong enough. He’s not strong enough.” The idea that Steve might die hovered over him.  What if he died? What would happen to all of them? What if Captain America died? Dizziness swam over him.
Exiting the car, Steve clenches Tony’s hand as Clint ushers them toward the steps of the clinic. Christine Everhart manages to get to the front of the pack. Her cameraman follows her with swift precision.
Instead of continuing down the vein of the hopeless, Tony takes a swig of his water and then asks, “Bucky means the world to you. Should I be worried?”
“It’s 7:15. We have to be at the clinic by 10 am.” Steve swallows down his fears. “Are you sure about this?”
“Hey, I’m not your seeing eye dog, you know,” Steve responds but he takes his place next to Tony’s left shoulder.
“There are heat signatures indicative of humans to the wide left, sir, but they seem to be moving away from the cave system.”
With little oxygen and almost no time to stop him, Steve lifted up his wrist and touched his healer brand to the Hulk’s tattoo. Why he did it, he had no idea – it felt more like instinct. He couldn’t speak, because the hand around his throat squeezed out all of his air, but this little motion, this action meant more. Somehow Steve knew it would. When the brands touched, the Hulk stopped mid-scream. The team members around them, Tony armored up, Hawkeye with bow and arrow drawn, Natasha with electrical rods at the ready, and Fury pointing a Glock at the Hulk, all paused as well. The shock wave hit them as the brands merged and a primal message, wordless but more profound, anchored Steve and the Hulk. The monster eased Steve to the floor, opened up his hand, and then simply lost hold of his form and shifted back to being Bruce just as quickly as it happened.
Scanning the skies, he tries to glimpse how the outside battle progressed, but he cannot catch a clue as the fortress looms to one side and the rocky slope up to the wooded area covers the rest. The river drains toward the rendezvous point, so he heads in that direction. Redwing speeds ahead of them, chirping and looping downward. Bucky’s sure the bird is on the lookout for Sam. The two are inseparable like Bucky and Steve used to be, before he lost Steve, before this damnable year passed.
“Yeah,” Steve says. His voice is quiet and thoughtful. “I’m starting to understand that.” His fingers pause in their magical work on Tony’s temples. “Is it okay if I touch your face?”
“No,” Tony says and reaches out to catch Steve’s wrist. He tugs him to turn and look at him. “Steve, I’m sorry if I did something you didn’t want. I am. I’m sorry that Natasha knows. But I’m very sorry that you want to deny yourself something that could bring you endless joy and bring you love.”
“Yeah, that was part of it, sure,” Bruce said but then he added, “He went after me when I changed. It was a complete disaster. I kind of crushed Harlem back then. Something was wrong with my change. They pretended it was the Harlem riot in ‘64. But it wasn’t. He wasn’t the Secretary back then of course. He was an up and coming political star.”
Pepper smiles and offers her hand. Steve takes it, there is an uncomfortable moment where he freezes as if he doesn’t remember what to do, but then he bends and kisses her hand. “It’s my pleasure, ma’am.”
“I am sorry. Pepper and I – well, we’ve been handling the situation for so long that we’ve actually stopped handling it and started to handle Tony. We started to treat him as if he couldn’t make his own decisions, as if he doesn’t understand. And that’s wrong. All of it is wrong.”
“No. No. Just rest. Good night.” He cuts off the connect before Obie can say another word. This – Steve thinks – is his opening.
“Thanks. It was my mom’s.” Steve smiles and, instead of listening to the ocean, gazes at his clasped hand. He doesn’t want to let go, though he knows he should.
Steve exhales and then tells the medics he’ll see what he can do. At the cabin door, he knocks and calls, “Tony?”
Steve smiles under his hand and it sends shocks, thrilling and surprising, through Tony. “Yeah. I think that would be good.”
He denied the truth for a while. How could he come to accept that Captain America had been a prostitute in New York City and that he'd died in a suspicious fire.  Eventually he needed to accept the facts but it still felt like ice in his belly. He tried to thaw it out. He fucked his way through Times Square and then in the mile high club and again all around Malibu. He vowed never to go back to New York. It hurt too much to think about Steve. How everything ended and left him with a pit of cold despair inside of him so that he would never feel again.
Steve had nodded, arms folded over his chest. His muscles tightened from tension and disuse. He’d felt nothing but worthless over the last few weeks as they tried to hunt down a faceless foe.
Hill eyed Tony but concentrated on Natasha and the situation at hand. “I can see what I can do, but the fact is you released all of SHIELD’s dirty little secrets on the web.” She moved to the reception area anyhow and leaned over to talk to the nurse on duty.
She joins him at the bench and places her hands over his fisted ones. “I’ve found this strange since the moment you picked him. He was supposed to be terminated and now he’s your Master of Security.”
A mysterious light of the slightest tinge of peach suffuses the sanctuary. He can see Tony well enough and also detects his frustration.
“Eat, you need your strength.” Tony offers him the fruit and Steve takes it. He shuffles a little to the side to welcome Tony to sit next to him on the bed.
That concerns Steve. The Red Skull gang knows that Bucky and Steve are close, if Schmidt spends anytime or thought on how to get Steve out of the picture, it would be to threaten Steve’s family – and his friends in Avenge are his family.
"I’m trying to establish whether or not Mister Rogers is subject to Alpha Privilege or not.” Ross clicks his fingers and the door opens. A guard enters and places a tablet on the table. Steve notes it is not a StarkPad. The delivery guard leaves the room. “Can you identify this man?” He pushes the tablet across the table for Steve.
“We can help,” the young woman – Wanda said. “I know how to manipulate the mind. It may help to guide you.”
Steve quickly gets the cookies and puts them on a plate and pulls out a milk bottle from the fridge. “Would you like anything?”
“The ad for the position said must be musically inclined. Sax a plus.” Steve points to the portfolio pocket.
“As you say.” She walks toward the door. “Think about it. What does Ultron not understand? What does he want? Why does he hate humans so much?” She offers him a sad smile. “You know why he kidnapped me?” She places her hand on the doorknob. She doesn’t wait for him to answer. “Because he wanted to share with someone. He had no one else. Think about that.”
“I could lose my license for that implant in the first place,” Strange strikes back. “It’s highly irregular. Not FDA approved and way beyond an investigational new device!”
This draws Steve to his feet and he’s taller than Tony at least by a head, but he feels dwarfed by Tony’s presence, his attitude, his self-assurance. “I don’t know Tony, this is a first for me. I haven’t ever.” He doesn’t want to admit he’s never truly given into his thoughts, his desires. He shouldn’t feel ashamed of that fact, but proud, yet somehow, in front of Tony, the embarrassment of years of lying overcomes him.
He places a hand over his mouth. It’s wrong. He can admit that. He’s being brutal and harsh. Part of him knows this, understands it, but another part relishes the power. His nature is ugly and heartless.
“What did they do, Steve?” And then Tony remembers the tiny protuberances on Steve’s back, the aura surrounding him, the warm feeling that Steve was still alive deep inside under the arc reactor.
Upon his father’s death, Tony Stark became the leader of the Western Clan. His first order of business? To find the ultimate stock, to feed on the frozen body of Captain America, Steve Rogers, for the rest of his unnaturally long life.
“By the way, how long am I stuck here?” Tony asks. He’s feeling more and more like himself; the seizure is a distant memory.
“Nope, just me, Wong.” Doctor Wong comes to the side of Tony’s bed. “I brought some of the better braille books I have in hand and your phone. Stephen wanted me to discuss some of the specifics of the clinical trial.”
Steve smiles, small and brave in a way. “Yes, it was.” Tony’s not sure if Steve is in the here and now, or back in his time, reliving his glory days. His answer comes almost immediately, “You want to do it again?”
As the meeting participants disperse, Steven stands sentinel over Tony – keeping an eye on the proceedings. Tony and Jamison discuss a few details of the meeting and the follow up that will take place after dinner. As they finish, Jamison glances at Steven and then back at Tony. He leans into Tony and speaks into his ear, “I don’t know what he did, but you have to set this right.”
“You want me to fix your nose?” Tony says as he sheds the armor. It’s a miracle to behold how it literally drops away into the small metal pouch on his chest.
“Oh the mouth on you!” Tony snickers and then pushes the head of his cock against Steve who immediately stills. “There you go. Now it’s real. Take a deep breath, deep, deep breath. And then release it as you relax. It will make this easier for the first time.”
Tony moves away, breathless but ravenous. “Shower. Let’s shower.” He nudges Steve and they kiss again.
Bruce yanks off his glasses as if they’ve done him an injustice. He drops his hand, lax in his lap. It looks like his glasses might slip from his fingertips. He huffs out a pent-up breath and then says, “You remember when Logan and Steve were in Japan. Well,” he pauses, “Well, Steve called with some questions about other worlds.”
He leans against the back of the elevator as it descends. He grips the rail and closes his eyes. When the elevator opens and JARVIS announces his arrival, Steve jolts and manages to get into his room, struggles to get to the bathroom. He orders JARVIS to sleep mode and then falls on the bed, just feet from the bathroom. All the strength given to him by Project Rebirth means nothing as the seizure overtakes him.
Flipping the shield upside down onto the newly fallen snow, Steve winks at him. The silver star on his chest shines in the brilliant sunlight. He yanks up his hood, which is similar in style to his helmet, and smiles at Tony. “Watch this.”
“But in the end I had to make a choice and I’m at peace with the one I made,” Natasha says and nods. There’s only the slightest of hesitations.
Steve stands, gazes down at Tony. “It maybe fake to you, but it’s never been to me.” He walks away without another word leaving Tony shaking and gasping for air. The man always takes his breath away.
“A soul pack is a group of people with a common cause,” Strange said. He inhaled, exhaled as if the entire meeting bored him. “It binds them together through – well, let’s just use souls. Bound together they are a unit, a living breathing unit.”
Obie, who is hanging near the doorway to the workshop, pops into the vast laboratory space that Tony designed in the 5th Avenue mansion. It's in the basement and it leads into the huge garage with Tony's collection of antique cars.
Steve stands up and tosses the papers on the desk. He’s too tired, too worn thin from all the battles he’s encountered over the last dozen years that he doesn’t have the patience to deal with this crap. “Are you having a crisis, Stark? You need to show up Daddy or something? Having a tantrum?”
Steve took Bucky's hand and they stepped out into the hallway. "Will you show me to the director's office?" he asked, clearly having zero interest in trying to run. "I'm sorry Buck. But we have to do this, to keep you safe,"
Which brought him to his next problem.  Because he'd already pushed Steve down and bitten down on the back of his neck,
"You may," Steve smiled subtly and took the offered hand. They didn't really bother with leading; they just kind of swayed together, Tony's arms around his waist and Steve's arms around his shoulders. The music was a little slower now so they could dance slow enough for it to be sweet, their noses almost brushing.
shop because he felt like he might have to throw up again.  He needed air. He slipped outside to the nearest balcony, which was, blissfully, empty.  It was a nice day but the crowd was inside, milling around the omegas. From this particular balcony, Tony couldn't see any picketers.  Thank Turing for that.
"Agent Phil Coulson.  He, Steve, and another omega, they work closely together.  Clint is with his Alpha," explained Pepper. "He was scaling the fridge earlier.  It's been a bit of a mess here."
Tony didn’t make it to Pepper; Rhodey accosted him first, grabbing Tony by the shoulders. "I think Steve's friend just hit on me."
"I can't believe I'm saying this, but I sure hope it's another subpoena," said Tony.  He crossed his fingers and pulled open the door himself.
in itself. It almost felt like he was watching Tony kiss someone else and it was made even more awkward by the fact that Tony wasn't enjoying doing it. Tony's own uncomfortableness was palpable. But Steve was horrified because he understood.  He didn't need DeSoto to explain anymore. He got it.
The Alphas ignored them.  They were staring into each other's eyes, barely blinking; the hair on the back of their necks were up and their upper lips were twitching.  The reporter was clutching her camera, looking blissful.
Steve gripped the railing of the stairs as he nearly doubled over, a tremor of left over heat racking through him. He swore. "Fuck. Oh my God.  God
Tony stared down at the muffin.  He wanted to ask Steve if they were really bonded but he didn't want to look stupid in front of Sam or Natasha.
made it work.  Tony was getting thoroughly aroused, and his thoughts were swirling with memories of both Steve and that fucking redhead--
Tony walked back over to the pool and slid in, hanging on the edge with his elbows, one hand holding the neck of the bottle.
He got up and went to the kitchen to grab some more OJ; the carton outside had been nearly empty and Tony wasn't done drinking yet.
Steve took Peggy for walks each day. He knew it couldn't last. Repetitive behaviour was dangerous and he didn't want SHIELD to find him. But Steve savoured every moment. Her willowy frame would lean on his as they traversed around the home's fancy gardens and Gertrude did watch on curiously, pretending to water her plants, drowning the flowers as she stared. On his last day, Peggy seemed sad when he told her he had to go, but she didn't seem surprised either.
"I'll come to bed soon," said Tony, glancing up for a fraction of a second when Steve kissed him.  "Ten more minutes."
"...also a reindeer name," said Tony, wisely.  As a child, he had thought Nixon was a reindeer because that's how his father had read it.
"Santa Monica.  Just go south, you can get the UCLA med center in like an hour.  Well... forty, in this car," said Tony.
Bucky couldn't be here. Steve moved to back away and then loudly walked into a metal cart behind him, knocking off files, medical instruments, and several small tubes full of bright blue liquid.
"It's fine," he assured her. And then Pepper disappeared back inside, bringing the phone back up to her ear.
Maybe he was reading too much into things.  Maybe whoever sent them simply thought tulips were pretty.
"...round two?" asked Tony eagerly, one hand already on Steve's hips, his semi-erect penis pressed between Steve's legs.  He'd already downed a third of the bottle of champagne but wasn't feeling it, yet; he wanted to shove himself into Steve and polish off the bottle before the effects of alcohol inhibited his ability to fuck.  This was one of Tony's methods; he drank continuously, slowly, and right before fucking, went crazy.  This had a dual benefit; it let him skip the detriments of whiskey dick and also helped him pass out immediately afterward, avoiding pillow talk.
"Hey, look at it this way, boss," said Happy from the driver's seat.  "If you lose a hundred IQ points, you'll still be smarter than the rest of us."
He opened his mouth but didn't remember his name.  "It's--"  God damn it.  "--me," he finished.  He felt helplessly confused about who "me" was.  He felt like he was three, maybe four different people.  "Hold on.  I've got a light."  He yanked down his shirt.  The arc reactor burned its steady, soft, white-blue light, temporarily blinding him.
Steve's phone chimed and Tony watched him with undisguised curiosity.  Who the hell was texting Steve?  Everyone important was at Tony's party, downstairs.
he was. They still tried it on even then. He was something to use and then throw in the mud. Christ, Steve didn't have proper citizenship (something they rectified after the war, thank god). At least once he was a soldier, and the serum had made him big, he was
"Don't be.  I ended up in a good place," said Phil.  He shoved an empty ice cup out of the nest insistently, and Pepper got up to refill it for him.
"...he needs me," said Tony hoarsely.  He tried to shoulder past Happy, but Happy blocked him.  Tony felt a surge of anger at him.  Happy wasn't even an Alpha.  How dare he try to take what was rightfully Tony's.  Tony had won him, Tony had stood up to Hammer; Stan was
Hawley looked up to meet his gaze. "You will never have any contact with the Winter Soldier ever again. You were with him for six hours, totally unmonitored and that is absolutely unacceptable. Do you understand that?"
talk to me about omega rights again.  You’re not my pal, okay, Sparks?  I don’t owe you anything.  This is a purely professional relationship.  You’re my assistant.  End of story.  Speaking of assisting, I’m gonna need two white tigers for my birthday next week and a smoothie this afternoon.  Double shot of chlorophyll in that, got it?”
Clint brushed Steve's hair away from his face.  "Yeah. We're here for you, buddy." He looked up to Phil and nodded.
They ran along the beach. The sun was just rising over the sea, meaning rich oranges and yellows bled out into the sky. It was a calming sight after the night they'd just had. "You know all this stuff with Donner will blow over, right? One day he has to come to his senses," puffed Sam.
"Do you think I would be asking if I could help it?" Nick actually sounded frustrated or....unnerved.  "You were sent there as backup.  I was hoping I wouldn't have to call on your.  But our primary SHIELD agents were decommissioned due to circumstances outside of our control, and we need the two of you to step up to the plate.  It's a matter of international security.  Trust me, we wouldn't be calling on you as our first choice."
Joey's outfit was... about as ridiculous as Steve's. But at least when he'd woken up in this century they'd toned his new uniform down a little (sadly only a little) where as Joey looked about as bright and lively as his forties get-up had. Steve supposed he should be 'seeing himself' in Joey or something but right now the guy looked far too... laid back.  Steve had always thought a reluctant soldier was the best kind.  He took no joy in his work, even if he was good at it.
but it no longer burned in the same way it had before. He reached up tentatively to feel the skin around the bandage; it was no longer hot like it had been before.
Fury being shot was one of the few elements of Steve's story Tony didn't feel the need to compartmentalize.  He didn't know Fury well.  He certainly didn't wish him any ill will, but it wasn't close enough to home to bother him.  Steve being shot or hurt was another matter.  Tony was already coping with that in the only way he knew how: through denial and compartmentalization, laced with as much alcohol as he could physically drink.
After flipping all the main breakers and ensuring that he could get music to play from his phone, Tony decided to go find Steve.  He had long since discarded his suit jacket and he felt much more at home after playing around with tools for a few hours.
"Naw, he was at Philips before that," said Tony.  "We ate lunch together, then I came back from break and he was just... gone.  I mean, I heard he went to a camp or something, but I thought, like, y'know... some weird hippie commune or something."
of it was unclear.  He was on a winding road with two narrow lanes and not much traffic, and he stood off to the side, staring, shivering, convinced he was here for a reason, but unable to discern what that reason was.  It felt important, certainly, life-changing, even. But it was like a wisp of smoke; he couldn't possibly hope to grab it. He watched a car go past, and felt a small pang of some ancient memory, but it disappeared when the car rounded the bend in the road and disappeared.
"I'll probably just have to build up a resistance to it the old fashioned way. I'll talk to them about it." Steve said quietly. It had honestly been humiliating. He'd wanted to come back in fighting, prove HYDRA all wrong. Wrong for assuming he was an Alpha, wrong for assuming they could take him away, and wrong for assuming he wouldn't come after him. Steve had wanted to be appear
"You aren't shitty," said Steve.  "I was just angry when I said that because  sometimes you made me feel embarrassed and objectified.  And let's be honest, even in today's standards that's nothing new or unusual. I wouldn't have knelt if I hadn't wanted to. And I wouldn't have let you kiss me if I hadn't wanted you to, either," Steve pointed out quickly, nearly stumbling over his words. "Just...just read the report. Please. And don't do anything stupid, Tony. I didn't fight so hard for you to live for you to just hurt yourself."
me for not getting a good enough squirrel get-up?"  Tony smirked. He was clearly intent on taking the squirrel costume bit as far as he could.
The vague memory of marching back from the POW camp and seeing his neck, the skin virginal, unmarked, seemed like a bad dream now.  Perhaps that had never happened at all. ...hadn't they
He flung over the front door and nearly smashed into a florist, who was trying to figure out how to operate the keypad.  (Tony thought traditional bells were for suckers.)
Tony darted into the living room with a bowl of grapes, still sporting an incredibly obvious erection.
"I guess...I guess it is supposed to be fashionable to turn up late to a party," Steve murmured, his resolve totally non-existent at this point. Perhaps Tony was a 'bad influence' sometimes but Steve had a high sex drive (presumably because of the serum) and was almost always up for it.
Her shoulders slumped and the light faded.  "I can't. It's too strong. It's not regular glass, it's something else."
It wasn't just that.  It was the casualness with which they did it.  It was the smell of excitement on Steve. He wasn't happy, no.  But he wasn't remorseful, either.
He buried his face in the back of Steve's neck and inhaled deeply, trying to find a sense of calm.  "You're okay now.  You're safe.  You're with me."
"He's fine, Tony-- Tony, down!" commanded Pepper, snagging the collar of his shirt.  She shot Steve and Aria a look of apology. "That song gets him all wound up," she explained.  "...but we watched on his phone and you looks fantastic up there, Steve. And Tony's all done drinking now and he's going to go to the party-- I mean, function-- with you and
Gleason's brow furrowed.  "...it's very unusual for an omega to double-bond," he said.  "I've only seen it twice, actually. And in both cases, the Alphas were acers.  ...liked other Alphas," he explained to Sitwell, who looked confused.
Karpov smiled at him.  "Yes, that's right," he agreed, and he gave the soldier the rest of the Prolots as a reward.
Eventually they told him to just shut up and smoke some more.  He obediently smoked while Amber wiped off his face for him.  He still had Pearl's ball in his pocket and she was watching him with great interest.  He no longer felt afraid of her.
"It feels like my dad just walked in on us," Steve mumbled as he watched Fury disappear, his cheeks still a little inflamed with embarrassment. He cleared his throat and pushed away from the door.
Steve grabbed one with a small thanks and tucked it around Tony's shoulder. "You'll get cold if you don't get dry," he warned him.
It also proved a fear of Steve's however. That these omegas weren't really all coy and polite, they were
"It occurred to me something might be up, when your eyesight went and you said you were cold... so I checked up with the doctors. And really, it's quite remarkable. This has never happened before."
"What the heck's wrong with you?  Are you faking or something?" asked Tony.  Clearly, his gland had been cut out a while ago and already healed.
"Aaand for the record." Steve almost felt sheepish and set his menu down so he wouldn't feel tempted to hide behind it. "I've never actually been on a date before," he admitted. "So I don't quite know how this works. Aside from food and conversation...I guess it's a lot of firsts this week."
"You're a good omega, DeSoto.  I'm happy I won you. You're a good example to Steve and I'm learning so much from you."
"I'm not mad at you," Steve promised in a murmur and reached a hand up to run his fingers through Tony's hair gently. He kissed his cheek and then nuzzled against it. "I do care, but now how you think," he whispered in his ear. "It makes me angry, that someone took something from you that you didn't want to give."
This is the last chapter of smut n' fluff before Project 84.  Enjoy it while it lasts.  Warning: INSANELY graphic sex scenes, dirty talk, and general intimacy.  - T
Doctors muttered around him. "It would make sense," said a female doctor. "If the captain had gone into heat. The soldier's temperature is raised and even if he can't feel it anymore, he's..." she gestured at Bucky. Or the man that Bucky once was. "It would make sense," she repeated.
Steve had showered. Or rather, panic showered (because he really was gross). After all, he hadn't showered since his long car journey the day before. He was also conscious of the fact that he could potentially smell of Bucky. In the shower his mind wandered too; he thought about how Bucky ignored half the stuff he said, touched him without asking permission... his mind was stuck in the forties and he acted like it.
Tony made JARVIS pull up the suit diagnostics and monitored the energy use languidly.  The new reactor was monstrously efficient.  The old palladium-core ones had often needed swapped out after only a couple of hours in the suit.  After an hour of tearing across the surface of the ocean, the suit showed zero signs of slowing and the reactor showed zero signs of having been used up at all.  Tony felt a smug sense of satisfaction.  He was going to totally raise the bar at SHIELD; Steve was going to be so proud of him.  Other than the psych eval, he was going to have no trouble at all passing any of test they threw at him.
Tony didn't even hesitate.  "Yes," he said. The word was a growl, and a promise.  Of course he'd kill for his mate. Of course he'd destroy the other Alpha, leaving Steve pure again, his and his alone.
"Just came by to say hi."  He looked around the room. Obviously Pepper was doing her best to keep things in order, but there was a plate on the floor and an odd sock lying on an armchair.
"Do they think there's anyone here who isn't living in the past?" Steve asked, squeezing Tony's hand. The crowd was all made of the same make up. He'd quite like a drink himself, but maybe they wouldn't serve him one
Right. Tony was mad at him. He didn't like him. He didn't want him. Steve had betrayed his trust. All that screwed up stuff.
Steve winced. Pepper sounded pretty furious. He grimaced with a swallow and squeezed Tony's fingers. He didn't really feel like he should be here for this conversation- their relationship was old, it had history. Pepper resigning was maybe about a bit more than just the company, but Steve wouldn't say that out loud. He swallowed.
"...I think the Germans have a word for people who say thank-you after sex," blurted Tony.  He grinned down at Steve.  "You thank me like I did you a favor.  You know I kind of liked it too, right?  Like, uh, just a little bit, you know... I mean, it was pretty great... hey, wanna shower together?  After I pull out?  Your hair needs washed.  ...I don't know why I want to wash your hair, you're not a poodle, obviously, sorry...  sorry, I get really stupid after sex... no, yeah, we need a shower... and food... and I need a drink... does this feel good for you or not?  I don't know how it is on your end.  Lemme know if I can make this more comfortable for you.  I'm sorry.  I... I don't normally knot."  Tony glanced down.  "So circumcision wasn't a thing in the nineteen-seventeen, huh? ...cool, cool... I'm not gay, for the record... I know that sounds, uh, weird, because my dick happens to be stuffed into you... I just wanted to clarify, I'm not really into guys... I mean, I'm into
Tony moaned loudly when Steve tugged his hair, said his name.  How the fuck did Steve know he liked that?  It was like the two of them were psychic and knew exactly what the other one wanted and needed.  "That's right... take it in... good boy..." he panted, thrusting harder into him.  "You're all mine, Steve... this is all for you..."  He caught Steve's lips on his again, his tongue pushing into his mouth without any pretense.  Their tongues swirled together briefly before Tony pulled away, pressing their cheeks together.  "Oh my God... you're perfect... this is amazing," he moaned.  He was literally trying not to cry.  For Tony, sex was a biological function like eating; at times, it was a chore for him, something he did to kill time or maintain his reputation or whatever.  It had never been like this.  It had never been intimate or meaningful.  He was plowing Steve into the carpet; they were on the floor like animals, but that didn't matter, because they were meant for each other and they could have done it anywhere and it still would have felt magical.
Tony felt a whack on his shoulder, the suit vibrating around him; he set Steve down on the front steps of the Expo, but kept his hands on the other man's shoulders, as if terrified he might fall into pieces if Tony weren't holding him.
Steve was relieved when Tony appeared again but he also frowned when he realised he was limping. They were cleaning up Tony's face but it was obvious he wasn't putting any weight on one of his legs. "Tony." Steve curled an arm around him and squeezed a little and held onto Tony's hand with his other arm. "You need to let them look at your foot."
"Steve?  Does she have a nice memorial?" asked Tony quietly.  "We could get one now, if she doesn't. A headstone. You're not poor anymore, now."
"We'll talk about it later," said Tony, striding over and leaning down to kiss Steve's head briefly.  "Yeah, I'm gonna go down to the shop for a bit.  Just tinker, y'know."  He gave Steve's bare ass a pat before limping out the door.
Tony waited.  She provided no last name, and Tony was willing to bet JARVIS that she had not been born with that name.  It was an oddly strong name; perhaps she had given it to herself.
"Yes, yes, yes, it's a very anti-feminist outfit, but it is too sexy, and your unwillingness to wear it five Halloweens ago was embarrassing for both of us."
"No," said Donner.  Tony and Steve both looked over sharply.  "No, I've had four, but Giddy never let me keep them," he said.  "Is this one his?"
"Oh... Steve..." moaned Tony, reached out to his his hands on his hips.  He looked up, heavy-lidded, at his omega, and smiled.  "Ride it?" he suggested hopefully, writhing under Steve.  He could feel the strain of his knot against Steve's body, and the wetness of his body; his muscles were all taut with sexual tension.
"We only went to that conference because we were invited and we thought it would be funny," Steve said. "It wasn't something we planned. It was sprung upon us. And it was lot more... extreme in there than we had expected. So I guess we felt a need to get involved in a more extreme way."
For a split second Tony thought it was accidental, Steve slipping under the water. Then he felt Steve wrap his lips around his cock.  His whole body spasmed and he grabbed Steve's hair to yank him up.
. He could have done so much and all I can think about is, what if Bucky had told me I should stop trying to get enlisted?  And what if I had listened? Then I wouldn't even be here.  Bucky was a jerk sometimes but he always encouraged me, even when the things I was doing were impossible.  He always encouraged me.  But if he hadn't then I couldn't've-- I just can't--"
Tony was lost.  So the step-son was in a trio?  Also, what the fuck kind of name was Sunshine?  It sounded like a cheap stripper.
"There's plenty of good causes to die for," Steve breathed and finally pulled his hand away, expression imploring. "But not this. You might be willing to give up on yourself, but I'm not. And you're going to find that new element if I have to drag you through every old file and report of your father's. Because I won't sit down and take this. And the Tony Stark I thought I knew wouldn't, either."  Steve let out a shuddering breath.  "You're better than this."
Steve looked back out across the field, watching Natasha duck away from one of Cooper's snowballs. "That's fair," he whispered. "I just, I--"
JARVIS wasn't programmed to sigh but he didn't need to be; he dialed the phone for Tony.  Tony held his breath, listening intently to the other line ringing, desperate for more of Steve's voice.  He knew he was torturing himself but maybe he didn't care. Maybe he even deserved it, letting himself fall so hard, like an idiot.  Ever since he was around to experience Steve's heat, he'd been obsessed with him.  Tony wondered what his father would have thought about Tony falling for the omega Howard had eagerly appointed to be the captain of the Avengers, the same omega he'd pumped full of serum, creating an unnaturally strong, agile, powerful omega.  Would he think it was pathetic?  Funny?  Tragic?  Ironic?  Tony felt it was all of those things, and more.
"Happy, even a stopped clock is right twice a day.  They say everyone's a closeted omega. They got a couple right but that's like shooting an automatic rifle randomly into a forest, getting a deer, and saying you're a great hunter.  I'm telling you, those rags are
"There is nothing comfortable about you Tony," Steve said, although his tone wasn't critical...but Stark had this way of surprising him. Keeping him on his feet. He didn't know quite how to describe it. But Steve honestly quite liked being dragged out of his comfort zone now and then.
He watched Steve pick at the bacon.  He was pretty sure neither of them would ever work for SHIELD again, unless there was a total catastrophe of the meteor-heading-toward-Earth variety.  Once they were done meeting with lawyers, ambassadors, and the media, their schedule would open up in a way it hadn't for a long time. Steve would probably be on the press junket for a long time, and Tony would be able to go back to doing his solo Iron Man gig, playing with his suits and blasting baddies when he felt like it.
safety!  You don't think you owe the public anything?  Then back the hell out of this omega rights thing you're involved in, because that's a
"Well... pick a notebook.  Let's get started," he mumbled hoarsely, pulling the lid off of one of the boxes and peering inside.
Least Tony could look at him right now. That was a bonus. Last night they'd both struggled with any eye contact of any kind.
"Your dog tags are with a woman named Peggy Carter. I left everything important with  her," Steve said gently. Everything important being the dogtags, sketchbooks and a few odd items of clothing. His Captain America gear he'd left at Sam's house. Just in case anything had happened him, it was a silent offer for the other to take up the name. Steve couldn't think of anyone else better suited to it. He wondered if Sam had mentioned that to the others. "Your name is James Buchanan Barnes. I call you Bucky."
Hesitantly, the soldier took the cup.  He hadn't eaten for at least a day and he was hungry.  He sipped the coffee; it was rich and warm. The twins seemed to be having fun in the hotel room; Karpov seemed enraged that he'd ended up stuck with them.  He didn't mind. The girl scared him, but the omega was interesting. The way he was lying on his front, his shaggy blond hair... it hit some chord in his mind, something so close yet also just out of reach.  Someone else he'd known, an omega, used to lie like that, on his front.
In a way, Tony thought, it was a fitting penance.  He'd been such a dick in the past to omegas and women.  Not intentionally, but...
"...thank you, Tony," said Tiberius quietly.  "I appreciate that. ...you know what they say, charity starts at home.  You want to treat omegas well?" He nodded to Steve. "Start with this one."
"Hey," Steve's voice was soft and his touch magnetic as he curled Tony up in his arms. "Sitwell, can you piss off this? Please?"
"--demanding equal treatment, but then they want safe spaces, they want special considerations, and my question is,
Steve was perched on the edge of his desk chair, a pencil in his hand, staring unabashedly at him.  He flushed when Tony looked at him.
"Congratulations, Donnie.  A healthy little girl. ...beta, I think.  Or not presenting, yet, at least."
Everyone woke around half four in the morning. They had to be ready in time. It felt weird to be in his SHIELD gear again but Steve figured this situation was as close as he was ever going to get to actually needing it on. He just had the main suit on, no gloves or helmet or anything. Steve didn't want to look like he was actually ready for a real life fight.  But he also knew how the uniform could motivate and inspire people.
Tony checked himself in the mirror, adjusting his hair a little.  "That's great.  ...seriously, I've felt kind of like shit all day.  Guilty, I guess.  You think we should've waited for him?"
He took the syringes and threw them against the glass. They shattered and fell to the floor in pieces. Steve noted, with disappointment, that the plastic was not sharp enough to be used as a weapon.  One of the scientists sighed and reached into her bag to get out more; they'd evidently anticipated this particular issue.
He examined his face in the mirror.  His hair had gotten long but no one had offered to cut it for him.  They'd shaved him, recently, but some stubble was starting to show.  He ran his right hand over his chin and jaw thoughtfully.  He couldn't sleep.  No one had instructed him to do anything in particular.  While he was often restless, he was usually capable of just sitting and waiting.  But the headache he was nursing had made it impossible, and he felt a terrible sense of foreboding, too, almost panic, that wouldn't let him hold still.
Of course, he hadn't actually ever gotten to see Bucky.  Bucky had tormented his mind, tormented Steve's. Steve had seen Bucky once when Tony wasn't there.  But, so far, Tony had never gotten to see his competition, to smell him, size him up. Not that it was necessary.  Tony was sure that Bucky would be more dominant than him. The truth is, Tony was not an especially aggressive Alpha and he rarely met Alphas submissive to him.
"But if you find him that could still happen," Clint pointed out. "SHIELD would want to be involved and SHIELD isn't clean. And they might try and charge him, for all the shits he's done...whether it's really his fault or not. Yemen made them look bad. Imagine how great it would be for them to be able to say they caught the guy who force bonded Cap."
"Do... do you think we could make it up onto the sofa or we're stuck here on the floor for half an hour?" Steve asked, eyes half drooping shut.
.  (The man was an Alpha and Steve found it comical that, since he'd come out about his status, people were constantly offering to help him with things.  As if being an omega negated his super soldier strength.)
"He was... trying to take me back, or take me away, I guess. The problem is, you let your Alpha treat you like an object once, it never stops. I let my first Alpha get away with so much. The way he treated me wasn't okay. And he's come back and assumed he can do the same. Because... because I guess that's how we were raised.  But that's not acceptable anymore.  Not in this century.  The problem is, if you're bought by an Alpha...that's already setting a very dangerous precedent. I met an omega last night whose been shot by his Alpha before. His Alpha makes him fight other omegas for entertainment. But then I found out that he doesn't even
Tony's stomach turned. "For once, Jarv, I don't think I'm in the doghouse with her," replied Tony.  Normally, he would find it amusing that JARVIS assumed he owed Pepper an apology. But he was more interested in who was asking for Steve's forgiveness.  He was positive that those tulips weren't for him.
“Well, he’s a pig, but he’s a smart pig.  If he does anything like that again, I’m out,” said Pepper simply.  “He knows I don’t bluff.”
He stepped outside of the edge of the camp. His hands were shaking. This was a strange reminder that Steve couldn't save them all, especially not from themselves.
"It wasn't real. It couldn't have been," Steve agreed with a sense of finality, shaking his head to himself. He finally looked up and met Tony's gaze. "Sorry, I just- bad morning." He tried for a smile but it didn't meet his eyes. "I think I'm gonna run for a while, is that okay?"
Pepper sat Steve down on a stool at the counter and began rummaging through Tony's fridge while Sam texted.
Steve could tell Tony wasn't yet convinced. He sighed. He pressed a kiss to his cheek and then ducked his head down to whisper in his ear. "Don't go beat up the stupid dog man and I'll make it worth your while, yeah?"
Steve looked up and their eyes met.  Tony tried to stare blankly.  Not to look hurt, or scared, or angry, even though he was all of those things.
"Asshole!" Steve made a noise of anger and threw his phone against the wall. It didn't break. Small mercies.
He reached up to his chest and grabbed the arc reactor.  He twisted and pulled; the metal scraped; the device was heavy and warm in his hands.
He didn't trust himself to speak (the scream lodging in his throat was threatening to come out at any moment) so he texted Pepper, his hands still shaking violently; he went slowly, very slowly, pressing in every letter deliberate.
Tony was immediately impressed.  "You made that?" Tony had a natural reverence toward anyone who worked with metal.
"I need a drink.  C'mon, let's check out the bar... maybe we can get some more info on that auction.. they said it was in the same room, right?  Here, you take the program... I feel like I'm on drugs..." said Tony, reaching up to aggressively scratch at the back of his neck.  He couldn't wait to take the collar off. Equality aside, he could practically feel his own hackles digging into his skin. He was starting to regret coming here.  Even the friendly people, the "allies," like John and Eric, made his skin crawl. "...do you think... do you think Joan and Maria are okay? They seemed happy... can we find a way to talk to Piper?  ...why's all the omegas got such weird names? Wasn't Donner a reindeer?" asked Tony. Come to think of it, lots of omegas had weird names, like Kitty and Sunshine. Were those their actual names or...?
The line was silence for a moment while Tony thought fondly of spending a lazy day with Steve, holed up in the apartment.
His heart was beating faster in his chest. Steve needed to focus, but Bucky was here, he was alive, he was okay, he was--
"Oh." Steve blinked. No one had actually directly asked him about it before. "Tony's mark is there now, like
"I think you've bothered Captain America enough for one day," Jed said, appearing by Steve's side and patting his shoulder.
They strode down the hall together, passing two guards, and Steve looked down.  Tony felt his pang of surprise.
Tony opened his mouth to make some sarcastic remark.  But his wit failed him; maybe it was Steve's sincerity.
"F-fuck, sorry--" gasped Tony, reaching down to jack himself off.  He lay his head on Steve's stomach, staring greedily at the flaccid penis lying across his stomach.  "Fuck these heats-- fuck 'em-- let me cum on your face--" He groaned in frustration. He hated the feeling of not being in control, of being such a sad, gooey, organic, sex-driven mess.  Tony had always had sex on his own terms and also felt superior in his intelligence.
Steve had gotten lost in his own head; he busied himself with the coffee while DeSoto and Tony talked.  As silence spooled out, he poured himself a warm-up and walked over to them.  DeSoto didn't even look up at him, his attention remaining fixed on Tony. It was both rude and unsettling.
Steve reached out to touch his chest.  Tony's entire body stiffened and Tony's pulse and breathing both jumped.
His hands were fastened with some kind of shackles behind in his back. Even if the knife was still under his sleeve, he had no way of getting to it. His hands were fixed a good five inches apart. It was uncomfortable. They hadn't fastened his legs together; with his ankle they needn't have bothered.  It was possibly broken, definitely sprained.
"Hey!" said Tony, slightly offended.  He didn't consider himself to be old.  "I'm only.... thirty mumble.  Hey, look, my old man didn't have me until he was in his fifties.  And Steve's not young, he's ninety-three.  ...but I mean, yeah, no, he should focus on his career, though."  Tony was all too aware of the slight note of alarm in his voice.  He didn't want kids.  He'd never wanted kids.  Never planned for them.  He was more upset that Steve had been pregnant at all than that they'd miscarried.  He couldn't wrap his brain around it.  They'd taken a test, hadn't they?  And Steve... Steve was supposed to be infertile, wasn't he?  And Tony had never had this problem before... as far as he knew, anyway.
It was all good news, but Steve couldn't appreciate it.  The conversation with DeSoto had left him feeling depressed.
He knew they weren't allowed in the army without suppressants, which made sense to him; this was one reason he'd never put two and two together that Steve Rogers, omega assistant, was Captain America.  In modern times, there had been plenty of stories of omegas hopping themselves up on suppressants and joining anyway as honorary betas, but in Steve's time, suppressants weren't available yet.  According to the Captain America legend, Steve Rogers had been a patriot who had tried to sign up five or six times, but was too sick.  Now, Tony realized, that wasn't it.  He hadn't been allowed to sign up because he was an omega.
He knocked once before stepping into the workshop, tentatively sticking his head through. "Tony?" He called out. "I brought you food."
If that ever got out, it would be a vicious scandal and probably ruin both of them.  Tony decided it was best for everyone to just pretend it didn't exist and never, ever mention it again.
Steve blinked and he was stepping forward towards him, getting too close before he stopped himself. He felt overwhelmed with emotion. With relief. He could hardly breathe.
Steve nodded, his cheeks burning a little as he watched her go. He cleared his throat as the door slipped shut, letting his hand fall down to take Tony's in his.  He moved to tug Tony upstairs. He wasn't in a rush to get clean but he was quite alright with Tony showering with him.
He needs to ask the scientists if there’s any way to suppress his heat. He can’t be with anyone ever again. And if there’s not a way to suppress it, he knows one way. One sure fire way to ensure he’ll never go into heat again.
“Is there a chance that he tried to throw you off while you were implanting it? That even though you may have succeeded, Ultron threw virtual dead ends your way.”
“Coming in,” Natasha said, and Steve heard the clear zip through the air of a stinger being thrown. It hit Bucky’s arm but did little to stop him. He only held on through the electrical shock as it was carried to the armor. Tony screamed out, but the suit flared with a whirl of energy. Before Steve could tell her to stop, Natasha hurtled another stinger and it hit Tony square on the chest.
He stumbles but manages to bring her over to the elevator with Tony trailing behind them. “This floor is empty, but the two upper floors have some good options. Don’t look at the one in section Delta-3. He’s not suitable and is scheduled to be put down.” In a conspiratorial whisper, he adds, “Not even for a blood pledge. He’s considered dead already.”
He checks the time on the crappy motel clock by the side of the bed. It’s been over an hour since he talked with Clint.  He only has a few miles to go to get to the place where Steve was going to meet with the guy – he figures it must have taken Steve a while to get out here. It’s not as if he has a car; he has to rely on public transportation as far as Tony knows. He closes the motel door and then checks in his trunk again for all of his supplies. This is going to get nasty pretty fast. He knows that much.
Wong completed his warning. “If it fails one of two things will happen. He pulls back his soul from all of you and the pack dissolves. Or.” Wong cleared his throat and then said, “Or he donates his soul pieces to each of you and he passes.”
Tony cups his hand to Steve’s jaw. “I'm not half as good at—at anything as I am when I'm doing it next to you.”
Steve doesn’t answer. They eat and listen to the music when Natasha decides to play the piano. It’s tinny and needs to be tuned, but the night is fun and the beer is plentiful. For once he forgets about his troubles and lets the warm wash of people smiling flood over him. Sam seems to fit in well, and that’s a relief. He worried about how the town might not accept a former slave to fill in for him while he’s gone.
Now, Tony knows full well that Captain America is a contortionist since he can squeeze that whole 6’2” frame and fold it up to hide behind a small circular disc. But even he can’t break that many laws of physics.
It was all a foreign concept to Tony. He let the tears come but only because no one saw them. In the end, he knew he had only one course of action, only one way to deal with the universe’s cruel trick.
The screen changes to Christine Everhart again. She’s smiling at the camera. “Since his parents died, Tony Stark has transformed Stark Industries from a warmongering company to a center of innovation. All of us have benefited from Stark phones to Stark computer processors, to the newest invention of virtual reality goggles made for industry. Plus, the newest advances in nanotechnology and artificial intelligence from Stark Industries promise to change the world. But what of Tony Stark? We’ve only just begun to scratch the surface of this playboy who is more a recluse than a party animal. He puts on a good show when he’s controlling the deck, but who is Tony Stark really?
“Oh, you think he controls the weather now?” Tony smiles and goes to Friday’s reins, he unties them.
Steve nods. “Yes, Tony. Yes, oh God, yes.” He’s about to nuzzle into the crown of Tony’s head again but the distinct stench of burning milk fills the air. “Oh shit!” Steve rushes to the stovetop to turn off the pot. He sniffles. “It’s ruined.”
“A whore.” Steve swallows back the acid in his throat and tries to fight back the tears. What would Bucky think of him. Crying for so many reasons.
“Yeah, I will.” He disconnects with another tap and then the timer rings. Using tongs, he pulls out the toys and then sets them to dry on a clean surface. While they dry, he thinks about the workshop. It wouldn’t hurt just to take a peek.
The image is so cruel, so dastardly, that Tony barely makes it to the bathroom in his workshop before he loses what little lunch he’s eaten. He turns on the faucets and splashes cold water on his face and in his mouth. Letting his face drip as he clutches the rim of the sink, he asks, “How long until the fabrication is done?”
Swiftly, Tony gathered Steve up into his arms even as his trembling mate tried to get onto his own feet. He protested, “I can walk.”
“We can’t get out without the exit Door.” Steve leans against the wall of the passageway. The pursuit, the chase, the mission all weighs too heavily on his shoulders. “Why can’t he just kill us where we stand?”
Steve swallows thickly and pours the soup into one small tin cup and moves it over to Tony. Steve drinks right from the pot. “Thank you, Tony. That means a lot.”
“Back in the day, when I was a lot younger. A lot younger. I had a trainer back after they moved me from the children’s wing of the KGB to the adult wing. I was there for a while and they got me a trainer because I excelled. I never saw his face – you have to understand Steve. He was never allowed to unmask, not completely.”
He knows this is a sin, he’s sinned before with his first charge. He’s a fallen angel and his life is breaking in the mortal world. Bonds between humans and angels are frowned upon, are discouraged. He cannot stop himself.
“Don’t leave me,” Tony said. “I know things are different now. I know you need your space but stay with me.”
But yet, Yinsen wants him to feel, to care, to make a difference. He doesn't think it is possible. Everything and everyone seems so faraway. He's in the pit and he is letting it slowly and inexplicably turn him to ice.
"See?  No problem," said Tony enthusiastically.  "Sounds like a walk in the park.  Now can I please go back to my honeymoon?  I only get to do this once, you know."  He leaned forward to nuzzle Steve's jaw.
"SHIELD?" repeated Pepper.  The name had rung a bell when Steve had said it earlier; it suddenly clicked where she'd heard that before.  "Ah.  One of Coulson's people.  I always did like him.  Wait, did you say
Riley's words washed over Tony like water and he was suddenly aware that he was covered in sweat. So much sweat he might as well have been plunged into a swimming pool.  His fingers were wrinkled with it.  His mouth was dry as if it had been stuffed with cotton all night.  He tried to swallow, but his throat was like sand.  Had he had a panic attack in his sleep?  He felt terrified and he didn't know why.
"So glad you're back.  So glad," murmured Tony, tracing Steve's lips with a finger.  They were so pink and plump and soft. He leaned down to kiss them.  "Never gonna let you go again... I swear... love you so much..." He kissed Steve's throat, pressing himself a little more insistently between Steve's legs.
The song was instantly recognizable to Steve, though the DJ had sped it up and put a bass beat to it to jazz it up a bit.
to," Steve disagreed and then realised how stupid that had sounded. But he genuinely believed that if he hadn't been sent into preheat, and that if Bucky had been his own mind, that he wouldn't have done it. Sometimes Steve wondered if Bucky had asked before he...
He hadn't felt this raw, this woken, for a long, long time.  Longer than he could possibly remember. He felt like he was just waking from a terrible dream and everything was shockingly clear, so much clearer than the uncanny fuzziness of the dream.
Steve was already dragging Tony down the long hallways of the school, swarming with confused students and stern police officers and grim-faced volunteers and indignant staff.  Jed passed with a trail of young girls behind her. One of them looked no older than seven. Jesus.
"Oh, look!  PEGASUS: Potential Energy Group, Alternate Sources, United States!" exclaimed Tony with delight.  "Are you guys trying to solve the energy crisis?  Is that it?"
Fury looked unfazed, but he pushed off the counter.  Tony could feel himself getting defensive, his muscles tensing.  His earlier desire to beat someone up to demonstrate his strength to Steve was coming to the surface again.
"Hey.  Hey, it's okay, we're coming for him," said Clint, putting an arm around him.  (A pointless gesture, since Tony couldn't feel it in the suit; aside from the helmet he was in full combat gear.)  "Steve's tough. He's gonna be okay."
"After our honeymoon is over we'll work out that charity," Steve said. "But like you said- this time is for each other. And I know what's going on outside doesn't make that the easiest thing right now but...but I think we should try. This time is about each other and assholes like Vanko and Hammer won't take that from us, okay?"
me," hissed Tony, stepping forward again.  Steve wasn't backing down, was still maintaining eye contact.  "You didn't
"Aww... sorry everyone, sorry... Stan's right, the party's over... all good things must come to an end..." said Tony in the mic, as the crowd protested.  "No, I'm sorry, he's right, this party's over... I've been over it for like, an hour..."  He flashed a grin.  "...but the
in the first week. It was no real secret that Captain America was having sex right now but that didn't mean the public wanted to think about it, or be given proof of it. The media turmoil if Steve was probably just recorded
As Judy had mentioned, Tony was there, and he was basking in two newfound pieces of fortune.  First, after getting bailed out (a quick, aggressive phone call to Pepper and the help of the legal team at Stark Industries had had him in and out in less than a couple of hours), Tony had found a convenience store in Scottsboro, and stocked up on liquor.  Now happily buzzed, he was feeling much better. Secondly, he had finally found his own fanbase. To the "converted" Alphas, Tony was an excellent role model. He was a demanding Alpha and, because they weren't really Alphas, he was the automatically most dominant one.  He sat with a cluster of teenage boys, talking grandly about all the missiles he had designed ("...flattened a whole mountain!").
"Yes. I get that." Steve breathed. Jesus. Howard sounded like a bad father. Natasha had laughed at his face when she'd told Steve he'd had a son because that news alone had been shocking. Howard with a child... the image wouldn't sit in Steve's mind. "When we sat there with Gideon you were amazing. And your idea for the conference was amazing too. You're not just 'trying' Tony; you're good at this and I know that when I go to meet those omega lawyers tomorrow they're not going to think less of me for being with an Alpha like you. Quite the opposite."
"No.  Why would you ask me to do that?" he asked.  He could think of at least three good reasons not to kill the blond.  First, because clearly he was important to HYDRA. He would no more kill this man than he would run a car off a cliff or pitch a perfectly good M-24 into a river.  Second, he hadn't been ordered to and it was a pointless waste of energy to do anything he wasn't ordered to. Third, he liked the blond. The blond smelled absolutely tantalizing.  Being in the same room as him was enjoyable even though the floor was hard and cold.
"Tony, I got this.  I'm still the liaison for Stark Industries.  And SHIELD is handling Steve.  You need to take it easy."
"No-- he can feel-- it's fine."  Tony was staring at the ground, trying to get ahold of himself.  He didn't want to have a panic attack in front of Steve's crew, and he didn't want to have one here, on the sidewalk outside in the middle of downtown LA.  It was a clear day and Tony was struggling to orient himself. Skyscrapers. Blue skies. He was in a city, outside, not in a desert, underground. He was okay.
The man on the phone was short, balding, and wore glasses.  He was wearing a white coat with a small, brown spot on the lower right corner that he recognized instantly as dried blood.  He couldn't stop staring at it.  His vision was focused but he had the most terrible, harsh pain behind one of his eyes and his whole mouse felt like it was on fire.
Tiberius ghosted out of the room, and Tony rolled over to reach for some water and a cereal bar.  Steve was shivering next to him, asleep. Tony wolfed down the food and then snuggled up against his mate, stroking his head.  He felt back asleep within moments, his body exhausted beyond all reason, and when he woke up later, he didn't remember the brief exchange with Tiberius at all.
Tony stepped out in a towel and Steve watched as a bead of water escaped from his hair and slipped over the bump of his collar bone and down his chest. His hands itched to draw for a brief moment.
"Absolutely apeshit!" said Tony with glee.  "And we've only got two and a half weeks to set it up, so Pepper, I'm really going to need you to bring your A-game."  His attention turned to Steve; he looked at him with sheep eyes, one hand resting in the small of Steve's back.  Steve's birthday was Tony's current new top priority, tied with hacking the hell out of SHIELD and researching the mysterious tesseract situation.  But his mate's birthday was a big deal.  Definitely on par with mysterious government black sites and the secret sources of power they contained.
"Oh, what, I can just be his silver medal, huh?  Be his side Alpha?" said Tony.  He snarled at Rhodey weakly, unable to believe his old friend was insulting him like this.
Once in the lobby, Steve took the stairwell.  He lived on the seventeenth floor, but the stairs never winded him and he found climbing them to be a good way to burn off some energy and have some quiet time to think.  He took the steps two at a time and then he was home. Inside his safe and secure apartment.  It was small, but stylish; after all, SHIELD had paid for it. But above all else it was homely. The kitchen was tucked away in a broken off corner from the living room, and all of the furniture was shaded in soft creams and a duck-egg blue. His sofa was large compared to the TV, which was small; the bookcase was swamped with literature he was starting to think he'd never quite catch up on. His bedroom had huge windows which left it full of light; the bed was piled high with blankets- more than he needed, really.  But Steve had always hated the cold.  Or even the idea of it.
It was sort of funny, to Tony, that for all of the historical Alpha posturing about Alphas being somehow
Tony nodded slowly, wearily.  He glanced up at the heart monitor, then at Steve, then reached out and set his hand on the bed, an offer but not a demand.
He was having trouble forming coherent words, or thoughts.  Steve was so sinfully good at this. And this was all for him.  This was something only they shared; Steve and Bucky had never gotten past first base, as far as Tony was aware.
Ian started telling a story about a time when Kerry got an olive stuck up her nose and they almost had to call an ambulance. The Alpha looked mildly annoyed but her lips still twitches up in the hint of a smile when the story made Steve laugh. Eventually George had gotten the damn thing out with a pair of chopsticks from take-out the night before.
Tony winced.  "Okay, okay, okay..."  He shoved a few fingers into Steve and reached around to grasp his erection.  "You can cum and then you gotta do this interview... blah blah blah, omega rights. Remember?"
"Tell Fury I'll call him back later," Steve instructed JARVIS as he stood, not letting go of Tony's hand once he was on his feet. He was still a little shaky on his feet but he wasn't trembling anymore.  He leaned his forehead against Tony's for a minute and let his eyes slip shut, overwhelmed with gratitude for how well his Alpha had dealt with all that.
Steve was already showered and dressed. He wore dark jeans a casual white shirt. He looked presentable, but not quite the PA he had been.
He reached out and threaded their hands together happily.  The touch was electric. The asset couldn't stop smiling; he had wanted, so badly, to touch this omega, and now he was.  It was everything he had imagined. He was filled with so many wonderful emotions that he felt like he could burst.
Tony couldn't finish.  He crammed his face back into Steve's chest.  He wanted to apologize and ask for forgiveness.  Was this level of guilt normal? It couldn't be... this couldn't be
He stood up, shrugging away Tony's hand. "I need a minute," he choked out, and then he ran up the steps and stepped out onto the pool terrace to get fresh air.
"I think I can cope with an old WWII place Tony," Steve said with a fond sort of smile. "I don't think I'll get any flashbacks from old rooms with tables and maps in them. If anything, I'd get PTSD from boredom. They'd make me sit through so many meetings... God, it damn near killed me some days, I swear."
"You called us.  We came. Surely you're happy with the way this has all turned out?" said Karpov.  "It's what you wanted. To assume your rightful place in the world, as an omega." He gave Steve a vicious little grin.
not as my PA, so I don't think it was out of line to ask!"  Tony squirmed over to press himself closer to Steve, and rested his head on Steve's shoulder.
His words had zero effect and were given no time to have one; the door burst open and five people walked in.  One of them was Fury.  The other was Coulson.
He popped a strawberry into his mouth and then dusted his hands off on his suit.  He was dressed casually, probably because Pepper wasn't here to tie his tie for him.  She was caught up in meetings all week. Tony had opted for a pair of dark jeans and a button-up shirt; he'd left the top buttons open and rolled up the sleeves, the result being a sort of sleek grunge that suited him well.  The arc reactor was peeking out, but Tony didn't seem to care.
He woke as the movie credits dragged down the screen and blinked slowly. He rubbed a hand over his face. "Mph," he mumbled and then turned his head to look up at Tony. "Sorry. I meant to watch it. Honestly," he mumbled, smiling a little sleepily as he rested his chin on Tony's chest. "I guess I was more tired than I realized, I'm not used to so much...exercise," he said, obviously meaning something else entirely as he raised a brow at Tony, the manner of the gesture playful.
"We've been drivin' for hours.  Can't we take a break?" Bucky was trying not to be difficult, but he was sick of sitting in the car.  More than anything in the world, he wanted to find a bed and lay down in it with Steve in his arms and kiss him like they used to before the war.  "It's gettin' late and we still haven't eaten. C'mon, let's find a nice restaurant. Let me take you out on a date, Steve. It's been ages. You need to unwind.  What'd you say?" Bucky was hoping Steve would see the sense in what Bucky was saying. They couldn't just drive forever. Did Steve even know where he was going? For once, Bucky was thinking not about the present, but the future.  For once, he cared about where he was going.
"Off the record," echoed Maria.  "...Phil, do you want to do the honors?"  She handed him a new tracking bracelet.
"He didn't say anything significant. Just that I was his. That he was...coming, or something? It's hard to get actual words and not just meanings."
"Would you mind if I questioned your assistant, at least?" asked Coulson, staring pointedly at Steve.
"It's weird," Steve murmured, falling back into the sheets. "I've never met something that could hold me down before..."
"He touched my neck. He wouldn't stop touching my neck. And then he started pressing on the gland. I could barely speak properly at the time. He kept asking me to kneel for him, wanted me to- me to say he was my Alpha. It's like this sick power fantasy of his.  And then he pulled me up so I was kneeling and I couldn't f-fight back.  I wanted to.  But I couldn't move. He put my head on his knee and he wouldn't stop pressing on the gland behind my ear. It almost hurt."
"  He looked down, voice softening at the mention of Trickshot.  "Tricky was his first omega. He bought Tricky from some guy but Tricky was always trying to run away.  He was always fighting and stuff. He wasn't ever grateful even though my Alpha gave him everything. He complained all the time, didn't like him drinking, ran away every chance he got.  That's why he got me, originally, to try to keep Tricky in line. ...ha! That was a joke. Tricky was a better fighter than I ever was. And Tricky just didn't want to settle down. He had a brother that he got separated from and wanted to go find him.  Finally, 'bout two or three years ago, Alpha sold him off. Said he wasn't worth the trouble. Said he had littermate syndrome and wouldn't care about anything except going and finding his brother. Me, I'm an only child, so my Alpha never had to worry about that at all."  He traced mindless patterns into the carpet with one finger. "...the truth is, I liked Tricky. He was good company. When we weren't fighting, he was almost like a friend. He taught me sign language and sometimes we'd sign to each other at night so Alpha couldn't overhear us.  I was sad when he got let go but it's better for me. Now our bond's just us, and Tricky can't get me in trouble anymore. But I hope Tricky got a good Alpha."
much better after he peed. He sighed in relief and slump back down, his arm brushing against Bucky's metal one. Now it was just a waiting game, to see if the kiss had actually done anything. Maybe they wouldn't come...but maybe they would. Steve didn't want to be kept here, bred, studied, an unwilling pawn in HYDRA's game.  When he'd said before that he would rather die, he was serious... but he really didn't want it to come to that.
"Great.  Perfect," said Tony, who was pacing a little.  Steve's furious misery was palpable and Tony wanted to cry, not because he really wanted to cry, but because his mate was probably outside crying.  "Should I go after him? When he said he needed a minute, did that include me?"
Tony had never been denied money before.  His mind was speeding through ideas.  Could he buy omegas on a credit card?  Write a check?  Surely just being Tony Stark meant he didn't need to have the cash in hand right away... right?
"We're gonna be home soon, Steve, just a couple of hours, okay?  You're gonna be find," murmured Tony, holding him. This, at least, was the one thing he
They hailed a cab to take them back to the Langham.  Even though it was late, there were lots of couples strolling through Hyde Park.  Tony looked out at them and it occurred to him that he and Steve were now one of those couples.  It was odd, to Tony, to think of himself as a bonded man. He had always enjoyed being a bachelor, bouncing from floozy to floozy.  He hadn't touched a woman in a year.
Tony was yanking Steve toward the door, intent on getting out before things got violent.  And they really seemed ready to get violent. The Alphas in the room were pissed off, they smelt of aggression, reeked of self-righteous dominance, and most of them had been drinking.
The Winter Soldier stared down the barrel of the gun.  People threatened him with death all the time and he wasn't the slightest bit scared by that.  However, if she missed and hit the blond, then he would get in trouble.  They'd been very clear that they wanted the blond alive.  How good of a shot was she?  She was holding the gun in a way that indicated she probably wouldn't miss, so he didn't let go.
Tony lifted out a gun with a silencer, examining it closely.  "...I'll be damned. This is from the Freedom line," said Tony, sounding flattered and disgusted.  The Freedom line had been commercially available for barely over a hundred days before Tony had halted all production.  The few weapons that had been sold were collectibles of the highest caliber, only used in elite teams; the United States only had enough to give out to the SEAL teams and even then, the SEALs sometimes fought over them.  "This is a Mediator II," said Tony, turning it over. "This is one of the best goddamn guns I ever-- oo." Tony's love of tech was quickly overriding his misgivings about getting Shanghaied into this mission. There were dark clothes and night vision goggles and weapons of every imaginable sort.  "It's like Natasha sent us a care package," joked Tony as he pulled on a dark jacket and a black cap.
A few people in the audience were grinning and tittering.  Richard's energy was infectious and Tony begrudgingly had to admit, he liked his style.  Despite the beard and glasses, Richard was clearly younger than he appeared. Probably no more than ten years older than Tony, actually.
Before Steve could comment further, there was a crash and Tony bounded down the stairs in a panic, knocking over several orchids, naked.
Tony heard a splash and cracked open one lazy eye.  Steve was on the side of the pool, arms folded on the deck, cheek on the ground, staring off into the distance.
The soldier stared up; the omega's sharp blue eyes stared down.  His target, the blond, was mere feet from him!  If he was fast enough, he could grab him.  But he wasn't fast enough.  The blond was faster, he knew that already.  He continued to stare at him.  He'd never met anyone like this before.  He was incredible.  And an omega.  There was a strange feeling inside him.  It wasn't frustration (like when he missed a shot) or elation (like when he hit a target).  It was in his stomach and throat and, yes, maybe a little bit between his legs.  ...fear, maybe?  Was this what fear felt like?  Karpov had once told him that fear was probably the most powerful and primal emotion in the whole world.  But he couldn't feel fear.  And if this was fear, he was confused, because he sort of liked it.
When Tony had walked into the office, he had immediately felt underwhelmed.  His mind had conjured up images of dark laboratories and secret industrial plants.  This place looked a bit like a consulting firm.
Tony rolled onto his side to throw his other arm around Steve, to hold him.  He closed his eyes and tried to remind himself that mood swings were normal right now, that he was exhausted and over-emotional and that's why this was coming up again.  He was shaking a little.
"The Society is getting flooded with calls from people who want to help support you," said Jeff.  "It's all very positive, people are really responding to... well, the sincerity, I guess, it was very sincere--"
Malick's hackles rose and he excused the two of them, hooking his fingers into Donner's collar and yanking him away.  Donner cast a regretful look over his shoulder at Steve.
"We're glad to have you here, Tony.  Today, I think Steph wanted to talk a bit about some work troubles she and Trevor were going through... before we start, does anyone have any new business to get off their chest?"
Steve reached for the shampoo, lathering it up in his hair and laughing softly when he blopped some of the soap of Tony's nose.
Tony grabbed another martini and sipped it awkwardly, trying not to get any blood in it.  "Banksy, you should play some old-timey music for me and Steve to dance to."
"I don't see what we're supposed to do once they bring him to us.  We already have the isolated compound from the '86 mission. What more do they want?" asked the older of the two men, leg jiggling, tapping his pencil on his knee.
The days following the mission were nerve-wracking for Tony.  He kept waiting for a call from SHIELD or, worse, a personal visit from Fury, who had a habit of popping up in his life like some sort of ominous gopher.  But that call never came and eventually Tony was forced to conclude that either they didn't care about the fiasco or, more likely, the report given by Natasha had smoothed the truth over a little.
"Maybe I shouldn't go on TV until after this conference then," Steve said tentatively. "They'd ask me to explain everything and I don't want to ruin the surprise."
"Well, if you want to go to the AU conference, you don't have a choice," said Pepper.  She reached out to tap the stack of papers with her nail. "Start signing."
Pierce's comment had hit Tony hard.  He didn't really notice the age difference.  He'd only been forty for a few months but he didn't feel old.  But could he take on a twenty-something man with army training?  Admittedly, probably not.
Tony checked his watch,  "Dinner's not for hours. But let's get you lunch.  I know how your metabolism is. And Steve... I wanna enter that poker tournament."  Tony's eyes were bright. "Steve, I'm good at poker.
Steve trembled as Tony's fingers traced over one of the most intimate parts of him. He realised that the collar people that met tomorrow would notice Tony's fresh hite mark- they'd be able to see it, they'd see his claim. Steve kind of liked that. He supposed Tony would too.
"Thank you so much!" said Banksy, as if he didn't hear this every day.  "That's just fantastic, I'm so glad you like it... here, walk with me and Dave... Boz, we're going to have some omega time, 'k?" he called, linking his and Donner's arms together.  He grabbed Dr. Gleason as well.
In the kitchen, he poured himself a cup and threw in a couple of shots of Drambouie, settling down onto a stool and pressing his forehead against the coolness of the marble, taking slow, shallow breaths to calm himself.
Jasper was purple when she let go; he gasped desperately.  "P-project Heirloom is a b-breeding program--"
For Tony, sex was as much about stress release as it was about actual pleasure.  Steve had figured it out pretty quickly after moving in; if Tony had a hard day in the shop, if his codes weren't working right or he was having trouble building a suit or working on one of the cars, he'd often get grouchy, then quickly redirect his energy into rough sex.  It worked out well for them because Steve, being Steve, could take it. And actually seemed to like it. They happily broke furniture and countertops and knocked over orchids and it was fantastic.
Bucky had not realized that.  "...I should be there for him.  He's always picking fights with bigger guys.  He needs me," he repeated. "I promised Sarah I'd look after him.  She said,
"Wonderful. So unless Mr. Stark has any queries...?" Hawley glanced sideways at Tony. "Then we can remove the monitors."
Steve trembled as Gideon pressed on that point behind his ear. His body was responding traitorously.  Steve tried to pull away, but the hand on the back of his neck kept him where he was wanted.
Steve was terribly hyper when the reality of what they'd just achieved hit him on their way back on the drive. Steve was practically bouncing in his seat.
"...yeah," Steve said hesitantly, his gaze still stuck on the ceiling. "That would be great, actually."
"But please don't go all social justice warrior on him!" Aria added quickly. "Just be pleasant and calm and if anything annoy him with how nice you are.  I just want to prepare you for the worst-case scenario."
"You went?" Steve was evidently pleased. "That's great. I'm glad. I hope they're nice to you. I'm guessing they recognised you," he said, his smile warm. "I think it will help, and that you should stick with it- even if just for the coffee," he said, voice gentle.
A moment later he was on the phone with Agent Rumlow.  He could hear mariachi music in the background; apparently, the team was out to lunch at some Mexican place.
"Why don't we go see the lock thing today? You seem most excited about that," Steve said. "Then we can... stay in for the rest of the evening."
Steve leaned down, nudging their noses together. It was a familiar gesture now. He smiled faintly, but the gesture was genuine. "So, do you wanna sleep now, or later?" He nipped at the edge of Tony's jaw, his tone teasing. "Old man?"
There was the sound of a shutter click from across the room.  The waiter brought them a bottle of wine and had the discretion to leave without making a sound, giving them some privacy, although the idea of "privacy" was laughable.  Tony was not a discreet person, and for that matter, neither was Steve.
Tony considered a piece of meat on the end of his chopsticks.  "...they're only going to get more vicious.  They always do," he said gravely.  "
"I'll reclaim you," promised Tony softly.  "I'll kill him. You're mine. All mine." He nosed Steve again.  "My omega." That was really the only solution, as far as Tony could tell.
Sam left him to quiver on his own and stepped outside. He shut the door behind him then leaned against it. "Why the fuck would Steve call HYDRA?"
"I don't know if I care about feeling good anymore," Steve said, voice low and far too gentle. He looked distant, his gaze drifting over to closed blinds that safeguarded the room they were in from the hallway.
"It was just a few hours," Steve tried to assure Phil as he accepted his coffee. But they both knew it had been at least eight. Tony was addictive in nature. Once he had an itch he had to scratch it. Steve remembered when he once hit the thirty six hour mark and he had to literally drag him out and make him eat food.
Steve moved to pull off his top, dropping it on the floor before toeing off his shoes and kicking them away because of the smell. Maybe it didn't bother Tony much but he didn't like it. Then he stuck his hand under the water, checking the temperature. It would do.
JARVIS summoned the film up on the giant screen on the opposite wall for them without having to be asked, the credits playing out as Steve settled his head against Tony's chest. It was becoming an automatic position. It was comfortable and cosy and for some reason he liked the gentle glow and thrum of the arc reactor. It was oddly calming. It was a reminder that Tony was alive, he was here and he was strong and he was staying that way.
try being raised by Howard Stark and Obadiah Stane... God, it was like being a rabbit raised by wolves.  Did you know that everyone at Stark Industries called my dad's office
He pulled himself onto the deck and flopped back with the bottle, letting the sun dry him, still defensive about Steve's words.  He could hear Steve splashing around softly.
"Oh, wow, you finally care about what Donner wants.  Progress!" said Tony, who, while not as infuriated at Steve, was definitely upset; his dander was up, the hairs on the back of his neck spiked.  Steve was gripping the phone so hard Tony was a bit worried he might crush it.
But nothing compared to losing Bucky.  Nothing compared to being unable to stretch that last, critical inch and grab his hand.
Between Vanko and Bucky, Tony was a lot more threatened by Bucky.  But both men were equally mysterious.  They were lurking ominously in the margins of Tony's life, just out of reach.  He'd only
"Dani, another double," he demanded, sticking out the empty martini glass, sucking on one of the olives.  "Extra dirty."
Maybe it was against the stereotype. Alphas were supposed to protect their mates. But Steve felt it went both ways- they were both responsible for each other. He would die for Tony in a heartbeat. Maybe that made him a little insane. But he was okay with being a little insane for Tony.
“P.E.?” Steve grimaced. Why did people need to be trained in physical education? His training consisted of getting beaten by bullies in back alleys. He shrugged; he guessed he understood it a little. “I don’t know? I guess?”
“Hush now, listen to the ocean. We’re going to sway to it.” Tony brings them together and moves his hips side to side. “Loosen up. Listen to the crest and the fall of the ocean. Let your body feel the rhythm of it.”
“You’re amazing, you know that. No one is ever going to believe me on this one.” Tony says and collects the rest of the armor. “Thanks. This will help me out.”
“Wow, you’re touchy today,” Tony says as Steve blots the water up with a rag. He looks more human now as reality sinks in and the fog of fever dissipates.
“I went looking for Hydra cells. SHIELD had clandestine stations all over the world. Some of them are the good guys,” he said with a shrug. “Some of them not so good.”
“Steve,” Tony murmured but it was a half-hearted attempt. The heat of Steve’s body against his stone cold skin enveloped him and lulled him into compliancy.  “Not fair. You know I can never say no to you.” Tony snuggled closer soaking in the warmth and the throb of life around him. He couldn’t speak for other vampires, but he loved the touch of life, was dependent on it. He brushed his face against Steve’s chest, listening to the thrum of his heart and he knew he couldn’t stop, that he needed it more than the preternatural awareness that enlightened and startled him every damned day.
He gave Steve a push and Steve flopped readily down, as compliant as ever.  Tony pointed the dildo at him. "You want this?"
Tony leaned his elbows on the counter, watching Steve move around the kitchen.  Again, the dichotomy.  Steve was huge, muscular, powerful... But barefoot in the kitchen, wearing only a loose t-shirt, making Tony breakfast, he seemed like such a normal, archetypal omega.  Tony sipped his coffee, black, studying Steve's movements admiringly.
"I also told them we would kind of pay them back if we did?"  He winced. "There's a hundred grand buy-in.  It's a joke that they they're these because they want to be. Their parents obviously paid, tryin' to get rid of their omega kids, hoping to sell 'em off to someone with a lot of money.  And if they refuse they have to lose their family all that money... and some of them are scared of going bankrupt.  But," Steve sighed, "if the auction does go ahead, and I'm worried it might--"  It was clear he would be very disappointed if it did. "--we should buy Seven. He was nearly crying.  Well, obviously, we should buy all of 'em, but Seven especial--"
Everything had been fine. He handled it all. Throughout waking up and feeling like he had a cancer growing in him, he dealt with it. Hearing Natasha and Tony speak to him about Tony’s transformation – he listened and accepted it. Sure, he’d been overwhelmed and the debilitating sickness that trapped him had eventually won out until he lapsed into what they said was a coma. But still, he managed to ignore the obvious, the horrible lurking shadows in his brain. The memories of his torture.
“JARVIS send the schedule to the duchess and the prince for final approval, please.” He wants to ensure he does this by the book. While he’s always had a problem with authority (ask Bucky and Peggy if there are any doubts), Steve also knows it’s important to confirm he didn’t miss anything that’s glaringly important to the prince. Once JARVIS verifies that the information has been sent, Steve goes to the bathroom to prepare.
The waterfall is grand but it isn’t the treat Steve thinks it should be. Knowing it’s fake takes away his awe and replaces it only with questions of the skillset of the programmer who invented it. “It’s nice.”
“You know you do that a lot. Apologize for bringing people into the pack. Ask anyone here if they hate it or resent it. Ask them.” Natasha tilted her head to the rest of the members of the team. The kids sat there staring at the Avengers with wide eyes and silly grins.
“I’m sorry. You startled me. I usually don’t have to worry about sighted people in my space. It’s uncomfortable for me,” Tony says. He yanks off the gloves. “I know that sounds weird, especially since I hired you to help me with my work. I planned on having you work on the other side of the lab, not here. This is my space.”
Tony crossed the small space to the bed and sat down, his back to Steve. “I get that. I understand that. But-.” He cringed and closed his eyes. “I can’t lose you when you do this. I can’t.”
“It means you bonded to Steve and our pack. It can be overwhelming at first. Hell, I went Hulk. But you can do this. I thought you wanted this?” Bruce munched on the muffin even as it crumbled apart.
Steve had smiled at that, the heat of his love for Bucky hot on his face. They hadn’t dwelt on the ways to die in space that night, but it haunted Steve – still does as he sits there in the lonely corridor outside of Tony’s quarters. His face is wet with his tears, and he curls his kneels up to his chest. Steve didn’t have family other than Bucky. His friend had stayed behind when his whole family moved off Brooklyn years ago. He wouldn’t leave Steve to tend to his dying mother alone. At least not until the force came and demanded all able bodied men and women join up. The last able bodied people left on Brooklyn had been the old, the young, and Peggy with her brother. The Conclave granted Peggy and Michael a waiver due to the mass of orphaned children left behind by the incursions and the blight. Steve – well Steve hadn’t been wanted by the military.
“You didn’t actually answer the question. I have to admit, I like how you divert at the negotiating table, but how about we get down to it here. How about you tell me what you’re looking for from an alpha.” Tony throws open the door. He shouldn’t, he knows he shouldn’t. Yet there’s something, something changing. He’s seeing the light beyond what he was taught. He feels like he’s only just now rubbing the sleep out of his eyes and rolling over to find that daylight streams into the windows – if only he would throw back the heavy draperies veiling his sight of what could be.
The flush of embarrassment hit him but he kept his eyes on Tony, didn’t shy away. “I get that. I guess I just don’t know who Steve Rogers is anymore.”
“I can do that.” He glances around the room. There’s the obligatory eye chart, a number of instruments that Steve can’t identify as well as a number of posters detailing the anatomy of the eye and the brain. He has a pretty tough resolve, but he never liked looking at anatomically correct drawings that have the organs dissected open.
Somehow he'd found himself in Sam's care. A former slave, but then a soldier in the union army, Sam looked after him when he’d been assigned by the higher Command. Sam spent hours at first with him, trying to coax him out of his pain and nightmares. Steve had thought for sure that his life would remain bleak and colored only in the horrors of his nightmare and memories. But Sam had been there for him, talking him through nights, and keeping him company when he couldn't tolerate any other human being around him. Sam had been there. Through days and then weeks, he'd rehabilitated Steve and saved him in so many ways.  When the doctors gave him opium to quiet his mind and Steve found he couldn’t live a day without it. It had been Sam who found a way to help Steve through the delirium of withdrawing from the drug. He’d held Steve’s head and helped him vomit into a bucket, worked him through the worst of the manic and depressive phases. Sam saved him in mind and body. It was the least Steve could do to save Sam in return.
Steve knows the moment the Hulk grabs the rope again without Tony telling him. There’s a jerk and then wide arcing swing of the rope. The rope then bears weight and goes stiff under Steve’s hands. He swears again and then uses the tightness of the rope as an advantage. He doesn’t need to counterweight the movement; all he needs to do is focus on his climb.
“You’re stealing our future. We have a future. That means you’ve stopped that future, that possibility. We have more life to live, but you’ve stolen it.”
One Friday night when the university planned a three-day weekend for Homecoming or some idiotic reason, Tony had goaded Rhodey to go to one of the illegal Blood Dens out in Vampire Row. Rhodey, always the straight-laced guy, shook his head and refused. At the time Tony was all of fifteen and getting into a Blood Den was hard enough. Being underage made it impossible. “Come on, Rhodey. You’re a killjoy, you know that? I think I might go insane this weekend and you’re sucking all the fun out of it already.”
In a jumble of arms and legs, Tony tumbles down the hill. The muddy ground splashes over him and he collides with Steve. Luckily, Steve’s able to keep his footing and scoop up Tony with one hand. It means he has to leave the shield on his back; they have no defenses except for the gauntlet.
“You don’t have to believe that.” Tony’s words felt as if they hung in the air with a specific density. The room, the world around him, became heavier and thicker.
“Well, I won’t see you, but you know what I mean,” Tony says, feigning laughter, and claps. “Always a good one. Hurry up. I’m ready to go!”
“We’ve met, sir.” Steve placed his shield near the end of the couch as the men offered him a seat. He straightened his dark navy jacket and settled on the couch. Pierce sat down on the section of the couch next to Steve.  Ross stayed standing, arms crossed as he leaned against the glass conference table in the room.
“Maybe, yes, probably? I don’t know. It’s complex and I only have a sample number of one, me, to work on. Plus-.” He stops. “Plus, the doctors are still worried about the possibility of stroke or seizures. I think I solved the stroke issue, but the seizure threat.” He raises a shoulder. “I just don’t know.”
He could protest, but this is not about his pleasure but about Tony’s. With only a bow of his head, Steve slips off the prince’s lap and shrugs off his pants, pulling out the condom and lube from his pocket. He spots the tent in the prince’s erection. “May I?”
Tony knows from history that betas without the strong understanding of dominance and submission played power games that roiled society and turned it on itself. In the end, alphas rose up to regain control. The old world faded and a new reign in stars started. Tony appreciates the abolitionists’ views that the castes cause discontent and the Omega Uprising as well as the disturbances out in the Purge Rim demonstrate that fact. Something has to be done, but the fact still remains that to pretend they were not dictated by their biology led to near annihilation of the species. They could not pretend their natural castes did not exist.
“Some people like to have copies of what they sign, printed copies. It’s just a formality,” she answers and snaps her fingers. “Hop to it! Then get back here and behind the desk.” She clacks out of the office. She must have slipped on her high heeled shoes at some point.
“Fuck! I’m his omega! How the hell did you know, and I didn’t?” Tony cries out. The tears prickle at his eyes again.
“I’m not an expert, but it wasn’t good. We were pretty close to losing Clint.” Bruce bowed his head and then looked up at Steve. “He doesn’t seem to remember and that’s probably a good thing.”
“You do, but I think you might still have a soft spot for him in your heart. If I know you, and I think I do. You have a tendency to have a blind spot when it comes to people you love, to people who mean a lot to you,” Steven said. He shifted his shoulders then as if he was shrugging off an unwanted touch. “I won’t have history repeat itself.”
“There you go. Let’s see those blue blue eyes again. You know you need to stay awake this time. Last time you were awake for a whole 37 seconds. Got everyone excited.”
Tony considers him, his red eyes flashing in the subdued lighting of the soul realm. “Why, Steve? Why stop living? You had a life to live. Me and Nat, we were finished, done. Why would you leave life behind?”
He’s not blind, he understands consequences, but he also knows he’s been abandoned and the only person, the only soul in all of the Realms that came for him – was Tony. He’s not only in love with Tony, he’s beholden to him. He would lay down his life for him and that’s when it hits Steve, full and complete, cracking his chest, bleeding his heart. He does not need a sexual act to bond with Tony – he’s there – so close he knows that he’s teetering on the edges of oblivion.
And he does. With a guttural cry he comes over Tony’s hand. A mess of semen as he shakes and weeps. Tony pets him. He’s sorry that it has to be this way in some aspects. He genuinely finds the omega intriguing. He thinks they will be friends one day. But they are not lovers. They are never going to be lovers. An omega is a warrior first and foremost. This – this is not really pleasure but a means to an end. It is about submission and fealty – that is what nature made them to be.
“Drink this, come on Steve, drink it.” She forces the tube through Steve’s clenched teeth. He fights her in some hazy nightmare, but then as the liquid hits his tongue, he becomes surprisingly compliant. He falls limp in her arms again and rolls his head, opening his eyes.
