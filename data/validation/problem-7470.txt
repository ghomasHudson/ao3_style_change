“You won’t,” Tony said, voice certain. “Steve, I’ll go, and I’ll wake up, and you’ll take care of me and we’ll be happy. We’ll do everything we want. Everything we said we’d do.”
“Doesn’t matter if it’s the right call if it’ll cost your life.”
Steve kisses his mouth and they make out for a little bit. Tony’s mouth takes like vodka and cigarettes, but Steve doesn’t mind. Not when he finally has Tony. His tongue is soft and he nibbles onto Steve’s bottom lip. When Steve rocks their erections, Tony’s groans are stifled.
It hurts, but it’s fine. It has to be fine. Steve deserves this.
“God, what do you even do? How could you not know, she’s incredible!”
It must be his ghosts, but that isn’t unusual. He’s gotten used to the hauntings now.
Tony mumbles something, keeping his hands to the floor. He’s no longer grinding against Steve, so Steve works harder, twisting his hips, making circles to draw out a moan.
“I’m starting to think otherwise,” he twists the cap of the bottle, drowns it in two gulps.
In the first week of August, they received a call from the surrogate, May Parker, and headed to the hospital. They brought Peter home after a two day stay at the hospital, fretting over Peter’s health.
Before Steve can talk himself out of it, he presses a hand against the ajar bedroom door, peaking in. The hinges are well-oiled. It doesn’t creak.
Steve from before who arranges his legs as wide as they can go, spits on his hole, and fucks him until his hole is puffy.
“Yeah.”
He sighs. “I don’t know what I can do here. If I’m wanted here.”
Steve walks to Tony, his boots clicking on the tiles. He steps over the dried come from the previous evening and inspects Tony, the way he would when reading documents. “They tell me you didn’t eat or drink anything today. I don’t need that stress weighing me down while I’m at work.”
To wish.
“Nothing can keep me from your dad.” Steve says, eyes on Tony who meets his gaze with a look full of love.
“Yeah?” Steve raises the cigarette to his lips and blows out a smoke ring.
He spent a lot of time on the rooftop, observing New York from below in black out mode. No one could see him break down and be lightheaded with tears as memories of Tony engulf him.
“No,” he says, ruefully, placing the utensils down. Sometimes he still felt like that skinny kid, though.
Steve makes a satisfied sound then continues his assault on Tony’s hole. He licks around and around, wiggling a finger in and out. The sensation of Steve's mouth and fingers makes Tony breathless, stupid with desire, with a dream to be fucked good and pretty. Steve dives in, like with everything he does. He spreads Tony's cheeks further apart and dives in. Tony loosens with the fingers pumping inside him and the flat tongue jabbing at his hole. "Fuck." Steve pulls off, licks Tony's balls and up his shaft. "I miss you."
He never told Steve the story of the woman with the fur coat and how he had to explain the scene to the police officers. Tony decided he’d tell Steve someday, not now.
Steve pulls back just enough to take in Tony, spread out and eager underneath him, and the truth of his feelings, feelings Steve has tried to hide and ignore and belay, hits Steve in the gut.
I do. I love you, that is.
It wasn’t him.
When he closes his eyes, he sees Kate’s grin and Riri smacking her curls away from her face as she worked on her suit.
Steve stayed there, staring at the helmet, dreading what he’d find. Beside him was a sketchpad filled with drawings of Tony in the workshop. It was still open on an unfinished sketch. Maybe life's like that, incomplete. Always in the state of becoming.
“The serum makes me restless. I have to keep moving.”
Staring at the blood-soaked steps of an empire in rubble, he greeted old friends.
“Nat and Bruce don’t help?” Steve asks, concerned. “You should set some ground rules.”
His heart stops hammering once after he rolls three sticks of tobacco. The act settles him, allows him to not think too much and focus on getting the cigarette into a perfect roll. There’s just the tangy citrus scent and the sharper undertones of the leaves.
“That’s right, let me fuck your mouth,” Tony grabbed his jaw, caressing it before pressing his dick inside.
Tony, eager to please Steve, nodded. It was so beautiful to see Tony on his knees, pleasuring Steve, just because he wanted to—because he could. A feeling of gratefulness erupted in his chest and he toussels Tony’s hair, once again stunned that this was his life.
“You did all this?” Steve chokes on his reply. He tilts his head to their guests and catches them all smiling. Beside Tony, Rhodes nods in approval.
“Well, welcome home, Cap.”
Steve sat them down on the wicker sofa, recalling summer nights they spent up here with the kids. There were tales from their time as superheroes told over s’mores. Morgan’s sticky fingers. Harley complaining he ate too much chocolate. Peter laughing through it all.
it tastes good. Sober. I’m sober, three weeks now.
You looked terrible with blood on your cheek and your ruined suit, but I found that I couldn't take my eyes off you. Even when it hurt to look at you.
“Fine.” Tony rubs his face, exhausted.
There wasn't anywhere to run to.  He didn’t really want to hear Steve’s answer.
Steve’s fingers press onto his cheeks until Tony doesn’t have the energy to hold his jaw shut.
Tony is handsome. Steve’s known this for ages. Even when he didn’t know Tony Stark and Iron Man were the same man, he’s always been fond of Mr. Stark, the Avengers benefactor. Seeing him here, naked and wanton, a layer of sweat defining his pecs, his arms, those broad, muscular shoulders…
Someone bumps into him and Steve loses his balance for half a second. Tony has a hand on his elbow, catching his fall. Steve looks at Tony and he’s lost for words.
“I feel like I’m home,” Steve whispers, kissing his shoulder. It feels like love.
He remains silent and stares at the wicker chair in the corner, wondering if Tony’s ever here, if he finds the greenhouse with all of its various scents and colors, relaxing. Steve bites his tongue. He has so many questions, but none of them come out.
“Please, no.” I’m always begging Steve these days.
The rest of the team looked at him like he had the answers.
Steve places the aloe leaves on a wicker basket along with the vegetables picked. “Are you? Are you living with that?”
“You too, Bruce.” Steve offers his hand, and he tries not to think about how he should have been faster, should have pulled Tony into his arms.
” Tony rolls his eyes with a snort. “Yeah, sappy. For Rhodey, I’d get it, but with Carole? Can you believe it?”
There’s a tap on his wrist. Morgan was making his plate again. She scooped some chile verde and looked at it pointedly.
Tony fiddled with the telephone instead, running the keys, dialing the front desk only to hang up on the second ring.
(See the end of the chapter for
I know what to expect. I remove my clothes and wait.
He’s long stopped twisting his hands. It proved useless to try to get his arms free. The shackles were heavy, made of iron, and the chains that hold his body upright are bolted to the ceiling.
“Come on, you,” Tony says, encouragingly, lifting his hips up. “Show me how you love me.”
“I know.” Steve dipped his head, gathering his thoughts. Tony drove him insane. He was exuberant, full of energy, flying around the suit in circles. “You make me nervous.”
“You think so?”
Did he put her down the tracks too? He might as well have. Her last words,
Of course not. You’re Steve. You might have smiled your way through it. You don’t have to carry the world anymore. We’ll be fine, Steve. We’ll be alright.
Steve parks at the entrance, hoping Tony won’t mind, fetches Tony’s keys from his pocket and carries him inside. Steve has no idea where he’s going. He lets his feet take him into the foyer, then the stairs, then settles on the first bedroom he finds. It’s uncluttered, modern in design and fully furnished. He doubts this is where Tony actually sleeps at night. But Steve is too spent from the evening. He drops Tony on the bed, takes off his clothes, and tucks him under the covers. He fetches a towel from the ensuite bathroom and wipes the stickiness of Tony’s body down. With slow movements, Steve undresses and puts their spoiled clothes on the love seat in the corner of the room.
You cling on like a damn bug.
Tony didn't have anything to say, so he wrung his hands together and picked at the holes the nails had made on his fingers. He studied the nails on the coffee table.
Steve turns, the muscles of his shoulders flexing. He smiles, the curve of his lips inchin higher and higher and it’s almost like everything is fine, as if tomorrow Steve wouldn’t have to be on the run, hiding, and Tony wouldn’t be tasked to bring him in. “I’ll tell you next time.”
He purses his lips, willing himself to not fall into pieces. He doesn’t the way Steve looked at him. He doesn’t want to remember.
In the morning, Tony walks up alone in bed, and he lets out a sob. The sheets are sticky with their spit and come. His pillow is wet with tears. Then, he hears the shower turn on, the humming from the bathroom. Steve’s still here.
“Did you like that, Tony? Wish fulfilled?”
“Can I hold your hand?”
Steve tilts his head again, again, again. It’s a favorite, and Tony’s always liked Steve taking command. Steve kisses him, cups his chin with his thumb and forefinger, and traces the line of Tony’s lips with his tongue. His body responses to Steve’s touch, the flick off his nipples, the heavy touch of Steve’s hands on his lower back. Tony closes his eyes, embracing Steve.
Steve can’t see the future and he’s making a mistake. Tony bites the words down, letting himself drift into that hazy comfort of Steve’s warmth. They kiss and kiss, trade spit and quiet little groans. Tony drinks all of it in, every pant, soft breath.
What about Sharon, Tony doesn’t say.
Steve smiles, a small curl of the lips but it’s blinding and he carried Tony to bed last night, tucked him in, and has now made him breakfast. Is this what it means to be treated well? He hops from foot to foot, watching as Steve sets the plates and steaming coffee on a tray, smiling all the while.
It’s a self-proclaimed hotel, but it’s more like a home converted. The foyer has wooden floors, and a modest chandler. Behind the desk is a young woman with bangs cut two inches too short.
“Shit, these kids swear up a storm themselves,” Samuel says with a laugh. He turns to kids. “Scram and spread the news that Tony Stark is here to fix your parents cars and garage doors!” He faces Tony and they shake hands, appearing to share a wordless conversation Steve isn’t privy to. “Thanks for fixing up my old girl.”
Once the finger is pulled out, Steve is lining up behind him, pressing against him, no care that Tony isn’t ready.
“Wherever.”
“Head out of the gutter, Steve.”
Their responses ranged from “no” to “yes” to “I guess.”
Steve’s arms tighten around his waist, gripping enough to bruise. Tony wants the mark there to be there in the morning. A reminder that this fucking, this fucked up away to cope with their relationship falling apart, happened. Tony twists his hips in slow circles until he fully descends on Steve’s dick.
“Tony, sweetheart,” Steve taps his ankle, pulls them apart, then makes his way between them. He kisses Tony’s jaw, inching up to peck Tony’s eyes. “Yours has always been my favorite blue.”
“Your husband doesn’t want to sleep alone. He prefers sleeping with your arms around him.” Steve swiped the sweaty hair from his face. He had a good half-marathon run around Central Park earlier.
He looks pleased, like this is play for something else.
Steve turned, seeing the snow fall in the window. There was a snow storm during the battle. But Iron Man’s suit shone bright against all the white—ruby reds and beaming yellows.
“Everything I’ve been doing— done — is about trying to survive.”
Steve spits, rinses his mouth, and splashes water on his face. He takes Tony’s towel, dries his face off.
“Steve. Let me. Let us—” She grabbed his shoulder and pushed him away from the sink. Natasha picked up the glass with delicate fingers, then deposited them to the bin. “It’d be easier if you used the dishwasher, you know.”
Bucky snorts. “You don’t want me to start, or you’ll be red in the face.”
“Too salty!” Tony exclaims, but continues to chew thoughtfully. Steve pours him a glass of water from the pitcher.
Steve stares. He doesn’t know what to do. He didn’t expect this—he thought—well—he thought he'd meet Tony Stark, they’d have a walk around the beach, talk about their respective lives. Then, maybe they’d grab a bite and Steve would tell Tony about his time in the Army. Then, maybe Tony might open up about his parent’s untimely death last year. Steve would ask, “How are you holding up? Is there anyone to support you?” But he wouldn’t say,
“Let’s go to bed?” Steve rolls his shoulders back twice. He’s still naked and when he presses close, his pubic hair tickles Tony.
No, he has, a long time ago. And this isn’t like spending a night in a shelter or an airport where there’s a box of Lost & Found. It’s not as easy as searching for misplaced things. He supposes that forgiveness and people do not work that way, no matter how much he wished it did.
“Come for me—let me feel you make me wet. Come inside me,” Tony gasps out, his hand going to the nape of Steve’s neck, playing with the soft hairs there. “Please, I want to feel you—please—please… Harder, keep going. I want to
“You love it.”
“What were you laughing at, hmmm?” Tony wears nothing but a sly grin.
Morgan petted the wild thing and cooed. Since then, they’ve taken to placing a bowl of cat food by the ledge. It came every other day, usually when Steve was working in the gardens.
They were just waiting now. Waiting. Waiting. Wait.
“Sprung this one on me the way you sprung out wanting some chickens after you saw Iz’s hens, huh?” Steve tries to steady himself. He scruffs his feet before staring back at Tony.
“Not like this, Steve, not like this,” Tony whispers. He wants to put his hands on Steve, punch him or smooth the lines on his face, Tony doesn’t know.
He still had her blood on his shoes and the rancid smell of a New York subway station on his clothes.
Man and the machine, that’s what Iron Man is. In the end, I don’t know if there’s a difference anymore. Not with Extremis, not with this big fucked up brain that thinks it can take on the world. Carry on, you might say. Well. This is it.
Steve dropped beside Bucky and put his shield down. He removed the cowl and wiped his sweaty hair back. “Hey, Buck. I’m not sure what you want to do. If you want to just stay away from all this superhero stuff, I think Tony can get you a new identity after the rest of your triggers are removed.”
“Not if you’re overworking yourself.” Bucky said.
“That’s because she’s the youngest,” Bucky replied, flicking Harley’s ear. They got into a playful tussle that only stopped once Bucky threatened to make Harley sit on his lap.
Rhodes snorted. “You know, that’s something Tony would say. Try to play this off as something casual. But you know why we’re here, Steve.”
Tony dragged himself up and stumbled towards the door. It wasn’t the service butler.
“So you say.”
Tony smelled like motor oil and something that burnt, but Steve didn’t care. His husband was finally back in bed with him.
He doesn’t know where they stand. Civility only ever lasts so long.
Now, Peter’s eyes were stormy. His fists were balled like he’s holding the remains of tattered patience. “Don’t talk to him like that.”
Her screams are heard all the way past the ruined dam.
Outside their brownstone were photographers and journalists taking pictures of the car. Some went as far as knocking on the tinted glass. He tried to shield Morgan from it, turning her head to his arm once the screaming began.
“Smells good!” Kate and Riri skip into the dining room and pull up their chairs, both flanking the head of the table.
“This one is done. Bring me another one,” Steve barks out the order in his comms.
“I think a lot of us are in same boat.”
God, when some of his unit spoke of Tony Stark’s sex tape, Steve confiscated the material, then proceeded to watch it in his quarters. It was the only thing that took his mind off the violence in the desert. Tony Stark’s naked flesh. His plump lips, bright eyes. It was easy to imagine himself in Stone’s position. Except, Steve wouldn’t be violent. He wouldn’t fuck Tony’s face and he sure as hell wouldn’t come all over his back. No, Steve would prefer to keep his semen inside Tony. He’d fuck it back in and lift his legs to check that none slips out. Stone was a menace in the video, a relentless twat who didn’t even jerk Tony off.
“No, I’ve got a duty to my people,” It says.
He swirled on the wheeled chair and held up the schematics of the suit beside him. It was Mark XLII. The armor was mostly in gold plating and looked like a menace. "This Mark has some design flaws. I’m trying to improve it with dad’s notes."
Tony nodded, his voice sounding paper-thin. “You would have seen me cry.”
Tony’s eyebrows shot up. He leaned back, arms crossed over his chest. “Do you mean, I’m not like you?”
Brunch comes and goes.
Steve looked at Peter. He’s all Tony, from his brown hair, to the sharp descent of his nose. He’d go through puberty soon and there’s no doubt that he’d have Tony’s strong jawline. It’s like his children have all the best parts of Tony Stark.
His limbs ache from disuse. He’s always horizontal these days. Thighs spread wide. Just a hole to fill.
Tony sighed. “Yes, I know, you love me and care for me and you’d die if I died and all that jazz. But baby, you can’t live with all this fear. I’m fine.”
My days blur together. I live in a mausoleum and wear a dead man’s clothes.
“Alright, well, I’m sure there are other enhanced humans out there who’d want to be part of this...whatever it is.” Tony stood over him, a sculpture of red and gold. He offered his armored hand.
Tony balked at the memory.
He gives Steve time to adjust. He brings Steve back to his old flat by the Sheriff’s station and hides himself in the workshop.
Mouths something unintelligible. Closes Its eyes.
“Tony. You’re important. Don’t think otherwise.”
In those three weeks, the Compound was stifling. The air was too thick. It clung onto them. Too heavy with the reminder of the last time he was here, lounging about with Sam and Wanda. Vision floating in and out of the room, unannounced. Tony and his bots dancing in the workshop, a smoothie in hand. Natasha, sitting cross-legged with a Russian poetry book in her lap.
Natasha was curled by the fireplace, fingertips tapping away on her tablet. After all the heckling Bucky’s given her about bringing work during dinner, he has long given up on prying the tablet from her hands.
“I won’t bend.” Steve walks over and he’s just on the other side of the sink. That’s them, now, isn’t it? On the side of each other. An immovable rudder preventing the construction of any bridge. Tony will even take a rickety one at this point.
“I hope Stark’s in a better place now. He just finished that mess with the Mandarin a few months ago.” She crossed her arms and leaned back on the rolling chair. She had the air of a woman who took no shit and was used to being right.
“Well, if it means living a life with some sort of peace, I think it’s worth it.” Tony rubbed at the removable arc reactor on his chest.
Slowly, it oozes down the cell's floor, making Tony's prison reek.
“Pitt'o Nili! Fight, you fool!”
I'm Director Stark now. I asked Maria to bring me an espresso. She would probably shoot me the first chance she gets.
“Promise me you’ll be alright, Steve. I need you to be okay after I’m gone.”
But Steve only has eyes for the man in the middle.
“For anyone else, yeah. That’s right. Mine, mine, mine.” Tony wrapped a leg over Steve’s waist and kicked lightly. “Now do your job and fuck me good. Like it’s your goddamn job, Cap.”
You’re back. Well, a version of you is. Guess what the first thing you— well, a version of you— did? Throw the shield to my face. Do you always have to be in a war stance or in a rest parade? I still wonder, whether you’re softer, looser with your girlfriends. Lovers, whatever. Was it like that with Sharon? These days, I don’t think I can manage to unwind. Sometimes I think the rough, jagged parts are all that I have left. I’m not like you, Steve.
like Rumiko—not just because she’s Tony’s partner, but because she’s her own woman, pragmatic and independent, but still filled with a shining hope that inspires Tony. For that alone, Steve’s grateful. Tony has someone to come home to, someone who’ll pester him into tending his wounds, holding him into the night, and, when the nightmares reach the surface, she’ll be there to make sure Tony doesn’t drown.
“Yeah.” Steve coughed. His son was much more adjusted than him. “You’re right about that. I uh, learned in a group that. Grief is part of love. Love is worth it. I’m trying here, alright? I’m still trying to come to terms with that.
This is a man who reads him so well. He has an answering reply for every emotion on Steve’s face.
“Forever isn’t infinite. Your life isn’t over, Steve. You have to live. I know, it’s like listening to a broken record, you have all of us giving you platitudes, checking on you. I see you’ve reached the end of the line. But it’s true, Steve. You’ll be alright, one day. But grief, it stays. You’ll always miss him. Love him. But you can’t keep doing this. Your children need you.”
“I don’t even know at this point, Tony. Why
Steve stands and undoes the buttons of his uniform. Green isn't his color. It's always been blue.
SHIELD had scheduled a deep cover for their team the same time Tony’s Mandarin fiasco happened.
And that’s alright.
He gives no explanation of why he’s changed his mind. Steve wants to ask, but talks himself out of it. Instead, he focuses on reading all the highway signs.
“Did you find them?” Tony tilts his head.
I don’t look anymore.
Loading the laundry machine took two minutes, tops. But Tony couldn’t be bothered to separate his clothes by color. In the future, all one had to do was dump their basket into a machine, fill it with soap, and press a button. Back in the day, they had to use washboards and mangles, then scrub like crazy.
Funny. Two years on the run, all he wanted to do was to return. He never said so, though, the stubborn shit he was. He could have called, written, texted. Could have, could have, could have. But he didn’t because he knew deep in his bones that his conviction was right — that Tony would see his point and back down.
“I gotta provide for my husband,” Tony sighs, sleepy and stated.
“You ready?”
Steve packed half of his clothes and some of them were the ones Tony purchased for him. There’s a metaphor there somewhere. Steve shucks off his shirt, then he’s helping Tony unzip his pants and pull it down to his ankles.
“Hawkeye?” Steve asks, wondering where Clint was too. They hadn’t seen each other since the Raft. Steve didn’t keep track of his surviving team mates in the weeks they returned to the Compound.
We worked together again, side by side. Me and you, me and you. Another version of you with the memory of me. Us.
“If by ex you mean Fury, then no thanks, Tony.” Steve glances down, willing his heart to calm. He’s still in the high of victory with endorphins from the fight.  The left side of his body was sore from the fall he took, but he paid it no mind.
Steve didn't bother reading the details. He held the folder up, closing it. “It just seems so permanent. With this.”
is good.
“J,” Steve swallowed, putting a hand over Morgan to console her. “You still have the recording of us viewing it, though, right?”
I’ve said it in all the wrong ways throughout the years.
Steve lived with a man for two decades and built a life together. Words couldn’t capture the aching howl in his chest or the desire to be dead, too. He just had to sit with it.
reflexes have slowed. delay in memory processing. slowly, slowly, im deleting. not fast enough. not enough.
He wants to feel it tomorrow, remember that tonight was real.
“No, it’s fine.”
“She was your friend. An Avenger — she was,” Tony cries, unable to finish the words, failing to explain how Tigra found out about his identity the same day Cap did, how Tigra apologized for being terrified and letting them all down and how Steve applauded her strategy, and her confusion at finding Tony and Thor —
Steve’s cock is thick and he’s bigger than any sun I’ve seen. Maybe this is why they have monuments of him across the city.
“Oh, Steve. You’re just perfect.” Tony pulled off, slicked his dick, pressing his blunt head forward. Steve waited until Tony was fully seated before fucking his ass back in long, deep thrusts. “I sure do love it when you beg.”
He’s in his skin-tight Commander uniform. The star on his chest blazes like pride. Humans are such fools.
“Tony, do you want some yogurt or jello?”
He pauses for a moment. “Steve Rogers.”
He pushes up, repositions himself so he’s straddling Steve. Tony grabs Steve’s neck, squeezes it, again and again, making himself remember that this is real. With their foreheads pressed close, he ghosts a kiss on Steve’s eyelids, feels it damp, and has his heart broken again and again.
Until now. Until they’ve come to this space where problems are swept as secondary to punishment.
Waiting in the basement of the workshop for Tony to show up from the SI Tower.
Steve has been tracking the target since he landed at the airport with a duffel bag, still in his army boots. No matter, Tony’s worth it. This is his second week scouting Venice, but no such luck. He’s posed at bars, walked the boardwalk, and attended parties until dawn. Sometimes, he ends up camped by the beach until the sun rises and the surfers come for the waves. It’s not like New York, no, not by a long shot.
Steve is beside me, but his thoughts are far away.
Something is fucked. I think Extremis is off and I’m deleting my brain and I can’t tell the difference between dreams, my fucking fantasies, and memory anymore.
Tony scrubs his fingers on the napkin, sets it down, then looks at Steve too carefully, like he’s afraid the next words might be too much to bear in this fragile friendship— what did you even call them, teammates, ex-teammates.
“You’re the sun,” Steve said in awe. “You’re the sun I orbit around.”
“You could have written, you know.”
“Well, your dad is irresponsible and needs to get rest.” Steve said, fond, before dropping a kiss on Tony’s crown. “Not really a good model for you two.”
He woke up from the coma, they fought Osborn, and now he was here, reeling with the blowback. His brain kept feeding him images of his failures. There was something fucked there, but Tony didn’t bother to check. Maybe remembering was his punishment.
Steve inhaled, then held his breath. “Are you sure he’ll be okay?”
Somehow.
“Alright,” Tony said, because society people have notoriously impeccable manners even if it was all smoke and mirrors. As he stepped back to the machine, the station bells rang to announce the arrival of the car. It was a loud, angry whistle that shook the edges of the platform.
Steve steels himself, unlocks his jaw, puts his hands on parade rest, and tries to remain unassuming. He straights, then in the most commanding voice he could muster, he turns to Tony and says, “Mr. Stark, you don’t know me, but I just witnessed this man put something in your drink.”
Sometimes, he wondered whether it was better if he just disappeared, became a faceless, average man.
“I think so.”
He cries as he draws both of us from his memory bank.
“Stay with me,” Steve commands, slapping the space between his ass and thighs. "Enjoy it. Can't you see the effort I'm putting in trying to make you feel good." Steve pets the place he marked. "Can't you see I'm trying, Tony?"
Harley said, “Could go to MIT now like dad.”
“And yet.” Steve laughs, making no move to gesture between them.
Bobbi’s face is pale, ashen, and her lips are bloody as is Clint’s face, as if they both suffered an awful beating before the execution.
“No, it isn’t. But grief is like that. A stagnant particle with nowhere to go or a circuit that spins and spins.”
“Steve.” Tony leaned forward as Steve offered him another piece of donut. This time, Tony's favorite, the butter crumb donut. Tony twisted his mouth, “I’m fine. Save some for the kids.”
His mouth is sour and he smokes to rid himself of the taste.
“Oh, that’s good, isn’t it?” Rumiko asks, breathless.
Steve tries not to think about that too much.
“He would have,” Tony insists, glancing back at Steve. “He’s a good kid with a big heart. You would have hit it off.”
“And give you all the fun? No thanks. Weren’t you the one who made a speech about doing things together? Well here it is. I guess Fury’s boyband is finally taking off.” Tony sighed, glancing at the windows. There’s the skyline. It’s still too early in the morning for the sun to rise. But New York never slept. The buildings kept twinkling.
Instead, he grips Steve’s shoulders, hard, shakes him as if to tell him
“Soon.”
Natasha caught his eye when he stepped out of the kitchen with a bowl of chips and hummus. She offered a small smile, looking proud, even though there’s no reason to be. Maybe it’s because he showered and shaved his unruly beard.
Steve who doesn’t stop until the
“Pa, your hands are dirty with lunch meat.” She shifted away, batting his hand with a frown.
Rhodes eyed him with something like pity. “We’re here to help, Steve. If you ever just want time for yourself, you can let us know. We’ll take the kids out for a day, a weekend.”
Steve’s lips quirked when Tony moved to buy a MetroCard. “Come on, use mine.”
Tony takes the spoon from him and blows. He eats, forcing himself to swallow it down. His throat is hot, and there’s a certain rawness that warm food cannot assuage.
and said that Americans “are forever searching for love in forms it never takes, in places it can never be. It must have something to do with the vanished frontier.”
Steve sighs and heads to town to buy food to feed their team.
Maybe it was wishful thinking, but he hoped to paint clouds in at least one of the rooms. Or maybe a swirling galaxy. A kid would love that.
Tony sat back on the sofa. “Why?”
“I just might,” Bucky hums. “What do you say?”
The salesman smiles, opens the drawer to his left, and sets a folded map between them. His fingers smooth the creases. “So, we’re here, right? And we’d go west through…”
There used to be a team, a ragtag group of distinctly different individuals who might not ever be friends if not for their very specific skill sets being needed during a crisis. They used to win. Even with cuts, bruises, lives lost, Steve did the calculus for each fight, and he had determined that they’ve preserved.
Sheriff Red Wolf twirls his badge.
All in all, they spent the last few months holding their breaths until the baby—Peter Benjamin Rogers-Stark—was born.
He shakes his head. “I don’t smoke.”
He pushed Morgan’s hair back, rocked her side to side until she fell asleep with tears like train tracks on her face. The team stayed quiet, engaged in soft, murmured conversations that Steve couldn’t really comprehend. He heard the voices, but he couldn’t register the words. Steve couldn’t even make sense of his current predicament.
“You really think that, don’t you? Not everyone, Steve, is worth it. You should learn that by now.” Tony looked away, flicked more screens, expanded others. He finally spoke up once the sun started crawling from the horizon. “Alright, well, first things first, I advise you to ditch SHIELD, they can’t be trusted if HYDRA’s embedded in the organization. Romanoff and Barton seem reformed, will they follow you? Hold that thought. Then, we’ll have to track Barnes. J, use my satellite and screen all CCTV’s for anything resembling Barnes.”
Two young women occupy the sofa across from him. A series of expressions cross their faces, they seem just as surprised to see him, but they hide it well.
I laugh. Steve is so determined, so earnest in his beliefs, yet he’s the one that keeps lying to himself.
Steve’s heart stuttered, and he glanced away because Tony’s eyes were too revealing, too tempting, and Steve had no time for that now.
“No.” Steve pulls off without warning and grabs Tony’s wrist with the same hand that was just fucking him. He slams them to the mattress. “No,” he whispers, “Come on, look at me. Let’s have this.”
He headed back to the kitchen, scrubbed the sink, then the ground floor’s bathroom. By then, everything in the common areas were clean and there was no use in denying the inevitable.
“It’s nothing new. The town is used to you being a drunk,” she cuts in sharply and frowns. “We need to be there.”
“Yes, you do, baby.” Tony nodded, tilting his ass up like an invitation. Steve, weak for this man, removed the hand on Tony’s dick and used it to tilt his thighs higher. He dropped down, shoving his face to Tony’s ass and began licking his hole. He alternated between fingering him and fucking Tony with his tongue. His chin was wet with saliva and the taste of Tony.
Grieve. Cry. Let it out. It’s alright. Remember the good times, the happy moments with gratefulness rather than regret.
“We have to go, sweetheart. It’ll be alright.” He hushed her, then turned his arm and held Harley closer. He’s like Steve—explosive in his anger; they expected Tony’s passing to be hard on the kids. Shit, it was hard on Steve. It might be difficult until the day Steve died himself.
Steve didn’t need a therapist. He needed Tony. Here. In the flesh to bully him into making breakfast.
“Miss Barnes?” Tony glances at her still-figure. “You alright?”
A sigh escapes Tony, and Steve bites his lip when Tony starts rocking against him, arching his back, demanding more.
Steve looms over him, nudging Tony’s ribs with his boots. He has his arms crossed and a frown on his face.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t think anyone would be here so late.” She turned to him, biting her lips. “Won’t you go grab a soda by the machine?”
“Not true, Steve, not true at all.” Tony pressed against his chest and popped a blueberry into his mouth.
“Alright. Stark-Rogers. Rogers-Stark, whichever.”
He fails and groans, the sound coming deep from within his body, and he's kissing Tony's neck, rubbing his entire body, wishing Tony won’t shower after this, that he'll smell like Steve until the morning.
“He has your eyes, Tony.”
He saw his friends everyday—that’s what Natasha and Clint were, right? Friends. He had those, now, Bucky would be proud.
“And Steve always came knocking down his doors offering him a tray of leftovers,” Natasha says.
Tony. Tony. Tony.
Scott and Hope were in the living room with Cassie, chatting about some television show they have all started watching. Steve spotted Clint and Laura with their now adult daughter, Lila, out in the roof top garden having beers with Rhodes.
“Steve.”
The thing that Harley inherited from Tony was his denial of feelings until the moment he exploded. No, that’s probably wrong. He’s more like Steve in that case.
“Yeah.” Tony swallows, aiming to say more. He doesn’t know what, but Steve’s already turning away.
“I just want him,” Tony cries, brokenly. “And I can’t…. You can’t. Be him. He’s not.”
When Steve returned from Strange's healing community in Savage Mountain, Red Wolf insisted that Steve take back the badge. Steve, decent and admirable, shook his head, gave Red Wolf a gun, and called him Sheriff.
His heart erodes in increments.
Peter handed him a glass of water then dropped next to him.
Tony suddenly turns, rustling the sheets and making the mattress squeak. His eyes snap to Steve. “Goodnight, Steve.”
Now, the walls are filled with photos of Bruce in the lab. Bruce as the Hulk posing with Riri and Kate on his side, likely taken in the lawn of the Compound. There is another where he flexed his large green arms and Riri and Kate hung over them.
Sometimes Steve hated that she looked like Tony. Maybe Steve’s just seeing the things he wanted to see. Everyone would agree that her eyes, bright, brown, full of life, were Tony’s.
She was spitfire in that little red dress, slit to the side showing the length of her thigh. The golden thigh bracelet. She rubbed his cock through his slacks that night, teasing, not letting him come.
“Sometimes.” He shrugs. “You come home from running from war, you never stop running. Don’t realize it though.”
He prods the organs, his sleeves covered in green slime. Blood, Tony realizes. “Is it just Walter or are the rest of the returnees like this?”
Tony squawked with a blush. He looked at Steve, then away. “Nothing. Nada. Forget it.”
“What did you come here for then?” His chest grew tight and there was that feeling of bile rising up his throat again.
They had today, tomorrow, and the rest of their lives.
Steve didn’t have the energy to tell them not to call his daughter Maguna. That was Tony’s nickname for Morgan.
Steve’s heart skipped. He swallowed down the flicker of anxiety. “Tony—”
There’s that small quirk on his lips. Steve nods, looking pleased and enthralled.
And so he's back, driving himself crazy with all the changes. Maybe he shouldn't have left.
“Of course, I’m angry!” Steve bellowed, throwing his fist against the wall. The mirror hanging on the fireplace shook with the force of Steve’s punch. When he removed his hand, there was a hole in the drywall. “I want to fucking scream until I pass out. Carol tells me you’re lying in your own filth, drunk out of your mind, calling for me.”
“Tony,” Steve’s voice is measured, almost commanding, oscillating between an amused scold reminiscent of many nights spent together, and pinched seriousness. “How?”
He didn’t need to talk to a shrink.
The last time he uttered these damn words was the day Steve was shot.
There’s a question on the tip of Steve’s tongue, but he stops himself from speaking out loud. It’s something new he’s learned. To not always talk. To listen more and more. To give Tony the time and space to say what he means. It’s all about waiting, now.
Bruce falters, and he looks between Tony and Steve, then says, “Good to see you, Cap.”
“It seems like I need it if people are going to be drugging me.” Tony takes his cup and spills its contents to the floor. He has no idea whose house this is and he doubts it’s Tony’s. He spills some of the beer on Victor’s loafers, too. “Get the hell out of my face.”
my spelling is not so great anymore. but you won't read this, will you, steve.
Time slipped by, fast—like sand slipping from his fingers when he closed his fist—and slow, like being trapped in unmoving traffic.
Steve could take it at any moment, lace their fingers together, ask for something he doesn’t have a name for. He places his hand on his lap, leans further back until the meat of his shoulders are digging into the curve of the wooden chair.
They’ve both changed.
Steve laughed, opened the bag, and passed Tony a bagel. It was slathered in vegetable cream cheese.
welcome me, alright
Happy greeted them in the garage with a solemn tilt of the head and opened the doors to the limo. Peter hopped onto the shotgun seat, glasses still in tack. Happy looked at him for a moment before catching Steve’s eye in the rearview mirror. The car began its ascent into the streets.
Steve’s jaw works and he forces himself to center his attention on Tony instead of listening to her purr, telling Tony that
He wipes his forehead with the end of his shirt and drops down to the patch of grass. Across from him, there’s a jasmine tree partially in bloom. Its flowers growing, but there’s segments of just empty branches. It’s a deep white color, and there’s no doubt that if Steve didn’t have the serum, he’d be coughing and dry heaving from the pollen. Beside it, there’s a fallen log with a blue bird hopping the bark before flying off.
“Your parents’ death wasn’t an accident. It was an operation by HYDRA. There’s a tape to prove it.” He shoved aside the selfish, fleeting thought to keep this from Tony. But Steve wasn’t that man. “The other thing… The assassin they sent in the mission was my best friend, James Buchanan Barnes. Bucky.” Steve willed himself not to tremble and he loosened his grip on Tony’s wrist. “I’m not sure about the details yet. But he didn’t die when he fell from the train. Somehow, HYDRA got a hold on him.”
“But a damn good one,” Tony continues, closing his fists to stop the tremors. The sun is making him feverish again, and he wants nothing more than to cross the street and enter the saloon. “It’s too bad he’s a fool.”
Steve tried to beckon him over but Harley just sobbed harder and held on. “Peter, come here.”
Tony shakes away the forlorn expression on his face. “Alright, yeah, I met Riri there. Building her own Iron Man suit. Can’t understand why.”
“Kids,” Tony mutters then shakes his head ruefully. “To be young and in love.”
It’s an observation.
“Looks like she’s about seven months,” she supplies, hand dropping down to cradle her belly. “I’m having one, too.”
“I feel like this would be saying goodbye,” Tony’s eyes open to catch the moonlight drifting in the outdoor balcony. They haven’t made the Avengers Tower home.
I get on my hands and knees, spread my legs, and tell him that I love the way he fills me up and yes, I can take it harder. Of course, I can. Please, more, harder. This is something I am used to.
He places them on  the table, then reaches over, once, twice, three times, until he pulls back last minute to grab his glass of water or the cutlery.
With fixed determination, Steve is standing, putting one foot after the other to pull the curtains open.
“Yes!” Harley cuddled closer to Tony, putting his little hands on his father’s middle. He smiled up at Tony. Steve felt his heart soar the sight of his little family all together.
“Glad to hear it.” Steve peels off Tony’s socks, stuffs them into his sneakers, then removes his boots. He offers to carry both their shoes, but Tony just rolls his eyes and grabs his sneakers from Steve. They walk side by side, barefoot.
“Hey, Pepper.” He didn’t know what else to say.
Steve stayed there until his skin was red and his body stopped shaking.
“Right.” Steve grimaces. “Sorry,” he says, following the way Tony’s neck stretches under the sun.
“Stop, Tony, just stop.” Steve’s fingers tightened on Tony’s shoulder for a beat. “You and I both know that this isn’t just about the Registration. It was everything else.”
Steve was speechless. He swallowed, searched her awaiting eyes. They were brown, wide, and expressive, so much like Tony’s and it only hurt a little bit. Like an ache to a month-old bruise. Like a quiet murmur. It was okay to look at her and think about missing Tony and loving him and feeling like shit and waiting for the world to just swallow him whole. It was alright.
Learn to see this country again; the place he once loved.
“Love you,” Tony called out to Steve.
He keeps his own hands on his side and doesn’t step forward. Doesn’t walk the seven steps it would take to stand in front of Tony, pull him up, shake him, make him listen. Can’t he see — can’t he determine with that brilliant mind of his that Steve is trying. This is him attempting.
“Yeah, you did.”
“I can be very convincing.” Tony waggles his eyebrows, then immediately stops, like a child caught something they’re not supposed to be doing. Steve hates it. Hates this stop-go-stop-go, hot-cold. Tony smoothens out his jacket and picks at it, body half turned away from Steve. “Sometimes,” he says, like an afterthought.
“Who’s the flatter now?”
She grabs the bottle and pours the vodka into the mug then takes a sip.
“I think this is my new favorite spot to get laid.” Tony reaches for the wash cloth and gives it to Steve. With an eye roll, he lathers up soap and begins scrubbing Tony’s back, taking extra care to tenderly wash the space between his cheeks.
He spits the toothpaste and rinses his mouth, and when he looks up, Steve’s behind him. A pensive expression on his face. It’s a portrait of domestic life.
No. Steve’s already decided that he’s happy for Tony.
Natasha appeared beside him, observing the porcelain shatters in the sink. She peeked over his arm and took the sponge from his fingers. “It’s just a surface cut, it’ll heal in a few minutes.”
He reached behind Tony, circling his rim before pressing in. “Is that good for you, sweetheart?”
“I am talking to Steve Rogers right?”
“Don’t you have cleaning bots?” Steve asks, grabbing the stacking the plates and bringing them to the kitchen.
This might just be a moment for them, a fragment of history in their journalistic accounts, but this is Steve’s reality now. It’s his everyday. There wasn’t another story.
No matter how many times Tony explained the process of cancer cells to kids, pathologized it, instituted scientific terms and delineated the decline of his biology, it didn’t prepare the kids for the emotional impact of his passing. It didn’t prepare Steve.
Steve shuffled to the bedroom. His bedroom now. Not theirs. Steve didn’t share it with anyone anymore.
Tony would kiss both of his eyes, his cheeks, everywhere, whatever he could reach, then slap Steve’s ass before making his way to the shower. “Good morning, beloved.”
“Well, what did you expect, Stark? It’s me and you.”
Rhodey and Carol come over. They both punch Steve in the arm, and just as he’s about to mock-frown at them, the door slams open, revealing Tony grumbling about damages to the War Machine suit, phone in hand, likely chatting with Peter Parker or his new ragtag mentees. As Tony walks to Steve for a kiss, Bucky and Sam enter from the side door, a pile of pizza between them.
The first time I drink, Steve breaks my nose.
The ache in his chest was a familiar feeling now.
“The report from JARVIS stated that Mr. Stark had a seizure while in the air.” The doctor, Chang, consults her tablet and pulls out an MRI. They’re pointing at Tony’s brain, say something important, but Steve just observed his husband frown and nod at the information.
“So everyone knows I’m yours?”
“Steve.” Bucky dropped a hand on his shoulder. “You good?”
, and would beg for
The mid-morning sun filters in through the windows. Steve realizes that he could get used to this.
“Of course, this is where I belong, baby.” Tony hummed, smiling at Steve from the mirror. They stayed there for a moment, content, before they followed their morning routine. They brushed their teeth together then Steve tossed his sweaty running shorts in the hamper. He got into the shower, and this morning, Tony slid the doors open and hugged Steve from behind.
“Will you come for me?” Steve pushes Tony’s hair back and smiles, a small thing that should be replaced with a demanding groan, a furrowed brow, a smirk.
“Top shelf scotch for room 1923, please.”
Sitting back on the bed, he examines Rumiko drawing almost-absent circles on Tony’s back.
“They didn’t have sesame.”
“We’re all getting tired of you two kissing all the time, you know. I wish Peter was here so he could web you two apart for just five seconds,” Morgan complains and crosses her arms.
He is.
Steve stripped, scratched his chest, and slid the shower door open.
She’s there. She’s staying.
Then, there’s the rattle of the door followed by a quick opening and closing. “Well, fuck.”
But not lately.
“Baby, I gave up that notion a long time ago. Captain America is their daddy-o.” Tony winked, running a hand over Steve’s bare chest. He leered for a moment, hopped off, and dragged Steve to the kitchen.
“You big cry baby.”
I love you, too.
Instead, Steve stared at her furrowed brows. Her eyes were green, clear and unwavering. There’s no doubt that she was trying to be his anchor at the moment. He wondered if she was like Tony, who needed the darkness to utter what they couldn’t say in daylight.
The world turned and Steve’s life tilted. Grief was such a powerful reminder of life’s fragility. Even as the serum continued to circulate in his veins, Steve was mortal just like everyone else. He has known loss, all his life, but this was the first time the foundations of his personhood shattered. There’d be no rebuilding, not when half of his world was gone.
“Tony.”
“Of course, it’s Clint.”
He scrubbed a hand over his head, frustrated. It’s been over a fucking year. A year was nothing. 12-months, 365 days sleeping alone in bed, 8760 hours mulling over the fact that Tony died in his arms.
Steve swallows. His jaw works, clenching and unclenching until it finally settles into something looser. The fire still burns inside him, because this is fucking Steve. He looks at Tony in disbelief, shame. “Even now? Even after —”
Tony intertwines their fingers and brings them to his chest. They both look down to see the wedding band on Steve’s left hand.
Tuesdays were good days—his lucky days.
“Well, it has been awhile.”
Would Steve become anything other than his love for Tony? He didn’t realize until Tony’s death how much his life circled around this tiny universe, in the speck of it all, named Tony Stark. Maybe it was wrong to anchor your entire personhood to just two identities: father and husband—no, widower now.
The serum cured his medical ailments, but it did nothing for a grieving widower. He felt like he’s been trapped in a burning building ever since Tony’s cancer came back. His heart and ribs felt like they were trapped under a concrete. Every breath felt like it was his last.
Everything was fine.
It's still me, Tony, Steve had said. A better version, a stronger man.
“I’m pretty sure FRIDAY has already alerted him the moment you drove through the gates. You can ask him yourself.”
Bruce smiles and takes Steve’s hand into his grip, then leaves.
In the morning, Steve goes on to make three pots of coffee for the entire team, knowing he’ll have to make another two pots to satisfy these veteran superheroes. Just as he’s about to pull out the large French press, Bucky and Sam grab him by the arms and pull him out the door.
He could still leave.
“You need to let them be there for you. Or else, you’ll all struggle. Have you thought about seeing a therapist?”
“Steve.” Tony sat beside him, eyes on the monitor.
They’re not even worth chasing anymore.
“All fine, just like that?”
“Why?”
Steve sighed, not sure what to do. He looked up the ceiling, wishing that Tony was somehow immortalized as an AI so he could get advice on their kids.
Steve splutters. “We’re entertaining!”
Steve smiled at the arms in his middle. He laced their fingers, staring at their matching wedding bands. Tony rocked his erection on Steve’s back.
“Did you wake me up just for this?” He juts out his jaw, wishing Steve would hit him until he’s dead.
“No, Tony, baby, please, wake up, please. Don’t leave me. Don’t leave the kids. Don’t, Tony, please. Open your eyes.”
There's this hint of bitterness in his eyes, the way he carries tension in his shoulders, the grim line of his mouth. Steve's body is draped over Tony and he’s jabbing a gloved finger on Tony’s face.
It was unfair to his kids.
Tony recedes into the little void Steve’s yet to gnawn.
“No, sir. He’s hideous! With green skin, fangs, and long wide ears.”
He’s used to that by now. This isn’t any different.
On and on, and the world keeps turning.
Tony protested when Steve removed his hand and pulled off. Tony grabbed his arm, setting it back over his head. “Comfort me, I’m helpless with a fractured rib.”
Steve was suspended in animation for seventy years but this was the first time he understood the notion of slow death. Day by day, a little part of him vanished.
Steve shoved a hand to his mouth and bit hard on his knuckles until he tasted blood on his mouth. “Alright, alright. Tony, baby, alright.” He returned to the sofa, breathing hard, trying to calm his racing heart.
Steve pads close at the sign of permission and sits on the foot of the bed. He’s rock hard. His pants are so tented that it should be uncomfortable, but he ignores it to look at Tony’s heavy balls, the shine of the ring attached to it. Steve wants to lick it back and forth, wants to twirl his tongue in circles and discover what feels good for Tony.
Natasha laughs. “It’s too easy to do that. To have it easy. Why do you think we’re still here? Because we can’t live with the fact that sometimes it could be easy. We don’t know how.We just don’t.” Then, more somber, she shakes her head and confesses, “ I don’t know who I am without this family.”
“Rogers.” Tony takes him in, face heating at the use of his given name in public. “Alright, okay, alright,” he repeats again and again.
“Served in Vietnam,” the man adds. “You in town long?” The man turns back to Steve and offers a sheepish smile, gone is the quick distrust from earlier. It’s replaced with pleasantness instead. “I got a friend who’s washer and dryer isn’t working… and getting it fixed by Tony Stark would mean an awful lot. A whole lot to us townsfolk, you know.”
to me. But there’s only one thing I can say,” he choked, his vision blurry. Morgan wiped at his tears as Peter shoved over and held them all together. “He loved you. And you’re the best part of him. Of us. And leaving was the hardest thing he’s ever done. He didn’t want to go. He didn’t. He wanted to watch all of you grow up. We — we were supposed to grow old together.”
“Haven’t you been, though?” It replies, gently. It pushes Tony’s hair back. “I could be anything you want.”
He tugs my cock. It’s the body’s natural response to get hard due to stimulus. Sometimes, I think I like this. No, no, I have lines. I’m a character. I love this.
They both hold onto artifacts, old hobbies. Learned behaviors that are difficult to shake away.
Tony was  a scientist, but he wasn’t good at measuring the quality of men, especially when the point of analysis was himself. Steve was Tony's point of comparison, and he didn't know where he placed in that grace, always running after the future, measuring his decisions, imperfections, complete fuck ups against Steve's ideals.
He’d try. Steve was trying, even if the effort meant letting go of things he wished to carry for the rest of his life.
They’d never had the former. Tony used to be satisfied with the latter.
No, best not to think about that. He nodded, determined, and forced his lips to turn up higher.
When will he stop searching for Tony across the dinner table? The other end of the table remained empty and without a plate for every breakfast, every dinner. When will he stop searching for Tony’s warm body in the middle of the night? When will he stop padding to the workshop to lure to bed only to remember that the lab has remained empty for the last year?
But all he says is, “It does you know, somehow. I saw that. There was a —“ He cuts off, abruptly realizing that he had so much to say about what he’s seen: how people continue to love despite all the misgivings in the world.
The rest of the world is stitching itself back together, and little by little, Tony’s rebuilding his team. Riri, Kate’s, and Bruce’s dedication is evidence of that.
He needs to piss.
He opens the curtains, watching the lights from the streets turn off, one by one. He doesn’t know what to do with his hands. He’s so used to throwing the shield, even if it’s been years since he’s last picked it up. Drawing has always provided him respite, but it doesn’t come easy these days.
Tony twisted up, tilting forward to kiss Steve. It hurt to know how much energy the simple task required. This was Tony Stark, Iron Man, yet here he was, struggling to live because his body wouldn’t cooperate. It couldn’t sustain him.
He bottoms out, circling his hips as he looks for Tony’s sweet spot. At least he’ll make Tony feel good.
They stay there, in the quiet, until they finish their sticks.
“Here’s our Hawkeye.” Tony points to Kate. “She’s a master shooter.”
“Salty,” Tony counters easily but also finishes his plate. He leans against the winged back chair, arms across his chest, a look of curiosity on his face. “I was wondering…”
He knew in the morning there would be work to be done, difficult discussions to be had, but for now, he sunk deeper into the comfort of Steve hovering above him, kissing the tears from his eyes.
“No.” Tony made the move to pull at his hair, only Steve caught his wrists. His fingers were warm and they tightened on his pulse points. He paused, feeling bile rise from his throat. “What am I supposed to do now — what am I — why are you here?”
It’s only when he’s standing behind Tony does he realize that he’s walked over. “I,” Steve tries, not knowing what to say. “I don’t know.”
Because damn it, he was going to live to see his children graduate from college. He’d be there for every heartbreak, every wedding, every engagement party. Steve will live to see all the smiles. One day, he’d have grandchildren and he'd cherish and dote on them in the same way he knew Tony would have done.
“Tony,” Steve chokes up. “I — thank you.”
Body burnt.
“Yeah, she’ll like that,” Steve started at the abandoned garden and mentally listed some of the items he’ll need to cultivate it.
For Steve, sleep doesn’t come for a long time.
“I’m sorry. I thought, well, back then, I thought I shouldn’t have it anymore.”
“I’m here, telling you everything I never wanted to say. Never wanted to speak about, Tony. I love you.”
A hand reaches for Steve’s menu. Fingers scarred with burns and cuts. No ring. Just nails trimmed short and neat, clean despite all the work Tony does with his hands. Steve follows the line of his veins on the back of his hand to the dust of soft hairs on his wrist, up his strong forearms, his shoulders, then finally, his eyes meet Tony’s own in question.
“Cap, we fought a handful of battles together and saved the world, yeah, but you don’t need to mother hen me. Don’t worry so much.”
“You showing up here in the middle of the night. I must be dreaming.” Tony leered, dragging his eyes from the top of Steve’s head to the tip of his toes, then back again. “I’m assuming this isn’t a social call?” Tony rolled his eyes then waved Steve further into the penthouse.
Carol snapped the pipe grip on the head of the nail and pulled until the nails released. She repeated the process on the rest of his fingers and on his wrists. Blood dripped in increments. It was only when Carol reached his forearm that Tony realized she was crying.
Shortly after Tony strips off the suit, Steve shows up.
“We just have to go through it, Steve. We can’t predict how we’ll feel until we get to that moment.”  Natasha linked their arms and led him out of the Compound.
Steve stood beside her, learning against the counter. “I never did things that were easy. I’ll never learn.”
The words come out in a quiet rush, but Steve hears it all the same. There’s a roaring in his ears, so overwhelming that he almost stops the car right then and there, in the middle of the highway.
“Don’t I always.” Steve snorted. He led Tony back to his dick. “Come here, I’ll fuck your face. You don’t have to work so hard, honey. You already do that.”
And somehow, now none of that matters.
Ok, let me tell you about what happened.
Steve walks along the bright-light halls. He used to think that the Compound was too cold, too empty of personality with its sleek lines and grayscale walls. He used to think it was like the exterior of the Stark Tower, stoic and untouchable. But Steve’s always been the outsider, a simple pedestrian looking at the skyscraper from the street.
Steve murmurs platitudes that are densely veiled threatens, and it’s a study on living in the edges of depravity and false gentleness. He settles a hand under Tony’s knees and carries him to a new room.
Now, she’s got her face plastered to the truck’s window, causing condensation which blows and draws a tiny heart before pointing at the melting snowcaps. Steve smiles, indulging her by driving down the winding roads and taking the long way home.
He held the plate too hard. There was broken glass all over the stacks of dishes now.
When the car is finally empty and running the track back to Midtown, Steve begins to cry.
Tony snorted, playing with the hem of his t-shirt. Steve tried to drag his eyes away from his bare feet. There was something about being in Tony’s space, his home, that made him realize that Tony Stark wasn’t just the CEO of SI or Iron Man. Well, Steve’s always separated the two, but thus far, he’s only caught glimpses of Tony Stark.
Half of Tony's body falls forward, but the chains don't let him get far. Steve's dragging his ass back, silently, forcing Tony to fuck his tongue, soothing the tension growing in his stomach.
“Tony. He’ll help. He’ll understand.” Steve wasn’t sure if he was forcing himself or Natasha to believe that.
“Been there done that, young man.”
“Yes, you will, baby.” Tony said in a low, raspy voice. He still has his eyes closed, but at least there was a soft smile on his face.
They just finished a short mission in Connecticut and were happy-drunk from victory. Not every mission was successful and those were the worst, especially when Tony would lock himself in the Compound’s workshop. Bad days were far and between. But maybe that’s just because Steve was happy. Married, loving life.
He’s plating the pasta and humming a tune.
He couldn’t recall the conversation. He was too distracted by the promise of belonging somewhere, a team, even if it meant secret missions and being a military guard dog.
Morgan wipes his stupid face with her tiny little hands. “You’re my family, simple as that.”
His children found him, crying and howling at the world a few hours later.
“Sure do.” Steve kissed the puckered hole then stood. “Come on, let’s get you dressed.”
Steve has seen it. Before. Maybe he didn't deserve it then.
It’s been a while.
In a blink of an eye, Tommy stands beside Kate Bishop and Cassandra Lang. They laugh and cheer Kate on as she pulls off her bow and arrow.
“And what if I do?” Steve challenged.
“Someone had to, if not, we’d all starve,” he offers easily before turning to Steve, suddenly serious. “I’ve had time to think and figure out what I want. I know myself now. Half the world is missing, so are Riri’s parents. They depend on me, you know, I have to learn how to do things. Adult things. I tell them good job. Make sure they do their homework. I have to cook us meals. Have regular hours. I can’t spend night and day in my room getting drunk because I’m grieving.”
But all Tony sees is white when the room shifts and the files from the tablet are projected onto the wall.
It's been too long since Steve's seen him like this, unreserved and a little bit more at ease. Maybe it's all just about exposure therapy, Steve thinks darkly. Maybe Tony can get used to him again, and if he does, maybe he won't turn away from Steve, maybe his gaze would linger a beat longer.
The sheets were new, pulled to the corners and pristine. The tools were placed in a bag against the wall. The nail gun was nowhere in sight.
All in all, Pepper did what Steve didn’t have the energy for.
“You’ll have to recover. The doctor will need to sign you off before you go back to the field.”
“That was then, this is now.” Tony says, “Maybe it takes the end of the world, rock bottom, for me to finally realize. I apologize that it took me so long.”
“Hey, pops. We didn’t touch anything...just uh, the armors.” Peter popped up from behind a suit. It was Mark XLVII. Tony worked on a couple years ago, before the recurrence. It was sleek with silver plating and had an advanced laser system. He built the Iron Legion as a precursor measure for any work catastrophe too. Even in death, he's still the hero.
“Damn, didn’t know I mattered that much to you. Is my life worth more than theirs?”
I want to gouge them out just to see how he’d react. I wonder what he’ll break this time.
He is used to the heaviness in his chest now, and perhaps, the weight is a permanent marker, like every death he’s seen in the war in his own time, and then, in the wars he’s waged after waking up.
matter was gone.
They stayed like that for a while. The sound of the machines lulling them. Eventually, Tony made room for Steve on the bed, but with all of his big bulkiness, Steve's body was hanging off the bed.
Tony would rather die now, but he can’t even make that decision.
He quizzes me on how we met, how the Avengers found him all those years ago. He asks me, “Do you remember the first words we said to each other?”
The workshop is filled with smoke, and his fingers ache from moving the machinery. He can use a drink, but all the bottles have been dumped and he paid off the saloon to cut him off their supply.
Samuel whips out a John Players Silver. "A friend crossed through months ago and left me a carton," Samuel says by explanation. He flips the lid and offers Steve a stick.
“You think?”
“No need.” Tony waves them off, attention solely on the machinery in front of him. “A cup of coffee will do.”
Whoever said love was tragic didn’t get it right.
be home, because this is temporary. A wish fulfilled in an inverted way. Nothing can take root here because it isn’t permanent and Steve would be stupid to think otherwise.
Steve watches Rumiko maneuver around, grabbing the bottle of lube and squeezing the bottom of the dildo as she pulls out. It makes a salacious sound. She croons—puts one hand on her cock, adjusts her stance—and then she’s mounting Tony, fucking him faster and faster until the only sound in the room is Tony’s moans, his breathy voice as he begs to come.
He could never get the taste right, anyway.
Tony wakes with a jolt and a blistering headache. He fell asleep when the sun rose.
“Fuck, alright, alright.” Steve lifts Tony’s hips up higher, practically twisting him in half, and shoots his load. “I’m coming. Tony, I’m coming. Fuck.” He keeps rocking and Tony’s heart doubles in size because there’s Steve’s come inside him, marking him. He feels it all the way up to his belly and he clenches to keep Steve there.
Tony groans. “I can’t deal with all this social media stuff of Spider-Man and the Torch kissing all over greater New York. On the Statue of Liberty? Really?”
“It has been too quiet here these past couple of weeks without America.” The other girl with thick curly hair puts her hand on her chin and smiles at Steve.
“The next time you disobey, next time you try to fight me, I’ll pluck Hawkeye’s eyes off.”
And it’s then, when he glances back at Clint’s lifeless body does he see it.
“You’re not alone. Remember that, Steve.” She squeezed his shoulder then fixed his tie. Battle ready, again. When could they stop making every day into something that’s a warpath?
Monday mornings means waking up extra early so Tony can fly her to school. Sometimes they’re late because Tony flies her through the mountain, letting her fingers glide over the pines. Steve always stands on the veranda, watching the suit form over Tony’s body, and Morgan strapping herself to her father’s armour.
Steve looked up and down his body, appreciating Tony’s defined shoulders, his strong biceps, and the lazy, charming grin on his face. His hair was a mess. It was perfect.
“No, no. Sorry, I’m being mean aren’t I?” He crosses the room and places the containers on the small circular wooden table. It’s vintage, carved out from pine and crafted locally, if the card on the side of the table is to be believed.
“Can you heal yourself, please?”
Steve bit his lip. She was right. “No, it’s alright.” He swallowed. “You’re right. That’s what he said—Tony, you all know—” he struggled to get the words out, to refer to his husband to people who didn’t actually know him. “I shouldn’t just live for my kids, that’s not right. He said that it’s not over. That our ending was happy too. I have to be happy. He told me — he made me promise that I’ll be okay. But I… I don’t know how to accept that I won’t see him again if it’s not in my dreams. My memory. It isn’t happy now. He said—we had a happy ending. But it wasn’t that. That wasn’t how I remember it.”
“So what? So I can throw the shield around the lake?”
Steve will never get to experience that.
He falls into the lure of watching Steve Rogers make himself at home in this mess.
He makes himself feel better by reminding himself that Tony does the same thing. The only one who have a sense of moderation when it comes to her are Pepper and Rhodey. But even then, it’s short lived, and Morgan gets what she wants. It’s true, she’s spoiled, but she’s also generous and doesn’t ask for what she doesn’t need.
Steve exhaled, willing his heart to calm down. He took the dirty dishes, ran them under the water, then began scrubbing. He liked the smell of lemon dish soap. Tony hated it; it reminded him too much of cleaners and bleach. He always scrunched his nose and begged off drying the dishes, insisting that he’d entertain the kids instead. Couldn’t Steve please just do the drying too? After Steve put the dishes away, his little family would be on the couch, all on top of each other, allured by Tony.
Eventually, Steve gets up, mumbling something about getting a washcloth and cleaning up. Tony watches Steve heave himself up and enter the bathroom. Feeling heavy, he rises and follows. Inside, Steve offers him a small smile and makes a move to rub at the dried come and spit on Tony’s torso.
i think you liked that name.
He and Tony weren’t meant to be apart, dammit. Steve’s a God-fearing man, call him traditional or romantic, but he believed that if he had to die, it would be just right after Tony.
Tony exhaled. His Adam's apple bobbed. Then suddenly, he laughed. Steve’s a little proud of that predictable line. Tony’s smiling as he pressed their lips together.
He didn’t even know what the hell he was doing there. But it was his only thread to the future, a starting point. Maybe he’d figure out what he wanted to do. What he wanted in this life.
“Well, I’ll say it everyday until you believe me.”
“Pops, we know how biology works. You and dad got a surrogate, obviously.”
She stared at Tony, her wide blue eyes filled with tears. Even in death, she looked defiant, as if this was the only choice left.
Natasha held his gaze for a moment. She had always seen past his defenses. There wasn't a wall that Agent Romanoff couldn’t penetrate. This time, Nat didn’t bother him with platitudes.
“Xan is so good, good,” Tony hums, a smile on his face.
“Sam’s Captain America now,” Steve replies, ignoring Tony’s raised eyebrow.
What did they know? Nothing.
This Steve of the returned tries to make him happy by bringing him food, spending the night with Tony in his arms. He warms the bath and makes a pot of coffee every morning. He cheers the townsfolk, assists in matters at the station and in the town hall. He does favors all around town, chats with the kids. Sternly tells Tommy and Kate to stay away from the dam.
“But it’s dad’s favorite song,” Morgan protested, standing in between the record player and Steve with one hand on her hips.
He could grieve forever if he wanted to. Everyone needed to just shut their damn mouths and let him
Steve didn’t bristle or fall to his knees. He didn’t stand down, goddamnit, because people need him
“Ha, so it’s evident, isn’t it?” Tony laughs.
“Never said that.”
Steve’s fingers knead his neck, bringing his face to suck again. Tony groans, flattens his tongue, licking and bobbing up and down. He’s so incredibly hard, the sound of blood rushes through his ears, and there’s just Steve. Steve. Steve. Spit trickles down his beard, onto his chin, and he feels the wetness hit his thighs. Steve groaning and praising him like they don’t have an ocean of problems between them. They’re not stupid enough to believe a good fucking will solve it all.
He didn’t know how much time passed. His ring finger was bare and there was a tan line on where it used to be.
“I had this made just for you,” Steve says, and points at the door on the far wall. “I’m just right there if you need me.”
It wasn’t bad. It could have been worse. Tony could have died.
Sometimes it showed up, sometimes it didn’t.
Then, a click.
It comes and goes for Steve these days.
He dropped to his knees, swallowing. “We’ll be alright, baby.” He coughed, attempting to get rid of the lump on his throat. “I’ll miss your battle cry, Shellhead.”
This was the natural order of things, both of them screaming until their throats were filled with terror for all the half-lies they’d spoken, and then kissing, as if hurt and pain were simply a rite of passage to obtain something more sublime.
The next time he woke up, someone was prying the balcony doors open. A quick snap of the wrist and the handle broke. Carol stepped inside, body framed by the setting sun.
Families and college students have begun filling up the cabins and the resorts further north. Around town, there will be out-of-towners milling about, asking for directions. Oftentimes, they stop by Iz's with their SUVs packed with skiing gear, seeking a warm meal. Today, Tony makes a fuss that their usual booth is taken, so Iz packs them a to-go box with extra salsa and they head back home.
“Hey, Steve. Do you wanna be called Papa? I’ll be dad.” Tony turned to him, a huge smile on his face. He was dazzling, the portrait of a happy man.
Sometimes, the answers were never enough, so he’d go off and sit in the balcony of their old, moldy apartment and observe the way people stared at the sky, how they carried themselves, the way their tones would change depending on who they were talking to. He’s tried his best to capture the workings of the city, individual by individual, and all the sketch books studying the city-dwellers are now gone, with his mother’s favorite rosary and bible.
“No good smoking in front of kids.” Steve gestures to the alley a few feet away and plants his back on the brick wall. It smells like rotten food, and there’s the distinct smell of animal carcass, but it’s surprisingly tidy with the trash bins all organized further down.
“Tommy, grab them and tie them,” Red Wolf commands.
He’s sitting on a plush, winged back chair, legs spread, hands on folded on his lap. There’s a tray with a jug of water and an empty glass beside him.
“Well, you look good with it discarded.” Steve bent down to kiss Tony’ chest, then grabbed Tony’s cock. He set a slow pace with loose fists, watching the pleasure on Tony’s face.
The last time he saw Tony was during a SHIELD debrief six months ago. Iron Man was called in to assist with a mission in the Southwest. It was sort of jarring for Steve to see Iron Man in battle again, flying in the air, the blue of the sky a stark contrast with the red and gold of the suit. The vivid colors were made brighter by the sun, looking hard and untouchable.
He checked the functionality of Extremis because he was not invincible and he’d never tried to be anything other than human, but sometimes desperation meant injecting yourself with a reality check — that you weren't like them and you couldn’t do much outside of the armor. Without it, you were a vulnerable piece of shit, just like the rest of this sorry world.
He’s being pulled up into Steve’s arms, and Tony’s body follows because it knows Steve, it knows what Steve wants, it knows what to do next. They’re kissing again, scrubbing at the nape of each other’s neck. Tony kisses him with worrying demand because if this is the last time, he might as well be greedy. Steve’s pulling off, both hands on the hem of Tony’s t-shirt, then urging him to put his hands up. Shirt gone, Tony toes off his shoes, unbuttons his pants, kicking it off with his boxers.
Perhaps, that’s what happens when you think you’ve lost the one thing that kept you from blowing your brain out. Funny, though, drinking was just slow ingested poison, Tony wasn’t a man, or even half a person when drowning himself in the bottle.
“Harley,” Peter warned, sitting up. “Stop that, now. You’re being an ass.”
“Ugh, Steve, I just put Maguna down. Just hold me and give me a blowjob and stop nagging, baby.”
“Just a few weeks.” Steve shoves both hands into his jacket. It’s too warm to keep on, but he doesn’t take it off. “Not long enough to appreciate the differences in the region, I suppose.”
“What you’ve done is more than enough.”
I don’t…” Harley was fuming now, hot tears spilling from his face before he stood up, shrugging Bucky’s hand off. “Why do you have to do that, pops?”
But sometimes they do, Steve. We all do. It’s what we deserve.
“Sure, blame everything on DUM-E or Butterfingers.” Harley stuck out his tongue.
“Steve —“
The first meeting was shit. He was a quiet, brooding face that marked him as newly widowed to some long time attendees. The second meeting was also shit. The third meeting was awful and he walked out into the back alley and punched the brick wall.
The sun beamed high and the scent of their come mixed with the smell of the flowers and herbs in the garden. He turned to Tony, amazed at his strength—that they have a life together. He was like a garden nymph. Dark haired, bright-eyed, and beautiful.
It’s true. Tony’s the best of them. The best at breaking Steve’s heart, too.
“I keep thinking, we were Avengers, superheroes. We should have plans, strategies to prepare for loss. But it doesn’t work like that, does it, Nat?” Steve examined the sitting room. This was a place he and Tony built together.
Steve woke, alert, to the dipping mattress. Harley came to his back and held his neck with his tiny hands, sobbing. Peter was on the foot of the bed, face red, sniffing. He looked at Steve with pure anguish.
It’s simple and easy.
Beside him, Natasha ducks down to grab something from the ground and then taps Steve’s chin.
Tony snorts. “It’s hella a lot better than Reeds swearing he’s just returned from space.”
Half the world disappears. Half the world continues living.
Somehow, between missions, commissions, and serving as SHIELD's director, I was able to pick up a book. An old one I read long ago. I found a copy in the library at the Avenger's Mansion. Somehow, the battered copy still survived. You're probably wondering why I was there. Well, is it too nostalgic to say I miss who I used to be before all of this...this mess. I made my choices, it's done. But anyway, Steve, you and your speeches. It was never my strong suit, that was always you. So let me tell you what Baldwin said: “There is often something beautiful, there is always something awful, in the spectacle of a person who has lost one of his facilities, a faculty he never questioned until it was gone, and who struggles to recover it.”
The man who let him into the entrance is back and on the porch, smoking again. He doesn’t even pay attention to Tony or Steve.
“Do you like it?”
“Oh, good morning.” Tony leaned closer, letting out a breath he didn’t know he was holding. His heart slotted back in place as Steve waved the bag. “I thought you had left.”
Soon they’ll both have to get up and start their nightly routine. Steve will climb up one side of the bed, and Tony will climb the other. He’ll be pulled close, and he’ll hold Tony in his arms and whisper their way of saying I love you.
Steve only beats me when I’m awful or I jut out my jaw and pretend I’m above the law.
“It’s not,” he looks up at the sky, then back at Steve. “Haven’t seen you around here. I usually know all the dwellers by the beach.”
When they reach town, there are screams from the Walter household. Jessica Drew is in the corner of the room, crying beside Rhodes and Mayor Danvers.
Love is like jumping down the cliffs and hoping that Iron Man swoops in to catch him.
"Nowhere." Steve shakes his head. “Sorry about that.”
He doesn’t visit Tony at nightfall. He doesn’t push. He stays a polite distance. Curious, but unaffected.
He doesn’t move, trying instead to catalogue Tony’s response: the rise and fall of his chest, the sweat on the valley of his back, the way he makes a soft noise when Steve squeezes his hips—
He opened the case and gave Tony the files he smuggled out of SHIELD. Fuck Fury and whatever he has to say, Tony deserved to know.
“You’re rich, you can buy another, sweetheart.” Steve took his shirt off and threw it over his shoulders. His jeans and boxers soon followed.
All Tony feels is heat blooming from his cheeks to his nape, quickly followed by a sharp cold that makes its way to his belly and toes.
He swallows the bile rising from his throat. No, Steve’s right. Save the fighting for outdoors, when they’re both wearing their masks, sporting their uniforms. Tonight is something else. Steve is in street clothes, his jeans are pressed perfectly and a little faded, like a reminder that they’re both human, persons who can be someone else without the code names, titles, and public positions.
Instead, Tony gathers his failing courage—maybe it’s recklessness—he leans forward, sucks his tongue, then spits on Steve’s face.
He pins my body to the bed and grinds his growing erection on my hip. He murmurs with sleepy eyes how much he loves me, how he’s so thankful we made it work past SHRA, how much he misses me every time he has to go do duties as Commander.
“Yeah, I got everything,” Steve lies. There’s a crippling sadness he can’t think about.
“Because then we’ll never stop.”
It turns out they don’t have to go out of town because the dead greet them at the entrance.
Tony reaches behind him, pumping Steve’s cock and rubbing at the head before positioning it over his hole. He’s loose and Steve can easily slide in, but Tony makes him work for it. Steve’s always up for the challenge. They kiss and rock their bodies together until finally, Tony grinds just right and the head of Steve’s cock slips in.
He’s missed a lot, and he doesn’t know how to apologize for leaving.
The barkeeper returns. His apron is caked with the smell of dried gin, and somehow, it reminds Steve of that time he and Tony shared a bed in Clint’s old farmhouse.
“See what,” Tony barks out, irritated at the way Red Wolf’s face twists.
He started breakfast, cooked up oatmeal, cut up fruit, and readied a packed lunch for the kids. They rose from their rooms in waves. Morgan’s first, hopping up to the counter to watch Steve make Harley’s sandwich.
In a moment of recklessness, Steve doesn’t think, he lets his mouth do the talking. Consequences be damned. He’s been rejected by the army dozens of times. He’ll survive Tony Stark telling him to fuck off.
“That doesn’t cost anything,” Steve says, words coming out before he had a moment to think them through. He grimaces. “Well.”
, Steve, dragging Sharon back into his mess. Steve’s only wanted one thing since he’s woken up from the ice, and that’s to belong and have someone, honestly and wholeheartedly. No doubt, no remorse, no guilt. Something ordinary, and easy, where he doesn’t have to explain that he enjoys getting his face beaten in, that he feels alive in every fight.
"Better than that flophouse in Bowery, huh, Cap?" He tried to lift his lips into a semblance of a smirk. But grimaced instead, head pounding.
Tony’s mouth was dry and his head hurt. He couldn’t feel his toes. Despite the duvet over them, he felt cold. He was close to losing it again. He wanted nothing more than for Steve to be gone.
Tony met his pace, moaning. “Always. I’m always thinking of you.”
He settles further into his yellow plastic chair, trying to map out where to go next. A week and a half in Marrakech and he decided to go to the Bay, after a month in the mountain towns. His pocket-sized notebook  has a map of the globe in its front and back pages. Suddenly, the world seems small. He's taken to shading countries he's been through. Over half the map is shaded and it serves as brief comfort that there's still more to do -- more of the world to see and learn from.
He turned back to his friends—family—they all appeared to be waiting for him to say something. Steve had nothing to say unless it was to describe the emptiness of living. Waiting.
Sobriety might be the only thing he has left.
Inside the hotel, the receptionist greets them with a smile. “Ah, good, you found him!”
Tony had shut those thoughts away in a corner of his brain, labeled it as an error. Steve would never look back, and there’s never been time for dreaming when the world suffered crisis after crisis. Not when Tony was running, rebuilding himself, planning to destroy planets, wiping Steve’s memories. This must be the punishment Steve never allowed himself to give.
Tony doesn’t say. He’s holding back a lot these days.
Tony swallows, around Steve’s fingers, and bites them as they withdraw. “Isn’t that what you wanted?”
That’s all it takes for Tony to pummels himself forward and swallow Steve down. He moans, shivering, putting one hand to pull at Steve’s thighs, the other, bringing Steve’s hand to his head. It’s been too long since he’s tasted Steve, felt him, was this close to him without yelling or bracing for a fight. Steve’s cock is a little salty and the wiry blond hairs that tickle his nose. Tony loves it, all of it, Steve, handsome and masculine, the smell of his musk, the sound of his encouraging groans sets Tony to work harder. Pushing to his limits until Steve’s hitting the back of his throat at increasing speed.
He claws at his arms. Half-moon crescents etched into the creases of his elbows.
The restaurant is nearly empty. All the patrons are likely in bed, at home, with the family and friends they still have. But the place is open for another hour.
It didn’t use to be like this.
Local papers dedicated spreads of Iron Man’s superhero activities while the
Steve unlaced the oxfords with quick, efficient hands, then pried Tony’s pants completely off. Now, Tony stood over him, bare from the waist down, dress shirt rumpled, and tie askew. He looked gorgeous and he was Steve’s.
“God, no,” Peter cries, dropping to his knees. “Let her go, please.”
It was just after six-thirty. The kids were still asleep and wouldn’t be up to get ready for school for another hour.
Tony isn’t the only one losing anything here. Even if it feels like it. He mutters words he can’t remember. All that matters is Steve, pleasing him, making him feel good, whole, and loved. He’s never cared so much about where he’ll be at the end of this fight, but there’s only one thing that haunts his thoughts: the fact that he might lose Steve. Steve, Steve, Steve. Another planet of problems. A universe full of love.
“I only did that because I knew you wanted chickens. You practically built a hen-house the same day. Only sprung this up on you because you’d rise to the occasion.”
he thinks. He bites his lips and doesn’t share the rest of his thoughts. He doesn’t want to upset her tonight. Steve leans back against the sofa attempting to ignore the rising despair in his chest.
“Nothing’s permanent. You’ll meet again.”
Steve’s thick cock springs free from his boxers—and one that Tony gave him—slightly crooked, but huge, and Tony drools for it. He needs it in his mouth, inside him. Tony traces the bulging vein, index finger running up and down the shaft to play with the leaking slit. Steve’s gorgeous, period. He’s so many things: hero, idol, man. Public, observed by the world.
Tony hesitates, unsure and angry at himself for not being certain. He mourned Steve for months, cried himself to sleep with the memory of Steve. Gave up the bottle because if he wasn’t a drunk, then maybe he could fight. Could have shot Bullseye.
“That’s not what we meant, Steve.” Carol cut in, voice soft, attempting to diffuse the situation. Fuck, he always had to make things worse didn’t he. His temper came in waves, usually drowning him in rage whenever he had to put up with this bullshit. “We meant that you could use some time off to process everything. It’s just. You just threw yourself into caring for the kids, managing the Avengers again. You need—”
Even with our choice of careers, I’ve always thought we had time. Maybe I think you were invincible because I look up to you, Steve. An inspiration to all of us. But here you are, gone, buried in the depths of the ocean once again. Namor promised you’ll be undisturbed. Rest easy, old friend.
A hologram screen appeared from the coffee table. Tony stood with a burst of energy, then, he barked orders at JARVIS, mumbling to himself, then glaring at Steve before slapping the screens left and right. He read intently and kept notes with JARVIS help.
Steve’s never known him other than a quick spar in an airport field. There’s an unoccupied desk in the east corner of the workshop. There's an empty beaker, a half curled tong, and several test tubes lying organized in racks. The table is pristine, and behind it lies a glass cabinet with a warning sign containing more chemicals.
It’s funny how they said death was personal.
Tony dropped them a dry field.
Sometimes, it roars, so much so it’s nearly white noise these days. Yet, there are moments tinged with joy, and blinding light. Sangre de Cristo Mountains, Tony had said, flying them over a peak of mountains, Blood of Christ.
“I’m sorry. Sir, also programmed the recording’s deletion.”
Tony followed Steve through the turnstile and waited for the 1 train to arrive. He walked to the edge of the platform, leaning over to look at the tunnel.
“Ok, fine. Yes, of course, I’m angry.”
The waters are clear, a cerulean color towards the shore, a deeper navy towards the horizon where it meets the sky and bleeds into it seamlessly. It stretches further and further, so much so that Steve is struck with the idea that this is just the horizon. There’s the sky above it, the rest of the sea under. His mind flashes to a million different hues of blue: the sky surrounded by high rise buildings, only, the view is from above, as if he's soaring up the sky, catching a lift back to the Tower, hands around Iron Man’s plated shoulders.
“Yes, please, yes. Stretch me open, please.” Tony groaned, throwing an arm over his eyes. “Steve, come on please. I think I’m still full of your come, I’ll be fine. Fuck me, come on.”
“That’s Rogers-Stark to you,” Tony pinched Steve’s side with a mock-glare. “I’ve settled down long ago, baby, with this gorgeous man named Steve.”
There’s a baby’s cry.
“That ain’t your uncle, Pete,” Johnny says, still flying high, in flames.
“Captain Rogers, huh?”
Steve closes his eyes, dropping his head to Tony’s neck—smelling him, holding him tight, wishing for a different scenario. Maybe they could both pretend that it’s just sweat dripping from Steve’s face.
The Avengers fell into a semi-domestic pattern. The team trained together once a week. They debriefed missions and rewatched footage to improve their strategies in the field. The Compound felt like home.
“We only have one room left. Two fulls.”
He just did coke half an hour ago, but seems to have worn off. He’s not slurring, but his eyes are still dilated. Tony focuses on him so intensely, it’s confusing. Steve never thought he’d be the center of Tony’s attention.
Always there, orbiting around him, but always too far away for Steve to consider.
“Ok, ok, we’re doing this. I'm not one for big speeches. That's all you, Steve. I know I ramble and I get lost in my thoughts, but you listen and you keep track of what I'm thinking. When I'm gone, away too long, you pull me out." Tony breathes, then there's a soft expression on his face. "I thought I was at the end, you know. That day at the Compound. Fighting beside you, thinking, is this it, am I gonna see my kid? Did I make Cap proud? If this is the end, let me do good.”
Steve didn’t realize that Pepper began leading them to the gardens. Morgan was still in Rhodes’s arms, awake and looking back at Steve.
“Keep in on,” Steve growled.
Don’t fucking judge me, okay. It’s been a goddamn mess.
Life was good—if he didn’t count facing doom and death at least once a week.
“Yeah? Does it feel good, Tony?”
When SHIELD gave him clearance to move to Brooklyn, under the watchful eye of their surveillance tech, he rode the nearly packed F train from Brooklyn to Manhattan. He could have gotten off at any stop and walked the High Line or stop to Coney Island. But he didn’t. He rode the subway for half a day, studying all the people around him.
They both have faith in the team to handle it all, especially now with the Guardians out there watching their orbit, the Fantastic Four setting up shop in Manhattan, and new super powered individuals popping up all over the world.
He knows all too well that Steve would probably hear his whispers. Steve wishes he had the wall to lean against. To account for his shaking knees, he stands even straighter.
“Why,” he croaked, because he didn’t understand. Didn’t he deserve this.
“I don’t know about that,” Steve says, but what he really means is that Samuel’s wrong, it’s not just the world, it’s all of existence, all of life. Maybe that’s not true now, but if Tony ever had the chance to be in Tony’s vicinity, they’d agree.
“Come on, Tony will still love you even if you’re dressed in jeans and nothing but your own sweat.” Bucky punches his arms then steadies Steve. He didn’t even know he was leaning against the dashboard.
At a distance, the sun mindlessly sets across the Spanish coast. Its stoic brightness serves as a reminder of how light captures the distance between them, and despite not knowing where Tony is now, they share the same sky.
Not like this. Never gentle. Never sweet, never without the promise of violence.
Some found Jessica Drew’s kindness unnerving. She used to bicker with the farmers and pickpocket travelers.
steve, steve, steve,
“I’m not Cap anymore.”
Steve pushes forward, learning over to trap Tony with his body. He still can't see Tony's face.
Steve said, and Tony couldn’t determine whether Steve was commanding or begging. “I just want you to be alright.”
“Can you,” Steve starts, hating the self-deprecating tone of Tony’s voice. He’s always been harsh with himself, always thinks he could do better, and he holds himself to an impossible standard. “Can you be gentle with yourself?”
But death was too easy and Tony had many things to atone for. Slow, slow death, that’s what living was all about.
about that right now.” Steve held up a hand, blanching. His eyes were brimming with tears, too.
“I’m here,” Steve says to the space above Tony’s crown.
Steve pauses, shocked, then the weight of her words finally hit him. He cries and cries, and even though Tony sighs and says,
Steve wants Tony’s company, but he can’t find the words to make him stay. “Goodnight.”
Pepper covered his left hand, sighing. Her palms warm on his fingers.
The view from above is different. Exhilarating, and Steve was overjoyed that he could have this. Memories cannot be replaced, but new ones can be made.
It isn't difficult. It's meant to feel good.
Steve frowned at that.
“Okay, good.” Tony eyed him closely for a beat, then seemed to decide on something. He snapped his fingers and a digital keyboard appeared from his watch. He leaned forward, setting his feet to the wooden floors, hands going to the keyboard. “J, hack into SHIELD and copy their files into my personal servers. Filter everything you have on The Winter Soldier and James Buchanan Barnes.”
Small sips, and he feels Steve’s eyes on him. Patient. He keeps Tony’s mouth open, fingers lightly drumming a rhythm on his jawline.
Steve pulls off, bites the inside of Tony’s left thigh. “Then there was you.”
Sometime in the afternoon, Bruce finds him walking the perimeter of the facility.
In quick strides, they’re in their bedroom, miraculously uncaught by Jarvis or any loitering Avenger. But, there’s not much of them here these days. At least, not their newly-minted New Avengers that fell into shambles in a matter of a few short weeks. Logan and Peter can’t smell them.
“We’re Skrulls,” It whispers behind Tony. “Shapeshifters.”
I think she’s disappointed.
He used to do the same exact thing for Tony after his workshop binges. Tony would mumble sleepy about his project and Steve would run his fingers over those curls.
Tony pulled away. He couldn’t show himself. Steve didn’t even want to speak to him. Now, Carol was crying.
Steve wonders if he’s thinking about Spider-Man, and how the kid might befriend the younger heroes, too.
“Yes, yeah,” Tony replies, already turning on the bed only to be stopped by Steve holding his hip down.
“MR. STARK!” Tommy runs full speed, circling them on and on before stopping beside Natasha. “Quickly, Dr. Reed Richards requires your attention at the town hall.”
He slides the balcony doors open, pats his pockets, and opens the cigarette case. He lights the stick and takes a heavy drag.
“Hm?”
There are five pairs of eyes on him, and he almost wants to lecture Natasha about how it’s impolite to throw him here without any back up.
“I’m hungry now.” Tony waves a hand, unaffected, like Steve’s just had a moment of vertigo.
“Can you tell me why you wear his face?”
He could be brave, too.
Tony has no doubt that Steve will make sure of it, but how can you force a sad person to be happy? It doesn’t come easy, especially to those victims of love. What a stupid, trite thing, and yet.
He doesn’t know why.
“Sometimes I wonder if it’s alright that we’re getting them into this. They’re so young.” Natasha offers her hand. Steve goes easy and follows her out the door. “Come on.”
“Alright, alright, okay. Good.” Steve scrubbed the tears on his blotchy face over Tony’s head and neck. Again and again. He couldn’t even wipe his wet face anymore. He listened to the beat of Tony’s heart, holding onto its sound the way someone might try to stop a ticking time bomb.
“Well, I’ve only known you for less than two hours but you saved me from being drugged, so I think you’re alright.”
Rhodes, Carol, Pepper, Bucky, and Natasha stepped into the brownstone’s living room with a mix of unconcerned and neutral expressions, but Steve wasn’t fooled. At least Sam wasn’t with them this time.
“And who is tending to New York?” Steve asks, momentarily concerned.
“Oh my god. Captain America is going to make good on our promise. No one bother us unless there’s a level 5 threat. Wait, nevermind, you guys handle that! New Avengers and all! Me and Steve are retired,” Tony laughs, giddy, pleased, happy, all at once.
He’s doing all this wrong. He’s missing steps. It’s barely noon, and they are on the verge of a row if he doesn’t thread carefully.
“As you wish, sir.” The rooftop shields lift and he hears the busy streets of New York. A cabbie honks and there’s the sound of children giggling below. The sounds washed over him and somehow, in a city filled with millions of people, he felt vulnerable and alone.
He tries to put as much space as possible between them, but Steve rucks up the sheets and pulls Tony to his chest. He hums, murmurs promises, how he’s grateful to be alive, how things will change now that he’s back. How Timely will be much better now that he’s here.
I see the version of you from World War II and I’m reminded of your stupid optimism.
“But maybe having children will change that. Can’t roll the dice on that one.” Tony wrapped an arm around Steve’s waist and pulled him. “Whaddya say, baby? Let’s have an actual baby. You know, the one that cries for you in the middle of the night. One, two, three. How ever much you want.”
“Steve.”
Now, he feels cold and everything hurts.
He knows why.
“Don’t you think it’s harder going through your life denying the fact that you have a place to come home to, Steve?” Bruce sighs and gives him a pained expression.
“Thanks, I wasn’t sure what I wanted.” Steve smiles and traces a star on his empty glass.
Steve glances at Tony in question. The man wears an amused expression and raises his hand as if to say
He sighs. There’s never waiting for the right moment with Natasha. Her knives are well-maintained, and she doesn’t resist pointing them the first chance she gets.
Using his other hand, Steve grabbed Tony’s ass and lifted them both up into a sitting position. Steve planted his feet to the floor and used the leverage to fuck deeper into Tony.
The song changes to something electronic. Steve’s never heard of it but people all around him start banging their heads and shuffling. Some man gets behind him, getting a hand on his hip. Just as Steve’s about to tell him off, a woman pushes them into the living room. It’s dim with light strobes, sweaty bodies all around him. There’s sand everywhere and it’s like he’s back shooting in the desert, chewing on tobacco, and cursing his unit. Steve pushes to the corner of the room, tracking the movements all around him. Some people are dancing barefoot and up on the second floor, there’s people passing a bong.
steve rogers
That wasn’t really living.
Steve circles the kitchen island and inserts himself between Tony and the seething man.
“I couldn’t bring the tape with me, but I’m sure you can hack into SHIELD and access it.” Steve set the folder in between them. It contained their spotty research on the Winter Soldier and HYDRA up to date. There was a lot of retracted information from SHIELD’s files, but the most important document led evidence to Howard and Maria’s death.
“You must have hit your head, dumbass. It’s not like that between us.”
Tony was wearing a faded yellow t-shirt in big, bold curvy font stating, ACDC. He wasn’t wearing trousers. His red checkered boxers peaked just below the t-shirt. There was a dust of fine hair on his shins and there were stains on his knobby knees. Steve barely had the moment to clear his throat and turn his eyes away from Tony’s legs. He’s seen legs before. He was in the army, for fucks sake.
Late, I know. Everything up to Chapter 8 is written and complete, save the edits. That will also be late. Life is a lot right now. Please be patient with me. I cherish you and your support. Let me know if I made you feel something <3
“Fuck you, Red Wolf,” Tony whispers, itching to scream at him, maybe punch him in the face. He flicks his wrist, but the contraption only reveals a gun, not a flask. “It was never like that.”
Steve examines him the entire time.
“Say no, if you want,” Steve pauses, watching Tony’s glassy eyes. His lips are slick with saliva. The sky is dark, but the lights from the pier dance shadows on his face. “You’re so gorgeous. Say no, tell me no.”
He focuses on the sound of the engine and its rumbling gears, and tries not to think.
“You’re not a mess.”
He wants to run. Nothing new there.
Steve bobs down, flattening his tongue, pulling out to lick at Tony’s balls before sucking him down again. He fucks his fingers deeper, thrusting harder, rubbing at Tony’s prostate.
Tony would say between kisses.
“Put me to work.” There’s no argument or suggestion in his tone.
“You’re something else. Is this the type of thing they teach you in the Army?” Tony has his hands on his hips and he’s smiling and it makes Steve’s heart soar. “How to be a gentleman.”
He’s got his mouth full of cock, he’s taking it so deep, he’s nearly choking, but when he tries to pull off to address the intruders, Tony tugs at Steve’s hair with his prosthetic arm. It’s strong enough to keep Steve in place.
They’ve argued about it every other week.
Steve’s stomach grumbles, and he remembers they didn’t even stop for a late lunch.
On the days the tabby cat didn’t swing by, Steve wondered how the cat fared off, did it get enough food, were they still alive?
Tony’s knees begin to ache, but no matter, he works hard on trying to get Steve off. Steve tugs at his scalp, shifting away and popping his glistening cock out of Tony’s mouth. “Spit,” Steve heaves, abs flexing. There’s that glint of challenge in his eyes, a reminder of how just earlier, Tony spat on his face. “Spit on me.”
Perhaps, he had assumed too quickly that they’ll fall back to old rhythms, after all, they’ve always done well as a team when there was a crisis. But now… but then…
Steve cried, holding her against his chest. “I know, baby, I know. Me too. I’m so sorry, I’m sorry. I’m so damn sorry that you have to go through this. I know. It’s alright, let it out.”
“Alright,” Steve nodded, and led them to the bedroom. “Let’s just stay in today?”
Steve was looking at him in confusion. Tony held his gaze. There were those blue eyes again.
Steve stared at the wicker sofa. It didn’t feel like looking at the end of the world anymore. It was just a place where an ending happened but life kept moving. Steve dropped on the single seat across from it. He didn’t feel as heavy-hearted today, but he’s been feeling threadbare and his limits for so long it hardly mattered.
“I did write,” Steve argues. “Nat, I did.”
“What?” Tony’s hands tense on his sides and he shifts forward. “Sorry, what?”
Delete. Delete. Delete.
Steve pushed past the agents milling around the medical bay, seething. Tony was reckless. Irresponsible. Fancied himself as a goddamn hero. It raked at Steve’s nerves.
They sit outdoors under a huge rainbow umbrella and chatted away. From where he sits, Steve can see Tony down the street. His track suit jacket now lies abandoned on the floor. He’s taken to wiping his sweaty forehead with the end of his shirt, and while people stopped to stare, most people paid him no mind when they realize he wasn’t too focused to engage in a conversation.
Tony knows his answer when Steve pulls his hand back in question.
Not we, not us, he wants to say,
“Baby, I look good in anything.” Tony pulls at the string of Steve’s robes and lets it fall open. “I look better in nothing, though.”
“Hello to you, too.”
“Ah.” Riri nods. Steve can’t tell whether she approves the statement or not.
Drifts.
Out on the street, an ice-cream shop’s lights flicker on and off until one of the shopkeepers finally click it shut and tape an open sign on the door. Kids, some in bikes, some in skateboards, laugh by the streets, hollering, cursing, and laughing.
“Sure, like we all don’t mean what ‘checking something in the back means’ by now,” Rhodey deadpans, rolling his eyes. “For the love of God, Tones.”
Steve,
and that’s all he had left.
Steve reaches over to manually unlock the door.
“I’m gonna tell everyone I met Tony Stark.” The kid smiles for a beat longer, then jogs off to ride his bike once again.
The man turns, a sheepishly smile on his face. God, there’s still sleepiness in his eyes and it’s obvious he hasn’t showered, wearing his clothes from the night before.
Tony isn’t a fool. This isn’t to please him, no, it’s for Steve, because Steve loves to steal groans and curses out of him, fuck his hole until he’s mumbling and incoherent. It isn’t worship, but maybe if Tony closes his eyes and wishes hard enough, maybe it could be. This is for Steve to own him, and Tony will let him.
“I can hear you, Harley. Keep behaving like that and you won’t get your present from us tonight!” Carol rolled her eyes. She made her way to Steve, gave him a half-hug and a brief squeeze on the bicep. “Steve. You look good.”
“I got tired of waiting for you to make a move. So, as one innovative, genius, billionaire, reformed playboy once said, I know exactly what I'm doing.”
Prowling around the roof’s edge was a tabby cat. It’s returned for food.
With a long breath, Steve pulls out of Tony and flips him onto his back.
Tony shudders when Steve removes his fingers. Steve pleads with himself to put an end to this. He should walk away, put his clothes back on, and leave them be.
His memory is usually fuzzy the night after, especially if he goes through a binge. But last night was a light evening. He did lines, had some alcohol, and then Ty and Sunset were dancing beside him. They prodded him into joining them for a swim at the deck, but he didn’t want to set his clothes down. Last time he did that, someone stole his clothes and watch and he had to sit naked in the only cab that would take him.
“Your dad left a message for us. I was thinking we could finally watch it. It’s time, I think,” Steve explained, gesturing the helmet. It gleamed under the workshop’s lights, a sharp red and gold. “Play message.”
Tony doesn’t say anything, though he looks slightly annoyed with how Steve keeps changing the stations. Finally, he stops messing with the stereo and leaves it be. They pass a sign that notes wild animals crossing, and then, there’s another billboard of Amish township miles away. They’ve been in Ohio’s state lines for several hours now, driving miles and miles.
He grabs my head and forces our eyes to meet. It’s the bluest eye.
Steve nods and lets himself be pulled into the conference room that doubles as her office. There’s empty bottles of vodka on the floor and half-eaten granola bars on the edges of the table from earlier today.
“Shower and sleep.” Tony throws a hand, wrists waving him away.
He’ll ask Tony to open his goddamn eyes so he knows it’s Steve. It’s Steve, and it always has been, since the beginning, who loves him, who’ll please him, who’ll fuck him good and cook him eggs in the morning. Because Steve’s willing to stay until the morning, kiss Tony’s eyes open. He wants to see those blue eyes. He’s always been fond of them, tracking them behind the faceplate whenever he’d wondered who was behind the armor.
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Tony barks out a short, ugly laugh. “And you’ll listen?”
“Don’t make me cry when it’s Christmas.” She gave him a jagged grin.
There would be new faces introduced to the family as their children fall in love and bring their partners home, reminding Steve that he lost the love of his life. There would be more holidays and family outings without Tony.
“We’re gonna be family for-real, for-real even though you’re already my pops, but today it’s even more real because there’s a wedding.” She grins. “Now, let’s do this.” She skips through the short walk way before sitting beside Thor.
“Is it really that simple?”
The kids, they’re fine.
He wills himself to get it together. “It’s really you?”
“Aren’t you still angry?” Tony said, his voice sounding small.
Steve resurfaced, looking up around the mess of their living room. There were moving boxes everywhere, several canvases stacked by the wall, and take-out cartons in the half assembled kitchen table.
“Since I was born. My dad
Steve spins the flip phone, once, twice, then pockets it. He digs in his heels and walks to the railing. Below, cars zoom past the highway, so trite and normal, he wonders whether these drivers had a destination in mind, or if their steps are aimless, like Steve’s. Or if their families are home, which kin were dusted, if they were making new life, too.
“How’d you know?” Tony gives him a lazy grin. It’s forced. Steve doesn’t like it.
He wonders if Tony got any sleep. He wonders if he’ll bid Steve goodbye. He stares at the horizon and wonders why he’s crying. He wishes that it will all be alright.
Later, he woke up, not even realizing that he fell asleep. Tony was tucked half on Steve’s shoulder, mouth open. Drooling. It should be disgusting, but his heart stuttered. Tony looked at peace, comfortable. Steve wished to put his arms around Tony.
“But we’re already married,” he says, blinking, once, twice. There’s something stuck down his throat. There are words he’s struggling to get out.
They reach the hotel. The sky is dripping down in patches of blues and oranges. He didn’t realize they spent so many hours out, and night is coming again.
“You have the kids.” Natsha stepped over a ladybug, heels clanking on the wood of the garden’s pathway.
“Why?” He stared at the lines on Steve’s face. There was a new freckle on the edge of his left eye. He wanted to lean over, press his mouth against it. “Why are you being so nice now?”
The memory of their shared kisses as the sun rises—them, two bodies intertwined.
Maybe now they could all finally breathe.
“Is there a difference?” Steve really wanted to know.
Jessica Drew and Walter Lawson walk towards them with open faces.
“So, Barnes, Mexican food. In seventy years, you’ve never had it? You’re missing out, man.” Tony flicked his fingers, urging them all up and out the facility. “Come along, come along.”
Carol and Rhodes looked at each other, speaking in silence.
“Of course, you matter. You’re—important to the team.” Steve stumbled over the words, wishing he was the one sitting on Tony’s bed and pushing his hair back.
They bump into each other.
“Thank you.” He finally looks at her. He’s missed her, and he’s very sorry for leaving her behind.
Steve gripped the edge of his seat before leaning forward to grasp a vine. He ran a fingertip on the leaf. Life kept moving forward. “When’d you get so smart, huh?”
“Just like you, Cap, so bull-headed, running towards death.”
He knows how these things go.
“They’re out there training. Tony says it’s all about routine and moving.” Natasha stops, puts a hand to shade her eyes. “Sometimes I think he hates me for sitting in that goddamn office.”
Steve was sobbing. Tony felt drunk with power for a brief moment, and then he was crying, too. He pawed at Steve’s chest, wrapping his arms around him and pulling him as close as possible.
Steve eyed him and tried to pull off a set of puppy eyes. “JARVIS, tell Pepper that Tony and I ran into an emergency at home and he’ll be unable to attend the board meeting.”
God, he can’t do this.
“James!” Miss Barnes hops out of the horse and runs to embrace Barnes. She’s crying, murmuring promises. For a moment, Barnes appears to be shocked, but he cups her face, and she meets his lips.
They never told him that the other side of surviving meant finding the will to live.
Tony thinks Steve is crumbling, too. A fragile little house finally burning. He’s letting the poles and beams fall down.
Then, he opened the medicine cabinet and put his wedding ring back on.
Steve perches on the edge of his own bed, body turned and attuned to Tony’s every move. He can smell the sun on him, and there’s the distinct sharpness of grease around the room. “Tired?”
“Oh.”
“J, are the kids near?” Pepper sat on their bed, eyes a clear blue. “I think they’d enjoy the donuts before their daddy eats them all.”
He buries the feeling of thirst, forces it to subside. It isn't a difficult task once he focuses on the burns on his back or the scabs on his hips.
Steve tried to console Morgan, holding her on one arm while he made rounds to greet Sam and the rest of the attendees. They were a small group. It was just the Avengers, Maria Hill, Sharon Carter, and Nick Fury.
“You ought to take care of yourself while I’m at work, Tony.” Steve shakes his head, false concern evident in his features, and it’s truly, utterly fucked because Tony will pretend that the worry is real. “I’m already dealing with trying to rebuild this country. If you don’t take care of yourself, I’ll worry. I can’t be distracted right now.”
He shrugs. “The whole world lost someone, Cap, it’s not just me.”
“Today, the world, and the rest of our lives.”
He falls on his elbows, exhausted. He continues crying.
Tony opens, licking Steve’s digits clean.
Steve waved his son over, holding the box over. “Alright, Harley, come get your presents.”
He notices how time has seemed to drift these last few years. For a man suspended in animation for seventy years,  time is an odd feeling. A heavy emotion, not Time as in minutes passing, but an abstract construct he has no means of fully understanding. Maybe it’s an experience? Steve doesn’t really understand it. All he knows is he thought he was dying, then he woke up again. This time, to a new world, a new life, a place he’s still struggling to belong to.
It was like coming up for air when he thought he was drowning.
Of course. He should learn to stop asking people for things they cannot give him. He wants nothing more than to push through.
He strips his clothes, folds them, then drops them by the edge of the sink, where he spots Tony's electric toothbrush. It's white, plain, and a contrast to Steve's own multicolored plastic brush. He stares at it as he brushes his teeth.
“Steve.” Tony’s gaze lingers on him before he tears it away. He picks up the wrench, spins it, then sets it back now. He keeps his focus on the table, whispering, “Are you serious?”
Tony orders a house burger, foregoes the fries, and has water instead of soda.
Harley snapped and threw circuit boards across the room. Steve often found him standing on the penthouse’s rooftop garden, surrounded by withered flowers. It made him nervous to see the anguish in his eyes. Harley refused to talk to him on some days. Steve’s helpless, scared his son is drifting away from him.
Maybe he'll succumb to infection first. If the chains were a little shorter, he'd already have bashed his head to the wall.
Me too, I fucking hate you and I hate this, and how I still love you, fuck you, Steve, fuck you, he doesn’t bother uttering the words because Steve already knows. Has known.
He lets himself look at Steve now, takes in those bright eyes, not tarnished by rage or fear. He’s satisfied. He’s winning.
Someone is yelling Miss Barnes’ name.
He looks at Steve and sees a man he’d do anything for. Yet, there’s Steve, but something different about him. It does not please Tony to know there’s something about Steve Rogers that he cannot name. It isn’t a frightening difference, no, it’s barely there at all. His eyes are still clear, blue, and honest. The smile he wears is unadulterated, still bashful, though he has no reason to feel shy. Not around Tony.
“Good.” Steve nods with a smile, petting his hair, pleased with something as banal and human as eating. “You’ll get better.”
“THOR, what did I say about your landing? You’re going to mess up our garden!” Tony stands and gestures to the patch of land that’s been scathed.
“Haven’t I done the worst? Steve hates me. He couldn't look at me in the field. He didn't speak to me in Asgard. I
Steve wished they were still small so he could just hold all three of them in his arms at the same time. His heart was flayed with the wanting, the longing, and the hurt this is his life now. When they were all toddlers, he and Tony used to prop them all up in the middle of the bed and watch them coo and roll around, reaching for their dad and papa with pudgy hands.
“Oh, stop it, Steve. You don’t live here —“ At that, Tony grimaces. “I mean. God, why is this so hard? We have our way of figuring things out here without ground rules.” Tony makes air quotes and rolls his eyes. “Bruce offers assistance but I didn’t need help today,” Tony says, side stepping Steve to bring the roast chicken into the dining table.
“Alright, fine, I know I shouldn’t believe everything in the paper, but he was the talk of the century for ages. You seem like a good guy. He’s lucky to have you.”
There are new lines on Tony's face, and Steve hopes like hell they are from laughter. His hair is still dark, a deep chestnut color, but are also streaks of grays in the fringes, especially beside his ear. It curls like a smile, and Steve has to shove his hands into his pockets to stop from reaching out.
Steve prows in a circle, making pleased sounds as he runs a finger down Tony’s shoulder, then up his arms.
Tony shifts, feeling the fire in his belly, the swell between his legs, and he’s helpless to stick his hands on the glass window, allowing Steve’s ministrations. He leaves fingerprints on the glass, pressing further forward as Steve snakes the hand from his hip to Tony’s stomach, rubbing, gentle,  checking the forming bruise of where he punched Tony just earlier.
“Fuck,” Steve stared at Tony’s blown pupils and his bobbing throat. Steve tried to get the dirt from the palm of his hands, but it was no use, Tony’s trousers were streaked. He unbuttoned Tony’s pants, pulling them until they were below his knees.
It felt like a betrayal to set the table and have a seat empty.
He fucks hard and deep, this new determination shocking him. He'll have it just this once, and it's alright. He covers Tony's hand, and Tony intertwines them, bringing them to his lips. It's a sweet gesture, practically absurd given the circumstances, but Steve stopped caring long ago. With his other hand, he brings Tony's right leg up, thrusting in faster, gasping at the sound of their skin slapping against each other. His balls are heavy and his arms are growing tired, but he's resolute. Steve wraps Tony's leg by his waist and leans forward, aligning their torsos so they’re chest to chest.
He stirs, blinks his eyes open.
“I was looking for something—someone.”
There's about 37 trillion cells in the body. The ordinary man cannot fathom such a large number without comparison to something else. You're made up of all of that and more. And somehow I think you're greater. 37 trillion cells in the body and each one tells me that I miss you, Winghead.
Steve can't  help but trace the curve of his head and the hair on his nape. He’d like to draw this picture, he thinks. Tony. Even if he’s faceless in the sketch, Steve would know it’s him by the slope of his back.
It wasn't just this house. He felt at peace with Tony. The light streams from the window making shadows dance from the tree-lined streets. “You gave me a home. Somewhere I belong. I love you for that.”
Steve returned her defeated smile, throwing an arm over her shoulder.
I miss
Away, away, they go.
“I will. We will.” Peter wiped at his nose, slumping beside Steve. “He loved you too, pops.”
I’m not sure that’s true. People cannot belong to others, but that’s never been us, hasn’t it? You’re Captain America, you belong to the people. You can’t ever belong to yourself, Steve. I think I feel bad for the both of us.
That’s all they could do these days. It was hard to keep down food with the nausea.
“Flatterer. How do you feel about kids?”
Steve blinked his eyes open, once, twice, and the first thing he saw were Tony’s pupils, a deep brown, clouded with trouble. His eyebrows were furrowed in concern.
A wedding by the Compound’s lake.
Steve sits up, and damn, he’s huge, wide chest, trim waist, and Tony gets even harder when his eyes land on Steve’s hung cock. Massive and red. He wants to be fucked until fucking SHRA is over.
Tony huffs, and it’s a soft sound in the quiet of their room. Steve knows this tone of voice. This is Tony brushing off his excellence and selflessness as nothing, as if it’s the norm for the rest of the world.
God, he’s such an asshole.
He woke up in the mornings feeling sick to his stomach. Psychologically, the grief counsellors explained that it’s his body reacting to trauma.
Victor Von Doom made an appearance at the party last night. The tool questioned him about the latest Stark line of green energy, scoping out competition. Then, the music was too loud but Tony loved drowning his thoughts in the sound of screaming, laughter, and the bass. It helped keep his thoughts away. Fuck, he mixed alcohol, cocaine, and there was something else. There’s flashes of a man barging into his conversation with Doom, warning him that Doom put something into the drink.
Steve swallows, bends to unzip his duffel bag, then grabs a pair of shorts and an old cotton t-shirt he purchased from a second hand store. He turns towards the wall, back ramrod straight, pulls the shirt over his head, then thinks, fuck it, he’s a grown man.
Their entire world was 6.8 pounds and could be held in the palm of their hands.
“Because we’re going to rebuild the world,” Riri and Kate cheer simultaneously, like this is a statement that Tony always makes. The former raises her fists and the latter gestures her hands as a bow and arrow.
He stomps, hard, once, twice, three times, until I lose count.
Steve basks in his presence and continues eating.
Always north, these days.
“If I gotta eat, you gotta eat, too,” Tony says, and when Steve stays silent, Tony orders half the first page for him.
It’s been shut since the fiasco with Fisk and the blowing of the dam, but from a distance, there’s a slight reflection. Tony steps forward, “What is that — what.”
Tony waves a hand at the ceiling. “And anyway, Nat’s not much of a cook. She’d live off PB&J if she could. Surprising, I know.”
I was right, Steve. I wouldn't change a thing. But.
Hum. Hum. Hum. Always humming.
Steve hops out of the car and follows her inside.
He moves his back to Steve, as if he can’t look anymore. Tony fiddles with the buttons on the keypad, closes the door, and coughs. “Yeah, just be safe, alright? Please, I can’t lose —  we can’t. We’ve lost enough.”
Carol waves off people’s concern, pulling Rhodes for a peck. “It’s a miracle! This is James Rhodes, through and through, I’d know my husband.”
Just as Steve turns to leave, the doors to the entrance slide open.
It was so easy to close his eyes and imagine those mornings.
Tony narrowed his eyes, suspicious, doing that thing where he tried to be nonchalant. “Yeah, sure, let’s go with that.”
Steve shuts his eyes, he presses a thumb to the space between his eyes, and breathes heavily. “I’m sorry. I’m fucking this up. That’s not what I meant.” He opens his eyes to see Tony’s patient expression. “I mean, what I mean to say, is—” he stutters upon the words. “I’ve read about that, I’m sorry to hear about them. I’ve read about you, too. You seem like a good person, I just… is it alright to have some sort of investment in your well-being?”
Once the doctors announced that the egg and sperm clicked, the next nine months were a whirlwind of anxiety and excitement.
“I, uh, found your address from your wallet and took you home. I wanted to make sure you’d be alright in the middle of night, so I stayed....I’m sorry, I should have asked, but you were passed out, and I didn’t want to leave you...I couldn’t find you a change of clothes,” Steve rubs the back of his neck, blushing. “And well, your clothes were spoiled, so I figured...well, it’s nothing I haven’t seen.”
He could live with the loss.
“No,” Steve shakes his head. They face each other in the middle of the street. Outside, he can still hear the beat of a new song. The moon is up high, bearing down on this Los Angeles-esque nightlife like a drunken haze. It almost feels impossible that he’s standing face to face with Tony Stark. This man he’s dreamt about for months. He’s kept clippings of his accomplishments these last couple of years. Steve is proud of him and this future… whatever it may be. He hopes that Tony will say yes. Steve will do this right. He won’t be like Victor who tries to drug Tony, nor will he be like those vultures inside.
They bickered while Steve plated the eggs, pancakes, and fruit on a large tray. He took the carnation and shoved it in a mason glass, clapping his hands in exaggerated flourish.
Ben Ulrich published on the local paper.
But this half-life was something Steve needed to become habitual. If he had the choice, he’d be gone, adrift in the bottom of the ocean.
“I know.”
“Sing, Stark.”
“Right here!” The young woman, Kate, smiles and waves at him.
“Bacon!” Harley jumped up, clapping, but climbed into bed with care. He placed himself as close to Tony as possible and stuck his tongue out at his siblings. “I’m the favorite, ha.”
He pauses for effect, and Tony breaks into a surprised laugh. “You already have the supplies for it, don’t you?”
“Okay, we have later. All the time in the world, right?” The sting in his eyes were back, but Steve pushed through. Tony needed him.
Tony looked so perfect under him, all pliant but full of spitfire, like a cat, screeching its paws and begging to be petted. Steve pressed the heel of his hand over the tent in his pants, assuaging himself for a moment, before zipping Tony’s fly down.
There were aliens and gods from other realms, yet Steve couldn’t make a deal with a fallen angel to switch places with Tony.
Steve couldn’t survive anymore loss.
“Until our paths cross again, Tony. Be it with you in the sky, in your red and gold suit. Me on the ground, looking up at you in awe and adoration. Always. Today, tomorrow, and the rest of my life.” Steve wore a shaky smile and let the sound of the city wash over him.
Steve
Now, his brain supplied him memories of being on opposing sides, tearing their team apart, destroying parts of the city in their hubris.
“Oh.” Steve swallows. “I didn’t think that it would still be there. Thanks, Tony.”
Steve,
Tony lets himself be dragged out. He smells like oil and whiskey, and there’s stains on his two day old shirt.
“Never again,” I whisper, minding the crack of my voice.
“You think refusing to eat will do you any good? Tony, you’ll just hurt yourself.” He caresses Tony’s face like some cosmic joke.
“Go on, then,” Tony stays rooted on the spot. There’s only the kitchen island separating them. They have always been different. Tony has enough insight to know that Steve’s a better man. But good men don’t always do the right thing, not when they can’t see past their own myopic sights.
The nails and blood on the counters were disposed of and the tiles were free of puke and broken glass. The smell of piss was gone.
“I haven’t moved on,” Peter said, pushing past Natasha’s hold before standing over where Steve and Harley sat on the floor.
Steve stayed still, grinning as Tony began whining and fucking himself on Steve’s cock. He placed both hands on Tony’s hips and began thrusting in and out. When their movements turned manic, Steve grabbed Tony’s dick and pumped its shaft until they both came.
The subway to Brooklyn was empty. Steve walked around the block three times before deciding to enter the old brick building. He forced himself to get out of the house and attend again.
Steve could be straddling me and telling me that he hates me and that I’m worse than the scum of the earth. He could explain to me with certainty why I’m awful while he chokes me.
There’s no elevator, so they climb the rickety steps for three flights, and then they’re up in a large, single room that could double as a spacious attic. The walls slant in an angle and there’s two double beds occupying the sides of the room.
He caressed Tony’s hair back, unhurried. Like they had all the time in the world.
The shirt soon follows, and then Steve’s bearing his broad chest, the painting of the Hydra symbol illustrated across his sternum. Its tails curl around Steve’s nipples.
Steve,
Steve loves to trace the lines on the red and gold hand and he loves to suck on them after it’s filled with Tony’s come. He flips Tony’s left hand, brings it to his mouth, and kisses the wedding band.
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s waist and dropped his head on Steve’s bicep. “Good morning, beloved.”
He’s already in tatters with his own self-flagellation, might as well give Nat the honor to press at the sore spots. He’ll heal just fine.
Peter stifled a laugh. “Yeah, you finally learned something? Now we can exchange notes because Dr. Mitski has been telling me to journal my feelings.”
“Activating rooftop shields for blackout mode, Captain Rogers.” JARVIS announced, sounding hesitant like he’s disrupting something important.
Tony laughed as Peter and Harley twisted their faces, irritated at their parents. Steve pulled Harley close, and kissed the top of his head. “Well, how do you think you three were made?”
Well, maybe some might say the same thing about me when I took over for Hill.
Steve.
“You’ll always be my Cap. Now, control yourself, Rogers! We have guests around,” Tony says cheekily, rubbing up against Steve before turning back to point at Sam and Bucky bickering by the barbeque pit.
Pushing the finished plate aside, he takes his phone out, and opens the unread message.
Maybe you might not like this book after all.
“Yeah? And what’s your evidence?” The man scratches at his thick mustache and puts his hands on his hips, measuring Steve up.
“No, I mean, I —“
“Mine too, and so are you.” Steve brought their intertwined fingers to Tony’s chest. He needed to feel the heartbeat, demanding that it kept beating, strumming that familiar pattern.
He’d  get sober tomorrow. He would. Tomorrow would be different. Tomorrow he might jump out of the window instead and forget he could call the armor in an instant. Make it look like an accident.
Finish it.
He scrubs a head through his face. “Ok. Ok.”
Tony wasn’t going to think about how she got him out of a conversation with Sunset Bain and if it wasn't for Firebrands, he might have tried to hold her hand. Maybe he should have left her alone that first time, rejected her quick offer for help and the easy comfort that came with her presence.
Natasha snorts. “I’m a fucking mess, Steve, you can’t be happy about that.”
Tony draws a ragged breathe, and tries to center himself at the sudden pause. He hears Steve's labored breathing against his neck, until there’s the sound of his uniform dropping to the floor.
so much love in between them and it erupted out of Steve. He didn’t know what to do with all these jagged parts of himself. Tony was the one who softed up the mean parts of him, the worst parts. His kids helped. They did. They do. But it wasn’t enough, and he’s once again consumed by the guilt that
“Thanks, Carol.” He sounded curt even to his own ears. Fuck, he couldn’t help it. Maybe he was just bound to be a miserable asshole now. Grief made people bitter.
“I’m sorry, baby.” Tony opened his eyes, trying to keep them open for Steve.
“I’m alive, Rhodeybear! Let me live and be frisky with my husband!”
“It does to me. Besides, you already know my name.”
Guess what, friend. After the fiasco with the Mandarin, Samson persuaded me into taking a weekend off. Dugan and Hill gave me updates every hour, but I didn’t sleep at the quarters in the Helicarrier. I made it home in the Avengers Tower. I saw Carol and Simon sitting side by side, catching a film in the living room.
He itched for charcoal and a piece of paper to draw the father and son. Instead, Steve grabbed the manila folder with Peter’s birth certificate. “Yes, he’s ours.”
