"If we want to concentrate the fighting in one place, that's probably the best way," said Natasha. "It'll also bottleneck their advance, which should slow them down a bit."
"I'm—I'm not, Steve," Tony finally said, softly. "I'm not a good father. Not if—not if I can't—if I can't even keep my boy from constantly getting hurt, or even worse, and—"
"Gwen's dad was watching the news in the background while we were talking," Peter said, his bottom lip sticking out in its full pouty force. "It's not my fault that I could hear it."
Everyone looked up as George Stacy entered the lab, having spent the last two hours making phone calls to his FBI contacts.
"Yeah, usually," Peter said as he peered through the telescope again, his heart starting to thud when he saw how much bigger it had already grown. It also didn't seem to be travelling across the sky, like a comet normally would.
Peter shook his head, leaning back against his pillows. He wasn't used to having such deep discussions so early in the morning.
"You'll understand when you're older, Pete," said Tony as he slid off Steve's lap, smirking when Steve palmed his ass. "Much older."
"No. We should still draw straws," Steve said as he turned to Thor. "This isn't something you should do just 'cause you think you need to make up for what happened."
"Captain!" the grounds person cried as he attempted to slide the ladder over to Steve's aircraft, which Steve ignored as he jumped down to the floor. The hard cement rattled every bone in his tense body as he looked out towards the runway, barely able to make out Bucky's burning aircraft as it approached, listing badly to the left. He couldn't seem to get his eyes to work right. Everything was blurry, and there were funny-looking circles hovering around objects that were messing with his centre of gravity.
Tony gave his head a hard shake, trying to get his mind to stop spinning. Peter was absolutely correct, he knew that. But at the same time, he was
"Yeah, it does, doesn't it?" Steve said as he took the rest of the stick from Peter, placing it back into its jar. "Go ahead and sprinkle it into the mug now, all right?"
Despite all of Steve and Tony's attempts to ignore the inevitable, Peter was growing up, and it wouldn't be too much longer before he went away to college and mornings like these would only be a memory. And Steve was determined to enjoy every single possible second he got with Peter before that happened.
"No!" Steve exclaimed, a bit too loudly when Tony flinched. "No," he repeated, a bit gentler this time. "I'm just… are you sure about this? I mean, it's been so long, and I—" He broke off, dropping his gaze to where his dog tags hung from their chain around Tony's neck, framing the mass of scars on his chest where the arc reactor once was.
Tony let out a puff of air as he and Steve got to their feet, nodding towards the chairman before heading back towards the doors with Rhodey close behind them. As soon as they were in the hallway Tony sucked in a deep breath, glaring in the general direction of the various senators and aides who were now exiting the chambers.
"Bruce said Dr Cho is already waiting for us in the penthouse," Papa said as he braked for a red light. "Are you sure that's gonna be enough?"
There was a pause as Wanda pondered Peter's words, her hands wringing and twisting in front of her, generating little flashes of red.
And that's even if Tony had wanted to declassify his defence drones to the British government in the first place. Which he didn't.
"It's nothing, mo grá," Steve said quickly. "But Peter's doing just fine. Bucky told me last night that they've been getting in all kinds of trouble."
It had taken all of Steve's inner strength—and more that he didn't know he had—not to lose it completely when Tony went unconscious in his arms, the elation he'd felt at his husband's safe return quickly tempered by Tony's weakened, unstable condition, and his own unbearable grief that Peter wasn't with him.
—even Tony's dreams of the Chitauri armies invading Earth would be nothing more than distant memories. After successfully purging both Peter and Bucky's memories of being snapped from their minds, Tony was eager to try it out not only on himself, but on Steve as well.
"You keep shooting off your mouth like that and I'll toss you right into that lake when we get there," Sam retorted. He shot Bucky a wink, squeezing his knee. "Something tells me that we might be spending a bit of time there on occasion, though, long as you guys don't mind. It sure is a nice place."
"Does it hurt?" he softly asked, his blue eyes radiating sympathy and something else that Tony couldn't quite decipher.
"Um… sure, Captain. That sounds—that sounds nice," Tony said before he could change his mind. He had to admit that he was a bit surprised by Rogers' nervousness. For someone who looked like he could get any girl or guy that he wanted, Rogers sure seemed to be lacking in the suave department.
Peter rolled his eyes, mumbling something under his breath that Tony couldn't quite catch as he watched him disappear down the hall with Steve. His husband and his son, his two boys who he never thought he'd have, and now couldn't live without.
"They're just really excited to see you, bud," Tony grumbled, grunting as yet another camera flashed in his face. "Just keep your head down, okay? We're almost to Uncle Sam's car."
And of course, Peter wouldn't mention it to his dads. Not when he knew how worried Steve was for Tony.
"Best not to, honey," Tony said quickly. He knew exactly what Steve was getting at, but the fiercely protective side of him wanted absolutely nothing to do with the possibility of subjecting his son to some secret government experiment. "Knowing our government they've already wasted it on some other poor idiot who ended up getting killed or something."
At least, not today. Steve knew he would have to sit the entire team down for a pretty intense debriefing once they got home, one where he would explain everything that had happened and what they did to fix it. Clint and Natasha had already explained some things to Wanda, just like Peter had asked more than a few questions of Steve while recovering from his electrical burns. Steve had answered them all to the best of his ability, but he also knew that Peter had a lot more, and had promised him multiple times that he and Tony would both explain everything once they got home.
Mr Toomes stepped closer then, his beady eyes narrowing as they swept over Peter, sending another freezing bolt down his back.
"Copy that," said Sam as he whooshed overhead, his dual guns firing at the creature's head. Unfortunately the bullets seemed to have no effect, appearing to pass directly through the creature as it swung its arm towards Sam, showering him with a cloud of freezing water.
"Thank you," Steve said, barely getting the words out before he claimed Tony's lips in a bruising kiss, pulling back after only a second to whisper, "You're not too tired, are you?"
Hammer chuckled, wagging his finger in Tony's direction. "You always were quite the jokester, weren't you, Anthony? Always so charming, always ready with the quippy one-liners that had everyone rolling and clutching their pearls." The smile dropped from his face as he started to pace back and forth. "As a matter of fact, these babies were initially designed to be defensive only, much like those fancy-schmancy drones that you have mounted on all of those buildings of yours. But now that you and your friends are here, I'm thinking that it might be time for a bit of a test." He turned abruptly, an evil smile stretching across his lips. "You know, since you all just broke in here uninvited and all."
It was on the tip of Steve's tongue to ask why. Why they absolutely needed to trust some holier-than-thou doctor who hadn't even had the courtesy to consult on Peter when he and Tony had feared that their son's mind might've been lost for good.
"Yeah, well, New Asgard is still pretty new, so… now that they have him out there I guess they're trying to get everything done at once," Peter said. "Hopefully it won't be too much longer. Spring break starts next week, so he'll have to come back sometime in the next few days."
Steve thinks fondly.  Both of them fiercely loyal to their loved ones, and both unable to rest when those same loved ones are in danger.
“Ah, Earth to Tony?”  Obie snapped his fingers in front of Tony’s nose, sending his heart into his throat.  “You still with me here?”
“Of course, Captain,” replies Thor.  He shifts slightly, holding out his hand towards Tony’s arm.  “Come, Stark.  Young Starkson is very eager to see you.”
Steve swallows his sigh before it can escape.  “I wasn't joking, Tony, and you know it,” he says as he lays back down, pillowing his head on his arm like he has a hundred times before.  “Wake me in an hour, okay?”
And after dealing with a literal alien invasion, one that saw Tony battered and beaten even before he flew into space carrying a nuclear missile and nearly losing his life in the process, there was no telling how stressed Tony's body had become. Add that on top of all of the stress that had followed the battle, the never-ending hounding by reporters, and having to deal with a bunch of power-hungry bureaucrats down in D.C., and Steve had half a mind to pull Peter out of school early so the three of them could escape to California now, where their home was a lot more secluded.
"But that's not gonna be enough!" Peter yelled as Quill began bouncing his way back towards Thanos on magic floating circles thrown by Dr Strange, landing one of his magnetic explosive devices onto Thanos' back.
Because now, not only would the Stark family be remembered as heroes in Langara rather than villains, his father would be able to live out the rest of his life with the man he loved.
"Will you try and get some rest tonight too?" he asked. "Maybe even go home instead of conking out on your desk like you like to do?"
"Okay, so… what do you think, J?" he asked, stopping suddenly to squint at something that turned out to just be a tiny flicker in the projection. "How's it looking?"
"Thank you," Peter murmured. "That's really nice of you to say." He paused for a moment, still chewing on his lip. "Um… what did you mean when you asked if I was good at keeping secrets?"
“No,” Steve said, shaking his head.  He had already put the files back, no sense in pulling them right back out again.  “No, I just—I just wanna forget.”
"Okay, well, we've still got a few more days before the targeting range will be up to snuff," said Tony. "When were they planning on taking off?"
"Oh, I know that," replied Gwen. "And he knows it too, but… there's also the survivor's guilt that he carries. He lost one of his longtime partners during the alien invasion, in the same bank where Captain America saved all those people that were trapped inside, so… it's probably irrational, but I think there's a part of him that wonders why your papa couldn't save his partner, too."
"Yeah, you did," Tony said as he heard Steve's landing gear engage. He held his breath as the aircraft touched down, cruising to a final stop about ten metres from where Tony was standing.
"Um…" Peter said as his eyebrows knitted together. "We're still over the Atlantic, dude. We won't reach land again for another five hours, depending on the wind speeds."
"I gotcha, babe," Tony replied a second later, followed by the unmistakable sound of his repulsors. "Asshole thought he could hide behind a rock, now that's not very dignified, is it?"
"So, you got any ideas on how I could ask him out?" Steve asked, groaning as he tipped his head under the hot spray of the shower. "Or what we could do?"
, Steve thought as he ran his thumb across Tony's knuckles, his breath hitching when Tony's fingers tightened around his.
"Ah ha!" O'Brien said with an appreciative nod. "And serve it you have! In fact, I've already initiated the process to have you promoted to Major, based on the recommendation of your superior officers."
"Whatever it takes," he whispered as he felt the sharp tug behind his navel again, reappearing inside the training dome less than a heartbeat later. As soon as he shut down the tunnel, Tony rushed over from the command area, his face etched in concern as Steve's helmet retracted.
"Gwen!" he cried as he glanced up at the sky, his heart jumping into his throat as he noticed another incoming fireball. He quickly crawled over to Gwen, curling his body around her as his entire left side screamed in protest. "There's another fireball coming, so don't let go of me, okay? I've got you, but you have to hold onto me!"
"Hmph," grumbled Tony. "Pretty sure Howard could've explained exactly how it was supposed to work, if you'd only asked him."
"It's why you love me, honey," Tony said, moaning as he hiked his legs up, hooking his knees over Steve's hips as Steve pressed him further into the cushions. His mind was already swimming with sensation, his hands taking on a mind of their own as they glided over Steve's soft skin and hard muscles. "
Making his way out to the kitchen, Tony once again replayed his conversation with Fury in his mind while he waited for the coffeemaker to work its magic. Fury was insisting that the incident that killed the Wakandan king was completely separate from the space attack, and while Tony was still reluctant to concede that a coincidence was possible, he had to admit that Rumlow's sudden reappearance did tip the odds a bit more in that direction.
"Oh," Peter said as he slumped back down into his pillows. He raised his left arm, scowling at the two separate intravenous lines flowing into it. "Well, at least there's that."
Peter knew he didn't have too long, though.  Even on a good day Dad’s naps were never longer than an hour or so, and with time being the essence that it was, well… Peter knew he needed to hustle.
he thought as he tipped his head back, thudding it against the stone wall. He drew in a deep, shaky breath, gripping Steve even tighter as if he hoped he might be able to squeeze some sense into him.
"Is there something that you'd like to share with the rest of the class, Mr Stark-Rogers?" the teacher suddenly said. Peter gulped, ducking down into his hoodie as the entire class turned to stare at him.
The subsequent argument-turned-shouting-match he’d had with Obie that’d nearly led him to indulge in a few shots of that thousand-dollar-a-bottle Scotch notwithstanding.  Tony hadn't taken a single sip of hard alcohol since the day he got the call about Peter, but that didn't mean he wasn't still tempted from time to time.
As if in slow motion, Steve watched his son fall, bracing himself for the explosion that he knew was coming.
overprotective, something that Peter hadn't thought possible. With Dad out in New Asgard trying to figure out how to repair Uncle Thor's spaceship for the last week and a half, Papa had even started coming inside the school to watch the last few minutes of their Decathlon practises instead of just waiting out in the parking lot like he used to. He'd stand there in the doorway of the gym with his arms crossed over his front in his "concerned Papa pose", eyeing Peter like he was afraid he was going to disappear right in front of his eyes or something.
Grandma shrugged her bony shoulders. "When you're a parent, there are sometimes things that you deliberately keep to yourself out of love for your child."
"C'mon, Rogers," Steve said through clenched teeth. Another claw pierced his side right below his sketchbook pocket, forcing Steve to bite down on his bottom lip. "C'mon, c'mon, c'mon—"
"Yeah, Sam, thanks," said Steve. He released Tony, sucking in a deep, shaky breath as he glanced down at Bucky and Peter. "Go ahead."
"No, no, don't thank me. I didn't—I couldn't—" Steve stammered, watching dazedly as Sam took Bucky's limp right hand in his as they rolled the stretcher towards the emergency vehicle.
There was a pause as Peter slowly turned his head, his eyes locking with Steve's, blank as an untouched canvas as he leaned in nose to nose.
"Mmph," he mumbled as he slammed his eyelids closed again, reopening them into slits a few seconds later. Once they had adjusted a bit, he shifted slightly, attempting to raise his right hand, which felt like it weighed about thirty kilograms, so he could reach for the cup of water sitting on the bedside table.
"Um… are you actually asking me about my personal life, Colonel? Don't you know that's against Air Corps regulations?"
"Oh, sure, sure," said Beck. He tapped the tablet again, bringing up a video of what looked like a surgeon learning a new surgical technique. "This was one of our test subjects, a third-year medical student at Columbia, who was able to learn a very complicated surgical technique without even having to set foot inside a surgical suite. The drug combined with the MAUDE glasses allowed her to perfectly imagine the problem and practise her technique until she was able to get it down perfectly, all without the use of research animals. Going forward, this will allow her to now perform this rather complicated surgery correctly the very first time, potentially saving lives."
"Yeah, okay, but we probably should get started now, shouldn't we?" asked Bucky. "Isn't this stuff kinda important?"
"And it did," Steve assured him. "I saw her with my own eyes. Wanda, Sam, Bucky, the Guardians, Dr Strange, and Peter. They were all there."
They ended up making a total of ten pizzas, six of which were eaten by Peter, Papa, and Uncle Thor. Once everyone was done eating Peter helped Dad finish his work on Uncle Thor's new eye while Papa gave him a condensed version of the HYDRA prison battle, including a rundown of the upcoming criminal trials that were scheduled to begin by the end of the summer. Uncle Thor was also very interested to learn more about Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, who were spending the summer with Uncle Clint's sister-in-law and her family on their farm in rural Indiana. Once they all had arrived back in New York, Wanda confessed that she and Pietro had been held at the HYDRA prison for almost three years, so Papa worked it out with Director Fury that they would spend the summer quietly recuperating, then return to live at the Compound right before the school year started so they could both attend a local public school.
The last thing Steve needs is for his shoulder to become locked.  Then he’d never be able to get back on his motorcycle.
"Then I've gotta fix it," he said quietly. "If I can find the buried code that's causing all the trouble with JARVIS and get rid of it, then JARVIS’ll be able to come back and Papa can reenter the atmosphere."
"It's probably going to be a few days, Gwen," Steve said gently. "But we'll let you and your father know as soon as he does wake up, all right?"
"Fine," he finally said. He looked up at his husband's gorgeous face, attempting to bat his eyelashes. "You wouldn't happen to be interested in making me some coffee then, would you?"
"Oh, you know, same old, same old," said Ned. "My dad and I went downtown so we could see the fireworks better, but other than that it was just crowded, cold, and noisy. You know, typical New York."
But as Steve had watched the scene unfold in front of him, his stomach in knots and his foot aching in sympathy, knowing that that was the point when he'd felt that all hope had been lost, that his beloved husband truly believed that he'd turned HYDRA and that he would never see his son again, as if in a dream, Peter had suddenly appeared, attempting to rescue him.
Not taking his eyes off the screen, Peter fumbled around on his bed until he came across his external keyboard, connecting it via Bluetooth to his tablet and opening a clean document file.
"But—but, you guys told me to get the wizard!" Peter wheezed, blinking as the ship flew through a huge, puffy cloud. His lungs felt like two massive blocks of ice in his chest, his throat so tight he could barely speak. "Daddy, I can't—I can't breathe!"
“Oh, sure!  I can do that!” Peter said, just as his phone buzzed in his pocket.  Apparently Dad had actually left the office on time for once.
But Peter should’ve known that not even a play-by-play retelling of the events could compare to actually seeing it happen right in front of him.
, 'cause I take videos all the time, but anyway… That was right when Papa and Uncle Thor pulled up, so they both heard Flash call me an idiot but Flash didn't know that Uncle Thor was in the truck with Papa, and so then Uncle Thor got out of the truck, and he came right up to Flash, like right up into his personal space and stuff, and then he looked down at him all grim-like, and—" Peter paused to gulp a few breaths of air, still grinning widely. "And
Steve bit his lip. He didn't like the idea of Natasha risking her life that way, but he also knew she was the best person for the job since she had experience with that type of thing.
"So, you're not gonna tell me where you're going?" asked Bucky as Steve sat down on the bench to tie his shoes.
"It's all right, little guy," Steve said as he grabbed a handful of paper towels to help with the cleanup. It wasn't the first time that Peter's attempt at cracking an egg had gone badly wrong, and it likely wouldn't be the last.
"Huh?" Tony said, snapping his mouth closed. He had been dangerously close to drooling, not exactly something he needed Colonel Phillips to see.
“Well, that’s good,” Tony said as he rested his palms on Steve’s arms, rising up to kiss him gently on the lips.  “You ready?”
"I do appreciate your time this morning, Captain, and I only have a couple more questions before I dismiss you," O'Brien finally said.
"He's wearing his suit, Steve," Tony murmured as Bruce started the truck, driving carefully over the damp grass. "He's wearing his suit and nothing else. JARVIS couldn't find any of his other clothes in the water, which means he must've left 'em somewhere else, which means—"
Since the nose of Joseph's aircraft was facing the mountain he allowed Chester and Tomis to peel off first, intending to fly around the mountain before falling into position since the slingshot manoeuvre required less fuel than a direct about-face.
Steve's belly gave a violent swoop, his hand tightening on the shield. "Okay. Can you give me your best guess?"
"Yeah, yeah," Rhodey had muttered as he exited the locker room, still grumbling under his breath about the fact that he couldn't order Tony to take better care of himself since he wasn't officially under his command.
"What's wrong with me?" Steve asked, aghast. "Tony, you sound awful, and you're burning up! We need—we need to get you to a hospital right away! JARVIS, please call—"
Sucking in a slow, deep breath, Steve picked a yellow splinter of pencil out of his palm before nodding, carefully closing his notebook.
"So tell him to send all the data they've managed to compile over to Bruce's lab, and he and I can take a look at it in the morning after we get Pete to school, yeah?" said Tony. He tipped his head up, planting a kiss on Steve's jaw. "Problem solved."
"Gamora?" Peter suddenly heard from behind him, startling him so badly that he nearly jumped out of his skin. He whirled around to find Quill patting the ground where Gamora had just been sitting, obviously just as frantic as he felt. "Gamora? Where the hell did you go? Where the hell's the ship?"
"I gave him a lemon drop, Mr Stark," Gwen added. "He said it helped a bit, and my mom offered to call an ambulance but Peter said you guys were already on the way, so…"
It was also one of the main reasons why Tony had never been brave enough to invite a male date to an event.
He would just have to hope that they could get together without guards or chaperones sometime soon. Maybe after spring break was over they could plan another date.
"Steve," Steve said as his smile grew wider. "Unless you'd like for me to keep calling you Mr Stark."
“Yeah, probably,” answered Peter.  “It’s not like I can’t walk or something.  Don't think I’ll be able to help you in shop for a while though.”
So far the only downside to the new project had been that Tony could not yet work on it during normal business hours.  While he had told Obie straight-up about the rehiring of the scientists and the resumption of the drug trials, he had left out a few of the more major details of what they were going to be working on, forcing him to stay late every single night that week and essentially abandon Peter to Steve’s bookstore until close to 6pm.
"Nothing," Steve said quickly, reaching for Tony's elbows. He pressed a soft kiss to Tony's forehead, relieved when Tony's hands came to rest in their usual spot on his biceps. Now obviously wasn't the time for Steve to mention all of the research he'd been doing on the possible lung capacity and immune system problems having a big piece of hardware embedded into one's sternum could cause.
"Is breá liom tú," he whispered, trailing his thumb across Tony's cheekbone. "Is breá liom tú an oiread sin. Inis dom conas is féidir liom tú a shásamh."
As Steve had hoped, it didn't take much convincing on his part to get the rest of the team on board with his plan. It was both flattering and humbling to see the acceptance in the eyes of his teammates as Steve spoke, their unconditional trust that this was actually going to work.
"Mr Stark," T'Challa said with a sigh. "As I have said, I do apologise. But if everything you have told me is true, then I am unsure as to how sharing our defensive technology will be helpful. We currently have no way of knowing when or if another attack will occur, and we simply cannot become responsible for the protection of the entire world. That is not something that would be asked of any other country, and Wakanda must be given the same consideration. Until the time is right, we will continue as we always have, sharing our resources and knowledge as the needs arrive, and not before."
"That's right, Captain," said the marshall. "You and Mr Stark are hereby ordered to appear in front of the Senate Armed Services Committee in Washington D.C., the day after tomorrow at nine am."
"Uh huh, got it," Peter said. He crouched down into the water, the tips of his skis poking up on either side of his rope. "I'm ready, Dad."
Auntie Nat would've been very proud of her cute little bug, or whatever the hell her little Russian nickname meant. All Tony knew is that Peter practically melted into a puddle of goo every time she said it, complete with the dewy heart eyes that Tony wouldn't have believed were possible from the former Red Room assassin if he hadn't personally seen them multiple times. Natasha didn't allow too many people to see her softer side, but Peter had been granted the privilege from pretty much the first time Natasha laid eyes on him.
"You'll call if you need anything, right? You know I won't mind coming back up here if you need me," Papa said. Peter bit his lip at how nervous Papa looked, almost as if he was afraid to let Peter out of his sight.
They had barely taken three steps before Natasha came over the comm. "Cap, Thor and I are counting at least fifteen more hostiles in here, and they've just released some kind of gas that's clouding up the second and third floors."
"Oh, I'm sure you'll get there eventually," murmured Steve. He dipped his head, planting a short but sweet kiss on Tony's lips. "Now, I suppose you haven't eaten lunch yet, have you?"
“Oh, good grief, Dad!” Peter retorted.  “I know Steve’s name ‘cause he was wearing a nametag!  You know, like employees tend to do when they’re working?  If you ever actually went inside a store, you might’ve already known that!”
"Yes, it is," agreed Papa. "And unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be something that's changed at all over time."
About a metre away from Bucky sits Jacques Dernier, the Frenchman who took bronze in Steve’s gold-medal race four years ago, and Georges Batroc, a relative newcomer from Algeria.  But while Jacques turned in some decent times in last year’s World Championship meet and Batroc won his semi-final race in pretty impressive fashion, Steve doesn’t really consider either of them to be a threat here.
"Just about," said Steve as he pulled his sketchbook from his jacket pocket. "But I'm afraid mine's not nearly as detailed as yours."
"Uh, I don't think I have a choice," Peter said as the ship took off towards the sky, with the alien and the wizard both disappearing inside. "Oh, crap, this can't be good."
"It's about time you all showed up!" John said, raising his large mug of beer as Steve pulled out Tony's chair. "Cam and I were already arguing over who was gonna pay for the next round!"
About three seconds later, the door buzzes open to reveal steps leading both upstairs and downstairs.  As they climb the stairs to the third level, Peter’s heart beats faster and faster until it jumps right into his throat, almost causing him to choke as they arrive outside the door to the office area.
"No, Tones, that's not it," said Uncle James. "The general wants Captain Rogers to present testimony is all, according to what Colonel Phillips told me."
Lang scowled, glancing over at Steve as if he was looking for help. "Okay, first of all, Mr Stark, I didn't know it was Hank's house that I was breaking into until a lot later."
okay!" Tony snapped. "There is absolutely nothing about this that is even remotely close to being okay, so don't you dare try and tell me that it is!"
"New tech, do you think?" asked Steve, giving his head a quick shake. His mental compartments had been in such a horrendous mess ever since Tony had stormed out of his room that morning that he could barely tell which end was up, much less fly with anything close to his usual precision.
Tony gave him a proud smile.  “Yeah, he’s the best.  Sure as hell don't know where he gets it, but I definitely lucked out with him.  I tell ya what, though, I am sure glad he discovered that store of yours.  It’s good that he’s got somewhere to go after school where I don't have to worry about what he’s doing or who he’s hanging out with.”
Finally, just as he feared that not even his strength would be enough to get the damn thing open, the canopy suddenly sprung up like the hood of a car, almost knocking him right in the chin. Righting himself, Steve immediately reached inside, tearing Bucky's helmet from his head and ripping his harness off, the bloody, mangled state of his left arm nearly stopping Steve in his tracks. With a firm shake of his head he slid his arms around Bucky's waist, hauling him up and onto his shoulder as the emergency crews raced towards the aircraft with a stretcher.
Exiting Peter’s room, Tony stopped once he was in the hallway, leaning against the wall as he tried to decide what to do next.  He was so exhausted that his very bones were aching from it, but he also knew that there’d be no way he’d be able to fall asleep in his bed by himself.
"But it's right, right?" Tony interrupted. "I mean, even the scriptwriters didn't make this stuff up for the show, they got it from actual scientists."
"Yeah, that sounds reasonable," Dad said, his hand firmly on Peter's shoulder. "Then we'll all converse on your signal."
"Once this is all over," Steve said firmly. "And by 'all over', I mean once every last scrap and shred of HYDRA is gone. Completely
Besides that, it was a lot more comfortable to eat at an actual table than it would've been in Tony's tiny office. Steve had been forced to sit on the less messy corner of Tony's desk while he'd worked that afternoon, going over the previous day's X-302 reports and inputting the rest of Peter's JARVIS updates.
Tony sure didn't know what he'd done to deserve such a man, but he was definitely grateful to have him.
“I do,” Steve says, without hesitation.  He leans back on his elbows, gulping in three rapid breaths.  “Give me a countdown when you’re ready.”
"Yes, JARVIS, I know!" Steve sobbed, pressing a light kiss to Tony's forehead, which was both burning hot and freezing cold. "Oh God, sweetheart, please, just stay with me! Don't—don't—!"
"No, probably not. Uncle Clint doesn't mind the fights either, but he likes watching football over hockey anyway. We tried taking him to a baseball game once and he fell asleep."
"All right, we can let him out. Pietro, I want you to be ready for anything, you got that?" Steve ordered.
“Aww, don't mention it!”  Peter held up the bookmark.  “I have this quote on a t-shirt too, it’s one of my favourites.”
Steve pursed his lips. "I think a lot of it depends on who you ask," he said. "And I also think that you just might be a little bit biased."
“Nah, I don't need permission.  Not for something like this,” Peter said quickly.  He flipped over the box, noting the price sticker that read two-hundred and fifty dollars.  “My dad doesn't mind when I buy books.”
Pilots were supposed to be invincible. But while Rogers definitely looked the part, it didn't take a genius to figure out that something about Tony rattled him.
"Yeah, okay," Tony said quickly. "JARVIS, go ahead and cut a check for the full amount to… what's your ex-wife's name again?"
"So do you think I should get her like a whole bouquet, or just a couple of flowers?" Peter asked as they squeezed inside the tiny floral shop across the street from the police station. He had asked if he could buy Gwen some flowers before their date, which Steve had thought was very sweet of him, but since he and Tony didn't really celebrate Valentine's Day—Tony thought it was too commercialised and silly, and Steve wasn't the biggest fan of it either—Steve hadn't thought about just how busy the place would be, or just how many flowers would be crammed inside such a small store, the combined scents of which were so overwhelming that it was already starting to give him a headache.
"I can't see why she would," said Steve. He gave Tony a quick but encouraging smile as he reached for the doorbell. "Ready?"
I can’t believe we’ve reached the final chapter!  I can’t thank you all enough for coming along on this ride with me, and sharing all of your wonderful and encouraging comments!  💖
"Okay, so, obviously most of this is going to fall on Tony and Bruce to figure out," Steve added in his Captain's voice. "So I'm thinking that the rest of us should start training, prepping to face Thanos again. 'Cause as soon as we're able to find the information that we need to beat him, we'll need to move. Scott?"
"Yeah, tell Uncle Bucky it's okay, JARVIS," Peter answered as he bent over to retrieve the pen, rapidly flipping it around his thumb as he reread the paragraph he'd just written on his Decathlon essay. The essay was already clocking in at over twenty-one pages, but as usual whenever Peter found himself fascinated with a topic, he now couldn't seem to stop. He had already exhausted the discussion on the development of the two polio vaccines and had moved onto discussing the testing of vaccines on the nation's military during wartime, something both Papa and Uncle Bucky had experience with.
"Стиви?" he said, more timid and frightened than Steve had ever heard him. In his right hand he carried his rifle, the rifle Tony had built for him, while his left—wasn't there.
"Not yet, you're not," Bucky said with a rather evil grin. "Something tells me that might not be the case for too much longer."
"Sure thing," Tony said, swallowing down his trepidation as Helen left the room. He'd given Peter sponge baths plenty of times when he was in the hospital, but he hadn't had half the bones in his body all busted up at the time.
Instead of answering, Peter reached inside the hologram, expanding a small section and leaning in closer. "Can I tweak something in here?"
"Uh huh," Peter said with a rather enthusiastic nod. "Uncle James said we could watch a couple movies before bed, and Papa, Auntie Carol even told me that she's gonna try using your recipe for hot chocolate tonight."
"I just—" Tony paused, huffing out a sharp breath. "I just don't know if I'll be able to convince them. I just—they're just so locked in to this never-ending cycle of one-upping the enemy, and I just—"
?" Tony shrieked. He looked frantically between the father and daughter standing in front of him, trying to discern if they were lying. "He's been missing for an hour and you're just letting me know
"Congratulations, Captain Rogers," Phillips said. "You and Captain Danvers have literally transformed this planet. You should be very proud."
Making his way down to his and Steve's bedroom, Tony stepped inside to find him just starting to stir. He quickly crawled onto the bed next to him, gathering his tall, broad husband into his arms as Steve's gorgeous blue eyes fluttered open.
"No, but if I had to guess I'd say that we're pretty close," answered Natasha. "This Hammer guy likes an audience, doesn't he?"
"That is correct, sir, but it was not Mr Beck who accessed the server on that date. It was instead accessed by an as-yet-unidentified third party."
"Very good, my dear. One of your best yet, I believe," a vaguely familiar voice said from somewhere behind Steve. His Captain's instinct tried to tell him that he should turn around and investigate the source of the voice, but he was too frozen with grief to even move.
Peter sighed heavily into the receiver. "Yeah, I know, but… please? Can't you make up with Steve first? For me? He told me that he's gonna be starting on the trial space missions soon, and Dad, I wanna make sure that you guys are okay before all that. For both your sakes."
Tony's fingers tightened on Steve's arm, his jaw clenched and his blunt nails digging into Steve's skin. "I said
"Whoa! This is pretty amazing!" added Bruce as he resumed his thundering steps. "It's like being the Hulk without actually,
"Dude, the guy's going into the penalty box," said Uncle Clint through a mouthful of something. "He got called for slashing!"
"Like I said, sweetheart. Only in the good ways," he said as he snapped his hips against Tony's ass, forcing another strangled moan from Tony's throat. "I love you so much, mo grá. Is tú mo gach rud, and I just love you so damn much!"
"Ah, it is so good to see you again, Young Starkson!" Thor exclaimed as he set Peter down, ruffling his hair. "Alas, I wish my visit was of a social variety."
"I'm saying that it's not out of the realm of possibility," Bruce said. He glanced over at Tony, who gave him a nod. "I mean, the very reason that Peter was able to decode the stuff that he decoded was because he could actually see the hidden text in the file, so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to think that there's something out there in that water that he can see that someone without his visual enhancements can't."
"Papa, help me!" Peter said again as he slumped against Bucky, his eyes barely open. "I'm so tired, I just wanna sleep!"
"Mmm," Steve muttered, his attention drawn back to the television screen, where President Cole had just been joined onstage by his wife and grown son. "Do we know anything about the son?"
"Yeah, it was," answered Steve. "If the real thing is anything like those simulations then we're gonna be in for a treat."
"Tony?" Steve said as he took a step towards Tony, halting in his tracks when Tony immediately backed away. "Sweetheart, what's wrong?"
"You mean even more ahead of ourselves?" Tony asked, muffled against Steve's chest. He was trembling too, more evidence that the hope Steve had been trying hard to keep contained was now out there, out in the open.
"Are you sure that's all it was?" he asked, quirking his eyebrow in such a perfect imitation of Tony that Steve's heart lurched. "'Cause I'm pretty sure you almost dented the ceiling with how high you just jumped."
"There's no one that I trust more," Papa said as he touched Peter's cheek with his bandaged hand. "And what about you, little guy, are you doing okay?"
Gulping down the rest of the lukewarm coffee in his cup, Tony ran through all of his calculations again, huffing out a sharp breath when he arrived at the same conclusion he'd come to an hour ago.
"Yeah, I think you're right," Tony whispered once Peter had done it again two more times. "You wore the kid out, honey."
"It does sound pretty cool when you put it like that," Peter said. He quirked an eyebrow in Dad's direction, asking a silent question that Dad answered with a slight shake of his head.
Hanging up the phone, Tony gave Steve a tentative smile.  Truth be told, he was just about as scared as Steve was, both about Steve’s health and his impending confrontation with Obie.  But somehow Tony also knew that just by getting the ball rolling in the right direction, instead of constantly feeling like he was trying to push a boulder uphill, he was already winning.
"But whatever HYDRA did to them obviously didn't work right," said Bruce. "'Cause now they're both dead, and neither one were successful—"
That its demons were going to be particularly difficult to control. Steve's had already taken to tormenting him during the few moments he'd managed to sleep in the last three days, and he had a feeling it was only going to get worse as time went on.
They were even going to drop off one of Dad's cars at the school for Peter to use since his own car was still up at the Compound, something that Peter hadn't even considered asking for.
And if the photos were able to do it all justice, Peter knew that Papa was going to be absolutely floored once he saw everything.
"And look where it got us!" Dad shouted. He slammed his palm down onto the counter, causing Peter to jump. "All it got us was a blown-up house and your papa nearly shot to pieces!"
"All right, then I think we'll all get out of your hair," Bruce said, gathering up his multitude of references and papers. "And obviously we'll let you know as soon as we find anything new."
Didn't Phillips always tell Steve that the clock never lies?  Along with all of the other stuff he always used to tell him, over and over and over again until Steve could recite them all in his sleep?
The lady giggled again, prompting Peter, who was busy dusting the shelves a couple of rows away, to hide a smirk.
Like the movie he and Gwen were going to see as soon as the school day was over. Peter had been looking forward to their date for over a week now, as it would be the last time he'd get to be alone with Gwen before she left for England.
—Tony dug the pads of his fingers into Steve's biceps, feeling the lines of hard muscle hidden beneath his Army dress shirt. Steve was so incredibly strong, but Tony worried that even he was going to eventually falter under the enormous pressure of trying to battle all the demons that life kept throwing at them. Pretty much ever since he'd been found in the ice it had been one thing after another, with very few breaks in between.
In fact, Tony was fairly certain that their last three or four dates hadn't consisted of much more than two or three long makeout sessions broken up by a few minutes of snack time.
"Oh God, it's the Chitauri!" Peter cried as dozens of the bumpy, scaly, whale-like creatures began pouring into the skies above them, each carrying at least thirty of the Chitauri warriors. They were accompanied by what seemed like hundreds of their chariot-like speeders, which began zig-zagging across the sky above the Avengers, almost like they were taunting them.
"Well, anyway. You think maybe we could double-date to the dance?" asked Ned. "Since Betty's in charge of a lot of it she's not gonna be able to hang out with me as much while we're there, so I was thinking—"
"You sure you're okay with this hockey game idea, sweetheart?" Steve said once Peter had skipped towards his room. "You were being pretty quiet during the discussion."
He was shushed by Tony's armoured fingers brushing across his lips, his beautiful face etched in concern mixed with frustration. "I know what you want, babe, but I've already told you a million times that it ain't gonna happen. There's no way in hell I'm letting you do these raids without me, so you're just gonna have to let that idea go. We're in this thing together, right?"
At first glance the file appeared to be nothing but gibberish, and gibberish written in Russian at that, which Peter had been expecting given that it came from a HYDRA facility. He squeezed his eyes closed, looking away from the screen as he rubbed at them. He probably should've grabbed his glasses out of his backpack before he started working, but he honestly didn't even know where he'd left either of them at the moment, and he didn't want to risk running into one of his dads before he was done.
"No, I can't imagine it is, given all it's been through," Gwen said. "I assume he's under a doctor's care?"
They came within seconds of each other, as they usually did, with Tony's arms wrapped around Steve's shoulders and Steve's face buried in Tony's neck. They remained there clinging to each other for several minutes, exchanging soft kisses and caresses until Steve was finally able to stop trembling.
"Well, you probably don't remember that the twins are graduating from high school in about three weeks—"
"Oh no, Papa, I'm so sorry!" Peter said as he rushed forward, gathering up a few of Steve's papers that had fluttered to the floor. "I didn't mean to scare you!"
"I'll be the one who decides what's a waste of time!" snapped Dad. He pressed a quick kiss to the top of Peter's head. "If Strange won't help us, then we need to get the ship up and running, and we need to do it like, right the hell
name on the side of the building, which means that it’s also Pete’s name,” Tony pointed out.  “And if he’s old enough to know what we do here, then he’s also old enough to start having some say in it.”
“No, no, it’s not that.”  Steve huffs out a sharp breath, wishing that he could somehow press ‘pause’ on this conversation so he could better organise his thoughts.  “It’s just—I’m not—”
“S’eve?” Tony suddenly mumbled, so softly that Steve barely heard him. His eyelids fluttered, trying to open. “S’eve, where’s Pete? Is he—is he—?”
He trails off, mumbling things about angles and force and pressure, finally pursing his lips as he looks up.
"Sounds good, big guy," Tony said. Bruce gave a nod, barely avoiding bouncing off the corner of the counter before making it out the door.
"Peter!" Papa shrieked, more panicked than Peter had ever heard him. There was nothing that Papa hated more than feeling helpless during a battle. "Hold on, little guy! Dad's coming!"
"So far, so good," Tony said. "Phillips said O'Brien hardly even tried to resist once he realised they had his palace surrounded."
"So it should've been a piece of cake," Lang continued. "And as soon as I flew overhead and realised that it wasn't just some old warehouse, I should've turned around right then and there. But I didn't. I thought all you guys lived in the Avengers' Tower full-time, so I thought I could still do it."
“Yes, he damn well could’ve helped it, Pete!” Tony snapped.  “And I don’t care what he meant to do, all I care about is what he
Tony's throat tightened, and he squeezed his eyes closed, refusing to respond. Even after being together for four years and married for two and a half, it still amazed him at times how well Steve could read him.
Peter shrugged. "Eh, I don't know. Pretty sure none of us have come across any mermen yet, so… who knows? Maybe that's one mythical place that's actually still mythical."
As soon as the doors closed, Tony tipped his head forward, his forehead resting against Steve's collarbone as his trembling arms wrapped around Steve's waist, squeezing him with every ounce of his strength. As difficult as the last few days had been for Steve, he knew they had been even more so for Tony. He also knew without a doubt that Tony had not yet come to terms with the realisation that he was now dependent on his formerly-disgraced father, the very man who had neglected him for most of his life, to attempt to save their son.
I'm pretty sure that won't go over very well with Falcon," Tony rushed out. He let out a loud moan as Steve wrapped his lips around the tip of his cock, grabbing onto Steve's soaking wet hair. "Steve, baby,
"Yep. Gotta show 'em who's boss," said Bucky. He gulped down the last of his superwater, swiping his wrist across his mouth. "How much do you wanna bet that it'll be the best thing you've ever flown?"
As long as nothing weird happened, Peter’s finger would eventually be as good as new.  His heart, on the other hand…
"Ladies and gentlemen," Phillips began. "So as not to venture too much into what you might call hyperbole, I am
"You never even saw a doctor once we came back from Afghanistan, sweetheart, so how can you be sure that there's nothing—"
“Ahh…”  Tony trailed off as he made a tiny adjustment to the valve, creating a point three second delay in the release of the fuel into the main body of the missile.  “Okay, so… run it again for me, yeah?”
"I have to," Peter finally answered. He let out a hapless shrug, biting his bottom lip. "Otherwise, what's the point? What's going on, it needs to stop. It all needs to stop. 'Cause if it doesn't, then what happened to my papa's papa, and my Uncle James, and to you, it'll just happen again to someone else down the road. And that's just not okay."
"I guess I'll know it when I see it," Peter said softly. There had to be some clue he could find that would give away a possible location. Disrupted wind patterns, a break in a treeline,
"Tony!" Steve tried to shout as the sparkling bolts of coloured energy began flowing up and down Tony's arm, extending across the right half of his chest and up to his neck. But his cry jammed in his throat, firmly held in place by his heart, which felt like it had been transformed into a solid block of ice.
"Yes, that's correct, but we gotta be a bit faster on the button or we'll never win this," said Gwen. "Peter, give me a one-sentence explanation of the Polish Solidarity Movement."
Only this time Steve’s cheeks and chin were covered with prickly blond stubble, his lips were swollen and cracked, and his body was covered with a thick layer of sweat and grime, which meant he had probably been lying there for the entire weekend.
"Yeah, I've seen it," replied Gwen, rather dismissively. "Avengers' Tower is located in my dad's new precinct, and he took me around when we first moved into the neighbourhood."
"Eh, just another stupid problem with Damage Control," Dad grumbled, tapping rather firmly on the tablet. "No big deal, nothing for you to worry about."
"Well, then he probably won't miss these too much," said Tony. He looked over at his husband, attempting to bat his eyelashes without being too obvious. "Are we done here?"
"But you didn't, honey, and that's all that matters," Tony said firmly. He didn't want to add that he was also more than a bit flattered at how Steve had defended his honour. Now wasn't really the time for one of his ill-timed attempts at humour. "Can you tell me what you said?"
"Yeah, okay," Tony said, gasping as his HUD shifted to Steve's face, so bruised and swollen and bloody beneath his matted facial hair that he was barely recognisable. He was lying on the floor, propped up against Peter and holding Peter's hand against his chest with a white-knuckled grip. Peter looked up as Tony approached, whispering something into Steve's ear that caused him to try and push himself up to sit.
HYDRA was trying to retrieve the sceptre. And they were using someone who could apparently move faster than the drones could target in order to get it.
"Please work, please work, please work," he muttered as he tapped the Enter key and the override went to work, pulling all of the files that Dad had transferred from the HYDRA facilities the team had raided back in the fall. He let out an excited, "Yes!" as hundreds of documents began scrolling across his screen, the ones already decrypted highlighted in yellow. Biting his lip, Peter selected the first undecrypted file that he saw, dragging it across to his second screen so he could take a closer look.
Steve shook his head in amusement as he headed down the hallway towards the bedroom. Peter was so much like Tony. So much so that Steve felt like he frequently got little glimpses of what Tony could've been like as a teen if he'd had a more supportive home life. While Tony had told Steve that he'd adored his mother, his father, Howard, was at best a distant and neglectful father and at worst emotionally—and occasionally physically—abusive. And, based on what Tony had told Steve about his mother, it honestly seemed to Steve that she hadn't been the most attentive parent either, often leaving Tony solely in the care of the family's butler, Mr Jarvis, the man who had inspired Tony to create his UI.
"Pete!" Peter heard Dad cry as he flailed his legs, his fingers clawing at Thanos' hand as his spider legs deployed, trying to pull him out of Thanos' grip.
sucks, but I seriously cannot tell you anything else about it right now,” Tony said firmly.  “Now, what I can tell you is that even though Steve’s having trouble, he’s still a grown man.  He knows how to take care of himself, so he will be fine this weekend while I try and figure some stuff out.  Okay?”
"And make sure that at least two are specifically assigned to Pete whenever he's out of the Tower, all right?"
"It has indeed been double-checked, sir," answered JARVIS. "And triple- and quadruple-checked, before you ask."
The female alien's lips twitched. "We have blood to spare," she said in a low voice. Then she raised her weapon arm into the air, crying out some kind of call to war as the ground surrounding the landed transports began to rumble, releasing what appeared to be some kind of rabid, six-legged war dogs, not too unlike the wargs from Lord of the Rings. Steve's heart began to thud as he, Natasha, and T'Challa hurried back to their warriors, Steve's hand gripping his shield so tightly that a bolt of pain shot across his knuckles.
Tony shuddered, sliding the glasses from Peter's face before burying his nose into his hair. "I know it is. But goddamnit, bud, do ya think that you and Papa could make it just a little less dramatic next time? I mean, geez!"
"Do you really think you and Bruce will be able to crack Pym's formula?" Steve asked after they had gathered up his shield and the particles and piled into his truck, heading down I-81 towards the city.
"Oh, don't worry, I won't tell anyone," Peter assured her. "I was just wondering if you knew how I could get out of here?"
"No, Papa, I'm not gonna!" Peter stated, cringing as Dad flew back up, hitting the alien repeatedly with his repulsor blasts as Papa jumped forward, trying to take out the alien's hammer with his nanite shield. Peter knew that Papa had to be already off-kilter since his regular shield was probably in its usual spot back at the Tower. He could create a shield with the nanites in his suit, but he couldn't use it to attack since he couldn't throw it at anything.
I know we didn't hear too much from Peter in this chapter, and I do apologise for that. The next chapter will open with his POV and I do believe the wait will be worth it. :)
, another thing he’d had to add on earlier that day following a mishap with a harried young mother and her overtired toddler, and
"The last thing in the world that I want is to be separated from the two of you," Papa said, his voice raw, like he'd been shouting at the top of his lungs for the last three days. "But I know I couldn't live with myself if I let anything happen to you, not if I thought I could prevent it. And the way I see it, the best way to keep you both safe is to get you as far away from here as possible, and preferably before this bill gets passed. Because I wouldn't put it past them to come banging on our door before the ink is even dry, and that's just not something that I'm prepared to allow. Not while I'm still alive."
A pause followed, like Obie was daring him to back down.  “Well, okay,” he finally said.  “As long as it doesn’t go any longer than that.  Don't want the Army to start thinking that they need to run back to Hammer Industries or something.”
"With the armour's current configuration, I would estimate an opposing force of up to fifty million Newtons, sir," answered JARVIS.
don't think you need to be worrying about anything like that," he said gently. "And you know it makes Papa sad to even hear you talk like that, so… why?"
"But not to me." Tears spilled down Tony's cheeks before he could even attempt to stop them, the mere thought of losing Peter too much for his exhausted mind to even contemplate. He gathered Peter into his arms, breathing in the green apple scent of his hair that he'd always loved. "Not to me, buddy, you got that? I don't—I don't—"
about the fact that my son is sitting in a hospital room dying a slow death while they sit around on their collective asses and debate about whether or not I'm right about this stuff! Which I am, just in case you were wondering!"
Or give him a heart attack, which is mainly what Steve worried about. Dr Cho conducted cardiac examinations and tests on Tony's heart function on a regular basis, and everything pointed to it being as healthy as it could be, but Steve still worried about him. He still didn't eat very often unless Steve or Peter encouraged him, he still didn't get enough sleep, and he still drank enough coffee to supply an army, none of which was good for keeping his heart healthy.
how scared you were when you were trapped down there! Your eyes are completely incapable of lying, and they were screaming volumes at me the whole time, so don't you dare try and insult me now by trying to tell me that you're fine!"
"Or not-so-presumed," said Tony. "They'd start with their definite enemies first, and guess who'd be at the top of that list?"
"Yes, we will," Steve agreed. "But how? The other people from that list are probably still out there, and if one of them manages to get his hands on Peter again, then—"
Fighting against everything in his being, Steve finally broke away, pressing his forehead to Tony’s as he tried to regain his lost breath.
"Eh, it was okay," Peter said. He dropped his backpack onto the opposite couch, raking his fingers through his hair as the smell of garlic, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese wafted down the hall from the kitchen. Papa must've made his famous homemade pizza for dinner.
"Yeah, I think we've finally got 'em nailed down," he said as he checked his fuel gauge again, wondering why they hadn't yet been called back to base. "Who would've thought it would be so tough?"
Steve’s quiet for a moment, grimacing as the pins-and-needles sensation ramps up its repair of his leg, his mind searching for where he’s heard something like that mentioned before.
Tony shivered again as Steve's left arm slipped around his waist, pressing his back up against Steve's broad chest. His head tipped back against Steve's shoulder, his eyes fluttering closed as Steve reached for his bar of soap, the plain Ivory soap that he'd used ever since he was a kid, and began stroking it gently across Tony's chest.
"Well, I'd really appreciate if you didn't let 'em get here, sir!" said Carol. "We've still got at least ten seconds till we're there!"
A part of him, the tiny part that he only dared to listen to late at night when he was alone, did wonder if maybe, just maybe, the government didn't insist on spending so much of the nation's money on constantly upgrading their military prowess, that they might be able to come up with something that could benefit everyone, not only the military.
"Really?" Steve said excitedly. "I thought we could even invite the rest of the team if you want, it might actually help distract Peter a bit if we did… you know… so…"
"Huh?" Quill said, looking up from where he and Gamora were huddled together a few metres away. "What'd you say, Mr Man?"
For a moment, Steve was too stunned to even speak, his eyes wide in disbelief. Out of all of the odd things he'd seen in his lifetime—
Tony was cut off as Steve added a third finger, his hands clutching the sheets in a white-knuckled grip as he writhed against Steve's hand. "Baby,
"Go ahead and order whatever you want, bud," Tony cut in. "I'm just gonna go and check on him while we wait, hmm?"
"In the morning, gotta put in some mingling time first," said Rhodey, jerking his head towards the gaggle of military officials conglomerating over in one of the corners. "I'll let you know if I pick up any gossip."
"Whoa, whoa, hold on," Peter said as he stepped between Tony and Strange. "All right, can you guys just step back here a bit, please? 'Cause this bickering's not getting us anywhere."
Tony scoffed, catching his bottom lip between his teeth as he dug under Peter's blanket and pulled out his waterlogged phone. "JARVIS?"
"I think I've got the MAUDE glasses just about ready," he said. "I've had JARVIS running every single simulation that I can think of for the past three days, so as long as you and Bucky are still good to go, then—"
"I know, sweetheart," Steve said as he tugged off his shirt, heat searing across his body with every touch of Tony's calloused fingertips. "I
Finally situated against the wall, Steve sucked in a slow breath, tipping his head back as he tried to get his sluggish mind to start working. His memory had been almost useless lately, too murky from pain and grief and dulled by never-ending hunger and thirst to function more than what was required for basic survival. He knew that HYDRA was drugging him, and the red-haired woman seemed to have some kind of mind-control powers as well, such that Steve had now developed an almost Pavlovian-like fear response to even the sight of her that most likely wasn't helping anything.
"I saw all of it," Steve said, a wide grin on his handsome face. "Looks like you did it, sweetheart."
, honey, he's a police chief, and they don't get into a cushy precinct like ours without some kind of influence," Dad shot back. "And I just wanna know what kind of influence he's got."
Steve's heart began to thud as he looked up and saw an incoming projectile aiming directly for the palace. About three seconds later it crashed into the same protective shield they had just flown through, sending bits of flaming debris shooting in all directions.
"I need you, sweetheart," he whispered, desperate and needy as his shaking hands slid Tony's suit jacket from his shoulders, tossing it towards the chair in the corner. "Need you so badly."
The climax I have planned for this fic is based on a specific swimming race, one that will be revealed at the story’s conclusion.  However, I would love to hear any and all guesses you guys come up with in the meantime if you’re interested 💗
“You're scared,” Natasha says, sighing heavily.  “Look, Steve, I don't know what happened in your last relationship because you haven’t told me.  And that’s fine.  But what I do know is that every day I see you beating yourself up for something that, given everything I’ve seen with how you treat other people, absolutely cannot be your fault.  Or at least, not entirely your fault.  So unless you’re an actual psychopath who’s a master at hiding your double life as a serial killer or something, I’m guessing that you're holding onto whatever happened before as a reason not to open your heart up again.  And, I’m sorry, Steve, but that makes me sad.  Because someone like you deserves to be loved.”
“I know you love me, Papa.  You tell me and show me every single day,” Peter said again.  “And I love you too, which is why I want you to be free of this!  Uncle Sam’s always saying that if you can take the obstacles sitting in the way of your recovery away, that you should do it, and this is the biggest one!  And I know you can do it, Papa, I know you can!”
"Spiders are not insects!" he wheezed as he broke free. With a snarl, Thanos then picked him up by the shoulders, launching him directly at Dr Strange, knocking him flat.
"I know it has," said Grandma. "And it's okay to be sad about it too. It used to make your papa pretty sad to have to watch all of his friends play stickball and hopscotch when he was too sick to participate."
After flashing his ID badge at the security guard, Steve steps out into the pool deck.  Almost instantly he smiles, the enthusiasm of the cheering crowd giving him a much-needed boost of excitement and energy.  As he heads over to his lane, Bucky grabs onto his arm, jerking his head in Shostakov’s direction.
"We'd need to somehow get all of his medicines to her too," added Tony. "Pete's on a literal boatload of meds, so—"
Working for the Langaran military was a job that most civilians could only dream of having, so what in the world could Anthony Stark possibly be so sad about?
"One of the things I've always enjoyed doing in my downtime is visiting some of the sick kids in the hospital," Steve began in a wobbly voice. "Since I thought I'd never have any kids of my own, it's been kinda my way of pretending that I can be a father for a couple hours a week. I went to the hospital the afternoon after Peter was admitted expecting to see another little boy, but when the nurse told me that he'd been discharged she suggested that I visit with Peter instead. That was the day before the very first class that you taught on the X-302s."
"Sure thing," Bucky said as Steve tugged on his arm, practically dragging him towards the exit. "See ya, Mr Stark."
Steve also seemed to love being outside, judging by the various drawings in his book, yet another thing he had in common with Peter. There were several drawings of various trees and flowers, a couple of the ballfield where they'd had most of their picnics, a few of the X-301 and X-302 aircrafts, and one portrait of an older woman whom Tony guessed was Steve's mother. Tony's smile widened as he pictured the two of them sitting there on the bank of that lake that he loved, their two heads bent towards the other as they sketched whatever caught their fancy while he worked on whatever project caught his.
Tony glanced up, briefly catching Steve's eyes over Peter's head and seeing exactly what he was thinking reflected right back at him.
"Anyway, have you heard from Fury at all?" Steve asked. "Has he been able to get a handle on the damage?"
And under no circumstances was anyone to allow Tony or Peter to return to Earth until their safety could be guaranteed, both publicly via a press conference or something similar, and in writing. Long gone were the days of simple handshake promises or giving someone "your word", yet another thing that Steve sometimes lamented about the twenty-first century.
"No, I know that," said Peter. "What I was gonna say is… I'd like to do it too. The experiment. I wanna do it."
"I have—I have heard that before," Steve gasped as he slipped his hands underneath Tony's sleep pants, cupping his glorious round ass as his hips rolled up to meet Tony's. "God, sweetheart, I have
"Well, thank goodness for our modern views on sexuality, hmm?" said Tony. He rose up onto his tiptoes, pressing a soft but lingering kiss to Steve's lips, one that had both of their hearts thudding by the time they broke apart. "And thank goodness that Pete took it upon himself to inform you of those modern views."
"Okay, now that's just not fair!" Peter cried as the monster swung again, this time landing an uppercut that slammed Peter flat against the sand, knocking all the air from his lungs in one fell swoop.
“Oh, come now, Steven!” Shostakov says, wiggling his hips.  “Word on the street is that you enjoy a good-looking man in a racing swimsuit, eh?  Even when you can only look, but not touch?”
He trailed off, not finishing his thought, but Tony didn't need him too. He already knew what Steve was getting at. And it made sense, he supposed. Not only did Steve come from a time where the father of the house was supposed to have all of the answers—or if he didn't, he was supposed to fake it, like Howard—he also was a world-renowned military strategist. During the war, it was Steve's strategic missions with the Howling Commandos that were responsible for taking out the entire Nazi deep science division, even sacrificing himself in order to thwart the psychotic Johann Schmidt's carefully laid plans.
Barely even blinking, Tony watched as Dr Goldman returned, informing the shocked nurse that he'd gotten a hold of Tony Stark, and that he would be arriving at some point during the night. Then he tweaked a setting on one of Peter's monitors and left again, presumably to wait in his office for Tony's arrival.
He gasped again, shaking his head. He couldn't go there. He just couldn't allow himself to spiral down that far, where he might not be able to recover.
Tony huffed in frustration as he turned to face Peter, ducking down as he tried to make eye contact. "Yeah, well, first of all, I never said that you said anything like that. And secondly, you can drop this whole attitude thing that you've got going on right the hell now, or you can mosey right on back upstairs to your room, understand? I'm already edgy enough about this whole thing without adding all of your excess teenage grump."
"Just tell me the goddamn truth!" Phillips yelled, and Steve's belly gave a swoop at the colonel's tone, brash as per his usual, but also with an underlying measure of fear that Steve had never before heard.
As much as they both didn't want to admit it, Peter was no longer the tiny, sickly eleven-year-old kid that Steve first met in that awful desert. He was now a superhero.
A blast of fear suddenly hit Tony like a repulsor shot, nearly causing him to double over. He'd been hoping against hope that somehow all the SHIELD people had been wrong, because… well… none of them were him.
But he also felt like he should tell his dads first, since it directly affected their entire family.
It’s as if the gun goes off directly beneath Steve’s feet with how quickly he leaps from the block, entering the pool with the smooth grace of a professional diver.  The cool water sluices easily across his freshly-shaven skin as he counts out six butterfly kicks before breaking the plane of the surface.
Tears pricked Tony's eyes, and for a heartbeat or three he had to fight the almost overwhelming instinct to look away. Steve had always worn his heart on his sleeve. From pretty much the first moment Tony laid eyes on him, he could tell what Steve was thinking and feeling, even as he tried to deny it. And sometimes… well… sometimes Steve was just so transparent that Tony was almost overwhelmed by it. The amount of love that Tony could see every single day in Steve's beautiful eyes and his gorgeous smile, and feel in every single one of his tender touches… he sometimes felt that if he wasn't careful, he just might end up drowning in it.
Peter had just opened his mouth to reply when the girl turned her head, looking back at Peter and Ned. Peter's cheeks flushed hot as he locked eyes with her, and he gave her a very awkward smile, flushing even deeper when she smiled back.
"Gwen," Steve gently cut in. "It's all right for you to be sad about—" He broke off, unable to say his son's name for fear of breaking down himself. "We're all going through it. All of us, and trying to suppress how we're feeling only makes things worse in the long run."
"She's going to have to," answered Dr Strange. "As I'm sure you've all already realised, Thanos' resolve to obtain the Time Stone will be formidable, which means we absolutely cannot underestimate him. With the Time Stone in hand, Thanos can manipulate time to his heart's content, no matter what the outcome of the rest of the battle down on Earth."
“Dad, it’s okay, I’m right here,” Peter said, choked with tears as he placed his hand on Tony’s left arm. “You did it, Dad. We won.”
"Yeah, but now Peter's not here anymore," Steve said, gasping as soon as the words left his mouth, the realisation hitting him like a machine gun blast to the chest.
he thought, his muddled mind unable to even complete the simple sentence without hissing in pain, as if even the process of thought was enough to activate it.  He was immobile, which he supposed made sense given how frozen he was, while his eyes, which he had been attempting to blink open, immediately slammed closed again as he fought against the almost overwhelming urge to cry out.
"No, sweetheart, he was fine! He was perfect!" Steve answered, his eyes glassy as he studied his husband's face. "He—he came through one of the portals, the kind that Dr Strange used, and—and then he saw us, I mean, the other us, and he said—"
He broke off as Peter pulled hard on his shoulders, forcing them both to the barren, dust-covered ground. Tony's heart froze when he saw that Peter's legs were already gone, so consumed with terror that the entire universe shrank down to just his son's frightened face, and the hand he reached up towards Tony.
“I have placed your usual order with The Three Amigos, sir,” replied JARVIS.  “Estimated time of delivery is twenty minutes.”
"I'll ask, okay?" Being at Gwen's house surrounded by her parents and very noisy brothers wasn't exactly Peter's first choice for spending time with her, but it was still better than nothing.
"That must've been the guy that caused the lake to freeze over last summer." Peter rubbed at his eyes behind his glasses, his heart thudding as the file went on to comment that while the cryokinesis test was moderately successful, the subject himself didn't survive the attempt.
“Ah, you might wanna leave out that last part,” Steve says.  Readying his shield, Steve sucks in a deep breath and steps through the window, not realising until he’s broken the plane that instead of him stepping through on his own volition, it’s almost like he’s being pulled.
"Thanks," Tony whispered, and Steve's throat tightened. Clearance or not, it bothered Steve that Tony felt he had to constantly thank him for showing him what he considered basic kindness and respect.
"Facial recognition confirms one of the men to be Dr Stephen Strange, former head of neurosurgery at New York Hospital."
"This guy really is just a goddamn cheater!" Sam yelled as below them, Thanos raised his blade over his head.
They would have to sit the whole team down and debrief them, once it was all over. They owed them that much.
“Ah, don't you mean the freestyle?” Peter asks.  Only his swimming teachers at the Y have ever called it the front crawl.
There was a short pause, as if JARVIS was contemplating Tony's statement. "I do recall Captain Rogers repeatedly expressing in the past that he has no interest in wearing armour, sir?"
It was almost as though Tony Stark, a man who could literally buy happiness, was actually miserable.  And that thought, as strange as it might’ve been, made him seem even more endearing.
"I'm sure Tony never thought he'd be doing a lot of things," Steve said evenly. "But yet, here we are."
"Yeah," Tony whispered, his upper lip curling into a sneer at the mention of Justin Hammer. "I'm pretty sure we can count that asshole Davis as one of 'em, and the dude who sponsored the bill that Pete found, and most likely the president too, but as for hard evidence, that's probably gonna be pretty scarce, babe. HYDRA's done a pretty damn good job of hiding its tracks so far, and I don't see that changing until they want it to change."
"Oh, you know. Hanging in there," Tony replied, ignoring the stab of pain piercing his heart. "Not much else he can do."
"Ha ha ha," Steve said, chuckling as they stepped out of the Compound's front door. Tony squinted as the sunlight hit him square in the face, digging his sunglasses out of his pocket as Steve offered him his arm.
Stepping into the hallway, Steve paused for just a moment outside the double doors before pushing them open, his heart fluttering as everyone turned to look up at him, with Tony giving him an approving wink.
"You can head right to bed when we get home if you want, little guy," he said, in that kind, fatherly voice that he always used with Peter. It never failed to amaze Tony how complex Steve was, how he was so much more than just the persona that the public saw, the symbol they knew as Captain America. There was his Captain's voice that he used in the field or when giving instructions to the team, there was his polite-but-cool voice that he used with members of the press or people he didn't know well, there was the sweet-but-firm fatherly voice that he used with Peter, with more emphasis on either the sweet or the firm depending on the situation, and then there was what Tony loved to call his bedroom voice, that low, husky voice he reserved only for Tony that could get his blood racing in about zero point two seconds.
the gauntlet's metal fingers made as they snapped uselessly against each other was so small it was almost pathetic. Aghast, Steve could only gape as Thanos' face rapidly transformed from triumph to shock to rage as he glanced over at Tony, on his knees with his right arm held out in front of him, the six infinity stones locking themselves into place within his nanite armour.
Thankfully, the kitchen was in the far back of the house, and the dulled-down noise combined with the sight of Gwen looking absolutely amazing was enough to instantly perk up Peter's spirits. The fact that her pretty face lit up as soon as he stepped into the room didn't hurt at all either.
Even now, just thinking about the deep-seated hurt in the boy's huge brown eyes when he spoke of how much he missed his father, hurt so profound that it made Steve hurt to even look at him, made Steve want to punch something for the unfairness of it all.
“Yeah, yeah, I know!” Peter tosses back at him over his shoulder.  He’s neck-deep in one of his dresser drawers, frantically searching for the goggles he knows are supposed to be in there.
"Long as I don't see any issues, huh," Phillips said as he took the stack, shooting Tony a scowl as he flipped through them without even looking. "Tony, you know damn well that there's no way I'd be able to see any issues with these things just by looking at 'em written out."
'Cause it was one thing for him to know that he was going to die soon. Peter had come to grips with that ever since he'd been admitted to the hospital.
if she wasn’t kidding.  Steve is positive that not even his worst childhood beatings could hold a candle to the amount of pain he’s in three mornings a week at physical therapy, and the high level of soreness that lingers during the rest of the time.
"Well, let's not let it get cold then, hmm?" Tony said as he took Steve's arm, curling his fingers around his elbow. Steve, Tony had learned, was quite old-fashioned, always insisting on opening doors for Tony and offering him his arm like he'd seen Howard do for his mother a few times way back when. He'd finally stopped asking Tony if it was okay to kiss him after Tony had insisted they were way beyond that point, that if for some unknown reason he ever didn't want Steve to kiss him or hold his hand or something that he would let him know. Steve had told Tony a few times that he didn't have a lot of dating experience, which Tony still didn't understand because, hello? Shoulders? Arms? Blue eyes?
Steve's body was stiff against Tony, refusing to relax or even bend at all until Tony retracted his arm gauntlets, trailing his fingers through Steve's sweat-dampened hair.
"No. This is no time to be talking like that," Steve said in his Captain's voice. "Now's not the time to give up, sweetheart. You and I… we're gonna need to heal if we're ever going to be able to move on."
Choking back a sob, Tony yelped as he felt another sharp tug behind his navel, indicating he was being pulled from the tunnel. A second later he was standing back inside the training dome, dazed and confused as Steve rushed over to him.
"Nat's right, Cap," Clint piped up. "Trust me, with things the way they are, this is the way to go until we absolutely can't anymore."
Steve thought as he pivoted to avoid a flying elbow. There were always far fewer people out and about before the sun rose. Even in New York City.
The sceptre had been Stane's trump card in trying to convert Peter, and they had to ensure that it got played or the whole thing would be for naught.
No. Steve didn't like it at all. He far preferred helping Tony and Peter recover from their post-battle stress than worrying about his own.
"Breathe," Steve murmured into Tony's neck, his voice breaking and taking Tony's heart right with it. "Tony, I can't remember the last time I was able to take a real, deep breath. It's like my chest is constantly being squeezed, and all I can do is gasp. And then ever since the lake, oh God, I just feel like I'm
—executed a perfect flip off the web rope, landing gracefully about a metre away. For several heartbeats, Tony could only stare at him, certain that he had to be hallucinating or something because Peter—
Even so, Steve was still glad they had made that arrangement, as he and Tony desperately needed some time for themselves. Ever since he had returned home from space to discover that Peter was near death, he and Tony had barely had three seconds to catch their breaths. Getting Peter through his serum procedure and helping him adjust to his new enhancements, all while helping to rebuild two war-torn countries was more work than Steve had ever imagined it would be, and while he was very proud of what they had already accomplished and what they were continuing to accomplish, he was ready to push all of that out of his mind for the next forty-eight hours and focus all of his attention onto his husband.
After returning their trays, Tony and Steve headed out towards the ball field, finding it occupied with a group of cadets who seemed to be having a home run contest of sorts, judging by the sounds of things.
"Okay, then the same question still applies," Tony said. "Who the hell is building all this stuff for them? If it's not me and it's not Howard, then
As soon as the question left his mind another thought slammed into place, hitting Steve with such strong force that he gasped.
"What's he coming up for?" Peter added, squinting at his laptop screen as he added a missed apostrophe. Papa was out running with Uncle Sam, and Dad was on yet another emergency conference call with the Department of Damage Control, and it wasn't like Uncle Bucky to just ask to come up without being invited.
Peter ducked his head, his huge brown eyes glancing up at Tony. "My dad taught me that was the polite way to say it."
"Somehow JARVIS came back to life," Tony said. "And he's already calculated Steve's reentry angle, and—"
"Colonel Phillips? You forget that I'm the one who's reading all of your team's flight reports everyday," said Tony. His lips curled into a smirk as he added, "Phillips was gonna make the announcement by the end of the week, once everyone's gotten through at least one re-entry practise session, but right now it looks like it'll be you, Barnes, and Danvers who'll be going up on the trial mission, with Wilson as backup."
"Dad, it's okay," said Peter. He held out his hand, stepping towards Strange. "My name's Peter, by the way."
Not that she'd ever say anything, or even acknowledge that she knew Tony while on Air Corps grounds. Carol may have been Tony's best friend's girl but she was also an Air Corps pilot, something that she valued way too much to go babbling about Tony's personal life to her teammates, especially since she was technically forbidden to do so. The Air Corps code of conduct even stated as such.
honey, think about it. You were perfectly happy being your hotshot pilot self before Pete and I came along, and now only a few months later we've got you preparing to commit treason. And I am pretty damn sure that that was not listed anywhere on the plan you outlined for your life, so…"
"But I'm not gonna let that happen, Tony," Steve said firmly. "If I see that the situation is heading too far south for us to ignore, I'm not going to allow you or Peter to get caught in the crossfire. I'll arrange for Thor to take you both to Asgard or something, and—"
"I'll make sure whoever studies it reports directly to Helen Cho, okay?" Natasha said. "Would that help?"
"Well, Captain Rogers, you are absolutely correct." Tony shuffled through his slides, locating the diagram that gave the details of the central engine. "The two twin engines are regular jet engines designed to be used under normal aviation conditions beneath the planet's atmosphere, each containing enough power to safely land the aircraft in the event of a single-engine failure, and—"
"I can't wait to see it." Tony pursed his lips, drumming his fingers on his desk as he struggled to think of how to bring up the unpleasant topic.
"His temp is climbing back up, it's just taking awhile," Bruce replied. "Since he can't regulate his body temp well the icy water dropped it really low really fast, but yeah, he'll be all right."
Steve winced.  “Well, if that’s the case, at least she didn't,” he said.  “‘Cause as much as I hate to admit it, there have been a few who’ve looked right past the ring and asked me anyway.”
"No, I would not, 'cause it's not gonna feel like armour to him," Tony said firmly. "If my math is correct, and it always is—"
Peter's ears perked up. He'd gotten the impression from Papa that he didn't enjoy talking about his childhood all that much, and especially not to Peter, so aside from a few basic questions Peter hadn't asked him too much about it.
“No, no, nevermind that now,” Tony interrupted as he took a careful sip of coffee.  “Just tell me what my morning looks like.”
"She does not believe it will do any good," Drax spoke up. "Now that Thanos has the Time Stone, it does not matter how long it takes us to repair the ship. We are doomed either way."
"Yeah, like she even had a choice," Tony said with a rather cheeky smirk. "I mean, you didn't, did ya?"
"Sounds good," Steve said, ruffling Peter's hair. He ducked down as Peter dropped his head again, tilting his chin up to look at him. "Peter, you have absolutely nothing to be ashamed of. Absolutely nothing."
"Well, I sure as hell never thought I'd be looking forward to fighting against Thanos' army again," Clint said as Steve wrapped up his speech. "But if that's what it takes, then—"
"JARVIS!" Tony gasped, trying to open his stinging eyes to decipher the readings on his datapad, which were fluctuating all over the place. "JARVIS, what the hell—?"
"Ah, hello? Do you guys remember me?" the man said. "I'm the one who kinda tried to break into your house a little over a year ago?"
“Ah huh,” Tony said as he tapped his monitor to life.  “And how many of those rifles are going out?”
It was almost funny how quickly Tony scrambled to roll onto his stomach, displaying his perfect, round ass right where Steve wanted it. He quickly slid a pillow under Tony's hips before reaching for the bottle of lube he'd stashed in his bedside table, generously slicking up two of his fingers.
Phillips was quiet for several seconds, his finger tapping on his datapad as more pictures poured in.
“Hey, now!” Tony protested as he curled his fingers around Steve’s arm.  “I’m pretty sure there’s no such rule that says we ever have to stop,
Somehow, even though this race was only about three months after the first, Steve managed to get even hotter.  His arms and shoulders are even more well-defined, and his pale skin is absolutely flawless, like he’s had one of those full-body polish treatments that Tony’s mother used to love so much.
accompanied by the sound of clinking chains as it swayed causing his adrenaline to spike, and he stepped back a half step, aiming a series of quick right-left-right jabs that finally sent the bag off its chains and smashing against the wall, spilling sand as it went.
And, if the way Steve's eyes darkened as soon as they stepped inside their bedroom was any indication, Tony wasn't the only one.
"Yeah, I know." Pushing himself up, Peter practically fell into his papa's open arms, squeezing his eyes closed as Papa's strong, steady heartbeat filled his ears. "I'm just… I don't know, I think I'm just—"
It also spooked him a bit, if he was completely honest. Tony had always prided himself on being able to keep himself emotionally closed off, with only Peter being allowed inside the massive iron walls he had so carefully built around his heart. Walls that Steve then managed to tear down a chunk at a time beginning only a few days after they met, right in the middle of the godforsaken Afghanistan desert.
Thank you so much for all of the wonderful comments on the first chapter!  This story is very personal to me, and I’m thrilled that so many of you are enjoying it! 💗
