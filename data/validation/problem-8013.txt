‘I’m not so sure anymore,’ he murmurs, glad they’re in one of the bedrooms away from everyone else.
As always do let me know what you think and if there is anything in particular you'd like to see. I hope you're still enjoying the story.
‘Maybe we should hang up the shield and suit and let these two take over,’ Steve laughs, catching the apple that Wanda throws at his head. At the smile Steve sends him Tony can tell he’s as happy at this turn of events as he is.
‘Empty room, now!’ Peter says, unfortunately nowhere is empty enough.
Tony looks down at the tablet in his hands in amazement, trying to work out all the emotions he’s feeling over the gesture. Steve had seen he was going stir crazy, had decided to go against Pepper’s instructions, and was encouraging Tony to
‘That doesn’t include the
‘I’m not encouraging anyone!’ he protests. ‘Unless by existing I’m encouraging them.’
‘Shut up about your damn nose,’ Wanda rolls her eyes.
‘For now,’ Steve smiles, putting his gun away as security officers come in to deal with the rest of the squad.
‘He’s been gone nearly an hour, he just said he wanted a shower, how long does it take to shower?’
‘But?’
‘You didn’t stop him either,’ he points out.
Pete, it’d break me if they did.’
‘We don’t tell anyone until we get back from defeating Thanos,’ he says, ‘I just…we don’t know what’s going to happen Steve, and some of us might not come back. If I’m one of them I don’t want Pepper to feel unloved. I don’t want her last memories of me to be of me leaving her. I want them to be of me loving her.’
He wonders.
‘Probably,’ Sam laughs, ‘and she wouldn’t have done it if you hadn’t been boasting about your sniper skills.’
‘Don’t try and carry the weight of the world, Pete, it’ll kill you before any supervillain does.’ Peter opens his mouth to ask, noticing the look in Wade’s eyes, but the merc’s face suddenly has a grin and he’s moving the conversation. ‘Besides not
‘You’ll be fine for the demonstration,’ he reassures him, but Peter can see the smile slip a little and has a bad feeling Steve hasn’t realised
‘That sounds like a challenge to me,’ Bucky enters their conversation, putting an arm around Peter’s shoulders. ‘What do you guys think?’
‘Why do I get the feeling I’m the only one who doesn’t know what the topic is?’ his friend asks.
‘Excuse me?’
‘Put him with Bucky, that’ll sort him out,’ Steve laughs.
Except what happens next is not something he was expecting.
Bucky opens his mouth to retort when the worst sound he has ever heard rips through him. He screams, trying to cover his ears against the noise, and sees Steve and Thor doing the same next to him. Even T’Challa, protected by his suit, is brought to his knees.
‘Let him finish, Cap,’ Nick says softly.
‘This is true,’ he lets himself enjoy the embrace for a few moments and then pulls away. ‘How am I such a screw up that the man who is supposed to be my godfather wants me out the way? Am I really that terrible a person?’
‘Maybe.’
‘But-are you- I mean…’ the teenager looks at the badge in his hands. ‘Are you sure? I mean…how do you know I’m not going to screw it up?’
‘Tony?’ the soft voice has him turning to look to his left. Bright blue eyes, wide in disbelief, look back at him.
‘As a lawyer or as Daredevil?’ he asks, he assumes Matt hears his intake of breath as he chuckles. ‘Foggy knows, Peter. It’s only Karen who doesn’t, and I’d rather keep it that way.’
‘Both?’
‘Of course,’ August replies. ‘Shall I go and organise some hot drinks and food for you while you work?’
‘Of course, May,’ they chorus.
‘I said I’d give it a chance.’
‘Why don’t you guys go ahead? We’ll join you in a second,’ Bucky tells the others, waiting for them to go through the doors before turning to Steve. ‘You alright, Stevie?’
‘Pretend? I
‘What about your “friend”, Fury? Any news on them?’ Steve asks.
That’s when Peter realises he has two other messages from the man he hasn’t replied to.
‘I’ve got an idea,’ Peter says, darting forwards and pulling out a web-shooter; the teenagers quickly wraps webs around the shoulders and upper torso of the motionless man and then gestures towards Thor. ‘Let’s see if we can get him up, the webs should stop our skin from coming into contact with his; or at least enough to get him up to the medical wing. I’ll help you take him, I’ve got the fastest healing so that way if it does come through I’ll heal up quicker.’
‘Love you too, Dad.’
‘And you, Steven,’ Thor nods, ‘and I thank you for waiting for me before you claimed victory. These are some new friends of ours: the Rabbit and the Tree.’
‘What you thinking about, Stevie?’ Bucky asks after a few moments of quiet, leaning back against the wall next to him.
‘Can it be on anything at all, or you got a specific topic?’ the blond asks, coming over to sit opposite him, drying his hands on a towel.
Deadpool shrugs and looks away. ‘Look I’m a merc because I’m good at it and the pay’s fucking awesome. I don’t get a lot of chances to do the good thing.’
‘Thank fuck it’s you, Snowflake, I thought I was going to have to listen to Francis’ droning. Glad to see you made it out.’
‘I can,’ the other man replies, ‘but not the same kind of magic as Loki, and not the same as Wanda.’
He sets her in the back seat next to Vision as Rhodes rides shot gun. He climbs in behind the wheel and can’t stop the smile on his face as he starts the engine, noticing the clasped hands of the pair in the backseat.
A/N: Hey everyone! Happy New Year!
‘They’re fine. I just updated them on what happened earlier. I think they’re going to spend tomorrow having a bit of a rest after the journey and looking over the plans for the site and then they’ll head over the day after and check it out.’
Bucky lets out a bark of laughter. ‘I’m sorry your
That and Steve had agreed before he could open his mouth. Then Steve had given him the big blue puppy dog eyes, which by the way are in the running with Peter’s brown ones for the best set of puppy dog eyes out there, and he’d caved.
‘Wade.’
‘Get ready for a lot of bonuses then,’ Wanda growls.
When she’s gone Steve turns to the group. ‘Before we talk any more about our next steps we need to get more people here. Doctor Strange should be here for one if he’s in danger for holding one of these stones; we should probably get hold of T’Challa as well.’
‘Wasn’t going to suggest it,’ she tells him. ‘Alright, here’s the new plan boys: I’ve got you on the cameras, you start getting everyone out and I’m going to work out your quickest route, when you’re ready I’ll direct you where to go and help you avoid all the guards. When you get to the van you get everyone on board and I’ll set the timer on the charges and meet you there.’
‘Steven Grant Rogers I swear to God if you say you are not going to fuck me through that mattress because I’m still recovering I am going to-’
‘Peter!’ Strange is kneeling next to him, rubbing his back and speaking calmly, getting him to breathe and stop hyperventilating.
‘Surprised at the song?’ Pepper laughs as he attempts to lead her in a dance.
‘Them on their wedding day,’ he huffs a laugh and turns to Steve, ‘bet Dad looks more how you remember him here.’ He offers the photo to Steve.
‘I’m not worried about
‘Do you need help to stand brother?’
‘Wait, you want
to go to bed,’ Steve pouts later as he somehow manages to manhandle his boyfriend through the door and dropping him unceremoniously onto the bed.
‘Tony I-’
‘The monsters that lock you in your room when you’ve done something bad,’ she replies, lip quivering. ‘The ones that shout and make loud noises and throw things at you.’
‘I shall close up here and inform Wong what is happening and join you shortly.’
‘I’ve already- oh never mind,’ Natasha rolls her eyes.
‘I dread to think,’ Bucky moans.
Peter does his best mock salute, causing everyone to laugh. ‘How did I do, Cap?’
The team fill them in, but it’s not encouraging.
Steve fumbles with the tie at his neck, his fingers shaking with thoughts on what he's about to do. 'Dammit!' he curses as the material once again slips through his fingers.
decide to do some proper training other than working out in the gym. No matter what Steve might try and insinuate, Tony
‘Just don’t go scaring me like that again yeah?’
Resisting the urge to chuckle Steve figures he better try and save their youngest recruit from this awkward conversation. He knocks on the door and opens it enough to stick his head through. ‘Tony says dinner will be ready soon kid, you better head down before he has to track you down himself.’
The red-head looks up at the inventor in Steve’s arms, then back at Hammer. ‘Tony-’
‘Not necessarily, but I’m not sure it’s worth funding some of them still. Some aren’t actually going anywhere so there’s not really a lot of point in continuing to support them, the funds would be better used elsewhere.’
‘Huh,’ Bucky blinks, ‘wasn’t expecting that.’
‘What’s Nat if not a normal person?’
‘And what is that?’
‘Tony! You alright?’ Steve’s voice sounds worried.
Ororo sighs. ‘I wish I could come with you, I wish I could help in this latest struggle, but-’
‘Oh shut it Stevie. He left the team after the war didn’t he?’
‘Peter-’
‘Nope. Didn’t think
‘He is not my adopted son, he’s a kid I’m mentoring.’
‘Wade I can hear you talking about my ass,’ Peter sighs. ‘Can we hurry it up please?’
‘Oh my god did you see the way Spider-Man flipped over Deadpool?’
‘Technically I won it, I didn’t buy it,’ he shouts after the boy’s retreating form. ‘Tony can you control your kid please?’
Peter just sits and looks at him with his mouth hanging open. ‘That’s it? You wanted to have a talk because I confused Led Zepplin and AC/DC?’
‘Show off,’ Bucky mutters, Peter just sticks his tongue out at him.
‘Nebula. She’s hiding it well, but she’s about one- nope she’s gone,’ she laughs.
‘No, because I think there’s something straining at his and Wade’s relationship and he won’t talk to anyone about it. I’m worried it’s going to break them up; and I think I know what it might be and therefore why he doesn’t want to talk about it with anyone.’
‘I thought you were supposed to be going camping this summer?’ she responds.
? I’d just told you-’
is what your assignment was?’
‘Over there,’ Wong points to the junction. The four of them hurry along the street, Steve and Tony moving people out of the way of flying debris. As they turn the corner what they see grips Tony’s heart with the kind of fear he hasn’t felt since he was flying above these very skies with a bomb above him. There’s a spaceship spinning in the air above the street, slowly coming to rest on the ground.
‘Boss?’ FRIDAY’s voice interrupts his little piece of tranquillity.
Bucky glares at him and turns back to the table, going to the opposite side and climbing underneath to start getting it ready.
‘How is my favourite arachnid superhero this evening?’ the excitable man asks, sitting down next to him. ‘Want a taco?’
‘I’m driving,’ she says instead of answering as they walk along the corridor.
‘We don’t know,’ she replies, and Peter can tell just how worried she is. ‘All FRIDAY could tell me was that they reached the dig site, Tony activated his suit and then she lost contact with them. She can’t get the comms connected so we have no way of contacting them.’
‘No Tony,’ Natasha cuts in before any of the others can. ‘Wanda, Vision and Strange all agree there’s no way we could have predicted this would happen, and it was best it happened now when she had better control than earlier, otherwise the effects could have been catastrophic. If she didn’t have the kind of control you’d helped her get we probably wouldn’t be having this conversation now.’
‘Not a soul,’ Bruce replies, ‘though I can’t say I’m not relieved.’
‘And we appreciate it,’ Steve pats him on the shoulder. ‘Right, Thor, you’re in charge. How are we getting this tree down?’
Strange sighs. ‘There was a magician that came here and attacked, he was one of our enemies but badly trained and barely had any skill so I was able to fight them off. I’m still not fully recovered from the battle at Kamar-Taj, however, so it has left me more drained than before.’
‘But why?’ Steve asks, fury coursing through him that someone would be that callous with regards a human life. His friend’s life.
‘Kid cut the crap,’ Tony’s looking pretty pissed now.
‘I’m not running away, Rhodey.’
Slowing to a jog as he exits the main school doors, he notices the crowd around the two Avengers has diminished enough to be easily spotted through the bodies. Peter holds up his bag like a trophy, grinning despite himself, and Steve shoots him a smile and two fingered salute before turning and attempting to manhandle the Winter Soldier into the car before he can say anything to the teen.
He tightens his arm around Steve’s waist, reaching with his other one to link their fingers together. ‘You’re a bit of a sap aren’t you?’ Steve chuckles, and it helps to relax against him.
‘You leave them to me! Don’t you fucking dare try to take them on.’
‘Do you want me to make you something, Tony?’ Natasha offers, he gives her a grateful smile and she slips from her stool to the fridge. ‘Bacon and eggs alright?’
‘Are you feeling alright? You never stay in bed past seven on a good day.’
Bucky grimaces at the memory. ‘Yes, though I hope we don’t have to do it again.’
‘You take after your Mom then.’ Peter states, looking at one of the other pictures. One of Howard receiving a medal for his service during the war.
‘Umm… oops?’ he grins sheepishly. ‘I may have put too much in them.’
‘Look, it’s not that I-’
‘Oh yeah!’ Clint grins. ‘I think your exact words were: don’t let anyone call me, FRIDAY. And then she asked about Pepper and you changed it to: don’t let anyone other than Pepper call me, FRIDAY.’
‘Or,’ Peter pipes up, ‘we could do all that
. How do you?’
‘Peter are you sure you don’t mind watching Rosie for us?’ May asks again.
‘Come on let’s get you guys to the car,’ Sam says, putting an arm around Peter’s shoulders and pulling the boy to his feet. ‘You want a ride home?’ he asks Ned.
Love always,
‘Vis, you got all that?’ Wanda asks into the comms.
‘I swear to God, Hammer, I’m going to rip you five new ones if you don’t get to the point,’ Tony growls at him, turning back to face the hologram.
Peter watches as Mr Harris goes up to speak through the window. ‘But we’ve been invited as part of the school visiting program. We were told to arrive and give a reference number rather than having a pass being issued. Perhaps if you called up to the facility one of the Avengers would be able to clear this up?’
‘Anytime. Now come on! I’m hungry.’
‘And then we’ve got an activity for you to see how much you took in, and how well you can think on your feet,’ Natasha finishes.
Tony snaps his mouth shut and nods, and the nanites that make up his suit surge over my hand, encasing it in the gauntlet holding the stones. Raw power like you wouldn’t fucking believe fills my whole body. I thought I’d known pain before, that’s all a walk in the frickin’ park compared to this shit show.
Bucky sighs again, but nods and, after a brief pause, starts talking.
‘Clint you alright?’ Bruce asks, frowning at the archer.
‘About bloody time!’ Peter turns at the sound of Tony’s shout and suddenly remembers everyone else in the room.
Hope you enjoyed these two chapters. Let me know what you think about them, especially with regards Tony and his hydrophobia. I'm afraid the rest of the team are just starting to catch on to how broken he is, and now they're going to try and do a bit for him what he's been doing for them. Also the Stony action will start picking up soon I promise.
‘Hulk strong!’
‘Spending the evening with Ned?’ Natasha asks, quirking an eyebrow at him. ‘I thought we agreed you would lay low.’
‘Maybe it makes sense with the rest of it translated?’ Steve suggests.
‘Wade…Strange says-’
Peter grins. ‘I know. I’ve been waiting to do that since Nat first took me for a training session.’
‘I did
‘Boss?’ FRIDAY’s voice rings out. ‘There’s something entered the atmosphere over Wakanda. Seems to be several craft and heading in this direction.’
‘Define trouble? I mean he thinks I went and worked as a sex worker when I disappeared on the Europe trip.’
Tony can feel a headache coming on by the time they break in the early afternoon; they moved to the briefing room and he’d gotten FRIDAY to get the others to join them when they were ready. Scott and Clint had just arrived so they’d agreed a break was in order and they would catch the other two up on what they’d agreed so far.
‘We do?’ Sam asks.
Considering she knows exactly where all the exits are, which tables have the sharpest knives for if she needs a weapon quick, plus there’s… ‘Point taken.’
‘He was under mind control, Sam, you know that, and anyway he’s changed and helped us….’ Bucky trails off and Sam sees some understanding dawning in his eyes.
‘I have not adopted him,’ Tony grumbles.
‘Come on, come on,’ he mutters, ‘pick up goddamn you!’
As always here is your sneak peek:
‘Well, well, well,’ the familiar voice says, ‘I would say I’m surprised, but considering what I’ve been hearing I’m not really. What can I do for you, Stark?’
‘What?’ Clint looks between the two red clad men, blinking a couple of times, but never once lowering his bow. ‘Hang on.
‘Anyone else want to try pulling that shit?’ he says as he empties his gun and takes out his katanas. He looks over at Tony. ‘Get him out of here, Tin Can.’
Peter nods. ‘Thanks, Mr Stark.’
‘If you think you can scare me into telling you who my benefactor is you can think again, Anthony,’ Hammer sneers. ‘It’s only a matter of time before he gets me out of here, and you can’t touch him.’ The man laughs. ‘That’s the best part of this whole thing
Peter laughs and shakes his head as they walk towards the bar. ‘Don’t worry I promise to give you some warning with the others. Hey Wade?’
Wanda turns to look at where Steve is pointing and sends blasts of magic towards them, sending the group sprawling to the floor. A soldier comes at her from the side and breaks her concentration as she moves out of his way. Steve scrambles to his feet and barrels into them, grappling him to the floor.
‘Come on Big Green,’ Tony’s hovering in front of him, and trying to dodge flying debris, ‘we never said you couldn’t join in, we just didn’t know if you’d want to come out or not.’
‘Seriously?’ Valkyrie looks at her king as if he’s grown an extra head. ‘You were a prince and you never learnt the dances?’
They land on the rooftop after a silent flight and Peter stumbles away from Tony, pulling his mask off.
‘Speed it up, FRI.’
‘And you said you’d had a crush on your childhood friend?’
‘But Tony-’ Steve starts to protest.
Natasha takes out the letter that is sitting on the top and opens the envelope as Sam pulls out a bright red knitted sweater with an Iron Man helmet and snowflake design across it. She laughs as she reads it, then puts it back in the envelope.
‘Alright, alright,’ he cocks his head to the side and puts his hands on his hips. ‘What if I gave you a potential out if you’re ever caught without your mask again?’
‘Yeah well you should have been the one catching anyway.’
‘Pete you don’t look too good,’ Harry puts a hand on his shoulder, ‘do you want me to get Widow?’
‘Tony?’
Steve is at his side, trying his best to hide him from view, Natasha is on his other and effectively silencing any more questions with her glare alone. Behind him the rest of the team is following.
The title says it all really... plus we have Shuri and Peter's reunion, and Peter overhears a phone conversation.
‘Can I have it? Just in case?’
‘Wouldn’t be so foggy if you didn’t have so much alcohol in there,’ Loki grumbles and scowls at his brother. ‘I am
‘Please don’t tell me it’s Doctor Strange,’ Tony groans.
‘It must be a bit confusing being back here and us being in your face,’ Peter reassures her. ‘It’s understandable a few things might have got a bit jumbled.’
‘Wade.’
‘Mine,’ Rocket cackles, and then races off to see where else the other team was planning to attack from.
Vision doesn’t often find reason to enter the training room unless it’s to help Wanda experiment with some new variation of control of her powers. The main issue is, other than Wanda, there isn’t really anyone that he can safely train with that will test his own abilities. He supposes, if Thor had remained on Earth then he would have trained more with the Asgardian, but as it is he tends to stay away from the room and only takes part in larger group training sessions.
‘He tried convincing me the Star Wars prequels were not a travesty to mankind. Get him out of the room.’
‘As soon as the celebrations are over,’ Strange reassures her, ‘we’ll get started.’
Love always,
Before he can ask what the inventor means, the door in front of them opens and a young man gestures them forwards. ‘Mr Stark, Captain Rogers? They’re ready for you.’
Loki is reintroduced to the team, Peter's relationship with Wade comes to light, and the team discover who Tony has been talking to
‘The Queen would organise plays and entertainments,’ Valkyrie adds, ‘and they would last through the whole celebration, even during the preparations, and they’d all lead up to the big dance at the end which would open the feast.’
‘No he’s going to
‘Stark,’ he answers into the silence. ‘The bastards were using
‘I better head home before Mr Stark gets paranoid I’ve been drugged or something. I’ll speak to you soon, Deadpool.’
‘What is it Pete?’ he pauses before he enters the elevator.
. But if I think you’ve taken him before his time I will find a way to destroy you and bring him back. Don’t you
Thor sighs, looking at the drink swirling in the bottom of his mug. ‘I wish he were with us,’ he admits. ‘I forgot how much I relied on his silver tongue in these situations. Truly I am beginning to wonder how I was able to accomplish
Peter waves her off. ‘It’s fine,’ he tells her, then looks back down at the young girl. ‘I’m Spider-Man.’
He’s frozen. He should have known, even when he had the report from the prison to say they’d identified all the bodies. He should have known. Nothing was ever that easy in his life.
. You fought it and won before remember? Remember us and Vis in Tony’s lab? Working through your memories together. Remember Tony taking you upstairs? Telling you that you weren’t to blame for everything you did? Bucky!’
The look he receives tells him exactly how much of that story his teacher believes. ‘Parker I don’t know what’s been up with you this past week, but I know I’m not the only one you’ve been handing in homework late to, if at all. I’m going to have to give you detention tonight, you do realise this means a note is going to be sent right?’
‘I told you,’ Loki responds, placing a hand on the taller man’s shoulder, ‘that the sun
‘Loki and Thor are using Yule as a chance to mend some bridges between Asgard and Jotunheim,’ Steve explains at dinner that night, ‘but they said they’d come two days before Christmas so we can have a Yule feast together and they’ll stay until after New Year.’
‘Ok,’ all the usual jovialness is gone from Tony’s face now, his patience has run out. ‘If this is just going to turn into you all wanting to attack individual members of the team then this press conference is at an end.’ He starts to walk away from the podium.
‘So let me get this straight,’ Bucky says as they walk down the corridors of Peter’s school towards the auditorium. ‘Peter did a presentation for a history project and his teacher was so impressed it was chosen to be given at this big school event, and we all got invited to come along?’ His tone implies he knows someone is keeping something from him.
‘Yeah, Nat, I am,’ Steve laughs.
Peter needs some persuasion to stay behind from the mission. Bucky and Natasha get the truth about Wade's suspicions out of him.
a traitorous voice pipes up in the back of his brain.
and now I can’t go on a mission because I have
Whatever Vision is about to reply with is lost in the loud, ominous cracking sound that comes from across the other side of the street. Screams sound as the side of a building starts to lean over onto the street, the scaffolding around it doing nothing but bending under the weight.
Steve opens his mouth to repeat what he’s just said about taking Tony home but Bucky’s voice from last night stops him.
‘T’Challa you got anything that might help?’ Steve asks.
‘I’m surprised you think
, he thinks, shaking his head,
Steve glances at the clock. ‘Tony it’s nearly two in the morning! They can’t have kept you in there for nearly twelve hours?’
‘Sure thing,’ the man says.
he thinks,
‘My king,’ Lorena walks back into the common area and addresses Loki. ‘The bodies have been recovered and I have told Dagr to ready the army. Are there any more instructions?’
‘Uh, why the fuck does it look like Elsa sneezed everywhere?’ Wade asks as he enters the common area.
Before Flash can form a response one of his friends calls his name and he goes to join them. Peter’s shoulders sag in relief. ‘Thanks for the help there, guys.’
, Barnes,’ she snaps, turning to look away from him, ‘we’ve got to find Hulk and then we can get back to celebrating Christmas. And we are
He can’t look at him, because if anything this calm understanding and request for Peter to trust him enough to tell him what is wrong is worse than if he was shouting at him. Worse than when he took the suit away. But he also knows that if he tells him about Deadpool, Tony’s probably going to try and run him out of the city, if he doesn’t try to arrest him. And Peter doesn’t want to lose his friend.
‘I’m coming, Pete,’ he mumbles, pushing the suit to full speed and knowing he can get there in time to meet Peter just as his class finishes.
I turn her down. She threatens Peter. I threaten her. I go back to life and everyone is happy and starts planning to change the Accords.
‘I like him,’ Wanda decides, grinning at Peter’s slightly offended expression and taking the bottle of coke that’s offered to her.
‘I was wondering if you’d be willing to help me find something I’ve lost,’ he answers amiably, hands waving around as his nerves increase.
Natasha lingers a little longer by the sorcerer’s desk and he hears her say one last thing to the man. ‘Thank you. This is the closest we’ve come to having him back since the Symbiote.’
‘You’re absolutely hilarious you know that?’ Bucky grumbles.
‘So, you come back to school?’ MJ raises an eyebrow. ‘You’re weird. And this is coming from me.’
‘Pretty sure it’s impossible for him
‘Ugh, fine. So I thought it’d be easier to get everyone together to let you all know that Spiderman will be coming up every other weekend from now on.’
Tony knows Ross is doing it on purpose.
‘I’ve got the bruises to prove it’s working more than just “well” if that’s any help,’ Steve adds.
‘God your hands are miracles,’ he moans as Steve presses a kiss to his shoulder and lays down next to him with a chuckle.
‘Holographic-illusions?’ Rhodes looks to the screen. ‘So that giant ass monster we can see? That could be nothing more than an illusion.’
(See the end of the chapter for
‘Oh bullshit!’ Sam throws the sandpaper back onto the table, reaches underneath and pulls a very surprised Bucky Barnes out by his shirt collar.
‘Doesn’t work on getting me drunk anyway,’ Bucky mumbles as he takes a seat at the breakfast bar.
‘What
‘No it’s not a girl I’m seeing.’
‘We’re just in it for third place right?’ he huffs a laugh.
He watches the trucks pull away, first Natasha’s and then his, then turns and starts running steadily down the road back towards the lab.
‘Wong care to explain
Ororo returns it. ‘We have. I am more grateful than I can say that she was the one to find us and take the time to speak to our tribe; we have become firm friends she and I, and she is always welcome to visit our tribe. No small feat to be so accepted as I’m sure you can appreciate.’
Love always,
‘Really boys?’ her voice is laced with worry.
‘Natasha I assume? Peter mentioned you quite a bit.’
‘Not to mention if Thanos arrives,’ Strange cuts in.
‘What happened?’ he asks, hurrying over to them.
‘Fits into
He hears the kid sigh, but doesn’t add anything more until Peter finally says what’s on his mind. ‘Are you sure it’s a good idea for meet the whole team so soon after everyone’s come back? I mean I did fight like half of them the first, and last, time I met them.’
‘Loki got through to him, he’s taken him back to the jet. I think Bucky’s asking to be knocked out and restrained to be safe,’ the other man responds.
They both ready themselves, both limping slightly, both of them are battered and bleeding. But Peter is fighting with everything he and the Symbiote have combined to keep Thanos busy to give them chance to catch their breath. To give Wanda and Vision chance to run. And Steve is not going to let their youngest team member stand alone, no matter how exhausted and battered he is.
‘Pete? Don’t be scared to take a risk with him. God knows Steve and I danced around each other for far too long, do me a favour and learn from my mistakes. It’s obvious the guy is crazy about you. Now go on and get upstairs, I’ll be up in a minute. And don’t let Bucky wind you up.’
has those schematics up in his brain right now.’
Rhodes laughs in agreement. ‘I hear you there. But after the fight with Thanos, after nearly losing Tony and Wade and Vision, it’s just nice to see everyone together.’
‘Why haven’t you answered your phone?’ she demands of Peter as soon as she steps through into the library. ‘I’ve been trying to contact you for
‘We didn’t,’ Sam tells him, ‘Wanda got extra ammunition for the girls out of the cupboards.’
‘Right, rest up for the rest of the day. Captain’s orders.’
‘What? No!’ Peter says, eyes widening even further as he looks between all the occupants of the room. The giveaway that he’s lying comes from the panicked look of help he gives Wanda.
‘Strange? Strange!’ Steve calls. ‘Strange we got incoming, where are you?’
By the time FRIDAY informed them that dinner would be ready soon as they should finish and start to get ready Loki is able to keep a solid weapon on one arm that can withstand almost as much force as Vision is able to summon, and can summon weaker weapons with his other one with good enough frequency to be able to use it in a fight.
Tony laughs. ‘Well I’m glad you didn’t decide to do it in front of Steve. I mean,
‘An Avengers’ Retreat?’
at the end of the day,’ Peter protests, which generates a round of laughter from the team. ‘What did I do to Vision by the way?’
‘Still no lead on Tin Can?’ the merc’s voice is sympathetic.
‘How did you manage to trust Steve enough to risk it after he left before?’ she cuts across his rambling.
‘Leave this place,’ Loki says again, ‘please. Do not start a potential war with Midgard. We do not need to come to blows.’
‘You train him every time from now on then,’ Bucky grumbles. ‘Where’s my hot chocolate?’
‘If anyone suggests going to buy any more decorations I refuse to be the one to get them down next year!’ Peter’s voice calls down from the attic.
‘Hey! You giant blob of- don’t hit my when I’m insulting you!’ Wade shouts. ‘No one throws my Baby Boy and- STOP INTERRUPTING ME!’
‘Huh? Oh, I mean I know you and Tony gave Ultron the chance to come about then, but it wasn’t entirely your fault he happened. I mean he was sentient right from the beginning right?’
Peter half agrees and half wants to argue. ‘I’ve just got caught up in so much I’ve forgotten all the things I used to do to get around it,’ he settles on saying. ‘I should have thought and taken something down into the labs when I was working, but I didn’t.’
Sam finds a light switch and flicks it, flooding the room with light and bringing Tony back to the present.
Peter easily overtakes him, for once not waiting for him to keep up with his enhanced speed, and disappears down the corridor. Tony nearly collides with Steve and Sam on the stairs as they all head towards the front door.
‘We’ll go for now. Do give Mr Wilson our best and pass on our message; I’d hate for him to miss out on us helping to rectify what Ajax got wrong,’ the first man says. Peter doesn’t dare look out until he hears the first gun be put away. He fills in Wanda with the conversation while they wait for the coast to clear, and then they head back out.
‘I imagine you’re going to anyway.’ He does. ‘What the fuck do you want, Stark? I’ve got a bottle of whiskey to get through and Die Hard to watch and I know you’ve got better plans than spending Christmas Eve with me.’
Strange nods, and suddenly Peter is no longer in control of his memories. He sees images flash past in front of him, all of them from when he was controlled by the Symbiote. He watches his past self attack May, twisting strangely in mid air and landing on the coffee table as he fights for control; he sees his final confrontation with the team on the bridge, and Wade diving after him, then Loki swooping in, seemingly out of nowhere, to catch him and take him back to the waiting Quinjet where Bucky was at the controls, watching just long enough to see Rhodes catch Wade before he hits the water.
‘I’m pretty sure I should be worried that you’re finding my pain so entertaining,’ Steve grumbles as Tony sniggers again when he winces trying to take his jumper off.
‘How long have you known?’ he asks her, feeling Steve’s arms tighten slightly around him.
‘Very well, only the fun ones,’ Thor nods.
and not have to worry. And now you’ve just sprung all my classmates arriving here on me, without warning, and I have to go back to hiding everything in the one place I’ve always been able to relax. Why didn’t anyone
‘Wow that’s so cool!’ Cooper comes to join his sister. ‘Can you lift me up?’ he jumps up and down, holding his arms up.
‘Fine I promise not to kill anyone,’ the man replies. ‘I can still hurt them though right?’
‘I leave in two days,’ Bucky replies, leaning on the rail next to Steve. Steve leans his back against it and looks back at the building they’ve called home for months.
The god lets his book fall into this lap and looks around the room as if he still doesn’t believe him; once he’s satisfied they are in fact the only people here he turns back to him and leans back in the chair, one hand resting against his mouth. ‘Very well, proceed with your request Winter Warrior, though don’t expect me to say yes.’
, he tries to get thoughts to pierce the fog.
‘Let me get Tony onto it,’ Sam offers, ‘he can be discreet when he wants to be I promise. Or Natasha.’
‘I do, Baby Boy,’ he replies, ‘I just…I worry about you.’
‘That would be nice, thank you,’ Steve nods and watches as the man hurries off.
‘Yes,’ she says, ‘and it’s stupid.’
‘Says he was following up a couple of trails,’ she replies.
My heart stops. Pretty sure I actually fucking die for a minute there. It can’t be.
bit of mistletoe is,’ Tony says, then looks pointedly at Wanda, ‘and no one is allowed to try and find out where they were all put.’
Tony presses a soft kiss to his lips, Steve’s hands automatically going to his waist. ‘Took you long enough. Now come on, soldier, it’s
fight, I want to be with the guy that can literally
‘King T’Challa is due in an hour, Master Loki, I am as yet unsure when the group from Kamar-Taj is expected.’
‘The old Expo site. What are your orders Captain?’
‘The fishing business has been in their family for a long time,’ the AI’s soft tones respond, ‘but it hasn’t been turning a profit for a few years. Sarah Wilson is looking at having to sell the fishing boat to pay off her debts, but the boat is not in a good condition and won’t sell for enough to cover everything.’
Tony tries to control his laughter, and fails epically. ‘Oh yeah, Steve’s definitely going to be taking part.’
‘Let me know when there’s enough of a charge I can make a call? I have a feeling I’m going to be in trouble with someone, I may have forgotten to let them know I was leaving.’
‘Don’t worry, Cap,’ he manages a smile, ‘we’ll save some power for the flight back,’ he says, tapping the reactor.
‘Are there going to be more of you pests coming out of these tunnels?’ Lautenus grumbles. ‘Jotuns! Prepare for battle!’
‘Seriously? I’m sixteen.’
Bucky nods, and closes his eyes as he concentrates. ‘He’s alright, he’s with Tony,’ he tells Steve. ‘Sounds like they went down one of the other tunnels. Tony says sorry for not having the chance to put comms in these suits.’
‘Where’s everyone else?’ Tony asks.
‘I think this is the first time I’ve actually seen Natasha anything other than fully with it,’ Rhodes says in wonderment.
‘Can we return to the conversation with everyone else while we have the opportunity please, lovebirds?’ Wanda raises an eyebrow at him.
‘My revealing your secret, Wade,’ Loki says, standing up and pulling his own sweater on, ‘was merely so that proper gratitude can be expressed. Thank you for creating this. I believe these are supposed to “ugly” but I will admit to enjoying wearing mine.’
‘You told me I wasn’t allowed to spy on him,’ Bucky points out with a grin.
‘Tony you can’t mean that,’ Rhodes protests.
‘Winter,’ comes the reply, the blue eyes twinkling in amusement. ‘I thought it appropriate considering the two of us.’
‘Tony!’ Steve calls out. ‘Tony!’
Steve chuckles and nods, brushing back a loose strand of hair from Tony’s eyes. ‘I’ll be fine, Tony, thank you for asking me first.’
‘Already had this conversation, Mr Stark,’ Peter says, finding a broken window and seeing some soldiers have cornered some students below him. ‘Not happening.’
‘What can we expect here? Is it simply a cave or is there more to it?’ Loki asks.
Weasel frowns and takes the disk, looking down at it, then his eyes widen and he looks between Peter and the disk. The other man behind the bar tries to get a look but Weasel closes his fist around it. ‘Piss off and go wipe some tables, Dopinder.’
‘He…I couldn’t do enough,’ Loki’s voice cracks.
‘Thanks, Stark.’
‘This opponent was the fiercest of all in his protection of the prince and the princess,’ Tony’s voice gets quieter now the children are starting to fall asleep. ‘He was their Guardian Angel and would alert any of the other guardians if an intruder managed to make their way to the castle. No monster, no matter how small, no matter how sneaky, could escape his notice. And none of them would escape him.
Everyone laughs at the complete change in the inventor. ‘Hey! I’m sat
‘Sure thing, boss.’
‘Wait! Mr Stark we can’t just-’
‘I may not have known what it was like to be overlooked for a sibling, Loki, but I know what it was like to be looked at simply for what I was able to give the company. I was the golden goose, not a person.’
‘You ever going to tell me why you won’t make a move?’
And fuck you too author lady. I will not be nice to the readers.
‘We should contact Clint and Scott,’ Natasha agrees. ‘If Thanos is heading this way we’re going to need all the help we can get.’
‘Nat? Scott?’ Steve races up behind where Hulk had appeared from. ‘You guys alright?’
‘We’ll come,’ Steve says, gesturing to Tony and Natasha.
‘Is that Mama?’ Sam sticks his head through the door. ‘Hey Mama! Merry Christmas!’
‘Thor unhand him before you make him have to visit the healing rooms before the ceremony,’ Loki sighs from behind his brother, offering Steve a smile when he’s free. ‘Congratulations Captain.’
‘What do you want?’ she growls after a few moments of silence, finally looking up at her visitor.
‘You get so focussed on something when you think you’re right you don’t listen when someone tries to tell you to deviate even a little,’ Steve retorts.
‘The trail is very faint. They are certainly not in the city. I’d be surprised if they are even in the country,’ the other sorcerer adds.
‘Come on, Pete, lets get your food and get back to the others, we’ve been waiting for you to come out of the lab,’ Harry’s tone is friendly and light again as he slings an arm over Peter’s shoulders and guides him along the line to get his food then over to where their friends are sitting.
An ear-splitting roar comes from the café.
‘Bucky’s going to get me back for webbing him to the floor at my birthday party.’
‘Take care of yourself too, Valkyrie,’ Steve smiles at the woman, ‘we’d like to actually get to know you properly at some point. Though I’m not sure how much good you’ll do for Tony’s drinking habits.’
He barely manages to stay still for the rest of class and says a quick goodbye and see you tomorrow to Ned as he runs out of the classroom. They’ve got plans to spend a day in the city. Ned just smiles and waves him off.
‘Clint! We don’t have time!’
‘Course you aren’t,’ Bucky grins.
don’t want you having a boyfriend, Rosie. Now you listen to this carefully, young lady, you are
Bucky laughs and shakes his head. ‘No I said I’d drop by on my way back from training and hurry you along. Or would you rather a hyperactive Peter does the honours?’
A/N: Hi everyone. Thank you so much for continuing to read this series and to all you wonderful people that have left kudos and comments. Please do let me know what you think of these two chapters, I think they were possibly my favourite ones to write of this whole instalment.
‘No,’ Peter shakes his head, watching as he walks into the containment chamber with Loki. ‘No, it’s fine. In a way it’ll be good to see this again. Remind myself there’s nothing to be scared of anymore.’ Strange doesn’t reply as they watch the exchange.
Rhodes is eyeing it warily. ‘That doesn’t mean you can cook, Tony.’
Strange is quiet, but the look on his face is thoughtful so Tony doesn’t interrupt. ‘Alright Stark I shall do my best. But I make no promises.’
‘You mean so soon after my father’s death and my succeeding to the throne?’
‘What are your names?’ Loki asks them.
‘Well,’ she gives Tony a small smirk, ‘I do have one suggestion.’
‘You only say it is important because it was your favourite part of the celebrations and you got
‘Yeah ok so Wade’s not exactly winning prizes for the most stable of personalities-’
Watching him throw the chemicals together, talking away animatedly, Tony thinks Steve’s description of ‘mad scientist’ is better applied to the kid. There’s a smile on his face he couldn’t get rid of, even if he tried, and he’s given up any pretence of doing his own work.
‘It may take me a while to translate them,’ Loki admits, ‘are you prepared to leave me to look at them for a while?’
‘Yeah, promise. I’ll tell you if anything does start getting serious,’ the teen is nodding so furiously that Tony’s worried his head might fly off. ‘Although I did have to ask you something kind of related to dating, but not
, he thinks. His feet seem to be in working order, as do his legs; although even trying to move them a small amount has lots of pain shooting through his muscles. His chest still hurts, and it doesn’t feel like his lung capacity has increased much. He’s definitely lying on a bed, with a sheet tucked around him, but his arms are free. His left arm shifts and there’s no restraints to block the movement. He frowns as he tries to move the right one and there’s something stopping him from moving.
‘Why didn’t you tell them?’ he asks, head cocked in confusion.
sit here while they’re in trouble. Don’t make me. Or I’ll find my own way there.’ For what must be the first time ever he holds her gaze, refusing to back down.
‘Don’t you start going paranoid on me, Pool, or I swear you won’t be able to talk for webbing for a year,’ he growls.
‘Tony!’
Peter sighs. ‘Alright.’
‘It’s Bruce,’ she admits quietly, after the quiet stretches out for a while, the only sounds the faint ones of the grenade moving around. ‘You might want to make these things a bit quieter.’
Bucky just continues to laugh at him, tears streaming down his face. ‘Steve I love you, but you really are an idiot.’
‘Think we’ll find out first or do you think Nat and Steve’ll beat us there?’
‘Think you can get a couple more hours sleep?’ Steve asks, fingers stroking through Tony’s hair.
Steve smiles and nods. ‘Yeah, we’ll wait until the excitement of Wanda and Vision’s engagement has gone down a bit. I just…we nearly lost you, Tony, I couldn’t wait to ask you-’
‘This is-’
T’Challa waves his hand. ‘I think we’re a little past the titles, Tony. What is it you need?’
Mama had returned home yesterday, much to everyone’s disappointment, and May had been called in to work some extra shifts so had driven back to New York on the same day, leaving Peter in the care of the Avengers. Laura had taken the kids on to her parents’ house the day after Boxing Day, leaving Clint, who apparently had little say in the matter, to catch up with the rest of the team. Tony had organised for a car to take them, rather than taking them in the jet for comfort’s sake.
‘We asked for Cinderella and he’s not telling us the proper version,’ the girl pouts.
Please do let me know what you think of this chapter, and thank you to everyone who is reading my stories.
‘So can you actually see? Because how do you move around if you can’t?’
, Thor. We need to continue this fight so this has not all been in vain. Go, I shall be fine.’
a horrible voice, one he has never heard before tells him before he loses consciousness.
have Mexican when we kick ass. Now come on! I’m hungry.’
‘I was in a relationship with someone else and would never have been staring at another person, no matter how muscular they might be.’
‘Do you think they’ll believe we found it in a department store?’ Peter asks the trickster as he continues to dodge enemies and make his way across the room.
‘Wade why don’t you help us instead of complaining?’ he suggests.
‘Section eighteen falling in thirty seconds, my king.’
‘What the fuck you talking about, Francis?’
‘Wanda,’ Strange calls, landing near Tony, ‘you need to destroy the gauntlet.’
* * * * * * * *
‘I shall explain later. But I had help from Doctor Strange. Now we should-’
Loki’s voice reassures them.
eat that much ice cream. You’ll make yourself sick.’
‘Well, how would you both like to come and spend it up here at the facility with us?’
‘I feel sorry for the poor bastard that did that to him,’ his guest shakes his head. ‘You get a name for who did it yet?’
‘Fine.’ They say in unison and they go to join the other two on the chairs, Wade pulling Peter to his side as soon as they are sat down and the teenager can’t help but melt into him. Wade might drive him insane with his over-protectiveness, but he’s never tried to stop Peter from being Spider-Man.
‘Very funny, Barnes,’ she rolls her eyes. ‘Sam was actually talking about a teacher he had in school.’
He nods, resting his forehead against Steve’s. ‘Just a little sore. Been a while since I’d met someone with the stamina to beat mine in bed,’ he chuckles.
‘Just…with Nebula having lost Gamora, got me realising how lucky we were we didn’t lose anyone else. I’m not sure what I’d do without you Nat, you’re my best friend and a sister to me, and it’d break the kids to lose-’
‘For them to run off with the both of you again and us have no idea of how to get you back?’
P.S. NOW you can panic! :P
‘Yeah Tony?’
Natasha grins at him. ‘Race you, Sam!’
Tony laughs. ‘She was looking far too smug for you two to have just gone to watch a film.’ Peter mumbles something he doesn’t quite catch, and Tony leans back in his chair watching the teen carefully. ‘I appreciate you not wanting to scare them off by having the whole team meet them,’ he says, ‘but you know if they make you happy then you shouldn’t have too much to worry about when it comes to everyone approving.’
‘Perhaps when I return, the sorcerer and I can help her improve her ability to cope with the upper limits of her power,’ Loki suggests. ‘Between us we should have a good idea of what she can do.’
‘We shall drink to our hearts’ content on my return Stark,’ the warrior promises him with a smile.
‘Remind me why I put up with you.’
‘I didn’t
,’ Tony says coming up behind Rhodes and leaning into the camera view.
‘I’m nervous as hell, Buck. What if I screw up? What if he decides I screwed up too much in the past and he decides he can’t trust me anymore? What if-’
Steve shrugs. ‘Not my call, neither is it yours.’
‘How long we been at this now?’ he asks, sitting on the table and shaking out his aching arm muscles.
‘I take it you did, right? Although how could the reactor kill you if it was in your suit?’ Bucky asks.
Tony pats his legs through the covers where he’s sitting at the end of his bed. ‘And who told you that, Peter?’
‘You mean you’re still in the closet at school?’ Wade asks.
She looks away not quite able to meet his eyes. ‘I don’t know what you mean.’
‘If not, we’ll soon find out,’ she replies, and launches some more energy at Agatha. Two hit her and one hits the wall behind her.
‘Why Doctor Banner, it’s as if you don’t trust me,’ Loki smirks, making the Tesseract materialise out of thin air.
‘That’s cheating!’ Wade pouts. The bastard isn’t even winded.
‘Well, that all depends,’ he says, and she sees the second he slips into his scientist mode and gets comfortable.
‘I am known as the merc with the mouth for a reason, baby boy.’
‘Yeah I ain’t getting on that thing either,’ Rocket nods his agreement, looking at the ice rink as if it would open a portal to another dimension and swallow him.
‘He’s not hurting anyone,’ Steve says from behind him. ‘He’s already hurt Scott and that’s one person too many. We’ll track him down, we’ll track down Hydra and we’ll shut them down once and for all.’
That hurts, but Steve knows he deserves it. ‘Tony-’
he muses as he wanders towards the gym.
‘-and leave me to do everything,’ Pepper interrupts.
‘Why didn’t you just get someone in every so often to clean up or something?’ Scott asks as another sheet is pulled off and another cloud of dust sets off another round of coughing.
Do let me know what you think about this chapter and where you think this series is going to go. I'd love to hear your thoughts!
‘Thanks Betty,’ he smiles at her. ‘I, uh…probably shouldn’t try for another hug seeing as I nearly cracked Harry’s ribs.’
'I still love you,' Steve whispers, 'I didn't leave you for him Tony, I always wanted to come back to you, I just didn't know how.'
‘I know it’s hard to accept,’ Tony cuts him off. ‘Especially when everyone says that heroes are the selfless. But look at it this way: you throw your life away for someone who ends up being killed anyway because you’re not able to take out the bad guy, you aren’t there the next week to get the bus of school children empty when it’s hanging off the bridge.
‘Right,’ Steve says, obviously flustered already.
‘Is that Ross?’ Natasha demands.
Vision takes that moment to phase through the floor. ‘I imagine nothing terrible, Captain Rogers. Mr Stark is probably being dramatic. Hence the reason for asking us all to come up here.’
‘Ah, and you don’t think Tony will approve?’
‘What’s wrong now?’ Strange grumbles.
. My brain said “Tony will know what to do.” Except you weren’t there, and for a couple of seconds I felt completely and utterly
‘Stane kept her away from you so she couldn’t protect you from him,’ Rhodes says. Tony just nods. ‘Tony, I’m so sorry.’
tradition back.’
. ‘You weren’t to blame, Barnes.’
‘It looks like Peter assigned control to the person that Director Fury was working with,’ the AI answers, ‘his name is Quentin Beck.’
‘Holy fuck,’ Weasel looks at him with wide eyes. ‘What the fuck
‘Hang on, when did she become Natasha instead of Miss Natasha?’
‘My turn,’ I grin behind the mask, taking out the two handguns Tony had given me before leaving with some explanation about extra rounds and better handling and whatever the fuck he was saying. Who cares?  All I got out of it was: these are more fun and cause more mayhem.
‘And you think they’ll be happy to play happy families with you Stark? That the
‘You don’t have to come, Nat,’ he says.
‘Bucky leave it!’ Sam’s voice stops the former assassin, the Falcon kneels down next to Peter. ‘You alright Pete?’
‘Kid it’s been nearly ninety years since I was in school, I’m not going to be much use with homework,’ Steve replies.
Deadpool looks at him. ‘I’m not sure Spider-Man would be able to cope if you lost him.’
‘Did he have a mutation himself?’ Bucky asks.
An early Christmas gift to all my loyal and wonderful readers of 'Another Chance'. You obviously don't have to have read the series to understand this story, but if you enjoy go check out the main series!
If he wasn’t so pissed off he’d find the expressions on everyone’s faces pretty hilarious right now.
‘Wanda you need to move,’ he groans as he feels himself losing the battle. Just as his knee is about to give out and he’s about to sink to the floor the alien suddenly goes tense in front of him and begins falling backwards.
They turn a corner and Peter feels guilty leaving Bucky to face the soldiers alone. He needs to get Ned safe and get his suit on first. They find a storage closet and hide in there, Peter pulls his phone out and hands it to Ned. ‘Call Wade,’ he says, ‘tell him where we are. He can get you to the Quinjet while this sedative wears off. Then I can go help.’
‘Like hell you are,’ she snaps.
‘Wait,’ Rhodes’ eyes are wide, ‘your mother was
‘So what I really want to know,’ Loki hears Bucky say as he enters the common area, ‘is since when are you gay? I thought you took some girl to Homecoming?’
‘Cap!’ Sam leans out the door and shouts down the corridor. ‘Your boyfriend’s finally lost it and he’s taken Nat with him on the crazy train!’
‘How many are there?’ she cuts off their bickering.
If possible Rumlow’s eyes light up even more. ‘We’d be more than happy to accommodate, Mister Stark, we can have the whole squad ready to-’
‘Sounds good to me,’ Peter grins. ‘Want me to pick up anything else for you?’
‘No,’ he shrugs Steve’s arms off, ‘don’t blame yourself. I’m the idiot that can’t be honest about the fact I’m not perfect.’ He ignores any other comments and heads for the door. ‘I’m going to lay down for a bit. I’ll see you at dinner.’
‘Because it’s Captain’s orders,’ Steve interrupts.
‘Lucky you,’ Bucky grumbles from Steve’s side. ‘I think we’re being summoned,’ he nods to where Tony is waving at them.
Tony blinks a couple of times, completely taken aback by the question. Then he nods and pulls out the chair next to him. ‘Sure thing, kid. Let’s take a look.’
‘Once we’ve done this last fight, we’ll have more freedom to move on HYDRA,’ Natasha’s not sure if she’s trying to convince herself or Hope more. ‘We can rest after that.’
Immediately Tony is more awake. ‘What time is it?’
, she muses as she picks at some of the stranger looking offerings,
As always here's your peek at the next chapter:
‘If you think I’m going to sit here and miss the chance to get Buck’s arm fixed-’
‘Want us to win you some more money?’
‘They’ve been attacked,’ he says, his hands curling into fists at his side. ‘Get us landed as quick as you can, Nat. Rhodey? Go on down and scan for them.’
‘Woah, I don’t think I’ve seen Tony look this bad since the
‘Alright, but if you need me to tell him to back off just say.’
‘Look just forget I said anything,’ he says, turning away from the pain filled blue eyes.
Here's a sneak peek for the next story I'm putting up, not part of this series but it's an alternate take on EG after Tony and Nebula arrive back on Earth:
He tries his best to hold back the satisfied smirk at Flash’s face from the last comment, and says goodbye to the rest of the team as he follows the spy out of the door. They stop off long enough to grab his bags before she leads him to a sleek silver car.
‘Judging by that reaction? Probably. At least partly anyway. So let me guess: he had you talking shop right?’
‘I’ll go get mine and drop my stuff off. Where’s Wade?’ he asks.
‘You got me and Steve on the line, Nat,’ he replies.
‘No one important.’
‘No, but I’m not going to risk pushing Peter away by making my feelings as clear as you are. Nat and I spoke to him and got his side of things. And let’s be honest here Elsa: if he can take you out I’m sure he can take out Deadpool if needs be.’
‘Wait, what?’
‘Pete!’ Peter looks up and waves as his two friends enter and come and join them at their table.
He glances back at Proxima. ‘Like Bruce just said: you’re in trouble now,’ he grins.
Even when they faced him in New York she wasn’t as scared of him as she is now. The look on his face is dangerous, and she takes a half step closer to Clint.
‘If you think I’m going to try and get that thing through the front door you’ve got another thing coming,’ Rhodes answers for him.
Captain America.’
‘Wade!’ Peter cries in relief.
‘Please remember to breathe,’ Strange interrupts with a raised eyebrow, ‘I dread to think what the Black Widow would do to me should you run out of air and collapse in my library.’
Tony deals with the aftermath of betrayal
(See the end of the chapter for
Her frown deepens. ‘You can explain a few things to me,’ her tone turns hostile, and Tony blinks in surprise.
Tony barely notices as the two of them leave, but thinks he manages a wave in their direction. He’s jolted back into the present as Sam comes to sit at the bench opposite him.
‘This is stupid, this is stupid, this is stupid,’ Clint chants as he jumps back into the café through the blasted out window. ‘Rhodey? Hulk?’
‘Oh my god, Wanda!’ Peter hides his head in Wade’s laughing chest.
‘You can’t suit up!’ Ned protests, and Peter’s too worried to care about his secret identity any more.
‘When did you even learn how to knit? And how have you done all the others so far?’
idea.’
‘What about the rest of us?’ Wanda asks with her arms crossed.
Wanda laughs and walks up to the man, placing a kiss on his cheek. ‘Hopefully that’ll do for now,’ she says, then walks after Peter.
‘Right shall we get started?’ Tony suggests, grabbing hold of some of the sticks they’re supposed to be weaving together to create something they can then hang other things from. ‘No one is to laugh if anyone gets smacked in the face by a branch.’
’ Peter’s eyes are so wide it’s almost painful as he looks around one of the biggest libraries he has ever seen in his life.
‘You sure it’s not her influence?’ Wade asks, looking impressed.
No sneak peek this week. I'd rather leave a tribute instead. Reading back over the first instalment I realised the first entry into this series coincided with the loss of Stan Lee, and now this final instalment of this part of the series coincides with the loss of Chadwick Boseman.
‘I’ll let you go first, you’ll need all the help you can get.’
‘Aww,’ Wanda wipes away an imaginary tear, ‘my little brother all grown up and threatening mercenaries.’
Thankfully, as far as Tony is concerned at any rate, they agree to leave the invasion and Accord related discussions in the briefing room and avoid talking about it when they leave to get the pizza that has finally arrived. Peter and Wade ran ahead earlier to go collect it, and Tony resists the urge to roll his eyes at the scowl Bucky sends the mercenary’s way.
‘I love you too,’ she tells him, grateful for this one constant presence in her life. They stay standing like that for a while before he gets called away by Sam.
‘My king?’ he looks over at one of the palace attendants who has just entered. ‘Princess Ororo is here to take her leave.’
Tony had looked bad on the video call, but seeing him in the flesh is worse. He’s pale, even underneath bruises and blood and dirt it’s easy to see how pale his is; his eyes have sunken, even in the brief time since he’d been taken, and he looks exhausted. His lips are cracked and one or two bits are bleeding sluggishly. The arc reactor is glowing in his chest, the skin around it caked in dried blood and grime, and looks nothing like the elegant piece of machinery it had always been before. The fingers on his right hand are bent at horrible angles where they’d quite clearly been broken and Steve feels his heart sink. If they didn’t heal correctly there’s every chance the genius wouldn’t be able to invent in the same way ever again, and if that happened Steve was sure it’d break the man.
‘I love you, Pete.’
‘Get the others out, I’m going after her,’ he tells Sam. ‘I’ll send you coordinates when we get there!’
‘Alright. I’ll get Bucky to get hold of Loki. Sure wish we knew where Thor was. Be careful you two,’ she says as she signs off.
‘He’s not
‘The larger group will be with me heading for the front of the facility and to create the biggest distraction,’ Strange continues, ‘Peter, Loki, Thor, Tony I want you all with me to help. Together we should be able to create plenty of mayhem and having Peter
hoping no one would find out about that,’ Wade sighs.
‘Yes my king?’
‘Nice going, Wanda, now he’s going to stick himself to the ceiling and it’ll take me hours to get him out,’ Sam grumbles, disappearing into the attic to retrieve the teenager.
‘Not quite, sugar pie,’ she winks at me, then brings her knee up and sends me sprawling. ‘Ready to go, boss?’
Peter nods and then looks back down at the cover. ‘Well, I’m guessing you heard about the fact that when we got here Vision let it out the bag that I might be seeing someone.’
Thor turns to his brother. ‘Try not to get up to
with all of us. They know us. Take away their inhibitions and we don’t stand a fucking chance.’
‘Boys! Focus please,’ Natasha snaps. ‘You really think it’s him?’
‘Hey you seen Rocket recently?’
‘I’m fine, you lie down you look like you’re ready to pass out,’ he comes to sit on the bed. ‘I just came to ask you something.’
‘All that’s been sent through is that it’s a hostage situation in New York,’ Rhodes answers.
‘I’ll be in touch, Cap. I’ll have to work on getting everyone back one or two at a time, and I’ll need to make sure they agree to any terms. You willing to work with me on this?’
‘Fine, but I don’t want it to be the first thing we say to him when we get back,’ Peter sulks.
‘Wade what are you doing? We need to get on with patrol!’
come out?’
Loki laughs. ‘To mortals here on Midgard yes he was. But even the wisest cannot see all possible outcomes of their actions, for that you need the gift of foresight and even that comes with its own difficulties as its down to how you interpret your visions.’
A/N: Hi everyone. I'm sorry this is later than intended, the past few weeks have been so nuts that my updating schedule has just gone out of the window; it is getting a bit quieter next week so it should be a lot better from then.
‘Any idea when Thor’s going to get here?’ Tony asks Loki as he comes to join them.
he grumbles.
Tony nods. ‘I just…I need to know-’
There’s a pause before Tony quietly answers. ‘Yinsinium. It’s what powers all the arc reactors.’
‘Nice try, Wanda,’ Agatha cackles, ‘but unfortunately you seem to have forgotten one very important thing.’ Her smile turns dark. ‘I take power from the undeserving remember? Kind of my thing.’
Tony just laughs and shakes his head. ‘Come on, kid, let’s not keep our guest waiting.’
‘Nat?’ he asks, head cocked to one side in question.
‘Just explaining that to Loki,’ he answers, ruffling the teenager’s hair. ‘SI funds projects that aren’t related to products we sell, some of it is charity work like this one,’ he pulls up one of the files, ‘that provides shelters for veterans returning from war that don’t have families to go to. They help them get back on their feet and re-assimilated into society. Hmm… wonder if Sam might want to lend a hand with that?’ he muses to himself.
‘A hidden weapon in a way,’ Hill states.
Vision cuts across Steve’s question. ‘I suggest you look at the records for payment for the nursing home your aunt was in Miss Carter.’
‘Alright stop!’ Tony cuts them all off, then moves to one of the sofas, patting the seat next to him. ‘Tell me what happened, kid.’
‘Why would you do that?’ Peter asks, frowning in confusion. ‘I mean I understand with the stuff for the team, but why SI?’
‘If I answer will you leave it be?’ Loki asks. Tony seems to notice his desire to leave the conversation and nods. ‘Yes it was.’
As the doors start to close he looks back at his screens. ‘Hey, FRIDAY? Any idea what Sam was talking about there?’
‘You really don’t think I can-’
‘I am Groot.’
‘Seriously? We are not going to get attacked by a horror villain, and who even has that as the first thing they think of when talking about Christmas?’
‘Am not,’ he retorts. At his friend’s raised eyebrow, he amends his statement. ‘Well I’m not planning to.’
‘Fuck this,’ Bucky growls, standing up and hurrying towards the door.
agree.’
Love always,
‘I- I’m-’
Bucky shoots him a look. ‘Well at least I know who you get your inappropriate humour from,’ he mutters, then steps closer to the graves.
Peter blinks a couple of times, looking up at the mistletoe, then looking back the merc.
‘Huh,’ the dark haired man raises his eyebrows at that, ‘I was genuinely expecting more of an argument over that one considering everything before.’
‘Peter!’ a couple of voices reprimand him.
‘Fine,’ the inventor huffs. ‘One more song?’
‘I’m sure we’re about to find out. FRIDAY can you get the others to meet us at the front doors?’
As always here's your sneak peek:
There’s a big round of applause for Peter as the boy blushes bright red and then retakes his seat. Steve doesn’t hear much from the remaining presentations, but does remember to clap at the end of each one.
I'm hard at work on the Christmas story so do please let me know if there are any requests for what to include and I shall try my best!
RIP Stan Lee.
Suddenly he can’t be near the other man, the sight of blood and brains on his eyelids when he closes his eyes against the burning in his throat.
‘Come on, Tony, don’t be a spoilsport,’ Bucky calls from the centre of the pool, where he’s already treading water. He looks strange without the metal arm.
‘He wanted to rebrand the Winter Soldier,’ Pepper adds quietly. ‘You do realise if anything does go wrong now it won’t be Bucky the media will be focussing on-’
A/N: Hi everyone. So here's my apology for being late with updating chapter. Plus it's my 'I'm super excited because I have tickets to see Tom Hiddleston in the closing night of Betrayal' extra chapter! Yeah so I'm super excited about that, just thought I'd share.
They’re interrupted by a tall blonde woman, looking very apologetic. ‘I’m really sorry to interrupt,’ she says looking at Peter. ‘I was wondering if you could help my friend? He needs to go to the bathroom but will need help finding it. He’s blind.’
‘Yeah told you to go have a look. Might save you a phone call,’ Weasel chuckles, then breaks off when he catches sight of Wade’s face. ‘Uh Wade? Wade!’
‘We are talking about the same Deadpool right?’ Bucky asks from Natasha’s left.
The team manage to get Tony out, and then learn the full price of his time in captivity
‘Drama queen?!? I think I’m allowed to be fucking freaking out, you’re
‘Pepper darling you are not just my secretary, you are also my therapist and personal lifeline.’
So this chapter was a little tricky. I’m not sure I’ve got Deadpool’s voice right yet, but I’ll keep trying. Do let me know what you think of the chapter or if there is anything you’d like to see or are looking forwards to seeing. Any suggestions for help with Deadpool’s voice would also be greatly appreciated.
‘Tony,’ Rhodes’ voice is a little calmer now, ‘please don’t tell me you support this-’
‘Shh, hey come on,’ a large warm hand is on his back and another glass is brought up to his lips. ‘Just take small sips, honey. That’s it.’ Focussing on Steve’s voice helps push back the panic at not being able to breathe and Tony’s able to take gradually larger sips until the glass is empty. ‘There you go.’
Tony’s response is cut off by FRIDAY. ‘Boss? Deadpool has just arrived.’
‘I got your back, Reindeer Games,’ he reassures him as Loki hears the face plate lock into place.
‘Dude I still can’t believe the Avengers came to see your presentation.’
‘We found evidence that Beck did, in fact, have support from HYDRA even if he wasn’t working for them directly,’ Fury admits. ‘They helped supply the materials he needed and some of the funding, though they didn’t exactly use their name to do, hiding it through shell companies. In return he’d support them once he’d got hold of your tech. Seems they wanted more than one option to fall back on seeing as Hammer was still tied up.’
‘My dear, Falcon,’ he replies smoothly, ‘this challenge couldn’t be any simpler for one such as I.’
‘My parents were away a lot as well. Mom had her social calendar and Dad…well Dad was away for a lot of different reasons. So it was just me here with Ana and with Jarvis if he hadn’t gone with Howard.’
"Tony, look, about what happened in Siberia--"
There'd be guards off around the corner, but first, Tony lit-up Doom's ridiculous sci-fi wand-thing-a-mah-bob and jammed it in Doom's shoulder. "Steve, you good?" he called out, dodging Doom's punch and flexing his fingers. His whole body felt taut and stiff, the metal thrumming to life and slowly enveloping him, round and round in strings of red until he was standing in full armor. The night vision kicked on, allowing him to catch Steve throwing said lackeys gently onto the floor.
No one questioned his constant visits. And why would they? Tony Stark was his other half. The whole world revolved around them it felt like. It was convenient. Nothing else, nothing more. (Certainly, nothing to do with needing Tony's comfort. Nothing to do with needing Tony's reassurance. Steve continued to guarantee himself of that, almost too frequently.)
“It’ll be happening, trust me. You and Pep are dumping all the bottles out in the dirt and setting that safe on fire. Cryings all I’ve got left, otherwise I’m going to I’m going to blister my hands wasting my well-paid iron.”
“Absolutely,” Steve said. “How about on our anniversary?”
Doom seated himself and snapped his fingers, signaling the servants to bring them chalices full of ice cold water and a tray of appetizers. Ironman quirked a brow as another servant came to unlock the bindings, releasing his wrists. "As I said, Anthony, Doom's Legion was an invitation," Doom said.
"Yes," Ironman swallowed. "It's not suddenly better because we, we--"
"Love each other. I know. Please, believe me, I know. I know it's going to- to hurt. Maybe more so than knowing what we've done to each other."
They’d be tracking a rogue agent originally out of Russia. Turns out it was simply some moron thinking he had unlimited power, dragging him and Tony into an abandoned AIM facility.
She had left out her sherry. The bottle was corked, but her glass was still partly full like she’d ran mid-sip in a mad dash. Hell, she’d even left her nice, fancy sash behind too.
Natasha scowled at him from time to time when visiting Pepper, but she understood.
Doom chuckled, clearly amused. "Let us make our guests welcome, shall we." He directed his guards, who appeared seemingly from nowhere, to come and assist them through the long, expectedly dark hallways of his castle. He was probably going for the aesthetic, Tony mused, noting the pristine statues and jewels that adorned a few of the open rooms they passed.
Tony hated admitting it, but he kept a star pressed close to his breast inside his coat pocket.
Ironman gestured that they move further away. "T-minus ten minutes till Vision arrives," he confirmed, next, "And I --we, need to talk. About--about what happened last night," he said, feeling awkward, the tiredness sinking in. He'd forgotten it was barely early morning. "I shouldn't have ever kissed you," he tried being stern.
Steve smiled softly, rocking back and forth on his feet almost nervously. "I assumed two trees might be necessary for what I've got planned." He was hesitating to finish, making Tony quirked a brow and motion him to please continue. "Uh, once Natasha and Clint are done arguing about where they'd like the tree to be, I requested we all decorate it together." He took a breath, "And, by we, I mean all of us. Including you." It was a statement, not a question. "So, I decided before-hand, I'd let you blow off some steam--whatever you wanted to do with your two new trees. Blow them up, maybe?"
Steve, in the meanwhile, had huffed, trying to maintain eye contact before he lost his mind staring at the tent inside Tony’s trousers.
"I don't think it's the armor itself he wanted ..." Tony murmured, scowling beneath the helmet. His lackeys were one-hundred percent fleshy-tissued humans, but Doom himself--. He stomped over to it and slammed his foot against the head till it snapped off, the wires of Doom's decoy sizzling and snapping visibly in the air. "Figures," Tony sighed. He commanded the faceplate to slide off and open with a flick of his eyes. "He wants the technology, per say. He probably doesn’t give a rat's ass about the armor itself."
Steve huffed a laugh, "You practically laid on me. I'm your serum-enhanced boyfriend, I kinda like cuddles. Plus, uh, you're cuddling back." He shrugged, his mouth tilting upward into a tiny, god-awful smirk. Ironman tried to muster every ounce of rational thought contained in his and Tony's collective brain before blatantly ignoring all of it--Siberia, their parents, the quiet falling out after Ultron--and jolting forward, kissing Steve with everything he had. Steve moaned against him, reaching to cup a hand around his cheek, taking charge.
"Don't," Ironman growled. "Just don't."
“Excuse me?”
“And of the imposter?” Tony asked, slowly boarding closer and closer to hysterical.
"You have a better plan, then?" Steve nodded, moving quickly.
Eventually, he put two and two together and realized the main controls were connected to the throne on the right side of the armrest, hidden from plain sight. It was in here because Doom tested on his lackeys, didn't he? Of course, he did. Or maybe he just sent them off on ridiculous time travel errands? Most importantly the entire machine seemed powered down. Figures. It was a ploy from the get-go to make sure Tony was close by and in reach. It hardly mattered.
“I’d argue she’s fond of you and hates admitting it.”
See, Christmas wasn't Tony's thing. In fact, it was amazing he wasn't giving into the urge to drown his thoughts with a bottle of Jack right about now (regardless of the fact he'd just woken up). The holidays were always a sort of solemn time for him. His father was never home, and on the rare occasion his mother was, she'd be plastering on her best media smile like he was stupid enough to fall for it. The only worthwhile memories he had were of Jarvis. Butler Jarvis, alongside his precious wife Ana, who'd take take him the kitchen for both Hanukkah and Christmas dinner almost every year till he was shipped off to boarding school.
Ironman considered himself better suited for the situation at hand. Tony shouldn't be subjecting himself to continual trauma over and over again like he does. Like ...they do. Ironman had a better stomach for it and was more than willing to use their MMA training to his advantage, plus a chair or two as a weapon. Finding the exit shouldn't be too difficult, then once out in the open air, he'd summon the armor and they'd be out of there. It defeated Tony’s purpose for getting caught in the first place, sure. Unfortunately for Tony, Ironman thought it was an exceptionally dumb plan to begin with. Well, they both knew it was stupid.
"I'd say to get some of your aggression out on, yes."
Tony was crying, tears staining his cheeks and wetting Steve’s shoulder. “It’s hardly close to over,” He gasped. “But it’s …better.”
He’d seen Tony naked countless times. It was impossible to miss when Tony was being loaded into the Iron Man armor, already drunk and nude. God, Tony was still coated in that slimy shear green goo, erection throbbing painfully, and so, so red at the tip when they hauled him out of it like everything was perfectly normal. Except, of course, it wasn’t.
“Oh, um.” Steve shuffled, clearly bashful about something. “That’s because, er, for you.” And from behind his back, Steve revealed a large bouquet of yes; cheese and herbs arranged just like a regular bouquet of flowers. Specifically, cheddar cheese, which was beyond obvious by now, and a selection of what Tony realized was a blend of sage and thyme.
“And it’s a herb and cheese bouquet,” Tony said. “For me.”
, he slowly calmed down. Nice and slow. This was all just a cruel hoax or it was a miracle. He’d pour Pepper’s glass out and lock up the rest till she returned, and he’d just keep breathing.
Then, without braving their new host's leniency, Ironman pulled out his chair and stalked out of the room. He insisted he know where his and Steve's shared quarters were, stopping in the middle of the barely-lit hall to ask a guard. The guard answered and let him go about his way, but Ironman had no doubt there were guards and probably all sorts of gadgets blocking the exits in case they tried to escape. So, he subtly surveyed the immediate area best he could. Mostly it was all just dark and damp with very few rooms, and then the stairwell leading up towards the bedrooms as he had been told.
It hurt to remember them, now that they were gone.
“Oh,” And then Tony was beaming, making grabby hands for his bouquet. His bouquet. Made of cheese. “I love it.”
Steve was chuckling “I’m not very experience with relationships.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “And, I was maybe a little scared of, well. You know?”
"I, I love you too." Steve flushed more, yet stayed fixed in his spot, staring at Tony.
He swallowed thickly.
“Yes,” Tony cried. “Steve—” He croaked out.
Nope.
"Stark," Doom said, his voice a deep rumble and his accent heavy. "And, Captain America." He announced the latter curiously. Seems like Steve wasn’t a part of either of their plans, funnily enough. Yet Doom was prepared for Captain America all the same, even going so far as to invent special cuffs perfectly crafted to withstand a supersoldier.
Steve ended up giggling, "Tony, you're covered in grime. My clothes are already dirty now from you touching me."
"It's--it's not obvious?" Steve blurted out and Tony almost jumped right out of his skin. There was no anger in his voice, only a whine. He was pleading so desperately that Tony moved to squeeze his shoulder.
"It's in you? Tony what--if that's some horrible euphemism--"
He took a deep breath.
"You're gonna be my evil assistant in the making. I decorate your big tree, you help me dismantle that white one over there and then help me attach a few of its branches, lights and all, to these parts I've been working on." He gestured at the schematics.
Then, once he debated over it, he returned his hand, pressing his nails into Tony's abdomen just enough to leave little crescent-moons indented in Tony's skin. Steve was left unsatisfied when Tony barely reacted, hardly giving a twitch. Hmm. So Steve wandered his hand up to one of Tony's nipples, giving it a few light pinches till it was perky and hard against his fingers.  Once again, Tony hardly gave a reaction.
"How will I, you know, know?"
“So,” Steve said, not meeting Tony in the eye.
He focused on the sweet aroma. It was fresh and subtly sweet, like a garden almost. Maybe a … well, maybe a kitchen or a bakery or something he questioned once he was close enough to pick up on the heavy scent of cheddar.
"Hydra didn't hurt me. You did." Ironman swallowed back the venom on his tongue, the vicious words he wanted to cut Steve open with. To make Steve hurt just as much as they were still hurting now.
"It's some kind of workshop," Captain Obvious clarified.
"The point," Steve continued, "is that I'm simply a guy wandering through Europe. I haven't put on this uniform since ..." He swallowed and turned his gaze to the floor, restlessly fumbling with his fingers. "Since Siberia. The Iron Legion was conveniently nearby, and I thought.. Well, I thought, because I knew, Tony, I knew what it meant. How much it'd hurt to see yet another person stealing your tech... I--I knew I had to do something."
"Regardless, time for that ride, big boy?" He slapped Steve's shoulder.
Jesus, they were such a mess.
He locked the door to his shop, then checked the main floor before locking the rest of it down too, making certain Pepper also didn’t forget her hat again while dutifully ignoring him.
"Good." Ironman regrettably pushed Steve away; only briefly. "We need to get everyone else out, ASAP."
Tony blinked, carefully returning Steve's embrace while doing another scan of the room. "There should be way more guards, shouldn't there?" he whispered against Steve's ear, unintentionally causing Steve to shiver.
“What a fucking bastard,” He bit out. He felt his heart pick up speed, dread flooding the pit of his stomach forty times worse than it had last night.
He managed to snag her as his assistant two months back, much to Carol Danvers lack of amusement. Pepper was efficient and was able to keep up with him. Plainly speaking, she refused to take any of his shit. But the important part was that she was easy to get along with and that Tony saw her as his friend, first and foremost.
"And, about your parents ..." Steve sounded remorseful. Yet, he was right in Tony's little bubble the moment Tony circled right back to the monitor, kicking Doom's head along the way.
“I, oh.” Tony bounced on his toes, outstretching his arms in what he hoped was an obvious invitation for Steve to hug him. “Come on you big doof, hug me. Please?”
Yes, yes. Great name for a separate personality. It was mostly Tony that found it funny. For him, for Iron Man, it was simply his name. His being: forged in the heat that molded the armor and the endless torture Tony had suffered deep within that very cave in Afghanistan.
Steve nodded in understanding, "Someone with that kinda ego wouldn't want an exact copy."
Meanwhile, Ironman gently arranged himself comfortably against Steve's side as Steve went on babbling like an idiot. "I designed the uniform, Steve," He said in annoyance, mostly because Steve was so surprisingly warm. Serum, he had to remind himself. "You never asked," he said in reply to Steve's comment about hand holding. Ironman would have absolutely rejected him, of course. Well, at least for awhile, anyway. Tony, he had no clue what Tony would do, being gentler and that much more receptive to Steve's mere existence. Tony loved Steve first, really.
“Go away, Pep,” Tony said, too exhausted for whatever it was she wanted.
Ana died not too long after, and Jarvis hadn't been the same since. That next year he and Jarvis started making a little memorial for her near the tree, lit with candles and dressed with Ana's favorite flowers. Then, when Tony was finally older and his mother could finally be around more (never his father, his father would never have the time), they had to go and get in a car crash just before his mother's big holiday gala, leaving him and Jarvis all alone. And finally ... finally, years later, Jarvis had died too.
Steve kissed him, threading his fingers through Tony’s oil greased hair. “Next time I’m telling Nat to piss off.” He said seconds after.
"Tony ..." Steve said softly, his face a dark shadow compared to Tony's memories. The purple under his eyes and the utter hopelessness in them forced Tony to come to a halt. Steve Rogers was never hopeless. Never.
"Wow, you've just unlocked the fastest route to get me to hate you," Ironman said. "Am I gonna get a stern talking to, hmm? You're missing the spatula and apron, but, you know, the armor and cape actually might work to your benefit. Kinda can't smack my hand when both of my hands are still bound together, though." He gestured, resting on his elbows and giving his hands a little shake.
Tony could smell the bouquet before he even saw it, rounding the corner from the quad.
“This is pretty much exactly like Viagra, except I think it was designed to promote breeding. Who and what, I’ll advise to ignore. The results must have been quite …unsatisfactory.” Tony was worried. “The only way out of this is to have, you know,” He gestured vaguely with a hand and Steve tried not to glare a hole into his head.
“Widow Barnes likes to remind me how much she despises me,” Tony remarked bitterly.
"It was easier to disguise myself like this. Had a  little inspiration from Clark Kent," Steve explained, gently settling back onto the bed.
Neither Ironman nor Tony could argue with that one. But there was something to be said about an egotistical dictator that freely stole other's inventions without care or concern like a massive dick: bad news. "You've got yourself a deal," Ironman agreed, unfortunately. What else did Doom have on them, and of theirs besides the single Iron Legion unit? That was Tony's entire basis for diving in headfirst like a moron, because Tony constantly lacked any sense of self-preservation. Yet, it was also clear that Doom was seeking something other than just assistance with his ridiculous time machine, and both Ironman and Tony reckoned it had everything to do with their new armor.
Tony sighed, moving out of Steve's space. "Alright, alright. That's my other gift for later." He pointed. "But I still get to watch you bring my new toys in and enjoy the view."
, Tony thought, biting his tongue. "Tony ..." Steve then started mimicking Tony’s previous action by feeling along Tony's wrists in a similar manner. Tony wanted to snort. If Steve thought he was stupid enough to come waltzing into a trap with any of his technology out in the open, Steve was stupider than he  thought. It was, of course, wired directly inside his body, allowing for a direct hit with an EMP to take him straight down because he hadn't figured out a better shielding capability before deciding it really wasn't important at the time.
Just believing Steve cherished his friendship as much as he did Steve’s... That, that was perfectly enough. He needed it to be.
“Tony,” He called through the door sternly. Well, he refused to be shy now.
"Here I thought you were a tech god." A beat. Tony spun in search of the Legion, finding it nowhere in sight. He scanned the room a third time, focusing this instance on just the machines and gizmo's lying around. "They're hollow?" He questioned, full on blasting Doom's submarine-plane open. The hood shot off, smacking the ceiling, completely empty inside. "Okay, what in the hell is going on?"
“Yes,” She said, cautiously. “And I think perhaps you should rest while you're at it. I’ll come round early in the morning, make sure everything's okay.”
Doom chuckled, "Doom assures you, Stark, he has not overlooked your craftsmanship. It's with great honor and respect that Doom has decided to harvest and salvage this Legion at all. You live up to your name, and to your reputation."
“Er, ... I meant Jan, actually. She loves you very much.”
Steve chuckled, “I missed you too. Miserably, you know." Tony heard him cross his arms. "I think I’m driving Red Wolf and Nat crazy asking about you all the damn time. See, they assured me keeping my distance till you were ready was sound advice. Sure, maybe a week or two, but now I'm just hurt.”
"Tony," Steve breathed, shooting up, hands still bound. Ironman failed to resist snickering on Tony's account. Steve Rogers did not deserve Tony's endless courtesy.
And really, he was always there, hands bound next to Steve just as Tony was, sharing a headspace together. They weren't completely separate. But they weren't whole, either. They couldn't hear each other inside their head. His head. They also had no control over who got to be in charge or when. Yet, that didn't stop them from trying to dominate one another. It was a hazy experience at best.
The first thing Tony felt was the cold bleeding through his skin and into his bones. He jolted, his fingers flexing as the binding wrapped around his wrists dug into the delicate skin. He tried blinking, adjusting to the darkness. The darkness ...bound up and gagged inside the darkness. Inside the cave. The blinding sun when he's allowed outside for the first time, stinging his eyes. Shrapnel in his chest. Yinsen.
An idiot Tony apparently liked very much. More than liked. "Okay," he repeated, clinging to Steve long enough to brush their lips together.
"I'd be angry had Tony kissed you. You make my blood boil, what you did. Tony can forgive you all he likes; I can forgive you. Forgiveness means nothing when I can't know whether I'm able to trust you. What will you lie about next? Who will you choose over us? I deserve--we deserve your honesty;o let us in. You didn't wanna hurt Tony by lying about our parents? That's too fucking bad. It's a bleeding wound I don't know how to heal because we … I--" It was on the tip of his tongue. "We shouldn't. Somehow, someway, we do," he finished pathetically, yet keeping his eyes locked on Steve's bewildered gaze.
"Okay," Steve breathed, turning serious and moving to start strategizing using that big, dumb, impressive brain of his. Sometimes Tony envied having a photographic memory and Steve's easy ability to learn new information at light speed. Steve probably couldn't help that sometime he wasidiot.
is able to do that, ma’am.’
Tony and Hope both shake their heads. ‘He came back after we got out of the whole business side of things,’ Hope explains, ‘too busy being in hiding to worry about potential business partners.’
‘Tony, really?’ Natasha pipes up.
‘I should probably put your ring on your finger,’ he laughs; it’s a simple dark grey band, with a small sapphire set in the middle flanked by two rubies. It’s small and fairly simple, but when Steve slides it onto Tony’s finger he thinks it looks perfect on the genius.
‘I’d hoped we still were,’ Steve admits quietly, looking down at the carpet. ‘But now I’m not so sure it’s possible.’
Natasha blinks, trying to hold back her emotions just as she’d been taught all those years ago. It’s a rare occasion she’s glad for her training.
‘Yeah you saved one of the best till last. That’s Tony. Tony is…there’s not really words to describe how wonderful Tony is, Rosie. He’s made me his heir you know? He’s given me absolutely everything, even when I don’t deserve it, and he treats me like a son. I…he’s the father I always wanted, Princess; I didn’t know my parents like you will, I only really knew your Mom and my Uncle Ben as parents and they were amazing, you’re so lucky you get such a wonderful Mommy. Tony…Tony just manages to fill this space I didn’t even realise was
, she thinks, blinking with the force of that realisation.
‘In a way yes it was, Nathaniel,’ he turns to respond quietly to the boy, though still loud enough for others to hear. ‘I shan’t bore you with the details, but in summary: as a Jotun I was supposed to be a sworn enemy of Asgard. In order to try and ensure that I was treated the same as Thor, our father kept my true parentage a secret and raised us as brothers. I suppose he didn’t want me to feel like I was a prisoner as I was growing up, or have me want to turn on the rest of Asgard because I was different to them. Unfortunately, due to the circumstances I found out the truth, the thing he was trying to avoid ended up happening and when I…
‘That is definitely an image I didn’t need,’ Wade says as he walks out of the wardrobe, Tony just laughs and goes back to choosing his own outfit.
‘Took you long enough,’ Francis laughs.
‘Yeah but she’s not pulled any mind control powers on you so you know you’re doing fine,’ he teases, moving away as it’s time for the man’s shot.
‘He said I couldn’t do it,’ he gestures with a thumb over his shoulder to a grumpy looking teenager leaning against a wooden railing. ‘Proved him wrong.’
‘What? Tony? Come on! Back me up here.’
‘The same time he found out who I was. I keep his identity, he keeps mine.’ The two have a staring match across the table. ‘If you’re going to try and stare me down at least have the decency to do it without the mask. Otherwise I can’t tell if you’re cheating.’
‘There’s also some additional energy coming from the Mind Stone,’ Bruce adds, a mirror to Peter on the other side of Bruce and Steve is struck by how much it looks like Tony and Bruce in the middle of a solving a problem. ‘It’s as if the stone is trying to help him heal but it can’t combat the power from the staff. Wanda’s magic is the only thing able to help at all, but even then she’s struggling to get it to heal fully.’
‘They’re sensible and don’t push her,’ Tony adds, sending his friend a grateful smile.
‘Whatever I want?’ he asks, already feeling the grin spreading on his face.
‘Better than expected, Spider-Man,’ Steve smiles at him as they all file out of the training room. ‘Just like always.’
‘You’re not having that either,’ Tony tells him. Then, like the truly well-oiled machine they are, the three of them start running towards their enemy.
‘Very nice,’ she comments, casting an eye around the limo. ‘You’re spoiling us, Tony.’
‘So how do you explain you knowing him so well?’ Sam laughs, then he turns to the three Asgardians. ‘So what do you do at Yule then? I mean I’ve heard Yule celebrations happen here on Earth, but I imagine it’s not the same as yours.’
‘No he’ll just agree to annoy Loki.’
‘I will admit I wasn’t overly surprised when I found out you two were together,’ Fury shakes his head, ‘I just wonder why it took you so long to get there.’
‘Why don’t you put it up, Peter?’ Rhodes suggests, handing him the angel.
‘Can we order in?’ Clint suggests, making a point of sniffing under his armpits. ‘I’m not sure any of us are in a fit state to be seen in public.’
‘You’ll have my army, and my King’s Guard,’ T’Challa says, ‘and M’Baku is always eager for a fight. Send a messenger, quickly,’ he turns to one of his guard, who salutes and hurries off.
‘What? Oh yeah. Damn I’d completely forgotten,’ the super-soldier groans.
‘Well just through this little exchange you’ve relaxed a little more,’ he points out with a small smirk. ‘Just find something to talk about.’
‘Oh please, you’re all ridiculous.’
‘Just…try to keep the noise levels down,’ Bruce sighs. ‘And don’t get him too worked up, he’s in pretty bad shape, Steve.’
‘Unless you want a history lesson,’ Natasha quips, she laughs and Peter hears the sound of something hitting a wall. ‘If you want help with math, Peter, you’re going to have to speak to either Tony or Rhodey.’
‘Tony, basically
‘Let me speak to-’
‘Huh that’s rough, my condolences,’ Valkyrie raises her tankard at the green skinned female.
A/N: Hi everyone. I hope you are continuing to enjoy this story.
‘Or maybe you should let him decide that,’ she sighs as he waves her off and heads back down to his workshop.
‘I guess…I’ve grown used to it? As in now I’ve grown used to it and it’s not freaking me out so much I kind of like having it. I guess…I don’t feel so lonely anymore, knowing I don’t have to explain to someone everything that’s going through my head. It’s also nice to know that someone can tell if, you know, things start going back to how it was before in there.’ He taps his head with a finger. ‘Back when HYDRA had me.’
She rolls her eyes and shakes her head, but there’s a small smile on her lips as well. ‘Alright… well we’ve got Captain Brock Rumlow, head of the squad who obviously knew about Barnes’ condition and covered it up. Then there’s the rest of the squad: Blake Matthews, Andrew Hampshire, Sam Wilson, Luke Albright, Caesar Magellan and Paul Withers. Hang on…’
‘So apparently Papa Tin Can says you have half,’ Wade chuckles, handing the bottle back to Peter.
