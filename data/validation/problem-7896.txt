“Wade- uh-“
the front desk he can call, but that guy will let him hold and wait until he’s put through to the right person, and Peter will be standing there for ten minutes. He doesn’t have that time.
Yaël nodded slowly and then took a sprint to the house.
“Never been better.” Tony resumes his run to the point where he gets to the hallway in front of Peter’s room, where he can see Steve, May and Rhodey with Strange. May has her hand on her mouth and obvious tears in her eyes. Steve looks sad, while Rhodey full of disbelief. It’s the latter that notices Tony coming up their way.
Okay, now he’s just trying to bait him out. Peter should ignore him, so why is he already balling up his fists, ready to throw the first punch?
Whenever it’s Nat’s turn, she just sits down on a chair and starts looking around on her tablet, only paying attention to Tony whenever he raises his voice in annoyance whenever something doesn’t work right – which is quite often since the kid – Tony should just call him Peter now, to keep it simple – has practically been begging to bring Dum-E back here. Somehow, the two do kind of work good together.
“I’ve enjoyed this morning lie-in very much, Steve,” Tony starts. Steve’s smile falters a little bit, as if he’s afraid about what’s coming next.
“They wanted to do us a favour,” Loki answered without turning to her.
Using Flash’ phone, he quickly types in Ned’s number. Then he puts him on speaker phone as he reaches inside his suit to pull out another phone. It’s the one from Steve, and he doesn’t know if it’s going to do any good, calling him, but he has to try. Maybe Steve is nearby? Maybe Steve knows Tony’s number by heart, and he could pass it along. The problem is that Peter just can’t remember the number, and he doesn’t have access to FRIDAY right now.
“Wait,” Tony interrupts, holding up a hand. “So people went all zombie-mode on you, and you think the diarrhea is still the worst part of it all?”
He can see the redheaded girl sitting on one of the blue stools. She’s putting her tangled red curls into a messy bun, and her sneaker-covered feet are making tapping noises on the ground – probably nerves. Peter wonders if he should go talk to her, but then decides not to. He doesn’t even know that girl; why should he? Besides, she’s a bit rude.
“Who’s Wanda?” Yaël suddenly asks, and Peter remembers bringing her up in his train of thought.
he thinks to himself, hating the Mercedes-resembling symbol on his skin. He has trouble putting on his shoes, but eventually he’s ready. Putting up his hood and throwing the bag over his shoulder and after leaving a note for the nurses, he opens the door to check if there’s anybody in the hallway.
“Ah, well, in that case,” Tony returns, taking Steve’s face into his hands and pulling him closer for a kiss. Peter averts his eyes, noticing the other Avengers still standing there, keeping their distance. Dr. Strange is seated down on the ground, with Wanda hovering over him as she looks after him. Peter has no idea how the battle against Mordo went but given that the guy is currently knocked out and being restrained, Peter figures they defeated him in the end. The destruction around them might be another dark stain on their names.
“I have to try. I can’t leave him alone right now,” Steve counters. He starts walking forward again, only to be stopped by Bucky’s hand on his arm. Immediately, he stills his steps, taking a deep breath and realizing it’s shaky. Only then does he realize that his eyes sting.
His hair has grown ever since the last time Tony saw him back at the compound. His beard still hasn’t been shaved. Despite that, he still looks like a goddamn model.
“I’m very alright with that.”
Tony sighs, pulling out his phone from his pocket and tapping a bit on the screen before holding it out to her. On it there’s a picture of him, Steve and Peter. He doesn’t even remember when it was taken, nor who did it. It was just always there, he thinks…
He walks the entire pathway, wondering where it will lead him. He hopes he won’t end up getting lost, since he’s not sure he’ll find his way back so easily. He’s surrounded by flowers, but he’s not able to distinguish one from the other.
“I’m not sorry. We could have lost you,” Mr. Stark says. “I’m glad FRIDAY gave them, just like I’m glad that you’re still here with us, son.”
“They do, Tony. They just don’t want to hear the same story again time after time.”
Steve sighs on the other side of the line. Peter swallows in worry when he feels Tony’s heart beat slowing down gently.
Locking the tablet again for later, Peter walks into the open room of the penthouse. This has almost everything in it; the kitchen, the living room
“Ladies and gentlemen, if you may please be seated, we’ll begin shortly,” he says. Despite the accent, his English is really good, Peter notes. He’s never really heart T’Challa speak, not even in Germany. The idea that he’s fought alongside a King is really mind blowing.
Given that Peter’s often with his head in the clouds he sometimes forgets to grab a copy of the Daily Bugle along with him, which is rather stupid since he’s the official photographer for the paper, after all.
“That’s okay,” Lopt sounded soothing as he spread the branches, so they’d dry more quickly. The real Yaël looked up to check on the Lopt standing next to her. He looked at the scene very mindfully, like he was catching all the details and thought about them.
“I, uh, I don’t have a passport or anything,” Peter adds, uncertainly. Tony just snorts then, finally facing him with the dark brown eyes Peter has come to known as his own.
But the moment he turns on the screen, Steve makes a complaining sound.
“Eugene, how about that? I didn’t know you’d go here?” Peter tries. He doesn’t want to make too much of a big deal about Flash. The past schoolyear had been kind of chill, what with Flash having gotten his warning from the school about his bullying behavior, close to being expelled. Now, though, there’s a clean slate, no strikes. If he wishes so, he could flush Peter’s face in the toilet and probably nobody would look up. There’s just too many students here.
He doesn’t know who said it. They’re probably right
“But you love being an Avenger?” Peter asks, sitting up at last to give Tony a long look. The man simply sighs and shakes his head.
“So, eh, now we know what happens if we trigger that girl a bit too much. I’ll call her The Bomb, because of multiple reasons! Now, who’s next!” The noise of enthusiasm was still following her. Was Loki cheering too now?
Peter can’t believe this. “So, what, you’re breaking up with Tony is that it?”
A little to his left, there’s a tall man with a beard and a cap is looking out through the window. He’s wearing glasses and a hoodie, hands tucked away in his pockets. Next to him, there’s a blonde woman with a face he doesn’t recognize. She’s got a hand on his back, not in a romantic gesture but in some sort of assuring way.
“We WHAT?!” Sam and Clint copy.
Someone gave her a hand as she tried to climb out of the window. People were gathering, taking pictures.
“What?!” the two Yaëls spat simultaneously.
Peter shrugs again. “I’m renting a place not too far from here. It’s actually just a two minute walk, right next to this nice little coffee shop-“
“Dad’s on the phone, been for about thirty minutes or so. I’m not sure what it was about, though,” Peter says with a shrug, pointing to the balcony where, through the window, the two can see Tony walk around, moving his hands in the air as he’s talking about something.
FRIDAY explains. Peter groans and smacks his head on the workbench, making sure to avoid hitting the arc-reactor.
Okay, so the guy might be interested in ways Peter isn’t, but he’s still an okay-dude. Maybe they
“I suppose I have a lot of catching up to do.”
Suddenly, the smile left Wade’s face as he looked dead serious at the kid. “There is a spider in my pizza.”
There’s more movement, but Tony’s mind seems to clear at least slightly when he’s lying down on the ground, Steve sitting on top of him. At first, he’s confused as to how he got here in this position. Barnes lying down on the ground, metal arm missing… it explains a bit.
know him unless they’ve been living under a rock for years.
“Oh mighty clothes, I will never, ever take you for granted again, this I promise,” Peter mutters to his clothing once he takes a couple of pieces into his hands. Taking out a white shirt and a dark grey coat to put above it, he drops them on his bed before grabbing a pair of dark jeans. He figures that, for the demonstration, he shouldn’t just come appearing there in his usual hoodie, after all.
He receives the file the day he arrives at the tower after his trip in India. There’s no sender, nothing to tell him who it comes from. Not that he needs it; the first page is explanation enough.
So Peter runs after MJ, still standing there in his underwear. When he reaches out for her, she suddenly turns back to him, holding up her finger in a warning.
Yaël lost it, she blacked out.
“What is that?!” Yaël grunted at the woman, who only grinned, right before she pushed some kind of button which clearly send electric waves at Yaël as she out of the blue got electrocuted. She fell down on the ground, her body shocked and the pain was so unbearable that Yaël was unable to even yell or scream.
Even Tony is surprised about the way he addresses him. Fury doesn’t seem so phased, instead sighing.
“You know, I only saw him once before, and I was just starstruck the entire time. I used to be such a big fan- I mean, I still am, but… yeah, things are different now I suppose.”
“You have no idea what it feels like, Steve,” Tony hisses towards him. His hands are shaking, his mind providing him with images he wishes would just disappear. He squeezes his eyes shut, trying to remember where his bottle of pills is. He should have taken one hours ago, but he was so busy with his project that he completely forgot about it.
Natasha and Clint exit the elevator, motioning for Peter to follow, which he does. Passing the rooms, he can see through the open doors that they’re helping out some of the victims of the battle. In one particular room, a doctor is stitching up Sam’s arm.
And with that, the other figure disappears again, and Peter finds himself seeing six fingers dancing in front of him.
Steve is much like Rhodey, but there’s something different about it. He’s much more tactile, Peter notices early on. There’s always a hand on the shoulder, on the back. Sometimes Steve even pulls him into an embrace and starts stroking through Mr. Stark’s hair. It’s weird to see it like that.
“Call me if you need anything, I’ll be at the workshop!” After that, Tony leaves the room right when Bruce appears again. When the scientist takes Tony by the arm and murmurs something to him, Peter wonders what it’s about. He sees Tony shake his head, and Bruce then sigh before shaking his head as well. Something more is said, but after that Tony leaves.
Peter swallows, but then nods.
- violence
Peter pulls away from the basin, clearing his throat and shaking his head.
“You can explain?!” Mary snaps, pulling up her phone and pointing it at Tony, where he can see a picture of himself above an article. The title says: ‘TONY STARK CONFESSES TO DATING CAPTAIN AMERICA’. “How can you explain this?! Now the whole world will butt their noses into our marriage even more! How can we keep on pretending to be a happy couple with this, Tony?”
Peter moves, he throws his entire soul in it, it seems. Tony is already leaning back in his seat, against Steve who has his mouth dropped open just as widely as Tony’s. LL and Chrissy, too, make surprised noises as Peter seems to feel no shame in making some slightly obscene movements.
As Scott finally left the room, she started thinking. She should be able to make these kind of creatures with air and earth too. Well, Yaël knew she wasn’t able to, yet, but she should be as those two elements were a part of her powers too.
It aches not to be by his side, but Tony knows he can get more work done here. If he stays next to Peter all the time, he’ll only be able to think about him, not giving the research any attention. Besides, Steve and May are still with him. He’s far from alone.
“No, you know what, never mind, it was a stupid thing to say.” But he knows it’s too late. Tony already put two and two together when he tries to find what Steve had been looking at before. Once he sees Raido on Wanda’s lap, his mouth falls open in understanding.
“I want you to put it on,” Mr. Stark says. “And then I want your input.”
“It’s alright.”
“Can I get a lift down? I don’t really want to waste an arrow right now,” he says, trying to lighten up the conversation again. Peter crosses his arms and raises an eyebrow, even though Hawkeye can’t really see that.
“Anthony, Steven, do the two of you need help with putting on the robes that you were given?” Thor asks, storming inside the room. His hair is messy, his clothes loose. Steve sees that he hasn’t taken the time to put his prosthetic in beforehand, so he has one eye closed as he stands there with his hands on his hips.
Peter doesn’t comment on it. He watches Johnny on the ground, rolling on his back while he lets the full force of the impact of what happened earlier wash over him. He shifts his head a bit, giving Peter a wide smile.
- The Avengers care about Tony
“I- uh, it’s Peter,” he then says. Doesn’t need to keep Steve in this tension. There’s a short silence, and then some shuffling sounds.
Then the invisible glass is lifted up to the mask shortly before it's put away again. “
pretty weird to watch a holographic illusion of his grandparents, seeing them saying goodbye to a barely older version of his own father. It all looks so unnaturally real that it almost freaks Peter out. He has no idea when Tony has even found the time to work on this in between the suit and all the drama.
Johnny snorts but jumps up from the table. “He thinks I’m pretty,” he jokes. Then he nods towards Peter. “We should hang out once or twice.”
“I’m being a good friend,” Steve returned, unimpressed by Tony’s words. Once the elevator stopped at Tony’s floor, Steve pushed the chair forward again. Tony threw his head back, looking up at Steve from underneath him.
With each bird that Peter sees flying in the air, his mind immediately warns him that the Goblin has returned. As it turns out, having a cold means that his senses are all messed up, feeling danger whenever there isn’t any. Another cold chill passes him by, but nothing happens.
“FRIDAY, can you call Peter for me one last time?” Tony asks.
In the beginning of her disease, Peggy’s husband, Daniel, took care of her. Despite being old himself, he made sure she washed herself, she ate her dinner, and she would pick up the phone. But after his death, somebody else had to start taking care of her. When Tony then heard that neither of her children were able to take her in, he decided to make sure she would be as comfortable as possible.
“When have I ever been an ass?” Tony asks, sounding convincing. He could almost have fooled Peter.
“Dude, what’s your problem?” Flash asks, holding up his hands in surrender. It doesn’t seem to stop Eddie.
“No, I’m not a hero at all and of all people, you should know that,” Yaël tried to point at him, but her whole hand was packed. Loki shrugged, moving forward to sit on the chair next to the bed she had been lying in.
Eventually, MJ pulls Peter along to the dance floor. Surprised that she would actually suggest this, Peter can’t find it in himself to refuse. She holds on to his hand, goes to stand at the side of the crowd and pulls Peter’s arms up to her hips.
important not to have by their side. Instead of wanting to prosecute the remaining members of the group, they want a chance to come to an understanding, an agreement on the accords. So they want to arrange a meeting with everybody.
First thing that came up was Peter, dancing in ridiculous clothes to Rihanna’s Umbrella. Yaël remembered bits and pieces of that moment, but it was surely hilarious as hell to watch it again. Peter’s faced turned red, of course it did. And because of that Yaël couldn’t ignore the chance to make a sarcastic note about his appearances on the tape.
“Hey Spider-Man,” suddenly comes out from a rooftop he only just passed. It’s only because of his enhanced hearing that he even heard it in the first place. Peter stops in his tracks, swinging himself back to the source of the voice.
“Eh,” Peter says, looking down at his hands in his lap. “She and my father died, about ten years ago. Plane-crash.”
“Sorry, man, I don’t know who that is.” Although it had been his unintended plan to shock her, she had the feeling she shocked him more for some reason. Yaël saw Peter’s eyes grow big and his mouth fall open a bit.
“Wow, Tony, I didn’t know you knew this song so well?” Steve wonders. Tony snorts.
Right, Peter forgot that the floors underneath them are now inhabited and are also part of the private elevator.
It’s about ten minutes later that she speaks up again. They’re almost nearing Oscorp and Tony has to admit that, though he hates it very much, the tower does end up looking better than it does now.
But what’s he crying for? Is it the reminder that the thing that happened last night has only ever been done with Gwen before? The reminder that he’s a crappy friend, who can’t even put aside his own problems to make it up to the girl currently comforting him? Is it the fact that Harry is still stuck in the compound, not even closer on getting better from whatever has happened to him?
“JARVIS, where’s my lab currently located?” Tony then asks the moment the doors are closed.
“Are you even there as Peter?”
“Alt bra? Wow, detteermoro!” Wade answered her ‘How are you? Wow, this is fun!’ in fluent Norwegian. How did he even…?
“You should go,” he says. May looks like she’s about to respond to that for a moment, but then she nods. As Peter’s bed is taken out of the room, she passes Tony, kissing him slightly on the cheek before joining Peter. She takes her nephew’s hand into her own and follows them to their destination.
“Do you know I was the only one who believed in you? I’m your Dad, of course I’m supposed to believe you. But everyone else said I was crazy to recruit a kid.”
“There’s just not a simple ‘solution’, Tony. It’s just something I must figure out on my own. And I know you want to help, and I admire you for that, but you
“You’re living in the twenty-first century, Steve. It doesn’t matter anymore who you’re in love with, as long as that person is a legal adult. Let the past go. I know you grew up going to church and that you still do a small prayer in your head every time you start eating dinner. I know that you had to ramble your prayers before you could sit down at school and I know you still have a cross hanging somewhere hidden in your room. But don’t you think you’ve got the whole message wrong?” Yaël rattled.
But there was something else Yaël wanted answers to. “Though I feel like we still need to talk about what happened afterwards…”
“That’s good, then,” Peter says. He forces up a smile, and Harry believes it. Good, because this is supposed to be a happy moment.
“I’ll get my revenge, though,” Tony mutters out before pulling off the suit. He’s not going to keep it; it’s rather uncomfortable, and Tony’s sure he can make something much better at home. It could be funny to be Cap for Halloween. He might try and convince Steve to try out one of his suits.
“Alright, if you won’t talk, would you please just listen?”
“Alright alright,” Tony agrees, sitting up with his hands up in defeat. “You’re right, I’m beating around the bush again. I know we need to talk, I just… it’s probably not going to be pleasant.”
So Yaël told her about her recently gained memories and asked him about the planet she came from. His answer was clear.
Mr. Parker’s homework?” Mrs. Cooper asks, still not seeming to believe it. The guy – who is he, even? – groans, seemingly losing his patience here.
“You alright?” he asks as Peter, Shuri and Mantis hurry up and walk in front of them, deep in discussion about something Shuri’s showing on her phone.
“You had something-“ she starts, nodding towards Peter who quickly wipes at his chin to dry off.
With love
As for the setting of the story: it's after the Infinity War. There will be many references to the timestamp about the battle (A parent's loss). Peter's ready to become an Avenger. He's moved out, renting an apartment with his friend Johnny. Harry is doing a trip around Europe, Ned is at MIT while MJ is going the artistic way.
Their family never even thought of mentioning him, which could mean one thing; she told them she didn’t want him in her life anymore, and they followed her last wishes.
Peter gets a report from the scientists at the Compound the day after seeing Harry again. He’s at the tower, tweaking his own bot that he’s forgotten all about while Dum-E is there making sure that he stays hydrated. Tony is somewhere in here as well, but he stepped out a little bit ago to make a phone call and Peter isn’t sure when he gets back.
“Yaël, I’m pretty sure that you’re talking about a father-daughter dance, so maybe we have to wait for that when you get married, right? Since you’re not my dad and I’m not your daughter either.” Yaël looked up, still holding him, ready to dance.
The room looks beautiful. Tony doesn’t know much about culture and religion in India, but he can recognize the small statues of the gods. There’s Ganesh, Shiva…  The others, he doesn’t know by name. The table is made of a beautiful wood, and it’s covered by a sheet with tiny, detailed motives. The people here might not be the richest of the world, but Tony can’t help but admire the room they’ve made for themselves here.
she asks the way she’s asked about the others as well. And while he told her that, yes, she could let them in, no he shakes his head.
“So everything is fine in the family?” Dr. Thatch asks. Peter then shrugs.
“Eh, it doesn’t matter. You’ll figure it out eventually,” he admits. Then he gives Peter a light smile, making clear that he’s not exactly
Peter’s turned around by a confused Dr. Strange. The man next to him holds up his glowing hands as if he’s ready to defend himself.
Yaël grinned as she closed her door behind her and locked it.
Chapter warnings:
Tony sighs. He can’t stand this, can’t stand the idea that his boy is sick like this. It seems like May has equal difficulty dealing with it, the way her eyes stay stuck on Peter’s form.
Which they’ve clearly done. Passing the book along to Tony, the engineer opens it up to cast a quick look inside of it.
So he brings up pictures. Images from New York when Victor went after them. From the London Eye, Shanghai when they teamed up with the Silver Surfer to chase away Galactus. Other battles with Doom, and so on and on. All the destruction they’ve left in their wake; the things they’ve helped rebuilt afterwards.
Peter shrugs it off.
So, it is agreed that Steve joins them on their movie-night. Once they’re at the tower, the decision is quickly made to watch
A fight?! Tony shoots up from where he’s seated, already marching out of the wagon in record time. It helps to have a little more space if he wants to have a conversation like this.
Excitement is not an emotion Peter would have expected to feel today, but as it is, he can’t help but express it. His lips curl up in a wide smile, his heart beats faster, and his hands suddenly grab on to the bed next to him as he jumps up in his seat.
“I’m glad you’re here,” Tony admits. Steve just nods, but doesn’t speak. Together, the two men look down at the sleeping figure of Peter. It’s crazy to think that just a few hours ago he had been lying on the operation table, cut open by Dr. Cho and her nurses as they tried to get the thing piercing Peter’s body out of there.
But then he opens his eyes widely, thinking back of a small fact.
“Hey, uh, Ned. Any chance you brought your laptop along?” Peter asks, trying to sound casual about it. Ned frowns.
“I would be happy to see my friend, so if you would just… bring him back.”
Slowly, he gets out of bed. The first thing he does is shrug out of his clothes, dropping the black suit on the floor. Then, just in his underwear, he lies back down on the bed, a hand under his head and the other one on his belly.
“You’re getting married? Isn’t that a bit soon?” Sam asks, suddenly appearing as well. He doesn’t seem as put off as Clint when it comes to a half-naked Steve Rogers.
“Yes, what?” Peter urges on. Tony closes his eyes and sighs.
But he knows that they’ll fight again. He knows that he’ll be weak, and he’ll cry, and he’ll then forgive him and they’ll pretend that nothing happened. But that’s not true; too much happened, and Tony can’t ignore that.
They all came a bit closer, so Yaël could finally hear what they were saying.
“Bloody hell,” she grunted as she picked up one of the weapons from the corpses covering the bridge “I can’t retract any warmth from those nose-less imbeciles!” Yaël quickly slid through one of the zombies, who was aiming on an already very busy Loki. She quickly stomped her foot on the ground and created a big boulder from the rocks beneath her. With the movement she made with her arm while stabbing another living dead, she simultaneously made the bolder fly intoVöluspá’s (or Hela’s, apparently) army and crush some zombies.
Peter runs back off the balcony. He needs to check out the compound, then. Maybe there he can find out what’s going on, if the building’s still there at least. Last Peter can remember, SHIELD is still there trying to figure out what this meteor is about.
“Uh, I actually- I did make it, but it seems like I forgot it at work,” Peter starts to explain as he drops his bag on the ground again. “You see, I put it on my desk, but Mr. Stark’s robot set it aside and I forgot about it-“
“How are you? I’ve been worried as hell! You can’t just disappear like that!” she ranted against him.
“No I haven’t?” he tries, but he knows it’s futile. Everybody and their mother would know that he’s been crying. The red eyes probably give it all away.
Bruce fidgets the little stone out of his eye and tries to stand up. He shoots one short look at Peter (as Spider-Man) and then he takes a deep breath.
“Good.”
“I’ll always be honest to you,” he promises before grabbing Steve’s hand and kissing his knuckles as well. “Same to you.”
“It’s alright if you’re not sure right away! It’s a whole lot of information and I’m sure your head is going in overdrive.”
she warns him. Tony jumps up, not too surprised when Steve does the same.
She was way too happy to have Steve back, so she decided to tell him about Peter, to change the subject.
FRIDAY adds, and Francis laughs before shaking his head while looking down.
“Well, everyone could steer one element, no one actually could do what you do: steering all four of them. Your dad steered water and your sister fire. Your mother had heterochromia, so she was one of the few people who could steer a bit of fire and a bit of air.” What was this town, or land or whatever? There was no place on earth like this one, right? Where there countries filled with people with powers to steer the elements?
Tony looks down at the bandages. They’re not bloody, so there’s at least that. He hesitates on taking them off, but then it would mean he’d have to put them back up as well. He decides not to do that, instead leaving it be as it is.
“What black goo?” he asks. Peter turns back to see inside the crater, finding that it’s indeed missing. Where it had been lying before, now lies only debris and destroyed floor. That’s… weird?
“I did. He was most grateful for the warning and is trying to look through his security footage. I also made him aware of the role Spider-Man had in this.”
“That Goddamn Goblin came back!” Mr. Stark grumbles. “That’s the second time he grabbed him already!”
May shouts in Peter’s ear. “
There’s a couple locks of hair in them. Horror shows up on the boy’s face, and Tony just wants to go to him, but he should respect Peter’s wishes. He needed a few minutes alone, so that’s what he’ll get.
“I’m afraid that’s not how this works, dear,” Charles said. When Yaël looked up at him, she saw his eyes being wet from the compassion he felt for her.
“Mr. Stark, are you with us?” another, unfamiliar voice asks. Tony lifts his head up to the source of the sound, but doesn’t speak. He can’t, his voice doesn’t want to help. Instead he nods. Yes, he’s with them. Though he doesn’t know where exactly it is. It couldn’t be this darkness. “You’ve been in surgery, sir. You returned to your room this morning, and you’ve been asleep ever since. Can you open your eyes for us?”
- none really
“I appreciate that, Tony,” Steve says, sounding grateful indeed. Then there’s a light scrape of the chairs as the two men probably stand up. “How’s Peter been doing, by the way?”
in my world, but I am content. I am in love, and I am loved by somebody in return. And, yeah, I have my mental illnesses and my panic attacks, and I might chase the other you off sometimes in my bad moments, but… in the end, Steve always comes back to me, and I always come back to him.”
“Uh, fifty bucks?” Barnes admits. Tony snorts, with his arms crossed, flipping the comment off.
His joyful, blue eyes scanned her. Suddenly, Raido stopped moving, like he was frozen.
“Wait for it…” Yaël said with a wink as she kept knocking and then yelled: “MS. THOMAS? YOU FELL ASLEEP BETWEEN THE DOORS AGAIN!”
after he’d died.
Tony turns to Peter, to see what he’s thinking about it. But, in the time he’s been unconscious, Peter surely has already gotten used to the idea. He’s probably not as surprised about it. Still, Tony can catch a glimpse of sadness in his eyes as he desperately avoids looking at the cuffs.
The last message is her telling him that she heard from Johnny that he’s fine, and to figure out his shit. Peter swallows through a lump in his throat. The cab they’ve taken stops in front of their destination by the time he’s finished reading through everything.
“MJ, I’m the girlfriend,” she says quietly so the journalists wouldn’t hear, nodding towards Peter. Shuri’s face falls for just a short second before the biggest grin in the world appears on it. Then, MJ, too, is pulled into a strong hug. In the corner of his eyes, Peter can see the King slapping his forehead through his laughter.
“I hear from MJ who heard from Felicia, who heard from Johnny who I think heard from May that you weren’t doing so hot, so I figured I’d come back and help bring my best friend back on his feet,” Harry says, shrugging like it’s not that big a deal. Then he looks down at Peter’s entire form. “You were heading out?”
“Hah, gotcha!” Yaël grinned widely. Jason looked confusedly at his feet, but he didn’t seem panicked at all. She put her hands behind her back as she stepped in front of him confidently. She won. That was when she noticed everybody else who had been walking in the park, was quietly staring at her with big eyes.
“So, uh any fun activities we can do?” he asks with a smile.
He notices Fury almost immediately. After a while, it’s become some sort of hidden talent of his; to know whenever the guy is suddenly going to appear.
, somehow. Then, when the sirens ring, Peter decides to track the police cars, which brings him in Brooklyn all of the sudden.
“Yeah, uh, yeah! I’m coming!” he shouts, though his voice is shaky. Once he notices where his hand is, he snatches it back up, almost as if it’s just been burned. His face is warm. His eyes looking at his hand as if it personally betrayed him. He’s angry with himself, for giving in so easily on something he can’t describe. He’s never felt
With lots of effort, he manages to pull his mask away from his face. Breathing still hurts, but it’s better than suffocating inside that metal cage. He needs to get out of the full suit. But that would mean he’d have to reach for the emergency lever, and he doesn’t think he can do that right now.
“You need help or anything?”
me, but it’s not like I’ll run in to him, right? Besides, if he’s so butthurt about it, he can just kiss my-“
There’s a quiet moment of awkwardness going on there. Mr. Stark isn’t saying anything, Steve keeps his mouth shut, and Peter is just too surprised to speak. It goes on for about a few minutes before Mr. Stark finally speaks up again.
“Who’s this kid again?” Tony asks Gwen.
“Uh, I’m alright?” Tony asks, but Peter isn’t convinced.
But… wait. No, Peter can’t call through his suit yet. That feature hasn’t been activated yet?
“Right, then why didn’t I get a warning about this if he needs all of us?” Tony asks. Steve shrugs.
“Why not?” Peter lifted an eyebrow.
Tony and Steve lose a bet, and they have to pay for it. Only, not with money...
Also, I'm putting up the first timestamp today! Go check it out if you're interested! It'll be a point of view of Steve to Tony going to the hospital!
“Oh, come on,” he mutters bitterly. Hearing the police sirens, Peter decides it’s best to just get away. Handing the cat back to Mr. Delmar – he’s going to have to ask Tony about donating some money to the guy to build his shop back up – Peter hurries away. It’s probably time to head back home, after all. He hurries back to the alleyway to pick up his backpack, only to find that it’s no longer there.
Of course, Ned is an awesome guy. He’s a good friend, he’s smart, and he loves Star Wars just as much as Peter does. But he also runs his mouth more often than not, and there have been a few times where Peter had to kick him in the legs for almost revealing to the entire school that he’s Tony Stark’s son.
“We never said anything about sex,” he whispers heatedly. Tony chuckles but then shakes his head. With all the willpower he has, he gently pushes Steve away from him and turns to his side to look at the other man.
Instead, Peter just thinks she’s adorable like that.
“He’s my friend,” he whispers out, his voice not really up to be louder than that.
“Okay, bye Steve.”
“Anthony? Is that you?” she asks. Tony smiles and then nods at her. Peggy reaches up a hand and passes it over his cheek. “Look how handsome you are.”
Tony opens up his mouth to say something in return, but right after he’s taken his breath, FRIDAY’s voice interrupts him.
“How did you-?” Peter starts, but he doesn’t finish his sentence.
“Now here we are, at your room! Still the same one as back then, but I made some changes so you’d feel at home.” The first thing Yaël saw when she opened the door, was Wade, laying naked on a brand-new-looking sofa, only covering his parts with a box of chocolates. Steve looked completely shocked.
- mentions of past alcohol abuse
Ah, Peter smiles. He already did his story to May, but he doesn’t mind repeating it to Tony at all.
Tony doesn’t care if he’s impolite. He needs an out, just for right now. He needs a moment to himself with no other human around him.
Tony has to agree with her. What with Natasha and Barnes adopting that Altman-kid whose mother died in some sort of battle, Rhodey officially having moved in with May somewhere further in New York, and Wilson also expecting his first kid soon enough, things seem to be getting more interesting.
“Yeah.”
True, whenever things are boring or just plainly have nothing to do with him, he tends not to listen. But more often than not, he’s giving it all his attention despite not looking like he’s doing it. Especially when people are talking about things they’re passionate about; things they’ve been wanting to do, but haven’t found any chance to do it.
During the days, things are going fine. During the night a bit less. Tony is haunted by nightmares, memories he thought he’d suppressed but are actually following him now. Afghanistan, New York, Pepper falling to her death… Sometimes he’s greeted with images of a life he used to dream to have with Mary. Sometimes it’s Pepper, and there’s a kid involved.
The Avengers prepared them for the possible cold weather that is to be expected in Norway. While it keeps on staying rather warm in New York – though it cooled down well enough since fall started – it’s nothing compared to the temperatures in New Asgard. The snowfall even takes Peter by surprise.
Tony startles, looking up from the microscope and finding Id-Jit already standing at the door where Steve is currently trying to get away from him. Steve, who is right now wearing his Captain America uniform.
Tony smirks. “Steve agrees with you there. I was more a fan of the third dress, but whatever. It’s not like anybody will be wearing one for me.” He winks at Peter, ruffles through his hair again and starts making his way to the buffet. Then Yael, Wade
“The real one?” Mary sounds impressed. “I thought he died?”
“Is this about… is this about what happened Saturday?” Peter asks, stopping at the red light and waiting for it to turn green again.
Steve asks. Peter nods and gets off his chair, resting his hands back in the pockets of his hoodie as he starts walking towards the door. He knows he’s looking like he’s up to no good if he’s walking around like this, but people know him by now.
Peter nods, holding his thumb up as well. He’s fine.
“Ah, you know, brainwashed Russian assassins with metal arms,” he shrugs, like it’s not that big of a deal. There’s so much more Peter wants to ask; Is Steve okay? Are
“I don’t know,” Peter mutters. “Put up Star Trek or something. The one with the actor that looks like Strange.”
Don't be afraid to let me know what you think. Is there something that there should be more of? Things that are a bit boring and dragged out too long? I take any feedback I get!
(See the end of the chapter for
“Eh, for all we know he could be terrible with children,” he says with a shrug. Now that’s something Tony can’t really imagine.
After the call ends, Peter collects his stuff again, making sure to leave no trace behind. He leaves the building through the balcony once more, feeling like screaming it out of excitement once he start swinging his way back towards his new home.
“Jus takin it inma own hands,” Johnny slurs out, right before pulling Peter’s face closer.
“Natasha, it’s good to see you,” the woman closest to them says. Where Peter would have imagined a welcome-hug, nobody really seems to move to initiate it. Even weirder, it feels completely normal not to hug each other as a greeting.
“Hey, eh, Mrs. Maximoff!” Peter says while scratching the back of his head. There’s a chuckle escaping from his throat, and if she could see his face, she’s see a whole lot of red. Err, not that she doesn’t already do, that is. “I thought you’d be with the others fighting the Goblin?”
“Maybe…” she mumbled as she looked down. Okay, so she was only wearing a T-shirt and panties. Normally she’d walk around like that, but with Steve being a prude, she decided to look for some real clothes.
Peter shook his head. “N-no, but instead of being grateful that Tony rescued me, I told him that he might be my father, but he wasn’t my dad…”
By the time he opens them again, he’s back in the bathroom in the middle of shaving while Steve is in the shower.
“I think you guys have a lot in common, don’t you? It seems so obvious you two are father and son when I hear you talking about him.” Peter shrugged, but Yaël saw the happy smile on the kid’s face. He was doing just fine.
“Oh, crap! I knew I shouldn’t have partied with Wade last night…How long have you been here by the way?” she said as she turned to Steve. His random appearance that morning was still confusing her.
“You’re the best, this wasn’t necessary at all. I don’t even know how I can thank you for thi-“ Someone interrupted her by scraping his throat. Both of them looked up and saw Stark, standing in the doorway. His face was emotionless. Steve immediately pulled himself from Yaël’s arms.
“Johnny!” Peter suddenly shouts. Behind him, the door to Johnny’s room opens.
Finally all the dead-living things were dead again, like they were supposed to be. Thor, the armed woman, Loki and Yaël (and her team of water-people) gathered after they defeated every last one of Hela’s army.
“He’s… my father. The reason why my mother didn’t want to speak with him anymore is because she accidentally cheated on dad with him,” Peter admits.
Chapter warnings:
Now, after having replaced his wet clothes and taking a warm shower, Peter wonders what he could do with what remains of his day. He hasn't seen his Dad or Steve around so far, but he knows Bruce is somewhere in his own lab.
“Sure,” Yaël sat down next to him and chose one from the box that now wasn’t covering a thing anymore. “Now, please stop annoying Steve and put on some pants, Wade,” she said after letting Steve suffer for a moment.
Peter’s aware that his phone is ringing in his pocket. He ignores it, ignores the beer being spilled over his clothes. Ignores the girl that slaps his but and winks at him when he faces her. When one girl comes up to him and almost starts kissing him, he takes a step back and holds up his hands. Without any explanation, he turns around. He doesn’t need to explain himself here. People shouldn’t just start kissing people because they want to.
Peter, who looked like he had just survived a natural disaster, was staring at the building they crashed in front of. “Stark Industries…” Yaël read the big letters above the automatic doors. He looked a bit confused.
,” Steve answers, half jokingly. “
Peter closes his eyes, suddenly remembering something.
“Uh, I think he’s in the professor’s office,” one of them says, pointing to the building they’re standing in front of. Tony nods before removing the suit. Pulling out his sunglasses, he walks through the courtyard, greeting every teenager and kid that seems excited to see him.
“Guys,” Peter interrupts them. “I know I scared the shit out of you.”
“I don’t like fighting,” Steve admits. Tony smiles lightly.
This is way too much information at once. Peter seriously needs a time-out. He should go patrolling after this, maybe. He lets out another long breath, in all honesty just wanting another drink. How did it even come to the point where he needs to drink to relax a bit?
“You just don’t get it, do you?” Tony keeps on rubbing his hand. Only that way, he’ll stay away from his chest. “I thought you were responsible; that’s why I let you keep the suit. But you let it go over your head, you ignored me. You need to understand that things can’t work the way they used to. Things need to be run over with the big people.”
“The problem is that MJ, as well as
“I, uh- he got them from me in case of an emergency,” Tony admits. “Clearly, I was wrong to give them to him.”
“Right… the Quinjet is ready for departure. We need to go now before we lose him again.” Natasha then nods towards the hallway. Steve nods before getting the suit off the panel. Then he follows Widow out of the workshop. Before the door closes behind him, he gives Tony one last look, which Tony returns.
Tony turns around, pulling his hand free and taking a step back.
“Correct me if I’m wrong, but Peter will get bit by one of Richard’s spiders, which should actually kill him since he’s not of the same blood as him?” she tries. Tony hums in agreement and Mary throws her head back in defeat.
Tony shudders, and so does Steve. The pair quickly give each other a look. Are they going to give in that easily? Are they surrendering just like that, without fighting for their dignity? Sure, it’s their own fault for going for a risky place to do their shit, but… Fuck this shit…
“Rumlow has returned,” Steve says shortly. Tony frowns but then shrugs.
disturbing smile filling his head.
“This got seriously out of hand,” she tells him sadly.
The nurse gives him a sympathetic look and then reaches out for his shoulder. “The doctors will be here shortly. You can tell them what you just told me, alright?”
“H-h-harry…” Peter whispers out, realizing his vision start to turn a bit black. Damn it, he should have known that this wasn’t a good idea. His instincts
“Exactly,” Yaël nodded. “I figured that I’d better tackle my problems than just sit, think and whine about them.” Well, actually, Wanda told her to meet up with Peter instead of being grumpy about it, and that pushed Yaël to make some kind of life motto out of it.
“These accords suck, is what they do,” Yaël mutters out bitterly.
“It was Nilla, she opened the gas in my apartment. If you hadn’t set it on fire, she would’ve.” Yaël gritted her teeth as every move Wade made, her body itched and stung.
“Nobody knows, actually,” Steve sounded doubtful. “You haven’t seen each other since the Chitauri attack. Thor took him back to Asgard.”
“Aren’t you a bit too young to-“ the man starts, but then he sighs and shakes his head. Eventually he pats the backseat and waits for Peter to sit himself down, which he does. After that, they start driving again, this time with Peter making ‘whooosh’ noises in the back.
“He did?” Storm asks with genuine surprise in his voice. That moment, Tony takes his place next to Peter, quickly coming to realize that he’s being looked at. “Tony, my man, I’m insulted!”
“I’m fine,” he assures her. He’s not fine, and she knows it. But, right now, fine is probably accurate enough in comparison to how he has been feeling the entire past week. It’s not as if half a day with Mantis will cure him immediately.
And now Tony fell asleep, probably did so before Steve even finished. And this hasn’t been the first time, either. Steve shakes his head, leaning forward to kiss Tony on his forehead before pulling away from him, rolling onto his back to stare at the ceiling.
“You’re okay,” Tony mumbles out, trying more to convince himself. Because Peter’s okay, he can’t be gone. He’s still here, right? He’s right here in Tony’s arms, and surely he’ll start breathing again soon, won’t he?
Steve gives him a strange look, not giving anything away about what he thinks of it.
“Ah, my fellow spider,” Natasha says with a wide smile. She opens up her arms and Peter walks right in them. Feeling her strong embrace around him, he can’t really believe that the evening is turning out this way. He wouldn’t have expected them to be here, and now here they still are! It’s probably the best surprise they could have. “You look great.”
Bruce nods.
Peter pulls his hood over his head and groans. In frustration, he pulls his headphones off his desk and listens to some music. It calms him down at least a little bit, but not enough for his heart to slow down a bit. Angered by everything happening, Peter clears his throat and comes to stand in front of his window.
to be there as well. But no matter how many funerals he’s been to, it seems like nobody ever really gets used to it.
Steve only frowns a bit when he sees the box, but he doesn’t ask about it. Peter is glad for that as he puts his bottle of water away again, along with all the rest of his stuff.
And that’s how, eventually, it all began.
would
“We were in an Avengers meeting, Tony. You can’t just leave like that.”
. He needs to be gentle.
“Okay, Charles, because you’re the old guy in the wheelchair who saved my life and who helps me out with, like, everything! You’re the almighty professor X!” she teased him.
“Tony, I know you love the kid. He’s your son, for crying out loud,” Rhodey starts. “But I think that, right now, he’s only putting himself in danger.”
“Be quiet!” Strange warns him again, making a wavy movement with his hand and shutting Peter’s mouth for him. Even if he wants to talk, he can’t open his mouth anymore.
“I noticed, a fighter is a bit of a weak word to describe her.”
“You’ve got to be kidding me, right?” she complains. Then she walks up to him, putting her hands on his hips and squeezing them. “I want to get to know you. Let’s just hang out.”
Yeah, that just stays uncomfortable no matter how many times Peter’s going to hear it. He starts taking a few steps back, realizing that this is the part where they started working it out themselves. He nods towards Gwen as well.
Tony chuckles. “Well, we’re not going anywhere,” he assures him. He leans his head to the side until it’s resting on Steve’s shoulder, and then a loud sigh escapes his lips.
Tony says on the other line. Peter just groans the moment the call has ended. Then he pulls the mask off and turns back to Bruce. It’s probably better for him to see an actual face.
The web shooters aren’t there.
May isn’t too sure about it, on most occasion expressing her doubts about his idea. But he assures her that he knows what he’s doing. So after May, he explains it all to Tony.
Catching their breath, nobody says anything. Peter is already wearing his mask again, leaning forward with a hand on his stomach. Giving it a quick look, Tony notes that there’s nothing to be seen on the suit. But bruises can always hide underneath.
Little lights twinkled everywhere around her as Yaël saw her mom dance in circles on an open, grassy spot in the forest. The lights were insects, like fireflies, but the species on Helvegen shone out way more colors, like blue, soft pink and purple, which reflected beautifully in her one brown and one grey eye. Unlike the armor-ish stuff or pants she usually wore, her mom was wearing a long, flowy, white dress. Agostina was humming a song. She had told Yaël long ago that it was about the sun.
When he’s grabbed by Venom again, the mask disappears, showing a breathy, exhausted Eddie looking down at him.
“Oh, I have many stories to tell you, then,” he says with a smirk. And after that, he seems to forget about MJ for a little while and he starts talking.
“I can’t imagine I really brought you to that town, did I?”
Sure, there aren’t too many friends to contact in the first place; Wanda is still out on the mission (they’ve been gone for almost two weeks! It’s been driving Tony insane!), Wade is just too annoying to ask, Ned doesn’t even know about Peter’s friends, and- well, that’s about it.
This is going on long enough. He needs to contact Scott as soon as possible. However he’s going to go back in time, Scott and Hope surely can help him out with it.
“You must be Peter then,” she states. “Go on.”
“Okay,” she then says. Relief passes all over Tony, but he doesn’t let it show.
. Maybe Tony should just look for a new assistant, right? Would that make him an asshole?
Tony grins once again, because that meant that it worked. He did it. He heads to the compound first thing, landing at the frond door. Some people walking outside startle at his sudden appearance. Tony ignores him as he removes the suit and starts running inside.
“BECAUSE YOU STOLE GWEN FROM ME!”
“Ah, girl! You ruined the surprise!” Wade complains. Once she’s pulled away from Peter, Wade suddenly pulls him towards him and kisses him straight on the mouth. Peter squeezes his eyes shut in those few seconds that it lasts. “Aaah, that was my second gift.”
Rhodey’s not here this evening, headed to some sort of convention with the army or whatever. Peter didn’t really catch much of it, but apparently Rhodey’s getting another medal or something like that. It’s a pretty big deal, he supposes. He hopes he’ll get to see the medal once Rhodey’s back home.
Steve gives Tony a long, confused look.
Peter whistles. Where does this guy keep on getting his ideas? He feels the fabric, finding it soft and thick. Looking a bit closer, it reminds him a little bit of his suit.
Yaël dropped her pizza and made a movement with her hands. This way, she used air to make the plates fly over Peter instead of flying right in his face. The boy also seemed to have massive reflexes as he jumped back from the plates and before Yaël even noticed Wade pulled out a gun, Peter already had jumped up. Wade started shooting at the boy’s feet and out of reflex, Yaël stomped her feet. The tiles of her floor flew into the air. Using her powers, Yaël built a wall with the tiles. This way, she used it as a shield for her and Parker.
Tony looks up from his desk, security mask still safely above his face and welding machine in hand.
He’s been denying it. For so long, he’s tried never to think back of the reason as to why Pepper ended their relationship. Not only because it hurts too much that she left, but because he’s afraid she could be right. And he doesn’t want her to be right.
“Hi, I’m Shuri,” she introduces herself. MJ grins.
He can see them call out for him. He can’t hear it. Peter blinks a few times, pulling off his mask. Then he hands it towards Johnny, making a call-sign towards him. Johnny frowns and shakes his head in confusion. Peter rolls his eyes, standing back up and signing it again the best he can. He tests out his voice, not hearing it but feeling it anyway.
Peter chuckles despite his position, liking this girl’s snark quite a lot already. Especially if it gets Flash speechless, she’s his second favorite girl right now. Of course, it goes without saying who comes first to Peter.
"Steve, stop staring at Tony's ass for a second. We need to get ready for the mission," Sam suddenly says. Everybody turns to look at Steve, whose face is now beet red, eyes blinking nervously. Tony, too, jumps up, turning around with a shocked face. He gasps.
“NO!” the younger woman yelled as Yaël managed to pack in her arms. Of course, she started spitting fire after that. So Yaël had to build around her face too, leaving just a few holes to breathe, but not big enough to do much damage with her fire. That, and if she’d try to steer fire in there, she’d be baking herself.
“Pizza? It’s morning?” Yaël asked. What exactly did they saddle her up with here?
“There’s something I need to show you,” Lopt distracted her.
“JARVIS might as well have been my son. And you are JARVIS, kind off. Ergo, you are kind of my son, no?”
“I’m just thinking, honey,” Tony assures him, pulling Peter’s hand towards his lips to kiss his knuckles gently. Peter looks at him sadly, as if he knows exactly what’s going on in Tony’s head.
“It’s going to be a subtle gauntlet, easy to carry around. It’s to be worn as a bracelet,” he says, putting his hand through the sudden circle that appears on the hologram. Then he presses some sort of combination, and the bracelet opens up into a gauntlet. But not a complete one. The tips of his fingers aren’t covered at all, and it looks much slimmer.
Or maybe he does, but looking at the screen hurts his eyes for a bit.
“Okay, open your eyes,” X whispered. “I adjusted the language so I’m able to understand what’s happening here.”
“I have noticed.”
“Stark”, Wilson greets him. There’s no animosity between them, which is alright by Tony. After all, Wilson didn’t know about his parents. The only thing the two of them disagreed on were the accords, and that exactly is why Tony is here, now.
“That, and around three, the gardeners take a break.”
Yaël raised her eyebrow “So you’re not good or bad? You just do what’s gives you the most money?”
Peter has potential, and right now it’s growing so much. Tony just hopes he can teach him all he knows before he, like his mother, realizes that he shouldn’t waste his time on him.
. Mrs. Ferez looked over his homework, put it on Peter’s desk, and then Mr. Stark’s incredibly incompetent bot misplaced it. It took us literally an hour to find it underneath all of the mess that rusted bag of bolts has created. Mr. Stark often thinks of donating the thing to a school, you know.”
“My dad, he never really… give me a lot of support, and I’m trying to break the cycle of chains-“
Peter goes through his hair once again, finding more locks between his fingers. Defeated, he lowers his hands, closes his eyes, and he looks up.
“In October, I got diagnosed with PTSD and Major Depressive Disorder after my aunt sent me off to a few doctors. They started treating me immediately, giving me meds and sessions. I still failed my classes, but by January, things started to get a bit better.”
“I don’t know if I should drink, as the nurses won’t even give me some sort of sleeping pills.” Hilde rolled her eyes.
Flash wasn’t happy that he would rejoin them after all. But that’s mostly because Flash only got Peter’s place in one of the seats. He had been on reserve after all, since even Peter knows he’s the smartest on the team. He can understand why Gwen was with them, once.
“Just, when you get back… get rid of the suit as quickly as possible. Destroy it, imprison it, I don’t care. Just… don’t let it control you like it did me.”
“I can just recall the times when you came home to me and all you did was complain about this girl! Apparently, she had an internship at Stark Industries, back then?” May giggles. Tony nods.
to do with the business, but she’s damn good at it. With her reflexes, one would even say she’s been trained for it for years.
“If he’s anything like you, I don’t doubt that,” she returns. “Listen, Tony. Again, I didn’t mean to insinuate that you only care about Peter; it’s normal, you’re his dad after all.”
“Any good news?” Tony tries. Bruce chuckles slightly.
“What am I reading here?” he asks after that.
Miles rolls his eyes as he grabs the apron from the table. “I’m not
“Oh, you’re drained!” the memory-Yaël jumped up as soon as she noticed that. “Aren’t you cold?” she said as she walked towards him.
“How did that happen?” Peter asks, pointing towards the bruise. Tony touches his eye for a second before pulling away.
“Why?” he asks in confusion.
took pictures? Hell yeah, I want to see them.”
interested in relationships. After all, she’s always been telling Peter that all she wants to be is friends whenever he felt a bit unsure about hanging out.
Which clearly didn’t happen.
“Hold it right there, sir!” a familiar voice calls out. Peter feels immediate relief when he sees Steve run out of the quinjet, his shield at the ready. His skin looks a bit tanned, his hair slightly longer than the last time Peter saw him. And is Peter just imagining it, or is Steve letting his beard grow again? Tony might be happy to see that.
“Did he just-?” he starts, mumbling before shouting. “DID YOU JUST
“Will do, Stark,” Sam says with a wink before nodding towards the Quinjet. “C’mon, the bosses want us in Paris in record time.”
“What are you doing?!” the scientist asks, sounding angry all of the sudden. Peter, who is looking at the cables connected to the device, is too close to the thing for Tony’s taste. He’d rather have him far away from it.
Ned, who’s looking at him with wide eyes as if he’s just realized he’s Spider-Man. Oh, crap! Is his suit showing? Peter quickly looks down, but sees that it’s not the case.
The second day, he might start to get a bit more worried than before. Once again, the punching bags become the victims of that, but he also goes for a jog in the gardens. When he gets to the spot at three in the afternoon, he doesn’t really feel anything.
“I know, Tony,” Steve says, gently kissing him on the forehead. “I know how hard this is for you. But you can’t overwork yourself like this. Give Peter the chance to hang out with you for a little bit…”
“How about we take a holiday, huh? During Christmas break? After New Year?” Tony asks. Peter shakes his head.
“In those messages you’ve sent me, you could have at least
“Peter, stick to the important parts,” Tony interrupts.
So in anticipation of watching Into The Spider-Verse with my friends, I've started watching a playthrough of the ps4 Spider-Man game. It reminded me of this timestamp I started writing, but after another bingewatching-session of Stranger Things inspiration arose, and with that I thought back of this thing.
"What's in those?" Harry asks curiously. He's a bit excited that he's allowed to join, but given the fact that he's recently single again and doesn't have any other way to keep himself busy, it was obvious that they would invite him along. Besides, Peter kind of begged for it, and Tony can hardly say no to his son.
form of humanity in there.
The two don’t speak again after that. They listen to the radio where they hear another story about the explosion in Midland Circle. Tony hasn’t heard from Sharon on that part, so he doesn’t really know what happened out there other than the
“What do you mean, she’s gone?”
- Tony has more family than he realizes
Yaël had been training with Steve before, but it was clear he had been easy on her, because now, every morning when she tried to get out of her bed, she felt like she had been hit by a train. Luckily, she was still on her sleeping pills, so her muscular pains didn’t keep her awake.
It takes ten minutes before Tony returns, sans Steve. He looks hurried, running to grab his jacket and then supposedly following Steve out the compound. All the while, the three remaining men at the table stay suspiciously quiet.
“Tech from my year,” he says before nodding to the now accessible room. “C’mon, we shouldn’t waste time. He could come back any second.”
“Wait, why would you kill Iron Man?” another asks. The girl shrugs.
, just
Felicia kissed him once again before pulling away. “If you need me, you know how to reach me.” She winked at him before disappearing.
He can remember the first time he got to talk to Bruce Banner. It’s like every scientist’s dream to get a conversation with him, and goofy Peter Parker managed that – and not even as Spider-Man, no! It had been something with school, but it was mostly before he got well known about all this… Hulk-thing.
- Dialogue that I've taken from Spider-Man 2 (the Otto Octavius scenes especially)
Mr. Stark looks downright horrible; his hair is all over the place, even from where Peter his standing he can smell the alcohol. The dark circles under his eyes look even worse than before, and his cheeks are wet; probably from the tears that are rolling down.
“And you know,” Yaël poked her finger against his chest “I can defend myself against her just perfectly.” Charles doubted for a second. It seemed like he tried to make a decision depending on how much he believed she was able to fight back as he was staring at her.
“Who’s got the first shift of babysitting me?” Tony then asks, realizing that he’s got no other option other than to agree to it. Just after he’s finished his sentence, the door opens, revealing none other than Natasha.
“Anyway, since she came storming in without an appointment, security dragged her away before I could even give her an answer – which would have been ‘no’, of course,” Tony says. Peter snorts once more before shaking his head. He takes another bite from his apple, and then throws it into the bin with perfect precision.
a boyfriend.”
“What are you trying to tell me, Steve?” Tony asks, turning around to face Steve again. The other man gives him a light smile, kissing him quickly on the forehead before pulling back.
“Uh, guys? Room full of Winter Soldiers? About to be awakened?”
“Where’s your wheelchair?” Yaël asked flabbergasted.
be nice to work with.
“What I say is, you gave Mr. Parker detention after he supposedly ‘lied’ to you, but I am here to confirm that he
“Now you’re being a dick, I was just trying to help,” Johnny returns. He sounds insulted. Normally, Peter would have regretted his words and apologized. Now, somehow, he feels like he’s just having a bad day and being friendly is not really an option for him right now.
“Oh shit…” Peter mutters, realizing how horrible he’s been towards her…
“We haven’t really spoken since you came back, and I can understand that. You came back late and you probably didn’t want to wake me, and then you’ve been at school…” Okay, he’s rambling. Tony takes a breath. “Just, nice work at DC.”
“I know,” Steve returns, suddenly giving him a small grin. “At least that way I’m sure you’re not going to run off again.”
“So, a lot of stuff has happened,” Peter clarifies after a moment of just standing there. His heart makes a twitch when he imagines her smirking at him.
“I heard your parents were gross again?” she says sympathetic. She pats the couch then, giving it a pensive look. “I kind of like this couch. It’s soft.”
Because that’s not what they do, right? They’re just friends, going to hang out and work on some school stuff, seeing that she doesn’t understand the subject and he’s probably the best of the class. That’s the only reason why she asked for his help, after all.
“You okay, Tony?” Rhodey asks. Tony shifts his head a bit, crosses his arms again and steps towards the window.
Yes, Harry is back.
He should have known that he would chase Steve off one day. Things were too good to be true, after all.
Why does Otto
Steve tells him sadly. Peter sighs but nods. Of course, he should have guessed that. “
Whether or not Steve wants to come back home after that, that’s up to him.
“Thanks, sir. There’s no hurry.” At least she didn’t want him to think he’d have to hurry, he was too kind for her.
Peter looks up, seeing Francis standing there at the door. He’s a thirty-something year old man with darkened skin and dark brown curls, with deep brown eyes hidden behind two round glasses. He looks like the typical nerd combined with stylish superstar, mostly wearing suits and carrying around expensive watches and a wedding ring that looks the exact opposite of cheap.
“BECAUSE OF PETER, THAT’S WHY!”
Once he’s seated down on a random chair, he takes out his phone and finds that he has a message from is dad (a simple ‘Okay’). After checking his social media, he turns off the internet once more and starts taking out his notebook, starting to scribble down a bit on the paper. Right now, all he wants to do is take a look at the suit, find out what exactly happened to it and, if it’s a completely new suit, he needs to know what happened to the previous one.
Even when Flash is on his side, he still wants to be the best. Just to prove that, the guy went up and punched another guy a massive nosebleed when he was trying to get too frisky with Felicia. Sure, he got himself a warning from the school, but apparently his manhood has been rescued or whatever else is going on in Flash’ mind.
The day after she arrived at the compound, it was the first of May, her ‘birthday’. The birthday that Fury had pasted on her file just so people wouldn’t question her earthliness by her age. So Yaël bought herself a cupcake in the morning, one of those with much soft-pink-colored butter cream on top of it. When she finally got on the bus to go to the school, she opened the box and clapped her hands in joy before she took a huge bite of the cupcake.
that follows. The sound that indicates that he’s too late, he’s always been too late. And Peter gasps for breath, leaning forward as he puts his hand on his chest, remembering too well how her lifeless body felt in his hands as he cradled her close to him. As he wept, cried for the girl he loved, feeling her dying in his arms. One heartbeat, one more, and then nothing.
But Peter didn’t mind; he wasn’t feeling too well after all. Not because he got sick or anything, but because his body was slowly changing – the spider had bit him, altering his DNA. The morning after, he practically wrecked his bathroom. He had to control the powers.
“Is that a statue of that new kid that lost last fight?”
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve says before turning around again. “You keep looking out for us. We’re really grateful for that.”
“Peter! I know you’re near!” a voice sings out. It sounds vaguely familiar, but not like from somebody he’s talked to a lot. Carefully, Peter rolls back on his side, forcing himself back on his feet.
“DAAAAD! WE’LL BE LATE!” Peter shouts in the background. Tony drops his razor immediately. The door to the shower flies open, and Steve jumps out of it. He grabs a towel, while Tony doesn’t even bother to cover up. His underwear is enough. He just needs to see Peter, to hold him.
Tony grumbles, but he doesn’t pull back when Steve kisses him on the lips.
And after that, Ross takes out a thick book. Dropping it on the table, Ben is the first one who gets a look at it. With his large hands, he tries to go through it, but eventually he gives it up, shoving it towards Reed.
“Sometimes I like talking too, Yaël. Charles will do.” He threw back.
“C’mon, we’re losing time,” Yaël says, pulling Peter inside the car. “We need to get to Stark Industries.”
The moment Peter arrives back in New York, the first thing he does is fall right back into the couch. With Aunt May currently not working – meaning she’s at home – Peter decides to just crash at the Tower. It wouldn’t do him well if she would find him bruised and limping, asking questions on how he ended up in this state.
Yeah, great trip, Tony grumpily thinks to himself. Just one stupid week, that’s all he asked!
a voice says, seeming to come from the ceiling. Peter has heard of FRIDAY, so he’s not too worried about the sudden appearance of the voice.
there. There are no scientists, no cleaning crew. Even though the quinjet is still outside, there’s no Avenger to be seen. All his senses tell him that this is not okay, and that there’s something wrong, but on the other hand; this is the Avengers he’s talking about. Surely, nothing happened.
“When is he not?” Peter jokes.
After a little while, some sort of food got served. Of course it wasn’t fancy at all, it was the exact opposite, but everyone was happy to have a meal. Something brownish with accents of yellow and green got dropped onto Yaël’s plate. She couldn’t even place the smell of it.
“You had a panic attack, FRIDAY called me,” Steve explains calmly. He puts a hand behind Tony’s back and suddenly the man is sitting up again. When did he fall down on the ground?
“She really, really wants you to have it. It used to be her daughter’s.”
A week is not that long, Tony has to admit. Especially when there’s a whole lot of props that they need to arrange.
Tony closes the door behind Peter. He doesn’t need to be there in this little reunion, they deserve some time alone. His hand goes to his hair, and he starts to wonder if he should be staying here until he hears the plane leave again, or if he should attempt to walk back and risk seeing Steve again?
The first morning gives Tony the scare of his life. When he heads towards Peter’s room to get his son out of the crib, he only finds that Peter’s no longer in there.
That’s his father? Did he see it happen, too?
Oh, how he sounds like his dad, now…
Seeing that it’s almost seven, Peter reaches into the front of his bag and takes out his box with medications, checking them over before taking them in with the glass of water that has been resting on his desk. After that, he quickly cancels his reminder for today.
And that’s when it hits him; he didn’t put it in a folder. He left it on his desk. At Stark Industries. Dum-E must have put it away so Peter forgot about it.
Lopt pulled the rope backwards so Yaël bumped into him this time.
“Uh, I didn’t. I left it in my bedroom. I don’t carry it along as much since FRIDAY usually lets me in.”
“That’s because you’re all treating me like a kid!”
“Then what is it?” Peter wants to know what suddenly made them all change their minds. If it’s not the thing that happened earlier, then what made them afraid to let him join.
Natasha gives him a blunt look. "I am aware," she responds. Then she nods back to the window, and Steve nods. Quickly changing into dark clothes as well, the two leave the bedroom without further thought. They don’t speak, they know better than that. Natasha tells him when to duck, hide, or when they need to run. Once or twice, Steve can see the flashlight of one of the guards nearing them.
“A few months, I suppose. I always kind of acted like a dick towards him, pretended I couldn’t stand him. I suppose it worked well enough,” she laughs uncertainly. Then she turns back towards Peter. “Of course, you have no idea who I’m talking about, do you?”
“Well then, Mr. Stark, what else do you suggest?” Tony leans back, sighing softly. To be fair, he can understand their point of view. He got the whole R&D-team to help him develop that soundless MRI, which has been quite the invention of the decennia according to a lot of doctors –
“How about you two head to the workshop then? I’ll make us something to eat,” Steve suggests. “Sharon, want to help?”
All of this, the stuff with Loki, immediately reminded her to those kids in the woods, back on Helvegen. That one boy seemed to ‘like’ her too, but it was all fun and games. She had just been a joke to them. And later it happened again, with Loki. That had to be the last time, never again, she swore to herself.
“In what universe am I not?!”
Flash hesitates a bit longer, but eventually he lowers Peter to the ground completely. Then, he turns back to him, hissing in his face.
“Dude, I have my own bathroom?” Steve nodded, still looking red.
“There was no reason for me to complain, of course, but then they died” Mr. Stark then continues, and then his eyes meet Peter’s, and he looks serious. “I was only a little bit older than you are when I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder. It almost killed me, too.”
Tony nods. “Can we bring up anything she got out of that?” he asks. Bruce nods.
Meanwhile, a little further away, Tony and Steve are just about ready to leave Tony’s bedroom at last when FRIDAY shares the urgent news. Tony’s face turns white at the mention of it. Steve gives him one look before nodding, and after that, Iron Man flies away hurriedly, with Vision and War Machine right behind him.
“What is it?” he asks.
The hand holding Peter’s squeezes into his fingers, trying to get any sort of reaction out of the boy. Much to his surprise, a painful groan escapes Peter’s mouth, making both May and Tony jump up from their seat.
