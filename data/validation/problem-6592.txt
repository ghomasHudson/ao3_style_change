He didn’t think it was a rescue party. He wasn’t so blind to the dwindling support from those who'd pledged their loyalty to him. Yet, there was no other explanation for the noises outside - yelps of surprise, pained grunts and resounding clangs. Finally, the flaps were drawn back, and light flooded his tent.
Tony went down the body, staking his claim on his eyes, his nose, his lips, his ears, his throat, various parts of his chest, placing soft kisses, sucking and nipping at the skin as he declared them to be his. Steve watched, his eyes dark, as Tony licked a broad stripe from his balls to the tip, which he kissed gently. “Mine. All mine,” he said.
“I’m yours,” Tony agreed, and tried to soothe the angry man by rubbing his cheek against his bare chest.
“Don’t we all?” he asked, sardonically. Tony sank back, resting his weight on his elbows, as his head reeled with all the information. He fixed his eyes on the younger man. “Why didn’t
They set off, riding along twisting paths, snaking around the ancient trees. The leapt over fallen trees, dodging the rotting oak, under lowered branches. As they raced toward their freedom, Tony opened his eyes to the beauty of the wilderness and all who dwelled within it. He didn't know where they were going and he didn't even care.
Taking his position behind the boy, to his left, Tony raised the crop above the fleshy round rump, tapped it a few times to practise his aim, and brought it down with a loud crack.
A warm tongue slipped into his mouth, and Tony closed his eyes as the scents of chocolate and vanilla mixed together in a heady rush.
Tony had come to see the light, and it revealed all the cracks and flaws in the system. Perhaps, some of Steve’s beliefs hadn’t been so absurd.  Democracy wasn’t a bad idea. After all, any other man or woman would have been more qualified, more capable, more functional at being a king than he was.
Tony sat up slowly, climbing over Steve to straddle his hips and brushed away the long bangs away from Steve's eyes. In those moments of silence where they just gazed at each other, Tony learnt that Steve had the longest lashes he’d ever seen and there were tiny flecks of green in his blue eyes, which still burned fiercely.
Tony was about to be stripped of his title, his power and his riches, not that there was much left after the rebuilding. He had nothing at all to offer Steve. It made no sense - for Steve to want him.
In the dim lighting, he could barely make out the naked figure bent over the foot of the bed, arms bound above his head and ankles tied to the bottom of the bedposts. Tony would know him blind - by his scent, the way his breaths came and went.
Steve moved closer, and pressed the warm bulge in his jeans against Tony’s naked body. “You tell me.”
It made his mouth water. “Beautiful,” Tony said, pushing his head between his strong thighs to mouth at Steve’s balls. His lips found Steve’s hole, kissing it tenderly, lapping slowly around the rim before slipping his tongue into that tight ass. Drunk on Steve's scent, he alternated between circling his rim and slipping his tongue inside, as Steve moaned his pleasure into the blankets.
“I was going to be good. But if I see a situation pointed south, I can’t ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.”
It didn’t take long for Steve to cut away the last of his ropes. “Come on, we gotta go,” he said, a grim look on his face as he stretched out his hand.
Tony moved in time with Steve’s thrusts, and arched his back as Steve continued to pound his sweet spot, all the while whispering filthy nothings in his ear while he could only clench weakly around Steve.
Tony lowered his smarting hand, and placed his palms on the insides of his thighs, to spread himself wide for Steve.
It was just like his little wildling to fight him at every turn. If only he would express some sort of regret, Tony would be all too happy to take him to bed and shower him with tenderness. But this overt display of defiance, this lack of remorse, had to be addressed.
But this is also Tony Stark sacrificing himself to save Steve Rogers. It's the end Tony favors. From that perspective, this is not a failure of the heart but a triumph.
that the only way to make sure Steve would stop haunting him was to lock him in a box and drop him in the middle of the ocean. Tony wasn't foolish enough to believe that would cut the chain, but he thought: maybe. Maybe.
"You were a child then," Tony says. "You're all grown up now. Time to have a little faith in yourself."
The Registration Act takes these concepts of identity and extends them even further. Being a parahuman or metahuman doesn't make you a superhero any more than having a trust fund makes you a Republican; it only supposes a traditional correlation. Here's where "extra-legal peacekeeper" starts to show up—it's what politicians like to call people with extraordinary abilities, and often operating under a costumed identity, who act as emergency responders on a voluntary basis. Per the SRA, "superhuman" is what you are. "Superhero" is what you
Figuring out how to best enact Registration is an ongoing process. Some of the support programs will take months or years to get off the ground. Camp Hammond's training program is one of our current priorities. I can't comment further.
Tony doesn't fall in love because he wants to fall in love. Tony falls in love because he doesn't have a choice. He loves Steve quietly, faithfully, because it's one of those disgraceful qualities he can't figure out how to cut out of himself. He loves Steve even when it hurts. The hurt is how he knows it's worthwhile. Pain is the only currency the universe understands. For Steve Rogers, Tony has paid dearly.
What Pepper doesn't understand is the precedent. An infinitesimal change in circumstances can cause a radical shift in a dynamic system. Tweak something small, and cause big, unexpected things to happen. It's called catastrophe theory. Charles Xavier is fond of using it to explain some of his more obscure ideas on genetics. Tony, on the other hand, applies it to his own life. For him, the germ of change is trauma—when his parents died, when he was held hostage in Afghanistan, he was catapulted to a higher order of thought. He made connections faster, more readily, understood concepts that had previously been impenetrable. Stressing his body is just a way to replicate those circumstances. Pepper doesn't understand. One of the problems with having had all of your demons on public display is that it makes the people around you suspicious.
VP: You can make it an equipment malfunction. Or not. You can fool the monitors. Maybe he just... fades.
"Maybe you just don't know me that well," Tony suggests. Which is bullshit with a seed of truth in it—Sue's been his friend for years, his occasional business partner for almost that long, but she's never seen him at his lowest, because that's an honor reserved for those he loves the most. How else are you going to know they care about you, if you don't test them, and push them, and make them hate you?
"Meeting with the Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee, press conference to follow. You wanted to go over those cybernetics breakthroughs from the Far East Division, that's a teleconference with Doctor Endo at whatever time the both of you are still awake—"
He's working on training himself out of that. The results of the Extremis enhancile allow him to directly alter his neural pathways; it's only a matter of conditioning and a few lines of the right code to wean his body off of sleeping. He's doing it carefully this time, systematically—during his last attempt, he rushed the process, and Mordred exploited his lapse. Isn't that how it always is? Someone younger and smarter comes along and leaves you and all your planning in the dust. In the meantime, he still feels tired. It's psychological driftwood, the remains of a previous release of Tony Stark. He drinks coffee as a temporary relief agent. Sometimes he forgets about the coffee, and the coffee gets cold. Cause and effect.
Rhodey goes, but not without shooting Tony one final look of wounded suspicion. People are worried about him; it's always a novel feeling, and an undeserved one, since they're worried about the wrong thing.
"Sir." There's a fraction of a second of hesitation during which Tony can imagine Gomez gathering his nerve, and then the guy says, "Anything I can help with?"
Danvers responds, and then she grunts. His HUD informs him that she's locked in a fight with Johnny Storm.
Thirty thousand days ago, he got into this business because he wanted to help people. He wanted all kinds of other things, too, because he's always been a creature of unprejudiced want, but that was the base of it, underneath the thirst for atonement and betterment and recognition and redemption: he wanted to help people. And now he can't even do that; he's alone in the dark in an empty room with his demons pouring out of the bottle.
Steve's crouched in front of him, echoing Maya's earlier posture. Why couldn't he be haunted by Happy? He's been quietly, faithfully, desperately in love with Steve for years, but sometimes Steve is an asshole.
Maya kicks him. He catches it in the ribs and the spine, rolls away from her next blow, and gets his feet under him. Happy taught him that—the importance of footwork.
"And this is the way to do it?" There's a whistling sound; he can't tell where it's coming from, can't tell if it tinnitus or some part of his suit that's been breached. "Can't perform with no audience, Maya, and we're both performers if nothing else."
and until you're using those abilities to go out in the street and fight bad guys. In which case we're asking you to adhere to the same safety and procedural standards as any other first responder, which I think we can all agree is more than fair. There in the back—hit me.
HH: Nah, not until later. Pep's getting all gussied up. I wanted to stop by the community center, figured I'd swing by on the way and see how you're doing.
"Safe," Reed says. "They miss their mother, of course, but one of the few comforts in all this is that she trusted me enough to leave the children with me. HERBIE's watching them now. I teleported over," he adds. Implied:
It is. Registration is the law. We—superheroes, peacekeepers, Avengers—don't get to decide what's legal. We only get to decide how we're going to comply.
All eyes fall on the young man who’s just entered the room, his smile proving to be terribly infectious.
She watches Tony’s eyes dart around as if the answers will somehow be there. She notices that his breathing is slightly uneven as if he’s having an inward battle to keep his rage in check.
“Okay,” Brock pushes away from Howard, stumbling back slightly. “It was Steve Rogers’s agent… Sharon….I dunno, Sharon something.”
“I don’t need an explanation from you, Hogan,” Howard cuts in. “Apart from not being around when what happened at the Premiere happened, you’ve done nothing but support my views. Pepper on the other hand-”
The drawn out curse, the focused controlled breathing, the way Tony’s entrance rejects the intrusion has Steve thinking his assumptions just might be entirely accurate.
“It’s nothing I can’t handle, Mr. Harris,” Steve says lowly, realizing how painfully porno it sounds but loving the way it makes his boss’s eyes darken.
“Nitro Cold Brew,” Steve holds the glass up to a very startled and horribly sexy-looking Tony. Tony always looks most edible when his hair is still a mess and his robe is barely tied and he’s so thrown off routine that he looks as though he might fumble an equation that a first grader can answer in their sleep.
Steve stops moving and Tony wishes he hadn’t because the second he does, an intense need to thrust against him takes over Tony.
Tony seems to take it as invitation enough to grind down against Steve and Steve is only half surprised to feel the other boy as hard as he is.
But what Steve will miss most of all about being with Tony Stark is the way Tony made Steve feel worth being with. Like they were in some sort of collective reverie that started with Tony’s intake yet didn’t end on Steve’s exhale. Like the mere touch of Tony’s fingertips against his temple could erase every bad memory and trace in new beautiful imageries filled with hope and happiness. It could only be that fake thing stupid people liked to label as love and Steve had hoped they’d share that idiocy forever.
“Give me something worth laughing at and I just might grace you with the honor of hearing me express my amusement.”
She knows he won’t understand, not now. He won’t see peoples’ efforts to protect him. Not her efforts or her husband’s. All he can see is the people who are supposed to love him, ripping him of the little
Steve laughs, not caring the least bit about the blush that tints his cheeks. Mainly because that thought had, in fact, crossed his mind more times than once.
“Let me help you with that,” Tony smiles down at the old lady once beside her. It only takes a second of thought before she genuinely returns his smile, handing him the knife.
Tony closes the distance between them, placing a much needed kiss on Steve’s waiting lips. He’s slightly annoyed when Steve pulls away so suddenly, but the smile on Steve’s face effortlessly softens him.
“I will do whatever you want,” Tony’s voice is much deeper than before, “you know this. But the one thing I’m
Or maybe, Steve thinks, it’s still just all an act. Neil Patrick Harris, the stranger who he just met at the DVD store and is now entering is a bi-curious biker who is only just now, for the first time, giving into his curiosity.
“I’m signing the contract.” Tony interrupts Howard and his father’s face instantly changes a few shades redder.
“So obviously, Zane is distraught,” Tony continues.“He asks around town, he tries everything. But he eventually gives up and totally pretends that he’s alright with everything. But something snaps inside him on the day of his graduation. He realizes he’s about to completely move on with his life, go off and study, fall in love, live. And he doesn’t want to. Not without Jake. So guess what he does.”
Steve wipes his sweaty palms on his jeans, having no control over the way his leg is bouncing up and down. The clock on the wall is ticking far too loudly and the look he’s getting every now and then as Sharon pages through his portfolio is completely unnerving.
He’s been dozing on and off all day waiting for just such a moment and it’s finally –practically- handed to him.
He’s only seen her once before, he’s been expecting a visit the entire day. He’s anticipated her anger, yet when he opens the door, he still stumbles back when she shoves him.
Maria holds still, holding her breath subconsciously as she watches her son sought through his emotions in front of her.
Tony walks down the studio corridor, a heavy box in his arms and a lollypop in his mouth. The red candy is making his already pink lips even rosier.
“We’ll speak when I get home,” Tony says, repositioning himself so that he’s lying flat on his back with his head resting on Steve’s lap and one leg swinging over the arm rest. “I don’t know when, Dad.”
“Was that an insult?” Tony raises a brow, “Because we’ve got over ten million viewers and fans all over the world and if the stats are that high just to see me naked, I’d say that’s a compliment.”
“You don’t have to get that,” Tony smiles, running his hands up her legs in the process. Pepper can’t believe that she is actually considering it.
Ms. Wanda has assured Tony that she was already heading up to see Joseph’s progress in the morning. She assured him that he’s more than welcome to tag along and Tony immediately accepted. But right now he feels an intoxicating need to be with Steve at that very moment.
He’s worried about Tony. Concerned about his career, yes, but most of his emotion is directed at the boy. His family. His future.
Eventually when his father does pick up the phone, he’s wondering if his call is too much of an inconvenience to even bother going through with it.
“Goodbye, Tony,” Hill states, a tiny smile gracing her features as she noticed Tony’s blatant desperation to stay.”
Steve turns to Tony, pleading with his eyes for privacy. Tony also picks up on the unspoken apology before nodding.
“Yeah,” Tony grins. “And get this, his reason for not telling Zane was because he didn’t want to hold him back. Jake was thoroughly convinced he wasn’t going to make it, and he didn’t want Zane to have to go through the loss. And they have this whole really emotional reunion, I swear, Pepper, the dialogue in this script is amazing. So anyway, Zane refuses to leave Jake no matter what-”
in fact, noticeably paler and he’s wiping his palms over his thighs. Tony also notices that Steve’s taken his advice by mixing old jeans with new shoes and an old jacket with a trendy t-shirt.
Steve had been called into the office and found himself face to face with a very blasé looking Tony-soon to be boss. And Harold’s large hand had fallen heavily on Steve’s shoulder.
“Oh, don’t let me get started on that,” Steve scoffs. “I swear, the only reason why people watch that show is in the hopes of Tony Stark taking his shirt off-”
Disappointed by her reply, but hardly shocked, Hogan rolls onto his back and stares up at the ceiling.
Tony’s eyes dart to the front row, to the exact seat. The same place he’s been paying so much attention to all night. He’s sure he isn’t the only one who’s noticed.
“Oh,” Stark looks around himself, putting on a bewildered front, “because I was just talking about how we’re going to be able to push our revenue incalculably, I always find that thoroughly amusing.”
“Nope,” is all the response Steve gets. And he would’ve made some silly joke by feigning shock over the fact that the other man can actually speak had his request not so rudely just been shut down.
Steve his leg between Tony’s thighs to coax his legs further apart and Tony can’t figure out where Steve’s hands had been before, because they feel far too good kneading his ass.
Tony sighs with a smile as if he’s nervous about the fact that he’s actually going to give Steve an honest answer.
It’s a misplaced feeling, considering it how it is his job to make money off of the mishaps of others. But it’s different with Sharon.
“Hope to be hearing from you soon,” Brock makes an awkward escape for the door, “There’s only so long that I can hold onto the copies before the tabloids get them.”
The entire day has been an event and Hogan knows that the only reason Tony is having them run up and down is in the hopes that they’ll give up and leave him alone.
is supposed to be. Given the Wild West woodiness meshed with modern day furnishing and displaced grunge décor, Steve guesses the owner is having a hard time figuring it out too. But the place does have an abundance of the one thing he came there for. So deciding against letting his friend’s tardiness stand in the way of him wrecking his own sobriety, Steve heads straight for the bar and plants himself on the first bar stool that doesn’t look as though it might end up giving him Gonorrhoea.
He skims his hands over Steve’s muscled torso and then his strong back, trying to move calmly as Steve grinds his hips against him.
“This,” Steve can feel himself shake, his lips trembling mere fractions away from Tony’s. “This is more than just…. I don’t know Tony, just getting off. This… this isn’t a game to me. This means something to me. You mean something to me.”
Howard finds what he was looking for and tosses the envelope onto the desk between the two of them. When Tony simply eyes him, Howard gestures towards it, encouraging his boy to open it.
“This is not in the script,” Steve says breathlessly as Tony’s hot lips trail over the soft skin on his neck.
“I’ve been trying to call you,” Bucky almost purrs and Steve opens his mouth to inform Bucky that he hasn’t once changed his number in the hopes that Bucky would do just that - which is why Steve quickly shuts it. “But, you’re obviously busy.”
“I swear to God, Pepper,” Tony frowns, “he was gonna beat the shit outta me. I could see it coming.”
“But, it’s not too late to change things,” Howard continues. “We can still get out of this in a way where everyone wins. Like I said Steve, I know what you need. I’ve spoken to Sharon Carter and I
Steve’s eyes snap open, eyeing the gadget in Tony’s hand as message after message flood in. The short scoffed chuckle from Tony is Steve’s exact inward reaction.
“Think about it, Tony,” Lee ignores Hogan altogether, stepping around the cluttered table in the 12th floor office to stand right in front of the boy. “If you take on this role, it will be a changing point in your career. You will begin to be viewed as more than just a pretty face, because let’s face it, you are.”
“Fuck the script,” Tony grins, not caring that he catchest Steve halfway through a chuckle as he joins their lips once again.
,” Bucky’s at least mindful enough to lower his voice when his outburst earns the two of them some disapproving looks from passers-by. “Whatever happened to the past year of you convincing me not to worry because
For a moment, neither of them says a word. Tony’s trying to remember Steve had told about it, but he just hadn’t being paying attention. Maybe he hadn’t listened to Steve well enough at all.
Steve moans his approval, or encouragement, he isn’t really bothered when the absence of Tony’s jacket allows him to run his fingers over toned flesh, muscle he never expected a self-privileged brat would be disciplined enough to break a sweat long and hard enough to attain.
The red-haired, red lipped, red horned Vixen of gossip on television. She lives off of the blunders of celebrities, preys on their every flaw. She steals their secrets and stirs them with her pitchfork after adding her own spices, generously dishing out mounds of it to starving, worshiping fans who seem to lick their bowls thoroughly clean every time.
She doesn’t want any more questions from him. He will either be asking her to sleep with him or worse, questioning her about himself. Pepper knows this. Tony has just too many questions about himself, but they never seem to be the right ones.
Hogan knows that everyone thinks Tony’s just being unassuming for show. Hogan knows it’s just who Tony is.
“Okay,” Tony nods. Steve exhales into the soft kiss that’s placed on his lips before they both move to get out of the water.
Tony nods with a polite smile and then doesn’t really care if he’s being too forward when he pushes, “about his father, Ms. Wanda?”
Tony’s acting completely casual. A little too casual considering the situation. But then Steve begins to confuse himself because it’s exactly what he’d wanted. For Tony not to freak out. For Tony not to go back on what he’d said last night.
Steve feels his tenacity slip and he’s immediately unlaced. Whatever it was that had been blocking out emotion or keeping it at precisely the right distance was completely wrecked now. His heart thumps dangerously hard, pumping fueled emotion into his system, through his veins. He squeezes his eyes shut, battling it one last time.
Tony, the boy she was once infatuated with is now a young man. The boy she’d offered love not excepting anything in return. Well at least not the way she’d wanted it. Pepper is hardly sure if she’d ever even wanted it herself.
One unknowing turn around a bend brought them head-on with a driver who’d misconstrued right for left in his drunken stupor and Steve’s father’s reflexes hadn’t been quick enough to save them both. A DUI caused Steve to lose his mother and for Steve’s father to lose the use of his legs.
Tony shuts his eyes, irritated by the situation but fully prepared to stay there for as long as it takes. He’s just about to lose himself in his own thoughts until he hears his name.
Tony rolls his eyes, sitting up as Pepper scurries off of him. She picks up his t-shirt and tosses it to him, beckoning him towards the bathroom.
“Yeah,” Steve sits up a little straighter, hope rising. “When I was six. I did a skit for Drink-O-Pop.”
“Well to be honest with you, Peggy,” Tony begins, “there are a few complications that are preventing us from continuing airing the show. That’s all I’m permitted to say.”
“I thought I was being thrown in on the deep end alone.” She continues, “Howard sounded really pissed on the phone.”
When Lee had finally finished speaking to the two young men, Tony had simply shook Steve’s hand and said his goodbyes.
Steve can’t help but smile as he watches his father inspect the thin tube that’s pierced into his arm. As he twists his arm around, Joseph Rogers winces slightly, but seems to be more concerned about whether or not all his tattoos were still in tacked. Steve looks at Tony who seems uncharacteristically uncomfortable. He’s grateful for the encouraging smile that Tony manages followed by a gentle push towards the hospital bed.
Pepper feels her heart skip a beat. This is where it usually starts at times like this. The tone in Tony’s voice, the way he’s clinging to her. She knows where this was going.
“That’s my point exactly. It isn’t true so who the hell cares,” Tony shakes his head. “You haven’t even given the plot a chance, dad. It’s a really great story-line, but the second you hear the word, ‘gay’, your tail goes between your legs.”
It’s only a coincidence that as Steve walks down the corridor of the studio, his eyes happen to fall on Maria Stark.
“I gave him the morning off,” Steve says triumphantly as he urges a very sceptical looking Tony towards his breakfast with his hands on the shorter man’s hips.
Maria knows who Tony’s talking about. As shocking as it all still is, she knows he’s rhetorically questioning her about Steve Rogers. In her mind, she envisions Tony asking the same question about Howard as well.
The rough growl that’s provoked from deep in Tony’s throat is enough to make Steve smile. Not a mocking smile at all, but an
“There isn’t, Mr. Stark,” Steve supplies an answer when it becomes clear that Stark won’t continue without one. “I’m sorry, it won’t happen again.”
Steve feels his suddenly exposed cock throb when Tony’s eyes fix on it. Feels it leak when Tony spreads his legs wider, taking his own cock into a loose fist. Giving it a few distracted strokes before squeezing the base. As if he too realizes there is no way in hell that round one is going to last very long at all.
“You proposed to Mr-your-boss-Stark-,” Bucky sounds as if he’s learning the joys of speech for the first time. And then he’s eyes go worryingly wide as he practically squeaks out, “-on Valentine’s Day?”
Tony pulls the covers back and drops himself into Steve’s bed, the boy’s scent instantly invading Tony’s nostrils.
Steve forces his eyes open, not seeing much at all. He lets out a sharp breath when Tony rolls his hips a little too skillfully for him to ever claim he can’t dance. Then Steve realizes, as Tony’s teeth sink into his shoulder, there is no way he will be able to get a word in if he lets this continue.
Although Steve’s mind is working in overdrive, given his circumstances, he doesn’t have to wait long to figure out exactly why he’s been called in once again.
Steve moves gently, resting his head on Tony’s shoulder and draping an arm over his chest as he tangled their legs together perfectly.
“Okay, I get it,” Steve chuckles again, scrolling down the games menu to store his progress. “I totally needed that intervention.”
Complete silence fills the room as Tony gets dressed. He stops twice, looks as though he is fully about to say something, but then decides against it.
How much does he know? What does he think? What will happen to Tony? It’s all that Steve can think about as he swallows the huge lump of fear hanging like a dull ache in his throat.
Steve covers the ground between them, falling into step with Tony as he immediately continues down the hallway.
“Would you like to take a seat sir?” a lady in the control room asks him. Hogan almost doesn’t hear her, his eyes fixed on one of the many screens and his heart beating thunderously.
Steve had thought a smile was miles away, especially with the subject being so sensitive. But as Tony’s words sink in, he can’t help but grin sheepishly. Tony mirrors him, a look of satisfaction on his face.
He gratefully accepts the towel he’s offered from an assistant, giving him a thankful smile before wiping off the fake sweat that had been sprayed on him throughout the photoshoot. When he pats his back dry as best he can, Tony tries his best not to ruin the temporary tattoo that’s been plastered onto him.
drive right over here like I told you to?” Howard turns on Hogan, who looks stunned by the abrupt rage turned on him. “What the hell am I paying you for?”
Steve’s eyes flicker, breath catching slightly in his throat. It’s so hard to keep his character going when the intensity of Tony’s acting always throws him off.
Although the boy had looked close to tears seconds before, the few words from Tony instantly brightened his mood. So much, in fact, that he nearly loses his step on the way out of the audition room.
Steve’s grin suddenly falls away when Tony looks at him almost solemnly. Not solemn, annoyed, that’s what it is.
Tony only feels half embarrassed about displaying such affection in front of the man when Steve takes his hand. He decides to relax when all Joseph offers was a pleased smile.
Stan Lee rubs his hands over his face, both coming to rest over his mouth with his elbows propped up on his office table.
In the past, Bucky and Joseph were really good friends to the point of having more in common than Steve and Bucky did. And although to may annoyed Steve to some extent, there was always a deep warmth in knowing that both his parents adored his first boyfriend. His first love.
“You know what?” Tony says, making his way through the lobby, “I think I’m gonna head out. I found what I was looking for.”
“Well, Peggy,” Tony begins after little deliberation, “I’m taking on a role as the gay protagonist in a Marvel Productions film.”
by everyone else. What he was to say was already written, what he was to feel was told to him. How he had to act was directed.
Steve eyes the empty space on the bed beside Tony. In the state that he’s in, it looks like the best decision he will make all night. It isn’t long before Steve is shrugging his pants off and kicking them into the mass with his t-shirt and jacket and the rest of Tony’s clothing.
As Tony releases over Steve’s hand and over his own stomach, all he can think about is the distorted perfection of it all. The dangerous pleasure. The insane normality.
He can’t believe that Steve faked his emotions or didn’t feel what he felt whenever they kissed. He doesn’t want to believe that it had all just been a scam.
He doesn’t know it’s because she hadn’t seen him properly before when the room was still dark. He doesn’t know it’s because she’s thoroughly taken aback by his remarkable beauty. If only he could know that she would do literally anything to sign him under her name right then and there. But he doesn’t.
Tony smiles as he watches Steve hug his father as best as he can without disturbing the hospital apparatus. Apart from the shaggy grizzled hair and dark morning shadow, there’s no mistaking the obvious resemblance between the two.
Steve holds the door in place, a strange look crossing his face that tells Tony that Steve obviously thinks something really bad has to have happened for Tony to be on the other side of his door.
“Mr. Stark,” Steve utters out breathlessly, warningly. Because his boss’s hand is on his hip, lips against his ear and if ever there was a better way to get Harold to sack his own son, this was it. But Tony’s hand is on his hip and his lips are against his ear and Steve suddenly wants to hire something other than a stupid DVD.
“Keep your hands above your head or I’ll tie them to the headboard,” Steve orders darkly, because Steve’s nipples have always been embarrassingly sensitive and he would be horridly embarrassed if he came like this. Tony does as he’s told, not before giving the peak one last pinch as he lets Steve’s wet finger slide from his lips.
When he opens the docket, the headshots that follow make his heart race. Breathtaking in their simplicity, portraying Steve exactly how Tony remembers him.
“Tony Stark,” a man with a clipboard and headphones stands halfway through the doorway, “you’re on in five minutes. Please come with me.”
“You’re both fired,” he confirms before closing the door with a look of pure disgust on his face, “Have a good day.”
Tony tears his eyes away from the photographs, searching his father’s eyes for a second. He tries to make sense of what the man is telling him, but he just can’t believe it. Believe that everything with Steve was all a lie. A setup.
“You can play the guitar?” Tony beams and Steve feels  pitiful for feeling so awesome by the fact that Tony’s genuinely impressed by what he could do.
He’s suddenly uncomfortable. A little worried, in fact, by the way the casting agent is suddenly looking at him.
Thirty minutes later, Bucky is perched on the edge of Steve’s desk, tears sliding down his face as he tries desperately to calm his hysterics.
“This is a cut-throat business, Sharon,” Brock shrugs. “And you know this. I also gotta keep a roof over my head. Either way, what’s done is done. Now if you back off from being all hostile, I might put you in on the deal. Say… forty percent.”
“If we keep at this,” Tony breathes against Steve’s neck, prying the other man’s hand out of his pants, “the credits are going to roll before we even turn the camera on.”
Usually, Lee would find amusement in Tony’s focused sarcasm, but not at this moment. He can’t even bring himself to try.
“Yes, can I please speak to the incredibly sexy, Ms. Wanda,” Steve says in a voice as deep as he could fake.
On more than one occasion he’d wanted to give up, wondering if it was really worth waiting for. Wondering if the spot he’d chosen to park in was overlooked the wrong side of Tony’s agent’s house. He knew he had the right address; Sharon had called ample times to clarify. But he’d chosen that spot since it was the only place one could look down into the yard and still have ample camouflage.
Tony’s face instantly lightens up and Pepper can’t help but smile as well. She wonders if he actually knows how striking he is.
“Because I’ve only just taken over the family business less than a week and all that you said there is just gibberish to me,” he says nonchalantly with the smallest of shrugs. “Now, if you want a beer, I can get you a beer. But if you want that fancy nonsense I’ll get you the bartender.”
Steve smiles, holding Tony’s gaze for several seconds before Tony shuts his eyes as if Steve is distracting him.
Turning on the television to see himself. Walking past magazine racks to see himself. His face is on t-shirts and Coca-Cola billboards and all he ever thinks about is how ridiculous it all is.
He doesn’t need to speak to Sharon Carter anymore; there’s just no reason to. Hell, he’s grateful that he no longer even has to tolerate her for a second.
“I let him, because he’s my boss,” Steve sighs and opens the first folder of far too many. “Have a stiff one for me,” Steve gives Bucky an impassive smile before turning to his monitor in a way he hopes lets Bucky know he needs to be left to it without coming off too discourteous.
Tony smiles at that, noticing how Steve looked more pretty than handsome back then. He actually looks more like his mother than his father. Every single family photo that lines the walls in his own parents’ house was shot in a studio and later digitally enhanced to perfection.
“He was talking to both of us, pansy pants,” Tony chuckles, quoting a direct and particularly tasteless insult from the script.
But Steve thinks, perhaps, simple respect in the workplace isn’t the only thing that Steve has really wanted from Tony all along.
“-big time. And I miss you. I’ve missed your dad too.” Bucky continues, voice lowering just as Steve opens the door. “I miss us,” Bucky.
Hogan simply nods, taking in the polished look that Tony is sporting. Hogan picked the suit out for him. Everyone seems more shocked that Tony actually wore it.
“Yes, no problem, sir,” he ultimately decides, picking up on the fact that Lee’s question hadn’t really been a question at all. “I’ll be there.”
“You know,” Bucky sounds like he’s blocking the mouthpiece to make sure no one on the other end of the line can hear what he has to say next, “I fucked up-”
He’s been so lost in just watching Tony’s peaceful form. The way his back moves as he breathes softly. The way his hair is all over the place, over his pillow. His long dark lashes are still and his pink lips are fuller. Lips that had been over his just last night.
It seems to have the intended effect because the moan that comes out of Tony’s mouth when his head falls on Steve’s shoulder sounds like it should be sex’s international anthem.
A few weeks ago he was the nice young fellow who waited tables at the locally frequented deli in his small hometown. And now he’s suddenly worth more than a
“I don’t blame you. It’s really old. Like, twelve years ago. I doubt I would have even gotten that gig if it wasn’t for my mother.”
“Stop,” Bucky looks as though he’s about to go squint. “That is just way too complicated and fucked up.”
“Because….” Tony says, pausing to exhale when he pushes the weight to arm’s length and hangs it back up.
“Way? What way? He’s been that way or ages,” Hogan shakes his head. “Tony is the biggest star since Johnny Depp was in
Tony’s constantly asking himself the same question, and so he doesn’t bother answering Clint. He knows it obviously has something to do with the fact that he’d taken on Stan Lee’s role. He’s certain Hogan had a problem with that. And so, he felt, if Hogan had a problem with that, Hogan shouldn’t matter.
“Hey, are you sure your boy is ready back there,” Tony says as an afterthought, “He looked kinda green just now.”
“So, Tony,” Peggy, the thirty year old, gorgeous, talk show host continues, “you’re undoubtedly the hottest thing since Johnny Depp starred in
Tony’s only slightly annoyed by Ms. Wanda’s inability to stick to one topic at a time. There’s something far too sweet about her for him to get completely irritated.
Tony doesn’t like the sudden loss of weight over him when Steve moves off to slip into the bathroom. Minutes later when Steve decides he’s done a decent enough job of burning the evidence and the two boys tangle themselves together under the covers, Tony is content for the first time in ages.
Landing a role in a Marvel Production was also a major surprise for Steve. He’d known about Marvel for years, the company’s ratings higher than any other in the film industry. It was still a surreal feeling that he’d rubbed shoulders with the best of the best, even though he was sure that was all going to be behind him now.
“We were all about to head over to Hogan’s,” Pepper says quickly, paying no attention to Tony’s annoyance, Hogan’s shock or Steve’s confusion. “It would be great if you could join us.”
The first two times, the phone had just rung. He wasn’t sure if he was shocked or not that he’s third time lucky.
“He postponed last minute,” Steve shrugs, pouring milk into both bowls before sliding one over to Tony.
If little gestures like pouring cereal was going to evoke a smile like that out of Tony, Steve decides right then that he’ll do stuff like that more often. Or as often as possible. He blushes sheepishly as he takes the chair across from Tony.
“There’s this kid,” she continues, her all business-tone making Brock lose his smirk. “He’s a rising star. He’s been rubbing shoulders with the best in the business-”
It’s nothing like anything he’s ever been in, windows going all the way up to the ceiling and unnecessary decorative pillars parting them, lodged in every corner too. It’s all gentle creams and impossibly white linen, the carpet posh enough to make its softness known through Steve’s socks when he toes off his shoes. Even with the high lamps slightly dimmed, Steve can make out the calculated swirls on the wall, crevices too deep to be wallpaper yet too distinctive to be stencil.
He does, however, feel slightly uncomfortable when his father peers over his shoulder and looks down at the photographs in his hand.
When Hogan gets out of the bed, Pepper’s grateful that he’d at least bothered putting his briefs back on before confronting her. Somehow, arguing with a naked seemed uncouth.
“Well,” Tony starts, “at first I wasn’t really sure if I wanted to do it. Even after the talk show fiasco. But then I actually sat down and read the script. Pepper, it kept me up all night, I was hooked. This story has to be told, and I want to be the one to bring it to life.”
He heats up to heights unknown, instantly cooling seconds later in that familiar state of being taken over.
“On second thoughts,” Tony straightens, sliding the disk labelled ‘Let’s Get It On’ into his jacket pocket. “Jack in IT can take care of it in the morning. Enjoy your evening Mr. Rogers”
Steve rolls his eyes at the tackiness of the case in his hand, chuckling at the scantily dressed cowboys who apparently ‘find sweet, hot love in the barn’, when a presence looms over his shoulder.
Steve feels a weight lift off his shoulders when Tony’s hand slips into his and their fingers entwine as they walk towards Ms. Wanda and the boys.
“Nice socks,” Tony practically purrs and Steve practically dies because he just had to have chosen that day to wear that ridiculous pair. One foot, blue with white stars and the other, white with red stripes. It’s the last time he ever keeps a birthday gift from Bucky.
They went into this with clear eyes, aware that morality was a luxury, so Tony doesn't offer his condolences outright, even if he's deeply, deeply sorry that the most committed couple he knows called it quits because of a law that passed thanks to Tony's support. "I can't imagine what that's like," is what he settles on.
They all have their sore spots; Tony's got half a dozen of them right under his surface, but he's practiced at playing the game, and he's aware that he deserves whatever the papers want to dish out. Steve, though—it's hard to drag Captain America through the mud, but it can be done, even if it's usually inadvertent rather than deliberately malicious. The media's two favorite tactics are treating Steve like a museum exhibit rather than a soldier who really lived through the Battle of the Bulge and treating Steve like an unfailing beacon of morality and patriotism rather than a human being. Steve is a good man. He's not infallible.
"You know what your problem is?" She reconsiders. "Well. You know what one of your problems is? You sold out. I remember when you were original. Now you're just treading water."
"It sounds like science fiction, believe me, I know. I'm aware that I sound like the next L. Ron Hubbard—although hey, if anyone wants to buy their way into having their soul saved… oh, c'mon, stop flattering me. I'm serious, though. You think it's science fiction? I'm telling you that it's already been
They want to flagellate him with Steve? Let them. Tony has borne those lash marks for more than a decade. There aren't any nerve endings left; he's scar tissue all the way down.
But Tony isn't wrong: he knows what's coming, he just lacks the words to make Steve understand. Tony isn't Mordred; he's Cassandra, and Troy is burning. If he falters now for lack of conviction, he might as well have laid down in the snow and let himself die all those years ago when his heart was fighting a losing battle against addiction.
News of Stark's promotion broke only hours ago, when Secretary of Defense Jack Kooning held an early-morning press conference. No mention was made of previous director Maria Hill other than to say she was taking a period of "indefinite leave."
And that's how it goes. Boynton or some other jackal with an agenda starts pushing, and then it's Peter on a lab table, it's Steve being required to give blood samples, it's Carol having to spill all the details about the Kree that are locked in her head and her genes.
For a moment, Tony genuinely believes he's not going to acknowledge the question. He genuinely believes he has the strength to keep his eyes from straying to Steve. But Steve's patient; Steve knows him. If outwaiting Tony is the name of the game, Steve Rogers would wait until the end of the world.
"What are you so afraid of?" Steve says. That's the rub with Steve—he always sees too much of Tony, and never quite enough. It's Tony's fault, but there's no way to translate the hundred-thousand intricate processes in his head to speech.
CB: But most people tend to think of you as the team's leaders anyway. Is that because the two of you are comfortable challenging each other?
Are they at the end of their lifespan? Are they worn out, obsolete, useless? Tony wonders, sometimes, he wonders about the Avengers; but people aren't products, and if the Avengers are failing, it only means they need to be rebuilt again, newer, better, bigger, wider in scope and more reliable, an engine of guardians to stand between Earth and the stars. They only have to weather this storm, and that means Tony has to make sure as many of them as possible make it through Registration intact.
You weren't supposed to tell people: not when it was like this, not when the truth was this barbed ugly thing that was better kept close where it pierced only you. Tony cradled that truth, protective of it even as it bored into her. She didn't have to work at it; enduring came to her naturally. And it was rare enough that nobody would suspect—
Steve pulled away from the kiss to look at him. “Who? Me?” he asked, mockingly, and added a second finger, and the shaking of his hand caused waves of pleasure to shoot through Tony's body. “Didn’t quite think you remembered.”
“Come to bed,” he said, watching as the boy climbed on after him, crawling painfully to lie on his stomach, resting his head on his favourite pillow, the one which Steve said reminded him of home.
“No,” he answered, before opening his mouth to accept Tony’s cock again. It pushed against the walls of his throat, making it hard to breathe, and by the time it was over, he was feeling lightheaded.
Steve complied, lifting his legs and spreading them with his strong hands, as he offered himself to Tony. Tony took his feet, kissing them slowly while he stroked his calves and thighs.
Lowering him gently on the bed, Tony could make out the curves of Steve’s muscles, rippling with power and control. “Turn over. Get that pretty bottom high in the air for me. Legs apart. Wider. Use your hands. Let’s see that sweet cunt.”
Steve sighed in relief as the soothing gel made contact with his sore skin. A generous layer was applied over his bottom, and Tony took the time to rub it into his cleft and hole.
Steve lay on the bed on his back, with his legs splayed open, his plugged bottom in the air. Tony reached for the plug between his well-oiled bottom, twisting it for fun before pulling it out with a lewd pop. Steve’s hole opened and closed, gaping at the emptiness, begging to be filled. Tony obliged, lifting Steve's legs to rest them on his shoulder, taking his time to tenderly kiss his feet. Then, his cock was at his entrance, pushing in slowly, inch by inch, until he’d reached the hilt.
Their eyes met, like two men on opposite sides of a canyon, unable to see what the other saw – so near they could see each mark of beauty or flaw, but not close enough to touch. Yet, neither had the courage to leap over the raging current, to cross over to the other side.
Tony missed him. He missed him all the time, especially at night, when it got cold and dark. He’d even started reminiscing about their fights, fondly remembering how Steve would argue with him, passionately, getting all riled up when they couldn’t see eye to eye. He’d storm off in a rage, only to return by the hour with his eyes still blazing, kissing him ardently with his warm mouth, skin hot to the touch.
They lay there for a couple of minutes to catch their breaths, with Tony holding Steve close to him, rubbing his hands up and down his back.
“Is that why you’ve ruined them?” Tony asked, and glanced pointedly at the pile of ripped clothing beside.
In those times of darkness, Tony wondered if he would once again see the light of his life. If he got to set eyes on his angel, just for a moment, he’d happily spend eternity in heaven or hell or wherever they sent people like him - the ones who did all the wrong things for the right reasons, fucking everything up as they bumbled along their way.
His final stop was the stables, where he unlocked the gate to his horse’s stall. He winced, feeling sorry for Steve as he imagined his sore buttocks bouncing against the hard saddle on his long ride to the forest. It was at least a two-day ride to the rebel base. Would he think of Tony the whole time? Steve would forget him in a week, at most, while he would remember him for the rest of his life.
“Thank me properly,” Tony said as he grabbed a fistful of Steve’s hair, so Steve trailed behind him toward the bed, still on his hands and knees.
Tony let out a heavy sigh. “It’s been on my mind,” he confessed, opening up to the younger man. "I want to. I mean, it feels like the right thing to do. But men, good men, have fought and died to keep the Stark name on that crown. I don't even know if it’s my choice to make.”
Tony made a soft sound of protest as the intrusive fingers delved in and out, and kindled a fire which soon spread to the rest of his body. “You’re my alpha,” Tony said in what he hoped was an appeasing tone. “Can’t possibly forget that. You remind me every day.”
Tony strained his ears, listening with rapt attention to the sounds of the guards outside bumbling at
Tony rested his hand on a hip, stroking the bone that jutted out. “Now? Do you yield? Going to stop running to your rebel friends? Going to stay with me?” he asked, whispering into his pretty ear.
Steve moaned in his throat. “Yours - belonged to you,” he whispered, squeezing tightly around his finger.
“There’s my man,” Tony whispered, as he looked fondly at his husband, with his hair all mussed up and skin flushed from his ears to his chest.
The flames were beginning to die down, but it was still comfortably warm when Steve moved over, tentatively putting his arms around his waist. “It’s cold,” he explained.
Tony shrugged off his own jacket. “I imagined the night ending very, very differently. Nevertheless, you were going to be naked.” Tony tilted his head, tapping on the carpeted spot beside him with his foot. Steve lowered himself to the spot, face down and ass up, just the way Tony liked.
Tony shook his head before Steve could follow through on the threat. He was capable of doing it too - leaving Tony tied up and leaking all night.
Tony took it, following Steve to the doorway, where they were greeted by lines and lines of unconscious guards. “They are so going to have you whipped for this,” Tony whispered, deeply impressed.
Tony had listened half-heartedly to the general’s report of how they’d caught him in his study, trying to steal their plans to quell the uprising. What had got his attention was the description of how the guards had seized his belongings, stripping him and searching him quite thoroughly, to the extent of slipping more than one oiled finger into his firm, young ass.
“So, it’s been a day of revelations,” Tony said, lying down beside Steve, completely exhausted. “Is there anything else I need to know before I try to get some sleep?”
Tony turned around to kiss his lover’s parted lips, slipping his tongue into that warm mouth.  His hand trailed down Steve’s chest, caressing his soft skin before finding his hard and wet cock - proof of his desire.
“Pretty boys like you shouldn’t have clothes. You’ll just use them to get a rise from the innocent people around you.”
He rubbed the oil all over Steve’s sore bottom, paying special attention to the area between his cheeks. The generous serving dribbled down his crack toward his balls and cock. Tony scooped up the droplets, coating his half-hard cock with a thick layer of it. He pulled back his foreskin, rubbing a good amount on his clit.
With his free hand, he stroked the bottom of Steve’s thighs, hearing a hiss as he went over the sore skin near the cleft. His thumb traced over the swollen rim, feeling a wave of remorse for the harsh punishment he’d meted out.
Tony brought his palm down on his left bottom cheek, causing Steve to gasp in surprise. “I asked a question,” he said. He brought his palm down on his right cheek too. No favourites.
He did, spurting ribbons of come all over the flat planes of his stomach. Tony followed soon after, his warm release coating his insides.
Exhausted, Steve lay in bed, trying to catch his breath. Tony wiped him with a towel, rinsing it in a washbasin, as he cleaned the drying tears and sweat from his beautiful face. He went over the rest of his body, memorising the feel of each plane and curve, while he removed all the traces of sweat and come. The red marks on his bottom would fade in a week or so, but hopefully, Steve would remember him for longer than that.
Steve fucked him through his orgasm and then some, as Tony peeked at his flushed face from under heavy eyelids. Finally, with a loud grunt and a shudder, Steve spilled his own load, while his knot inflated and locked them together.
Tony smiled back at the grinning young man. How little had changed. How much sway he still held over him despite the passage of time. He wouldn’t be the first nor the last king to bring a dynasty to a close, all for a pretty face. But, at least, he would be doing it on his own terms.
Tony nodded in approval, rewarding the young man by licking a broad stripe from the base of his throat to his jaw, noting smugly how the flush on Steve’s cheeks spread down his neck all the way to the top of his chest. Taking his time, Tony kissed his cheek, his ears, the neck, mouthing his collarbones till he came to the dip of his neck. By the time he reached the neckline of Steve's vest, the young man was panting heavily, his eyes glazed.
Abruptly, he turned the other way, not wanting the younger man to see the tears in his eyes. Steve shifted to lie on his side, holding Tony and nuzzling his back, pressing his hardness against Tony as he softly kissed his neck.
He’d turned away, too upset to speak to the younger man, who finally realised he’d gone too far. Steve had tried to atone for his careless words, begging forgiveness with his arms around Tony and kisses on his neck.
Keeping his fingers deep in inside, he picked up the pace, shaking his hand as Steve panted quickly, his soft moans turning to strained grunts. “ Ah! Ah! Please please please please please please please oh Tony so close so close so close.”
Blue eyes widened with understanding as Tony climbed off, watching the young man pull his vest over his head and slide his shorts off.
Tony had his reasons for putting it off, the obvious one being that he had no wish to hurt his precious wildling. More importantly, he knew this was a last resort. If punishment as harsh as this failed to break his spirit, then nothing ever would.
Steve could only nod his head, too far down to speak. Lining the tip of his cock with Steve’s hole, Tony pushed, slipping in easily due to the extensive preparation. It was warm and tight and clenching around him in a way that felt like heaven. Tony would stay buried in Steve forever if he could, but his bossy lover was rocking his hips, pleading, demanding that he move.
“Yep,” Tony admitted. He really was, despite his promise. But that was before he found out how his parents had died. He forced himself to swallow the food in his mouth, which had turned sour at the mention of that name.
He made sure to leave the shield on his side of the bed, so that Steve would see it the next morning. The next time they met, they would be foes. Tony could never hurt him again, after all that he’d done. And if Steve chose to raise his shield and crush him where it would hurt most, it wouldn’t matter.
Tony considered the strange creature. How he longed to tame the wild beast, for the boy to sit at his feet and eat from his hand. Yet, his beauty lay in his straight back, the proud lift of his head, the wild look in his eyes. It was something he’d always known - a wild stallion's free spirit was part of his charm. Taming one went against the course of nature. Keeping one would be a sin.
Tony rolled over, and lifted his legs to relieve the pressure on his stinging bottom. He was just in time to see his already-shirtless husband slipping his jeans and underwear down his hips to free his own hard cock, which was red and leaking at the tip.
“I’ll read you the list. You stole from me. You damaged my property. You hurt my men. But worst of all, you were trying to run from me, without even a word of goodbye.”
Tony gazed at his sweet, loving husband, and wondered where the feral alpha from a moment ago had disappeared to. “Want no one else,” he promised as he pulled Steve right back into his arms.
Tony had laughed, humoured by his childish attempt at seduction but Steve had huffed angrily, his pride bruised. Tony swiftly returned the kiss, claiming his lips to keep his young lover from leaving his side. It had been wonderful. And he had been euphoric, thrilled, that months of pining had given way to something resembling romance.
The boy looked at his eyes, his face, searching it closely for a sign of weakening resolve. “ Tony, you’re a good king. You’re kind and fair to your people and you really do care about us. But what happens after you? You have no heirs,” the boy pointed out. “Times are changing. The monarchy is over. Besides, a crown suits you ill. One day, you should give it up, let the people choose someone who wants to rule, someone who would find it their calling.”
“Never said I didn’t love you,” Steve argued. “Said I couldn’t give you my heart. There is a difference.”
“Legs apart,” Tony said and Steve shuffled his legs further, grateful for the cold air providing some sort of relief for his burning boypussy.
In all the ways that counted, the war was over. And the accords would make everything official. After they were signed, the people could hold their elections, select a more qualified person to lead them.
It was true. In this crazy world of theirs, there was no one else Tony would rather have for a mate.
Steve’s eyes flew open and he breathed shallowly through his parted lips. “You wouldn’t hurt me. I just – I just want to feel you,” he gasped, his voice a desperate whisper.
They had been fighting. Steve was talking about Athens, and their successes, extolling the merits of a democracy. And Tony had been hurt, offended even, at how passionate he was about having him replaced.
Tony didn’t particularly care for hurting him, much preferring to spoil him with sweet treats, life’s luxuries and his soft touch. But the soft approach had yielded no results and he’d exhausted all other means of taming the wild colt, who remained thoroughly unbroken despite a whole year in his keep.
“The Duke of Columbia. My uncle. Lord Pierce,” he gasped. He should have seen this coming. His uncle's rule as regent. The secret meetings. The clandestine looks. The accidents. The close shaves. They were beginning to make sense now.
Steve started at the base, sucking lightly at his balls as he licked at them. He moved slowly, licking broad stripes up and down Tony’s length before closing his mouth over Tony’s head. Tony watched, drunk on arousal, as Steve bobbed up and down on his cock, his cheeks hollow from sucking and his pink lips swollen around his girth. Steve kept at it a long time, but soon he began to tire, choking softly when he couldn’t keep up with Tony’s pace, tiny tears rolling down his flushed cheeks as he worshipped his cock.
Steve raised an eyebrow and pinned him down with his gaze. “Oh, as long as it’s just this once,” he said. “Because I think some discipline is overdue. Can’t have you running around with random alphas, forgetting to whom you belong.”
Tony watched, open-mouthed and slack-jawed, as Steve took down three more guards, one of whom was about to plunge his knife into Tony’s chest. Tony knew Steve was strong and able. He could tell from the way his muscles rippled, from the effortless way he carried Tony to bed. But out here, he was in his element - beautiful, powerful.
With another flick of his wrist, he slapped the pink bud again, and again, barely pausing between strokes to build a rhythm, not unlike the beat of war drums, as the rigid crop marched up and down the valley of dusk. A king, he would conquer anything and anyone that stood in the way of his prize.
A horizontal stripe appeared near the top of the rebel's hindquarters, over tender flesh from a long day of hard riding. Without giving the boy time to catch his breath, he lay another right below the first stroke, this time drawing a gasp. He would move downwards, striking with accuracy, searing that fine meat with perfectly parallel grill marks.
Tony pulled out and smacked the impatient young man in the middle of his bottom. “Behave,” he ordered sternly, as he spanked him several times more. “Or I'll tie you to a tree and leave you there all night.”
“We lay low. Try not to get killed. Fury is cleaning house as we speak. Then, the accords. The monarchy is over, but nobody wants to see you gone. We need you, Tony, as an advisor, a minister. You can even run for president if you want,” he added, only half-joking.
“You look good,” Tony said, to the young man by his feet, whose face turned a pretty shade of pink. He gazed upon the bruised knuckles, resisting the urge to kiss them, not that he could, still tied to a chair. Steve was quiet, focused on his task, so Tony let him be, trying to slow down his own breathing, hoping the younger man wouldn’t hear the violent pounding of his heart.
He lay on the same pillow, rubbing his face into it to inhale their mixed scents. He’d take it to his own bed as a memento. Better still, he might move into the boy’s room after, and pretend his lover was still here, that nothing had changed.
Steve was writhing, his thighs quaking from holding his position. “Anywhere you want,” he gasped. “I’ll go anywhere with you.”
He had rung up an extensive list of offences: Theft of his horse, his sword and the royal seal; Property damage to one of the castle’s walls. To top it off, he’d maimed at least three guards when they attempted to restrain him. It was treason of the highest order. Men had been hung for far less than that. The good thing about being king was he got to decide that it was the petty sort - little acts of naughtiness, which could be addressed privately in the bedroom.
By the time he was done, the boy had stopped struggling, his loud cries of protests subsiding into broken sobs, his pink bud swelling like the soft petals of a blooming rose.
Tony positioned his feet on either side of his head, looking directly down at his spread legs. The belt came down across his cheeks without any warning and Steve yelped. Then, the strokes rained down on him, soft caresses soon turning into firm lashes, which built up quite a sting.
Steve smiled, mounting his steed and beckoning Tony to follow. They travelled half a day, only stopping once for a drink before fleeing through the dense vegetation. Tony could barely see the path ahead, so he focused on keeping up with the younger man, who weaved his way through the trees with ease.
“Enjoy the spa treatment,” Tony said, laughing at his own joke as Steve whimpered around the handle of the crop.
“Sorry about all this,” Steve said, gesturing vaguely to just about everything. “I know this is kind of rough.”
They never counted. Tony would strike him as much as he thought was necessary. Occasionally, he paused, long enough for Tony to run his fingers over his battered bottom or to put his hand between his legs, fondling his cock and balls, keeping him in a constant state of arousal.
“Probably,” Steve huffed. “But first, they have to catch me. Backup will arrive tomorrow so we’ve only got to lay low till then,” Steve explained as he dragged him behind a large tree at the sound of footsteps.
Steve had endured the crop, several times, on his boy bits. Tony thought it was the perfect cure for impertinence.  He still remembered the way it burned.
A wave of sympathy washed over him as he listened to his pained cries. It was the rebel's nature to be defiant. That was exactly why he’d joined the revolution, idealistic and naïve that their uprising would stand a chance against his armed forces.
It wasn’t an unusual punishment. Applying the crop to a boy’s tender hole was widely considered an effective method of discipline. Even young princes like Tony hadn’t been spared during his formative years.
Steve did, lying on his back so Tony could see his flushed face and heaving chest. Tony straddled his hips, sweeping Steve’s long bangs to one side. Placing a kiss in the middle of Steve’s forehead, he whispered. “My dear, headstrong boy. So clever and determined. Always a way out with you. Mine,” he said, kissing the spot again.
“Yes,” Tony gasped, and a giggle escaped his lips when Steve pressed his warm mouth against his neck and sucked. “What are you doing?”
Preoccupied with the safe return of his lover, punishment had been the farthest thing from his mind. Quite frankly, all Tony wanted to do was to hold him and kiss him and tell him he was forgiven, but that wouldn’t sit well with the other generals. After all, it had been their men that the boy had wounded in his escape. Stane would have very much liked a public display, perhaps shoving the boy atop the wooden pony, a cruel mockery of his failed escape. If not that, then, at the very least, they would have demanded a beating as recompense for their men’s suffering.
“Yes, I gave you my word,” the man said, before hurrying over to undo the ropes, slicing through them with a small knife.
Tony thought they would be over that by now. The boy had promised to stay. He’d pledged this loyalty to him. Tony liked to think that he had finally become accustomed to palace life and fond of Tony’s company. But at times like these, Tony had to confront the bitter truth - that he had only offered himself in exchange for the freedom of his comrades - Barnes, Wilson, Romanova. It was no coincidence that he’d tried to escape the day after fresh plans to pursue said rebels had been approved.
jobs. Bodies were falling to the ground in loud thuds accompanied by the whizzing and clanging of a metallic object. And Tony couldn’t help wondering if the commotion had anything to do with his predicament.
Tony laughed and began to move his hips, sliding his cock in and out of Steve's warm channel. Steve’s eyes flew open as he looked at him reverently, in adoration. His eyes were glazed and his face was flushed, lips red and swollen from biting down on them. As Tony drove his cock over the sweet spot over and over again, he could see his young cock throbbing, bouncing on his stomach from the violent thrusts as the young man moaned his pleasure into the quiet night.
“Did you miss me?” Steve asked, and Tony searched his memory, trying to remember if the confident young man had ever sounded quite so nervous and unsure. Yet, here he was, arms around him and waiting for an answer.
The kiss was slow and soft, comforting in its familiarity, but the fact that they were out in the forest, at one with nature, sent a thrill down Tony's spine.
Tony sat up with the kneeling man, kissing his temple and his nape. He let his fingers dance across the lean muscles of his back, stroking the smooth skin of his lovely, round ass.
Tony froze, freeing Steve’s cock from his mouth. He looked at him in concern. “No, my love. It will hurt. I don’t want to hurt you anymore.”
Tony scrambled to comply with the long list of demands, and spread his knees as far as he could. Large, warm hands were soon on his cheeks and pulling them apart to inspect his slick, wet hole.
“I’m sorry,” the boy said, his soft voice barely a whisper. “I wasn’t trying to hurt anyone. I didn’t want to hurt you.”
With a heavy heart, Tony picked up the riding crop and passed it in front of his unruly young colt, whose eyes widened momentarily in spite of the brave face he put on. Tony had to place one hand on the small of his back, patting him gently to calm him down. With his other hand, he lifted his chin with the leather tip of the crop, forcing the boy to meet his gaze.
about it, but the damage couldn't be forgotten, couldn't be unlearned. Tony couldn't expose himself like that. Stark men knew better.
In fact, the SRA draws on a little-known sociological hierarchy proposed by Stanford professor Holly Yang. Dr. Yang's taxonomic system was first set down in a 1996 paper called
"Someone's cracking my system. You're the only person other than me who understands enough about what Extremis did to me to make that happen, but you're playing jailbird. They haven't let you near a computer since you slipped into that little orange number you're wearing. I checked. So tell me, Maya,
He takes a step onto the grass and halts there, caught in a chiaroscuro between the shadows of the Mansion and the diffuse sunlight of late afternoon. Something hits Cap like a shock; Tony can read it in his face. It's a realization:
"Your problem," Tony counters, "is that you can only frame things in the context of your own worldview. It's always optimist or pessimist, cynic or idealist. I'm neither of those things. I'm a realist. A futurist. I don't deal in wishful thinking. I deal in what
Tony wants to say something flippant. The next logical leap, he wants to say; you saw this coming; how it is different from the artificial heart or the fully-self-aware software suite or the cybernetic control arrays? But he knows how it's different. It's different because he tipped his hand. Steve never saw the artificial heart. There were no external consequences. Extremis, though, is written into every line of Tony's body, in his every interaction with the world, from the gold undersheath to his exquisite command of the external suit modules to the lack of scar tissue on his skin.
Dugan's telling the truth, but if Tony had to lay money, he'd lay money on Maria Hill, who is every bit as much a bastard as Fury. They won't stop looking for her; his personal regard for her aside, Tony never wanted and never asked to be made director precisely because he's aware of his tendency to abuse positions of power when he manages to seize them. Agreeing to work for SHIELD at all was a too-late overture, a desperate grasp at a check-and-balance system that never really did much to balance him in the first place. And more importantly, Hill was far more suited to the position. Tony had never had any intention of taking the job from someone who executed her duties with such extreme competence.
So Tony runs his security checks, he drinks his espresso, he wanders in his underwear and undershirt into the palatial bedroom that could pass for a ballroom and the grand closet that could pass for a bedroom.
And then Friday breaks in. "Avengers alert, priority one," she says. "Breakout at Ryker's Island." She throws a report up on the window; one of the news stations already has a helicopter on the scene, although they won't for long if they keep circling that close to Graviton. "Instigator unknown."
