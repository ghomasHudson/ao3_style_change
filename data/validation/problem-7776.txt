Tony took a breath. “Know that everything I’m going to tell you now has also been told to me. I can’t say with one hundred percent certainty that it all happened just like that. But I trust the people who gave me that information.” Tony shrugged.
"Only for those who deserve." Tony winked at him.
- after what seemed like eternity, they managed to enter the police station, and the silence inside the building was almost deafening.
Tony looked at his cup, now empty. “And yet, you asked me to come in.”
Steve’s touch, his hands holding Tony that firmly did things to Tony’s body by sending blood and everything Tony had to his groin. Tony wanted Steve to continue to hold his waist
They were passing by a rustic road of beaten sand, surrounded by incredibly green trees and colorful plants. It was cool, but very damp, and even with the air conditioning on, Tony already felt the effects of the heat in excess. And, for their luck - or not -, there was no rain forecast for that weekend.
"What feeling?" Tony was numb.
Tony swallowed. There it was. So that’s where the hoax ended, isn’t it? Because up to that point they were simply pretending that everything was fine, that they were still friends, that nothing had changed. But everything was different. Everything had been turned upside down. Nothing was as it was before and Steve remembered.
“Tomorrow,” Steve replied in a voice that was far, almost asleep and content. “We can shower together.”
the day before, damn it. Why couldn’t I call you?” Tony laughed bitterly. “Pepper called Rhodes and Maria Hill and they gave a summary as detailed as possible of everything that had happened. Honestly, I don’t know what shocked and hurt me the most, knowing that we had fought over something as stupid as a law - I kept wondering why we hadn’t sat down to talk and solve it - and how was it possible for you to be dead. I had never, in any of my predictions, seen you dying. Never. That had never been a possible scenario. And there it was,” Tony spread his arms, pointing at Steve, as if to prove his point. “The stuffing of the story I got by myself, watching countless security videos, reading my own files, and asking Reed a few other things,” Tony took the last sip of his coffee, placed the cup delicately on the kitchen island and looked at Steve. “There. Now you know what happened to me while you were gone.”
“I mean that when I smelled that flower, there was a reason why
Tony switched on the stove, picked up the frying pan in the cupboard, and left it warm as he turned on the coffee machine and watched the grains being milled at once. The smell of coffee filled the air and Tony returned to the eggs, which were quickly ready, along with the bacon.
Steve smiled beautifully. “You loved me back.”
“I'll call them, okay? Just wait a minute.” Natasha got up and a few seconds later the door to the room where Tony and Steve were standing opened revealing the spy.
“Fuck, Steve! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Yes, oh, yes, oh, yes. That’s- oh,
“Friday, what do you see?” Tony asked the A.I.
“How did you know I was out there?” It was eating Tony alive. He hadn’t many things he was proud of in his life, but his inventions were certainly some exceptions. If one failed, what was the purpose?
“You. I want you,” Steve said looking deep into Tony’s eyes.
Tony narrowed his eyes.
"If I beat you, you let me throw a birthday party for you and you'll love every second of it."
"I love watching you sing." Steve said quietly, and Tony was afraid he'd have imagined it.
about something that big.”
“Boyfriend?” He tasted the word. It tasted new, unlike anything else, and just like Steve's kiss, it was good. More than good, delicious, and fit perfectly. “Boyfriend.”
asked for.
“It was delicious.”
“My conscience was still alive. The problem is, the
"I hope I qualify," Tony said. "You're gonna have to help me, Steve.”
Tony shrugged. “I was afraid.”
“And we're sorry for that,” Steve said. “But give us a chance. We were there, on the other side of that wall, and all Tony wanted most was to come across it to hold you and say that everything's going to be all right now.” He stopped short because he heard himself screaming. It wasn’t fair they suddenly feel that huge feeling for that girl and be pushed away without even take the chance to say it to her.
“I know, I know,” she said, her hands raised defensively. “But it was the best I could think of. You can fight with me later, but now you have to go there.” She was tired, her expression low and with dark circles under her eyes. It mustn’t have been easy to deal with that whole thing, Tony thought.
"Thank you." He looked at Bucky and held out his hand. "How’s it going, Bucky?"
“You’re thinking too loud, Tony.” Steve smiled warmly and ran his finger between Tony’s eyes, undoing a frown of concern that Tony hadn’t even realized had formed. “You’re worrying about things that don’t need a formula or preparation in advance. You don’t have to be the futurist now. Let things happen, Shellhead.” Steve grinned. “Remember what I told you yesterday?”
"I don't even wanna know why that came out, but if you want it to be like that, whatever," Tony facepalmed. Once again, he thought he had spoken to himself, but his own mouth betrayed him.
"The detective who handled the case from the start was waiting for a transfer to Maine to be closer to his family," Rhodes explained. "His wife had gotten a better job over there and Ross helped him getting there too. He left to Maine and left his last case open, and
Steve smiled kindly and wiped an insolent tear that was streaming down Tony’s face, and that corroded Tony inside. “It’s already gone. It’s over.” Steve squeezed Tony’s arms lightly, reaffirming that everything was fine. “I died and came back. You have lost part of your memory, the most painful, according to yourself. It seems obvious what we have to do here.”
“So, we're not even number one on your list?” Tony was offended. They were the Avengers, damn it. The Earth's mightiest heroes, for god's sake. And they were at the bottom of the list of potential protectors for a damn box.
He still wasn't sure why he had accepted Steve's offer. It wasn’t normal, not at all common, for something like this to happen.
Tony nodded and turned to Strange, who was waiting patiently. “Very well, Strange. We'll take care of your box while you take your vacation and you owe us a favor. Anything, no matter when.” Tony smiled crookedly. Two could play that game.
answered.”
"For lucky," he said as he pulled away.
As if out of a trance, Clint, Thor, and Natasha began to move toward the fountain. The sky was already almost completely taken up by the night darkness, and Lincoln Center began to light up magnificently in shades of yellow and orange, casting languid shadows on the walls of the theaters. The fountain, as if waiting for the Avengers to approach it to admire its beauty, brightened brightly, and for a moment it looked more like a fire pit with dancing flames than a fountain.
maybe? Or the part of me and you being
"If you were supposed to know, Merida, we wouldn’t have whispered, would we?” Tony said, finishing the slice of pizza in his hand.
“Only you to joke at a time like this.”
"Do your final exams tomorrow and then we'll have the whole summer," Tony winked.
“I want you more than anything. I can tell you all the yeses you want.” Tony couldn’t take it anymore. “So, do you forgive me?”
"That's a good list," Tony said. "I don’t think you forgot anyone.”
"Yeah, pretty much," Steve agreed. "I want you to be comfortable here."
Tony smiled, suddenly shy. Steve reached up to cup Tony's cheek and caressed it with his thumb.
Steve looked at him.
to wait. I wanted to understand what had happened, I wanted to help you and ...” Steve hesitated. He exhaled, resigned. “I also wanted you to help me. The two of us coming back from the dead? What are the chances?” Steve let out a sad laugh. “But I had to leave, I had to leave you there with Strange, hoping for the best, praying that you would come back. I wish that we could talk and do what we are doing now, but there, at that moment. I ...” Steve looked away, suddenly unsure of what to say.
"It's ten minutes to midnight, boss.”
Arching his body, Tony came in Steve's mouth with a cry. Taking everything that Tony gave to him, without dropping a single drop, Steve released Tony's cock and admired Tony's figure, lying on the counter, wide-eyed, panting, his hair a total mess, his face glistening with sweat, and an expression of pure pleasure in his eyes and face.
"Is the plane ready, Happy?" Tony asked.
Tony blinked and took his hand from Steve's shoulder, which remained motionless. Hulk approached them.
He looked for the right pans, turned on the stove, put the potatoes to cook in one of the pots. Meanwhile, he started to prepare the fillets. The temptation to make just one serving for him was great, but he was not alone in that house. In fact,
"Tony, please." She grimaced in disgust. "That's me you're talking to.”
Steve frowned. “Forgive you for what?”
Steve smirked.
"And you should take care of your life."
Steve smiled, but kept his eyes closed.
This time, when the repulsors started, he didn’t hesitate for a second.
Steve narrowed his eyes, but said nothing. This was a battle won for Tony and Tony knew the soldier knew.
Suddenly, something clicked into Steve. “Was it something
And the ship vanished into thin air as the last wall of the laboratory exploded.
“Hey, hey. Tony. Tony.” Steve’s voice was close. Very close. “Tony, look at me.”
“Start where you think it’s easier,” Steve said, bending down to pick up his own underwear, lying on the floor nearby, and putting it on.
"Fifteen minutes until the appointed time to meet with Captain Rogers."
Steve stopped before picking up one of the glasses and stared at Tony, who smiled behind the coffee mug. This was an inside joke of their own. The whole country knew that the Fourth of July, the national date, was Captain America's birthday, and that coincidence every year generated a commotion. What no one seemed to remember was that the Fourth of July was also Steve Rogers' birthday, the man under the mask. And Tony made a point of teasing Steve every year, until the other started not to care anymore, but to have fun with the teasing.
“Of course, as if we could all jump in a 160-feet elevator shaft as if the ground were jelly.”
“And why didn’t that make the front page of newspapers?” Steve asked and Tony cringed when he heard the acidity in his voice. Steve was disappointed. No. Disappointed was an understatement. Steve was hurt, and Tony agreed with him, but he just couldn’t feel the remorse he should have. The memories that were supposed to make that happen weren’t there.
Tony's guts clenched and he moaned. “You're
Natasha smiled slightly.
“No, I won't judge you. But you need to believe me, okay?”
Steve snorted. “Tony-”
Tony's mouth watered.
With a great effort and feeling his undersuit start getting uncomfortable where his cock grew hard without his permission with every thought he also didn’t authorize about Steve… about Steve sucking Tony’s neck, leaving marks, marking Tony as his possession, going down to his nipples, teasing them with his hot tongue, driving Tony crazy…
should’ve been more honest from the start and said what was in that box. Maybe if you had said 'hey, there’s this flower inside that’ll make you want to fuck your teammate for almost 24 hours if you smell it' I wouldn’t have done anything.” Tony frowned at Strange.
"As much as I want to stay here and finish you off with more matches, I have a trip booked and Happy is here to take me to the jet. But can we finish this one here?”
"It's good to come back to the routine," Wanda smiled and snapped her fingers.
Just for a moment.
Tony ignored the confusion and headed straight for his huge, potent coffee machine to pour himself a generous mug of hot coffee. That was all he needed to recover his energies and clear his ideas. Tony Stark's fuel was good old caffeine. He had finished his first mug without even realizing that he had taken it all in one breath.
Steve nodded. “When we arrived, you were barely hanging on, completely unconscious, but Pepper didn’t tell us all the why. I know now. But at the time, she simply asked us to save you, because all the other steps in your instructions had already been followed. Only our part, mine and Thor’s was missing.”
"You forgot the focused part," she answered without hesitation. “Midnight. Don’t be late.”
“Agent Romanoff asked to not be disturbed, boss.”
"Fine, if you say so," Tony said with a small smile.
No. Tony didn’t see Steve die. He wasn’t there. “They shot you, they took tests. You were
Tony heard his voice increase, but he didn’t care. How could he not know that?
"Enough to know the waitress' name and have a regular order."
Tony laughed through his nose. “Sometimes I think you have no idea how big you are for other people.” He held up his hand, interrupting Steve before he started. “I know what you’re going to say. I know you never wanted any of this. I know you only do what you think is right and blah blah blah. But you need to accept who and what you are for us.”
“So what's the problem?”
“You don't have to do this.” Tony tried to protest, but the attempt came out weak, as he watched Steve prepare materials to take care of Tony’s dislocation.
Tony and Thor landed in front of Clint and Steve with no apparent scratches. The faceplate of the armor opened revealing Tony's face.
"What about the energy signature?" Clint asked. "Where is it coming from?"
Tony lifted his head and ran his hand through his hair, exhausted.
“Thanks.” Steve smiled and took a step forward, a tiny step, but enough to keep them so close that Tony could count the green spots that mixed with the blue of his eyes. “But why do I have a feeling you’re not telling me the whole truth?” Steve slid his hands down Tony’s arm and his warm hands found Tony’s, which were freezing. The contrast made Tony shiver.
This chapter is here for us to know who are the side characters, what they do, and how exactly they are related to Steve and Peter.
Tony stopped to pay attention.
Tony and Steve exchanged a look and laughed.
And there, Tony had no more doubts.
“Speaking of which,” Tony looked around. “Where’s Steve?”
"Won’t hurt us, Nat."
Steve was silent, just watching Tony, his face no longer as friendly as before. Tony had screwed everything up, of course. But Steve deserved to know everything. Tony had already lost Steve once, he had some memory missing, and he had no friends. What else did he have to lose? When it became clear that Steve would let him continue, Tony took another sip of coffee and took a breath.
It could be the bizarre timezone effect, or the many hours of sleep finally slept, or it could be Tony simply allowing himself to tell the truth out loud when he eventually shrugged and smiled back at Natasha.
"I asked Friday if you had plans for after poker,” Steve's neck turned red and Tony couldn’t help but smile. “And she told me about the trip. How many days?”
"Rest," Tony said, wrapping an arm around Steve's waist. "And don’t worry about anything. The zero communication rule is already on.”
“To what?”
"You know he's innocent and you're doing everything in your power to help your son get out of there," Tony fought the urge to hold Steve's hand over the table. "I'm here to help. And that's what I'm doing. I promise. We'll get your son out of there and we will prove that he's innocent."
"Apologize?" Rhodes frowned, not understanding.
To his surprise, Steve called, putting his eight chips on the table, followed by Natasha, who did the same, closing the betting round.
“You watched it,” Tony said, hoping Steve didn’t know what he was talking about.
Tony looked at Steve.
did this to me. I wanna know I’m feeling
” Steve stopped abruptly when he realized what he had said out loud.
good.
They looked at each other for a long moment. When it was clear that Steve wasn’t joking, Tony shrugged. “
“I'm sorry.” Steve held up his hands apologetically. “I didn’t mean to offend you.”
Tony released Steve's face and, with a wink, stood up.
"Please tell me there's pepperoni pizza somewhere in this stack." Tony pointed to a huge stack of boxes on the kitchen counter.
The guests - only their closest friends – broke out in cheers and celebrations to the new couple, the now named Stark-Rogers.
Eight seconds later, the four of them were outside the A.I.M. base beside the Hulk, watching a large cloud of black smoke and flaming wreckage falling on the ground.
“And second, if that person could handle it, their antidote would have to be extremely accurate, potent and, I would say, perfectly tailored for that person. There is no other way to get rid of so much pollen so quickly and effectively. But all of this, of course, hypothetically.” Strange looked from Steve to Tony.
“Did you have an epiphany here this morning?” Steve asked, his voice full of curiosity.
“Yes, you can,” Steve came over and kissed him, because he simply could. Tony responded with enthusiasm, squeezing Steve’s cheeks and enjoying the moans that made his whole body vibrate. Steve pulled away to take a breath and ran the side of Tony’s neck slowly with wet kisses, ending with a hickey where the neck and collarbone met. Tony sighed loudly and tightened his arms around Steve, running his fingers down his back, pressing his body against Steve’s, trying to reach any piece of skin he could get with his mouth, because he needed to taste Steve.
"Well, if I'm bored, I just need to look for the most handsome man at the party and remember how lucky I am to have him in my life," Steve looked at Tony, his eyes intense. "And goodbye boredom.”
“When?”
Steve’s eyes took in his whole vision and they were distressed, looking all over Tony’s face looking for something, trying to help. Tony wanted to say that it wasn’t his fault. Steve couldn’t control the fact that he was who he was, the most incredible, generous, funny person in a unique, sensitive way, and perfect in every way that Tony could think of, even in the flaws. Tony was the crooked vase there, the wrong piece. He just couldn’t say it. His throat was closed, his eyes filled with tears. He shook his head, trying, in one last effort, to tell Steve that it was a futile effort to reach him. Tony was hopeless.
"Give it up, Fury," Clint said, turning an arrow between his fingers. "When Tony decides to get stuck in his cave, no one can get him out if he doesn’t want to."
Tony shook his head, tears falling again. No, he was no good. Nobody good needs to erase their own memory after having helped install chaos. Tony was a weed, a cute plant, but one that can destroy everything if not controlled.
They were all settling into the Quinjet after a long, but not very serious, fight against the remotely controlled robots of Victor Von Doom, the ruler of Latveria known as Doctor Doom. No one was seriously injured, only with a few scratches and blows that soon would turn purple, and all covered with soot and dust from the rubble where the robots fell.
“And why don't you protect the box yourself?” Natasha asked. “Put one of your spells on it and that's it.” She shrugged.
Tony frowned. What question was that? Why was Steve asking that? It didn’t make sense. Everyone knew he didn’t remember everything ... Then a light went on in Tony’s head.
“Tony, what’re you doing?” Steve asked, as he tried to untangle Tony's arms from his neck, to no avail. Steve then tried to push Tony away by holding him firmly around the waist and that's when Tony groaned. But not in pain.
"I'm about to go out for a whole weekend with Steve Rogers, Friday.”
“Is that the name of that place?”
“If they are as good leaders as my parents were in leading the Avengers of my Earth, I'm sure we'll get along.” She smiled.
Silence.
Tony shook his head, still not really understanding.
With a superhuman effort, Tony broke away from Steve and walked away. “Forgive me, Steve,” he said, stumbling over his own words and feet as he walked backwards towards the corridor he had entered. “Forgive me, really.”
each other. No wonder you didn’t come apart after that kiss on the dance floor.” She smiled at him. “It was one of the most beautiful scenes I've ever seen.”
"Of course, you can have fifteen minutes.”
Tony's smile disappeared. "He knows what he needs to know."
“God bless America," Tony said with a small smile.
"Have you talked to all your guests yet?" He asked Steve.
Thanks for reading!
He wanted to be the one that Steve would return to, the one that Steve would spend the day thinking about returning to, because Tony would be the one who’d make all the weight go off his back and make him smile when he arrived. Tony wanted to be everything Steve needed and he wanted to be the one Steve could always count on, to be the safe haven Steve had always been for him. Tony could be all that, right? Even without memory, even if he was full of flaws, even though he knew he’d never reach Steve’s perfection, he could still be there for Steve, right?
Tony froze in place. Panicking, he looked at his hands and then checked the status of the armor on the display. Everything was in order; he was practically invisible. Still, very slowly, he turned back toward Steve’s building and there he was, looking in the direction Tony was in, missing by a few inches. Tony turned up the volume of the external sounds to accurately capture everything Steve said, but left his own speaker on mute. He still wasn’t sure what was going on there.
"For me, no problem," Sam shrugged. "You have to ask him if he'll hitchhike."
Steve blinked a few times, returning to focus. "Sure. I'm going to park," Steve maneuvered the car in the nearest spot, turned off the engine and, without ceremony, rested his head on the steering wheel and took a deep breath.
“Boss?” Friday called and Tony jumped out of his chair.
Steve activated his monitor and three smaller screens appeared, showing the three portals.
“The whole first floor was evacuated, boss. All the remaining agents are in the basement.”
know what’s happening here.”
“I called you my honey bun. I'm sorry, it was impulsive...”
Tony thought,
“How?” Steve asked quietly.
“Me and you, we tried to talk.” Steve was looking at Tony. “Before things really got worse during the War, we met at the Mansion and talked.”
“Steve, darling?” Tony called.
"But their house was left open so that the crime scene could be investigated, because that's where they found the body."
"We're here," Happy announced, "Pierre is waiting for you inside.”
"This," Steve released Tony's hand and unhurriedly slid his fingers all over the exposed part of Tony's arm, making him shiver.
Steve gave a sad little smile, as if he expected something else. “Me too,” he took a sip of coffee and composed himself. “And what happened to
“I trust you, do whatever you want, remember?” Steve said. “I can’t catch anything. Besides, what else worse than smelling sex-pollen for you I could do?”
"Hey, gorgeous," Tony called out. Steve looked at him. "A dollar for your thoughts."
“Hi, Nick, enjoying the party?”
Strange sighed heavily and rolled his eyes, but said nothing. That was Tony Stark after all. He shrugged and turned to open one of his light portals. That was when he stopped. And that’s when Steve knew that everything had blown up.
“But I know.”
"Hey, handsome." Tony stopped short and an impertinent smile came into the corner of his mouth.
"No need to thanks," the spy waved back.
infected.” He hugged Steve and pulled him close.
“Could you say that again, a little louder this time? I forgot to ask Jarvis to record it for me to use it as the ringtone on my Starkphone.”
Steve had panic dropping from his words.
Tony laughed through his nose. “Yeah, maybe. But this is what I want people out there to know about me. It’s worked very well. They continue to believe. But the truth?” Steve nodded in agreement. Tony smiled. “The truth is that I was always just a guy, alone, walking along a long and lonely road. I’ve walked fast, I’ve been very slow. I reached the rock bottom of my life and came back bigger than the world ever thought to see me. I’ve given up hope and I’ve been bright light. Because, deep down, I always thought that, in the end, everything would always be the same, that everything would end the same.”
"I thought your gift was the party," Steve said with a frown.
"Have you already had any love problems?"
But in the end, it wasn’t.
him, even if at a distance and that that person happened to be someone who had gone to war with you, told you several lies, manipulated you, tried to kill you and, in the end, lost all memory about it trying to save what’s left of the friendship between you. An unsolicited and not well-liked guardian angel.
Steve too.
“Start? What are we starting with?” Tony asked, his heart hammering in his chest, threatening to wake the entire block.
Tony frowned. “I think you are the genius now, because nothing here is obvious to me.”
"You are a guest at the house of your current client, who was kind to provide you a room, although this is not very orthodox, I would say," Pepper said and Tony could hear her typing on a keyboard. "And if I were you, I would get up as fast as my anesthetized brain would allow me, because my extremely competent associate got a judge in Boston to sign Peter Rogers out of jail."
“What?”
Steve thought for a while, biting his lower lip and making Tony think a little more than he should have, going in ways not recommended for PG-13. No. Definitely, after seeing Steve bite his lip, Tony went on an exclusive route rated R, with huge NSFW signs.
That was the answer, wasn’t it? That was why. They both waited too long, the two of them denied too much, and the two of them almost lost each other forever. That was the turning point. Tony only took longer to realize. And to admit it for himself.
Tony looked at Steve and his look wasn’t terrified anymore. It was one of pure love and Steve's heart melted. “Yes.” Strange could say what he wanted. He could say it was wrong; he could say that Tony and Steve shouldn't be together; he could imply that the relationship they were building was a lie. Nothing mattered. Tony loved Steve, and Steve loved Tony. And that feeling didn't arise just because they smelled a flower.
"He's in custody, Mr. Rogers, charged with murder."
"Look, Steve, I know what it looks like, but I know it wasn't him. Peter would never do that."
“I think that’s why Peter began calling us the Avengers’ Mom and Dad,” Tony said, taking a sip of coffee.
“Did you get Natasha?” Bruce asked.
Tony narrowed his eyes.
time, that everyone there needed him, that
get rid of me again. Now you're going to talk to your guests. I'm going to have another scotch.”
Natasha then took the main deck again, discarded the first card from the top and opened three cards in the center of the table, a three of spades, a three of hearts and a ten of diamonds. Tony looked back at his two opening cards and cheered a little. With his three of diamonds plus three of spades and the three of hearts open at the table, he already had a three of a kind.
Tony thought giving the biggest smile he remembered. He stood on tiptoe and pulled Steve in for another kiss. As soon as their mouths met once more, Tony was sure of the answer.
Steve shrugged. “I had a lot of time to think while I relived those moments and after I came back. There’s no point in brooding over what happened, Tony. We learn from our mistakes. Let’s move on and keep an eye on each other so it doesn’t happen again.” Steve looked at his hand still opened in Tony’s direction. “You come with me? Shall we start over together? I want you so much with me.”
“Fuck me.”
The red tone from before came back up Steve's neck and Tony couldn’t help but think it was cute that the American boy scout would turn red with the names Tony was calling him.
The day passed without further surprises. The lunch prepared by Peter and Steve received rave reviews from everyone except Tony who didn’t come up for lunch and didn’t even show up in the communal area of the penthouse at any time of the day.
Tony opened the helmet and looked at Strange as if he were a two-headed dog. “Did
Tony finished cleaning Steve and himself, set the towel on the floor beside the bed, and crawled into the embrace Steve had opened for him. Steve turned around so they were facing each other, hugged him with his free arm, and Tony snuggled into the crook of his arm.
person. Otherwise, your condition may continue to get worse and may even be fatal, sir.” Jarvis sounded hesitant.
Tony tapped his forehead twice with his fingertips. “In here.”
“Yeah, I could notice that too. My blood, Jarvis. There has to be something, anything, that explains all of this coming up so suddenly.” Tony turned on the floor, let his arms fall limp, and stared at the ceiling, breathing hard and sweating cold.
Tony approached him and looked at the contents of the refrigerator once more, his eyes stopping at some potatoes.
Tony grabbed Steve’s hair to hold him in place and nuzzled his jaw to the base of his neck, coming up to his ears, to repeat everything over and over.
A shiver went up Tony's back. The elevator might not be the best place to be extremely horny in the company of the reason for such excitement.
"You drink?" Steve asked Tony.
Tony's thoughts had never been so incoherent as at that moment and he had never felt so numb and at the same time so extraordinarily alert and aware of every bit of his body being touched by Steve, how their tongues danced around each other, sipping each other's taste, how warm and soft Steve's skin was under his fingers, and how he'd never been so horny in his life.
“Correct.”
"What?"
And the weekend has finally arrived!
Tony turned to him.
Tony made an indignant noise with his mouth. "How absurd. Just because I prefer motorized vehicles it doesn't mean that I'm aversed to walking," Rhodes raised an eyebrow at him. Tony winced. "I'm going to make the sacrifice, but let it be recorded in the annals of posterity that I was against going by walking. I feel personally attacked."
I kept fighting because that was what I still had. Without you, without your smile, without your energy, without your constant presence, even if far away, I just needed to wait until I died too. I could wait. I deserved that torture. If I was there with you, maybe I could have stopped you from getting on that ship, or I could have gone with you.
“Yeah, there was that,” Tony agreed. “He also dismantled SHIELD and created HAMMER.” Tony chuckled. “The metaphor still makes me laugh. It was there, in everyone’s face, what he intended to exchange the protective shield we had for an offensive and dangerous hammer. But nobody seemed to care. Your death left a very big vacuum in terms of morality and common sense.” Tony looked deep into Steve’s eyes. “You were our compass. Without you, everything has lost its connection.”
"Great," Steve said. “Come here. We need to find Thor and Ares.”
“What do
"Can we meet here tomorrow morning?" Tony asked. “I have a very important appointment in New York and I really need to go back there tomorrow.”
Leaving his nipples, Tony kept coming down with his mouth by Steve’s body drawn to perfection and stopped when it reached just below the navel.
crazy about
With a superhuman effort, Tony broke away from Steve and walked away. “Forgive me, Steve,” he said, stumbling over his own words and feet as he walked backwards towards the corridor he had entered. “Forgive me, really.”
"And I make Steve happy," Tony thought.
"Olympus has fallen," Ares replied simply. "And as the new ruler of the Greek world, I am here to claim the Earth as part of my new domain.”
"Is this yours?" he asked Tony, who had his back to him, already walking down the front steps.
Steve stroked Tony's face and smiled.
“And what’s it?”
“Yes,” Natasha confirmed.
"You already thanked me being kind and offering me your own home for me to stay. You don't have to say anything else," Tony smiled and suddenly remembered something Steve had said. "Actually, there is something you need to say, yes."
Tony started to pull away, but Steve caught hold of the hand they held, holding him close. In a movement too fast for someone who was waking up, Steve pulled Tony back onto the bed and rolled to the side at the same time, facing Tony.
With a savage grunt, Steve went over to Tony and kissed him hard, without holding on, letting everything he had kept inside him, every year loving from a long distance, the frustration for the War that he fought for the principles he swore to protect, but that went against protecting the person he loved the most, for them finally having the courage to reveal their feelings for each other, all that, that whole dam had finally burst and nothing would be able to hold it back.
"I was watching you at the party yesterday, you know?"
"Your son is on trial for the murder of that boy, Steve," Tony said without emotion, but his eyes betrayed him. They were filled with pity. And compassion.
. I can only feel
he thought.
Tony thought.
“Where are the others?” Steve asked.
Sometime later, Steve quickly walked away to catch his breath and he smiled. “What’s it?” Tony asked, all disheveled and out of breath.
“And now?”
“Wait.” Tony had his hand on the doorknob. The two of them turned and saw Liz walk around the table to face them, with no obstacle between them. “What did you say?”
Tony blinked a few times, repeating the phrase mentally, afraid he might have heard it wrong. “What did you say?”
Tony felt his chest ache when he saw the shield against the door, strategically positioned. The last time he had seen that shiny disk had been a lifetime ago, a life that no longer belonged to him, when he visited Steve’s dead body.
him, even if at a distance and that that person happened to be someone who had gone to war with you, told you several lies, manipulated you, tried to kill you and, in the end, lost all memory about it trying to save what’s left of the friendship between you. An unsolicited and not well-liked guardian angel.
“That's what we'll see.”
"Is it possible that he knows about you and her and everything else and is just waiting for you to slip?" Rhodes said when they arrived at the corner of the police station.
replace any of them. But we promise to do our best if you allow us, honey bun.”
“Of course!” Tony said with a smile, “It shouldn’t take too long with Natasha.”
He could only think of that man on the roof of the building in front, who was thoughtful, looking at the stars, his face placid, his eyes shining, his golden hair almost white in the moonlight, and his lower lip accentuated forward. Steve looked so innocent there, but so lonely. Someone who had just been resurrected, after more than a year dead, must have been celebrating with many friends. But there he was, alone, lit by the moon, like a spotlight exclusive to him, accentuating the trait of Steve’s life that always hurt Tony the most: his inability to really fit. He never really looked happy, and Tony knew that because he was able to recognize Steve’s different types of humor. And genuinely happy was the rarest and most beautiful of them all.
“You alright?”
Tony blinked a few times to see clearly again and found himself clutching Steve's shoulders like he was his lifesaver. Tony paused to catch his breath and thought better of it.
That idea in Tony's mind was getting stronger.
"Yes, it's great. I'll finally get my hands on your son's prison papers and you'll be able to see him," Tony smiled. "It's now that things start to get interesting."
“You said yourself that it needs to be me. So do what you want with me, Tony. I'm yours.”
“What's it?” Tony asked.
Tony let go of Steve and crawled up to reach for the bedside table. He opened the single drawer, took the lube that was inside and returned to the middle of Steve's legs. While he thrusted Steve’s cock with one hand, he has greased his fingers, and with the first, he gently touched Steve's rim.
Steve didn't respond immediately. He thought about it, and Natasha waited, still smiling without showing her teeth. A snake ready to strike was the image that came to Tony's mind.
Steve cleared his throat, sitting up as well as he could and Tony saw his neck turning red. He looked around and found nine pairs of eyes watching them both.
Peter was sitting behind an aluminum table, his hands cuffed and tied to the table, his shoulders slumped, his brown hair messy and ruffled to all directions, his clothes rumpled, his face sunken, downcast, his eyes - always so alive smart and curious -, they were swollen, red and listless. Steve had never seen his son look so sad and the boy had already passed through his mother's funeral. Steve's soul ached for his son. He felt himself shrink and be as helpless as ever. He had no power there. He couldn't take those handcuffs off and get his son out of there. He couldn't take away that sadness and emptiness from the most important person in his life. He wasn't that powerful. He wanted it so much, but he still couldn't.
Steve has no idea he has become
Tony lay down on the floor again, and instinctively, his hand reached for his bulge and stroked it, even though he knew it would do no good. The problem was knowing that Steve was so close. The mere mention of his name rekindled Tony's desire in intense ways.
Steve laughed through his nose.
“I love him, Nat.”
“Oh, my God, Tony, your mouth-” Steve gasped when Tony pulled it out of his mouth and held it with his hand to focus on its head, which was already damp from precome. Tony salivated and pumped Steve’s cock a couple more times.
"Ares is the god of War, Witch," Thor said. "Nothing with him is friendly.”
Tony's arms slid down Steve's legs, mapping every muscle, every contour, until his hands found their way to his cock. Steve let out a groan. “Here,” Tony showed Steve his open palm. “Make it wet for me.”
He and Steve had already been around each other many times, fighting side-by-side, spending time together or with the rest of the team, but never before Tony's heart pounded as much as now. Never before his mouth was so dry. Never before he wanted to touch Steve back. Never before he wanted to ask Steve to stay.
Tony dismissed the warning with a gesture. “Yeah, yeah. That too.” He and Strange stared at each other for a long moment. “Is that all, Doctor? Or would you like to owe me one more favor?” Tony smiled wickedly.
Finally. The right words had been said, the feelings had been transcribed. It was finally time to admit and put a name on things. Because that was exactly how Tony felt. There it was.
"You sing while you work." Steve looked at him and his smile widened, smug.
Tony shifted uncomfortably in his chair and finished what was left of his sake in just one sip.
Steve had finished washing his hands and, without bothering to dry them, opened the fridge to take a selection of vegetables and put them all on the island to chop them.
The penthouse glowed softly enough for Tony to see the way from the elevator to the kitchen, where he went straight to the huge coffee machine and poured himself a mug of boiling coffee and took a sip without waiting for it to cool enough.
But all of Tony's incoherent thoughts silenced when Steve wrapped his cock with his huge, warm hand and slowly, started thrusting his length up and down.
“Yeah, I think so,” was what he ended up saying.
of those emotions.” Tony struggled with the words. “I
“What do you mean 'smells for me'? Aren't you identifying the same?”
“Friday, what am I dealing with here?”
"No. I want me to be back in to be a surprise. I want him to enjoy seeing me.”
“If you're finished, can we go home?” Clint asked. “I'm exhausted and hungry.”
“Did everything go alright at the Lincoln Center?” Bruce asked no one in particular.
“Good evening, Nat.”
“The Scientist Supreme,” Natasha said.
“Really?”
“Okay. Easier, huh?” Tony repeated and took a deep breath. “Well, I still think I don’t deserve you,” Tony looked quickly at Steve, but looked away. He wouldn’t be able to finish if he kept getting lost in those blue eyes. “I still think you can find something better and that you’ll regret having me around more than necessary.”
"And the other gods?" Wanda asked.
And what a wonderful taste Steve had. A shiver ran through Tony's body when the two tongues met, dancing together, seeking dominance, until Tony gave up, because he couldn't take control anymore. He wanted,
“I will, don’t doubt that, not even for a second,” Steve stroked Tony’s face and left his hand there, stroking the hair on the back of Tony’s neck, who bent his head to kiss Steve’s bare wrist. “You are the reason I came back, because
mean it.”
“Really?”
With what remains of his strength, Tony held the girl to the ship and helped her in. Steve bent down and buckled her belt and, before moving away, gave her a long kiss on the cheek.
"I did it," she said on the other end of the line, her voice clean and clear, showing that she had been up long enough to be extremely efficient.
“You know that guy?” Tony asked. "Why am I not surprised?"
for you?"
“Are you serious?” Tony was shocked. That conversation was taking unexpected turns. They were just supposed to take off their clothes and have sex like animals, until that damn pollen was completely out of Tony's system. This shouldn't become a confession.
With no time to overthink about the pet name, Tony kissed him as he unbuttoned Steve's jeans, then pushed his underwear down over his butt, with his shoes along the way, and stripped him naked. He gave a lopsided smile to Steve. “You're gorgeous.” Steve shivered and hissed as Tony's fingertips grazed the inside of his thighs, over his balls, up the tender underside of his cock, to twirl them around the edges of the head. Without waiting for any other invitation than Steve's delicious sighs to every touch, Tony bent down and licked the underside of Steve's cock all the way up to taste his precum. “Gorgeous and delicious. How you manage that?”
Tony tried to sound as unconcerned as he could and only allowed himself to let the air out and stop smiling when Steve was already at the top of the stairs.
Tony Stark," Tony could almost hear the quotation marks she was making on the other end of the line.
"Do you really want to leave this pleasant environment?"
"I am," Steve blew out a breath and grabbed the door handle. Peter was behind there, waiting for him. Afraid, scared, needing him. More than ever.
“Did that really come out of nowhere?”
"I know, I know." He held up his hands apologetically. "I'm just nervous.”
"Are you ready?" Tony asked.
"Has Steve already returned from the mission?"
“You look beautiful in my shirt,” Steve looked Tony up and down, warming up Tony’s entire body in the process. Tony already felt that his boiling point was close. He shrugged, pretending nonchalance. “It was the first thing I found thrown around the room. I thought you wouldn’t mind if I borrowed it.”
Tony was taken by surprise. He expected anything but that. Throughout the War, Tony always imagined Steve on the other side wanting Tony’s head on a silver platter, never someone who was - no, scratch that - not someone who
Peter's eyes widened and Steve couldn't help but find it adorable. His son was too incredible and too sweet to go through with all that.
“Today, maybe.”
“Hmm?” Tony had his eyes closed, humming, just enjoying the expectation.
“What
And with a fucking plim! the elevator’s doors opened.
“I know.”
“Do you have any more coffee?” Tony asked. “Or something stronger? I don’t know if I’ll be able to tell you all this dry.”
As if walking away from Steve’s body and supporting himself by his own forces was a torment, Tony walked away and looked at Steve, without much will.
"Let Tony know we've already started, and for him to come right here or I'll go to that lab myself and I’ll pick him up, and he won’t like my methods."
I'll leave you guys enjoying the weekend on the island with them.
“Steve, I’m not getting,” Tony said with a groan.
“Yes! Yes!
“Because of how the flower smells for you.”
And Tony never imagined that he would know so well as a firework feel.
unexpected turns. He wasn’t expecting that question. He should simply tell his version of the story and that’s it. Tony realized that he was trapped by Steve’s hands, that they were extremely close to each other, as they hadn’t been in a while, and Tony’s heart raced. He swallowed.
Tony's stomach twitched as he remembered everything he had prepared.
Tony thought back.
Steve stood up as best he could and looked at Tony, and he was beautiful, with his golden hair clinging to the sweat on his forehead by the effort of that wonder that was the coming and going he did. He smiled and Tony realized he was smiling too. “Are you going to let me take care of you?” Steve asked in a hoarse voice, broken by the thrusts of his body against Tony’s. He groaned as he pushed deep. “Are you going to let me love you?”
“Any trap we should know?” Steve asked.
Although Tony and Steve shared the leadership of the Avengers, everyone knew who really led them. It was to Steve that everyone turned to looking for guidance before, during, and after a battle. It was for Steve that everyone went looking for a partner to improve their fighting techniques. It was to Steve that SHIELD and the government sent their orders. All Tony did was design cool things in his lab to protect his family and make them more effective at fighting the bad guys. And eventually he helped save the day.
"Hey, can we think about it when we get back?" He ran his free fingers by Steve's soft hair. "Only happy thoughts this weekend, okay?"
Steve frowned, not understanding. He sat in one of the chairs in the quinjet and Tony stood in front of him, isolating the two of them from the rest of the team the best he could.
Peter disengaged himself from Tony's embrace.
An hour later, Tony Stark was irresistible in his tailor-made Armani suit, heading toward the penthouse. He could already hear the music and the many conversations.
Steve nodded, proving that Tony’s luck never lasted long. “It was the first thing they gave me to watch when I asked about you when I got back. Natasha told me that I should see it before I tried to talk to you in person. And you know you don’t deny a request from the Black Widow.” Steve smiled conspiratorially. “It was one of the reasons why I dropped everything and went to help you when I knew you needed me. If everything you said was true, if it wasn’t worth it, then we could fix everything, right?”
"As you told me many years ago," Steve said in a low but amused tone, just for Tony. "You're a genius, billionaire, playboy and philanthropist," he smiled the brightest smile Tony had ever seen. “Insensitive wasn’t on the list and I don’t think it’s ever been.”
Already at the end of the first mug, he looked at the refrigerator and found a note stuck to the door. Since the lights weren’t strong enough to see from that distance, Tony came over, took the piece of paper and couldn’t help but smile.
Steve's face withered and the smile disappeared. Tony knew that expression. "Steve, you haven't failed your son. I know that's what you think, but it's not the truth."
“The available data about the matter I have in my database says the cure for such intoxication is the sexual act with a
Did he still
“Do this what?” Steve asked, frowning.
After everyone entered, the receptionist took them down a corridor to a room separate from the rest of the restaurant. "Enjoy the night," she said, opening the door.
“It's a way of saying.”
"You can’t imagine how good it is to come back and find you like this.”
“Tony, what're you talking about? You're delusional, we need to take you to a doctor.” Steve's voice sounded very concerned, Tony could hear it, but all that mattered was how good Steve smelled, how wonderful it was to be so close to him. Why was Tony worried before? Everything was fine.
“Tony!” Steve left the tray on the nearest table and ran over to where Tony was sitting on the floor on his heels. And then…
“Oh, darling. Liking is an understatement that doesn’t even come close to how it felt,” Tony said, turning to admire the view from the window again. Steve laughed and it was wonderful. They were them again.
“But I couldn’t wait for you to wake up. I got a call from Bucky, asking for help with an emergency and I needed to leave you.” Steve looked deep into Tony’s eyes. “I asked Pepper to tell you to come and talk to me when you wake up, that I needed to see you, but then I knew you were awake, and you never came to talk to me. I thought you were too furious with me for everything that had happened between us so that we couldn’t at least try to talk.”
____________________________________________________________
And I hope you enjoy it too!
Without waiting for any confirmation from Rhodes, Tony turned his back and put a protective arm around Peter's shoulders. "Are you ready to go home?" Peter nodded and even tried to smile. For Tony, that was already a huge step forward. "So let's go. The car is parked outside." Before leaving the police station, Tony took a pair of sunglasses out of his jacket pocket and handed it to Peter.
Tony felt himself making a face. “I don’t really know where to start.”
Steve smiled.
She denied with her head.
Tony lifted his head.
"Go to the right and focus your attacks on that head. I'm going to attack the left head. The middle head will become incapacitated if both ends are too busy to aid in body movement.”
"I'm sorry that you missed Peggy so soon," Tony said.
He approached the stairs leading to the bottom of the penthouse where the party was taking place and found him immediately. Leaning on one of his arms at the bar counter, wearing black pants, a blue shirt folded halfway up his arm, chatting excitedly with T'Challa about something, and occasionally looking around, as if searching for something -
"Your curiosity is limitless, huh?"
Tony shrugged. "Another thing. Your godson is very smart."
Tony swallowed.
"Are you serious?" Peter asked. “Because, well, it only have left me and May and I think you can say it's been a while that there is a vacancy for father.”
“I came to see if it was true that you were alive,” Tony confessed. “Nobody ever told me that you and Thor were there and that, God help me, that you saved me. I remember waking up and running into Strange, Rhodes and Pepper, but no one told me that my instructions to bring me back, in case I needed to erase my memory, had been followed so strictly, let alone worked. Also, when I recorded those instructions, you were dead,” Tony swallowed. It would never be easy to think of a world without Steve. “I thought of those instructions with Bucky carrying the shield. I never imagined that you could be back to help me. I ... I honestly don’t know what to think. But I know that I will have a very serious conversation with a Miss Pepper Potts as soon as I see her.”
a distant part of Tony's brain was still trying to be rational.
When he finally turned around, Tony pulled the air so hard into his lungs that his chest hurt. It was the most beautiful sight Tony had ever seen ... in his life. Perhaps it overcame the day when the Avengers found Steve frozen in the Arctic. They weren’t friends that day, they didn’t know each other as they did now. This was different. Looking at Steve was like looking at the sun after hours in the dark. It hurt and it was glorious. It made Tony’s eyes sting, but he couldn’t look away even if someone forced him.
Steve looked at Tony again and his look was pained. “Thor had to run to resolve matters for Asgard, that was going through its own problems. When I saw that you weren’t waking up, I went to Strange to ask for help. I stayed long enough to help him prepare the ritual that would bring you back.”
Passing behind Vision, Natasha positioned herself between the android and the God of Thunder, which, as far as Natasha could see, not without surprise, would have his amount of scratches and bruises. That was really impressive.
“What?" Tony looked one of the monitors in front of him. "What time is it?"
Tony felt the cock beginning to leak its precome and intensified his thrusts.
, Tony snorted at his own thoughts. Of course, he needed to worry about Steve. Steve seemed to be strong, unstoppable, always ready for anything, but the truth was that he needed a port to return to, a north to guide him. Tony knew that. He knew that Steve was needing to establish himself at that moment, because something had taken from him everything that Steve was sure of. Tony just wasn’t sure how to help, or what Steve’s words meant.
Tony then stopped very seriously and looked at Steve. “So, are we just going to leave the Civil War behind?”
"My paradise is you, my love," Steve smiled and Tony thought he had never seen so much love on someone's face. Even less directed at him. “Wherever you are, then I'll be the happiest man in the world.”
“Shit.”
“You’re my best friend,” Tony said in a shaky voice. It wasn’t a lie. But it wasn’t the complete truth. But he couldn’t tell the whole truth. He couldn’t reveal that last untouched piece of information, that little piece that was still his alone. As much as it hurt, as much as Tony’s entire body screamed for him to speak the truth, he couldn’t.
"Cut it out, Rhodey. It's just the two of us here, and if I remember correctly, when you're at this cafe, you're not Detective Rhodes, but the Rhodey-bear that we all love to love. So go on. Spill it out."
In the other room, sitting on one side of a steel table with her back to them, was Natasha, and facing her was a girl, a little older than Peter, blonde, wearing jeans, a blue T-shirt and a red jacket, with hands on his lap and looking down. Nothing that seemed very disturbing or alarming.
Tony shrugged. “I just did what you would’ve done for me.”
Strange turned around enough so Tony could see his smug smile. “It looks like you really are a genius, Tony.” And then, Stephen Strange, the Sorcerer Supreme, disappeared into the portal, which closed as soon as he passed to the other side.
Tony came over and held out his hand. "Chief Ross, nice to meet you, I'm Tony Stark," the two greeted each other. "And this is my client, Captain Steve Rogers," Tony pointed to Steve, who was taken aback by the title. He hadn't heard it in a long time. He knew what Tony was doing, trying to intimidate the Chief. It was classic. Did he still remember how to play that game? Steve approached the Chief's table and held out his hand, which Chief Ross accepted. The Chief's handshake was a little more forceful than necessary, but Steve was stronger than average. Nothing he couldn't take. He smiled without showing his teeth. "Nice to meet you, Chief. Thanks for having us."
remember?”
“I think now’d be a good time for her to know we're here,” Tony said softly.
The girl smiled.
, Jarvis.” Tony sighed and looked at his reflection on the surface of his workbench, and wondered what Steve would think if he saw him in that way: messy hair stuck to his sweaty forehead, body dump with sweat; fast breathing, dilated pupils and red face; oh, and the icing on the cake: the most embarrassing and unreasonable erection of all.
The first notes of the song started to play over the speakers and Tony let all the sake he had had that night take care of him, and he just let his voice out, without looking away from Steve at any time.
“A few more minutes, why?”
“Where is she?”
this is...” Tony intended to speak, but he never finished his sentence, because Steve started moving his hips against Tony's, demanding, desiring, needing. So Tony started moving himself. He rested his hands on either side of Steve's head and leaned over the soldier. Steve's hands came out of the torpor and embraced Tony, rising and falling down his body, loving him. Tony bent down and gave Steve a slow and passionate kiss.
It could only be a dream, right? An incredibly good dream, but put there by someone bad, who knew how much Tony wanted that happiness, but could
“Even you?”
The girl nodded.
They moved far away enough for Tony to finish taking off Steve’s shirt and Tony took a little break to admire the man in front of him, the man he loved, and who, surprisingly, loved him back. He reached out and touched Steve’s torso slowly, gently, learning how each of those lines behaved under his fingers, how Steve reacted to his touch, what sounds he made, which places produced the softest sighs, the deepest moans. Steve waited patiently, even though he was breathing hard, his hands holding Tony around the waist, admiring Tony’s reconnaissance work.
See ya
"Where did that come from?" He asked looking at the bottle of lube.
"I'm not that boring, Falcon." Clint grimaced.
Tony snorted and sat up, looking around. “I’m not disabled. I can take care of myself. Where’s my first aid kit?”
Tony rubbed his eyes and sat on the bed. "Pepper, let's start over, okay? My brain is suffering from caffeine abstinence, and it's
Liz sighed, turned, lifted the chair from the floor and leaned on it.
Steve looked at the red flower for long seconds. “It's beautiful.” He leaned down, his eyes glued on the lily, and smelled it. “It smells amazing too. It's like fresh coffee, but also…” Steve waved his hand, trying to find the words. He leaned over the flower to smell it again. He frowned. “But also... oil? How can a flower like this smell like...
“Can I ask you one more question?”
Steve got up and smiled.
“Hi.”
A Tony that’s elusive with his answers was never a good sign. It meant he was unsure about something or, even worse, scared and thinking that by hiding it from others - from
"You should rest for a while."
Tony activated the armor’s repulsors and, with a graceful leap, crossed the distance between the buildings. He stepped out of the armor and left it outside, as a sign that he, as well, hadn’t come to fight. And even if Steve wanted to, he had the right and necessary force, especially against Tony off the armor.
"The rooms are upstairs," the two exchanged an intense look, as if suddenly they had remembered why they were there. The butterflies in Tony's stomach went wild.
find him," Tony replied, floating above the ground. "And then we're going to travel."
Time after time"
where did you learn these things?” Tony asked, but not sure if he was really asking something. He was lost in his own pleasure, with Steve licking and teasing his rim, slowly loosening him.
"Friday, get the bikes, please," Steve said.
We'll know how Tony and Rhodes know each other, how Tony and Natasha are related, and we'll also have Tony and Peter talking alone for the first time.
there?!"
You said
"It's not fair that your vows were so beautiful," Tony sniffed and wiped a tear that ran down with the back of his hand. "Look the mess I am now."
Suddenly feeling fearless, Steve laid on the floor, his own cock hard and heavy on his belly, twitching in anticipation, and smirked. “Why don't you come over here and find out?”
Peter looked directly at Tony, who was still driving, following the GPS instructions. But Tony did his best to return Peter's gaze. "I understand you, Peter. And I believe you. It all makes a lot of sense. I see no reason why you killed this boy. But the police think that there’s not only a reason, but they’re sure it was you."
Natasha patted him on the shoulder.
It had gone too far. Tony needed to get out of there.
"Get your things," Steve said - the first words since they left the station - pointing to Tony's suitcase by the door.
"Come on." Tony put an arm around Steve's shoulders and guided him to the quinjet. "You think you can get your energy back in two hours?"
Tony's brain was short-circuited. “Wait, wait! What do you mean,
“If this is your dream, please
Unfortunately for Tony, that fucking meeting lasted almost all day. How Fury managed to extend three seemingly simple matters and two mission reports for hours, no one was able to say. And he still boasted that he was an efficient special agent.
are the one
"I love you," Steve said back and approached for a kiss.
Steve sped up his motorcycle and was finally able to see Ares standing in the middle of a junction with a gigantic three-headed black dog and none of them seemed friendly.
Tony smiled.
"What are you gonna do now?" Tony asked, more for politeness than anything else. He had very specific plans that included a certain blond, blue-eyed man, who was right in front of him and...
“Are you sure?” Steve laughed.
"Everything's on and waiting for you, boss."
When Peter returned from the inside the Soul Stone, Tony saw the second chance he had so much asked to the universe, even without much hope. And at that moment, Tony promised that he would do anything to never lose any of the two most important people in his life, neither Peter nor Steve.
Secrets stolen from deep inside
"Hmmm... If one day you cross paths with this universe, please give my regards to him." Tony laughed, but soon Steve's mouth was in his and the laughter died, giving way to an involuntary sigh that inevitably always escaped from them when they kissed.
"Humpf. As always."
Taking a deep breath and letting the freezing air of that night enter his lungs, Tony turned the door handle that gave access to the apartment and entered, feeling the breath of hot air, bringing in the smell of coffee, clean clothes and the soap that Steve used. Tony let himself smell those scents for a second or two before entering the apartment completely and closing the door behind him.
"I'm here and I'm here to help you. Are you feeling better?" Tony told him, getting his attention.
But in the end, it wasn’t.
For a minute, the girl looked away and got lost in her own thoughts, her expression growing low, and suddenly it was like as she was carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders. Before anyone could say anything, the girl turned to face Natasha with a sad smile.
“Wait.” Steve held up his hand. “Did
Clint shrugged and bit into a slice of pizza he was holding. At that moment, as if waiting for the right time, the elevator door opened and Steve stepped out of there, freshly bathed, with his hair still damp on his forehead, bare feet, wearing black shorts and a blue T-shirt.
"And why's that?" Tony couldn't hide his huge smile.
"They think that we work for the government, in an intelligence office, so we can’t share information and that’s why we travel a lot."
he thought, putting on Steve's shirt that was on the floor. The piece was huge on Tony, larger at least two numbers, but the smell of Steve impregnated in it made him close his eyes for a moment and enjoy.
“Tony ...”
I did.” Steve shrugged. “Anyway, if it makes you happy, I forgive you, but only if you also forgive yourself.”
Steve looked at Tony suspiciously. “What’s replaced your pain, Tony?”
Steve blew out a breath, defeated. “I wanted to make sure that when you woke up, I wouldn’t lose you again.”
Steve kissed the top of his head. “I love you, too, Shellhead.”
"Oh, my God, Tony." Tony read Steve's lips through the colorful stage lights. He left the melody playing in the background and took a deep breath, looking at Steve. "We're not out of place." Steve said, walking around the table and towards the stage, towards Tony. Heart pounding, threatening to tear his chest, Tony started singing again, making Steve stop at the edge of the stage.
Everyone around the table, including Natasha, started laughing. Fury put his hands on his waist and frowned.
“Very strange.” Steve was frowning, thinking. “Something very serious happened that left Natasha extremely disturbed. She doesn’t like audiences in her interrogations."
Tony sighed, admitting defeat. There was no use trying to postpone for much more. “What do you remember from before you died?”
“Your eyes,” Steve repeated. “The girl has your eyes.”
“I didn’t know. I should’ve said something, but I was scared.” Steve gave a sad smile. “I wanted to respect your space. That’s when I saw your footprints in the building over there, and I thought maybe, just maybe, you could’ve reconsidered my offer to come in and talk.” The smile was happier now. “It never crossed my mind that you could be coming for other reasons.”
birthday party, " Tony said. "This is
Steve laughed.
“If it comforts you, I haven’t either,” Steve shrugged.
"What have I done to deserve someone like you?" Steve asked and Tony's heart warmed at the sound of his voice.
Tony was crying copiously, amid failed attempts to smile. "Steve-I-You-What did you..."
“No, let me finish.” Tony put a finger to Steve’s mouth gently, silencing him. Steve nodded slightly and Tony smiled without showing his teeth. This was important to him. He wasn’t sure how to get there, but he knew where he wanted to end now that he started. “I always accepted that this would be my path, my lifestyle so to speak. But it wasn’t too bad, after all, I had friends, I had casual dates here and there, defeated villains every other day, and I always had you by my side, even when I never imagined I could have my feelings matched by yours. Life was relatively easy,” Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, who closed his eyes, enjoying the sensation.
Steve was the certainty that Tony had, no matter what happened, no matter what the dilemma, whatever the villain of the week, no matter what the crisis was, Steve was there, the silence in the middle of the confusion. The calm in the eye of the hurricane. Tony laughed to himself in the middle of a sip of his sake, thinking how appropriate that image was.
"Yeah, I know." Tony took another sip of coffee and poured himself another mug. "But this time it was a matter of being fair to the boy. He lost the finals because he was helping us. I just helped him back," he stared at Steve. "I learned that from you.”
The girl stared at Natasha, seemingly not understanding the question. In the other room, Steve and Tony straightened up in the chairs. After a few seconds of silence, Tony saw the expression of understanding appear on her face and it was lovely to see her eyebrows arching, her mouth opening into a perfect “o” and her eyes widening slightly.
"Natasha got it for me." Tony winked at the spy who gave a small smile.
"Let's be honest, you don't look like a Hollywood star," Tony said with a friendly smile. "Besides, even if your exit hasn’t been leaked to the press, you never know when a reporter might appear. We gotta be careful."
Tony looked sideways at him. “I think it’s better for us not to get to the heart of the matter.”
Tony felt his face heat up. Apparently, his musings were too sharp, too easy to understand. “Sorry, I don’t ... You don’t have to talk about it, if you don’t want to.”
"Good night, Tony." He kissed Tony's face, bent down, picked up the water bottle and disappeared into the elevator, leaving Tony in the middle of the penthouse, with empty arms, dizzy, aroused as hell and completely fucked, because it was a fact, he thought, running his fingers through his hair:
And Tony Stark was at his side.
"Shall we invite the Royal Family of Atillan?"
"Hi," it was hardly a sigh, a whisper, but the eyes that stared at him shrank in the corners and shone beautifully. A smile. That was a smile. Steve searched his mouth and found white, aligned teeth appearing, framed by full, happy lips.
“Wow, Friday, you scared me!”
"Nice to meet you, Mr. Rogers. My name is Tony Stark and I am your lawyer."
"Well, thank you super-soldier serum," Tony took off his fingers, greased his own cock with lube and positioned himself in Steve's entrance.
“That day, in court,” Steve began, leaning over the marble island and leaning on his arms. “I was shot -”
Steve came over and stuck his forehead against Tony's, both breathing the same air.
in my mouth, delicious, and I couldn’t wait to feel you inside me, Steve. But the real thing is something else.
"So what's bothering you, baby?"
The copilot appeared and nodded.
"We're off duty." Tony said. "Today I can."
"What way?" Steve asked.
An icy chill ran over Steve's body.
going to do that, you’d at least be aware that you
However, it was obvious that the universe and Tony were not good friends because investors asked for another day so they could redo the contract by adding the changes Tony made.
"We’re gonna make the pasta."
“You have got to be kidding me.”
That was Natasha's clue.
The digital clock on the wall in the living room indicated that it was past seven at night. Tony went toward the refrigerator in search of something to eat and stumbled upon something soft on the floor. He smiled a little when he saw what it was.
“Own experience, Stormtrooper?” Clint handed it back.
“Of course, I do,” Tony replied without hesitation. “What question is that?”
“You know me.”
"Sir?”
“I don’t know what to say.” Steve said, looking at Tony.
Tony tried to move, but suddenly, everything hurt. Apparently, the blow had been stronger than he thought. He managed to open the helmet and tried to smile, but he must have made a face, because Steve's worry line deepened as he spoke on the comm. “We need to get him back to the Tower. Now.” Steve looked at Tony again. “Don't worry, you'll be okay. I'll take care of you.”
"If it weren’t for Peter Parker, Spider-Man wouldn’t even get out of bed in the morning." Steve put an arm around Peter's shoulder. "Listen, if there's one thing that my whole history with
“Tony,” Steve called. Tony focused on him. “You were the first to speak to me and introduce me to the world. You gave me a home when I woke up in this century. You were my safe haven. Let me do the same for you. Let me show you how I see you, let me be your safe haven.” Steve held his hand out to Tony, his eyes shining with hope and feeling.
“Yes,” Tony confirmed.
If you fall I will catch you--I'll be waiting
Steve nodded slightly, his expression unreadable. “So, you should also know that, after those
Tony knew that was the time to leave for good, to leave and not look back. But he knew, Steve knew, and after the Civil War, the world knew:
" Steve pulled away enough to hold Peter's face and looked his son in the eye. So much sadness in a face so beautiful, so smart and where there should only be happiness. "I came to help you," Steve wiped away a few tears, just to see his work ruined by the other tears that came soon after.
Tony laughed. "It worked for me. So, nothing is impossible."
"It's Natasha's worth today."
always felt inadequate around me.”
"Thank you, Mr. Stark."
“No, I don’t know. But you didn’t know it either, Tony. The next time you arrive at such a crossroads, trust me. We work better
Steve nodded with his eyes closed.
“I love you so much,” Steve said when he pulled away.
Tony took a deep breath and smiled lightly.
Steve finally understood everything and he wasn’t sure if he felt himself relieved or worried that Tony could be such a genius but also so stupid some times. “Tony, do you really think everything I said to you was a flower that made me say?”
The vault door opened and Tony dragged himself in there. The box was still in the same place, in the center of the vault, but it was no longer glowing. Tony took it with one hand and headed back to the lab.
“Okay,” Steve said, looking at Tony. “Are you ready?”
love problem.
"That they found Peter's DNA at the crime scene, yeah, I'm aware of that. But still, we go over there to talk to your son and the chief. In the meantime, I'm going to get Peter a habeas corpus. You know what that means, right?" Tony looked at him with doubt, as if suddenly Steve was a five-year-old kid.
Tony grunted and left the lab and went up to the penthouse.
“Wow, I think this is a record.”
"I think coffee can make that sacrifice."
"Well, well, look who crawled out of his grave," Natasha said. "How’s Dubai?"
“From someone in an non-standard relationship to someone in a non-standard relationship: if there is love, everything around is contaminated by it. Hatred is over, distrust is over, prejudice is over, fear is over. There is only love left,” she walked away smiling. “And you two have contaminated this team with so much love that it is impossible not to love back.”
Tony pulled away and smirked.
"There is still salvation for you, Merida.”
Then Tony felt wrapped in a pair of arms, which wrapped around him knowing that they wouldn’t be pushed aside. On the contrary, they were very necessary. It was a warm, soft and firm haven, able to protect him from all dangers, even those that Tony created for himself, steadying him to reality, bringing him back, comforting him. He didn’t deserve that. The smell of clean clothes and Steve, the scent that only he had, permeated Tony’s senses, making him dizzy, thirsty and with a racing heart. He was hyper alert, about to explode, and having such a concentrated dose of Steve at that moment could lead to unexpected and dangerous reactions.
"You are invited to Steve Rogers’ birthday, Fourth of July, at the Avengers Tower, at eight o'clock," Tony read aloud, "Come and help us make the best 100-year party someone could have," Tony laughed.
"That's all I want, Nat," Tony said and turned to enter the bathroom.
Steve stood up as best he could and looked at Tony, and he was beautiful, with his golden hair clinging to the sweat on his forehead by the effort of that wonder that was the coming and going he did. He smiled and Tony realized he was smiling too. “Are you going to let me take care of you?” Steve asked in a hoarse voice. “Are you going to let me love you?”
Steve nodded in agreement. “Yes. We both lost.”
“Let me finish.” Steve smiled. “I see someone so generous that he chose to give up everything, including his own memory, to save those who have turned their backs on him.”
For several seconds, which seemed like hours, no one said anything. Finally, Tony wrapped an arm around Steve's waist and pulled him toward the door.
"We can cook again," Steve suggested.
The Sorcerer Supreme tilted his head and observed Tony and Steve’s hands together again. He raised an eyebrow, now looking slightly interested. “Let me guess: he was your antidote.”
Peter rested his head on his hands. "This is a nightmare." Tony started the car and left the police station parking lot without saying anything.
"Do you always get what you want that way?" Tony asked suddenly, after a few minutes of silence.
But, if I may, Peter's coming in the next chapter! Action is coming too, I promise :)
"It's a twelve-hour flight, Tony. And I know you long enough to know how long your jet lag lasts. I need you to be completely focused and presentable at this meeting.”
"I know I left school a while ago, but the final exams shouldn’t have happened already, like, a couple of weeks ago?" Clint asked, counting on his fingers. "July's already around the corner.”
“And is that bad?” She asked.
to make me forget the technology, dear.”
Steve frowned.
“Honey,” Tony said, standing up. “I try to get cool with my life.” He bent to give the soldier a quick kiss before returning to the back of Quinjet.
"What? New York? Nat, what's the matter with Boston lawyers?"
"Oh, so let’s fix this." Tony unbuckled his seatbelt and went to sit next to Steve, who was waiting for him with an outstretched arm. He lifted the armrest that divided the armchairs and snuggled into the hug Steve had opened for him.
“No, let me finish.” Tony put a finger to Steve’s mouth gently, silencing him. Steve nodded slightly and Tony smiled without showing his teeth. This was important to him. He wasn’t sure how to get there, but he knew where he wanted to end now that he started. “I always accepted that this would be my path, my lifestyle so to speak. But it wasn’t too bad, after all, I had friends, I had casual dates here and there, defeated villains every other day, and I always had you by my side, even when I never imagined I could have my feelings matched by yours. Life was relatively easy,” Tony ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, who closed his eyes, enjoying the sensation.
he thought. But now he needed one. And as soon as possible, it was a matter of life and death. Steve frowned at the unintended pun. What an inappropriate moment ...
So, witness the beginning!
Tony's heart had never beaten so fast. He leaned against the doorframe and let himself slip to the floor.
"He's the Greek god of War, and that dog in his company is Cerberus," Thor frowned. "He should be guarding the gates of the Underworld.”
Steve looked at Tony, wiped a tear from his face, and smiled. "I do."
to remember Tony?
"Friday, pick the best clothes for the weekend while I change.”
Tony heaved an exaggeratedly heavy sigh.
Tony told Steve that he could handle putting the box in the vault himself, and that Steve could go back to whatever he was doing before Strange arrived. Alone, and already out of his armor, Tony went straight to a room next to the lab, where the vaults were to store objects and weapons seized from the most diverse enemies of the Avengers. The Destroyer, lethal armor coming straight from Asgard, was one of the treasures kept there, after they defeated Loki and expelled him from inside the metallic monster - long history.
“And I love you,” she finally said, her voice full of knots, and pain and despair and love.
Wanda nodded and, with a surge of red energy coming out of her hands, she took off and landed in front of the right head. With precise attacks, she attacked the right head of Cerberus, who was advancing menacingly to the Avenger.
“And I'm not going. It's a surprise.”
really
"I talked to him and he came to the same conclusion as me: the Wolmurs may not be that innocent."
“Tony, I-I don’t know what to say,” Steve sobbed. His expression was transfigured in pain and guilt. “I should’ve managed to let you know that I was okay.”
“They now have a new leader, the Scientist Supreme,” Tony flew above them, firing their repulsors at a group of agents dressed in yellow. “According to S.H.I.E.L.D. he designed a new weapon with technology stolen from various sources and we still don’t know all that it can do.”
“What about Ares?” Wanda asked.
"Yes. I asked Rhodes to get that information for me, but I know that by the means the police have, I’ll only get what I need when it’s too late. And I know I could ask Pepper too, but I don’t have enough time. I need you to do your magic."
"You're so good to me," Steve said softly, with a tired smile, but a beautifully contented one.
Tony blinked twice then smirked. “Why, why, Captain. Weren't you just saying how I should've followed Strange's instructions?” He went back to the humming.
"Oh, how wonderful, so this time we were the chosen ones?” Clint said sarcastically.
it was just what his heart was screaming. Not his boy. No, please.
"What I did was my problem, Thor. Now do not be gentle and compel me to take your Land, for I will love to take it as my war spoil.” The god smiled wickedly.
Tony looked at him and smiled. “Have you ever looked at yourself in the mirror?”
Tony thought, having an idea.
Tony has never felt anything like that in his life. Of course, others had already passed through his life. Playboy fame hadn’t come out of the blue. But it had never happened before with that level of commitment, intimacy, passion, trust and, most importantly, love. It was as if in a minute Tony was on the edge of a precipice and, in the next minute, he was flying through the void in a million pieces.
If it were up to Tony, he and Steve would make out hard right there, in front of Strange to show that that flower was no big deal. But Tony agreed to the plan, so there he was, pretending that everything was like a week ago.
"Great. So we need to park the car, okay?" Tony's voice was light, but Steve could see the forced nonchalance. He looked in the rearview mirror and saw that he had suddenly stopped in the middle of the street.
Steve, darling?” Tony looked pointedly at Steve.
“No. We are real.”
Tony felt that a dam inside him had breached and now he just couldn’t suppress the flow.
“I’m sorry, Steve.”
Steve shrugged. “It’s no longer such a problem. It was worse in the first days. I couldn’t sleep, afraid of not waking up anymore, afraid of seeing myself trapped in that infinite again.”
"I'm just here thinking that if your job as the director of S.H.I.E.L.D. doesn’t work, you'd make a great farmer, Fury.”
Tony swore to himself that he would leave Steve alone, that he would wait until he tried to get in touch. Tony told himself, returning from Steve’s apartment the night before weeping, like a helpless child, that he wouldn’t do anything like that again.
"Because that was our deal, remember?" Tony glanced at him over the envelope as he ripped the top, picking up a folded sheet from inside. "And if you haven’t gone through with praise in your finals, no fighting crime with the Avengers for you."
- I - aaah,
mean it. For me, when my guts say ‘don't trust Tony Stark’s word’,
“Yes, boss.”
“I thought time could make you see what I saw,” Steve said, standing up, almost in slow motion. He straightened up and stopped, giving Tony a chance to leave if he wanted to. Tony didn’t move. He couldn’t do it; his legs were glued to the floor and his ears needed to continue listening to what Steve had to say. Seeing that Tony wouldn’t leave, Steve took a step forward, slowly, without taking his eyes off Tony even for an instant. Tony was the cornered, dangerous and withdrawn animal, ready to escape at any moment and Steve was using all his persuasion to make him listen, to make him stay and
“What are you talking about?”
"Steve?" Tony called softly again. Steve didn't move.
“I'm not talking about courage to sing. I was talking about courage to finish what we're doing here.” Tony smirked.
“Then we can say we have a problem,” Wanda said, passing by them to get a jacket.
Unable to restrain himself, Tony trailed Steve's face with his fingertips, following the line of his jaw, and back to caress his hair. With a sigh, Steve opened his eyes and smiled as he met Tony's gaze.
“And what did you do?” Tony asked, his strength draining. He felt like a spectator of his own life.
Steve looked up and Tony wasn't quick enough to look away and pretend he wasn't looking. They stared at each other for long seconds and Tony wasn't sure what he was seeing there. There was certainly all the pain and despair for the son he embraced, but Steve's gaze also carried another feeling, deeper information, more difficult to reach. Gratitude? No. He had already said several times that he was grateful that Tony was there. Shame? Probably not. Tony had already seen Steve in one of his worst moments, when they had still exchanged a few words and that only brought them closer. Tony then wondered what Steve might be seeing back, what was Tony's gaze denouncing? Would it be as obvious to him, as it was to Rhodes, that Tony fantasized about the idea of them trying to go out together after the trial was over? Was Tony letting out that his interest there ended up being more than just professional? No, it couldn't be, right? He knew how to hide better than that. As a precaution, it was best to prevent Steve from keep seeing whatever Tony's eyes were giving him. Then Tony blinked, pulling them both out of the trance and walked over to where Steve and Peter were.
please, don’t stop,
“Fair enough.”
The girl smiled.
“Thank you. I’m happy to be back,” Steve ate a cookie and was thoughtful as he chewed. “Do you know what I noticed while I was wandering?” Tony shook his head and waited.
“Because I love planning parties and today I have my schedule free. How's yours?”
Steve slowed and went back to Tony's mouth for a last kiss, deep and passionate, full of love, that took from Tony all the rest of the breath he had left.
"That would be great if there was no one else here so you could finish that kiss trail," Tony smiled crookedly.
"So, no apologies."
Tony’s dick was tantalizingly close to Steve’s face, and he wanted to suck it, but it was out of reach — at least for his mouth. So Steve did the next-best thing he could and ran his hands across Tony’s cock, until he had a good grip around it. It took his hands a second to match up with Tony’s rhythm, but once they did, Tony screamed like he hadn't until that moment.
"Two hours to the destination," Pierre's voice came from the speakers. "Have a good trip.”
Tony was still silent and Steve could almost see his brain working, weighing the possibilities, the pros and cons. Finally, he looked at Steve. "I don't want to bother you any more than necessary."
"What was that noise?"
, was what Tony wanted to ask, but he was too moved. Steve was alive and was talking to him. Hearing his voice again, in person, and not on a recording, was like an extracorporeal experience. Tony felt out of orbit. He waited so long to hear Steve again, and now that he finally had the chance, all he could do was hide in his invisible armor and cry. Steve was saying Tony’s name out loud again. It was almost too much to take.
“Tony, what happened?” Steve scanned Tony's face, looking for something he could work with. “My God, Tony, you're burning!” And it was then that Steve, in an attempt to get a better feel for Tony's temperature, held his face, which fit perfectly into Steve's hand. With a sigh of relief, Tony tilted his head, snuggling there.
"And after making the surprise, where are you going?" Rhodes asked when they were both outside the cafe. "What hotel are you staying at?"
Steve leaned over Tony and kissed him deeply while removing his fingers. Steve calmly ran his hands over Tony’s body, warm, soft, demanding, while Tony hugged him back, clinging to Steve as if that were his salvation. Steve unhurriedly held his erection and after aligning himself with Tony, he pushed in carefully.
expression on his face, to no avail.
“And she's the best version of us both.” He leaned over and kissed Tony in a mixture of apprehension and happiness.
“Oh, come on!”
he wondered with a small part of his mind, because the rest were hyperconscious of Steve's presence there, emanating warmth and security, a familiarity that Tony liked to have around.
"Tony had already adopted this boy a long time ago. It was only a matter of time before we got to that point.”
“You. Ate. My. PICKLES!” Hulk shouted to Clint and made the glasses tremble on the table.
“Shhh, it’s not your fault, Steve,” Tony smiled. “I needed to understand my grief. That was my mechanism. I stopped as soon as your imaginary voice told me it was disappointed,” Tony shook his head and laughed, remembering the moment. He looked back at Steve when he recovered. “But seriously, all those moments, all those nights, and then all those days, drinking to try to reach you, even if in an imaginary way, all that time going in the direction of my worst version, I should’ve realized right away that everything I was doing was simply because I needed you. But I was too numb to understand my own emotions.”
"Hey," Steve took Wanda's hand, holding it for a few seconds. "Thanks for the support. I always had sure that I loved Tony with all my heart, but I never thought much of how they would welcome us if we were to really be together. And so far, I've only had reasons to be happier every time.”
"Did you like it that much? I thought you didn’t like parties.”
a far part of his brain screamed. Taking advantage that Steve was exploring his neck with his tongue -
“Yaaaay.” Tony said low-spirited.
“So, what I was told is true?” Steve asked, his eyes shining in a new way that Tony had never seen before.
“What happened?” Peter asked.
Tony pulled away enough to look at him. Steve was frowning, thinking. Tony laughed. “Why, Steve Rogers afraid to face the world outside?” Steve pouted. Tony laughed out loud and poked Steve in the chest. “Who are you and what have you done with my Steve?”
Tony opened and closed his mouth several times, unable to articulate what he was feeling. He had to say something wise at that moment, right? Perhaps to say that Steve did the right thing in realizing the obvious, that it was clear as the sunniest day he belonged to that time, to
“Never.” Steve shook his head.
"What Clint wanted to say is that we understand," Wanda said with a friendly smile.
"Think with me, Nat. How does a family leave away and just leave the house behind? Even if a crime has happened there, and the police need the place for the investigation, it takes no more than a few days. The Wolmurs certainly would need the money from the sale or rent of the house to survive elsewhere."
"Hulk, hold this here." Peter gave the tip of the web for the Hulk. "Now throw me around the animal's legs.”
Blinking a few times to adjust his vision, Tony tried to move and found himself with his legs stuck. For an instant of panic, his fighting side had already imagined that he was trapped by enemies and that plans would be needed for an escape. As he looked down, despair threatening to come up, Tony saw his legs intertwined with two others and then the memories of the previous night hit him like a cosmic punch (believe it, it is an extraordinary force). How good it was to be able to have memories to remember, even more memories as beautiful as those.
"You cook very well, Mr. Stark," Steve said when he was done. He smiled, satisfied.
” Tony gave a sad little smile. “In the middle of it all, we had your funeral and discovered a large-scale Skrull infiltration into Earth, being led by Spider-Woman who, we ended up discovering to be the Skrull Queen infiltrated long ago among us.”
Tony thought.
"I didn’t mean to frighten you, boss."
you and I will learn from your mistakes and adapt to them. They make you who you are.” Steve smiled. “As for being the one to blame for my death, that merit is Red Skull’s, not yours. And I went to trial for my actions. I went to war against you because I wanted to. I knew what I was doing. Or at least I
- Steve was beautiful.
"What?" Steve frowned.
"Hello, my dear," Tony said sitting on the bed.
The opportunities were there, he was just afraid of the answers.
Tony smiled at Strange, his best magazine-cover smile, as Steve called it. “Strange, as you said yourself, I'm a genius.” He held out his arms again and, reluctantly, Stephen Strange handed the golden box to Tony. It was extremely light and Tony considered the possibility that Strange was playing a trick on them and that there was nothing inside.
"I'll get another slice of pizza and come back to start," Tony said as he headed for the kitchen.
"I know, you know, but
“Oh, my
"Could you stop?" Nat asked, but even she was smiling.
"You know, I'm thinking about something," Steve leaned over and began to follow the line of Tony's jaw with the tip of his nose, causing shivers all over Tony's body. "If this counter is really spacious or if you're just a good salesman.”
"Like I said, it looks like they have another bomb than that one you destroyed in Alaska. And this one is even more powerful, with a greater power of destruction.”
"You have an island and don’t want to take advantage of the beautiful beach you have on it?"
"It does very well for the nerves," Tony tried a smile. Steve smiled back and left the room, disappearing down the hall. Tony let out the breath he hadn't even realized he was holding and closed the door behind him. He took a look around the room and started to unpack. He hung up the other two suits and shirts he had brought on the hangers he found inside the wardrobe, arranged the rest of the folded clothes in the two inner drawers of the furniture and left the shoes outside, against the wall. With his suitcase unpacked, the day finally fell on him, and Tony allowed himself to feel the tiredness and tension he had been ignoring for longer than ideal. "I need a shower. And something to eat." Tony took off his clothes, folding them and leaving them on the suitcase, took his bag and went to the bathroom. A bath had never felt like such a luxury. He let the hot water from the shower lick his aching muscles, undoing some of the tension knots, before washing his hair with shampoo and his body with the new soap he had brought.
"Steve offered me his guest room and I'm sleeping there," Tony spewed out the words so fast he hoped Rhodes didn't understand. Unfortunately for him, his friend had understood very well.
Tony turned to look for Steve and found him immediately, very close, talking to Sam and Reed Richards.
"Hmmm, you taste great, baby," Tony said in a husky, hushed voice, "but we'll see the rest, will we?"
" Steve said with his eyes closed and his hands gripping the sheets tightly.
“Tony.”
“Where was your conscience, then?”
The Avengers, no matter how good they are, don’t come home with Steve at the end of the day. Bucky, even if he’s back, doesn’t go on missions with Steve as in the old times of their partnership, because now he and Natasha were a pair. How, then, could Steve consider his home there? How could he have wanted to come back? Tony saw his list of questions grow and no real opportunity to ask them.
But of course it was all too good to be true, wasn’t it? It was all a dream in his head.
“Why do they always choose the hardest way?” Clint said, throwing a freezing arrow and hitting precisely on the Scientist Supreme's legs.
Tony wiped away a tear that ran down his face. He hadn't realized that he had started to cry.
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Tony thought, watching the soldier relax under the touch of his fingers in his hair.
“Yes, all the time. To think that I would never see you again, that I could never tell you how I felt, and that it was all my fault? There wasn’t a minute when I didn’t think about you.”
“Shall we tell Natasha that we've arrived?” Steve asked.
“I just wanted to let you know that I was going to reach you,” Steve continued, speaking into the night. If someone passed by there, they could find two things from that scene: Steve was crazy or he was Romeo swearing to Juliet by the moon. Tony tried to laugh at his own ridiculous joke, but only managed to sob. Steve was going to try to talk to him. He was. Tony tried to blink to get the tears out of his eyes. He wanted to see Steve, in addition to just hearing him. “But, you know, Tony, everything has been so crazy since I … well, since I
He focused his gaze across the room, at Steve, who was looking back at him. "Steve, darling, I dedicate this one to you." Tony pointed at him. "Do what you want with this information."
Tony smiled, his heart doubling in size with so much love for that man right in front of him. “In just a week we had Strange showing up, then a flower that was actually a sex-pollen vector, now the two of us being a thing …”
“How's he doing?”
"Unfortunately they all left, boss," the A.I. replied immediately.
"Tony." Steve's voice was a short whisper.
“Good morning, my love,” Tony smiled back.
Peter smiled nervously at Steve, but eventually grimaced.
Tony shrugged. “Well, it won’t be overnight, of course.” He took a sip of coffee. “But, yes, why not?” Tony turned to face Steve, who was not wearing anything. The lack of modesty, no shame, Steve comfortable with Tony, just made everything clearer. Tony traced the line from Steve’s chest to his navel and smiled. “In addition, the package comes with some very interesting bonuses.”
Steve shrugged and smiled.
“Really. Start doing this while I'm going to get the ingredients for the sauce.” Steve went to the pantry, got the nutmeg, the onion, the milk, and went back to the kitchen to get the butter and broccoli in the refrigerator. He put everything on the counter next to Peter. “How's it going?”
Tony parked the car. They had finally arrived at Steve and Peter's house and Tony saw Steve outside, holding a sponge and with a bucket at his feet. On the wall behind him, the letters RER were still visible. Tony and Steve's eyes met and Tony understood immediately. The news had spread. The entire city now knew that the son of the Army Captain and now a famous artist was on trial for murdering a schoolmate and was coming to show its nastiness. To graffiti "MURDERER" on the wall of their house was probably the first step.
“That I wouldn’t change the fact that I ended up here, that I was frozen. I wouldn’t go back there. This is where I should be, where I belong.
“Are we there yet?” Steve sat up properly and stretched.
If one day someone ever imagined what a super strength child would be, it wouldn’t be necessary to go very far to see the results, Tony thought seeing the Asgardian god and the green giant crushing A.I.M. agents. He headed back toward the Scientist Supreme who was already under Clint and Natasha's eye.
Steve shrugged and looked a little embarrassed, a little unsure of himself. “I just want to make sure that we’re on the same page.”
Tony propped himself up on one elbow, took a deep breath trying to clear his mind, and stood still, looking at the beautiful flower in his other hand. Then he let out a wistful laugh when the answer popped bright and clear into his mind. Tony straightened up and cradled the red lily in his two hands and was tempted to crush it.
“Let's take it easy, okay?” Steve said and Tony was in doubt if that had been an orientation for him or for Steve himself.
Tony shook his head. He didn’t know how he would react to Steve so close after all this time, even if only a few weeks had passed for him and not more than an entire year.
“Good. Good indeed.”
Everyone moved. It was impressive Steve's ability to lead a team like that, Tony couldn't help thinking, with so many conflicting personalities, huge egos and everyone with enough power to question his leadership. But nobody did. On the contrary, everyone respected him a lot and waited for the Captain's orders. How could he do that?
"Nat?"
Tony pulled away enough to look at him. Steve was frowning, thinking. Tony laughed. “Why, Steve Rogers afraid to face the world outside?” Steve pouted. Tony laughed out loud and poked Steve in the chest. “Who are you and what have you done with my Steve?”
A few minutes later, there was Tony Stark perched behind the chimney on the top of the building in front of Steve’s apartment, hidden in the shadows, waiting. He was fully aware that it was disturbing, but he was unable to return home. He had to see Steve again. Tony needed to see for himself that Steve was fine, that he didn’t need anything. He needed to be sure that Steve had someone watching over him,
“Tony, look at me.” Tony took a deep breath and did what Steve asked, meeting eyes so full of love that he thought he could drown. “Now, pay close attention to what I’m going to say to you, and please don’t be mad at me later, okay?”
“I wanna see the flower.” Steve said again.
“Nanny from a box,” Tony mumbled as he typed the vault’s access code on the panel next to the door. “What don't we do to make Stephen Strange owe us a favor.” He leaned toward retinal recognition.
“Thanks for accepting.” Steve smiled.
“Let’s agree to disagree.” Tony shrugged.
“Hey, hey. Tony. Tony.” Steve’s voice was close. Very close. “Tony, look at me.”
Tony woke up the next day not with the sound of the cell phone alarm ringing, but with a call. He fumbled around on the nightstand until he found his cell phone and saw that it was Pepper calling at seven thirty in the morning. Unusually early by his standards. Tony considered not answering, but the consequences would be too catastrophic. Pepper was an angel, but she should never be irritated. He cleared his throat and answered the call.
“What happened to you?” it wasn’t the most important question in the ranking of questions that Tony made up in his head for when (if) that moment came. But he still didn’t have the courage to reach the top three. And Steve knew he was stalling. And, God bless him, he pretended it was okay for Tony to dodge what he really wanted to know.
Steve released his cock and he drew his fingers from inside Tony, who moaned in protest, but he stood up and leaned over Tony with one hand on either side of his head and Tony could see that Steve was holding something in one hand. He smiled.
Then Tony’s stomach did a twist and went back into place when he felt his hands being squeezed back. He felt his eyes widen and looked at Steve in surprise.
“I love you, Winghead.” Tony smiled, kissing the tip of Steve's nose.
Steve pulled Tony and held him around the waist. Tony smirked and wrapped his arms around the soldier's neck. “You’re not lost. You’re not and never have been. Let him go.”
Natasha couldn’t say anything. All she could see were those huge, incredibly expressive brown eyes that could declaim poems and declare wars only with their intensity and wit. Eyes that she now saw every day and that had impressed her since the first time Natasha had seen them. Tony Stark's eyes. Eyes that now was staring at her in the middle of the Lincoln Center and that did not belong to Iron Man, but to a completely strange but equally familiar girl.
with a guttural moan from the back of his throat and so they gained pace. Tony wrapped his legs around Steve's waist, giving both of them a better angle, causing each and every thrust of Steve to reach Tony's prostate in exactly the right place, making him see stars, while with one hand, Tony reached for his own cock. Steve bent down and sipped Tony's moans with deep and passionate kisses, went down to the base of his neck, where surely some marks would appear denouncing the hickeys, and then he felt that he was near to come and increased the pace. Tony also increased the speed in his own cock and they were in the same pace now. With his free hand, Tony gripped Steve's neck tightly and felt his body tighten.
Tony thought.
Tony was taken by surprise. He was so distracted by Steve’s eyes that he let his guard down and stopped paying attention to what he was saying. It wasn’t possible for Steve to know that Tony was there. The armor made him invisible, even more hidden in the shadows as he was. Steve was bluffing. He couldn’t, he
"Come on, Rhodes, tell me, what am I not seeing here? Which piece is still missing from my puzzle?" Tony felt his entire body vibrate. He couldn’t conceive the idea that his friend, best friend, perhaps, could be a corrupt policeman, forging evidence, or, at best, covering up someone else. It wasn’t a scenario that made sense.
"And what do I do?" Sam asked.
His vision blurred and Tony blinked, trying to clear his focus and his hot, wet eyes. He was crying. The mere prospect of Steve out Tony’s life was so unbearable, that hurt too much. Tony instinctively raised his hand to wipe away the tears, but remembered at the last moment that he was inside the armor, that the effort was useless. He needed to get out of there. Give Steve the privacy he deserved. Tony turned and prepared to take off. And he almost tripped over himself when he heard it.
? Nobody paid any attention to Tony when he worked. What mattered were the results, the cool toys that came out of his workshop. Nobody cared if Tony sang or not while making them. Well, nobody, except the one person who cared to check if Tony was okay, if Tony had eaten, if Tony had slept, if Tony had showered, and the only person who didn't mind spending hours quietly drawing, just to keep Tony company while Tony worked.
"Steve, for God's sake, you can't be serious." Steve heard Tony sigh, exasperated. "I don't judge you for your panic attack because I myself have had the same problem for years." Steve suddenly raised his head and looked at Tony, but said nothing. He couldn't. "It's true," Tony said. "You can call Pepper and confirm, if you like," Tony shrugged.
“Stop with what?” Tony asked, out of breath.
“God, Tony -
“I've never called anyone like that in my life. Until today.”
"Is that what I think it is?"
Steve reached Tony cock and took it in his hand, making Tony moan, and went down on him. Steve opened up and swallowed Tony in one pass, working his tongue and lips as tight as he could manage around Tony's swollen cock. Steve couldn’t help but give a little smile, still with Tony's cock in his mouth, as he gasped, “Fuck, oh fuck, Steve!
“Great. Take us to the hangar, then.”
"Immediately, sir.”
“What I mean is that we switched places.”
didn’t we talk?”
"So let's get this game started." Clint rubbed his hands and sat down on the floor next to Natasha. "I'm feeling like it's my night tonight.”
"Now listen carefully, because I'm only going to say it once," Tony said seriously, holding Steve's face in his hands. Steve's smile disappeared and he nodded, understanding that Tony was serious. “I'll always want you around. And you know why? Because I love you, Steven Grant Rogers. I'll
"Landing in a minute," Natasha announced from the front of the quinjet.
"You still look stunning, Mr. Stark-Rogers." Steve blinked, delighted by the sound of the two names together. They matched Tony perfectly.
Dad? They said it's impossible, that I can't get out of this," Peter hid his face again on Steve's shoulder. He was devastated and Steve wished he could switch places with him.
“From you?” Tony pouted, pretending to think. "Whenever possible."
Tony shrugged, as if it was nothing, but inside, his heart was racing and everything else had turned to jelly. “I can be very persuasive.”
"Hey," he felt his arm warm up. When looking at the heat source, he found Tony's hand holding his arm, comforting him, grounding him. "It's okay, nothing happened. No car came in that direction. It's okay," he must've seen the suspicion on Steve's face because he laughed softly. "It's true. We're just going to park now, because we don't have to rely on luck that long, right?"
“According to my analysis, norepinephrine levels are abnormally high, while serotonin levels are ... completely off the charts, changing every minute.” Jarvis stopped, as if he was considering what to say next. “These results explain the dysregulation of your heart rate and blood pressure. However, what worries me, sir, is that your limbic system has been affected by whatever has infected you and the causative agent is making it impossible for me to analyze it.”
"Are you sure we're talking about Thor?" Peter asked.
“Ok, Doctor Magic, give us the instructions.”
let him in. Not even if he puts his password on the panel. He can't see me like that, Jarvis. Do you understand?” Tony looked up, wiping the tears away. “He
"You know," he said, his voice louder than the music. Steve turned around immediately and stared at him wide-eyed. Tony smiled. “For someone who's turning 100, you're in great shape.”
Maybe he could have stopped the shots. Maybe he could have seen where the sniper was positioned. Perhaps he could have been able to predict that something like that would happen. Perhaps he could have thought about improving security. Perhaps. Perhaps. Perhaps. Maybe he shouldn’t have supported the Law. Maybe he could have asked Steve to talk before everything was blown apart. Maybe they could have reached an agreement. Maybe. Maybe. Maybe.
"Now I'm going to talk to some people, search some files and see what I can find out until the date of your trial is announced."
“WHAT?!” Hulk shouted.
“What?” Tony asked, his voice still cracked from breathlessness.
Tony didn’t know what to think. His brain flew, millions of thoughts at the same time, trying to fit into coherent reasoning. Steve was talking about what? Was he talking about the Civil War? Or was he talking about something else that Tony wasn’t told and that he should know?
“I am.”
“Come on, Tony, ask the questions you want to ask,” Steve said with a half-smile. “I told you, I didn’t ask you here to fight. I want to talk.”
“Sir, if I may, does such
"Yes. I need a lawyer. The best you can find me to resolve this situation."
If you're lost you can look--and you will find me
“I’m sorry, Tony.” And Tony knew that Steve was telling the truth in each of those words. So, he came over and kissed him slowly, to show how much Steve’s truth meant to him. As Tony stepped back, he took a deep breath because he wasn’t done yet. He needed Steve to hear everything.
The pasture with the cows was still on the screen behind Fury, and Tony clasped his fingers in front of his body, framing Fury and the holographic screen.
Tony climbed on the bed, crawling between Steve’s legs, without looking away. “I’m not planning anything, darling,” Tony rested his hands on either side of Steve, trapping him between Tony and the mattress, and stole a kiss. As Tony walked away, he sat on Steve’s lap, hugging him with his legs. “I’m just living the two of us.” Tony twined his fingers in Steve’s hair and pulled his head back, exposing his neck, to where Tony hurriedly bent down to lick from base to ear, feeling the skin crawl, coming back the same way with kisses and bites, getting more and more courageous with Steve’s loudest moans.
"Is this business very important?"
And, when Tony hit the right spot, Steve let go a loud cry calling Tony, and came. He came all over his belly and Tony's hand, but the sight of Steve's orgasm face was enough to make Tony came too. And he did it hard, harder than before, all inside Steve.
“What?”
"I think you better get in."
another voice, a kinder voice this time, said.
was the name of that look. Tony slowly licked his lips and Steve's reaction was instantaneous: his pupils dilated and his eyes followed, avidly, the movement of his tongue, as a hunter follows the prey's movements.
Steve was wide-eyed.
"Of absolutely everything you can get about the victim's parents and about the victim himself. I want everything, names, registration numbers in every possible and imaginable official office, social media history, everything. Got it? Everything you can get for me, I need it."
Tony turned and looked at the suitcase Steve was pointing at. "Hmmm, yes. It's mine. I didn't want to take it inside your house if we were just going to talk about work. It didn't make sense."
Don’t stop.
” He asked in horror.
Tony’s fingers tingled looking for any opening in Steve's clothes that could help him take them out and make way for as much exposed skin as possible.
Steve blinked, surprised. “I thought that after all these years it was obvious,” he laughed. “You can’t fool the heart, Tony. We can try to run away from it, run as fast as we can, pretend it’s not there, disguise the evidence, but in the end, it always wins. Love always resurfaces, getting bigger and stronger. Especially after adversities, like the ones we always go through. So yes, Shellhead, I love you.”
you. There is no person I trust in this world more than you. There’s no one else in this world that I’d follow with my eyes closed, no one I would give everything for, no one else I’d lose everything for, no one I’d give the key to bring me back from the dead other than you.” Tony came over and kissed him long and deeply, sealing each of his words. Each of them purer and truer than the other. When they came apart, Steve smiled and his eyes sparkled. “I love you,” Tony repeated. “I gave my heart to you tonight. It is yours for you to make with it what you want. And with me.” Tony stroked Steve’s face and ended up holding him by the chin, making him look deep into Tony’s eyes. “Oh, darling, with me do whatever you want,
