The way Bucky was moving was almost unnatural and sinister. Steve watching a wispy puff of smoke leave his lips. He could almost see Bucky hanging out of their apartment window, half blushing when he caught Steve drawing him, sticking his tongue out teasingly.
"I think Steve probably agrees with me," said Tony, trying to keep calm.  An unintentional snarl or bristle would, he knew, make him look unstable, and everyone was already looking at him with a gaze that indicated they thought he was out of line.
Re: this chapter and world-building.  Because I can already hear the questions, I want to emphasize that it is extremely taboo for Alphas to enter into bonds with omegas who are already bonded.  This is one reason omegas tend to like being bonded: it's a form of protection against all other Alphas.  It's arguably more taboo for an Alpha to develop a bond with an already-bonded omega than it would be for two Alphas (acers or acesexuals) to be in a relationship.  (Side note: omegas who are acesexual are considered straight, regardless of the gender of the Alpha.  Alphas who are omegosexual are likewise considered straight, regardless of the gender of the omega.  Most Alphas and omegas have secondary sex preferences.)  I hope this clears up some of the societal aspects of our little A/b/o AU here.
"You want the chair?" Steve asked. "Buddy? You want me to put you down?"
"...he seems... enthusiastic," she observed, crossing her arms across her chest.  Steve knew from his own experience that the tests started easy and got harder.  There was a reason the psych eval was the very last one; it was the hardest and had the highest rate of failure.
"Could be a threat.  ...or a warning," said Rhodes, studying the label.  "Could just be a shitty prank, people messing with Steve because he's an omega."
They hailed a cab and went back to Tony's place.
Karpov looked up.  The soldier was lying on the blond but wasn't moving.  "солдат? ...солдат?" He walked over and tapped on the glass loudly.
Steve leaned over, curling into himself as hands fisted in his hair. He shook his head. He was shaking. Happy looked concerned in the front seat but said nothing.
"A beta, so obviously, he can't attend.  But he's sympathetic to our organization," said Eric.  "Mind you, we get a bad rep from status extremists, like Status Alliance-- I know, I know Steve had friends there, I'm not saying they're all bad, just that they don't really portray us well, and the truth is, we do a lot of good work, donate to a lot of charities and provide education for omegas.  I don't think there's anything wrong with people who choose to live their lives a different way. Ask any omega here... they're
This chapter is dedicated to everyone who was scared about how the last chapter ended.  ;)
He came home at six AM, a splint on his thumb and two fingers.  He tip-toed up the stairs from the shop, although he knew this was ridiculous since Steve a) had super-hearing, b) was probably already up and aware Tony hadn't come to bed, c) would find out about the broken fingers soon enough anyway.
"Alphas aren't judged by their omegas. Please don't judge me my mate, Stone," Steve said softly in request and Ty seemed to gather himself a little, no longer frowning. Even if he disapproved of Tony, it was frankly none of his business. If he knew what Steve did for SHIELD he would probably disapprove of that too- but he didn't.
"Super ready!" yelled Tony back, making minute adjustments to himself in the mirror.  "Ready to rock n' roll.  ...I could use a drink, though.  God, I'm glad this is nearly over.  Not that I'm nervous.  I'm Tony goddamn Stark.  SHIELD needs me.  Hey, d'you think it's funny that you use a shield and they're called shield and like... like it's kind of connected?"  Tony was doing that thing he did when he was nervous, speaking all his thought outloud in one continuous train of thought.  He only paused in his monologue to wolf down the food Steve had prepared.
"Yes, sir."
"No can do, Tony.  I've got to attend a conference on geothermal energy this weekend, so I'll be out of the country until next month," said Reed, stretching across the table to shake Steve's hand.  "Although I was actually hoping to pick
Captain America to you!  Steve!  Lead the way!  O Captain, my captain!  ...mush!"  He staggered away from the bar, where Natasha looked torn between laughing and glaring, and Sam was shaking his head at them.
Steve sighed and was about to say something more when Tony was throwing up and saying shit that didn't make sense. Steve frowned. "I'm not mad at you." A lie. "Okay, maybe I am, but it's fine," Steve said and promptly moved to pick Tony up bridal style before the man could protest like he weighed of nothing more than a feather.
"Don't mind me, just gettin' a screwdriver," he said with a yawn, walking past them to root around in the fridge for some orange juice and vodka.
Tony reached up, weakly.  But he couldn't quite reach far enough.
Tony threw his hands up.  "And
She took it cautiously; Tony yanked her to her feet, slipped an arm around her waist, and whirled her around before dipping her.
thought Tony grimly.
.  A man held out a water bottle, tentatively. Steve took it without thinking and downed it and then one of the men promptly ran the butt of his gun into Steve's head, knocking him out.
.... I sound so stupid right now... shut up, Stark, shut up... no, I'm... I'm
That little hum of permission was all Steve needed to let go. It felt so good. So freaking good, and he was coming undone underneath Tony's grasp. The way he teased at Steve made him tremble and moan and it felt like Steve was floating. He aware of nothing but the feeling of Tony's mouth upon him.

"I don't know, but if I were you, I'd beef up my security protocols," said Rhodes.  "I'm gonna take this tag to Edwards and see if they can get any information from it."

He threw it automatically.

And then, thankfully, after that, things slowed down.  Steve received no more official SHIELD calls; Fury was silent, perhaps his way of making amends for Malick's indiscretion.
one's been getting most of the attention."  She nodded toward a woman with brown hair that tumbled down her back like a lion's mane.  She wasn't particularly short, nor tall, neither fat nor thin nor fit. In fact she was rather plain, aside from the incredible hair.  Clearly, efforts to pull it back had been in vain. There was, sure enough, a tiny crowd around her. The auction crowd was sticking close together, but some along the edges were mingling with the rest of the omegas.  There were about five who were chatting with the woman, who was standing there clasping a glass in both hands, nodding and sipping occasionally. Then she turned and Steve saw the interest had nothing to do with the hair at all; she had one brown eye and one blue eye.
"I'm getting the captain!"  A small Asian girl shouldered past the crowd toward the main room, where a solid block of bodies was dancing, or at least pulsing drunkenly, to the music.  "Steve-- I mean, Captain Rogers-- hey, Steve!"
Tony shivered as Steve knelt for him.  He reached out automatically to brush Steve's hair through his fingers, stroking him, silently praising him for his submission.  Steve's face looked peaceful; Tony felt his own body relaxing a little, the panic subsiding.  They were alone and yet they were with each other.  When it was like this, just the two of them, it was hard to think of any imminent threats, because everything seemed so perfect.
Thank you black_hippy for noticing that I posted this chapter on Part 1 by accident.  Whoops.  No more beer for breakfast.  - T
"Who's that?" he demanded, eyes narrowing at the woman in the green dress.
"We'll try a different one."  She held up another ink blot.
"That heat," said Tony.
He took the liberty of looking up Gleason's little support group while he had a moment alone.  It wasn't hard to find on the web. There was a phone number.
"Nothing," said Pepper sharply.  "...Aria, don't you have to go congratulate Jeff on Steve's behalf?"  She turned to Mackenzie. "The head of the Horseshoe Society just had twin beta girls."
Natasha got up and went to the front of the jet to take it off auto-pilot and maneuver it onto the base.
Tony stared at Steve in confusion.  He was still feeling groggy from the simulation.  He didn't know what "ideas" Steve was talking about.  He hated being out of the loop, but on the other hand, he was scared to ask.  And Steve had said he didn't want to hear it.
"You think it's so easy, don't you?  You think I can just go in there and find a chapter of contents, look up the page I want?  Ha! You have no
"...Miss Potts will see you out," he said, a bit stiffly, extending a hand to shake even though he hated shaking hands.
Tony heard a splash and cracked open one lazy eye.  Steve was on the side of the pool, arms folded on the deck, cheek on the ground, staring off into the distance.
"I don't need therapy," said Tony.
, Bucky was
"I'll get it," wheezed Tony, flopping out onto the deck and scrambling toward the kitchen to grab Steve's cell phone.  He flipped it open without checking who it was. "Whaddya want?"
Behind him, Pepper, who had made herself scarce with Aria and the bodyguards, snorted softly into the cup of water she had been drinking.
"I'm gonna make a call real quick," Steve said, his voice a little high pitched. He shot Tony a serious look.
"No, I... I want a drink," said Tony, glancing anxiously at Steve.  He was clinging to Steve's hand a little bit harder than necessary.
"Well, once I drank a whole bottle of whiskey." The night after Bucky had died. "I didn't feel anything."
"I'm not- I'm not sleeping in the bed if it feels like you don't want me in there."
Automatically, his brain had categorized the group.  Of eight people (including himself), there were five men and three women, six Alphas and two betas, and he was the third most dominant.  (Of course, if you discounted the betas, his ranking was three of six. But that was still pretty good.)
Steev let out a noise of relief when Tony returned, grabbing his hand when it was offered. He let his Alpha guide him up and stood. Steve almost fell. The throb between his legs made it hard to walk. When they got to the bath Steve had to reach out and shakily grip the ceramic edge but he steeled himself. He pulled himself up and into the bath with Tony's help and sighed in relief as the hot water engulfed him.
Everyone was in a suit, or at least a tie but the atmosphere wasn't overly serious. There was a sense of professionalism in the air but one lawyer was walking around in slippers, and many had their shirt buttons undone at the top and their ties pulled lose.
It was his agent. Aria.
They kept to the back of the class to attract the least attention. A woman clapped her hands and dragged everyone's attention to the front and the class began. The leader of the group was called Melinda and her voice was calming the instant she began talking. Aria and Steve sat down, listening as Melinda started talking about the importance of an 'aura', or something like that.
. I promise I'm safe. But please don't come here. If you come here, you'll get in trouble...and I don't want you to get in trouble. Buck, okay?" He tried to speak to him in a soothing voice, one he sincerely hoped the other would listen to.
He left Steve and Fury to argue while he began dragging boxes out from the server room.  It was an unused lower level to the shop where he stored most of JARVIS's hardware and a few generators for whenever he accidentally brought down the power grid around his house (once or twice a year, on average).  The boxes were heavy, laden with notebooks untouched for decades, and covered in dust.  Tony had some trouble managing them with his hurt leg, and when he sneezed, his ribs hurt.  As usual, physical discomfort was compartmentalized and ignored; Tony's mind was excellent at getting obsessed with ideas.
Steve was trembling with frustration, both the sexual and the angry kind. His hands flexed by his sides like he was ready to catch a punch, not like he really expected one was coming.
He shut the car door and then walked around to Tony's side as they walked in. The night staff fortunately paid little attention to them as they were caught up with some elderly guest who had lost her keycard. The ride up in the lift was quiet. When they got into the hotel room Steve dropped the case down and went straight into the bathroom to turn the shower on.
progressive.  I
Steve wanted to put his arms around Tony, but everything about his posture said he didn't want to be touched. It was getting cold, they should have brought proper coats, but they hadn't. Steve just stood by Tony, which was what he was supposed to do, and let his thoughts drift. He thought about what he could say to make Tony feel better but came up blank. He felt oddly useless and wasn't entirely sure he'd been brought along. Because he knew Howard? Was that it? All Steve felt like was a witness to Tony's grief- but if by somehow standing here he was making the other feel better, then it was worth it.
Tony's mouth on his neck felt nice.
They had unceremoniously deposited Steve's and Tony's limp forms on the poured concrete floor; Tony was attempting to drag himself over to Steve, still compelled to breed him.
Tony bristled.  "I don't want him anymore."
, and they would have gotten rid of it anyway, right?
Steve traced his fingers over the metal rim of the arc reactor under his shirt gently. He felt enraptured with it all over again, the blue glow in the dim room ethereal. Steve smiled faintly and his blue eyes flitted up to finally meet with Tony's again, the moment strangely intimate. Steve almost blushed again. Maybe he did a little, but it was hard to tell in the off-coloured light.
Right.  Not
He scrambled out of bed, going to the closet for a new suit; the one he'd worn earlier in the day was crumpled on the floor.  "...can you grab me a shot from the fridge? I need to take the edge off..." Tony was still groggy and was having a hard time composing himself. Knowing he faced an evening talking with the likes of Malick and Frond didn't exactly make him feel any better.
JARVIS had been busy.
He bet they weren't even doing anything to help Bucky like they said they would. Steve bet they'd just shoved him in a freezer and had hoped he wouldn't be a problem anymore.
"That...kind of makes sense," Steve conceded. "I guess they're not really necessary now though, huh? I like to think most people have a semblance of self-control." Maybe when they weren't being controlled by psychological warfare anyway. He went quiet for a moment, laying his head down. Steve trailed a finger down Tony's arm, over the bumps of muscle and tanned skin. He was really quite pale in comparison. Steve didn't tan much. Howard had once described him as 'golden' but Steve figured he more meant the hair than the rest of them. Before the serum he used to get terrible sunburn. Bucky was always making him wear stupid hats or dragging him out of the sun and into the shade.
Nate let out an undignified sound when Steve picked him up. "Tony? Can you tell medical we're on our way?"
His footsteps made a slow, hollow clanking noise as he approached the open area.  Several drones stood there, faceless, lifeless.  Hammer was there, looking shocking unconcerned with the situation.  A second suit was there, the long whips trailing from its arms ominously.  A woman he didn't know, looking lithe and dangerous in tactical gear; there was a SHIELD patch on her upper arm.
Tony looked over at Steve in alarm.  Were they supposed to just... run over and shoot everyone in the head?  These guys looked pretty harmless but if they were, Fury wouldn't have asked Captain America to intervene.  They must be armed. Or perhaps even mutants, though at a glance they all looked perfectly normal.
"Buck?" He whispered. "Buck, get off. You're hurting me. Get off."
Tony cocked his head.  Pepper?  Offering to give him alcohol?  ...something wasn't right.
"Hello?"
Steve settled into his seat opposite Tony and resisted the childish urge to put his shoes up on the table just because he could. "Since when were supposedly dead war heroes still 'crushes' in the 21st century?"
"Ginny," Happy said. "That's why I use it."
"I thought he was a bear," said Pietro, staring intensely at STeve.
Back in Long Island, Steve's jaw had dropped.
"Nick isn't impressed that I replied to the RVSP. Can I just say, he knew within an hour, which is just
"Yes, sir," said JARVIS.  One of the benefits of JARVIS being a program is that he was wholly incapable of judging Tony or questioning him when he made seemingly eccentric demands.
"No, Tony.  I'm not mad anymore.  We're friends," reassured Tiberius.
Tony snorted softly, remembering the poster he'd had of Captain America, how he'd longed to be a tough, dominant Alpha like the man in the poster.  Oh, irony.  The look of bliss on Steve's face was nothing like the stern, patriotic expression of Poster-Steve.  Tony wondered if his father had ever considered telling him.
Tony made a noise of frustration and pitched the gin bottle across the room.  "I don't
Freud, thanks for noticing that!" said Tony, his voice rising to almost a shout.  "Hey, newsflash for all the omegas at the table, you think my dad was a real hero, huh?  Well, he wasn't, he was a cold, calculating drunk and all the smiles he put on for the cameras were faked.  Oh, and while we're at it, Santa Claus isn't real, either.  Welcome to reality, jackasses."  Tony stood, then reached for the suitcase full of syringes.
Tony huffed indignantly.  Steve couldn't know his reputation for drinking.  Tony showed up to conferences all the time, got plastered, and still gave wildly intelligent lectures on circuits and aerospace.  He was the whiz kid!  Also, how bad did it look for an omega to be ordering him around?
Even after Bucky laid back down, he remained awake for a long, long time.
"Oh my God! Is that him? Is that Mr. Stark?" Sixteen asked in a whisper, leaning into Steve's space. "Are you sure he won't buy me?"
again, but I don't  want to boss you around or sleep with you.  You can just hang out in the living room and watch TV and if your Alpha asks you can tell him we got up to all sorts of depraved things, but I really don't want you.  If you stay here, it's for your benefit, not mine... aw, geez, come on, don't..." DeSoto's face crumpled and he literally looked like he wanted to cry at being told he wasn't wanted.  "...I mean, I'm sure there's...
Steve was being dragged back into the house before he knew what was happening.
"Tony,
Steve didn't really remember Howard being 'funny'. He made women around him laugh a lot. And Steve always laughed it off all the times he half came onto him...but he couldn't really remember him ever saying anything
Tony growled at her.  Around him, he heard Steve's name being said, whispered.
"I care about how people see you too, you know," said Steve sincerely, and he squeezed Tony's hand gently.
"Trickshot was really bad," supplied one of the teens behind Tony.  "One time he kicked me in the balls."
"So this is the new thing, huh?" asked Rhodes, hands in his pockets.  Pepper had finally gotten ahold of him.  He'd dropped everything and come; the last few weeks he'd spent putting out fires, going to meetings with the Secretary of Defense, the Senate, trying to keep Tony from being arrested.  Having someone as unstable as him in possession of multiple armored suits was difficult to argue for.  One of the suits was sitting in a hangar at Edwards, having already shot several people who tried to pick it apart.  It had been two years since Tony stopped Stark Industries from manufacturing weapons, but he was still a weapons designer himself.  There was no masking the suit for anything other than a weapon, and a deadly one, too.  No matter what Tony said.
Yes.  This was it... the perfect conclusion to his life story.  The perfect, final chapter.
"Are you an acer?"
"Steve's reputation is fine," said Tony dismissively.  "I literally told everyone we would release a sex tape like, two days ago.  People are probably expecting me to corrupt him.  After all, I'm... me.  Rhodes, go see if you can get any info off the card.  I'll try to salvage the chip later.  I want to know who the fuck sent it."  He paused.  "It's a hybrid gemstone orchid.  Westerlay Nursery is the only place that sells green orchids.  Have SHIELD check their records."
"...Hello? Steve?  Are you there?"
The omega came to him and reached out and he was touching his face, but that didn't make it better.  Bucky was feeling some weird emotion, something he hadn't felt in a long time, and he didn't like it at all; it made his throat feel tight and his stomach hurt and his face was wet.
He climbed into the back seat of the SUV.
The soldier gave a small, brisk nod of thanks.
"Can I come shower with you?" asked Tony.
Okay.  Okay, he was fine.  He was okay.
"Naw.  Even the other Howlies didn't know we were bonded."
"They went to get ice cream," she called.
"Whoa, whoa, whoa!" protested Sam, nearly dropping him.  Tony was a mess; the sight of Steve's limp body instantly caused him to start wailing.
He didn't have time to recover; he was yanked back up and slammed down again.  Augmented reality was down; the screen was mostly static.  The suit couldn't handle the amount of electricity that was being dumped into it; the other man's reactor was, at a glance, probably producing about as much power as the Three Gorges Dam, and unless Tony could deactivate it, he was royally screwed.
"Well, make me some coffee," demanded Tony petulantly.
Tony felt small and sick and useless.
He came with him; the two of them rode it out together, twitching and spasming together.
Aria leaned into Pepper, giggling. She was way too drunk. "Oh my God. That SHIELD guy Pep, I'm gonna kiss him. I'm gonna kiss him at midnight--"
"Malick... Malick..." repeated Tony, trying to remember who the hell that was.  "...oh, right, Gideon. He was at that presidential dinner. You know, all of those World Council people seem like they have a stick up their asses.  Him, Fury, Pierce, the one Chinese guy-- Yen? Yin? Something like that. And the chick and the other three. ...they're all uptight. And not an omega in the bunch.  ...you can handle him, though, Steve. I mean, we're both basically fired from SHIELD and they can't throw you in jail, the people would riot. He'll probably just bitch at you and that'll be there."
Downstairs, Tony's sense of contentedness was short-lived; he plucked at the guitar for a while, then, itching for something to do, looked over some of the notes scattered over his desk.  Tony was awful at note-taking.  His father's careful, delicate lab notebooks were the exact opposite of Tony's style.  Tony wrote notes on whatever was handy; he relied on JARVIS to help him digitize and organize it later.  Notes were scrawled on scrap paper, napkins, sticky notes... anything handy.
"We don't have-"
"It's been a rough week, but yes," he said, feeling almost uncomfortable the question. Steve didn't want to talk about this with Tony's old school friend.
"...it was a lab accident.  That's all. Okay? Work-related.  That's it." Tony went back to rooting around in the fridge, perhaps a little more aggressively than before.
"Tony--" Steve paused as his underwear was tugged down. "What are we doing here exactly?"
He let off two more rounds when he could, then there was more smoke and Tony gave up trying to hit anything.  He knew he'd gotten at least two and that Steve had taken down plenty. He heard an engine start, then cut.
"ARMANDO!" hollered Tony.
to mate you.  You have no idea.  He put himself through hell not to, just because he was scared of hurting you, and because he made a promise that he wasn't willing to break."  Tony was still staring off into the middle distance it was too hard to face Steve right now. "I love you. And I wanted to be the only one with that right.  I wanted to be your only mate. But I'm not, and I don't even care, Steve, because these last two months have been some of the worst in my entire life. I mean, not quite as bad as Afghanistan, but definitely in the top ten.  And I would rather share you than lose you completely. And you deserve to know that even if he was an ignorant asshole, like me, well... he loved you, Steve."
"You kidding me?" demanded Natasha.  "Steve's being held captive in a HYDRA base and you're thinking about
Tony's eyes narrowed and he paused, breathing through his mouth, trying to find Malick's scent.  More dominant Alpha... and, yes, unbonded.
The last time Tony had uttered those words, it had been to a Hot Pocket.  Tony Stark did not "love" people.  He loved cars, money, food, electronics... not omegas.
Gleason got a funny little smile and rose.  "Well, I'll take my leave. Have fun and make sure he takes the levonorgestrel with food."
"And don't be drunk. Or swear. Or mention sex," Aria said before she pushed Steve towards the stage. He nodded, trying to get serious about this. He wasn't quite in the state Tony was and he could be rational enough that he didn't want to embarrass himself.
They walked up to the front door, a heavy wooden one, which Lawrence tried and found locked.  He pushed the buzzer next to it, which had a neat little plaque above it that said
"That's why we're here," said Jeff.  "The Horseshoe Society is volunteering sixty full-time coordinators."
He considered making a speech.
Donner clung onto that thought. Every night, before he went to bed, he told himself
"What... what about the bullet wound?"
"Where's Tony? Where did he go?" Pepper demanded cutting him off, her eyes wide as a suit flew past them. It was quick but Steve saw a flash of red- it was Tony, not Rhodey. The crowd, once jubilant, was now stampeding in every direction without any clear idea of where to go; they simply wanted away from the main stage, where the armed sentinels, once standing stock-still in tidy ranks, were now abandoning, clanking away in every direction, their motives unclear.
There was a long silence.
"What happened to you what shit. Unequivocally shit. And some of what you've said actually makes a lot of sense."
Steve shrugged. "They're alright."
"This is my house!  Don't
Steve cracked open an eye and turned his head sideways to look at Tony. "I know you liked looking at it. But it's still
"...are you on drugs?"
Upstairs, Pepper was sipping her tea contentedly.
Alphas takes him, or Alderdice," said Marcus.
"I do, Tony.  I swear."
Steve glanced at the uniform in the closet and his chest burned with the overriding feeling of shame that he felt. He suddenly realized he was an international news story; had Peggy heard about this? What did she think? Jesus. He'd disappointed her. He'd let her down...and that hurt more than anything else. Steve hadn't realized he'd been standing in the doorway with a pair of trousers in his hands for over two minutes until he was pulled back by the sound of Tony's voice.
"Uh..."  Tony racked his brain.  He had never stayed on top of status issues; after all, they only really affected omegas, not Alphas.  "...I don't think he's really too involved with it.  I mean... now that you guys can, y'know, vote and go to college and stuff... well... no one really thinks about it.  I mean... I mean, y'know, whenever there's like a big news story, whenever there's a hate crime, he probably gives a statement or something..."
Tony looked down at his scotch, which was two-thirds finished.  He wondered if he ought to order another.
She also had a point about tests being easy to cheat.  With a week to figure out how to do it, Tony was sure he could pretty easily swing the psych eval.  Plus, he would be going in without Steve there to muck everything up.  It was Steve who was connected to the Winter Soldier, not him.  If he could just find a way to bury his bond with Steve, the rest of his brain would be fine.
community probably does to them?  Plus, DeSoto's a perfect source of info... his Alpha's last omega got sent there and he knew him!"
He nearly dropped his tray.
"Oh my God."
"It's not a good time for you either," Gleason pointed out. "And they're dead. You, however, are very much still alive."
"JARV, set a route for Steve's apartment, I think he lives on Wilshire... somewhere in Westwood?"
"...I feel like I'm a loser, for not being able to find these glands.  And I'm thinking about... what Frond said, about my, y'know, about my dad.  ...he smelled like me, didn't he? But more dominant. ...I bet
"Four," corrected Tony.  "Killed four. And injured eight.  Seriously, I can suit up right now and fly over there and--"
or was that something else?  ...you know what, I don't care.  You're obviously gonna do whatever you want and... you know, like you said to that girl at Cartier, you do you.  Y'know? You're a big... omega role model. Nothing drives that point home better than getting an Alpha like me and just cutting him down a ton."
"How would
Tony looked down.  Steve was kneeling.
"Are you kidding?" asked Aria; black smoke was still pouring from the basement door.
"What?"  Pepper blinked.  "Who, Danielle? I don't know, it might be nice to have Status Alliance work with Steve's charity--"
If it weren't for the fact that Natasha was standing on the porch, holding up a hand in greeting, Steve would have assumed he was somehow in the wrong place.
Tony was currently in Steve's lap, nosing at the bruise on Steve's neck, licking his gland, as if he could fix it somehow.  Maria, as a beta, had no idea what was prompting his behavior, but knew well enough that it was something intimate, and was looking up prudishly, hands clasped before her.
"It's the heats too." Steve sighed. "Because of the... high risks. It would be easier."
Vanko was writhing beneath him; his arc reactor was nearly dead, and without an external power source, the suit was too heavy for him to control, but one of the whips was wrapped around him like an electrified anaconda and it was scrambling nearly every single of one Tony's systems.
Tony glanced over and immediately regretted it.  It was like some fucking goatse shit and he nearly puked.  On the plus side, his hackles went down.
Pepper's eyes widened.  "
"Oh, I'm
"That's not what I meant."
Tony reached for a notebook and flipped it open.  "Ah-ha!  Genetics!  Exactly the sort of thing you can explain to me real quick.  Go on."
"Couldn't feel you?" repeated Karpov, pressing him for more information.
Karpov wasn't surprised they were resorting to this method.  All of them underestimated the asset. They always had. He felt a bitter sort of triumph knowing that they would eventually realize just how useful he'd been, how underappreciated.  But he doubted it would be anytime soon. It would only be once they had some use for him that wasn't breeding that they would come to their senses and see what an incredible loss they'd incurred.  And then they'd be sorry. They had underestimated Karpov, underestimated his program and his asset. Well, now they wouldn't have him anymore, and they would be left with the unpredictable, destabilized soldier to contend with.  Serve them right.
Tracy grinned. "Both."
"What incident?"
He tried to elbow him. He kicked at him. He went to grab a knife at his waist but Bucky slammed his arm down with his other, Steve's other arm trapped under his own hip. "No! No! Bucky! Please!"
Steve threw a snowball right against Clint's chest. Cooper laughed in delight.
"You're kidding me.  After the party and the way you've been acting all week, you expect him to hand you that suit back?"
was right," said Tony calmly.  "Captain Omega.  Boy, that's one hell of a revelation.  ...Happy is gonna be delighted.  He's been standing up for the journalistic integrity of that rag of a mag for years."  He cleared his throat.
He rinsed Steve's hair tenderly and ran over his body with a washcloth, working the tension out of his muscles, drinking in his physique with the sort of attention he normally reserved for building circuit boards.
"Hey.  Steve."  Tony sat on the bed next to Steve and wrapped his arms around him.  "You don't always gotta... you know. You know that, right?"
Almost prophetically, there was a beep from the front door and another member of the house staff walked in, two orchids in each arm.  She set them down and then went back for more.
Donner looked concerned about the blatant dismissal of the Alphas by the omegas.  Clearly, he'd never been to a party where everyone acted like equals. Or perhaps not even equals... because of the strong influence of Status Alliance, a lot of the omegas seemed smugly superior to the Alphas.  They clustered up in friendly groups, overly touchy and playful with each other, occasionally chuckling at the silliness of Alphas and how much they cared about dominance. A lot were unbonded. Two, Steve had already noticed, were unapologetically in pre-heat and flirting with Alphas, eating cups of crushed ice and looking flushed but happy.
He nudged Steve's shoulder.  It was weird for Steve to sleep later than him.  Steve looked okay, if a little been worn out.  "Steve.  Wake up," he said, sitting up and nudging his mate again.  Something twisted in his gut when he realized the sheets, once white, were spotted with blood.  He pushed them off the omega.  The bandage on his leg was no longer white; it looked kind of like the Japanese flag.  Between his legs there were a few crimson smudges.
"C'mon.  Let's go get a drink, watch a movie," said Tony, rising.  He offered the omega his hand.
He stepped forward and put a hand on Steve's head; his hair was damp with sweat.  He guided Steve's head to his thigh and Steve pressed his face into the fabric of Tony's pants.  Tony automatically began petting him, heart hammering. The confrontation was over and now... now what?
On the range, Tony had switched from a rifle to a handgun.  The popping sound of gunfire floated over them.
"Are you sober?"
Steve went back to take another armful of flowers off of Tony. "There aren't  any other honeymoon traditions in this century, are there?" He asked. "If there are we only have a day or so to get them done and I know we're not really doing it like that but..." He shrugged.
After several more goodbyes and smiles they left, stepping back into the lift and then heading out into the carpark. Steve got into the drivers seat, figuring Tony wouldn't want to drive anyway after his mini breakdown.
"Yeah, I figured that out," said Tony, dragging a hand across his face.  He looked over at Steve. "...Steve, what is it
Get over it.  You wanna talk about anxieties?  Fine. You wanna be a good omega? Fine.  Count 'em. Count these fucking scars, look me in the eye, tell me what they represent, how I got them, why they're there... and then tell me you actually want me, as an Alpha.  Because right now, all I'm getting is that you want someone less broken, more dominant. Maybe you're confusing me with my dad, I don't know." Tony stared down at Steve, expression steely.
He stared at Steve for a moment, then pounced playfully on him, biting his ear and giving it a tug.
"I think that modern day omegas should be free to make their own choices. I'm free to make all of my choices."
Steve looked up and Tony realized, too late, that it wasn't Steve.  It also wasn't one of the HYDRA guys. It was some guy in a black suit, a heavy belt on, bristling with knives and guns and ropes and tasers.  On his chest were eight dark red lines, a cross and an X, and through the smoke, Tony got a whiff of unbonded omega.
happy with having Steve compromised.  Worse, they were now worried about the possibility of other bonded omegas being compromised.  Notably... Clint.
And then Steve sank back under, letting the words hang in there. He wanted Tony to think about what he said, not just get defensive off the bat. Because that wouldn't get them anywhere.
"--WiFi?"
Lydia turned to get another collar, and Tony sidestepped to get a look at the back of her neck, curiosity overwhelming him.
"...and book Pepper and Aria a vacation.  Maybe somewhere in France or Italy, somewhere they can get away.  Slap together an itinerary. They need a break."
Sam stepped forward from where he'd been leaning against the wall and put a hand on Rhodey's shoulder, tugging him back a few steps.
inept with technology..." Steve sighed and handed him his computer.
"You have an alibi.  You had an emotional reaction, destroyed your tracker, and spent the day with Banksy and Ty.  Tony's idea. The two of them are both vouching for your whereabouts."
"No, no, no, this was just for now, I gotta keep working, I'm really close, Steve'll tell you, the suit--"
him.  It was the first time he had ever
"Yes.  Yes, they are," agreed Tony, running his hands up and down Steve's forearms soothingly.  "But you can't break the rules or you'll get us kicked out, and we have to be here at least long enough for the auction.  We have to help the omegas here, Steve. We can't give them an excuse to kick us out and that's what you're doing. Why the hell were you running off, anyway?  Because of Gideon and Hammer fighting over that guy who looked like you? ...look, that was before they even
George and Danielle both rushed over to him, but Banksy was beyond words; he just kept wailing.  And Donner's face went white, and he turned and looked at Steve. "--the bond broke," he said softly.  Of course Donner knew what that felt like. Danielle herself was unbonded and George was still bonded to his old Alpha, Luke.  Steve had only experienced it once, very, very briefly, in Yemen, the sudden empty silence as part of the soul flickered out like a flame in the wind.
With some awkward negotiating to get Tony out of the picture Phil managed to snap a few pictures of Steve's neck and the bruise there. "What's going to happen?" Steve asked. "Are they gonna fire him?"  He didn't bother trying to keep the hopefulness out of his voice.  He wanted justice served; the
"I don't remember," said Bucky, voice rough with emotion.
"None of them appear to have punctured anything vital.  You're very lucky, Captain," the doctor informed him.
"Steven Grant Rogers, you put that shirt back on!" hissed Aria.
The drive was mostly peaceful. Steve made it clear he didn't want to talk about the Winter Soldier in his vision before, and that he didn't know why he was there. He was honestly frustrated with SHIELD that they wouldn't just
They both laughed a little awkwardly.
Steve's shoulders shook. His neck throbbed as he ducked his head down again, screwing his eyes shut as hot tears balled up around his eyes. God, why was he crying? He wasn't a child. He was a grown-ass man.
"My two favorite boys," she said, beaming, giving Steve's arm an affectionate squeeze.  "And just in time, I just put on the kettle..."
"Maybe Bucky wasn't human anymore. You said you stopped feeling him," Natasha pointed out, tone gentle. "It's possible that whatever Zola did to him meant he could survive the fall...hell Steve, look at what
"Time to get up. Interview's today," he murmured.
He heard a door slam.  Karpov and the driver were getting out.  He peeked out the back; they were at a gas station in the middle of nowhere.  It was mid-morning.
"...be my guest.  Turn the place inside-out," said Tony, opening the door for them.  The SWAT team looked disappointed they weren't going to be needed. The suits swept in, paused momentarily at the sight of the hundreds of orchids, then began roaming the house.  Tony watched them, arms crossed with annoyance. He was actually getting to the point where he was looking forward to leaving the country for a week, even if it meant Aunt Peggy--
It was 1944 all over again, he and Bucky screaming at each other in France while the rest of the Howlies took smoke breaks; after Azzano, Bucky had come back different, moody, and their bond had been broken, and they'd called each other "Barnes" and "Rogers" as if they'd never been bonded at all.
Gleason frowned.  "Has he been eating?"
Donner looked up and his expression changed.  "You're Tom Banksy!" he exclaimed, his voice finally above a whisper.  Still soft, but less so.
me!  There was a fucking
Natasha and Sam nodded sympathetically.
talk to me about omega rights again.  You’re not my pal, okay, Sparks?  I don’t owe you anything.  This is a purely professional relationship.  You’re my assistant.  End of story.  Speaking of assisting, I’m gonna need two white tigers for my birthday next week and a smoothie this afternoon.  Double shot of chlorophyll in that, got it?”
"Oh, great, thank--" began Tony, but stopped.  The name on the card was for Madeline Turner, not Gene Bennett.  "--wait, you gave me the wrong--"
coming from?
His mouth was still on Steve's neck but he was making a conscious, strong effort not to bite down hard.  He wasn't tasting anything weird, so he guessed it was working.
Tony felt like the only thing keeping from from having a legitimate heart attack was probably the arc reactor.
If he could just maintain this for the rest of his life, things might not be so bad.
Doug!  We're gonna transfer you the money and we'll be in touch, okay!"
Lowenstein & Schaedler was a legal firm whose big claim to fame was representing Tony Stark.  Tony was a high-profile client and also an excellent proving ground for new junior partners. Lowenstein had been the head of Tony's legal team for the last nine years, since he was 41.  He had personally gotten Tony off on charges he'd incured after crashing a Lamborghini into the Bellagio Fountain, with the argument that Tony Stark was of such great intelligence and so aneurotypical that he had been suffering from temporary insanity at the time of the accident, caused by over-stimulation from the night lights of Vegas.  He'd even gotten Stephen Strange on the stand to testify. (Dr. Strange had begrudingly conceded that it was "possible" but that he, as an aneurotypical person himself, would never be caught dead crashing a Lamborghini.) The "Stark Defense" was now widely taught in law schools around the world, in the same chapter as "Affluenza."
"Huh?  Oh," said Boswell.  "Yes, yes, go ahead, have a drink."
Tony gently climbed in next to him and lay down beside him, reaching out to pet his hair.
"If he knows where you are, you need to leave.  Now. He's dangerous."
"Excellent.  ...is that going to be enough?" he asked, nodding into the cell, where the soldier still had Steve pinned and was drawing his ninth tube of blood.
"Tony?" repeated Pepper.  Tony was just standing there, staring at Steve and Phil.
Just because there was no visible mark on his neck didn't give him the right to pretend like it had never happened.  Like it was nothing.  Maybe someday, Steve would let another mate take him, and conveniently forget all about Tony, too.  Pepper's voice was still distantly chattering.  "Anthony Edward Stark.  Come on.  That was another life ago.  Steve needs you now.  Steve probably feels awful about all this too.  Don't you owe it to him to talk it over?  Natasha said if you want him, you should fight for him.  You do want your omega, don't you?"
"We can't shake them on city streets," said Kate.
"--it's
Tony's need for privacy was a legitimate one.  With shaking hands, he eased out the arc reactor.  The core was a repulsive mess of corroded metal and foul-smelling, inorganic discharge.  It was almost enough to make him sick.  The bruising on his veins was prominent and painful.  He checked his blood toxicity: 67%.  He no longer felt like masturbating.  He told JARVIS to throw on some music and flopped onto one of the couches in the basement, falling asleep almost immediately to disjointed, arousing, dark dreams of Steve.
Steve's eyes fluttered open and he looked down at Tony at the sound of his name. The look on his face was heady and blissful, his lips parted a fraction. "I'm not stopping you," he assured him, aroused by the way the word
And he had brought this on
anymore.
"Sounds very handy!" said Banksy, wiggling his eyebrows suggestively at them.
though. And Steve knew what it meant.
Tony stared, dead-eyed for a moment, then nodded.  "Okay. Well, let's find him, then."
"No thank you," Steve whispered, shaking his head slowly when he was offered the cigarettes. His knees were drawn up against his chest tightly, his hands resting atop of them. He was curled in on himself and his stance was evidently defensive. Steve was ready if Bucky struck out again.
because someone doesn't like me," Steve muttered, rubbing at his eyes. He hated crying in front of other people. It made him feel like a child. "I just... I didn't survive crashing a plane into the ocean and then seventy years under the ice just to watch an omega oppressing himself. They're assaulting him and he's just-- I thought he would be so relieved, you know? I thought he would be so happy to get out of there. But he's not...he's just afraid, afraid of the world. Someone beat the ambition out of him and it makes me so
"Ha-ha, yeah, well... you know what they say, tragedy plus time equals comedy... Morgan, can you give me and him some alone time, please?"
Then the song came on,
Steve was blushing a little at Tony's hands. He let out a pleased sound when he touched his cock. "So, it's your birthday..."
Clearly fed up, Aria had lit a cigarette.  Tony was too distracted by Steve's smell to even notice.
Tony grinned.  "You can work out naked if you want.  I won't complain."
"I really can't, my Alpha--"
"...meet you back at the camp, Stevie," he called.
"Oooh and this guy wants to do edgy pre-heat interviews next time you,
began playing.
Bucky's left arm whipped out and his hand wrapped around Sam's wrist.  "No..." he slurred. "Don't take... don't touch... Steve..."
.  Isn't that the bullshittiest sound bite you ever heard in your life, Steve?
"Great.  Bring me that, then," demanded Tony, pressing his face back into the back of Steve's neck.  Faintly, he could smell blood. He nuzzled the bonding mark and gave it a tender lick of apology, even though he knew he wasn't entirely to blame.  Steve had seen him go into a panic more than a few times. And Steve seemed to understand. Steve had his own demons to fight; he had lost it during the opening sequence of
He cleared his throat and cracked open the door a little. "Erm, do you maybe want to... put some clothes on?" Steve croaked.
"...yes, Miss Potts."
Steve tilted his head at them, frowning. "What? You think I
Jealously issues. Ha.  A whole day of being told what a lousy omega he was was actually getting to him.  He should probably work on that.  Talk to a sane omega later, someone like Phil who would set him straight.
He pulled him down the corridor towards the canteen.
Steve was quiet for a while as he let those last words sink in. Let the real meaning clear into his mind. He wordlessly reached over and took Tony's hand, squeezing his fingers around the other's. A strange dull sort of rage uncoiled in his belly and made him almost squirm. It made Steve want to pepper Tony's face with kisses and punch a wall at the same time. But he was scared of saying the wrong thing, so he was quiet for a while. He was here, with Tony. That was what counted.
The soldier breathed against the omega's neck quietly, still not moving.
Steve was having none of it; he was already jogging down a fight of stairs.  Tony followed unhappily.
The forest was strangely quiet...it was dark, the early morning light barely dusting the sky that poked through the tree leaves. The ground beneath him was wet and heavy and Steve felt slow just jogging across it. He went quickly, hands twitching by his sides as he weaved through the trees. It was almost easy to pretend that Bucky and HYDRA weren't a problem like this, that he hadn't had a miscarriage. It was just him and the trees, and it was eerily quiet.
Was Tony saying he had feelings for him? Was he? Was that the issue? That he couldn't just fuck Steve and move on? Steve didn't want that, obviously. He wanted commitment in his life...especially after he'd lost almost everyone he'd cared about. But Steve had a feeling- an itch at the back of his neck- that he would do about anything Tony asked for him. He would kneel again, he would- what
her I wanted to get a vasectomy, why wasn't the scheduled earlier?  Fuck... nngg..." He strained a little, giving one last tug, but Steve whined and he stopped.
. And it was true. Steve didn't think he needed to say it aloud, his voice quite lost to him but Tony didn't move. He was waiting. Something warmed in Steve's chest. Maybe Tony wasn't as much as asshole as he tried to make the world think he was. It was nice...it was good to see it. Steve liked seeing the real him.
"Fuck what up?" asked Tony through a mouthful of noodles.  "You're doing great, Steve, there's nothing to worry about.  People treat omegas like crap, everyone knows that.  You stirred things up... that's gotta make things better, right?"
He was having trouble parsing out what had really happened and what hadn't.  Steve had said they couldn't feel each other anymore.  But was that outside of Baby's or was that in a field of tulips in France or was that just an hour ago when Fury had welcomed him on to the team?  Or had that never happened at all?
"We're not doing good enough, though.  We need to be better."
Tony reached out to Steve's neck, slowly, and put a hand over the back of Steve's neck, keeping his fingers away from the scent glands.  Gently, he stroked the short, soft hair on the back of Steve's head.
a slave?" asked JARVIS suddenly.
"Well, babies do that sometimes.  Ty, can you hold her while I get cleaned up?" asked Pepper, holding out the baby.  Tiberius stepped back, holding up his hands.
Steve realised he'd gotten close, too close, but didn't feel he could pull away. He was breathing a little heavily and leaning on Bucky because it was still hard to stand.
was in his early twenties.
Steve stare down at the letter in his hand and then carefully set it down on the table next to one of the first bunches of orchids. "We need to get someone to search through all these. I imagine that Mark isn't the only one writing to us for help..."
Tony was feeling groggy but significantly more well-rested than he had that morning.  He pressed himself against Steve, noting dully that he had morning wood-- more accurately, late afternoon wood-- and that the back of Steve's thigh felt incredible when he rubbed against it.  He was half-asleep.  Aware enough to know this probably constituted "funny business" but sleepy and aroused enough not to care very much.
"Tony, you're the only one here who runs on batteries.  You're welcome to shirk your duties but Stan and I have to deal with the fallout from--"
Sex and tinkering were pretty much on par for Tony.  If Steve wasn't down to clown around then Tony could get his screws elsewhere, in the form of literal screws.
"Seriously, what is your deal with me? I know you don't 'approve' of me of whatever bullshit and I know you don't approve of SHIELD initiatives, but what did I ever do to you personally that has made you so goddamn petty?"
"...I thought omegas synced up," said Tony suddenly.  "...is... is that a thing?  Do you and Coulson and Barton...?"  He wasn't sure if it was rude to ask.  The idea of a mixed-status team with a bunch of synched-up omegas sounded like a terrible idea to him, but SHIELD seemed to take pride in being diverse.  Their director was black, their assistant director female, and half their agents were omegas.  Tony wouldn't have been at all surprised if the next recruit was a wheelchair-bound Asian.  They looked like an equality poster on display at a public library, reminding people that people were people, regardless of race, gender, creed, status, or sexual orientation.  It was sweet in kind of annoying, preachy way.
"So you asked me out because you wanted a girlfriend, right?  Or at least... the company of a woman. Right?"
m-monsters under the bed," managed Tony, still gasping slightly for air.  "--and this is a cot. Not a bad. But they're right." He curled up slightly.
In the MCU, Steve was born in 1920; in the comics, however, he was born in 1918.  We went with the comic canon birth year of 1918.
By the time Josephine was finished, Steve was no longer worried about strangers looking at him, and he let them drag he and Tony to and fro, fussing over their skin and nails and hair.
"Okay, okay, fine," grumbled Steve.
"Mr. Stark, any comments for us today about your stance on nuclear proliferation?" asked a reporter, shoving a microphone into Tony's face.
like I'm in my forties.  I feel like I'm still in my early thirties.  Maybe thirty-four or thirty-five,
"A sketch book and a pencil would be swell, actually," Steve said when Gleason offered. He was like Tony. He hated just
She seemed even more confused about why Tony Stark and Captain America would be at a dive bar on Frying Pan Avenue for Tony's birthday.  "Didn't you blow up your house on your last birthday?" she asked.
Alpha, that Steve should definitely consider Tony as his newest mate. Because, in addition to being capable and willing and eager to throw himself off of buildings and get into fights with other Alphas, Tony could also be incredibly selfless and caring and would trip over himself to do whatever Steve wanted, as long as Steve indicated what that was.
Steve didn't say anything. He just gripped the edge of the sofa tightly.
It was funny how different they were.  Steve had grown up poor, and Tony rich.  Steve believed in people and principles, and Tony in math and machines.  Steve rarely swore (except in bed) and hardly drank at all, whereas Tony... well.
now?"
Sometimes Steve felt acutely aware of the fact that Tony was older and going to die first.  Sure, he wasn't working for SHIELD anymore but they wanted regular blood samples so they could try and figure out if he
He should've gotten the damn vasectomy.
"Well, yes. We wanted to invite you,
"DANI!" he barked.  "MADDIE!  One of you, grab me a drink, stat!  ...and some hair gel!"
Despite the weirdness of Tony's habits, Steve had come to appreciate that there was a method to his madness.  Every whim had some basis behind it.  Tony had spent the last week getting eight hours of sleep, burning sage and patchouli, drinking kombucha, meditating, working out, and choking down health food that was of questionable origin.  Malibu was like a Mecca for pseudo-nutrition and fad diets and fashionable workout regimes; Steve watch Tony bounce between yoga and tai chi and krav maga without any of his usual irony, and eat kale and quinoa with barely a word of complaint.  A bottle of probiotics appeared in their medicine cabinet, followed by another one of serotonin supplements and then a third with fish oil capsules.
Tony huffed again unhappily.  Maybe, he reassured himself, with time, he could be Steve's only Alpha, somehow.  After all, Bucky had to be old... maybe the guy would die soon.
"Wait, you're okay with this?" Steve checked. "You think this is a good idea?"
It wasn't just the reactor.  It was the half-inch of scarring around the base plate.  Before the arc reactor, Tony's chest had been hooked up to a fucking car battery.  Half the nerves were fried, and the flesh surrounding the original shrapnel wounds was melted into pale, raised whorls of pink.  It was not a pretty sight.
"Tony.  You and Steve are going to have a wonderful Christmas," Pepper reassured him, smoothing down his tie.  "I promise."
"Yeah.  Okay!  Okay.  Let's... let's get to work," said Tony, avoiding Steve's eyes.
"He was quite insistent on calling it that," piped up JARVIS.
They'd been in France.
"It was a wake-up call alright," Steve whispered. "He's trying so hard. He's been so...good about it. It's almost scary. He tries to touch my neck so I know it's okay but I..."
Damage control.  That was what they needed.  Tony was going to have to call Rhodes, call Pepper, call his press coordinator and his social media rep and make sure everyone was running a consistent story.
Come to think of it, Tony's whole body was a train wreck.  The small, circular scar on the back of his neck, the one that matched those on his arms and shoulders and back; faint criss-crossings on his sides and back and chest; the uncomfortable pop-crunch his right shoulder had done ever since he dislocated it in Afghanistan...
Tony turned to Steve.  "You wanna fly?" he offered, holding out an arm and gesturing.  It was an olive branch, the best one he could provide at the moment.  He didn't want the two of them to be furious at each other.
"Who's that?" demanded Wanda.
He wasn't sure what to do exactly.  He wasn't programmed to handle this.  He wasn't allowed to masturbate; why would he be?  There was no purpose to it.
"It's intravenous, of course it's fast," said Natasha dismissively.  She looked down at Tony's chest and frowned, holding an electrode in one hand.  "I'm guessing that thing is going to interfere with this?"
going to complain.
Steve was ignored.  She spared him a glance while Tony gave her an autograph, then left.
"You know who did it?"
"молчать, солдат," said a familiar voice.  He relaxed the tiniest bit, waiting for orders.  An explanation would be furnished eventually, when they were ready to give it to him.  He tried to flex some feeling into his left hand but wasn't sure if his hand was responding.  Around him, people were talking.  All Alphas.  Powerful men who, presumably, knew what was going on and would take care of him.  He felt groggy, like he was only just waking up after a long, long sleep; his brain was full of static.  He had a very vague idea that, recently, someone, someone familiar, had called out to him.
"You should see it!" Tracy grinned. "He downed an
"I won't," Aria said, a small smile twitching at the edge of her lips. The act before him finished up and announced the final act for the night as Steve.
"--Rogers was a target, they just finished Zola's algorithm--" he babbled
"Hammer, let go of his hand, already," snapped Tony, unable to stop himself.
"I think you need to unwind... and I know this always calms
?"  Banjo's expression was conflicted.  "The special ones?  The misbehaving ones?  The ones they can't use in the kitchen?" tried Steve desperately.
Steve nodded, his cheeks burning a little as he watched her go. He cleared his throat as the door slipped shut, letting his hand fall down to take Tony's in his.  He moved to tug Tony upstairs. He wasn't in a rush to get clean but he was quite alright with Tony showering with him.
"Hey," Steve appeared by Tony's side. He put a hand on the other's arm; his Alpha looked a little lost...perhaps a little drunk. The rush into the 'den' had been strange, the younger omegas especially excited and giggly. Steve had hung back with Hal, not so eager to get in that they would have pushed through the throngs of omegas. When he headed into the room, finally, he could see Donner between his mate and Tony. And Gideon looked furious.
He moved to open the car door, hoping the fresh air would help wake Tony up. Steve sighed. "Maybe we should just let him... sleep."
She stripped off the sweat-stained sheets, cleaned up the vomit, picked up the last of the pottery shards, and took the orchid downstairs to find a proper pot for it.  Her next stop was the lounge. The couch was clearly ruined beyond rescuing, as were the blankets there; sweat, semen, and even a little bit of blood had rendered them thoroughly unsalvageable.  She didn't bother touching that mess and turned to leave without having done anything, deciding the lounge was a lost cause.
"Mm," said Tony, nuzzling Steve lightly.  He fell asleep holding him, and his last thought, before he drifted off, was a pang of sympathy for Donner, who must feel terribly alone, sleeping by himself for the first time as an adult, unbonded, alone in a world designed for Alphas, one he didn't understand and had never faced as an independent individual.  He seemed like a coward, but who could blame him?  At least for now, he had summoned just enough courage to take a chance at escape.
As the sound of the suits' jets faded into the night, a thick silence settled over the remains of the demolished central room.  The party guests, huddled in the driveway and on the edges of the devastation, didn't dare move.
Tony frowned slightly at Steve's question about their concern being made worse.  Why would it be made worse?  He was convinced this was a misunderstanding and everyone was overreacting.
"Give us a break, will you?  We'll be upstairs. You can come if you hear any more smashing," snapped Tony, walking up the stairs with Steve.  He looked over him, concerned. Steve had a weird look on his face. He seemed dazed. Tony reached up to touch the mark on his neck.  "Hey... you wanna talk about it?" he asked. He knew Steve had flashbacks; a lot of them were about the war. Yelling about mortar in the trenches and mustard gas and thinking men had had their arms blown off.  A chilling reminder of Tony's family's legacy.
Sam looked back at Steve incredulously.
"Mr. Rogers-- I mean, Captain-- mister-- Steve-- hey!  Mr. Steve!" The Asian girl was tugging on Steve's sleeve insistently.  "Your mate-- James-- James is in a fight-- with your mate-- hey!" Over the music, all Steve could really make out was "your mate" and "James" over and over.
"How did your talk with Pepper go?" Steve asked off-handedly as he flipped over pieces of bacon.
"What's going on here?" asked Tony sweetly.
"Boys! Go get dressed; we'll be landing in forty minutes. It's two hours until the conference starts," Pepper announced, shooing them away to one of the cabins at the back of the plane.
"Huh?"  Tony looked down.  He had forgotten all about that; he'd been hobbling along without noticing, practically dragging his leg behind him, but now that she'd pointed it out, he realized it wasn't really weight-bearing and limping two miles on it wasn't his best idea.  "No, it's fine. Just take me back to Northwell!"
"So she's twenty-one?  Awesome," said Tony.  He paused.  "...how about Captain Rogers here?  I don't know his birthday."
Steve curled his arms against Bucky's chest and tucked his head under his chin, letting his eyes slip shut. "Bucky, I--" His voice was thick. Bucky smelt of cigarette smoke. It was oddly comforting. For a moment they were curled up on a couch in their apartment again. "I never would have let him mate me. Not if I knew you were alive," he whispered, voice trembling.
They were running at a leisurely pace.  Well, Steve was, anyway.  Sam was struggling to keep up with Steve's jog. "Gideon called us just now," Steve said. "He's using our own principles against us to try and talk to Donner."
"Can I ask how you got shot?" Steve said, knowing talking about relationships was about as good as talking to a goddamn brickwall.
Not strong ones, anyway.
"I'm not gonna hit you.  You can get up. C'mon." The Alpha gave his arm a tug; he got to his feet quickly.  "You want a drink? Sit down. Let's talk."
"What, why can't they just go to a gynecologist?"
and the main thing keeping him from doing so was the knowledge that Steve could wrestle him to the floor like a kitten.
Hammer?  No way.
"Oh my god! It's Captain America!"
"Tony. I'm fine," Steve assured him quickly, his hands up. "I really am fine."
"No take-backs, Stark!  I won him fair and square!" said Malick with delight, reaching for the collar.
"One of Steve's friends?" guessed Gleason, watching Phil curiously.
"You want me to...?" Steve offered softly, running a hand down Tony's arm in a way his mate knew was suggestive. He could still feel Tony's arousal against his thigh but he wasn't if, after that, he wanted to do anything about it. Steve knew that had been a big deal for Tony and he felt touched that he'd...it meant a lot that he'd been willing to do that for Steve.
"This is all my fault, I pushed him to try on collars, I pushed him to try mating last night, I fucked up, I fucking ruined everything, he could be anywhere now, we're never gonna find him if he's off the grid, oh, fuck..." Tony was too distraught over losing Steve to even snap at Pepper, who had shown up to try to help out, though the situation was looking rather grim.  If Steve didn't want to be found, then they probably wouldn't find him.
He walked over to the bed and climbed in, straddling Steve's hips.  "I have no idea what you're talking about," said Tony innocently, reaching down to play with Steve's zipper.  "I'm just a dumb furry squirrel. Got any nuts for me?" He grinned wider, tugging at Steve's clothes.
"Pepper!" cried Tony, with relief.
"Vanko?" demanded Tony.
Rhodey opened the door and several anxious-looking faces looked up.
"Pew... pew.. pew..." whispered Tony under his breath.  They were crouched on the roof together; Tony was eyeballing a pair of patrolling guards below them, pretending to shoot them with his fingers.
might be a little too nice for what she was," said Tony, tugging impatiently on his collar.  "...I can't believe Eric's so into her. He seems okay. Do you think he slaps Piper around? What the hell would he ever do it for?  Piper's so quiet and does everything he says..."
"Oh... oh, n-no... no, Gideon would never make me fight.  He wouldn't want my face to get ruined," said Donner quickly.  "He takes good care of me. He would-- would never kick me out or-- or let another Alpha touch me."  Donner ducked his head shyly. Clearly, he didn't think Tony was a very good mate at all, but alluding to Tony's bad behavior had taken every ounce of his courage and now he was staring at the ground.
"...you don't think they might... get ideas?" asked Malick.
"You must be Lydia."
"This is your ex-mate?" asked the colonel, gesturing to Donner.  The resemblance between he and Steve was obvious.
"Okay!  Okay!" she said quickly, holding up her hands.
It occurred to Tony how unfair it was, in a sense, that omegas were so completely wired for sex.  They had a dick, they had... whatever the hell Gleason had called Steve's ass.... right, cloaca.... and they had those scent glands behind their ears...
"They recommended I get a dog, actually," Steve whispered after a moment. "They were scared about me feeling isolated in the 21st century. And apparently they can help with PTSD."
"Condom," Tony managed, reaching for the drawer of the nightstand.  Steve was already wiggling against his shaft, his entrance slippery and inviting; Steve was rubbing them together eagerly, arms around Tony.  Tony let out a whimper; he was so painfully, achingly hard. "Condom," he repeated, trying to get Steve off him, but Steve was heavy and insistent and Tony could feel his head nudging teasingly at Steve's entrance.
