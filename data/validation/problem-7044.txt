Tony lowers his voice, careful not to let Steve overhear him, who is watching Tony with a curious and slightly worried expression. “Is he dead?”
Thor takes her in his arms, tears streaming down his face. “Oh, my darling.” He cups her face and looks at her with all the love he can muster. “My love, we’re going to have a baby.”
“I’m exhausted, Tony. Don’t test me,” he teases back, but there is a hint of seriousness in his voice.
Tony fumes, although it is coated with affection and not heat. He goes on about how they could have celebrated. How Tony would have had a big parade dedicated just for them and he’d get away with it, because he is the Speaker of the House after all.
“I heard your phone go off about ten times,” Natasha says while looking at her reflection in the mirror and pressing her thumb to her lip. There’s a bit of lipstick that’s smudged, and Clint notes that it is so like her to spot it, to want to reach up and fix it. “Why didn’t you answer it?”
They shuffle inside, with four Secret Service men following them, leaving two standing in front Tony’s front door.
"I've got your files from this afternoon’s meeting ready for you to bring home," she says. Clint is currently slipping his laptop in his bag but takes the time to scrunch his nose and press a knuckle against its bridge. In his opinion, they had taken too goddamn long arguing about absolutely useless things earlier that afternoon.
The room suddenly becomes quiet. Everyone except Tony, Bruce, and Phil, turns to look at the President in disbelief. Tony tries to hide a self-satisfied and triumphant smile, but it’s not over yet.
“If I know you, which I do, you’d just leave these dirty dishes strewn around your kitchen for a week until JARVIS nags you to clean them up,” she tells him.
were asking around. If I were found out, I’d be the only casualty and the team can go on making mischief. I can just move strings behind the scenes, so to speak.”
It’s 9:33 in the morning. Clint’s got seven missed calls (ergo a lot of angry voicemail) and about twelve messages from Darcy in varying degrees of annoyance. There are two messages from Tony care of Kate. He knows he’s late for work—they both are—but Natasha is in the shower and he’s knotting his tie in the mirror, and he figures they’ll make it to the Hill by 10. The alarm didn’t go off, which is strange. This entire morning already feels off, mainly because last night wasn’t exactly supposed to have happened. Not again.
“I’m sorry about the way I talked to you yesterday. I had no business being that brusque,” Steve begins, his voice solemn. “I’m glad you still came.”
“Yes,” the lawyer responds. “The Justice department found evidence of him bribing the judge assigned to the case to postpone the hearing, giving him ample time to then bribe Cleveland police to release the vibranium. We can delve more into that but I’m sure you’ve already read the briefing packet released by the DOJ this morning.”
It takes Thor and Jane a minute to comprehend what the doctor just said. “How can this be? We’ve been trying for a decade with no such luck.”
She drizzles olive oil over a pan and turns the stove on. “Yes, can you hand me the squid, clams and shrimps I set aside there by the turkey?”
“I am also present and voting, and concur with Miss Potts,” says Thor. “But it is early yet—things may pick up soon.”
“So…” Wade begins as he flops on the couch, mouth full of Yang Chao fried rice. “How are we going to go about kicking Republican ass?”
“Sir, yes, sir,” he says, and she can feel him salute at the other end. “See you at the Hill.” He hangs up, and she smiles despite herself. Mastering the art of bossing Tony Stark wasn’t easy and she had to grasp at straws when she began working for him, but over the years Kate has learned how to deal with him at times like these. Besides, she’s always had his best interests at heart, and he knows that, knows when to allow Kate to boss him around.
“Well, that’s settled then,” Clint replies, and he forces a smile, the kind he reserves for the podiums and the campaigns on a bad day, the kind that he uses for cable television when he has to face a detractor. He knows she doesn’t buy it, but he doesn’t care, can’t bring himself to.
As always, your comments keep me at the top of my game, and your love keeps me writing. Please please please do drop a word to tell me how you feel about this chapter. I hope you enjoy it!
“Understood, Mr. President. If that’s all, I suggest we move on with the security briefing. The Joint Chiefs are already waiting outside,” Bruce proposes.
“Steve Jobs is dead, dear,” she informs him, holding in a small laughter. It always amazes her how good friends her fiancé and her ex-boyfriend are. Only a handful of men would be comfortable with the fact that she used to date (and was engaged to) the infamous Tony Stark for what some people would consider forever (five years). Most men’s egos can’t handle that, but not Happy. He actually likes Tony, admires him, cares for him even. That thought warms Pepper’s heart.
Only Jane’s and Frigga’s interference had stopped the brothers from escalating their verbal sparring into a full-blown physical altercation. The Odinson matriarch was visibly upset after Loki had stormed out of the house—she had prayed for Loki to join them for Thanksgiving, and was very vocal about her desire to have both her sons in the house so that she could cajole a truce out of them. Thor, despite wanting to reconnect with his brother, was skeptical about this from the beginning, but Jane had warned him against airing out his concerns to Frigga during the holidays. After Loki had caused an uproar in the house and had stormed out, Thor hadn’t had the heart to tell his mother
By the time Tony arrives in his house at around eight in the evening, the party is in full swing. The entire first floor of his house is occupied by overworked government employees—he spots some staffers from Pepper’s and Janet’s offices in the kitchen, making what vaguely resembles to be guacamole; Natasha’s team from the DNC is milling about near the bar area with Wade’s people, controlling the flow of booze; and Clint’s and Thor’s tribes are scattered about in the living room and library, steering most of the conversation in the house. The atmosphere is relaxed, but there is an electric undercurrent powered by the hip-hop beats that Tony suspects Kate had put together for JARVIS to play in surround sound. He’s got to hand it to his assistant—not only is the party an acceptable cover for the meeting, it’s actually a rousing success. There is not a single bored face under his roof, and about half of his guests are close to being smashed.
Obie flinches, taken aback by Rumiko’s brazen show of the upper hand. But he regains his composure quickly enough. “You can have all the dances with the President that you want, Rumiko. You’re still going to lose. We’re heading into the future and we will leave you behind, penniless and praying for death,” he tells her with a menacing look on his face.
Steve reads the letter carefully, word per word so as not to misunderstand anything. “I honestly can’t believe this,” he says, incredulous. “He’s what, 68? He’s too young to retire, isn’t he?”
“Everything on sleep mode, JARVIS,” Tony instructs the other entity in the house as he gets ready for bed, tapping his toothbrush on the edge of the sink so the excess water can drip down.
buttons his suit jack and slips his hand into Jane’s. They started this together and they will end this together, no matter what the outcome. She leads him out of the master bedroom and into the living area to join the staff. Everyone is quiet, waiting on the edge of their seats for the news.
Those words make Tony feel very warm inside, the same warmth that he felt with Pepper in the kitchen earlier in the evening. That shocks and confuses him—he can’t entertain those types of feelings right now, especially not with Steve. Things have to be strictly platonic for him to function.
Kate received the White House summons precisely three minutes after Steve had gone full POTUS and hung up on him, giving Tony an express command that he cannot possibly disobey. His assistant knew exactly how fucked he was—she strolled into his office and told him in not so many words that he was well and truly fucked and had only one way to get out of the situation he had put himself in.
“Better send her a fruit basket, Stark,” Wade directs Tony. “And by fruit basket, I mean six bottles of 25-year-old Bowmores.”
Clint gives her a small nod and continues where his assistant left off. “I’ve been scheduling some small meetings at the Supreme Court. Nothing too important, just under the guise of being part of the Senate Judiciary Committee, checking up on cases that are important to our platform, that kind of stuff. I needed a low-key way—pun totally intended—of asking questions, but most importantly, I needed to get Darcy inside to sniff around the clerks and assistants without anyone raising suspicions.”
Steve sets his brush down and turns around, a big, goofy smile plastered on his face. “Hey, you.” He stands up to take Tony’s face in his hands and give him a kiss. “I’ve been wanting to do that all night.”
“Yes, sir,” his trusty AI replies. “Although Miss Potts remains in the kitchen, sorting out the dirty dishes.”
“Climate change: the greatest challenge humankind will face in the next one hundred years,” Tony declares. “And this is why my arc reactor design is so important.”
“I’ve been naughty and you’ve come to punish me,” Hill replies mockingly, disdain evident in her tone.
Pepper shrugs in defeat. “And now we’re here.” She sighs, deposits her dishes in the sink and starts washing them. “I better start getting ready for work.”
“A lot of people aren’t happy with him,” he tells her casually, but she can tell there’s a sinister undertone to it. “But that’s part of the job, isn’t it?”
Steve doesn’t know what Tony is up to, but he finds that he’s willing to take on his challenge. “Well, I would not want to steal the First Lady away from President Eliodoro…” He stands up and stretches out his right hand towards Rumiko. “But I would very much like to steal the Speaker’s enchanting date away from him. Miss Fujikawa, would you care to dance would me?”
“And it’s not registered in the US, so you can’t request for documents from the SEC,” Elektra finishes for him.
In hindsight, Tony was expecting this—he did spend an entire evening with Natasha discussing every possible outcome, after all—but nothing could have prepared him for the hurt brought about by the realization that his partnership with Steve was nothing more than a convenient arrangement. He had gravely miscalculated their relationship, and he had set himself up for the heartbreak of investing so much time, energy, and emotional capital in the wrong person.
Tony stops to think for a moment. He’s been in politics for more than two decades, so he’s seen and heard it all. Frankly, he doesn’t have an answer for Steve—it’s a jumbled mess of liters and liters of coffee, sleepless nights, not selling his soul to the devil, Pepper and Kate and Janet and Natasha, Clint and Thor and Wade, pizza, machines, staying sober, and a dream of flying iron suits. How can he tell the President of the United States that really, this was just some alternate universe wherein he decided not to pursue his first love and ended up in politics because of one selfish reason or another?
he’s seen it somewhere before—maybe in a briefing document, or a photo from the DOD?—and his subconscious will keep bugging him about it until he figures out where he first encountered it.
Steve is painting when Tony walks in the private sitting room at the residence. He stands by the doorway for a minute, admiring the image in front of him, one that only he and a few chosen others are privileged to see: the most powerful man in the world dressed down, wearing an old, ratty, paint-stained shirt and hole-filled denim pants, the tenderness and vulnerability evident in the way he thrives in his creative outlet. It’s a wonderful, beautiful, humbling sight, and something which Tony is sure he will never tire of seeing.
But when they meet each other’s eyes and shake hands, there’s a hint of smile on Steve’s mouth. Tony knows that smile, he’s
“Sir, Mr. Dugan has arrived,” JARVIS announces to Tony’s relief. He doesn’t think he can handle any more emotionally loaded conversations at the moment. He needs to steel himself for the fight in front of him.
Tony takes a deep breath before he responds, preparing himself for the displeased reaction that he knows his reply will elicit. “I don’t know the answer to that.”
She kisses his cheek and wipes off the lipstick smudge with her thumb. “You’re a very sweet and generous man, Tony Stark. I hope, for your sake, that he doesn’t break your heart.”
Natasha doesn’t look angry, she doesn’t. Her face is drawn into a frown, like she’s genuinely confused, like she’s completely not seeing why or how Clint could even begin to suggest that they were anything but two colleagues that fucked when they (when she, when
“Perfect, Mr. President!” Cassie adds exuberantly. “Uncle Tony and I make a mean Thanksgiving turkey. You are going to see stars tomorrow, I promise you.”
Steve mulls on it for a moment. He cannot accept that Tony is right, but he won’t say that Tony is wrong either, because he isn’t. “I understand where you’re coming from, Tony. I will think about it, alright? And I might have to discuss this with my staff. I can’t make any promises but…I will think about it.”
His grip on the chair loosens in resignation and he turns to face Jane, gives her a tired smile. “Yes, my love?”
Major shoutout to The American President, which is my inspiration for this chapter. Y'all should go and watch that movie.
“In many ways she is more than just my goddaughter,” Tony whispers, as if reading Steve’s mind. “Come on, I’ll show you the most exciting part of the house.”
He sits behind his desk and picks up the phone to call Natasha. “Sweetheart!” he greets her cheerfully. “Have you heard?”
Pepper moves closer to the desk. “I’m here to tell you to back off, Hill,” she warns the Minority Leader.
“Will do.” She turns to leave, and before she steps out of the room, she tells him, “Say hi to Tony for me,” with a wink.
He laughs at that. “At least you—or someone from your party—will have the chance to be part of history, Miss Romanoff. And for that, I envy you.”
“What, are you going to tell me that you didn’t know two days ago when you told me to watch out for anything unusual?” Steve asks indignantly.
“The Women’s Health Act is a Democratic bill that’s fairly popular with the voters. They want us to try to save it by putting all influential hands on deck,” Pepper adds.
get to throw around important government documents in this office while I am alive, Tony Stark,” she tells him in exasperation as she picks up the fallen pages from the floor.
of her.” Steve takes a deep breath. “She was the one great force in my life. She made me feel invincible, like I could do anything with her by my side. You see, after everything I went through during my tours, she made me believe that we still have the power to make this country a better one, even with all the crap that’s happening. She gave me hope. She made me believe that all of this is going be worth it in the end. It’s just that now.” His voice is suddenly softer, “I sometimes don’t think it will be, not without Peggy to share it with.”
Tony tilts his head, thoughtful. This is an opening, he thinks, an opening that he can decide to take or not. Where the opening goes, he doesn’t know just yet. He takes a deep breath.
“As if you haven’t been Eager McBeaver yourself. I know you’ve been playing Angry Birds in there for the last hour,” she fires back. He rolls his eyes.
“Looks like you woke up on the wrong side of the bed this morning,” he tells Steve with an observant tone.
“I’m not sure, but Darcy has an idea. Just remember not to mention Natasha in front of him.” Kate says with her eyebrow raised, like Tony’s a child he needs constant reminding, like she’s daring him to go on and ask some more. Tony realizes then that it’s not only because the women on their side are the sexiest and most gorgeous, it’s also because they’re the most fucking
Tony drags him back in with a filthy kiss. “Stories of my promiscuity have been greatly exaggerated, Steve. Most of the them by me. Now…” Tony thumbs Steve’s kiss-swollen lips. “Tell me what you want.”
The ladies break into a smile. Janet, Pepper, and Natasha all rush towards Jessica and welcome her warmly.
The press conference outside the White House was an accident that Tony had decided to take full advantage of. Under normal circumstances, he would have lorded it all over everyone who was watching (especially Hill and her lackeys, who were
“Steve,” Tony greets him, and there is a wave of relief that washes over Steve, and the room brightens up a notch. It’s new and a little strange, but he shrugs it off as a consequence of exhaustion.
“That’s beside the point.” Pause. “If this is not how it’s done, then tell me how it is!” Tony’s voice is restrained, but the exasperation is evident. “Convince me that shutting up and holing yourself in the White House while some idiots are running around and undermining your authority is the way to go. Convince me, Steve.”
“Hey, Stinger!” An image of Cassie in the kitchen, typing away into her laptop, is projected in the air right in front of Tony and Steve.
Kate shuffles the papers back into an orderly arrangement and stands up to face Tony. “What?” The references do nothing to mitigate her irritation with her boss.
Hill sniggers, leans back in her chair and crosses her arms. “I take it this is about Women’s Health Act.”
Cassie lights up. “Of course! Had Kate reserve one for me at Stachowski’s a couple of weeks ago. Picked it up when I arrived.” She unloads the seafood on the pan and drizzles more olive oil on it.
“Admit it, Steve, you don’t trust me. Not really,” Tony continues. “I wouldn’t be here being intimidated into talking if you did.”
Happy holds her wrists gently and turns off the faucet. “I’ll take care of these. Go and take a nice, long shower. I can tell that today isn’t going to be a very good day for you.”
Wade salutes, turns around, leaves the conference room and bids Kate goodbye. Tony takes a deep breath, composes himself and his thoughts, readying himself for the day ahead. “Kate!” he calls out to his assistant. “What’s next?”
“Reed Richards is carrying the torch for both budget and appropriations,” Hank answers. “He’s keeping everything close to his chest at the moment.”
Damn. The guy definitely knows how to boss people around. Tony is so awe-stricken that for a moment he forgets that he’s also playing a very important role. Pepper nudges him, urging him to speak. He clears his throat. Everyone in the room is anticipating his words. “Yeah, let’s shut it down,” he says casually but with finality. He doesn’t take his eyes off Maria Hill. “I’d much rather work with the President than with the rest of you so, if you don’t mind, let’s shut this whole thing down so we can actually get to work.”
Everyone knows Natasha Romanoff, and everyone is afraid of Natasha Romanoff. She could have been a spy if she wanted to, but perhaps politics had a certain allure that she could not resist. After all, politics is not so different from espionage. There’s a lot of surveillance, reconnaissance, manipulation, playing games, threats, and having multiple personas. Perhaps the only difference is that politics is much more entertaining than espionage—there’s no better feeling than seeing a grown man squirm and beg for mercy (and the fact that intimidation doesn’t involve blood or dismemberment in this field is a plus). And she fits in this world—along with looking like she could kill you with her thighs, Natasha Romanoff is the perfect fit for the Democrats’ main woman (and man) on everything related to the party, from funding individual candidates to establishing the party’s platform to making sure that Tony Stark stays sober.
Tony raises an eyebrow. “I hardly think being Speaker of the House and being President of the United States have the same job description, Steve.”
“Hello?” Happy answers, and he heads outside of the bedroom, unaware that Pepper had also woken up to the call.
Unlike the last time, the Democrats are the first people in the Roosevelt room. This is understandable—Hill and her team could be having last minute negotiations with the President right now, but of course Tony knows that if that’s the case, it’s all just a farce. If Steve Rogers is as honest as he says he is, he won’t double cross Tony and throw away his trust at this crucial juncture.
“Well, there was something about aliens in the security briefing this morning…” Steve pauses, and Tony doesn’t know how to respond. “I’m kidding.”
As Tony walks briskly through the halls to exit the White House residence, his brings the team phone again to his ear. “JARVIS, are you there?”
“You’re always welcome here,” Steve says softly, smiling back. He strokes Tony’s cheek with his thumb. “You look terrible, by the way.”
Clint thinks maybe this is a big red flag for him to not ask what he’s about to ask, but he closes his eyes and steels himself as Natasha walks out of the bathroom, all prim and austere. Her heels clack-clack-clack on the marble floor as she makes her way closer and stands next to him in front of the floor-length mirror, a small smirk already in place on her face.
“You’re right about that.” He stands up and tucks his wallet in the back pocket of his slacks. “Did you need something?”
Still! Thank you for the continued support for this story. I've received a lot of messages about this fic on Tumblr. So see guys, I haven't abandoned it! It's just going really, really slowly.
Pepper smiles to herself—Thor has always been the best motivational speaker among them. When she directs her attention to Justin Hammer again, she lets out a dramatic, tired sigh. “What do you want, Hammer? If you say ‘unequivocal approval of the Stane-Hammer partnership extension’ then you can go take a hike.”
When Kate bids Clint goodnight, he hugs her tight before she leaves. She finds that she doesn’t want to let go just yet. “Thank you,” he whispers in her ear. “You don’t know how much I’ve needed this.”
“The garden is beautiful,” Tony says suddenly, as if reading Steve’s mind. “I honestly never thought I’d have the privilege to walk here, especially under these circumstances.”
Tony sighs, and Steve can feel that he’s shaking his head as well. “You’re too good to be true. But I suppose I can’t fault you for that. And I see now why the country saw that you’d be better at running this country than Thor.” No one speaks for a moment. “I’ve been in this business longer than you, Steve. I’m being realistic. I want to give us a fighting chance.”
“Can you not say poison and President in the same sentence around Secret Service agents? I don’t want to see you being carted off to federal prison for threatening to kill the leader of the free world.”
“I need to be able to protect you,” he tells her seriously. “I’m not going to lie, this is potentially dangerous work, Ru, and I wouldn’t have enlisted your help if we weren’t desperate and if I didn’t think you could handle it. But we need you.
hard. In all ways, places, and positions possible. But it’s only a little bit before noon on the third day of the shutdown. There is still plenty of promise for the rest of the day.
When she gets down to the kitchen, Happy is finishing his call and already has a fresh pot of coffee ready for the both of them. Pepper smiles and kisses him on the cheek. “Good morning. Early start?” she asks as she pours herself and Happy a fresh cup of steaming Columbian coffee each.
“You don’t have power, Miss Fujikawa. No matter how many cellphones or laptops or cars you sell, you are
It’s a window into Tony’s private world, the world that Steve, if he was being truly honest with himself, has been desperate to be allowed into. He can’t help but just watch them laugh and smile and make jokes while flawlessly maneuvering the kitchen to create what is looking to be a scrumptious Thanksgiving dinner. He’s grateful for this chance to be a part of their family, even just for an evening.
Tony knows that none of that will work on Steve. He has had three months to get to know the person behind all the pomp and circumstance, and if there is one thing he’s certain about the President, it’s that he can smell bullshit from a mile away. And the fact that Tony has been nothing but genuine to him since the start of their… relationship?... means that Steve has gotten to know the Speaker pretty well, too.
“We’re currently in the Yellow Oval Room for the informal reception. Tony is currently chatting away with both Presidents. But I do think that the Chief of Protocol will be here to call us down very soon,” Rumiko reports. “At the moment, I don’t see anyone worth mentioning, but I’ll keep you posted.” A beat. “You should pursue Killian, though. I’ve never known him to be political, so it’s very strange that he’s here.”
“Sure, go ahead. I’ll make us some breakfast.” Kate starts setting up the frying pan, but then stops. “Hey, Darcy?”
The sitting room is warm and cozy, its fireplace lit and glowing. It’s very much a physical manifestation of its current resident—bright and wholehearted, all warm and earthy. Steve stands by the console table, clearly very happy to see him. Tony can’t help but loosen up and feel relaxed at the eager welcome.
“I know Tony Stark. I know his people and I know how they work. They’re difficult to work with, yes, but it’s mostly about being protective of one another than anything else. They all have a history with one another and go way back—Stark, Potts, Odinson, Romanoff, Barton, Van Dyne. Heck, even Wilson. With that said, I honestly think that this business with Pierce’s resignation isn’t about undermining or one-upping you. It’s about these people having their own system, their own way of finding out the truth. They’re good people, and they’re not trying to destroy this country. They’re just a family—a very close-knit and vigilant family.”
Bruce stays and has the right mind to have one of Steve’s secretaries call the Vice President. It’s always best to have Phil around when the Leader of the Free World is on the edge—they work best as a triumvirate, after all. He waits for Steve to sit behind the Resolute Desk before informing him that Phil will be in the Oval Office in a few minutes.
“No, we are not good!” Kate tells him, exasperated. “What are you doing? No, seriously, what the hell are you doing?”
“Well, in that case, may God bless your soul,” she says seriously, and saunters out of the room, leaving Tony to dwell in his misery.
Jane is his everything—his solid foundation, his rock, his guiding light. When they met almost fifteen years ago, it was love at first sight for him. She, on the other hand, needed more convincing. Back then, she was a young and promising PhD student in Culver University, and he was an aimless, rather pompous son of a rich businessman riding the powerful and wealthy coattails of his father. Jane wasn’t exactly impressed.
When Kate wakes up, it’s a little bit past five in the morning. The sun isn’t out yet, but her desk lamp and the standing lamp beside the couch that she had forgotten to turn off some few hours before fill the living room with soft light. She had fallen asleep on her laptop keyboard. Scattered all over her desk are sheets of paper—documents, speeches, letters, requests, among other things—that she had been working on until the early hours of the morning. Across it, Darcy sleeps on the couch, a folder on her stomach with most of its contents spilled and strewn all over the floor along with other paperwork. She is still wearing yesterday’s clothes, and so is Kate—a sign of increasing pressure at work, no thanks to Maria Hill and her fellow Republicans. Unfortunately, work stress is also one of the many hazards of working for Tony Stark.
“People think we’re all that, but we’re really just a bunch of misfits,” Clint adds with a little humor.
He fires away. “I need you to dig up what you can about Richard Parker’s witness protection detail. See if you can figure out if Parker is still alive from his digital signatures in the past twenty minutes. I also need you to call SHIELD. I need their best people on the ground in Georgia as soon as possible. And have someone come pick me up in five minutes about two blocks from the White House.”
his mechanical mind asks in panic. He’s already starting to think of upgrades to his firewalls, and maybe even make Pepper and the rest of the team new phones to add to those tablets to secure his privacy—in his spare time, of course.
“It was really nice seeing you, America,” Kate admits as she puts on her scarf and turns around to leave. “I’ve missed you, you know.”
“That’s about it for today’s good news,” Pepper announces seriously. “We’re going to have a problem with the new Women’s Health Act,” she tells them without preamble.
Steve goes straight for the refrigerator and skims through its contents to find something suitable to eat. “We’ve got ingredients for a variety of sandwiches. What would you like?”
Phil leans back at the chair and crosses his arms, his steely gaze remaining firmly on Steve. “From what we’ve gathered, it seems as though Hill feels that this administration hasn’t done enough to push its financial agenda in Congress. She’s disappointed with the way we’re handling the budget crisis.”
For all the years he spent worrying about Kate, about doing right by her, at least now he can see with his own two eyes that she’s found a place with a family that loves her, and deserves her love. And he finds that he has a place in that family, too.
His assistant sighs, the open and honest expression clear on her face. “We never talk about this stuff anymore.”
They stand there for a while by the door, their bodies close, kissing like their lives depend on it. The world around them is a haze, and everything else is so far away from them that it feels like they’re floating on air. Their kisses are hot, desperate, and unrelenting—like their mouths were made for nothing else but this—and what skin-on-skin contact they have with their clothes on feels like fire.
Just. Thank you so so much for sticking around and still leaving comments even if its been months since I last updated. They honestly keep me going and keep me writing bit by bit. So please keep leaving your comments! I really really do appreciate them. Thank you thank you so much and I hope you enjoy this chapter :)
“How about some lunch?” he asks Tony after their relatively heated discussion on the appropriations bill on education.
“I don’t have anything against it, Steve, but these things are what gets the press to start asking questions we don’t want asked,” Tony points out.
“Matt and I both did,” Foggy assents. “Which was why we agreed to represent him, and helped him get a meeting with the Wakandan embassy to consult on the authenticity of the alleged vibranium. We were both certain that Wakandan officials would have no comment, but if the vibranium had come into the country illegally, then at least they would be notified and would act accordingly.”
“I charmed one of Justice Lehnserr’s clerks, who told me that he’s heard subpoenas have been going around the Court. I mean, it’s the highest federal court of the country so I’m sure that’s not an unusual thing to happen, but he said that they were being given
Clint says nothing. He sits on the couch, opens a beer, and eats a burger, clearly accepting his situation.
“I hardly think bringing an engaged woman as my beard would throw people off our gay scent,” Tony responds in an amused tone.
“I can’t believe this,” Scott murmurs as he continues reading. “The IPCC isn’t slated to release the whole report until—“
She comes in the room swiftly, but Steve can see the weariness in her movements. “Sir?” she asks gently.
Tony stares at Peter funny. Then, his eyes widen, and he lets out a groan. “Shit, I completely forgot about that.”
He thinks of Rhodey, his best friend and closest confidante, whom his dad would have never allowed him to spend time with if he were still alive (that racist bastard). And Pepper, who spent a whole semester arguing with him relentlessly in their Political Communications class. She would have been sized up as a potential match for Tony in his old world, but Obie would have hated the fact that she had grown up poor and without connections. He thinks of Kate and Darcy, a glaring and perfect example of love in the face of adversity—he would have been forbidden to interact with the LGBT community had he stayed.
“Seeing as we just lost the White House, not so good,” she tells him in discontent, but obviously attempting to smile. “But at least it’s not all bad news.”
Pepper chuckles. “Don’t let Kate hear you underestimating her. Give that girl a bow and arrow and you’re dead in three seconds flat.”
The inside of his apartment is even worse. Take-out boxes are strewn all over the living room and there are dishes in the sink that seem to have been there for weeks. It’s a nightmare. Kate should have come before the whole thing with Natasha exploded into epic proportions, and way before Clint started showing signs of disrepair due to the aftershocks of the rejection.
“'Course I do, Uncle Tones. You've never really had bad taste in dates, to be honest.” A beat. Then, “Does the team know?”
“Oh yes, I’ve done that. I also wanted to see if we could expand our communication and storage system to accommodate the rest of the team.” He pauses and there’s a sound of clanging metal in the background. “I think I’ve figured it out. I need to make a few more tablets, especially for Pepper and Clint, but it won’t take much.”
Natasha throws her hands in the air. “Jesus Christ, Mr. Vice President! Can’t a man meet up with his best friend and his best friend’s girlfriend without being accused of plotting against the sitting government?”
Well, that's what he tells the journalists, pundits, and the morning talk show hosts. Armed with his signature smile, they'll print his words and quote his morning routine anecdote. Not that he doesn’t do any of those things. The truth is rather less glamorous and noble than it sounds. But, hey, what happens behind closed doors stays there. As long as JARVIS is still programmed to promise not to breathe a word of it, no one needs to know it takes him half an hour to actually make it out of bed first.
“Thank you,” he says cheerfully. “But we’re ready when you are, boss. Aldrich Killian at two o’clock.”
Party politics have always been much more cordial in the Senate, and he has never experienced less than that during his three (well, two and a half) terms in office. Come to think of it, not once when he was growing up had Uncle Michael complained about tactics in the upper house. Sure, things became dirty once in a while, especially with divisive issues that drew clear party lines with both sides spewing hate at each other, but Senate politics never became as vicious as that of the House. He never had to deal with that sort of ruthlessness during his eleven years in the Senate. He’s grateful for that, but he definitely can’t escape it now that he’s sitting in the Oval Office. While heartless politics is par for the course, he’s starting to feel like that’s the only type of politics that Maria Hill and company know how to play. It leaves a very ugly taste in his mouth, especially when as each day the budget war gets bloodier, Hill seems to be more inclined to undermine his leadership.
“A little shaken—Obie has always rubbed me the wrong way, and this time is no different—but otherwise fine,” she tells him honestly.
Steve runs a hand through his hair and sighs. “Which side would you wake up to if Congress was going crazy behind your back?”
“Penny for your thoughts,” Tony says as he lays down two grilled cheese sandwiches in front of Steve.
“Can’t say I’m surprised, actually. This is completely Maria Hill’s MO,” Janet confesses, and they all agree. “The bill will never pass with a school prayer amendment, not with a Democratic House. So what’s our gameplan?”
The doctor looks at his clipboard and scribbles on the pages. “I’d like to keep you here for observation until tomorrow. Your OBGYN will have much more detailed instructions for you, but until you’re able to see him or her, I suggest bed rest and no physical activity. If you don’t have anymore questions, then please excuse me.” Then he takes his leave.
"Mr. Stark," Darcy purrs, not even daring to hop off of Kate's desk. "Late, as per schedule, but not even fashionably so. Are you ever going to rid of those stupid orange aviators?"
Tony takes one final swig of his drink and sets it down on the table next to him. The crowd in his house is gathering in front of the gigantic TV screen in the living room. “They’re ready to call the final numbers!” Kate screams from somewhere in the mass of people. It’s quiet all of a sudden, and then a jubilant howl erupts. Tony can barely hear anything over the merrymaking.
“Glad we could drag you out of the fluorescent-lit dungeons of Hoover for a night,” Pepper greets her with a peck on the cheek.
“Ah,” Tony chuckles. “Kate did mention something to that effect. You guys have fun. Give the girls a hug for me.”
Before anyone else can argue, the ushers begin to guide the guests to their tables, signaling the start of the evening’s proceedings. “Look, we’re out of time,” Natasha admonishes them. “You heard the boss. Rumiko gets Stane. In meantime, Pepper takes Hammer, I take Killian, and Tony will approach T’Challa. Thor and Clint, you’re our eyes and ears. Nothing gets past the both of you, you hear me?”
The drive back to city limits is quiet, just as it had been on their way to the warehouse. Clint grips on the wheel, eager to talk but not having any courage to do so. Natasha has always had this effect on him—he has always feared how much she meant to him, and has always, always been terrified of her rejection of his feelings towards her. The first time she dismissed him, it almost broke him. He doesn’t know if that’s something he can handle the second time around.
Steve stares at him disbelievingly, clearly surprised at Tony’s sudden cold recalcitrance. “I just spent the last five minutes telling you how sorry I am about that! Why can’t you trust that I’m being sincere?”
“I know you’re on blackout mode until after you’ve finished reviewing all the new bills, but there’s some commotion in the press office that I think you should address,” Kate tells him in a gradual, cautious tone.
“Ask Clint, he’s seriously tried to convince Tony about a million times. He wants the royalties,” Cassie says, finally breaking Steve’s resolve as he bursts into laughter.
He nods in agreement. “That’s right, I’m Tony Stark. And I have a responsibility to our party and to this country to do what’s best.”
he tells himself. Besides, if he infuriates the President again, Pepper will never forgive him. And Kate. And Janet.
Phil clears his throat. “Bruce and I have had been on the lookout for a few weeks now. Forgive us if we haven’t shared any of our information with you, but we felt like we needed more time to piece the puzzle together before presenting you with a situation report.”
“Arc reactor…” Steve murmurs, tracing the linings of the device cautiously with his fingers. “Why the need to miniaturize?”
“Hell no,” Clint throws in, a little more animated than he was five minutes ago now that the warmth of the tea is permeating through his system. “They have the entire DOJ and the intelligence community at their disposal. We, on the other hand, only have people willing to commit felonies and a disembodied voice in your property on our side.”
Darcy turns. Kate's fingers continue to fly across her tablet, as she seems to be taking down note of what information she had been trading with Darcy before he called their attention.
The discussion about Hill and the President heats up and then suddenly everyone is speaking in raised voices, with everyone overlapping one another. Kate and Darcy are at the back of the room, glancing at each other with amused looks on their faces. Kate nudges her girlfriend with her elbow, egging her to talk.
“I’m sorry, Bucky. I had no idea about this, but I don’t excuse my ignorance. I know this is partially my fault.” Steve rubs his temples and takes a deep breath. “The only way I can make this right is if we work together to push our agenda. I can’t give you back the seats you’ve lost, but I can give you my full support. However, it’s important that you work with me here.”
Steve is speechless and dumbfounded, his eyes wide from the realization that Tony may have just given their budding relationship some more room to breathe. He steals a glance at their table, where the President of Italy and his First Lady are standing up to take the second dance. He sees Tony, his chin resting on his hand, and a knowing, satisfied grin on his face.
Natasha shakes her head. “I think we’ve exhausted everything that we can tonight. Matt, excellent work. Well done.”
Steve knows that he can’t, so he settles for honesty. After all, that’s the foundation of the arrangement anyway. “I want to believe that they can change their mind, Tony. I want to believe that they will be able to see reason.”
“You’ve not yet given us probable cause to deem you as a threat to the President, ma’am. So you’re off the hook for now.”
“We’re going to have a Republican in the White House. ‘Be prepared’ is going to be my mantra for the next four years,” he reasons out.
He rubs his eyes, takes a deep breath, and takes the plunge. “Sharon? Get me Congressman Barnes on the line.”
“Are you referring to how he usually looks?” Darcy asks. Kate lightly butts her head against Darcy’s waist, in an attempt to get her moving. It’s the first affectionate action they’ve been free to make since dating. Darcy runs her fingers through Kate’s hair, messing it up. She gives Tony a challenging look before leaning down to press a kiss on top of Kate’s head. Tony’s smirk softens into a sincere smile.
Sharon does as she’s told, and finds a comfortable spot on the couch in the middle of the Oval. He follows to sit across from her. There’s an awkward silence between them while Steve gathers his wits about him. Earlier in the week, he had told Phil and Bruce about the recent…developments regarding his relationship with Tony. It had been a pretty straightforward conversation, neither of them turning out to be that at all surprised with how things had progressed between the President and the Speaker of the House. Their biggest concern had been the press and how the story should be handled when the time comes, but Steve had waved it off, telling his Chief of Staff and his Vice President that they’d cross the bridge when they’d get there.
She gives him a steely look. “Don’t test me.” Tony raises his arms in surrender. “You’re not forgiven, you know that right?” she clarifies for him.
who’s not being fair. The only way for them to change is if they see that what they’re doing is wrong. And they will be able to see that only if you show them as blatantly as possible. I know Maria Hill, and she’s not going to change unless you tie her down and strangle her. Unless she has no other options.”
“And you automatically assumed that I was implying you were having an affair with the President?” Pepper questions him with a raised eyebrow. “You of all people should know that we’re in the business of hunting anything and everything that is special in this town. The fact that you immediately jumped to
Clint only regards Kate with desolate eyes. There is barely any light left in them, which has Kate worrying for him even more. She prods him with his elbow to speak. “You don’t need to do this,” he finally says. “I can handle this on my own.”
“All the more reason for her to go,” Tony suggests. “Hill gets riled up when Pepper argues with her. She loses her composure, which exposes her weaknesses. Pep should go.” He makes a few notes on his tablet. “And I’ll talk to Clint, ask him to take the temperature of the bill in the Senate.” They all nod in agreement. “Are we good? Then meeting is adjourned.”
“When my assistant told me that she was going have a car fetch me this morning, I didn’t expect the army.”
Tony and Foggy shake hands. “So,” the Speaker preludes. “Care to share to the class what monsters have been hiding under the floorboards?”
Tony snickers. “We’re going to have a Republican administration. I don’t think there is a silver lining.”
“What the hell is Oscorp doing with smuggled vibranium?” Janet asks the group, unnerved. “They’re biochemical, they don’t deal with nuclear-grade metal.”
He pouts at her. “Well, you have no cause for complaint. Your callsign is cool. ‘Black Widow’—sounds like something coming out of a spy movie.”
“I think she’s more concerned about containing the story rather than me getting my feelings hurt, if that’s what you’re asking,” Tony tells her with scoff.
Jane stops, surprised. The call is almost always never for her. “Mine, really?” She grabs the phone on her nightstand and looks at the screen. “It’s Darcy,” she grumbles, but answers the call anyway. “This better be good or I’m going to tell Clint to fire you.”
Cassie leaves the two men alone and they fall into a heavy silence, trying not to meet each other’s eyes. After weeks of radio silence, Steve doesn’t know how to approach him, let alone begin apologizing for what happened during that disastrous afternoon in the Oval Office.
Steve looks at him inquisitively, eyes twinkling in the dim light of the library. “Of course. She’s family.”
“Uh, sure, but that’s not even remotely the coolest thing in this room. Here, catch.” Tony tosses a small slab of rectangular glass at him, edges made blunt by a thick, red rubber framing.
Clint sees the alarm pass through Natasha’s face for a split second. “If he’s going to be distracted all night, that’s going to be a problem.”
They talk more about what they’ve missed in each other’s lives. The food is long gone and beers are slowly being consumed. It’s comfortable and fun, and Kate can’t believe she had gone without her best friend for more than half a year. She has missed hanging out, public roles tucked away for later, and just being the Kate and Clint before the Speakership, before the Capitol—the Kate and Clint of Hell’s Kitchen, New York City, who wreaked havoc at Morningside Heights during Kate’s years at Columbia; who knew all the Halal guys’ names and ate at all the good food trucks in the city; who gave the DNC a headache with Clint’s continued participation in their shenanigans. They gave no fucks and took no shit from anyone.
Killian waves it off. “Ah, it’s not life or death. I just had to try. Thank you for considering it, Mr. Secretary.”
“I didn’t need to. Maria Hill is the most powerful Republican in the House. The press will put two and two together.”
Tony catches Steve’s eye before he leaves for the Oval, and the President gives him a small smile and a nod. It’s not over yet. There is still much work to be done.
“Don’t let Natasha hear you say that,” Tony says, still chuckling. “Seriously, can you imagine me as the President of the United States?”
“Wow,” Thor declares in between breaths after their nth orgasm. “I would give Tony an expensive bottle of wine as thanks, but seeing as that would be inappropriate, I think I would rather drink it in his honor.”
“Tell me about it,” she jokes and takes one last sip of her drink. “Anyway, I really just wanted to drop by to pass on my congratulations to everyone.” She kisses him on the cheek. “I’ll see you in DC.”
to the industry that had raised him and treated him as high-prized commodity from the moment he learned to say
Tony raises his eyebrow even higher. “Why would Fury call in your super secret spy club when we're doing well? There's no insurgency from either radical ends of the parties to merit a code green. And with Coulson, too? What did they want, a dance showdown?”
She walks slowly across the room, greeting people she’s acquainted with along the way, all the while keeping her mark within her line of sight. After extracting a $150,000 pledge from the CEO of a skyrocketing IT company, she finds Aldrich Killian chatting vociferously with some very senior people from the State Department, one of which she knows quite well.
Jessica ducks her head, self-conscious. Carol has always thought highly of her, and trusting her with this case makes that very clear. That thought, however, makes her even more nervous.
For a moment Tony thinks Steve has forgotten that they’re in a room full of other people and not just on the phone. Lucky for Steve, Tony almost never forgets to stay in character because he’s always putting on a show. He flashes the President his campaign smile, the one that’s won over his district for six consecutive elections. “When am I never?”
“Don’t worry about me, Tony,” she tells him with a mischievous glint in her eye. “I can see myself out. Go. I’m sure he’s waiting for you.”
He’s in the middle of formulating talking points for the current draft of the new banking bill when he hears a soft knock on his door. “Come in,” he says, not taking his eyes off his tablet.
Tony shrugs, trying to keep his demeanor nonchalant and non-confrontational. “I’m not. I’m just being realistic.”
Jessica shakes her head. “No. The FBI is working on getting a warrant to search the New York office, but I suspect the vibranium will be long gone by the time FBI agents set foot in the Oscorp building.”
It took a while before he got his artistic bearings back—the last time he had picked up a brush was before Peggy’s death—but once it came to him, he poured his heart and soul onto that canvas.
Jane and Thor look at each other, confusion and disquiet clear on their faces. “Did he say why my brother is here?” Thor asks carefully.
Phil nods. “If we want a reasonable and balanced budget, we should not leave the kids to play without supervision.”
Bruce leans back on his chair and eyes the President carefully. “I was wondering how you had been able to get around Congress without going through our kids at Congressional Liaison.”
They walk with her into the warehouse, their footsteps echoing in the empty space. It’s freezing, but Natasha and Clint try not to let the cold seep into their bones.
Tony, in a moment of unusual decision-making, decides not to tell his team about the agreement he has with the President. This creates a rift in his equilibrium and completely throws off his juju, because as much as he keeps his private life to himself, anything regarding work is public domain, and necessarily so. His team is effective because they are honest with each other, no holds barred. Still, for the life of him, Tony can’t bring himself to tell the others.
“Did you know that Alexander Pierce was retiring?” he asks Tony the moment the Speaker takes the call.
“We made good progress this morning. I would think late tomorrow, or maybe early the day after that?”
“No, I—“ Tony gathers the rest of his belongings and heads back to the bed to give Steve a kiss. “I would have wanted to stay longer but I have to go take care of something. I’m really sorry.”
With Kate on board, Tony gets to relax a little, but he cannot rest on his laurels. Each day that passes is a day closer to the deadline. Congress, especially the House, is in complete disarray. His team is on battle mode, absolutely unmerciful and bloodthirsty. Honestly, he will never be prouder of his party than when Pepper and Wade go head to head with Hill and her second-in-command at the House, Congressman Barnes. He’s sure Natasha is working her magic behind the scenes, and he’s almost certain that in some way or another, she’s working with Fury to put Hill and her lackeys in place.
“I trust you know how the game is played.” Tony opens the car door for her and they both slide in. “But you do look stunning, Ru,” he compliments her as they settle in the limousine. She only smiles.
“See Cass, if you’d gone to Georgetown like I suggested, you would be able to say you went to the President’s alma mater,” Tony teases her.
“Oh God, I feel like I’m eighteen again, and Obadiah’s trying his best to convince me not to drop out of MIT and transfer to Stanford. ‘Boy, do you know what you’re getting yourself into?’” he mimics with a look of disgust. “For the love of God, Kate, when did I ever make wrong judgments about these things? No, really, tell me because I’m standing in the Speaker’s office with no recollection whatsoever of ever getting here.”
Carol chuckles. “I’d be surprised if you weren’t. You’ll do great. I would know, I chose you to lead this case after all.”
“You know we’re just teasing, Uncle Tones,” Cassie says as she gives him a side hug. “Come on, let’s head to the kitchen and show the President our amazing cooking skills.”
“Let me get this straight.” Natasha gives Coulson and Fury a hard look. “You couldn’t get the information you wanted from your own people, so you decided to browbeat us into submission.” She laughs darkly. “Classy, very classy, Fury.”
That’s when it hits him. He bows his head and laughs under his breath. “Oh Carol, you fucking genius.” Tony turns to Kate. “I need you to get me Matt Murdock on the phone right away, then tell our friend in Hoover to expect a call from me ASAP. Have Darcy pull Clint out of whoever he’s having lunch with today.”
Bruce is informed ten minutes later that the Democrats have arrived. The Republicans straighten up and Bruce asks his assistant to inform the President, to which his assistant acknowledges with a terse nod. He really should have briefed the staff about dealing with the Democrats—the most important thing to know about them is that they feed on your fear. He makes a mental note for future reference.
“For the love that is all pure and holy, Hill, that is not your chamber anymore! Or have you not noticed Stark standing on the Speaker’s rostrum these past six months?” Fury stops for a moment and takes a deep breath to calm himself down. He begins again, his voice softer but still unrelenting. “You have to suck it up, Hill. We lost the House, and you lost the Speakership. Get over it and start
Clint arrives at Tony’s house twenty minutes past six. Clint is always the first to arrive—pre-session quickie, as dubbed by Darcy. Consequently, it has encouraged numerous catcalls (ahem, Wade) and innuendos (Tony), but the truth is that Clint and Tony are surprisingly great friends.
The dinner goes exceedingly well, and the turkey is a hit, prompting more back and forth from Tony and Cassie. Steve finds all of this highly entertaining and enlightening, making him hope that one day, if he would ever have a daughter, his relationship with her would be just like Tony’s relationship with Cassie—open, candid, and unabashedly honest. It’s a pity that not a lot of people see this side of Tony, but Steve understands why Tony would like to keep this part of his life behind closed doors.
Foggy glances at Matt. His partner takes a moment, dips his head to think about the benefits of sharing sensitive information with Elektra. She is an old flame, and an old friend. They have a troubled, toxic history behind them, but it’s not one without respect, loyalty, trust, and love. Fire and ice, Foggy used to say.
It’s not the first time since Thanksgiving that he’s visiting the White House at an odd hour, but unlike the other two times, it’s Tony who picks up the phone and suggests the visit. He fought against the urge to go running to Steve after that short but taxing meeting with Natasha and Clint, but something had to give. It was going to be either his sanity or pride, and he chose to go with the latter.
First of all, MY BIGGEST APOLOGIES for the two-month wait for this chapter. After I returned from the convention I attended last November and December, we planned to begin writing as soon as I landed on home turf, but unfortunately my university had other plans for me and decided to bombard me with schoolwork for the last two weeks of classes before the holidays. And holidays are just the absolute WORST time for me to write. Good thing I managed to get my bearings once the new year rolled around, and my co-authors and I actually finished this within a week!
give Maria Hill the authority to do whatever she pleases. I don’t know if it’s because we’ve been too remiss as the administration or if Hill and the others are planning shenanigans behind our backs.” He takes a moment to regain his composure. “If any of you have heard whispers from anyone in the Party, I would like the both of you to be honest with me now, please.”
Tony sighs. “You trust me, right?” He’s relieved when Steve nods, ignores the resigned look on his beautiful face. Tony gives him a deeper, more emotional kiss, as if to relay what he cannot verbally express to Steve. “Thank you.”
“Yes. Alexander Pierce, Loki Odinson, Richard Parker, Foggy’s Ohio case—these are all somehow connected, and perhaps even bigger than we could ever imagine. After today, I have more pieces of the puzzle, sure, but the more pieces I get, the more questions I have.” Tony rubs his temple in frustration. “I’m not ready to give all this information to the President, but I can’t go to him empty-handed either.”
“Hey!” Darcy greets as they enter the house. “Guess what the Davidsons had for us this Thanksgiving?”
would be a normal Tony response to that particular predicament, but these are extenuating circumstances with what could possibly be high stakes, even if it’s not entirely clear what those are just yet. He can’t afford to go rogue.
is yours.” She hands him a family-sized box of pizza, and on top of it is a plate of Pop Tarts and his own carton of shrimp dumplings—
“We’ll figure it out later, okay?” Steve nods at that. “And in the meantime, maybe you should stop blushing. Cassie will see right through that.” That earns him an honest-to-goodness laugh.
Tony turns off the shower and wallows in the mist for a moment, listening as the water drips down onto the bathroom floor. He sighs in defeat.
The Democrats mill about for a few more minutes and say their holiday greetings and goodbyes. Tony and Jessica are huddled in a corner, some ways away from the well-wishing bunch that had congregated in the middle of the room.
He picks up the phone before he can change his mind. “Congressman!” Steve greets as lively and as at ease as possible. He doesn’t want this phone call to be enveloped in awkwardness.
Pepper dries her hands and gives her fiancé a peck on the lips. “Thanks, honey. I’ll make it up to you, I promise.”
Anne and Clint watch as Henry gets out of the car with Darcy and Kate, all three of them bringing what Clint assumes are more food items to be consumed for Thanksgiving dinner. All three are laughing through their conversation, and, despite being an agnostic, Clint can’t help but say a little prayer of thanks for the privilege to experience this kind of warmth during a holiday that more often than not he had always been indifferent to.
Steve sees Tony break into a genuine, happy expression as they walk towards the center of the dance floor.
Don’t get him wrong—he doesn’t hate Hill. She’s a fierce woman and a reasonably good lawmaker, but she’s the product of everything Nick abhors about the Republican Party. The bullying and the scheming are not things Nick can tolerate very often, and he’s scolded Hill about her methods time and time again, but Maria Hill listens to absolutely no one, and Nick absolutely
“But it’s your party, Mr. President,” Tony points out, a small, impish smile playing across his lips, as if daring Steve to do something. “And there are two lovely ladies sitting with us here tonight.”
“I hope you’re right.” Pepper opens her mouth but hesitates for a split second, as if she’s still trying to muster up some courage. “So, Natasha. How are you doing?”
“I know,” he tells her honestly. There is a hint of sadness in his voice. Whatever he and Pepper had… Those were some really good times. He lets out a soft moan. “Why can’t I quit you, Pepper Potts?”
“What about Budapest, Tash?” He hates that his voice is small. He hates that he’s a fucking senator, goddammit, he can talk to a crowd of thousands and feel invincible, but in here, Natasha’s reduced him to this.
“There are other hands at play here,” Thor tells them, shaking his head. “Loki may be the mastermind of all this, or most likely he is just merely a pawn. Nonetheless, I feel that this may be much bigger than what we are all anticipating.”
“It might be,” Natasha answers honestly. “If we are being watched by Fury, Coulson, and their merry men, it will be because they don’t want us interfering with ongoing investigations, whether they be in the DOJ or the Pentagon. If someone else is watching us…then they don’t want us getting any closer than we already are.”
Tony shrugs, a little reluctant. “I don’t have a problem with it, but I should probably ask Cassie first.”
“There were papers strewn everywhere, formulas and numbers all over the place,” Cassie tells him, gesticulating enthusiastically to prove her point. “Half the kitchen was filled with math, the other half with the actual stuff we needed to make the dinner. It was complete chaos.”
His assistant notifies him that the Republicans have entered the building, and Bruce heads to the Roosevelt Room to welcome them. Of course, Hill is there, along with Senator Reed Richards and other Congressmen and Senators who are important members of the Budget and Appropriations Committees of their respective houses.
“Your boss certainly knows how to overreact, doesn’t he? When you report to him later tonight, tell him I am as beautiful and as wonderful as ever.” He pats Dugan twice on the cheek and contemplates his handlebar mustache. “And your mustache is as fantastic as ever, Dugan. Tell me, how do you keep it so…twirly?”
A hand squeezes her shoulder gently. She turns around to see Carol standing behind her, giving her a reassuring and encouraging smile
He slips into his bed and is not surprised that he can’t sleep. Melancholy does that to him sometimes, so tries to get his mind whirring by sketching new designs and trying out new calculations on his tablet, as well as outlining a strategy for dealing with Loki and Pierce.
“That you do,” she says with a smug smile. She stands up to leave. “I’ll call you when I have something. See you boys around.”
This, then, is the unexpected. To go into a some sort of clandestine agreement with the President is something no one would ever dare expect of him—if Kate, his long-time assistant and perhaps the person who knows him best in this world, was utterly dumbfounded and even outraged about it, then this wouldn’t even fly in Maria Hill’s radar. Taking Maria Hill out of the picture is only way Tony sees that things can move forward and not screw them from behind.
Before anyone can answer that, Darcy barges in through the front door, Clint trailing behind her, exclaiming, “Victory is mine, victory is mine! Bring me the finest libations in all the land.”
“I just…I wanted to thank you for helping out with the budget. I don’t think I’d have gotten out of that one alive without you.”
He stands up and prepares to leave for the Capitol, Pepper following suit. They wait for their ride in the living room, both of them fiddling with their phones to check e-mails and messages in relative peace, emotions of their exchange not ten minutes before left behind in Tony’s bedroom.
“It is what it is, Clint,” Natasha responds, her tone a mixture of slightly annoyed and slightly amused.
Tony laughs, hiding the melancholy simmering underneath the surface. “It’s alright, Pep. I’m looking forward to a quiet weekend. Haven’t had that in a while since…you know.”
“God, I can’t believe you two are ganging up on me. Should we use this time of reflection and giving thanks to stop verbally assaulting Tony Stark or do you both want to starve tonight?”
This is why he can be scared of Romanoff. She makes him do things he doesn’t want to do—even when she’s right. “This is Fury. I need to speak to the President.”
Tony gives her a brilliant smile. “Yes, and she’s a willing accomplice,” he answers, and says nothing more on the matter.
He knows for sure that when he’s old and gray, he’ll look back at this moment and think that this was the turning point, the game changer for him. He won’t know yet where and how he’ll be when he takes a trip down memory lane to this particular point in his life, but Tony’s got a feeling that this ride to the Hill, this phone call, is one for the books. So he takes a deep breath and trusts the one thing that has never failed him—his instincts. “Tony,” he tells the President kindly.
“And you told none of us of this plan of yours?” Natasha is clearly a little pissed off about being left in the dark by her own people. Again.
It's easy enough to hate those from across the aisle, but no one ever told them that it was bad news to fall in love with the enemy.
Again, please drop a word of encouragement at the comments section. Better yet, tell me what you think! I love it when you guys are so enthusiastic about these lovely characters.
But it’s still not enough. Tony can’t make sense of how strong a hold the Republicans have in his chamber when his party holds the majority. He’s been in this business way too long—he has gotten most of the habits down, the patterns, and really after 22 years of being in politics, he has figured out how everything works around here. So why then is Maria Hill still able to get one step ahead of him if he knows every trick in the book?
Those keep his mind occupied for the better part of half an hour, but then the loneliness sets in again and he throws his tablet across his bed in frustration, burying his face in his hands. He doesn’t want to go down to his workshop tonight—the past couple of weeks has left him extremely exhausted, and he needs at least a week of good nights’ rest to recuperate from the drama of the shutdown. He’s just getting old, really, and he’s far from being a superhero. He has a limit too.
He knew from the beginning that none of it was going to be easy, that it was going to be an uphill battle of epic proportions. He spent his first term weeding out the halfwits and bringing in the real deals. That’s how he discovered Rogers, when he was still the diffident senator from New Hampshire trying to fill in the shoes of a Republican giant. Michael Rogers was one of the good guys, a fine statesman and a true American. Nick had worked with the late senator whenever he could, but the young Steve had always just been on the sidelines. It wasn’t until the younger Rogers had been asked to take the wheel had Nick seen the immense potential in the kid, and when Nick had been elected to the chairmanship, he made sure that the whole country saw the promise of Steve Rogers.
As if on cue, Natasha’s phone rings and she answers it wordlessly, only to end the call moments after. She stands up without warning and beckons Pepper to accompany her to the bar inside, where the TV is set to one of the news channels. It’s Tony on screen, having a small press conference outside of the White House—gorgeous, charismatic, ex-fiancé Tony—and he’s taking it all in stride, milking the shutdown for all its worth. Pepper and Natasha watch intently.
“Knowing that he knows we’re making fun of him behind his back is half the fun,” Pepper teases, the accompanying smirk palpable across the line.
Natasha says nothing, which prompts Pepper to continue. “It’s like he has a plan that he’s not sharing with anyone else. I don’t know. I just don’t like the fact that he seems to be acting alone on this when we should be working together to grab this victory by the throat.”
“Well, you’re invited to come celebrate with us,” Tony offers tentatively, trying to salvage the moment. “It’s just me and Cassie, and we’ve got a huge turkey.”
Jessica shakes her head. “He’s clean, spotless even. But we’re digging deeper into both his personal and professional history to figure out why he did this, because that’s not very clear at this point. The DOJ is having a hard time establishing motive, and that is potentially where they could lose the case.”
“It’s not a bad idea and could come out good for this administration in the end,” Phil had said when Steve called his senior staff in to discuss about it a few days ago.
Tony gives her a displeased look. “Jessica Jones is dating the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. Why do we have to bring the President in when we have more than enough human resources at our disposal?”
“Err…” Tony scratches his chin. Kate waits for his response, eyes suspicious. “I wasn’t going to tell anyone else but you…”
“Wow, New York! I used to—“ His phone starts to ring and he stares at the unknown number of the screen for a few moments. This phone is his private one, and its number is only known by a select few. The fact that someone he doesn’t know is calling this number unsettles him.
“I did,” Darcy says proudly. “You’ll never believe what he told us.” She pauses and waits for any of them to ask, but they don’t. She clears her throat. “Loki’s here. In DC.”
“Maria Hill and her minions managed to insert a school prayer amendment into the bill,” Pepper informs them with a grimace on her face.
“So, can you show me how these things work?” he asks Tony, pointing at a pile of contraptions on one of his workbenches.
Steve laughs, and if Tony is honest with himself, he kind of likes that laugh. “Tony…” His tone is suddenly serious, if not also a little frustrated. “I’m counting on you for this. I’m counting on you to do what’s best for this country.”
Kate gives her a steely look, and begins to speak in a more professional tone. “I can understand if you don’t want to tell me the specifics of what the DOJ is up to, but it’s important that we know who’s in charge of the indictment. We want to help.”
Before Natasha has a chance to respond, the SHIELD car pulls up, and she gets in as fast as she can. Clint follows quickly, hoping to elicit an answer from her, but she’s looking away, and the deafening silence in the space between them means that the conversation is over.
Stan gives him a curt nod. “Yes, the President informed us that you will be preparing Thanksgiving dinner with him. We will be happy to bring those up to the President’s private kitchen and set it up for you.” He signals to the staff behind him and they start unloading the car. Stan extends his arm towards the inside of the Residence. “If you’ll follow me?”
“Uncle Tones, I was present and conscious during that Thanksgiving dinner. No man who looks at your ass that many times is straight or, you know,
It's easy enough to hate those from across the aisle, but no one ever told them that it was bad news to fall in love with the enemy.
Pepper laughs loudly. Hill fell right into her trap. “The Women’s Health Act can wait a little while longer, Hill. Your budget can’t.” She can tell she’s ruffled the Minority Leader’s feathers, so she pauses, gives her time to regroup. “So if you don’t back the hell away from our bill, I swear to that ever-loving god you so fervently pray to that we will do everything in our power to raise hell on your President’s beloved budget, and if this government shuts down, we’ll make sure that the whole country knows that the blame is entirely on your side of the aisle.” Maria is speechless, and the threat swells the tension around the two women.
But that was why he’d chosen Carol Danvers to be his Attorney General in the first place, despite major opposition from the most conservative members of his party. He needed someone with a tough, take-no-shit attitude that would stick to their principles no matter what.
were the one who ordered me to come here, Steve. I asked you to trust me and you demanded that I come here like a loyal servant.” Tony holds his steely gaze, unbowed. He’s tired of it all—tired of the games, tired of Steve ordering him to do things just because he can. If all these months had been a ruse, then he fell for it hook, line and sinker, didn’t he?
“So is this how it’s going to be?” Steve asks quietly. “Is this how you’re going to react every time something like this happens?”
“We just don’t work as a couple,” Tony concedes. And he knows that, really. He sighs and rubs a thumb along the back of her hand—an affectionate gesture Tony used to do when they were still together. “I just miss you sometimes.”
“You’re no fun.” Steve grumbled half-heartedly as he slapped Tony’s butt once again. Tony had only enough time to cry out before Steve buried the head of his cock inside him. The cry turned into a moan of pleasure as Steve penetrated him further, inch by inch. Once he was buried to the hilt, he noticed Tony breathing quicker than he should, and stayed there.
Steve let out a pleased rumble when Tony scratched lightly at his scalp, and kissed his omega soundly until he was panting for breath. Their bodies moved against each other languidly, and Tony just loved the feel of Steve’s fuzzy hair over those hard muscles of his chest rubbing against his back.
“Only for you, omega. You are so good for me. Oh!” Steve gasped when Tony stroked a nipple with his tongue.
Steve lives a healthy life to near the end of the twenty-first century. He had begun to notice the effects of the serum to subside faster over the last few years. He is no longer built like the Super Soldier he used to be what feels like eons ago, though he’s not back to being skinny either. He looks like any old man pushing ninety. The day he passes, is the day he has been looking forward to with the nervous excitement of a child, for the past thirty-five years.
“Will you come for me, Sweetheart?” Steve murmured in Tony’s ear, and his husky voice was enough to set off the omega, who went rigid momentarily before his cock pulsed with the orgasm that hit him like a bus. He moaned out aloud as he came all over his and his alpha’s hands. Tony was breathing heavily, and Steve held him close as the omega came down from his high, peppering kisses over his neck and shoulders all the while.
“Shh…” Tony placed a finger against Steve’s luscious lips, “I do the talking, alright?” he stood on his tiptoes to wrap his arms around his alpha’s neck.
Steve shuffled behind Tony, lining up his giant erection with Tony’s petite entrance. Their difference in size always amazed the alpha. Back when they had sex for the first time, he’d never imagined Tony would be able to accommodate his massive girth inside him, let alone his length, but lo and behold, his omega had not only proven him wrong, he’d more than enjoyed it.
Tony let out a moan as his alpha grabbed both their cocks in one hand and began stroking them oh so slowly. He brought his hand to join his alpha’s, and they both ground their bodies against each other until Tony was a whimpering mess.
Steve could see the bright red blush on Tony’s cheeks creeping down his neck, only to disappear under the collar of the red-and-black plaid shirt hugging his frame. Their bodies were less than an inch apart, and Steve could very easily feel the heat of arousal radiating from his omega. “I do. I’m gonna spank that cute little ass so hard, you ain’t gonna walk properly or sit right for weeks.”
Steve felt the omega’s hole clamp down around his cock, and he quickened his pace even more. It wasn’t long before the alpha came inside his omega with a shout, filling up his inside with his hot seed. Steve came for what had to be more than two minutes, each pulsation filling up his omega even more. He settled Tony down onto the mattress, and dropped himself on top of him, catching his breath while making sure not to throw his entire weight on the omega.
Tony only nodded in response, dropping a quick peck on Steve’s lips. Once he was comfortable enough with the stretch, he moved further to take in his alpha’s entire length inside. They both moaned as the shaft disappeared inside the omega, muscle clenching tighter with every inch. Tony had to wait for his entrance to loosen up once he was buried to the hilt, and he began to move once again, lazily.
Steve doesn’t understand how he could have been fortunate enough to have a man like Tony Stark love him, especially after their history from the day when they first met, to the day that Tony slammed his arc reactor in his hands, calling him a liar. He knows he’d always been dismissive of him, that he’d always seen Stark, not Tony, not the sweet, caring, loving person that he was underneath all that hard exterior. He hadn’t really seen that Tony until he saw him being a father to Morgan, the kind of father Tony should have had.
. I’ve been very naughty, you see, and I think my punishment has to be just as fitting, don’t you think?” Tony didn’t even realize Steve was backing him against a wall until his back hit it. It was really hot, getting crowded by his alpha like that.
“Such a needy alpha…” Tony giggled even as he pressed the head of Steve’s cock against his hole, stroking it slowly. The Super Soldier whimpered at the teasing, but was helpless against his restraints when all he wanted to do was have his dick inside Tony.
“You’re damn right.” Steve grunted and let Tony down on his feet. The next moment, the Super Soldier leaned in to press his lips to the omega’s in a hungry kiss, while his hands tried to unbutton the shirt. He was definitely focused on the kiss more than unbuttoning Tony’s shirt, because after a few minutes of fumbling around with those pesky things that wouldn’t come off, the alpha growled into the kiss, a deep rumble vibrating in his chest.
So much stimulation all at once; Tony’s hole was being licked expertly by his alpha’s strong tongue, his dick was being stroked slow enough for it to be torture, and the slaps that landed on his ass every few seconds. It was too much and not enough at the same time, and Tony let out a scream, muffled into the mattress.
“Did you build more muscle while you were away?” Tony quirked an eyebrow, though he couldn’t stop drooling at the sight before him.
Tony surged up to kiss his alpha, catching the taste of his own slick on the panties before he dropped them, focusing on the feel and warmth of Steve’s mouth fully. His arms wrapped around Steve’s neck pulling him even closer. Steve lost his balance at the sudden jerk, and fell on top of the omega, punching the air from his lungs. Tony broke the kiss with a laugh, making the alpha giggle as well.
Steve added a second finger, and began to scissor them apart, and was rewarded with his omega’s whimpers. He took a moment to taste some of the slick leaking out of Tony’s slit, teasing the lips there. Oh how eager he was for the day they were finally married and his omega finally went into heat only and only for him. Then they could finally be mates, something he’d been dreaming of ever since he met this wonderful human being. The alpha felt a rush of possessiveness stir in him, and it was elating.
Tony broke the kiss a long while later to catch his breath. He was panting a little as he pulled away from the alpha. A nervous laugh escaped him as he tried to get his mind back on track. “Come on, my Soldier, we’ve got stuff to do…”
Steve wants to tell him how someone reminded him of the first time he met Tony. “I’m okay,” he says instead, “let’s get home.”
“I am not going to shimmy out of my pants.” Steve spoke firmly, crossing his hands over his chest, making his pecs bulge out even more, though the effect was dampened by his huge cock hanging out his zipper as it gave a twitch at the suggestion.
Steve chuckled at his omega, pulling him up flush against his chest, the cool feel of his dog-tags giving him a rush of affection for the gorgeous omega he was so lucky enough to have. He placed kisses over Tony’s neck, trailing them along a shoulder, then along his jaw, to meet his lips with his own in a soft, chaste kiss. “What’s the matter, Sweetheart?”
Tony couldn’t help feeling shy at the praise. They had known each other for over two years now, and were in courtship for one-and-a-half, and even the simplest of praises from his alpha had him blushing like a virgin. “Flatterer.”
Nearly five years later, the couple welcomed their twins, Sarah Maria, and James Phillip Stark-Rogers. Steve had been so nervous about being a father, he didn’t know what to do. It was Tony who assured him that he’d been brilliant with Morgan, and he’d be just as good with the twins too.
“But they do! And they look so…so…sexy.” Tony bit his lower lip suggestively. He walked over to his alpha, needing his closeness and touch. “Everything about you is sexy, my alpha, even if you find it embarrassing. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise, least of all yourself.”
Tony nods, “Good, because this can be permanent.” They hold hands, walking up to the ramp where they shared their first kiss as husbands. “First kiss of the afterlife?” he asks, quirking an eyebrow.
Sitting there watching Steve, Tony wondered what the man would look like in the following months as their baby grew inside of him. He liked the thought of seeing the omega with a belly and knowing that it was because of him. There were a lot of implications that thought had, but for now, Tony was happy to push figuring them out later.
Steve noticed a slight look of fear in Tony’s eyes at his words. He reached up to rest his hand at Tony’s jaw, puzzled by the slight flinch that was given in response.
By the time he got to Carol and Rhodey’s doorstep, Tony was already keyed up and ready to spill all of his thoughts in exchange for advice. He knocked twice before the door swung open to reveal Carol, wearing a sweatshirt and workout shorts.
“So normally I would tell you to go in there and do that Pepper thing that gets him to do stuff,” Rhodey explained, standing outside of he and Tony’s dorm room.
He resumed his position on the floor, kneeling on a couch pillow. Steve’s eyes were growing darker as he watched Tony slowly undo the zipper in front of him. They worked together to remove Steve’s pants and boxers. Once his cock was free, Steve let out a sigh of relief that gave way to a choked off groan as Tony swallowed him whole. He gave the blond less than a second to adjust to the feeling around him before beginning to move. Steve’s hand scrambled for purchase, landing at the back of Tony’s head. He tangled his fingers in the hair beneath them, and let out a moan that went straight to Tony's dick.
“Oh wow, okay well..thanks, Tony. Is there anything in particular I need to know before our first...meeting? Practice?” Steve asked, a little unsure of whether this was more of a sport or just a club.
“I don’t think I can today. Coulson asked me to come to his office at noon to talk about something, but I don’t know what it is or how long it’ll take.”
“Honey, she’s not in the computer, she’s in England with your Granmom and Grandad, remember?” Steve reminded Cora. She nodded, as if she understood, then turned to look at the screen again.
Steve looked down at his shake with a shy smile as Tony and Peter began talking about something relating to the physics classroom. For the following two days, Steve tried not to get too in his head about it all, but with every passing conversation between him and the brunet, where they’d sort out bits and pieces of their day, Steve grew more and more nervous. Now that the day was here, he felt like he could burst with happiness and puke all at once.
Tony sat next to a large window in the corner of his favorite coffee shop. As he watched the people walking by on the street, snowflakes falling around them, he took a sip of his latte and savored the warmth that it brought him. It was moments like this that Tony felt he was truly able to enjoy the world around him.
as he glided around the kitchen, getting everything in order. It was Christmas morning, his very first Christmas as Tony’s boyfriend, and he wanted to make sure he gave the man he loved so much reason to finally love the holiday too.
“I’ve been feeling like shit for the past week or so, but it’s not that serious. It’s winter, I clearly just have some kind of bug, I’ll be fine.”
What started as a chaste kiss to the tattoo turned into a trail of biting and licking and sucking as Tony worked his way across Steve’s neck and chest, leaving hickey after hickey. Steve was helpless to do anything else besides hold onto Tony’s hips, rubbing the tattoo with his thumb.
A few minutes passed before the alpha got the courage to ask what had been on his mind since Steve had woken up.
“You didn’t do anything wrong here, Stevie,” Bucky said, gently. “From what you told us, there’s a whole shitstorm going on that has absolutely nothing to do with you. It sucks that you got swept up in it, but this is not your fault.”
As if on cue, Steve heard his phone chirp, indicating a new text message. He slowly moved to reach for the device on his nightstand, and felt a shudder run through him when he saw that the message was from Tony.
“Have any tunes you’d like to listen to?” Tony asked, as if he could sense Steve’s minor crisis over what to do during their drive.
“I just...I don’t really know how to explain it,” Tony said, frustrated that he couldn’t find a way to verbalize his worries.
Tony made his way down until he was at the top of Steve’s jeans. They hadn’t done anything besides kissing since their adventure during
After finding out about the AI being used, Tony started doing some digging. It wasn’t as easy as he’d have liked to get his hands on video footage of their meets without raising any alarms that something was wrong. Once they’d made it to the second to last meet and ended up doing well enough to place as one of four teams competing at finals, though, Tony was able to mask his request for the footage. As soon as he said they needed it to study and assess their previous meets to strategize for finals, the robotics league was more than happy to turn over what they had. By the time finals had arrived, Tony had been able to parse through enough footage to realize that the DeWitt Clinton High School team had been using general intelligence, but had only implemented it in a single bot. Moreover, they would only ever use that bot sparingly; never as a primary player on the field, just kind of...there almost as if for show only. None of it made sense, but luckily Tony was able to get a closer look because the DeWitt team had made it to finals as well.
There were far too many layers between them. They were separated by winter coats, sweaters, and t-shirts and all Steve wanted was to feel Tony’s skin against his. He fumbled to unzip Tony’s jacket, but the zipper got stuck halfway down.
“That right there is what I’m talking about. You hide behind your wit and sarcasm when you don’t need to.”
“I came here to do this,” Steve said, before leaning up, wrapping his hands around the brunet’s neck, and pulling him down for quite possibly one of the most amaziNg kisses Tony had ever been a part of.
“Oh, uh…” Steve began, taking out his phone and swiping through. He’d come across his ‘Arting’ playlist that he’d listen to while drawing or painting. It’d become one of his favorites, but he was somewhat self conscious about sharing this playlist in particular. Before he had a chance to select something else, Tony reached over and pointed to a song.
He considered everything about the day that they had spent together. Steve was an absolutely amazing guy, but was he really ready to date a man with a child?
The two sat in silence for a moment, finally reaching the doctor’s office. Once Natasha parked the car, she turned to Steve with a look that he’d come to equate with excitement coming from her.
“You know what about. I’ve been keeping my distance since I found out about Steve being pregnant, but I think it’s time we actually talked about this.”
“Please, boy, sit down before you get too worked up. These people, you think you love them, and that they love you. But you know as well as I do, the second they find out who you are, who we are and all that you have, they’ll use you and rob you of all that you have.”
Steve gave an apologetic look before heading back to his desk, to get as much done before his meeting as he could. Now time seemed to move faster than he could keep up with, and when Steve finally looked up it was time for his meeting. He got up, slowly, and walked towards Coulson’s office, knocking lightly when he got there.
“Oh...yeah. So, I was minding my business in the parking lot, when I saw this gorgeous hunk of sexiness dead in his car.”
It only took a split second to realize that Peter had placed Tony next to Steve, standing with them on either side behind him. It was evident that Peter was pleased with himself, even if Tony wasn’t able to see the smug grin on the boy’s face. The second the flash went off, Tony felt the man beside him tense up. He quickly turned to smile up at Steve, but was met with a look of apprehension. Tony wondered, momentarily, if he should just give up and call the whole night a failure, but the second his phone began to vibrate in his pocket, he knew that it was now or never.
“I’m nineteen and I have a daughter. That’s a lot more than most people want to take on when they start dating someone.”
Every moment that passed felt like an eternity as Steve tried to keep the tears away. He kept reminding himself that they weren’t too far and once they got to his apartment, he could let everything all out. Holding on for that long felt almost impossible but the second they got to his building, up the elevator and inside his apartment, he fell to the floor, finally able to let go.
“Sorry to bother you,” Tony apologized, taking a single step into the room, “I have these sweats from a friend who’s about the same size as you, if you wanted something dry to wear.”
“Is that what you’re listening to?” she asked, sitting on the edge of his bed. He nodded and made a pitiful whine.
"Alright, well I'm going to go register for more baby stuff with Pepper, Natasha and Carol," Steve said, maneuvering to get up out of his seat.
Once that day came, Steve and Tony were anxious, to say the least, but excited for their family to finally be whole. Placing her in her carseat was quite possibly the most nerve wracking thing, the pair of them taking turns in wondering if they had set everything up right, if she was comfortable, if a meteor would fall from the sky and strike their car on the ride home. Thankfully, none of their fears came to fruition, as they had quite possibly the most calm New York drive of their life.
“I think there’s a bar at the indoor market if you’re interested in a drink,” Steve offered casually.
His daughter had become a nightmare and he was scared. He had no one to turn to and no idea what to do.
Steve stood, and made his way for the door to leave. Tony sat there, dumbfounded at what had just happened, when Natasha ran over.
“Well, someone did say something about grabbing a drink bby , and now that my afternoon has just been freed up, I’d love to hijack your processing session to tell you all about it!”
The pair sat there naked for a moment, Tony eventually moving to give Steve a soft kiss. “Are you ready?” Tony asked, looking for any signs of hesitation. All he saw, though, was a look of happiness and possibly something he didn't dare to pinpoint, as Steve confidently answered yes.
He looked up to see Rhodey just shaking his head. “Alright well I hope he works out, for your sake and for the team’s. Those kids deserve to have good, competent coaches.”
“No worries, it’s not important,” Tony assured, “so what were you saying about the coding that the woman in purple had used?”
He really had thought he was happy with Ty at the time, but it didn’t take long to realize that he was becoming a shadow of his former self. Tony had always been boisterous, opinionated and self assured. However, around Ty, he became meek, he never said anything contrary to what Ty thought and he began to doubt himself. It took a lot of convincing from Rhodey and Pepper for Tony to realize that he needed to get out of the relationship, and after a handful of failed attempts, Tony finally walked away. Since then, Tiberius had taken any chance he could get to try to slither his way back into Tony’s life.
“Ah, well I’ve got to go. Cora’s coming over today, and I promised I’d be around to play with her while Steve got some homework done.”
A grin spread across his face as his eyebrow shot up towards his hairline. Pepper couldn’t help but laugh.
With that out of the way, Tony flagged down a taxi, and once inside he began his nightly text conversation with Steve. When he finally got home, Tony immediately started on dinner, never once letting his phone leave his side.
“Things are definitely going! We’ve partnered with several different shelters and organizations in order to create a structured program for kids from kindergarten through high school seniors. We’re doing a lot of outreach now to find art teachers, retired or currently working, who can take on classes after school or on the weekends. We're also trying to work out some kind of program with the Smithsonian, but we’ve just got to take everything one step at a time.” Steve looked up to see Tony staring at him, giving a smile as they walked. “Sorry, I just...I get carried away talking about the company sometimes.”
“You didn’t have to say anything. How long have I known you, Anthony Edward Stark? You don’t think I would have noticed how hard you’ve been trying to make sure that everything is perfect for when Steve shows up? Clearly, you’ve got a thing for the guy.”
“I know that, Stevie, I meant why don’t you take up bartending as a second job. I could teach you a few things to help fast track you through your certification.”
Steve followed along, picking up his bag and bringing it with him. He stepped into the bathroom to change into his pyjama pants and a thin t-shirt before brushing his teeth. When he emerged, Tony sat on the right side of the bed, scrolling through his phone as he sat under the covers. Once Steve joined him, Tony moved to lay down, putting his phone on the night stand as he reached for the light switch. “Good night, Steve,” he said softly.
“Thanks...Jarvis?” Steve asked more than stated as he stepped out into the workshop. Initially, all he saw were tables cluttered with tools and parts, but after a moment, Steve’s eyes locked in on a sight that made his mouth go dry instantly.
She moved to give Tony a soft kiss on the cheek before leaving the house for good. He stood there, stumbling to find words. His brain was screaming for him to say something but his mouth just wouldn't work the way he wanted. He stood there, practically paralyzed, as the only woman he thought would ever love him walked away.
“Great! Good luck and have fun dealing with the gremlins!” Tony said, bouncing on his toes as he turned to walk towards his classroom.
It took a moment for Tony to catch on, but once realization hit, he took Steve’s face into his hands. “Of course I meant it. You’re
“I promise,” the brunet offered, crossing his heart. Pepper gave him a small nod, and a peck on the cheek before leaving to return back to her work.
Tony sat on his couch, curled up with a hot mug of coffee and a Stark Pad, reading through Maria Stark Foundation proposals, when JARVIS let out a chime.
Friday at work came and went, much faster than he anticipated, but the drive seemed never ending. Steve felt as though he had a million thoughts running through his mind, trying to figure out what to say, wondering what his mother would think. He was practically making himself sick with the thought of how terribly this could go. As he pulled into the assisted living facility, he had to remind himself to breath.
Bruce and Peter thought over the question, when the teen snapped his fingers. “The dance that’s coming up might be a good option.”
“So now that we’ve all got our caffeine, why’d you call me here?” Natasha asked, getting straight to the point.
“I’d like to wake him up if we could,” Steve said, still looking at the bot with something like pride, “just to make sure everything still works as it should.”
“I guess you’re right,” Tony whispered. No, he would not cry. Stop it. Stop closing, throat. “I’m really sorry, Steve.”
“Of course, Peter. Pull up a seat. I don’t really have any extra work for you to do but if you wanted to do any of your other class work you’re more than welcome to!”
“We literally just made out for like… an hour. I don’t think we can just start over,” Tony said around a laugh.
Tony gave a small nod, feeling that the least he could do right now was oblige the omega before completely shattering everything. Steve took a deep breath before he began.
“What’s that goofy grin for?” Tony asked, taking a sip of his soda. His cup was almost empty and he played up the obnoxious slurping sound.
“Exactly! I just… I think we should take the time to relearn everything about each other, now that there aren’t any secrets between us.”
Tony typed quickly before shoving his phone in his pocket, too nervous to wait for a reply. As everyone settled in, talked about their holiday plans and ate, Tony became more and more aware of the weight of the phone in his pocket. More importantly, he became more and more aware of the lack of vibration telling him he had a message. Minute after gut wrenching minute went by, and Tony could tell that his friends were trying to keep things moving, but they were all focused on him. At one point Carol finally brought up the very large elephant in the room.
“Well, the Fall Formal dance is coming up in a couple of weeks and we need more chaperones,” Natasha said, taking the seat across from him.
“Oh, no my entire company has been a front to charm my way into this apartment so I could sell all your secrets to the sleaziest tabloids.”
“I don’t really know,” Tony answered truthfully, clearly irked by that fact. “From the interaction that we had with that bot during the last meet, it’s clear that it’s a very intricate AI, but it feels like it’s just here for someone to notice the programming more than for it to be used to cheat.”
“Do you want me to cry?!” Tony complained, “Because I swear I will have a breakdown right now if your dick is not inside me within the next thirty seconds.”
Steve almost cries as he slips the ring onto Tony’s finger, but Tony’s there holding his hand, and they finally kiss, their first kiss of the afterlife. Steve has waited to be home for the past thirty-five years, and he’s finally home.
Tony could feel the pressure building in his loins as he continued thrusting into Steve’s mouth. “Alpha…I’m close…”
“I have an idea…” Tony leaned back with a smirk, and Steve found he couldn’t move his hands from where they were pinned against the headboard.
Tony pushed down hard, burying the alpha’s entire length inside him, and felt his knot swell up, pressing against his insides. The pleasure-pain was too much to handle, and it tipped him over the edge as well, and he came with a shout of his alpha’s name, shooting ropes of come all over his well-sculpted chest and abs.
It wasn’t. Helen Cho saved the day, or rather, the man who saved the Universe. Her Cradle was successfully able to save his life, though at the cost of his right arm, but Bruce and Shuri were working on a bionic arm for him, in his signature red-and-gold color scheme.
Steve couldn’t help the gasp that left his mouth as Tony stroked his dick, “Y…yeah, I love it.” he answered.
Steve growled when he heard Tony’s voice, and flipped them around so he lay against the pillows, with the omega in his lap. Then he turned Tony and pulled him in so his back was pressed against his chest. Tony groaned as he felt large hands massage his pecs, teasing his nipples and earning moans in return. “Such a pretty omega. My omega.” Steve whispered sultrily as he nipped at Tony’s earlobe. His mating spot was just a little further down his neck, and Steve could smell the sweet scent of chocolates, and vanilla, and roses, and it was just mesmerizing.
As much as Steve might have been eager to fuck Tony, he could not just go by without tasting his omega thoroughly before he fucked him. The fact that Tony loved it when Steve rimmed him was an added bonus. Steve licked every bit of slick that dribbled out while stretching him out thoroughly with his thumbs.
Tony chuckled at that. He unzipped the pants of Steve’s suit, “Get rid of those.” he spoke in a very sultry voice, something that sent a jolt of arousal down Steve’s spine, and they both saw the alpha’s cock twitch in response. Steve’s hands went to the waist band, but Tony stopped him, “No hands.” he gave the alpha a cheeky smile.
“It’s going to get even better.” Steve assured, returning to his ministrations. His finger was buried to the knuckle and he only had to get it just a little crooked which had Tony keening in pleasure. The omega’s jaw hurt just a little from being stretched this far, so he resorted to stroking the massive shaft in his face and licking it, extending the same treatment to those balls dangling right there.
“Alpha…” Tony moaned, grinding his hips against Steve’s erection, leaking slick all over, “My alpha.” he brought one of the alpha’s hands to place soft kisses over the palm.
Beneath him Tony had the same thoughts running through his mind, their perfect wedding, and an even better life as mates.
That had been fifty years ago. The twins celebrated their fiftieth birthday today, but there was no one in the family who didn’t miss Tony just as much as they did for the past twenty years. Sarah and James had both had their own families, Morgan too, and Steve had found himself surrounded by half a dozen grandkids running and playing with their favorite grandpa.
Tony let out a breathy chuckle. “I love you…” he mumbled, still working on coming down from his orgasm.
“Come on, let me get a taste of that delicious slick you’ve been leaking all over me.” Steve murmured, settling Tony down on all fours on the bed, and moved behind him, hands gripping those perfectly round globes. He spanked them both a few times, making the omega whimper, before he brought his mouth to that tight rim of muscle, giving it an experimental lick, causing Tony to shiver as he tasted the rosy flavor of his omega’s slick.
Steve had spent all his time trying to help people. No one except Natasha knew it had all been something to keep his mind off Tony. She’d kept him posted about Tony’s life, the birth of his baby girl. Steve looked at how happy the three of them were in that short clip Rhodes had sent her, and his heart broke all over again. He wanted to feel happy for Tony finding some semblance of normalcy after the hell he’d been put through, but some selfish part of him wished he was in Pepper’s place.
Steve had the omega sit up in his lap before kissing him hungrily. He pulled Tony flush against his body, hands wrapped snugly around him. The omega couldn’t stop grinding his slick holes against the alpha’s thick shaft, needing it inside him right away. Tony knew that wasn’t going to happen anytime soon, but well, a guy could dream. Steve was going to have his way with him, and he was going to take his own sweet time, and Tony couldn’t describe how excited he was about everything.
“Yeah, yeah…” Tony muttered before pulling him into a kiss, this one a little softer, just a little less hurried.
“You are such a good alpha.” Tony murmured, “So good for me.” Steve let out a low rumble, from deep within his chest, and Tony couldn’t help chuckle at that, “Sleep now, I love you.”
Sometime later, once Steve was satisfied Tony was loosened up sufficiently, he picked up the omega and adjusted him so that his face was buried into the mattress and ass raised in the air. He landed a few slaps, making Tony cry out in pleasure-pain, before settling down to eat him out.
“I’ll give you all you want, Sweetheart. You don’t even gotta ask.” Steve murmured, pushing his dick between Tony’s legs. He could feel his omega’s slick dribbling onto it as he slid forward.
Tony’s hands dropped down to unbutton Steve’s mint-green shirt, but the Super Soldier didn’t have the patience for him to undo them all, so he just ripped it off in one smooth motion, revealing the pure bulk of muscle, everything he had worked on in DC had definitely been fruitful.
Steve had remembered Peggy asking him the same question decades ago, and wasn’t that ironic? Peggy had been battling Alzheimer’s back then, and now, Tony was about to leave him, and yet, Steve was right here, unable to go anywhere. It took every ounce of courage for Steve to not have a breakdown right there.
“But of course, Captain America is going to wait for the right moment to strike.” Steve grinned teasingly.
Another slap, on the other cheek, and another whimper from the omega, and Steve wondered if his cock could get any harder. “Something about strangling, if I heard it right…”
” he shouted as he came, knot swelling up inside his omega as he filled him up. It stunned him that even after coming countless times through the night, he still didn’t have a dry orgasm.
“That’s my omega.” Steve praised before landing another hit, making Tony cry out. Less than a dozen spanks later, Tony was a whimpering mess with an angry red butt leaking slick all over Steve’s cock.
“I’ll tell you when you’re up. Though I can’t say for sure the number’s gonna be right.” Steve answered with a greedy smile on his face.
When he finally reached his alpha’s huge cock, Tony took it in hand and stroked it along the whole length as he licked at the not-so-small bead of precome right on the tip. He sucked in the head, hollowing his cheeks to work it thoroughly.
Tony lost himself in the moment for a bit, and simply nuzzled Steve’s smooth cheek for a minute. The alpha had to kiss him again, a hungry one this time to remind him what they were doing. Tony got back to work, kissing his way down Steve’s chest, stroking a nipple while fingers ran along the soft, smooth hair against the rosy flush of his skin. Steve sucked in a deep breath when Tony took a nipple in his mouth and a low, drawn out moan when he rolled it between his teeth, feeling the pinch going straight to his dick. Tony trailed further down toward his washboard abs, feeling them flex with every breath, every kiss he brushed over them.
“Granpabby don’t go…” the four-year-old grandson of James says, the same doe eyes brimming with tears, and wobbly lips.
“Yes, please.” It came out as a whine this time, and Tony couldn’t help feeling pleased about getting his alpha worked up so much. “Omega, please. Let me touch you.” Steve begged.
Steve whirls around to see the love of his life standing right before him, dressed in the same tuxedo as their wedding day. He looks just as young. “There’s this guy I love. He’s my thing,” he answers, grinning from ear to ear.
Pepper shook her head, “It’s written all over your face. You’ve been this way every time I’ve met you, and it has only increased over time.”
“Where do you want to touch me, alpha?” Tony asked, with a particularly hard squeeze to Steve’s chest.
Steve began peppering open mouthed kisses along Tony’s cock, before pulling at the panties with his teeth. He pulled at them just enough to uncover Tony’s cock, already leaking a little. He licked the small bead of precome forming on the tip, taking in the delicious taste of his omega, and heard him moan from above. Steve trailed kisses along Tony’s hipbone, and sucked a bruise just along its edge before pulling down the panty strap there. He did the same for the other side. Now that the panties were down to Tony’s thigh, Steve’s job became much easier, and he pulled down the panties along the length of the omega’s legs, and crawled up to present them to his omega.
Tony sat at his desk, enjoying his coffee and a donut as he looked over a few extra credit assignments. There was a point in time when he would have easily done this in the teacher’s lounge, but with the way things were between him and Steve, it was just easier avoiding that room altogether. Tony wanted to talk to Steve again, try to get things back on track, but he didn’t want to seem as if he didn’t respect Steve’s wishes. For now, avoiding the man at all costs looked to be the best option.
In that moment, Steve felt a strong kick on the left side of his belly that was enough to make him jump.
“Look,” Tony said, clearing his throat and dusting off his pants as he stood, “I’ve got to go get ready for tonight. The guests will be arriving in half an hour.”
“In very small doses, yes,” Rhodey agreed before turning his attention to Steve. “Nice to meet you…” he paused, waiting for Steve’s official ranking, as he extended his hand for a shake.
“Peter, you’re a wonderful kid, and great save by the way,” Steve laughed. “All you have to do is be yourself, and I'm sure Mr. Rhodes will think you’re just as awesome as Mr. Stark does.”
Almost immediately after finding out the sex of their baby, Tony wanted to start planning a baby shower. Seeing him become an excited father to be really put things in perspective for Steve. He hadn’t doubted Tony’s feelings or loyalty for some time now, but seeing him like this really solidified for Steve the fact that the alpha would go to hell and back for their baby and stop at nothing to keep them both safe. Knowing that, and seeing that in Tony, more than anything, assured it in Steve’s mind that he wanted to commit to the brunet.
“Honey, me and Uncle Bucky are going to go out for a little bit, but I’ll be back soon.” Steve’s heart broke instantly as Cora buried her face in Natasha’s neck, holding on tighter in an effort to get farther away from him. Natasha just gave him a sad smile as he walked out with Bucky.
“No! No, baby, no. Nothing like that,” Tony surged forward and kissed Steve. “I’ve had sex. I’ve had a
Knowing what cold and distant Christmases Tony had been through made it easy to see why he hated even acknowledging the day. Despite this, though, Steve wanted so desperately to give Tony the Christmas he deserved. So, here he was, laying out fresh fruit, brewing freshly ground coffee, and plating the bacon, eggs and chocolate chip pancakes in preparation for what he hoped would be a wonderful day.
“Grab onto that,” Steve said. Tony looked up and saw a railing he assumed was some sort of reinforcement for the tanks, and grabbed onto it. Just as Steve was about to push inside of Tony, Tony barked out a laugh.
“You need one of them, to help you figure out if that’s anything you’d be interested in. If you try it out and you don’t like it or the idea of being intimate with Tony isn’t appealing then he’s probably not the person for you, which is perfectly fine. It’s just...there’s more to relationships than just swooning over someone and thinking they’re attractive. If this component of a relationship with Tony doesn’t suit you then you’ll know there’s no need to further pursue your feelings.”
Just as Steve finished setting the table, Tony groggily shuffled into the kitchen. “Morning, sweetheart,” Steve greeted, smiling as his boyfriend plopped down into his chair with a thud.
“The plans he was making, I get that they seemed a little overwhelming and all but you have to understand where he’s coming from. The things that he was planning with you, the apartment, daycare, moving around your school schedules… he was trying to do things for you, both of you, that his father never did for his family. He wants to be the best he can for you and Coraline, but he doesn’t really know how to do that without using his money.”
Steve thought he knew quite a bit about Tony from what he’d seen on the news or in magazines, but the biggest surprise was just how wildly off base every video or picture of him had ever been. Tony was breathtakingly gorgeous in person, so much so that Steve hadn’t even recognized it was actually him initially. Tony was also nearly as tall as Steve. He had the most beautifully mussed up chocolate brown hair. His eyes were the purest shade of blue that Steve had ever seen. To say he was infatuated with Tony would be...a grave understatement.
Tony just smiled as he lifted his coffee cup to take a sip. “You guys seem to have a lot of hunches lately. You better hope they’re right.”
“Right? What kind of psycho ruins perfectly good espresso with 5 shots of vanilla, 5 shots of hazelnut and a shit ton of white chocolate syrup?!”
Steve spent the rest of that day trying hard to let go of all of the hopes he’d had for them. He remembered being so excited every day he went to work, wondering what ridiculous things he and Tony would talk about or get up to after work. He loved his time with the robotics team, watching the kids learn how to think more strategically, but he loved getting to see Tony pour so much of his knowledge into their team even more. Steve had wanted nothing more than just to watch Tony do any of the things that made him happy, because that’s when his beauty truly shined through. But now, those memories just made Steve’s heart ache in a way he hadn’t felt since being discharged from the military. So many hopes and dreams ahead of him that had been within his reach but ultimately ripped away.
“Tony, I literally explained why I was here not even a full five minutes ago,” Pepper answered, already exasperated, “I’m here to make sure you actually look through those applications but I’m also here because I want to hear all about Mr. Hot Gym Teacher.”
“Don’t you have a date with the Statue of Liberty or something else ridiculously patriotic to go do?”
“They always do though, don’t they?” Steve asked, cynically. “With Sharon, Batroc, Rachel, Bernie, Betty, and Peggy, shit hit the fan with
“Nice to meet you, Rogers, is it?” the man asked, opening a folder that looked to contain Steve’s information. “My name is Nicholas Fury, but you can just call me Principal or Fury; either will do. So, our Russian teacher Natasha highly recommended you for this position, despite your lack of experience,” Fury stated.
Tony crossed his arms over his chest, eyebrow cocked and grin sitting on his face. He’d finally done it, he’d finally managed to get one over on his piece of shit father. Howard had no choice but to give into what he wanted, and it was an amazing feeling.
“Good, cause we couldn't bear it if our little Stevie got hurt now could we?” Bucky asked, ruffling Steve’s hair.
Steve had had a great time at work for his first few shifts. Though the lack of customers made things a little dull, he loved spending time with Clint, Sam and Natasha. In an unexpected surprise, he stumbled upon a customer who seemed to be having a rough night. Steve simply wanted to lighten the man’s spirits, but ended up thoroughly enjoying his company.
“I…” Steve started, only stopping for the shudder that ran through him, “I thought if I...bit into my arm, it’d keep me quiet...so the neighbors wouldn’t hear me…”
“What are you doing here?” Steve asked, genuinely surprised someone like Tony would spend his Saturday at a museum. The taller man sighed before giving a sad smile.
For some reason, Steve’s words ripped a hearty laugh out of Tony. He could tell at this point that the blond wasn’t so much interested in actually finding out what had Tony feeling down, so much as he was just trying to make the man feel better, and he genuinely appreciated it. For the first time in days, Tony didn’t have to pretend to be anything other than himself. Even as a wallowing mess, this guy still seemed to sincerely want to talk to Tony, and something about that felt comforting.
life, and after as well,” Steve promised, taking Tony’s hand and placing the softest of kisses on each knuckle.
“No I don’t. Is that all you got there, Soldier? I swear my grandma could give a better spanking, though I’ve never met her, but you know…HOLY MOTHERF…of God!” Tony cried out as Steve landed a hard hit on his ass.
“Avenging.” Steve confirmed, “You see, my lovely omega, I enjoyed last night, but you…” he stroked Tony’s cheek, voice taking a low, sultry note, “are evil, for the delicious torture you put me through. Don’t you think it’d be a shame if I, Captain America, the first Avenger, leader of the Avengers, let you just get away with it?”
“Yes!” Tony nearly screeched, “Fuck me alpha, please!” he begged, pushing his butt back against Steve’s cock that had him biting down a groan.
“You are evil!” Steve snorted out a laugh, “See, this is how supervillains are born, out of torturing innocent superheroes.”
Tony let Steve do the work, with the alpha bobbing his head back and forth, bringing the omega on the verge of completion. Steve could feel the omega shuddering above him, and knew he was just there, waiting to be tipped over the cliff into an orgasmic freefall. The alpha hollowed his cheeks eagerly, sucking the omega’s cock in, and thrust his tongue out, and into Tony’s slit, as far as it would go.
Steve pulled away only for a moment to answer, “Come in my mouth, Sweetheart. Let me taste your sweetness.” he begged eagerly as he swallowed Tony’s length in one go.
“It’s nothing. I just don’t want to intrude on your family time,” Steve’s answer had been awkward at best.
Steve’s hand snuck into Tony’s shirt, feeling every muscle in the omega’s back. It wasn’t easy though; the shirt he wore didn’t allow his hands to move as freely as he would have liked. “Do you like this shirt?” Steve asked.
Tony had passed in his sleep later that night, and Steve had woken up to his cold, unmoving form. He hadn’t cried. He had promised Tony long ago he wouldn’t do that. What he did was to place one final kiss on his husband’s forehead, with a promise to meet him again, whenever that might be.
The kiss was hot, passionate, demanding, and Tony felt a very deep need to give into it, let himself be dominated, manhandled,
The newly engaged couple ended up having sex well into the next day…more like late afternoon. They had sex in every position conceivable, and a few new ones too. Steve fucked Tony pressed against the wall with the omega’s dick suffering the friction between two sets of muscled stomachs; they fucked against the floor to ceiling windows, looking out into the New York skyline, once at night, and then again during the day; Steve pounded Tony into the small couch off to the side; they had sexing front of the bathroom mirror; they had sex with Steve standing right in the middle of the room, bouncing Tony on his cock; Tony even rode the alpha more than a few times.
“Maybe you’ll love this too then.” Tony cupped Steve’s tented crotch, stroking it languidly, making sure to tickle his balls too.
The way Tony’s pupils blew wide was enough of an answer for Steve. “I guess I could use a small stay-at-home vacation.” Tony mused.
Steve hadn’t seen Tony during those five years. Tony had sent out an invite to him, but he hadn’t been brave enough to attend the wedding. Natasha had found him later that night, sobbing quietly in a corner of his room at the Avengers Facility.
Tony rode his alpha for a long, long time, both of them moaning and groaning as Steve hit all the right spots, making the omega clench around him. They were both soaked in sweat in spite of the cold weather outside, and the room smelled very strongly of sex, and both their scents mixed together.
“You should be happy that I am pleasantly surprised.” Tony countered, his hands coming to rest against those harder-than-ever pecs.
Steve picked him up and held him flush against his chest, craning his neck to kiss him deep and hungry. It had been a long time since Tony had the shaggy feel of his alpha’s strong chest against his back, and it was awesome. Tony’s hand drew up to settle in those blonde locks, tugging them just a little to make the alpha keep kissing him. Steve’s hands were busy feeling up Tony’s abs and chest, and teasing his nipples every now and then.
“Not a word, alpha. Not a single word.” Tony grinned up at Steve mischievously, earning him a yearning growl in return. He stood up, flexing his lean muscles, and strode over to the alpha, swinging his butt in a way that had the Super Soldier struggling to keep his hands to himself. He could see the tent in Steve’s suit pants, and cupped his erection in a hand, stroking it languorously. “You like it? I’m asking about the suit.” he looked up at Steve, eyes dancing with mischief.
“Okay, maybe not that hard…” Tony chuckled, “but you promised I wouldn’t be able to walk or sir right for weeks, and I really, really like how that sounds.” He placed a quick peck on the alpha’s lips.
Steve wasn’t any better. One might think his hips were moving on autopilot. Tony’s words were all that he needed to let go. “
“We got all night, Sweetheart.” Steve assured, even as he increased the speed of his thrusts. “I’m gonna fuck you so hard, you ain’t gonna be able to move a muscle.” he added in a rumble.
“I have a condition though.” Tony murmured, and moved to straddle the alpha, “You gotta get me out of these panties.”
“Sir yes sir.” Steve raised his hands up in surrender as he backed away to the bathroom to get into his brand new stealth suit. He stepped out, wearing his stealth suit, but was not prepared to be met with the sight of his omega sprawled out on the bed, wearing nothing but a pair of bright red, lacy panties that left nothing for imagination, and of course, Steve’s dog-tags, which looked beautiful against the rosy skin of his chest. He felt something vibrate in his chest, and it took him a moment to realize the deep rumble had come from him.
“But first, rings.” Tony points at Steve’s chest, where the wedding rings hang, the same ones made of metal from Steve’s shield and Tony’s Iron Man armor.
Tony’s hands came up to grab at Steve’s hair, but the alpha caught them, and pinned them over his head with just one hand. The omega whined once again at being denied contact. Steve kissed Tony’s lips to silence him, and the omega sighed into the kiss. “I love you…” Steve murmured with a smile.
Steve’s knot took the last of his stamina, and he was left gasping for breath as he carefully adjusted his omega so he was comfortable. A few minutes later, when he could breathe easily, the first thing Steve noticed was how peaceful Tony looked. He had been seeing this look for over two years now, but it would never cease to amaze him. His hand ran in circles along his omega’s belly, and his mind went to the future, when Tony would actually be pregnant with his pups. He imagined holding his baby in his arms; it would be a tiny little thing, yet the sweetest, most beautiful baby in the world. The alpha eventually fell asleep, hugging his omega, imagining their happy future together with their litter of kids running around.
This time, Steve was relentless with the spanking, and continued until Tony’s ass was beet red, and swollen, and sore. He even landed a few slaps right over his hole, which made the omega cry out around his dick, the vibrations sending excited shivers up and down his spine. He didn’t even realize it until he saw it with his eyes, but his dick was almost completely buried inside Tony’s mouth, something he thought would never be physically possible. Also, now that he was seeing it, he felt Tony’s teeth pressing down against his thick shaft, not enough to hurt, but it just felt so hot.
“Hear me out Steve, please.” Tony’s tone is pleading, almost begging. “I didn’t have the full picture yet. I
“I came here to apologize, you know,” Steve blurts out. “I’d wanted to for weeks, but it had to take the DOJ completely excluding my office from the Pierce case to realize why I was wrong.”
“Were you ever going to tell me anything, or was that bit about the “big picture” just a ruse to keep me interested?” Steve asks, clearly irked at the circles he and Tony keep running in.
The President sighs, and it’s a sigh that sounds a lot like acceptance. Of what precisely, Tony doesn’t know. “Talking to you without his consent. It’s not a very presidential thing to do, keeping your staff in the dark about important matters, but desperate times call for desperate measures.”
“To put it mildly.” He disregards her taunting and sits down and rests his chin on his hands, eyes penetrating Hill’s arrogant demeanor. “You’ve crossed a very dangerous line, Maria. The President is not at all happy with you.”
“I really thought things were escalating—shut up,” he says as Tony’s lips quiver into a smirk. “And it was, I guess, but only in the bedroom. There I did your joke for you. The truth is, I really like Natasha and I want us to be together. I want to take her out on dinner, not because it’s a prelude to sex, but because I know she likes their dessert or something. I want lazy weekends, spent in bed, doing nothing except maybe use the bathroom.” Clint rests his head against the cool top.
Thor took a glance at his father and there it was, that tick in Odin’s jaw. It meant that his father was very close to saying words he would regret later, and Thor knew that in order to keep this confrontation from becoming a PR nightmare for the company, he would have to take the bullet.
“I guess you’ll have to find out when Congress comes back in session,” he tells her, and bows before he takes his leave.
now and not we, the lovely underscoredom and dancetildawnmon have bowed out from writing due to hectic schedules (work for Dom, med school for Mon). So, if anyone is interested,
“For now. Give me a couple of years, maybe. Having a full time job doesn’t give me enough time for my hobbies,” Tony jokes.
Tony doesn’t know how to respond to that. “You’re welcome, Steve,” is all he can come up with. “But none of this would have happened if it weren’t for you.”
The intercom beside the door cackles. "Stop brooding on my doorstep, Barton, there's a bottle of scotch here with your name on it. I'm not making promises that it'll give you the answers you're looking for but those bushes won't either, might as well go for the fun option.”
“Tony, is everything alright?” Steve asks with concern as he watches Tony put on his pants and undershirt.
Bruce takes a moment to reflect on it. “I’d say trust your gut, but also remember that Stark doesn’t like it when he’s backed up in a corner. As with the rest of his team. So try not to push him too hard, sir, or we may end up alienating both the Speaker and the most influential people in the Democratic Party.”
“But what does this have to do with Loki? Aside from wanting Pierce’s seat, of course,” Janet asks the room.
“Kitchen is this way,” is all he says to Tony in reply. That still stung him, no matter what motivations Tony might have had with those words.
He kisses Tony and it feels like a tsunami of emotions flooding inside him. Tony’s body is warm against him, and his lips are pliant and responsive. God, he’s wanted this so badly. It’s not just about the arousal of kissing someone, but that moment that you’ve finally found an equal in another person and just want to be with that person. For the past few months, Tony has challenged him in so many ways, and today, seeing him love someone else’s daughter as fiercely as if she was his own, has challenged him to become a man that deserves to be a part of that.
Needless to say, the rest of the morning is happy for both Kate and Darcy despite the stress that’s waiting for them at the Hill. In this business, they take what they can get, even if what they get are just fleeting moments of glee.
Fury contemplates, eyes not leaving Natasha’s. She’s right—Stark has always been a force to be reckoned with because he has always been smart and cunning about his moves. But the President, as much as Fury respects and admires him, has yet to be tested by difficult political choices. This crisis would be his debut into the most real, and very gritty world of politics, so maybe it’s time to leave the big calls to the veterans. “Can
Natasha rolls her eyes, but her expression is tender with affection. “What’s your excuse this time?”
Steve rubs his eyes. “You should go home, get some rest. I’ll be going back to the residence in a few minutes.”
“Maybe you should have thought of that before you let Rogers use up his only Fury card so early in the game.”
“Yes, everything’s fine!” Steve responds quickly. “I just—god, there's no easy way to say this.” He rubs his temples and braces himself for what he's about to say next. “I'm seeing someone.”
department. If there’s one thing I’m sure about, dear, is that you don’t give a damn about what someone thinks of you unless that person is someone you really care about.”
Kate rubs her eyes, stretches and heads to the kitchen, her cellphone in hand to text her aforementioned boss.
Tony must be sensing Steve’s apprehension because he addresses it head on. “I only use this bar when I’m entertaining. I haven’t had a drink in thirteen years.”
“It’s not an anomaly, but it is unusual. I assume you’ve gone to specialists and had all the tests done with everything coming out normal?”
“You sure you won’t get into trouble for this, Hoover?” Tony asks her with mirth, but concern still clear on his face.
So he chooses to do what he normally does when he’s stuck between a rock and a hard place—he bargains with the cosmos (he is an atheist after all). A few days after the first call, he decides to tell Kate. Naturally, his straightforward and fearless assistant is not amused.
Not that she’s complaining about her present life or anything. She and Thor have a wonderful marriage, clouded only by the fact that they can’t seem to get pregnant. Both of them have done all the tests and doctors could find nothing wrong with either of them, but it’s been almost ten years. That kind of frustration can get to a person. They’re trying not to let it get to them.
Naturally, they argued on their first meeting. Odin had dragged Thor to Culver University with him, and he sat front row to watch his dad give a talk on business ethics. He was bored out of his mind—he had heard all of this from his father before—until a female voice from the center of the auditorium interrupted the discussion on corporate social responsibility.
Tony smiles to himself. “Likewise, Miss Romanoff.” And they both hang up. “Pep!” he greets the tall redhead. “Congratulations on the reelect.”
After she the door of the bar closes behind her, Foggy tells Matt, “I wonder how she’s going to make our lives a living hell for the next year.”
“And to be frank, sir,” Bruce continues. “And don’t take this the wrong way, I mean absolutely no offense whatsoever—but you have no business being in their world. You don’t know them, and you’re not a part of their family, even with your close relationship with Stark.”
Kate groans in frustration, ignoring her boss’ teasing. “Tony, come on. Be serious for once. It’s important that you listen to me.”
“I do, but Tony does what he wants. He’s always been like that. He wouldn’t be the Speaker of the House if he weren’t like that.”
Thor was not only amused—he was also intrigued. A regular person (and a woman at that) challenging his father, the self-made real estate mogul, to answer for his crimes in front of all these people? He sat back, smirked, and thought,
haunted him throughout the night, and it kept him from closing his eyes for more than five minutes. He couldn’t sleep at all. He set up an easel and canvas in the private sitting room, right in front of the windows overlooking the South Lawn, and painted all night.
“Are you sure about that?” Wade asks her. “You know that woman hates you as much as she hates Tony.”
Steve takes a deep breath, steadying himself. It’s been a tough day, and he was barely at the end of it.
“Well, it’s her fucking loss, Barton. You’re a catch and she knows it. Meanwhile, you have to suck it up and come back to us. No matter how much of an amazing woman she is, she’s not worth being like this.
“The Defendant is charged with three counts of bribery, as he targeted members of law enforcement and the federal bench to ensure the release of the smuggled controlled substances from evidence hold.
“I work for Tony Stark. Trust me, I know,” Kate says with a chuckle. “But he’s holding up alright? Tony hasn’t been grousing about his work ethic so I assume he’s still on top of his game. Clint never shows anything less than his best during meetings and war councils, as far as I’ve noticed.”
to help the homeless shelter get back on its feet. And this isn’t the first time your company has done this. May I remind you about the halfway house in Atlanta, or the LGBT help center in Miami? You sit there and talk about social responsibility—well, social responsibility isn’t about doing what’s legal, Messrs. Odinson, it’s about doing what’s right.”
And that’s when it all clicks for her. “What makes you think that a delegation with businessmen would even get past the Dora Milaje?”
Sharon laughs, clearly amused at Steve’s reaction. “Look at you, you’re so red. I’m just teasing you, Steve.”
Tony’s entrances dribbled slick relentlessly, which was now beginning to stain the sheets, and Steve didn’t want any of that sweet nectar going to waste. The alpha put his mouth to work immediately, lapping up all of it, and teasing Tony’s sensitive slit at the same time. Tony buried his face into the mattress as his hands fisted the sheets. Steve’s hand came to rest on his cock, beginning to stroke him all too slowly. His grip on the omega’s ass was strong enough that Tony couldn’t grind his hips to get the extra friction he wanted.
“Ahh…that feels so good, omega.” the alpha crooned. Steve took the liberty of taking off the suit, but Tony stopped him, and did it himself, running his hands hungrily over the hard muscles of his back and arms as he removed it.
“Oh, I am going to fuck you alright.” Steve replied, voice laced with want, “I’m gonna show you a good time like you’ve never had before.”
A while later, Steve added the third finger, and began to work Tony’s hole in earnest, getting it ready to take his girth. He remembered vividly how uncomfortable Tony had been the last time when he hadn’t bothered to prepare himself, and Steve was having none of that this time around. Tony writhed under his ministrations, letting out tantalizing moans every time his fingers managed to hit his prostate.
Tony did manage to pass out, more than a few times actually, and he stopped counting his orgasms after he had a dozen of them. He wasn’t sure the last of Steve’s remaining brain cells could count either, not when his own last brain cell was working overtime keeping him awake. His cock was sore, his ass was sore from being spanked all night long, his hole was going to be sore for at least two weeks, but he still couldn’t be happier about it, because this might be the most erotic night in his life. Who would’ve thought Captain America would show him such a good time? Tony Stark did, that’s who.
Tony let out another whine at his alpha’s voice, shivers going down his spine as he tried to bury himself further into Steve’s warmth. He pulled at Steve’s hands so he could bring them up to place kisses on them, whenever he wasn’t moaning at the sensation of being filled.
Tony’s voice did things to Steve. Even normally, his voice was sweet enough to make his alpha mind swoon over him, but this kind of talk was just heavenly. The alpha let out a rumble, cock twitching against the omega’s ass.
Tony continued grinding on Steve’s cock, encouraging the alpha to thrust up into him. It was a great feeling, feeling the alpha’s slicked skin slapping against his own. There was a lot of slick and sweat, and it made their scents even stronger, intense. One hard thrust from the alpha, angled just right, and Tony was keening in pleasure.
“You don’t have to explain yourself, Steve, and you definitely don’t have to feel guilty about it,” Pepper spoke, and all but dragged him inside the recovery room to sit and talk. They had enough time with Morgan at school.
“Shh…” Steve soothed, massaging Tony’s glutes, “Be patient omega. I’ll give you everything you want.” He massaged the globes, hands circling around, before he slapped a hand on one. Tony’s slick slathered all over made it even noisier than Steve expected, and his omega’s moan was most certainly rewarding. He slapped the other globe, and Tony moaned once again.
“Our happily ever afterlife. I picked out the wedding day in the hopes you might like it. It is the happiest day of my life.”
Steve leaned in to murmur in Tony’s ear, “Good, because you ain’t gonna be able to much after I’m done with you…” The omega shivered from the sultry roughness in his voice, and then let out a squeak as the alpha nibbled at his earlobe.
“You got it.” Steve rumbled, and adjusted Tony so that the omega’s ass was right in his lap, “You ready?”
Once he got to Tony’s nipples, Steve wrapped his arms around Tony tight, as if he was never going to let go of his omega, and put the perky peaks through a series of bites and kisses that were sure to leave them both bruised and sore for a long time. The alpha was determined to leave his omega exhausted and his voice raw by the time they were done. Tony writhed under his ministrations, moaning incessantly as he held on to his alpha like his life depended on it. By the time Steve was done, Tony’s nipples were so bruised and so sensitive that just a simple lick was enough to make him gasp.
“Oh, I’m gonna show you pleasantly surprised.” Steve nodded with a grin, before he lifted Tony off his feet and into his arms, before crushing their mouths together in a heated kiss. He carried Tony to the bed, and dropped him on it.
“N…no. I was j…ah!” Tony squeaked when another smack landed on his ass. He was definitely going to be sore for quite a while once Steve was done with him.
Tony buried his face in his alpha’s chest, taking in the musky, apple pie scent that was Steve. He placed wet, open-mouthed kisses wherever he could. He snuck a hand beneath the star to stroke the still hidden nipple while sucking on the one right before him. It was a toothy nip, making the alpha moan, placing his hands on the omega’s hips because he could no longer handle not touching him. Tony pulled away when he was satisfied the nipple was now a purple bruise, and he gave it one last stroke with his tongue, and Steve hissed above him as his grip on Tony’s hips tightened, sure to leave bruises later.
“Knot me, alpha.” Tony let out a whimper, sensing that Steve was close. His own dick had been grinding against the alpha’s rock-hard abs, and he was about to come himself. He continued bouncing on the massive cock, with the slick allowing him free movement.
As much as Tony wanted to stay that way for a little longer, Steve was way too big for his mouth and it was getting hard to breathe, though it was very much worth it. He pulled off with a gasp for air even as the shaft was tightly in his grip. “That…was awesome!” he panted.
“Yeah…ah!” Steve yelped when Tony pinched his nipples again. He felt uncertain as to how he was going to take those panties off.
Tony let out a pleased whine at the thought of Steve looking after him more than he already did, which of course turned high-pitched as another slap landed on his ass. Steve kissed him once again, biting down on the omega’s lower lip just short of breaking the delicate skin there.
“Once I got there and realized what was going on, Steve essentially asked me for help, so I helped. One thing led to another and well...Steve found out the other day that he’s pregnant.”
“Tony, babe, I am so sorry, but I can’t help you. You’re a smart guy, you’ll figure it out, I’m sure. But I’ve got to get back to work, so good luck.” Tony swore he heard the sound of Pepper laughing uproariously before the line went dead.
Steve was trying hard to make this invitation as casual as possible, but Tony could see the slight look of desperation in his eyes.
“Well how about you give it back now, since that's clearly where you've decided we're going…” Bruce suggested, none too pleased to be sitting in the Olive Garden parking lot. Tony just looked at him, exasperated.
As Steve drove, he thought about what exactly he’d want to say. Memories of the past few weeks flooded through his mind, yet somehow the most prominent ones all involved Tony.
Pacing back and forth across his living room. The small apartment seemed smaller as he fought to breathe. ‘Something I need to tell you’ and ‘It’s nothing good’ were both phrases that were very not okay.
“How did you get access to any of my stuff? I’ve never connected my machines to anything that JARVIS controls”
“Honestly, Stevie, all I can say is you need to talk to him. If it’s that big of a concern, you just have to be blunt and bring it up. I mean, I doubt it’s anything shady, but really he could be getting that money from anywhere. You don’t want to come to find out that he’s selling drugs or stolen goods or something. If Tony’s going to be around you and Coraline, you need to make sure everything is on the up and up.”
, both men felt content in knowing that life would be a beautiful, hot mess of an adventure, as long as they were together.
Tony couldn’t help but smile at how excited Steve seemed. He just hoped that Steve’s prediction for the night wasn’t wrong.
“Thanks again for the clothes,” Steve picked up the lone cup of coffee from the living room table and lifted it towards his lips. “Thanks for the coffee too.”
“I’ll be back by seven for the hand off with Peggy, and I’ll try to bring back something for us to eat. Thanks so much again. Love you!” Steve was already out the door before Tony could respond, but nonetheless he still uttered a ‘love you, too’ before turning to take in the entire apartment. He could do this, he knew he could. But that didn’t stop him from saying a silent prayer before going to check up on Cora. This was going to be one long afternoon.
"Oh please, Steve, give it a rest. I know I'm a pain in your ass. To tell you the truth, I was wondering when you were gunna give up on the whole "kill him with kindness" shtick cause you're a lot more fun when you're sassy. Anyway, the whole team is dressing up as the kids from Captain Planet and they all want you to be the Captain. So, what do ya say?"
He knew exactly what his friends were doing, and he was already over it. Whenever there was even a hint of someone new in Steve’s life, his friends would all but shake him down for information on them, then scrutinize everything about them with a fine toothed comb. He wasn’t ready to deal with that with Tony, especially when there wasn’t really a relationship for them to scrutinize in the first place.
Tony couldn’t help the ear to ear grin that spread on his face at that. “Well,” he spoke, taking Steve’s hand in his own, “who could say no to an invitation like that?”
“Hey,” Steve offered, sliding into the passenger’s side. “So, where are we going for our first date?”
Tony woke up, hazy and aching. It took some amount of time for him to get his bearings, but once he did, he quickly covered his head with his sheets, in an effort to ward off the day. He had been going on three weeks now. Three weeks of wallowing in his own self pity, in his large house, alone.
“Babe, if you don’t stop I will turn this car around and drive us home.” Tony said through clenched teeth. He was trying his best to stay patient but Steve had been asking about their whereabouts constantly for the better part of two hours.
The Brooklyn Bridge Park had always been one of Steve’s favorite places. His mom used to bring him here when he was a kid, with the carousel being a special treat when they could afford it. Steve found himself visiting the park with previous significant others but it never really felt right, so he just left it as a place to visit on his own, to people watch and draw. Steve wasn’t really sure what the goal was for bringing Tony here, but he hoped that the brunet would at least enjoy this place that meant a great deal to him.
“‘S my burfday!” Cora exclaimed to every single person they passed when walking into the restaurant.
It had been a full month since Steve had taken the job at the Olive Garden. He struggled a bit in the beginning, but quickly made friends with a few other waiters who were more than willing to help him out.
“There’s a suspiciously large amount of Vermont license plates here for us to not be in Vermont…” Tony saw the smug look on Steve’s face and decided there was only one way to wipe it off his face. He took a running start before tackling Steve into the snow bank at the edge of the parking lot.
“Oh, I’m going to an engagement party on Saturday night,” Steve said, taking a sip of his strawberry shake.
“I...uh…” the man began, stammering. He cleared his throat and began again, “you need to get out of bed today.”
The alpha was set to return home in a couple of days, and while on his trip, he would text to check in as much as his busy schedule would allow, but Steve missed him immensely. There were times when Steve would think about Tony, and Bug would kick him, seemingly as hard as he could, and for a while, the omega thought his daughter was trying to let him know that she missed her dad just as much. Thought it seemed like she was trying to kick a hole in his stomach to escape out into the world, Steve really did cherish those moments, and promised to share the story with Tony the second he got home.
“I...what?” Steve asked, now looking shocked. “I don't know who Tiberius Stone is and I certainly haven't been paid to give anyone any information about you. Tony, what's going on?”
“There was a scheduling mix up at the library so I have to go into work. Peggy’s working at the hospital until seven tonight, so she can’t get Cora early. Is there any way you can come watch her for me?”
“Well hello there, only child of mine who, for some reason, refuses to ever speak to me. Nice to see you again.”
“Listen, Stevie, it doesn’t matter who you like or date or whatever, as long as they’re a good person. As long as they treat you with the kindness, love and respect that you deserve, then it doesn’t matter.”
“Honestly, I don’t know, and that’s what’s got me worried. He says he used the money he got for Christmas for the paint set, but what about the bed and breakfast? And who could he possibly know that would be capable of shutting down the entire aquarium to everyone but us? I mean for God’s sake, we had
,” Steve uttered at the feel of the tongue on him. Tony let out a chuckle as he continued to lap at the furled skin, teasing. Steve wanted to let Tony set the pace, since the focus of the day was his happiness. As Tony worked, though, moving his tongue in slow, long strips, Steve felt himself losing it. He was seconds away from begging when he felt the tip of Tony’s tongue delve into his hole.
“Well, Empire Fulton Ferry is always a great time. We could grab something small to eat at Empire Stores or walk around the garden at the St. Ann's Warehouse,” Steve offered, hoping to gauge a reaction from the brunet that might indicate what he’d prefer. “Or we could just head over there and play it by ear.”
Tears were streaming down Pepper’s face in earnest now. When Tony didn’t respond, she stood up to leave. As she made her way to the door, she turned to take one last look at him.
on a particularly good thrust. He locked eyes with the man beneath him, and smiled. “Mark me, make me yours. Knot me,
With that, Pepper and Rhodey erupted into laughter, leaving the subject of Steve behind. Tony didn’t know what it was but the thought of his friends not approving of Steve terrified him. He didn’t understand his feelings on the matter, but that was just something he’d have to sort out later.
“I’m sure whatever it is that’s happened between the two of you, you can fix things. You do want to fix things, don’t you?”
“Please, come on in, don’t even wait for me to invite you!” Tony answered, throwing the towel over his shoulder, to take Carol’s coat and hang it up for her.
As he continued to sift through his clothes, looking for the perfect top, Sam grabbed him by the shoulders and turned him, looking Steve right in the eyes.
“Yeah… it really seemed like Steve wanted to go a lot farther than just kissing, but I figured it’d be better if we waited.”
“Well, judging by the lack of a bond mark on your neck, and your current scent, you’re as good as single to me.”
Initially, Steve had no idea what to get Tony for his birthday, but after seeing his reaction to his Valentine’s Day gift, he knew he wanted to paint something. Steve tried to be as secretive as possible, while he slowly collected all the items that he needed throughout the week. When Sunday rolled around, he set up his easel and canvas in the living room and got to work.
“So it has nothing to do with the fact that Pepper hasn’t been seen or heard from since the day Tony locked himself in his workshop?”
“Hey,” Tony cried as Bruce barked out a laugh. “I regret ever thinking either of you were on my list of favorite people,” Tony said, crossing his arms in a huff.
“It’s a beautiful night, isn’t it,” Tony said, taking a few steps closer. Steve stood there, silently as the brunet came to overlook the party beside him.
that he’d played on their way to New Haven. Right as the song ended, Steve made his way into the room and was greeted by Tony’s bright smile. At this point Steve realized, asking Tony on a date wouldn't be so hard, but having to wait to ask Tony just might kill him.
Tony hummed as he nodded, taking a bite of his bacon. They sat in companionable silence from then on, enjoying their breakfast together. Once done, Steve stood to clear the table. As he moved to place the dishes in the sink, he felt hands circling his waist, going under the apron to caress his hips.
“Well, the way I see it, you decided a long time ago that you deserved everything bad that ever came your way. I can’t imagine why, but it’s because of this that you don’t fight for the things you want.”
“So…back to the IPod. You may be thinking ‘Oh Tony, don’t you have some kind of Stark Industries portable music playing device?’…”
“I mean, you just did with that weak deflecting technique,” Peter quipped. “Mr. Stark is my favorite teacher, with you as a very close second, obviously. But since I care what he thinks I also care what his best friend thinks, so I’m nervous about Mr. Rhodes liking me.”
Steve knew that Natasha wasn’t going to take no for an answer. He also knew, though, that she was aware of how stubborn he could be. Thanks to his small stature, Steve always felt it necessary to turn down any kind of handouts from friends. He was in a bit of a pickle, sure, but that didn’t mean he was going to walk around accepting jobs from his friends, offered out of pity.
He wandered through the kitchen, trying to figure out where everything was and what he could bring to Steve while they waited for another wave to hit. Tony had no clue what he was doing here or what this meant for the two of them, but only one thought ran through his mind for the rest of the evening.
It felt like Steve had already done just that, but he wondered if there was a way around all of this. How could he figure out if Tony had any interest in him? Everything he thought up seemed convoluted and slightly childish, which left him feeling defeated. The thought of just asking the man out crossed Steve’s mind, but he quickly dismissed that idea. When had being direct ever worked anyway? No, he decided, he would just have to come up with a plan to gauge Tony’s feelings, and if he had to enlist the help of Natasha and their friends at work, so be it. But for now, he’d just try to relax and enjoy the day for what it was.
Steve tried his best to put his new found feelings for tony aside as the week came to a start. He genuinely wasn’t sure what he was going to do or how he was going to handle his friendship from here on out, but true to Tony Stark fashion, the brunet couldn’t stay silent for long. Steve received a text around Tuesday evening asking if he and his friends wanted to have a get together with Tony and his friends that weekend. The blond ignored the butterflies in the pit of his stomach as he replied that they’d be there.
“Correction,” Tony began, with his pointer finger up, “the first time we met, I thought you were dead in your car. But we did formally meet at a happy hour. I always attend them because I like the company.”
“Yeah, you mean the biggest government contracting manufacturer in the country? What about them?” Steve asked, making sure to give Tony his absolute full attention.
That brought the smaller man to a screeching halt. He couldn't turn to look at his friend, just put his head in his hand for a moment.
“Don’t think too hard or you two might hurt yourselves,” she joked, taking a swig of the beer before handing it to Bucky. “What are you two thinking up out here, anyway?”
“Don’t be. I’ve already told you I’m fine and it’s okay. Despite that huge hurdle at the beginning there, I had a really great time. Natasha and Sam are absolutely amazing, and Bucky isn’t one hundred percent awful,” Tony offered, nuzzling his head into Steve’s chest before the blond barked out a laugh at his words.
Tony started throwing back drink after drink, and as the liquid burned its way down his throat, crazy ideas started forming.
“Deal with it! Bad things happen to really good people sometimes, but you can’t just shut down and give up. Where do you think I would be with that attitude? I lost everything and everyone but if I can still get up and live my life, you can too.”
Tony just took a sip of his latte and smiled looking at his friends. “Yep, Steve’s got a daughter to be specific. A Coraline, even more specifically.”
“This is just a thing that Tony does. He’s got a lot of money so he just likes to tip really well when he can,” Steve rationalized. Clint gave him a disbelieving look, but shrugged.
The entire ride home, Steve struggled not to say something, anything that might fix the mess that Rumlow had caused. Once they got back to Tony’s penthouse, the alpha ran a hand through his hair. “I’m sorry about what happened back there. That asshole had no right to put his hands on you or to say the things he said. I got a little heated seeing him all over you like that, but I promise, that won’t ever happen again.”
Steve couldn’t help but give a fond smile as Tony deflated instantly. “Aww, come on babe, don’t feel bad about it. All that matters is that you’re both happy and in one piece.”
He had opted to walk to the cafe where he was meeting the doctor, to clear his mind a little. It only took ten minutes from him to get there, and once he did, he Bruce sitting at a table, watching those walking by. Once his eyes landed on Tony, he gave a sad smile.
“See, this is why I talk to you. No matter how much lip you give me, you end up churning out something useful in the end. I don’t care what Rhodey says about you, you’re really not that bad!”
Steve had just barely finished setting up the table before he heard a knock at the door. He quickly moved to open it and felt the air knocked out of his lungs as he took in the sight of Tony. The brunet was wearing a red button down shirt, sleeves rolled up, with a yellow skinny tie and dark fitted jeans. It took a moment of just shamelessly gaping at the man before Steve was able to actually speak.
“Okay, alright...good. Uh, I um, I figured since we never got a chance to watch my favorite holiday movie back in December, maybe we could watch it now?” Tony asked, suddenly nervous.
Tony huffed out a laugh before giving Steve a sad smile. “When I was a kid, I ran away from home after a particularly hard day of dealing with Howard’s shit—” Tony waved off the impending apology he knew Steve was preparing to give before continuing.
“No! I had no idea what was happening until it was too late. You were all gone to visit your families and I couldn’t ask you to come back for that. So I figured I’d just tough it out and everything would be ok. But Tony came by after I missed his holiday get together and once he saw me he knew.”
Before Steve had the chance to take Tony up on his offer, someone knocked loudly on the door. “Hmm, I’m not really sure who that could be, but I’m going to go check up on Cora, if you don’t mind getting that.”
"Atta boy," Rhodey replied, now becoming fully immersed in his work. As Tony walked away, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn't shake the dull thrum of loneliness he felt.
“I just...I don’t really know, if I’m being honest. I want to know if I have a chance, I’ve never really asked Steve about his dating history or preferences and it seems like it’d be obvious that I had a motive if I asked out of nowhere. But also I just need to know if I’m wasting my time even entertaining the thought of all this.”
Tony just smiled up at Steve, before continuing to sift through what the store had in stock. They had no clue where to start with making this costume, but they gathered everything they thought might work, along with costumes for themselves, and headed home.
James ‘Rhodey’ Rhodes had been Tony’s best friend since college. He’d been by Tony’s side through all of his ups and downs; the good, the bad, the ugly, and the down right horrendous. Tony knew that no matter what he could count on two people in life to always be there for him, and one of those people was Rhodey.
