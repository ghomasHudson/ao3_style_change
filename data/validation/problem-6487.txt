Ross had shown up just at dusk on the day of the attack, long after the battle was over and the cleanup was underway.  His Class A's had been dust-free, his shoes shined to a mirror gloss, the mass of ribbons and badges and medals on the left breast of his jacket exactly where the regs said they should be.  He'd given Steve, who still hadn’t managed to change out of his filthy, charred uniform, a hearty handshake and welcomed him back to active duty, but Steve had heard him muttering about something about “dressing like a clown” to his aide after the spiel about how honored he was to meet America's greatest hero.  Maria Hill had told him later that Ross expected his own men to hit the showers and pretty themselves up right after a mission, not stand guard over the wounded or check for hot spots.
Steve shook his head.  Tony and Clint had begun arguing about the kitchen, food, and cooking the day Clint had moved in, coffee maker and dog in tow, and they hadn’t stopped.  It was all in good fun, especially since neither of them could cook a lick, and their attempts at scratch cooking were a big reason why Bruce and Natasha had basically taken over meal prep.
Chief among those who held thus was Bishop Obadiah of Stane, King Huard's confessor and keeper of the privy purse. “The lad is young, and untried,” he murmured to the King when he should have been reminding Huard of the care of his realm and his immortal soul,or so the rumor said. “Fear not for thy country, though, for I will keep watch upon the land should evil come, and guide thy son from the path of sin to redemption and wise kingship.”
to be under new management, at least the replacement looked promising.  “Grass-fed beef, locally sourced tomatoes, artisan buns, sweet potato fries with stone-ground maple mustard - “
"So shall it be done," said the noble knight, and the nuns of Our Lady came to bear Stephanos away to their sanctuary, there to lie beneath the high altar, his shield upon his breast, in a casket of imperishable crystal, until the land should have need of him once more. And the chronicles speak no more of him for many a long year.
Antonius received the word of this man’s intent and immediately set his wisest men to studying the best means to counteract this threat. He also read all the tomes of magic and alchemy he could obtain for knowledge he could turn against this blackest of Knights. The whole kingdom was resolved to drive the Caput Rufus back to whatever pit of Hell had spawned him, peasant and poet and noble alike, and the air rang with the clap of the hammer and the buzz of arrows as the people prepared for deadly war.
He paused the longest at the image of his parents, Huard sternly holding an alembic in one hand and a sword in the other, Maria with her cherished volume of Miriam the Egyptian’s alchemical works open upon her breast. He dropped to his knees and said a prayer for their souls, then rose and made the Sign of the Cross before one parent, then the other. The Dragon of Ten Rings had taken them before their time, and as able as he had proved, always he would wonder if he had come to the throne too young and untried.
Graymarie enjoyed half a decade's peace before evil once again threatened the land. For all things must change, as Our Lord has willed it be so until the Day of Judgment when He shall judge the quick and the dead, and so at Eastertide in the sixth year of Antonius’ reign word came to Graymarie of a threat from the East.
“The gates of hell shall not prevail against this land. So I swore long years ago, and so I swear again,” declared Stephanos after she had departed, as he looked over the reports from abroad once more. “Abbess Carola said I was restored to life for a reason, and my heart tells me that this is the task appointed to me in ages past. Graymarie shall not fall while I have breath in my body or strength in my arm, my lord King.”
“Probably slept wrong,” he murmured to himself as he walked down the hall to the elevator.  He’d moved into what everyone was calling “Avengers Tower” just before Thanksgiving, when he’d finally given up on trying to make the drab little apartment SHIELD had found for him feel like something other than a grim reminder of what he’d lost.  He wasn’t a big fan of Tony Stark’s taste in furniture, artwork, or window curtains, but at least everything in his suite was brand new, not second hand junk that the head shrinkers had decided was comforting solely because it was old.
…word came from the East that one Ioannes, a Teutonic knight called Caput Rufus for a great battle scar that had left his face and pate as red as the fires of Hell, had turned from the path of God and sought the riches of Graymarie. This man, who was learned both in the arts of war and the most evil of magics, had conquered all in his path until he had ventured forth against the men of Kievan Rus. Their lord, the mighty Alexander, had repelled this Ioannes but at heavy cost to the land and people, and so could do no more than send swift messengers to the West to warn Antonius and the other Christian kings of the peril that Caput Rufus brought to their lands….
Which would be a really, really bad idea since the preceding ten (or twenty, but who was counting?) pages were full of drawings of various parts of Tony’s anatomy, including one that would have made it crystal clear that Steve was interested in a bit more than just muscle and drapery studies.
Steve flushed as he realized that Tony was giving his body a frankly appreciative up-and-down.  Army life had cured him of whatever self-consciousness being poked and prodded by doctors hadn't, but that didn't mean he had to enjoy being checked out.  “If it's my dream, guess it's up to me to change things.”
Tickets?  Tourists?  Even during the war they hadn’t tried to keep soldiers from going to church, not when every time you went might be the last, and –
Then Obadiah did utter a cry that cracked the very stones of the castle, and behold! a demon of Hell stood before the King! Then all understood that the estrangement between Huard and his Queen, and their deaths, and the drunkenness of Antonius’ youth, was all due to the fell interference of this accursed man. Father Edwin spoke the word of the anathema in a great and terrible voice, and Obadiah vanished as if he had never been.
fault, not yours or Clint’s or anyone else’s!  He brought the army, he attacked us!  Blaming either of you is crazy!”
King Huard himself was not the least of these mechanicians, as they became known, and his work graced the halls of castle and cloister. Marvelous were his creations: lights that needed no flame, instruments of war and defense that would defeat any who attacked the land, new draughts that might heal the sick and bring life to the dying. An oracular head of finest bronze was his great counselor, hight “Jarvis” for a wise friend and advisor who had fallen in battle, and there was no finer, richer land in all of Christendom.
Steve stared at the phone in shock.  Did Tony really think he’d have them throw someone out to make room for him?
Here Josephus, chronicler of Rochester, gives the roll of the Kings and Queens of Graymarie, from William of Naslund to Antonius the Man of Iron:
And thus did Antonius and the disguised Stephanos prepare to face the threat from the East, with hearts and hands and the blessings of God upon them both.
“Excuse, ma’am.”  Steve gave the family his best “buy war bonds for America!” smile.  “Did I hear you say something about tickets?  To get into a church service?”
“I would give all that I have and all that I am to save us, but I am untested in war and also my knights. Would that the Captain might return in our hour of need! For if ever we have needed a Knight to avenge our cause, it is now. Grant me the means to combat this Ioannes, that Graymarie might not fail under my guardianship and her folk be brought to utter ruin.” So did he lament, and weep, and pray far into the night, before the resting place of the Captain of Graymarie.
“It is said that this knight, called the Master of Men, is unstoppable,” said the lady. “Like unto one of the very devils of hell he is, tall and broad as a great oak tree, and impervious to pain. Beware, o King, for he seeks thy doom, and the doom of this land!”
- at the great statue of Atlas.  The bronze eyes were open and fixed directly on him, while a faint, almost amused smile played about the sculpted lips.
Even with that head start, it was still after 2230 when he finished trimming his nails, brushing his teeth, and giving himself a quick shave.  His suit, a navy blue chalk stripe in what they now called “athletic cut” instead of “big and tall,” hung on the door of his closet, along with a plain white shirt and a silk tie in a subdued dark print.  He had other clothing he liked better – he’d never been much for business clothes unless he had a job interview – but his mother would have reared up out of her grave and given him a talking to if he’d so much as joked about wearing anything but a proper suit to church.
Steve closed his eyes.  He wanted to believe Tony so badly it hurt, but how?  “Half the time I don’t even know what you’re talking about.  Any of you.  I’m trying to keep up, but I just – I - “
“Hey, hey, hey!  Hands off the pizza rolls!  Mine!”  Clint’s voice, half-angry, half-laughing, carried down the hall from the kitchen.
“Then dessert’s on me.  I know this great little place about three blocks away.  Best cannoli in Midtown,” said Tony.  He came around their table and stopped directly in front of Steve.  His eyes were very, very blue.  “That is, if you can reschedule with Logan?”
Antonius dropped to one knee, head bowed, one hand pressed to his heart. “Great Captain of Graymarie, hail and welcome! For thou hast come in answer to many prayers, at thy country’s hour of peril.”
A gust of wind blew down the street right into his eyes, making them water.  Steve blew out a breath.
“For surely the Dragon will leave when it has sated its hunger, and then we can rebuild our land,” he said, the words falling honey-sweet from his lips. And so it was that rather than taking arms against the foe, many foolish, frightened townsfolk did list to obey and repaired thus to the church to lament and cry woe, woe! when they might have spent their time in preparation and defense.
the portal until it was almost too late.  By the time Fury told his gun crews to start firing at least five or six more leviathans had come through, and guess where a couple of them headed?”
Read now the tale of Stephanos, Knight of the Star and Captain of fair Graymarie, and King Antonius, the Knight of Adamant, defender of the realm. This story came to me from the writings of the good chroniclers Brother Iacobus of Kurtzberg and the learned Josephus of Rochester, as well as many others, and I have told it as well as God allows. May the lives of these sweet friends, as close comrades as Amis and Amiloun, inspire all of chivalrous mind and noble heart!
Eventually it pleased God that the throne should fall to Lord Huard, son of Isaac of Stark, a merchant of great wealth and much learning. King Huard was keen of mind and nimble of hand, and under his rule Graymarie became a land that loved science and learning nearly as much as she loved freedom and the good of all people. Great scholars came from far Nuremberg and other lands where knowledge is valued, and soon Graymarie was the envy of the world for her artisans’ skill with metal and wood and all manner of smithcraft.
“Not yet,” said Atlas.  There was the groan of metal on metal as he took the whole weight of the world on one arm and leaned down to touch Steve’s forehead.  “You have much to learn.”
For truly I tell you, there before the King stood the Captain himself, Stephanos, Knight of the Star, alive and well and ripe for battle against the foe!
The plea in those dark, brilliant eyes was almost too much to bear.  Steve had to remember to breathe.  “I didn’t – I assumed – “
“So?  What just happened?”  Tony, who’d appropriated two to-go boxes from a bewildered teenage girl who had been clearing the tables, stood up as Steve worked his way back through the gawkers to their table. “Who was that guy?”
“I guess it’s St. Patrick's after all,” he said, and took an extra moment to steady himself before checking the closet for something he could wear to church.  At least he’d remembered to shower after his workout.
before he could stop himself, then turned off the phone and shoved it into the pocket of his coat.  A taxi lumbered past, slowly cruising for fares despite the hour.
Steve raised an eyebrow and gestured at the muscular, slow-moving waiter.  “The staff giving you a five minute rundown of every ingredient and where it was produced?  I’ve got an appointment later today, you know.”
Atlas chuckled, shifting the armillary sphere on his back as the sidewalk rumbled slightly.  “Most people don’t.  Just think of me as another god, like your friend Thor.  We aren’t all that different.”
After he had returned with proof of his triumph, Antonius let the nuns of Our Lady of Liberty tend his remaining wounds, and also those of his companions. His bloodied armor was cleaned, and he was declared the Knight of Adamant, for its strange metal had protected him well against the Dragon’s fire. Then he went in solemn procession to Our Lady of Liberty, his nobles and dear companions by his side, and with holy oaths did he forswear debauchery and rough companions to pledge himself, body and soul, to the service of his people. He then confessed his sins and was shriven by his own confessor, Father Edwin, before being crowned by the suffragan bishop David the Bruce, for Bishop Obadiah pled illness and kept to his own dwelling.
Another gust of steam wafted up from below.  Steve cautiously took a step backwards.  “I never would have guessed that.”
Steve cautiously laid his free hand on Tony’s upper arm, grip relaxing into a very slight caress at the other man’s smile.  His voice went husky as he leaned close enough to whisper, “Whatever you want, Shellhead.”
“Because he was so busy getting all pimped out to meet the great Captain America he didn't leave his quarters until everything was over but the shouting.”  Tony winced as Bruce revived enough to realize he was a captive, started to turn green, then went limp as one of Ross's men deployed a spray injector loaded with enough drugs to knock out an elephant.  “Remember, right after the attack the President pardoned Bruce for whatever the Hulk had done to the city, both then and when he broke Harlem a couple years ago.  Without you being a nice shiny distraction, Ross had all the time he needed to arrest Bruce before I could call Ellis to get the order signed.  Don't even ask what he's planned, because believe me, it ain't pretty.”
So the future of the land and the crown was Graymarie was secured, or so it seemed for many years. The young Prince proved as eager to learn as his parents, and the oracular head Jarvis pronounced him a flower of the land, with “a heart of iron and a will of adamant.”
“Foolish King!” cried the Bishop, and would have struck Antonius with his crozier had not Sir James stood between him and his liege. “Thy parents fell because they would not heed my will. The same fate shall befall thee! Fall upon thy knees and beg – “
“Uh huh,” said Tony after a few seconds.  He cocked his head again and held out the frond.  “I think you're supposed to grab this so I can whisk you off to learn what you're supposed to learn.  Still not sure what that is since you're, y'know, Captain America and the hope of the nation, but - “
“Lucky’s my companion, not a pet, it says so right on that thing Bruce printed out from the Internet about animal rights –
“Those were part of the weekly grocery order, which is bought and paid for with my ill-gotten gains,” said Tony.  There was a metallic
“Tony?  What – “  A cab rattled past, full of merrymakers on their way home from a party.  “What time is it?”
“Watch it, dude!” exclaimed a young man wearing nothing but jeans, a t-shirt, and a hooded windbreaker as Steve cut between him and a knot of matronly women striving to snap one of those selfie things to text to their grandchildren.  “Nearly busted my skateboard!”
Often did Antonius say thus, yet never came a reply, either from the Lord nor from the noble knight who lay insensible in the crypt. And so Antonius, despairing of his father’s love, took refuge in drink and loose companions and all manner of debauchery unfit for a king of any land, let alone fair Graymarie. His skill with weaponscraft and mechanical sciences was as great as any, but rumors flew that he would never be fit to rule in his father's stead.
Then did Stephanos, drawn by the nobility of Antonius’ countenance and his honest word, sheath his sword and set his shield upon his back. “That I will, for I have many questions for thee and thine.”
“So.  How's the company doing?  You've been awfully busy lately and I wanted to rough out next month's training schedule - “
Thus it was that King Huard, when age did come upon him, did proclaim his Bishop as regent, to rule in his stead should aught befall him and his Queen before their son should be ripe for the throne. Queen Maria was not best pleased with this, for she was as able as any man to rule, or any of the queens or lady knights of Graymarie’s past. King Huard would not be gainsaid, however, and thus his last years were spent in quarrels and animosity with his once-beloved wife and the son he should have cherished above all things.
For a few seconds he considered turning around and heading back to the Tower, or at least to the next nearest church; St. Vartan’s wasn’t Catholic but at least it was a church, and that would have to be enough unless he could find some place to hear Mass tomorrow.   It would be jammed in St. Patrick’s, worshipers packed like sardines, and he might not even be able to get up to the Communion rail.  But it wasn’t as if St. Vartan’s wouldn’t be crowded, too.
“I am no coward, foul creature!” cried Antonius in a great voice. He sallied forth, mounted upon a roan destrier as red as the setting sun, Sir James upon his left, the one called Stellarius on his right. “We shall not yield one inch of ground, nor a single silver penny give in tribute. Graymarie is not yours to take, nor ever shall be! Now get thee gone and do not return!”
So they grew closer and closer, the King and the Captain, even as did King David and his sweet friend Jonathan. Like unto brothers they were, dining at the same table and riding out each day to inspect the fortifications. They went together to Mass, and if Stephanos turned in good time to a confessor other than Father Edwin, it was right and meet that each man should have his own priest to shrive him as Our Lord directed.
Other hands have told of what befell Arthur at the final battle, and of the sundering of the Round Table and the fall of Camelot. Fair Graymarie alone of Arthur's possessions was spared this doleful fate, and that thanks to the grace of God, who richly blessed the efforts of Stephanos to rally the people and defend them against invasion and war. Isabel de Champagne has written of those early days, when Graymarie seemed lost until the Knight of the Star, his squire and household at his side, did repel those who would despoil the land and enslave the people, and I need not speak more of that time.
So it was that Howard broke with long custom and took unto him a wife, Maria Carbonelli from far-off Padua, in hopes of getting an heir of the body since he could find none suitable in his court. Brilliant was she, the equal of any man in learning and curiosity, with the dark beauty of her native land and a kind heart that called to mind Good Queen Bets, consort of King Geoffrey of the Mace. Great was the land’s rejoicing when she conceived and grew heavy with child, and greater still when she was safely delivered of a healthy son, named Antonius for Queen Maria’s father, a scholar of renown.
“You think that?  After seeing up close and personal what a couple of dictators did to Europe?  Really?” Tony demanded.  His eyes were hard, his voice harsh.  “Ever heard of a pyrrhic victory, Mr. Super Soldier?  That’s what we have if Fury doesn’t find you in time.  You’re the key, the heart and soul of the team – “
“Among other things,” said Steve, and waited for the critic to run out the door before slinging an arm around Tony and leading him out onto the street.
They stood inside a funeral home somewhere in the Midwest as a whole family – mother, father, little boy who couldn’t have been more than ten – was waked.  Steve blanched as he recognized the out of towners who’d driven straight into the attack, then blundered into an alley.  “These people –  I killed a Chitauri who was trying to get them.  No one else saw them?”
…and when the King returned to his people with the Dragon’s head, the people rejoiced greatly, for the Dragon had killed many folk of the countryside and the King and Queen besides. The elders declared that Antonius, young though he was, was fit to be King without a regent, and so he was crowned without delay despite the objections of the Bishop…
Steve closed his eyes, remembering the pretty waitress who’d served him the day before the attack.  She’d been kind, even when he’d made a fool of himself talking about radios.  “How many, Tony?”
“Lord, I beg thee to grant thy grace to my poor land! For though my machines are mighty, they alone cannot suffice to withstand the evil approaching swift from the East. We have but lately recovered from the deprivations of the Dragon, and my people despair that we have not the means to fight.
“Well.  It seems that back in the 60's someone had the bright idea of filming a burningYule log and showing it on Christmas morning so all the people who didn’t have a fireplace could still get into the holiday spirit – “
Tony cocked his head as an equally flowing white robe swirled into place around Steve's body.  “Not quite as good a view, but now I can see why that art student at the Met last week wanted you to pose.”
“Me?”  Steve watched as half a dozen airmen dumped the ruined plane off the flight deck into New York harbor.  “I spent my time on the ground.  You and Thor were the air support.  I didn’t – “
This time he could not deny the tears as it all came crashing down:  loss, grief, all the things he’d had and would never have again.  He had just enough presence of mind to stumble behind the statue before someone recognized him and snapped a picture of the great Captain America acting like he was drunk, even though the last time alcohol had effected him was before most of the city was even born.
Steve cautiously pushed himself to a sitting position.  He’d somehow ended up sprawled behind the  statue of Atlas across from St. Patrick’s, cheek pressed against the cold, smooth granite.  “Thanks. Coffee?”
And so Stephanos settled his great shield upon his arm, summoned his squire and all the men who had followed him from Rome, and rode him off to Graymarie.
Tony frowned.  “You’re not wrong about what went down.  Why do you think I sent Thor over?  That story about Loki fooling Zeus into thinking he was a girl was the best distraction I’ve seen since the time Rhodey dropped a tank on a statue of some dictator in Madripoor.”
Steve shuddered.  Maybe he was a soldier now, but he was still an artist deep down.  “What’s next?  The Chrysler Building?  The Statue of Liberty?”
Only Prince Antonius, now King, refused so to retreat. He rose from the gaming table, drank him of a potion that restored his wits, and called for arms and armor, saying, “Neither bite nor sup shall I have until my parents are revenged and our land is once again at peace.” Nor would he listen to Obadiah, who ordered him to stay in the capitol, safe from harm, even though Obadiah was regent and should have had the final say.
“Right.”  Someone – an usher? – stepped out of St. Patrick’s for a breath of air.  Steve started toward him to see if they somehow could find space for one more.  “This has been really interesting, but I should go.”
…then did the Dragon of Ten Rings fall upon the land, and lay waste to many of the fields and forests. The people cried out for succor, and so King Huard, old though he was, set out with his Queen and many of his most senior knights and men at arms to end the fell creature’s rampage upon the land.
The waiter narrowed his eyes, and if his face had been a little less blocky he would have looked annoyed.  “What would youse like on the side?  Sweet potato fries, regular fries, plantain frieds, turnip fries, salad – “
Steve drew in a shocked breath as a blast of cold wind swept the flight deck.  The runway was pockmarked from what looked like a series of massive explosions, the black surface half-melted in places.  A damage control party aimed a fire hose at the smoldering wreck of a quinjet, the smoke whirling about an ascending medevac copter with stretchers – or were they body bags? - strapped safely to its landing skis.  The serial number on the bridge was all but hidden by a blast mark from an energy weapon of some sort.  Maria Hill, half her face covered by bloody gauze, leaned heavily on a female medic’s shoulder as the two women picked their way toward a triage station.
Victory came to Graymarie in the end, thanks be to God! Stephanos himself vanquished the Master of Men with a single thrust from his lance, while Ginevra and her lady knights drove back the warrior women of the North. Antonius personally directed his siege engines and mechanicians against the foe, and mighty did they prove in battle. Ioannes did rage and swear at the loss of his knight and then deploy all matter of foul sorceries against Graymarie, but even his strongest efforts were as nothing against the clever work of the King of Adamant and the stout arm of the Knight of the Star.
“I – no - don't let me get in your way,” he said, the words far higher pitched than he'd intended, and was back in the elevator and slamming the button for his floor before either man could say a word.
“Lonely?  Far from it,” said Atlas with another rumbling laugh.  “The greatest city of your country is spread out before me.  Millionaires, janitors, young mothers and old men – they all walk past me, and I hear what they say.  Even on Olympus itself I was never so surrounded by life as I am today.”
…never had the prayers of a ruler of Graymarie been answered so swiftly and in such fashion, as God was pleased to work a mighty miracle to bring succor to the land. King Antonius was greatly surprised to see proof of the blessings of God made manifest in such a fashion….
“Steve.  We weren’t talking about you.  Clint’s dog had just knocked an ice cube tray and a package of those frozen fruit things Bruce likes off the island onto the floor, right into the the mutt’s water dish.  I was telling him he should have kept Lucky in his room.  Nothing more.”
“Cannoli?  Always have,” Steve murmured, and no, he wasn’t imaging the quick shudder that ran through the other man.  “Just because I don’t go around telling everyone and his uncle doesn’t mean I don’t.”
“Uh huh.”  Even the way the man chewed was perfection, and oh, Tony was going to hate himself if he was reading this wrong.
“Oh ho!  There you are,” said a familiar voice.  There was a burst of golden light that made him wince.  “I was wondering when you'd get here.”
“Mother Mary.”  Steve   As much as this hurt, he needed to see the rest.  “Don’t tell me.  They sent an advance scout to Washington and took out the Capitol?”
He dressed, combed his hair, and slipped on a pair of black wingtips that were only slightly stiff.  For a moment he considered wearing a hat, but he'd always hated them, even in the Army, so he left the snap brim he'd picked up a few months ago in its box.  St. Patrick's was less than fifteen minutes on foot.  He'd be fine.
“I learned no such thing, Master of Lies,” said Stephanos then, and behold! he twitched aside his cloak and shook the cover from his shield, and there rode the Knight of the Star! “Arminius was a cruel and evil man who would have destroyed all that is good in this land, and it is right and meet that he met his end at the hands of those who love liberty. By Our Lady, his blood hath no place here, and I join my king in saying, get thee gone!”
Huard eventually passed his first youth, and as was Graymarie’s custom, he cast about him for an heir to sit the throne and be guardian and ruler when it pleased God to call him to his rest. Alas! None of the nobles or men of learning proved acceptable to the councils of the realm, nor did any of the knights who served him have the strength of heart and mind to serve.
The hall was quiet and dark when he uncoded the lock to his room, slipped into his coat, and stepped out of his quarters.  He pulled on his gloves, checked his watch – 2305, cutting it close but there should still be standing room even if the Cardinal was officiating – and punched the
“Of course.”  JARVIS waited as the mechanism whirred to life and they began their descent.  “Should I inform Sir and the other Avengers that you are leaving the Tower?  Agent Barton is attempting to trim a Christmas tree, Agent Romanov and Ms. Potts are preparing to retire for the night, Dr. Banner and Sir are arguing about the Large Hadron Collider, and Prince Thor is conducting a video call with Dr. Foster.”
…Antonius did repair with Stephanos to the cloisters of the Abbess of Our Lady, a lady of high renown and prowess hight Carola Danverius. This lady had herself been a knight before taking the veil after the loss of Queen Maria, and kindly welcome did she make to the Captain after Antonius had conveyed him hence.
These words of Stephanos had been repeated by every ruler of Graymarie upon their coronation day, confirmed by solemn prayers and oaths before the high altar in Our Lady of Liberty. Antonius himself had spoken them scarce six years prior, and now they lay heavy in his heart as he took his place at the prie-dieu and readied himself for prayer.
Dawn was breaking upon the land and the good nuns had bestirred themselves to attend Prime, when Antonius was roused not by their gentle footsteps but by a great scraping sound from the altar. He came awake with a cry, right hand held out before him against whatever devilry this might, but behold! it was not devilry, but a miracle such as had not been seen in Graymarie since the healing of Lady Constance, Duchess of Ferrara, through the intervention of the Blessed Jehan.
…the blacksmiths worked day and night to fill the armories, for Ioannes was now in the Low Countries and had announced that he would take Graymarie by the fall. Antonius brought to his court a new knight, one Stellarius of Hibernia, who was said to be skilled in tactics and siegecraft, and set him to preparing castle and countryside for the coming invasion. This man was much in the King’s company, and all men remarked that they soon became as close as brothers, even as Amis and Amiloun of great repute. Even so, none were jealous of him, even the King’s dear friend Sir James, for so good of heart and open of hand was Stellarius that there was none in Graymarie who did not love him and seek his good opinion…
In this he was wrong, for peace had not lessened Stephanos' strength, nor the keenness of his watchers upon the borders. Scarce had Arminius set sail when Robert, Sentinel of the Land, sent word to Stephanos to prepare the defenses. Thus did Arminius find himself pitted against the army of the Five Isles, not a mere garrison such as he had expected.
“Just checking to see if there’re any leftovers before I head to church.”  JARVIS must have noticed him flinch because the car was noticeably warmer by the time he’d reached his destination.  “Christmas Eve  Mass  always attracts a crowd.”
“What is this?“  Steve gestured at the carnage.  It was clearly spring, not winter – what was going on?  “When did this happen?”
Ioannes rode forth under the flag of truce, his heralds and the dread knight they called the Master of Men at his side, as the two sides faced each other across the fields of Kasserine. “King of Graymarie! I have come to treat with thee. Come out, or let the world know thee as a coward!”
“Turkey burger with cranberry ketchup?  More like someone’s idea of Thanksgiving at a hipster hotel.”  Tony made a little
Steve blinked, then carefully lowered his hands. “Sorry about that.  I don’t usually talk to statues.”
“May it be as thou hast said, my lady,” said Stephanos, and knelt for her blessing. He then tied back his hair, for it had grown long during his time in the crypt, and took up his shield. It had been covered with black cloth to conceal its shining star until the time was right, for Stellarius would be a knight without arms until it pleased the King to reveal his true identity. Sir James then conveyed him outside the capitol under cover of night, that they might enter the gates in the full light of day, for many noble warriors and men at arms were journeying to Graymarie to join the armies now that Ioannes and his men had drawn nigh.
“Sure, that sounds great,” Tony blurted out, mentally wondering if there were any relatively private spaces in the long downward spiral of Frank Lloyd Wright’s last great building.  “You’ll have to explain it to me since I’m not an artist.”
A volley of barks sounded, partially masked by a bright, loud crash and a violent burst of swearing.
Meanwhile the preparations for war continued, with King and mechanician and knight alike striving with all their might to create defenses fit to withstand the coming evil…
“Sounds interesting,” said Steve.  He breathed deep of the night air, let the noise and the pace of the city wash over him.  “Tell me more.”
Steve broke into a smile that was as bright and beautiful as the afternoon sun streaming in through the restaurant’s plate glass windows.  “Don’t be too sure of that.  Your armor could be right out of a Futurist – “
And so it was that though Arthur fell, and darkness descended upon his former lands, Graymarie alone survived, a shining beacon of light against the darkness of those times. For Stephanos, who would accept neither crown nor any title beyond Captain of the People, fulfilled his oath to Arthur and kept Graymarie safe against all comers. His great shield, once borne by St. George and marked with a shining star to guide the army, was ever in the van when danger threatened, and soon none dared attack Graymarie, so fierce was its champion and so skilled in all the arts of war.
“That was Jan, not me, and it wasn’t turkey, it was seitan.”  Steve’s own burger looked as simple and straightforward as the man himself, with a nice char to the meat, perfectly melted cheese, and a slice of red, juicy tomato that Tony could practically taste across the table.  “How are the sweet potato fries?  They look awfully – big,” he finished, and was that actually a blush staining his cheeks?
Stephanos lifted his head at that and gazed upon the King, so proud and noble even in the workman’s clothes he wore whilst studying his learned tomes. His face softened, and also his voice, so accustomed to calling out over the clash of swords and the roar of battle. “I would welcome that. Few know that in my youth, before I attained a man’s growth, I learned to draw and paint from the monks at the monastery of St. Padraig, near my home. I have not held brush nor pen in long years, but now I desire to see the arts of the land I have sworn to defend.”
There was a rustle as Tony held out the frond.  “Good guess, but not quite.  One of their whale things did break away and head south, presumably toward DC.  Fortunately the Air Force scrambled a couple of fighters to keep it busy until Rhodey got there and finished it off.  It didn’t even reach Delaware, thank God or whatever.”
Equally skilled were Stephanos' companions, whose deeds were scarcely less worthy than those of Arthur's court. What can I say that has not already been said about Gaius Cervullulus, Stephanos' squire and constant companion? His sergeants Nicholas Furiosus and Timothy of Wales, and the royal bard Gabriel, who played the war pipes so sweetly that one might thing he was the archangel himself? Margaret the Lady Knight, who would have wed Stephanos had he not been sworn to the service of the land instead of to a single lady? Their exploits are legend second only to those of Stephanos himself, and without their prowess and loyal service there is little doubt that Graymarie would have followed Camelot into darkness.
For his part, Antonius had long struggled alone to bear the burden of royal rule. Although he loved Sir James and Lady Ginevra and all those of his household well, yet none of them were of equal rank, and none knew the heavy weight of leadership. Stephanos had himself been a king in all but name, and though he now deferred to Antonius, he understood well what the young King faced. Soon Antonius found himself seeking out Stephanos merely for good company, and it was clear to all that the one known as Stellarius returned his feelings in full measure.
Steve hadn’t been skating in years, not since he’d broken his tailbone out at Prospect Park while Bucky’s little sister laughed at how wobbly his ankles were.  Going now, when he was strong and fit and could keep up,  might be fun, especially if he held Tony to his promise about hot chocolate.  There was nothing better for keeping warm on a cold day, even when all he had was powdered milk, the emergency chocolate from his K-rats, and water heated on the exhaust manifold of a Jeep to keep the cold at bay –
“I figured after that last text of yours.  Being shut out of church on Christmas can’t be much fun.”  Tony reclaimed the mug, stood and held out his free hand to Steve.  “Need help?  I saw you favoring your left while you were sparring with Nat this afternoon.”
“What home?” Steve said, ignoring the sudden burn of salt on his cheeks.  His voice was all but unrecognizable, even to himself.  “Like you give a damn.”
There was no sound for much, much too long.  Tony’s jaw worked as he visibly fought for control.  “I never said that to Clint.  Not once.  The only time I came close was when Loki’s glowstick – “
Slowly he rolled into a kneeling position.  He’d learned not to panic at waking up in a strange place – last spring had taught him the dangers of
Steve swallowed.  “Sorry,” he managed.  “I’ve been out of town for a while.  In the Army.  I didn’t know – “
Steve pressed his forehead to a knight’s sarcophagus.  The blackened granite was still intact, but half the exterior wall was gone.  “Thor lead armies.  He should have known.”
The worst loss of all was Stephanos himself. He fought bravely and ever in the van, and had not Arminius tricked him into single combat he might well have lived to see another day. Woeful to tell! It was not so; Stephanos was cast into the freezing water even as he struck the death blow against his old enemy, and by the time he was found and brought to land again he was insensible, his noble face so cold it might have been carved from marble, and none could rouse him nor detect any signs of life.
Up spoke the abbess of Our Lady of Liberty, Jehane de Fostorius. Wise was she in leechcraft and all the arts of medicine, and high in the councils of the land. "Give the Captain to me, noble knight, for it may be that his service to our land is not yet ended. My nuns and I will bear him hence and do all we can to preserve his life, for my heart tells me that a time will come when we will have need of our Captain once again."
A sudden buzz at his hip jerked him out of his imagination.  He pulled out his phone, unlocked it, and blinked at the notification of a text from aestark@avengers.stark.biz.  He tapped the icon, frowning slightly.  What was Tony doing up so late?
“This I will do, my lord king,” said Stephanos, bowing low. “Not death itself shall prevent me from fulfilling this my oath. Graymarie shall be my home, and her people's welfare my chief concern, until the Lord declares my life be over.”
He glanced both ways, then crossed the street and took his place in the line.  Two women, one scarcely more than a girl, the other in a full length fur coat, edged forward.  A man in a tastefully cut chesterfield gave him a brief smile and put his arm about the woman in mink.  “Did you bring your ticket, honey?  It’s going to be packed.”
“Yule log?” Steve finished his cocoa and followed Tony out onto Fifth Avenue.  He could go to church in the morning.  “I thought the Viking invented those.”
Tony hastily pulled the perfectly toasted Ancient Grain Bun off his turkey burger, visibly sagging at the sight of nothing more than turkey and cranberry ketchup.  “All clear, thank God.  That was too good to waste.”
"Long have I suspected that he poured poison in my father's ear against me and my lady mother, though he be ever so holy," Antonius told Father Edwin. In time all but a few had forgotten that Bishop Obadiah was ever more than a figure of the shadows, complaining and muttering and keeping to his own lands, not the once-great counselor to a king.
“Space armies,” said Tony, reaching out to grip his good shoulder, and Steve found himself clutching at the other man’s hand.  “Plus, every Asgardian knows how to fight and use some magic.  It literally never occurred to him that New York was eight million civilians and no fortifications.”
He all but sprinted into his suite once the elevator opened.  He swallowed, slammed the door shut, and all but sprained his thumb activating the DNA lock.  The room was supposed to be set for a comfortable 72 degrees but all Steve could feel was the bitter cold of the wind over Greenland as the Valkyrie began her death dive into the dazzling white.  He bit back a curse that was half-scream, staggered to the bed, and  slid down beside it, wrapped in the spread and the quilts, until the shivering stopped.
.  Tony made a face and grabbed Steve’s hand with surprisingly strong fingers  “Next life lesson, and just as an aside, if you ever do this again can we go with Prometheus?  He’s much more my speed, plus we could take a spin around the rink at Rockefeller Center before they recycle the tree or whatever they do with it these days.  They have hot cocoa, not that it’s all that good, but hey, chocolate, you know?“
“Well, sweet potatoes are pretty long,” said Tony after a pause, and yes, Steve was definitely a bit pinker than usual.   Maybe his crush wasn’t quite as hopeless as he’d always assumed?  “Want to try one?  They’re awfully good, especially with a little mustard right on the tip.”
“Right after the Chitauri attack,” said Tony.  His saffron robe whipped about his legs in the briny wind.  “You’re still in the ice, which means no one directing traffic on the ground.  Fury had Hill relay orders over the comm link, at least until those space whale things showed up.  Without you - ”
“All of which sounds great, but ‘artisan’ usually means high prices, at least in my book.”  Steve rubbed the back of his neck.
He came to himself with a violent shudder as Tony, one hand smeared with aloe juice, the other clutching Clint's dog by the collar, stuck his head into the hall.  “What?”
Ioannes would not be swayed, however, not by courage nor the sight of Stephanos the Captain. “Upon thy head be the destruction of all thou hold dear, foolish King,” said he, and rode back to his lines crying to his generals to give the signal to attack.
In the meanwhile Antonius did write letters in his own hand summoning one “Stellarius of Hibernia” to his court to serve as esquire and champion during the preparations for war. This would be the name Stephanos bore, lest Ioannes learn of his return and come with all speed to attack before the Captain had regained his strength of mind and body. Sir James and Lady Ginevra alone did he tell of Stephanos’ return, for he trusted them in all things and could count on their silence.
When the enemy saw their chief defeated, they faltered, then turned as one and fled for the border. The forces of Graymarie pursued, slaying many and forcing the others back to their ships, capturing much spoil of war and treasure seized from other lands. This wealth Antonius declared should go to those orphaned and widowed by the battle, that they not starve, with a portion to the Church as a thank offering. The sorcerous devices and manuscripts Ioannes had in his train he ordered destroyed, that their foulness no long pollute the land, and the enemy dead he declared should be buried in a single grave with proper rites. Only Ioannes the Red Skull was excepted from this, as Antonius had Father Edwin declare him anathema and convey his body to be burned, as he was no Christian and did not deserve better.
Alas! This beauty and skill availed the Prince little insofar as his sire was concerned. For as wise and worthy Huard had been as a king, so was he distant and cold as a father and husband. Some said it was because the Queen, fearful of death in childbed, denied him her favors, while others claimed it was guilt that he had put aside Graymarie’s long tradition and gotten him an heir of the flesh and not of the heart. Still others held that Huard saw in Antonius such brilliance and promise that he could never hope to match, and thus envied his own child so much he could scarce stand to see the boy at all as he waxed old and found himself less and less able to engage in the work he loved.
Antonius for his part would never accept to be parted from his dear friend, for truly no men were ever closer than the Knight of the Star and his King. In good time they knelt before Bishop Edwin (for so he was in after times) and swore oaths of perpetual friendship in the Slavonic fashion, to cleave only to each other and take no wife nor other companion, and so dwelt together in great contentment until the end of their days. They were succeeded by Lady Penelope, daughter of James and Felix, who reigned wisely and well, as her godfathers had taught her, and the land was long at peace.…
Steve swallowed, eyes wide, and gulped down about a third of his water at once.  “Sure,” he managed when he’d caught his breath, and opened his mouth as Tony dipped, tapped off the excess mustard, and held out a single thick, beautifully fragrant fry.  “Mmm.  That really is good.”
“It’s a lot better than that.”  The cocoa was exactly the right temperature to warm without scalding, and Steve found himself smiling despite the cold and damp.  “I needed that.”
“Gladly will I accept thy oath, my good Stephanos,” cried the noble king, and when oaths had been sworn and accepted he raised Stephanos with both his hands to kiss him on cheek and brow. “Go now to Graymarie with what men owe thee allegiance, and tell its defenders that I, Arthur, did send thee to its defense.”
“The ways of the Almighty are not for us to question, my son. All we know is that the King prayed for one to aid him in defending the realm, and thou wert restored unto us,” said the good lady abbess. “What thy part in the coming war may be is not for me to say, but I feel in my heart that it will be a great one, and for the good of all.”
, then a sliding sound as something shifted on the polished granite countertop.  “That makes them mine, and – “
The King then sent word to the nuns of Our Lady, and also their chaplain priests, to venture forth throughout the land to cleanse it of the harm Obadiah had done during his years of power. And so it was done.
“Most of the collection can be restored, or so they say.”  Tony gestured, and they stood in what had probably been a gallery as conservationists and museum employees triaged the damage.  One young man was all but in tears as he gathered up what was left of an illuminated manuscript, while a middle aged woman gently sponged soot and ash from an altarpiece.  “Rebuilding the Guggenheim, though – that’ll take years even if someone raises the money.  Ditto the American Wing at the Met.”
But the wood was strong and he'd been weakened and there was absolutely no chance of escape like this. But he kicked despite the searing, blinding pain that comes with every move of his leg. And he punched, despite the same accompanying pain with every move of his arm.
He didn't want to ruin the child's life. Would putting it up for adoption be better for it? Surely someone else out there in the world was better suited to be a parent. Surely there was someone more prepared than he was.
With his lips right next to Peter's ear, he fucking growled. "No you don't, not yet Peter. Be a good boy and wait, can you do that for me? Can you wait for me Petey?"
He sat down in a chair in the corner of the room and started reading one of the old paperbacks from the basket by the door. The letters were fading and the paper was turning a yellow color, but it was still legible. This was the first book he'd read in a long time, but he'd read this one before, and somehow he still remembered bits and pieces of it, in the same way, he remembered bits and pieces of himself.
He was exhausted, but nothing would put him off of the path of looking for Peter. Not the lack of sleep, or the fact that Bruce had been sneaking away from him sometimes. What he was doing at this point, Tony didn't care. Nothing mattered more to him now than finding Peter, and the woman that put him in his care in the first place.
Peter, who seemed more confused by Wade's talk just shook his head. "I could already make life! I'm not asking to hear more of your cryptic bullshit, Wade!"
So is Natasha. To be clear, she pretends not to have any feelings whatsoever. She puts up a front, a wall, a shield. She hides her emotions away because she was trained not to feel anything at all. The Red Room stripped her of everything that she once was or ever could have been. Natasha never told anyone in detail about The Red Room, but Peter read all kinds of stories about a myth of an experiment and he knew it was true. And Bucky had been there once upon a time, and saved Natasha from whatever fate staying would have held for her.
The moment they freed his hands he sat up and pulled them both close to his chest, pressing kisses to the tops of their heads as he spoke to them in the Soldier's native tongue.
And what if, Bucky thought, as he looked to Peter's sleeping, shaking form... What if this was just a simple sickness? What if this would pass in a couple of days and Peter would be brand new? But then, he thought, what if it wasn't?
The room was nearly silent, no sounds filling the air but Bucky's cries and the grinding of the metal plates in his arm. He'd balled up his fist, and Steve knew he was angry, but Bucky looked like he was ready to speak, so he stayed silent to let him do so.
The boy nods and shivers a little. Even Bucky admits it's a little cold. Bucky stands, taking his blanket over to the boy. "Here, cover up. I'm warm enough, but I can't risk you getting another cold."
Steve hung his shield on his back and stepped out into the open space, slowly making his way towards Bucky. He gently called his lover's name as he inched closer, trying to gauge any reaction he might get from the man. He didn't get one, as the man before him was far too indulged in repeatedly stabbing the everloving fuck out of the agent beneath him.
Peter sighs as he follows her around and watches her look at pencil skirts. "I wanted to try a different style, I guess... Find something that made me fit into the family better. And... And I've always sorta liked the way the feminine clothes look, and I've always kinda wanted to wear them. Not like, be a girl, not that there's anything wrong with that, cause girls are awesome, but..."
Peter was nodding along to the man's words, ignoring the way his head was being petted. He wanted those things. He didn't want to sleep in a box anymore.
Peter felt like his life was so fucked right now. A baby? He was carrying a fucking baby in a country he'd never been to, surrounded by people that he didn't know, and-
He was interested in him for another reason, again, not because he cared, but because there was a serious lack of females on base, and Peter happened to like dick. That, and he was given a new mission. Since Deadpool's DNA wasn't working, and Rumlow was now a successful experiment, then he would serve as the replacement.
Steve didn't know what he could have been thinking back then. He was 5'7" and 110 pounds soaking wet. He was lucky enough to even know how to throw a punch in the first place, but take a guy down? That'd be a damned miracle.
Wade shook his head and laughed a little as he grabbed Peter's butt. "Nothing is too good for you, Petey baby."
He got up and ran again, back through the double doors. This time he was in the dark, everything around him was pitch black. He could feel his spidey senses tingling, but he couldn't see anything coming.
before he took the older man's length into his mouth. Peter made a show of deepthroating the man as far as he could manage, and then some. Rumlow's only response was the occasional grunt and then grabbing Peter's head to keep pushing the boy farther down on the length of his cock.
The first time during the ride that Bucky speaks, he easily depresses everyone within earshot. "We missed his birthday..."
Another beat and Peter nodded again. Steven seemed to understand and sighed. "Peter... What you have is a mild panic disorder. The stress and anxiety you have in your life cause your heart rate to rise exponentially, resulting in dizziness, feeling faint... I think your heart rate may have risen too high and... When's the last time you slept?"
Wade kneels next to Peter with the bag and smiles. "You told me once that this was your favorite sandwich, and I didn't want to show up empty-handed on your first day back."
Natasha glanced towards Bruce, who was looking at the floor as he played with his sleeves. He didn't dare look at her, especially not since she knew the secret he'd been trying so hard to keep. If she wasn't so damn sneaky then she wouldn't know, but it's hard to hide a secret when someone walks right into it. He remembers the look on her face when she saw... She looked shocked more than anything, but even that only lasted a couple of moments. She just stared for the longest time. And then, with a disappointed sigh, she turned and left, closing the door behind her.
Bucky and Nat were both sporting more weapons than usual. This was their son and they were not about to arrive short-stocked on weapons and risk losing the boy forever.
Wade seemed near frantic that he may have messed something up, and Peter let him go on while he rose from the bed covered in his gifts. The boy sat the box down and shook his head. "No, I love it. I love it all... You didn't have to do all of this..."
also, I kinda wanna start taking prompts or whatever and posting little one chapter drabbles for you guys, if you'd be interested?
He heard an Agent say something about having guarded agents nearby, in case they found the secret entrance into the basement area. The other Agent asked why they didn't just go up there and kill them all, and Peter cried out again, begging for them to be left alone.
He turned to go back the way he came, but he collided with a wall that he knew wasn't there a second ago. Or maybe it had been... There was no way of telling where he was in the compound right now, and it was terrifying. His silent steps made it easy for him to hear something scuffling not far off, but it never came closer than a few feet. It seemed like it was inspecting him rather than trying to take any kind of action against him. Whatever it was, Peter hoped that turning the lights on would make it go away.
Bucky let out a groan against the skin of Steve's neck as Nat dug her nails into his thigh. Steve's whining was like music to Bucky's ears as he rolled his hips. Without even looking Bucky could pinpoint the moment that Nat started touching herself just so she could get a little something, and he decided that wouldn't do. Bucky was not about to let the only lady do all the work and not get anything out of it, so he used his grip on her hair to pull her to her feet.
There were a couple of loud clicks as Natalia flipped on the light switches. When Bucky turned, the lights had come on and there in the middle of the room was their prisoner. The cloth bag hid his face but they'd been doing this long enough to know that beneath it he was covered in crusted blood.
Bucky smirks and takes another bite from the candy bar. "I didn't, until just now, but I had a hunch. It's amazing you're so good at your job, falling for a trick like that."
He felt arms wrapping around his body and he tried to fight them. There were too many. He pulled a second knife from his person and jabbed it into one of the arms. He heard a yell as the arm retracted, and he continued to fight to get away. He swung and elbowed at the people behind him and kicked his legs out to change the balance.
There weren't walls to split up the floor plan, so the kitchen, living room and office area were all parts of the same room. With a shiver, he lit the fireplace so Peter wouldn't be cold when he got up and then proceeded to set up Peter's computer and equipment on the small desk in the corner. Part of him knew that Peter would want to get to work the moment he woke up.
The door opened not long after Bucky left, and in walked Nat along with a limping Peter. He had crutches that he used, but Steve understood that sometimes they can get a little, okay, a lot, annoying. Somehow, Peter never let them bother him.
Professional 3D Whitestrips, shea sugar scrub, Himalayan salt scrub, miracle hair mask, apple cider vinegar and Himalayan sea salt scalp scrub, brush cleanser, a cleansing pad, mascara guard, lash tool and curler, a mini eyebrow tweezer set,
So, Pepper led both boys through the store with a smile and helped Peter check off the things he was missing. Foundation, concealer, pressed powders and the like. Peter kept looking at the cheaper stuff, but Tony kept reminding him that he was allowed to get whatever was the best, even if it was expensive. Tony had a lot of money that he could spend on Peter, and he wasn't going to let the boy forget it.
"Somebody took Peter." He called as he approached Steve. He handed the watch over to his lover and watched as Steve brought up Friday. He asked the AI if there was any footage of what happened, and she brought up a hologram of the last 30 seconds of recording before Peter's pulse disappeared from the reader.
Peter reached up and pulled the ball cap from Wade's scarred head and tossed it to the floor with a smile. Wade just looked on fondly, like nothing else in the world mattered, and really in his mind, nothing else did.
Peter nodded as he rubbed the sleep from his eyes and Bucky got up from the bed to go down to the kitchen. Peter followed, half leaning on Natasha as they made their way through the halls. As everyone on base knew, tired Peter was a clumsy Peter, and he often walked into things. Walls, furniture, other people. He once knocked into the counter and apologized to it, unaware that there were three other people in the kitchen to see it all unfold. Another time he ran into Vision and mistook him for a wall, but apologized anyway.
Either way, 3 days in and I've technically put out a chapter a day so far! Let's hope I can keep this up for a little bit.
"Not at all... He was throwin' up when he called. Was sleepin' when I picked him up." Bucky shifted in his chair and tucked his feet beneath him like a bird on a nest. "No fever, n' he's been fine ever since."
With a shaking breath, Tony turned and stepped to the side out of the doorway. He could see Peter shaking from where he was stood, and he truly didn't want to see the kid suffer. Once Natasha and Bucky passed them and left, he turned to look down at Bruce. "Did you recheck his bloodwork?"
But Steve was still being so kind to him, he was listening intently and giving him all of the attention, even when the waitress tried flirting with him. It was like their first date all over again, which occurred in his very shop.
Wade turned the lights down a little more before crawling into bed with Peter and pulling him close. He kissed the boy on the top of his head and felt Peter grip tightly onto his arm with both hands.
Tony walked right up to him and was about to hug him for the first time ever when he saw the irritated burn peeking above his collar. The skin hadn't even begun to heal properly yet, which meant Tony absolutely had to intervene. Luckily, Tony Stark knew how to keep hospitals quiet, especially after all the visits he'd had. Sure, hospitals already had confidentiality rules, but Tony needed to make sure that not a single word about him was going to be breathed to the public.
Peter was healing from his injuries at an even slower rate than he was before he stabbed Wade. What had these assholes done to him?
Peter didn't dare to ask any kind of questions, fearing that the gun in the man's hands would be turned on him if he did so much as breathe too loudly. Despite all the time he's spent here, he's still so deathly afraid that he'll never make it out.
Bucky didn't feel any better but he appreciated the humor, staying silent to allow the prince to continue. "I'm here to offer a place for you and your young son inside of our borders. I can offer you safety, a sense of normality, jobs, a home. Anything you might need for the time you stay with us."
Peter had been on some much-needed bed rest after his latest incident. He took a week off of school to recuperate and recover from the recent stress of his day to day life. He'd been in the middle of playing video games when his phone buzzed beside him. Thinking that it was Mr. Stark, he picked it up before seeing that it was actually Wade, asking him how he was doing.
She touched her stomach and thought back to her unborn child for the first time in many many years, and for the first time since then, she let herself shed a tear. Not just for herself...
Peter might not ever say anything to Mr. Stark about it, but he was truly so very thankful for everything... He knew that without Mr. Stark, he probably wouldn't be alive right now... Little did Peter know that without him, Tony might not be alive right now either.
He watched as the head disappeared against Eddie's skin and saw the man pull a cell phone from his pocket. "Guard this with your life, Peter. Once you know what's on it, you'll know when you need to use it. Use it too early, and you could get yourself killed. Call me as soon as you turn it over."
Peter paused, smile momentarily fading. "You're not disappearing to Italy for 10 years or anything, are you?"
He let out a somewhat angry sigh and picked up the pace, barely making it past the cutoff for Stark's censors before the systems switched back on... That was too fucking close, Christ Wade, pay more attention, will you? The whole plan is on you. Win or lose, it's your fault... If anyone gets busted, they'll find some way to pin it all on you.
Peter knew that he was right. A semi-automatic was much quicker than a kitchen knife and they both knew it. James was behind him whispering in his ear.
When it blinked white, it meant that someone was trying to contact him on the intercom. When it was blue, it meant someone was at the door either waiting to come in, or already on their way through it. When it blinked red, it meant that his heart rate was elevated and that Peter needed to calm down. The lights worked so well, Peter was visibly relaxed. These lights were only installed in his room though, so that's where he began spending the most time.
Peter didn't quite enjoy being spoken about as if he weren't standing there and while he momentarily forgot that the two people before him were the King and Princess of Wakanda, he made sure to let them know it.
When he was home, he spent a lot of time in Peter's bedroom. Mostly he was just dusting and keeping everything tidy and in working order while the boy was away. He did the same for the apartment he shared with Steve, training Rebecca in the process. The pup followed Bucky's every move and was also in the middle of training to be a support animal. Nobody batted an eye when the man with the metal arm came in with his small dog in arms, quietly asking how much it would cost to have her trained the way he needed.
also, spoiler, if my writing doesn't make it clear, I don't practice and I've never been in confession, so I apologize if I get everything wrong, I hope I don't butcher it too bad and offend anyone.
This man was risking his... Life? To make sure that he was going to get out safely, and if they did make it out of here, he would owe this man his life... However much longer it may last.
Steve laughed and stood up straighter. "I can't promise it'll go over the best with Tony, but I asked him to be civil... Everyone inside has someone, I figure it's only fair for you to have your someone too."
Wade took the time that Peter was breathless and unfocused to pull out and clean them both up a little bit before letting Peter have a nap.
Peter carried the dark hair and dark eyes and sarcasm that Bucky had, all while sporting the strong-headedness and sharp wit that Steve brought to the table. Somehow this child born over 50 years after they last saw the sun as regular human beings was almost the perfect blend of the two of them. And Bucky wasn't about to let that go because Tony Stark had an insatiable need to control everything and everyone around him. "The way I see it Stark, you got two options right now. You can turn 'round and let us do what needs done, or you can, as they say, suck a fat one."
He remembered when he'd found his phone for the first time, tucked beneath the pillows on his bed. He remembers scrolling through the thousands of notifications from things like Twitter and Snapchat and all the tons of text messages from people whose faces he didn't even remember anymore. He remembers looking through his Snapchat memories, seeing all of the photos he'd taken of his friends and all the places he'd been.
And right now, he's pleased to tidy up the barely-there mess in his bedroom so that he can have Wade over. He hasn't seen the mercenary in far too long, and after the near-death and actual death experiences they sorta shared, Peter thought it was wrong not to hang out.
Peter looked to the door as Tony pushed it open and his jaw nearly dropped to the floor. He walked inside and was met with warm air and a whole new apartment that he could call his own. The space was open but closed off enough for his privacy. The sleek furniture and wood flooring appealed to all of his aesthetics, and there were empty pots for him to grow plants in if he wanted. He could see the light bar from the compound had been installed around the whole apartment, and he could see the huge computer taking up the whole desk across the apartment.
The sobs leaving his lips were uncontrollable, bordering on hysterics, as Bucky ran into the room. Friday had seemed oddly panicked for an AI as she alerted them to Peter's heart rate and general unresponsiveness. Steve didn't think he'd ever seen Bucky clear two floors that quickly. He skidded to a stop and knelt next to Peter on his bed.
He shook his head but when he looked down he saw the knife in his hands and he sobbed. He knew it was true, that he deserved it. He deserved to pay for what he'd done. He deserved to die for killing her, to suffer for the way that she suffered at his hands. But killing himself wouldn't bring him any suffrage, he had to make it hurt first. He had to hurt, he had to hurt...
. He missed being with Steve like this... Sitting here across from the gorgeous blonde, all Tony wanted to do was lean over and kiss him right on his beautiful lips.
Steve nodded like he knew what was going on, but he didn't know in the slightest. "I still have no idea what that means for us."
He cried out more, sobbing and whimpering and shaking violently as he came for a third time, leg giving out as the pleasure began to catch up to him. It felt so goddamn good but it was starting to hurt, but Wade still kept going. Wade came a second time and finally let Peter's other leg down, his burned hands being the only thing keeping Peter up. After a second of thought, he decided to let Peter fall down onto his knees. He let the boy fall forward onto the dirt, shoulders and face against the ground as he continued to fuck into him.
There's no noise other than the birds and the wind and the sound of Bucky's boots in the grass. And it's peaceful. It's probably the nicest moment Peter's had in months, no, he knows it is just by the way Peter looks at everything. The way that he smiles when the flowers brush against his legs or when the breeze pushes his hair back or the birds chirp over his head.
Rumlow pulled his hand away from the boy's ass, only to grab him around the waist and lift him from the tub. Peter wiggled in the man's grasp but earned a harsh slap on the ass. He decided to just hold still and take whatever was going to happen. If it would be his ticket out of here, it didn't really matter.
He dug his phone out of his pocket and tried to hide the panic in his voice as he called Wade. Wade didn't answer, but he called again. This time he did answer, but all Peter could hear on the other end was gunshots and screaming.
He came up to her door and had finally had enough of being nice and calm. He knocked, or rather, banged on the door. "May! Hey May, it's me, it's Peter! Open up will you?"
That being said, as soon as the three of them walked into the makeup store, Tony pulled one of 15 credit cards from his wallet and handed it to Peter, saying nothing more than "I'm just happy to learn."
"So, what? Am- Am I pregnant? Is that what you're saying?" Peter felt his heart drop. Kids were always something that he wanted in his life, and this could certainly be considered a gift in a way, but what would it mean for him? That he was pregnant with Wade's child? He and Wade weren't even a couple of any kind, they weren't stable enough for a family yet, even if they were a couple. But to be pregnant so early in his life? To be pregnant at all? Peter knew the impossibility of it all, but if Wade was telling the truth, then he could be pregnant.
When he looked up, Wanda was with him, and she looked worried as all hell. He assured her that he was fine, but now he was just tired and he was sorry for calling her all the way down here for nothing. She doesn't believe him, but doesn't press, instead insisting that he could call whenever he needed, even if it really was nothing, and she would be there.
And poor Peter, more confused now than before, took the paper and unfolded it... And he just stared, with and empty, blank face and heart. He couldn't comprehend exactly what he was looking at, though he could see it clear as day.
The pain was too much for him, and he let his eyes droop shut, silently praying for someone to save him, even though he knew that they'd never come.
On his desk lie a smart-watch with a scratch on the screen and an old looking mp3 player. He touches them gently, afraid that they're just a memory and aren't really there, but his fingers connect and they're real and he remembers them and he knows what they are and what they meant to him. "These are mine... The watch... Shakes?"
Peter pressed down where his fingers met with the back of Wade's neck and nodded, though he couldn't be seen. "Please...Wade, I wanna forget."
Nat says that torturing the man won't bring May back, and he tells her that he knows that. "I'm not going to torture him. I'm going to kill him."
Bucky passed his gun to Nat and reached out to the boy, letting his small fingers grab onto his metal arm and latch onto his vest. The boy felt much too small in his arms, and he was afraid to hold him too tightly lest he injure the boy farther.
There was no hiding it one day when he came home with a busted lip and blackened eye. He hid the black eye with sunglasses, hungover Tony style. In order to get to his room, he had to get past all four parents though, which obviously didn't work.
Even though he knew that he was safe here with Wade and that he'd never be judged for how he looked, he was still very insecure and started wondering if he could keep most of his clothes on.
this baby in the first place. That's really what he's been debating all of this time instead of sleeping.
Wade and Ned shared a look, and then he was following Peter out of the building. Peter and Wade both knew that Peter's 'parents' would be having words with them later, and in Wade's case, maybe a few bullets.
Wade nodded, telling him that she refused to leave until he was better. He just nodded and looked back to the bath water. Wade didn't try and say anything more, nor did he try and make him talk anymore. He just carefully helped him wash up, then wrapped him in the warm towels he pulled from the dryer. He let the clothes keep running so they'd stay warm for a while as he helped Peter dry off. He asked him what he wanted to eat, and Peter said he'd be okay with something quick because he just wanted to crawl into bed and be comfortable.
From around the corner, a clean-shaven Rumlow appeared. "There was an apartment to the left of you. Just kinda dragged you through it."
Peter felt his heart drop impossibly lower. Tony laid no claim to him as a child, this he already suspected. But to hear it out loud was another matter all on its own. In his already weakened state, his spirit was being crushed and torn apart by one of the few people he trusted to keep him safe... Maybe there was no such thing as safe anymore...
He fell, colliding with the collapsing marble, and when he looked up all he could see was Peter still trying to swing his knife on Bruce and Wade being knocked to the floor by the force of the quaking around them. Bucky rolled onto his back and his eyes widened as he saw a large portion of the ceiling falling towards him. He rolled as quickly as he could but his screams ripped through the sound of the crumbling building as his metal arm was crushed beneath the heavy rubble.
Tony knew that Steve was right, just like he usually was. With a sigh, he left the medical bay to go and find where Peter had run off too. "Friday, locate Spider-Boy for me will you?"
It became natural for Bucky to roam the halls at night, and he frequently stopped by Peter's room. He'd asked Vision to alert him when Peter was having a nightmare and even went so far as to have Friday
Steve agreed, then asked Bucky'd been to sleep yet. He said no, and Steve suggested he get some rest too. Bucky, being the genius he is, suggested they FaceTime to sleep. He was sure Peter would be okay for a couple of hours.
Wade woke to Peter shifting in the bed. He looked down at Peter's outline and saw him shaking in his sleep. When he heard Peter's broken sob and call for help, he didn't hesitate to pull the little arachnid to his chest.
Peter hesitates before answering. "They... They beat me up in the bathroom today... Still hurts. I'm not... I'm not healing right, I don't know what's wrong."
It was the first night in a long time that Steve slept without Bucky. Steve remembered waking up in the morning alone in bed like he'd been the night before. He remembered the dread filling his veins like ice water as he wondered if last night was the last time he'd ever see the man that he loved. He wanted to run to the platform as quick as his short lungs and shitty legs could take him and kiss Bucky for what might be the last time, but he knew he couldn't. He'd get them both killed, but some part of him thought it might be worth it if Bucky didn't have to go to war, and they could die together.
Excruciating as it were, he found it pointless to fight. Which is a first for Wade because, if caught off guard, he'd fight his own reflection.
The only answer that he got was from the birds. His breathing picked up as he went back inside. He remembered that Wade put his number into Peter's phone, but when he called it, Wade's shitty flip phone rang in the other room instead.
"Did you kill them?!" Peter threw Wade up against the nearest wall and Wade put his hands up in defense.
Bucky did a glance to Steve, who just looked soft, and Nat, who looked somewhat fond. He looked back to Peter, who looked a little bit calmer now.
Nat hangs up her coat and puts her keys down on the table before smiling. "Peter asked me to take him to church. I thought it might be good for him, too."
Bruce looked frustrated and Bucky wanted nothing more than to kill Bruce where he stood. But he wouldn't. Bruce was Steve's friend, and he wouldn't be any kind of opposed to letting Peter get his answers. He deserved them after all, and Bruce wasn't trying to run.
Peter's yelling quickly turned into heavy breathing and near sobs before Bucky could even tell him if that was the truth or not. Peter almost didn't want to hear it.
Wade pulled his mask back down and sighed. "They injected you with a type of serum... That's the blood anomaly that Wizard dude found in you. It only altered you a little, from what I can gather..."
Peter was only a kid, a little on the young side, and much too good for Wade. He was better than what Wade would ever be holy enough to deserve. Wade didn't deserve the privilege of touching Peter, of being near him. But goddamn he wished he was.
Wade bottomed out finally and leaned back against the wall, hips pushed out towards Peter. He nudged Peter's hips forward before pulling them back against his own again. He only needed to guide Peter for a moment of time before Peter was moving on his own, fucking himself back against Wade's fully-hardened cock, each thrust punching a moan out of his throat.
Peter spent his nights awake and opted for only napping a half an hour at a time during the day. He'd consumed more coffee in a month than Tony ever would in a year. Aunt May called a few times but always hung up after a while. Peter understood, he knew she had things to do. He didn't know what things, but he figured they were important if she was hanging up on him to go do them.
On the bed he just rolled off of, he saw a healthy looking Aunt May, though by now he knew to just ignore her. He knew that he probably just had some kind of head injury, probably nothing more than a concussion. He'd be fine, eventually.
More of the Senior Agents saw the man first and were terrified... Not because of an intruder, or their impending deaths... They were afraid because this was their Soldier, their
He wasn't looking, but they all knew that he wouldn't miss if he pulled the trigger. "Peter? Peter are you alright?"
But then he remembered what the priest had said, about him having no real sins to confess... How someone forced him to kill May and it wasn't his fault... But it was, wasn't it? They were his hands that cut her, hurt her, pulled her apart and then some. How could it not be his fault? How could he not deserve this?
So unfazed that as of right now as they were making out, Peter was grinding his thin little hips down against Wade's. Wade had an arm wrapped around Peter, and the other hand on the boy's ass, rubbing and squeezing it as he pleased. Wade would be lying if he said the sounds Peter were making didn't make him want to have Peter right here on his new bed because they did. Peter himself didn't seem to opposed based on the way he was trying to get Wade out of his sweater.
So Peter grabbed the next instrument he was meant to grab, a small scalpel in his left hand, and sat back down on the man's lap as he was told. He purposefully pushed his ass against Rumlow's hardening cock with a smirk.
Steve sat down and said nothing as Bucky put his head down into his lap. Today was a close one, he knew. Bucky almost slipped and killed Stark, and they couldn't have that. That'd put Bucky away again, and Steve wasn't about to let Bucky be taken away from him again. Especially not after the last time. He never thought he'd see Bucky again after the fall... That's why he didn't have any problems going into the ice. It would save a lot of people, and he already didn't have anything to lose at that point.
Steve frowned and walked around the bed to pull the blankets away from Peter's face and tuck them beneath his drool-covered chin and he chuckled at the sight of this young boy asleep in their bed. And he reminded him of the innocence that these two boys both once held inside of them. He saw the boys unruly hair sprawled across his forehead and took a moment to brush it back. In his sleep, he looked so peaceful... It hurt Steve to think of the chaos he may feel once he wakes. So he backed away to give Peter the space to sleep in the burrito of blankets that he'd made for himself.
Peter roams the halls one night after a nightmare and finds himself turning to the strangest person for help.
alert him, but only when he was in a room alone. He didn't want to let the cat out of the bag and risk Peter being upset that other people knew.
The whole base was on high-alert while Peter was missing. Every single one of those S.H.I.E.L.D. agents bustling about in the hallways knew just how protective the Supers were of the young boy. Peter, being the youngest of them all, was special. He was meant to be protected at all costs.
Even from up on the 5th floor, Peter could see Wade exhale a big cloud of smoke from his cigarette as he laughed and waited for Peter's reply. Peter just nodded, because he knew that Wade could see him. "Yeah, that sounds good... I can't wait for you to see what I-"
She threw her head back and laughed. "Steve would never tell you anything. He may be blonde, but he's smarter than you bother to give him credit for."
Rumlow was interested in this boy before him. Not because he gave a damn about the kid, but because he'd been under Captain America's wings for so long he turned goody-two-shoes. Well, he wanted to see the Captain suffer, and what better way to accomplish that than to torture the boy he claimed as his own?
So why was he sitting here, in the boy's room, doing nothing? He was hoping that being here would give him some answers. Some kind of insight into what was happening. He was hoping that the silence would clear his mind, but so far it wasn't happening. If anything, the silence was making everything worse.
Peter shook his head and put the photo down. "No. I'm gonna do this myself. I need space. I can't be near Wade right now, I just wanna do this on my own for a while. We're not together, I'm not obligated to call him or include him in anything like this. He's not the father, it's not his business."
The call ended and she looked at Peter's phone screen for a second before putting a password lock on it and tucking it into her pocket so Peter wouldn't be tempted to do anything stupid with it, and then she let him sit back down on the ground before sitting with him.
And when they fought, Bruce got angry and the big guy almost got loose, but Tony didn't care. He kept fighting and arguing and eventually, he broke up with Bruce, and almost physically threw him out of the lab.
Peter covered his mouth to try and swallow the urge to vomit as he took in the sight of the corpse before him. She was absolutely covered in blood and cuts and bullets and the hole in her chest revealed her missing ribs... missing
She turned her full body towards him. "You had better mean that, or so help me, God, I WILL find you and I WILL make you regret it."
"A hospital in Italy. The straps were for the doctors. You guys swing like motherfuckers in your sleep."
He was soundless as he crawled up the wall and onto the ceiling to make his retreat down the hall. He opened the stairwell door and finally let himself land on the floor.
On Bucky's next lift and preparation to stab, Steve grabbed onto his arm. "Bucky! Bucky, look, he's dead! Stop, look! "
Steve looked shocked, and Bucky's jaw was set, and with the way Natasha was staring, almost emotionless, Peter was sure that he was in for a world of hurt. She reached up to touch his face but he flinched away from her fingertips. That one small action clued in everyone in the room just how bad all these kids really were to Peter.
Peter didn't want to get his hopes up and admit that he felt anything for Wade Wilson. He didn't want to admit to the spark that he felt when they were cuddled together, or the hammering in his chest when they kissed. He didn't want to admit to his sweaty palms when Wade smiled at him. This was stupid.
Standing on the road, the three looked up at the old building. Natasha seemed ready to see the place that her boys used to live, but Steve and Bucky were glued to the ground they stood on. It's been such a long time since they've seen this place.
Bucky strolls right up to the stove and starts making breakfast for his Spiders, which consists of eggs and French toast. That's one thing Bucky can say about the future, is that there are a lot more ways to cook the same five things. Back in the day they just boiled everything and hoped to God it turned out okay.
Wade pulled Peter towards him until Peter was straddling him. Peter dug his nails into Wade's chest as he worked himself down on Wade's length. Wade held onto Peter's hips before wrapping his arms around his back and holding the boy down to his chest. Peter gripped onto Wade's shoulders as Wade took control of the situation.
When Peter woke, the lights were blinding. The pain in his side had dimmed, but the pain in his head only increased the longer he looked at the adults standing over him.
"Listen, Parker. If you shut up and let me touch you, you can have a third reward of my choosing. Maybe a warm bed? Shoes?"
It was deafening, and heavy, weighing on him like an elephant on his chest. And it hurt. And he longed for the child that filled this space. The child that filled part of the emptiness inside of him. He knew that this child could never fully fill the space of two, but with one at least it would hurt less.
A car pulled up next to his bike and he quickly aimed the gun at it. Steve emerged from inside, hands raised. Bucky lowered his weapon and held up the watch.
They know that adopting him won't keep him all the way out of the spotlight, but it would help. If he wasn't a hero, the camera wouldn't be on him so much. The most media attention he might get would be from people wondering what it was like being the son of Captain America and Black Widow, or the son of The Winter Soldier. All of his attention wouldn't be about him at all, but about them.
So when Steve came into the picture, he was the only one allowed to do the talking because he knew what to omit from the media and how to keep the situation under control. But lately, he was lacking. he was losing patience with the media and everything they stood for. He hated what was going on in their country, but there was nothing he could do about it.
He let his eyes travel down his chest and to his side, where the wound was. He let out a long breath that hurt him so badly he whimpered. Finally alone, he could let out all the pained noises he'd been keeping in.
He ran back to the door, but on the other side was no longer the apartment building, but the long hallway outside of his room at the Avenger's base. He ran towards what Tony called the Party Room.
Steve had reverted back into Captain America. The burden of the stripes followed him everywhere he went, from the conference rooms to the bathroom. He wasn't Steve anymore, not really. Peter had been taken from him, he and Bucky haven't gotten a single chance to think about planning their wedding and Nat's been so buried in the work she doesn't even come home anymore. The weight of being the Captain, the leader, the soldier... It was taking a toll on whatever emotional strength Steve still had inside of him.
Wade wasted no time in undoing Peter's jeans and pushing them down to his ankles. He took even less time in turning Peter around and bending him over until Peter was taking up most of the space in the alleyway that they occupied, sweaty back to clothed chest.
It didn't take Mr. Stark long to see him, and when he did it looked like a weight had been lifted off of him. He'd called Aunt May's apartment and she'd told Tony that Peter was alright. He didn't seem to believe it until Peter showed up though.
He knew how to throw his weight around, and when his body collided with the other kid's, they went straight to the floor.
Wade rushed to Peter's side and took his hand. "Oh no baby, I would never let anything like that happen to you... No... But I wasn't fast enough to keep them from spiking your drink. they gave you a drug that would basically make sure that you wouldn't remember... Not their faces, not talking to them, nothing. Your friend MJ stayed over. She and another girl helped me take care of you, and that other girl is gonna help me take care of the guys who did this to you."
He only knew so much though, because Peter only knew so much. So far, Peter had managed to sneak them down two hallways and into the room where Rumlow would keep him every day.
Peter smirked a little bit before sliding down onto the floor in between Wade's legs. Peter looked up through his lashes as he grabbed ever so gently onto Wade's thigh. His hand was dangerously close to a place that could no longer be classified as thigh anymore.
Everyone was a mess, wondering what'd become of their boy. If he was even alive... That was the one thought nobody wanted to discuss out loud. An idea none of them were willing to entertain.
When Wade turned around, the barrel of a gun was in his face. He felt Peter grip tighter onto him in fear, but before he could get a single word out, the trigger was pulled. Peter screamed as chunks of brain and blood splattered back and covered his face. Wade's body fell, crumbling to the floor with a sickening whump.
And on the topic of Wade coming, Tony was the only one phased. Which, was weird. Even after Wade tried to kill them, they seemed so content when he was around. Almost like he wasn't any kind of problem, to begin with. Almost like the fight never happened... But it did, didn't it? Their wounds, those were real, right? There's no way all of them would fake something like that... Right?
Said Red sonuvabitch wasn't exactly hiding very well, especially after having come around to drop Peter off.
Peter always had the option to pretend that this man wasn't just asking him to slice himself open for amusement, but he didn't see the point. He didn't know anyone outside of here other than the metal-armed man from inside his head. For some reason, it felt wrong even think about imagining the metal-armed man in his position.
For fuck's sake, the baby's father was a murderer, a kidnapper, a rapist, and a fucking Hydra agent... But if he put the child up for adoption and Hydra came after them... The baby wouldn't be nearly as protected. Keeping it seemed to be the best option, despite all of Peter's other thoughts about the situation. But he didn't want this, he knew that. Everyone knew that. He said he'd keep it but how could he?
Steve leaned against the wall next to Bucky's chair. "I guess we'll see how he feels in the morning."
The door opened, and as the person walking around made noise on one side of the lab, Peter made his way around the other side. Whoever came in left the door wide open, which made it so much easier for Peter to escape.
. From what he could gather, the first of the threads was nothing but theories about what happened to the Queens-dwelling hero, and the second was started by his friend as a way of spreading the word that he was missing. Any sightings or information were meant to be tweeted with the hashtag to help the Avengers and authorities to find him. It was a short thread.
When Nat opened her eyes, her pulse quickened in fear. She was alone and tied to a chair. It wouldn't stop her, but the scary part was the fact that she'd never been kidnapped without her allowing her captors to catch her. This time... Rumlow was fast, and he hit so fucking hard there was no way to stop him.
She crawls onto the bed and sits with her back against the wall, which allows Peter to put his head in her lap. "What do you see, маленький паук?"
His light bar was flashing a different color now, but through the haze of his own mind he couldn't figure out what it meant for the life of him. He figured it out when the door opened to reveal a panicked looking Tony Stark.
Everyone makes their way out of the car and Steve pulls Peter's wheelchair from the trunk, carefully setting it up before opening his door. Peter takes the man's hands and accepts his help in getting out of the car and into his chair. Wanda offered to push Peter up the new ramp that Steve and Sam built for him so he could access each floor of the building.
"Oh, Peter... What happened to you? Come, sit back down." She says, and her accent is coming through and it's
Now the only people he knew were the Hydra agents tasked with keeping him here, the unnamed Doctor, the undead man with the burnt face, and the faceless man with the metal arm that he tended to hallucinate.
All he could do was cower, but how far back can you lean from the things that are inside of you? How do you escape? How do you escape your own mind? The twisted May in front of him just laughed.
He grabbed onto the doorway to the bedroom and in the kitchen was Nat, making tea. She spotted him and stopped everything to walk over to him. She could see the distress on his face. It didn't take a genius to see that he was scared. Of what she didn't know yet. When she last checked a few minutes ago, Peter had been peacefully asleep, just like he'd been when Steve called this morning, and when she showed up, and when Steve and Bucky took off this morning to hit the shops.
After leaving the makeup store, Pepper made sure to remind Tony that she needed to stop at one of the nearby outlet stores. Tony asks why they'd go to an outlet store when he's a billionaire and she laughs, reminding him that not everyone is a billionaire. He laughs and accepts by handing his card back to Peter and tells him he can buy whatever he wants. Peter asks if it'd be okay to buy some new clothes.
Peter shook his head. He couldn't believe his ears. "Mr. Banner... I trusted you. I believed in you!"
"If not now, then when, Tony? Because I truly am getting tired of not knowing what this is. I'm tired, Tony." Bruce rubbed his forehead with the sleeve of his sweater. "I don't even know why you keep me around sometimes. Is it really because you feel something for me, or am I charity case to you? A-A tool to make Steve want you back?"
On the other side of the world was Bucky, waltzing around with a smirk, acting like he owned the place because let's face it- he does. He tosses open the door to the apartment and finds Steve there, reading a book. The first thing he does is pull Steve off of the couch and into a breath-stealing kiss. He didn't miss the way Steve clung to him. How Steve tightly gripped the fabric of his shirt between his fingers, how he tried to desperately pull him closer although there was already no space between them.
Maybe it could be a bit annoying for Peter, but at least he wouldn't be having near-death experiences every day like they did and
"Bucky is with Peter. Let him worry about that for now. Worry about what you can do right now. Bruce, and Rumlow. Those are your options."
Peter was dead asleep, curled up in the smallest ball he could manage to contort himself into. One of his earbuds fell out, so Bucky carefully replaced it. He knew that Peter couldn't sleep without some kind of noise, and Bucky didn't make enough noise on his own to replace Peter's music in the slightest.
Spending a summer in upstate New York at the Avengers base was easy. He got to spend time with people who had no problem looking after him and were able to keep his abilities and nightmares in check.
Even once he let go, Wade didn't move away from Peter. He didn't stop being concerned. "That was a flashback, wasn't it?"
His gaze was as cold as the air outside but his heart was colder. On his hands, blood. He remembered scrubbing them until they just bled more. He kept circling back to that picture that night, staring at the other man. His blue eyes awoken something inside of his chest, a flourish he didn't remember feeling before. It hurt, but it felt beautiful, a strong bonding like love that he couldn't believe he'd ever forgotten, and a name that he held to like his closest secret.
blenders and cleanser, a sharpener, two different kinds of nail strengtheners and coconut cuticle oil, tea tree shampoo, dry shampoo and no frizz nourishing oil, razor bump and ingrown hair solution, herbal body moisturizer,
"I just..." He fiddled with his blanket. "I wanna come home... It's kind of a bummer living here... Everything's so far away..."
Steve leaned forward slightly as Nat took his length into her mouth. Bucky slid his metal fingers into Nat's fiery red hair and slid his other hand up Steve's chest, effectively holding the three of them together. Nat reached behind Steve and tugged Bucky's sweats down just enough to expose him as well. Steve's moan of ecstasy when Bucky pushed into him effectively managed to turn them all on even farther.
The small puppy looked up at him with the utmost love in its eyes, and he smiled through his tears... This tiny thing was missing one of its front legs, and he was quick to understand. He knew that the others were looking for some kind of way to make him feel better about his arm, especially on the days where he just wished he could take it off and set it somewhere so he didn't have to be stuck with it. Technically, it was a prosthetic, and missing his arm was considered a disability... And even after all of this time, he'd never really come to terms with it, though how could he? He was never given the chance.
Steve jerked back to himself as Tony flashed that beautiful smile at their waiter with his usual aplomb.  “Sorry.  I was just woolgathering.”
As for Stephanos, Knight of the Star, he stood always at the King’s right hand as counselor, general, and beloved sweet friend, refusing to claim the throne the people might have offered him. “I am a Captain, nothing more, and certes am content with my lot,” he said whenever asked why he did not retake what had been his in former times. “Antonius was raised to rule, and it is not my place to force him from the role God had decreed for him.”
The couple looked at each other, then at Steve.  The man’s face softened, and he nodded to his wife, who reached into her purse.  “I was in Desert Storm.  I know what you mean.  Here, I can wait, you take my ticket, I’ll go get a cup of coffee – “
“Isn’t that what you call ‘hitting on someone’ these days?  Or is there some other term I haven’t learned yet?”
“Yeah, ice skating.  Sounds perfect for a capsicle like me,” he said, and tried to tell himself that Tony didn’t look bewildered for a second or two.  “Didn’t you say something about the next life lesson?”
“Sheathe thy sword, good Stephanos, and I shall tell thee all,” Antonius then said, rising as Stephanos, wondering, did as he was bade. “I am Antonius, son of Huard, and I tell thee truly that long years have passed since thy last battle, and wrought much change in Graymarie and in the world. Come with me now to the chambers of the Lady Carola de Danverius, Abbess of Our Lady of Liberty, if thou wouldst know the truth.”
Then the King did rise from his throne, his armor of adamant glittering gold in the ruddy noontime sun, and draw his great sword upon the former Bishop. “Get thee gone, false adviser! Thy words bring nothing but ill to my line and my people. Ships lie in the harbor to take thee and thy men to Rome, there to spend thy days in prayer and solitude.”
Great was the woe of the populace when the Queen’s handmaiden, Ginevra il Rosso di Pentola, galloped to the capitol upon a horse half-dead with the awful news that King and Queen had both fallen to the Dragon’s fury. Bishop Obadiah, grim of mien and facile of tongue, counseled the people not to take arms against the Dragon, but rather to seek shelter in the great church of Our Lady of Liberty and beg the Mother of God for mercy against the coming peril.
Thus it was that one night the King did make his way into the crypt of Our Lady of Liberty, where he had been wont to seek refuge from his father's angry words and his mother's bitter tears. All was as it had been, or so it seemed at first: the perpetual lights, the smell of sweet incense from the censors, the side chapels and chantries and frescoes laying out the history of the land and the blessings of God thereupon.
“They got the Cloisters?  I – I used to sketch there when I was in school, while they were building it.  They didn’t care how long I stayed.”  He reached down as if he could touch a crumbling parapet.  “Half my portfolio was drawings of the stonework.  Oh God – “
Ioannes bared his teeth at these brave words, and would have drawn his sword had not the Master of Men laid a hand on his bridle and spoken up in his stead. “Bold words are these from one so young, but words will not avail thee, young King. For know that Ioannes is descended from Arminius, the Switzer whom thy forbears slew at the Isle of Conies, and will take what ill luck and the accursed Captain of the Star denied him. The world is for the strong, and it is past time that thou learned this, even as thy Captain did in ages past.”
“That’s because you don’t use oven mitts like a normal person,” said Clint in a surprisingly reasonable tone.  “See these?  Nice and insulated, only $5 at the dollar store so you can buy a set for every day of the week.”
“Not a bad idea,” said Steve.  Pointing out that Thor was actually from another planet, not really a god, was likely a bad idea.  “I guess it’s lonely out here.”
Then spoke up one of his younger knights. This man, Stephanos, called the Knight of the Star for the device upon his shield, had but lately come to Camelot from Eboracum, yet had he won great renown fighting the captains of Greater Germany in service to the dread Emperor of Rome, Lucius Artorius, kin to Arthur himself. His hair was golden as ripe wheat in the summer sun, his eyes bluer than the sea, and overall so tall and well-knit was this noble knight that none handsomer nor stronger could be found throughout the realm. Generous was he to the poor, and kind to the ladies, and had he come to Arthur's lands but a few years earlier he would have been proclaimed the noblest and most courteous of all those who sat at the Table Round.
“Sounds like they’re busy.”  Steve straightened his shoulders as the elevator opened onto the Tower’s pedestrian concourse.  Would any of them even notice he was gone?
“Yessir,” said the waiter.  He scribbled something down, shoved their menus under his arm, and stumped off toward the kitchen.  Steve waited until he was out of earshot to speak.
Also had he seen how the King loved his people, and how their courage had been restored as they worked together to prepare for war. Antonius might not be Gaius nor Gabriel nor any of his former companions, but he was a worthy and goodhearted man, generous to the poor and pious of heart. It was easy to see why all loved him, and soon Stephanos counted himself among that number.
“Speak the truth, false priest, and sap our strength no more!” spake the good Ginevra, and all those assembled took up the call.
Once Antonius had brought Stephanos to the Abbess, he sent for meat and drink to be consumed privily in her cell, for the Abbess Carola deemed it wise to conceal the Captain’s return until the hour of battle. “For the Captain has been gone for many reigns of kings, and much has changed,” said the noble lady to the king. “It is best that he learns of our ways and history before he fights against so deadly a foe as this Ioannes, who will seek out any weakness and turn it against him, though he be ever so high of heart and strong of arm.”
As for Stephanos, until the day came when he was to come to court as Stellarius, he learned much and said little. His mood lifted, at least a little, but still he could not but ask why it was that he had been brought back from his long sleep. “For Graymarie has a king, and a noble one at that. There is no need of a mere captain, especially one who has been absent so long from the waking world. Why has it pleased God to restore my life?”
There was a muffled sound from the door, almost as if someone were knocking and calling his name.  Steve shook his head and pressed his face into the smooth, fine sheets that smelled faintly of lavender.  It was close enough to the sachets Mrs. Barnes had tucked into her linen closet that he almost recoiled, but having to deal with whomever had decided to visit would be worse.
“Good evening, Captain Rogers,” came JARVIS’ cultured tones, and Steve had to remind himself not to look at the ceiling.  “How may I assist you?”
yet, no wonder you’re bewildered,” Tony said.  He rolled his eyes and pointed at the sky.  “Sloppy, guys.  Very sloppy.  Next time do
“So it does,” said JARVIS.  “Might I suggest a topcoat tonight rather than your motorcycle leathers?  The current temperature is 35 degrees, with lows expected in the high 20’s.  I realize that the cathedral is only a few blocks from the Tower, but it is still far enough that you might welcome the extra warmth.”
“Black coffee for me,” said Steve.  A Caesar salad sounded good, especially since the menu boasted that the dressing was made from responsibly farmed fish and cage-free eggs from organic farms in Dutchess County, but he wanted to leave room for dessert.  “And a large glass of water.”
Steve rubbed at his shoulder.  He'd been planning to head to St. Brigit's, not St. Patrick’s, but even on the subway it would be chilly.  “That’s a good idea, JARVIS.  Thanks.”
“Yeah?  That’s what you think?” Steve yelled.  The shout echoed off the subway walls, and it took a moment for him to realize they were back in the tunnel.  “Then why’d you tell Clint I was better off in the ice?”
“Remember what I said about not being soldiers?”  Tony shook his head.  “None of us, not even Thor, thought about frying the Chitauri while they were still
“Cocoa.”  Tony’s hands were warm even through his elegant leather gloves.  Steve, shivering now, breathed deep of the rich scent of chocolate and sugar and milk before taking his first sip.  “Clint made it because he felt guilty about Lucky the Chaos Hound wrecking the kitchen and I thought you might like some.  It’s not bad.”
…the cleansing of the land was overdue, for the false priest had installed his creatures in parishes across Graymarie. Long did the Abbess, Lady Carola, and the nuns and priests that answered to her, labor to root out the evil that the people might be fit to defend the land without fear of betrayal from within.
“As thou wish it, Sire,” said the lady, and bade the King repair to his own quarters for the nonce. Then she summoned her most trusted nuns, vowed to service, and had them fetch great tomes of history and natural science, also the rolls of the kings and queens, that she might instruct Stephanos in all that had passed him by as he lay beneath her abbey.
Antonius had resolved to spend the whole night in prayer, even as the did nuns in the funeral chantries above keep watch in silence over the graves of the heroes. Yet he was a mortal man, prone to the weakness of mortal flesh, and unused to long hours in silent contemplation. So it was that eventually he did fall asleep, head bowed over his hands clasped upon the rail of the prie-dieu, and there slept without dreaming through the long watches of the night.
” came an angry shout from across the dining room, and both Avengers automatically swiveled in place to see what was going on.
Stephanos listened to her teachings, sometimes nodding, sometimes questioning her words. At length he requested a confessor, as he had not been shriven since before the battle against Arminius, and a young novice was sent to fetch Father Edwin, the King’s own confessor, for his discretion was beyond all reproach.
“Just give me the damn branch!” Steve snarled, and grabbed it near the tip.  The hard, glossy leaves shivered, the ozone smell of the tunnel spiked, and there was a sudden flash of darkness -
Scarce had the disguised Stephanos arrived at court but Antonius set him to work drilling the army and setting the fortifications to right, for he swiftly learned of the new machines of siegecraft and devised ways to counter them. Rarely did the this noble knight smile as he went about his tasks, but soon the forces of Graymarie were as good as ever they had been, bold and keen and skilled in all the noble arts of war. Soon he pronounced them ready to face all comers, even after the King’s spymistress, Lily Charretiere, brought news of the foul weapons Ioannes Caput Rufus had devised to bring about Graymarie’s doom. For in addition to siege engines and great ballistas, Ioannes had drawn upon the dark arts to transform a peasant lad into a knight of tremendous strength and cruelty.
Tony resisted the urge to call him on the “dear” and bowed respectfully before leading the way into the tastefully decorated dining room.  “My humble thanks, Gaston.”  He snapped his fingers at the waiter, who looked like he might have been able to bench press Steve himself if not necessarily his motorcycle.
“Steve.  Listen to me.”  Tony gave him a tiny shake.  “The Avengers work because of you.  That’s the truth.  I may be the brains and Thor’s the brawn, but without you leading the way, we’re not half as good at anything, including saving the world.”  He paused.
“Clint – wait, wait.”  Tony held up both hands, palms out.  The frond and the saffron robe were gone, replaced by a worn MIT sweatshirt and a pair of jeans with the right knee torn out.  “Is that what this is all about?  What you think you heard?”
I heard anything.  I was standing right outside the kitchen door.”  Steve threw the long end of his toga over his shoulder.  The touch of the soft white wool eased the dull, itchy throb that matched the beat of his heart.  “You said I was better off in the ice.  Just like you did on the helicarrier.”
The crowd had thinned out enough by the time he reached the great statue of Atlas on Fifth that he could actually see the doors to the cathedral across the street.  They were shut, of course, and if he concentrated he could just make out the roar of the great organ as the choir began processing down the center aisle.  The service would in English, not Latin, but if he closed his eyes he could see it so clearly, the singers in their white cassocks and purple robes, the bishops and priests and the Cardinal in their glittering vestments, candles and music and warmth and light –
“I am King by birth and blood, and by my deeds shall prove myself also worthy in the old way,” he declared, and so noble was his countenance and so determined his words that none dared gainsay him.
She started with explaining how she Bucky and Steve have been looking for a place to live off base because thet honestly can't stand the seclusion either. She told him that they knew he didn't want to live on base anymore either. Then she saw his eyes light up as she told him they'd found a place, and they'd love for him to live with them. He got so excited before stopping and asking about Tony.
Unless there was some real divine intervention, there was no way in hell that this wasn't all part of God's brilliant plan. Right now Peter didn't give a shit what the man upstairs wanted, and he wouldn't ask to be forgiven for this, because this was not a sin. Wiping this human shit-stain off of the Earth was his civic duty and he would not pretend to be sorry. He was about to do God a favor in sending that bastard down to Hell early. God could thank him later.
Maybe, he thinks, Bruce had been listening to him the whole time, relaying the information to Tony. Maybe he was helping him change and somewhere the line got... Muddled.
Surrounding those trucks? Over three dozen armed men and women clad in bulletproof vests. As if Captain America used guns.
Bucky cursed as he crouched to grab it, but he was quick to notice the blood on the ground less than three steps away from where the watch was laying. Something bad happened here, and he needed to know what.
Once he's reached the bottom, he finally looks up at Wade. He's patiently waiting for the boy's reaction, though he worries when he sees said boy's lip quivering.
Bucky walked into Peter's little space in the MedBay and sighed, seeing the small boy just staring at the small photo he held in his hands. He wasn't going to ask, and he wasn't going to push. He was going to sit quietly next to Peter's bed and just be there for him, no matter what. But as a surprise, Peter spoke first.
Bucky is there roasting some kind of meat on the stove, and with him is the tall blonde named Steve. Peter thinks it might be easy to confuse the two Stephen's if they looked anything alike. This Steven was engaged to Bucky and is very nice to Peter. Next to them is Natasha, who he learned was a spy. She's also dating Bucky and Steve. He didn't really understand how that worked, but he wasn't going to judge.
He absentmindedly thought of the scratch on his wrist and when he looked down at it, he allowed his eyes to focus in on the silvery-white scars he had there for the first time in a year. He hoped to God that nobody else would ever notice. He wore long sleeves, his jacket, his watch. And when he didn't he hoped to God that nobody paid close enough attention to see.
Peter was nervously flittering around in the apartment awaiting Wade's arrival. Nat thought it was cute how nervous he looked. He brushed his hair maybe five times, and he brushed his teeth twice already. He asked Nat if he should get dressed and she declined, telling him it was outrageous to wear regular clothes on Christmas morning. He laughed and seemed to relax a little, but then he looked at where Steve and Bucky and Bruce and Tony were all standing together.
Peter had endured worse pains before, but this one stung with each breath he took. It ached with every move he made. Each time he stepped, the pain traveled up his side, beating within him like a second pulse. Each time he breathed, when his chest expanded, his wound collapsed in on itself, the stitches pulling tighter. It was like a black hole with a barrier, forever trying to fold in on itself but never being able to.
And so, on they went, stopping by Miss Potts' workplace to see if she'd be interested in hanging out and helping out. She didn't mind and was actually a little excited to finally get to spend some time with Peter.
Peter wasn't sure where Wade was going with this, so he just nodded and allowed the large (and heavy) box to be sat in his lap. He wasn't sure how the thing was being held together with all the weight inside of it.
When Wade returned from shore that afternoon, Peter was already curled up in the desk chair, eyes glued to his computer screen. Wade didn't attempt to make him move just yet, opting instead to make some food before even bothering to remove Peter from his work.
He followed the carnage through the house, and then out the other side. He heard cursing, and then Bucky's heavy boot steps behind him.
They'd started the moment he opened his eyes this morning, and he couldn't avoid them long enough to go back to sleep. He was alone now, and he didn't know how to make it all go away.
Steve stepped around Bucky and took another step towards Peter who stepped back so quickly he collided with the wall behind him. Bucky grabbed onto Steve's arm and pulled him back so he was once again standing behind him with Nat.
Wade easily said that it'd been a really long time since he'd seen any of the family he used to have. He was in his teens when he left them, he was sure they'd either moved on or passed on by now. He wasn't sure if he cared which.
"A kid who can stop a bus with his bare hands and hack into a multimillion-dollar security system that grown adults from the government couldn't even pass the firewall on." He passes through the group room and collects Natasha as the facility-wide alarm blares. He swipes a clipboard from a frantic looking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and curses a little.
Bucky's day started with his phone ringing off the fucking hook and a frantic Steve half-yelling at him on the other end of it. From what he could gather, Rumlow had managed to escape in Bucky's absence and they couldn't find him, so they needed him to come back and help them find him because he was probably the one who knew Rumlow's habits the best.
He looked back into the hollow, seeing that there were more than just these files there. Inside Bucky could see clear as day the first knife he ever gave Peter, his first Spider-Man suit, a small Lego man that looked like Darth Vader, a bottle of his old web-fluid formula, a negative pregnancy test inside of a ziplock bag, one of Wade's masks, a photo of Peter's Aunt May and Uncle Ben, Peter's birth certificate, two old dirty pairs of dog tags that once belonged to him and Steve, one of Nat's guns tucked safely into it's holster, a book of baby names, and one of the oldest models of Tony's arc reactor.
It reminded Peter of the look on his own face when Tony re-did his suit for him. When he did all that he could to help the focus in his vision once he knew that Peter had troubles focusing on all of the input his brain was receiving at once.
"Of course. Okoye and I will venture to the Starbucks..." He glanced to the woman who nodded, "Down the street while you deliberate with your partner. Take all the time you need, we're here for the week."
And then he was jolting upright, fully awake in bed again with Steve gripping onto his metal arm and keeping it pinned to the bed. Nat was nearly sitting on his other arm to keep it pinned down as well as she called his name.
Peter looked confused now, and before Wade could even step forward, Bruce swung his arm up and smacked the switch in his webbed hand.
Steve nodded in silent agreement, and Bucky just blinked. He can barely remember the last Christmas he had with Steve. He knows that he spent all that he had to get the little punk some good pencils. He was bummed that he couldn't get him a new book too, but he promised that he'd get him one for his birthday. Steve told him not to worry about it, that he didn't want him to waste his money.
Steve, despite his steely exterior, had a very soft heart. He never let his emotions show on the surface until it came to his family. Tony called Bucky 'Tin Man' once and, let's just say he never made that mistake again. Steve has always felt very deeply, and he's always tried to hide it. But everyone knows that when it comes to the people he loves, Steve is an emotional mess.
His brows knit together in confusion but he thanks Steve and makes his way back to the bedroom, knocking gently before entering. In the chair by the window sits Bucky with Natasha on his lap. They're murmuring quietly in Russian and Peter can't quite make out what they're saying, even with the little bit of Russian that he does know. He contemplates reaching up and turning his hearing-aid up but by the time the thought crosses his mind they've stopped talking and turned to him.
Tony glances over his shoulder at the two of them. "If the system shut down that means that the security and cameras were off for the whole building until FRIDAY rebooted... Is everything else accounted for?"
He was wondering why his healing abilities weren't fighting off the drug... Did the serum affect his body's healing properties? No, now was not the time to think about that. Not when there was a room of little assholes that thought it was okay to drug kids right in front of him.
Rumlow tossed the small boy onto the small bed and stared back into Peter's wide eyes. How to break a soul? A mind? Start with the body of course, and the rest will follow. He leaned over the child before him, because that's what he was, a child, and smirked. He grabbed the boy's jaw and leaned in close.
It's been 35 days since Peter's rescue and he's beginning to get restless. He wants to get out of the house, but he isn't ready for school and still barely remembers his friends. He wants to go somewhere that he's never been before. He doesn't want to relearn, he wants to be taught without issue.
His head hurt so bad all he wanted to do was curl up and sleep, but he needed to get out of here. He felt too sick to stay at school, but his phone was in his bag and his bag was in his locker and- he suddenly remembered the watch on his wrist and double tapped the screen as he coughed.
Peter touched his flat stomach and thought about how in a few short months he'd be a parent, and the thought took its toll immediately, scaring him to the point of tears. He was still so young, how could he be a parent? How could he be a
Natalia seemed pleased as T'Challa promised them that if Peter joined them, he would still be able to attend his classes and earn his points towards graduation, and maybe even graduate early if he did well enough. He could work and earn money, he would have a clean place to live and good food to eat. He would be treated just like everyone else, like family. He and Bucky both.
"I did it, Mr. Stark, I deserve it... Should've done it a long time ago then... Maybe everything would be different."
Partway into the night, Bucky makes his way into Peter's room and takes his place next to the door, ready to end anyone that threatens his Spiders tonight. Bucky and Natasha have been together for a very long time, and he'd be damned if he let anything happen to her. He's fully aware that she can take care of herself, but he enjoys putting her first.
Steve was strangely okay with that, knowing that any one of these assholes might know Peter's location. Steve didn't know how many people in the building were still alive and he worried he was too late to save any possible survivors... But these were Hydra agents, he didn't want to save them anyways.
They didn't know if he was alone or if he had a team, but they all knew that either way, his skill set already made him worse than any army out there. He would have no mercy, and there would be no survivors.
His voice was just barely short of a roar now as he yelled directly into the man's covered face. He glanced to Natalia, who, though nobody else would ever be able to tell, was beginning to look concerned. He pushed himself up, using his knees as leverage.
He was on a mission with Sam and Steve. A small infiltration to a base somewhere in the middle of Russia. There were only meant to be a few people inside of the base. It was supposed to be a quick mission.
Nat laughed softly as she strode over in her silk slip. "Maybe." She leaned up and started kissing along Steve's jaw as she slipped down onto her knees between him and the counter.
The boy can't help but laugh and had to admit that he felt a lot better now that he knew Pepper had his back. So, for the hour that Tony was gone, they went through the store and while Pepper had already picked out what she needed, they found new things for Peter.
. It's a sound he knew and it was embedded in his brain and it was one of the few things Hydra didn't manage to take away from him and he held onto her voice and her arms while they just sat together and waited for Bucky to finish stomping down the stairs.
He told Steve the address that was on the screen, but Steve wouldn't make it there before he would. Bucky was on his way down the stairs as he talked to Steve on the phone. He was going to raise all kinds of hell if he got there and saw something other than Peter.
When Wade pulled his hands away from Peter, he whined. But Wade just shushed him and stood to take his own pants off. Peter blushed more than he'd done in the last hour when Wade was naked in front of him.
Wade took to sitting on the couch and playing Dragon City on his phone. He didn't mind sitting by himself, and he wasn't bothered that the only noises were the crackling fire and the typing on Peter's laptop.
He had no idea how long he'd been here, in this crumbling underground prison of his. He watched the numbers on the calendar change, each day marked out with a red 'X' but after the first two months, he lost track of how many 'X's there were. All he knew was that the calendar said октября. He still didn't speak Russian, but he was picking up on simpler words, and that word meant 'October'.
burger joint with great reviews on Yelp.”  Tony checked his phone, then held it out so Steve could read the starred review on a foodie blog.  If their old favorite
Alas! All things must end, and so did the years of Stephanos, the Captain of Graymarie. For one Arminius, a Switzer rumored to have clashed with Stephanos during his service to the Emperor Lucius Artorius, did envy Graymarie her good fortune and desire to seize her wealth for himself. He raised an army and sailed across the sea, thinking that peace had made Stephanos soft, and sought to land at the Isle of the Conies, one of the Five Blessed Isles, on a cold spring day before any defense could be mustered.
Alas, words can scarce tell of the sorrow when word came that King Huard and Queen Maria had perished whilst hunting the Dragon of Ten Rings. For it is said that the dragon came upon them ere the King had donned his armor, and before he or his knights could so much as cry out, the black wyrm's breath had consumed them all. The Queen alone remained to fight, but so shocked was she by the awful death of her lord and his household that she could scarce bear to lift her sword before the dragon’s tail had swept her over the side of a cliff, there to perish on the rocks below….
…and so it was that the people did acclaim Stephanos, mighty in battle and much of honor, to be the Captain of Graymarie, sent by Arthur to protect and guide them in his absence. And when Arthur fell in battle and was seen no more, the wise of the land did request that Stephanos remain as their guardian, though he might have returned to Rome’s service or repaired to his own steading….
“And yet not five minutes ago you wondered what the point of it all was.”  Atlas shook his head.  “You little know how crucial you are to the world, young warrior, or to those you call friend.  Believe me, both would be poorer were you still caught between life and death.”
Last of all he descended into the lowest levels of the crypt where stood a great altar of stone and a casket of imperishable crystal holding the body of the Captain of Graymarie. Long nights had he spent before this sarcophagus, contemplating the cold face and powerful form of the greatest of Graymarie’s rulers. The Shield of the Star, blessed by God and borne by St. George, lay upon his breast, while before the casket was a plaque with the words of Stephanos spoken before King Arthur himself when the great Captain had ridden off to defend Graymarie:
Tony pushed fall of fabric back into place.  The light from the arc reactor gave his face an unearthly pallor.  “Who was left?  We don’t even know what planet the Chitauri are from, or how Loki met them.  I was supposed to keep the world safe.  I didn’t.  QED.”
It was a week after harvest time when Ioannes Schmidt, called Caput Rufus, arrived upon the borders of Graymarie. Great was his host, as mercenaries and Free Companies in search of rich booty had flocked to his standard, along with renegade Templars and Teutonic Knights and many others. His baggage train groaned with gold and the stores of a hundred lands he had earlier despoiled, and none would fault the man who saw his might and despaired.
At the end of the day Ioannes rode in a final, desperate charge against Stephanos himself. The great Captain, weary from long toil, had turned to encourage his men and did not see this attacker, and had not Antonius himself fired a dart from one of his machines to surprise the evil one, treachery might have claimed the champion God had preserved so long beneath Our Lady’s home. As it was, Stephanos saw his King’s bolt in flight and moved aside so that the wicked one’s sword but glanced off his great shield and did no harm. Then he cried out in a great voice, “Stand back, my King! This one shall not touch thee!” and struck Ioannes so great a blow as to cleave his body in twain, thus to fall into two pieces upon the battleground and lie unmourned and unshriven.
“Good,” Tony breathed.  Neither spoke for a long, long moment, even when the critic pulled out his phone and shouted that he was calling the police.  “Want to blow this Popsicle stand?”
thing he’s binge-watching, and I don’t even want to think about how many ways Natasha would kill me if I let anything happen to you.”  Tony pantomimed cutting his throat, breaking into a grin as Steve managed a shaky laugh.  “Home?  You need to know about the Yule Log before Thor fixates on it tomorrow morning.”
The army of Graymarie let up a great shout at the sight of the man they knew only as a legend alive and well and prepared to fight once more in their defense. They shook their spears at his brave words and cried that they would follow Stephanos and Antonius, Captain and King, into the very jaws of death. Even the Master of Men quailed at this, for he and his chief had seen but little defiance on their way from Rus to Graymarie, and the words of freedom were new to his ears.
“I was the one who boasted a couple of years ago about ‘privatizing world peace,’ then told a Senate committee to kiss my ass.”  The saffron wrap slid off Tony’s hair as he slowly bowed his head.  “Guess you could say I asked for that one.”
A burst of angry shouting made both men turn.  Steve's fists clenched as General Ross, an honor guard of Rangers in full body armor fanned about behind him, stood at rigid attention before a visibly enraged Nick Fury.  Two of the Rangers stepped forward to claim a dark-haired man on a stretcher.  A medic started to protest, only to be pushed aside by another soldier with a laser rifle.
…in the year of grace 450, the great emperor of Rome, Lucius Artorius, did send a company of soldiers from Eboracum to the aid of his cousin, Arthur son of Uther, to aid him against invasion and war led by his kinsman Mordred. This company was captained by a man named Stephanos, originally from Hibernia but long in the service of the imperial armies fighting against the barbarian hordes from the East. Arthur sent precious relics from Glastonbury Abbey in thanks, but here the correspondence between the rulers ceases….
Steve managed a little half-smile at the thought of Tony’s mother, elegant and poised, settling down to read a story about Psmith or Bertie Wooster to her brilliant, restless little boy.  Peggy had introduced him to P.G. Wodehouse during an air raid, when her well-loved copy of The Code of the Woosters had been the only printed material the team had had besides a week old copy of Stars and Stripes and a crumbling ASE edition of This is Your War.  “I got that reference.”
A burst of steam from a sidewalk grate enveloped him.  He dashed away the tears, leaning into the warmth for a few seconds before it vanished into the night.  He pressed his burning cheek against the stone and shuddered, chilled to the bone by something that was not the wind.
Antonius made his way down the rows of the dead, hoping to find some guidance from prayer among the bones those who had come before him. James and Natasha lay in their common grave, the stone worn smooth by long years; the simple slab of granite with seventy-six crosses marked William, first of his name; the great mace wielded by King Geoffrey laid upon his floor grave; the effigies of Sir Gabriel and Dame Margaret, each mailed and accoutered for battle. The nuns of Our Lady of Liberty kept perpetual vigil for them all, the rulers and heroes of Graymarie, and Antonius nodded briefly as he passed one sister and another as she knelt before each tomb.
“Not this one, oh no,” said Tony.  He walked briskly to the corner and waited for the pedestrian signal.  “This one is – well, it’s an old New York custom.  Not quite from your time, but not new.”
Also did Antonius return in secret to the crypt with the royal banner, which he draped over the casket of Stephanos, that none might know that its occupant once more walked among mortal men. If any asked, the King replied only that the dismissal of the demon that had worn the guise of Bishop Obadiah had cracked the crystal, and he wished to conceal the damage until the battle against Ioannes Caput Rufus had been won….
“You don't know the half of it,” said Tony.  He watched as Ross and his detail followed Bruce onto the transport.   “Also?  All joking aside, if  you haven’t filed your DD 214 by now, do it as soon as the personnel office at Fort Hamilton opens on the 26th.  I’ve heard rumors about him trying to get you transferred from the Avengers to his command.  If that happens I’m not sure even Ellis will be able to get you out before Ross lets his boys go to town.“
“Fuck you, asshole,” said the kid.  He flipped Steve the bird, then hopped on his skateboard and ripped down a side street before Steve could react.  One of the women squealed, while another started talking about how rude and mean everyone in New York was, why couldn’t they be like people out in Blue Ball, next year they’d stay home and not waste their money.
“Come with me,” said King, and led him hence to the scriptorium of Our Lady to behold the pious nuns at their work. Then he took Stephanos to the great library, with books in Latin and Greek and other tongues, and afterwards to the stonecarvers and glaziers as they worked to adorn a chapel dedicated to Huard and Maria. Lastly they visited the great workshops and smithies where Antonius spent his work time, and when the bells rang for the evening meal Stephanos had seen reasons enough to cherish Graymarie in this time as well as his own.
Normally Steve would have shrugged and refused, but not tonight.  He nodded, gripped Tony’s lower arm, and let the smaller man pull him to his feet.  “Thanks.  Guess I nodded off waiting to see if I could sneak in.”
“We were talking about the dog, Steve, not you.  I swear.”  Tony placed his hands on Steve’s shoulders, carefully avoiding the sore spot.  “You’re the heart of the team and have been from the start, whether you know it or not.  Thor tries, he really does, and so does Nat, and me, and the others, but without you?  We’re five freelancers pretending to work together and failing pretty badly    You’re the difference whether you know it or not.”
Antonius did then stare in wonder and amazement, for Stephanos was exactly as he had been throughout the long years in the crypt, save only that his cheeks were ruddy with life, not cold and pale as one dead. His hair was gold beneath his helmet of antique design, his eyes as blue as the summer sky, and his mail gleamed as if just polished. His great shield, beset with the Star of Bethlehem and circled with blue for loyalty and red for courage, hung upon his arm, and a flaming torch shone in his right hand, deadly and keen.
Another screech sounded from somewhere in the distance.  Steve glanced up at the ceiling, then down the tracks.  The light from the fissure was enough for a normal person to see the platform in the distance, the switches and warning lights and the third rail.  “Yeah, that was swell.  I always wanted to know about Loki’s private parts.”
- on a stone seat about ten feet in front of him.  He wore a long, saffron colored length of fabric wound about his body and draped over his head, and was twiddling a branch of something green and frond-like in one neatly manicured hand.  Steam that smelled like the aftermath of a thunderstorm rose from a fissure in the tracks and gently ruffled his intentionally messy hair.
So it was that Antonius became the tenth King of Graymarie, and young though he was, he proved as able a ruler as any since Stephanos had been the Captain of the land. The wisest were set to work restoring the land that had been scorched by the Dragon of Ten Rings, that the people might not starve from want of a harvest. Soon the country was as prosperous as ever it had been, and to have a suit of armor or a sword forged in Graymarie was the goal of every lord and king and duke in Christendom. "Our King of Iron," the people called Antonius, for his will was great, also his prowess in the hunt and on the tourney field, and under his aegis Graymarie prospered and was at peace.
The woman’s perfectly groomed brows arched up in surprise.  “It’s Midnight Mass at St. Patrick’s.  Of course you need tickets.  Half the tourists in New York would show up to gawk if they didn’t have a way to limit how many people are allowed inside.”
Tony shot his left hand out and checked his wrist.   “Quarter of one on the 25th, so Merry Christmas and ho ho ho.”  He held out a stainless steel travel mug with vaguely sweet steam rising from the lid.
“Looks like it, and no, I don't know why your subconscious chose me to do the whole 'Clarence needs to get his wings' thing.”  Tony shrugged and slipped off his seat.  He was almost Steve's height here, and still glowing slightly.  “I also have no idea why you're naked, but hey, not going to question it.  Your dream quest thing, your nudity.”
from the wheels.  “Is that what you – oh my God.  You poor bastard, I can’t believe – “  Tony groaned and let out a laugh was more exasperation than anything else.
Many was the night that the King would leave his bed and wander castle and church, working out plans and schemes for machines that might save the land. Those who saw him claimed he spoke often to himself, as if the very stones might answer, and those of his own household noted how wan and red eyed he grew as the enemy approached. Then yet more rumors spread that the King was unfit to rule, or had gone back to drink and loose company, and so the heart of the people failed even as it should have grown stouter.
Steve slumped against the cold granite plinth that held up the statue of Atlas holding up the world.  He’d watched, fascinated, as the workmen set it into place, never dreaming that it or he would still be unchanged eighty years later.
“My lord king,” said this Stephanos, stepping forward and dropping to one knee, “send me to thy lands of Graymarie. I swear to thee now, before this great company, that I shall defend this land and people against all comers as long as there is strength in my arm and breath in my body. Thou hast been as a father to me since I came hence with my company, and I would repay thee thus.”
“I don't know about this one, Tony,” said Steve, peering at the menu posted in the restaurant window.  “'DMO's Fancy Fixin's' doesn't sound like a burger joint.”
Steve opened his mouth, then shut it.  It was almost midnight, almost Christmas, and he had no business ruining an innocent tourist’s holiday just because he was a in a bad mood.  “Get it together, Rogers,” he murmured, and hurried to the last corner –
“Never, by Our Lady of Liberty!” swore Antonius, and truly did the Bishop recoil at the name of the Mother of God. At this Lady Ginevra, making the Sign of the Cross against evil (for what true priest would show disgust at mention of the Blessed Virgin?), drew a potion of truthtelling from her girdle and threw it in Obadiah’s face.
“I shall defend this land and people against all comers as long as there is strength in my arm and breath in my body.”
That Tony did, per the Avengers' Google calendar that Tony's faithful AI faithfully maintained.  “CAP – sparring, Logan” it read, and if Tony felt just the teensiest flash of jealousy at the idea of two old war buddies getting hot, sweaty, and possibly entangled, he was not going to admit it in public.  “Basketball was scheduled first,” he said.  “That means post-basketball burgers, which means Logan can wait.”
Neither man spoke for a moment.  Then Steve said, a hair too quickly, “You know, I think I pencilled Logan in for the wrong day.  There’s an exhibit over at at the Guggenheim I was meaning to see, Italian Futurists, and I – I’d love company if you had the – “
“I hate to admit it, but that goes for me, too.  You keep me from going off the rails, even more than Pepper.  So don’t think we’d be better off if you were still defying global warming somewhere near Greenland.  It’s not true, so don’t even start.”
Tony hesitated.  “More than you want to know,” he said at last.  “Without you, the cops tried to hold off the Chitauri themselves instead of evacuating civilians, so bye-bye most of New York’s finest.  No one set a perimeter, either, which meant the attack spread all the way up Manhattan.  I think they finally managed to stop it around Fort Tryon Park.”
And so it was that Antonius donned his newest armor, forged from adamant brought from far-off Ouakanda by Sir Gabriel in the days of Stephanos, girded the sword of state about his slender waist, and rode off to confront the Dragon of the Ten Rings. With him were but three, his most faithful companions: James of Rhodes, cousin to mighty Feirefiz brother to the knight Parvizal, of whom Wolfram of Germany hath writ; Felix Pugilisticus, strong of hand and loyal of heart; and Lady Ginevra herself, who wore her fallen Queen’s favor into battle and brought with her all the potions of war that Antonius had created during his studies.
Long hours did they ride, yet so determined were they that it was as if mere minutes had passed since the doleful news of Graymarie’s loss. They found the Dragon, crouched gloating above the royal standard and the shield of King Huard, and so wroth was Antonius that had not Sir James not restrained him he would have charged the foe immediately, without thought nor plan. “Sire, God hath granted thee the skill and brains to defeat his rough beast without risking thy life through rashness and lack of foresight,” declared the noble knight. “Consider well before thou dost attack, to be certain of the victory.”
“What?”  Tony frowned.  “I know I've got a mouth, but come on.  There are whole careers built on studying your influence on the war and American life, beginning with you being the most admired American from 1952 to 1973 inclusive even though everyone thought you were dead.  Without you we wouldn't have stood a chance back in May, you -  “
“No, no.”  The compassion in the stranger’s voice, the sudden sympathy in his wife’s eyes as she held out a slip of paper, was more than Steve could bear.  “I couldn’t.  You – you go with your family.  I’ll find somewhere else.”
For the time had come when the great king Arthur son of Uther Pendragon must needs march off to war against the foul and wicked usurper Mordred. His own castle of Camelot he gave over to his trusted steward to rule until he should return again, and also his lands and kingdom to his faithful knights and nobles. Yet none could be found to rule Graymarie, fairest of his possessions, and the King did despair and lament that Graymarie should fall into ruin without his strong arm to repel the barbarian hordes.
“Young man?  Are you all right?” said the man in the chesterfield.  “You look like you’ve seen a ghost.”
“How long have you been there?” Tony gave the dog a pointed look, then frowned in Steve's general direction.  “This fleabag just caused a mess, so I wouldn’t come - “
“Lucky doesn't  have fleas,” said Clint, joining him.  His t-shirt was rumpled and his hair stuck straight up in front.  “Five minutes and we'll have more pizza rolls.  You want?”
“That's not what you said to Clint,” Steve said before he could stop himself, and Tony actually retreated a step.  He looked genuinely shocked, not ironic.
“This is well said,” replied Antonius, and while the Dragon slept he did prepare his armor and lance with the alchemical solutions and ointments Lady Ginevra had brought hence. “May the Lord guide my hand, and may my parents be avenged!” And thus armed and prepared did he ride forth to destroy the Dragon.
Great was the battle that raged that day, as the chroniclers do tell us. Thrice did Antonius charge the Dragon, and thrice was he beaten back, losing horse and lance and even his shield to its deadly fire and poisonous breath. It was not until his stout companions did distract the beast with crossbow bolts and great war cries that he was able to come close enough to douse its fire with a potion proof against brimstone. Then, whilst the beast as so crippled, Antonius, son of Huard and Maria, raised his sword of Ouakandan metal and drove it into the great vein in the Dragon’s neck and thus end its evil life.
The scene shifted, and they hovered above the Hudson, the Palisades to their rear, a battered ruin that looked like a castle below.  Steve could not hold back a gasp as he recognized the shattered stone.
“That's Bruce on the ground,” said Tony.  His jaw twitched as the Rangers loaded an unconscious Dr. Banner onto a sleek black transport.  “Ross has wanted himself a super soldier for years and Brucie's the closest thing we had before you showed up.  Now he's got what he wanted most, never mind that without Bruce I was a dead man and the city was probably toast.”
“I don’t much like them.”  The scarf was still warm from contact with Tony’s flesh, still smelled of his cologne.   Steve took another drink to avoid thinking about how good it felt, and what that might mean.  “I’ll be fine.”
Stephanos then placed his sword at Antonius’ throat, lifting his chin that he might gaze into the young King’s eyes. “What words are these? What peril? Speak thy name and explain thyself! For this is not the Isle of Conies and thou art not a man I know.”
” he called, and pulled out a twenty just in case their muscle bound server had something against superheroes and tried to put them near the kitchen.
“There’s much you haven’t considered, my friend.”  Atlas leaned closer, knees grinding slightly as his metal joints flexed and moved.  “The world and your place in it, for one.”
The frond tickled as Tony draped it across Steve’s shoulder and chest.  “Sorry, but not yet.  You knew Capra, so yeah, you need to see Potterville before the Powers That Be let you go back to being depressed.”
And yet for all his brave words, privily did the King doubt and despair. Peace had left the country ill-prepared for attack, also Obadiah's treason had caused some to doubt that Antonius was the true King, as he had been born to a ruling monarch and not chosen from among the elect as had been long the custom. "Would that we had one as wise and brave as Stephanos! Antonius is yet barely out of childhood. How can he lead us against the foe?" they did lament, and cry bitter tears as they repaired to church to pray for mercy and repent of their sins.
- but what had happened to his clothes?  Why didn’t his shoulder hurt from landing on rough ground?  How had he gone from Fifth  Avenue to a place that sounded and smelled like an unused subway tunnel?
He beheld Antonius in his royal robes and golden crown, and took a step down from the altar. “What place is this? Who are thou, to wear a kingly crown?” cried he in the accent of years past. “Arthur is long removed to the Isle of Apples, and foul is the man who would usurp his place!”
Eventually the noise stopped, and he was able to let the memories go, one by one.  The bedclothes that had kept him warm became unbearably heavy and hot, and he unpeeled them enough to reach for the bedside clock to check the time.
sound and considered the regular menu, then sighed. “As delicious as this all sounds, you're right.  My doctor did tell me to watch my cholesterol, so I guess it’s Chateau D'Hip for me.”
Steve woke in darkness, warm and deep and  still.  He lay unmoving for a moment as his senses adjusted to the lack of light, then carefully worked each limb until he was sure he was uninjured.  Gravel dug into his cheek, and the air smelled of ozone and sweat and oil.   A faint, sparking screech of metal on metal sounded occasionally, but the sound was muffled, as if behind a massive wall.
“Which is not a concern since it's my turn to buy.”  Tony clapped him on the back, just heartily enough to avoid seeming less than platonic.  “Plus the Health Department gave it an 'A' for cleanliness.  What's not to like?”
“QE nothing!”  Steve gestured at dream-Tony and his whiskey.  “You’re the smartest man I know.  Even if I hadn’t been there you still would have found a way to beat those bastards.  This is bull, one person wouldn’t make that much of a difference – “
Others have written about the great battle that raged upon that doleful day, of how the sky grew dark with the showers of arrows that pierced the Red Skull’s lines and how the shield wall of Graymarie buckled and nearly failed under the charge of the Company of the Serpent and others fresh from the Italian wars. My poor words can scarce convey the dreadful slaughter nor the mighty deeds upon both sides, for as evil as Ioannes was, among his forces were men of courage and skill, and had their leader been a worthy man their prowess would be renowned, and Graymarie fallen to their swords.
“You are most welcome,” said JARVIS, just as the door swished open.  “I endeavor to give satisfaction, as one of the late Mrs. Stark’s favorite authors might have said.”
The poor boy looked up to Bucky as a way of double checking that the man in the flag was a good guy, and only after getting a nod in return did he say, "The man with the glowing eyes."
Peter quickly stood and backed up as quickly as his shaking legs could carry him. He tripped backward over something and when he looked down, he saw his own body there, in a pool of blood. His stomach had been ripped open and his wrists had been slit. Part of him wondered which happened first.
Mentally he protested that he doesn't have the strength for that kind of attack, and the man agreed as Peter followed another order of taking a small needle and stabbing it into his arm. Rumlow asked him to put several more needles into the same space on his arm before telling him they could be removed. He stood and made his way around the table.
