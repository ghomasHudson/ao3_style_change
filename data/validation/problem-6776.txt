“Please,” Tony said, fingers gripping tightly to Steve’s shoulders, “I swear to Newton if you don’t pick up the pace, Rogers…”
“Tony Stark? Ring a bell at all? The man is a tech genius. I thought you were taking me inviting him as your date a little lightly. I can’t believe you didn’t recognize him.” Bucky patted him on the shoulder. At least he looked less nervous about being in front of a crowd when he could focus on teasing Steve.
Steve set down the bags of souvenirs they’d bought. “It was cool. I liked the section they had on the development of disposable cameras. Reminded me of so many summers where Buck and I each had one that had to last the whole summer vacation.”
. He blushed, cheeks taking on the color of the cloak still tied around his shoulders, “I mean, you don’t have to. I know you’re busy, please just one fork. I’ll just--”
“Steve?” Sam’s voice cut through the veil of the past, the crushing weight of memory that stole his breath. “What’s wrong, buddy?”
He walked through the open plan penthouse, aiming for the bedroom where he probably stashed his bag in the closet in his rush to be home a few weeks ago. “Tony? Are you home? I’m grabbing my bag befo--”
“Thank you, they've been working hard. I’ve been waiting to meet you, Mr. Rogers. Peter has been excelling in class, he has a bright future, I’d like to help guide him to a good college program if you’d let me.”
Steve’s heart did a little flip-flop before his brain got with the program. “I’m sorry, I thought my friend was waiting for me. He’s getting married this weekend and the place we ordered the tuxes from had a fire last week.”
"Steve," he corrected, and not for the first time. Steve rubbed the back of his neck nervously, his eyes still on the package. "You really think so?"
After it was over, everyone mingled. Students took turns bringing their parents around to some of the other experiments lining the walls and taking selfies with DUM-e. Peter walked Steve around so he could dutifully
Tony was slowly getting him to live a little without pissing away his salary like so many of his peers did. Fate had brought them together at a charity fundraiser. The Maria Stark Children’s hospital needed a volunteer for photos and autographs and Steve had the time of his life meeting fans and raising money for kids. When the last photo of the day was Tony Stark himself, Steve was more than a little smitten. He signed it with his phone number and the rest was history.
Steve decided that melting through the floor in embarrassment was sounding better and better. His face was probably the color of his shirt.
“I do. Maybe at some point, we could make some copies? If that’s ok.” Steve wrung his hands together, “I’m sorry, I never thought any of this would happen. I’m a little bit in shock.”
“Tests have always been a sticky point for him,” Steve said. He made a mental note to swing by a bookstore for some prep guides.
“Can you move us to the side? The post-fuck flop is crushing me, honey,” Tony said after a few moments.
Tony stood. He wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck. He pressed his lips against Steve’s, leading him in a languid kiss. He suddenly overflowed with things he wanted to say, hoping they translated in the way he slid his hand through Steve’s hair, or the tender way he cradled his neck.
"I can send you a photo if you'd like? And we would need to know as soon as possible if you two are wanting to meet him."
“I am. I wasn’t sure what was going to happen, all those months ago when you walked back into our lives, but you just fit. Not every alpha would jump in feet first to get to know his pup, would devote so much time…”
Tony’s mouth made a noise of agreement and pleasure as he sealed it around Steve’s length, licking up the mess dripping from the tip. His tongue flickered against the shaft, under the crown and over all of Steve’s sensitive places until Steve’s mind started to haze. Tony was teasing, but also jacking him tightly, catching him between the edge of too much and not enough before sucking harder, taking him deeper.
“Dad, I’m ok,” Peter’s voice was muffled from being crushed to Steve’s chest, his arms wrapped around him tight.
“Kicked me out of their home and my apartment. Cut off everything but the trust fund, since it was legally mine already.”
His voice cracked, wrent into pieces at seeing his omega who wasn’t his anymore, body flaring in pain. Years worth of aching denial like a hot fireplace poker to his soul. “Yeah.”
is ask him out. I know he doesn’t come in here every week for macchiatos and new issues of Herbology Monthly.”
“Shh shh, honey,” Steve said. “If I make it out of the sandbox, and you aren’t with someone, all bonded and happy. But please, don’t wait for me. It’d…” his own voice was starting to crack, “it’d kill me to know you wasted years waiting on me. Okay?”
and nod at everything going over his head. His boy was suddenly so much older, and although he’d always been smarter, he wasn’t hiding or diminishing himself any longer. That struck Steve as more impressive than any computer code or hypothesis presented that night. The knowledge that he made the right choice to move Peter, to give him a place to grow, uprooting their lives and finding a new job and home, instead of the easier choice of staying and hoping that the toxicity of their old lives would fix itself somehow.
on the plane because he knows I hate that one, but he’ll be fine. He’d ditch me too if he found Nat all dolled up like this.” He finally closed in on his target. He placed his hands on each side of Tony on the countertop behind him, keeping himself just a breadth apart, and looked down the front of the jersey at the little bit of cleavage Tony achieved with lace and straps.
“Not about that,” Steve sighed. “But good to know. Sam is in for his shift at 3:00, I’ll make sure he sends Redwing up there to collect the garbage.”
"That would be great." Steve had a new thought circling his head. He caught Happy ready to leave and waved him back over, moving the phone away from his mouth, "Let me see the gift, Happy?"
“When we got outside, we didn’t see him. He heard a lot of loud bangs, Mr. Stark had some sodium out on his table, something must have set off the sprinklers and the water would have--.” Ned paused. “Peter went back in for him.”
Silence stretched between them for a few moments before Tony spoke again. “Did you know an alpha’s sperm can live up to five days inside an omega?”
Steve grabbed the free edge of the blanket and flipped it, crawling under. He attacked swiftly, pressing tickling fingers into Tony’s side and sliding the thin material of his tank top up for more access.
Steve agreed to stay in New York in case of supervillain shenanigans. After Doom crashed the wedding last year in a Maleficent-esque tantrum, Tony didn’t want to chance having them both out of town. No matter how beautiful Steve would look wearing only silk sheets and the warm sunrise of Malibu morning.
Steve stuck out his hand for a shake, “Pleasure to meet you, that was quite the presentation they put on.”
Steve sat up and rubbed the drying tears and snot off his face with the palm of his hand, “What happened?”
The pot of water on the stove hissed and rumbled, finally at a boil. Steve dropped the whole box of pasta in, amazed at how much food teen boys put away. He wasn’t like that when he was that age, was he? Peter certainly has his build, scrawny and tall, but his appetite was bordering on superhuman.
Tony turned around to lean both elbows against the counter. The jersey’s cropped edge pulled against his chest as he reclined, stretching around his pecs and showing the barest hint of more white lace underneath and his tanned bare belly. The neckline fell toward one shoulder and revealed a lacy strap Steve wanted to break with his teeth. The front of the panties outlined his cock, already hard and threatening to pop past the elastic around the waistband.
“You know what, Buck.” Steve pointed to the drink Bucky was finishing up first, and then out to the sales floor where they both knew the object of Steve’s affections was browsing. “I don’t know how much longer I can do this without combusting like your cauldron the last time you tried to make fiery fizzwood sticks.”
“Dad, I did it already,” Peter looked at his dad as he fretted about the kitchen, putting dishes in the sink and opening cabinets like he was looking for the stuff they’d bought for lunches last week. “You haven’t packed me a lunch in two years.”
“Well, we can’t keep the cake waiting,” Tony said, leading Steve by the hand to the parking lot. And if there was a row of faces pressed to the atrium glass watching them go, neither bothered to mention it.
“Good to know,” Steve said, before sliding further down Tony’s body. He hooked his fingers in Tony’s pajama bottoms, taking them down enough to let his cock pop free. Steve had missed this too, the deep musky scent of him, his taste, tracing lines across Tony’s hip bones until his nose bumped the base of him. Steve left sloppy kisses up Tony’s shaft, like mouthing the drips from a popsicle on a hot day. His forearm over Tony’s belly held him still as he shuddered and bucked until Steve’s lips and tongue, every swipe and suck, had wrung every obscene noise he could wring out of them both.
“How do you know Tony’s last name, Sam? Have you met before?” Steve asked. He’d finished a final check through the suite. Ring was in his pocket, phone was off, and their street clothes and suit bags were boxed up for easy retrieval later tonight.
A flush of warmth washed over him. This wasn’t the first time Tony asked him to stay after his visitations with Peter, but the warmth happened every time. The alpha side of him basking in the attention of an omega, being allowed to stay near him and their pup for just a little bit longer. After the first meeting, they agreed to visits as often as Steve could make it up from D.C.
Steve rounded the edge of the Reflecting Pool to start another lap around. It was still early. The sun cracked the sky behind him and the air still had the crispness of dew. He caught sight of Sam on the other long edge as he passed, the only other jogger still out with him. Another two laps would mark the end of 10 miles, and while it was a little more than usual, Sam asked to be pushed before the qualifying race for the Boston Marathon next month.
Steve laughed, squeezing Tony’s slighter frame tighter. “Just let me know when halftime is over, baby. I plan on scoring a few more touchdowns in the second half.”
Steve did his own embarrassed shuffle, “I mean, I have hoped that someday, we could. But I understand if you didn’t want to.”
Dark roast coffee, like sticking his nose in a bag of fresh grounds. And sweet coconut. Clear as day and as strong as one of Bucky’s punches when he would catch Steve off guard at the gym.
Steve got his feet to work, moving to get between Tony and Bucky, “You don’t have to do this. You can ignore his wedding-induced delusion that a stranger would want to attend.”
“Steve? Are you okay? You sound like a strangled cat,” Bucky’s voice was tinny and distant from the phone as Steve’s focus snapped to Tony.
“I wasn’t alone. I had Pep, and the Rhodes. But I’m not going to lie and say I didn’t wish I had you there beside me. Us.”
Tony got his knees under him and turned. His shove was gentle, to get Steve onto his back, and he had a playful grin on his face. “You wanted my mouth?”
Tony set his drink down and reached up and brushed his fingers through the short roughness of Steve’s beard. “Oh honey, someone who doesn’t just want a news story, or a few grand for a few hours of fun?
This was definitely a grown man’s apartment with its classic modern furniture in neutral colors, but there were splashes of Tony everywhere. And of Peter. Toys and books with bright covers--stories about heroes and everyday kids-- shared a table with a tablet and a heap of circuitry and tools. The same posters for Formula One racing cars that used to hang over Tony’s desk at school were now framed and stationed on each side of a large TV; the only art that looked like Tony picked it out in the entire space. Things had changed, but the core of who Tony was was there.
“This is our only day of downtime before getting on the plane for Tampa. I want to spend it eating my weight in popcorn, and if we plan it right, I can get a refill before the movie actually starts.”
“I have copies for you. It’s ok, take your time. You look like I just told you I was pregnant right now,” Tony joked.
“No, you wanted to stand in the kitchen and look like a snack, so this is what you get.” Steve dipped his hand into Tony’s lace, starting up a firmer rhythm, “Make a mess for me, then I want your pretty mouth. Can you do that for me?”
“And miss my hot date? Never. It’s not everyday you meet the physical embodiment of a wet dream walking out of a fitting room.”
Bucky looked a little stunned, eyes darting back and forth between Steve and Tony. “Yeah, I am. And I see you’ve met my best man, Steve.”
Steve kissed him again. Small pecks to soothe away the furrow in Tony’s brow. He wasn’t sure how long they stood there reconnecting, Tony fitting perfectly in his arms, before Tony spoke again. “Stay the night?”
His staring must have finally alerted another parent, a woman eyeing him warily while tugging on Tony’s sleeve until he turned around. His eyes were just as expressive and wide as they were ten years ago, piercing the cold morning air straight to Steve’s own.
“Get a move on, Rogers. We’re going to miss the previews.” Bucky’s voice crackled in Steve’s ear. You’d think he’d get better reception in Stark Tower with a Starkphone.
Steve finally turned around to face his friends. “It was like looking at my damn elementary class photo, Buck. He has Tony’s eyes, though.”
and gagging for it. His own cock was painfully hard from waiting, with his own hands being full of Tony’s ass and cock and it just made him throb with each begging whine from Tony’s lips. He got to make him feel good, the power of pleasure in his hands to control the pace.
just rocked up to my wedding?” Sam asked, strolling into Bucky’s dressing room. “Sarah is having kittens in my texts.”
He pulled back and checked over his son himself. He was soaked from the sprinklers, shivering underneath his blanket, but in one piece, the vice around Steve’s chest loosened. “I don’t know if I want to wrap you in bubble wrap or ground you for a month. Or both, Jesus-- Pete, what were you thinking? You’re not a superhero.”
Steve reached for his phone, “Of course, give me your number, I’ll wait til later, when you’re home.”
“Wow, this is great news, Peter’ll be thrilled,” Tony said. He laid back down and drew little equations on Steve’s chest with his finger. “I'm pretty thrilled myself. Do you think Bucky and Nat will settle down, do the bite and all that stuff?”
Peter shuffled his feet and looked down, obviously a little embarrassed by being praised, “Yeah, Thank you, Mr. Stark.”
“Uncle Steve, look!” AJ ran over to take Steve by the hand and bring him closer to the slowly circling forks balanced on the candle.
Excitement prickled Steve’s skin like they were 18 again and touching each other for the first time in his dorm. He kissed Tony’s neck, mouthing over his bonding gland and breathed in his scent and sweat. His fingertips found the edge of his T-shirt. He ran his hand underneath and chased the goosebumps breaking out over Tony’s skin and felt him stiffen.
The only sound was the drip of the faucet they still haven’t fixed and Steve’s chopping. It stretched and ebbed while Bucky and Nat picked their jaws up off the floor.
They walked over to an empty table to claim it as theirs for the evening, picking one close enough to Sam and Bucky’s family table where Mama Barnes and Sam’s sister Sarah were already seated. He didn’t miss the looks on their faces as they watched him lead his date around the atrium. The family group chat was going to be unbearable tomorrow, he could feel it already.
“It’s ok. I can fly down if it won’t be too distracting. Set myself up in the hotel for when you’re sweaty and full of adrenaline after practice and need to work out the pre-game frustrations.”
Tony patted his hand, “Thank you. It was okay. Pepper let me sleep on her couch until I could get my own place. We actually got a place together, so she could help me with Peanut. She was in the delivery room with me and called Rhodey and a few others to let them know it went well.”
“All dolled up? You sound like a 1940s virgin out on the town with a dame for the first time, Rogers.”
“Students aren’t allowed to wear hats in class, he’s accessing an older subroutine he’s learned,” Tony explained. “DUM-e, good job, but you can return this to Mr. Leeds.”
home. Tony’s earthy shampoo and the faintest hint of grease and coconut that never fades, warm cotton and the feeling of his skin under Steve’s lips.
“Hey husband of mine,” Tony puckered for a kiss as Steve rounded the side of the workbench. “What brings you to my lair?”
“Me?” Steve didn’t squeak, but maybe in this instance, staring at the wizard that topped every single free-pass list in the magical realm, it could be said that Steve’s voice was a little high as he answered.
Tony shut Peter’s door quietly and walked Steve down the hall, back out to the living room. “Care for a nightcap?”
? God, Steve-ah!” Tony let out a series of breathy noises as Steve scraped his teeth over the swell of Tony’s right side.
Steve didn’t realize he was crying until he felt Tony dab his face with a tissue. The dam burst. The pressure of the past few weeks built to a crest and he let go. The ache of missing so much was like a cold burn cutting through him. Worse than any injury he suffered in the desert, on par with the icy restriction in his lungs growing up. He sobbed, heaving all the air out of his chest and struggling to catch up. He clung to Tony, the box pressed between both of their bellies. Ten years of tears wept onto Tony’s shirt, his smooth coconut and coffee scent easing the iron band constricting Steve’s rib cage.
“Oh my God,” Steve hid his face in his drink for a moment, “I don’t know how to even respond to that.”
“No buts. I was clearing the halls of any other students, which is my job in an evacuation.” Tony tightened the blanket around Peter’s shoulders, “I don’t think I’d be able to live with myself if I’d lost you, kid, if it was a bigger emergency.”
“Oh fuck no. Howard told me he was calling his doctor friend, that he’d get me ‘fixed’ right away before I started showing and disgracing him.” Tony rounded the island in the kitchen, inviting Steve to follow to go sit on the couch, “I told him to go fuck himself and his doctor friend. I wanted to keep it and he couldn’t stop me, I was a legal adult.”
Dinner was excellent, no matter how Tony downplayed his skills. Steve washed up while Tony put a completely tuckered Peter to bed. He was getting too old for stories and all the fuss of bedtime routines, but when Steve poked his head in, he could hear Tony speaking softly, little words of love as Peter’s eyes struggled to stay open until he finally drifted off.
Bucky had the audacity to snort loud enough that a group of imps that had wandered in all turned in his direction. Imps loved gossip, so Steve brought his voice to a whisper, “I’m not going to embarrass myself by throwing myself at Tony Stark. He went twelve for twelve with the Magic Maxim cover models.”
Before Tony came into his life, Steve hadn't had any experience in the relationship department. Sure, there was Bucky and the women that he'd go around with, but he wasn't like Bucky. He couldn't do things the way his friend did even if people were to give him a chance. So dating Tony was a learning experience. One that he didn't regret.
“Oh my God, Steve doesn’t know who his date is,” Sam thumped his head onto Bucky’s chest, “You asked a billionaire to our wedding for Grandpa Steve who still used a flip phone until like a year ago. How is this our life?”
The presentation was equal parts hilarious and informative, each club member presenting a portion or explaining the math and coding like they were giving a speech to the president instead of their parents a smattering of younger siblings that had tagged along. The bot danced in its own way, wiggling its arm and claw to mimic the students, but also acted up, pinching the hat from Ned’s head and wheeling away to Tony.
Tony sighed, “Me too.” His hand hadn’t left the top of Steve’s. “I doubted myself so much leading up to the birth, but she kept me level headed. Together, we got S&P off the ground, with her as CEO since no one would issue a business loan to a disgraced omega with a pup hanging off one hip.”
“Sounds like a date. Now,” Tony dropped a kiss to Steve’s temple before continuing, “not to ruin the mushy mood, but I've got lace working it’s way up my crack, if you could get to peeling me out of this…”
“It was great! They had this thing, it was set up like the old timey photos, where they had to stay still for a long time and make this face,” Peter paused long enough to pull the sides of his mouth with his fingers, “and it was really cool.”
Being the last of your friend group that wasn’t intentionally single led to a lot of meddling, blind dates, and offers to swipe on tinder for you. Steve opened his mouth to answer but the shop owner and Bucky chose that moment to come around the racks to join them.
He was cute from a distance, but heart-stoppingly handsome up close. His big brown eyes twinkled with a little mischief, and he cut a fine figure in his suit. It looked closely tailored, the charcoal gray wool cutting in at his waist and curving over his rear.
Steve stood, pulling Tony up with him and into another quick kiss. “We better hurry, Sarah said the cake’s predictions come true within a year.”
to flirt…” He turned his head to nod at the vase full of this week's flowers. Steve had picked out bright pink and red roses this time. He wanted to make a bold move now that summer was coming to an end and Peter was going to have homework over the weekends that would make visits harder to plan.
Nights were hard without Tony by his side. Waking up was worse. Steve eyed the empty side of the bed and felt his husband's absence already. It wasn't as bad as when they'd first started seeing one another; that panic-induced loneliness was now just a minor ache that kept him from falling back to sleep.
“Next week. All the clubs are giving demonstrations, we want to have him do three moves by then. But I’m not sure how he is going to be able to dab with only one arm,” Peter said with a very serious look on his face.
“And if I want to?” He snapped a strap wrapping around Tony’s right thigh. That earned him a small squeak-- he wanted more. “You’re my present to open as I wish. And if I want to ruin you,” Steve tugged on Tony’s cheeks, licking a stripe up over Tony’s hole through the lace before continuing, “is that a problem?”
Steve adjusted the knot on his tie and gave himself one last look at the pink and gray suit before pushing through the fitting room curtain. “Well, Buck, is this gay enough?”
“You still can later, if you want,” Steve said with a wink. “I wouldn’t say no to getting to find out how it feels to get those curls under my hands.”
Photos took forever; there was a seemingly endless list of shots to get while the guests had cocktail hour in the atrium, but finally they were allowed to go socialize while Sam and Bucky made the rounds. Steve escorted Nat to the bar for their own drinks before depositing her with Clint and his wife to go find Tony.
Steve’s climax felt like a tug from his sternum to his cock, pleasure sparkling down his nerves before combusting. The heat and pillowy velvet of Tony’s mouth welcoming him down his throat until he was wrung near over-stimulation. Steve let himself thump backwards fully, chest heaving.
Tony got up from the table, grabbing his drink and blowing out the candle, “I need to go talk with Uncle Steve. Don’t play with fire without an adult. But! You can still balance the forks on a toothpick on the edge of a glass.”
He didn't used to get choked up by flowers but Tony certainly knew how to make a guy feel special in a way that Steve hadn't before. Steve smiled and caressed the flower petals with a light touch before opening the letter, the words nestling into his heart. For all the words that Tony was good at blurting out, he knew how to find the ones that mattered when it counted.
“Please, like I’ve said, call me Tony,” he said, plucking his gloves off and giving Steve a wink. “Did my copy of Daily Rituals for The Modern Wizard come in?”
“Oh, I heard about that, such a freak accident.” The man walked over, pushing his sunglasses up into his hair, “Mark here will take good care of you.”
“Patience, love, can’t fuck my face if I’m up here playing tonsil hockey,” Tony chided. The way the curls flopped under their own thick weight made him look soft against the pillow, but against the background of him crawling downwards to Steve’s aching cock-- it was sex hair, and
They pulled back. Steve greedily scented the air one more time, sure his eyes were sparking with alpha pheromones. His body hadn’t reacted to anothers like this since that night he left. It was almost too strong, too quick to get hard and ready to mate. Tony’s eyes glinted back in the dim light of the living room lamps. He tilted his head, baring his neck in the way that always drove Steve wild, baring his bonding gland.
“Did you enjoy your present?” Tony asked, crawling over Steve’s body, laying on his chest and nestling his head under Steve’s chin.
“Yup. And the other morning, Buck came downstairs in Air Force boxers, grabbed two coffees and the orange juice and went back upstairs. I don’t think he knew I hadn’t left for my drive up here yet.”
“Okay, fine. If Papa wants to, ok? Now go wash up, dinner is ready.” Tony let Peter go before standing up. “Do you wanna stay for dinner, Steve? I’m no cook, but it’s lasagna. Hard to screw up.”
Tony shuffled his bare feet a little, tucking his hands in his pockets. “I just thought, maybe we adults should catch up? If you want. Unless,” color flooded his cheeks, “unless I’ve been reading your signals wrong? I mean, I know how you
“His mom, actually.” Steve said. He let out a laugh at the look of pure confusion on Tony’s face before continuing. “We were young, and we were going to put him up for adoption. But that first moment I held him. I couldn’t let him go. She wasn’t ready to be a mom, so I did it on my own.”
“Perfect, maybe we can set up a time for an appointment to go over what direction you’d like to go? I’m going to push for my alma mater, but we can look at what those dinks at CalTech can offer if you want to break my heart,” Tony said with a wink. “Would you or Peter’s mom like to attend those meetings? I’m pretty flexible.”
"Well, I thought we could spend some time before you jet off. I have your favorite thing starting with “D” upstairs.”
Tony laughed, eyes crinkling at the corners, “Nothing sends a message like a little mustard gas.” The medic put the clapped Tony on the shoulder to send him on his way. “And you, Mr. Rogers, I should give you detention for going back into that building.”
“Like it? Honey, you look like your brain is going to leak out of your ears, and that’s exactly why I wore it. I wanted to give you a little early anniversary present before you’re away this week,” Tony ended his words a little quietly, no longer looking Steve in the eyes and plucking at some lint on his shirt.
A quick huff of laughter cracked out of Steve before he threw a hand over his own mouth to stifle it. His always perfectly groomed to an inch of his life husband was a mess of salt and pepper curls on the pillow. His usually sharp knife’s edge goatee was lost in a scruffy little beard sprinkled with silver. Everything was so soft. His lashes dark fans on his cheeks and lips parted slightly with his slow, even breathing. It was adorable, and a whole new side of Tony.
He bent and kissed Tony, slow and purposeful. The kiss of someone wanting to absorb every sweet moment, of wanting to convey a thousand apologies. He paused before bringing their lips together again, kissing him like a thirsty man tasting his first sip of water, a little wild and sloppy and devouring.
“I don’t know, the reaction was so fast, and he told us to go, and we thought he was right behind us, he pulled the fire alarm and,” Ned paused. There were other voices talking to him.
A swarm of thoughts rushed forward as he got his bag in the entryway, of headlines and young lives changed in seconds and all the horrors Peter told him of drills and and and…
He spotted Ned and MJ waving their arms next to an ambulance. Peter sat on the floor of the vehicle, skinny legs dangling off the back. Steve let go of the breath he’d been holding, feeling like the first breath he’d taken since Ned’s call once he caught Peter’s eyes as he ran. His form looked small and curved in on itself and covered in a blanket under the strobing lights. The medics parted and he vaguely heard them say he could touch him over the chaos of everyone speaking at once.
Steve laughed and captured Tony’s lips again. He dragged his fingers through the slick collecting between them and coated his cock. He took his time, rocking forward and back.
He bent low, brushing the curls back from Tony’s forehead before pressing a soft kiss there. He rubbed his thumb over the hair under his hand, pressing more kisses to Tony’s face until he stirred.
Peter grabbed his backpack, slinging it over one shoulder before enveloping his dad in a hug. “I can take the bus just fine. You need to finish getting ready for your first day too.”
Peter nodded, “I’m sorry, and I’m sorry I knocked the beakers over. I should have moved the bleach to another table.” He looked tired and exhausted and miserable.
Steve ran one of his hands through Tony’s dark locks and held himself up on the elbow of his other arm as Tony got his zip undone. “Yeah, I do.
“Yeah, I think I would have remembered if you had gotten letters about a son while we were stationed. And since you were so convinced he’d moved on and wouldn’t want you after the army spit you out...”
Sam grabbed the last chair at the table, smoothies forgotten. “Steve, you have some rights as the sire here, and I don’t think Tony, no matter how mad he is at you, would deny you getting to know Peter. He said to call him and you guys could talk.”
Steve was a crier at weddings. The swell of emotion watching someone at their ceremony, their hands trembling when taking the ring from their attendant, their wobbly words as they recite their vows. The first time Sam’s voice cracked had set off everyone else in the party like a line of sobbing dominoes, and Steve was glad that Nat had made them each store a handkerchief up their sleeves.
. He kissed the divot in Tony’s chest and continued down, tasting the coffee and coconut in the sweat on the skin of his hip.
They both laughed, Tony’s hand tightened in Steve’s. “What do you say? My weekend grading will need to dry out, so I find myself pretty free.”
Steve brushed his bangs from his forehead with a huff. Did that group of rowdy elven youths have to touch
“Yup,” Tony replied, popping the ‘P’ before taking a sip of his own water. “I still have his ultrasounds, I saved everything. If you want to see.”
“Nothing! Nothing important, Mr. Stark,” Steve said. He moved so Bucky could put Tony’s drink on the counter. “Is there anything else we can get for you?”
The bedroom swept out in front of him as he crested the steps, the door open and lights on and dimmed. The bed dominated the space with a lone bedside table on each side. Happy had come with his luggage and set it closer to the ensuite and closet, but as Tony walked closer, it looked like he had also brought something else. A present, wrapped in silver and white paper and a silver bow, sat squarely on the pillow on his side of the bed with a cream envelope balanced delicately on top.
Tony nodded before continuing, “I was scared. Every adult in my life shut me out and turned me away… Except for Mr. and Mrs. Rhodes. She flew up after the birth to show me how to change a diaper and get him to latch, and ended up staying for three weeks. I wrote to any address for the army I could find. Rhodey helped as much as he could from the Air Force side, without breaking any laws.”
“Fine. You look like a thot,” Steve replied, finally touching, placing his hand on Tony’s bare back under the cropped edge and crushing their bodies together. “You look like a little sportsbunny looking to score a nice story for TMZ and I wish I didn’t like it as much as I do.”
He never could have predicted a year ago that he’d be here, Tony slotting into his and Peter’s life like a puzzle piece that had been lost all these years. Soon, they’d have to get up and shower, be presentable enough for facetime and Peter’s daily recap of the sights of NYC, but for now, he’s content to lay here with Tony in his arms.
“I love midnight berries!” Steve blurted out. Lowering his volume a little before continuing, “I’d love to join you, Mr. Stark.”
Not wanting to dawdle in the solitude, Steve got out of bed and started his routine for the morning; shower, warm-up, out for a run. He thought about the news he couldn't wait to talk about once he gets a call from Tony. It's why coming home to find Tony's surprise to him brought with it a pleasant joy.
Tony chuckled a little before closing the distance between them. “Steve. You didn’t know. You said it yourself after looking through what the Army sent back. Someone there didn’t want you to know, and that sucks, they shouldn’t have gotten to make that decision. I mean, I kind of wish I could give them a piece of my mind, my pup didn’t get to know his sire was even alive for his whole life! But I’m not mad at you for that.”
“Oh my God, I wish I had recorded his face. I think he went purple when Mother and I got back from the doctor.”
- an omega standing back from the group wrapped up in a black pea coat. The styled black hair and goatee were different from the crazy mop of curls and bare baby face of ten years ago, but it was him. His profile the same as the one Steve saw in his dreams, memories replayed of love and ache and the sweet twist of pleasure on his face every time Steve knotted him. The reason why Steve switched to tea, so he could make it through a morning without embarrassing himself in front of his squad and roommates.
The lights of the Malibu house flickered to life as Tony walked in. It wasn’t the same as the cliff-side mansion, but rebuilding had given Tony plenty of opportunity to upgrade JARVIS’ wiring and capability to match Avenger’s Tower. He dropped himself off at the reactor plant straight from the plane and worked through most of the night on caffeine and the pull of engineering.
“Well, he’s got a good head on his shoulders, you should be proud. I think he’s a great fit for MIT, if he wants it. He’ll have to do some test prep for the ACT and SAT.”
He arranged to have his gift, the letter, and some flowers delivered as a surprise in the morning for Steve to find when Tony knew he’d be missing him the most. He thought a hand-written letter would be more meaningful to Steve than transcribing something for JARVIS to print out, but other than scribbling out a signature, he hadn’t needed to write by hand in years. The movements felt rusty and stilted.
"It is, ma'am," Steve responded, catching himself when he started to nod. For a second, there was a stab of fear that this was a bad call to let them know they wouldn't be allowed or able to adopt. It was an irrational thing but he couldn't stop the doubt.
Peter’s messy hair and grinning face came through the arch into the kitchen a moment later. “Smells good.”
His mind tumbled during the drive from D.C. to New York City, turning over every memory of his time in the army for a clue, any mail he never opened or calls he didn’t take. Bucky and he rose through the ranks until he was captaining his own group of commandos for ops that were now more black bars than reports, if not shredded completely. Could General Phillips have kept his son from him? The commandos were all alphas with little left at home, except for Bucky’s mom. He wouldn’t have made it onto the team if Steve didn’t push, if Buck’s own bullheaded drive to protect Steve didn’t force Phillips’ hand.
“Okay, who died then?” She dropped a book and her phone on the table. Her clean linen beta scent washed over the room to cover his reek of distress.
Steve laughed and tucked his head into Tony’s neck, breathing in his clean scent. “I will probably be run ragged by Coach and collapse before I can shower, but knock yourself out. We’ll get room service.”
The sight of Tony walking towards him was one Steve revisited countless times over the years, one he prayed to see again, but not this version of him, older and wary, hands tucked in his coat pockets.
In a flash, the blanket flew up and over, covering Tony completely. “You weren’t supposed to be home until tomorrow!”
“Then what are you going to do about what, Stevie? I had to pop into the kitchen for more mandrake macaroons before Stark showed up.”
Steve set two glasses of water down and joined his son at the table, “It’s not very nice to call anyone a dummy, Peter.” “It’s his name,” Peter explained, “D-U-M-Dash-E. You can meet him at Parent Night.”
Steve chuckled as he wound some noodles around his fork. Each week brought out this new side of Peter, engaged in his passions instead of hiding them, growing into who he wanted to be, and Steve knew he had the famous Mr. Stark to thank.
“I tried to. I sent you, God, I don’t know how many letters, Steve. And pictures. They all came back in a big file. No note. No word on if you were alive and you just…didn't want us, or if your CO was just cleaning out your things. Nothing.” Tony spat out the last word, eyes stormy. “Look, I don’t want to cause a scene. Or ruin his field trip, he’s been excited for this for three months. Call me, and we’ll talk. But just...not now.”
Steve got lost in the motions of kissing every inch of Tony’s skin he uncovered, of touching and being touched. He picked Tony up and laid him on the bed, naked and wanting and reaching out to pull Steve on top of him. Their scents were heady together and the familiar hunger lit in his belly. His instincts blurred red with
Steve wanted three things in rapid succession: To see Tony, to eat his weight in pancakes, then sleep it off for the rest of the day. He nudged the door to the bedroom open, the room still dark. Jarvis must have some instructions to keep the windows blackened until Tony wakes up. And there, curled up in the pillows and blankets, was his sleeping husband, and he was--
“Yeah, Mr. Stark built these robots. And they are so cool, and they learn, just like us.” Peter rambled. Steve dished him up a plate, and a more moderate ‘man in his mid thirties’ portion for himself. “We got to teach Dum-e how to dance.”
“Spaghetti ala Rogers,” Steve said, stirring the sauce one more time. “How was club? Did Mr. Stark blow anything up this time?”
“Honestly, I think you look adorable. Look at all this fluff?” He ran his hand through the strands sticking out of the blanket, “You’ve got amazing curls.”
"Oh, yes, Cap--Steve," Happy nodded, "Ms. Potts points out quite a lot that he's become more of the sentimental type since you've gotten together. I have to agree with her, and not just because she pays my salary."
Steve wasn't sure what to do with this new information, but it'd have to wait. He needed to make sure no one ended up in the pond behind the officiant, including the officiant, and that he wasn't the source of any 'wedding disasters' stories.
He looked at the stairs to the bedroom and contemplated sleeping on the couch. Neither his back nor his husband would let him live that down. He shed his shirt as he walked up the stairs. He smelled like ozone and oil, but a shower would have to wait for morning as jet lag quickly demanded sleep.
He started to move. Tony’s hips met him with each thrust. He could feel his knot starting to swell, the tingle of rut at the base of his spine branching outwards along his nerves like spilled ink. Tony’s cries urged him faster, the need to satisfy his omega, to have him come on his knot was the only thought racing through his brain. The hand not holding himself up was full of Tony’s ass and thigh, spreading him open until his knot caught at the rim of his hole. Tony stifled his cry with the flesh of his palm, back arched and body clutching at Steve.
“I’ll kick your ass on the plane tomorrow.” The ding of the call disconnecting came before the thunk of the phone hitting the nearest table.
“You’re it for me, Steve. I tried, I really did. Anyone who was willing to fuck an unmated O with a pup waiting for them back home. It was like my body rejected them. Dried up like the Sahara down there,” Tony chuckled. “I dated a beta for a year or two, but turns out she just wanted to pilfer my workshop for stuff to sell.”
Steve stepped off the elevator and kicked off the gym shoes he’d changed into for the flight back. He ditched the weight of the shield carrier bag and his duffle there as well. He could feel the month’s worth of grime and sweat still on his skin, even after the lengthy shower at the hotel before the flight. He padded across the penthouse. There were a few dishes scattered about, a blanket on the couch balled up-- proof his husband didn’t spend the entire time he was gone cooped up in the workshop welding and hammering out his anxiety over the mission.
Tony peeled the blanket back enough to glare at Steve. “Pepper gave me the month off of meetings so I could work on all the new launches and equipment upgrades since I’d be essentially watching the clock until you got home.”
Steve had grabbed the empty stool next to the Leeds and watched Peter and the other kids work. From the chatter he could overhear, the robot arm had slipped out of the joint during rehearsal. After a few last adjustments, they all stood back.
Steve took the lid off the box and started picking through the contents. Letters, photos and battered envelopes formed a timeline of Peter’s early life. There were a few ultrasounds, the bean getting bigger and more baby shaped. One of Peter swaddled and an angry red color on his face, newly born and obviously mad about it. Others of a tiny face peeking out of a snowsuit, of Tony holding him, both bundled up against the New York Winter he was born in. They were a flipbook of time passing, of Peter’s face changing from baby to toddler, all smiles and big brown doe eyes just like his birth parent.
“Thank you,” Tony said as he swiftly grabbed some blueprints to cover up his disastrous attempts, “You’re a lifesaver.”
Steve’s work bag thumped the floor, followed quickly by his keys into the dish in the entryway. He picked up Peter’s jacket he must have gotten knocked down this morning from the floor, gathered up a few pieces of mail that never made it to the office, and made a few trips to put away the groceries from the car. He hoped he had everything he needed for bringing snacks and brownies down to the school tonight. The end of the year party was due to start in an hour, so he needed to hustle to get house groceries sorted and put away and pack the rest up and beat traffic.
“Yes, I’ll bring it up front for when you’re ready to check out.” Steve walked as fast as his legs could carry him to the stockroom door. He could just dump the books there and put them away later. Steve waited until Tony’s velvety red cloak disappeared into the potion section before creeping out to the cafe side of the shop.
He dove back in to the sound of Tony’s whine in his ears, soaking the lace and using it between his tongue and Tony’s hole to drive him crazy. Finally, he inched the fabric down until it snapped under Tony’s ass, scratching it down on the bites he left earlier. The front was still caught on Tony’s cock, so Steve reached up and squeezed lightly. Tony’s legs quivered but held as Steve massaged him through the material and licked him from the back.
He set his husband’s clothes to rights and listened to the soft murmurs and rapidly slowing breaths coming from his mouth before he crawled up and over to settle in. He cuddled Tony close to drop soft kisses on every spare bit of skin he could reach. Tony’s beard was textured but soft, still conditioned and oiled but just so much
The door swung open on a wave of Tony’s scent. It was smooth, and so so bright in Steve’s nostrils. He must spend a lot of time at home for it to be etched so deeply into the hardwood floors. “Steve, come in. Did you have a safe drive up?”
Steve felt a warmth inside at that, that Tony was funny and smart and comfortable with the kids that called him Uncle and held so much of his heart. “Can I steal you?”
Tony turned toward him, indulgently orgasm loose and pliant, and made a valiant attempt to lick his own flavor from every nook of Steve’s mouth. Steve’s head spun, Tony’s hand and thigh between his legs ratcheting him higher until he pulled away to Steve’s frustrated groan.
A huff loud enough to be heard through the duvet puffed the fabric out for a moment. “Vincent is coming this morning to fix...all this. You weren’t supposed to see.”
“Peter.” Bucky said it reverently. It struck Steve that this was big news for Bucky too, being practically brothers, and knowing Tony for years as well. Peter would be like a nephew.
“Jesus,” Steve swore. It had been a while since he’d been this speechless. What had happened was some vestigial biological process coded deep into their genetics from the days when people needed to form a pack for protection, when omegas needed to secure an alpha so they didn’t  die out in the elements or get eaten by saber-toothed tigers.
It'd taken Steve an agonizing week to really do it, even with its simplicity. But he'd wanted it to be perfect. He'd taken to a smaller canvas size so it wouldn't be ostentatious, fretted over the colors so they'd be just right, and worked through his cramping hand until it was done the way he wanted it to look.
“Gonna come baby?” Tony’s cock twitching in his palm was all the answer he needed. “Did you bring lube with you?”
Steve ran his hands across all the skin he could find. He snaked his hands up under the jersey and traced the shape of Tony’s chest with the edge of a nail. He dragged it around the border of the bralette as Tony shuddered in place. He cupped the muscle he found and squeezed, worrying Tony’s nipples through the lace while dropping kisses down his neck and exposed shoulder.
A subtle beep from JARVIS, like a digital clearing of his throat, brought Tony’s head up. “What is it, J?”
“I’d love to. I’ll go wash up too,” Steve answered. He ached to end his words with a kiss to Tony’s cheek, top off the domesticity of it all. To be a little family.
Steve stepped out of the elevator a moment later, looking as fresh and as put together as always. He had on one of the navy sweaters that hugged his chest and drove Tony crazy.
He leaned in, feeling Tony’s smile on his as they connected. It was light and fleeting, like the flutter of wings, but the beautiful beginning of something better. Steve could see gold in Tony’s eyes when they parted, the amber light of the garden casting an enchanting glow over them both.
“I dunno, they are practically mated already. I don’t think they are in any rush. Also I’m not entirely sure about how Sam fits in with them yet.”
Steve nodded and swallowed the lump in his throat. “A son. I never thought that’d ever happen.” He paused for a moment, everything settling over him like a blanket. “I wish Ma was here.”
Bucky adjusted his sleeves and grabbed Sam’s cuffs, checking them over. “We met him at the suit shop.”
“Yup. My hormones went into overdrive in an effort to get my alpha to stay and mate me. A bit of an underhanded attack for my body to make without my consent, but here we are.”
Happy grinned at Steve as he took the letter and present from the blond. "He's going to love them, Captain Rogers."
“Anxious to finish, so he rushes, see it all the time. But we can work on that,” Tony said with a smile.
Tony smiled, soft but also full of promise in a way that it felt like they were alone. “Time and place?”
“Boy next door my ass,” Tony griped. Steve retaliated by snapping one of the jockstraps again. “Literally.”
Steve tossed his hands up and pulled out a chair at the table. He sat, folding his head into his arms. “He doesn’t want me, not now at least. He thinks I knew this whole time. I have no right to be in his life. This child hasn’t known his sire for nearly 10 years. He thinks I returned the letters to reject him and Peter.”
“No, he’s right,” Sam interjected. “I mean, it’s why you’re here and not back in NYC. Why you won’t go back to visit Mrs. Barnes. It would be too easy to look him up.”
“Yeah,” Tony replied. He put his forehead against Steve’s chest, “My body isn’t the same, though. I mean, a pup and then ten years, but--”
“Mr. Rogers, thank God you answered!” Steve could hear sirens. His keys were in hand, the front door slammed behind him.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m America’s golden boy. Captain of America’s team. Boy next door.” Steve spoke between nips and sucking little marks across Tony’s golden skin like a little trail, each one netting him a gasp or whine or nonverbal stutter of the hips between his hands.
display and leave things on the high shelves as they left? He kicked the library stool towards the last shelf, all of their other leavings piled into his arms when the overhead door chime tinkled again. A tall shadow fell over Steve. Before he could get on the stool to grab the last book, the newest visitor to Mages and Pages Cafe reached over his head and plucked the book from its perch.
“He does. We kept in touch over the years, she would always drop by for his birthday. Now that he’s older, she takes him every once and a while. She lives in Queens and they do city stuff when he’s on summer break, does all the fun aunt stuff.”
A small boy clung to Tony’s side, drawing his attention away from Steve. Sandy brown hair, skinny, and even though he had Tony’s brown eyes-- it was like looking in a discolored photo of himself at that age. The way his nose sloped and his smile crooked up at the corners. Steve felt his own face move into that smile.
“Agreed. Can’t have you going out in a lab accident, Mr. Stark,” Steve said. Tony caught his eyes, and smiled again. Tony who was safe and whole and the last of the tension melted away as he reached out and Tony’s hand slid securely into place.
“I haven’t,” Tony gulped, taking a moment to choose his words. “I haven’t had another alpha since you.”
Steve’s breath left his lungs with a whistle. Bent over the counter island in the kitchen was Tony. Tony-- wearing the blue, white and red of his home jersey, his number 45 big and bold across his back, the fabric cut just below there to show the sleek muscle of Tony’s back before sloping to his rounded ass veiled in white lace. Satiny straps that mimicked a jockstrap around his thighs lifted and accentuated his assets, everything standing out against his tan olive skin.
It stopped, starting again a few seconds later. All the hair on Steve’s arms raised in goosebumps, no one called again so fast unless it was an emergency.
“Okay,” Tony agreed. “And yes to the beard, by the way. Grow that out again.” His fingers found the buttons on Steve’s shirt.
“You’re a life saver, Markypoo.” Tony said. He gave a small wave at Bucky, “Mazel tov on the upcoming nuptials.” Tony met Steve’s eyes one last time and gave an exaggerated ogle and a wink, “And you--keep the beard.”
“I always wanted something that was mine. That I built. That no one, especially Howard, could take away from me.” Tony looked away then, “I always thought that would be my own tech company. Until I was sitting on Mother’s stiff couch in the parlor, holding my belly in one hand and an ultrasound in the other.”
Tony let him stay there as his breaths slowed to normal, stroking his hair like a child. When Steve could get his voice under control, he spoke, “Tell me about him.”
Steve had started a list of questions to ask. What was Peter’s birthday? His favorite flavor of ice cream? Was he doing well in school? Did he inherit any of Steve’s sickness that kept him skinny until the alpha hormones kicked in?
Finally, he was at Tony’s door. His apartment was one of two on this floor, quiet and well protected for an unmated omega and his pup to live alone. Steve noted all the security cameras as well and the itch to protect what was his, or what his alpha hindbrain thought was his, abated.
His feet ate up the ground toward the Lincoln Memorial. A bus-full of children were gathering at the memorial, parents hanging back hugging their travel mugs like lifelines. He turned the corner and stuck close to the pool’s low wall. He knew his size and scent as an alpha could be perceived as a threat subconsciously. His body pumped out pheromones in the sweat pouring down his face.
“Thank God he at least put on boxers.” Tony looked up, his eyes were bright and twinkled in the city lights from the window. “Wanna see if I can still make you come a second time while you’re knotted?” Tony’s body rocked against his, challenge in his eyes now.
Tony’s drink grumbled and spat lightning in the silence of the cafe. Time stretched awkwardly as Steve cycled through how to respond.
Peter had failed to mention, all of the hundreds of times he talked about his science teacher, that Mr. Stark was a total smokeshow, as the kids were saying. The last thing Steve expected when he walked through the doors of the classroom was a handsome man about his own age with a finely cut goatee and safety goggles pushing up his ridiculously messy hair. The Mr. Stark in his mind was pushing 65, balding and wore exclusively hideously itchy brown knit sweaters and pants with creases ironed into them.
A gloved hand wrapped in deep maroon leather held the book out. Miranda Mayflower’s guide to Meeting Magical Men.
Steve pulled Tony into a hug, and Tony let himself be pulled. He squeezed tightly, offering silent comfort. He heard a small click and woosh of the front door being opened.
Steve thought. He looked around and didn’t see his friend anywhere, but off to the side of the racks was a dark haired man who lifted his sunglasses up to give Steve the once-over with a whistle.
He kept his focus during the ceremony, not missing any of his cues from Carol from being a blubbery mess. He didn’t drop the ring, or trip while escorting Mama Barnes to her seat. It wasn’t until his best friends were declared lawfully wed and presented to the world as Mr. and Mr. Barnes-Wilson that Steve even looked out at the crowd gathered as witnesses. There, in the back with his shades on, was Tony. The gorgeous man from the tailors, and a billionaire apparently, who
“Sorry about your bro date. I know you didn’t want to see Fast Cars 11 or whatever they’re called. I’ll make it up to him.”
“Dad, can I call Aunt May about it? I just want her to know,” Peter looked at him with those pleading puppy eyes Steve never could resist.
“Yeah, bud, go tell her the good news.” He and Tony watched Peter go out into the hallway to make the call before turning back to face each other. “Thank you so much, Mr. Stark. Peter has really bloomed, and I know it was because of you. He talks more about you than any other teacher, this club means so much to him.”
“Black chocolate cake, with a mousse of midnight berries and full moon dust, topped with midnight berry frosting and curled starlight shards.”
“Yeah, I hit traffic once or twice, but it was fine.” He followed Tony down the entryway until they hit a larger living space. “Shoes on or off?”
Tony made eye contact again and smiled, “Yeah. Bouncing baby boy, six pounds, 2 ounces. They tested him for everything I could remember you saying you’d had growing up. He’s fine, he’s always been perfectly fine.”
“Well, Uncle Bucky is going to tan your hide when he hears this. When he goes into a rescue, he’s got fifty pounds of gear on and years of training.”
Steve chuckled, “I, uh… I have to confess that I didn’t know who you were until about five minutes before the ceremony, so I am still a little stunned you showed up, but I’m so glad you did.”
“Well, I’m not in heat, but we all know how well that went last time. I don’t have any, or if I do they are sorely expired.”
Steve thought. Even when you’ve earned more than you ever imagined by doing what you loved, it was hard to part with the wisdom learned from the Sarah Rogers and Winifred Barnes School of Life.
Tony hummed and rocked Steve a little as he thought. “His favorite color is red. He likes learning and school. He’s so smart, Steve. And he has a good eye for art, I always say he got it from you. He is obsessed with taking pictures. I actually got him a cheap camera for Christmas last year, he treats it like a thousand dollar DSLR.” A laugh tumbled out of him then, obviously some private inside joke between him and their son.
“And what do we have here?” He wouldn’t say he stalked toward Tony, but he could tell by the smug look on Tony’s face that he was looking a little feral around the edges advancing on his boyfriend dressed like one of his biggest fantasies. Barefoot and scantily covered in lace and his jersey.
“Sorry! I didn’t plan this,” Steve said with a grin. “How about I run out in the morning for Plan B and Bagels?”
Tony scribbled out the letters on the page with a little more force than necessary. This shouldn’t be
They both dissolved into giggles by the end of the story, the vibrations tugged at where their bodies were joined turning their giggles into choked off moans.
“Fuck. I’m so sorry, Tony. You went through so much.” Steve swore under his breath, “It’s killing me that you faced all of this alone.”
“They met him once. They showed up at the apartment one day around my birthday. I think Mother put her foot down wanting to see me. But they never came over again, and then...well I guess I should have known you didn’t know.”
He looked over the dessert display for a moment before pointing to a deep indigo cake, “What’s in the Darkest Night Torte?”
A soft chuckle escaped as the anxiety in Steve's chest loosened. "Thanks, Happy." As Happy started to walk away, Steve's cell phone went off. He pulled it out of his pocket and turned away from the driver. "This is Steve Stark-Rogers.."
He dropped his things off at Mamma Barnes’, having left enough time for a tongue lashing about his delayed homecoming and to stop for a bouquet before heading to Manhattan to meet Tony. The doorman let him in, and each floor the elevator passed made the weight of anxiety in his stomach grow.
“Well, you look like you got run over by the presidential motorcade, so maybe we should,” Bucky said entering the room.
