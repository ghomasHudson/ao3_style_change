“Nah, nothing like that. I called Dr. Patil, and she was happy to start me on the anxiety meds again just in case. I’ve got those in the cupboard, but there’s been no trouble yet.”
Tony nodded, flipping through slowly and trying not to exclaim over every page. “So what’s after school? Like what’s your dream?”
Christmas is here, and Steve gets to meet Tony's platonic Soulmates. But it seems that someone is out to get them, and they'll need help.
“Okay, so smile at the cameras, let Tony answer the questions, don’t play phone games, and don’t get drunk. Got it.”
Tony smiled and looked at his scarred hand and how it had stopped trembling. “Thank you,” He murmured. “It’s perfect. I have a confession, though.”
“Don’t worry. These ladies are the best. They fitted me for every outlandish thing I’ve done since 2003. They’ll love you. Honestly I feel like I’m taking you to meet my parents, but with less louring and judgement.”
“Because I’ll come in three minutes if we spice it up at this point. You can record your own data, just minus the lab coat.”
“I guess that’s why before I started transitioning, I kept being called a ball-buster and things like that. I easily took charge on projects or in games, and people kept saying ‘you’re a girl, you shouldn’t do that’. My Irish grandmother visited once, and even said ‘a lady doesn’t bark orders like a man’.” Steve chuckled. “Joke’s on them, because I wasn’t a girl at all.”
Tony got up and paced, the soles of his shoes crackling over shattered remains. He had been semi-subconsciously hoping that he could sorta-kinda bully Bruce into telling him what he wanted to hear to make him go away and let him wallow in his misunderstood-genius torments for a few more days. Long sighs and self-pity had seemed like a terrible-but-livable plan. Apparently the media blitz had run the mild-mannered doctor completely out of fucks to give for his nonsense.
Clint wiggled happily in his chair. “Aw, that’s so great. It’s great that you could be honest and it was ok. That’s a great feeling.” He glanced at the ceiling and his smile became sly again. “Bucky and I did. Wanna know where?”
Steve sighed. “Since he liked the car sketches before, I think it’s only fair that he sees my other work.”
“Seeing you for the first time, I wondered how the hell I could be Soulmates with someone as beautiful as that, and then you were actually invested in what I was saying. I knew you would stick around when on our second date, you didn’t care about me being trans. And after everything we’ve been through, from the press to the kidnapping, it feels only right to ask you an important question.” Steve got down on one knee, and held out the box. “Tony, will you marry me?”
“That the other shoe is due to drop any day now? Ugh, I’m sorry, man, I’m not trying to be difficult but this is serious Scylla and Charybdis time.”
For a moment, Steve just stilled inside of Tony and enjoyed the sensations. He was hot, wet, and tight, and Steve could feel every bit of it. He lightly pulled at one of Tony’s ass cheeks and pulled out painfully slow.
Steve leaned back in his chair and had a contemplative look on his face. Sometimes it was hard to remember every single issue he’d been diagnosed with in the past.
“Something like that. The entertainment press aren’t like fans, though. It’s more of a dance. They know that it’s good for them if they can stretch the story out a little. So if you let them know they’ll be on the inside for big developments, they’re less likely to try to harass the golden goose to death. It helps that I’ve been a pretty cooperative staple of their weekend sections for a while. There’s still the paparazzi to worry about. They’re just out to get anything they can, ecology of entertainment news be damned. But I think it’s gonna be ok.”
Tony moaned with mingled torment and delight. He loved the way Steve teased him, loved finding out which of them would start to press for a rhythm first. It felt good to let go of everything and just dive deep into how much he
“I guess… feeling more than just sexual attraction toward someone, and actually wanting to do things with them beyond the bedroom.”
For the occasion, he’d cleared a large section of the living room floor and had a pristine version of the front end of a SI roadster assembled and open for display. Bucky had agreed to take charge of taking off pieces and explaining the features for all the guests. He knew he was also showing off the lifelike capabilities and precision movements of his new arm, and he didn’t exactly love being in front of people, but Tony had made sure to keep the environment calm and cordial, and Bucky had to admit that being able to talk about his specialty made it easier to be in a crowd. The fact that Tony had cut him a fat consulting check didn’t hurt, either.
“Well that’s good to hear.” He wiped his eyes with a dirty hand and cleared his throat. “I’d really like you to keep the painting. I’d rather live in a world where it’s with you. My friend Pepper showed it to me and it was like it belonged to you in my head. I’ve already had my lawyer do the paperwork, you won’t have to pay a cent in taxes or anything. And if you’re worried about keeping it in good condition you could always lend it to a gallery. I just want you to have it. As a thank you. Because it’s like you reached right into my heart and pulled out exactly the piece of artwork I wanted and couldn’t do for myself, and there’s no paying for that, you know? I didn’t know what else to do.”
Steve rolled his eyes and went to the fridge. He hoped the jokes weren’t going to be a regular thing. Steve reheated the lasagna and sat at the breakfast bar to eat.
Tony rested his cheek against Steve’s, smelling his own preferred brand of shampoo and feeling selfishly, posessively gratified by the moment before letting it pass.
Tony chuckled. “More than that. Probably a lot more. There’s about fifty other rich assholes that have that same car right now, or have it on order. I’m the only guy in the world that gets to sit in this chair. At this table. With you. So stop acting like there’s a price tag for that, ok?”
Steve chuckled and snuggled carefully into Tony’s side, making sure to avoid any painful areas. He couldn’t help but notice how calm Tony was being despite what he had been through. After dating him for months, Steve had come to associate this kind of behavior with hiding how Tony felt.
“Just look me in the eye and say you know that you don’t understand. And I’ll trust you that we can handle it anyway.”
Tony narrowed his eyes like a gunslinger, hovering his hand over the pocket where he kept his phone. “You think you can dial faster than me, punk?”
“They figured out they’re Soulmates, simple as that, unless you want gratuitous details, in which case, I’ll have to pass.”
“Most of them did. And were terrified that they’d have every bone broken if they kept talking to me like that.”
Steve shrugged. “I was hurt, but I didn’t let it stop me from dating. I went on a few first dates, and at 25 I started dating a guy named Allen. He
“It happens sometimes.” Steve took out his phone and checked his reflection. Sure enough, there was a smudge near his right temple. “I should take a shower after this, anyway.”
Tony thought he had done a good job with his selection of a gift. Sophisticated, tasteful, maybe a little over-the-top but that was really just truth in advertising, he figured. So when Steve didn’t call, it started to eat at him from all sides. He triple-checked with the auction house and the security company that the crate had been delivered. He might have sortakinda taken a peek at call data to the garage, just to make sure their phones were working and someone was there. When nothing helped to solve the mystery, he decided to plow his nervous energy into building something in his lab.
Tony cracked his knuckles nervously and leaned his elbows on his knees. “I just think you need to know… that you don’t know. I mean, I know you’re smart. I don’t think you’re naive. But there’s just… you really don’t know what you’re getting into. It’s… I mean…” He dropped his head into his hands and sighed.
Steve laughed hard enough that he had to hold onto his stomach with his free hand. What the fuck was Tony building at his company in his free time?
Steve loved Sam, he really did, but the teasing was a bit much at times. However it was cancelled out by Steve being happy that he had company for once. Talking on the phone and talking to Jarvis only worked for so long.
By the time the second night rolled around, Steve got half of his homework done for his next week of classes. It was definitely difficult to do Physics without Dr. Banner’s help, but he managed (with some help from Jarvis). He had just finished making dinner for himself when Jarvis announced,
did, it’s what… this other guy did. There’s this kinda creepy guy who catcalls me, but he never actually makes a move, and most of the time what he says lacks the things you would typically expect in catcalling. Patrick was drunk and approached me while I was waiting for the train, and the creepy guy ended up scaring him enough that he peed himself on the way up to street level. He said his name’s Wade Wilson… and he seemed actually like a nice guy.”
And Steve hung up, smiling like an idiot and fist bumping the air. He fucking got a date with Tony Stark! He could actual do this!
“Yeah it is. So I’m thinking I should get to do whatever makes me, and the person most important to me, happy. So long as everything else is running smoothly.”
Steve could feel his eyes start to water, and discreetly rubbed them before he put the ring on. It fit perfectly, and he pulled Tony into a tight embrace.
“I bet you can lead. I bet you’d be great at it.” Tony rested his forehead against Steve’s and smiled. “I mean, really, how many ‘strikes’ do you give yourself when you fail before you decide that you can’t do it?”
Tony settled in next to Steve and purred. “Oh yeah, talk data analysis to me, baby. Let’s get non-parametric.”
“Well, I’ve been thinking about this all day, and realized I needed someone smarter than me. I had this great plan, but I’m feeling a little weird about it and I need you to check my math.”
Steve held on tight and kissed Tony’s cheek. “But I can’t promise I won’t smash a few cameras on occasion.”
He was fluent in PR and was telling the truth but he slowly coasted to a stop and felt the urge to say something crazy. It was too soon, and wildly unfair when he basically had Steve under a form of house arrest, but he couldn’t help wondering how Steve would react if he just dropped the press-packet explanation to admit
“I - I think it means we better see if we can get, like, a fucking humidor for fine art or something. We can’t have that thing just sitting around in here absorbing humidity and car exhaust and… and… fucking cooking fumes from curry night. Oh, and I think this Stark guy is a fucking lunatic, is what I think.”
Tony laughed and gulped. He had to swallow about six emotions all at once. Steve had such an engaging way of talking, and Tony always had a hard time not interrupting whenever he had a thought. But he’d been reading up on “active listening” because he wanted to be a better friend, and a better person, since meeting Steve. He smiled and coughed once.
Steve blushed, but smiled timidly. Usually he hated being called cute, it felt diminutive due to his size. But somehow coming from Tony, it felt genuine.
He sat back on the couch and thought about it. It was weird talking to an AI about his problems, especially Tony’s AI. But he didn’t exactly have anyone else to talk to at the moment. He just hoped Jarvis didn’t send everything to Tony.
Tony could feel the little divot between his eyebrows getting tighter. How could he explain to this guy what it does to your sense of self when playgirl magazine does a piece on you when you’re sixteen that includes a day-counter for how long until you’re legal, prompting a flood of fan mail more creepy than almost anything else from men and women twice your age? He shook his head and sighed again.
Somehow, Steve felt there was more to that, but he didn’t press it. He nodded and continued loading his plate with curry.
Clint got up, messing with his phone, and mussed Bucky’s hair as he passed him on the way to the kitchen. “There’s a lasagna in the fridge,” He grinned impishly back at the couch. “It’s made with loooove.”
As soon as Bucky got the top open, Steve rummaged through the paper for whatever was inside, and he felt… a frame, the type you would get for a painting. Okay, so he sent a painting, not a big deal. It was probably one of those modern artists he saw at Potts Gallery. Steve gently took the painting out and almost dropped it in his shock.
“The last one was Patrick. Usually he’d be dating girls, typical Frat boy type, except he actually helped me during a fight at one of the college bars. We struck up a conversation, which lead to actually dating, but I didn’t know why he wanted to have sex so badly. I wanted to wait because if my first two relationships were anything to go by, I didn’t want it to end so quickly. Turns out he was just acting nice to get a “tranny” on his list of people he’s had sex with. And I found out because I saw texts on his phone when he was in the bathroom, and I almost beat him unconscious, Bucky had to hold me back from hurting him any worse. So that’s why I was single for three years… and I hope you don’t do anything to track these guys down and make their life a living hell since I know you could do that if you wanted.”
Thank you for finishing this story. This may sound egotistical, but if you have any fanart or anything like that, tag me on Instagram or Twitter.
He took the top off the box to reveal a surprisingly tasteful display of six different high-quality packers, all in Steve’s skin-tone. Steve gasped, speechless. No one had ever done this for him before, he usually had to buy them himself. And he had no idea there was a store that sold this in New York City.
He got up and rummaged swiftly in the bedside drawer. The harness was elastic, to run under garments without shifting, but Tony managed to add an insert piece that was a rod sensor. It was a higher tech version of a censor that transmitted to Steve what the dildo was feeling.
“I’m not asking about people. I’m asking about you. Does my being a massive slut make you uncomfortable to be around me?”
right to the pit of his stomach and planted it where it could grow. He looked in Steve’s eyes and saw something unbreakable, something safe that couldn’t be touched by the imperfections of life. Something too good for the world. Something Steve was giving him freely, anyway. He squeezed Steve’s hands.
Tony knows who's been out to get him now, and he's not surprised. Steve and Nat take some advice from Wade, and the X-Men save the day.
He didn’t really want to go into it, how he was just too used to feeling things that weren’t real, how easily stress could cross his wires and leave him thinking he was feeling something when nothing was happening. So he just gave Steve a pleading look and asked,
Tony knocked on the door and held up his bag of indian take-out like a proud puppy. His face fell when Steve opened the door and the smell of steak wafted out.
Tony sighed and hung his head. “I get the feeling I’m Toby. Hold that thought. I’ll be right back, and I love a challenge.”
He held Steve a little closer and spun them around. “I gotta be me, I guess. Our press agent played it off as a joke, because I was in there with a girl as well as another guy. So the shots of me lip-locking him were passed off as a big embarrassing ‘oops! No homo!’ thing. But then the next time I was asked in person… I just… said it.”
With an exhale, Steve gave a small ‘ok’, but reached into the bedside drawer for the second lube they used for this. It was designed to look and feel like ejaculate, and Steve had almost come on the spot the first time they used it in the bedroom. He quickly put some into his hand and lubed up his rubber cock, then did something a little ballsy. He inserted the tip of the container into Tony, and squeezed out some of it.
Tony pressed his lips together. “Well, it’s complicated. Ok, for example. The first person I was ever publicly paired-up with was Pepper. It was right after I tried coming out to my dad for the first time and he,” His voice hitched and he plowed on. “He said I couldn’t so Pepper was my best friend and we had gone to bed a couple times, but she went out with me to make my dad happy and get the media off my ass. We were never a ‘real’ couple, but I still love her as much as I ever did, and always will. Does that count?”
Oh, right. The tackle box. Tossing back his second cup of coffee, he left the mug there and peeked into the hall to make sure Bruce wasn’t on his way back yet.
"It's...uh, different," Peter replied as neutrally as possible, swinging them down past a street sign and to the ground at last. Why did skyscrapers have to be so tall, anyway? "We're almost there, eheh."
"HE has the blanket!" The Clint pointed to the other. "But I'M the shirtless one. I can see who you think is real," he muttered accusingly, going right back to pacing.
He zapped the other shackle off without further comment, then grabbed one of Cap's arms and retreated out the door, dragging him along.
"Explod--guys, the most dangerous things where we're going are the bowl-sized margaritas!" Tony said, glancing over his shoulder at Hawkeye in the back. Through the back window, he could see the other identical SUV trailing after them with a weary-looking Hank Pym behind the wheel. "I'm not going to turn this car around, so just RELAX. If you even know how."
After Bruce took a quick blood sample with one of Tony’s specialized ‘Cap-functional’ needles, Steve shook his head.
"Don't worry mom—we put the sharp sticks away." He glared at the mortal man he was using for support, who smirked back.
“Well, we kind of ran right into him,” Peter said sheepishly, gaze drifting toward the campfire. Sighting Matt, his eyes grew wide. “Matt?”
It was hard to believe anybody could mistake that kind of volume for a computer. The black-haired man looked up finally and blinked like he wasn't sure Thor was real or not. Judging by the bags under his eyes, hallucinating from lack of sleep wasn't THAT out-there.
The rain pounded musically onto the roof of the cabin, mingling with the occasional swooshing gust of wind. With the heavy clouds outside, it was practically pitch black inside. The air felt thick and muggy, humid from the thunderstorm. Swiping wet hair out of his face, Peter laughed sheepishly.
Bruce stuck his hands in the pockets of the bright magenta shorts he'd borrowed from Clint since the green ones had mysteriously disappeared overnight. He shrugged his shoulders a little.
"Do you think that it's possible..." Loki paused, grabbing Bruce's hand and squeezing it. "...To think about someone so much that you fall in love with them?" The question was so far out of Loki's normal range that he surprised himself. Wow, now his head felt funny AND he felt woozy.
“Catch her!” The purple Avenger yelled, jumping to his feet—and further away from the Hulk as he dove out after the Enchantress.
Bucky drummed his fingers on the countertop. “You know, I seem to recall you saying that you told him you could handle it. If you’re gonna back out on that you should probably do it sooner rather than later.”
Tony’s face had slowly tightened at the top and gone slack around the jaw until he was genuinely gaping. “Jeez. That’s… wow. I know dating in New York is hard but that guy sounds like a prank show.”
She just looked unimpressed. “And who the hell needs a toothbrush robot, or whatever that thing with the toothbrush is?”
Steve was taken aback. Everything Tony had said made it seem like he slept around like the tabloids suggested. He never would have guessed that he’d… had a healthy amount of partners.
“No more questions.” Natasha cut in and ushered Tony into the building, meanwhile the reporters tried to get more questions in.
At the other end of the line, Bucky closed his office door and sat down behind his desk. “I hear you, buddy. Ok. So, I try not to big-brother you too much, because god knows you’ve saved my life more often than you’ve ever needed saving. But here’s my big brother and occasional himbo advice for you about this. You ready?”
Upon hearing Bucky’s words, Steve gently put the painting back into the crate, safely encased in it’s paper shreddings.
Tony shrugged one shoulder. “Yeah, sure. I’d love to.” He took the book with a stab of apprehension, unsure of whether things were going to become uncomfortably businesslike. “So do you have an official portfolio or are you mostly-?” He flipped the cover. “Oh wow, that’s really good. Your eye for composition, man, I gotta say. Where did you study?”
Tony smiled weakly and looked down at their piled hands. “Steve, I never learned how to deal with them. I mean, I know how to minimize the fallout. I know how to do the dance. But the actual… the way it felt, the way it feels, when they find something and dig their claws in. I don’t deal with it. I mean when I came out, and they ripped me up, I didn’t deal with that, I didn’t learn from it, I just escaped into myself. That’s kinda what I do.
Steve smiled, glad that Tony didn’t react badly to Wade’s part of the story. In actuality, he’d found out who the guy was and friended him on Facebook. He had more pop culture references on his timeline than Steve had ever seen, and was actually pretty funny. So Steve picked up a menu and looked at the selections.
Steve shrugged. “I wanted to join the army when I was 18, and get deployed with Bucky, but they said I had too many health issues to be enlisted. Art was more of a second option.”
Tony smiled at his own tremoring hand. “That would be good, Better if he’s willing to take me up on the offer of a job. But, yeah, I don’t feel like I did anything wrong changing direction. I feel like maybe this happened because I didn’t change fast enough. I don’t know. It’s not logical. Just that Stane asked me what I would be if I weren’t rich and gifted and famous, and all I keep thinking is that I’d be just like him. And that scares the shit out of me. Like I made him happen somehow.”
Tony grinned a little wistfully. “Yeah, I figured. I just wanted to hear you laugh again. Have you ever heard you laugh? It’s amazing.”
The elevator opened to Tony’s waiting room, and they went to his office. “Let’s be glad he has a terrifying temper that scares people. It’s great reporter repellant.”
“And it’s hardly half over.” He fumbled for the bedside TV remote. “Wanna watch some creepy stop-motion reindeer learn the value of sharing?”
Tony tried to maintain his fit of pique, keep his eyes on the exit and put his foot down, but Steve’s voice was just so disarming he couldn’t help just letting it go.
Steve looked at the box, intrigue showing clearly on his face. “Did you buy me some new shirts or something?”
Clint grinned. “Oh did you think you’re seeing the first test run of the arm? You’re adorable.” Clint gave Steve a wink and lifted up his shirt at the hip to show four perfectly formed light-blue finger marks. “I’m thinking of getting those as a tattoo.”
Tony whispered in Steve’s ear, “Ignore her. All software deveoloped from Jarvis has a no-murder protocol. So Bucky at least can’t murder you southpaw.”
Bucky laughed out loud. “The fuck you don’t, man. It’s like you roll out of bed every morning right off the set of the Andy Griffith show.”
Tony nodded, relieved. “Ok, good. I just… “ He sighed. “I haven’t always been the pillar of wokeness you see before you. And every mistake I’ve ever made is on film somewhere. And if you go digging,” He looked down. “I’ve been an asshole before. And I don’t want you to give me your blessing on that, I just… didn’t want you to be shocked. Not that I think there’s much that can actually shock you.”
Tony shrugged. “Well, I was kind of a small kid. And a multi-billion dollar company is a heck of an end.”
Eventually, the tuxedo was pinned in the right places and Steve changed out of it. He also deliberately got on his phone so he didn’t have a heart attack over the price of the tux. His commission work did decent enough so he could pay his half of the bills and rent, but he usually didn’t have much to spend on himself.
Bucky was grateful when Steve handed him the crowbar without objection. It usually meant Steve was in a reasonably good mood when he didn’t feel the need to insist he could perform feats of strength that really weren’t his forte.
“Wow, I gotta say, I was all prepared to be really impressed no matter what you handed me because I just like you that much, but now I’m a little intimidated. These are great.”
“It’s called vibranium. Fun stuff. On the inside it just says ‘My Hero’. Because you are.” He pivoted to turn Steve’s embrace into an impromptu dance as the rest of the room took the cue to start acting normal again, and the sound of a lot of champagne corks came from somewhere Steve wasn’t looking.
Thankfully, Lucinda and Pepina didn’t put Steve in tails (he never really liked them anyway). It was a simple black tux with a black bowtie. And where it was pinned actually fit unlike when he went shopping on a regular day. He turned around in the full length mirror and admired his reflection, and Lucinda looked approvingly.
“It’s okay, we just finished eating anyway.” Steve said as they walked in. “At least you guys are meeting without me sick in bed this time.”
Tony held out his right hand. “Hey, you must be Steve. Actually-” He dropped his hand and opened his arms. “Do you hug? I’m kind of a hugger. Except when I’m not. For you, I’m thinking definitely a hugger.”
Tony nodded. “Just a sec,” and got down on his knees to mouth Steve’s fly. He loved the feel of the soft molded anatomy under his boyfriend’s khakis.
Bucky flicked his scowl up from the floor, but checked himself before saying anything too reflexively protective. “Does that seem… smart?”
Tony got up off the desk and sat down heavily in a chair. “If I say I’m starting to think he’s too good for this evil evil world will you laugh?”
“I just know my limits. Sometimes I get cocky about what I can do, but most of the time, I’ll admit that I can’t do it once I fail. But even that’s hard to do.”
Bucky leaned on the counter and tried to come up with some advice that didn’t involve hitting things, as that had already been shouted down twice by his stupid, stubborn friends.
Tony shrugged. “I think he did it to annoy Bucky more than you. I won’t be surprised if I get a picture of a big blue handprint tomorrow morning. That guy’s a smart-ass masochist if ever there was one.”
Steve almost didn’t want to let go, but he knew if he didn’t he’d be getting weird looks. So reluctantly, he unwrapped his arms from Tony and asked, “Do you want to sit down? I haven’t ordered yet.”
“So I know you’re gonna worry anyway, because you’re an idiot and it’s basically your hobby, but my advice is don’t worry about it. Just like the guy. Let him like you. Even if the sex isn’t awesome at first, it’ll get there. And there’ll be no comparing you to anyone he’s been with before.”
“Okay, first, let’s not call me Mr. Rogers. It sounds too much like that kid’s show guy. You can call me Steve.”
Steve frowned a bit. There were two times he came out: to Bucky and Natasha, and to his mom when she was sick. He tried not to think about the second one so much, but Tony did ask. He took a deep breath.
“Hey man, you got a delivery. I told them to put it upstairs. They wouldn’t leave it in the garage.” He frowned and glanced around. “There were three guys. In suits. I’m really not sure why. It didn’t seem that heavy.”
“Nah, you get nervous when your contacts get dry.” Bucky opined. “Sketchbook might look too much like business at this point.”
“Nothing, I just really like looking at you. You’ve got a little smudge of charcoal at your hairline and it’s the cutest thing.”
“And the bravery reveals itself yet again.” Natasha said with a smirk. “And remember, I’ll also be at the gala, so you can search me out if you need to.”
Tony nodded, concerned but not worried. They did usually have a little bit of a conversation after trying anything a little bit new, just to clear the air and give each other notes in an open way. He settled himself on the bed and took a deep breath to open his ears and put down his defensive impulses. Maybe Steve had meant something else when he’d asked Tony to talk him over the edge. It had just slipped out, but he figured if that’s what it was he could try to stay more porn and less valentine in the future. Anything for Steve.
Steve laughed. “People who know Natasha know better than to cross her. It’s in the ‘How to Be Friends with Natasha Barnes’ handbook.”
“So’s everything.” Tony grinned impishly. He turned to Steve and leaned in a little, either to offer him a kiss or let himself be pushed away.
“He chose to stay with you even after the media released the audio. He’s stayed at that location because he knows you’ll handle it, that you both can handle it. He’s capable of saying no to the Gala, but he’ll feel like he’s being forced if you don’t ask at all. Communicating these fears to him would be the best thing to do so that you can avoid them.”
Steve had managed to wash the packer and put away the harness before Tony showed up. He also got the little velvet box he hid out of a secret spot in Tony’s room. Jarvis promised not to say anything, so Tony had no idea what was in it. As soon as Tony handed him the boxers and he was dressed, he asked,
Bucky gaped at the painting resting on the floor against his breakfast island/home office. He wasn’t as big into art as Steve was, but like any Brooklyn public school kid, he’d gone on his fair share of field trips to all the conveniently local art galleries. He knew that an original by any artist with a name he recognized was probably worth more than the entire block. He shook his head, numb with shock.
Clint gave a smile that was partly a wince. “Yeah. That reminds me I need to call her and let her know the secret’s out. The last couple weeks we’ve been less ‘dating’ and more ‘I go over to her place for pity over having realized my Soulmate doesn’t see me that way’.”
“I should probably remember to bring dessert tomorrow.” He cleared his throat. “I should probably be getting back soon. They watch my building, and if I’m out too late they’ll get more aggressive about following me.”
“Wow. I love your attention to detail. You must be used to working with your hands,” she purred down to Cap, who averted his eyes from her legs up to her face.
The captain was more than happy to get away from the bonfire for a moment. Watching Tony smirking and chatting across the way was really starting to bother him.
"Well. I'm here," Loki offered, keeping his hand on Thor's. "I know you just think of me as your pal, but you know..." He shrugged a shoulder, trying to imitate Hawkeye’s casual air. "Or I could just get you her cell phone number," he added dejectedly. "If you really like her."
Peter gave them both a cheery little wave and went straight to the bag of marshmallows, starting to set up another s'more.
Anyway, Cap is trying to be tactful here and not use much more derogatory terms in a 1940s sense, such as "homosexual". Just know that we took that word usage into consideration while writing, and decided this would be in-character for him. It's Cap, he's not calling anybody a slur on purpose--I think that's about the least Captain America thing he could do.
Except Peter kept his identity secret for this exact reason--so no weirdos knew who he really was. Clearly this guy knew, whoever he was.
Would it be strange for Cap to remind Peter that the Avengers are like a family? They cared about him, especially Steve and Tony. It hadn’t been too much of a stretch when he told Wade that they were Peter’s parents. It really felt like that sometimes. Like when he and Tony were arguing over the way the media talked about Spider-Man, or Tony setting aside a college fund for him.
Seeing Loki struggling, Thor blinked and slipped an arm around his shoulders, helping him sit up carefully.
"He said his name is Wade, by the way. And he also knows Peter's age and called him 'super hot', so in case he tries to say they're 'just bros', I don't think so."
It made perfect sense--he'd been talking to Cap about having a boyfriend last night, and boom, a dude showed up today who was all excited to see Peter. Wade wasn't actually his boyfriend--something that would potentially change in the future, depending on whether he lived through crashing the Avengers' vacation--but since Peter had slipped up and said he had a boyfriend, at least he could see how Cap and Tony might react to actually being introduced to one someday.
Thankfully, it turned out that they weren’t electrified or anything. Doom really was old-fashioned in his dungeon design.
“Stop calling him yours! He’s a kid!” Clint gestured to Peter, completely ignoring his comment. “He’s practically Cap and Stark’s kid! You really wanna piss them off?”
"Trying to help you," Bruce corrected, now disinfecting the same needle he'd used before. "The pain pill I gave you before doesn't seem to be doing anything. I might be able to inject something, but it will have to be right by the wound."
The scientist glanced off to one side, his heart racing. When he looked back at Clint, though, he knew his eyes were very, very green.
What did it matter? For once, Loki wanted to look like himself while he tricked one of them. It didn’t matter if they were married or involved.
"Blue. Blue." He unscrewed the blue wires even faster than the green but still managed not to rip any out. Twisting the last one free, he looked up to Tony's face to make sure he was all right. "D-did it work?"
Bruce blinked and ducked his head down so that Clint didn't have to hold his arms so high to support the vest. This put their faces only a few inches apart, but at the moment not having rain running down his nose was worth the lack of personal space.
“What? No way! I wouldn’t bring a weapon to a romantic camping getaway! No way!” He kept laughing as he used his foot to push a large black duffel bag behind the edge of their tent.
He turned to Spider-Man and sighed in good-natured resignation. "Look, kid, as long as your aunt won't freak out if you're gone for a week, you're free to stick around with the Avengers here. You have to lose the suit, though, we're all going low-tech and normal for this."
"I am certain your intentions were noble," he said, and looked down at the armored Avenger worriedly.
“Let me get that,” Cap said, kneeling and beginning to start a fire. “I know bears wouldn’t bother the Hulk, but I still don’t want Bruce to have to go through getting bitten or clawed.”
"He stabbed me!" Clint growled, pointing accusingly at his double, who was dressed in his Hawkeye outfit.
“What in the world is going on out here?” Carol shouted above them. She hovered down through the shield, looking around at the sight below her.
That left Thor, who wouldn’t look behind the couch without a good reason—just like he wouldn’t TAKE the box without a good reason. He hadn’t heard about the box being here and therefore, he had no motivation to move it.
"Oh, yes. Cap's a little under the weather, though," Pepper warned, looking around the room. She stepped over and looked at the couch worriedly. "Is that blood?"
Shoving the various items back into the first aid kit without really looking at them, Bruce nodded quickly.
Clint got up and paced the room, looking over the new cell with mild interest. Escaping didn’t seem like an option after he’d gone over the cell inch by inch. There weren’t any cracks, gaps or openings. Doom was a pretty smart guy.
Cap eyed the beakers as the villain worked. If Doctor Doom wanted Thor for some ominous purpose, why didn't he just ask for him? He really wanted to ask, though he figured Doom wouldn't give him a straight answer anyway—so he gave the green cloaked man a quirked eyebrow instead.
Loki sighed, poking through the remains of the Chinese food on the coffee table. It had been surprisingly good. He had never spent much time eating takeout, as the mortals called it, but on his next visit he'd decided he’d have to stop and try a few more kinds.
“Yeah… Sorry I said that,” Clint mumbled, cringing at the sting from the alcohol. “Honestly, I don’t even know you. I’d like to.”
Speeding through the water, Clint peeked back over his shoulder, hand forward to stop himself on the first rock.
Tony would have liked nothing better than to swim up closer to Steve, but with Bruce out there in the woods somewhere unknown, he couldn’t take the chance. Siiigh. Coffee did sound pretty nice, too. He had more pressing matters to attend to, though.
“I have the feeling my hunch earlier was right. Peter’s got himself mixed up in a love triangle.” Cap rubbed his forehead, exasperated.
"The mansion?" The archer grumbled, glancing around. Hearing Cap cough again, he raised an eyebrow at him. "You okay, there?
Why did Cap have to get up so obnoxiously early and do his morning workout, anyway? Today felt like a great day to laze in the tent in their sleeping bags and cuddle. Oof, he really WAS getting married, wasn’t he? That sounded so sentimental.
"Then c'mon already, I'm hungry," Spidey added, sounding determined. He'd see this outing through, Wade would go to Detroit and things would be much quieter after that. He hoped.
"You know, I hate to complain,” he began in his very best Clint Barton impression, “but can someone pull this arrow out of my side?" He gritted his teeth and pointed to it. "Seriously—OW."
The door out to the hallway was standing open. Dr. Banner poked his head outside and blinked, his eyes a bit greenish.
“Oh yeah—totally!” Wade grinned, jerking the arrow out of his chest. Blood gushed out for only a moment before the wound healed shut.
"Bruce's analyzing it right now," Tony assured him. Glancing after Pepper as she closed the door, he placed a hand on Steve's shoulder and patted it lightly. "Have a seat, you look exhausted. I could get you some actual water, even, if that'll help."
Digging out a sweatshirt for Tony, Cap dropped it into his fiance’s lap before sitting on his own sleeping bag. Pulling on a sweatshirt of his own, he didn’t bother drying his hair. The water didn’t bother him, anyway.
"Uh, not sure." Hawkeye placed the bent needle on Bruce's palm. "I stole it out of Tony's lab. The monitor thing said something about magic." The man shrugged his shoulders.
"Wow, as an Avenger you'd better hope nobody learns your secret weakness--tiny fish hooks," he joked. "In all seriousness, maybe I'd better take a look. That's bleeding a lot." Without waiting for Clint to comment, he gripped the blond's wrist and pulled his finger out of his mouth, maneuvering the hand over to examine Clint's finger. It had promptly started bleeding again. Bruce frowned and gripped his finger, squeezing it to add pressure.
"You're only human, okay?" Bruce told Loki quietly. "I-I'm not sure what Doom did to your skin, but one of the other Hawkeyes knows which arrows can still hurt you. Please don't be reckless. Let me take the hit, if somebody has to get hit. Arrows and bullets don’t permanently hurt me."
"I was about to say the same thing," Bruce admitted. "But you're still bleeding. Let me dress that wound first."
The stairwell was plunged into darkness save for a few shards of blue light that escaped between Steve's fingers. Tony leaned heavily on his shoulder.
"Sure," the shirtless archer said dubiously. "And a shirt. My size." He pointed to himself as if to clarify. "In black. No sleeves." He made small motions in the air as he spoke. The other watched, eyebrow raised.
“Bugssssss,” Wade whined, climbing to his feet and holding up the frisbee sadly. It was cracked all the way through.
Wait...the Hulk actually respected that arrangement even a little bit? Usually he seemed content to show up and smash things to bits until people blasted him into unconsciousness again...
Tony was on the floor in the far corner, wearing only his black undersuit with the blue glowy lines all over it. Pieces of his Iron Man armor were all over the floor. Pepper sat beside him, holding one of the gauntlet-like hands of the armor and looking at it unhappily. Her hair and clothes were damp.
The ginger guy settled in beside him, seeming strangely at home in his borrowed clothes even though they were oversized on him. Apparently Cap had loaned him some blue pajamas.
"Jarvis, tell Thor to keep an eye on Clint and send Bruce in here to help me," Tony told the computer, not looking up from his typing. "You seriously should sit down, Cap."
“I figured you’d have a problem with it.” Matt gave a small shrug. “I knew sooner or later, if we kept dating, I’d have to meet the two of you. I didn’t plan on it being this weekend, though.”
The sky flared and thunder made his ears ring. The next thing he saw was a brilliant red cape flowing in the air in front of him as the demi god descended to land in front of him.
Releasing the breath he had been holding, Cap gave Tony a quick hug. It was a Thor moment. It would probably be too much for some of the team members if Thor AND Steve started hugging everyone, but the thought of losing Tony hurt too badly not to this time.
“He IS a lawyer,” Tony said dubiously. “Seemed pretty straight with me, though. Besides, you saw how he and Peter greeted each other. Like one of those cliche romance movies where they run in slo-mo and call each other’s names and hold hands. I know you saw him kiss Peter, too.” He shook his head, sighing. “I don’t want to believe it, but I do. We should still have a chat with Peter, though. Matt could get seriously hurt being anywhere near the superhero side of things.”
The captain turned back and started to unload the cooler into the fridge, adding to Bruce, “Can you tell Clint to bring his cooler back?”
Clint couldn’t stop himself from sputtering as they stopped by the shoreline. Water bubbled over his toes as he tried to come up with a nice way to explain things and NOT out himself.
Thor's smile was a very knowing one, and Tony instantly got the impression frisbee wasn't all they were playing at, here. The demigod stood up from the couch and came over to sit his drink on the counter.
"So even you aren't too dumb to understand that much," Doom said drolly, giving him a sort of shove at the table. "Sit."
"They saw me and Cap get into a taxi—then they went missing." Clint got up too, straightening out his pajamas. The blond stared at Bruce for a minute, looking more and more uncomfortable. "Hey. I'm sorry for..." He trailed off and stared down at his feet. "You know. The whole..." Mumbling and shivering, he started picking up the wad of blankets off of the floor.
Steve had half a mind to march back across the lake and confront Loki about it. Bruce could handle himself, and Peter was strong, too, but versus Loki? A man with all the possibilities of magic at his fingertips?
Steve’s attention was focused on the frisbee game again for a moment as Wade caught Peter around the stomach and lifted him up to spin him in victory.
"You know, it's weird—but I sort of like that first guy." Loki pondered, thinking over his interactions with Hawkeye. The man had an air of mischief about him. "And I think he likes me." He shrugged a shoulder. "I sort of wish neither of us was a fake—I'm cooler than I thought I was."
“We didn’t know Loki was here when we went hiking,” Peter pointed out to Tony. He paused, then gestured to Clint almost sternly. “And why didn’t somebody tell me Hawkeye has broken ribs? If I’d known I was responsible for dragging an injured guy around all day I never would’ve taken him on a miles-long hike!”
“I like people who are smarter than me,” Clint added, dropping the sunscreen at the bottom of the stairs to the cabins. No one else was staying up there, so nobody better steal it. Wiping his hands on his trunks, he shrugged. “So you think Tony’s straight. I dunno, I’ve seen the way he looks at Cap in the morning. Doin’ his push ups.” Clint winked at Bruce. “I don’t think he’s as straight as you think.”
With a nervous smile at Cap and Tony, he told Matt apologetically, “I might have to find you a walking stick ‘til we find it.”
"Thanks for putting in a good word for Wade," he told Cap. "Matt wasn't even planning to let him stay for breakfast."
Clint thought to himself over and over, making his way down to the beach. Cap was right about the sunscreen, but Hawkeye had a more important task on his mind; hiding that damned tackle box.
He’d found Peter where he had put the dozing teenager the night before, which was in Cap’s hammock. Since Tony was going to be hung over, Steve had made a nice pot of coffee for him. It probably wasn’t as good as Quaff-Aid, but nobody made that anymore.
"I'm not scared of you," he explained, a tiny bit ashamed of himself for making Clint look so uncomfortable. "I mean, ah...it's not that I don't want you around," he continued, now feeling uncomfortable, himself. "...Let's just go." He turned and walked quickly to the living room. They had to get a pizza, right?
"You mean they don't bother you and Hulk so much," Bruce corrected. "I see Captain America all the time while I'm in Hulk's head, but he doesn't actually know ME all that well, does he?" He glanced at the door unhappily. "After talking to him on the beach the other night, I know he doesn't have anything against you..." He looked at Clint and sighed a little. "...Doing what he thought we were doing. So it must be just about me. I'm a safety risk, as usual."
“We’re so dead!” Clint hissed, paddling along past. “If Loki doesn’t shoot us in the back, the lake monster’s gonna eat us!”
"Why didn't you w-wear better clothes for this? Y-you're wearing the same thing as last time I saw you..."
Wandering around the beach with Bruce felt surreal, and if Clint thought about it for too long, he could easily convince himself that it was all some strange dream he’d cooked up while laying around in the medical ward in a coma or something. One of THOSE stories.
"Maybe..." He began, and then trailed off, shaking his head. No, bad idea. Thinking tomorrow was best.
“That’s when you’re on the clock, I’m talking about down time. As leader of the Avengers, I’m instating a anti-fraternization rule.” Tony nodded and then added, “Except for Pym and Wasp. They’re already together.”
Hawkeye looked frantically through his arrowheads. How was it that Amora had the emergency Hulk stuff? He was pretty sure that it was uniquely his—but who knew. The other two had stolen everything else about him, why not his arrows?
Bruce blinked and—did his cheeks flush a little? Loki might be imagining things. It was an interesting development if it was true.
"I'm looking for things nobody but Iron Man can see," Tony replied brightly. "Scanning for forensic evidence, you know, the technical brainy stuff you don't usually do. I've found out a LOT so far, actually. Thor said he thought the Hulk hurt one of you two, though. C'mon, don't leave me in the dark, here."
"I guess I like 'em nerdy," Loki quipped, smoothing out a wrinkle in Bruce's collar with his thumb. "And those eyes." Leaning in close, he pressed a kiss onto the scientist's cheek. "But I don't know about the beard."
"Do your worst, tin face." Loki twisted to look up at Hawkeye. "I knew you were the fake! You've been working with Doom the whole time!"
"...Yes, Tony's still in the basement," Bruce answered Cap's question finally, turning to face him. It was better not to think about the Clint situation at the moment.
Bruce nodded and stepped over to pick it up. Inwardly he was thinking how he'd come within inches of stepping right on it.
Realizing he'd just been standing there frowning unhappily for a moment, he ran a hand through his hair and nodded at the door.
Maybe that’s what he was trying for, here. Not success, but resignation, if success wasn’t an option. It all depended on Steve.
"Wha...what did I do?" Clint asked, surprised. "I didn't do anything to him!" He hopped out of the chair, making a beeline for the door. "How about a nice roast turkey?"
"Do not underestimate Doom," the masked man said darkly. "However, we will not fight today, Asgardian. Instead I offer to trust in you as you have in me by revealing yourself."
"I wonder about Tony sometimes too. But I think he's just...him." He pulled out a pair of black slacks and offered them to Bruce.
"What, he just GAVE it to you?" Tony wrinkled his nose and looked at the blue-green stain on the handkerchief. "That's kind of weird."
Tony pulled Steve in for a stiff business-bro hug that quickly melted into something altogether different. Instead of popping Steve on the shoulder blades with a firm no-homo pat, he found himself just holding him, like a friend just home from war. And oh god, how could anyone real smell like that?
Tony nodded. “There should be plenty of clean towels. I can get the dishes done while you do that, if you don’t mind me staying.”
Natasha nodded in approval. “There isn’t anything shield-related at the Gala, so that works. Just make sure to tell Tony before the Gala so you have that system in place.”
“Outstanding.” Tony laid a colorful and fragrant plate in front of Steve with a flourish. “Things have been going ok with running the media gauntlet. After the tabloids have had their fun this weekend and made everything seem implausible, I’ve got a quick sit-down with an entertainment reporter. Just a quick ‘yes I’m in love, yes it’s serious, no we’re not ready to face the crowds, love to all my fans, you’ll be the first to know’ kind of thing.”
Steve had to repress a full body shudder at that voice, and tugged at Tony’s hair. “And what will you do to yourself while you suck my cock?”
Tony was getting used to Steve’s financial anxiety and gave him a wink as Lucinda took his card. “We’re supporting small businesses. These ladies gotta eat.”
“That has to be a reproduction or something. That - this can’t be what it looks like. That would be insane. Tony Stark is known to have a sense of humor, right?”
Two days had gone by since the phone call, and Steve hadn’t heard a word from Tony. True, it felt like Tony was nervous when they talked, but Steve didn’t think he came off as anything other than nice. Sure, he didn’t exactly like everything he said, except he was nervous! He walked behind the garage as usual and saw Clint on the phone, probably talking to Natasha. But before Steve could go up the stairs, Clint stopped him.
The conversation flowed easily after that. It turned out Tony and Steve liked the same baseball team, Tony pranked his friend Rhodey at MIT, and Steve confessed that he’d never been out of New York City apart from field trips. The baked goods were amazing as well, and all in all, it was a great first date. About two hours later, the two of them wormed through the crowd and onto an empty part of the sidewalk.
The front bell and a friendly call indicated that Tony had returned. Lucinda left for a moment, and returned with Tony in tow. He had a shopping bag, but Steve decided not to ask.
Steve nodded, and looked at the enormous crowd. “I usually don’t go to places like this. Way out of my price range.” And he realized his second statement. “Not that there’s anything wrong with that. And I’m not expecting you to just pay for everything, I’ll pay for what I can.”
Tony hugged him back, sighing audibly. “I don’t wanna let go. But I’m gonna.” He demonstrated, taking a couple meandering steps backwards. “See this is me. Respectful. And I’m gonna call you tomorrow. Because that’s the kind of guy I am. Now. Apparently.”
“I’ve only dated three guys. One kept me as a dirty secret, the other slept with me once then left. Then I wanted to actually wait with the third guy, and he got tired of waiting so he slept with a woman. It’s stupid, but I think there’s this deep-seated fear that it’ll happen every time I find someone even remotely attractive. And in between those exes I’ve only been on first dates, rarely ever make it to the second date, so…”
Steve smiled at the praise. “Thanks. I was thinking of the final sketch being on a graphite wash so the light and shadows are more apparent.”
Tony nodded, his face serious. “I know. I know you’re tough. But I promise you, you haven’t been called everything you might be called. And you haven’t been used as a metaphor for gross sex acts by Jay Leno five nights a week for a month. I know we’ll survive it, because we can survive anything, I do believe that, I’m just saying, I can’t drag you through this if your eyes aren’t open.
There was a loud crow of laughter from across the room from Tony, who began patting Bucky on the shoulder. Bucky turned around and gave Clint a look.
me. I know we put feedback sensors on the inside of your junk, but I don’t think that’s supposed to make me feel like you’re filling me with hot come. And yet. I wonder if that’s a Soulmate thing.” He sighed and shifted as they both relaxed. “I think we might need to do some science at some point.”
“Ok, I ask because, well, I wanted to know how many partners Tony’s had, and apparently it’s way too many. And, I don’t know, it makes me feel… intimidated? And we both know sex is usually how my exes decided to end it.”
“Oh fuck, you feel so good. If I beg will you let me suck you?” Tony gave his best coquettish bossy-sub smile.
“Because, as you’ve kept saying, Bucky doesn’t hold back in bed. And that arm can lift 800 pounds easily.”
Bucky shot Clint a look. “So you’re just in a permanent mood now? This is just the helpfulness setting you’re stuck on?”
“So, sex that’s for fun, it’s fun. It’s a lot of fun. But it’s just… it’s not even the same thing as having sex with someone that you… when you mean a lot to each other. I mean, that can be fun, too. A lot of fun. It can be as hot and crazy as you care to go but it’s also… there’s no comparison. There’s more problems, but there’s also time to work through them. And, trust me, when you’re with someone the second time, or the tenth, or the hundredth, you know stuff about them, just them, that the most fluent sexpert in the world doesn’t know and can’t give them.
“Ok.” Steve tried to phrase this carefully. “I know you sometimes have casual sex, so how do you usually react when someone says they have lots of previous partners?”
Steve shuddered a bit, as usual mind-blown by how realistic it felt. “He’d just applaud us because he’s an asshole.” He lead Tony’s hand onto Steve’s prosthetic cock and started thrusting into it.
“How is it I own nothing that works for this!?” Steve said as he rummaged through his pile of clothing he’d dumped on the floor.
Tony gave a look of sympathy and concern, and turned away to pack things up. They left the store, and decided to grab a bite to eat before Steve’s first dance lesson. Again, Steve had to keep himself from having a heart attack over the prices of this Manhattan cafe. He sat awkwardly in his seat across from Tony, and warily looked around.
“The first guy I dated was named Doug. I thought he’d be okay because he had trans family members, but he couldn’t get past the fact that I still had…” He simply gestured to his chest. “He wanted me to wear a binder all the time when we were together, and if we did anything sexual, it’d always be me doing things for him, he never reciprocated. I was still new to dating so I didn’t know any better, and then we actually got far enough to actually have sex… but he absolutely refused to do anything other than…” Steve blushed. “Anal. I couldn’t wear my binder during it because it would set my asthma off, and he left me a week later.”
Tony laughed. “Well, ok, I guess we can do it like that, then. Yeah, yeah absolutely I’m going to marry the shit out of you. But one condition.”
“Give me… a minute.” Steve slid his hand down Tony’s front and lightly gripped his hard cock. “Not done yet.”
Tony bit his lip and grinned. He loved to feel Steve looking at him. He balanced up on his knees and stretched, then settled down slow with a shift in his hips until Steve was fully sheathed in him again.
Steve did not want his ass to be the main focus of this fitting, as it was awkward already being talked about by Tony. He looked to Tony with a pleading expression before being escorted to the back.
Steve sat down his menu and really thought for a moment. He wasn’t exactly an expert, but he at least knew what people typically wanted out of a relationship. Or what he did at least.
“Not plotting,” Tony grinned. “Just needed a voice of reason. I have this tendency to go overboard.”
Tony feigned shock. “They sell it in stores?!” He grinned at his own joke and edged a little closer to Steve. “So can I walk you to your subway tunnel or…?”
Steve couldn’t stop smiling on the whole train ride back to Brooklyn. He knew he was getting a few weird stares, but he couldn’t help it. Maybe he’d actually have a shot at this.
Tony gave a short, nervous laugh. “Something like that. Ok.” He lifted both hands loosely in what Steve had come to recognize as his ‘sales-pitch gesture’. “So, I didn’t want to be presumptuous and try to pick for you, but I also didn’t want you staring at price tags and arguing with me about what you’re worth in public, so I got a selection, and you can choose.”
“I am taking it seriously, that’s why I’m asking these questions. So again: what do your fears in regard to Steve being disproved tell you?”
Steve walked as casually as he could as they made their way to Tony’s room. Somehow, he got the feeling that Natasha knew, but he didn’t care to analyze that. As soon as the door was closed Tony pressed Steve back against it. He kissed his neck and worked his way down his throat and chest, pinching buttons apart one-handed ahead of himself.
He knew he was being too flip, but he’d spent his whole post-pubescent life being analized in the press for his life choices, and he was well-beyond over it. Or at least he had been. The fact that Steve’s question made him want to take a serious accounting of his intentions was upsetting, but also kind of refreshing. Like an intriguing new problem or… something way more serious than that, even. It felt like giving a shit. And he didn’t hate it.
Bucky had been standing frozen, mouth open, hand held out to the side and open, ready to voice an intelligible thought the moment one occurred to him. But all higher brain functions seemed to have gotten stuck like a lingering sneeze. He dropped his hand helplessly.
, because you referred to yourself as that a few times when you were drunk. It was a bit too perfect to pass up.”
“They’re going to find out. Casual homophobia, transphobia, any of it, even from every side is not the same thing as getting hit with it by the pros. By writers rooms full of people that see you as a punch line and a paycheck. To be the thing that brings millions of people happiness seeing your name dragged every day. That’s what I’m saying. I do have some idea how bad it is for you, and I’m telling you, what you’re in for with me is worse than you know.”
The NYC Stark Industries building had a private executive garage under the building, with an entrance that came out half a block away. But for first-round media blitz, Tony figured it was important to give them something, and Natasha agreed. Especially with Bruce’s voice and personal information attached to the story. It seemed smart to try to shift the focus to some other incident.
“He’d do better letting them sit through his lectures. They bore easier than they scare.” Tony sighed. “I hope Steve’s doing ok. I know I shouldn’t call during the day but honestly, I feel like I’m going through withdrawal, you know?”
“It’ll be our way of coming out officially. We already had a long talk about dealing with the media and I told him I can handle it, which I can. He wants to buy me a tux and give me dancing lessons, and it honestly feels… kinda nice.”
He poked a song with his thumb, and something waltzy with brass underneath it started playing, like those old songs from the forties. He hopped up and offered Steve a hand.
Tony nodded and carefully gripped his tongue between his teeth. He had an awful habit of immediately trying to make suggestions and offer solutions where he had no business being. Instead he let what Steve was saying sink in. Illness in general didn’t bother him too much, and he had to acknowledge that he found Steve’s litany of ailments intimidating not because of any barrier it might present, but because it made him think that Steve was clearly kind of a low-key badass for getting as far as he had in life.
Steve didn’t exactly know what to say… so he just nodded his thanks and went upstairs to the apartment. He went inside and sure enough, there was a thin wooden crate leaning against the breakfast bar, and Bucky was on the couch eating a sandwich.
“You didn’t do anything wrong. All you did was… start a different direction than what that guy liked. People need some of the inventions you’ve come up with. I’m pretty sure Bucky is even thinking about taking you up on your offer for an arm.”
“I guess we should talk about why things didn’t work out before if we want this to last.” Steve took a deep breath. “I didn’t start dating until I was 24, and by that time I passed well enough to be comfortable dating anyone. I had heard about cis gay guys still dating trans men, so I decided to try that.
“Yeah, well, so should you. So I guess he has a point there.” He sat back down on the sofa and shook his head. “Interesting times, man.”
Steve shrugged. “I don’t hate who I was before. I was always me, but different expectations were put on me. I still like the things I did before I transitioned, so it doesn’t really matter.”
With Bruce off the table, at least in the mainstream, Tony went ahead and braved the front door gauntlet. Let the tabloids take their bite.
Tony rolled his eyes. “Yeah that’s a little obnoxious, but come on. I’ll bet you like to have updates. You wanna know that your friend is ok.”
Sam stretched. “Only three more days before you can go back to being a shut-in at Bucky’s place instead of here.”
Steve moved over to his drafting desk and sat down. He had no clue if he could even respond after this. What exactly could he do as a thank you? Or what did people normally do when big billionaires bought them famous paintings? He was just a guy from Brooklyn, he barely had money to his name apart from student loans, and he was sick too often. Romantic Soulmate aside, this was too much too soon. He couldn’t exactly keep the painting, but he also didn’t know what to do with it either.
“I get it. I do. Honestly, though, this is how all the talent at my company gets treated. Strictly for convenience. I know artists have trouble with schedules sometimes, it’s just easier for everyone if you can blame the car. But I get it. However you wanna go. Meet me at Ferrera’s on Grand Street tomorrow. Name a time.”
Tony was practically vibrating with excitement. He loved a guy in formal wear, and Steve’s long silhouette seemed to have been made by the god of couture for a black tux.
Steve took out the bottle and put it on the bedside table. “I like the idea of us going at it for hours.” Steve gently ran a finger over the bit of lube dripping out of Tony. “That I came in you so much you were dripping.”
“Are you kidding? She figured it out before I did. We’re friends, Steve. Fuck buddies. I know you don’t ‘get’ that stuff but not everyone in the world gets angry and jealous when someone they care about is happy.”
Steve breathily chuckled, then shifted them so that Tony was sitting on him with his back to Steve. “Then give me a show.”
“I remember when I came out. Well, the second time. The first time, I came out to my dad, figured I’d get the worst over with first. He said it would be better for everyone if I went back in. So I did. I’m not real proud of that, but I look at kids who are the age I was then, and I blame myself less.”
Clint shook his head, feigning victimization. “I can’t believe the man I love more than life itself lives with such a homophobe.”
They hung up, and Steve actually felt a bit better about himself, and the situation. He was seriously thankful that no photographers had shown up to the garage. Bucky hadn’t had an episode in almost two years, and he didn’t need that streak broken by some asshole with a camera.
Tony already had his pants off and his shirt open and sat on the bed. He gave a soft appreciative moan at the sight of Steve, shoulders back and head high, as he came out of the bathroom. Tony beckoned him over,
Tony nodded, “Yeah. Except yours was so good I feel like I should have gone bigger. It’s Barnes’ fault, really.”
“Yeah, but I don’t like rhetorical questions. I don’t get to hear myself talk.” He put his arm around Steve and kissed the part in his hair. “Anyway, we should probably stop. You’re about to out-schmaltz the claymation reindeer.”
Steve’s jaw dropped. Bucky was Clint’s Soulmate? And Bucky hadn’t noticed? That was… he didn’t know what to think. Bucky smiled sadly and nodded.
Eventually, Steve got out of the shower and put on some clean pajamas, or rather he had cleaned some clothes earlier that day. Jarvis had to help him figure out the touchscreen washer and dryer set. He went back downstairs and saw Tony sitting on the couch on his phone. Steve would have expected him to be frowning if he was on social media, but he was smiling dreamily. It was almost adorable. So Steve went over to the couch and sat next to him.
Steve held onto Tony’s hand, and with his other, lined himself up with Tony’s hole. “You tell me if I go too roughly.”
He got up and straightened his coat, put on his sunglasses, and squared his shoulders to swagger across the campus like he wasn’t terrified half to death.
“Still, thanks for being so great. I know it’s not easy on you. I’m trying to get it sorted out as fast as I can.” He gazed at Steve’s sweet clear face, and didn’t especially care that he was probably looking sappy.
He nodded. “Yeah sure. No problem.” He took a bite of his gelato and moaned loudly. “Holy shit, I’ve never tried the gelato here. I owe you dinner just for getting me to try this.”
They walked a few blocks to the subway station and down the stairs to the tunnel. They kept up an easy conversation until they reached the ticket section.
“So after this, then what? I mean, is this a new normal you’re prepared to shoulder? Because I don’t think your boy’s getting unfamous any time soon.”
“Tony, stop.” Steve scooted closer and took Tony’s hands in his. “I don’t care about what they write about me. Or what they think of you for dating me. They’re just trying to make a quick buck. You’re more important than any of that to me, so… just teach me how to deal with them, and I’m sure I’ll catch on quickly.”
“Well next time you tell him if any weirdo is gonna over-do a romantic overture at you in public it’s gonna be me. Unless he’s clearly helping you out of a bad situation in which case I guess I’d be a massive schmuck for begrudging him that. Little hero moment.”
Tony pulled back with a sigh. “So, brass tacks, there’s a benefit coming up. It’s an annual memorial charity ball in my mom’s name. Pepper thinks it’ll be the best time to make our big splash, and I think she’s right. Would you be my date?”
“I’m not a shut-in.” Steve complained as he sat down at the table again. “I have friends I hang out with. You’re sitting here, aren’t you?”
Steve cleared up plates as Sam wiped his mouth and sat back in his chair. “I’ll admit, between the sit-down lunch and how much your cooking seems to improve when you’re bored, I’m pretty on-board for this house-arrest thing.”
Steve pounded back in, and Tony’s skin made an audible slap at the movement. He didn’t waste anymore time, he started a hard and fast rhythm and had to hold onto Tony’s shoulder so he wouldn’t fall. It was still embarrassing how easily this could get him off, but even with the strap on, he could come multiple times. And the sounds Tony was making were fucking incredible.
“Yeah, it’s a great house. Was in kinda bad shape when I picked it up, but the location.” He stopped, not wanting to get bogged down in small talk.
Clint hopped off the dresser. “That’s kinda how these things go. Confused, to excited, to desperate, and then pretty much right back to confused. I don’t know why anyone puts up with it.” He seemed a little too serious for his smile.
Steve took a bite of his gelato, and had to stop himself from moaning at the absolutely amazing texture and taste in his mouth. “I’m waiting for if we do another date, and another date after that.”
Steve had read every book he’d brought, watched the small amount of DVDs Tony had in the house, and sketched to his heart’s content. Thor said he’d go to his instructors to get his notes and assignments for the next week, which left him in the house alone. Well, maybe not entirely alone. And he still couldn’t stop wondering who this Stane guy was and why he was blocked access from Jarvis. Tony didn’t seem to like him either if that morning was anything to go by.
“So…” Tony rolled his eyes towards the ceiling. “Tell me about why you’re still so worried.” He added a Barbara Walters lilt to the last word for funsies.
Tony slid his hand down Steve’s back to rest suggestively low. “So what’s your friend bond telling you right now? Is Barnes doing ok? Enjoying his gig? Wouldn’t notice if maybe we wander down the hall for a few minutes?”
“But you’re assuming the worst. You won’t know what he’ll think about this until you ask and he probably has some idea considering where he is right now.”
to say anything to their Soulmate. All the stories you hear, it’s like everyone figures it out at the same time and it’s like getting hit by a truck. Bucky didn’t even flinch or seem like he noticed anything. So, yeah, I’ve been feeling a little stressed out and bitter about the whole concept. And then you get this absolute Prince Snarking out of nowhere, falling all over himself to woo you and I guess I felt like… well ok, like a jealous jagoff. But you get it, right?”
“Here,” Bucky put his sandwich down and wiped his hand on his jeans. “I feel like I should do the honors. I’ve been here guarding it for two hours.”
Tony was already sliding himself down off the edge of the bed. “I just like begging I guess,” he whispered, and started babbling unprompted as he knelt at Steve’s feet. “Please baby, please let me suck your hot cock.”
“That’s good to hear. I’ve dated a lot of guys where… well not really a lot, I guess… and not exactly dated.” He shook his head in acute self satire and held Steve’s waist, moving him around. “Just you know… guys that get called names a lot who can’t then let themselves relax a little unless it’s total camp. And I get it, it just doesn’t seem like any way to live.”
Tony smiled and gave her a hug, and received a graceful air-kiss to each cheek. “Lucinda, my lovely, I have a real treat for you.”
Steve reached across the table and held Tony’s hand. “The only reason it bothers me is because I’m sad that you never found someone you thought you could be with. Because it means you felt alone, and I’m sorry we didn’t find each other sooner, so you didn’t have to be alone for so long.”
Bucky sighed heavily into the receiver. “Steve,” It came out as a reflex, and he grumbled in his throat at the slip. “Man, why do you do this to yourself? Are you making up your mind about him or do you think he’s making up his mind about you based on this? Because if you think it’s important to him, and you’ve already told him your history, that’s all you can do. He’s gonna make his mind up however he does, and if my experience means anything, it’s not gonna have a whole lot to do with some number. If you’re making up your mind about him, well, you just gotta do that. You gotta decide what matters. Would you like him if the number was a million? Or zero?”
Tony sighed. “I know you’re right, I just don’t want it to be over before it’s really had a chance.”
Steve placed a peck on Tony’s lips, just to tease him a bit. “But really you can thank Jarvis. He showed me some projections of the Reactor and it really helped.”
“Wow, going full Barbara Walters on the first date. I can respect that.” He cleared his throat. “So just so I got this straight, you’re asking me to justify my sex life to you? Bold choice.”
“A picture. Captioned. Tastefully cropped. Don’t worry, I’m not sending pics of my butt to your boy.”
Steve suddenly laughed, a memory came to mind. “Serves that asshole my senior year right. He said I’d never find a husband, just a hooker on a street corner.”
As usual for Tony's life, the media needs to dig their claws into everything, and Steve gets caught in the crossfire.
“I love you, oh fuck, I love you. I’ve never wanted anything else, never knew anything like the way you fuck me.” His voice tightened and his brain blurred and all he could do was echo himself over and over. “fuck me, fuck me, fuck me…”
Tony nodded, nuzzling against the smooth hard presence at his cheek. “God, I’m halfway there already. But yeah, I’m gonna make it real easy for you to get me moaning your name, baby.”
“To the untrained observer, yes,” He retorted. “But actually my recent exercise into trying to express myself through visual art reminded me how long it’s been since I just kinda cut loose and got playful. Do a little engineering-for-engineering’s sake, you know? It’s healthy.” To punctuate his point he grabbed his green juice smoothie and took a long, pointed sip, his eyes locked defiantly on Natasha the entire time.
The conversations they had over dinner flowed easily between them. Tony discussed the tactics he used to keep focus on himself, Steve talked about how the physics he had to do he could barely understand. Before they knew it, the containers were almost empty, and their dinners were finished. And as Steve went upstairs to the shower, he felt weirdly nervous. He was showering in Tony’s home (well, a property) and… it made him think that maybe certain things were moving a bit fast. But he also couldn’t blame Tony for putting him in this position.
Tony smiled. “You look fantastic. Don’t take the pants off yet, though. Might need a little adjusting. C’mere.” He pulled a long, broad, flat box out of his bag and set it on an empty cutting table.
Tony gathered up the dishes and containers and sorted them into the sink or the recycling. It felt kind of silly. Like kids playing house. He’d never actually lived in a suburban home like that. He hadn’t wanted for anything, but his parents’ secure luxury apartment hadn’t had a backyard or a porch. It was his house, but it wasn’t his usual habitat. He expected if he tried to live like this every day, driving out from the city to some little nest where his… somebody was waiting for him, the novelty would wear off fast. Probably. For a fantasy it was pretty nice though, the sound of Steve upstairs moving around, the way he could hear the plumbing when the shower was on, like it was all a living thing. It was nice. He took a few moments just to commit it to memory, knowing it wouldn’t last once things were safe for Steve again. Or safer, anyway.
Tony sucked on his lower lip. “So pick which one you want to wear to the gala so Lucinda can tailor your pants properly.”
“Well, it’s me being a dipshit, obviously, but I just wanted to say… I know it’s your word, and I don’t want you to feel like you can’t vent to me about anything at all and besides that I have no right to ask, but could you not say tr- could you not use the slur that starts with a ‘t’? It really gets under my skin.”
Natasha sighed, and simply walked out. Clearly Tony was being too damn stubborn, and it was her business because it was her boss trying to date her (basically) little brother. She would protect Steve over Tony any day of the week, and if that meant trying to get Tony off of his ass to act like an adult, so be it.
“I can’t really explain it, but there’s just something… magnetic about him. He has so many talents and passions, and an enthusiasm about them that I haven’t seen in a long time. And the things he creates that aren’t weapons, they could change the world. There are times where I think fate might have made a mistake pairing us up, but then we have moments of just being around each other and I never want them to end. He’s amazing, no matter what the tabloids say.”
Steve couldn’t help but notice how carefully everyone seemed not to be noticing them as they crossed the floor to the half-car display. Tony leaned over and whispered something to Bucky, who nodded and cleared out without looking at Steve.
Bruce sat up and leaned his elbows on his desk. “What’s changed between when the audio was first released and when you saw Steve last night?”
“My mom had been diagnosed with cancer when I was 16. Stage 3 lymphoma in her brain. I had been planning on waiting until I was 18 to tell her, but they didn’t give her that long if the tumors didn’t shrink. So when we got home one day, two months after her diagnosis, I sat her down in the living room and told her the truth. She thought I was being selfish at first for telling a sick woman about it, but I said that it was because she was sick that I told her. She didn’t really focus on me coming out as much as her own health… and a year later she was gone.”
Clint smiled. “You’ve been ‘busy’. She knows how you get. She didn’t want to rub it in. I mean, you see what you just did there, right?”
Tony wasn’t showing any restraint at all, eager to show Steve just how fucking bad he wanted him, and to show off his hard-won fellatio skills and well-suppressed gag reflex. He yearned forward, sliding his lips as far along Steve’s shaft as Steve’s gentle grip on him would let him, longing to socket his sweet sensitive prosthesis between his tonsils and squeeze him against his soft palate with his tongue.
Tony nodded. “It’s getting better. Pepper’s doing a bang-up job quietly reminding people how ghoulish and low-brow this sort of thing is. It doesn’t stop people talking, but it makes them talk quieter. But even when this wave has passed, we still gotta figure out how to handle coming out. As a couple I mean.” He crossed and sat, rubbing the back of his neck. “If that’s what you think you want.”
Steve laughed. “Thank you for having the reaction I wanted to have. Now I feel like less of an idiot.”
A grateful smile pushed Tony’s bruised cheeks back and made them ache. “Yeah. But I feel like I didn’t always. So thanks for that.”
Steve’s orgasm hit him like a freight train and he had to bite Tony’s shoulder so he wouldn’t shout. He knew he was gushing into his underwear and onto the sheets, but fuck, Tony wrung the best orgasms out of him. He breathed heavily when he stopped, just barely staving off an asthma attack, and simply held Tony to him.
“I’m not uncomfortable being around you because of it… I guess I’m just… wondering if I’ll be another notch in the bedpost. Because that’s happened a few times and it never ended well.”
Tony parked near Stark Hall on the campus and walked across the quad to Bruce’s office. He’d thought about going with a toned-down outfit and car, but he figured he owed it to Bruce to mine-sweep any press on the way out. But when he got to Bruce’s office, he heard a bellowed “GET OUT” and two reporters fled in fear, not even noticing Tony.
He took himself a little more fully in hand and did his best to draw out the act to a respectable length before he came. But pleasure, love, and vanity were his favorite cocktail, and it wasn’t long before he was gasping Steve’s name like a plea.
Steve swore he could hear his heartbeat in his ears as Tony walked to him. This was it, actually talking to him in real life. What the hell did he say? What did normal people say when they met someone again? He forgot, and he needed to say something because now he was in front of Steve.
Bucky sat down on the low dresser next to where Clint had perched himself. “Look, you just spent a week agonizing over how you didn’t want him to think he could buy you. And he can’t. You gotta keep up that mindset. You don’t gotta live up to his world. You don’t gotta pay him back for anything. Anybody that’s out with you, your presence is paying for itself, you got me? Anything else is just going to make you miserable.”
“Mr. Stark! Does the audio released mean you have a Romantic Soulmate or is this another fling?” One reporter asked.
“The bond, Tony, I’d know if he wasn’t okay. I don’t need intimate details of his sex life. I already can’t look at pudding the same way anymore.”
Steve swore he couldn’t breathe for a moment. That was just… he didn’t know what it was, but it was nothing he’d ever heard before. He couldn’t exactly think of anything else to say but,
Clint clapped him on the back. He sighed and pulled out his phone. “Ok ok. But if he asks why I’m sending him this you better admit that you told me to.” To Steve’s surprise, he didn’t actually take a picture of his marks, just pushed a few buttons with a widening smile and muttered. “Aaaaand send…”
Tony nodded approvingly. “Yes, yes you have. If you think you’ll be ok, I had one other errand to run while we’re in town. Can I leave you two to get acquainted without me foisting my lurid input in every ten seconds?”
Tony picked up his torque wrench, hefted it a few times to try and remember what he’d been doing before she’d interrupted him, and slung it across the floor to skid into the wall. He was in no mood to be told what he had to do as if he hadn’t been working at it as sincerely as his own insecurities would let him at every opportunity. He was definitely in no mood to let his assistant treat him like his whole world getting thrown up in the air was something that was happening to her, and like he ought to curate his confusion to better suit his employee. He was aware as anyone of what a pain in the ass he was, probably moreso, and even he didn’t think he had deserved that level of disrespect.
