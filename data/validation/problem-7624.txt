“Yeah,” Tony says, rubbing a stained hand across his face. “Just trying to get the specs just right on the arc reactor for SHIELD HQ. I figure that if I get it right the first time around it’ll give Fury less cause to be on my ass about it all the time. “
“It’s nothing,” Steve mumbles and Tony’s eyebrows shoot up into his hairline.
So they just stay at home in bed. The tower is one of the only buildings with power thanks to the arc reactor but they dim all the lights so as not to blind the good people of New York in the pitch darkness. Tony sends Steve upstairs to the roof with their trusty blanket and a ton of candles while he goes into the kitchen and puts together something for them to eat.
Their anniversary is in November and it really is a little too cold to be doing this. But between Steve’s abnormal body heat and their blanket they can make it work.
“Ice cream,” she says simply. “And I was going to come down to the workshop to ask if you wanted to come with me. But now you’re here so, let’s go.” And without further ado, she walks right past Tony into the waiting elevator and hits the button for the ground floor.
“Steve? Did you ask for these?”
Tony sighs a deep sigh. “Probably not. He hates himself so much right now I don’t think I could get him to do anything.”
Tony’s breath catches in his throat and his immediate impulse is to
Tony sighs. “I’ll take what I can get.”
Natasha eventually takes pity on Thor and comes out from her position behind them all to get in front of Thor and grab his hands, guiding him around the rink. It’s undoubtedly funnier to watch someone half Thor’s size guide him gently around the ice, but it’s much sweeter, too.
“Guys, I am actually standing right in front of you,” Tony says, defensively. “And he said yes so obviously it wasn’t that bad.”
He doesn’t find anything, though his eyes do almost bug out of his head when they land on the painting of the young man, legs spread wide open, above Steve’s bed.
The teams hoots and hollers as he finally opens up a container of pad thai, tries some, and gives the crew a thumbs up. The camera shakes with Tony’s laughter and they’re all so loud that he doubts that anyone who ever watched the video would have any clue what was going on.
“I’m not a
He grits his teeth to keep from the rest of it from tumbling out. He takes a deep breath and tries again. “If you really loved him you’d let me get you sobered up and bring you home because he’s worried sick about you right now.”
“Steve.”
“No! You’re going to be a miserable bastard whether you don’t tell him or you tell him and he doesn’t return the sentiment. So you might as well tell him. Now I am going downstairs and I am going to wait in my car for exactly five minutes before I drive off and send some very violent S.H.I.E.L.D agents to come bust a cap in your ass. Understood?”
“So Thor and I joined in on the negotiations,” Steve says. “And we struck up a deal.”
Steve doesn’t bother asking how Pepper knows about their situation. Steve learned to stop asking how the women in his life knew anything about anything a long time ago. Instead he stutters out, “We-we’re not-”
“Well I couldn’t let those people die either!” Steve exclaims and Tony knows it’s going to be an argument if he pushes any further and he really doesn’t want to fight with Steve right now.  He falls down beside him on the bed and burrows his face into the blankets by Steve’s knee.
“And why would I do that?”
“I’d think of saying sorry,” she says, a little grin pulling at the side of her mouth. “But I don’t think that I’m doing anything particularly stealthy.”
He turned on his heal without so much as a goodbye and started back towards the door, only to be stopped a few steps later. A deep chuckle he had only heard once or twice before spilled out into the corridor, bouncing off the walls. He turned his one good eye towards the foreign sound.
Fury cuts in while he pauses to take a sip from the bottle. “What’s
“So,” Tony says, pouring out drinks for the two of them. “You’re probably wondering why I called you up here.”
Tony does actually smile at that and Natasha steadfastly ignores them while she opens the utensil drawer and grabs a butter knife. Tony can see where she’s going with this as she angles the knife carefully over the cake.
“Are you seriously asking us to write your wedding vows for you right now?” Clint asks, voice laden with disbelief. “Because that can’t possibly be a thing you expect us to do.”
“Wow, I must love you so much,” Tony slurs and Steve lifts his head, surprised by the random moment of tenderness.
It wasn’t until the house was clean of smoke and toaster remnants and Thor was settled at the kitchen table, happily eating the stack of plain non-toasted poptarts Fury had given him, that Fury noticed just how quiet the house was.
He figured their conversation had ultimately been a win win. If it got through to him, all the Avengers would be in one place, as all the others had moved in weeks ago. It would be easier to keep an eye on them, or dispatch them as a unit.
Tony fidgets nervously and it doesn’t help that no one is saying anything.
He stumbles back up to their room where he’s promptly greeted with a grin and a “Back so soon?”
Tony’s hands shake as he tucks the cards back into his pocket and grasps Steve’s hands in his. He doesn’t think about it too hard, doesn’t allow himself to freak out. He just looks into Steve’s happy, teary eyes and says, “You are my everything. You are my best friend. You are my moral compass. You are the reason I get out of bed in the morning. You are the reason I laugh and smile and
And just as quickly as that moment came, it’s gone again when Tony bursts into a screechy, off key version of “Endless Love” and Clint starts laughing so hard Steve’s actually concerned that he might hurt himself.
Fury heaved a heavy sigh. He knew that he’d been going soft lately, but this was a new level of pitiful.
Tony watches them go, snow from the outside of the grocery bag melting and dripping at his feet, and before he has enough time to worry that he’s been forgotten Betty turns around and extends an open hand.
“I was good friends with your father,” Steve tries.
His other hand is currently clasped between both of Tony’s clammy hands as he waxes poetically about Steve’s chin.
Natasha throws the knife aside, hissing “Goddamnit!” and Tony promptly loses it.
Tony just shrugs and tells him that it’s a
When everyone is done singing, Tony leans down and whispers into Steve’s ear, “Make a wish, sweetheart.”
Fury rolls his eye. Of course. “Well, you know, I know Stark pretty well and while you might handle it that way I’m pretty sure he’d drink himself into a coma if he was in that situation.”
Steve bristles, actually
It had been a really simple procedure to fix some torn cartilage in Tony’s knee. It had been done in fifteen minutes and only left two small incisions on his knee. But the doctors had needed to put him under anesthesia anyway so…
When he steps into the room, Steve is reading a book held easily in his right hand and looking for all the world like he hadn’t actually almost been ripped in half earlier this afternoon. There’s a thick layer of bandages around his torso and his right leg is in a cast up to his hip, but he doesn’t seem like he’s in pain.
Fury ignores him in favor of screaming, “I called you to assemble twenty minutes ago! Your team is out there fighting without you!”
in spandex and leather always knew just how to get to him. He couldn’t even take a deep breath thanks to this mess.
“Excuse me?” he barks down the phone. “Just where are Rogers and Stark?”
“Banner, Barton, and Agent Romanov have gone to the Emporium of Food to fetch us our week’s fare.”
He knows somewhere deep, deep down that he should really just give the book back. But it would take a far stronger man than Tony to resist temptation when a tiny black book falls out of Steve Rogers’ back pocket.
Steve fumbles again, becoming more and more frustrated before spitting out. “Well how about you? Don’t you have any topics of conversation, Mr. Genius?”
“Really?” Steve asks. Tony can tell by his tone of voice that he’s amused by Tony’s dreamland ramblings and he’d protest if he was sure what he saw wasn’t actually a dream. “It wasn’t my apron, was it?”
“Barton, isn’t it enough that you’re tagging along on my Valentine’s Day? This was supposed to be a double date with Bruce and Betty.” Tony shoots a sharp glance towards the edge of the rink, where Bruce and Betty are most decidedly not skating, instead choosing to lean up against the wall making soppy faces at each other.
So now Tony’s crying and holding his index cards like a fool. Steve’s smiling at him lovingly, gently encouraging him like the perfect human being that he is and it kind of makes everything worse. Tony looks down at the cards with the words that aren’t his written on it and his stomach sinks. Steve had given him the most beautiful, truest words that he could.
He surprisingly obeyed without a word. Fury guessed that Thor just assumed he was better versed in how to handle deadly toaster fumes that he was.
They follow his command immediately, running out the door past him as soon as they possibly can.
Tony starts when he first sees her, not expecting anyone to be up and on the common floor. It's been quiet in the tower with Steve and Clint away on SHIELD business in DC and Thor in New Mexico trying to win back Jane.  Tony is getting used to crawling up from his workshop at odd hours without hearing from anyone.
Looking at Natasha, waiting for him expectantly in the elevator, Tony can safely say that today is not that day. But the surprise makes the warmth of the gesture all the sweeter.
Fuck Fury and the eye patch he rolled in on has been Tony’s philosophy since he met the man so there’s no way in hell that he’s ever going to willingly take his advice.
“Oh God, Steve, please” Tony pleads, still highly amused by the put off look on Steve’s face. “Don’t judge 21
Tony, just let me be,” he pleads.
Tony has appendicitis.
Tony opens his mouth and all that comes out is a slightly choked noise and Steve worries for a moment that he might have broken him. “Tony,” he begins, panic starting to settle in.
“You get anything good?” Tony asks, pushing those thoughts away and focusing on Steve’s sketchbook.
They were his assignment. They were a government project he was in charge of. He shouldn’t
He does turn towards the voice at that but it still takes him a minute to pry open his lazy eyes. Clint doesn’t comment on the delay. He’s busy helping Betty set up disposable silverware and open Tupperware full of sliced strawberries and pineapple chunks, his old, dirty Chucks getting even dirtier in the grass.
Because he’s honestly not sure what would have happened with Steve post-picnic if they hadn’t come home to a giant, gaping hole in the wall. Probably something that he shouldn’t be doing, probably something that pushed the envelope way too far.
The glares intensify. Clint outright shoves Thor in the shoulder. Tony is more confused than ever.
“Uh,” Steve hesitates. “It’s very orange. It’s…nice.”
“Takes one to know one, my love,” Steve whispers softly and so tenderly that Tony can’t help but get up and kiss him. Steve’s shoulders are sandy and his lips taste salty from their earlier romp through the water and Tony loves every second of it.
do you think you’re doing, agent?”  the spy yelled.
He sets down the bottle and Fury sighs a sigh of relief, thinking that this entire fiasco has finally reached its awkward end. But then Stark speaks again.
Even though it seems like a throw away question, everyone knows that Bruce means
“Doesn’t look good,” Natasha murmurs from her perch atop a nearby rock. Her hair shines, beet red, in the sun; matches the two red patches starting to bloom on her cheeks.
The look on Steve’s face says that while Tony might not care, he most certainly does and it pulls on Tony’s heartstrings.
Tony turns his face towards Steve and lifts his hazy gaze up to look at him. When Tony’s eyes land on his face they light up like Steve’s the best thing he’s ever seen and it makes Steve’s heart stutter in its place.
“I’d be okay with nearly anything if you agreed to never walk into a burning building again.”
“Where are the others?” he asked, sliding into a chair across the table.
It started last Wednesday when Natasha made him wait two hours so that she could go to the common floor with him to retrieve a book he had left in the living room earlier that day, saying that she just wanted to spend time with him. And then Bruce had insisted that they eat the takeout they had taken home for the team in the living room rather than take it to the other side of the floor where the dining room was. Just this morning, Steve had demanded that they have breakfast in bed rather than join the others in the dining room. Not that Tony had minded but still –
Steve squeezes his eyes shut as another twinge of pain rolls through him. Clint’s words, as sweet as they are, don’t help. Because it doesn’t matter that everyone else thinks they should be together. They’re not.
Tony’s eyes go from Betty, who’s happily sitting in the lotus position like
“He can fly!” Steve manages to get out, a giant grin finally breaking over his face. “How…?”
“Are you kidding me?” Tony demands, feeling like he’s going out of his mind. It’s only four days to Christmas and he can’t help but wonder if this is some sort of weird Dickensian morality lesson where the ghost of Jacob Marley is hiding in his dining room.
“Excuse me?” he asks, still slightly groggy even though somewhere in the back of his mind he’s already placed the voice. “How did you even get this number?”
He’s covered in snow that he’s currently tracking through the tower’s common area but he smiles wide and genuine as he peels his hat off and drops it on a nearby end table. “I was in town. I didn’t think I would have time to stop by but my flight back to DC got cancelled with all of this,” he says gesturing out the window. “I thought I’d stop by and see you.”
“Well, then why aren’t you painting? I don’t even see a sketchpad around here. Have you not been doing any art at all?”
“Have you seen his list?” Tony asks in defense, strolling out into the hall to grab something before coming back into the kitchen. “It’s ridiculously long. I’m going for quantity at this point, not quality of groupings. Besides, we’ll watch
Steve rolls his eyes at that and Tony isn’t even remotely surprised by his sass anymore. He’s just determined to get his hands back on that book.
Steve’s going on day three of bed rest and Tony’s surprised he hasn’t killed anyone yet. Steve’s never been a complainer but this whole
“Good evening, Fury- or is it morning? I’m not really sure,” he rushes out.
Everyone was safe. Tony had slept eight hours last night. The snow was still an untouched blanket over the city. Looking down at it all, Tony takes a deep breath and revels in the rare moment of peace.
He takes a deep sigh and continues, “Buck and I were 10. He made me ride it over and over until we were puking our guts out.”
“Cary Grant, huh?” Tony asks. “You have good taste.”
He’s a very calm drunk. He merely looks Fury up and down as if he’s hardly surprised that he’s there. And when he speaks his words aren’t slurred, just a bit too rushed. Fury assumes that it must be the result of many practiced years of liver abuse.
The thing is, they realize that they’re completely ridiculous and they’ve accepted it.
Tony has a million questions for them. A million things he wants to say. He doesn’t even know where to begin. Even if he did, he can already feel tears in the corners of his eyes and he’s afraid that if he lets himself start talking the waterworks will stop and never end. Instead he settles on stating the obvious fact that he cannot quite wrap his head around.
The elevator dings again when they hit the ground floor and Tony’s smiling.
To say the least, it doesn’t go to plan.
Steve attempts glaring at Tony again and when Tony continues to look at him with the same, unfazed look he gives in with a sigh.
Steve heaves a heavy sigh. “It’s not the best,” Steve admits.
.” Clint says.
But nothing could last forever and there were currently aliens setting midtown ablaze.
Steve drapes himself over his shoulders and nuzzles into the top of his head. “Merry Christmas,” he says. “We love you”
His words are far from innocent but the way he snuffles into the side of Steve’s neck is adorable and pulls on Steve’s heartstrings like nothing else. Between the sentimentality of it being their anniversary and Tony’s nuzzles, Steve can feel the emotion plugging up his throat. He grabs Tony’s hands tighter beneath their cocoon in an effort to keep his mouth shut, to bottle neck all the sappy words that want to come pouring out.
“Tony, don’t look at me like that,” Steve pleads. “I had to do it. And the doctor said I’ll be fine. I won’t even need skin grafts thanks to the serum. Just rest and fresh bandages twice a day.”
“Awhile,” he murmurs in response, making a little noise of discontent as Tony peels away, presses a kiss to Steve’s temple, and rolls out of bed.
To Tony’s credit, Steve does stop trying to draw the sunset.
Nick Fury doesn’t sleep. He waits. And unlike Charlie Sheen, it’s actually true. Because if Nick Fury actually let himself rest for more than two minutes, he’s sure that something somewhere would explode.
Later, after they’ve gotten Tony home and he’s back in his right mind, Steve looks at him and whispers, “Did you mean it? On some level at least? Do you even remember?”
Really, it’s as good as Tony could hope for their wedding to go. Besides, he knows Steve won’t care at the end of the day. Because if it’s one thing that Steve understands about Tony, it’s his stubbornness to never let a good joke die and his snark in the face of opposition.
“Hey, Tony,” he says gently, laying his hand over one of Tony’s as he comes to stand beside him. “How’re you feeling?”
And honestly, how was he supposed to deny an Asguardian holding out a poptart?
Steve looks up at him and there’s a tiny grin on his face and affection in his eyes, which only makes Fury slightly uncomfortable. “Yes, sir.”
“Mhmm,” Steve says slyly. “And don’t think I didn’t notice you putting those M&M’s up there.”
Tony can’t do this. He can’t be in love again. Because he’s just started to piece his friendship with Pepper back together again after months of not talking and it had hurt more than anything to think that he might’ve lost her forever.
“Then I have no choice,” Thor says gravely, though he’s fighting a smile. He promptly uses the fork to poke Bruce’s hand instead. Bruce squawks, laughs, and is half way through an incredulous “Really?” when Clint finally comes into the room.
The Cyclone comes back around the track, its riders screaming as it makes its drop again. But this time Steve doesn’t look back. This time he follows Tony up to his feet and down towards the water.
Tony blinks, once, twice, considers pinching himself, and does a double take but still remains unconvinced that the scene before him isn’t an illusion.
“Tony,” Steve says stiffly. “What’re you doing here?”
“And how would you feel if he disobeyed my orders, did some stupid ass noble thing, and got himself killed?”
thing anymore. This whole day had too much
it’s totally possible for you to be keeping a harem in the tower,” Tony says, sneaking on a pack of M&M’s while Steve hauls a value pack of spilt chicken breasts onto the belt. “However, you and Justin Hammer wouldn’t be a thing in any universe. Your judgment would never be
Tony lets out a bark of laughter at that and before he can say anything more he’s interrupted by someone skating directly into his shoulder. The force of the blow only pushes Tony a foot over into Steve’s space but it’s annoying enough that he knows exactly who’s at his side before he even turns his head.
Steve had brushed him off but it hadn’t deterred him for long. Another few days later he cornered Steve in the elevator and said “You know, I asked JARVIS to scan your storage locker and he said that your oil paints are starting to go bad and your pastels are starting to melt. You should probably bring them up before it gets any worse.”
They all take a moment to glance over towards Jane, who had just flown in the night before, and Thor. They’re standing in a gazebo atop a nearby hill, and while no one can hear what they’re saying to each other, everyone can see Jane’s arms flailing in agitation.
Fury let out a heavy sigh. This plan, as almost every plan that he made involving the Avengers, was a bust. He looked towards the clock and was almost tempted to sigh again when he realized all of this had only taken up a half an hour or so. Great. He wasn’t looking forward going back to HQ and getting his ear chewed off about how he can’t even handle his own team. And he’s pretty sure that if he hangs up on them one more time they might just take disciplinary action.
He eventually finds them in Stark’s bedroom and he’s extremely disappointed in himself when he realizes that he isn’t immediately appalled.
Time slips by and when the elevator door dings behind Tony he actually jumps a little. He turns, expecting to see Betty, and can’t help the minor bolt of panic he feels when he finds Rhodey instead. Much to his chagrin, something must show on his face, because before he even says hello Rhodey says, “Nothing’s wrong!”
“C’mon,” Clint says with an eye roll, as if it’s obvious. “Artist. Scrappy, back-alley kid turned hero. Freezes in the ocean making the ultimate sacrifice. The parallels are uncanny.”
“Did they take anything off of me when they took me into the burn unit?” Steve asks and the way he says it makes Tony think that he’s asking about something very specific though Tony can’t imagine what.
He can feel Tony’s
“I’m your friend,” he settles on, a sick feeling taking over him. He takes his hand off of Tony’s. “And your teammate.”
“Hey, Capsicle.”
“Look at this,” Tony teases, finally turning to meet Steve’s gaze. “Mr. I-don’t-think-this-is-a-good-idea is all for saving the relationship now.”
Tony looks taken aback, putting up his hands in defense, before saying, “Hey, I was just trying to do something nice for you! You used to love sitting on that bench for hours, it was one of the only things that used to be able to relax you!”
Tony tries to imagine anyone giving Natasha trouble with anything but he’s so overwhelmed right now that he can’t even give it a moment’s thought. He couldn’t think straight if he tried.
“Would you prefer dude, perhaps? Man? Bro?”
He’s silent for a bit before he responds, his eyes not moving from Tony. “I’m sorry that I directly disobeyed your orders sir, but I’m not sorry that I did it. If I hadn’t, innocent people would have died. If I had died saving them, I would have died proud. But if I had stood back and let them suffer, I would have never forgiven myself.”
The world doesn’t collapse. Nothing bursts into flames. No one declares their undying hatred for Tony and leaves him alone to die.
“Yeah,” Steve whispers. “We can. And if it’s not, at least we’ll be in it together.”
“Hey, Tony? Are you okay?” Steve asks, voice full of concern.
Steve pauses, holding the last thing in their cart (a box of Ritz crackers) for a moment, before saying, “Thanks, Tony.”
Tony throws himself back into his work and Steve mostly sticks to his promise to keep to himself and sketch, though he does conveniently clear his throat whenever he notices that it’s been a significant amount of time since Tony last took a bite of food.
“I’ve been going to therapy a little more often,” Tony says just to fill the silence. It wasn’t the optimal choice, really, but word vomit is better than nothing in Tony Stark’s book.
“And draw. Or paint. I was in art school before the war,” Steve tacks on in the hopes of distracting him. When he still doesn’t get a response other than a little nod he asks, “What’s yours?”
“Because we’ll totally kill him.”
“The right thing.”
The sun is almost unbearably hot and so bright that Tony has to squint up at Steve, even with his sunglasses on. But the air smells salty and sweet, Tony can hear Thor laugh as he jumps through the waves, a giant golden mountain in the water compared to everyone else, and, best of all, Steve is gloriously shirtless.
Because that’s the thing about wildfires. They all eventually go out.
All of Steve’s worries float away and he lets out a happy, joyful laugh. Tony lifts his face to look up at him like he’s gone insane but Steve can’t hold himself back any more. He presses his lips to Tony’s for the first time in fourth months, letting the overwhelming joy fill him up to the brim as Tony smiles into their kiss.
Steve’s head snaps up from where it was hanging, fingers falling away from where they had been rubbing his temples. He takes in the image of Tony leaning on the doorframe of his shoebox of an office at SHIELD’s New York headquarters and takes a minute to just blink and make sure that he isn’t some sort of paperwork induced haze.
The ball drops and Tony kisses his husband, excited for the year to come.
“What about my ring?” He sounds so distraught that Tony is almost touched. He probably would be if Steve had sounded even half as distraught over almost dying.
“Wha-” Steve starts but is quickly cut off as Bruce scolds Thor for trying to sneak a piece of turkey skin.
“Lay it on me, liaison.”
“So, Steve Rogers,” Tony says, pouring all his heart and soul into his words. “I love you. Will you marry me?”
Tony knows that she means that they’ll get both and share. He knows it because it’s how she’s referred to sharing everything from shawarma to onion rings for nearly a decade.
“I’ll go get him,” Natasha sighs. She gets up to follow him but pauses at the door.
They all sit in silence for a bit before Clint gets out of his chair and walks over to Steve’s boxes, rummaging through them shamelessly. “You got anything in here that we can put up to make this place look a little less like a fuckin’ hospital ward?”
And then Steve, no,
Steve smiles, a big beautiful excited smile, and it chases the last of Tony’s nerves away. Steve opens the door and reaches in to turn on the light. “Merry Christmas, Tony,” he says before finally moving aside so that Tony can walk into the room.
The thought of Steve good and truly hating him, giving him the same empty smiles Pep gives him sometimes when it’s just too weird, ripping apart their little dysfunctional family – it all guts him. His hand shakes so hard around the trowel that he has to let it drop to the floor.
“Ah, can you say that again so that I can record it?” Tony says with a grin, as he threads his fingers through Steve’s hair. Steve huffs out a laugh and pokes him in the ribs. Tony wiggles and laughs but still says, “Hey J, please tell me that you recorded that for me?”
Steve notices Tony in his periphery, walking towards the bench he uses for still life pieces and stretching himself across it like a cat. Between the bright blue of the arc reactor against his shirtless chest and the way his pants roll down to reveal the V of his hips Steve can’t help but be distracted for a moment as Tony writhes on the bench.
Before anyone can go to help him, before they can even toss his shield back to him, an electric force field bursts out of the ground and separates Steve from the group and leaves him defenseless. Tony starts to panic for the first time since this whole ordeal started.
“Oh yeah,” Tony says, trying to keep in a hiss of pain. “I think I overdid it when we were sparring the other day. Must’ve pulled something.”
Tony may or may not break out into a rendition of “My Heart Will Go On.”
Tony doesn’t say anything until he steps on the third or fourth apple core nestled amongst the leaves.
“You don’t look so hot, Tony,” Bruce adds, scrutinizing him over his bowl of fruit and Tony glares at him a little because Steve is bad enough without reinforcements.
They try doing a joint anniversary celebration with Betty and Bruce in the hopes that showing how far they’ve come and celebrating it might help advance their tentative, hesitant attempts at being together again. But Betty’s still in her casts and Bruce ends up leaving halfway through dinner.
There has to be more to it.
Of course.
“This is a momentous occasion,” Tony responds, pointing the camera towards Steve with a smirk. The little red light that shows that it’s recording a video blinks and Steve can’t help the blush that works its way across his cheeks.
“So it’s my old office!” Tony exclaims. “You don’t want me going in my old office?”
Natasha is the first to answer as Fury watches her dodge another blast on the screen. “We hadn’t seen them all day and when we tried to call them before we left JARVIS had been turned off. We figured they had left already but we can’t find them. Do you have their location?”
“But I really want to,” Steve grumbles. His voice is still gravelly but impossibly fond. Tony knows that if he turns his head he’ll meet a pair of warm, besotted eyes to match that tone.
His brows furrow together as Tony remains stiff and silent in his arms and worry fills him. “You know you don’t have to say it back, right?” Steve says, in an attempt to comfort him. He knows Tony. He knows his heart and he knows his history. He doesn’t need Tony’s words.
“And you love the pies!” Betty supplies as she tries to hoist herself into the tree. Bruce drops the bag of apples he had been holding in favor of diving to make sure Betty doesn’t fall and break her neck. The apples roll away. Steve laughs again, harder this time.
When the S.H.I.E.L.D higher-ups had first appointed him the head of the Avengers initiative, Nick Fury had never thought it’d boil down to this.  All the job description said was to give them orders and get their asses into gear. He’d always known Stark would be a pain, but he’d never expected it to be like this.
Steve nods against Tony’s neck.
Tony’s pretty sure his brain is fried. It’s gone. It’s completely dead, gone, and seized in perpetual awe at the sight of Steve Rogers in yoga pants
“Yep,” Steve says with a nod. “And as far as safety goes, Coulson was the lead designer on this so I think it’s as safe as it gets.”
Tony’s voice is warm and rumbly in his ear, full of self-satisfaction, and Steve can’t even bother to do anything but snort out a chuckle and lean into Tony.
comes to the head of the bed and kisses him fiercely, only breaking away to smile against his lips.
Tony turns back to the movie and doesn’t bring it up again that evening. But he never does get into
Tony lets out a sigh of relief.
He turns on his heel and heads for the elevator up to his and Steve’s quarters, expecting Natasha to say her goodbyes and head out on her own. What he doesn’t expect is for Natasha to say, “I’m just going down the block to the grocery store. I think they don’t close until 12.”
“Tony, could you hand me the bananas?” Steve asks.
“The thing that bothers me now that I’m older and, I guess, wiser?” Tony takes a pause to think and Steve doesn’t push. “Well, there’s a lot of things that bother me about it. But one of the things that I think about a lot is my mother’s piano. She had this beautiful white baby grand piano. And when they died I couldn’t bare to look at it anymore. So I sold it.”
“Fine.” Steve says, breaking after a brief stare down. “No more vampires though.”
“Ah, no,” she says, averting her gaze for the first time. “My father wasn’t very supportive of women in the military. He pretty much left me to my own devices.”
“Didn’t we all,” Steve murmurs, completely immersed in the movie. Tony’s eyes nearly bug out of his head at Steve’s unfiltered confession. He spends a good five minutes imagining pre-serum Steve drooling over Walter Burns in the theater while Steve remains engrossed.
Fury pushes the thought away with a grimace, coming to a dead halt in the middle of the hallway. He scowls up at the ceiling for a moment and grumbles, “Shut up, Phil,” before walking out in the cold night air.
Tony cuts his gaze to the side to find that Natasha and Clint are carrying at least five bags of apples between them. Steve and Bruce are flanking Betty at a nearby Granny Smith tree. Steve is carrying what is easily ten pounds of apples without breaking a sweat. Bruce is holding open another bag while Betty keeps adding to the pile.
“I don’t have a problem with him,” Tony says, a little twinge of awkward seeping into his tone at having to defend his feelings for a fictional character. “I just think his death wasn’t necessary. He made the wrong call.”
“Hey,” Tony muses, “I totally think I can see that Mexican joint we went to with Bruce the other day from here. Babe, look, look down there! I can totally see the neon maracas! Now that is an achievement, call the record books. We have a winner for the most obnoxiously bright neon sign in all of New-”
Tony smiles a sad little smile at him and steps across the hallway to stand right in front of him. He brings a hand up to Steve’s cheek and he presses so gently that his touch is just barely there. “You’re such a good man,” Tony says, voice raw and earnest and tender in a way that Steve’s never heard from him before. “You see the best in everyone. It’s obvious to you. But to people like Bruce. Like me…Steve,” he trails off for a moment. “Steve if I ever hurt you like that I’d never forgive myself.”
“And you think it’s a good idea to practice right above Banner’s head?” Fury asked, incredulous with a hand on his hip.
He just sort mentions behind his shoulder and mutters, “I think I’m hallucinating.”
Steve seems to see through him though. He lurches forward and swipes the book out of Tony’s grasp. There’s a slight blush on his face that gives away his embarrassment through his façade of anger and it makes Tony even more curious.
Steve, Thor, and Natasha are already fully laughing at them when Clint asks “Is this when I make the obligatory how many PhDs does it take to light a fire joke or are we waiting until after we’ve all missed the ball drop?”
Tony tries to get into
It’s been close to six months since the kissing incident, and they’re always so disgustingly
Steve snorts, a snotty, teary snort, but a definite noise of amusement and Tony smiles because if it’s one thing that he’s good at in this relationship it’s his ability to pry a laugh out of Steve at any given moment.
When Tony had agreed to this plan, the idea of Thor in ice skates hadn’t even been a glimmer of a thought in the far reaches of his mind. Seeing it right in front of his eyes is something that Tony is certain that he will never be able to wipe from his memory.
“So I’ve been told,” Steve responds, smiling lightly but not looking away from his work.
It’s quiet for a moment and Tony resists the urge to push for more. His patience is rewarded when Steve clears his throat and says, “Uh, I went to bring Peggy flowers like I always do a couple of days ago and the room was empty.”
“You taste like chocolate chip cookies,” Steve says against his lips.
“Love?” he finally asks. “Is this about Potts again?”
“What?” Steve wonders, slightly dazed and still coming down from the abrupt end to their anticipated blow out.
“It’s perfect,” Steve says. “But I’d like to wear it as my wedding ring too. You okay with me not wearing a ring until then?”
This is when Steve usually nods and heads back upstairs. This time he hesitates.
“Why didn’t you call me? I would’ve come home. Why didn’t you tell
Steve looks just as soft and just as adoring as Tony anticipated, and he can’t help but melt into the sheets. They say nothing for a moment, just taking one another in. Tony raises his hand to Steve’s face and traces his fingers across his cheekbone, over his ear, and around his jaw to his lips. Steve waits a beat, kisses the fingers hovering over his lips softly, and then says “Can I say it now?”
He cut off the call before he could hear Pepper’s rush of thank you’s.
Steve, like this wasn’t impossible.
“Practicing,” he said, as if it should be obvious.
Steve opens his mouth to counter but his response is cut off by a shower of popcorn raining down over their heads.
Once he’s settled he lays his head back on Steve’s shoulder and says “I think I just saw Nick Fury. Teaching Thor how to use a toaster. In an apron.”
He took a deep breath, trying to calm himself even though he didn’t really relax until he finally saw Captain America’s blue and red uniform flash across the screen.
“I love you,” Steve blurts, the emotions finally bursting out of him at Tony’s babbling about
He breaks off to look away, biting the inside of his cheek as if he needs to ground himself or else the words won’t come out right. And Steve can relate. He knows that his eyes are just as suspiciously glassy as Tony’s are and his throat’s so full he can barely breathe.
Tony watches as the team advances farther into the room, the others hanging back behind Cap and waiting for their orders. Steve looks just about ready to open his mouth and start doling out orders when the floor tiles beneath Steve’s feet buckle, causing him to fall backward and his shield to go skittering back towards the team.
“And here I thought I knew everything,” Tony says barely above a whisper, as he looks at Steve watching the movie.
He unclenches and flexes his hand after dropping the pen he had been holding for what seemed like hours. “They tell me all this paperwork is going to make a difference though so I have to try. It doesn’t make the whole thing any less frustrating.”
“No,” he says with a yawn. “It was pink. And frilly. I think it was that gag gift Clint got Bruce a while back.”
Steve jumps in shock when he closes the door behind him and turns to see Tony standing across the hall from him, silently looking at him with an unreadable look.
“Excuse me?” Fury said, head snapping up from where he was looking down at his various screens. “Do firemen consider being able to go back to the firehouse charity?”
“Nice to meet you,” Steve says as he holds out a hand to shake hers, trying to be as nice and warm and welcoming as he can possibly be. “I’m Steve Rogers.”
“Excuse me, Stark. But did you just see me and
“Bye, Tony,” he says firmly, hoping that Tony’s drug addled brain will distract him again.
“What the-” he muttered, crouching low and covering his mouth with his jacket sleeve as he moved closer to the source of the smoke. The smell of burnt food flooded him as he entered the kitchen and pretty soon he could see the source of the problem.
“Don’t you know when to keep your mouth shut?! I could end your life with a swish of my hand!” M.O.D.O.K screeches and Tony rolls his eyes. Because really? The guy looks like a floating gnome and sounds like a shrill nine year old throwing a temper tantrum.
“What?” Tony exclaims, highly perturbed by Steve’s answer. “What? Is there not enough room in here or something? Do the windows not give you enough light?”
With the amount of time Tony had imagined the awful things that had happened to it, it’s almost the biggest shock to see it all in one piece. He walks forward stiffly and runs his hands over the edge of it reverently. He finds the notch in the wood where he had tripped and dented it when he was seven. He sits down on the bench and realizes that even this is the original as he finds the stain in the leather he had made when he accidentally laid a hand down on it while it was still dirty with motor oil.
Tony loves science. He loves working through equations and pushing his brain to the limit. But more than anything he loves this. He loves getting his hands dirty. He loves futzing and fiddling until he’s covered in grease from head to toe, until his fingers ache and he’s barely able to keep his eyes open.
Steve looks adorably boggle-eyed as he tries to genuinely soak everything in while the rest of the team passes around paper plates and settles down at the table beside him.
“Hey Steve,” Tony calls out, shaking Steve out of his stupor.
“It’s 11:30. Where are you going?” he asks.
“Don’t get all cute on me now,” Tony says and he throws himself onto the bed beside Steve. He wiggles around like the giant cat that he is until he’s properly shoved the book out of Steve’s lap and situated himself there instead. Steve rolls his eyes in annoyance but he pulls Tony closer all the same.
After he drops Tony back at the mansion, he doesn’t hear or see from any of the Avengers or their friends for about a month. It’s not that he doesn’t care, as much as he doesn’t have time. Almost immediately after the hotel incident, he’s called away on a mission in the Peruvian Andes and has no contact with anyone outside of his team.
“You all,” he pauses to swallow. “You found my mother’s piano.”
Steve looks up from his book to get a good look at his boyfriend, looking for any signs of intoxication or mind control, before clearing his throat and saying, “Pardon me?”
He’s perfectly fine with staying in relationship limbo with Steve Rogers for the rest of his days. Yep. It’s completely fine. Honestly, he hadn’t even expected Steve to forgive him after his minor panic induced bender so the fact that that had happened and that they were still doing the frequent kissing thing is really enough for Tony. This was nice. He could contain his feelings and not risk the team or his friendships. It was great. This was fine. Totally, completely fine.
“Ow!” Tony says, hamming it up for effect. “This is how you treat the man that you’re going to be marrying in a month on this very roof.”
each other,” Steve says, on the verge of falling apart.
Steve paints the most beautiful sunrise the next morning as Tony presses kisses down his neck.
He trails off as he searches for the right words. Tony meets his eye in the reflection of the mirror and raises an eyebrow as Steve fidgets and flounders.
Steve wrings his hands in the waiting room as he waits for the doctor to come out of surgery with any news. He knows the death by appendectomy isn’t really a thing that happens but it doesn’t really stop the worry.
“Bruce, I think the stupid thing’s defective,” Tony says, tapping at the base of the fireplace with a wrench from his open toolkit. “I’ll design a better one in the morni-“
“Are you sure? I know he’d love to see you,” Steve tries, an edge of desperation creeping into his voice.
“I called you in twenty minutes ago!”
“Look,” Steve says, slipping into that tone of voice that is 100% back-alley Brooklyn kid,
“Tony!” Steve squawks.
A musty scent pours out of the room as soon as the door swings open and the door creaks in protest at being opened again after so long. The room is eerily quiet when Steve steps in and the only movement is the dust swirling in the light pouring in through the cracks in the blinds. Steve sets the boxes down on the bed and takes in the blank gray walls and the cream carpet and the pristinely folded white sheets on the bed.
“They were very good cookies,” Steve says, breathing a sigh into Tony’s neck. He knows when Tony can be dissuaded from doing something and Steve has a feeling that this is not one of those times.
“Are you sure that you’re my
“Mrs. Banner!” Rhodey says with a grin, laughing as Betty seems to drop all of her bags to the floor at once with one large thump. He and Tony walk over and start scooping groceries into their arms as Betty starts peeling layers off.
“Steve, you are the most important thing in the world to me,” Tony says, trying to be as earnest and serious as possible. “But if something happened to Pepper, I’d go off the deep end. She meant something to you. That doesn’t change how you feel about us.”
That’s when he finally hears it. He hears a little sob-sniffle coming from behind the bathroom door. “Steve?” he asks and he hears it again.
“Ugh, that monstrosity? No, thank God,” Steve says, annoyance heavy in his voice. “You can thank Clint for that. He bolted it into the wall so that I can’t even take it down. I finally got him to agree to put a Caravaggio print in there though so it’ll at least be art historically prescient soft core porn.”
“I don’t know,” Steve says, shrugging and avoiding Tony’s eyes when he backs out of their hug. “I guess, I just don’t want anyone thinking that I mourn that part of my life, you know? I’m happy here with the team. With you.”
It was torture. Torture to have Tony so close, acting like there wasn’t anything wrong, but still be denied the one thing he wanted. He supposes that he should be grateful that Tony is so willing to build up a friendship with him, grateful that he can have Tony in any capacity. But in this matter he can’t bring himself to be any but selfish, can’t force his heart to want anything else.
for him, and Tony had kissed him like the giant fool he was. And Steve, perfect, precious
“Hardy har har,” Tony responds, half-hearted at best. He pokes at the logs at the base of the fireplace dejectedly. “Just because you can’t appreciate my application of the scientific method doesn’t mean that we aren’t going to get this done.”At this point, not one single person is bothering to suppress their laughter and Anderson Cooper’s live coverage of Times Square has been long forgotten. The common room is dark and cool, the only light coming from the TV flashing between the ball waiting to drop and the poor freezing tourists. Nat and Clint are pressed together, shoulder to knee, on the loveseat beneath an impressive mound of blankets while Steve and Thor sit on the couch in their t shirts and thin cotton pajama pants like it isn’t thirteen degrees outside.
Tony looks down and realizes that his hand that isn’t in Steve’s is clenched in a fist at his side. He unfolds his fingers slowly. He knows that they’re not going to hurt him. He trusts them all. But there is something decidedly weird about all of this.
It’s a little stupid and it’s corny but it makes Steve smile. It’s the first time he’s felt like a part of not a team, not an organization, but a
And while Nat and Clint are slow to turn their heads back to the picnic blanket and move towards the food, Tony moves on before she even started speaking. He slouches toward Steve and is egged on by the easy, happy smile he receives for his approach.
“Well, time flies when you’re having fun,” Tony quips. “Fighting crime, being generally awesome, takes up a lot of time in the year. And then you gotta add in all the mind-blowing orgasms. I mean, really, it’s a shock that we got anything done at all.”
them.
They whine a lot but Steve knows that they’re happy for them if only because Steve and Tony are happy.
The trace leads him to a hotel that doesn’t exactly look seedy but still manages to have that ‘if I slip you a few hundreds under the table, you never saw me’ kind of feel. In fact, he’s pretty sure he saw a senator in the lobby.
“Hey babe, look at this. We made the cover of
“Do you identify with Jack, Steven?” Tony asks slyly. He knows he’s got Steve when he doesn’t answer but merely rolls his eyes and grumbles as he heaves himself out of his chair.
after their night in the lab but he had promised to repress them, to ignore them, to write them off as lust gone sentimental.
of all things, and Tony freezes.
“So I’ve called you all here for a reason,” Tony says, laying index cards and pencils in front the three men sitting across the table from him. Bruce, Clint, and Coulson all look at him with the same look of disinterest and mild confusion as he talks. “And that reason is that I am marrying Steve Rogers in a little over a month and he has requested that we write our own vows. The problem with this is that knowing him, his vows are going to be unnervingly perfect and I don’t want to let him down with my inability to speak genuinely from my heart.”
Tony finds himself blinking once, twice yet again before focusing his gaze on Steve. There’s popcorn in his hair, a blush tinting his cheeks pink, and he won’t meet Tony’s gaze. Tony’s heart melts at the sight.
“What?” Fury said, still confused. Or maybe that was just the smoke getting to him.
Tony absolutely perks up at that, preening at his tuxedo-clad reflection in the glass. Tony disentangles their hands only to press his hand to Steve’s lower back. “You don’t look so bad yourself,” he replies, ogling Steve in his dress greens. He reaches up to press his lips to Steve’s ear and says, “I swear, I think that you just wear this thing because you know it makes every being with a pulse drool at the sight of you.”
“Oh,” Steve says, obviously a little taken aback. “That’s good. Has it been helping?”
“Now see, this is where this movie just gets stupid,” Tony scoffs. Steve is settled against his side and is absolutely riveted to the screen. His back is warm against Tony’s arm, his lips are parted, and his eyes are big and glassy white-blue in the darkness of the movie room. It’s almost enough to distract Tony. Almost.
“You wanna talk about it?” Steve’s driving them home. They had gone up to Buffalo – far but not too far - for a quiet, snowy weekend and it had been wonderful. But now all Tony can see are icy patches in the dark bends of the road and he feels his heart in his throat. And of course, wonderful Steve doesn’t even have to look at him for more than a moment to know what he’s thinking about.
“I’m sorry sir,” JARVIS says, prim and proper as always. “But I didn’t think it was an appropriate moment to save.”
“He can’t do any worse than Natasha,” Betty reasons. It’s unusual for her to call someone out in such a blunt matter, but Natasha herself doesn’t disagree with her assessment.
Tony looks at him appraisingly and Steve’s not sure if Tony is going to come back at him with a well-crafted, pessimistic barb or a change of subject so Steve strikes before Tony can speak again.
“Nothing,” Tony says, deciding not to pursue to the Cary Grant crush any further. He files it away for later. “I was just thinking that as much as we enjoy Cary, we have to start getting you into films made after 1945.”
“How?” Tony forces out, his throat scratchy, because he doesn’t even know where they would have begun.
“Look at those eyes,” Tony moans mournfully. “So pretty and honest and
“Who’re
“Nah,” Steve says, trying to keep his tone light and failing. “It’ll take more than M.O.D.O.K to outsmart any of us. But, I would’ve if I had to. If I knew it would keep you safe.” Steve shakes him a little when he sees that Tony’s eyes are nearly completely closed. When Tony’s refocused on him Steve shoots him a nearly blinding smile that’s a little forced around the edges and says, “I could never leave my best guy behind.”
Steve clears his throat and says, “This was a nice idea Tony, but I just don’t think it’s going to-“
but convinced that it was as good as it was going to get. They had finally gotten to a point where it had been tolerable, amicable even, and then Tony had to come uproot all of the things Steve had worked so hard to bury with his mixed messages.
Tony groans and presses his face into Steve’s neck. Steve honestly has no clue what to do in this situation. It’s just too bizarre.
On their third anniversary they go on a picnic in the park, just like the one that kicked off their entire relationship.
“I don’t know. I tried to go to the movies a while back in Brooklyn, right after I had gotten out of the ice, and all they were playing was this movie…
Tony swivels his head to see Betty, holding a plate of mini quiches and staring at them with a look that some would call piteous. He can hear Steve’s sharp spike of laughter as his face falls and Bruce plops out onto the floor beside him with a simple “Oh.” Clint groans in disappointment.
Their Thursday movie nights turn into a team event instead of a date. Clint pulls through on his promise and gets Steve a giant painting of a half-naked man staring lustily out at the viewer. He can see Steve is hesitant so he bolts it into the wall above Steve’s bed with SHIELD tested screws. They finally get Dr. Doom behind bars. He escapes. They get him again. Summer settles in. Betty drags them all to the beach Steve ignores the heat of Tony’s stare on his back as he, Nat, Clint, and Betty play chicken. They have a small party for his birthday. Tony gives him an awkward hug and a set of paint brushes. Steve doesn’t tell him that his supplies are still rotting away in his storage locker. He just smiles a stiff smile and thanks him. He starts visiting Peggy again more regularly, making a habit of bringing her fresh flowers every week. They finally give him a real office at SHIELD HQ and he pours more effort into his extra projects. In late July the team watches as Steve does the media circuit to publicize the new bill he’s helping to push through Congress to decrease wait times at the VA. There’s another, only slightly less awkward hug, when the bill gets pushed through.
every once and a while.”
There’s no way that there’s a version of me that isn’t ass over elbows for you.” His words sound so earnest, so real that Steve can hardly take it.
“Rocky road?” he asks as he gets onto the elevator beside her.
Betty usually does join him for whatever movie is on AMC that night though. She usually comes to visit a few times a week and things between her and Bruce seem to be going well. It’s nice to see their relationship coming together even when Steve has yet to wake up without feeling the dull hollow ache of loss in his chest. It’s even nicer to have found a new friend in her.
He likes to think it hadn’t always been this way, that in the beginning it had been strictly S.H.I.E.L.D related nagging. But the more he thinks about it, the more he thinks that it was never so.
Because Betty Schaer? She’ll fit in just fine.
Steve perks up adorably at the mention of being a husband and just says, “I’m not lying. I appreciate the effort even though it’s not your color.”
“Tony, we’re a couple. All couples fight.”
Tony just brushes him off with a swipe of his hand. “This isn’t even that big of an event. She’ll be fine. I wouldn’t have suggested that Bruce bring her if I didn’t think that she could handle it,” he says, going back to fixing his cufflinks like it’s nothing.
Tony looks over and sees that Steve is staring at him and he snorts at his cheesiness but he brings the food over and settles in beside him anyway. Steve takes the plate gratefully and digs in enthusiastically. Tony’s been on edge all day, a little nervous at the thought of what he might do tonight. He’d thought that he would have to put it off when Steve had insisted on having Bruce and Betty tag along but now they’re here and they’re alone and it seems like almost the perfect moment sitting among the candles and the darkness.
“What brings you here anyway?” Steve asks.
There’s a slight stutter in Tony’s breath and Steve can feel Tony’s hand trailing lower. “If only everyone knew how absolutely
Steve goes stock still with mortification. Clint laughs so loud Tony can hear him from across the room. Everyone else is generally confused.
“Well look at that,” Tony says with a smile. He pushes away from the table and grabs his drink in one hand and Steve’s wrist with the other. Steve follows after him without resistance and as short as it was he thinks that Tony’s plan might just have worked.
“I don’t know why I think this is a good idea every year,” Tony says even though he can’t deny that he’s reveling in the crisp air and the orange and red leaves all around his feet.
Steve looks up at him with a crooked grin and nods. “Yeah. I’m happy that you’re home.”
“Yeah, Tony, but that doesn’t mean that she’s great match for Bruce. I mean, do you even see Bruce being open to dating anyone? We’ve known the man for over two years now and he’s still a little detached.”
“Tony are you sure that this is best place to be introducing this girl to everybody?” Steve asks. He tries to keep his tone serious though it’s hard not to be distracted by the mirrors and crystal surrounding them in the small space of the elevator. “I can barely make it through these things in one piece and that’s without me having to meet four very…”
And frankly, if he couldn’t make things work with Pepper how can it ever work with Steve? And what happens then? When he inevitably fucks things up and Steve breaks it off?
Tony closes his eyes and soaks it in and all he feels is warm. For now, dark winter nights are forgotten.
Tony watches as she slips on an old pair of tennis shoes and can’t help but agree. But he still says, “Sounds exactly like what a spy that was up to something would say.”
The sun is just starting to set and Thor and Clint are starting to pile up the fireworks under the watchful eye of Fury and Maria Hill. The air still smells heavily of charcoals and barbeque sauce and firecrackers. It has been a perfect day with his friends on the roof on the tower, barbequing and relaxing and enjoying the day.
Tony closes his eyes and leans into it all. The others eventually pile on top of him in a ridiculous dog pile, sneaking in noogies and squeezing him tight. He feels perfectly at home.
“Excuse me?” Steve asks, his heart racing so fast it feels like it’s in his throat.
Steve feels the tension creeping back into his shoulders the more he thinks about it. He lets out a deep breath and focuses back in on Tony who is looking around his office like it’s torture chamber.
This year the fireplace starts up without a problem.
” Tony cuts him off. He sounds pitiful and on the verge of tears. “I don’t want my last memory of this to be of the two of us fighting.”
“All for the best.” Steve coughs, clearing his throat of any lingering huskiness. “Last time I kissed you in a public elevator the press had a field day.”
“He didn’t do anything wrong,” he says and it’s the truth. “I was out of bounds. He had a right to dump me.”
“I’m old. I’m over the hill.”
“Oh don’t act like you’re mad that we crashed!” Clint says as he falls into line with Tony and Steve on the ice, matching their speed. “You love us too!”
They just look at each other for a minute. Tony digs his toes in the sand and soaks in the warmth. The wind off the ocean blows Steve’s damp hair to and fro but Steve doesn’t move his hand from Tony’s to try and push it back into place. Tony turns his head and places a quick kiss right next to Steve’s belly button. Steve’s small grin grows into a full smile and Tony feels on top of the world.
“Steve, that fire was so hot it practically disintegrated your gloves. If the ring did manage to survive it was probably a mangled mess by the time they got you out,” Tony explains, trying to keep the bitterness out of his voice.
And it looks like the question shocks Steve nearly as much as it shocks Fury. A blush forms high in his cheeks as his gaze darts away from the director. “Of course I do.”
It’s one of those moments where Tony has to pause and consider what Steve needs. Tony knows it’s hard for him. He knows that it’s been seventy-five years but the guilt of watching his best friend die is still as fresh as if it happened yesterday. Tony also knows a thing or two about guilt and he knows that anything he says won’t change a thing. He settles on taking Steve’s hand, the one planted next to Tony’s shoulder on the beach towel, and wrapping it in his. He settles their intertwined hands on top of the arc reactor without a word and is rewarded with a tiny grin. Tony does everything but outwardly preen.
And then the elevator dings, the door slides open, and Steve jumps away from Tony like he’s on fire. Tony grumbles, obviously displeased, but he doesn’t pull away when Steve goes to grab his hand and pull him out of the elevator.
He nods and Fury isn’t surprised when he slides into the passenger seat precisely four minutes and fifty-nine seconds later. He says nothing, but his lips do twitch up when his eyes land on the GPS system Fury had used to guide him to the hotel. And Fury thinks that maybe it was less that he hadn’t learned how to avoid S.H.I.E.L.D’s eyes and more that he just might have wanted to be found this time.
“Are you serious? You’ve been living in my tower for approximately three seconds and you’re already getting judgy?”
“Captain,” Fury had barked through the phone. “Just where the hell are you?”
“Five more minutes, mom,” Tony grumbles and Fury looks like he’s about to blow a gasket.
Rhodey just laughs and Betty hits Tony’s shoulder hard enough to push him back a few inches. “Hey! Don’t hate because I’m…” she breathes a deep and ridiculous sigh. “Incandescently happy.”
Steve doesn’t remember the last time he’s gone a day without laughing, even if it’s against his will. His nightmares have ebbed and he sleeps through the night now that he does so with Tony in his arms. He has never felt so healed, so completely loved.
Steve lets out a sound that’s a mix between a laugh and a sigh, before reaching out for Tony’s hand. “Should’ve known that this was too big a surprise to keep under wraps,” he says. “C’mon sweetheart, we have something to show you.”
And when they’re gone all that’s left behind is a valley of ash.
Steve was absolutely fuming. Why couldn’t Tony leave well enough alone? Why did he feel it necessary to rip into Steve’s barely healed wounds like it meant nothing?
He hears Tony pad over to him and feels his fingers ghost over his shoulders but doesn’t let himself get distracted. He’s not even swayed when Tony presses a series of kisses to his neck, dripping shower water from his hair onto his back. This time the noise Tony makes is a clear sigh of disappointment as he moves away and around the side of the bench.
“Well I programmed him so…” He trails off, looking down at Steve’s head. “You okay, beautiful?”
There was a time when Tony would’ve responded to Steve saying that by throttling him. Or at least by making a snippy comment. He wonders where that Tony went because he knows how it’s going to go. He knows that he will still be here in the morning and he knows that Steve will come down and poke and prod him until he leaves the lab to go get some fresh air or sleep or eat.
Tony’s shaking a bit and his mouth is dry but he’s sure that he wants to do this. After four years, he’s surer about this than he’s ever been about anything in his life.
“Tony,” Bruce says, someone finally speaking. “We’re not exactly leading you to your doom here. You can unclench.”
“Debatable,” Tony says, unimpressed. “At best.”
“Yeah,” Tony says and turns on his heel. Steve looks back at his paperwork, tension already weighing down his shoulders again.
But instead he found himself walking through the empty halls of the S.H.I.E.L.D infirmary. He figures that it had been long enough that there shouldn’t be any more visitors. He didn’t want to do this with anyone else around. It didn’t seem right.
Steve snorts but considers the question anyway. He scrunches up his face and rubs his thumb against the condensation on the side of his glass as he searches through old memories, memories before the war and Erskine. A lifetime and a half ago.
Tony raises an eyebrow at him in a silent question.
Steve had been fine with how things were between him and Tony. Well, not
He skims the book while Steve goes back to cooking, rolling his eyes and muttering and
Spangles. Cap. I mean,
Tony’s head is pillowed on Steve’s lap, the rest of him sprawled on a beach towel. He looks up at the line of Steve’s jaw as he turns back to look towards the Cyclone. Tony can hear the distant screams of its passengers as it takes its signature eighty-foot drop.
Things go back to how they were after that. The barriers go back up. Tony doesn’t try for anything else other than casual friendliness. Steve almost misses it and it makes him want to punch himself for being so stupidly contrary. But it’s fine. It’s all good and fine. For a while at least.
“Babe, even I don’t have a joke for this,” Tony admits, beside himself.
Steve feels warmth go through his chest and he grabs Tony’s hand and pulls him against his side. “Nah,” Steve murmurs, pressing a kiss to the top of Tony’s head. “You just look handsome tonight.”
, face.
He did good.
?” Steve says rolling his eyes. He’s smiling a little, that twitchy half smile he gets when he doesn’t want to be amused but he is anyway. Tony knows his annoyance is just for show when Steve says, “Maybe I put together my harem so that I could have people who help me check out at the supermarket.”
They’ve kissed a grand total of three times. But they’ve never talked about it. They don’t treat each other any differently than they did before they added kissing to their list of shared activities. No one’s certainly asked anyone else out on a date.
“Hulk ran through it like it was nothing and smashed the circuit breaker,” Steve explains. “We were able to get through his ‘droves’ pretty easily after that.”
He’s disappointed that Tony’s heading towards the door already but not shocked. Steve’s actually more surprised that he’s gotten this much conversation out of him. Tony usually doesn’t function until he’s had at least two cups of coffee.
He looks up at his liaison, the man who demanded that this be a team event, feels a sudden burst of unexpected fondness that he hadn’t ever expected to feel for the likes of Tony Stark.
“Takes one to know one, buddy,” Steve teases.
He runs a heavy hand through his hair before he turns to Steve with a look of confusion.
had kissed him back and held his hand and
“I mean, maybe he’ll be a little hesitant but I’ll talk to him. It’ll be all good!” Tony says, sounding like he’s trying to convince himself as much as he’s trying to convince Steve.
Tony’s propped up on a mound of pillows on his bed. His eyes are soft and his hair askew. Steve expects him to say no outright or at the very least deflect with jokes until Steve gives up.
Tony and Clint both quiet down as per her request but Tony can feel Clint shaking with restrained laughter at her look of concentration and it does nothing to help him keep his own laughter at bay. They watch as she tries to cut the W in Stew into a separate v and near-e type shape. It fails miserably as the red frosting trails behind the knife on its downward swipe, turning Stew into Stey /.
What’s worst is Tony’s unceasing interest in why Steve isn’t using his art supplies. Steve almost feels that every other action Tony’s made is all a part of his main goal, which is to badger Steve until he starts drawing or painting again.  It started the day after the Hitchcock marathon when Tony had come up to him in the kitchen and said, “Hey, are you sure that the storage lockers are the best place for you art supplies? It gets really humid down there in the summer.”
He had known that he had
Steve’s knee jerk reaction is that he should move back to Brooklyn but he knows that he can’t abandon his team. Tony tells him that he can stay in their quarters and that he’ll move into one of the guest suites during a stilted conversation a few days after they’ve broken up. Steve doesn’t accept the offer simply because it just isn’t fair. That was Tony’s room before and it should be his room after.
Steve just starts to punch the punching bag even harder, hoping that Tony will get the idea and leave him alone.
“Sorry we’re late,” Tony says as they approach the table, seemingly over his grumbling. “Steve was getting a little handsy in the elevator.” But then again, no.
Tony’s gaping at him, lips moving soundlessly as he searches for something to say in the wake of Steve’s rage and he can’t.
Tony does love a good pie.
He didn’t hear her coming down the hall until she spoke. It was the only fact about this situation he wasn’t surprised about.
Steve just feels heavy and spent. His eyes are watery and his limbs are weighing him down. “I can’t do it anymore so
“Obviously you can’t if you willingly paid money to watch a film that had the words Abraham Lincoln and Vampire Hunter in the title. At least let me show you some decent movies,” Tony counters, almost breaking the playful mood with how deathly serious he is about correcting Steve’s cinematic wrongs.
“Don’t you say it,” Tony groans, his words slightly slurred from sleep.
“Director Fury,” Steve said, looking up when he heard him enter. His words were a quiet echo in the empty room and his jaw was set tight, as if he had been prepping for Fury reaming him out all day.
“Sort of,” Steve responds, uneasy as Tony fills his own glass just little bit higher than the socially acceptable amount. “Do you ever slow down with that stuff?”
Instead he just grins politely and switches his focus back to the sunset. He tries not to laugh too obviously when Tony huffs and pouts loudly.
Eventually Tony’s arms go heavy and the calluses on his fingers start to crack and bleed and he physically has to turn away from his work. He turns to look at Steve to see that he’s barely awake, fingers dragging his pencil back and forth blindly as his eyes become heavier and heavier.
Everyone was here and everyone was safe. Tony couldn’t ask for more and yet he had a whole year’s worth of happiness to look back on too. He snuggles closer to Steve as the countdown to enters the last thirty seconds and Steve pulls him close.
a walking, talking American flag. Cap was…” He hesitates, not sure if this is too deep, too weird to share with a man he’s not even sure he really likes. “Cap was someone I became to do what Steve Rogers always wanted to do. What I still want to do.”
Steve had panicked when he’d seen Tony fall to floor. He’d been ready to scoop him up and carry him to the hospital in his pajamas. Luckily the team had been there to calm him down and get him to go change while they called an ambulance.
When he gets up to the roof he just has to stop and admire the sight of Steve walking back and forth across the roof in his PJ’s and bedhead lighting candle after candle. He looks beautiful illuminated by the soft glow. The sounds of the city are muted and the sky is so dark that it’s easy to believe that they’re in their own little private bubble.
“What are you, Dr. Seven PhDs? An idiot?” They’re laughing as Tony leans over and makes the move for Steve, displaying as always his knack for listening.
Steve packs up his stuff and decides to move back into the room he was in before everything. The room he hasn’t even opened the door to in a year and a half. The room Tony built for him before he even knew who Steve Rogers was.
Well. One thing was new.
, to Bruce who’s face is turning a little red as he hangs over uncomfortably and then back to Steve. Tony’s brain nearly short-circuits for a record breaking second time in as many minutes when Steve shifts his legs further forward and apart. His upside down face is smirking at Tony from between his legs in a way that tells him that he knows
The rest of the team came back eventually, some making their displeasure at his presence more obvious than others but what else was new?
Tony turns his head back at that, raising a questioning eyebrow as the elevator dings and opens in front of him. Natasha doesn’t seem fazed. She just continues as usual.
And Fury doesn’t exactly know what he had been expecting. He’s Captain America, for God’s sake. Embodiment of all things good, wholesome, and decent. But he can’t quite stop his mouth from spitting out, “You love him, right?”
Fury didn’t realize the extent of how wrong he was until he decided to drop in for a visit. Nothing S.H.I.E.L.D related, just coming around to say hi. And to make sure that Steve hadn’t murdered Tony.
He lets himself think back to the pitiful drunkard in his passenger seat, and cracks a small grin for approximately two milliseconds before he turns on his heel and follows them down the hall.
Tony’s flying high on a combination of Steve’s laughter, fireworks, and barbecue when he walks into the kitchen. Which is why he doesn’t immediately recognize the panic unfolding in front of him.
,” Tony says, his tone as close to a verbal eye roll as possible. “I understand the movie’s cultural importance and all that. But the ending is just stupid. There was more than enough room for Jack to get on with her and not sink it. I’ve done the science, guys. It’s simple physics.”
Steve finally pushes his fingers through the hologram, causing it to twist and flip midair, almost as if it were an actual seal swimming through the water. Steve absolutely beams and any pretense Tony had is gone. The flood gates have opened and the lump in his throat is back with a vengeance, bringing along a warmth that spreads through his chest and makes his heart beat a little bit faster and palms sweat and suddenly reality crashes down on him all at once.
He hasn’t worried like this in a long time. It’s a clawing kind of feeling that makes him shake all over. And Steve knows that he’s had
“What’s this?” Tony asks as he strolls into their bedroom to find Steve putting on an unfamiliar suit.
Life goes on. Thor is back on Asguard for the moment and everyone else respects Steve’s wishes and acts as normally as possible and things do slowly go back to normal. Things between Steve and Tony are easy on the battlefield but still strained at home. They’re slowly getting better though. They’ve stopped avoiding each other completely and share meals with the team amiably. They even trade small talk every once in a while. Steve will talk about the weather or what movie is on AMC that night. Tony will mention whatever plans he’s working on in the lab. Tony never joins him to watch the movie and Steve goes to down to the lab but it’s better than nothing.
“You know, this wouldn’t have happened if you had just accepted Tony’s invitation to live with the rest of the team.”
Steve is suppressing any audible laughter like a champ, but he’s shaking so hard from it that Tony can feel it while only holding his hand. He’s honestly afraid that if Steve bites his lip any harder he’ll draw blood.
“Okay, so, 1945,” Tony muses aloud, scratching his beard absentmindedly in thought. “What would I know from 1945?” He pauses. “Movies! What was the last movie you saw in the theater?”
“You guys have really done it this time,” Clint remarks on day four of the lockout. And Steve’s stomach drops at the thought that he really has.
“If not her then-” and then it hits him like a ton of bricks. For the first time in many, many years Fury just wants to get up and run as far away as possible.
“Yep,” Steve replies, popping the p with a sassy grin and Tony just has to kiss him until it fades away. They don’t break apart until they hear a chorus of wolf whistles and gagging noises and even then they don’t go far. Tony rests his forehead on Steve with a happy little sigh and Steve just smiles.
“Because-”
Tony waits for the words of condemnation and they never come. So, Tony provides them himself. “I inherited a billion-dollar company and turned around and sold my mother’s piano.”
“Yeah, it was amazing, in fact write it down before you go,” Tony says, his possessive streak flaring to life like never before. “It’s just that things got a little too real for a moment there, bud.”
Tony peers over her shoulder and nearly loses it.
Tony hesitates. Because even this warm, happy, toe-flexing Steve is still unnervingly perfect and Tony doesn’t want to point out how decidedly bad he is at this by ruining his pumpkin.
Steve just shakes his head and moves towards the stairs, leaving Tony to his thoughts, whatever they may be.
She lets out a bubbly, happy laugh at his words and Tony just rolls his eyes and quips, “Traitors, all of you,” before taking the seat next to Clint.
“My point is that this team can’t survive with one of you gone and they definitely can’t survive without two of you. So when I tell you to
“A week or so after Steve moved in,” she said, with a rare grin. “Once they stopped sniping at each other every five seconds, they found out that they have the same taste in movies. They’ve been pretty tolerant of each other since then. Even friendly.”
There are so many wittier, more handsome piss ants who’ve tried to take me down roaming around out there.”
“But-”
Tony lets the silence hang in the air for a while before giving in. It’s
He looks up to see Natasha and Clint leaning on either side of his door frame. Clint looks sympathetic and Natasha looks absolutely murderous. He feels a little swell of affection for them but still frowns.
, he tells himself.
Tony feels a little bad but he doesn’t bother lying about it. He definitely would’ve snuck down the second everyone was asleep. “C’mon, Steve,” Tony says, practically vibrating with the need to know what lies behind the door.
“How long have you been up?” Tony asks because of course he knows.
“All the way through?” Steve asks.
“You gotta be a model or something. I mean, look at that jaw. You could bust open
“He’s just coming out of anesthesia,” he says right before he leaves. “He’s a little groggy but you’re welcome to go see him.”
The new suit is definitely a little bulkier with padding. The color palette is muted, more gray and silver than red, white, and blue, but it still has the giant star and stripes on his chest. They’d added chevrons and some other military symbols on his arms to make up for the lack of flair.
Steve just laughs and dives in for another happy kiss that is disrupted by Betty yelling, “Okay guys, everybody gather around! It’s cake time!”
“And what is that?”
Tony’s half in Steve’s lap, half on the chair. Steve is warm beneath him and presses an even warmer kiss to the bottom of his jaw and asks “Ready for 2020?”
“Did you just call me buddy?” Tony protests feebly, words tinged with laughter.
“It almost sounds like you were twenty years old and suddenly lost both of your parents,” Steve says plainly, like it’s fact.
Tony swings open the door and moves to walk out into the hall, opening his mouth to tell JARVIS to start the coffee maker, but is stopped dead in his tracks by the sounds and smells of people making breakfast.
It’s already done. Steve knows that it’s done, Tony knows, the tears that are slowly welling in the corner of his eyes know. But he can’t stop fighting, he won’t stop. Not until Tony is good and truly gone.
“Yep,” she says, popping her p with the sugary sweet satisfaction of someone who knows someone else is walking into a hilariously awkward situation. She swings her bag over her shoulder and walks right past him. She waves and wishes him good luck as she leaves.
“He was wrong you know,” she says, looking back at Steve with an uncharacteristic look of tenderness. “To have left you.”
“Okay, so about that, killing me would only make Cap more pissed than he already is and he’s already at rip your face off levels of anger so that would be a pretty bad move on your part.” And if it is one thing that he regrets about this whole thing it’s the panicked look that had flashed across Steve’s face when M.O.D.O.K had hacked into the tower’s systems and had a little video chat with the team earlier.
“Remember I told you that SHIELD had me approve some new designs for the suit a while back? When they wanted to add more padding to cushion the blow when I fall?” Steve says, sliding his arms into the sleeves and zipping the suit up along the front. “This is it. What do you think?”
Tony doesn’t mind.
Tony interrupts him before he can go any further, turning his eyes up to meet Steve’s and taking his breath away. He reaches a hand up to curve around Steve’s jaw and says, “All of my life, whether they meant to or not, everyone close to me has always made me feel like I wasn’t…” He pauses, trying to think of the right word, before settling on “
“Your favorite color.”
Steve glances down the register to where Tony is leaning on their cart and flipping through the gossip rags furiously and not helping him load their giant cart of groceries onto the belt at all. Their cashier, a girl who can’t be over the age of seventeen, looks on bug eyed.
Steve frowns and his eyes get this sad, faraway look and Tony hates this. “I’m fine,” Steve says. “Just a couple of bumps and bruises. I should be fine by tomorrow.”
“Happy Turkey Day, birdbrain!” Tony says happily and everyone echoes the sentiment in their own way. It’s the first time Tony’s seen him today, which he had thought was a little odd as he had been in and out of the common area all day. But Clint looks no worse for the wear.
Tony waltzes into their bedroom one night and proudly announces, “I’ve made it my new mission in life to get Bruce laid.”
The air is too thick around them. Steve can hardly breathe. Tony is looking at him so lovingly and so tenderly that he can’t take it. “Tony,” he stutters. “Please don’t say all of this. Nothing’s going to change.”
Tony is Suspicious.
“It’s nice. I’m going to miss the obnoxious colors when I’m trying to find you from up in the air,” Tony says, padding over to run his hands over Steve’s ridiculously padded torso. “But, if it keeps you safe I would be fine with you wearing a paper bag. It’s still nomex and kevlar?”
And Tony really is.
“It isn’t poisonous,” he finally replied, voice sharp. His eyes wandered over to the place on the counter where the toaster once sat. He hadn’t lied about ripping it from the wall. There was a large hole where the electrical socket used to be. Fury’s hands curled into fists.
“Yeah,” he answers simply. “As quiet as they’ve been lately, other people do actually live here.”
“That had the potential to be quality entertainment for the rest of the night,” Clint grouses as Betty presses a single button and places the quiches down like they hadn’t been working on the fireplace for the past hour.
Steve’s heart melts a little at Tony calling their little team a family and he catches himself staring down at him intensely, trying to determine whether Tony just said it to humor him or not. When Tony looks up at him with genuine suspicion in his eyes and says, “What? What’s with the sappy eyes? I feel like this has to be a trap being that you were just giving me disappointed Cap eyebrows a minute ago.”
Steve has been telling Tony for a long time now that he can’t wait for the day that Tony stops being surprised that people want him. In a world where he still has nightmares that feature his father’s words of disapproval and Obie scooping his heart out of his chest, it’s a hard concept to fathom.
This morning, though, they’re lucky. Light is filtering in between the curtains and Steve is warm against his back in their cocoon of blankets. Steve’s morning scruff scratches at Tony’s shoulder where he’s buried his face into the crook of Tony’s neck. Tony’s only half awake, but the sensation of Steve’s breath on his neck and his fingers running up his side from his hip to his chest and back again is pure bliss.
Overall, it’s the best anniversary they’ve had yet.
They come back to their roof like they always do once the sun’s set. Winter’s settled in early this year and it’s starting to snow a little so they can’t stay out too long. But they still look down at the lights of the city together like they always do. Tony squawks in protest when he sees the neon maracas and burrito are gone and replaced by a simple CURRY & VINDALOO sign. Steve tells him that he loves him. Tony says that he loves him too.
Steve’s frown deepens and he pulls Tony closer. “And what’s your point, director?”
“This is actually unacceptable,” Clint says, eyeing all the wide open space. “Well, since you’re embracing the single life then I have no other choice but to get you the largest, raunchiest piece of wall art that I can find.”
Tony doesn’t really have a lot of leverage here as he’s chained to a chair and surrounded by four scarily large men with even scarier large guns but Tony’s never really learned when it’s a good time to shut up.
“Tony,” Steve warns.
“Whenever someone mentions something I don’t recognize, I write it down in there to look up later.”
But the words don’t come. Because if they’re anything, they’re stubborn, and Tony’s made up his mind.
It’s all very romantic until the blanket catches fire. But the moment suits them just fine.
“I do,” Steve murmurs, still engrossed in his work. “It’s beautiful.”
“She already knows you so well, Stark,” Clint says. “She’ll fit right in.”
in it and he honestly wonders when the hell that happened.
Steve can’t sit in the bed anymore. He gets up and looks at Tony but doesn’t approach him, doesn’t know what to do at all. He just stares, pleading with Tony with every fiber of his being.
“Uh huh,” Steve says nodding along even though Tony doesn’t sound particularly repentant. “Well you should probably go see him before he decides to show up at the house again.”
The opening notes of “La Vie en Rose” start to play, and much against his will, Tony can feel himself getting choked up. It doesn’t feel like it’s been a year and a half since they danced to this song as their first dance. He feels as though he was it happened just yesterday; and also that he’s always been married to Steve. All he knows is that Steve pulling him flush against his side does not help the situation in his throat.
The weird thing is the first thing Tony notices is that the room’s been painted. It was a clean shade of gray with metallic accents before. Now it’s a calm cream color with hanging plants and fuzzy rugs. All of the old office furniture had been hauled away.
Steve goes into the cobra just a little too fast at that, practically grinding his hips into the mat beneath him and Tony’s jaw hits the floor as the bastard winks at him.
And if it didn’t, well. At least it hurried his ass up.
“Tony, really?” Steve huffs, exasperated. “You heard me describing that circuit breaker on the helicarrier. You think I’m a scientist?”
“It’s okay, sweetheart,” Tony says, taking Steve’s hand in his and holding it in his lap. “I like your speeches.”
Clint takes a long sip of wine from his glass, seemingly oblivious as everyone else at the table stares at him for a moment. Betty, eyes glassy, is the first to say something with an enthusiastic “Well said!” that breaks the spell that had fallen over them. Tony blinks and takes a moment to clear his throat, which had become mysteriously clogged, before joining everyone in taking a drink.
“How about science?” Tony says. “I love science. You know anything about…anything?”
Tony nods, seemingly satisfied, and trots away as Steve’s laughs reverberate off the walls and breathe life into the gray monochrome hallways of SHIELD.
been a good year. Tony can count the amount of times they had been called out on a major, world-threatening missions on one hand. Bruce and Tony had begun joint research into the future of robotics and artificial intelligence that was starting to gain traction. While Thor had lost Jane, he is still well and whole and happy – regularly helping Steve, Nat, and Clint on their missions when he can.
And this is it.
“But the way you look at me, Steve, the way you talk to me – Christ -”
“What the hell are you doing?” Fury asks. “If you wanted to go on a drinking binge, couldn’t you have done it at home? Or at least somewhere where Potts could find you on her own?”
He sets the boxes down and takes a deep breath. His hand trembles and his heart aches as he goes to open the door. He takes a moment to lay his head against the cold, unfamiliar wood. He wills himself not to cry.
Steve moves his hand from the radio to Tony’s lap, where he scoops up Tony’s hand in his and lays it on the console between them. A few more moments and Steve is singing along to “Something Stupid” almost unconsciously.
Steve rolls his eyes. “I’m not
but his mind can’t help but wander now that the thought is in his head. He scans the room twice and frowns when he doesn’t see Steve’s work bench or his easel. He had been hoping to get a glimpse at whatever Steve was working on. And maybe see if he was using the brushes Tony gave him for his birthday.
Tony just blinks for a moment because he’s not entirely certain that he’s not in the twilight zone. It’s very rare that Steve gets worked up about anything that’s not real or tangible in some way. Tony’s only seen it once and Clint really had been cheating at Monopoly so Steve’s yelling had been founded.
“Uh, I’m pretty sure it’s something,” Tony says sarcastically. “Unless you frequently cry in our bathroom. Which, if you do, raises a lot of questions.”
Tony because, man, I’d be lucky to have a guy like you.”
And Steve always forgives him in the end anyway.
He shot the other agent a grin over his shoulder that Clint returned quickly, as if they were laughing at an inside joke.
M.O.D.O.K still cackles though and says, “Oh just you wait Stark!”
“Because you left me!” Steve yells and Tony stumbles back a step, as if that’s the last answer that he expected. He looks at Steve with big, shocked eyes and Steve can’t bring himself to stop. It all comes pouring out of him at once. “Because it’s been three fucking months and I am still trying to pick up pieces of myself and it makes me feel stupid and pitiful and weak! Because I can’t look at that bench or even pick up a pencil or a brush without thinking about how much I still love you and how much it still hurts!”
“What?” Steve asks, turning away from the stove with a look of bewilderment. When he spots the book in Tony’s hands he immediately pats down his back pocket, glaring at Tony when he finds it empty.
“None is the correct answer to that question. Thor likes chewing on mint leaves. But I think Bruce got him to come around to Crest.”
The only reason Steve isn’t already beside Tony is that Bruce has brought a chess set with them and Steve was the only one that had risen to the challenge. When Tony finally curls up next to Steve he leans in for a brief kiss, warmth seeping even deeper into his bones, before glancing at the chess board. He squeezes Steve’s knee in an affectionate gesture as he sees that Steve is holding his own against Bruce pretty well. He’s proud but he can’t help himself when he foresees a move Steve can make for a major advantage.
“What?” Steve’s voice is small and confused and almost a shock to Tony as he hasn’t said a word since Tony put on the movie three hours ago. He knows that Steve’s become a master at selectively tuning out everyone’s banter, especially when he wants to focus on one thing in particular.
“Oh my god,” Clint says, voice ragged and breathy as he fights to get air into his lungs between laughs. “Oh my god, I think that I’m going to die.”
“Nah,” Steve says, voice still rough with sleep, as he gathers up his art supplies. “I’m going up to bed. But I’m coming back down here in the morning and if you’re still down here I’m going resort to drastic measures.”
But they end up together on their roof just like they had the year before, legs tangled together beneath a blanket. Tony freaks out when they see the neon maracas are now accompanied by a neon burrito. When Steve tells Tony that he loves him Tony says it back, loud and proud, yelling it down to the street like a crazy man.
“Just tell me why you’re not drawing anymore and I’ll go-”
“Maybe with fireplaces. But if that’s all, I think the world will somehow learn to survive with my vast knowledge physics and engineering alone,” Tony replies, following Steve’s lead to the nearest armchair.
He overrode JARVIS’ security measures within a few minutes and walked down the hall towards the kitchen and into a large cloud of thick, black smoke.
Steve thinks he has an awful voice but his singing is one of Tony’s favorite things in the entire world. Some of his best mornings have been the mornings he’s woken up to Steve singing to himself in the bathroom.
It’s so empty it’s practically cavernous and more impersonal than a hotel room. He misses the black accent wall in their living room. He misses the dart board with the stick figure drawing of Fury above their couch. He misses the lime green comforter they used when their regular blue one was in the wash.
“Tony, there is a chandelier in this elevator. I think it’s fair to say that this is a little more complicated than dinner at our place would’ve been.” Steve turns to look at Tony himself rather than his reflection. “Things are going well between them. I don’t want to scare her off.”
“I know you all expect me to make a joke out of this but each of us only gets a whack at this once every seven years so I thought I’d try my hand at being serious.” Steve squeezes Tony’s hand and everyone settles in. A hush blankets the room and all eyes are on Clint.
“You’re only doing that because you know that you’re an even bigger sap than I am!” Betty says as she flounces past him, guiding Rhodey away with a gentle hand on his shoulder. “Come on, Jim. I want to hear all about how that peace summit in Bogota you were telling me about at the wedding went!”
Steve huffs a laugh and looks at Tony scrunching his nose up in the way he always does when he’s putting on a show over how annoyed he is.
Steve looks up at that and shoots him a little grin. “As much as I hate it when you decide to do things like try and disarm a bomb within ten seconds to blow in an evacuated area-”
“It is what it is,” he says, weary of talking about it all.
Tony lets the silent looks continue for another minute before Tony asks “Did you guys blow up the office?”
And ultimately that’s what sends him running away, out of the tower without a word, back to the alcohol that he hasn’t touched for months because of the way Steve’s stupid eyebrows used to furrow whenever he saw him drunk.
There are two small patches on Steve’s left bicep, so tiny that you wouldn’t notice them unless you were standing right next to Steve. One is a small letter A that matches the logo on top of the Avengers tower. The other, right below the A, is a small circle that’s half Steve’s shield and half Tony’s arc reactor.
And Steve can’t. He can’t sit here and look at Tony all excitement and smiles and bright eyes on their anniversary and keep it together anymore.
Tony let out a sigh when he was done. If Pepper and he were still together she’d probably be making some sort of commentary about being proud of his emotional growth as a human being. He takes another sip of his drink and pushes that emotional wound to the back of his mind. Steve eyes him for a moment before nodding and taking a hesitant sip of his own drink.
Tony,” Steve gasps.
“Fury’s office is in the other direction.”
“Uhhh….” Tony trails off into awkward silence. It’s quiet except for the clinking of the ice in their glasses.
,” Steve spits venomously. “But not anymore. So please just take the stuff and put it somewhere, anywhere as long as it’s out of my space, and go. I appreciate the effort but it’s really not needed.”
“Tony, just drop it,” Steve snaps, finally looking away from the television to pin Tony with a look that leaves no room for argument. It’d been a long time since Steve had talked to Tony like that and it stung, possibly even more than Steve hiding the real reason why he’d hidden his art supplies away did.
“Okay, but just avoiding the fact that you’re the only thing that makes him even semi-tolerable and he should’ve held on to you forever,” Clint says, stepping into the room and throwing himself on Steve’s desk chair. Natasha follows behind him, quietly shutting the door and curling up next to Steve on the bed. “He’s said a lot of crap to you too. You both have tempers. It doesn’t change that you’re good for one another.”
“Betty Schaer,” she says in return. Her smile is still in place but she seems far away for a moment as if she’s looking at Steve but seeing through him at the same time. He doesn’t question it though he does start to fidget a bit when her gaze wanders down to the medals on his chest.
” Tony makes a grab for the book and
“You think 2021 will be as good as 2020?” Steve asks.
“The rules are that we take turns giving the toast every year,” Natasha says evenly. “There are no rules that the speech can’t be ‘Happy Thanksgiving. I’m thankful we all made it. Let’s eat.’ Besides, I thought the whole point of us taking turns was to avoid Steve’s long-winded sap fest.”
“Somehow I can’t help but think that you were the one getting handsy in an elevator,” she says and Steve likes her already.
Steve protests as Clint leaps out of the room like a man on a mission. He calls after him for a moment though he knows it’s a lost cause.
“Ah,” Tony says, shooting him a self-deprecating smirk over the rim of the bottle. “Not so allergic to intelligence as I thought you were, are ya? Yep. Record this for the ages. I, Tony Stark, am in love with
Tony takes a moment to think about where the team has keeping him from for the past week a little harder. The dining room is immediately to the left of the elevator on the communal floor, which is why Natasha might have wanted to chaperone him. But no one had any problem with him passing the door to the dining room as he turned right into the main living area. But then there’s the office…
“Yeah, a bit.” It’s true. Tony always thought that if things ended with Steve that he’d fall into a horrible, alcohol-nightmare cocktail, downward spiral and he did for a little while. But it’s gotten better. The pain is still there. The
He found himself peering into a media room of some sorts; Tony and Steve curled up on the couch together watching His Girl Friday like they were old friends. Nick Fury had stopped being surprised a long time ago, but even he couldn’t deny the way his jaw dropped at the sight of them.
“Yeah, I mean,” Clint scrunches up his face in thought and then says, “You can mention that he’s pretty good with that shield and that his ass is pretty bangin’ too, I guess.”
The pose is baffling enough to grab Steve’s full attention, something he immediately regrets when Tony drawls, “Draw me like one of your French girls.”
Fury could feel the vein in the top of his head throbbing erratically. He did not get paid enough for this. “This way, if I need you, you can actually be there! Now hurry up, solider!” he screamed through the line before slamming the phone down.
Tony chooses that moment to groan, “Oh my God, I bet you have a fantastic ass. Please do a twirl for me.
Having all the Avengers in one place seemed like such a good idea. In theory.
Steve feels weary as he leaves Bruce’s room, equally unsuccessful at convincing him to eat something as he is at convincing him that this wasn’t his fault, that Betty was fine, that she forgives him. Bruce hadn’t moved from his chair, the same place he was when Steve left him last night, and he had just shook his head, murmuring that he was fool over and over.
M.O.D.O.K cackles again and now Tony is the one who’s tempted to rip his face off. “I’ll give you five minutes to make your decision.” All the screens go dark.
“Steve,
Tony feels faint. And he’s sure it’s only partially due to blood loss.
When it was Tony’s turn to walk down the aisle after Steve he teared up a little. He’s not going to lie about it. Steve was a little weepy too. It’s totally fine, it’s what people do at weddings and in his defense Steve already looks ridiculously attractive in his dress greens. He’s practically defenseless against the tears.
Everyone hums their agreement sleepily. It
Steve huffs angrily, raking his fingers through his hair and saying, “It’s not fair, you know? It’s not his fault. Betty forgives him, she still wants to be with him, wants to see him more than anything, but the more I tell him that the more he refuses to believe me.”
Steve doesn’t even remember what they said to each other this time around or how it started, though he knows that he ended it. He doesn’t remember the vitriol he spewed but he remembers the hurt on Tony’s face and it kills him a little, now that the flames have died down again, to think that he did that. Tony is both incredibly strong and incredibly fragile and Steve hates that he knows that, hates that when he feels nothing but anger he knows exactly where to push to make him break.
“That is what Christmas is for, no?” Thor asks. As if it was no big deal that they all worked so hard on this.
“And what do I say when I get there? ‘Oh, sorry I disappeared for three days. I was just pining away for you. No big deal!’ I can’t. I can’t go back.”
He looks forward to every moment with Tony, whether they’re sitting together in silence or yelling at each other at the top of their lungs. Last week Tony rented out a movie theater so they could watch a double feature all by themselves and the week before that they didn’t move from their bed for twenty-six hours straight. Steve told Tony that he had enjoyed both things equally and Tony had responded by buying him an easel and a set of oil paints because that’s one of the many ways Tony shows affection. Steve’s been doing this thing with Tony for nearly a year now and he learned a long time ago that complaining about it does more damage than accepting the gifts with as much gratitude and affection that he can muster.
“They were gone before I awoke. Though the voice in the ceiling has told me that Rogers decided Stark needed time away from the laboratory and has taken him to the park. That is why I attempted to make the poptarts on my own. Usually Banner or Natasha will make them for me.”
later to really cement the disco thing.”
Tony’s brain works a million miles a minute and Steve is always fascinated to watch him, though he still flushes when Tony turns his thoughtful stare on him. He is the most hot-blooded and most sentimental man in turns, equally likely to call Steve out on things as he is to rake his fingers through Steve’s hair and murmur affectionate praise into his ear. They push and they pull on one another and it makes Steve feel like he’s in free-fall in the best of ways.
Everyone pauses for a moment and looks at each other like deer in a headlight and it only makes Tony’s anxiety worsen, especially when the response they come up with is “What’re you talking about?” As if, it’s normal to be ladling out gumbo at the foot of Steve and Tony’s bed.
They aren’t naked or anything, but Tony’s got Steve pinned against the wall and they’re going at each other like a couple of horny teenagers with tongues down each other’s throats and writhing in a way that Fury never really wanted to know either were capable of.
century cinema on our frightening obsession with vampires and Tim Burton. That movie was a one off. Trust me. In fact, let me be your 21
The demigod stopped mid swing and looked up at the director, startled.
Steve nods and Tony squints up at him carefully. “Well, I’m losing my touch then. You’re a knockout.”
And lo and behold, Nick Fury is standing in the doorframe, holding a plate full of toaster strudel, and wearing a pink, frilly apron.
Tony’s head snaps up, shaken out of whatever project he’d been immersed in to see Steve standing a few feet in front of him, holding a tray of food with his brows all scrunched up in concern like the giant mother hen he can be sometimes. He doesn’t bother to correct him. It’s been way longer than sixteen hours.
He frowns, but answers the question anyway. “I’d be devastated,” he says plainly. “But I couldn’t blame him for doing the right thing.”
“Never,” he nodded with a grin, looking back to Fury.
Steve perks up at that. “Oh yeah, I think I saw
Tony smiles, “That woman bakes like a crazy person. I may have had two before I came up here. Or four hundred.”
“We promised that we’d wait until after the toast,” Bruce reasons, starting to push the turkey away.
“I am
“Yep. You are.” Steve says it dryly enough but it’s quickly followed by laughter. Tony elbows him for good measure but he can’t help but laugh too. Steve presses a kiss to his shoulder in return and Tony finds his resolve crumbling.
“It was actually supposed to be an anniversary gift,” Steve says. “I started looking for it back in January after you told me about it on the way back home from Buffalo. But it ended up being a little more difficult than anticipated, so I called in some back up.”
Fury cast a brief glace heavenward, muttering something along the lines of
“Tony.”
They didn’t really have a honeymoon phase like most couples do, mainly because neither their work nor their personalities were really conducive to spending hours upon hours looking soulfully into each other’s eyes. When they aren’t fighting Tony is still volatile, still sarcastic, still too biting and Steve is still stubborn, still just as sarcastic, and still too rigid at times.
Steve may or may not flip him off before he finally storms out the door.
Steve blocks his attempts with ease. “You said lay it on me, liaison,” Tony whines as they scuffle, Steve clearly holding back as they push and pull at each other. Tony thinks he sees Steve grinning a couple of times and it only makes him more determined.
“Hey, we’re still a team and I need you to act as such,” he says firmly. “I can’t have hostility getting in the way when we’re in battle. So leave any anger you may have about this at the door every morning. Tony’s not going anywhere.”
“Happy Birthday
“A whole year, huh,” Tony says, looking up at the sky.
Pumpkin guts are sprawled out across the kitchen table, emptied onto sheets of newspaper, and the kitchen smells heavily of pulp. But other than that, there is no sign of what Steve’s doing. He isn’t joined by any of the others. It’s just Steve, doing something Steve something he’s always loved to do.
His heart still skips a beat when he sees Steve smile broadly, eyes dancing in the candle light, before blowing out the candles to the sound of everyone’s happy cheers.
“Okay, okay, I got the hint,” Tony says, setting the magazine aside to hand Steve the bananas as well as some other fruits and vegetables. “I hope you know that I’m highly offended on your behalf that they seem to think that you would lower your standards enough to sleep with
Honestly, I blame the Kiss the Cap apron. A man that attractive should never wear an apron unless he wants me to start to wonder what he’d look like with nothing under-”
“Why?” Steve asks. “Orange is a great color.”
“Is that what you told Fury when you cancelled your morning debrief?”
“It doesn’t matter,” Steve grits out. “It’s over. Just act normally and everything will fall back into place again.”
Steve only says “Tony.” But he packs it with so much incredulity that he doesn’t need to say anything else.
And he knows that he doesn’t mean it but that slightly uncomfortable feeling refuses to be capped and he finds himself awkwardly patting him on the shoulder and telling him “Rest up,” before he can stop himself.
“That was before I knew that I rather bite my tongue for the rest of our lives than not have you,” Tony says with a bitter laugh. “I’m tired, Steve. I’m tired of pretending. I’m tired of trying to be just friends with you and failing. I’m tired of us both being in pain for no reason.”
Steve insists that they try to redo the joint anniversary dinner again now that everyone’s relationship is healthy and thriving even though Tony tries to dissuade him with a fervor that makes Steve instantly suspicious. It ends up not mattering anyway since the plans end up falling through. There’s a city wide blackout and all the restaurants are closed because apparently cooking in the dark is a bad idea.
“What?” Tony asks, dazed. “What do you mean not anymore?”
“Really, Katniss? You’re defending something to me because of its poetic value? You were belching the alphabet
right. They have to learn to at least be amicable. There has to be
Tony kisses him anyway.
“Aww, come on,” Steve says, tone still heavily teasing as he ducks down to press kisses all along Tony’s jaw. “You don’t mean that.”
interesting thing about him. “Orange is still my favorite thing though.”
“Birdbrain,” Tony mutters as he scans the rest of the article, snorting as he glosses over the details. “You should hear what your reaction to it has been.”
To retreat away from whatever that feeling in his throat is and go back to the cold, hard facts. He nods and shoos Steve away to one of the benches in the corner.
“Oh, calm down,” Pepper says, rolling her eyes like he’s yet another one of the many drama queens she deals with on a daily basis. “I’m not leaving because I’m angst ridden over your…” She gestures at him wildly, looking him up and down.
Tony’s takes in a deep breath, closes his eyes, tilts his face up towards the sun and basks.
SHIELD had offered him a space to conduct his work back when he was still living in Brooklyn and he had accepted it, even though he was almost positive that it was a broom closet that they had scrambled to convert for him at the last minute. It was small, barely wide enough to fit the desk it held, and dimly lit with stark white walls, gray floors, and no windows.
“Yeah, yeah, I know,” he says, trying to sound indifferent. He doesn’t enjoy the thought of being alone in the Tower, but he’s not about to stop her. “Have a drink for me. And have fun.”
Pepper gives him a thoughtful look after he runs his fingers through his hair for the billionth time. She must think of something good because all she does is smile.
Steve’s eyes go wide and surprised for a moment. He drops his sandwich and pushes it to the side and for a moment Tony’s worried that Steve’s caught on before he’s even begun his speech. But then Steve opens his mouth and says, “Is this about the weird sex thing I asked you about the other day? Because I swear I didn’t know it was a sex thing when I asked you and it didn’t even sound remotely appealing.”
Steve lets out a shuddering breath and grips Tony’s wrists tightly, painfully. “You said that we were
“But-”
So, they fight. They fight a lot. They fight over battle plans and alcohol and carelessness. But they also fight about date plans and kisses and the last piece of toast too. They always make up though and (with the exception of those three weeks about two months ago after Tony had come home stinking of whiskey and Steve had outright refused to even look at him until he agreed to go to therapy) the longer their relationship goes on the shorter the turnaround time gets.
Steve leans down to kiss Tony, long and deep and full of love, before saying, “I really,
“When the hell did that happen?”
“Hm,” Steve hums, thinking about it for a minute while still working at on his cat. “Practice,” he settles on. “There wasn’t a lot I could do for fun as a kid. Also, how did you build an engine at age five?”
Natasha tells him to hush with a single gesture, her hand cutting through the air. “I think I can fix it,” she murmurs.
As he places his glass back down on the table and Bruce goes to cut the turkey, Tony catches Clint’s eye from across the table. He can’t help but smile. The others around them start passing around sides and chattering about the parade floats from earlier. Clint smiles back while Steve brings their joined hands to his mouth for a kiss. Steve only lets go to accept some mashed potatoes from Thor and even when he does Tony feels so grateful he thinks he could burst.
Thor laughs his usual echoing bellow of a laugh, Natasha’s face twists into a look of disgust that everyone knows is just for show at this point, and Bruce’s gal turns to face them all smiles.
But then Steve had made them a picnic, had looked up a
“Hmm?” Steve hums in response, finally turning away to look at him. “What was that?”
?” Tony asks, incredulous. Neither Clint nor Natasha jump, clearly having heard him come in. But nobody can tear their eyes away from the cake in front of them. “Really Clint?”
“They cut off your suit but it’s garbage now anyway,” Tony replies, not sure how to respond. “Coulson’s probably already ordered a new one though.”
“I haven’t used that thing since before the Avengers were a thing and I moved my office up here.” Tony says slowly, trying to piece together whatever clues he can from the complicated series of looks the others are giving each other. “I thought that the only thing in there was a dust bunny colony.”
“Can I officially add matchmaker to my overwhelmingly long list of accomplishments yet, Captain?”
“I know,” Steve says, his eyes still watery but affectionate. He lets his head fall on Tony’s shoulder. “I know I was being stupid.”
Steve still hesitates and Tony can’t take it. He buries his head beneath Steve’s chin and whispers into his collarbone. “I love you.”
“I think this is the joke.” Steve says, as wryly as he can while choking on the last traces of laughter.
“Really?” Tony yells, struggling against the restraints. The blade in his shoulder stings when he moves and the barrel of the gun digs further into his skull but he doesn’t even care. “You can’t even fight fair, you fucking ass?”
Steve’s lived in the tower for close to six months now and Tony’s seen him react to a lot of new technology but he’s never seen his face light up the way it does when he sees his drawings come to life. He reaches out with awe and says “How did you…?”
Tony’s heart leaps in his chest. Steve hasn’t voluntarily been in the same room alone with him since they broke up. “Yes,” he blurts, practically shoving his way into the room before Steve moves out of the way to let him in. Steve doesn’t comment.
On their fourth anniversary Tony surprises Steve when he takes him into the bowling alley to find the neon maracas and burrito hanging on the wall on either side of the Caravaggio. Part of Steve is distressed that such a beautiful, important piece of art is surrounded by two of the kitschiest things in the word. But he’s mostly touched that Tony searched for them for him.
“Are you seriously apologizing to me for your ring melting off your finger right now?” Tony snaps. “I couldn’t care less about the ring.”
“I’m devastated, I’m sure,” Steve replies flatly, never having been able to understand Tony’s fascination with all the fake press out there about them. “Tony, which brand of toothpaste is it that Thor likes again?” He looks down at the bottle of Crest suspiciously.
And Steve, poor Steve. He looks absolutely mortified. “I’m so sorry, sir,” he rushes out. “When Tony muted JARVIS we had no idea-”
He holds it up so that Steve can get a good look at it and the simple inscription of their initials on the inside of the band.
But otherwise this New Year’s Eve is the same as the last. Everyone is cozy in their PJs. Steve is warm at Tony’s side and Anderson Cooper is back at it again.
“Touche,” Tony admits. Steve doesn’t respond any further, just raises a hand up to try and push his bangs out of his face. He leaves a trail of pumpkin pulp on his forehead in his wake. Tony wipes it away and presses a kiss there instead. “You think there’s any chance I could learn?”
“Go open some windows,” he grit out. “We need to get some air in here.”
It takes Steve a moment to compose himself enough to even open his mouth, and honestly, Tony can’t even blame him. Thor’s skating ability is on par with a newborn baby deer fumbling its way through the forest for the first time. He wobbles with such vigor that he resembles jello more than any sort of demigod. And Tony thought the shameless photos of him and Steve on a Valentine’s date at a public ice rink would be bad. From what Tony can see while taking laps around the rink, there are at least twenty-seven people with their phones trained solely on the mess of limbs in front of them.
Tony falls into his lap still laughing and humming along to “Star Spangled Man” which had played in the background of the slideshow SHIELD had just played in honor of his hundredth birthday. Steve narrows his eyes in warning at Tony and when he just starts to sing along quietly into Steve’s ear, Steve bites his shoulder in retaliation.
“You had no right to move my stuff,” Steve growls, voice loud and turning into a scream as he swiftly gets his breathing under control. “And you definitely had no right to lock me out of my own storage locker!”
Tony’s going to kill Betty Schaer.
for Tony for a while now. Even if he hadn’t, the way his stomach swoops whenever Tony presses his lips to his might’ve clued him in by now. But Steve’s loved a bunch of people before and they’ve rarely inspired this kind of fear in him.
“Tony.”
Steve’s choking on his own spit when a nurse comes over and touches his elbow gently. She leans in and says, “I’m sorry to interrupt Captain Rogers but we need to look him over one last time before we send him to his room. You have to go but we’ll be taking him up to the private suite on the ninth floor soon.”
things. He shouldn’t be checking up on them outside of strict S.H.I.E.L.D business or care about one of them dying beyond having to replace them. Why
When Steve finally does open his mouth it’s with a barely restrained sort of wheezing noise and he only manages to get out “He…” before he needs to swallow back more laughter.
It’s a fact that is proven when he’s awoken at some God awful time in the morning on a Saturday by a slightly frantic Pepper Potts, whose first words are “I don’t know where Tony is.”
“Just
Tony himself is wearing two sweaters over his flannel PJs and Bruce is wearing the same, though his sweaters are obscured by the fact that the entire top half of his body is currently up the chimney.
Steve looks a bit concerned but mostly amused. Morning Tony has said much worse in the past.
Steve looks up to see Tony still in his doorway, looking at him with a look full of mischief and gentle teasing. “What Tony?”
“This year was wonderful,” Betty remarks as they enter the last two minutes of 2020, laying half-asleep across Bruce’s chest.
“I’m so sorry, Tony.”
He laughs and laughs until his vision swims and his belly hurts, Clint and even Natasha not too far behind. When they finally all collect themselves, wiping tears from their eyes, Natasha just shrugs and says “Fine cake, you win. We’ll just put enough candles on it that he’ll never notice.”
(With love, of course)
“Okay,” Steve agrees easily enough, kissing the fingers covering his mouth. Tony’s heart melts and he only keeps himself from tackling Steve right then and there by pushing Steve’s hair out of his face and running his hand down the side of his face.
“C’mon Steve,” Tony purrs and Steve knows that he’s getting desperate when Tony switches in his “seductive” voice that is less seductive than it is chain-smoker-y. Steve doesn’t have the heart to tell him that it doesn’t seem to have the same effect on Steve as it did the many that came before him. He glances over to Tony briefly to see that he’s put one hand behind his head and another on his hip.
“I’m sorry to hear that” Steve says, struggling to find words and keep a straight face and not stutter. It’s not from embarrassment this time but from the shock of Tony’s had on his thigh. Apparently whatever conversation Clint had to offer hadn’t been entertaining enough to keep him occupied for long. Steve slightly regrets the elevator tease now. But only slightly.
He’d just ignored him and yesterday he had gone up to his room to find his easel and his bench - the one that Tony had made for him with his own two hands, the one that Steve couldn’t even look at without his chest tightening – standing in the corner right  below the biggest window. Steve had marched right downstairs to put them back in storage only for JARVIS to refuse to unlock his locker, no matter how much Steve yelled and demanded to be let in.
Steve pulls Tony even closer to him, tucking his head beneath his chin and wrapping the blanket around them tighter. They didn’t do anything special, just went out to dinner and came home to their roof. They can’t see any stars up in the inky black polluted sky but the buildings shimmer beneath and it makes for a beautiful view.
“The 70’s,” Bruce tells him patiently as he folds a napkin and passes it Steve’s way. “Very different than Nirvana. Honestly Tony, I don’t know why you decided to group all these things together.”
“See, that’s what rip your face off anger looks like,” Tony says as he sees Steve ram his shield into some poor thug’s neck.
“Just not a song you would probably exactly appreciate as much as I, or say, Clint would.”
century liaison?”
Tony wants to be scared but Steve is smiling at him and everyone else seems nervous, but happy? Everyone keeps shooting him knowing, half hidden grins as they all pile into the elevator and head downstairs.
“Aww, it’s so sweet,” Betty chirps from the chair she’s sharing with Bruce on the other side of Tony’s hospital bed. “But should we really be recording it? It feels like we’re taking advantage of a sick man.”
“You’ve been in here for sixteen hours.”
what he’s doing and Tony is left babbling like an idiot.
He charges upstairs the second he’s pulled enough badges to force Stark’s room number from the poor info desk girl. She gives him a key but he kicks down the door anyway simply because it’s 4 AM on the first Saturday morning he’s had off in months and he’s here.
“You okay up there?” he asks when Steve starts to look a little too far away and feel a little too tense.
Tony sighs and lets go of his hand. “Me too, gorgeous,” he whispers. And then he turns around and he’s gone and Steve’s entire body aches.
“I’m thinking of headstones over here, want to give it a try?” Steve asks, his chin snug against Tony’s shoulder.
“Honey, the damper isn’t closed.”
Tony looks like he’s winding up to come back at Steve with all he’s got for a few seconds, all coiled up tension and bared teeth like a dog with its fur raised, and then it’s all gone at once. Tony simply takes a long sip of his drink and lets out a long sigh.
Tony rolls his eyes but pulls Steve closer and into his arms for a dance anyway. “Lying to me about what I’m wearing, already? You’re settling into being a husband nicely.”
“I’m fifty,” he murmurs, letting the words settle over him. In some ways he feels unbearably old. But in others he doesn’t know where all that time went to.
you can be, Captain America,” Tony breathes. Steve turns his head in response, just far enough to brush his lips over Tony’s.
“You’re something else,” Tony says, finally breaking the silence. He brings a hand to Steve’s neck and gently massages, finding a knot forming there after what must have been at least an hour spent bent over his pumpkin.
Tony laughs and it’s the first time Steve’s felt at ease since he walked through the doors to this tower, carrying all of his worldly possessions in one tiny, little box.
“Yeah, yeah, I will,” Tony brushes him off. He does pluck a carrot stick off the plate and pop it into his mouth though, just to make Steve ease up a little.
But nothing prepared him for Steve’s vows. He had not be ready for how Steve would take Tony’s hands in his and look at him so intently, with so much love and awe embedded into every word he spoke. He had said, “Tony, there are no words for how much you mean to me. You offered me a home when I was lost, you befriended me even when I pushed you away, and you pulled together the family I never thought that I could have again after I got out of the ice. You are the most obstinate, insane, loving, selfless man that I have ever met and I love every inch of you. I vow to lend you my strength whenever you need it and always be there to catch you when you fall. I vow to always be someone who can live up to the strength of your loyalty and affection. And last but not least, I vow to love you and give you my best for the rest of my days.”
“10-4, Red,” Tony manages to say around the lump in his throat that he’s fully pretending isn’t there. “You got it.”
When he returns three weeks later, he’s buried under so much paperwork that checking up on the team gets pushed to the back burner. He figures as long as there isn’t a national emergency or alien invasion and the team hasn’t killed each other, that they can handle themselves for a little while. But then of course, on the lucky fifth week of peace and quiet, some wiseass supervillian decides that it’s a great day to try and level Manhattan.
“Your whatever with Tony,” she finishes. “I’m leaving because post-anesthesia Tony is even more ridiculous than regular old Tony. I’ll come back and see him when it’s worn off.”
Tony proves that he does indeed take his title very seriously that night when orders in practically every dish the Thai restaurant down the block offers while playing “Smells Like Teen Spirit” with a shining disco ball revolving overhead.
Steve leans forward, taking his weight off of his other hand still on the beach towel, and brushes a finger down Tony’s nose and over his cheekbones.
Steve lifts his head and shoots another smirk at Tony when the other two are looking at the ground and Tony’s mouths,
And that’s when he passes out.
Steve keeps babbling but Tony makes no move to come closer and it only makes Steve panic more. He feels stupid sitting in this bed, in their bed, when something is so obviously off.
They stop in front of the door to the old office and Steve lets go of Tony’s hand to go to the knob. He turns back and says, “We were going to surprise you with this on Christmas Eve. But, I knew, and I think we all knew, that now that you put two and two together on the office that you would’ve snuck down here anyway.”
Tony blows him a kiss and says, “Anything for you, Hotlips.”
Steve rolls his eyes while Tony smirks and says, “C’mon Steve, lighten up. The woman’s a tough cookie, okay? She’ll be fine. Anyway, everyone’s gotta meet the family at some point, even dysfunctional ones like ours.”
“Very strong personalities,” Steve settles on.
“Oh no,” he says, waving him off. “I just told him that we had unexpected company.”
Tony doesn’t say anything right away, which is admittedly out of character for him, but it’s Valentine’s Day and Dean Martin is playing over the speakers and he’d at least like to maintain some level of romance. He does however shoot Steve a lingering side glance.
“I’m joking, I’m joking,” Tony says, trying to smooth out the situation again. He even shelves his joke about penis pumps and everything. He lifts his hand up to wipe a piece of lettuce away from the corner of Steve’s face in the hopes of distracting him and says, “Suffice it to say, my question was not about the weird sex thing.”
“Oh yeah?” Steve asks, putting down the book he had been reading and pulling the covers on Tony’s side of the bed back in an invitation to join him.  Tony takes the invitation without further explanation.
With one last swift undercut Tony does get the book out of Steve’s pocket, though he knows that he wouldn’t have stood a chance if Steve didn’t want him to have it on some level. It doesn’t stop Tony from crowing in victory anyway.
Steve’s out of his chair so fast that it nearly falls over. He’s halfway down the hall leading to the recovery room when he notices that Pepper isn’t following him.
Steve nods a sleepy nod and says, “Sure.”
When he walks in he expects Tony to be yelling or fighting a nurse or doing the mambo with his ass hanging out the back of his hospital gown. He expects something that would explain why Pepper had hurried off after hours of worry. But, instead he just sees Tony laying on a gurney looking half asleep but no worse for the wear. Steve lets out a sigh of relief.
“Shouldn’t you be sleeping?” the director asked. “You’ve had a very long day.”
“Tony-”
“Are you okay?” Steve asks, trying to sound soothing and only sounding shaken. He gingerly removes the gag from Tony’s mouth and strokes Tony’s cheek. The rough leather of Steve’s gloves makes for a less then tender touch but Tony leans into it nonetheless.
he yells.
Tony thinks.
The worst part, he finally thinks, is that Steve returned the goddamn kiss. He had smiled back and had taken his hand and hadn’t even questioned it. He hadn’t even tried to put a definition to it all. He had done it like it was natural as breathing, that it was obvious, that Tony could just
“Yeah, absolutely. Why?” Tony replies.
“Did you take that out of my pocket?” Steve’s voice is razor sharp in a way that Tony hasn’t heard in months and it makes a little part of him twinge on the inside.
When all the men are down Steve rushes over to Tony, cradling his head in his hands and looking worriedly at the pool of blood beneath him. Thor quickly rights the chair so that Tony isn’t bleeding out onto the concrete as Clint gets to work on the chains around his wrists and Natasha works on his ankles.
” Steve cries, on the verge of yelling. The back of his throat feels tight and he can feel the hot pinprick of tears at the back of his eyes. “We’re good together, Tony. If our arguing is the only problem, we can change that.
“Do you hear that?” he asks, and a fond smile spreads across Steve’s face. He can’t help but find the fact that as smart as Tony is, he can’t manage anything even slightly complicated first thing in the morning endearing.
Steve snorts out a laugh, happy for the distraction. “Not really. It’s mostly clothing.”
“Do you ever think that we push too far? That we know too much, know each other too well?” Tony finally asks and Steve is so numb he can’t move, can’t even feel his lips when he responds.
“How do you-”
“C’mon, you. I need to hear about your day too.” She says it with such ease that Tony’s heart almost breaks. It’s been years and Tony’s still not entirely used to all this. But it warms him so thoroughly, he can’t bear to fight it or even choke out a sarcastic retort. He just takes her hand and follows his friends into the kitchen.
“Oh, yes you are,” she says, going back to fiddling with her planner. “It may not be official yet and neither one of you might’ve said it out loud but it’s there.”
Steve narrows his eyes at Tony for a moment before nodding and turning back to the TV, dismissing Tony with a simple, “Uh huh.”
This time ten years ago Tony had been in a Tom Ford suit, at a gala that cost more per plate than most make in a year, smooth talking a professional tennis player. But as he watches the soot roll down Bruce’s pant leg – navy blue fleece with tiny grey atoms – and gives up his pride in favor of chuckling at himself, he wonders if his past self would have even believed how much better this all is.
“Oh my god,” Tony says, his body flooding with relief as he rolls his eyes. “No, it’s not about the weird sex thing. However, if you ever want to revisit that conversation-”
“Oh my God, I did not purposefully tell the girl at the bakery to write Happy Birthday Stew,” Clint says, exasperated. “If I was going to risk everyone’s wrath for a prank, it would have to be a lot better than this.”
It’s still silent for a few moments after Coulson leaves until Clint blinks and says, “What in the actual fuck just happened?”
“I know,” he hears from somewhere off to his right. He would usually crack an eye open in response, but he’s luxuriating in this moment; relaxed in a way that he so rarely is. The voice to the right continues, “There’s nothing like the first warm, sunny day of spring in New York City.”
But then again he doesn’t smile like this at Bruce. There’s no gentle teasing when it’s Clint’s turn to come down and make sure he hasn’t science-d himself to death.
She hums, considering it. “Maybe. Or cookie dough. Divide and conquer?”
“Yeah, think of the pies Tony,” Bruce agrees, a joking edge in his voice even though he’s smiling warmly at Betty. “And the tarts and the turnovers and the apple crisps.”
Steve sighed, his eyes darting down to where Tony laid dozing on his shoulder. “Every time I close my eyes I hear-”
Betty decides to join in on the plank, getting into position and saying, “Just hold that position as long as possible and then go into the cobra!”
He cuts himself off before he can finish the sentence but Fury’s mind fills in the rest.
The spilt lip and bruises don’t make him happy either.
“Yeah,” Tony whispers back with a smile as the others countdown the last five seconds of 2020. “Always together.”
But before Fury could contemplate that further or even get to what he had come here for in the first place he was cut off by Tony’s loud squawk.
The gunman behind Tony steps forward and digs the muzzle of his gun into the back of Tony’s head at the same time the guy on the left digs a tiny triangular blade into his shoulder. Tony cries out in pain, apparently loud enough for the microphone to pick it up judging by the way Steve entire body seems to flinch.
“No one has said that you can’t go into the
Steve’s lips quirk up into a sly grin, the one that no one outside of their immediate circle of friends even believes exists, and he drawls, “Maybe I wear it because it makes one person in particular drool at the sight of me.”
without a good old-fashioned
Nick Fury never expected that six extraordinary people would manage to downgrade him from highly lauded international super spy to highly underpaid babysitter.
It isn’t until they leave and the pressure is off for a moment that the situation fully sinks in.
It’s blizzarding in the way it always does during February in New York and it makes the tower feel like the inside of a snow globe. Quiet, muffled wind whips against the windows and it’s so soothing Tony almost feels like melting into the couch for a long nap. Steve, Natasha, and Clint are away on a minor recon mission that Tony knows they could do in their sleep. Tony just dropped by Bruce and Betty’s quarters and found Bruce bundled in a blanket and quietly reading a book on Marie Curie.
He’s always thought that he was hot. Fuckable. That had never been an issue. Other than that, he remembers a short period of time where the thought of being in the same room as him had repulsed Tony and then suddenly it hadn’t and then suddenly he was kissing him in the park.
Tony just brings his other hand to Steve’s face as well. He holds him tightly, grounding him in the moment, as Tony’s face turns determined and resolute. “No. Everything’s going to change, Steve.” His voice is clear and sharp and leaves no room for arguments. “Steve, this is me apologizing for ending things between us. I’m sorry I didn’t fight for us. I’m sorry that I caused you pain. Believe me when I say that it nearly killed me to do it. And now this is me, saying that I need you,” Tony’s throat audibly clicks as he swallows. “And that I’ll probably screw up again but I’ll sure as hell never let you go and if there’s any way that you could ever take me back after how enormously I screwed up,
That’s the best
“In storage,” Steve says, trying to affect a tone of nonchalance and failing miserably.
Steve kisses him first, pinning him to the bed with his comforting weight, before wrapping Tony up in his arms and whispering, “Happy Birthday.”
Tony still isn’t buying it, looking steadily at Steve chest and not at the heavy bandages around his hands and neck. “You didn’t have to go in there Steve. That was a chemical fire. It was well over a thousand degrees. You’re lucky you’re still alive!”
He’s Tony’s whatever.
Tony doesn’t have the good fortune to wake up in his husband’s arms every day. Between missions, Tony’s long hours in the workshop, and Steve’s tendency towards early mornings it’s rare that they ever wake up together.
I’m so happy you’re here I-”
Tony knows that that’s probably his cue to leave but between his empty bed and the absolute pin drop silence of the tower lately, he’s in no rush to try and sleep. Instead, he takes in the darkness of the room and peeks down at his watch for the time.
“Something like that,” Rhodey scoffs as he throws his jacket over the back on a nearby chair. But then he walks over and pulls Tony into a hug and Tony basks in it.
” Steve hisses, teeth grit. “Just go away.”
“Spies,” he grumbles to himself, though it doesn’t take him long to get over his surprise. He knows Natasha could easily kill him with a flick of her finger, even on her worst days, but she looks far from menacing in a pair of ratty jeans and an oversized grey tank top that looks suspiciously like one of Clint’s.
“What do you call a back alley circumcision?”
“Blackmail is such an ugly word. I prefer to say that we’re preserving this moment for posterity.”
“See, now that’s interesting,” Tony says with a large grin, leaning in close to get a better look at Steve across the table from him. “In a surprising way. I would’ve guessed red, white, or blue.”
“Oh, Steve,” Tony sighs, moving his hands up to his face to wipe the tears away and haul him close for a hug. “Did you go alone?”
Steve just hums. He follows it with a simple, “You’re perfect.”
She just frowns and then turns to walk away without another word, leaving him alone in the empty, quiet room.
“If you came here for a reason, please feel welcome to stay until the others return,” he said, in the oddly genuine manner only Thor could pull off. “Come now, take a seat.”
“Oh my God, guys, no one cares and you’re missing the part where she dies and goes back to the Titanic in heaven.”
Tony plops himself down on the couch and frowns at how plain everything is. This room is so not Steve. It hurts that he ever thought this was an okay space for him. His eyes scan the room for a stitch of color, of personality, of
“Hmm?” Steve responds, rubbing the sleep out of his eyes in a way that can’t help but find adorable even against his better judgment.
Tony has no words. His chest feels tight and he knows it has nothing to do with the arc reactor. He has no way to thank them. He has no way to deal with how loved he feels right now.
“Nat,” Tony starts, unable to keep the laughter bubbling in his throat from starting to surface. “I really think he’s going to find it funny.”
He can see they’re uneasy and he slips into his Captain’s voice easily. It’s easier to be strictly professional anyway.
The cashier nearly chokes on her own spit.
Tony’s just about to open his mouth to delay the inevitable a little bit longer when it happens. The lights go dim and the band starts playing the opening notes to “My Heart Will Go On.”
He doesn’t though because things are weird enough with Tony and him bickering like parent and child. So Steve decides to laugh because laughter just seems like the best option right now.
They carve the rest together.
He tries not to think about it as Steve shakes his head, returning his grin with a fond one of his own, and says “Lots of inspiration down here. That’s all.”
“This is priceless,” Clint says around a hearty laugh. Steve just rests his head in his free hand and wonders how the hell this is his life.
“Know any good jokes?” Tony blurts out and Steve rolls his eyes at pushes his chair out from beneath the table.
Tony has always been his most willing model and most frequent subject. He has sketchbooks filled with Tony’s nimble, inventor’s hands alone. But Steve never gives into him when he’s like this. It’d be too easy.
“It’s wonderful!” Betty says with a huge, goofy grin as she unravels her scarf, revealing red, wind beaten cheeks. “I’ve never been happier.”
“I don’t accept charity. Especially not from Tony Stark.”
He can’t. He can’t let it happen.
he’s about to say.
She asks for their store card tremulously and nearly faints when Steve hands it to her with a smile.
“It was so stupid, Tony. I could feel Abraham Lincoln rolling in his grave. I don’t think I’m prepared for 21
“Do you want us to kill him?”
Steve just laughs. “They are excellent cookies.”
“Orange,” Steve replies, settling back into his seat slowly. He’s still unsure about this whole thing.
“Good to know the whole harem thing doesn’t faze you at all,” Steve says, moving onto the meat.
But he doesn’t. His side hurts like hell and Steve’s looking at him with those pretty, honest, blue eyes and Tony just doesn’t anymore.
? You do realize that I am still your commanding officer, don’t you? And I was doing you a favor. The last time Thor tried to use a toaster he put a hole the size of your big ass head in the wall.”
Because that’s Tony’s problem. Or at least one of the top three. He can never leave well enough alone. He always has to push, always have to pursue things, even when he has no right to pursue them. Especially when he has no right to pursue them.
Steve’s sitting on the edge of their tub with his head hung heavy between his shaking shoulders. “Hey,” Tony whispers as he crawls down onto his knees before Steve. He tries to cup Steve’s face between his hands but Steve is curled in on himself, not leaving an inch of room for Tony.
stand down,” he says the words firmly, but his voice is barely above a whisper. He realizes too late that he sounds more like a father figure than a figure of authority. “You stand the fuck down. You understand me?”
Tony knows it’s a bad idea when he knocks on the door, that he’s crossing one of the many boundaries that they’ve set up since things ended between them, but since when has that ever stopped him before? He’s worried and the only thing that will settle him is seeing Steve, live and whole and
Because Steve is irritatingly, overwhelmingly great in many ways. But he’s not otherworldly. He’s right here and he won’t let Tony fail.
Tony slips on the simple gold ring. It’s not much but he knew Steve would love it and really, it’s just a place holder until they pick out their wedding bands together. Steve tackles him to the ground the second the ring is on and covers him with kisses.
Tony’s face scrunches up, like he’s contemplating laughing again, but it smoothes quickly. “No. No, not Pepper. No, this is far, far worse.”
Tony’s head spins at the thought of it. It doesn’t matter that Steve isn’t his anymore. The thought of Steve looking at another man like that, being intimate enough to paint him like that, makes Tony see red.
Steve snaps out of it pretty quickly, returning his gaze to Tony in a matter of seconds. It takes a moment but eventually he says, “Yeah, it’s just weird. I remember when that thing was first built.”
Tony practically digs his trowel into his poor, abused wall, grinding the drywall compound into the mesh lining like it’s the reason everything is such a mess right now.
Bruce’s head popped up at the mention of his name, brows furrowed. He understood Fury’s appalled tone once he saw the look he was shooting at his teammate.
The second time he paid a visit to the tower, it was actually to talk with the team about Avengers business. They all needed to have a serious chat about the massive amounts of property damage they managed to inflict every time they went out into battle. If he got one more seven figure bill from Bloomberg’s office S.H.I.E.L.D might just go bankrupt and he might just have to kill somebody.
Maybe it’s the tone of concern in Tony’s voice or maybe it’s just the culmination of weeks of frustration but something inside Steve snaps and he turns away from the punching bag violently.
There’s nothing but silence in the car for a while, Tony making it clear that he can’t bring himself to say any more for the night. He watches as Steve moves his hand to the radio and switches it on. He fiddles with the knob for a minute before Frank Sinatra’s voice comes through, a little fuzzy but there nonetheless.
? I know for a fact that anyone in this house would have gone with you. Hell, Betty would’ve gone with you and she doesn’t even live here.”
“Really?” Steve says, unimpressed as he sways to the beat. “After all these years trying to impress you.”
“Uh.” Steve shuffles again. “I’m watching a Hitchcock marathon on TV. You want to come in and watch?”
He drags Steve in the elevator with him and presses the button to a floor Steve hasn’t been to yet. At Steve’s questioning look Tony just tips his glass towards him in a mock-toast, takes another sip, and says “That’s something I can work with.”
Thor turns his head back to Tony just to shoot a blank look at him that tells Tony that he has absolutely no clue what Tony is referring to. “It is an orchard,” is his only reply.
can change. I can watch what I say, I can check my temper. We can go to counseling if we need to. But not this. Tony, I need-”
Steve thinks that he may just die too as all of the blood in his body slowly pools in his face.
When he notices what he now knows was the cause of everyone’s secrecy last he nearly falls to his knees.
“Yeah, I’m fine. Have a knife dug into my shoulder, so I’ve been better,” Tony says, forcing a smile so that Steve will stop looking like the world is about to end. “But I’m happy that you’re here. I was worried there for a sec with the, ya know, giant wall of electricity.”
“Just making sure you’re alright,” Tony replies, trying to tamp down on any tenderness that may throw Steve off. His hands twitch to reach out and brush across his lip. “You got shuffled off to the infirmary right away so I didn’t get to make sure you were okay.”
“He’s going to need the help,” Coulson says, shooting him a steely cool look. “I overheard Captain Rogers talking about how he proposed the other day and apparently he spent the majority of it listing off his major character flaws.”
“Anyway, I just happened to be passing the door to your hovel here and saw that lovely angry vein in your forehead popping out like it was trying to escape and decided to charm you with my presence.”
Steve turns to face his new husband after having properly thanked Betty for her attempts at swing dancing with him and lifts an eyebrow.
“You love it,” Natasha says plainly from his side. Tony supposes that he can’t argue.
“It’s 11:30 on a Saturday, old man,” she replies, sounding as amused as Natasha ever does.
He squints, cocks his head, and listens really hard but his brain is working on maybe ten percent efficiency right now and he just can’t. Somewhere in the back of his head he realizes that he needs to bring food back to his poor, bedridden boyfriend but his confusion overrules whatever concern he may have.
“How do you feel about marrying a centenarian?” Steve teases.
“No, everything’s fine with the room,” Steve says tightly and Tony knows that everything is most definitely not fine.
“What?” Tony asks, offended on Steve’s behalf for a moment. He doesn’t even notice that Steve’s sinking back into the couch.
“…Not a bad song, per se.”
Steve hooks their ankles together where they’re swinging below them and whispers, “Yeah. Doesn’t seem like that long though.”
Then they get the call.
Tony looks down at Steve in their bed and focuses on the steady up and down movement of Steve’s chest to center him.
“I think this is actually the most depressing thing I’ve ever seen.”
Stark doesn’t look surprised to see him, but then again Stark looks like he wouldn’t notice if a herd of elephants had busted the door down. Fury can tell from the glazed look in his eyes that he’s completely wasted and as he moves further into the room it only becomes more obvious; from the heavy stench of alcohol and scattered bottles to the disheveled state of the room and Stark’s clothing.
“Red. Hot rod red. Cherry red,” Steve replies with a secretive little smile, like he always does when he tells an inside joke.
Her words carry a heavy weight and Steve feels guilt pool in his stomach. He couldn’t stand it if he was driving wedge that drove a friendship apart. He’d lost too many of his own friends to let that happen.
“I hadn’t thought of apple crisps!” Betty gasps. “I like the way you think, honey!” Betty beams over at Bruce. Steve laughs. Another apple core rolls past Tony’s feet.
Tony looks around and notices that it’s a pretty typical morning at the tower. The kitchen smells like coffee and pineapple from the fruit salad Bruce is making. Everyone else is crowded around the kitchen table, reading the paper or munching on toast or cereal. Nothing seems out of place.
Tony hums in what Steve assumes is agreement but could easily be one of the drowsy little noises he makes when he’s half-asleep.
Only to throw his sketchbook at Tony’s face.
“Okay, sacrifice is all good and fine when it’s necessary,” Tony says, getting more and more agitated as baby Leonardo DiCaprio turns progressively bluer. “But this wasn’t necessary. He could’ve gotten on the damn door. He could’ve found another piece of furniture. It’s just dumb. Jack Dawson is dumb.”
“Yeah,” Tony says simply, pressing his lips to Steve’s as the ball hits the ground and all sound is reduced to the cheers from the screen and Thor bellowing “Happy New Year, Midguard!”
“So Nirvana was a band in the late 80’s and 90’s,” Steve says, looking up at the speakers. “And disco was a music and dance thing in the…?”
Tony isn’t a labels kind of guy anyway.
“Tony,” Steve chokes out. “Tony, I’m so sorry. I was out of line. I’m so, so sorry.
“Uh,” Tony starts, wanting to draw out as much time as possible so that he can get the words exactly right. He finally settles on just ripping off like a band aid. “I’m not perfect,” he spits out and Steve looks like that’s the last thing he was expecting Tony to say.
“Tony!” Betty says happily, apparently completely unaware of his complete internal crisis. “I’m teaching the boys some yoga! I’m starting them off with the downward facing dog, what do you think?”
“Yeah…” Tony knows he should have a smart retort up his sleeve but he can’t help but get lost in Steve’s carvings, which are slowly forming another new picture. He zones out just long enough to realize that the lines are coming together to form a black cat at the base of the tree and blurts out, “How?”
Fury’s tired. And not your regular kind of tired. No it’s the aches-in-your-bones kind of tired. They’d just been through a long battle and an even longer day. He wanted nothing more than to just go home and fall into bed and not think about anything for a while.
Steve’s crying. Tony’s crying. Tony can hear Betty crying from here. A quick glance out at the crowd shows that pretty much everyone is crying. Even Natasha seems to have shed a tear or two but Tony writes it off as sweat since he’s pretty sure that Natasha had her tear ducts removed as an infant.
Tony shakes as if he’s been pulled violently out of a train of thought. “What’s my what?”
He shuffles out into the hall quickly after that, not wanting to deal with this whole
“Care to explain?” Tony tries again.
“I’m happy for you two,” she says, voice warm and gentle. “You make a good pair.”
“I wasn’t,” Steve says absently as he digs around for the floss so that all the toiletries can be neatly stacked together in one bag. “But I’m not surprised. I tried to tell him to go for that sleep test thing that SHIELD offers but he didn’t bite.”
Tony’s got a million questions on the tip of his tongue about Rhodey’s work in New York and how the war machine armor is doing when the elevator dings again and Betty ambles out looking like a yeti with an Etsy addiction. Her scarf, pom-pom hat, jacket, and boots are coated in snow along with her standard four tote bags, purse, and grocery bags.
“Oh.” Tony looks down at the little book poking out of Steve’s pocket with a blank look, totally deflated now that his insanity hypothesis has been thwarted. He perks up again when Steve’s words finally settle in his brain. “Wait! Isn’t this something I should know about as your 21
Tony smiles back if only because Steve’s amusement is contagious. He pulls Steve’s hand in his up to his mouth for a kiss before saying, “Now darling, we all have our strengths.”
“I don’t want your excuses, Captain!” he screams, “You two are ridiculous! Stark, you are a forty year old man. And you!” he says, pointing at Steve. “You’re ninety! And you’re both in here making out like a bunch of teenagers! Ridiculous! Suit up! Now!”
Because he can’t.
He’s tried apologizing but Tony’s shut himself away in the lab, locking it shut and barring access to everyone else. He won’t answer his phone, won’t come to bed, won’t even yell at Steve to go away when he pounds on the lab door for an hour straight, begging Tony to come out.
He levels Steve with a look and a nod, saying “Rogers,” before turning to were Tony lay, half awake from the commotion and curling into Steve’s side.
Steve’s head is spinning at the heaviness of Tony’s words and he can’t do anything but choke out an awkward, “That’s good,” before he’s pressing his lips to Tony’s.
on that thing!” The nurses turn to stare at them and start to mumble when Tony yells coconuts at the top of his lungs and Steve can feel a flush of embarrassment crawl across his cheeks.
Tony doesn’t know what to say. His mouth is working to form words but he can’t find any. He’s honestly struck speechless for the first time in his life with how overwhelmingly touched he is.
“Where’s your art stuff?” Tony asks, apparently the king of word vomit tonight.
Tony passes his hands over the sketchbook and a blue light follows him every movement. He types a few commands into the computer, feeling Steve’s eyes following his every move with curiosity. Tony moves quickly, Steve’s curiosity spurring him on, and can’t help but exclaim “Ta da!” when it’s all done.
Steve just nods and awkward silence descends over them for a moment.
“Hey!” Bruce protests but it’s half-hearted, and Steve makes a small happy sound so Tony doesn’t even pretend to apologize.
The table goes dead silent for a few moments before Tony blurts out, “You need to go.”
“You still mad at Coulson?” Steve teases. He’s way too proud of the fact that he rendered Tony speechless.
And Tony laughs again at that.
“A rip off,” Tony says, flashing him a wide, cheeky smile as Steve lets out a burst of surprised giggles.
“Mmhmm,” Fury hummed, unimpressed. “And what about Stark and Rogers?”
“He’s one of my good friends and the only one in this tower that isn’t getting any,” Tony argues. “I think that it’s my obligation to help him out here. And I met this professor at the Baruch commencement ceremony last summer you know, the one who made all the cookies I brought home?”
Despite all this, the first thing she does when she enters the room is let out a shout of excitement. “Jim! Oh, this is such a nice surprise!”
and also partially because it’s a real Caravaggio
your personal tracking system nor am I Stark’s GPS,” he snapped down the phone. “I’m sure Stark will stumble back home eventually. He’s a grown ass adult. He can take care of himself.”
Epilogue:
? I fuckin’ lucked out on that one.”
“I swear I told her Steve, Nat! I clearly said
He calls the Avengers to assemble over the comm and they dispatch quickly. All except for two. He presses his finger to his ear piece, already thoroughly annoyed.
“Steve had already contacted the major retailers in the city by the time he told us,” Betty says. “So, Bruce and I started putting out feelers at local pawn shops. As well as doing research into shops that would’ve closed in the last thirty years. That took us a while but we eventually found the shop and the original bill of sale.”
“Don’t be sorry,” Betty says, full mega-watt smile back on her face. “My life’s been just fine. Even
“I mean, if we’re dealing with some crazy twilight zone where I’m cheating on
Tony thinks for a second that maybe he should be offended but then he isn’t. He’s settled and rooted and happy. He can take an old joke for tonight.
Thor stood over a heap of metal, a look of utter confusion on his face as he flailed wildly in an attempt to clear the smoke that was coming from what Fury assumed used to be an appliance.
“Really?” Steve asks with a smile when he sees the camera in Tony’s hands. “Is this something that requires photographic evidence?”
“Yeah, well, can you blame him?” he asked. “You gave us all a scare out there today.”
“I. Don’t. Think. So,” he said, punching out the words. “You are part of a team, Rogers. A team you are supposed to be Captain of. A team that is currently fighting without you. So you get yo’ ass in gear, kill some aliens, and move into the goddamn tower with your team.”
But then he takes Tony’s hand in his, guides the knife into place, and he whispers “I’ve got you.” And that’s all Tony needs to hear.
Clint claps him on the back and says, “You got good taste, big guy,” as Natasha separates the forks and knifes into two separate piles.
Tony comes to bed on day six. Their bedroom is dark except for the light from the lamp on Steve’s nightstand and Tony looks haggard and weak in the dimness. Most of all he looks devastatingly sad and it frightens Steve. Steve has seen Tony look a lot of things – infuriated, disappointed, hurt – but never sad. His body goes numb with panic.
Clint finally pries off the chains from around his wrists and Tony brings his hands forward to rest over Steve’s on his cheeks. “I was worried for a second there that you’d give yourself over,” he whispers, eyes getting heavy from exhaustion. And blood loss too, probably.
The roof time schedule goes back up. Thursday movie nights become alone time again. Tony’s a little disgruntled that they missed out on summer beach time together so he tries strip bowling to compensate. There are a lot of suspiciously obvious gutter balls.
He says, “Yeah, I did.”
He flips from page to page and all there is are lists and lists of random phrases and things and people ranging from YOLO to Bill Nye the Science Guy to hair bands. He flips and flips, searching for some rhyme or reason before finally blurting out, “Should I be worried that you’ve gone insane?”
“I’m here because the team’s here. The fact that you own the building means absolutely nothing to me.”
You’d think with all of his genius that Tony would’ve learned how to avoid the all seeing eye of S.H.I.E.L.D by now but to Fury’s surprise, he’s able to track him down on the first attempt. He’s even more surprised when he shows up to the address and actually finds Tony instead of something along the lines of a note that said ‘Haha, you’ve been punk’d. XOXO Your favorite genius billionaire playboy philanthropist.’
Steve’s starting to tear up but he’s still smiling and after a beat he starts nodding enthusiastically and Tony feels simultaneously relieved and overjoyed when Steve says a simple, "Yes, I love you, I will.”
“Your computer has more sense than you do,” Steve mutters into Tony’s shirt.
as the other man comes and settles down on the opposite end of the couch.
“Tony,
When Steve answers the door he looks shocked for a moment and then supremely confused and a touch uncomfortable. His uncomfortable eyebrow furrow, shuffle combo makes something twist in Tony’s chest and he’s on the edge again. He can’t stand it most days. Can’t stand how awkward things are between them. Some days he just wants to get in Steve’s face and yell at him, tell him that he misses him. He misses his laugh and his strong arms holding him in a real hug and his stupid sense of humor. That he wants nothing more than to have things back the way they were and that there isn’t a minute that goes by where he doesn’t question if breaking things off was really the right thing to do, or if he should’ve worked harder to save them.
Coulson closes his eyes for a moment, turning over the words in his head for a moment before saying, “Say: Steve Rogers, I spent my entire childhood hearing stories about you. About how kind and strong and brave you are. But nothing prepared me for the real thing. You are the strongest, most compassionate soul on this earth and one of the only true heroes the world has ever seen. I admire and love every piece of you and cannot believe that I am the one you’ve chosen to spend your life with. I vow to always strive to be better for you. I vow to be there for you through every tough decision and every happy moment. And most of all, I vow to always love you, until the end of my days.”
in indignation, and says “He did what he needed to so Rose could live on!”
“I-” Tony starts. He doesn’t know what to says so he just says, “Thank you.”
Even with the fighting to temper it, everyone else in the tower is thoroughly done with their sap. Bruce has gone from complaining to glaring to just moving as far as way as possible whenever their chats in the lab turn into making out on the equipment. Thor and Clint have posted a roof time schedule in the common area after walking up there to find Steve and Tony tangled together one too many times. Natasha is thoroughly peeved at having lost half of her sparring time with the only worthwhile partner in the tower because he’s always off on dates.
“Aren’t you coming?” he asks.
Sometimes Tony has a hard time with dark winter nights.
“Love you too.”
“I mean,” Clint hems and haws from behind the camera. “But it’s Tony so….”
“I was merely trying to make the delicious delicacy known as ‘poptarts’ and the device began to spew black smoke. I ripped it from the wall but it still emits a foul odor. I cannot be sure but I believe it to be poisonous.”
“He did,” she says with a heavy sigh. “He was damn good at it too. Made it to Sergeant in two years. He loved your old film reels as a kid.”
The spell seems to break when her eyes land on his name tag, literally shaking herself out of it. “I’m so sorry,” she apologizes. “My brother was in the army. You have a few of the same medals.”
He watches as Steve slithers onto his back and goes into the bridge position without prompting.
“Then what was it?”
“Hey now,” Bruce interjects, gesturing between them. “No chess cheats from the local genius!”
Tony outright snorts at that. “Oh really? Can I record that for when I’m being decidedly not perfect?”
Tony glances back at him and settles it with a simple, “Never you Steve, never you.”
Tony’s about to spew out a cranky response when his hands run over two rough patches on Steve’s bicep. He looks down and something catches in this throat at what he sees.
“No,” Tony says stubbornly, his jaw set. “No, not until you tell me.”
“Something wrong?” Natasha asked from his side.
“Really, Tony?” Steve says, voice shaking with repressed laughter. “I think I can handle it on my own.”
“And what is my color, Mr. Artist?”
“Whoa there,” Tony says, apparently not picking up on Steve’s hostility. “Everything okay?”
Despite the awkwardness, Tony can’t help but feel pleasantly warmed all over, especially when he catches a glimpse of his husband, chatting happily to Bruce. He’s already managed to get grass stains on his khakis and he’s wearing a denim shirt so old and worn that he’s had to patch it twice already but he’s as frustratingly beautiful as he always is.
