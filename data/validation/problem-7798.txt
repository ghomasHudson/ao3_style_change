He shook his head.
Until Steve.
“To be honest, I’m really at a loss here. I don’t know how to make it work with you anymore. So I talked to Ms. Potts and Col. Rhodes, even Happy. I asked them about you—how you and I can be friends because believe it or not, I actually do want to be friends with you.”
Her. Eve. The tiny little thing in his arms.
He wanted to say “
He anticipated this. But it still hurt to hear the myriad of emotions in her voice. Betrayal, fear, anger, loneliness.
“I’m old, and I’ve never had feelings for another man. At my age, I don’t know what to do. I don’t know how to do this. And I’m scared. Because this is the type of thing that scares me—you know, for a lot of reason. I’m scared, first, that you didn’t, couldn’t feel the same way, and then I’m scared that if you ever found out, you’d be mad at me and push me away and I know I won’t survive that kind of heartbreak.”
He was so busy covering the front door this time he forgot about tunnels. He had to laugh at himself for missing it (at this point Rhodey mentioned about being obsessed again). Steve was running circles around him and all he can do is delude himself that he’s gained some of that distance between them. That he’d somehow make some progress.
“Like hell you don’t! Get down—”
Of course that didn’t stop there. Because he’s Tony Stark and his luck is always one to go sideways, other things started popping up.
He didn’t ask her—he just cut up some more and held them out to her. She tentatively reached out and grabbed the food from his hands. It would be an hour later before she said anything to him.
“I said that in the heat of the moment!”
“Yes,” his tone, cautious. “But why do you need it? We can just stop by an ATM—”
“Noticed what?” She smirked at him before shaking her head.
He quickly gathered what little things she has on the table, paid the bill, tipped the man behind the counter a little extra for graciously agreeing to keep an eye on her, then left, with her still safely tucked in his arms.
“Let me just get our coats,” he said. And before he could protest Steve was already ushering him towards the exit, carefully dodging overeager greeters, extending hurried goodbyes and making sure they were never more than a foot from each other.
“What are you apologizing for, it’s not your fault,” he said defensively, trying to for some self-preservation a little too belatedly.
It wasn’t like he sought out to annoy the hell out of their “perfect” leader. But when he’s being his stubborn and immoveable self, it was just so easy—too easy for him to pick a fight and see what made the super soldier tick. In Steve’s mind, of course every little thing he picks on is justified. His rigid, uptight outlook on operations and how his teammates should act at all times is suffocating and frankly, not even that effective. So when he pushes, Tony pushes back even harder. Sometimes it’s just fun to rile Steve up. But other times, he really just wants to tell him to fuck off, shut the hell up and leave him alone.
“He’s just mother-henning.”
And indeed, he was. He knows he and Steve have a lot to go through to make this friendship work, but he’s not so off put by it now.
“What?”
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
He made about five paces before he turned and walked back up to Steve who was still looking at him with that confused look.
But only for a second.
“Goddamit, Steve! Why are you being stubborn about this!”
Him? Kissing Steve?
“Oh this is so good! You want to know if you’ve really done your job by using me as a test subject. If she’s not going to come after me.”
He found Steve murdering yet another punching bag in the gym.
“For a genius and a master tactician? Yeah, we kinda are.” He smiled and all of a sudden, it felt like the weight was off his shoulder and flowers were in bloom and there were fireworks in the sky and Steve—Steve was here, with him, looking at him with the same intensity and smile and love in his eyes.
“Why, because of my dad?” he spat. And there it was, the real reason he couldn’t ever see eye to eye with Steve. He reminded him too much of his father for whom he was never enough. For whom Captain America was the epitome of perfection.
As he asked that, Steve’s hand automatically reached out—as if to touch him on his shoulder but stopped midway. He must have remembered what he’d been trying to do, which was to give Tony what he thought he wanted. But then therein lies the problem, doesn’t it? Everything between them was not all what it seems.
He thought the time away would somehow lessen his feelings, but it actually had the opposite effect. It made yearning bloom in his chest. He caught himself, several times, almost marching towards Steve’s room, wondering why they hadn’t seen each other or talked in days, only to remember that he was trying to stay away.
But of course, she didn’t believe him. And he found himself silently praising her.
“What does it say? Mister, can you take me to her? Please?”
And yet, here he was. With yet another lease on life.
And where the hell is the mother? It doesn’t look like she’s still in the picture. According to the surveillance footage from the 6 drones, 2 satellite and several androids he’s set around the perimeter of the house by the lake that Steve currently occupied with his
“I didn’t want to, but this was Ross’ bargain—”
“I saw you two being cozy in the living room.”
“Here.” Steve handed him a glass. Their fingers accidentally touch, and it took all the control he had not to grab his hand and lace their fingers together.
“We’ve had an outbreak with the other super soldiers,” he continued. Like he cared to listen. Like he paid any attention.
“Please, I just need you to listen to me. Five minutes, you don’t even have to say anything—just let me—let me say what I need to say.”
came out, he didn’t immediately panic. Maybe she was just sick and didn’t feel like going to school. Then Tuesday happened. Of course by then it had been several days since they’ve gone. And then there also was a note.
He was tracking him from the moment he stepped out of the Raft until, after only a week and half later, his drone must have been spotted, and the trail went dead. It has been dead since. That was several months ago. During the first few months, he tried to tell himself “it’s okay, we’ll find him again,” but he hasn’t yet, therefore his slight (Rhodey says debatable) panic is quite earned at this point.
“Isn’t that why you’ve been avoiding me? Cause you found out about my feelings for you? That’s why I’m here to apologize now if I’ve made you uncomfortable or think that I’ve been taking advantage of you, because I never meant to and I had no plans of ever taking advantage of our friendship.”
“What?!”
he thought.
He turned to the scientist, his anger was curling off him and his hands quickly curl into fists. He heard rather than saw the agents assume position, ready to take him out at any moment. Smart move. Still not enough.
At his age, how does he even navigate this?
“Okay, I’m sorry for bothering you.” Before he could apologize, Steve was gone.
“Not interested. Get out. Before I take you out myself.” He knew the shorter man would get the threat.
“Later. I-I just need to clear my head,” he said, turning away to hide the blush he knows is spreading all over his face.
He thought he maybe had a few more days before he could come up with an apology and an excuse that wouldn’t damage their friendship and easy rapport too much but Steve had other ideas. He found him again that night.
“Oh for fucks sake, Cap, I asked you to let it go!” He could taste the bile and regret in his mouth the moment the words were out of his mouth.
Apparently Steve finds out what you need—and does something about it.
She actually laughed this time. It gave him goosebumps.
“Y-you’re leaving?!”
He’d never felt closer to anyone, not even Rhodey whom he considers his best friend.
He was still frowning to himself long after she was gone.
And it made his blood boil.
How? Why? And how? He didn’t really see much of her that night but she looked to be around 8 or 9. Almost dead ringer for him too. Blond hair, blue eyes. They had the same mannerisms and same nuances. There was little of him on her face though—probably got her looks from her mother. But he couldn’t know for sure. Still, she was too old for any of this to make sense. Did he have her before the whole Siberia thing? Shit!
“This is Katarina, one of the super soldiers we’ve rescued. We’ve been working with her for the last year, trying to flush the brainwashing out—”
“You want some?”
But this girl has no one. And he saw it in her eyes. The recognition that no matter, the nightmares are never going to stop. And she would keep on carrying that burden like an anchor around her neck.
“How come?” he asked. He watched her struggle with herself once again.
“Don’t leave. Don’t leave this place. I won’t tell anyone, I promise.”
“B-Buck…” he heard the man on the ground gasp. His eyes met Steve’s. Glazed over with shock and disbelieve.
“I only even considered this because I know you can take her down if it turns out she’s not well yet.” He said, his voice soft and full of apology and desperation.
“You’ve been avoiding me.” It wasn’t a question. And neither was it accusatory.
A week later, he was released. Nat, Sam, Lang and Wanda were released several days ahead of him. Because he was the main attraction of this circus, it made sense for Ross to prolong his agony. But he couldn’t be more wrong. Because the truth is, he was fine staying inside the Raft. It made things less complicated for him. He was told what to do, he didn’t have to think of anything. There was no pressure to be anyone but a washed-up superhero who failed. He thought it was going to be hard but surprisingly, accepting his fate was easier than he imagined.
He really, really wants to serve his full sentence.
“And the others?”
But he doesn’t tell Tony any of this. He doesn’t speak to Tony. If he was expecting some kind of gratitude, he doesn’t have any for him.
“I’m older than you.”
“E-eliminate him,” she drawls out.
“I’m fine. You need a medic,” he cried at the man who is already getting up and refitting his shield on his arm.
He sees the shocked expression on the smaller man’s face. He smirked at him as if saying
“Rogers, someone’s here to see you,” the guard called out. He grunts but doesn’t move. He has no intention of getting up from his bed. Especially when the visitor finally steps up to the bars of his cell window.
“What, no lecture today?”
“What—”
“I thought being your friend, your best friend would be enough, but I couldn’t help it,” he cried.
Later, when they’re on their last train, he’ll allow himself to relax a little. When they’re finally somewhere in the Midwest, surrounded by endless fields of wheat and gold and barley, he’ll close his eyes and rest while Eve plays with her crayons. Her soft humming would put his mind at ease for bit, allowing him some respite from the dark thoughts that have taken permanent lodging in his brain. Before he met her, he never thought he’d be capable of silencing his mind anymore. He never thought he’d be capable of having thoughts other than that fateful day in Siberia.
“And then what if you DID feel the same way and we tried and because I’m me and I always screw up I fail and lose you and that’s—I don’t even want to think about it.”
“I wasn’t making rash decisions. I was saving you. And since you’re okay then I’m okay, got it?”
He’d slipped.
So he found her making a sandwich. And to alleviate some of the tension she offered to make him one, which, he didn’t object to because he actually was in the kitchen to find something to eat. But it turns out they are out of veggies. Tomatoes and lettuce. He was already pulling out his phone to put in an order for an expedient delivery of said items when Wanda smiled at him and said he doesn’t need to. They’ve been growing their vegetables for months now.
And to realize you’ve been doing this for years. Your family is gone. Everyone you know is gone. Even the families of those you’ve killed are gone.
“Only technically and don’t interrupt cause I don’t know if I could ever find the courage to say these things again.”
“I thought you hated it whenever I told you what to do. Besides, you’re right, your decisions are science and math-based and are almost always the right call. Letting you do what you need to do out there has increased our productivity by a huge number. Less damage, almost no casualties, and quicker turnabouts.” He said the last part with flourish, like he was so proud of the improved efficiencies.
Beside her is a scientist, holding a chart, quietly studying the girl. To his side is a small table with what looks to be a gun but is currently covered by a piece of cloth.
“I lied to you, took advantage of your friendship.”
“Of course you heard that,” he sighed. He straightened his back and mustered enough courage to look Steve in the eye.
Whatever hesitation he had, the younger man swallowed it. Instead, he pulled out his money clip and handed the taller guy 2 thousand dollars.
“Get. Out.” He watched as the other guy grasped for words. He knew he’s being careful, whatever he says next will either get him beat up or change his mind. But it didn’t really matter. Nothing would change his mind.
“Steve!”
He kissed him to shut him up.
Because that fluttering in his stomach, that smile that’s pulling at his lips, that deep desire to reach out and touch the man still smiling at him—
“No!” he huffed indignantly. “I just got really busy.”
And he knew what it was she was asking for.
Steve’s brows furrowed.
“Steve, please.”
Because this is Steve. Master tactician. And forever a pain in his ass, though admittedly one he can’t live without (
“What are you supposed to do to him?”
He would get Steve out. Because, dammit, now that he’s had time to calm down and think on what he has done, he knows he owes it to Steve.
, steer him back to their home,
“That wasn’t the first or only time you’ve said those words to me, Tony.”
But in just one moment, all of that changed. When he knelt and took her in his arms, he knew, from then on, that she will be all he will fight for. Nothing and no one would ever mean as much to him as she does. For the first time in years, he felt his heart beat again.
As she sobbed and wailed, as she repeatedly called out “mama”, as she sunk to the ground, her grubby little knees giving out on her, he felt her take hold of something he thought he’d lost in his years in the Raft.
Rhodey says he’s being obsessed. He disagrees, of course. He just wants to make sure Steve’s okay. As atonement for what he did. Rhodey doesn’t buy it but doesn’t bring it up anymore.
“Do you mean it? Everything you said?”
Tony snorted and clapped back.
He never really saw himself as the family man. Someone told him once, Ultron, that he existed only for war. He never admitted it, but deep inside, he knew it was true. When he’s fighting, he finds purpose. And it’s not really so he could go home and live a normal life and have a family. It was always about looking for the next fight, the next battle, the next war.
“Yeah,” he cleared his throat. “Just a little off—I think I’m gonna go ahead…”
Of course he’d assume something was wrong. Why else would there be a need for them to talk? After all he’s done to keep distance, exclude him—not really but somehow that’s how it felt—from Steve’s daily life.
“What idea? Is it about improvements on our gears? Cause you know you can throw ideas with me—”
“Shouldn’t you just go to bed?” the worry was still evident on Steve’s face, but he doesn’t seem as agitated as he was when they were still in that party.
Okay. Attraction. He was familiar with that. He can and he’ll get over it—eventually.
“I am a soldier. What I’ve been through, it all comes with the territory. But you—if I haven’t said it before, I’ll say it now. You are amazing, Tony. And anyone who calls you their friend is very, very lucky. Something I could only wish for. So you see, I wasn’t punishing you or anything. I only thought I was doing what you wanted.”
“I’m not the one who needs to go! You’re not fine!!! You just freefell thousands of feet—you were not breathing a moment ago!?”
He found Wanda making a sandwich. Now, his relationship with Wanda had always been, at best, civil. Too much guilt on her part and too much fear on his. He never liked people handing him things and she handed him all the ugly monsters in his head on a silver platter. Not a good first impression. But they managed to get past that. Really not much room to maneuver since Steve Rogers put his foot down and insisted they keep and nurture her.
His words fell on deaf ears. So he just kept talking.
“Of course.”
But then emotions got involved.
“I mean, I know I only asked you not to be mad but you don’t have to make fun of me either—”
“Wait—what?” He couldn’t help but shake his head in confusion. What was Steve talking about?
Ignoring the feeling that he’d been doused by icy water, he quickly turned and picked up his daughter,
“Is there something wrong?”
“Your stuff,” Tony said. And they were. His clothes, his old sketchbook, his passport and atm and bank book. Everything that tied him to his old life.
He looked Steve and for some reason, the awe and love and the way he seemed to be urging him to speak and how he seems to be hanging on to his every word made his heart leap and his mouth moving.
“Yes,” he answered, still a little out of breath. “That’s why I’ve been avoiding you. Cause I didn’t know how to deal.”
Steve was walking towards him, that wretchedly gorgeous smile still on his face. And he’s trying hard not to panic, but his knees are shaking, and his stomach is doing all sorts of things and there were butterflies. And it feels like a spotlight was on him and on Steve and everything has faded into the background and there was only the two of them in the world. Steve and Tony. Like nothing and nothing else but the two of them made sense.
“I’m just going to get some water, okay?” He pulled out a water flask from his bag, stood up and headed towards the stream. He heard her grabbing the food as he leaned over to fill his flask. By the time he got back to his seat, the bread and cheese were gone, and she was halfway done with her jerky as well.
“We need you—”
“No, it’s not.”
“Okay, whatever this shtick is, considered me punished. I’m good, okay? I’ve learned my lesson. Teamwork is important. No man is an island. I’ll do better with the team.”
“Breathing now,” but even as he dragged himself back towards the building, he could see the laboured breathing and the wobble in his movement. He caught up to him and held his wrist tightly.
She didn’t move. She didn’t look away. She didn’t bring down the stick she was holding. But she didn’t attack either. So he took out half a loaf of bread, a small block of hard cheese and a pack of beef jerky from his small messenger bag. He saw the way her eyes followed the bread and cheese and meat. He saw her swallow pitifully from hunger, which she couldn’t deny even if she wanted to because just then her stomach grumbled.
He’s now gained some distance. He heard Tony enter his car and drive until he’s crawling right beside him.
. The only other time he’d felt those things were with Pepper, once upon a time. But even then, it wasn’t this intense. This pull—it’s threatening to rip him apart. He’d never felt like this before.
“You are really such a fucking hypocrite, you know that? When it’s me making rash decisions like this and getting myself hurt you fucking throw a tantrum but when it’s you, it’s okay? You are fucking unbelievable!”
The window to his cell opened with a heavy pound. It normally shouldn’t. But his cell—every nook and cranny—had been vibranium reinforced to make sure it would be strong enough to withstand his super strength. Not that they needed to worry about that. He had no desire to fight.
It almost threw him off his game. Sure, he gave Tony support. But he never told Tony what to do. By the 15
, 3 weeks later. On hindsight, he really should have known better.
“We’re a bunch of idiots, aren’t we,” he chuckled.
“We need your help though—” before he could stop himself, he pounded his fist on the wall of his cell, cutting the man off and making the place reverberate. His anger came in hot and raw, like a whip that hit an open wound. The guy behind the door grimaced and stepped back, trying not to let the fear in his eyes show. But as soon as it came, it was gone. Tempered back and put away in that same old place in his head that stores all the rage he doesn’t want to deal with anymore.
“Steve, what are you saying?”
So, that was a bust too. But Steve’s fuckery was apparently on a roll because he was still reeling from that discovery when another one smacked him on his face.
He’s really not a good judge of character. There’s Obie, for one. Christine Everhart. A whole lot more whose names and faces have faded over time. But it was true then, and it was true now, even when he thought he’d somehow learned his lesson. Because he thought he had Steve Rogers pegged down to the tee. Pompous, self-righteous and bane to his existence Steve Rogers. He was a wall. Immoveable. And was constantly getting on his way who is constantly in motion.
“Oh come on! You can’t tell me you haven’t noticed?”
“You are going to medical. If I am going, then so are you.”
It all came to a head when Steve got injured after saving him from a rescue attempt.
“I’ll always come back for you,” he said. The words were heavy in his mouth. He didn’t like making promises. Because he never liked breaking them whether it was his fault or not.
He didn’t have an answer to that. So he huffed his chest, turned on his heel and left.
“Why am I here?” He repeated, cutting him off, his voice now dangerously low.
He watched as Steve looked away, a resigned expression on his face.
The travel from the Raft to the secret lab took close to 18 hours, with a lot of transfers and blindfolds and sound suppression helmets. They took a great deal of care not to give away anything, may it be the location, or the way to get there. He rolled his eyes. Again, not needed. Because he doesn’t care. And also, pointless. Regardless of how many twists and turns they come up with, his brain has already mapped everything out.
In it was 2 thousand dollars. And some change, which he assumed was for interest.
Who would want to wake up and realize you’ve not only lost your life, but have taken countless others, with nary a say in it?
There’s really no coming back from that. So he didn’t say anything. He didn’t do anything except watch Steve walk away, having no idea where it’s all gonna go or if, heaven permits, things could still be fixed.
And the problem just keeps getting bigger. Because Steve wouldn’t let it go.
“You were the best one to make that call, Tony. None of us had eyes on that area.”
Of course there was a tunnel.
He went back to the center of the room, across the girl. The scientist holding the chart starts whispering in her ears the trigger words. He watched as the girl’s face contorted a million different ways—a whole spectrum of emotions washing over her as her mind is forced to bend one way but pulled back another. He watched her shake her head in fury, then in pain, then in fear and guilt and disgust and then back to fury again, over and over, never letting up as the conflict in her mind rips her apart physically. Then the scientist starts speaking.
A week later and he was still mulling over his realization. Steve had kept his word—he hadn’t bothered Tony about it though he still monitored Tony’s activities to make sure he was fed and didn’t overdo anything.
Rhodey mentioned being obsessed again as he pulled on his hair out of frustration. He’s pretty sure he’ll go bald soon with how he’s abusing his scalp. But he couldn’t help it. He’s an engineer. And a genius. When something doesn’t make sense, he needs to strip it bare and study it to figure out what’s wrong. When an envelope with his name on it, written by the one person he’s been looking for for months ends up on his desk and no one has an explanation, he needs to know how it happened.
And one day, after an intense battle that lasted for hours and leveled half a city, he did just that. He was tired, and sticky, and sick to his stomach because he could smell the wretchedly burning smell of flesh and the suffocating dark smoke and the destruction surrounding them. He wasn’t in the mood for one of Steve’s lectures.
“Good for you,” he replied mechanically, devoid of any real emotion, before closing his eyes and pretending to sleep. By now he was used to this charade. The guy would tell him things, he’d reply his non-committal and generic response, then the guy’s steady façade would falter and soon he’d leave, his head hanging low in defeat. He wasn’t really expecting anything different this time. Except that something did.
“Tony,” he called from down the hallway as Tony was about to enter his room and retire for the night (or early morning). He tried his best not to panic and run into his room, making sure to ask Jarvis to lock it and override Steve’s override codes.
She jumped, grabbed a stick and pointed it at him when he approached her. Her stance was feral and menacing, but her eyes only had fear.
.  Before he knew it, tears were streaming down his face, hot and desperate and broken. Why was he crying anyway? Didn’t he tell himself he’s willing to do whatever Steve wants? Clearly he wants to disappear—
“You have feelings for me too?”
He quickly walked over to her and held out his hand. And she was in his arms in seconds, clutching at his neck and shirt tightly. He saw the crease on her forehead—she must have been frowning before he came.
Steve Rogers walked up to reception and asked one of the receptionists to deliver the envelope. And because this is Steve Rogers, no one thought to question it, no matter how odd the request may have been. He didn’t even need to sign anything to get inside. He was dressed simply, trying to blend in (as if), and perhaps to untrained eyes that would pass. Very attractive guy, but still, just one of us, trying to get through the day. It was why no one thought to look at the security footage of the lobby for the public. He didn’t, not at first. Not until he’s exhausted everything else, and only because, as a genius and as an engineer, gut feel told him to review those footage anyway.
She thrusted the letter she’d been clutching the entire time to him. The paper is nearly decimated from the dirt and tear of being constantly held. But the message is still there.
Please.
As it turned out, he actually did need Cap’s help. A short EMP disabled him for mere seconds but it was enough to cause him some kinda major problems. He swaggered a little, an enemy got a lock on him, and a nuke, a bit excessive if you ask him, was headed his way. If not for Cap’s quick thinking, quick action and just quick everything (Cap was on the rooftop of the building he was circling, he jumped—or flew, close to several hundred feet to catch Tony midair and clutched at him) he would have been fireworks in the sky and confetti on the ground before he could say
Maybe then he can assuage even just a fraction of the guilt that’s latched onto him since Bucky died.
He lost the cap and the jacket on his way back to the rendezvous point. Espionage 101 with Nat had always been one of the things he appreciated. Because for such a familiar face like him, he needs all the help he can get to blend in. And disappear without a trace.
“I worked a deal for you. We can fast-track your release,” there was no mistaking the controlled glee in his voice. Like a parent excitedly telling their kid even though it was hard, they found the toy they wanted for Christmas after all. Or a travel agent proudly exclaiming “yes! There’s still one seat in that flight you really need to take!” He didn’t buy into it. Especially after the next words he spoke.
He cut into his bread, sliced some cheese and grabbed a small handful of jerky. Then he started eating. She moved, then. Faltered a little, to be exact. But she also quickly got her footing back and continued her guarded stance. He continued eating, continued pretending he’s not minding her. And when finally, enough moment had passed, he offered.
If only it stopped there!
“Tony?” he heard Steve’s whisper which then took him out his stupor. He looked at Steve, saw his confused look and without meaning to, walked away.
This arrangement continued and became the norm. But it didn’t stop him from feeling weird. Truth be told he kinda miss the banter. It was fun poking a non-reactive Steve. It also wasn’t fun not having anyone to argue with most of the time.
He’d known Steve was a little shit. What he hadn’t known was how petty the super soldier was. It all started when he noticed during their next outing to save the world yet again, that Steve was not giving him any command. No, he wasn’t ignoring him. He told him things like location of enemies, or trapped civilians, or compromised structures. Whilst those reports used to be followed by direct orders—
“Do you have 2 grand?” the other man blinked at him.
So in answer he closed the gap with between them and he himself reached both his hands and grabbed Steve by his shoulders.
And it was so much more than he could have ever hoped for. Yes, things will be awkward for sure. And yes, there will be adjustments—a lot of them. After all, when it comes to feelings and emotions there’s really a lot more to it than meets the eyes. But he was also looking forward to all of it. More so because he gets to look forward to it with Steve. And isn’t that just the most amazing feeling in the world?
Before anyone knew what was going on, he jumped towards the table, grabbed the gun, and shot the girl point blank.
“What?”
“You’re still an active target,” Tony replied, the words burning in his mouth. He also couldn’t look at him.
And shit, he’s never known such terror.
“I think—I think I know why you’ve been avoiding me,” he said quietly, his head bowed down as if in shame. And wasn’t that nice? Steve still had the audacity to look embarrassed even though he’d been the one to keep this huge secret that has their friendship on the verge of ruin. He has the audacity to look embarrassed for rejecting a one-sided love affair.
Having learned his lesson from the last time he confronted Steve, he tried a different approach this time. He cornered Nat instead after he saw her and Steve, lounging around on the sofa, his arms lazily draped around her shoulder. Nat scared him. And he never saw her as the type of person who easily allows anyone to touch her, much less be that comfortable with her. But there they were. So now he’s here.
“Did you want me to give you orders?”
“It’s disconcerting, having eyes on you all the time,” he used to say. When they were still friends. Contrary to popular belief, he and Steve didn’t just argue. Sure, when it comes to fighting and being a team, verbal sparring was actually normal. But when they’re not subduing villains or saving innocent bystanders, they actually have easy, normal conversations.
“She says she’s sorry and hope you can forgive her.” They are the same words, but the weight is different. And still they broke her little heart and he had never known such pain.
Rhodey said something about obsession. Maybe he’s right. He needs to stop. He shouldn’t let Steve Rogers control his life. But for all his genius and unlimited resources, the problem remains. He doesn’t know how.
“Best be on my way before it becomes dark,” he replied. “How about you? You got somewhere else to be?”
Steve stared at him, still confused but now also partly worried.
. How does he have a daughter?
That stumped him.
But at the same time, just thinking of not being near Steve, of not being able to spend time with him and talk to him is doing something wicked to his heart and—
“Out with it. What’s your deal?”
“And you only have to do this once—then you’re free. You get to walk.”
, (see, he didn’t really break his promise when he said he won’t tell anyone; robots and AI don’t count), there’s only Steve and the little girl. No woman ever came.
But when were things ever that simple for
She was a mousy little thing. The way her shoulders were hunched down, the way she was trembling—it looks as if she’s trying to make herself smaller than she already is. And succeeding. She looked like a wet dog, eyes wide with grief and unshed tears. She looked pathetic and weak and—it shook him to his core, looking at her eyes. This look that was oh so familiar, despite the years. The look that haunted his dreams, right before it abruptly turns into a nightmare with blood spraying everywhere, getting into his mouth and drowning him.
“Why am I here?” he asked, his voice low and threatening. It was Tony who answered. Tony who apparently was in the room but didn’t register—rather, was ignored.
“He is listening to you, you know. The question is, have you been listening to him?”
. She had good survival instinct.
Before he could even think of a reply, Steve was walking away again, leaving him gaping on his own.
After a series of high-level clearances and whatnots he was ushered to the back of the building, presumably to where the project he’s needed is taking place. They passed by several rooms: several other undertakings ongoing. People in lab coats were everywhere, walking down hallways, talking inside rooms with glass doors and windows, running with some equipment of some sort from here to there. The lab was in full swing.
No one to atone for.
He did what he usually does—he ignored the guy.
“With this idea that popped into your head that you needed figuring out?”
“Are you okay? You look pale.” He almost swooned, hearing the concern on his voice.
Steve came to him one night after he’d read George Orwell’s 1984 after his prodding. He said he understood how, when it came out, the idea of a big brother seems like such a big deal. But now, with the technology, it has become the norm. Of course, the danger is still present. But no one is surprised by the fact that everything about you is but a click of a button away.
“I’m not gonna hurt you,” he said, his voice as calm as possible. It came naturally to him—in his other life it was one of the things he was well-known for: his calm.
As soon as he stepped inside the café and saw her look up at him and beam that mega-watt smile of hers, he relaxed, but only just a little. Paranoia doesn’t let up, and so does he.
She shook her head, a little too quickly.
How do you disappear completely in this day and age?
Except that it didn’t end. Because several days later, he was being hauled out of his cell by a platoon of agents, all equipped to the teeth by powerful but unnecessary weapons—enough to subdue him. Unnecessary because he had no plans of escaping or fighting back. But it helped calm the agents because lame or not, truth is he could kill them all easily if he wanted to. But that’s the thing. He doesn’t want to. He doesn’t want to do anything anymore.
He laughed. Out loud. And Steve frowned, confused and hurt.
The envelope was waiting for him on his desk. White. No stamps or any marking. Just his name written in that familiar script.
Like when he noticed that Steve was a touchy-feely troll. He always had a ready tap on the back, grip on shoulders, hugs for everyone—except, apparently, for him. He supposed it made sense for a guy who was frozen on ice to be touch starved. And it also made sense for said guy to be generous of his touches as well. And he was. Someone missed a shot? It’s okay! Here’s a comforting hug! Jubilant victory? Well, here’s more hugs to you! What’s that? Tony did a great thing? He got a nod. And a
“She left. I-I don’t know where she went,” she stumbled through her words. And then she was in front of him, holding his face with her tiny hands, and looking at him with pleading eyes.
“Tony, no!”
When Steve went silent for a moment, then told him, “okay” plainly, that should have been his first clue. He really was bad at judging people. And he really was very, very wrong about Steve Rogers.
The lobby of the building they entered is bland. Gray walls, gray tiles, gray furniture and a middle-aged lady who seems to have a permanent scowl on her face greet their entourage. It was only when they get here that he was allowed his sight and hearing back. Not that he cared.
Daughter. He had a
No matter what he does, no matter his intention, he always fucks up.
One minute he’s thinking about Steve’s toothache inducing ideas for team building, next he’s thinking about being pinned down by Steve as they wrestle for a flag, their bodies and faces pressed against each other that he could Steve’s breath on his skin. He’s thinking of his fresh injuries after fights and applying first aid on them and then kissing—KISSING them all away?!
About, and this gleefully surprised him, how easily he reads Tony’s moods. When he’s on a streak down at the workshop, he never interrupts but there’s always food coming up. He even got Tony some vitamins. When he’s pissed off, Steve would take him to blow off steam without pressing him to talk about why. And when he’s finally ready to talk, he always has pizza and beer ready and he’ll listen patiently to whatever rant Tony has, whether they were legit or trivial. And by god! He could talk to Steve for hours! And never, not once, did Steve show any sign of boredom or disinterest or even judgement.
When Monday came and no Steve and
When you have no one and nowhere to go, acceptance is the only way. It’s not like he didn’t contribute to the outcome of his fate anyway. He was, after all, captain of his own ship. He was the one who steered his own life into a fucking iceberg, crashing everything into the bottom of the ocean. He was the one who told lies, never mind that he thought he was doing what was best for his team. He was the one who made bad decisions, irrevocable ones that cost friendship and lives. He did what he thought he had to do—and this is the price of his decision.
Really, he’s fine.
“Do you need more?”
Steve looked up from his sketchpad briefly when he noticed him approaching but he didn’t stop what he was doing. Which sort of irked him. Can’t he tell this is he’s trying his best here? After a moment, he actually did speak up, probably misinterpreting his inner monologue of being able to do this as idling.
Steve frowned at him.
“What?” he shrugged, pretending nonchalance. “I’m just surprised. I didn’t know you two were that close.”
time it happened, he was a bundle of nerves.
He took a deep breath, willing himself to continue. The soothing caress of Steve on the small of his back gave him comfort.
He didn’t fight when they pulled him up and handcuffed him with vibranium reinforced cuffs. He didn’t fight when they hauled him out of the bunker and into the helicraft that would bring him to the Raft. Where he would be kept in secrecy, no doubt. He didn’t fight. He just stopped fighting altogether. When they were trying his crimes in secret. When they were sentencing him for a bogus accusation. When they finally shut the door to his cell where he would stay until he’s served his sentence—or he’s fixed the Accords, which is his top priority now.
“Did something happen at the party? You were fine earlier.”
Steve stopped then and turned to him.
Until he wasn’t because one day, one plain and boring day—the kind that just passes by and no one remembers—Steve decided to drop a bomb on him.
“You all get to walk.”
Well that surely stumped him.
He should have declined. He should have argued. He didn’t. He let Steve handle him, let him steer him towards their car,
“Soo, you and Steve?” he eased into it.
“You mean giving lectures?”
She couldn’t be more than 5 years old. She stunk, like she hadn’t washed or cleaned up in weeks. Her shoulder length, sandy blonde hair was greasy and stuck to her scalp, along with whole lot of other stuff. Her clothes were dirty and tattered. She looked more like a wildling from that movie Tony had made him watch one time than a little girl.
“Let this go? Please,” he said in his tiny, pleading voice that he knew Steve could never say no to. He watched as he silently deliberated with himself before giving him a stout nod and an understanding smile.
She gave him a weird look.
“I finally found you,” the shorter man said.
Once upon time, he thought he had a home to go home to, a family to be a part of. How long has it been since that time? Felt like ages ago. That was a good memory. Good while it lasted. But not enough that he can explain Tony’s continued presence in his life. He knew most of it was guilt. But he’s as guilty of everything that happened too. Unlike Tony, he never wants to see any of them again.
The pot bubbled, loud in the otherwise silent room. Tony smiled down at it as he stirred in large circles, scraping the side of the vat where the sauce threatened to burn.
Steve jolted at that, his mind moving at a hundred miles an hour. Was it really true that Tony almost didn’t go? Tony had left so easily, coming to see Steve once to tell him that he was leaving and then just walking away without a pause in his step. Nothing had ever really seemed to bother Tony, and normally Steve admired that. That day, though, Steve could have done with some emotion.
“You know you’re not going to like it,” Tony said, taking a sip when Steve continued to gesture. Tony made his coffee as black as he could get away with, whilst Steve could barely tolerate white coffee on a good day. His drink of choice was a tea with more milk in it than a shake. So much milk that it was hardly even tea, in fact, and that it became more like drinking a sugary glass of milk. Tony had long since stopped making it out of protest. It was disgusting.
Steve let out an angry breath, words dying in his mouth. Of course he would – but that wasn’t the point. He didn’t want rationality, he wanted an argument.
Tony stood up, pushing his chair away from the table with a hideous screech across the tiled floor. “Nope. Cover everything off on your own. Steve can have it all.” He turned to his lawyer, trying his hardest to ignore the way his voice had cracked on his husband’s name. Ex-husband’s name. “I’m going to find a decent cup of coffee. Call me when it’s done.”
Steve’s brow furrowed and he looked down at the small piece of material sticking out of Tony’s blazer pocket. “It’s nice? A bit plain, but very smart. I had thought I put out a blue one for you, though?”
“Of course.” Steve set Peter down on the floor and pushed him over to May who took his hand and led him back to the couch. “You okay?”
Maybe it was the way that it always seemed too perfect. Nothing was ever perfect.
If anyone would ever ask why Tony shot out of his skin and spilt his coffee all over his hand, then Tony would have blamed the fact that he hadn’t slept in weeks. Not since Steve had presented him with papers and walked out of their house. Everything made him jump when he was alive because of caffeine alone.
“Da?”
“Who ever knows what Pete wants?”
“What?” Steve’s eyes shot up to Tony’s in a panic, his mouth handing open. “No. No, you can’t–”
Fuck, but how did he always get himself into messes? He didn’t want to talk to anyone, didn’t want to have to explain what happened or what he’d done. All he wanted was to be loved by the man he loved, to be wanted back and to be seen as more than a drunken fuck.
Tony huffed. “Are you a therapist as well as an OBGYN now?”
“Merry Christmas, mom.”
“A few peppers, if you’d like.”
♡♡♡♡♥
“Hi!”
“Don’t.” Tony shook his head once. His vision was suddenly blurry and he blinked in quick succession, trying to fix his eyes on a small weed springing up between two paving stones.
“Yeah.” Tony’s mouth was dry and his knees weren’t going to support him for very much longer. “Anytime. You know that.”
He got another soft smack and, obviously sensing a losing battle, Tony shrugged and leant back against his seat, waiting to let Peter wake himself up.
“She’s a genius,” Tony said automatically, “but no one ever says that. They only ever talk about how hot she is, or what she was wearing, or what they wanted to do to her.”
Though the message started simply enough, even that single word was enough to bring Steve to his knees. God, that
No, he can’t have been. Steve heart was beating out of his chest, had he really been saying
“Oh, darling.” Peggy squeezed Sarah even harder, as though trying to mould their bodies together. “Is he coming back?”
“That was me,” Steve said, words carefully thought out, if a little hesitant, “swiping right. If you’ll still have me. I’m swiping right on both of you.”
Steve had never loved flying, but he had a feeling that he was going to enjoy the journey ahead of him even less than usual.
Standing as close as they were, Tony felt Steve’s laugh vibrate through him.
“Could be worse,” Tony said, lifting his hand to cup Steve’s face, “I could put them in yours.”
Steve barely even registered the automated voice talking him through his options once again. His mind was elsewhere, a thousand miles away.
Tony smiled. “Yeah, you did, didn’t you? He’s not in a grade, yet.”
Tony was even more sure that he had been right about the tampered-with air, as he’d apparently slept through the entire exchange.
“Right. You’re six. What you would know?”
“Of course she could. The more the merrier,” Tony said automatically before he cleared his throat and knelt to the floor. “You really want to come again? Here?”
“No,” Steve eventually managed to stutter out, “it’s my uniform.” A stupid one, at that, and not something that kept Steve particularly warm when the snow began to fall.
And, well, that was something that Steve did
“Well,” Tony said after a pause and, when Steve looked up from the crappy, ill-fitted carpet, he’d taken a step right into Steve’s space. Holding up the ring, Tony tilted his head and his smile spread, “it just so happens that I’m desperate, too.”
“It was,” Tony agreed quickly. He kissed the tip of his index finger and placed it on the top of the mitten-covered hand Peter held up for him to inspect. “Let’s grab us a little one, yeah? A nice one – one that doesn’t poke our fingers and is just big enough for my star to fit on the top.”
“Yeah, Pete. Course we can, kid. What’s Christmas without a tree, hey?” An expensive tree, at that. Steve’s eyes had nearly fallen out of his head when Tony had handed over a wad of cash and tried to give him over half back, but Tony had held his ground. After all, he’d never bought a tree before – how was he meant to know the going rate? And he’d had a couple of mugs of hot chocolate to pay for, not to mention his child’s happiness. That alone was pretty expensive.
Steve used his grip on Tony’s hand to pull Tony into his chest, wrapping his free arm around Tony’s waist to hold them close together. Tony gave up without a fight, his shoulders slumping as he rested his hand on Steve’s chest.
“It’s a Saw-Whet.”
Steve turned at the sound of Tony’s voice and paled when he saw what Tony was holding. He’d almost forgotten he’d even bought it, but there it was in the cold light of day.
“I’m not wearing them, am I, babe? I wore them
So I know I should wait and save more money – and I will, I swear to you I will; I’ll get the money to buy a new one, a decent one, with real silver and maybe even a jewel, but,” Steve cut off and stared at Tony, right in those eyes that he loved so much. Once he’d started talking, the words just seemed to flow. “I just couldn’t wait, back then. It was after work one day when the heating had packed in and the rent was due and yet you were still there at home, just waiting for me. I had to buy something for you. I was desperate.”
After all, he was going to be wearing a thong and didn’t fancy too long in that sort of underwear.
Tossing out the apple cores and scraps he’d collected on the side of his chopping board, Tony settled in to decorate his pie. He preferred the open-top approach, liking to cover his filling with thin slices of apple and a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar instead of more pastry. Lost in thought, Tony startled when Steve wrapped his arms around Tony’s waist and pressed a kiss to his neck.
“Oh, goodness me. Sorry, darling,” she said quickly, shaking her head as she grabbed a tissue from behind her to wipe away the gel that had gotten onto Tony’s jeans at the movement.
“Welcome home,” Steve said before Tony could get a semi-coherent thought from his brain down to his mouth.
No one should have ever been made to feel as if they would be rejected or discriminated purely because of who was the most special thing in their life.
“Yes,” Tony said, moving his hand so that the ring was right between them. “But only if you ask me. The full question, that is. I don’t want to say yes and then find out we’ve been talking at cross purposes.”
> i have the mental scars it deffo happened
“You don’t,” Steve snapped. “You have no idea. Do you even know what you did?”
As stereotypical as it may have been, Steve loved apple pie. It had been something of a staple in his household when he’d been growing up and his mom had made it whenever they managed to get the fresh ingredients needed. Steve spoke so fondly of her hours in the kitchen, telling how he was often too ill and weak to do much more than sit at her side and watch, that sometimes Tony felt as though he’d been there too.
Tony stuck his cold hand up Steve’s shirt, darting back when Steve kicked out. “One day I’ll succeed,” he promised. “Just you wait.”
“Don’t,” Tony waved his hand again, face twisted into a causal brush off. “It’s fine. I’ve got Peter and you’ve got – no, look, it’s not a problem. I can’t be mad. Though,” he pointed at Steve and blew out a breath, “you’ve got
Neither could Steve, he thought incredulously. He wouldn’t have admitted the small wave of thrill that he got from Tony’s confession to anyone, but he felt it. It was probably sadistic of him, but the feeling was especially strong when Tony’s voice broke as he spoke. Steve got a tiny rush of something from just knowing that he did actually have some effect on the other man, an effect that he had not known he had had when they had been together.
The gel was just as cold on his stomach as Tony had always heard it would be. He winced involuntarily at the chill and Nurse Rogers looked up with a rue smile.
“Woah. Woah, dude,” Tony said quickly, waving his hand in front of himself as though the stranger would see it, “it’s alright. I’m messing, wow.”
“Dad, I don’t know what to tell you,” Peter said with a shrug. He narrowed his eyes at the screen in front of him again, focusing in on some clear markings adorning the chest of one of the robots. It looked familiar, almost as though they were a similar army to one the Avengers had seen before. “You haven’t been a single parent for a very long time. Steve has a room at yours, spends most nights there. He’s always there for our father-son night. He used to take me to school and get up with me when I had nightmares. You have to have seen this happening.”
that much in Steve’s expression. There was still love there. Nothing but love.
Tony was about to fall asleep when his phone suddenly started to buzz. Groaning, he threw his hand over his face and cursed the day that he’d made his agreement with Natasha. But he had made the deal and there was no going back, for better or for worse.
He broke off and Steve’s heart sunk as he realised why. The tyres crunching over the gravel of the parking lot just behind him explained it all and Steve could have cried.
Rhodey laughed and stood up. “Well then, kid. I’d better get going and I know nothing else I can say will ever rival that. Have the best time.”
“Room for a little one?”
Except for when it was snowing on Christmas Eve and he’d been shouted at on at least four separate occasions for things entirely out of his control in the single week leading up to it.
And then Andrew had appeared. Tony wanted to hate him; he really,
“Steve would love this,” he breathed out.
There was a long moment of silence before Sarah pressed her lips together, knuckles going white as she held Peggy closer. “He’d be such a wonderful dad,” Sarah said quietly. “Can’t you just imagine him, Pegs?”
“Yeah, sure. Thanks.” Steve squinted at Tony, looking at him questioningly. “Hey, are you okay?”
It took Steve a moment to remember where he was and what was happening, but it was Tony who moved first to speak back to Peter.
Tony didn’t answer. He wasn’t surprised. Nothing could surprise him anymore, he didn’t think.
“You don’t know that.”
He had a feeling he was going to need to.
“You’ve never done this–”
Peter giggled. “Yeah.”
And, fuck it, if that wasn’t what he had wanted all along.
It was May’s turn to laugh and she reached over to swat Tony on the leg. “You’re awful.”
“No. Not with this ring.”
“Which is why it’s so good for me to see him warm up to someone. You were great with him. Thank you.”
“This is his first Christmas with me. He lives with his mom’s sister, but she got struck down with the flu this winter. I picked Pete up just this morning and I have him for the next couple of weeks. It’s the longest he’s been with me since it happened, actually. We normally only ever have weekends. I said she could come too, of course, but she didn’t want to risk us all getting sick.” Tony dug his nails into his palms as best he could through his thick leather gloves and swallowed thickly, keeping his eyes firmly ahead and not giving into the urge to meet Steve’s gaze that he could feel burning on the side of his face. “It’s my first Christmas with a child. Or anyone, actually. My family’s not exactly big on the holiday.”
And that stopped Tony in his tracks. What was the supposed to mean?
“I am!”
With cum-stained pants and hardly any energy, they’d stumbled into the living room and ordered pizza at 3 am. They’d shared sticky kisses over the greasy food until Steve had fallen asleep on the couch, one hand clutching a crust and the other stroking over Tony’s back.
Having a busy daddy also meant that sometimes Tony didn’t get picked up from school on time. When his daddy was actually at home and had been told to pick Tony up, he sometimes forgot. It didn’t happen all the time, but there were days when Tony would be left sitting on a bench outside of school, his little legs swinging through the air as all the other kids waved goodbye and headed home, their hands firmly held by their own mummies and daddies.
Before Steve could say anything else, a boarding call rang out through the airport lounge.
Too careful, sometimes. For a stupid, brief moment, Tony almost contemplated asking for the guy’s name and maybe making Natasha reconsider. It was time for her to meet someone and Tony could vouch for the guy, in a weird sort of way.
“Except you were never at home,” Steve said, voice soft but not exactly gentle. “I’d sit up and wait for you only to find a message from whatever assistant you had that week telling me that you’d booked another meeting and I wouldn’t be seeing you until the next day. It felt like a message of its own, in the end.”
“Exactly.” Nurse Rogers smiled, blue eyes shining. She clapped her hands together then and turned to grab a thick envelope, which she thrust towards Tony. “Right, my love, I’m sure you can read, but I just need to reiterate what the pamphlets say. No smoking, no drinking. Don’t paint your own nursery and stay away from strong fumes. You’re allowed 200mg of caffeine a day from now on – it’s up to you how you take it. No raw foods, please, and no hot tubs. There are more details in the pack, but I think those are the main things.”
“Good.” Closing the gap between them, Steve’s tongue nudged Tony’s lips open immediately, plundering his mouth.
Tony thanked her when they were printed off and with him, but he couldn’t take his eyes from the photo in his hands. Of course he’d known he was pregnant, but actually seeing the proof in his hands was something else entirely. There was something growing inside of him.
At one time, Peter would have resented that, would have gotten mad and indignant about his dad calling him a kid. It was hard to care about being called a child when all Peter wanted to do was crawl into bed with his dad and bury his head into Tony’s chest.
Sarah smiled sadly and took Peggy’s hand in hers. “My boy chose well,” she said.
After a moment he felt Tony’s eyes leave him and, looking discreetly through his lashes, he saw Tony settle down into his own seat. It was the one by the window in the row directly in front of Steve’s. Brilliant.
“Hello, Mr. Fish,” Steve said seriously and reached out to take a fin between his fingertips, shaking it up and down.
Tony’s face did something complicated before he answered. “I’d say so. Isn’t it always breakfast time?”
Fuck. Tony had hoped that he had been wrong on the previous night when he had caught longing looks from Sharon to Steve, but the forced causal tone that Steve had adopted told him that he’d read it correctly.
“Mistletoe!” Peter said, a cheeky grin on his face as he laughed again, “May says you gotta kiss under mistletoe at Christmas.”
Tony pressed the lock button once more for good measure. “I’m not hungry.”
Nothing except knowing that Tony would hate it.
“Of course I do. I thought you wanted this.”
“I tried,” Tony said on a moan, turning his head from Steve’s neck to look up at his nurse with a pained and weak smile. “I really – fuck – did.”
Tony’s arm shot out as though fighting an invisible demon and Steve reared back quickly to avoid being hit.
“Happy birthday,” Tony murmured as he fell back against Steve’s chest. “Wasn’t expecting you up just yet. Thought I tired you out last night.”
“I’ve queued up the best list of movies for tonight. There’s a theme and you’re gonna have to guess-”
“No!” Steve’s hand shot up and grabbed Tony’s. “No, God. Fuck.
It was worrying, really, how hard it was to say no to Peter so soon after they’d met.
It wasn’t in-keeping with their brand of banter and hiding their emotions, but Tony couldn’t find it in himself to care about the honesty. Though what he had said had been with a joking tone, Steve’s wholehearted reaction to Tony’s words made his chest pound.
nothing. They were a team, weren’t they? There wasn’t one without the other.
“You’re an idiot.”
Downing his coffee and wincing at the protesting thud his head gave, Tony willed his thumbs into typing out one more text before he threw his phone across the room and tried to force his body into sleep.
The hug that Steve caught Tony in was the final straw. Tears sprung to Tony’s eyes and he twisted his hands in Steve’s jacket until his knuckles went white. It was for the best, he told himself when he stepped back and plastered on a smile. He was a big boy; he could handle it.
“No.” There was a loud rattling of chains and a scuffle of material and Tony winced at the noise. “Tony, no.”
“Sit here!” Peter seemed to reach the same conclusion and he grinned wider, patting the seat by the aisle. “Please?”
“God bless that woman,” Steve murmured as he hurried to obey. He never could resist anything sweet, unlike Tony. “Is she ever going to come and live here permanently?”
“Oh, no – I…” Tony was cut off by something very close to a squeal and Peter was suddenly at his leg, pressed close.
Tony cut himself off with a sharp inhale and threw his head back. “Well. You were there when it fell through. I guess I thought me staying in the office longer and longer was making things easier. Stopping us from snapping at each other at home.”
Maybe because it was still there. A constant, when everything else had changed. Or moved on.
No one could have missed the way that Tony’s gaze flickered over to Peter and his eyes softened. “Yeah,” he murmured. “There are, I reckon. Even when you end up in a Christmas tree farm on a freezing cold Christmas Eve with a life-size elf and an owl in need of rescue.”
He just couldn’t afford it.
good. There’s so many!” Without much concentration, Peter lifted his hand to slot it into Tony’s, his gaze much more focused on the massive lot filled with trees literally as far as the eye could see. “Can we have one?”
“You idiot,” he said, ducking his head to press a lingering kiss to Tony’s ring – the cheap, shoddy ring that had been so cut-rate that there hadn’t even been a box for it. “I’m not changing my mind.”
“Oh, for the love of…” Taking a deep breath and letting it out slowly onto his ice-cold hands cupped in front of his face, Steve turned pleading eyes in Sam’s direction. “Don’t tell me that’s a customer.”
He’d put it off, knowing what he was going to find. And sure enough, there were countless messages, though luckily none of them had made it into the group chat.
“A – yes,” Tony said with another sigh and a wondering thought of how on earth his life had changed so much so quickly. “I’ll go get an elf.”
“Hey!” Tony’s eyes were closed even as a soft smile tugged at his lips. “You can’t. Can’t ask me first, I’ve already asked you. I think.”
With each new dawn, Steve had lost a little bit of hope. And then the anger had come. Being angry with Tony wasn’t a new feeling for Steve. It was a common occurrence, but he normally had the source of his anger awake and around to dispel the feelings enough to talk the whole thing through.
Tony’s mouth fell open as he took in the sight before him. The entire living room had been taken over, every flat surface covered with a flameless candle or a bunch of beautiful flowers. Tony’s gaze didn’t linger for long enough to work out what they were before he moved on to seek out the mastermind behind the operation.
Tony grinned. “Oh, yeah. Him, I mean. All it does is take me back to my youth – makes me feel like I’m on an acid trip.”
“I can’t, Peg. I’ll change it when I go out there if it’s been put through with me already, but I… no. We’ll just have to wait and see what happens.”
to not mutter something ridiculous about not ever being able to forget about Rhodey. It wasn’t likely, given that he was the only friend that Tony had ever had.
“He’s lovely.”
“I won’t be able to concentrate,” Steve said, voice pleading.
“Well,” Nurse Rogers said after a moment, “if that’s something that is really, deeply bothering you, doesn’t it tell you something?”
“I’m home now,” he said instead. It didn’t seem like much, but it was all he had left. It had to work. Because it was true. “If you want me to be.”
“There’s always another way,” Steve said instead, glaring at the wall above Tony’s head. It was what Steve needed. He was nearly there, nearly had it all out.
It was Steve’s turn to frown. “Atues?”
It wouldn’t be too long before Peter reached an age that he didn’t want any photos taken of him and Tony was already dreading the day. Any snaps he could grab before then were welcomed with open arms.
“I am, my angel,” May said, lifting a hand to brush Peter’s hair from his face. “Are you?”
“So, you really don’t remember anything?”
get this?”
Tony tutted. “That’s a bad deal.”
. That hadn’t been what Tony had wanted to hear. In fact, that had been the very last thing that Tony had ever wanted to be told. Nothing could have prepared him for the shiver that went down his spine at those few words, or the crushing pain that closed around his chest.
Laughing loudly as he danced away, Tony made to turn on his heel. Steve was too quick for him and his hand shot out, stopping Tony’s movements by wrapping his fingers around his arm.
Leaning forward minutely, Tony’s eyes fell shut and he let out a long breath. When he felt Steve relax, he clicked his tongue. “No.”
“The right shade of black?” Steve asked incredulously. “I have a hundred pieces of black material–”
“An elf!”
“What? Joking about what?”
“Nothing,” Tony hastened to say, waving his hand through the air. It was just a name, after all. “Just seems to be a common name these days.”
The kitchen was the heart of the home, after all.
“Absolutely not. You forget that this isn’t the first call I’ve had, late-night-Lothario.”
Steve’s head shot up, mouth open and eyes wide, before he caught sight of the wicked grin on Tony’s face and rolled his eyes, fighting off his own smile as he sank back down.
The man,
“You’re worth so much more than cheap tin, but it was all I could afford. I was waiting until I could get something more, well, something that wasn’t…
“What are you doing here?”
Galas could be boring – for recent college-graduate Tony, anyway – and he thought the businessman needed something to focus his attention on. If it made him hard and kept his gaze and mind on Tony all night instead of the trophy wives and bombshells walking around, then, well, that was just an added bonus. Not part of his plan at all.
“It’s too early to see too much,” Nurse Rogers teased, a smile in her voice as Tony was pulled back to reality. “Just a bit of a blob.”
They felt silent again as Tony let his eyes rake over every single cell of his baby’s form. He wanted to memorise everything, so that he would be able to work out all of the changes he could spot at the next scan.
The funeral was small, at least in comparison to others Tony had attended. That was another thing that didn’t make sense to Tony’s dazed mind. Jarvis was one of the best people Tony had ever met. There had been more people at the funeral of some Great-Uncle from Italy that Tony hadn’t ever seen outside of his own, bachelor-style apartment in New York than there were at Jarvis’s funeral. Why weren’t there more people mourning? Didn’t everyone know what a brilliant and wonderful man Jarvis had been?
Steve looked a little surprised, but it faded into a slow smile. “You’ve been hanging around with Buck too much, if you’re talking back like that.”
for the other man that he hadn’t felt in a very long time without him having to actually go and prove he was pretty close to perfect.
“Mr. Stark?”
“A ton! But then I woke up again and Philip was bored.”
, Rhodey would say with a grin. Whatever word he was, he certainly wasn’t the sort of person to stand by his phone and check it every three seconds in case he’d missed a notification.
“Like someone dropped a bus on me.”
“That!” Peter cried, reaching out to grab at Tony’s coat. “Did you hear it? Mr. Sam says it’s coming from the tree.”
Steve looked up with Tony with a soft smile. “You don’t mean that.”
Steve huffed a laugh, trailing his hand over Tony’s hip as he passed him. “Pretty sure that’s not a thing.”
“Incoming behind you.” He waited patiently and, once the threat had been eliminated, continued. “You can admit it now, alright? You have to know I don’t care.”
A human, breathing miniature adult that could have been a clone of Tony, so it – shit,
“Is it an all year round thing?” Tony continued. Steve was pretty sure it had started with a T and he looked more like a Tony than a Tyler. “Something of a fetish? Cause I’m not judging in the slightest if it is; I just want to know what I’m working with here.”
Tony had had a Christmas tree before. When he was ten. And it had been bought by a decorator who’d been hired for a
“I have school work,” he said as neutrally as he could. “And I go back right after New Year. I just thought you would be–”
Tony suddenly felt exposed. Though it was his shirt lying up round his shoulders and his swollen stomach on display, it felt like his whole chest had been cut open. Even knowing there was no way she could, Tony had the strangest feeling that his nurse could see right inside of him.
“You take care, Tony,” Nurse Rogers said and Tony’s heart thumped in his chest. God, it had been so long since he’d had someone actually seem to care about him, especially someone so wonderfully motherly. “I’ll be thinking about you.”
“Yes,” Tony rubbed his hands on his thighs and stood up. “Yes, that’s me.”
“That’s okay,” he said, bubbly and overexcited all the same. “I like hot chocolate however.”
It wasn’t even phrased as a question, but Sarah started to shake her head before Peggy had even gotten halfway through her statement.
Steve didn’t know why he was still staring, but he found he couldn’t look away. The two of them were so alike it was as if Tony had defied science and had a child all on his own. There was something special about seeing them together, about watching those brown eyes that had seduced Steve throughout a phone screen with a look of pure sex so soft and warm.
Steve could wait for that.
– was obviously Tony’s.
Every replay of the battle sparked the emotion a little more, each repeat of Tony’s actions stoke the flames higher and higher.
“Thanks, Rhodes. But there’s a bar in France with a lower drinking age than Massachusetts and it’s crying out to me.”
“Only two?” Nurse Rogers asked as she typed something into her computer.
Tones answer me. I’m going to kill him
. I can’t even remember what you said.”
Somehow, it already didn’t seem like long enough.
And that was so different to anything Tony had ever known. Tony was used to being a commodity, an afterthought. Even his own family treated him as an inconvenience more than a person.
“Business,” Steve answered, deciding that meeting Tony’s intense gaze was a lesser evil than staring at a dancing, green duck wearing dungarees. “Well, going home from business. I’m an architect and my firm wanted to survey some land. You?”
Peter’s mouth fell open at the insult, but he couldn’t find his voice to express his indignation.
“It is a big deal,” Steve protested, trying to catch Tony’s eye. “I should have been there for you. How did it go?”
“Uh, yeah, Romeo. Did you not hear the part about Nat not knowing how to pick guys and having to give out a fake number?”
With another loud groan and a childish kick of his legs, Tony reached for his phone and lifted it to his ear.
“I’d call that adding hot water to powder. But,” he added just as Tony started seething, “I will admit that you learnt well. Your hot chocolate is the best I’ve ever had.”
“We met some of your classmates at one point, I think. They were from your life-drawing class. Maria, maybe? And someone called Scott. There was a blonde girl, too. Shannon?”
Tony looked up from the pot and over to Peter, hovering in the doorway with his arms wrapped round himself. He looked young, so much younger than he was. “You’re meant to be resting.”
“I have to. Got to today.”
Scowling, Steve turned back to Peter. “What’s your favourite dino?”
The flight wasn’t that long. They’d already made it through at least half of the journey by sleeping.
The meeting was dragging on. And on. And on.
know. He had no idea that Tony missed him; that wasn’t a thought that he would ever let himself entertain. It hurt too much. It opened too many possibilities, too many hours put at risk where Steve was in real danger of doing very little but dreaming about Tony turning up on his doorstep and begging him to take him back.
There was a voicemail flashing on the landline when Steve returned home. Absentmindedly, he pressed the button to play the recording as he sorted through his mail, throwing some of the envelopes down into piles on the couch as he listened to his mother rambling on about something or other before finally confirming their dinner plans. Why the woman didn’t just text him like everyone else, Steve would never know.
“Thank you! Can I have one, Tony, please?”
“I don’t know. I think Andrew made reservations. I have to brush off my suit apparently.”
Peggy gasped loudly and walked into the room, closing the door behind her and leaning her whole body weight against it. “Tony? That was him?”
But that would never happen. Because Steve was dating Andrew.
“I will. I promise you, I will.” There was a beautiful urgency in Steve’s voice, a promise that Tony clung to even as the tendrils of permanent rest started to claw towards him. “But I don’t want to say it like this, not chained to a wall whilst you’re halfway to unconscious.”
But Steve knew that Tony would be mortified if he was in fact black out drunk and hadn’t meant to do any of it. If he’d known that he had rung Steve and spilt all of his secrets to an answering machine, then Tony would have hated himself.
Who would twirl Tony round in the kitchen whilst waiting for the kettle to boil? Who would drag him away from work and force him to eat and sleep?
Sarah nodded, though she knew it wasn’t convincing in the slightest. “That man, Pegs. That man is carrying my grandson.”
“No, there’s not,” Tony disagreed and Steve’s pulse picked up again, “and if it were anyone else sitting here, then – fuck!”
“Morning, Tony.”
“Yeah.” Sam nodded as he propped his axe up against a nearby tree and shot Tony a laden look.
Tony headed back out to the living room where Steve was sitting on the edge of the couch and putting his socks on, looking around gingerly for his shoes. Tony held out the water and pills and Steve took them with a grateful nod, swallowing the painkillers quickly and emptying the glass before sinking back into the couch cushions with closed eyes.
> He’s going to remember. I think Clint took pictures
“Even if you did try to poison me.”
Just walking, Tony could see signs for all sorts of different varieties. There were no-needle-drop ones, a Fir Christmas tree – which Tony had rather thought was every type of Christmas tree – and around seven different kinds of Spruce. Which was he meant to get? What even was the difference? In his opinion, a tree was a tree was a tree.
And he had. Though Tony had only been on her table for a short time, she’d been able to see what a wonderful man he was. Steve had clearly chosen someone perfect for him; kind, funny, caring, and so unbearably in love with him. After the break-up, Steve had closed himself off a little and refused to talk about what had happened between them. Sarah hadn’t been able to prise any details out of Steve, though she had watched for months as his smile dimmed and his shoulders grew steadily more slumped.
“What do you want?”
“Outside.” Steve pulled out the chair on the other side of the table to Tony. “I asked them to give us a moment. I wanted to talk.”
“You are such an asshole,” he muttered even as he chuckled, mopping up a few drops of coffee that had spilled out and lifting his fingers to his lips.
“Alright, Sam?” Peter’s legs kicked against Steve’s thighs as he drew up next to his friend and a small group of sanctuary workers. “What’s the situation?”
In fact, it was actually a good gig. It paid well, the hours were favourable, and he worked with some great people. Helped along by Steve liking both Christmas and children, it was pretty much his perfect role.
“Please stop worrying,” Steve whispered. “Replace the bit you shoved in my face and pop it in the oven. It’s going to be fine.”
Another round of silent nodding and Tony laughed, bending down to his grandchild’s level. Holding out his arms, he let his precious recipe book rest in the palm of his hands, ready for the taking.
Tony laughed as he swung his legs around until he was sitting on the edge of the table instead of lying back on it. “I don’t think Steve is capable of ever getting angry,” he said. “He’s far too kind for that. Especially not about this sort of thing.”
“You don’t sound all that upset,” Tony mused. He knew he wasn’t a patch on Natasha, but he did actually like the photo someone had taken of the two of them at Natasha’s last work gala. Maybe there was hope.
There would have been more teasing. It probably would have spilled over to the group chat as well, and then Bucky and Sam would have joined in when they’d put two and two together. Clint would send the photos that he’d taken of the two of them kissing, as dark and as grainy as they would be. Of course they’d have been stupidly unclear, but Tony would have chosen a favourite and made it his background, just to see Steve grin bashfully.
Peter whined. “Wanna see the owl, Tony, please. Don’t wanna go home yet.”
For his troubles, Tony got a stuffed bear to the face and he laughed. “You gotta wake up, kid. We’re going to land soon.”
“Tony–”
“I thought you wanted it.”
. Black Widow. Ma’am, I didn’t, I’m sorry, I–”
lie to James. His parents really did have a house in France and they spent every Thanksgiving there.
It was always the middle of the tree the drew Tony’s eye. To some people, it might have been very odd to have so many ornaments for parents, but it was their family. There were two gingerbread people holding hands with
“I don’t know that we have any marshmallows left,” Steve said apologetically but, even as Tony’s face dropped a little, Peter’s expression didn’t change.
“Aw, he’ll loosen up. It’s lots of changes for him to deal – ha!” Straightening up, Steve brandished a bag of marshmallows. “
“Mm!” With chocolate staining his lips, Peter grinned widely. “This is so good! Thanks, Steve.”
“Are they? That’s exciting.” Tony reached out and tapped Peter on the chin. Peter giggled and Steve couldn’t help but laugh himself.
“Appreciate it, Legolas.”
Dammit, but Natasha really did know how to pick them, Tony thought as he settled in to hear about book club.
“It’s not my place.”
“I never stopped loving you, Tony. I will never stop loving you. None of this was ever about that, I swear. It was – I don’t know what it was. I wanted you to have the freedom, wanted you to be able to–”
and had gotten lost in his own world. It was almost jarring to be pulled away from the screen of hot men and back into reality where the PA was screeching and there was noise everywhere.
“Philip the Fish?” he asked with a laugh, “very pleased to meet you.”
The weird thing was that it sort of had been. Tony never told anyone about Peter’s life. It wasn’t anyone else’s business and it wasn’t Tony’s place to spill Peter’s secrets to strangers. There just seemed to be something about Steve that made Tony want to talk.
Tony wasn’t so hot first thing in a morning so he just grunted some sort of greeting back at Steve’s cheerful grin.
a shame Peter isn’t awake, though.”
Nurse Rogers laughed too, and Tony didn’t pay enough attention to the sound to hear the strain there.
Hours passed. Somewhere along the way those hours had turned to days. There was no real routine of which to speak, no schedule of food and water being delivered to them. It couldn’t be followed, couldn’t be counted down to the next time that Tony’s throat would be wet with a small glass of desperately-needed water. Their phones had gone, watches and wallets stripped when they had been taken off the street. Time eluded them.
“And speaking of,” she said, “the picture is formed. Are you ready to see your baby?”
“It’s a type of owl,” Steve said with a smile. “A once-rare one, apparently. The crew said it’s sitting pretty near the top, but right back against trunk, so they can’t just reach in and get it out. They can’t risk it flying off, or something.”
“Sorry, Pete, but remember your manners, please,” Tony said with an eyebrow raised in a way that Steve really shouldn’t have found hot.
Adjusting to the difference, Steve frowned. Wait, he knew that face. Oh,
The man, Sam, turned and his whole face lit up when he noticed Peter, who had slipped right into his space with interest very clear on his face.
“Wow.”
“That about sums it up,” Tony said on a slight chuckle. He ran his hand over his face and his laugh grew stronger. “You’re not an asshole at all, are you?”
“He’s a firefighter.” Tony wished he could stop talking, but he couldn’t. He hadn’t spoken about Steve for a while and it appeared that it had been building up inside of him. “It’s a dangerous job and it used to make me a bit crazy. Still does. We haven’t spoken for about four weeks, but I can’t stop listening to the scanners. He used to tell me not to do that when we were together, you know? I’d lie in his bed when he went out, or I’d be at home and hear something and I’d text him. Probably a bit too frantically, but I.” Tony coughed and flicked away a stray drop of gel from his jeans. “Didn’t want him hurt.”
“That was kind of her.”
As stupid as the question was, Tony found that he couldn’t roll his eyes. Nurse Rogers was just too
Especially not when he was left alone in a scarily large house with not a single decoration to be seen.  Not that anyone knew where they were kept. Without Jarvis there to fetch them out of hiding and take charge of putting them up, the Stark mansion stayed in its own, festive-less bubble.
“Yeah,” Tony said, praying that his voice didn’t sound as strained as it felt. “I’m sure. He seemed to have his phone out every time I looked at him.”
Steve snorted a small and shaky laugh. “It is. Very.” There was a short pause, the room filled only with Tony’s heavy breathing and the rustling of material. “Are you?”
But that would mean admitting the truth, and Starks always kept their heads high. Even if
Tony sniffed and looked over to the wall again, re-reading the poster of child CPR. He was only a few months pregnant and he could feel the changes in his emotions and his willingness to share already. It was going to be a long road ahead. Tony wasn’t sure he was ready for that side of things.
“Yes,” Nurse Rogers said, voice impossibly gentle. “Just like mine.”
Steve laughed affectionately. “I wouldn’t class warming up leftovers and ordering pizza as cooking, sweetheart.”
Steve sighed and Tony hated the way that it made him feel. He no longer had the rights to cross the room and soothe Steve’s tense shoulders with soft touches and a gentle kiss. “I – you pulled away. You stopped coming to bed, stopped talking to me. What was I supposed to think?”
It took all of Tony’s willpower and continuing desperation to be seen as
Rolling onto his side, Tony tucked his free hand under his head and bit back a yawn. “It’s a thing we do. Nat isn’t exactly good with guys. No exactly about it, actually, she’s the worst at picking men.” And that included all of Tony’s bad decisions - and he’d made a lot of them in his college youth. And his adulthood, for that matter.
Tony had been taught that sad fact from an early age. As a scientist, his father had told him to question everything and to always expect an explosion. It didn’t seem possible that Christmas was going to be this unbelievable, amazing time filled with love and laughter and overindulgence where nothing could ever go wrong and nobody was ever anything but happy.
It was stupid, really. Tony had always told himself that he was strong. Independent.
He had put up a little bit of tinsel by the door and there was a garland over the fireplace, but, Peter was right.
“Oh,” Tony said, quirking a smile and shifting his son –
Tony snorted. His heart started to beat wildly in his chest and he could feel a flush already rising. Even with bed hair, bags under his eyes, and a pillow crease down his cheek, Steve was still the most beautiful man Tony had ever seen. “Yeah. You look like it.”
Peter giggled behind his hand, but gave Steve a contrite look. “I’m sorry, Steve. Want me to teach you about dinos?”
Most days.
“Wait, what?”
Maybe buying a tree on Christmas Eve wasn’t such a good idea. Peter seemed happy enough in his car seat as Tony drove from lot to lot, the little boy singing the parts of the Christmas songs on the radio that he knew and making his new stuffed snowman dance to the bits he didn’t.
“–I wanted to speak about–”
Starks didn’t give up. Once they had a plan, they stuck to it. It was, after all, how Tony’s father had made his business and that had been one of the only decent life lessons Tony had ever learnt from his dad. But, even if it was in him to be a quitter, he had told his son that he was getting a tree for Christmas. There was no world in which Tony was going to let Peter down if he could do anything about it.
Except, that was exactly what he was doing.
Steve sunk his teeth into his lower lip, trying to focus on the slight sting of that instead of the lump growing in his throat. He tried to placate himself with the thought that Tony might ring back. That would be better in the long run; if Tony remembered what he had done and what he’d said on the phone and rang back to tell Steve that it
No demands had been made to them personally; no requests for bomb designs, no explicit threats, or even promises of release after payment. There’d been no contact and Tony and Steve had nearly driven themselves mad trying to think of what they were being held for.
Sarah watched the young man walk out of her examination room, his hands tightly clutching a stack of pamphlets to his chest as though they were a lifeline. He’d been a lovely man. Clearly scared, but also determined to do things right.
“A bedtime story? I hear those help people sleep.”
The bed creaked as Tony rolled himself onto his stomach, holding his left hand up in front of his face.
“Good,” Steve said, his voice shaky. He hated it. Hated hospitals, hated nurses, hated seeing his husband in pain. He didn’t want to be there anymore; he wanted to be at home, in their own bed, with no bandages that needed changing and no visitor hours to adhere to. Why should he be told how much time he could spend with the man he loved? Whether Tony was awake or not, Steve had wanted to be there with him. “That’s how I like it.”
“But I love you.” Steve’s voice was husky as sleep pulled him back under. “Wouldn’t ever want anyone else.”
He didn’t find a decent cup of coffee. He found a mediocre takeaway cup of tea, lukewarm and far too milky, but it gave him something to focus on as he sat in the reception area of the office building and tried to resist the urge to run.
“One day, I think I’ll invest in a scientific research project and find out what the hell I was thinking when I married you.”
But what if Steve was meant to ring back? He let out a loud groan and threw his hands up, heels digging into his eyes hard enough to see swirling patterns of random colours. Why was everything so damn hard?
He hadn’t seen the outside of the medical centre for days. Maybe even a week. He’d stopped counting when they’d made it to three days and Tony hadn’t woken up. Bucky had been in with clean clothes and Steve had managed to have washes in the sinks of the bathroom. It wasn’t ideal, but there was no way on any earth that Steve was taking a single step towards the exit without his husband’s hand in his.
“On your left, dad,” Peter said into the comms, eyes focused intently on the battle playing out in front of him. Recovering from a leg injury in their last fight, Peter had volunteered to be their eyes and ears from the Tower, hanging back and hacking into CCTV cameras with SHIELD agents.
“Nah, it’s alright Tones.” The bed dipped next to Tony and an arm snaked around his shoulders, a strong body warm next to his. “I can hang out here for a bit. We don’t want to miss anything, do we.”
“Alright. Don’t move, okay? Sit right there until Daddy comes back.”
“Tony–” Steve didn’t know exactly where that had been going, but he had to say something.
Sam laughed loudly, the sound carrying over Bing Crosby’s crooning. “Go in, you daft prick. I’ll shout you out if someone turns up.”
And he got told that a lot. It wasn’t rare for his daddy to go for days without seeing him because he was stuck in meetings or out on a business trip in some country Tony couldn’t pronounce. Sometimes it was even weeks, and there was a big time difference that meant Tony would be tucked up in bed and fast asleep before it would be finishing time at his daddy’s work. That’s what Jarvis always said, anyway, and why would Tony not listen to Jarvis?
“Of course I love you.”
It wasn’t exactly a compliment, but Tony let it placate him. For a moment, anyway. It was Christmas, after all. “Dick.”
Once he was in the air, he told himself, he’d have forgotten all about it.
“Yes,” Steve finally breathed out.
“It’s fine, kid. Anytime.”
“Nuh uh,” Peter said, his attention on his toy again. “I’ma stay here.”
“It was its home, I think,” Tony said with a panicked look to Steve. He’d have thought Peter would have been all over it, bursting with questions and interest. “Owls like forests and woodlands, sometimes, so I guess he thought it would be nice and cosy away from the snow.”
Finally, the door flew opened and a nurse bustled in. They must have made a sight, with Tony bent at a hideously awkward angle and moaning in pain, Steve twisted around him, and blood on the sheets below them.
Tony met Steve’s smile. “We have the battle often, on a plane or at home. I’d say I win around 50 per cent of the time.”
“–so that’s why Ned isn’t allowed into the theatre practice room anymore,” Peter said in-between bites of a pecan and chocolate chip cookie. “So we can’t go in to see Madison when she’s in there. We have to meet in the math rooms.”
“I should be here.”
Steve felt his cheeks flush. He didn’t like kids, his brain shouted again, he didn’t understand them. “Don’t kids like everyone?”
Steve had spent a week at Tony’s bedside watching nurses and doctors change tubes and fill out charts. He’d learnt more about the human body’s inside workings than he had as a child in and out of hospital and even growing up with a nurse for a mother. Steve had spent hours begging Tony to wake up and come back to him. He’d cried for days on end, had prayed to any God he had ever heard of for his husband just to open his eyes.
As he’d gotten older and his book had gotten fuller, Tony had carefully moved it from journal to journal, cutting out pages and sticking them back into the next edition with slight amendments or scribbled changes to quantities. It was his pride and joy.
It was a chaotic, unplanned mess, but it was a better Christmas than Tony had had for years. Though it probably wouldn’t have done for anyone else, it was Christmas enough for Tony.
“Oh, Pete.” There was a kiss dropped to Peter’s hair and another hand curled over his shoulder. “I’m still here, kid. Both of us. Me and Steve, okay? Still here. Always here.”
“It’s the least I can do after you rang the animal rescue and got them out here so fast. I wouldn’t have had a clue what to do if it had been me.”
“Of course it is. We need to let Tony see that for himself.”
Tony snorted at Steve’s voice from behind him. “Since he’s been mine, I’m pretty sure.”
It wasn’t until he walked into his living room that he stopped short and his brain seemed to wake up a little.
Relaxing, Tony shoved his hands into his pockets. “Yeah,” he belatedly said to Steve’s statement. “He just lost his parents. Well, his biological mom and step-dad, but they were his parents. I’m his biological dad, but I only found out about him after the accident. I’m a pretty poor replacement.”
“I can call you whatever I want. It’s my right.”
“Gym,” Natasha said, throwing a thumb over her shoulder to show where she wanted Peter to go. “Spar session. You’re ten minutes late.”
“Nat’s texted,” Tony said, feeling as confused as Steve sounded as he read the text a few times.
“We did.” Steve made no move to step closer to Tony, even as he dropped his bouquet down a little and held out his hand. “But I decided that I didn’t want to wait that long. Besides, tomorrow isn’t our anniversary.”
“Why, thank you, darling. You’re not badly-sized yourself.”
“That’s a shame,” Steve said, winking at Tony. “I was thinking of getting some breakfast when we’ve landed. It’s still breakfast time, right?”
Even though they’d been in their agreement for well over a year and Tony had lost count of the times that Steve had dressed him in a perfectly-fitted suit, Tony still liked the fact that he clearly managed to take Steve’s breath away. Especially when Steve was so stubborn about keeping their relationship professional.
His answer was a kissing sound followed by a dial tone. He let the phone fall from his hand, watching it swing from its long chord instead of replacing it in its cradle. It wasn’t as though she would call again anyway, and Tony didn’t feel like speaking to anyone else. It would be quiet through to New Year.
Steve’s mouth dropped open and Tony’s smirk only grew. He lifted them a little higher, right in front of Steve’s face.
“Yes, you scrub up well,” Steve continued, eyes raking over Tony from head to toe. “You look amazing, sweetheart. I told you that suit would look incredible.”
Steve looked up to see Tony peering over the back of his seat, a pillow crease on his left cheek and eyes a little hazy with sleep.
There was a sigh and Peter waited with baited breath as he fired a couple of codes down to Clint and Natasha and watched them perform a sharp turn to find the new destination. Hopefully they would locate the source quickly and they could all move on to more pressing matters; namely getting Steve and Tony to stop being so goddamn oblivious.
Tony huffed out a humourless laugh. If things had been reversed, if he’d woken up in a different world, then he would have loved those texts. He’d have turned over to smother his laughs into Steve’s chest, typing out a cheeky and suggestive message just to see Steve’s cheeks flush a bright red as he would try and wrestle the phone away.
Without Tony there to talk to, Steve had no outlet. His anger only strengthened with each passing hour.
Peter gasped. “Can we?” He turned to Tony with wide eyes. Oh, God. Tony was a goner for whatever words were about to leave Peter’s mouth and he knew it before they were spoken. “Oh, please, Tony! Would be so much fun.”
Tony averted his eyes so he missed the flicker of disappointment across Steve’s face.
Tony laughed and pressed a kiss to the very corner of Steve’s mouth, finally stepping out of his hold and making a big show of inspecting the panties still in his hand. “Of course I am,” he said, as though it were the simplest thing in the world. “Isn’t that exactly why you chose me?”
Despite Rhodey’s warnings and Tony’s inexperience, one thing had very quickly led to another between Ty and Tony.
“Yes. Sorry, Tony. I don’t know what – well. Let’s find baby again, shall we? Oh, here we go.”
Sam pressed his lips together, eyes shining with amusement. “Sorry, Steve. Looks like Santa needs a helper for just thirty minutes more.”
“I’m old—”
“Mind if I sit here for a moment? I’ve been walking for hours and now I’m hungry. I heard the stream so I thought I could have some water. Is that okay?”
So, apparently, Steve cared about him. But not enough to talk to him? Touch him unless it’s life threatening? Tell him about the little things that he seemed to freely offer the others? To do things for him to show he care? He knew that last one was a lie as soon as the thought came to him. Because Steve was doing things for him. He was just too stubborn and arrogant to notice.
“That’s not true. In fact, haven’t I been listening to you more?”
He wracked his brain for anything Steve might have done or given to him and he couldn’t think of any. Well, there was the ever-ready pot of coffee he’d find in the morning after he emerged from his workshop after endless hours of work, which only Steve could have prepared because he’s the only one awake at such an ungodly hour. But that was more for everyone (not for Steve cause he doesn’t drink any). Or when Steve initiates unauthorized lockdowns of his lab, apparently authorized by Pepper, whenever he’s been in there for more than 48 hours straight, but that’s mostly because of Pepper. So yeah, nothing for him.
And then he was gone to talk to Nat about whatever it is they always talk about. He thought about what luck he had that day!
“I just want to fix things. Please, let me.”
“I told you I’m fine.”
“If you change your mind, you know where to find me,” he said before walking out of the workshop, leaving him alone. When he was gone, he slumped on his chair and let out a big, fat, sigh.
“Say what?”
He couldn’t see but he knew the guy behind the door paled. He could hear the pounding of his heart in his chest and he could smell the panic about to bubble out of him. So, he turned to his side and willed himself to sleep. It was easy. He was out in seconds. Nothing would wake him up, not until he wants to wake up, effectively ending the conversation.
Which, if he was being honest, only made his head hurt. Because he wanted to get away from Steve. But he is also ravishing the attention he’s being showered right now.
. But instead he found himself safely tucked in Cap’s arms, his shield both around them, and the nuke hitting vibranium and exploding, debris miraculously missing both of them as they made a dashing freefall from 4,000 feet, until they hit the ground, himself still tucked safely in Cap’s arms, despite him being covered in metal, and Cap absorbing most of the impact.
“You’re not even going to ask why I’m here?” he could hear the plea.
Steve was there. He was there and no one knew. No alarms have been tripped. No signs. Friday hadn’t alerted him, which would mean he found a way to avoid Friday? His head feels like it’s about to explode. Steve was there and he didn’t know. How?
He’s not really sure when or how it started. All he knows is that somehow, thoughts of Steve have started occupying his mind more and more. Thoughts of him lying down on the couch in his workshop, getting lost in whatever he’s doing at the moment—sometimes he’s sketching, other times he’s working on something on his laptop, the one he gave him. Thoughts of Steve handing him a steaming hot cup of coffee, early in the morning, upon emerging from working for days. Thoughts of their playful banter as Steve strips out of his uniform, unmindful of his injuries because he knows they’re already healing while the rest of them mortals have to grunt and cry in pain and embarrassment for being fragile and breakable.
“I tried really hard to not, but it’s you and who could resist falling in love with you?”
It was easy to mistake this girl as harmless. But the toned muscles on her arms, the calculated movement she makes, even under duress, and the depth of her eyes are all familiar tells of a fighter.
“Can’t you at least tell me what it is?” Steve grinned and wrinkled his eyebrow at him in that disarmingly charming way of his, not really aware of the turmoil he’s going through at the moment. And he couldn’t—no way he could lie to him if he pushed this any further.
He didn’t know what to do with the information.
Again, the little shit.
“Every time I look at you, all I can see is brains—exploding.”
“Is it about the team?”
“Do you know who that is?” gesturing towards him.
He watched as the frown deepened on Steve’s face.
“C-captain America,” her voice was raw from perhaps screaming earlier.
Bucky was lucky because he had him. He had someone to pull him out of that darkness. To assure him he is nothing but a victim as well. To tell him he is worth saving.
Everyone assumed Steve didn’t fully understand this century, but he knew the truth. He knew that Steve has surprisingly learned (and understood cause that’s important) technology quickly and efficiently. He just doesn’t like it. He doesn’t like that no one had privacy anymore. That had always been his main complaint.
Really, their tree didn’t need anything else adding to it as half of its branches were already close to snapping clean off, but Tony hadn’t been able to resist. He’d seen it the year after they’d met Steve, in the middle of October in
i didn’t need to see that
“I said I was going to be working late.” The words leaving his mouth felt distant, sounded quiet. All of Tony’s focus was on the fact that his apartment had been turned into a scene from a cheesy rom-com. And that it wasn’t even as an apology. “We agreed we’d meet tomorrow.”
“Blue,” Tony answered immediately. He didn’t need to think about that, not for a second. It was all he’d imagined since the first time he’d hunched over the toilet and thrown up his breakfast. A tiny bundle with bright blue eyes, that’s what he wanted. “Steve’s were blue. That’s the dominant one, right? God, I hope so.”
Focaccia took a long time to knead and for the rising process to get done perfectly, but spending that long watching over it in the kitchen meant that Peter could sit at the breakfast bar to finish his homework and not be alone.
“Just the usual group night out. There were too many shots, too much dancing and far too much food. Sam got wasted and crashed pretty early. Bucky drew all over his face – I’m pretty sure it was in Sharpie, so it’ll probably still be on him this morning.”
Tony swallowed and did his best to ignore the way his heart sank to his toes. Instead, he rolled his eyes and made his voice as disinterested as he could. “Yes, I’m aware. Which is why you should be with Andy.”
He heard Tony chuckle. “Don’t let Peter hear that. Although I doubt he’d go for that, actually. He’s far too sweet.”
“Oh, no.” Tony shot a faux-upset look towards Peter before grinning at Tash, “sorry, but these cookies just aren’t going to bake themselves, now, are they? Pete’s good for the job, though. Practical experience and all that.”
“This one!”
Peter blinked up at Steve before he nodded.
“No, Tony. The team will come and we’ll get out of here. As soon as we do, I’ll go to your workshop and get the ring from the desk drawer you never bother looking in, even when you say you check there whenever you can’t find things. And once I’ve got that, I’ll ask you.” There was a loud sniff and then Steve’s voice started again, thicker than before but just as beautiful to Tony’s clouded brain. “There’ll be flowers and chocolate and champagne and so much romance that you won’t know what hit you.”
He was rewarded with a high-pitched squeal, which gave way to a wonderful laugh that Tony hadn’t heard since he’d picked his son up.
“Welcome!” Peter chirped happily. Turning back to Tony, Peter shook his head. “No more, thank you. I wanna colour.”
At some point, Peter had shuffled into Tony’s lap completely, the little boy lost again to a heavy sleep. With his hands clutching Philip to his chest and his head buried in Tony’s sweater, he was the picture of innocence. Tony was holding him to his body easily and Steve felt his stomach swoop, mouth suddenly dry.
With a loud and final laugh, because of
There was a beat of silence and Tony knew he was only a hair’s width away from winning.
Steve flushed and looked back to the small TV screen where names were still rolling. He felt a little awkward, as though he should have gone back to his assigned seat. Right up until he’d finally succumbed to more sleep, Peter had had a hand on Steve’s leg and, despite the boy not knowing if he was still there or not, Steve felt a strange sort of loyalty to stay right where Peter had asked him to be.
“Awesome,” Steve said. He smiled at Peter, loving the warm weight against his cold chest. “Best seat in the house, there. Happy to stay?”
“He’s… quiet.”
And yeah, okay, it wasn’t like he’d actually meant it, but he’d still said it. His dad had still heard those words and thought he’d meant it.
Tony grinned and looked back at Steve. “Corruption. Peer pressure, I think you could call it.”
The grin he got in return was wonderfully happy and free in a way Tony hadn’t seen anyone look for a long time. Ducking his head, he took another sip of his hot chocolate. He usually hated sweet drinks, but Steve could make a mean mug of coco, clearly.
“As soon as he smells those pancakes, he’ll be wide awake,” Tony said with a grin. It faltered a little and he cocked his head. “If you were serious, that is.”
Peter was watching intently, zooming in as close as he could from every possible angle. He was now almost sure that they’d met them in a previous battle. As it was his job to come up with a way to take down the enemy quickly, Peter quickly made his sole focus on that task instead.
Tony opened his mouth and promptly closed it, all semblance of thought leaving him. His head was spinning and he really wasn’t sure if any of it was real.
“And an Aunt May,” Tony finally cut in. He would be forever thankful for the woman who took Peter in before he was found, no matter how much he wished Peter could have gone straight to him. Any owl that had an Aunt May would be set for life, he knew that much. “But if he doesn’t go with them, then they won’t be able to find him a family, will they?”
“A star?” Tony let go of Peter’s hand and placed his bag on the floor before he grabbed an unsuspecting Peter under the armpits and threw him onto his shoulders. “What do I need a star for? You’re tiny – you can fit on my tree!”
“I – are you… I don’t, don’t.” Peter was stumped. His fingers started tapping out commands and coordinates almost on autopilot as he sat in shock. There was another small explosion and the sounds of hand-to-hand combat filled his ears. It was a weird sort of symphony; one that would never sell out concert halls, but was oddly comforting to Peter all the same. “Okay. Maybe this isn’t the best time to have this conversation.”
And that was an answer in itself. Tony let his head fall back once more, giving in to his protesting muscles as they screamed out for rest.
“Tlanta. With the fishes. Like this one.” To punctuate his point, Peter thrust his stuffed fish towards Steve, his chubby fingers tight on its fins. It was a cute thing, really, all bright fluff and sparkling plastic eyes, even if it didn’t help Steve narrow down where Peter was talking about.
“A Santa elf?” he whispered, awe coating his words.
Peter sniffed again and a fresh wave of tears fell from his eyes. “Is he going to be okay?”
It was as though the world stopped turning with Steve’s hushed words. The entire room shrank down, white noise rushing in Tony’s ears. He didn’t know what he’d been expecting Steve to say, but it hadn’t been that.
“Well,” Tony started casually, stamping down on the fist around his heart and the lump in his throat, “there was the naked dancing on the bar top.”
“Hey, sweetheart.”
♡♥♥♥♥
“Is he on his own?”
“Annoying May, I think,” Steve said, though the fondness in his voice gave away the fact that Peter could never have annoyed any of them. He had them all wrapped right around his little finger.
“Holy shit,” Tony said, words breathless but dripping with agony. “I can’t do this, Steve. I’m sorry; I’m so sorry.”
Steve rolled his eyes at that; of course Steve knew who it was. Like he could ever forget Tony, the stupid, insecure man. That very voice coloured nearly all of Steve’s dreams.
Oh. Whoops. Steve truly was shit with kids. He felt his blush return with a vengeance and mumbled an apology, fingers tightening on the laminated paper in his lap. How many times could he embarrass himself in front of one man?
Well, Tony thought sullenly, that and the best night of his whole life.
“He’s a good kid.”
“No,” Peter pouted.
“Hi.”
“We don’t hafta get a tree. It’s okay. It’s still Christmas without one.”
Peter swallowed, lifting his eyes to meet his dad’s. Even bruised and cut, Tony’s face was as open and as soft as it had been when Peter used to seek him out after nightmares.
“–you
“Oh,” Steve said quietly. “Hence getting a tree on Christmas Eve.”
Even as Tony did his best to peel Peter away from his body so that he could bend down and pick him up, Peter shook his head and wrapped his arms around Tony’s thighs even tighter.
Tony let out a deep breath as he looked at the tree. Though the sort of tree Peter chose each year varied, their decorations had never changed too much. There was the star that Steve and Peter had made together on their very first Christmas as a family, the bauble with their wedding date engraved on the front, the reindeer holding a plaque with Peter’s name on it, and the handmade glass ornaments that May had brought back from her holiday to Egypt.
Tony jumped into action, reaching into his bag to pull out a book and a set of crayons and unclipping the tray from the seat in front of Peter’s chair. Next to him, Peter started to bounce in his seat.
There would be kisses, tears, desperate hugs where Steve would let out a shaky breath saying how much he’d missed Tony and Tony would give him an equally trembling promise of never doing it again.
His fingers literally itched to pick up the phone. The words that he would say to Tony were already burning on the tip of his tongue, just as they had been for months.
“But I’m thirsty.” Then came the puppy dog eyes, the bottom lip pushed out in a deep pout. “And you should have made me one in the first place.”
he mouthed, hoping that that went someway to summing up everything Steve had done for him in such a short period.
Keeping his eyes on Steve, Tony lowered himself into the armchair opposite the couch.
“Morning, trouble. Did you get any sleep at all?” Tony ran a hand over Peter’s hair as an unfairly attractive smile spread over his face.
“Oh, it is, is it?” Depositing the bowl of fresh whipped cream on the counter by Tony’s elbow, Steve crowded Tony back against the side.
. After so many days of watching a still and lifeless Tony and trying to battle his own head telling him that he would never see that smile again, Steve could have cried with happiness.
“No.” It was a snap and Tony took a breath, trying to calm down. “Fuck, Steve, I don’t want this. I don’t want any of this so I’m not sitting in a meeting listening to you divide our entire life and tear my house apart. Just take whatever you want and sign it away.”
“That’s me.” Steve didn’t sound in the least bit concerned and Tony huffed out another laugh, pressing a kiss to his collarbone.
Steve was saying something back, but Peter only managed to catch a few words here and there, brain too focused elsewhere and lack of sleep affecting him.
He looked desperately sad and, for some reason, Steve didn’t want him to be. “Have you ever been on a plane before?”
when talking about Tony’s place. “Alright, alright. But it’s a bath as soon as we get home, okay? No arguments. Jammies on before tree decorating.”
“Nat? Who the fuck is this?”
Steve was startled out of his thoughts when Peter’s voice called out to him. When Steve looked down from Tony’s retreating figure, he could only see part of Peter’s face, his little nose and mouth squished between his seat and Tony’s.
To be fair to the guy, Natasha had the sort of personality that drew everyone in and she knew how to make use of her sultry gaze, always making whoever she was talking to feel as though they were the centre of the universe; for better or for worse.
“And if they don’t?”
“Personally,” Tony continued, pointing at the empty takeaway boxes on the coffee table between them, “I just don’t think you wanted to share your pizza with him.”
Steve didn’t do kids. He never had. They were confusing and loud and Steve always felt on edge when he spoke to them, like either they or their parents were judging him. They were also so small. Steve towered above his friends on any regular day, so he felt like a giant when he was next to small children.
He’d looked almost familiar, as well, as soon as he’d walked in. Everything he had said had seemed to strike a chord somewhere inside of her and she felt as though she knew him.
“I’ll call the nurse, alright? Let me just–,” Steve quickly reached for the button at the side of the bed, pressing it frantically to alert someone at the Nurses desk that they needed help. “I’ve got you.”
Steve snorted as he opened the front door. “Best hangover cure, right?”
♡♡♡♥♥
Pulling on a baggy sweatshirt that he didn’t think was his but that had a modestly-high neckline, Tony wandered out of the kitchen and into the living room. Hearing his houseguest moving around, he paused in the doorway and watched as Steve woke up slowly, his face scrunched up against the bright lighting in the living room. When Steve pushed himself up into a sitting position and caught sight of Tony standing in the doorway, he grimaced.
Not that he had any idea whether or not it was Tuesday. He was pretty sure it had been a Wednesday when they’d been taken. The memories were hard to keep straight in Tony’s tired and confused mind, but he’d though they’d been jumped as they were leaving their coffee shop.
“Can I come next Christmas?”
“What grade–”
“Shush, Tony, no.” Carding his hand through Tony’s hair, Steve held Tony’s face against his neck. He never wanted to see Tony in pain ever again, but it wasn’t the time or the place to bring it up. That was the price one paid when they had a moral compass as large and as honourable as Tony. Sometimes, they got hurt. “You don’t need to be sorry. I’m the one that should be sorry. You did the right thing, sweetheart. You know you did – and I’m so proud of you.”
There was a soft laugh before a cough.
“And,” Tony continued, twisting his fingers through the hairs at Steve’s nape, “you should take a better look at my pocket-square.”
In his defence, Tony had expected to be alone for Christmas. Well, alone with a bottle or two of something and the extremely-precariously-leaning tower of paperwork that Pepper had left for him.
Tony softened his smile when Steve looked back at him, flushed red from head to toe, and gave a small shrug, obviously mindful of the boy sleeping on his chest.
I had some. Want any?”
Peggy smiled at her, nose scrunched up, and Sarah laughed a little as she returned the expression.
“He’s a
“You had someone, though,” Tony said, turning away again to read – but not absorb – a poster about the important of washing one’s hands after an injection. “You weren’t alone.”
“Well. That’s good.”
It wasn’t even that Andrew was a bad guy. It was just that he wasn’t Tony and therefore he shouldn’t be touching Steve in any way.
“Hey! How come he’s allowed the red?” Tony asked, setting the book down on Peter’s tray. “I never get allowed to use the red.”
“Mm. I leave most of the boring stuff to the board and a few directors, but there’s still lots of fiddly bits that I’m needed for once in a while.”
Without saying anything in response to that, Tony pushed himself from the door frame and headed into the kitchen. He grabbed a glass from the cupboard to fill with water and shook three Advil from the pill bottle – Steve would definitely need three after the night that he had. Apparently, he’d been even worse than they’d thought.
Tony laughed, even as his heart clenched. He didn’t think that sounded so bad, really, nor all that different to what Tony and Steve had got him to open the day after. “I am sort of tempted to drop a bit of whiskey in this mug, can’t lie.”
“Don’t be sorry, darling. Are you sure you’re alright?”
But it didn’t.
A snort from his left drew his attention from the small screen and he turned to see Tony’s face full of amusement.
Tony had stopped listening long ago, almost right at the beginning. He’d made up his mind as soon as Steve had presented him with papers. He would give Steve everything. Tony wasn’t going to fight. Steve could have it all. Without question.
“I don’t think so.” Steve scratched his stomach and rolled his neck, drawing Tony’s eyes to his body, flickering between the two spots as he tried to take in as much as he could. “Not even sure how I got back here.”
“He’s the best. But he doesn’t always do well with new people. He gets shy.”
To Steve’s mind, California was not that far away at all and Steve had been more than prepared to suggest the long distance thing as soon as the word Sacramento left Tony’s mouth, but apparently Tony had already decided that that wasn’t what they were going to do. Nope, he had just cut and run.
“Are those–”
Not Tony.
Peter closed his eyes and pressed closer to Tony. It wasn’t okay. Things weren’t magically okay, but with Tony’s arm circling on his back, his chest moving underneath Peter’s cheek with each deep breath, and Steve’s hand warm on his shoulder, it was at least finally easy to breathe.
“Wow,” he said, voice breaking on the short words. “That’s…”
“Yes.”
“Love you too. So please, Steve, marry me.”
“No harm done.” Tony’s smile felt like plastic and his voice sounded nothing like his. He wanted to be sick, quite frankly, and he hated the feeling. “Where are you going?” Not that Tony cared, but even he could be polite when it was called for. Or when he needed a mask to hide behind.
The laugh that Tony let out was loud and bright, far too much for the early hour. He buried his face in Steve’s chest as he continued to chuckle, feeling Steve’s body shaking beneath him with his own amusement.
Things were already feeling a little different, though. It might have been the bruises on the column of his throat, or the small spring in his step.
Most weeks, they just had a simple meal and a catch up. A simple meal and a catch up that was often attended by Steve.
“Dad, tell me you’re joking. Please. Please tell me you aren’t serious.”
Tony’s attention was obviously still on Peter as well, but he held up a finger to Steve. “I should probably warn you that I’ve never made hot chocolate before. Don’t think I’ve ever drank it before, actually.”
The smell of yeast and the uncooked dough turned Tony’s stomach as he’d gotten older, but there was nothing better than the scent the bread produced when it started to bake. Fresh rosemary only added to that, or maybe even a few cloves of garlic mixed in with the dough.
“Come on, Da! May’s chosen
“No, no,” Tony cut in quickly, swallowing harshly and shaking his head. “No, that’s fine. Of course that’s fine. Go out with your boyfriend – I’ve been putting off my work for far too long anyway. God knows I don’t need any more distractions.”
But none of that would happen. Because life didn’t always work out as it had been planned and things didn’t always go the way that people wanted. Instead, Tony took a deep breath and opened a new group chat, quickly picking out a handful of people that he hoped he could trust to dampen the wildfire of the rumour mill.
,” Tony continued and Steve slid his hands under his thighs to stop himself from reaching out for the phone. He didn’t know if he would delete the recording or press redial.
It was an affront to the meal. His Mama would kill him if she knew how he was preparing it.
“I – Pete, that’s…”
“Mhm.” Tony looked down and pretended that he was concentrating deeply on deciding what band t-shirts he should throw in his duffle. “Dad’s got some big country estate there. They don’t even celebrate Thanksgiving in Europe, but it’s something of a tradition.”
Suddenly, Steve reached out and drew a line across Peter’s forehead. Peter’s nose scrunched and he frowned in a way that made Steve lose his train of thought for a moment before Tony made a soft noise of confusion.
“I – he’s a kid.” Steve wasn’t a complete idiot. Hell, that was half the reason he didn’t like kids in the first place. But surely, there were good times? Someone must have thought that the benefits outweighed the bad things. Tony certainly did. And Steve, with a weird sort of warmth in his stomach, – a hint of nausea, too – thought that he could see why. “That comes with the territory, surely?”
“Here!” Peter called out from the next row over. “This one.”
Though the coffee in the cafeteria was vile, Steve had lived on virtually it alone for days. He stared down at the takeaway cup in his hands, missing the warmth that it had provided as it cooled rapidly, making it even more undrinkable than it had been before. It was some time past midnight, or so the shopping channels told him.
Tony’s hand spasmed around Steve’s shoulder and his other arm gave way, body collapsing further into Steve’s embrace.
When Peter had spent days trying to tell himself that he was never going to hear his dad’s voice again, even hearing it angry and hissed was wonderful. It surrounded him like a wave, occasional words breaking through the haze but none of them registering too deeply.
Finally, he turned to Tony and grinned. “Remember. One photo a day.”
“Hey!” Steve let out a startled laugh. “It’s Christmas! You can’t call me that.”
Tony chuckled as Peter threw himself backwards on May’s lap to grin upside-down at Tony, Christmas jumper riding up around his stomach. “There’s one more thing to do before a film, though, isn’t there?”
They fell quiet. There was a lot that Steve wanted to say, a million thoughts running through his mind.
“Well.” Steve swallowed. Should he not have asked? Was that rude? He couldn’t tell a toddler from a seven-year-old most of the time, but who knew if that was offensive to parents. “I did.”
That was the man that Steve loved, even when he wanted to scream at him.
“He likes you.”
“Alright.” The woman next to Sam suddenly clapped her hands and stood up from her squat, stretching her back. “Let’s get this show on the road and get this darling out.”
“You told me to leave you alone, well, not verbatim.” It took him a moment to remember when had that occurred and when he did, he was flummoxed.
The effect was instant. Red dots covered him immediately but before any shots were fired the small man stood in front of him. He quickly dropped the gun and raised his hands.
“Where do you want me? Here?”
Steve looked at him and frowned.
Another shake of her tiny head. He considered his next words carefully. He didn’t want to trigger anything, but he also couldn’t just leave it at this. He looked at her, as casually as he could.
And he made the mistake of looking at him and there goes his self-preservation. Because the desperation and supplication in his voice were already too much, the rawness in his eyes destroyed whatever self-control he had left. The pause he made gave Steve the permission he needed.
Instead of answering, he stalked over to the man, grabbed him by his arms and dragged him out the front door. He threw him out with force—held back by a lot only because he didn’t want to kill him, but still enough to leave bruises. Then he slammed the door shut. Seconds later, he’s back in his room, hugging Eve, and planning their escape.
Now he doesn’t have to. Because there’s nothing to go back to.
He watched as the smaller man tentatively moved towards him. When he was close enough, he handed Steve two bags, a clutch and a duffle.
“Mister, can you read? She left me this. Maybe it’s where she went. Can you read this?”
“Of course you’re going to make me say it so I’m the bad guy you fucking arrogant prick—why have you not been giving me orders out in the field?! You command everyone, but you haven’t said two words to me—”
Because of course he built the house.
So now he’s back to square one. It would be another six months before he saw them again. And it wasn’t even because of anything he’d done. It was all because of this big, hairy, giant alien ballsack named Thanos.
Oh boy, he’s screwed. As he stared at the blonde, blue-eyed wonder who is currently smiling ear to ear, waving at him from across the room, like they had a secret, holding two champagne flutes and pretending to be paying attention to the crowd that has gathered around him out of nowhere, he realized how utterly fucked he is.
Steve looked at him, confused etched on his perfectly annoying face.
“I just want you to know that you don’t have to say anything. You don’t have to acknowledge it, you don’t to reciprocate it, you don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do. If you want me to stay away, I’ll do it. I just, please don’t be mad.”
Except for him?
“It’s not like I have a choice anyway. Like I said, let’s just get this over with.”
“We have a garden,” she answered quite casually. “Well, technically it’s Steve’s garden but he told us we can take or add from it anytime.”
He could feel his brain short-circuiting and he couldn’t really understand the rest of Steve’s words because he’s still stuck on that four letter word he said with conviction but also uncertainty at the same time.
. She must have felt safe because after a moment, she turned to him, sniffing her unshed tears back, and spoke.
Again, it wasn’t like he wasn’t listening to him. When he informed them that he detected movement in a clearly hostile part of the area they were attacking, he only heard Cap reply, “okay”, and then that was it. He started barking off commands to Widow, Hawkeye, Wanda, even the junior agents who were manning the Quinjet, but he didn’t have anything for him. Which he greatly appreciated because he was able to clear the area quickly and efficiently, not having to worry about having a little koombayah moment before acting on it. At that moment he didn’t let it bother him. He knew he’ll have hell to pay for not letting Steve know what he was going to do or waiting for an instruction. That had been their MO from the beginning. He even braced himself as soon as he landed inside the Quinjet moments before they departed the now cleared area. But there was nothing. He found Steve stowing away his shield and easing off his gauntlets. When their eyes met, he got ready to bark back a stream of rebuttal, but Steve only smiled at him and said “good work out there.” Before he could stop himself, he ribbed the super soldier.
Not surprisingly, it is Tony waiting for him at the docks when he landed via helicopter from the Raft.
The grimace on Steve’s face told him he thought otherwise.
It was so simple.
“You are daft.” She headed to the door but right before she stepped out she turned to him for a moment.
“Steve, stop!”
“Please.” So quiet it could have been a dream.
“I don’t need your help, Cap!”
“I’m good. Just had this idea pop into my head and I kinda need to turn it around for a bit cause it’s not making sense, yet, I mean it will, when I figure it out—” he stopped when he saw Steve staring at him, eyebrow raised curiously. “I’m rambling.”
“I thought you weren’t coming back,” she mumbled before burying her face on his neck. Her voice was tiny and scared. It made his chest tight.
“Steve—you don’t have to do this—”
Only it kept on happening. The next fight came. And Steve had no words for him again.
About how caring he was. He knew Tony hated going to the hospital. So he’s taken the time to keep comprehensive first aid kits in several places all over the compound so there’s always one within reach should he need it.
About how thoughtful he was. When he found out that he loved berries, the next time he ventured into the garden there were several of them already halfway flourishing. Blueberries and raspberries and strawberries. All his favourites.
“What? I mean, yeah—”
, and in their room,
“She deserves death.” Because she did. She deserves to finally find some peace. Because only in death will she find the quiet. Only in death will it truly be over.
“Yes, yes I am.”
3 YEARS LATER…
He felt the air shift behind him a second too late.
“Are you sure?”
He reviewed the security tapes. If he had used the private elevator meant only for Avengers (used to be anyway), but somehow had managed to disable Friday’s biometric scans (impossible), there would still be CCTV footage of him somewhere. But there was nothing. No Steve Rogers inconspicuously trying to get in the tower. So again, how? How did the money get to his desk? Rhodey, Pepper and Happy all denied doing it. Nat, who has also disappeared off the face of this earth but at least still has her phone and replies just sent him an emoji of the middle finger. Scott was still in house arrest (for a different thing this time). Sam Wilson plainly said, “no, don’t talk to me” before hanging up.
Of course, he doesn’t say anything. So he spoke again.
They wove in through the crowds, heads down, eyes alert, until they got to the train station. Having bought their tickets beforehand, all they had to do was wait for their train—which arrived in no less than 5 minutes, just like he planned. He’s still on alert even as the train moved. This journey is far from over. They’ll be transferring a few more times, making sure to move as quickly but stealthily as possible. Somewhere along the way, a change of clothes would be involved.
. Promises made. Promises broken. He told himself he’ll never say those words again. But when he met her, he just couldn’t help it.
He also broke Steve.
careful to hide her face and stepped back into his room. He deposited her near the closet where their bug out bags and important documents are kept for quick escape. He signalled for her to keep quiet and wordlessly she understood. She quickly hid. And then he was back in the hallway, looking at the man who was still frozen where he left him.
“Sorry, your words don’t hold a lot of currency to me.”
. He just needs to get things out of his system like that one time after the Chitauri attack. He’ll be back. And now…
Steve shook his head, still smiling.
There’s no else to ask forgiveness from.
“D-dad?”
It happened so fast. One second, he was aiming his repulsor at Steve, the next, Bucky’s head is exploding because he got in the way to save Steve. He was seeing red figuratively—then literally. Because pieces of what used to be Bucky was now everywhere—on his faceplate, on Steve’s hair, face, mouth. It was gore. And it made the world stop.
“No witty comeback?” Steve asked and he quickly realized he hadn’t replied and that he was staring. He really must have looked off because not a moment later, Steve was closer than ever, looking at him with worry.
“I thought this was what you wanted?”
“Sure, let’s do this. Let’s get this over with.” He walked towards the center of the room where the girl is currently twitching in her seat.
Where. Did. That. Come. From?!
“You have—no idea—how crazy I’m getting—trying to deal—with my feelings—for you,” he said in between kisses.
“Thank you,” she whispered. And because he didn’t want to spook her and because he had all the time in the world, he just said, “you’re welcome” and started cleaning up.
And then it was utter chaos. Because agents were storming everywhere, taking him by surprise. He never called for back-up, nor did he tell anyone where he was going. Ross must have tracked him somehow, his anger making him sloppy enough to not notice.
He rolled his eyes at her.
Steve pulled away to look at him. They’re both now breathless and the colour of beet.
