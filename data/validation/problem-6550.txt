“Yeah, babe?” The genius turned on the steps, looking down at the super-soldier with a raised brow. Steve only blinked at him, jutting his bottom lip out in a childish pout. Tony’s head tilted forward as his lips curled up in a smile, and he descended a few steps to reach him again.
He was halfway into the back seat when he caught sight of a familiar, bulky figure with a mop of blond hair jogging in their direction, completely soaked to the bone. Tony straightened up, leaning an arm against the door. “Steve! What the hell are you doing?”
Tony was exhausted. Physically, mentally, and emotionally exhausted. Fighting off Ultron’s minions and ferrying the citizens of Sokovia into the repaired Helicarrier had taken more of a toll on him than he first realized. It wasn’t until the falling city had come raining down around him did Tony feel the fatigue slowly seeping into his bones.
Steve raised a brow, lifting his coffee mug slightly as he asked, “Nearly forgot wh – ?” The question was cut off by a heated kiss, hungry and open-mouthed, with Tony tugging harshly on the front of his shirt.
“Uhh… Security breach?” Tony piped up, blinking twice in succession when he spotted his old business rival stepping out from the private elevators.
“Yeah, fine,” Steve replied shortly. He felt his brows knit together at the sudden inquiry. “What’s up?”
A/N: Many thanks to Perlmutt and Bleakloft for the cheers, ChocolateCapCookie and the home-skillet chucks_prophet for the betas once again!!
Tony laughed beside himself, hiking up his little girl on his hip before kissing her cheek and blowing a raspberry. “I missed you too, baby. Were you behaved for your Papa?”
“Huh?” Tony flattened his hair out a bit more, taking a second to let the question sink in. “Oh. I flew the suit when I realized I was going to be late. But I was anyway, and I just –” He took a deep breath, setting the menu down, and then smiled when his eyes met Steve’s. “Thank you for waiting,” he said sincerely.
in Germany,” Tony began, smiling bitterly. He waved his hand in a dramatic fashion as he stepped towards the bed. “I
“You don’t need to apologize for that,” Steve responded just as gently, brushing his lips to Tony’s temple. He reached around them, tugging their comforters over their shoulders and cocooning them once again. To make a point, Steve squeezed Tony tighter, smiling when his husband melted against him.
Tony sniffed and opened his mouth to reply, but their wedding officiant cleared his throat loudly, pointedly, mouth pursed like he’d just bitten straight into a lemon. “
“Yeah, quite the mystery,” Steve replied, rolling his eyes as he pulled Tony closer by the front of his sweater.
Tony responded cryptically, feeling the butterflies settle in his stomach. “For someone’s birthday.” This could go one of two ways, and even then, he wasn’t sure which reaction he’d get out of Steve. He was often touchy when it came to things from his past.
, Jonathan Storm, 24, has been in the country for over a month in preparation for his royal wedding to Prince Peter of Carbonell, 23.
“No one else but the love of my life.” Tony paused for the screams and cheers. From the corner of his eye, he noticed Jameson fidget nervously. “Some of you might know him. The guy’s got my heart — hook, line, and sinker.” Another glance to the side of the stage showed Steve with eyes so wide that Tony genuinely felt a little bit guilty for what he was going to do next: “My fiancé from District Four. Steve Rogers.”
Tony needed to thank Pepper for suggesting the museum visits. She deserved a fruit basket (sans strawberries; he’d made that mistake before), or maybe a raise. Definitely a raise.
Steve snorted out a laugh, letting his chin hit his chest. He shook his head as he walked a few paces forward, secretly welcoming the cool shade that the tall trees provided. Squatting beside Tony’s head, he said, “I know you can make the last two miles, Tones.”
“I love you too, ya big dope,” Tony teased, planting a firmer kiss on him before turning on his heel and following Bruce to the upper laboratory floor.
A lot of my peer group think I'm an eccentric bisexual, like I may even have an ammonia-filled tentacle or something somewhere on my body. They’re wrong. I happen to have two.
“They don’t call it the White House for nothing,” Bruce put in seriously, cracking a smile when Natasha fought to keep her face expressionless.
Steve remembered how it started: a sensual kiss with Tony’s hand at his neck, and then his grip was light around his throat, and Steve
“It’s only one-three, they’ll make it back up,” Bruce offered, throwing in his two cents. He cleared his throat then, muttering under his breath, “Hopefully.” Natasha snorted a laugh, hiding her face behind a hand.
Thor’s voice thundered above them all as the Norse god got to his feet, a thin-lipped smile stretching across his mouth. “So! Mer of Ham,” he said mockingly, causing Tony to snort, “I’m curious to know. How did you and our dear Anthony cross paths?”
Steve bowed his head to lean for the straw, but Tony instead caught him with a kiss. He swiped his tongue over Steve’s lips, licking into his mouth. Steve sighed into it, recognizing the undeniable taste of
“Nope,” Steve responded quickly, shaking his head. “Just, ah, arguing with customer service people.”
Tony took a breath, and then another, and then continued: “I may have idolized Captain America, but I fell in love with
, made things a little better, but the fact that his AI refused to let him know where his boyfriend was still made things difficult. And although everything in him screamed for him to override JARVIS’ protocol he knew disrespecting Steve’s privacy wouldn’t help solving whatever had been wrong for weeks now.
“Please.” He moaned when the tendrils tightened around him before loosening again, pulling him closer to Steve’s front. “
“Welcome home, honey,” Tony had greeted another time when he ran into Steve in the elevator. Tony settled against his warmth, contentment spreading through his limbs as he leaned his head up for a peck on the lips.
Another tendril, longer than the others, rubbed at the waistband of his underwear before slipping past and rubbing over the growing hardness in his pants. “Oh, shit,” Tony cursed, feeling it coil around his cock. The breath got knocked right out of him, and he held fast to the front of Steve’s shirt, silently thankful that the blond still had the wherewithal to keep him from falling.
Tony’s head was spinning from the constant lack of oxygen flowing to his brain – or maybe it was spinning because Steve was kissing him stupid. They were already half-undressed at this point, random articles of clothing littering a path from the couch to his bedroom.
After pulling some all-nighters to finish a college project, Steve accidentally sends his cute grad student professor Tony the wrong portfolio.
I do have one question for you though (And you can block me and report me to the dean of students if I’ve read things wrong this past semester, so I’m really hoping I hadn’t) – since you officially won’t be my student once grades are posted this weekend, would you maybe wanna grab coffee with me on Monday?
Relief flooded through him. Steve inhaled sharply, squeezing his hand. Tony shifted in bed, and then his face was pressed against Steve’s back, his arm going around him in a hug. “I’m sorry,” Steve said wetly, only just realizing that hot tears had started running sideways on his face.
“Icee,” Tony supplied, reaching for a clear plastic cover. “It’s basically a frozen drink, like a slushed snow cone. Just ice, syrup, and probably a lot more sugar than is recommended for human consumption.” He stuck a red straw through the opening before taking a big pull. “It also stains your mouth blue.”
Steve smiled down at Tony, lips still wet and kissed red from when he’d captured Tony’s mouth with his after stepping into the lift. “Sweetheart,” he crooned, running the pad of his thumb across the brunet’s parted lips, “you’re so good to me. You’ll do anything for me, won’t you, baby?”
“Steve…” Tony peeked his head out from under the covers, eyes red with tears but a smile tugging on his mouth. “Thank you.”
It took a couple of seconds before Tony returned the kiss, a sound of resigned confusion coming from the back of his throat.
Steve took full advantage of their close proximity, dipping his head to place a close-mouthed kiss to Tony’s lips to hold off the oncoming rant. He startled when he felt a teasing pinch to his ass, blowing air into Tony’s mouth in retaliation.
Tony interrupted him, “You lost the luxury of having choices when you refused to sign the damn Accords.”
One of Peter’s favorite holidays was Valentine’s Day. Not because he had anyone significant to spend it with, but because he had
“Stop, Tony. Look at me? Please?” Steve lifted his face up, but Tony still refused to open his eyes. A sigh. “I don’t want to leave you like this. I want to –”
to have said roommate barge into the room in the middle of a jerk-off session, and then offer to “help you out with that?”
He sure did sound like it. Steve sighed in exasperation, turning around to face an apologetic-looking Tony. “I’m not mad,” he said again, softer now, moving to sit up just like Tony was. “Honestly, I’m just –”
There was a tense silence before: “I talked to Nat, the other day. She… yeah.” A sigh. Tony’s breath was hot against Steve’s neck. “Listen, I forgive you. I just… A
Sheepishly, Steve picked up his mug of coffee, taking a long sip. “Yeah, what a mystery,” he said casually. “Whoever did that definitely wasn’t functioning on two hours of sleep this morning.”
“I love you too,” Tony whispered, pressing their foreheads together in a tender motion. “Now get back in that bed, soldier.”
, you win” – and Tony was swiping away his designs. Steve moaned when Tony turned around and kissed him, fingers twisting into his hair and tugging hard.
Steve grabbed a hold of her waist as she attached herself to Tony’s front, smiling up at her dad excitedly. “I missed you!” she crowed, throwing her arms around his neck.
When a couple weeks before, Steve looked on edge and shaken in one of their missions and Tony had to step up and lead the group, he was worried about his boyfriend and wanted nothing more than to comfort him. And he did just that when everything was over and they were back at home, he didn’t question Steve and asked what was going on in his mind, he just hugged tight. He knew PTSD and trauma first hand, he still woke up thinking he was falling through New York’s sky and something as small as having things handed to him could make him panic, he also knew sometimes just standing in front of the fridge for a few minutes could make Steve feel cold for weeks. But they had both learned how to work their way around the trauma and the bad days, Tony for one learned that hugging his boyfriend tightly and asking JARVIS to turn the bedroom’s temperature up could keep Steve’s nightmares and shivering at bay. So that night, after the mission, he just held Steve close, whispering words of comfort and making sure he knew everything was alright.
She had the audacity to laugh when the two of them shared a look and started sputtering out denials, adding, “Come off it. I’ve been alive ninety-two years now. One learns to recognize pure love when they see it.”
It was late at night once when Steve returned from being gone for three weeks. “Hey, Tones, it’s just me,” Steve had whispered as he climbed into bed with Tony, wrapping him in an embrace and kissing his forehead. “Go back to sleep, sweetheart.”
A few seconds, which felt like an entire hour, passed in silence before Steve gathered his wits, blinking between his boyfriend and the man seated beside him. “Um. Tony, this is –”
The praise lit Tony ablaze, burned him from the inside out, stoking the warm heat licking at his veins. The gloves scratched at Tony’s skin, which prickled as the touch lingered; Tony’s lips grazed the inside of Steve’s wrist in a light caress. “Anything,” he confessed, breathless. “Everything.”
International news outlets announced the engagement of the century early morning of August 23. According to
Tony who was leaning slightly against Peter’s side as they walked down the ramp. Tony who had a red-stained bandage wrapped around his side. Steve ran towards Tony, moving with a kind of haste brought out only from the apprehension under his skin. The first thing he did was pull his husband into a tight hug, burying his face against Tony’s neck and just breathing him in, and then he started to trail kisses up his neck, over his jaw, until he captured Tony’s mouth in a kiss.
Steve spotted a head of dark hair descending one of the escalators, and he reached his hands up to keep Morgan balanced on his shoulders. “Maguna, I think I see—” He was swiftly smacked in the face with the hand-made sign that she had insisted on creating, blocking his vision for a moment.
Steve, who wasn’t afraid to look him in the eyes. Steve, who was smiling down at him without an ounce of remorse on his face. Steve, whose only response was to kiss him again, hands holding his face as he deepened it. Their kiss was all teeth biting at lips and tongues smoothing them over.
it started, but he definitely noticed that it did. During clean-up after a battle, Steve had paused in the middle of shifting rubble and rolled the sleeves up of his uniform. Tony got…

Harley’s eyes widened to the size of sand dollars, and he crawled out from under his covers, kneeling at the edge of his bed. “Breaking
Steve and Tony had had their fair share of fights over the years, and even though they always made up, sometimes their arguments weighed heavily on Steve long after. Perhaps it was only the latent insecurities prodding at his edges, but Steve would catch himself wondering why Tony bothered staying with him after everything.
They’d joked about it before, seeing all the tweets and tiktoks about people not having anything better to do during quarantine apart from baking bread and streaming video games and fucking each other’s brains out. It was definitely a thing, but they were an
The corners of Tony’s lips bowed upwards as he broke contact, pulling a hair’s breadth away to whisper against Steve’s mouth, “I love you so much.”
nine-years-old.” The genius rarely blushed, but his face was tomato-red with embarrassment at the mention of his old Captain America pajamas.
Steve stifled a laugh, wiping the wetness from his cheeks with the back of his hand. Leave it to Tony to crack a joke if only to test the waters.
“So,” Tony started, taking in a deep breath. “Am I going to find out why you’ve turned into a Capsicle and have been giving everyone the cold shoulder, or do I have to pull out the puppy-dog eyes, huh?”
“Oh, sweetheart.” Steve was in front of him in only four strides, hands busying around Tony’s face and shoulders to check him over briefly before pulling him into a tight hug and close-mouthed kiss.
“I thought I was protecting you from it… you know, the truth. The extra pain. But I, uh, I wasn’t sure how I’d…”
“Right, right, yeah.” Tony ran a hand through his tousled hair before craning his head forward to catch Steve’s mouth in a kiss, tasting of rain and a little bit of his morning shake. (Blueberries. Tony loved blueberries.) “Now get inside and change before you get sick,” he ordered lamely, realizing a second too late that
, Steven Grant Rogers. I fell in love with the way your eyes shine whenever you discover something new. I fell in love with the way your tongue sticks out of your mouth whenever you’re concentrating too hard with that stupidly adorable look on your face. I fell in love with the kindness that pours out of you in buckets. I fell in love with your hugs, because you give the best hugs — sorry, Rhodey.” Tony stole a glance at his best man behind him, who only rolled his eyes in response.
So, a little less reluctantly, Steve told him everything. (Well, mostly everything.) Much like the online redditors had told Steve, Sam encouraged him to pull up his big-boy pants and tell Tony how he was feeling about their not-relationship. Sam teased, “It’s time to think with your real head instead of the little one.”
Peggy was as sharp today as she was back during the war; the moment he and Tony came into the room to greet her, there was a twinkle in her eye. When they sat on the couch across from her, leaving a good foot of space between them after a teary reunion, she’d asked, “How long have you been courting one another?”
After twenty years of marriage, Tony had developed a morning routine that he loved. Before ever opening his eyes, he would roll into his husband’s warmth, blindly leaving soft pecks over Steve’s face, from his nose to his cheeks to his mouth. Steve would kiss him back, blinking awake with a sleepy smile on his lips.
“Thanks, Happy, didn’t notice.” Steve rolled his eyes, wiping the droplets from his face. “It was barely cloudy out when I left for the park,” he explained.
Tony’s thumb swiped across his bottom lip, and Steve pressed a soft kiss to it. He smiled then, hooking a finger under his chin and tilting his head up; Tony leaned forward and kissed Steve like a man dying of thirst.
“The mental scars never go away, though, and that’s not your fault,” Steve said softly, cupping the back of Tony’s head. He started scratching Tony’s scalp lightly, the way he knew helped to calm him down whenever he was tense. An arm snaked around his waist, and Steve felt Tony’s fingers twist into the back of his shirt, holding fast. A wetness started to spread across his chest, and it was only then that he realized that Tony was crying, letting his guard down in the dark of night and in the comforts of their little bubble.
to. He’s a part of you in the same way you’re a part of me, and I’m just lucky as all hell that Barnes was there for you when I couldn’t be.”
More tendrils found their way around Tony’s body, around his wrists, his arms, his ankles. A couple found their way down the back of Tony’s pants, slipping between the cleft of his ass to rub at his hole. Tony felt wholly and thoroughly surrounded, and while his heart pounded loudly in his chest, he wasn’t scared. Not of Steve. Never of Steve. Steve’s eyes were blown wide, dark with lust and something else Tony couldn’t quite put a name to.
Tony’s shifting in bed had woken Steve up. The bed dipped just enough to roll Steve forward, and he blinked sleepily in the dark, reaching an arm out to rub comforting circles at the small of his husband’s back. “Hey… ‘nother nightmare?” Steve slurred out, his voice still sounding rough from disuse.
Among the leftovers is a steel box with a combination lock that likely got crushed underneath the debris. Tony gets distracted.
“Then, I don’t know, give me something to do that doesn’t require steady hands! It’s as if you're purposely looking to make life harder on yourself,” Tony snaps, fingers curling into fists where he’s shoved them into his coat’s pockets to hide the worst of the trembling.
After a beat, Steve comes up onto the bed as well, his reflection in the mirror approaching from behind and then sitting down to pull Tony back into the V of his spread legs. He goes willingly, reclining against Steve's chest at an angle that's relaxing but (unfortunately) gives him an excellent view of his reflection.
Steve took him out to a special exhibit on the maestros of the Renaissance a few years ago. Tony isn't unknowledgeable in the fine arts–he was once the proud owner of a collection that totalled 482 million dollars, and contrary to popular belief, Pepper hadn’t curated it all by herself–and he'd always known enough to drum up conversations throughout the many exhibitions he attended as an interested party as well as a PR stunt.
Very slowly, Steve takes the last pieces apart until he can pull the glove off with one brutal, swift motion. He tries hard not to look at the skin he's ripped off with it, the exposed patches of flesh not bleeding but reddening instead. It's difficult to be completely unafraid of what he's about to do when he's right here to see how the stones butchered Tony, but he has already decided.
Stark moans, wanting and remonstrating at the same time. Then, all at once surprisingly coherent, he lifts his head and mutters through a croon, "How long's it been, hm? Bet you're–just
Games and jests would never be a priority again, but they still understood the importance of allowing one another to listen and share the happenings in each of their young lives.
A tear escapes the man’s eye, perhaps as a result of physical exertion or desperation; either way, it's Steve's doing and more than satisfactory. When he blinks to clear his vision, another drop follows.
After short rest, a brown slop that barely qualified as coffee and a conversation Tony had forgotten the moment he stepped back outside, the man showed them to the back of the hut, where a small roofing shielded half a dozen mules from the worst of the cold. Four of them were entirely packed with hay bales, the other two carried supplies and equipment under thick, dirty-white canvases.
Now, Tony savors the familiar quiet between them; it's a reassurance that they don't need to talk to communicate. Steve's lips resting on his neck mumble
“And I will be sure to have an earnest talk with the woman about her loose tongue and the type of men she chooses to share her bed with, no doubt. As for you–” he stepped back, creating enough space for Hammer to slip past him and leave the table as he gestured for the man to do so in an ever-polite manner.
i'll be honest: there most likely will not be another upload in the next months (school sucks and it's my last year, so double the stress) unless i accidentally do crack and experience a sudden burst of writing fever, so i apologize in advance. but again: i won't abandon this fic and it's definitely getting finished, so no worries.
As he spoke, he was leaning in closer. Before Steven could think to respond, Anthony pressed warm lips upon his, and it was as if his mouth had a mind of its own, because it reciprocated the other's kisses with fervor and no regard for the voice of logic in his mind.
Because he can't. And he never really wanted to, if he's being unapologetically, brutally honest with himself. (He isn't, most of the time, but there are rare instances of clarity wherein he can admit such things to himself.)
If he carries the stupid flip phone everywhere from that point onward, stares at it like it holds the answers to the universe and wonders if the message was a perversely casual ‘Happy birthday’ or another dirt cheap apology, then that’s nobody’s business but his own.
Steve decides it's time to announce their arrival. "Alright, you've had your fun," he shouts, raising his voice over the alphas and occasional betas who are cooing, crooning and growling playfully at the man in the corner and laughing in unison whenever he gives a feral hiss in return.
So now, Tony turns, realizing that this is the first time in a long time he's getting a good look at himself, and he's–
Steve's cock gave a twitch, and Tony produced another soft sound of lust but remained relaxed, his walls tight but not gripping him either.
One of the few Lords to join the fight in person, Anthony rode into battle next to James that day, armor plated in gold and red fire that stood out against his knights’ steel-blue like a beacon in the dark.
Bucky halts and Steve follows suit. They regard the scene, far enough away from the action so nobody will notice their presence for the time being.
Rogers pulls him in, and something rustles. He has produced a scratchy blanket from somewhere and is now wrapping it around him, tucked tight around Tony’s body up to his nose. Then, they ride. Rogers does.
Steve freezes in his step when he catches sight of the leather-bound book and that's about everything Tony needs to know. Finding the truth was supposed to be liberating. Freeing. It feels like shackles made in an attempt to be free.
he asks, wordlessly, hopefully, his brows drawn together in question. There must be something in Tony's face that betrays his answer, because Steve exhales in defeat before Tony even gets the chance to open his mouth.
"What is this commotion?" young Lord Stark asked, anger in his tone calling for answers as he strode onto the courtyard. He was closely followed by his steward, Ms. Potts.
Next to him, Bucky suddenly steps forward, eyes clouded with an emotion Steve can't read. "I'd like to help," he says, quietly, and Steve isn't sure whether he's doing it for him, Rhodes or Tony, but he has an inkling it might be all of them. When the man nods in approval, Carol joins in as well.
In the first week, Fury makes good on his promise and sends a team to search the house and its perimeter for any anomalies – the agents are turning over every rock-slash-object around the house (quite literally, to Tony’s immense dismay) while a few lab coats carry out all sorts of scientific tests, hoping to come across a trace of anything that may indicate Fury's suspicions to be true.
"You're allowed to be. Sorry. I didn't think it was gonna be that much," he answers, and he does sound sorry. A little guilty, almost.
Tony’s lips tick upward just so and he grabs a plate for himself, only convinced once he’s given the omelet a taste. He hums approvingly. “Might make you stick around against your will if you turn out to have a secret knack for cooking,” he jokes, ignoring the sudden change in the atmosphere and the way the air seems to settle heavier around them whenever they’re alone in the same room together with their focus solely on each other. Steve knows, rationally, that it’s only a projection of his own discomfort, but it’s hard to pretend like that doesn't make it real.
Ignoring Hammer, Natasha elaborated about her footwear, “They’re Louboutin. No one will notice the extra red.”
His eyes then flickered to the large plate of food that his boyfriend set down on the far side of the workbench; roasted green beans and garlic mashed potatoes doused in gravy. The seasoned smell of medium-rare steak wafted up his nostrils. Steve pressed a soft kiss to his temple, resting a light hand on the brunet’s shoulder.
The game continued on despite the slow drizzle coming down from above. One by one, the spectators sitting on the bleachers raised and opened up their umbrellas against the rain. Tony hugged Steve’s arm, cheering as Morgan ran the ball down the field to the other team’s goal. “That’s my girl!”
last thing he remembered was falling asleep with Tony snuggled up against his side despite them both layered with a thick sheen of sweat, kicking the sticky, soiled sheets off the bed. It was the first time that either of them stayed the night with the other, deciding that the occasional trysts and sneaking away in the middle of the night was a thing of the past. It was also the first time in a long time that Steve could remember sleeping soundly, without the familiar heavy feeling lingering in his chest after a night terror. Whether or not it was having somebody with him in bed to chase the demons away was an entirely different thing to consider.
Tony countered, smirking, “Not worse than consulting on a magic cube, then having to save New York from said magic cube?” He let go of Steve’s hand, stepping closer to Bruce and throwing an arm over his shoulders. “Your blind optimism astounds me, Jolly Green. We’re talking SHIELD here.”
“Hey, no, come on.” Steve moved to block his path, raising a hand. He frowned at the shorter man. “As team leader, I can’t in good conscience –”
Tony placed a firm kiss to Pepper’s temple, praises falling from his lips as the nurses cleaned and swaddled their baby in a purple blanket and pink beanie. Steve kept holding Pepper’s hand as she held the newborn in her other arm. All three of them stared in awe at the baby girl, head full of dark brown hair peaking out from under the cap. Pepper let go of Steve’s hand long enough to pass her into Tony’s waiting arms.
“You’ll only get yourself hurt,” Steve growled out, his frown tugging his lips lower. For a moment, Tony thought he was going to up and leave, but the look on his face changed. He looked… sad. Resigned. Steve’s eyes shifted from shooting daggers to pleading with him. “I…
A grin painted itself on Tony’s face, a chuckle escaping his lips. “If only the world knew just how insatiable you were, Mr. Rogers-Stark.”
Well, perfect until a surprise visitor had crashed their little party. It went without saying that he was uninvited and
Tony peeked an eye at him, raising an eyebrow. Steve leaned forward on his forearms, craning his neck to press a chaste kiss to Tony’s mouth. A pleasant sensation settled in his chest as he continued to pepper short kisses against his lips, feeling Tony’s pout melt away into a cheeky grin.
“What are you doing?” Tony asked, voice tight when Steve walked close in front of him. Steve’s only response was to cup Tony’s face and place a close-mouthed kiss to his forehead, lingering for a few heartbeats before tugging Tony into a tight embrace.
They were chatting him up with fake smiles and less-than burning questions. Tony couldn’t really hear what anyone was saying from across the ballroom which was still buzzing with numerous other voices, and while Steve kept a bright smile on his face, he could tell from his body language that he was, in fact, not ‘fitting right in.’
“I love you, hon, but no.” He looked back up at Tony, feeling the tears pool once again in his eyes even as he tried to hide his smile. They shared a kiss, chaste and short and sweet, smiling so wide that their kiss was more teeth than lips.
Steve interrupted Tony with a chaste kiss, and then another, lingering. “I love you, doofus,” he confessed, his face splitting in a grin.
Hammer’s face lit up, and Tony immediately wanted to strangle the guy. “Oh, me and Tony? We go way back! Two peas in a pod! Titans of industry! Men of vision!”
Steve had once told Tony that he'd never be the man who would make the sacrifice play, and Steve hates it with his whole being that Tony chose this time to prove him wrong. Steve's laid Tony down because he didn't look comfortable
Things had melded together after that, between the shock and Prince T’Challa’s arrival and Zemo’s arrest. It was like one moment they were inside the bunker, and the next he was standing out in the snow with Steve at his flank.
It took Tony an embarrassingly long time to remember what exactly the ‘last time’ was that Steve was referring to. Then, it dawned on him: the first time they’d kissed (officially or unofficially, they still bickered about it sometimes) was when Steve had caught Tony sneaking away from the medical floor of SHIELD’s New York headquarters.
“No. Never with this. I’m serious.” Tony looked up at Steve, smiling encouragingly. “I know you have your qualms about passing on your old illnesses and are still scared about how the serum would affect everything, but… yeah. Yeah, I want to have a mini version of us running circles around the living room. I want messy birthday cakes and sneaking around on Christmas morning planting gifts and driving the kid around in a soccer mom van for practice across town — but I swear to God, Steve, if you make me buy a gross van, I’ll vomit—”
“It’s a hundred acres with a lap pool! It’s got a screening room. There’s worse ways to protect people.”
At the same time, it scared him a little. He was always waiting for the other shoe to drop. Tony wasn’t good at relationships – let alone
was weighing heavily on his mind was the first time in weeks that he’d opened up. Despite their current living situation, with Steve having moved in with Tony in the penthouse apartments months prior, the latter had started to feel like they were ships passing in the night.

Steve’s mouth went dry as he tried to rest a hand on the other man’s arm. “Tony, it’s not that easy to –”
thought that wearing baseball caps and sunglasses weren’t great disguises either, but the two of them made it into the movie theatre without anyone recognizing them and immediately blowing their covers.
Steve almost never minded listening to Tony talk. He loved his boyfriend’s voice – it became one of the things he found comfort in over the years – but if he had to hear another half-hour-long rant about Secretary Ross breathing down their necks or the tech upgrades that he couldn’t even hope to understand, Steve was going to
“You won’t,” Tony responded, managing to take a few more steps in his direction. “I’m not afraid of you. Either of you.”
“I hate all of you,” Steve said in jest, picking up the wax candle with his fingers and setting it aside.
Tony’s laugh traveled to their ears as he spotted his family waiting for him past the arrivals area. Steve grinned down at his husband as Tony approached, pulling his carry-on behind him. “Hi,” Steve greeted.
Tony only shrugged, hiding a grimace as Hammer’s words floated back in their direction: “See, Thor, Tony and I… we are more similar than you think. Brothers in arms dealing… bosom buddies, dare I say, intimate friends…”
All over social media, people continue to share yearbook photos of Storm and Prince Peter, who had once attended the same elementary school in New York, Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters, when Duchess Mary had for a short time resided in the state prior to her untimely passing.
Steve’s face was emotionless as he stared down at the contents inside the folder, a piece of parchment paper that was preserved and slid inside of a thick, transparent protector. His jaw was tense, Tony noted, and a deep red flush started to creep up Steve's neck as he realized just what it was he was looking at.
times.” Tony fidgeted with his jacket before slipping it back on. His brown eyes locked onto Steve’s for a short moment before he said, “God, I hated you growing up.”
“Sure, but I didn’t see you making any moves to throw my not-archnemesis out, did I, oh boyfriend of mine?” Tony tried to stifle the rest of his chuckles as he reached for the eggnog, tipping it up in Thor’s direction. “Merry fucking Christmas.”
Whoever thought that keycards were the peak of innovation when it came to hotel room security locks deserved to step barefoot on a Lego. A single Lego, so painful that they’d regret the day they were born. (Was that mean? Probably a little. Tony knew he got mean whenever he became impatient, and with Steve pawing at his clothes and littering every possible surface of his skin with hickeys while he fought with the door to their penthouse suite, Tony was decidedly
into their kiss. Albeit short, fleeting, and risky, this would be the only time they had and it was worth every second.
“Yeah, Steve, sorry, I know,” he muttered distractedly, returning his focus to the table hologram. He used a stylus and his free hand to reorient a digital blueprint for what was presumably a new Iron Man design. Tony stole a glance in Steve’s direction, eyes moving over his body. “I’ll be up in a few.”
Tony leaned back into the gaudy and uncomfortable seat, tugging at the cuffs of his suit jacket before taking a glance over the Capitol citizens in the audience. “I have to be honest with you, J, it kind of makes me miss home. Although, I can’t complain too much.”
Steve pulled away with a smack, looking Tony directly in the eyes as he said in a firm tone, “Shut up.”
Steve had stared at him for a long minute, unsure if he’d heard his husband correctly. “Like… with children?”
He’d decided on his order some twenty minutes ago, but he continued to peruse the menu in his hands because he felt awkward sitting alone at the table. Of course, he knew that Tony was late to things all the time – board meetings, tech conventions, and public hearings in front of the Senate, to name a few – but he’d never been late to meet Steve on a date before. A date that
Every person that Tony passed in the hospital took one good look at him and immediately averted their eyes. With knitted brows and a mouth pressed into a hard line, he looked like he was on the warpath. The guards standing outside of Steve’s private room in the more closed-off part of the hospital exchanged a glance when he approached, but neither of them got in his way when he barged through the door.
Steve’s grin was so wide by the time the Avengers finished singing in mismatched harmonies that Tony thought his cheeks were going to burst. (After everything that went down in Sokovia, and Bruce going AWOL, it was a welcome change of mood in the New Avengers Facility.) His boyfriend shook his head in amusement, looking down at the round red-white-and-blue cake that resembled the iconic Captain America shield, and blew out the ‘97’ on top of it.
Steve looked up at Tony as he approached, accepting a short kiss in greeting as he rounded the table and slid into the seat opposite. He ran a hand through his dark wind-swept hair (it was longer now, great to get his fingers lost in) while the other picked up the menu. “There was a malware issue with the security today,” he began in a rush, scanning the food items, “and Pepper just about ripped a new one in one of my poor IT guys. I was adequately terrified
There was no malice in Tony’s words, just a poignant fact. It wasn’t like they’d never talked about it before. The two of them had stepped off on the wrong foot when they first met almost four years ago, all due to wrongfully preconceived expectations; Steve realized that today wasn’t the first time Tony had extended the metaphorical olive branch.
Cheers. Gasps. All that and more rippled through the audience. Tony angled his head to the side of the stage, where some of the other tributes were. Each and every one of them, Victors in their own right, reaped to play into the Seventy-Fifth Hunger Games.
It was a small victory, watching the three gray typing indicators, but it was a victory, nonetheless. Steve finally admitting to Tony that
Steve leaned his forehead against Tony’s, with tears collecting at the corners of his eyes. “I love you, too.”
. No one knew about the operation outside of Fury, Hill, the surgeons, and a woman who’d introduced herself as Melinda May.
It was Tony’s turn to cut Steve off, slotting their mouths together messily as he twisted his fingers into Steve’s blond locks. Steve reciprocated almost immediately, tightening one arm around Tony as the other carded through his hair, tugging hard enough to elicit a moan.
It was one of those few idle days when neither of them had meetings or other immediate responsibilities, and they could be content with just lazing in bed until noon came around. Steve watched Tony quietly, head pillowed on his forearms as he laid on his stomach. Tony was tracing the outline of his mouth with the tip of his finger, grazing over his soft lips and following the curve of his cupid’s bow.
The rest of that afternoon went by in a pleasurable, sweaty blur. It was afterwards, when Steve and Tony were both sore, sticky messes, that they settled into exchanging lazy kisses, exploring kisses, tangled together in sweat-soaked sheets in a room that reeked of sex. Neither of them seemed to care too much, wanting only to keep physical contact with another human being. Tony left, eventually, when his phone rang and pulled him away from Steve. In the quiet of his room, Steve silently stared at the ceiling with his heart thudding loudly in his chest and a pleasing ache seeping into his bones.
Tony shrugged Steve off, making a point to avoid looking in his boyfriend’s direction. “Stop, stop! You and Barnes need to
The uproar was deafening, the Capitol citizens so wild that the Peacekeepers had to step in to calm everyone down for the next tribute interviewee. Tony passed Justin Hammer as he exited the stage, nodding to the Victor as he stepped on.
Steve observed Tony’s silhouette against the dim lights of their room, thanks to the automatic adjustments by FRIDAY. He pushed himself to rest on his arm, grasping Tony’s hand with the other. Steve pressed a kiss inside the palm of Tony’s hand, trailing more along the skin of his wrist all the way up to his bare shoulder. With half-lidded eyes, Steve matched Tony’s gaze, offering a soft smile. “C’mere.”
“Sir,” JARVIS piped up, “you did in fact tell Captain Rogers that you would be retiring to your bedroom at half-past –”
A/N: I really wanted to lean into Tony comforting Steve a bit here bc I tend to see more Steve comforting Tony in other fics, and I wanted to be ~quirky~ Also, it's been months since i last updated, so i hope y'all enjoy this lengthier chapter with kisses 31-40!
Tony had been gone for a whole month promoting some new StarkTech in Oslo and Seoul and Singapore, and Steve and Morgan had spent those four weeks on near-daily trips to Central Park and nightly calls with Tony before she went to bed. As nice as it was to have Morgan all to himself, they both missed the third side of their family triangle to no end.
Steve captured Tony’s lips, licking filthily into his mouth and tracing over his teeth as if he were mapping it for his memory. Tony groaned, twirling his tongue around Steve’s and absolutely reveling in the heady taste of him. When Steve pulled away, Tony was flushed and breathless, nothing but a thin line of spit keeping them connected.
“Don’t make me fight you, Mr. Rogers-Stark.” Tony adjusted his stance, wrapping his arms tightly around Steve’s waist and pulling his head back slightly in order to get a good look at his husband. Their eyes met, ocean blues to honey browns, and Tony’s broad grin matched Steve’s own.
from the doorknob. He breathed in deeply before turning around to face Steve again. A harsh huff left Tony’s nose when he examined the state Steve was in – face battered and bruised and stitched up, skin littered with angry reds, purples, and yellows.
trying not to cry because Pepper had a grip on his hand that was deceptively stronger than he ever anticipated.
Steve blinked once before ducking under one of Tony’s arms, nodding to Peter who replaced his spot at Tony’s other side. With amusement lacing his words, Steve said, “I don’t think I ever imagined you willingly going to medical without arguing with me before.”
Steve missed Bucky’s wrist, teetering off balance as he slipped on the mud, taking Tony down with him when he tried to save his husband from falling. “Do you think we’ll get banned from seeing the rest of Morgan’s season?” Tony asked suddenly, brushing Steve’s wet hair away from his face.
Natasha huffed from her nose, reaching for her mug of hot chocolate. “Thor wouldn’t kill him. Probably.”
“Laura said she’d give me rewards points,” she contested, adding, “plus, the Marigolds are number one in the league right now.”
“Don’t you dare bullshit me, Rogers!” Tony frowned, glaring at him with such a seething anger that it nearly broke him to see it. “How
With a dismissive wave of his hand, Tony said, “Good lookin’ out, Cap. If you would be a dear and let Fury –”
“Ha-ha, very funny, sweetheart,” Steve deadpanned, rolling his eyes. Tony and Steve shared a look; it was brief, but in it was the confirmation that they both were waiting for: It was time to tell the kids their story. Part of it, anyway. A little white lie never hurt anyone. Letting go of a held breath, Steve announced, “Alright. One story.”
was — less complicated. But with Tony’s lips molding to his, Tony’s hands pulling firm at his hair, Tony’s warmth surrounding him, well… Steve was only human.
As the team walked through the main courtyard of SHIELD’s headquarters, all Steve could focus on was how warm Tony’s hand felt in his, fingers laced together like they were made for each other. Natasha and Clint were talking about Director Fury requesting their assistance with some recon and science expertise, and though Steve tried, it all went in one ear and out the other.
There were days that Tony doubted himself and his abilities; not usually regarding his skills as an engineer or a strategist on the battlefield, but how he would be if they ever decided to grow their family of two. Whenever the topic of children would come up, Tony always found a way to divert the conversation or make an excuse about how he’d be a horrible father just like his own. Over the years, however, Steve had seen just how wrong Tony was.
Steve’s hips stuttered when Tony clenched around his length, back arching off the bed with hands grasping at Steve’s shoulders. Dipping his head down, Steve captured Tony in a kiss, biting his lips red and licking into his mouth as the waves of pleasure crested. They stayed together in a tight embrace, Steve continuing to fuck into Tony with slow, shallow thrusts, exchanging kisses until their lungs were filled with the smell of each other.
Tony’s hand was warm in his, his thumb moving over Steve’s knuckles. Steve was satisfied with listening to Tony as he spoke with Peggy, tracing his profile with his eyes and staring at his mouth as he did so. For the first time in a long time, Steve was overflowing with contentment, just being in the room with the two of them.
“It was a joy to catch up with everyone,” Tony said as he began to wrap up his good-byes. “Unfortunately, Mr. President wanted a word with our dear Capsicle and sent me to fetch him. Excuse us.”
“Not tonight. Just be in the moment with me, honey. We can think and make important decisions later.”
? Are you serious?” Tony scoffed, almost laughing. He sauntered up to Steve, making a point of getting in his face. “Sorry, buddy, I don’t seem to recall
Steve squirmed under the scrutiny. He let out a long breath before plopping into the grass beside Sam, scrubbing at his face. “Don’t laugh at me,” he pleaded lightly.
, Tony! Including you! HYDRA were going to – to –” His jaw trembled (barely, though Tony noticed), but a determined expression still washed over his features. “Goddamn it, sweetheart, I couldn’t
Steve was surprised to find his post on Reddit get so many engagements in less than a day. He didn’t know what expect from people having an opinion on his situation, frankly, let alone what kind of advice they’d give him. Most of the comments went somewhere between “are you sure you’re straight” to “you’re definitely in love with him.”
“Absolutely. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I’d file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated –”
Tony shushed him quietly, kissing away the tears at the corners of Steve’s eyes and cheeks. He caught himself, barely, when Steve’s knees buckled, landing roughly on the ground as he continued to cry. Tony sat on the step with Steve between his legs, holding him to his chest as he pressed a kiss to his hair. As hard as he tried, Tony couldn’t help the hot tears that burned the back of his eyes either.
Tony stiffened almost instantly, mouthing out a curse. Damn it all. With the emergent call from Pepper so early in the morning, the date had completely slipped his mind.
It was surprisingly dark in the room, the only source of light coming from the movie being projected onto the wall in front of him. Tony’s eyes took a moment to adjust to the darkness, registering the silhouettes of about six other museumgoers before finding Steve sitting at the very back, face illuminated slightly.
“Speaking of old white guys, Steve seems to be fitting right in,” Clint pointed out, tossing a nod over to where the blond was surrounded by star-struck state senators.
Steve opened his mouth to rebut, and Tony turned away from him almost immediately. Still, Steve leaned forward to brush a kiss to the shell of Tony’s ear, whispering, “I’m sorry. I can’t.”
“Please, you shouldn’t have,” Hammer said bashfully, enthusiastically jumping to his feet. “Outside you said?” he continued callously, following Thor to the glass doors that led out to the landing pads.
. Tony climbed from the passenger seat and onto his lap with almost no hesitance, reaching for the lever to push his seat back to make room.
“I don’t either.” Tony pressed his forehead against Steve’s, staring into his blue eyes like he could read the future in them. “But I’ll figure out how to bring you home. I promise.”
Despite the close proximity, it still felt like they were a thousand miles apart. They both had their backs to each other, but Steve couldn’t help reaching his hand around, resting it in the empty space between them. Steve thought Tony had fallen asleep, but he eventually felt fingertips brush against his. Soon enough, Tony was slotting his fingers between Steve’s.
low in his chest before picking Tony up off his feet and tried carrying him to their king-sized mattress.
The first time he realised his boyfriend was kinda acting kind of off was when, about a month before, Steve dismissed one of the Avengers’ bonding nights, saying he had some paperwork to go through, and even if that was true, everyone in the Avengers Tower and their mothers knew how much Steve valued those movie nights and how he made sure that everyone was there and had fun. So when he walked away from the living room, all of the Avengers shared a worried look and Tony more than anyone wanted to go after him and make sure he was okay, but he knew Steve needed his space. And, in the following day, no one thought much of it anymore, considering that Cap was his normal self, up before anyone and already, sweaty from his early run, making breakfast for everyone.
Tony’s breath got knocked right out of him. He winced inwardly when a quiet groan escaped him, and even though he wished Steve would ignore it, he knew that his boyfriend’s super hearing had picked it up.
It was an accident. Steve had forgotten to lock the door to his bedroom, which in retrospect was his own fault. He was man enough to admit that, at least. Tony ended up walking in on Steve who had his boxers down around his ankles, his shirt tucked under his chin, his bedsheets bunched past his knees, and his hand wrapped firmly around his dick. There was a buzzing underneath Steve’s skin that either resulted from the ebbing orgasm or from Tony’s dark eyes raking over him, he couldn’t be sure. They stared at each other for much too long to be normal — but what was
Steve blusters and begins blushing, before he can protest that it must be wrong the cousins begin to.
Jessica takes a breath to steal herself; miss Potts had assured her that they had no intention of taking part in the class action suit, but as much as she was in charge, Stark had enough sway to change the boards mind.
Steve sits in the back pew at Peggy’s funeral. He feels he hasn’t earned a seat any further forward. He was of a different time to her now, a different life. At the end he dutifully rises to pay his respects and give condolences to her children.
He sits, cocooned in finest cloth: a shield of tailor-made perfection; layers of nobility and justice and sophistication; of righteousness; of good, while a darkness trills beneath this linen and a single crimson drop, spreads like a plague- rending him wretched- revealing truth.
Steve lifts an eyebrow in question, still looking at him as his mouth makes its way up his chest again, nibbling at the skin with a hint of teeth while Tony does his best to respond without letting that gasp at the tip of his tongue slip out.
He doesn't want to say he outright dreads the idea of witnessing all the ungainly changes in his countenance while Steve actively bangs him into next week, but he can't imagine that add-on to enrich the experience much. (Wonder-oh-wonder, the sight of him apparently does something for
There’s an itch in his fingers. There's an itch and it makes him want to do just that every other second of every day and it’s near killing him, but he
He grumbles a little but enjoys the pleasant warmth trapped under the covers despite the noticeable lack of Steve's familiar shape next to him. (He hasn't given up hoping for a day their tumble in the sheets will burn off enough energy for Steve to skip his thirteen morning miles. It'll be like Christmas, but better.)
He jokes with his friends, receives a shirt that says ‘Engineer at work’ with tools shaped into an arrow pointing down to his stomach and puts on impeccable, convincing smiles for the entirety of the two hours he holds out at his public birthday bash.
Current Tony, though, wanted to question his past self, cause he didn’t feel like anything was alright now and he doubted things were as good as he thought back then.
Peggy giggled into her cup of tea, the corners of her eyes creasing with a smile. She took a sip before replacing the cup on the small coffee table between them, tugging the thick knit blanket on her lap closer.
“Because I trust them and they’re my best friends. Just like how Daddy would trust Uncle Rhodey not to tell his secrets whenever he complained about—”
Steve’s response was to pull Tony into his arms, capturing his mouth in another rough kiss, all teeth and tongue and
“…We’ll manage. It’s nothing I can’t handle.” Tony had his phone tucked between his ear and shoulder, focused on his computer as he mapped out a flight itinerary. “We’ll only be there for a few days, so I’m hoping she’s lucid for some of it.”
than okay. It was Tony finally tearing down the walls he’d built up over the years. It was Tony trusting Steve, showing him just that by way of surging forward and pulling him into a searing kiss.
, Steve thought to himself, pressing his lips together to keep from saying it aloud. The conversation he had with Sam, his initial decision to man up and talk to Tony like a goddamn adult, left a sour taste in his mouth now. “This Rumiko girl sounds great, Tony.”
wouldn’t be… Look, I’m trying to – what do you call it?” Tony pulled out one of the chairs, sitting as he finished with, “That’s, uh, an olive branch.”
, don’t you?” Tony countered, leaning forward in his seat. His hand slid across the table, and Steve reached out halfway to entwine their fingers.
When Steve took his seat between Tony and Thor once again, he wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist and all but manhandled him onto his lap. Tony leaned into the warmth of Steve’s chest, unable to hold back the smile on his face when a kiss was placed to the back of his head.
Tony had it all planned out: a nice dinner out, a stroll through the park to get to their favorite gelato place, and then he’d pop the question. Easy. Except the weather had turned sour on them on a flip of the dime, and their walk through the park turned into sprinting in the rain to find some shelter from the heavy downpour. They found themselves under an awning outside of a closed shop, laughing to themselves as they shook off what they could of the rain.
“No, Papa.” Morgan’s little fingers tightened in Steve’s hair as she stretched upwards, rocking forward as she sat on his broad shoulders. He winced, hissing out a complaint as his four-year-old daughter tugged even harder at his hair for leverage. “Oh, oh! I think — oh, no. That’s not Daddy.”
“I didn’t have the money for MoMA when it first opened up,” Steve had revealed as they walked around the renewed museum. His hands were shoved in the pockets of his brown leather jacket. “But see, around ’35, uh, my best friend Bucky saved up enough money working the docks for the two of us. It was neat. The Van Gogh collection was pretty new back then, a hundred oil paintings and sketches and letters from abroad…”
Tony’s personal art collection had been personally curated by Pepper over the years, bless her heart, but even it didn’t compare to the installations and exhibits that the museums had on display. When they’d reopened that Fall season after the Battle of New York, Pepper pushed him to take Steve; something about exposing him to some form of modernity.
“Well…” Steve thumbed at the edge of Tony’s lips, red and swollen. “I can hop back into bed and… pretend to be asleep, if you still wanted to go through with your…” He cleared his throat, eyes dark when he met Tony’s gaze. “Plan.”
Steve’s fingers were gripping at his hair, just on the edge of painful, pulling the filthiest moans from him. Tony was pressed firmly against the mattress, trapped between the cool sheets and Steve’s absolutely sinful body.
“Oh, I don’t doubt it,” he replied, cackling as the rain continued to drench them from above. He leaned up on his elbows, feeling cold mud already sticking to the back of his clothes, and closed his eyes when Tony pressed a wet kiss to the top of his head. Clint and Nat’s voices were all they heard next as they physically started dragging Bucky away.
Bruce agreed. “I’d be too, if everyone was coming up to me and bringing up the most traumatic things to ever happen in my life.”
He raised their intertwined hands, laying a gentle kiss to the back of his boyfriend’s hand. Tony turned his head mid-sentence, shooting him a dazzling smile without missing a beat.
: his dads. Ever since he was a kid, they’d all go out together to a nice, fancy place for dinner, and that tradition hadn’t ended even after Peter went off to college.
Tony had to take a moment to recover before returning the smile. “I’ll tell him right now,” he replied, saying a quick goodbye to Sharon Carter. He set his phone down before rummaging through a drawer in his large desk. To his boyfriend, he said, “Stevie, I have a surprise for you.”
“I’m fine,” he said, trying to reassure Steve, reaching up to smooth the worry out of his brows. “I promise, I’m fine.”
Like the drama queen he was, Tony took two steps off the path and threw himself onto the grass. He sprawled his limbs out, a look of pain spreading across his features. “
“I’m not your knight in literal shining armor for nothing,” Tony teased, grinning the way he knew made Steve weak at the knees.
“You didn’t,” Steve squeaked out. He cleared his throat, trying again, and then straightened up as he adjusted his seat on the couch. Tony’s gaze followed Steve’s hands as they tucked the new cellphone into his pocket. “Did you need help with anything?”
“Morning, sweetheart.” Steve pressed himself against Tony’s back, ducking his head to kiss his husband’s hair. “You weren’t in bed when I woke up.”
The genius slipped into their conversation seamlessly, working his charm on senators like Cherryh, who’d been kind to him on the political front, while throwing out some back-handed compliments to the ones like Stern, who’d once crucified him for privatizing world peace.
Steve needed a lot of mental strength to keep himself from rolling his eyes at his boyfriend’s antics, but he managed. However, he hadn’t realized that the two men had peeled away from their group and begun to trudge up the main staircase until Tony was already half-way up the stairs.
“It was like they were all trying to one-up each other over who was the most likely to get run out of office.” Steve closed his eyes, leaning into his touch and sighing. He raised a hand, wrapping his fingers lightly around Tony’s wrist. “Thanks for saving me, by the way.”
Steve was inspecting the placards hanging on the walls, names of film series exhibited for a short run. He stopped in front of one of the media lounges before ducking behind the dark curtains. Tony read
“No. No, I don’t.” Tony’s eyes softened, and slowly, he smiled again. Steve watched attentively as Tony walked behind him, resting his hands on both of his shoulders. “Honey, I love you, but sometimes you’re so stubborn that I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth.”
Like tasting an ocean after a storm, Steve tasted himself on Tony’s tongue, heady and lingering. Unlike the salty waters of the sea, Tony had never taken anything away from him; in fact, he amplified everything that he touched. And because of it, Steve knew that Tony had him hook, line, and sinker.
.” Tony tightened the grip he had on Steve’s uniform before letting go. He took in one last breath, filling his lungs with Steve’s familiar scent as it mixed with the cold air.
Tony grinned sympathetically, reaching up to card his fingers through Steve’s blond hair. “That bad?”
“How does it feel to be back in the Capitol after so many years?” J. Jonah Jameson sported a sympathetic expression, but Tony knew in his heart that it was nothing but a mask.
for Steve’s gloves. The genius wasn’t a stranger to sexual kinks, but this was… He wanted them on his skin like he needed air to breathe. Every brush of it sent chills up Tony’s spine, and whenever Steve clasped a hand to the back of his neck, Tony just about melted down into his shoes.
“What the hell is he doing here?” Natasha muttered under her breath, throwing a look in Tony’s direction. “I thought he was in jail—”
Even blissed-out and fuzzy-headed with pleasure, Steve could never focus on anything else but Tony. It was the way he let out soft grunts under his breath, moaned sweet nothings against Steve’s skin, or cursed high in his throat every time Steve did something he particularly liked. It was the way he bit his lip while Steve opened him up with his fingers, stuck his tongue out every time he came, or craned his neck up so Steve could litter his skin with hickeys.
Maria nods her head as she listens and looks off to the side, uncharacteristically unperturbed for someone who's just found out alternate realities exist. This probably
He locks one hand around the man’s jaw and Stark seems to not even have the presence of mind to be alarmed by it. Understandable. All else has comparatively minimal priority when your body notices a lack of oxygen in your bloodstream. Steve remembers that vividly from when they put him in the ice.
Maybe it’s the knowledge that it might be their last time; maybe it’s the way Tony looks, healthy and bathed in the golden rays of the morning sun. Maybe it’s the peaceful air of acceptance hanging in the room, knowing that whatever has to happen will happen and they’ll spend these last hours together sharing their love.
He seems to recall as much now, because he finally swings his legs over the side of the seat and stands, dragging one of the blankets after him. His walk is a little clumsy, it always is when he's like this, but he bridges the few feet to Steve's chair without falling or even stumbling.
"Impressive, but I'm still at a loss here. What's all this supposed to mean?" Tony asks into the void, staring at the space where the image of Yinsen had stood just a few seconds ago.
With that, the man kicks his strawberry roan into a slow walk, away from the carcass and toward the southern side of the plateau where the herd strayed to during the previous, evidently tumultuous night. Tony exhales wearily and follows.
On the other side of the portal, he sees Bruce–who brings with him the tale of a Mad Titan and the promise that this is the endgame.
He suppresses a moan, but a small, breathy huff still escapes through his clenched teeth. Tony feels his fingers dig painfully into the bark of the tree he's holding onto while his other hand is clenching harder around his length, trying to get the most pleasure out of the last, frantic strokes.
Natalia could swear the knight, as he stood out there and endured the audience's cheers, smiled fondly and
After five years, Scott Lang (re)appears, and his clumsy explanation of how the Quantum Realm might be able to send them back in time spikes a flame of hope nobody would've thought possible.
And he's aware he should hand Stark over, complete the mission as it were, but he feels as though his own end goal isn’t quite the one it was. A conflict of interest, you could call this: what reason does he have to dance to Pierce's tune to be granted another taste when he already
He looks like little more than an overpriced special edition of Average Joe, 54, proud father of three, husband to a (house)wife but married to his nine-to-five desk-job after which he returns home to complain about said wife's cooking, crack open a cold one and spend the rest of the evening on an overstuffed armchair watching
Eventually, Pepper notices that being cooped up for months on end is beginning to take a toll on him, so she takes him out for a walk some way from the compound. Tony drowns himself in baggy clothes, an oversized hat and scent neutralizer just to be sure–and it’s more inconvenient than one would think but certainly worth it.
"Take it easy," the same someone tells him, and Tony feels like he should be able to put a name to the voice by now. Afterwards, there is a hand underneath his head, tilting his face upward. Something is pressed to his mouth and Tony parts his lips, more out of reflex than in a deliberate action. Warm liquid spills into his mouth and Tony swallows it greedily, relishing the feeling of it soothing his raw throat. He almost whines in protest when it's taken away again, but only almost. There may not be much pride left within him, but he won't stoop down that low if he can help it.
“I’d imagine. It’s alright, Tony. I’m just– it’s a little much, is all,” he says eventually. Understatement of the century, but that’s something he’ll keep to himself. “Call Fury. Pretty sure he’s gonna want to see this for himself.”
Nobody besides May and the other workers had ever taken notice of his newest invention. It was simple enough: Two buckets, one on the floor and one on the cabinet, connected through a tube of braided twigs and leaves so as to keep it leak-proof. The perforated end of another, similar tube was in Peter’s hand, producing a steady spray of water that varied in intensity depending on how quickly he worked the pedal at his feet that was connected to a mechanism within the base of the bucket and helped pump the liquid upward.
At first it was a tool- an armament to their machine- hammered onto their living weapon, under their control- it was not his but at least its cold metal didn’t lie like flesh did (coaxing, convincing him that this was him, all he was), but now he is himself- the arm is of him- he will use it how he must.
“I’d be happy to let them go to her family instead,” Steve says placatingly, but it’s the truth. He doesn’t want this, it’s too much.
Pepper turns to Steve, with a suspicious grin. “You know what, come, it may be a learning experience.”
Hands cover his eyes. Neal quickly curtails his instinctive reaction. Instead he smiles. “You found me.”
They lost their wings long ago, fallen to another world, gritted and grey-ed out. But they hold close to each other, beside the open wounds and form an invisible shield where wings once were. And they sleep in the back-seat of the impala like it's normal.
“Shush! All of you! Don’t even try it!” Marissa scolds, “this is what mama wanted, all of us have gotten many dividend cheques from her over the years, whenever we had need and we know this is where she wants the shares to go.” She turns to Steve, “And you! You’re going to take this gift and treat it with the respect and care it deserves.”
The world spins in a blue smudge sculpted rhythm. And Sherlock may often at times play the errant wild child. But at the end, when his brother’s gentle persuasion of the world has turned its claws and brought Mycroft to his knees, Sherlock will be the one to shield against them all with his teeth. He’s his brother’s keeper too.
There’s silence for a while as they each track their way around the small cell, staying out of each other’s way, until they both come to a stop at the bars.
Charles watches the silhouette of fine leather limning beautiful hands, as fingers reach out exquisitely- rending and remaking metal. Defending and dooming them. Saving them and sealing their fate.
“It’s one of those old style prison cells, no electronically controlled doors, no digital surveillance, not a scrap of tech for me to cannibalise or hack. Don’t know why they think that will stop me; I’m an engineer and a lock is still a lock. It will just take longer.”
Erik’s alone. He’s cold, not physically. The prison walls are stifling; isolating, maddening. He sits on the edge of flashbacks. He despairs, endlessly. Hours slow churn to hours.
“I don’t see what difference that makes. He wasn’t a real lawyer all the other times he helped me out either.”
It was inevitable, once Tony stopped playing ball; they decided he too was too much of a threat to be out. So here they were.
She spurns him. Like all the others. And he angers, wraps her in a death cloth and pays a coin to Hades.
Then one day Steve is eating his breakfast and Tony is eating cold pizza he claims is dinner (which Steve supposes fair given that the man hasn’t been to bed yet) when Pepper steps out of the elevator. She smiles and nods at Steve before addressing Tony,
“No she didn’t tell me. I know I may seem like I don’t care about any aspect of my company that’s non-tech related but I’m not completely oblivious. I know the name and net worth of every person with enough of a share to stage a hostile takeover.”
“I’m thinking about it. Anyway that’s what I came to talk to you about. I’m not selling, but I got a big cheque. I just wanted to make sure there wasn’t someone sleeping on the job in accounting.”
After a while he calms down. Months go by; he keeps his cheques stacked in a drawer and never cashes any of them. Things at Avengers tower go on the same.
Then there’s a warm presence in his mind. Charles. He feels like cosy fires and steely embraces, like a feral lifeline thrown to sea, like hope and joy and salvation.
“Oh, I will then,” Steve says. He knows it’s probably just some sentimental knickknacks from their time together in the war. But he feels unreasonably honoured that Peggy thought of him.
There are no battles here, no bloodied swords, nor bloodied soil; only endless reams of parchments (negotiations), and his voice cracking against the revelation: you’ll have to marry to usher in your visionary peaceful age.
“Most people who own shares in the company haven’t. You have them now, you can do whatever you feel you need to do with them. If that’s to get rid of them, then so be it. As long as you don’t sell them to Justin Hammer.”
The last thing they need is to lose Stark Industries, their biggest client, but ignoring the call isn’t going to make it go away. Jessica answers,
“They’re idiots. Why would they put us in here together? Maybe they want to kill us. Maybe they’re hoping we’ll try to kill each other. Maybe they’re hoping you’ll kill me. It’s a stupid risk; they must want something.”
Steve already has the papers stating his shareholder status. He’s confused when a month later he gets a rather large cheque. He hasn’t tried to sell the shares, that would be disloyal and he really doesn’t want the money. He’s still embarrassed by it all. He briefly considers just calling the phone number on the letter but decides if the company is mistakenly sending out money he should probably talk to Pepper about it.
He’s the only one who’s seen the other side. He knows what’s coming. But no one sees. He’s scrabbling on the shore trying to explain the invaders he saw out at sea. No one knows. No one understands. He’s drowning.
Pepper laughs, “And I should be bothered because big bad Steve Rogers may be unscrupulous with this privilege?”
Well there’s no way he can really refuse when she puts it like that. He wonders how red his face is. “Oh. Of course.”
“Yes. Information probably. If they wanted to kill us there are easier ways. Especially with their resources.”
While he can appreciate the craftsmanship, he doesn't  like it. Steve has shuddered at what the reports said Stark has done to his body. He himself has been forcibly molded into something else, but the idea of brutalizing
"Yeah, we're good. She's treating me well. Pretty sure she's going easy on me because she can tell I'm out of practice," Tony answers, chuckle dry in his throat.
A nice flavor of humiliation bubbles up inside him when he catches Steve watching intently–teeth gnawing furiously at his lower lip–while he slips the plug in, slowly, savoring every second of Tony's used hole swallowing the new yet familiar intrusion.
Steve pretends not to already miss the intimacy and warmth of Tony’s shape nestled alongside his. He rolls onto his back and stares at the ceiling until Tony says, quietly this time, “You could’ve just let me breathe for a full minute, and I might’ve even seen your point.”
Some men take this display of fear as cue to break out of the rows and finally pounce at the man, who hisses and curses and does everything in his power (kick, bite) to keep a hold of his one last possession: dignity. The stink of his distress is thick in the air, only increasing in potency with every passing second. Steve decides to put an end to it.
That man staring back at him from the mirror like he's some idiot. A squishy, soft-around-the-middle idiot.
At first glance, it appears unchanged. It's been a while since the ceremony they held for Tony, but he remembers that day as if it was just hours ago. Courtesy of his eidetic memory. Or maybe that very event driving home the reality of Tony's death was what made the memory stick to his thoughts like duct tape; it could've been both, for all Steve knows.
The broken trap, made from scrap metal that under Tony's hands found purpose again, has a locking mechanism that will usually cause the jaws to snap close but is now malfunctioning. Steve shows it to Tony, and it's clear the man immediately knows what needs fixing because he's quick to assemble all the spare materials and tools he needs.
Steve isn't the only one who's taken notice. The Parker kid comes running moments later, his face a colorful mixture of disbelief and dark apprehension as he passes Steve. More and more heroes begin to crowd closer upon realizing the cause for the battle's abrupt end. Their quiet voices are a blur in Steve's ears, the only thing he can make out his own heartbeat reverberating in his head.
It's another one of the slow days – it is still up for debate whether the regular days can even get any slower – and Rogers has taken to one of his favorite activities. He's sketching in a well-worn, leather-bound book, the sound of pencil on paper now familiar to Tony's ears.
He wanted more and then lost everything, crushed the one chance he might've had in his own two hands. Crushed Tony's trust the same way he did the arc reactor under his shield. It's tragically, hilariously poetic.
To his surprise, Rhodey only hesitates for the better part of ten seconds before he answers, "Alright, Steve," and that's that.
Tony rushes to the kitchen and throws up his breakfast. His stomach rejects everything he’s eaten until it's contracting around nothing and he's dry heaving into the sink. When it’s over, there’s tears in his eyes and the sharp burn of acid in his mouth, and Tony hangs there over the drain for a moment, suspecting the peace treaty of being a ceasefire.
Tony deflates. The rage is still sizzling somewhere in his gut, but it’s subdued, forced beneath the surface again. As is always the case, Rogers isn’t particularly affected by his moods, and there lies no satisfaction in lashing out when the reaction is so unspectacular. In any case, what Tony really needs isn’t to blow off some steam. The actual solution to the problem is apparent.
Harley sat up against his pillows, his bottom lip jutting out in a pout. “But you promised!” he complained, fixing his eyes on his other father when Tony appeared in the doorway. “Dad, he promised!”
“Wasn’t me,” Sam hummed, pursing his lips as he looked at the others seated at the table with him. Wanda and Bucky both shrugged, mumbling a half-hearted
Tony’s eyes darted to the side; guilt spread over his face. He stared out the windows overlooking the New York skyline. “Fury said you were on blackout and I shouldn’t –”

“He was your best friend,” Tony said, cutting Steve off and pulling away to look him in the face. “If you think I’d be mad that you loved him, or-or that you still do, you got another thing comin’ for ya.” Tony cupped Steve’s face in his hands, brushing the pads of his thumbs across his cheeks. He gave Steve a hopeful, comforting smile. “Listen, I accepted a long time ago that I could never be him — and I don’t
Tony cupped Steve’s face, thumbing away the rogue tears on his cheeks. “I want to have everything with you,” he confessed.
Tony approached Steve silently, walking up beside the blond whose gaze remained steady over the view of the New York skyline. In an attempt to save Steve from feeling crowded, Tony kept half a foot of space between them, leaning his weight against the ledge. He fought back a small smile when Steve, of his own volition, took the half-step needed in order to link their arms together.
“No promises!” Tony shouted over his shoulder. He threw a smirk in his boyfriend’s direction, catching the subtle shake of his head.
Steve rolled his eyes, holding the warm tub of buttered popcorn closer to his chest. “Shut up,” he huffed, following the shorter man to where the public drink dispensers stood tall.
Steve let a chuckle roll through him, smiling into the top of his husband’s hair. “Am I not allowed to think?”
Steve barely spared a glance in his direction as he prepared the razor and shaving cream on the counter, shrugging. “What does it look like I’m doing, oh husband of mine?”
“Do you need me to spell it out for you? You two were always cuddling and being touchy and practically going on dates even before—”
Steve Rogers was so far gone on Tony Stark. Frankly, Steve hadn’t been able to glance away from Tony since they started the ceremony, the words of their officiant lost in the air. Tony, on the other hand, had barely looked Steve in the eye; at first it worried him, but then he saw the tears threatening to pool over, and Steve knew his husband-to-be was trying his damndest not to cry in front of everyone.
Steve woke up feeling extremely warm, and it wasn’t until he blinked his eyes open that he realized why: He was tucked against Tony’s side as they lay on the sofa. Tony had an arm around his shoulders and was absentmindedly drawing invisible patterns on his arm. There was a distinctly warm color of afternoon light filtering in through the blinds, and he figured he must have fallen asleep while watching the television.
They very nearly fell into their room in their haste to get inside, arms winding around each other and fingers twisting into each other’s hair and lips slotting together as if they were pieces of a puzzle. And that’s what they were, really, fragments of a jigsaw with all jagged edges that somehow aligned perfectly together.
“What are you naming my goddaughter?” Pepper asked, laying back into the pillows with a soft smile on her lips.
“I’ll call you when we land,” Steve had promised once, pressing a chaste kiss to Tony’s lips before boarding the Quinjet. Tony stayed out on the platform to watch them take off.
“Look, Nick, it’s been a really long day,” he said to Fury, ignoring Steve’s subtle plea, “like Eugene O’Neill long, so how’s about we skip to the part where you excuse us for another five –”
They had fallen straight into their old conversations as if the last seventy years hadn’t separated them, reminiscing on the high points of war and answering Tony’s questions, when he wasn’t sitting quietly, enthralled. Sharing stories and jokes and easing Steve’s misplaced guilt.
Additional thanks are appropriate for giving me an extension on the final! I wanted to make sure everything was perfect. (I’m not saying that I pulled two all-nighters to finalize everything, but I am also not NOT saying it.) I’ve attached a zipped folder file to this email, let me know if you can’t access it for any reason and I’ll send over a GDrive link.
Tony always cried during weddings, so it was only just that he’d cry at his own. The tears Tony had fought so hard to keep back left trails down his cheeks when he started to recite his vows. But Steve was there, like he promised to be, wiping away those tears with the handkerchief tucked into his breast pocket. Tony made a joke about trademarking Gucci Tears, and with the wave of laughter washing over the small crowd of their closest friends seated in the pews, Tony found his composure.
at his Lord, but the moment passed in a flurry and she couldn't be sure whether she had imagined it by the end.
He hides it well, but Tony picks up on the distant waver in his voice all the same. The man swallows, Adam's apple bobbing, and then his hand comes up and his thumb wipes over a spot on Tony's cheek that stings when touched.
“Please, settle down,” a female voice speaks. It’s a cold, aloof one he wishes he’d not recognize immediately. “The occasion for our appearance here is a joyful one. Mr. Stone himself has sent for this one here to be brought to you and done with as you please. Do consider it a gift from him to you.”
, Tony tells himself, and he’ll get to drink again. It has to be like this, or there won’t be any left at all tomorrow. The tomorrow that doesn’t exist here, because they don’t have a point of reference like planetary rotation as they are, floating on this spaceship that Tony is starting to despise.
It’s only after Tony has quieted down a bit that Steve dares to speak up cautiously, "Tony, maybe it'd be better if, uh. Maybe I should think about moving in with SHIELD."
Nobody really seems all too excited about the concept of going back in time to put all the Infinity Stones back where they belong, but they’ll need to do it. Soon. Steve dreads it as well, revisiting a time when their past selves were so blissfully unaware of what's to come, but it has to be done. So he steps up.
"I love this," Steve says, squeezing again for emphasis. He looks pointedly at Tony through the mirror, and so too sees him open his mouth to argue, because he is quick to keep going after that. "I love every single inch of this, of you, and no pound of fat
Tony grits his teeth. It's a lie. Saying it would mean lying. Not that he gets to pride himself on an immaculate clean slate when it comes to the act of telling (un)truths, but– But. Fuck it. This is ridiculous. He wants to get rawed right now. If Steve thinks he can't do
Only for a few moments, because then Steve pulls out, and Tony wrinkles his nose at the sensation of come trickling back out with it. Thoughtful as he is, Steve has collected the butt plug from where they abandoned it on the bed, and makes to push it back inside. Tony gasps as the cool material stretches the oversensitized ring of muscle at his entrance.
Tony would like to wake up now. He shakes his head as if to get it out of his mind, recognizing the futility of the attempt. They come to a halt in front of the archway, the construction appearing taller now that they're closer. Steve's right hand flexes at his side, clearly on edge with the absence of his shield. Not thinking, Tony grabs his hand and intertwines their fingers. It's just as much for himself as it is for Steve -- the contact feels grounding.
"Well, to be frank, 'm not sure it is so secret after all, seeing as it even serves as gossip for the washing maids." He laughed at his own words, only continuing after he had recovered from a series of hiccups.
He's lucky, this time. Because Tony doesn't need to be nudged in any one direction at all. He blurts, "Your Tony, was he– were you…? Was it always strictly platonic or–"
When Carol only met her eyes with a befuddled expression, Maria sighed long-sufferingly and elaborated, "Your intentions to spare them and yourself an uncomfortable confrontation are
Tony wouldn't have guessed it would take him less than a day to miss Red Rock and its saloon with the rats and the watered down booze, but here he is. Miserable. Rogers is probably just waiting for him to crumble and turn his horse around, which is exactly why Tony can't. He's always had the incessant need to prove people wrong, especially those assumptions related to his person and his perseverance.
They're set to move out at the break of dawn. There's nothing more this city can give them, and Steve is glad to leave it behind for it's become a symbol for everything desperate and greedy he has turned into that he promised himself he never would.
Tony's tirade is interrupted by his own surprised yelp as the air is punched out of him. Steve has moved,
Steve doesn't react beyond the obvious, only straightens to pull Tony closer until there’s no space left between their bodies. Tony hums as he feels Steve’s bulge press against his bare ass.
Peter nodded, but after a moment, his forehead creased with a frown. "Does she know you are leaving?"
The fear of death is an overpowering one; Steve feels it in his own heart, deep and dark and looming. It has been lurking for a long time, and now that the time has come to strike, it doesn’t hold back. It digs into his heart, travels through his veins, lays itself out over his lungs and settles in his gut like lead. Like poison. Steve’s only ever feared death the most when it came in the shape of Tony’s, not his own.
Time’s never been on their side. Hell, they call him the Man Out of Time, what else is to be expected? Tony ended up tagging along for the sake of it, and now he's here, out of time for an entirely different reason. Not that he blames his personal failings on Steve now. He’s using up all his remaining energies to stay alive, he doesn’t have the strength to hold grudges anymore.
Just, perhaps, the bond between Lord and knight was not an ordinary one. Perhaps… there was more than met the eye.
And yet, he's here, crammed in a tiny space with this defiant, irritating, loud-mouthed omega turned into a shivering, helpless, wanton one. It's wrong to want it this much, Steve knows that. Depraved is what it is, but he can't help it – he runs his fingertips down Stark's spine, just grazing the heated skin, from the curve of his neck to the small of his back but no further. The body underneath him trembles in anticipation and finally, Stark bites out a frustrated whine, opting to rut against the sheets below him.
It must've happened in a matter of seconds, but the moments in which the power of Tesseract takes hold of his body feel like eternity. It's unlike anything ever felt; it's not pain, not even a bodily sensation at all. The energy travelling through his veins feels as if it's turning him inside out, his flesh and bone ripped from his soul and placed back together the wrong way around–
It's cooled down overnight. When Steve stretches (as much as he's able to in the single bed) and the brisk air makes the hairs on his arms stand, it takes all his willpower and the painful emptiness in his stomach to keep him from curling back up in the blankets.
"Steve Rogers," he says, extending his hand to shake Tony's, and it takes Tony longer to react than he's comfortable with admitting.
Rhodey, Pepper, Peter, Happy. Vision should’ve been here, but he disappeared again just yesterday and Tony doesn’t need three guesses to know where to. It’s not just Steve’s loyalty he’s had to reevaluate.
The look Steve shoots him makes Tony's throat close up. There's something dark and wickedly determined in his eyes, like he's--like he's considering going through with this.
In fact, Carol realized as she grew, she was not interested in much beyond the art of swords and the art that was other maidens.
Now however, Tony is able to make out his features in the dim light of the saloon, and the man is almost shockingly handsome. It's a strange sight. The west seems to turn even the prettiest people ugly, with its dirt and grime and sickness. And it's not like this one has been spared the worst of it: he's sunburnt and gruff too, with a split lip, a shadow of stubble on his jaw and an old scar on his temple. Somehow, though, that doesn't diminish the effect the deep blue of his eyes or the pink of his lips seems to have on Tony, and he has trouble looking away when the stranger lifts the bottle to his mouth and drinks.
Steve captures Tony's surprised moan in a kiss, his tongue and dick claiming him as Tony comes apart underneath them. And then, as Tony is panting and shuddering against him, Steve follows him over the ledge, Tony's muscles working around him.
It takes him a second to spot the bruises – they’ve mostly faded like the rest, but they’re there, splotches of yellow in the vague shape of handprints against olive skin, and the implications make Steve pause. Only for a moment in time, though, because it’s not something he wants to think about and it definitely isn’t something Stark will want to talk about, so he shoves the thought aside, locking it away with so many others that came before it.
There's no judgement in her voice, nothing to gauge whether she has an opinion on the matter one way or the other. A personal connection clearly isn't there, but she'll have known of Tony's name and the things told about it and connected the dots. It's a simple statement and one that is true–after half a year, the amount of Tony's tech circulating on the market is scant.
"Safe travels," he shouted as both the knight and the Lord kicked their mounts into a leisurely trot, leaving the castle grounds and their walls behind.
"You want, uh, water? OJ? Multivitamin? Cherry? Any fruit juice at all, really, you name it. Or– something alcoholic? I don't think I– There's beer, if you want. You
These days, there is little they can’t do without facing consequences. The other governmental corporations will give them a slap on the wrist if anything at all, because the reality is–they need Hi-dra more than it needs them. Hi-dra keeps the peace within the city, as much peace as there will ever be. They’re what’s standing between them and chaos, uprisings, the lower-class scum. If AIM and the like were to decide they didn’t need Hi-dra, chances are Hi-dra would get rid of them instead.
She grins and, with an 'oof', heaves herself back upright. "No, I like them. Sailboats are totally cool. Daddy promised we'd go sailing to the Maldives next summer," she informs him, flopping the small stack of paper with her calculations on it over to its blank side. "There. More paper."
After a minute of uncomfortable silence hovering between them, Steve decides to end it and broach a different topic. He's been meaning to ask, anyway.
A pause. Tony pushes out a breath between his teeth and lets his head drop onto the other man's shoulder, squeezing his eyes shut.
"You sure you want–" Steve starts, now that he's still (mostly) got his head screwed on right, because while they share one enemy, their relationship isn't even on the verge of amicable.
His back curls inward in hopeless search for a respite from the pain. Every breath is fire in his lungs, but he can’t let it go. “What did you do?" It's supposed to be a demand but the words leave him in a strained wheeze that belies only the effort it took to voice them. "What the fuck did you
It's half a moment after that that the ranger takes the bundle and responds, "A'ight, son. Long as y'manage to stay in the saddle."
sleeping on the damn, lumpy thing that barely qualifies as a couch) at the crack of dawn, not bothering to keep the noise down as he prepares coffee, reignites the embers in the fireplace, and wolfs down a ration of beef jerky.
They already took the arc reactor, what more could they want? (Lips against his neck, an ache deep inside and the bruises on his hips remind him:
Tony perks up, following his eye line. "Oh, Pepper was here," he says, "she and Happy are taking Maria until tomorrow. It's a monthly thing."
She adds, "If you're the man I think you are, you'll find a way to do both," and turns to leave without a goodbye. The heavy thud of the door falling close drives home the point.
There’s something like unspoken understanding between them. Watching your friends and allies turn to dust while you’re the only ones to remain standing will do that to you, Tony thinks, during a bout of morbid cynicism.
Steve gives an affirmative. They agreed upon this already and besides, they both know there's no real possibility that particular scenario will come to pass. Even if it did, Steve would have her out before they could pluck a single fingernail.
Steve's almost by his side when Tony's eyes drop to his right hand, but Steve pulls his sleeve back and reveals the identifier bracelet before he has to say anything. A little more at ease, he lets himself be wrapped in a crushing hug, and some of the tension leaks from his shoulders.
"Okay, true. I'm Steve, but I think you know that already," he says, voice harder in a way he hopes will seem more genuine. He's getting the feeling this girl can smell bullshit five miles against the wind and will notice any and all sugarcoating he might try to attempt.
Hardly any knight of the Iron Guard was fit to hold a candle to her and the skills she had made her own. Some of them were not enthused about this fact, hurt in their pride and manliness, while some others warmed up to her after a while.
Tony thinks, just as Steve drives into him with renewed vigor like somehow the words have led him to express his want even more urgently.
The closer he gets to the glove that accommodates the infinity stones, the more restless he gets. They're emitting a steady, dim glow, all in their respective places where Tony first put them. It's not that he's in awe of their power -- no, not that. He's far past that. He's
She only paused for a moment before her feet carried her toward one of the rooms, at the entrance of which she promptly remained frozen in place. Unable to avert her eyes from the sight she was greeted by, Carol observed.
Although his first instinct is to reply in joking, maybe go off on an unprompted anecdote about how,
The reactions are as positive as one would assume, but Steve surprises him. Tony expected him to argue, maybe shut him down with a ‘we don’t have time for this’ or a curt request for him to focus, but all he does is heave a deep breath and pinch the bridge of his nose.
"Yeah. It’s all sorts of small things, like– There, he had a birthmark right…" Tony trails off briefly as he points it out on Steve's skin, the tip of his finger just grazing his jaw, "there."
Tony is embarrassed to find that the sound he utters at the first touch of Steve's fingers to his hole isn't a moan, or a grunt, or any of those sensible things. No–he whimpers, desperate and already wretched despite the fact that nothing earth-shattering has happened as of yet.
Peter swallowed. Well, if Anthony was convinced… he certainly had to have put many a thought in this decision.
He thanks Natasha and squares his jaw as he approaches the small group of people that has gathered at the end of the corridor, all visibly agitated, their collective attention focused on the sleeping space up where Stark is hidden. A tired-looking beta woman with a toddler on her arm is fending off the crowd, bellowing that
Steve chuckles at the man's ramblings. He won't say it and ruin the fun, but he's almost positive willfully incriminating himself would do Tony no good in the long run. Sure, Fury's people sniffing around and getting all up in his business will be testing his patience for a while, but in the end, there won't be any leads to follow and they're going to be forced to drop the matter.
"Didn't think you'd still cry," Steve says, dragging a thumb along Stark's bottom eyelid until a drop of liquid seeps out, like squeezed from a ripe fruit. "But look at you now."
) but he realizes the feelings are useless and trivial at this point. Tony forgave him. Tony is gone.
Hammer took it upon himself to pave the way for a thorough slander of Stark's name, sparking a debate about the many wrongdoings of the very host that provided them with food, drink, shelter and a part in the annual tourney of his own free will.
Tony remembers vividly: asking him to sign, one last time. Presenting him with Howard's pen. A peace offering, an olive branch. One last chance to resolve the mess they’d created in a civilised manner.
