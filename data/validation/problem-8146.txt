Maya Hansen is walking down the aisle, sitting down, shrugging off her trench coat, pulling a thick stack of files from her bag –
Acquaints himself with the idea that the unrequited love of his life just abandoned him. Again.
And Steve looks at him like he despises him.
“They won’t do this for you, though, will they,” Tony whispers, his lips grazing Steve’s ear, and Steve’s eyes roll back behind his closed eyes.
“I’m not interested in money,” Steve says. “I’m.”
Steve sits in his chair and tries to remember what it felt like to be confident. To bend people to your will without really trying.
“Oh, spare me,” Tony snaps. “You. Here. Steve Rogers at Studio 54, Jesus. Or should I call you
He guides Steve into his mouth because he can’t be silent and he can’t be honest and he can’t prove his devotion the way normal people do. He swallows Steve down just as Steve twines one hand in his.
Tony isn’t soft. He’s big, he’s heavy. Steve thinks maybe Tony could rough him around with his fancy new biotech. Tony has a way of moving that’s deliberate and restrained; subdued in a way that suggests violence may not be far behind, if requested.
“Nnnnghhh,” Steve says, as Tony pulls it half out of him. The plug is less than nothing, Steve runs through 15 possible outcomes and five of them are Tony fucking him from behind, he wants that, it feels like his whole brain lights up when he thinks about it, that’s what he wants to ask for –
“Right after you left, actually,” Tony says, strangled and relieved all at once, like he’s been dying to say it to someone. “It’s been a shitty few years, Steve,” he tells his feet.
“Tony, my guy,” Rubell is saying, his maroon-jacketed arm slung around Tony’s shoulders like they’re the best of friends. Rubell is already tweaked; he looks at Tony’s tabletop project and tuts. “And to think that I brought this over here, just for you.” He tosses another vial onto the coffee table while Tony cuts his lines.
Steve, he says.
you have to stop reading the tabloids–”
- - -
Steve wants to leave his body.
“My color is red,” Tony says.
Tony slides into sleep, finally, his face pillowed on Steve’s bicep.
“Tony, your –” Steve starts. He clears his throat. “Your heart is going fast.”
There’s just Tony’s wet moaning and Steve’s gasping sobs for a moment, and then Tony just catches the flash of Steve’s shield coming down in his peripheral vision, shining in that sliver of light.
let me, let me, please–”
“You climbed into bed with all those well-dressed men in Washington, Stark,” Steve tells him, and Tony blinks and blinks and blinks and wonders what the fuck he did to earn this, sees what’s left of his life stretching out before him and in every scene, Steve is there, a vengeful ghost, a friend he’ll never earn back, a specter come to drive him into his own grave.
Tony uses his normal hand to slide the gag back into Steve's mouth. He holds it there against Steve's lips with one finger and Steve moans something bright and shameless. Tony feels it when Steve comes, feels him go rigid and taut, carefully drapes his fingertips - but not his palm - against Steve's abs just to feel every minute contraction while he takes his own pleasure.
“I know what you think of me,” Tony says, and his own voice sounds like gravel.
Steve throws himself on his belly, hugs the body of the drone; inches back down as they climb through a cloud. Tony can barely make out his shape, but then Steve’s hand closes around his, pulls him up.
It's intentionally cruel. It topples every single fantasy Tony has cultivated in his absence. Tony's eyes water with the pain of it. He looks for the affection in Steve's face and Steve looks wrong, as wrong as Tony has ever seen him.
He rips at his hair and tries to breathe. His crotch feels wet and messy and foul. An exit sign beckons and Steve kicks the door open with more force than is strictly necessary and gulps in lungfuls of foul city air. The smell of sweat – bodies – cigarette smoke – abruptly gives way to the garbage smell of New York at night.
His latest sins populate the news. People talk about him as if he doesn't remember what compassion is, so he must have lost it. Strangers treat him like a machine. As if he is beyond humanity.
“Tony,” Steve says. “Tony, I’m so hard, please–”
you could make it happen.” Steve huffs out a laugh. “I think you’re never going to change,” he says, “and now all those people you were supposed to protect are gonna end up dead, or incarcerated,
Steve’s hand ghosts over his, where the new ring sits. But they cut the old band off and that whole arm is riddled with nerve damage and it feels like a shadow.
He wants to scrap the mission, but Steve has never really gotten what he wants, so a few reckless decisions and accidental deaths later, their recon is done and there are no AIM prisoners to interrogate. Steve gets home a day earlier than expected and Tony meets him at the door, hospital tag still around his wrist, shuffling his feet, his face sallow and quiet and ashamed.
“You made me want to be better,” is what Tony ends up saying, breathless and choking.
Something cold and empty festers in Steve’s chest.
This is better than the waitress. He can’t remember her name and it was three days ago, but he’s going to remember this. He’s going to turn this over and over in his mind’s eye for months. Steve should say something responsible, VD – that’s still a thing, probably, and he doesn’t have a rubber, but he’s not the one at risk here, and all his accountability drains right into his genitals as this man slides to his knees in a beautiful controlled collapse.
“Am I dying,” Tony says into Steve’s leg.
Tony’s not chasing a solution. Steve thinks he would take anything at this point. A fight. Sex, though that happens less and less these days the way it used to. Tony won’t do it, won’t tell him he’s being an asshole, won’t tell him to leave, won’t work up the energy to walk out of the room himself.
At some point it gets away from him. Most things do. It’s why he was so effective. Why he has so many ribbons on his dress uniform.
Tony teases himself like that for a time, holds himself loosely in one hand, and then,
No, he croaks. His skin sears. Something is wrong, Steve.
“Can you please get Nat to take your mission,” Tony says without meeting his eyes.
“I want this,” Steve says fiercely, “I want what we have, Tony, I want you–”
almost ok again and Steve pulls out in a slow drag and then pushes his way in fast, without warning, just to watch Tony’s face contort, to watch him clutch the leather and make breathless noises and this is perfect, this is everything –
He gets out of bed. The heart monitor beeps wildly. Steve gets his hands out, like Tony's holding a weapon and he needs to be talked down.
Steve gathers Tony's arms up behind him, wrenches his arms back. Leans down on one elbow, presses Tony with his full weight. Let me in, Steve says, bending to bite Tony's ear. He licks over Tony's gland, only glancing, and the pain is so sharp that he is certain he's going to vomit.
He looks like he could use a good fucking, Mike is saying; already back in their loft, through the wall. They don’t think he’s home, maybe. They don’t know he’s listening. He tucks the card into his belt.
Steve has been riding the bright edge of anger for the last few days. Wake up angry, slam doors harder than normal. Actively resent.
“Please,” Tony says. “Just.” He sniffs again, sways on his feet. “Whatever he’s paying you, I’ll pay better–”
The pain comes.
She fears him. He exists above her; he looks evil. All the gold paint in the world can’t make that right.
Steve’s eyes snap open. The man is licking his own spend off his fingers, catching a trickle that’s threatening to run into his beard. When he turns his face up, the strobe lights up his face, hits his eyes just right, just for a moment.
Steve hadn't taken his opening.
” Steve says, because that’s reckless even for Tony.
“I don’t know how to do what you’re asking,” Reed says, his hands up, his monitors abandoned, the blue glow spooling over his face in the early hours before sunrise. “I don’t, AIM has been working on it for years, there’s a sizeable difference between looking at another universe and getting to it–”
Steve almost chokes on the cauliflower he’s wolfing down. “Excuse me?” He’s better than his impulse control. He is, but the urge to say someone’s gotta pay for your treatment does over his tongue before he clamps his mouth shut. “There’s a lot going on right now,” he says instead. “I’ve been gone a lot, I know. They have me - A.I.M. is planning som–”
It’s a terrible privilege and a terrible roller coaster. He’s miles ahead of Steve, he’s a genius, he’s dazzling when he’s at the top of this game and violently sad when he’s not. It’s all Steve can do to try and anticipate, to minimize the collateral damage, to forestall the inevitable place Tony circles back to: self-loathing and entropy and dispossession. And Tony’s not crying anymore, but his face is still wet, his eyes are still watery, he still looks like he never wants to go out in the sun again, it’s like walking over land mines and orbiting a star at the same time and if Steve can mitigate this disaster with his body, well.
Tony still isn't slick but Steve has plenty to smooth the way, rubs his cockhead along Tony's ass, presses and presses until he's at his rim. Slides home like it's his right. Like he's been thinking about it for fifteen miles.
His costume doesn’t rip, but it’s a near thing. Steve isn’t expecting the suddenness of it, the almost-violence, and sharp panic wells in him as the wall cracks a little where he braces himself with one hand. His briefs have bunched up under his balls and it’s too dark to see, but the air on his skin feels obscene.
It’s been so long, he can’t help but stare. He licks his lips, finds the taste of himself where Tony’s been. Tastes blood, too.
“It does bring out my eyes,” he concedes. He gives himself another once-over. A little shudder runs through him. He’s flushing, up his chest and over his cheeks and a bloom of it on his back.
At least, that used to be the case.
Steve sits with his knees curled up to his chest on Tony’s cot. Something warm sparks in Tony when he recognizes his face. It’s a strong face. Like Steve has strength for the both of them.
You're going to kill me, is what he tells Steve.
“I’m fine,” Steve says. He pulls the collar from his neck. He takes a towel, rubs it over his face until his skin feels raw.
Tony doesn’t know where they’re taking him, but they transfer him three times on the way to the airport and exchange his cuffs for the SHIELD-standard manacles that he designed for Steve. They pack him into a Quinjet knockoff that looks like it infringes upon several of his patents just as it starts to rain.
It is such a privilege to be the one to make Tony’s brain trip over itself like this, however briefly.
“–I don’t understand why you’re so upset,” Tony says. “I’m ok now–”
Tony has a sheen on his face, one perfect tiny ringlet of hair plastered to his forehead with sweat. Standing in the moonlight, the angles of his face are sharper – he’s lost weight. He skates the edge of good bone structure and junkie pall. His hair is just long enough to be rakish without looking scraggly. He’s wearing eyeliner like a rock star and a few delicate gold chains hang from his throat – more misdirections. He looks high, he looks dangerous. He looks like the kind of guy Steve might take pity on in daylight.
Steve all but drags Tony into his suite. He rips the sheets off of his long-abandoned furniture, knocks over an easel, puts Tony in the bed that smells like the two of them. Stale. Desperate.
His SHIELD guard is small enough that he thinks he might have been offended a few months when he still had his ego. Shepherd, an asshole who wanted to be on the Alphas. Laila, Maria’s chief security officer.
Steve remembers the way they crowded around Tony’s bedside after Norman Osborn did everything but cave Tony’s skull in, how he had that tube in his mouth, how Steve thought
“I don’t wanna talk,” Tony says all in one breath, like it’s a goddamn
Maybe Steve can survive.
The funeral is bad. He doesn’t have the words. He is burying children. Steve was always the one who made the speeches.
And then he’s there. Steve’s fingers play over the thing around his wrist. Steve pretends he’s stumbled upon it, every time.
They came out of nowhere, he said, three of them, and something had soured in Tony’s stomach. It was all we could do. Bullets through the dash. The copilot was dead, there was glass in the radio operator’s chest. The pilot was half-dead on the floor.
Tony takes things for granted. It just happens. You slide into something easy and you forget that your paradigm has already been rearranged. That when that something goes, your life will contract to fill that void. You forget that you've already made yourself smaller, the minute you've given something, anything, up.
There's another alpha who touches him, who he's handed off to. He doesn't smell like anything. Tony feels nothing about him.
“I don’t think you’re desperate enough,” Tony whispers in his ear.
not realize), and palms him. Steve can’t stop the gasp from leaving his mouth - he’s still so sensitive, it’s so wrong, it’s so dishonest – and that’s when Tony leans forward and presses their lips together.
Tony feels like his body is buzzing. Steve has solidified, somewhat. He stands in the corner while Tony endures a cavity search, while Tony holds his wrist out to be stamped with the sub dermal barcode they’d designed. He gives them his wallet with his pictures of Rumiko and that day the Avengers first saved the world.
“I’ve been good,” Tony says.
Steve tests his luck, presses his lips to Tony’s neck. He tries to be tender. He wants to be.
He thinks that maybe Leonard is right. That maybe it’s not a problem with Extremis. That maybe he is just a useless, broken man.
Tony doesn't need the bond to sense his increasing desperation. Steve has always been terrible at recognizing his own ineptitude.
It’s such a small human gesture. It melts him.
, the Gibb brothers sing.
The man just kneels there for a moment, breathes on the tip of Steve’s cock, and then he settles, kneels up. Takes the tip of Steve’s cock into his blazing mouth and Steve thinks
He will dress himself in his best suit and he will go before the Committee and he will be asked to prove what an enormous hypocrite he isn’t. Jen says she has a plan. She has given him notes; she has given him things to memorize. He will deliver all of it perfectly and they will still strip him of his position and throw him to the wolves. He knows he’s violated the SHRA on multiple occasions. He wrote it.
He staggers out of bed. His clothes are neatly folded in the armchair, his sketchbook carefully placed on top of them. He flips through it. He’s ripped out most of the pages in this one. Did he do that, was he drunk last night, did he get into one of his moods and destroy things? He’s not supposed to have alcohol with his blood pressure meds but sometimes he does. He finds his wallet, his keys, his phone. He has two missed calls but the number just slides away from him. He rubs at his temples and the joints in his fingers pop with the effort of it.
“I get it,” Tony snaps. He’s picking his way through an enormous plate of sushi. He orders the entire menu every time they order in. The delivery girl has to balance the bag under her chin just to get in the door. He tells Steve he’s entitled; his pleasures are fewer and fewer with the DOD breathing down his neck and his heart –
Shit.
"I honestly thought we were past it," he says quietly, and he turns those infuriatingly blue eyes on Steve's completely unremarkable face. "Clearly I was wrong."
– it didn't
Tony.
He can't imagine what Steve smells on him, if he's even strong enough to put out fight. He should be feeling cornered, but he feels ragged and bright and weightless for the first time in years, and he looks at Steve across the room in his dirty t-shirt with his 4-day stubble and his cock hanging out and despises him.
There are others.
Steve picks up his head, turns his tear-stained face to meet Tony's gaze.
“I got back. Let me take you to the hospital,” Steve says. He is proud of himself for not using the Captain America voice.
He couldn’t tear his eyes from Tony’s. Like it was just the two of them in the whole big empty world.
I'm dying, he tries to explain.
That’s bad, he needs to leave, he needs to look for an exist, there are so many eyes on him –
“I know you’re mad at me, so just, cut it,” Tony says. “I know it’s my fault. I haven’t been paying attention, I didn’t do enough prep for Y2K, I let it happen – no, I did, Steve, it’s my job to think of things other people don’t think of, it’s just. I hate that it turned out the way it did,” he whispers. “It killed Whiplash, Steve, it tried to kill me, it was obsessive and it said it
“You love him,” Strange tells him, and won’t look him in the eye. “That’s what makes it hard.”
Tony makes it through the infection and slams headfirst into a weak half-heat. He spends two nights alone in a fever-sweat with his hand balled up in his mouth, because he is too weak to chase even the urge to stick one of Peter Quill's grimy screwdrivers in his body to feel
Steve? Tony says. Go fuck yourself.
Perfect.
it,” Steve growls. “Get out of my head–”
He knows the voice. He knows it. It’s just out of reach and Steve lies on his back and tries to ignore the pain and looks for the name, he knows he has it, damn it, he knows it, he knows it –
It goes on. Tony told Steve what happened with Mallen but most of it stayed between them, so Maya is able to distill the whole situation with Mallen down to Tony’s ego. Tony’s arrogance.
We're different, Steve says. I'm different.
Tony huffs out an indignant little breath and immediately winces. “No.”
“It didn’t,” Steve says flatly. “They’re different things, Tony, love and obsession–”
couples; Rubell would love to get his hands on you.”
, she says, and he is so fucking sick of hearing his last name. She's got an IV in his arm. He taps it. He doesn't even ask what's in it. He has become so soft and naive and he would let this woman do anything to him because she has a human's face and he's going to die here in the black of space instead of on his stupid useless blue planet.
“Sorry, I’m sorry,” Tony is saying. He’s hiding his face in his own shoulder, one arm thrown over his eyes. “I’m just. Give me a minute.”
The first time is miraculous, even for them. Tony has the scents of so many people on him by the time they even make it into bed. He's old. He has not been careful about who he's let use him. Free with affection, bombarded with heartbreak. Guilty, blown up, shredded, stitched together. And again. Alive until the day he's not.
“– You know, I didn’t
The weight of that goes right to Steve’s cock.
Tony doesn’t pull out.
After Paris, before Tony left and came back with fancy new toys for the rest of the team, they sat on a Quinjet and Tony held a bottle in a paper bag on his lap.
He melts into it. He lets Steve support him, like he can’t bear to be awake for another minute, like his limbs are made of lead. He clings like if he lets go of Steve he’ll lose his tether on reality.
“What’s the big fuckin’ idea,” someone is saying. Laughter, and cursing, from behind him.
Steve sits in the chair on Tony’s left and frowns. The blood trickling out of the corner of his mouth is a fixture, Tony has realized.
He dresses in the dark, slips out of his underwear and slides into his lurid second skin. If he leaves, he doesn’t have to listen to round two. He doesn’t need to fester in his own hideous loneliness. He needs to be elsewhere. Saturday night, he’ll patrol. Maybe he finds someone who needs saving, maybe he finds someone who needs punching. Tony used to call it ‘expressing his rage,’ but Tony was joking.
It occurs to Tony, briefly, ludicrously: he has been circling the drain for so long.
“Tony,” Leonard says. The connotation is clear: incompetent, irresponsible.
“Show yourself,” he yells into the silence of his workshop. The air filter kicks on, but there’s nothing on his scanners, there’s nothing on the security cameras, there have been no electromagnetic disturbances.
Someone is holding a hand-painted sign that says
Jocasta can’t tell him what happened, she was offline. Steve wishes he wasn’t facing whatever this latest trauma has been alone, but Rhodes had to get back to work. It’s just Steve and Tony and Tony’s issues for now. Steve does his lap, does it again, jittery, off-kilter. He should have done more than leave messages when Tony missed the team meeting last week. It’s not like him; Steve should have known better. He has been quietly losing his mind ever since Rhodey called him yesterday from the air.
Tony blows off a meeting at nine, and then a lunch at 1, and a briefing with the Alphas at 3:30.
how wet his cock is –
Steve looks at the thing in his hand and fumbles it; tries to look at the face of the card, he could swear that there’s something there, faded writing - if he looks at it the right way there’s a shadow that looks like it could be –
“I don’t want to talk about it.”
“I’d like that,” Tony whispers, like he’s ashamed.
Steve goes mad with it.
Steve lays his head on the pillow next to Tony’s and listens for signs of trouble, for wheezing, for wet breathing, for the straining and clenching of the walls of Tony’s heart. It’s one thing Steve can do: stand guard against invisible dangers of the flesh.
“This is important, Richards,” Steve snaps. “Look at me.”
Steve shoves into him like Tony's body is his own personal accessory.
Steve pushes his plate away.
“The worst part,” Tony says, with a hollow little laugh, “The worst part is everyone knows I’m not good enough for you,” he finishes in barely a whisper. “I have to convince myself every day, I see you – out there, people love you, Steve.”
Tony, off the wagon for the entire goddamn world to see.
Tony takes it like a physical blow; Steve can see the moment it registers on his face: split-second shame. But Tony has always been clever about his face and everything is clearer now without the haze of smoke and heat and rhythm, it’s all right there, Steve would know him anywhere –
“Hi,” Tony says. “How would you like to fuck me over the balcony, soldier?”
The SHIELD contracts pile up.
This isn’t new. Sometimes, he takes himself off the team. In his head, just for the weekend. He drives out here on his bike and he does normal things, laundry, dishes, runs away from that feeling of
“They should just hang me,” Tony says, but the joke falls dead on arrival and he feels lightheaded and like his limbs are prickling with pins and needles.
Tony’s eyes snap open. “Don’t ruin this,” Tony breathes, and fucks himself down onto Steve’s cock and squeezes his eyes shut.
“Excuse me?” Steve says. His chest feels tight, Tony is between him and the exit, he
Steve eats his Vindaloo. When he finishes, Happy hasn’t come back for him. He walks the nine blocks back to the tower.
Steve thinks his own heart must skip a beat.
“Don’t tease,” Tony all but moans, but he’s levering himself upright, already fitting his body back around Steve’s, curling around him like a snake, wrapping his smaller hand around Steve’s massive fingers, stroking the head of Steve’s cock and all but ignoring his own –
Tony closes his eyes and sees space spool out before him. Blessed, expansive, dark.
“Go fuck yourself,” Tony gasps. His hands are tingling. His heart skips and stutters, feels like it’s dislodged in his chest.
Every nerve in Steve’s body wants to flip Tony over and wipe the sad little self-deprecating smile off his face and prove him wrong.
Sometimes Steve forgets that Tony's body is older, that he has accumulated decades of injury and trauma. That it's not always a matter of fighting.
Tony doesn’t meet his eyes. “And I didn’t mind it,” he says, like if he wants it badly enough Steve won’t hear it, maybe.
“You fell,” she tells him. “You just – you fell.”
like this. Tony wants to memorize it, he is seized by a recklessness, a greed, a hunger that will never be satisfied.
Tony finds himself sliding away and squeezes his hand to call up the pain of his broken bones.
nothing
Steve turns away from him. If Tony could smell him, he knows his hackles would be up.
Don't fucking touch me, Tony snarls. It comes out as more of a slur. Too much Androderm, too many raging Alpha pheromones on his skin, rubbed into his mucous membranes, dripping into his eyes. How dare he. It threatens to swarm him. Tears prick in his gummy eyes. How
Tony feels pressure behind his teeth, and moans.
A toady little man with a greasy goatee and an ugly shirt steps into Steve’s space like it’s his god-given right, looks at Steve’s heaving bare chest and stands on his toes to meet Steve’s eyes, his muscle shifting in the background.
Tony nods, presses his forearm over his eyes, spreads his legs.
The metal snaps into shards. Less flexible than the last iteration. Tony can make him a new one when he’s feeling better. No one needs him that desperately.
A moan tears from his chest, low and ragged and filthy.
He tries to imagine Tony is in his armor, that they’re somewhere else in a better time. Tony’s kiss is so gentle, so tentative, so different than Steve imagined. Tony kisses like it’s the last one he’ll ever get. He nips a little, nibbles at Steve’s bottom lip, soothes the edge of it away with his tongue. He tastes like Steve’s come and the martini he was drinking and the pit in Steve’s stomach widens and –
“I’m not perfect,” Steve says, and it comes out angrier than he really wants. Tony sighs.
Tony drags himself back from wherever he’s gone, blinks at him, once, twice. His eyes get a little sharper. “I wish you would,” he says, quietly.
Tony dips his head, and when he picks it back up, there are tears streaming down his face.
His suit gleams in the moonlight spilling in through the window.
. You made this for me.”
“All day, then.”
“No,” Steve says. “Because you’re
“Rhodey didn’t call Ru,” Tony says. “He fucking called you, Steve, he brought me here because Rumiko doesn’t know who I am,” he says, and he laughs like something is rattling loose in him. “This armor,” Tony says, equal parts reverence and horror. “It came alive on its own but I’m the one that made it, it sampled everything I’ve ever felt and it still built itself around fear and violence, it fucking –
He crawls into Steve’s unmade bed and props himself there and blushes and waits for Steve to follow him.
Steve breaks the mug. He’s vaguely aware of the coffee spilling over the side of the counter. He steers himself to the sink, tears in his eyes. He fumbles with the faucet, runs his hand under cold water. It doesn’t matter, he’ll heal. Nothing is permanent.
Steve lies behind him; he's already taken that liberty. The room is dark. The beeping of the heart monitor and the tubing running from his elbow and the hot mass of Steve's bulk on his scant nothing is enough to make him feel like he's suffocating.
“Tony,” Steve starts, and he wants to be mad but all he can focus on is the way Tony’s hands are kneading at his arm, the way his chest feels gaping and open.
Tony lets out an ugly laugh and runs his hands over his face. He nods to himself and bites at his lip and smiles a dead smile.
Steve’s anger doesn’t evaporate, just stacks and folds and collapses into a tight parcel that settles deep in his stomach. He can table the ugly things he wants to shout at Tony, why didn’t you fucking call me and why didn’t you tell me and why aren’t you ok.
Tony nods. "I didn't," he starts. Sucks in a deep breath. "Let me get you off."
and has the gall to say, “I love you.”
Steve thinks, ruefully: Tony would maybe like a place like this.
He slams the car door as hard as he can, but he’s just human now, it’s just him and his liver spots and his broken rotator cuff. The car is fine. Nothing is damaged. He can’t even fall back on his anger, not like he used to. He sits there and looks in the mirror and thinks about that beautiful woman Tony is fucking and wonders why he can’t just move on, too.
I can still feel you, Steve says, in his softest voice. Like he is terrified.
“Shh,” Tony soothes, and he presses a hand over Steve’s eyes. “You don’t have to look,” Tony is whispering. “I know it riles you up. Just chase it, Steve, hump my leg, that’s how you get off, show me how grateful you are–”
“You don’t get to have this,” Steve spits. “You don’t get to
“I used to think you were perfect,” Tony says.
“I’m never going to be past it, Tony,” Steve says. “And I don’t want to see you again.”
Are you okay, Tony asks him more than once, because he is indisputably fragile, now, and Steve's sadness has always been fucking unbearable.
Tony has a way of putting Steve’s darkness in perspective.
Even Steve’s feet are meaty and broad. Tony trails a finger over the bottom of his foot and he can see the determination radiate out from Steve’s heaving chest, one group of muscles at a time exercising exquisite restraint, Steve resolutely avoiding even a glance at Tony’s face. He doesn’t move enough even to make the chains clink.
He is taken back to the Helicarrier on a Quinjet, fussed over in medical, given time to call his armor and pull himself the fuck together, and then he is escorted to his mandatory psych evaluation.
“I wrote them,” Steve tells him. “I think they’re mine.” He reads one, and Tony watches as his face starts to go hard.
Clarity is slipping away from him, there’s just warmth and need and urgency. He wants to stop being upright like this, he wishes Tony would just plant a foot in the small of his back and tip him onto the carpet face-first, hump him into the rug, pull the strap on his collar again, he wants all of the noise
Tony lays him back, lowers him more slowly than is required for what Steve is. Steve loves this, loves going limp, loves being arranged and not asked about it. He’s very hard, very wet, glistening with arousal, jerking every time Tony puts his hands on him.
. “Fuck,” He pulls out his wallet and feeds a black credit card into the lock, angles it back and forth, but the door stays solidly closed. He tugs a flask out of his pocket and sips.
“My name is Tony,” he says into the empty space.
, he wants to say, but he feels as though he has been bolted to his seat. Maya is saying Tony hired her to control the research.
Steve feels as though he has stepped into the underworld he is certain the sweat from this man’s skin will be sweeter than any pomegranate.
– not the idle greed he sometimes feels when he sees a beautiful person, but the ravenous hunger he knows won’t leave him until he’s had this man in his mouth.
Okay, Steve whispers hysterically to himself, once he's off the phone. He moves around the room. He sheds his clothes. He smells like warm null. Okay, he says again. He washes off the masking cream with shaking hands. He drops the bottle of pills he's trying to open. He climbs in behind Tony. He rubs his hand over the bond scar on Tony's neck.
, Steve is saying.
“Tony,” Leonard says sharply. “I need you to sit down.”
“No,” Tony says sharply, and whirls around. “No, you don’t fucking deserve to know. You don’t get to know what’s going on with me anymore.
He’s not here as a hero tonight; he threw that excuse away the minute he let the man at the door undress him with his eyes and stepped through the doors on his own two feet. He has spent so long feeling old and he has hidden himself away and here, he’s just another beautiful body.
Tony laughs; it’s not kind. He bends, kneels, takes Steve in hand. Steve is leaking; he can smell his own arousal, can smell Tony’s, can feel his balls brushing the carpet. Tony rolls them in his hand, feels out the shape of each one with his fingers. Rests them in his palm like he’s gauging Steve’s enthusiasm.
Tony turns so Steve can look at all of him. Very deliberately places the jock on the section of the divan within arms’ reach of Steve. Sinks to his knees. Locks eyes with Steve and crawls until he’s right there at Steve’s side, below him, beside him. Tony knows better than to take initiative right now, so he settles on his knees and splays his hands flat and doesn’t touch his own hard cock. He leans one of his cheeks against Steve’s leathered thigh. He lets himself rest, a conscious decision - all of the tension goes out of him.
Michael tells Gary to scoot up, there you go – and Steve watches a roach scuttle across the ceiling. He ekes his hand under the waistband of his boxers. Harder, Gary says, and sometimes he sounds just a little bit like Tony, the edge of a growl in his voice like when he used to get angry. Their bed knocks against the wall they share with Steve, and Steve cups himself and imagines it’s him, imagines it’s Tony above him –
Steve glares. “Yeah, I love you, too. Start talking or I’m putting my clothes on and walking out the door, Tony,” he snaps.
“You didn’t know, it’s–,” Steve says. “It’s ok, I’m sorry, it’s, Tony–”
Steve looks at Tony’s chest, at the lines of his thighs, at his cock starting to plump out against his thigh.
He should go see Tony in person, but he knows if he does, he’s going to have to look at Tony. He'll have to behold Tony's grief and Tony's shame and he'll get upset again. He'll lose what little nerve he has.
Steve pulls his mangled leg out from under him and Tony bashes his head into the floor trying to overcome the pain.
“People are out there on the deck of your ship waiting for
Steve does his best, but he can only do so much. He finds an expensive jar of aloe under Tony’s sink, rubs it between his palms and then massages it into Tony’s too-tanned skin. He takes Tony’s face gently in his hands and cradles his cheeks, wipes away his dirty tear tracks, feels the sunburn-heat coming off Tony’s skin.
Tony's skin is on fire. He tries to shift around in bed, thinks distantly of levering himself up and into the shower, and pain shoots up his spine. His pelvis burns. He fumbles one hand behind him to try and pull out the plug but it's agony to move.
Okay, Steve says softly. Easy, he says.
Tony stops squirming and leans his weight back and resolutely doesn’t meet Steve’s eyes.
Tony presses a hand over his belly, where his sleeve is, where his little controller sits and runs his heart.
Tony is hours, maybe days away from collapsing and drawing Steve with him.
The minute Tony’s pants make it past his knees, Steve is on him, flipping him around – it’s rougher than he should be, but he
No, Tony says. Knot me.
- - -
s that are just quiet enough that Tony can’t hear them.
The moon is breaking through the clouds, now, the sky has cleared. He can see how deep the blue of Tony’s eyes runs. A traffic light at an empty intersection behind Tony flips to green.
,” he snarls.
but his shirt tangles around his biceps and Tony is already there, easing it down off his wrists and already working on Steve’s fly –
Steve, Tony tries. You're not yourself. You put yourself in rut. You're hurting me.
Something stirs in his hindbrain. He distantly wants to allow Steve to take more. The impulse is buried, but not gone. He wants to be gracious.
“I feel like we’re not going to be able to do this for much longer,” Tony says curtly. “So I’d like to just enjoy it.”
“Liar,” Tony says, his heart beating out of his chest. They have onlookers; people are moving out of the way to stop and watch and kiss their lovers. Like they’re a show. Like they’re live-action foreplay. He hopes no one has a Polaroid. He misses Damage Control. The guy holds him with one arm but Tony knows that even if he dropped all of his own weight right now, he wouldn’t fall. He thinks maybe they call that trust.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, completely without guile. “I just – you look like a marine, you carry yourself – I should have thought. People come here to forget about the war. I’m sorry.”
Tony looks like he wants to say something cutting and glib, but it passes over his face and resolves itself into hot arousal-shame. He ducks his face, like there’s anywhere for him to hide here. “I love that you made this for me,” he says hoarsely. “I’m so hot,” he whispers. “Conceptually hot. Jesus, Steve. The things I would do for you.”
“Steve,” Tony says, sharper, and grabs his wrist – his fingers barely fit around Steve’s massive forearm. “Fuck me like you mean it,” Tony says, and props himself up on his shoulders.
He has fantasized every flavor of reconciliation. He has bargained, in the dark: anything to have the taste of Steve's skin one more time. One more moment of the softness of his voice in Tony's ear. He kept telling himself that if he willed reunion to be, then eventually it would be. That Steve would recant. That Steve would apologize. That the entire world would turn on its axis so they could be together again.
He smiles because he doesn’t want Steve to see him cry, not like this.
Tony thinks that isn’t fair. He’s crying again, his tears are running sideways down his face and dripping off his chin.
Tony gets it now. He seems him across the dance floor and it’s
“I was trying to do something for me,” Steve chokes. “I didn’t know,” he starts.
Tony's head pounds. The resonance of her anger seeps in from the other end of the wing, makes him dizzy. Both of them are too fucking angry to be quiet; the scent of
“Which one are you,” Tony says to the tile floor.
Steve strains to kiss him and Tony pinches the swell of Steve’s ass.
“Do you want to say something,” Steve says.
that Steve doesn’t even realize Tony’s tongue is in his mouth until he’s pulling back.
The steps to the podium feel impossible. He wants to climb right into Steve’s empty grave.
Steve stills and feels his stomach twist into something ugly and cold.
He hits the ground, grits out a scream as he falls on his hands. He tries to kick but his feet are shackled together and all he manages is a pathetic little jerk.
“So you don’t like this?” Tony rolls his entire pelvis like a brat, his eyes half-open, his expression lazy and unconcerned.
He’s so single-minded. Tony would laugh at him. People
He still dreams about it, sometimes, of kneeling over him in the street with his shield held ready to fall, or of shaking hands and pressing that electron-scrambler onto Tony’s glove and watching his face crumble with a new kind of betrayal. He remembers feeling smug. He remembers thinking:
“Do you want to dance?” Tony says.
“Yeah, that’s the problem,” Tony says.
Steve keeps trying. Keeps moving in him. Not yet, he says. He presses his cheek to Tony's, buries his head in Tony's pillow. Tangles his hands in the sheets so they're not touching more than they need to be.
His heart does not beat wildly in his chest. His cock is soft against his leg. There are no chills, no rush of affection, no matching thrill from Steve.
“No, no, no, Steve, Steve, wait,” Tony says, and clutches at his arm. It’s so blatantly affectionate, so unlike Tony, that it staggers him for a moment.
Tony starts to cry again.
“Your throat feels like it was meant for this,” Tony slurs, and stars dance behind Steve’s eyes.
- - -
Steve has no intention of letting it go that far.
“You can pretend,” Tony says, and lowers his voice to that cadence he keeps for his lovers. “We can both pretend?” Steve lets his eyes drift back to Tony’s eyes, and that’s a mistake; he can’t stop looking. Steve wants him, all of him, friend and lover and teammate and confidant, wants all of him from the eyeliner to the cut of his clothes and the hair curling over his brow. He’s wringing his hands, he’s barely hard. His nose is bleeding. “I could go all night with you,” Tony tells him, and Steve actually balls up his fist.
- - -
“I love you,” Steve tells him, because he can never say it enough, because he has a year and some days of lost time to make up for, time that Tony is never getting back, and despite – or because of - having come back to life several times himself, he lives in constant fear of tomorrow, the what-ifs drumming madly through his head in the still hours, in the dark. What if he leaves you. What if he dies again. What if
– maybe you're just not a very good spy, Steve is saying. We - he was very careful, he hedges. Nat goes up on her toes and scents him. Tony can just see the back of her body, the way she eclipses Steve's hulking, sullen self.
The man says: “Steve, fucking say something, what’s wrong.”
The problem is Steve thinks he’s special. Steve thinks Tony holds him to different standards, and he’s
The screaming feels distant. Steve’s face looks softer. Kind, maybe, if Tony didn’t know better. The old anger is slipping from him. The disappointment in his eyes is a little harder to see.
Steve has begged for it in the past, so when Tony brings it out and Steve sees a doting partner, a considerate lover, his own pleasure the focus. There is a sacred moment when Steve goes still, after Tony has buckled the contraption around his head, when he settles and his energy stills and he stops carrying the weight of the world for a little while.
“Stop,” he croaks, and someone kicks him in the throat.
He doesn't say
Tony sighs and stiffens and Steve knows it’s over.
“I’m not fighting,” Steve moans, and another wave of pain seizes him. The feelings spike, too: the sensation that he’s forgotten to do something, that he is on the precipice of disaster. He retches over the nice man’s lap and gets some vomit on his pant leg.
You can't, Tony spits. We both know you can't.
Tony’s dreams are no longer his own.
When Tony inhales, he smells the desert. He smells the dank of the cave, and the precise reek of the way he puked in his suit when he went through the wormhole and he tastes the dust on Titan when Thanos put Tony's own armor through his body.
Tony pulls away and digs his finger into Steve’s slit and holds Steve through the aborted scream he lets out.
, pulls him in and turns their kiss filthier, more desperate.
“You know, we had bets for awhile, before they asked me to
Tony leans back and reaches one hand up to feel the side of Steve’s cheek.
"I love you," Steve tells him.
Tony is crying again. It just climbs up and spills out of him, like there’s no stopgap at all. Like he’s a poorly engineered dam, one flood away from catastrophe. He’s crying over letters. They’re not even love letters.
He doesn’t even remember most of the hospital. He’s miles away, years away and back, he is thinking of all the times he’s had to hold someone as their body failed. The memories crawl up like worms, the smell of blood and the desperate feeling of not enough and too late. Tony is being wheeled through sliding doors and Steve can run a two minute mile but he staggers against the wall because all he can think about is the soft sound someone’s heart makes when it slows and dies and stops beating for good.
“Tony,” Steve hears himself say. Tony had a heart attack, he’d thought this was over, he’d thought that this was a thing he didn’t have to constantly worry about anymore, the chest plate is gone, god, if he has to go back into it Steve thinks he’s going to die –
Steve is quiet beside him. They sit like that, watching the late afternoon light filter in through the stained glass over the picture window.
Tony sits there, frozen, with the silence stretched out between them, Steve just out of his reach. Blood sliding out of his mouth.
Steve groans and heaves and rolls over onto his back, as if Tony has drawn the last of his strength from him. He’s sliding into his bashful moments, one arm thrown over his face as if anything could disguise the bright pink flush creeping into his cheeks.
“I don’t,” Steve sputters. “What?”
“Steve, please just do something,” Tony says to the ceiling. “Just tell me you want me,” he says, soft enough for a normal man to miss.
“Steve,” Tony croaks, and it’s not what he said the first time, but the scene plays on.
Tony lets that hang and then tears are just sliding out of his eyes again.
Shh -
The tower locks him out, even with his voice confirmation – he can’t use Extremis to interface and it’s a Friday and there’s no one to let him in because the movers are gone and Pepper despises him despite what she says about it and everyone is running from him and Maya is gone and Steve is dead –
It’s a glitch, it’s just. It’s a glitch.
Steve’s face is hot; he feels it all the way down his chest. Part of him dies, because he had never imagined: Tony shares his own secret shame. What does he say.
You fucking abandoned me, Tony tells him. And I can't even smell you. I can't tell if you've been fucking someone else.
“Did you have a good time, soldier,” the man asks, and the cadence of his voice is so –
Steve wears crisp slacks and a jacket and a dress shirt buttoned all the way up. He limps to their booth like an old man and gets some cruel measure of satisfaction out of the way that Tony hovers like he doesn’t know what to say, what to do, how to help.
“Dance with me,” he says, and the man spins around to look at him.
He sucks Tony’s cock into his mouth, briefly – he’s not as skilled as Tony but he can do the job, he can coax blood back into him, he can set Tony’s breath off into an uneven cant and tear the smallest of moans from his throat and even though he feels like he’s ruined everything since he walked into the room, he can do this for Tony, he can use his strength for love instead of war.
Tony lets himself have the almost-silence, runs his hands over the silk of his vest, loosens his tie, waits for the world to recede into something better, something nicer, something less wild and sharp. Euphoria without connotation. Better to do it here than the main level; there are cameras sometimes. He thinks about the team seeing photos of him here, imagines Jan’s face. He should have talked to Rubell about that. Pepper doesn’t even tell him he needs to get out more, anymore, she just tells him his schedule and gives him his coffee and looks like she’s going to cry when he tips Jack into his cup.
“Can I kiss you,” Steve says, and brushes Tony’s hair out of his eyes.
“I think I liked you better when you were a stranger,” Tony tells him, and Steve loses some of his breath.
Steve moves so fast it’s embarrassing.
“– not gonna lie, this is bad, ok, you’re lucky Maria pulled out her dick and took a page out of your book and found some obscure bylaw in your stupid fucking bill that gives her jurisdiction over convicted Metahumans–”
- - -
Tony slides his cock against Steve’s face. Tony’s well-groomed, and his pubes scratch at Steve’s cheek. It leaves Steve with a pleasant stinging burn; affection laced with pain just feels like pleasure, now. Tony is loosening: his stance widens, he relaxes his muscles like he’s finished a particularly satisfying round of stretches. Steve keeps his mouth open, ready, tries not to be needy about it. He fails; he’s transparent, he’s panting and he’s drooling down his chin and Tony just runs the head of his cock all around Steve’s lips, lets Steve smell how wet he is, lets Steve suffer.
Nat, once, Steve whispers, and it's not the answer Tony wants.
and the crowd roars like it’s about to riot.
The split-second of relief that follows Tony's orgasm is hollow. The clock starts again. The lies come back. Everything comes back.
- - -
“Around,” Steve says. “Tony,
Tony feels his neck snapping and then he’s in his bed again.
“Better?” Steve lets himself smile. He almost feels it. This thing can be salvaged, he knows it.
- - -
He slides one of his hands into Steve's. Slides his fingers up Steve's wrist to where -
Please what, Tony. Steve rolls his hips and Tony holds himself taut, unmoving. Like if he is still enough, if he complies just enough to weather this coupling, maybe he can survive.
“No,” Steve says, and it’s a lie, he has several things to be doing, but Tony needs him and Tony is so warm and he’s
“Ok,” Steve says, and lets go long enough to slide around the coffee table to sit next to Tony. “We’ll deal with it, we’ve done it before and we’ll do it again,
Tony unbuttons his vest, drapes it over the couch. He slips out of his pants, so tense, so elegant, such anger in his muscles, such deliberacy. Steve knows what that is, recognizes it easily. Tony is at war.
He imagines his funeral: closed casket, maybe a handful of people standing around a shallow grave if there’s any justice. He thinks about Steve’s.
But he thinks it. He thinks it's and it's the indulgent choice, the choice that doesn't preserve him, the choice that quickens the flood and drowns him in the dark of space, until all he can feel is the empty and the shuddering of the craft and the quiet hiss of the oxygen mask someone is holding gently to his face.
Tony fucks up into his mouth and it gets a little better.
His most reliable anchor is dead.
Tony inhales sharply. “I mean, you don’t have to lie,” Tony says.
Tony opens his mouth to say something about the tears leaking out of Steve's eyes and Steve gives a barely-perceptible shake of his head, holds one finger to his lips.
Tony’s gaze settles somewhere to the left of Steve’s face.
A crash, from the bathroom, and Steve is keying up to fight, the bed is empty and unmade and stained with Tony’s blood and –
“Hey,” Steve says, and
I hate you, Tony tells him, and he hopes Steve can feel every fetid inch of it.
Tony thinks he might be drowning in his own blood.
That’s how they find him: propped up in one corner, lying in his own blood, his foot half-severed, shaking with laughter, his eyes white and blank.
“I’d have to be crazy,” he murmurs. He thinks he passably pulls off repentance. “Talk to me,” he says.
“You’re not the best at reading people,” Steve says.
He gets to one of Steve’s oldest helmets, holds it in his hands, brushes his thumb over the a rendered in lead paint.
Steve sits in the chair that's too small for his thighs. He looks out the window. He nods to himself.
Tony lets the collar out, and Steve gasps for air, tips his head into Tony’s bare shoulder. Tony runs his fingers through his hair.
“You had two heart attacks!” Steve roars at him. “You disappear and instead of seeking medical care like a normal person you experiment on yourself–”
I love you, Steve whispers against his skin. I know – I'm sorry. Tony.
“It’s been said,” says Steve, and places his feet back where they were. Tony makes a sub-vocal cry of dismay and turns back to the mirror. “Your color is whatever I say it is.”
“You could tell me about it,” Steve counters, ever the reasonable one.
Steve’s face
- - -
The technician looks up from her clipboard. “Sir?”
“Did you get a recess,” Tony hears himself say.
He smells like Steve.
He pins Tony and it feels like the edge of catastrophe, like Tony singlehandedly holds the power to make Steve do something unforgivable. Tony hasn’t managed to write out the thrill that comes from that, from knowing that they looking into the abyss together, that they are a few hasty decisions away from never recovering from this.
“Look at me,” Steve says.
. It echoes through him
Reed slides it open and stares at the three fingers that roll out into his lap. One with Reed’s wedding band still on, two tiny thumbs.
He sidles into Tony’s space. “King of the world,” Steve says.
,” Steve says, and whirls around so he can gesture at Tony’s whole body. “I don’t know what’s going on with you, I don’t like that this is the second time in two months that you’ve almost died–”
Tony wakes up right as the drone explodes in a fire burst several thousand feet above him.
It’s not Tony, and Steve ends up standing under a flickering streetlight while three gorgeous women giggle at him. One of them reminds him of Sharon: she wears soft pink lipstick and a silk shirt and no bra. Her friend wears gold eye shadow and hoop earrings and a gold scarf around her afro. Her outfit is bright red.  “Mister, it’s not costume night,” she tells him.
Almost as blond as Steve, Tony thinks, and eyes almost as blue beneath the mask that covers half his face. He’s dressed like that vigilante no one could track down, the one they all placed bets on. Wayfarer, or something. Rover? Tony thinks he used to have a cape. Tony’s not stupid enough to think he’s actually the same guy, probably just a lookalike – but it doesn’t stop the smirk from crossing his face. Rubell must have been foaming at the mouth.
Steve's nostrils flare. I don't fully understand what I did wrong, Steve says, a quite storm churning just under his smooth, no-bullshit voice. Steve is paradoxical, containing of multitudes, such guile and such naked conviction in the same breath. I was protecting you. I was protecting him. Do you understand what he is to me? No. You can't. You come from the now and I come from the past, and there will always be this gulf between us and you only ever look forward, Tony, do you know what you are
They’re going to have words. Steve doesn’t want Tony’s pity or his useless gestures.
But Steve doesn’t answer to anybody anymore and this man’s mouth is plush and wicked.
He hopes it's enough. He doesn't know how to say that he's been busy dying while Steve has been busy cowering.
Tony balls it up in his hand.
He slides around behind steve, presses his hands to the flat of Steve’s chest. Tony is not in a generous mood tonight; he gives only what he has to – a single caress to Steve’s right nipple, the suggestion of playing with Steve’s painfully hard cock, one feather-light kiss to Steve’s shoulder blade. Steve would like to think it’s preoccupation but nothing is uncalculated, anymore, between them.
, Tony takes it all, seals their lips together, darts his tongue out like he’s sampling a delicacy straight from Steve’s mouth. Steve thinks he’s moaning, Tony is certainly touching him, now, he’s using his own come and rubbing it under the head of Steve’s cock and Steve bites at his lip and lets the rest of it go, lets himself be a sloppy fucking mess so Tony can see what he’s done.
He laughs. Something old and ingrained lets him know that it’s inappropriate to the situation. Something about it must make the guards nervous. The meds are blocking the ugly things festering in him and his laughter is shallow, without roots. Unsatisfying. A mimicry of authentic wit.
They’re not staring at Steve, and he finds that something ugly and thrilling is rising in him.
“I didn’t come here to dance,” Mystery Man says, and rolls his groin into Tony’s.
just fuck me, ok–”
Steve laughs. “You love coffee,” he says.
The dizziness hits him all at once and he falls, hard. He lands on his back, the wind punched out of him. He’s making a noise, a wheezing moaning noise, the pain crawls up his spine and radiates down his leg and he reminds himself that he is an old man and old men break hips and the voice on the other end of the card is tinny and distorted and every word sends a spike of pain through his head –
Tony likes to do this, now. Make him wait. Monologue. Tony makes the speeches, Tony deals out the hurt.
Are you really mad at me, Tony says, or do you just want to fuck me.
he’s saying.
He slides onto the dance floor and tries not to think about the feel of Steve’s body on his and the gaping hole behind his ribs and his garbage legacy.
Not Steve as Tony knew him, but Steve as Tony grew up with – leather jacket over burnished blue scale armor, his helmet painted differently, brown boots, brown pouches, blood on his knuckles and a split lip, his shield speckled with the ghosts of deflected bullets.
The washcloth goes away. Agony floods back momentarily. Tony keens.
Steve slides over the arm of one of the armchairs to sit across the coffee table. “He’s not gonna join,” Steve sighs.
Tony sighs. “We
“Did someone do this to you,” Steve repeats. “Tony, does Bethany know you’re-”
, Steve, no one else gives me a pass, why do you–”
,” Steve says. “Don’t act like you cared about me, Stark–”
He should have known. Light's not the same on earth as it is up in the black. Steve's been nova since the dawn of time.
Tony doesn’t look, doesn’t breathe, keeps his gaze fixed on one of the turrets and his suit locked down tight and tells himself this is just one hell of a bug.
, and
There was a golden age, he thinks, when he really, honestly believed he was bulletproof. That no matter how bad it got, no matter how many nights he spent drinking himself to sleep, no matter how many close calls when his heart was in shreds in his chest, he couldn’t picture it. The nightmares were about everyone else: Pepper, Happy, Steve. Bethany. Rumiko.
“I miss you,” Tony says, shaking. “If I – I want you to be here. I want things to be like they used to be.”
Steve’s shield crunches into his mouth.
“He met his hero,” Tony says, and tries to swallow his own blood. “He was ready to be disappointed. Truth is never the same as legend.”
“No one did this to me, no one – I don’t have a fucking – pimp, or whatever you think. It’s my business,” he says, and his voice is harder now. “It’s my business who I fuck and what I put in my body and I’m perfectly capable of driving myself into the ground without your help.” His eyes go unfocused and slide up away from Steve’s face. “Not that you were around,” Tony says.
“Mm,” Steve says, and fishes out the fun part of the jock. “That’s too bad.” He presses his face into Tony’s fragrant hair so he can whisper. “If only you had a benevolent keeper.”
“I can see it’s a bad time,” Tony says, finally. His face settles into something distant and businesslike and Christ, Steve is so fucking tired of masks. “I know you’re under a lot of stress,” Tony carries on, and he hops off the stool, grabs his stupid file folder and pats his pockets like he’s looking for his wallet.
I don't believe you, he hisses.
He does everything right. He sits before the commission and doesn’t look at the cameras and he fits his face into a smile and he doesn’t lie: yes, he gave the order to enter Chinese airspace, yes, he allowed a malicious neoplasm based on an extremis variant to infect his hardware and therefore compromised national security, yes, he led the response team in Omaha that got three of his team killed, yes, he threatened Paragon with bodily harm in that hospital, yes, he neglected his duties as Director of SHIELD, yes, he concealed the deterioration of his own mental health and people died for it.
It’s so gentle.
“Sorry, I’m sorry,” Tony says. He touches his shoulder, flicks his gaze up just for it to skitter away from Steve’s eyes.
Steve feels exposed, feels violent and blunt and ashamed of what he is, how he is when he comes here to rattle himself around until he feels like he can rejoin the living. He doesn’t expect visitors. Tony always blindsides him.
Tony nods, numb, dazed.
The danger with Tony is his certainty. It’s where all of their fallings out have come from; it’s why the Civil War got as ugly as it did. It’s why Tony deleted his memory instead of letting time heal his wounds. It’s why their arguments are always so ugly, why they end in shouting and tears (Tony’s) and time spent away from each other. You fight like hell, Jim had said once. It’s not untrue.
“Go back to work, Steve,” Tony says. “People need you.”
“These are,” Steve says weakly, and his cock feels ten times harder. He tries again and it sends a pleasant burn all through his thighs, his shoulders, his arms. There’s nothing he can do. “These are new.”
Steve has a thousand barbs for that: for someone so concerned with appearances, he’s doing a shit job of sticking himself together with glue. Where’s his genius now. Where’s the guy on the cover of Forbes. Why won’t he fix himself, why won’t he let them install the pacemaker? Why doesn’t he work with that asshole Richards on a solution instead of fucking away every waking hour playing chess like a useless old man?
Tony rolls over onto his back. “Let’s just sleep,” he says, like he’s a thousand miles away. “I'm sorry. Just be here with me.”
“Go away,” Tony snaps, but his voice is unsteady. “Fucking leave me alone–”
“Don’t be coy, darling,” Tony says, and there might be venom there if there wasn’t bone-deep exhaustion. “Who hired you?”
Something crosses Strange’s face. Like the enormity of what he’s done is only now occurring to him.
Lower your voice, says Steve.
Steve’s spandex leaves little to the imagination, and the man cups Steve’s balls through his pants, gently, hefts the weight of him in his palm. “You’re big,” he says, all throat, with the sort of gravel that chain-smokers have. He trails the tip of his finger over the head of Steve’s cock where it’s pressing up against the seam.
He is flying over the dark ocean. The ground recedes below him and Tony watches the snow-covered mountains fade into a single icy topography, pockmarked by outcroppings of bare stone.
“Things like what,” Steve croaks.
I need to
, Tony had said once, when Tony still said things like that and he had the lungs to double over in laughter or shout at Steve until he was hoarse.
He’s never kissed a man with stubble before. He can’t bring himself to kiss the guy on the lips: he still feels like an island, like he’s been out in the cold too long to get it right, so he fits his lips under the line of the man’s jaw. Stubble scrapes at his lips but he finds he’s grateful for it. It’s almost warmth, almost a connection. A frisson of anticipation runs through him: how will morning find him, stumbling in at the crack of dawn with his lips swollen and his costume stained? He tries to be gentle, because he knows that his gentle is still rougher than most normal people are asking for. He could bruise, if he’s not careful. He could snap this man’s neck if he lost control.
Cheer up, Shellhead.
“Okay, well,” Tony says, with something faux-bright and ugly laced into his voice. “It's a gift. It’s like when I sold it to Luke for a dollar and you guys fought over teams.”
There’s a misery here, too, thought. It’s just too high to notice. You think something is going to last forever – the war, the team, the party – and it ends. Everything ends.
“What the fuck did I do to you,” Tony says.
Steve’s cheeks feel hot when he imagines asking for that.
Tony has the
“Ok,” he says through the voice filter. “Ok.”
“I sent you a phone,” Steve croaks. “I meant it, Tony–”
Steve thinks if it’s good enough for Tony, it’s good enough for him.
Steve holds him until the guards show up. “You don’t get to leave me alone,” Steve whispers fiercely. “You’re stuck with me.”
It takes him an hour, but he finds what he’s looking for in the bottom of the first crate.
Tony pulls out and Steve coughs and chokes and gasps.
he says. He slides into panic and gulps in breaths of air and moans because his ribs are broken. Steve holds his body and feels his lungs fill with air, feels his bones shift beneath his burning skin, brushes dirt and grit out of his hair.
“I can’t drink that,” Tony says quietly, nodding at the coffee.
He’s ushered through the velvet rope and through the doors emblazoned with a large 54 and into a tiny foyer. “Fifteen,” the man says with a gummy smile.
Steve covets it; it so rarely happens. Steve needs to know what nerve he’s hit. He wants to hit it repeatedly for the rest of their lives. He has half a mind to tell him: cancel everything and kneel there and don’t you dare move, I’m getting my sketchbook.
“That’s stupid,” Steve says, and Steve’s hand is on his, Steve’s fingers are guiding Tony’s hand to an open, the shield strapped to his wrist. “You need to call for help.”
Everyone wanted Steve’s stories. They weren’t easily pried from him, you always had to tease it out of Steve. The Smithsonian came once or twice, college interns working on oral history projects for NPR, and it was always Steve and a recorder in a locked room. But sometimes you’d get it. Sometimes he’d smile, big and easy, and tell you a story like it happened last week, like what came before or after wasn’t ugly senseless death.
Steve slams the coffeepot on the counter just hard enough for a spider web crack to sneak up the side of the carafe.
Tony slaps him, backhanded, and Steve does it again, whatever the opposite of progressive muscle relaxation is, tenses himself one group at a time, locks down his pleasure.
Tony sits on the floor. Once the armor has been called, once he has been swaddled in red and gold, he locks down the tower and brings the Faraday cage down and locks the workshop and scans and scans and scans.
Tony.
Tony drops his gun, holds his arms in front of him, curls himself in a ball, blinks sweat and dirt and blood out of his eyes, and catches a glimpse of bright shining blue before something connects with his head and he roars with pain.
He is not, Steve snaps, and it's real yelling, Alpha yelling that would have brought Tony to his knees once upon a time. I thought he was dead, I thought I was just going to carry this around until I die, it's
Tony traces the lines of Steve’s pecs in lieu of an answer, touches Steve’s abs, leans down to drag his tongue over drags a finger through his bronze pubes. “Don’t worry about it, Winghead,” he says, like that’s it, like that’s the last word.
and then the man slides his mouth all the way down and Steve feels his nose nudging against his pubes.
“An hour,” Tony says.
Tony shifts his weight and Steve has to swallow down a gasp because even though he’s going a little soft, he can feel everything, he’s still inside, and this is the wrong time and place to be having this conversation –
“How could you do that,” is what Steve says.
Steve isn’t going to conquer this mountain today.
“Tony,” Steve says, and tries to move, but Tony digs his nails into Steve’s hand.
Steve picks up Tony’s helmet and tears it apart as if it were made of paper.
Reed starts to cry, but he’s nodding.
Tony closes his eyes and wishes he had signed a DNR.
Tony’s hand stays limp, but at least he doesn’t pull away this time, he just sighs like all the fight leaves him at once and finally, finally leans in to Steve’s shoulder. Hides his face. Steve feels a wet spot forming on his sleeve that they’ll never discuss, later. They won’t discuss any of this, later.
Steve doesn’t know what makes him do it: he reaches up a shaking hand to touch the man’s beard. He traces a cheekbone with his fingers. He wipes at a tear inching down his nose.
Stop, Steve says, an octave below his normal register. You can't wake up the kids. Don't make the bed squeak. He puts one of his fingers shiny with Tony's slick to his lips and tastes it like it's nothing.
Steve wants to die.
Tony tries again for a kiss, but Mystery Man plants a hand on Tony’s chest. Nudges his other hand up under Tony’s ass and jerks him closer, watches Tony’s face, inscrutable. Tony can’t stop looking at his mouth, at the way his lips part.
Now, though.
That’s over.
that rears its head when he thinks he’s really, truly, about to die.
“I’m going to a support group,” Tony says, and Steve slips up.
These women don’t spare him a second glance as they walk the other way in their platform heels, pant legs billowing in the breeze. It’s late, too late for them to be out like this. There’s nothing around here until Broadway, just porno theaters and shops with bars on the windows.
Tony leans in, kisses him gently on the cheek. Runs his fingers around Steve’s neck, checks the collar.
The man hooks his fingertips in Steve’s waistband and yanks down.
He grabs Steve’s shield, stashes it back under his desk.
Steve would say.
“I don’t wanna hear about Tony,” Steve says, and he is so fucking transparent, he’s on the edge of tears, he’s furious and ashamed and heartbroken all at once and he wants to stop. “I don’t want to hear about how sorry he was, I don’t want any of it,” he says. “It’s not the same thing. Fucking fix me.”
“How much did Rhodey tell you before he took off,” Tony says. He tries to ease himself onto the closed toilet and Steve barely catches him before his legs give out. He is in
It won’t be like this in the morning, for either of them. It’s not going to be how it used to be.
sounds like a lie. None of it just happened, not for either of them. He doesn't know how to tell him about the dark and the blood and the drifting without harm. He hopes Steve understands. He blinks a slow blink, enjoys the dullness the sedatives impart.
Tony leans forward, kisses Steve, and Steve should have known that he was never going to get all of Tony, just pieces, just like it’s always been. Tony’s too big. Larger than life. Tony licks around Steve’s mouth like he’s going off to war and he intends to make an impression. It seems like it lasts forever. It’s almost enough.
He’s not sure what compels him to press the tiny recessed button on the side of the card, but he does it.
He stops at a bodega, grabs the Times and the WSJ and fancy coffee for Tony. He checks his watch – it’s only been an hour. Maybe breakfast. Tony needs to eat; he looks thin, whittled, wiry. He’s broken his nose again, it’s crooked. Steve hates it, he hates being the one to do damage control like this, hates seeing how bad Tony lets it get before he tries to patch himself together with duct tape.
“Are you sure,” Steve had said, and Tony had looked at him like he was begging for a reason not to go through with it, like he would follow Steve to the ends of the earth and beyond if Steve asked. Like he was begging Steve to tell him not to.
Oh, no.
“I love you,” Tony says, when he’s caught his breath.
“Coward,” Tony throws out.
- - -
“Don’t move, okay,” the voice says. “I’ll be right there.”
Maybe Tony's not participating intently enough. Maybe this is truly, all on him. Maybe he doesn't want it. Maybe he's lying.
It’s completely unnecessary, and it will make Tony’s day very, very, difficult, but he snaps a tiny silver padlock through the hardware. A whim. An indulgence. “There’s a key in your desk,” Steve informs him. He traces the line of Tony’s cock over all the layers with one finger, and then lets Tony acquaint himself with his new reality.
“You’re turning into your father,” Steve says, because he always comes back and Tony is losing his fucking mind. He covers his eyes and rocks himself back and forth on the tile in the foyer and thinks of the taste of whiskey.
Tony’s been on the phone with Ross for an hour. He paces. He twists his watch, he drags his feet. Occasionally he breaks his circuit to wander over to where Steve has been arranged so he can slip the pad of his thumb into Steve’s mouth.
“Can I get you off, at least,” Steve says, like it’s a transaction and they’re strangers.
Like he’ll be heartbroken if Steve says no.
“Get your shit together and get your ass on the deck,” she says.
“I hate seeing you like this,” he says.
“And you wielded the fucking Infinity Gauntlet,” Steve says. “I couldn’t have done that, Tony.”
The voice is bad. The voice makes Rebirth feel like a pleasant memory. He is acutely aware that someone is kneeling at his side and checking his pulse and all he can do is whimper and keen on the floor.
“This is not up to you,” Tony tells him.
He wants to say
, she tells them. She says words like
Tony slowly untangles himself, guides Steve’s body, props him up against the couch. The buzzing stops, and Tony’s fingers find the base of the plug and gently remove it from Steve’s body. He undoes Steve’s straps with clinical efficiency. He breathes evenly, not like he used to, not with the thing lodged in his chest. He runs his hands over Steve like he’s checking a piece of machinery. He must be pleased with what he finds; he doesn’t linger. He ducks into the bathroom and comes back with an armful of white steaming towels.
Hears running water.
Tony looks, for just a moment, like he might cry, and then it passes. He does that thing to his face, sublimates, compresses, compartmentalizes. Steve has always envied it. He's never mastered it like Tony has.
“You can’t play the system,” Steve tells him.
Tony looks down at him through half-lidded eyes, hungry and indifferent.
They exist like that in the vast steel emptiness of the compound, old lovers, old ghosts.
Hallucination dances across Tony’s mind, and Janet keeps talking. Thor laughs, and Thor’s deep booming voice puts fear in him, now, and Steve’s eyes are darting around like he’s terrified and he opens his mouth and Tony shouldn’t be able to hear him through the ice but Extremis picks his scream up because Tony is in hell and the decibel count goes up and up in the HUD –
“What’s the harm,” Tony is whispering, and his breath ghosts against Steve’s lips, and Steve is weak and heartsick and he leans into it.
to shrug. “Would you rather be dead,” he says. “Because that’s the other option, Steve–”
“I’ll take myself off the team,” Tony offers. “Those were extraordinary circumstances, but I was a liability, I’ll be the first to admit it–”
The pageantry of it, the wild thrill of it all, reminds him of one of Tony’s galas. After dinner, at that point in the night when the booze was flowing freely and the men would leave their jackets and the women would quietly slide their shoes under the table. This place is flashier than any of those places, this is lights and sweat and living and those places were gilt and repressed and judgment. This place is dark and wild and
Steve catches him sometimes, watches him looking down at his stomach cradling the thing in his hands. Watches him cry and rage and stare out the window like he’s evacuated temporarily.
“I told you he was schizo,” Shepherd is telling Laila.
Steve flickers back, perches in the seat next to Tony, leans in and brushes Tony’s hair behind his ear –
- - -
He doesn’t press it. No one uses these anymore, anyway. There’s no way Tony’s kept one, he's better than that. You don't carry around broken tech for nostalgia’s sake. These cards are relics. Fossils. If Tony had any sense he's already auctioned the rest of them off.
“Maybe,” Steve concedes softly.
The families of his employees glance at him, from time to time. He stands perfectly still, dips his helmeted head at the appropriate intervals.
“It’s ok,” he says, more for himself than for Tony. He looks at the wall behind the headboard. “Are you ok?”
and there’s no one to tell him no, he’s
Leonard reminds him of Steve, in a way – infuriatingly calm in the face of Tony’s chaos, brimming with quiet judgment. Rooted in firm moral ground. Tony’s never had that, not innately – he needs his anchors - work, alcohol, Steve.
“You know, this is
, and wouldn’t that be a scandal if anyone made him? He can see the Bugle headlines now – Nomad caught in perverted tryst with Maggia Ringleader. 15 dollars a person, a thousand people a night – it’s a wonder the IRS isn’t swarming the place. It’s the perfect front.
Steve punches the ground so hard he swears.
Steve panics briefly. He so rarely lets his guard down, he doesn’t
It’s not difficult to pretend to be somewhere else. He is blunted and dull. His mind is slow. Extremis feels like a half-remembered dream. He is still dangerous, they tell him. He will always be dangerous. He is given pills and he no longer asks what they are. He has stopped measuring the passage of time. Sometimes they give him shots and he loses days.
Tony wants to hurt him. Wants to lash at him for all the things he’s not allowed to say in words anymore. He knows Steve wouldn’t object, but that’s not his mission tonight. The object is tenderness and he’s been failing since they started. Deception precludes tenderness. If he were better to both of them, he’d lie properly. He’d disentangle Steve and bring them both up on the bed and caress the broad planes of Steve’s body and he would lie as a normal person does:
“Yeah,” Tony says, “you didn’t.”
He is puttering when he hears something from the bathroom. He pulls Jocasta out and grabs his shield from where it sits by the door. “Tony,” he says, stalking down the hallway.
“You’re going to make it take," he says.
“You know, I might believe you if you pretended to give a damn about me lately,” Tony says.
“I don’t think you know anything about me,” Steve says, and Tony feels like he’s failed in every conceivable way. “I think you had
“Because he’s Tony,” Steve says, stepping up, drawing himself up to every one of his six-foot-two inches. “He’s all I’ve ever had since I woke up in this fucking nightmare of a world. And I will burn it all down to save him.”
His suits are already hanging on him, and he locks the Extremis armor in a case and hands it to Maria and casts his eyes away and climbs into a car that someone has called for him and goes back to his tomb. He is painfully aware of the way the thing glints when he steps, the way it is fully visible as his pant leg rides up.
It’s not a good day. He’s agitated. He’s holding himself like he used to do when he still had the reactor and he was stiff, like he wanted to be punching his issues out but breathing was the most he could hope to settle for. He moves out of Steve’s periphery, but Steve hears him settle by the window. The plug Steve’s almost forgotten about buzzes to life. On, off, on. Tony is playing with him. He cycles through the settings, Steve squirms and flushes and flexes his thighs to get anything he can out of it.
Tony twists back in forth in front of the mirror, assessing. He presses the jock up to himself, traces the line of it where it would cut over his glutes. It’s very clearly a piece meant to contain, even though it’s made of the softest leather and overlaid with a heavy dark blue Chantilly lace.
Knot me or get out of me, Tony rasps.
Steve has no idea who Bowie is, and two can play – he’s already been ogled and he’d like to just get through the goddamn door and see what all the fuss is about, so he puts on his best Captain America smile. “That’s cute,” Steve bluffs. “You really don’t know who I am, son?”
, as Steve climbed into bed beside him.
Tony touches the side of his head. Steve, he says. Tony slaps him on the temple. Steve, he says again.
You're still in pain, Steve says quietly, as he pulls out and replaces himself with a plug. Aren't you.
“No,” Tony tells him, covering himself with the sheet, rolling over to turn his back to Steve. “It’s not important.”
Enough, Steve says, and pushes her away.
Tony rolls to face him. They’re nose to nose; they’re close enough to breathe each other’s air.
You’d do the same for me, he’d told the Invaders. No one should die alone.
Bruce has left instructions. It's hard to get ahold of experts at a time like this, with the world in crisis, but Steve gets someone on the phone, leaves periodically to shout without disturbing Tony.
Tony gasps a little and Steve feels drunk with the power. He did that. Emboldened, he smoothes his hand down Tony’s chest, and Tony lays back, watches him with wariness and hunger, both. He runs his fingers over Tony’s balls and realizes he’s holding his breath. The shape of Tony mesmerizes him; he would do this forever if Tony would let him.
“I don’t think you get to ask me that,” Tony tells him. “Thanks for keeping in touch.”
He holds Steve, cradles the back of his neck when he could be holding the lead – he wants this to be personal, wants it to sting. Tony moans, tips his head forward, drips sweat into Steve’s hair. He drags his cock out of Steve’s throat and snaps back in, murmurs incomprehensible things while Steve’s vision fills up with static. Steve can’t grab him, can’t push back, he’s bound and stiff and open, he’s here until Tony wants to be done with him.
and trustworthy and noble and it's why there's a hole in his episodic memory.
They break apart, panting, and Steve only manages a broken “
The air is starting to clear and Tony’s vision is going dim. The angry red sky peeks through a plume of smoke. The incursion has to be coming any minute.
Fabrication is slow in analog: he has to drag cables across the floor and rewires some of the lines because almost everything is off for the renovations. He has to pour the metal himself, has to crank a generator to life with his own two hands. He crushes his hand in a vise and dials 911 manually and lies on the floor curled up in pain and grunts into the mouthpiece.
I can't fucking believe you, Tony says, and Steve's eyes well over with furious, naked tears.
Still so terrible about lying to himself.
“That’s not was I was going to say, I was going to say
Tony has lost his scars. He’s perfect. He should have electrical burns, at least; Steve has peeled him out of the suit often enough to know that the housing sits close to his chest, that there is bare metal near his major blood vessels where syringes inject him with drugs that can keep him standing. Steve knows just how well Tony’s suit conducts electricity. There’s not even a mark from any of his surgeries.
Steve kisses him full on the mouth and Tony moans into his mouth, bereft, betrayed. Steve enjoys it. He enjoys making Tony speechless. It’s a rare joy.
He comes.
Steve pulls out, and it is agony. He slaps the side of Tony's neck and Tony seizes around him.
Steve slips back into the shadows like a wraith. He’ll follow, for now. His costume is dark enough, his shield is gone. There’s nothing to attract the light. He can clock them from the rooftops, make sure they get where they’re going safely. They drift down 8th and their perfume follows them in a cloud, spicy and floral, like the stuff Tony used to wear. They clutch at each other’s arms and laugh. Steve thinks about standing at the gates to the mansion, arm-in-arm. Assemble.
He bends low. He presses his mouth to the stem of Steve’s cock, licks until all that come from their first round starts to smear on his tongue. He resents this man, this man who doesn’t know what he doesn’t know. He is in love with this man and this man will always be mateless and this will always be uneven and slanted and Tony smiles so Steve knows this is his pleasure and not some middling torment for the both of them.
The Commander is in Liberia with his SHIELD team waiting for extraction when his sat phone turns itself on and rings.
, I’d have to hide your body or everyone would know about you, everyone would know about us–”
He can see Steve again.
Tony’s tears are intolerable enough.
You are fucking unbelievable, Nat says.
Whispers, “You’re close, aren’t you,” into Steve’s ear, and
His palm is still hot and they aren't dead yet and he wonders how many times they're going to do this, how much would he rather die than be honest, why is he
It’s exactly the right thing to say to push every one of Steve’s buttons at once, and Steve despises him for it.
she’s saying, and armed SHIELD agents descend like they were waiting in the wings. Like everyone knew this was going to happen all along.
Steve licks at him like if he tries hard enough, he can singlehandedly coax Tony into wetness. He bites at the insides of Tony's thighs. He buries his face in Tony and Tony buries his face in the shitty hospital bedding he bought a lifetime ago and wills himself to open, to bloom again, to self-repair. If he were wearing the nanotech he knows it would erupt on his chest.
In Steve’s fantasy, Steve is god and he doesn’t squander his power. He lets himself lapse for one brief moment, and for once, it’s not for anything earth-shattering, not for the greater good. For once he is allowed to be ordinary and selfish. In his fantasy, Steve closes his hand around the Time Gem and he goes back, beyond their failures and betrayals and petty quarrels. He never travels to the future because Tony never violates him. Tony never violates him because there are no incursions. There are no incursions because there are no Avengers. There are no Avengers because Tony died in Afghanistan and Namor never stumbled upon Steve in the ice and so there can be no love and no pain and no heartbreak.
Steve flickers.
“It just buys me time,” Tony says, for the thousandth time. They’ve talked it to death, and the conversation always ends the same way, because Tony’s fire is slowly burning out. It’s too easy to capitulate.
He has finally stopped trying to see the future. He asks Steve what to do. He says that he wants to do better. They are gentle with each other. Tony’s armor is just armor. Steve’s anger never makes it to lethal; it evaporates. They stop raking their nails over each other's weak spots and they spare each other. Something of their love survives.
“Why don’t you take that off,” Tony whispers back, and he tugs at the guy’s mask. He tries an arm around his waist, firm, solid, hot. Tony is hard and it’s obvious. He thinks he’d be more of a gentleman about it under normal circumstances, but in this place, it’s like a handshake.
Steve's trust rankles him. Why don't you tell me no, he thinks, and he imagines this night ending with a crop, a switch, something, in his hand, and Steve - Steve, strung out and bleeding and wanting more than he should trust Tony to give, the lax shape of his plush mouth -
He must be new. Tony is fucking charmed.
Tony's hand goes to his chest, but the nanotech is gone. He slapped it into Steve's hand. He let it go.
Steve doesn’t have the heart to tell him he doesn’t have a clue what drowning feels like.
. I'll fuck you like this every day, Tony, I'll knot you until you understand. Losing you, he says, and he pulls at Tony's length, losing you is unacceptable to me.
“It’s not because of this,” he insists. He signs the legal documents that transfer most of his shares in the remaining conglomerate to Pepper. He keeps what Howard left him last year.
“Oh my god,” Steve declares between gasps of air. He grips himself like it’s his only line to sanity.
He reaches for the gold before he remembers he’s been decommissioned. There’s no armor, there’s no Extremis, there’s no comm in his ear for Steve to tell him what to do.
The guy leans over him, dips his head to lay his lips on Tony’s neck.
He takes it upon himself to double his dose of Seroquel.
some wretched part of him answers.
“I could make you something ergonomic,” Tony says quietly. “You don’t need to use the store-bought shit–”
He thinks he doesn’t want to give Tony the opportunity.
Steve shouts when he comes. He’s getting it on the rug, he knows, and Tony slides an arm around his waist and holds him through it, holds them chest to chest. Steve bites him; immediately regrets it, Tony hates marks. It ends after what feels like an eternity, and it’s just the wail of the recycled air filtering through the compound, the silence stretched between the two of them, Steve wilting in Tony’s lap, both of them stuck together with evidence to prove it: they just can’t get away from each other.
“I’m not asking you to like it,” Tony says icily, “People don’t like what they don’t understand–”
He doesn't voice his discomfort. Steve had him do miserable, halting laps earlier - with a plug, no less - dragging his IV tower along, Steve's big hand splayed across the small of his back, trying not to touch as if he hasn't funneled quarts of his own fluids into Tony's body. Now he is swollen and sore where Steve pushes into him every hour and a half, bruised around his glands, his nipples raw under his grey hospital gown.
“I must be having a senior moment, because it sure as shit feels like yesterday to me,” Steve says.
Steve smells like body odor and hasn’t shaved in two days and goes into the hallway to listen to some asshole doctor tell him that Tony needs a new heart and there’s a goddamn waiting list. Survival rate, she says. No alcohol. She says other words, exertion and stress and The Best Care.
Tony pulls at the strap, and Steve’s vision goes white.
This office is where Tony entertains his peers: wealthy investors, journalists that want to interview him about his humanitarian work. Lobbyists. Members of Congress who would like to see Steve extradited and hung for treason.
“Give me your hand,” Steve shouts over the roaring air.
“Aren’t you gonna say it back,” Tony says.
No, he’s here for restitution.
“The armor did this to you,” he says.
“You need to go to the hospital, Tony–”
Steve thinks he should be able to bypass Tony’s locks one by one, that by virtue of being Steve, one day the cage to Tony’s heart will just swing open all on its own.
Tony realizes what he maybe should have realized before the Accords. That Steve has been in the midst of his own collapse.
Tony sucks in a shuddering breath.
and Steve sucks at his neck, he should know not to do that and he does it anyway, he does what he wants and Tony is wetter than he has ever been in his life
One of their Avengers cards beeps.
“You get what I give you, Steve,” Tony tells him, and Tony’s balls slap against Steve’s throat.
“No,” he says, and Steve must be dripping on Tony’s foot. “I don’t think so.” He’s not pulling all the way out anymore, just slides out long enough to tickle Steve’s gag reflex then pushes back down. He stays there for seconds and Steve’s ability to care slides further and further out of his reach.
Steve takes the path through the park. His feet pound the pavement. He pushes himself, wants to feel air burning his lungs, wants to ache. Wants, with every cell in his body to turn around and go back to Tony’s apartment and wake him up and kiss him until he can’t breathe.
“You did me this morning,” Tony reminds him.
Steve must wait too long to answer, because Tony draws in a shuddering breath and buries his face in his hands. “Rumiko came to my house and told me she loved me,” Tony says, like he’s forcing the words out. “And the armor was right there and I just stood there like a coward and I didn’t say anything–”
. He tells Steve he was wrong. He says:
Tony starts to cry, but he clutches at Steve’s arm, presses his body back into Steve’s. Please be here when I wake up, he says and Steve murmurs against his neck and pitches his voice into something warm and soothing and whispers
Steve sighs, and does the only thing he knows how to do. Tony’s willing and somnolent, his mouth open and plush and made for Steve’s.
“No,” Tony says absently, turns his head away. His breath hitches.
, and there’s a bulge in his pants that says maybe he’s not as pure as Tony thought. Something about that puts him out of Tony’s league, and the anxiety flutters back up.
Steve shakes his head. "Later, maybe. I can wait another day." He tries on a smile.
Steve nudges his cock out of the way, presses his mouth to Tony’s balls, sucks one of them into his mouth. Tony’s breath hitches. He passes a hand through Steve’s hair.
Tony’s eyes glimmer. “I anticipate your needs,” he says. "I anticipated you might need to be reminded of the situation between us." He tangles his fingers in Steve’s pubes, traces the base of his very-hard cock with deft fingers, fondles him. Takes some of his own wetness and brings it to his mouth, rubs it on his lips. Lets Steve suck it off his fingers.
He takes his cards out. Shuffles them, drops a few. His hands are shaking. Everyone he lets in does this. At this point he wouldn’t be surprised if Whitney herself strolled in. He imagines what Carol is going to say. There’s no way they’re going to skate around his alcoholism, now, if Rhodey were here and not fucking
It’s too intimate for what they are. Insomnia and helplessness erode those little boundaries, but Tony just sits there and rubs at his temples and doesn’t pull his hand away. “I don’t know what to say to you,” he says, small and defeated.
Tony mouths at Steve's big index finger out of pity, familiarity. Fever-borne fatigue. Preservation. He brings Steve's hand to his mouth, slips his tongue out when he remembers. Tries to remember what this should feel like. Tries to savor the taste of it. Tries to convince himself he wants it. He wants to crawl in the direction of life.
Tony walks through the portal and across the bridge and through the dark that goes up and up and up. It’s what he imagines the galaxy feels like.
“I’m also wondering if it's just some body you're after,” Tony says, quieter. “Or if you’re just lonely and I’m just here.”
Steve puts his hands everywhere, gentle until he forgets to be gentle. He folds Tony like a pretzel like he does when he's in rut. He hikes Tony's gown up, pulls his ankles apart, dives in like Tony's body still belongs to him.
Steve rolls on top of him, without warning, too abruptly to be tender. He traces his hand up Tony's neck. Tony flinches away when he grazes his gland area, the tenderness is unbearable - but Steve grabs his chin, tilts his head back. Presses his fingers around Tony's throat. Pushes.
The Alphas. His dead kids.
Like clockwork.
Janet says: it’s really him.
Open your mouth, Steve tells him.
“I’m not,” he says. “I mean it, Tony, that’s good, you should –”
“No you don’t,” Steve says.
Tony twines his fingers with Steve’s and slides onto the barstool.
"I think you ruined something," Steve tells him. "And I think your ego hates things that aren't in your power to fix."
Steve flexes his shoulders and expects to feel the leather splitting like it’s cotton.
“You’re welcome,” Steve tells him.
“Then we can work something out,” Tony says, and he slips back into that awful voice that’s for strangers and not for Steve. “I’ll blow you again,” he offers. “You can fuck me if you want, for real, I can fuck you, just, please don’t–”
“Steve,” Tony pants, “Steve, Steve,
"Take the gloves off," Steve is saying, "oh, just,
, Steve–”
“Rub yourself off on my leg, Steve,” Tony says.
It’s not a disguise, not really. It’s just an extension of himself. It’s what he tells himself in the dark. It’s how he’s able to face his day. Whatever works, he tells himself. He has removed himself from field duty. He continues to patch the holes in his code. He has tricked his body into thinking sleep is optional – eliminated the biological imperative, left the potential for masochism wide open and available.
Jesus, he thinks. The man with the goatee grabs his shoulder and leans into his bicep and Steve thinks he’d like to deck this guy. “Don’t be an idiot, gorgeous,” he says, and gestures at the open door. “No one says no to getting into 54. You could be Captain America with those pecs,” he says.
“No,” Tony had said after what felt like an eternity of waiting, and that was that.
The novelty of it should be welcome after so long feeling so little.
He is perfect and useless and whole. He touches his throat, looking for bruises, but there’s only sweat in the hollow of his throat and his racing pulse.
What happened for you to do that, he presses. He is terrified by the one-dimensionality of speech. Steve could lie to him. Steve could say anything.
He hears the door shut, hears Tony’s softer, tentative footsteps.
Tony’s heartbeat is fast, faster than it should be for a guy his age, even after a round like that.
“Ok,” Steve says, and lowers Tony gently to the floor. “I’m sorry.” He touches Tony’s face, so gentle, shaking as his fingertips ghost over where they put a hole in his cheekbone.
The silence is damning.
Steve doesn’t sleep. He doesn’t know if he’ll ever get to have this again. It feels like goodbye, which is ridiculous. The sun will rise again, tomorrow. They’ll be on the same team. This Extremis thing, it’s just another thing. Even if this raw thing between them doesn’t survive, their friendship always has.

“You remind me of someone,” Steve chokes out.
Tony was the worst, if he’s honest. Some part of him, the scared little boy part, wanted to hear a story from the mouth of Cap himself.
, he thinks, and then the thought is gone and a wave of senseless grief washes over him.
, all you had to do was talk to me, you can’t fucking undo this –”
“How far do you want to take this,” Tony asks, his voice carefully measured.
This is all they get.
Something about that is intoxicating. Steve has fallen all the way from revered to less than nothing. All it took was one omission.
Steve reaches around under his body, fumbles for Tony's swollen, flaccid cock.
Tony’s eyes are glistening. There’s a red streak where he’s wiped at his nose, a tear track that shines in the lamplight. His shirt is open, his breath clouds in the air.
"It will be slower, this time,” Strange says, finally. “It won't be instantaneous; it could take hours for everything to go. Steve, do you fully understand what you’re asking me to do?”
Tony makes a soft sound of assent, suckles slowly at Steve’s thumb, unhurried, gentle.
“Do you think you could want me,” Steve says.
Tony has positioned him, kneeling, on the rug with his knees and ankles spread wide, his hands caught at the small of his back. Tony’s added a wide leather collar today, hooked his head back with a lead that connects to the spreader bar keeping his ankles apart. It is his least favorite configuration to date. He can’t pull his head forward, can’t close his legs. He is open and sore and may as well be carved out of stone for all the attention Tony has given him.
Pepper frowns at them from the couch. Steve winks at her, kisses the corner of Tony’s mouth.
He reminds himself: he wanted it this way. Anonymity. Wanted people to stop looking at the flag, at the legend. Wanted people to see him.
He plants his legs as wide as they’ll go, and starts to rock.
“No,” Tony says, and tucks the buckle back into its place. “But I do enjoy it when you beg.”
Maybe it will be better to live like this, until. Until Steve can find a way to fix it. In carefully-fabricated bliss. Cohabitate, CEO Tony Stark and Commander Stark in the same space, ignoring the same holes as they gape wider and wider.
Arguing with Jocasta is possibly worse than arguing with Tony.
He blinks and blinks and Jen is fully turned towards him, now, and he feels like his throat is closing up and there are cameras on him. He can’t do this here, but it’s like his whole body is seizing up, he reaches for the armor on instinct and finds
Steve nods, silently, and Tony feels the dripping again.
Yeah, Steve says, after what seems like an eternity, raw and wanting and lost.
It did sound patronizing.
The music is picking up now. Frantic strings. The throng of people pulses around them like a beating heart. The two of them are standing still while couples writhe and fuck and groan all around them. Tony gets a better glimpse of his quarry as the lights strobe over them and he could look at this man’s body for days. He feels his heart fluttering again, feels himself getting hard. Already wants another bump, another few, another drink, but it’s too soon. He’s thankful for the beat of the music, the lighting that disguises how fucking tweaked he is. He wonders about this man. Too wholesome for this crowd, maybe. Not dirty enough.
Tony’s palm starts to heat.
Tony lets him do it – fatigue, or weariness has overtaken him for now. He’s never worn it well. “Let go of me,” he says quietly. He doesn’t pull away. It’s halfhearted at best.
Steve strokes down his thighs as if he is a skittish mare, over the place on the back of his neck that makes his body crumple without his consent.
Tony hates that he can know that. That he is so open to Steve and Steve is so shut to him.
His guards take him deep into the bowels of the facility – they lead him past what used to be the edge of the facility and Tony feels insignificant and useless. They have redesigned expressly for him, they have made him an unsolvable maze. They pass a generator, maybe, what looks like another cellblock. He’s led down a dark hallway that feels like a canyon. They make him climb into a platform elevator and the dark presses down on them.
Tony rolls over and looks at the wall. “Don’t look at me like that,” he tells Steve’s ghost. “Don’t do that.”
“Whatever keeps you warm,” Tony says, his voice quiet and seething. “I guess that’s me, tonight.”
Tony's gonna be dead soon, she hisses.
Tony takes Steve’s minor, invisible meltdown in stride. “Two, actually,” he says, like a heart attack is a minor inconvenience and not a major medical event, like he’s resigned himself to it. “Also Rumiko is never talking to me again, but I guess I deserved that, for this, for us,” he says, waving his hand between them. “My armor honest to god came to life and turned on me,” and his voice is flat, “and it assimilated the sum of my human experience and came out possessive and homicidal, so I’m feeling pretty shitty about that.”
Steve is nowhere, and Tony looks at his ankle and reaches for Extremis and feels a terrible empty maelstrom where nonstop data was before and imagines the taste of liquor.
Solid, real. Warm. Sticky with blood.
Tony’s eyes widen, a little. “Are you asking me how I could save your life? Because if it’s you or me it’s not really a question–”
He hears the horse-clomp of their shoes and he moves forward, just inside, so they don’t run him over, and together they float toward the audible throng inside, the sea of people and the smell of sex and sweat and alcohol.
“Hi,” he says, Queens through and through. He takes his time, lets his eyes rove, up, down, just below the belt. “I like your outfit,” the man says, and leans closer. “We could go upstairs,” he says, low in his throat.
Steve’s hand is trembling as he rests it on Tony’s cheek. A simple, forbidden thing.
“What do you think I’m trying to do,” Tony says, because he’s cruel, or dense, or tired. Maybe he really believes, in his heart of hearts, that it’s going to be okay.
His mouth doesn’t form up right, so someone else ends up blowing them out for him. It’s the small woman who always brings him pretty things – a sweater, soft socks, once – Jane? Is her name Jane? She’s wearing a yellow dress.
I'm asking you to stop, Tony says. You said you would stop, Steve, do you remember that? He brings his hands up to Steve's shining, stubbly face. One of his hands still has the cannula taped to it. It's possible he can negotiate, it's possible Steve isn't in too deep yet.
“I could blow you instead.”
“Why do we need this,” Tony says now, as he looks at the specs. “It’s in the Everglades, I hate Florida.”
“I’m sorry,” he says, because the list is long. Abandonment, failure, heartlessness. He doesn’t know which one he’s apologizing for just now.
“What do you want with me, Steve,” Tony presses. “You don’t have one night stands.” Steve wishes Tony would have always been this open and unfiltered and hates himself for it: it’s the coke, it’s the alcohol. Tony’s loose-lipped and rough and he swallows and his Adam’s apple bobs –
Steve is in him, he realizes, Steve has been in him for a while, is driving their bodies together with desperate compulsion. Tony's body is such confounding knot of pain that he can barely separate one sensation from the next. He runs through variant after variant of protest. If you loved me you wouldn't. I won't forgive you. You won't forgive you.
“Do you think you can break this thing off my ankle,” Tony says. “I’d love some armor right about now.”
Nothing happens, and Tony chuckles, low in his ear.
“I think it’s not about trust,” he says, and he levers himself up, as lithe as he knows how to be, gives himself over to movement and distraction and pushes the feeling in his throat down, down, down.
“You’re an animal,” Tony tells him, and bodily removes his booted feet.
. He turns it over. He thinks about an eternity of drugs and restraints and Steve’s eternal vengeance. An eternity of people looking at him with impersonal disgust and the pity of bystanders.
It’s not Steve’s kind of place.
He is content to exist in this narrow absence of feeling. It’s not so bad.
and he is blind from tears and all he wants is to not be alone, all he wants is three words he’s never going to get –
Tony wakes up in the dark.
Tony kisses the nape of his neck, puts the remote for the vibrator in Steve’s hand, edges Steve’s thumb onto the button. He won’t turn it off, they both know it. Tony puts one broad hand on Steve’s hip and Steve is dimly aware that he’s been thrusting at nothing; he feels sweat running down his back. The plug is too much and not enough, overwhelming sensation, barely enough volume to make him feel like he’s being manipulated for someone else’s leisure.
Is this how Tony used to feel before he was reborn in that jungle?
“You saved the world,” Steve reminds him, and Tony bites at his lip and shoves the crystal right off the coffee table and onto the floor.
before Tony throws himself into his task and Steve’s cock is out and then buried safely in Tony’s mouth. Steve threads his hands through Tony’s hair - he likes it this length, it’s almost as long as it used to be before Tony woke up in that hospital room with his memory gone and his head shaved to his scalp - and then Tony is pushing his knees apart and Steve is bucking up into his mouth because Tony is doing a sinful suction thing with his mouth.
Steve gets rid of the nurses for the rest of the day.
and failing yet again.
“No,” Tony says flatly. Tony’s not paying attention or maybe he doesn’t care, because he didn’t clench when Steve pulled out and there’s come all over the couch and he’s just laying there looking catatonic, indolent and half-hard and apathetic about the entire situation.
“What if it’s important,” Steve murmurs, but he’s pulling Tony’s ankles over his shoulders, he’s losing himself already and he doesn’t want to be Captain America right now.
“What happened,” he asks her. Extremis is giving him garbage – four minutes of nothing when he should have been delivering Steve’s eulogy.
You can try, Tony concedes.
Tony should tell him: I am a mistake.
Steve closes his eyes. Of all possible outcomes, this is his luck. He laughs, because it’s not funny, none of it is funny.
“You do,” Steve croaks.
Tony blinks. “That’s me,” he says.
- - -
They leave him with two guards at every entrance and a mandatory daily check-in and he lifts his foot for them to check that the anklet is still working and nods in all the right places and agrees to meet with Leonard three times a week instead of two.
“How long have you been there,” Tony says.
“Yes,” Steve whispers, his cheeks heating in shame.
Steve harbors expectations of easiness. As if the wound will heal if he can only hold it closed long enough. As if reconciliation is certain to follow.
Tony stiffens and sucks in a breath and taps his fork against his plate. “She is smarter than me,” he says. “I don’t – she’s a scientist. She. It’s new,” he says finally, like it absolves him somehow.
Tony’s snuffling stills. “Do you actually mean that,” he says, low and sharp, “or are you just telling me what I want to hear again?”
Tony shivers, his eyes barely open, lets Steve hoist his ass up a little, sprawls out against the pillows with his mouth the color of sin in the light filtering in from the late afternoon sun. He palms himself, unhurried, and it’s been so long since they’ve gotten more than a few stolen moments of this, since they’ve been on these terms – shaky as they are – since they’ve smiled at each other instead of sniping, they’re
Okay, Steve says. His voice ruptures. So it -
,” Steve snipes.
They hadn’t spoken for days, not since the diner. Before that it was weeks, and Steve knocked out one of his teeth. Before that, they shared a bed and whispered kind things to each other in the dark and knew that wherever they were going, they were going there together.
Steve is nowhere close to sleep when his neighbors come up the fire escape at around one. Their feet fall heavy on the wrought iron and they’re drunk enough that Steve can smell it underneath the smoke from the cigarette they’re sharing. He rolls over in bed, watches their dark silhouettes through his billowing, moonlit sheers.
He knows better than to ask if Tony is getting anything out of this, because depending on the day Tony will turn ice cold or burn twice as hot, because Tony is already using one hand to pull himself out of his pants and the moan he lets out when he finally gets the zipper down makes it abundantly clear that he’s hard as nails already.
and Steve was dead.
Suck, Steve tells him.
“Let’s not pretend you aren’t getting the short end of the stick being with me, Steve,” Tony says. He puts his face back into that wretched mirthless smile.
Tony sees him, through the glass - both of his hands over his face, his forehead pressed against the wall, defeat in every line of his body.
Tony takes off the helmet and lets Leonard look at him, watches his face contort briefly into shock, and there is hot vindication in Tony. Let him see the circles under his eyes; let someone see him, let him have a reprieve from facelessness and heartlessness for even a moment. Let someone see how he is bearing his pain, alone.
“Wait,” Steve hears from behind him, Tony’s voice raspy and strained.
“I’m going to come,” Tony says. “Fuck, Steve,
He is alone.
Steve’s mouth opens and closes.
with Tony going on missions with five fingers of scotch in him and Tony sitting at the breakfast table pouring rum into his coffee and not caring that Steve noticed.
- - -
“Do you still want to wear it?”
Usually the nurses do this. It doesn’t feel like a violation anymore. He’s becoming used to the idea that he was born without a shell. His soft useless flesh is his entire world, now. He knows Steve would do this every day if Tony could ask him to.
Steve can’t bear to wipe his mouth, so he just drags himself up the bed, lies beside Tony.
Steve has a fantasy.
“You won’t,” Tony says, “feel,” and guides Steve’s hand with his own. To Steve’s utter shock, the blunt tip of Steve’s thumb slides right into Tony’s body, and there’s something warm and slick and it’s
situation.” She draws the words out, crowds him, sets Tony’s heart racing again. “But you need to fucking check yourself,” she tells him. “You need to pull it the fuck together.”
“Come on, Steve,” Tony cautions, “Be here, or don’t show up.”
He kisses Steve’s neck, rubs himself along Steve’s ass. “Tell me, or I’ll drop you in the jet just like this and all your friends will get to see what a fucking whore you are,” he breathes.
. The violence, maybe: of being alone, of being impaled, of being
It’s time for his line. This is his favorite part – it’s like all the adrenaline rushes out of him at once, and he is left with Steve, and Steve is sorry and for one moment, Tony is vindicated.
, he says, even though all he has left of Captain America these days is a bitter shell that Tony has somehow managed to crawl inside and warm. You’re right.
There's no Friday, Steve says. I took her away. You're not getting better because you don't trust me, he hisses.
It’s Tony’s leg.
“I can’t feel anything,” Tony says, and he can’t keep his hands away, now. He’s softening and the silicone follows his form. He picks up his own cock and drops it, fondles himself, runs his thumb over the pinhole at the tip. “What is this? I should be – very aroused, because this is – a revelation, but it’s like.” He bites his bottom lip. He presses his mouth into a line. He swallows, hard.
Howard tells him hope is easier to come by in this day and age. Sky’s the limit.
“Your nose is bleeding,” Steve says, finally, and Tony’s hand comes up quick as lightning to fix it.
You're so fucking selfish, Tony tells him.
The technician tells him they don’t know why it’s happening, and Tony finds he doesn’t really care. Another mystery, another obstacle to closure he already fears will never find him. It’s fine; he nods in the appropriate places. They think he’s grieving. They think he is heartless. They think this is another chore for him.
He doesn’t pull much of his weight in therapy sessions, now, lets the techs dip his hands in wax and curl and uncurl his hands and move his bare legs in the pool in the privacy of their vast, empty home. When it was still early, when they still wondered about the outcome, he was encouraged.
, he’d said.
Like Steve is the only thing in the world worth living for.
” he says, and waves the stack of letters. “You’ve been lying to me for a
Steve rips the letters in half and throws the scraps at Tony’s feet.
Two days later, he wanders down to his workshop. He looks at his old armors. They look like relics after the weightlessness, the rush of Extremis.
“Oh,” Tony says. There is something heartbreaking in his speechlessness. Tony’s always had his tongue about him. He nods to himself. He sniffs. He’s high.
That brings the ache back. What Steve would say about this place. What Steve would say about him.
He’s savaging this man’s throat and he doesn’t care. What would Tony think of him, what would he say? The man grunts and Steve winds his fingers tighter in his dark hair and he’s so close, he’s so close, he’s being too rough but he doesn’t want to pull away, he won’t. He thrusts, once, twice, more, and lets himself slide all the way down this stranger’s throat.
“Don’t waste any,” Tony says, and then he’s sliding out of Steve’s mouth and Steve wants to gasp and cry but he has to keep his mouth shut.
They’re swarming the way crowds do when someone is lying on the ground having a heart attack. Tony used to say that everyone loves a spectacle. Steve doesn’t carry the kind of authority he used to; once, people would spring apart for him like he was Moses himself, but instinct sets his feet moving and he’s elbowing his way through before he can think better of it. His face is covered, he reminds himself. Don’t sweat it. People will stare, it’s fine. The crowd seems to go on forever. People are yelling. He has to get to whoever is injured, he has to –
Steve can't focus his eyes. His gaze bounces around and it finally settles, it's on Tony's mouth.
“Tony,” he says, like he’s trying it out for the very first time. “That’s your name,” he says.
I don't hold anything, Steve tells her. You know that.
Her name is Carol and she tells him stories about faraway places with faraway names. His mind can't catch on much of it.
Tony has heard that language before. In the bill for Project Wideawake. They want to test him. They want to do experiments on him. They want to know what he can do.
, he doesn’t say.
Steve looks upset. Like Tony should have let the thing eat his hand. Like he wasn’t properly maimed. He sits crowded into one corner of the helicopter and drifts alongside Tony’s gurney and looks at the morphine drip as if Tony’s forgotten he’s an alcoholic.
Tony is called down to the morgue.
This dream isn’t new. Sometimes the color of the sky shifts from the red-grey of particulate and smog to a bright bright blue. Right now it’s the golden hour of dawn, and the wings on Steve’s cowl are backlit by a halo of fledgling sunlight.
Steve, inscrutable – his arms crossed, that infuriating cold impartiality written into the lines on his face – is the last thing Tony sees before one of them steps on his wrist and he’s out.
- - -
Tony had plans for this. Angry speeches. Contrition. Non-engagement. Murder. Begging. Lies and fucking and destructive honesty and all of it to compensate for the fact that Tony is weak and Tony was always going to beg to keep the bond.
Steve’s good as his word. He undoes his tie while Tony watches, pulls it out, frees the first few buttons on his shirt. He slips down to his knees on the floor, bends to press an open-mouthed kiss to Tony’s neck, feels the flutter of his pulse under his tongue. Slides his broad hands down Tony’s sides – never his front, never his wretched chest or his stomach where the line emerges like some alien thing. He lets himself run his fingers through the wiry curls at the base of Tony’s cock, well shy of the wire where it dips down almost to his groin and curves up again.
“Am I your first,” Tony says, and his venom is gone away and he is so timid that Steve wishes they were inside so they could scream at each other properly.
“Oh, god,” Steve chokes.
“Doesn’t feel great, does it,” Steve says, perched on the other end of the couch with his wounds staining the upholstery and his mouth full of blood. “Remember when you took my shield away and wiped my memory?”
So you cheated on me, Tony says. A provocation; they both know it.
Steve, he says weakly.
Tony tastes like cardamom and, faintly, curry. He kisses back, clumsy and slow and soft. There’s no room for fervor in their sex anymore. Tony would probably still call it lovemaking. No more Tony with his filthy mouth jumping Steve in the elevator. He’s mostly still, mostly quiet. His mouth is dry from the meds he’s on. He tries to catch his breath between Steve’s tongue nudging at his bottom lip and Steve’s rough hands stroking down Tony’s neck. Feels like claustrophobia, Tony had told him, once. Like he’s always drowning and there’s a 50-pound weight resting on his chest.
The difference between them, Tony thinks, is that Steve made plans. Tony had contingencies.
Steve throws his bundle of linens on the floor.
He hears himself screaming again, as if from the end of a tunnel. His body is being moved. Someone is gathering them into his lap. Running their fingers through his hair. Dripping on him.
You're bondsick, Tony, Steve reminds him, and it is the most condescending thing Tony can fucking imagine.
, Tony tells him weakly, and Steve smells like clay, and a little like tobacco - maybe, not quite, something herby - and Tony wants to stick his fucking face in his armpit, he wants to lick every drop of sweat from Steve's body, Steve has his hand clamped over Tony's mouth and Tony doesn't even care. It's an alchemy he's never dreamed he would experience. He would walk back into that cave on his own feet if it meant he could have this forever.
Tony’s hearing is in two days.
Steve’s hand worms its way into Tony’s. Their rings click together.
“Is Sharon here,” Tony says in the monotone he usually gets when he’s been up for days. Steve resents that, too. He hates that he cares. He doesn’t have any pity after that bullshit Tony pulled on him. He doesn’t want to make nice right now. Doesn’t want to give an inch.
He does paperwork. He ignores the Gadget situation, ignores Sal's death, ignores his most pressing failures, shunts them aside for another day. He signs his name over and over and –
He is a good enough liar that he has convinced Leonard that he wants to get better. He has agreed to everything, the administrative leave, the meds, the twice-a-week therapy, the grief counseling, the downtime.
Tony’s face is wet. He presses his lips together and doesn’t quite make it to a smile. “Thanks, Cap,” he says.
His psychiatrist has four guards, today. They fan out behind her as she brings the barrier all the way down. They point rifles at his body. They wear armor.
Donna Summer sings, and Steve couldn’t find stillness in him if he tried. The man tilts his head, considering, gently, gently slides his hand around to run the tips of his fingers through the hair on Steve’s chest. He fingers the hem of Steve’s suit, lets his fingertips trail just under the hem, over his abs, down to his navel. Steve thinks he does an admirable job of holding himself back – he doesn’t gasp, he doesn’t moan. Wants to. Doesn’t know who he’s saving himself for.
“He’s
I don't care, Steve whispers.
Maria visits him hours later to check up on him. She is armed with words like ‘help’ and ‘rehabilitation’ and ‘acute stress syndrome’ and Tony yells at her until he is crying and two junior agents are pointing guns at him and Maria’s sympathy has evaporated.
Tony throws the cuffs in a drawer, slams it. Sits in his chair. Looks at the flip phone sitting out on his desk.
- - -
“Steve,” Tony deadpans.
Tony snaps his hips forward and holds Steve’s head down.
“Dirty,” Tony croaks. “What–”
“I know,” Steve is saying. “I know.”
he thinks, because Tony should have a nap or take a shower or something that isn’t
Tony nods to himself, like all the energy has drained out of him in one great rush. “But I made a mess of everything,” he says. His fingers trace the metal thing in his chest, beneath the blanket; Steve can hear it sliding against Tony’s skin.
and he dances like he doesn’t know it. Like he doesn’t notice the eyes on him. He moves like a gymnast, all loose joints and strong quads and legs for days.
There’s enough of his blood on the floor that he can smell it.
Do me, Tony goads, because he wants the charade to be over. He wants to prove conclusively that he is right and Steve is wrong, that Steve is foolish, lovesick man for trying. He wants Steve to fail, and he wants him to hurt for his failing, and he wants to be right about something. He wants Steve to have to sit there and take his failure instead of running away.
“I am doing the
Steve sobs, like a dam is breaking in him, like this wicked charade has finally undone him.
Without the resonance of the bond it skirts the edge of cruelty.
He waits for his nose to stop tingling and goes for his wallet and fumbles over the hard edge of his Avengers ID card as he’s trying to slide his credit card back in. He takes it out, puts it on the table, lines it up neatly with the edge. Stares at his faded signature, and – Steve’s, the dark battery indicator light, the play of the dim basement light over Iron Man’s face.
Tony, Steve urges.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, “no, please,
Steve leaves. He’ll let this world burn.
Steve leans on their practiced, failsafe, ways to soothe Tony through his half-delirium. Steve's protocol is outdated but it is an attempt at kindness. He presses Tony's face into his neck. He strokes down the nape of his neck. He laves Tony's scar with his tongue. He tells Tony that he's beautiful, that he loves his body, that he wants to live inside him.
“Do you want your friend to come with us,” a pretty young medic is asking him.
He has lived this moment enough that he knows to anticipate the moment when the faceplate breaks apart, when his nose fractures. When he can finally see Steve’s eyes with his own.
He tries not to think about the face she’d make if she knew what he was doing right now.
The pain lasts longer, this time. Steve’s crying. He doesn’t understand what’s going on; he doesn’t live this life anymore. He wants peace.
“Tony,” Steve says. “I didn’t–”
Tony slides to his knees and settles himself in Steve’s lap, half sitting, half straddling him.
“Please don’t touch the body, sir,” the technician says.
, Leonard says, and Tony keeps his face from turning into a hideous mask of grief, uses Extremis to fix that because it has fallen to him to be keeper and if he doesn’t pass this stupid human exercise he won’t be able to protect this fragile ugly thing he’s built, the responsibility will be passed to someone else, someone who doesn’t understand, someone who will abuse the power, someone who will pay for the office and lobby to bring back Wideawake and Tony can’t do that –
