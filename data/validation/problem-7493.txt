Tony groaned and hit his head against the back of the couch. "You've

"If that's old-man for 'alcoholic,' I was…er… I mean
"Olivia!" he called after her. "Olivia, where are you going?"
She pointed and frowned. "But that's not th' right one! That's not the one that makes th' waffles that look like Daddy's shield."
"OK," Tony said, watching and not making any move to match Steve and change into something more appropriate for going outside, "and that usually means lay low and keep your head down."
"Yeah, well," he said and moved over to the tree to begin sorting through the presents, "that's what you do. You drink coffee and eat cookies and open presents with your family and friends."
It wasn't his life. It wasn't his universe, no matter what that other Cap had said to him, and no matter what Rhodey and Bruce said. Certain things just weren't matching up (No arc reactor? How was that even—?), and there was no sense in hoping for something that would never come to pass. He would always have the memories of his two days as a father, and he would always,
"I'm fine, Steve," he said and braced one hand on the arm of the couch and the other on Steve's leg to get the leverage he needed to get up. "I'm just a little tired. I'm going to go lay down. Have fun reminiscing with your pal."
"—but Steve's willing to make an honest man out of me—"
the record, Miss Carbonell, or on it?"
He made to sit up, but he just couldn't seem to get the right leverage, and he struggled and whined and fought it until he decided 'fuck it,' and sat there for what he figured was exactly thirty long, dull seconds.
"Not paying you to think, JARVIS," Tony said and
"Hey, man," Rhodey said, and Tony turned his attention to him, "I forgot to tell you before. I'm really sorry, but Pepper isn't able to make it and sends along her regards. Actually," he said and laughed some, "she's really, really pissed that you two just suddenly decided to do this crazy thing at the last minute, but she said, and I quote, '
"So, do you like sex better as a man or as a—"
Pepper was blinking now, avoiding eye contact, and Tony knew she was trying, oh, she was trying oh-so-hard not to cry, and he shot a look at Bruce to get the little brat out of there, hoping Bruce would get the idea. Bruce just gave him a funny look, frowning, head tilted, and Tony had to nod at the brat then nod at the door, and Bruce seemed to get it after that.
Thor smiled, clearly believing Steve's lie without issue. Jim just turned his disbelief on Steve and said a wary, "Right."
that harmed one hair on her head.
"Because clearly it must have been a boy," Natasha said.
Tony frowned at the dark and serious tone Steve's voice had taken on at those words. "Babe, it's OK. Nothing happened."
"Then he was a fucking moron," Barnes said and stood up. He reached out how discarded t-shirt and tugged it over his head.
"He's a menace and an embarrassment, and I swear to god, one of these days, I'm dumping him on Queens College's doorstep and running the other way."
explanation, and so he scooted closer and put his arms around Steve and held close to him, and with his mouth by Steve's ear, he whispered, "You're mine, too, you know."
anymore."
Steve was quiet a moment before he said, "Maybe," and as Tony nodded his understanding, he continued, "But he was a little…shy, I guess is the word I want to use? Like he wasn't sure what to make of her and he wasn't sure if he should even be anywhere near her. You didn't yell at him, did you?"
Tony stared into his cerulean eyes, and knowing he wasn't getting out of this, he frowned a little and said, "And you'll be right here the entire time?"
" the interviewer tried to interrupt, but the Steve on the screen put his hand up, his jaw tensing in that way that he knew it did when he was trying to stifle his frustrations.
a woman? With everything that goes with it?"
"That must've gone over well."
"I'm still not sure I believe it," the ever-helpful Darcy offered. Oh, right. He forgot that wherever Jane went, Darcy seemed to follow. He'd probably only ever met her twice before this. As far as he could remember, that was twice enough.
"Yeah," Steve murmured and, one arm carrying the weight, he reached up with his free hand and snagged a hold of the tiny fist she was waving in the air. "Kinda rambunctious for a newborn, aren't you?"
Barton was saying something about how popular the movie was, probably trying to explain the reasoning for the little figurine, but Tony just sat and brushed his thumb over the trinket, biting his lip as his eyes welled at the remembrance of a little voice singing — or attempting to sing — 'Let It Go' to him.
"Of course."
"No," Steve said with a shake of his head. "I mean why would it hit close to home?"
Without Tony or Olivia there to distract him, it now meant he was better able to listen to the Christmas music playing in the background — well, if he could even call it 'music.' He'd maybe recognized a handful of the songs he'd heard since the car this morning, and even then, it was only because the lyrics rang a bell to him and not the tunes themselves.
"Ignoring the problem isn't going to make it go away," Hill said. "Not if you keep doing stuff like this. If you're going to keep being seen in public together, I'm sorry, Steve, but I think you're going to have to bite the bullet here."
Tony returned her smile before he turned to Steve, who stood there stony-faced with his arms still folded. He swallowed and nodded, and he cleared his throat some and said a quiet, "Excuse me," before he turned and made his way up the steps, taking them two at a time as he dashed up, and Tony frowned and watched after him until he'd gotten to the top, and he turned to Pepper and said, "You know, I really don't think he finds me attractive this way."
As she took hold of Steve's license and began to inspect it, Tony slapped his own forms of ID in front of her.
"Tony, what are you talking...about...?" he asked, the last two words coming out slowly and with a hint of wonder as he stepped off onto what had once been his own private quarters and now looked like it had been turned into a studio.
"What's that?"
"Are you sure about this?" Steve asked, his voice soft.
personal? He skipped the first one and wrote 'no' for the second and third ones.
Which he was. God, he was, and that...that scared him sometimes. Because that which was given
Barnes shrugged. "It's the principle of the thing. It looks… It looks like you're going to a lot of trouble for him."
Barnes turned to Wilson but pointed at Tony. "Notice the lack of reprimand."
are trouble."
Rhodey just pocketed his phone. "She's the CEO of one of the largest companies in the world."
Tony stood in front of the dresser mirror, stripped of his dress and standing in nothing but his lacy white undergarments, facing front then turning to the side to look at the small-but-growing bump of his abdomen.
"Jesus, Steve, I know your refractory period is—"
He tapped the shiny, glass plate, and the heretofore black surface of it lit up. Steve looked closer and saw there a picture of a man that looked an awful lot like him holding that little girl in the crib upstairs, their cheeks pressed together as they looked into the lens of the camera. He was pointing at the camera, and she held that colorful plush toy in her small grasp. Neither one was exactly smiling, but there was a lightness and a softness to their looks, and Steve could understand it as being a much-loved candid photo of two people that Tony appeared to adore.
And then, in a flash, he was through the portal and gone, and the strange hum of energy and vibration was gone along with the delightful little chirps of the unconditional love Tony had quickly grown accustomed to over the last forty-eight hours. He stood, staring, at where the portal had been just moments before, waiting for it to open back up again, waiting for Olivia to come dashing  through—
Bucky made a 'hmm' sound like he still wasn't convinced, and Sam said, "You don't think it's...at all weird...that in the event of your unfortunate and untimely death that your baby girl is going to be raised by your husband's ex-girlfriend? I don't care about how smart or hot or accomplished she is. You're gonna let your baby girl be raised by your husband's ex?"
He squawked out a laugh as Barnes finally came to a stop right in front of Tony, and as his friends began to sing out a verse of 'Happy Birthday to You,' Tony looked down at the cake that was made in the shape and color of the Iron Man helmet, marveling at the richness of the colors and the pretty decent depiction of one of the more common armors he wore — usually to charity events and children's hospitals, as those were really the only places the public could get a good look at the armor.
Clearly not Steve, but
"Guess not," he said with a shrug then let Steve lead him across the street.
But instead of comforting him or assuring him, Steve's words had provided clarity for him. Yes, this was absolutely horrifying, and no, there was not exactly a manual that he could follow, but what this was, at its heart, was life. It was a life they had created out of their love for one another (all right and horniness). There was something almost...pure about it. This wasn't a life born at the bottom of a whiskey bottle or a quick getting-off-of-rocks-before-going-to-war. This wasn't a desperate need for an heir. This was two people absolutely crazy about each other creating a whole new life from that love. It was not done in the most conventional way, no, and there were bound to be complications of some sort that would arise from it, but it was, at its heart, creating life from love.
, if you want to know the truth."
Steve could only nod, his gaze falling upon the gorgeous sight of the one that got away. The dark suit accentuated his lithe build, the van dyke lent itself to a certain sophistication, and there was something about the way he stood now, the way he carried himself that screamed power and prestige.
where the budget went for it; it sure as hell wasn't for furnishings and décor). Steve was still a little put-out as the first two slices cooked on the pan, but by the time Tony took the finished product off and slid it over to Steve to drown in maple syrup, he was much better about things, happily taking the toast and drenching it in enough syrup to make Mrs. Butterworth blush.
Rhodey just stared at her then turned back to Tony, who put his hands up in defense and said, "It was a scrambled egg. How can you fuck up a scrambled egg?"
"A money pit," he said through his laughs, "to be perfectly honest. Don't ever buy a fixer-upper."
"Like it?"
Because the Captain was just as righteous and mighty and cunning and brilliant as he'd been made out to be all those years ago. And, as it turned out, the pictures and the newsreels didn't do the guy justice at all. He was fucking
But there was no way that little slip of powder blue paper stuck to his fridge was anything other than a signal from Bruce to the others that Tony and Steve had no more reason to argue over whether it should be 'Sarah Maria' or 'Maria Sarah.' Bruce, in what he probably thought was a 'subtle' way, had informed that gang of idiots of what he knew the sex of the gestating Stark- Rogers to-be, probably hoping Steve and Tony were too caught up in their own issues to notice.
Tony clamped his mouth shut, and if Steve's absolute refusal of his offer hurt him, he gave no indication of it. He nodded once and fiddled with something that was either a phone or a remote control or some other little black electronic that was so prevalent in this new century then said, "I think you're over-estimating your abilities, but whatever." He tossed whatever it was onto the worktable. "You don't want my help. Can't say I didn't offer it to you."
So, Steve just stood there, hands still tucked into his armpits, staring at the floor, and said, "I think we're definitely gonna have to tell them the truth now. And soon — sooner than I might have liked."
He reached up and cupped his hands under Tony's breasts and gave them a squeeze, and Tony actually felt a little bit of bile creep up in his throat at that. Jesus fuck, they weren't
a girl."
And then he smiled a little, one of those sad and self-deprecating sorts, and said, "Sometimes I just feel old and useless."
Tony, lazing on the couch as he directed Barnes where to pin a gathering of red, white, and blue streamers, shrugged and said, "You know, it's not just
Steve just continued to frown at him. "Is there anything else I can get you?"
Barton tilted his head in slight thought.
"I was stuck in a hippy's wet dream learning how to 'breathe' like I haven't been fucking doing it for forty-four years, and they went to the
"Relax," Bruce said, "I'm just going to give her a quick bath then you can have her right back."
at her, and Thor was holding him back from ripping her to pieces while Bruce tried to act as intermediary.
," came Natasha's gritted voice over the comm. "
to know what you wrote?"
Tony pulled back. "Wait, you were talking to Bruce about me? What, you can't come to me and—"
"Nat called general. Bucky got stuck with treasurer. Clint somehow convinced Thor that 'buck private' was the highest rank possible. Bruce was too toked out to give a shit. Rhodes we made an honorary member because he said we were idiots, but I think he was just jealous he didn't think of it first."
"Don't tell Steve, all right? Hopefully, we can get through this night without rubbing elbows with him."
What was going on here?
"No," Tony admitted with a slight sigh, "he wanted me to talk to you about that."
"Positive?"
technically the mother."
The car stopped, and the doors opened to his lab. The lights were dim; JARVIS must have closed up shop without being told to do so after Tony had left...
Huh. Should he tell Steve about that?
Steve looked like he was about to say something then stopped cold. "What?"
But the Cap just shoved his hands in his pockets, and he smiled lazily and said, "Call me 'Steve.' Unless you'd like me to start calling you 'Mr. Stark'?"
Steve jumped up from his chair some and looked in the direction of the entrance.
my parents?"
"Well," he said and rubbed his hand over the small swell some more, "now you know those traditions are bullshit. Who in their right mind would marry Barton? Wait, I just answered my own question.
what was once considered outrageous by film standards isn't, you know, that outrageous any longer."
"Did your heart just suddenly grow three sizes?"
They once again found themselves in an old Soviet bloc country, and Tony was really wishing that Steve's old pal would take a detour and head on down to some tropical island paradise for a change. OK, not like he or Steve had ever done one of these runs before, but in principal. He was starting to feel like he could use a vacation.
"Nay," Thor said with a sorrowful shake of the head. "The magic of Esmeralda the Divine does not work in that way."
"You didn't even try! You didn't even try to get her back, and when I said I thought I had an idea, you shot me down! You didn't
"What? You can see the future?" he asked, smirking just a little at her.
They exited, Tony wobbling some on heels that had been borrowed from Hill, and he shook Natasha's hand off his wrist then grappled onto her arm as tight as he could. She met his gaze for only a moment before she looked down and caught sight of the way his legs shook in uneasy balance.
Tony rolled his eyes and sat back against the couch. God, fuck, he could use an icepack right about now. And a change of underwear, probably. And he was pretty sure he did indeed tear whatever it was Bruce had stitched back up.
Steve just met his gaze, lazy, but with a fierce hunger shining in his blue depths. He hooked a finger around the lacy band of cloth that formed the crotch of Tony's underwear, pushing his knuckle in just the slightest to rub against Tony's clit, and said, his voice low and a little gravelly, "These come off. Everything else stays on."
"Yeah, well, certain bigmouth mechanics keep their mouths shut, they won't have to know, now will they?"
" he said, more emphatically than he should have, especially judging by Cap's surprised wince away from him. "No," he said, calmer now, "it's just… Miss Potts and I are no longer…"
The wave of nausea came back, and he grimaced and said, "You know Steve doesn't like to talk about—"
"She's going to be spoiled if people don't knock it off," Steve muttered, and Bucky sighed and shook his head.
"They were ugly and fake anyway," Wilson cut in to Barnes's head-shaking annoyance.
Maybe, if he repeated it enough times, he would come to convince himself at some point.
Steve let out a breath that was part-exhale and part-laugh. "Yeah," he said with a gentle nod. "Looks like. Are you OK? Does it hurt anywhere?"
"Oh, no? That's not what I hear," he said as he cuddled her and tickled her sides a little bit. "I hear you're a big, ol' screwball."
"I wouldn't say
"Just a couple minutes."
She tsked and shook her head. "Such a vulgarism," she muttered then paused a moment. "Although…not entirely untrue."
"Yeah?"
Steve glanced to him, side-eyeing him with a smile. "Thanks," he said as they began to make their way back to the flaming building.
He totally did not fall asleep within five minutes.
, I'll regret it for the rest of my life."
He reached down and scooped her up, and she laughed and allowed him to before she settled against him, her arms wrapped around his neck and her cheek pressed up against his.
"Whatever," Tony said with a roll of his eyes then gave him ten demerits for missing their team leader's birthday party.
She arched a perfectly shaped eyebrow. "Is that what it is? You feel even with your bonded that you need to earn your keep?"
Of making love to a woman for the first time in his life.
"You never used to be this sensitive about your appearance," she murmured, an odd smile on her face before she said, "
"Really?" Bruce asked, a wounded tone in his voice, and Tony couldn't tell if he was actually hurt or was faking it for humor. Judging by the smirks it netted him, Tony was certain he was going for humor.
. The one he'll charge headlong into a ball of fire for."
She nodded. "Yeah, he shoots things. Papa calls him a birdbrain."
" Steve murmured like the expression was foreign to him, evidently not hearing or not caring about the 'Asgardian homebrew' comment, and Tony shook his head and said to Barton, "Yeah, I don't think that expression even
He left the room, Rhodey worriedly muttering, "
Steve snorted a laugh, understanding the issue behind those words. “Yeah, OK. You get the ring, and I’ll get the kid.”
Steve laughed despite himself. "Well, that alone is worth a seventy-year wait."
"Stop, what?
Hill put a hand to his shoulder and gave it a squeeze, but Steve turned his attention over to Tony and asked, "You're OK with this?"
Tony groaned and rolled his eyes. Evidently, she wasn't the smartest kid in the world because clearly one that had a few brain cells to rub together would know not to say something like that in front of the person they were trying to keep it from.
"That I caught you jerking off?"
"Maybe you should tell him?"
"Then we do this."
Steve just shook his head and took a sip of his drink, but Tony turned to him and said, "Steve, I just thought of a new game we can play."
He pushed himself to his feet and went over to the dresser to pull out a pair of pajama pants — evidently, Tony was the only one that wanted to see him walking around in a pair of tight skivvies — and he pulled them on then went over to the bathroom and took a leak. He glanced at himself in the mirror before he left the room, and he put a hand to his face and rubbed his fingers under his chin to see how badly he needed a shave. Eh, not too bad. Tony had a thing about beard burn, but he could probably get away without shaving for at least half the day.
…before we ended up together, I was only with you to secure funding for the team—"
"Yeah."
"Didn't I tell you to buzz off?" he asked and glanced back at the over-marinated annoyance.
"Are you sure you're OK with it?" Steve asked, pulling his pants up and tucking his shirt into them.
"Uh, maybe because my old girlfriend doesn't act like a ten-year-old fighting to be king of the playground on a daily basis?"
"JARVIS, body scan. Pronto."
"What the hell?" Tony cried out at them while Steve said, "Thor, put me down," grinding out the words like he was chewing gravel.
about it. It looked like an average, normal living room — he supposed from 2015, anyway. He didn't have a good frame of reference. Most of what he'd seen had been 1939's impression of what the future would look like, and truth be told, it hadn't looked anything like this.
Google that, you hear me?"
"A medical doctor, Tony!" he cried. "I'm out of my depth here. I don't know what's wrong with you."
until that little stunt you pulled—"
That's right. The last time he'd been down here had been right before he'd sought Bruce out to run some tests on him. Fuck, it had only been a couple days, but it felt like so much longer than that.
"I'm going to murder you in your
"Yeah. Seriously, go. Take care of business. Don't worry about me. Besides, if anything happens, I'm sure JARVIS will be more than happy to alert you to it."
He swallowed and nodded slowly, blinking as he tried to take this in. "And Tony'll continue to age while I—"
Rhodey made a face, and he made a motion toward the elevator and said, "Is Bruce here? Maybe I'll go hang out with him for a little while."
"It's just a shame the formerly brainwashed assassin didn't want to come. Four times the miserable, four times the fun."
"You put two extra minutes on the clock. I saw you."
(Which brought him to another thing —
Sharon gave him a tight smile. "More than I wanted to know," she said with a nod.
—and by his childhood hero, no less. The hero he'd grown to hate as he got older and realized he was competing for his father's affections with a ghost. The hero that was nothing compared to the amazing and stubborn pain-in-the-ass behind the mask.
He looked up again and met Steve's eyes, and he reached up ever so gently and lifted his long, dark hair off his neck and shoulders to allow for Steve to fasten the collar around him. Steve's gaze burned into his, and he stared pointedly at Tony and said, "Are you absolutely sure? Don't do this only because you think I want this."
Steve handed her over, and Olivia, the little brat, immediately ceased her fussing as soon as she latched on.
But Jim shook his head and cut him off before he could try to explain himself. "No, man, I get it. I understand. I'd trust my kid with Pep before I trusted them with any of those idiots, too."
"Get back here! Are you kidding? Babe, if I had my way, it would be just you, me, and now her—" he motioned to the baby, "—for the rest of our lives. So, no, I don't mind you hanging around. In fact, I want you hanging around. I want you
"Uh, you mean go get…?" He motioned upstairs, pointing a finger in that direction, and Tony laughed some.
Tony considered him a moment, peering at him, before he shrugged and seemed to decide if wasn't worth the effort.
He stared at them a few more moments, trying to place where he'd come across this photograph before, staring at their faces as though they could give them the answers, and out of the corner of his eye, he spotted Ella, a funny look on her face as she glanced between the portrait on the wall and Tony, like she saw something there. Tony turned and was about to ask her what she was thinking of, but she shook her head as though to clear her mind of the thought and gave her attendees a broad smile.
The others all murmured their agreement as they sat staring at the TV, and Tony rolled his eyes while Steve went over and switched the set off, engendering groans from the Avengers, Wilson, and Rhodey, who was still in town.
"You were definitely higher on the list than the birdbrain," Tony said.
Steve just shook his head a little, and he reached down and held Tony's face in his hands. "Be good. Get actual work done." He then nodded his head in Barnes's direction and said, "He's playing it off, but the arm's really bothering him." And then, his eyes went a little soft and concerned. "You can… You can help, right?"
"Claims to."
Tony would have asked 'what home?' but he already knew the fucking answer, which he felt like a punch to the gut.
"Make it so you age," she replied simply.
She exhaled a breath through her nose and shook her head a little. "No, I mean don't you want to know if it's a boy or a girl."

She patted his arms then made for the direction of her bedroom. "Let me get my bag and then you can buy me breakfast."
"Nah," Wilson said, still watching things through his phone, "we'll allow it this time. We'll need it for the highlight reel for your fiftieth."
"You're no fun," Tony said and waved Steve off with a blasé motion of his hand but then added, "But when we do go — 'cause we're going — where do you want to go? Belize? Bora Bora? Bermuda? Some other magical tropical isle that starts with a 'B'?"
But Steve, eyes shining, frowned and said, "You keep saying 'other universe.' Why?"
"Yeah, sure, great job. Hey, you might want to rethink the 'James Anthony,'" Barnes said, making a face as he looked down to where Bruce was, with the aid of DUM-E, wiping off and looking over the squalling new life he held in his hands.
"You flipped a coin for the middle name."
bathroom: sleek, expensive, large. He'd never seen a bathroom like this before. He'd never seen a tub that large before, and two —
"Nothing you can do," Steve said but wouldn't look at him.
Steve barked out a laugh while Tony took a gulp of punch, and he smacked his lips some and said, "So, uh, is there
He snapped it up and read the read-out, and he choked on a breath when he saw that it was a call being placed by none other than Captain America himself. Ordinarily, his first thought would be to muse aloud to Rhodey, "
She nodded at the baby. "But you don't deny that she's brought you even closer together — that your bond has grown and strengthened through her."

"I just realized," he said and glanced down at himself. "I'm, uh…" He reached up and scratched the back of his head. "I'm still kind of, um,
"Uh, yeah, sorry, pea pod. Already called it."
you can love 'Free Bird' but not those other ones."
"I do not entirely know. I only know she ran afoul of someone she should not have." He directed his attention to Tony and added, "I'm sorry, my friend. I fear this is what you shall be 'til the end of your days."
For being forty-something, Tony was still pretty damned spry.
Tony sighed out a heavy breath. "OK, we've gone over this, so I think you're just at the point of fishing for compliments now. I love you. Of course I care. Barnes would probably care more. I never rooted for the Brooklyn Dodgers. I couldn't. They ceased to be from Brooklyn a dozen years before I was even born. Barnes remembers being there at Dodger Stadium with you."
Pepper went silent a moment, blinking like she couldn't believe what she'd just heard. "You? Actually think something's a
"He said a walk from Midtown to SoHo would do wonders for me."
"Of your pal?" Barton asked.
"No, I get it. Prince of Asgard. And he's built. Firm. Pretty eyes. Nice smile. Very charming and courageous. And worthy! Don't forget worthy. You want to know if you're worthy of lifting Thor's
"Evidently, JARVIS thought it was better to get us the powered stuff, which requires boiling and mixing and shit like that."
"In a normal situation, I might be," he admitted, his steady gaze boring into Tony as a means of providing the stability and comfort Tony so desperately needed. "But this is far from a normal — let alone ideal — situation, and I don't want you putting yourself into anything that might be considered even remotely dangerous. We are also in a terribly risky occupation and should by no means be responsible for the welfare of a child. We're both orphans. We know what that's like. I don't care if we did miraculously create a life together. Avengers Tower is the last place on earth you should want to raise a child. Never mind the fact that Bruce said this would be incredibly high-risk. I mean, sure, a child that's both you and me? That would be amazing. But you're the one that I want, Tony. You're the one I'm in love with. You're the one I always want at my side. I'm not going to risk you for anything. Not even something like this."
. It's a girl."
"Come on," he murmured to his suddenly smelly daughter. "Let's go see if we can sweet-talk Papa."
"Or he's fucking programmed to wait until he knows you have him in his confidence again. Maybe it's a psychological thing. Hydra doesn't just want you to suffer, Steve, they want to crush you as they do it. What better way than to make you die by the hand of the person you trust most in the world?"
"Yeah, but, it's not actually..." He glanced back and saw that DUM-E was holding fast to the magnifying glass, awaiting further instruction. "Someone's controlling it."
"Mmm…I love you so much, old man," he murmured and pressed a light kiss against Steve's lips. "But no," he said after he parted.
"No," Steve said with a slight shake of his head. "Not that— I mean what was that about bonds severing and family passing?"
"Yeah, well," he said and turned back to the computer to close out the program. "Not my fault he didn't live long enough to be able to.
"Nice," Rhodey said with a nod.
Bruce just gave his chosen pet-name-of-the-moment an odd smile then glanced around and said, "Gee, I hope Steve didn't get lost or something."
"Hey! I do not
"What about when we're referring to you? Are you a 'him' or a 'her'?"
He grabbed the plate and set it down in front of Olivia, and she happily grabbed the slice of toast and bit into it then said, with a mouthful of toasted bread, "Papa, I need a fork."
Sam scoffed. "Get off your high horse. I remember some pretty fierce competitions in college, and I distinctly remember you throwing the controller so hard that it cracked the picture tube."
Three minutes. Steve could probably get him off in three minutes. They had a bathroom in this place, right?
"Could not pay me enough to trade places with you," Barton said with a laugh, and Romanoff smacked him. "Ow! Nat! Quit it!"
The cab driver couldn't be bothered. The people on the street couldn't be bothered. The people in the office lobby as they waited for the elevator couldn't be bothered. The only thing anyone asked when they were crowded into the elevator together was if Steve would hit the button for a given floor. By the time they got to the floor, Tony didn't know if he was relived or insulted by it. Nobody had paid attention. Nobody had cared. Nobody had ambushed them.
Tony broke the kiss, slowly, like he was forcing himself not to be such a glutton, his eyes closed as his lips hovered by Steve's mouth, and quietly, like a prayer, he said, "Go out with me."

She nodded, and Rhodey set the pictures aside before he turned to Tony and said, "Having fun?"
"Every woman reacts differently to it," Bruce said, and Tony made a mental note to lob something at Bruce's head the moment he had the ambition to do so. "Some women are very vocal. Some women are quieter. It really just depends."
Steve just swallowed, and after passing off the bouquet to Natasha, he and Steve joined hands, and the clerk began the ceremony.
"There's a diner around here," Tony said, and the vision of earlier times dissipated, replaced by the here-and-now. "They stay open all night. Thought maybe you could use a cup of joe that doesn't taste too much like used motor oil."
Barnes made an utterance of disgust, and Tony turned back in time to see him push himself away from where he rested against the back of the couch then take several long strides around it. With a frustrated groan, he sank down onto a cushion, arms braced over his knees as he perched on the edge and stared at the blank space beneath the TV. Tony stared at him rather pointedly, making sure that Natasha saw that he saw something was up with Barnes, and as explanation, she simply said, "Brings back too many memories for him."
He grumbled something under his breath and bit halfway into the egg roll, chewing and muttering as he did so. Tony had to bite his lips to keep from smiling too much.
"Yeah," he said like he was slightly ashamed. "I know I wanted to, but I just
"Tony, are you— Tony, what are you—?"
"Look, Steve, you can either support me on this, or you can get lost. I know it's crazy, and I know it's insane, and I know I'm just asking for trouble, but I want this, Steve, I do. I can't explain it. I just… I need this."
was talking about.
And then Natasha was there, pulling him into her arms and murmuring in Russian, soft and soothing words as she rubbed his back and tightened her embrace of him.
"Yeah, well," he said, breezy and cool as he typed in the last code, "sometimes Steve doesn't know what he's talking about."
Natasha shrugged, and Tony looked between her and Pepper and said, "Seriously, how did you even get in?"
He bent down and pressed a kiss against the crown of Steve's head, and Steve buried his face in his hands and muttered, "I can't believe you told them that."
Her face went a little pinched all of a sudden, her eyes narrowing, her lips pursing, and a deep crease forming between her brows. It startled him a bit because up until that moment, even Tony could admit that she bore a striking resemblance to him — much as he hated to admit that — but this…this was not him. At all.
Quarters. OK, he could cut it into quarters. If she'd wanted bite-sized pieces, 'Papa' was getting his ass up here and doing it himself.
He shrugged. "At least until I give… At least until it's born."
. Also the other Avengers, but I'm pretty sure most of that junk came from Santa."
"You didn't come," Steve mumbled.

Then again, hadn't he accepted this 'Tony' was his deepest, darkest fantasy come to life? He closed his eyes and swallowed at the memory of 'Tony' sitting beside him in bed and stretching out the last vestiges of sleep from that gorgeous lithe, tawny body.
"No, probably not. But I need it now, Steve. I
"Just the one," Steve said, and Tony held his gaze a moment longer before he sat back down and took another bite of the jelly-slathered toast.
"Uh," Other Tony said and furrowed his brow, glancing up to the ceiling in thought, for some reason not thinking Tony's question was in any way not any of his business. "Sixty-seven? I think," he said, turning back to Tony. "Sixty-eight at the end of the year."
"But that's what it's for. It would be different if this was some kind of
Olivia jumped up and tried to get closer to the phone. "Daddy, I love you! When're y' comin' home? I miss you!"
Tony spent a few moments figuring out exactly what Thor had said before he nodded and said, "I will take postcards."
He realized he really,
Steve motioned to the tablet on the nightstand. "Been doing some reading. It's called 'quickening,' that fluttering you felt." He grabbed his tablet and turned the display back on, and he swiped a few times before he added, "It's not the first time the fetus moves, it's just when you begin to feel it. It's really just involuntary movements at this point in time, but they describe all sorts of ways the fetus moves at this point — grabbing its feet, sucking its fingers—"
what Tony was staring at.
"Oh!" Thor said brightly. "I just mean to say, my friend, that you are most welcome to spend your days in the halls of Asgard once your loved ones have departed—"
Steve just nodded, his gaze turning back to the photos in his hands.
" Natasha asked and took a sip of her champagne.
"All right. Any idea where this book is?"
Tony just tightened his arms around himself, and Steve said, "Is that a bad thing?"
them. I think you've got the feeding down."
Steve, eyes still on the collar, moistened his lips, and he looked up and met Tony's gaze, something hard and predatory almost coming into his eyes. Tony hadn't seen that look in a long time, and it made a shiver run down his spine and something clench in that region he still hadn't figured out a better term than 'pussy' for.
Tony snorted a laugh and set the iron down to cook. "Yeah, good luck with that. He and the Air Force have this, like, symbiotic relationship with each other. They just can't quit each other."
There was a cascading thump from the corner, and Steve jumped back, accidentally nipping Tony's lip as he did so. He went to apologize, but Tony, hand to his lip, just shook his head and said, "It's fine. Don't worry about it." He pulled his hand away and inspected it. "No blood. We're good."
"But are you trying to suggest that Miss Carbonell is in fact—"
The elevator door opened, and Bruce called out, "Hey, Tony, I was talking with Dr. Foster, and I think I might have something—"
Barnes sat up a little, DUM-E pulling away but still holding tight to that stupid magnifying glass, and he flexed his hand and wiggled his fingers and did a sort of windmill motion with his arm. He seemed impressed by the range of motion, if the look of awe on his face was anything to go by, and he glanced over at Tony and said, "Your old man coulda learned a thing or two from you."
"You seemed very happy with each other."
"I'd rather not find out," he said with a resigned breath before he continued his train of thought. "I think Sharon would be a good fit for the team, too. She's good, she's smart—"
Tony stared at him, that odd sort of look on his face that he got when he was stuck for something to say but still didn't agree with what he was hearing. He cocked his head to the side a little bit, lips pulled into a slight smile, and finally said, "What, have you been having secret chats with the space case?"
"Do you want to watch me pleasure myself? Get myself all worked up and writhing for you? Panting out your name? Desperate. Wanton. Thinking only of you as I work myself into a frenzy?"
Tony must have been pretty far gone with want if he didn't even put up a fight. He just lifted his ass off the bed and let Steve shove a pillow beneath him, and he adjusted himself and preened a little and said, "You think about that a lot, don't you?"
Natasha just shot a look at Bruce, but Bruce didn't shrink away and instead held his ground as he said, "You know it would be."
Steve tweaked another smile at him before he turned and strolled out of the kitchen, baby still cradled against his broad chest, and Tony sighed and turned to take in the sight of pancake flour that coated the counter and the cabinets —
Natasha just shrugged and sank back into the chair, mug of coffee in her hands as she pulled her

but circumstances had changed quite a bit in the past thirty-six hours, and so without a word, he accepted the call and said a breezy, "Hey, Cap! What's got you up at this hour?"
Steve just put his hands on his shoulders and made like he was going to knead them, but Tony smacked them away and said, "No, no, that's taped, too."

Which...really wasn't the smartest move on his part, as his nipples weren't terribly oversensitive, but he really didn't need them poking out of his shirt at seven-thirty in the morning if he could help it, nor did he need to do anything that might have the unintended consequence of calling his dick to attention, either. So far so good on the latter front.
"Mmm... General Tso's and fried dumplings?"
Barnes stood there, arms folded and glower on his face. "You're not dyin', not when you got Steve's kid to take care of. Steve's kid's in the same position he was. Already lost a father. Can't afford to lose a…mother…too." Barnes gave him a funny look. "Is that what we're calling you?"

"You know, Tony, Bruce
"I don't think your powers can give me what I want."
"Really?" he muttered. "Because I'm pretty fucking mortified at the moment."
"It wouldn't be me they'd attack," he said, sounding almost bitter at the fact. "It would be you —
Bruce probably alerted to the disturbance by JARVIS. Tony steeled himself for…something… especially considering how Cap's jaw was set in a firm line, but to his everlasting shock, Cap just reached up and grasped him by the back of the head before he leaned down and crushed their mouths together, showing no mercy as, tasting of peppermint schnapps of all things, he all but plundered Tony's mouth with the most bruising, passionate kiss he'd ever experienced.
"What?" Tony asked in genuine surprise. "Are you kidding me?"
"He wanted to make me happy. I wanted to go out. It would make me happy, so we went out."
for the care of our as-of-yet unborn child is going to make an iota of difference."
Look, he had lucked out. Even he could admit he had fucking lucked out. This could have happened to anyone in the world, anyone that didn't have the barest of means to deal with it, but it had happened to him, and that was maybe one of the luckiest things ever to happen to anyone.
"Yeah, no he's not," came Tony's sleep-groggy voice from upstairs.
Barton snorted. "Of course," he said and took a sip. "How else are you supposed to survive these things?"
Tony frowned and sat back a little. "Why not?" he asked, his arms' grasp on Steve's shoulders falling away and Steve's hand falling away from his belly.
a reflection on you. That's all on me. But I can jerk you off. I've done it before, and as I recall, it went over pretty well."
"I guess I don't have to ask who the captain was."
"Oh."
'Captain Stark.'"
"Are you sure?" Steve asked after a moment.
each other.
He paused a moment then grinned at Tony.
What? Steve had spent seventy years as a popsicle. It didn't mean he didn't love him. It just meant he'd spent seventy years in a deep-freeze, and Tony sometimes had the sense of humor of a fifteen-year-old.
Steve stopped petting his hair, and he reached down and took a gentle hold of Tony's chin again. He reached up with his thumb and brushed the pad of it against Tony's lower lip, gently, back and forth, almost like he was contemplating something.
"But I don't think it's
"Doesn't matter."
She was practically giddy, and she went to jump out of her chair presumably to demonstrate, but Tony reached out to her and said, "Yeah, not tonight, kiddo. And Papa's going to have to have himself a talk with Romano—
Tony snorted out a laugh. "If that were the case, maybe he would actually work as intended instead of like an overgrown, overindulged puppy." He looked at DUM-E and added, "I made you, kid. I know you. Don't think you're fooling me with that shit you pull. You might have Steve wrapped around your claw, but I see right through you, you overgrown bucket of bolts."
"Yeah, it's like a parasite or a tumor. And tumors you usually have to hack out."
Natasha helped him dress and made sure the French twist the hairdresser had done for him was still firmly in place, those expert tendrils framing his face, and when she was done, she turned him toward the full-length mirror in her suite and said, "Well?"
He nodded his understanding, and then Bruce was off, bypassing Barnes, who was just stepping off the elevator into the penthouse as Bruce was going to step on. Fuck, was it an elevator or a revolving door? Bruce left, and Barnes stood by the elevator a moment before he took a breath and seemingly summed up whatever courage he thought he needed to push into the living area.
"And a very good-looking one at that," Natasha said and raised her champagne glass to him.
Pepper sighed on the other end of the line, and Tony was certain she was pinching the bridge of her nose. He could have picture-chatted her, he supposed, but it was easier to make faces and roll his eyes and do other stuff when he didn't have someone watching his every move.
"You act like you think he's some worthless piece of junk."
. It had nothing to do with this."
Tony just stared at her a moment. "You make it sound like you've encountered us before."
"I didn't say that," Steve said with a shake of his head over the chuckles of the other attendees. "And when did you try to—"
"I mean, we could probably walk," Tony said as Steve slid into the heated leather passenger seat. Steve didn't even own a car let alone one that had heated leather seats. "But it's after midnight, and we're in Manhattan. It's not Morningside — is that still a bad part? — but I'd rather not take my chances. I don't know about you."
He brought up his other hand and braced it against the shower wall, nails from both hands now digging into the tile and, for all he knew, loosening them from the wall. 'Happy place' wasn't working, and so he tried to remember some of the other suggestions from that class, finally remembering to focus on something that wasn't the pain. When counting backwards from one hundred didn't work any better than his 'happy place' did, he turned his attention to his equations, and he ran through those over and over until the pain had subsided, and as it began to die down, he pressed his forehead against the cool tile coated with warm condensation, and he rubbed his head back and forth a few times then exhaled a shaky breath and said, "When he gets back, I'm cutting his balls off."
Rhodey glanced over at Steve a moment then turned back to Tony, "Next to Pep, he's the only one I haven't lain awake at night hoping you'd come to your senses about and drop 'em like a rock."
The collective shrug he got was all that he needed, and he pulled at his shirt and unhooked the cup and pulled the baby to his breast, Olivia latching on without a fight.
weird kind of bondage fetish?" Sam mused.
He slammed his way in, found to his ever-lasting relief that it was empty, and leaned back against the door, exhaling a breath that maybe sounded like a bit of a moan.
to refute it because he really, really, really wanted Steve there with him, and he shuffled off to the bathroom adjacent to the lab and closed the door behind him.
The witch braced her elbows on the table and pressed her fingertips together as though forming a steeple with her hands.
"I mean," he said, and there was a funny tone to his voice that was equal parts amusement and frustration, "that you're a goddamned adrenaline junkie, and your entire existence in life now seems to be finding new and unusual ways of trying to give me a stroke by pulling one dumbass move after another. So yes, you jump off of things or out of things or into things because you think you're always going to land on your feet except, you know what? You're made of flesh and blood just like the rest of us. Knock. It. Off."
"Nothing," he muttered.

A streak of ferocious anger flashed over Pepper's face. "Steve—"

Towel still wrapped up in his hair, he pulled the one off his torso and dried himself off, and he rolled his eyes as the super solider spawn within him decided it was time to rouse from his nap.
"I'm fine. Honest. It's just…a lot to take in, you know? A lot to— I feel like a fucking yo-yo being yanked around all over the place."
As Barnes made one of those faces like he couldn't believe what he'd gotten himself into, Wilson and Barton exchanged looks, and Barton turned to Tony and said, "Wait, why is this the first I'm hearing about this?"
Bruce looked between them, almost like he wasn't sure which one to listen to, and Tony turned to Steve and said, "
When the flash dimmed, and the dust settled, Tony saw standing in his living room a tall, elegant- looking woman with long, honey-kissed hair and emerald-green eyes. She was lank but firm, her gown pale gossamer and pooling on the floor at her feet. There was an air of regality and innocence about her, an earnest curve to her rouged-tinted lips that made Tony want to run for the hills because the last time he'd seen that look — that face — he'd, well, been turned into a woman.
"He's not my—" she started to say then shook her head.
"Nope!" Tony said. "Don't
Tony waved him away and said, "Go. Play with your spores and fungus…things…" but Steve said, "Actually, the doctor wants Tony to have an ultrasound as well."
He hummed a little more and reached up to nibble at Steve's jaw, and Steve was able to formulate a thought that went a little something like, "You know, we really…shouldn't…do…this here. We should go back…"
"Are you OK?" he asked and went back to rubbing his hands up and down Tony's arms.
"Yeah, definitely. They say boys are easier to raise, anyway, and as awesome as we are at being Avengers, I'm not sure that would automatically translate into being parents."
"Yeah, I never got around to finishing that one, did I?" Steve murmured as he looked at the drawing of what was clearly his memory of their Rockefeller Center Skating Rink 'marriage proposal.' It was a joke proposal. They were already engaged by that point. They even had rings. But Tony had mentioned that Steve's actual proposal had left much to be desired, and inspired by an actual proposal on the ice rink down below where they stood, Steve had gotten down on one knee in front of thousands of tourists and proposed to Tony the old-fashioned way.
Which was fine because evidently that was the moment that Tony realized there was something... off...about their current situation, and with a slight amount of panic rising in his voice, he said, "Steve? Why do I sound funny?"
Barton pulled the carton of eggs from the fridge and went over to the stove. "Communal kitchen, Stark," he said and grabbed the frying pan Tony had used to fry up his and Steve's breakfast.
Steve snorted a laugh and said, “Rendezvous in the living room in thirty seconds,” and stepped off the elevator onto the penthouse floor.
Steve glanced up and smiled at him, but the connection didn't last long before Steve was glancing away and the smile was fading from his face. Tony frowned, catching the look he didn't do a very good job of hiding, and said, "What?"
So, this
"Yeah."
She gave him a gentle shove down onto the plush cushion, and he sat and snuffled some more, wiping tears away and feeling fucking stupid for losing control over himself like that.
"Hey, babe," he said, "look at me."
"Yeah, well," Tony said and motioned to the table, "this is the best that I've got."
"Doesn't matter!"
wanted to see movies about video games.
"I thought we weren't going to see you for a while?"
But, if Tony was truly on the level here, all of those worries were from a long, long time ago. Bucky was dead, and Tony was right. No amount of overblown or overdramatic mourning was going to bring him back. Bucky would want him to go on living his life, he'd want him to be happy, and maybe that was the best way to honor his friend's memory: to finally
JARVIS seemingly finished the evaluation, the grid of lines disappearing and the regular lights coming up again, and Tony stood back at his computer and made to fold his arms, but the new terrain seemed to throw him off, and he scowled and looked down and tried to figure out just how in the hell he was supposed to fold his arms now that he had pronounced breasts on his chest instead of relatively flat pectorals.
"And you're very murder-y looking. What's your point?"
The table went quiet again at that — even little noisemaker Olivia keeping silent as she watched the adults — and as Steve shook his head, unsure of what even to say, Jim let out a mournful, "Man, I coulda been home in Philly eating pumpkin pie."
"You're a troll," he muttered.
more baggage there for both of them than there was for either him or Steve.
"Well, I can promise to try."
Tony whined, completely sidestepping Bruce's last comments. "Come on, just a quick checkup. Turn your head and cough. Let me check your reflexes. Bend over so I can check your prostate. You know, the usual."
Tony looked down at himself and considered this. "Yeah, you're probably right. Don't think they'd look good on this figure, either. No, I take that back. I could totally make them work, and I would look fucking fantastic. But no, I figure, look, I'm stuck like this for the next, what, five months? Maybe I should, I don't know,
There was a little smile on Pepper's face as she said, "Well, I didn't want to say anything…"
Tony nodded. "OK, point taken. Don't die."
But god, did it look familiar.

Tony Stark. I mean, yeah, I look like this, but I
Steve nodded behind him. "This."
Evidently the general layout of the penthouse was pretty damned close to what Olivia was used to because she navigated that floor like she'd been living there her whole life, and so far as she probably knew, she had.
He smacked a kiss to the top of Tony's head, and Tony said, "You call me that again, there's a couch in our apartment with your name on it."
"Oh, yeah," she said and looked down at it. "These aren't the real 'vengers. These are the cartoon 'vengers that Papa says aren't anything like the real 'vengers."
Tony frowned and looked at it. "What? I followed the directions on the box. I'm not completely helpless in the kitchen, and according to my daughter, I'm a pretty good cook. The extent of the Cap's abilities seem to be boiling water."
Steve barked out a laugh a little more loudly than he might have liked, and he tightened his hold just a little bit on Olivia and pressed another candy cane shape into the dough.
Tony raised an eyebrow.
"For not being there the past few years. For ending things the way I did—
Tony shrugged and went back to picking at his own plate. "Not your fault. No big deal. Not something I really want to talk about on Christmas, though, so if we could change the subject…"
"You 'n' Daddy hafta talk about it, don't you? That's what you said when Unca Hawky let me play with the bow and arrow."
"No offense, Tony," Bruce said, "but you seem to have put an awful lot of thought into the Cap's sexual preferences."
"OK, Steve, I know I'm not as...up-to-date with things as you are, but even I know about the it's-not-you-it's-me bullshit. Actually, I thought that was only for...you know, relationships — romantic relationships."
"Can we see?" Hill asked, and Tony heaved out a breath and opened the door to show them what he looked like. He held his breath as he waited for them to make their judgment on him, and both women just gave him knowing and approving smiles before Natasha said, "I told you," and Hill replied with, "I never doubted you for a second."
"See, Steve?
Tony, god help him, actually thought about this. "Well, clearly, I'd want to say 'Danny,' but if I'm being honest with myself—" he sighed, "—yeah, actually probably 'Sandy' — not," he countered quickly, "because I'm a woman but because Sandy was kind of the rich, prissy princess and Danny was the ne'er-do-well from the wrong side of the tracks, and, yeah, in that case, I'm probably more 'Sandy' and the guy that grew up in the shitty Brooklyn tenement during the Depression is probably more 'Danny.'"
"I didn't say that—"
"I don't deserve—"
DUM-E was over in his station, charging, but he was raising his arm slowly, almost deviously, like he was trying to get a look at who this new person was in the lab without getting caught doing it.
Bruce stared at him, and Tony sighed a little and thought about this.
"It's you," he said before he could stop himself, and Cap turned his attention back from the woman to Tony. "You... It's your expression that I kept seeing on her face. How...? How is that possible? She's my daughter, isn't she?"
? What's that supposed to mean?"
"I know what it's about, Steve, and you don't always have to play knight in red-white-and-blue armor."
"Why are you embarrassed?" Tony asked. "You should be shouting that shit from the rooftops. In fact, maybe I'll go do it for you."
"What's
They said their 'goodbyes,' and the connection cut out. He looked down at the phone in his hand with its blank screen, and he met Pepper's concerned eyes as she reached out and touched his hair.
"Please. He's been seen all over town with her! You saw the news. She's pregnant,
"Well, I wasn't boyfriend-of-the-year material, either. But I know that was one of her problems. She was afraid I was going to die, and she couldn't handle that." He shrugged. "Whatever, it happens."
Cap paused a moment and grimaced, like he'd suddenly thought better of what he'd wanted to ask. "Nah," he said and rubbed the back of his neck, "maybe I don't want to know."
He scoffed and said, "Yeah, well, that's kind of hard to give you seeing as this
Until then, Steve could do nothing but watch from the sidelines and hope Tony found his peace.

"I'm fine," he said and totally was not gritting his teeth. "I'm just…tired, I suppose."
"—the answer is 'yes.'"
He could do this. He could totally do this. He'd promised Steve, and even he himself was…trying to make an effort.
"I could suck you off?"
"And you're not paying attention to the crosswalks."
And then a smiley-face. An honest-to-god smiley. This man was sick.
"Twenty-five,"  Barton said.  "Don't exaggerate."
Steve stared at him a moment before he moved to set his plate and his tablet aside, and as Tony went to ask what he was doing, Steve turned back to him—
of you. Natasha Carbonell and Tony Stark. They'd attack both of you. Call 'Natasha' every sexist and derogatory name in the book. Drag up every single sordid thing Tony Stark ever did in the past. I'm not letting them do that, and I'm especially
Steve made a sour face at the thought. Although, nothing that Bucky had said pinged false to him. Schmidt had been a pushy, obstinate sort, and Steve's fight-or-flight instincts had always reared up whenever the guy was around, which had been often given that both he and Steve were doing graduate course work, their schedules often overlapped, and Schmidt had taken a weird sort of liking to him.
Steve didn't look any more convinced by Tony's words than he had prior to when he started speaking, but he still nodded and dropped his arms then went over to the collection of wrapped gifts piled in the corner. Barnes watched him walk away a moment then turned to the others and said, "It really bothers him that much?"
Steve, still with his hands around his hot chocolate, said, "Well, I didn't want to be right on top of you."
"That's what they say," he said with a shrug only to have JARVIS intone from on high, "
Barnes would have succumbed to the temptation — or the conditioning — and turned traitor on them. He didn't think Barnes would have done it willingly, anyway. But it was hard to say because it was an unknown they would never be able to know. Tony would never be able to go back in time and sit his ass down and let the others handle the breach any more than he would be able to go back and tell Steve he was in labor and he didn't want him to leave, goddamn it, because he needed him to stay by his side and coach him through the birth of their child. He could never know what would have happened had he decided to heed the warnings and sit the battle out. The most he could do was accept that it had happened the way it had happened and move on from that.
But whatever — whoever — he was, he was definitely changed now and forever. And honestly...he was more OK with that than his logical mind told him he had any right to be. Not just from a physical or health standpoint but from an identity standpoint, too. He might have fought against it at first, and he might have hated it for months afterwards, but honestly…he was kind of OK with how he was. He'd come to accept it. Maybe not a choice he'd made willingly, but far from the worst thing that had ever been done to him. Besides, at least his sternum hadn't had to be rebuilt in this body. There was an odd comfort in knowing his breastbone was in one solid piece, something he hadn't known for several years now.
"You have a bit of a reputation," Sam said by way of an explanation.
But he could get through it. It would be fine. He could get out of this. He could put any impure thoughts about the kid to the side. It would be easy. He just had to focus. Focus on the rules, the guidelines, the policies that dealt with things like this. It shouldn’t be a problem. And if it
He was doing the same now, breathing slow and deliberate, and Tony loved how he turned into a contented kitten in his hands.
“Probably feel even better when you lie down, huh?”
“That was a long time ago now, Tony,” she said dangerously.  “Let it go.”
Tony’s eyes narrowed a bit as he held up the smaller t-shirt. He raised his eyebrows at Steve. “And just who, may I ask, does this belong to, Steven Rogers?”

But there was

have autonomy over that. Esmeralda might have taken my autonomy over my own body away from me — again,
This newest pain was sharper than the previous ones had been, and he slapped a hand against the wall and dug his nails into the sand-colored tile that surrounded him. He closed his eyes and squeezed them tight, and he gritted his teeth yet again and tried to imagine his happy place. Tried to imagine his lab. Working. Steve sitting on the couch. Sketching. Humoring DUM-E by tossing balled-up pieces of paper and having him 'fetch' them. Light banter back and forth. Steve smiling at him, that soft one he gave to him, the one Tony had never seen him give to anyone else. No, that one was his. That one was special for him. Steve getting up from the couch, leaving the sketchpad on the table, striding over to him, a tight pair of jeans and an even tighter t-shirt. Gray— no, blue— no, maybe gray. Maybe red? Coming up behind him. Putting his arms around his waist. Nuzzling his neck. Letting his hand slide down to Tony's groin, pressing the heel of his palm in, rubbing it against his half-hard shaft. Tony moaning in pleas—
Steve jumped up. He'd had enough of this.
"Why would they do this to you?" yet another person asked.
"I'm sorry," Steve said as Tony took another sip of his juice. "I used to envy kids that still had their dads. Never thought that having one could be worse than not having one."
"Thanks," he said and let Barton help him up. He grimaced as he set weight on his left leg, and Barton noticed and raised an eyebrow at him.
Tony just got up off the bed, grimacing a little at the ache, and went over to the bassinette. Olivia was awake and waving her arms in the air, wiggling in the swaddle she'd somehow come loose from, and Tony scooped her up, blankets and all, and carried her over to the bed.
Tony just eyed him a moment and nodded, and he made to walk into the living room, but Steve caught him by the waist, and they stood together in the doorway a moment, their eyes dancing together, and Tony seemed to understand what Steve wanted — what he'd wanted from the moment he'd set eyes on Tony this morning — as much as Steve understood what Tony was looking for.
Tony snorted a laugh and dropped the battered bread onto the griddle pan. "I'll see if I'm feeling up to it later."
Tony frowned and glanced at him. "Thought you knew about it?"
"Yeah, bullshit. Did you see something?"
"Wait, hold on," Rhodey said and stood back a step. "An alternate universe kid showing up on your doorstep is perfectly believable, but Captain America having the hots for you is a bridge too far?"
He shrugged but didn't deny.
Steve scowled right on back to her, and she waved her hands at him like she was trying to clear the air and said, "This isn't getting us anywhere."
Bruce shrugged, and Tony said, "What? Wait,
" JARVIS cut in, "
Upon reaching the door of the cottage, which appeared to open on its own volition, they were greeted with the humble homestead of the woman perhaps more feared than anyone in the kingdom. The High Chancellor had taken pity upon her, she herself having been orphaned at a young age, and through dealings with the King, he had allowed for her a small tract of land just beyond the village where she could practice her craft in peace.
than anybody I ever met.”
After their bath, Tony took Steve into the bedroom. He laid him down on the bed and kissed and caressed every inch of his body until Steve was a melty puddle who could barely find enough strength within himself to turn on his side and lay his head on Tony’s stomach.
“The waitress came over, and he turned his head to talk to her, and I saw that it was you. You smiled at her and said something that made her laugh, and when she walked away, you got your phone out and started scrolling through it like everything was okay.” He huffed out a quiet laugh. “I must have stood out there for fifteen minutes, watching you. Wondering how you did it.”
Nat reached into the top of her dress, smiling a little when Steve looked pointedly away. She pulled a twenty from her cleavage, finished off her drink at a swallow, and left the money underneath the glass.
“They do if they’re tired,” she said.  “If they don’t want to run anymore.  If they want to just get it over and done with once and for all so they can...settle down somewhere.  When they get out.  Maybe put some roots down.”
“Where’s Dodger?” she asked, and Tony bit his lip, trying to hide his smile, eyes on Steve.
singled you out.”
Steve leaned down to press a kiss against Tony’s collarbone. “Okay, Tony. That’s okay.”
Steve put it back on the table, tucked the other two away in his box, and carried it back to the doorway. When he got there he kissed Pietro one more time. “I don’t want to forget you either.”
in here.
hands traveling over his skin. That mouth closing over his nipple. Those eyes staring up at him, filled with dark lust and sweet, gentle love all mixed up in a divine cocktail of desire.
Steve kissed his shoulder. “Me too,” he said, and was a little scared to discover that he was close to tears. He blinked furiously, trying to clear them. “I miss you.”
Tony nodded. “Okay.”
He went out for a cigarette right after they took her away, and half an hour later, his leg was bouncing, his hands shaking, his need for another hit of sweet, soothing nicotine almost insurmountable. And he hated that. He had been doing a lot better lately. He had been down to eight a day. He thought he might hit that by the time the surgery was over.
Steve pressed the cut-off button and stuck the phone in his pocket just as Tony climbed over the railing. Even though he had just climbed up eight flights of ladder, he was not out of breath at all. He just ran a hand through his hair, and smiled that little smile Steve had spent the whole day thinking of.
“Tony, can you please just try and understand? I’m sorry. I really am. But, what am I supposed to do? Carlos broke his wrist. Do you want me to tell him he has to try and bus tables with a broken wrist just so we can go out to dinner? I can’t do that.”
For Tony, time had ceased to exist.  Everyone and everything around them had disappeared.  With every word Steve spoke, a little more color had drained from their surroundings and leeched over into the protective bubble he built to keep them separate from everything else.  By the time he finished speaking, the world outside was nothing but a swirl of gray, while inside their bubble, every color, every sound, every sensation was heightened a thousandfold.  The rumble of Steve’s voice, the red of his lips, even the feeling of Tony’s own clothing against his skin was nearly more than he could bear.
definitely missed you the most.”
“I’m okay,” she answered. “Just tired."
He pushed all that aside, and tapped his finger on the creases on her brow until she giggled and they smoothed out. “What’s up, peanut?” he said.
“I’ve been in a long time, Buck,” he said and ran a hand through his hair. “You know? A long time. I...I just think it’s time I got out. That’s all.”
“Why would I be pissed?”
“Of course, Dr. Banner.”
“But I love it, too.”
Steve shrugged. “You never know until you try, Mr. Stark,” he said. “Good-bye.”
“Oh,” Steve murmured, his happiness dimming a little. “July. Right.”
However, neither Morgan nor the dog had those issues. She grabbed Tony’s hand and tugged on it. “Daddy,” she said again. “I want to pet the dog. Can I pet the dog?”
"No, I really think you should sit up front."
Steve nodded. “Yeah. That’s true, I guess.”
“So, you have read it, then?” Ross asked.
He knew what the final one was, though.  The one that broke it.  Oh yes, he knew that one.
“You were perfect,” Tony said, turning back with that smile.  “Perfect.”
“What do you mean?”
Tony blinked in surprise.  He moved his thumb over Steve’s thigh, soothing him.  “Baby,” he said calmly, “it’s okay.  We’ve got this figured out.  She can do it.  She can take care of you.  And then you can come home.”
“Hey, baby,” he said, and his voice was gentle and comforting.
“There wasn’t really one moment.  He’s saved my ass a hundred times.  I’ve saved his.  We’ve been together for so long.  I’ve just always known.”
you to.”
And that had been it. But now, as Steve led him inside by the hand, Tony wondered why the hell he hadn’t come down here and checked it out for himself.
weren’t going to do that.  I never said I wouldn’t.”
Steve laughed.  “At least do it quieter, then, ‘kay?  I don’t want to wake the neighbors.”
“Yeah,” Steve sighed. “Me too.” He pressed his mouth against Tony’s shoulder again, and kept it there without moving, just holding him, then, after a while, “Do you ever...think about that?” he asked in a halting way. “What it would have been like? If...we’d...made it work?”
The butterflies’ wings beat faster: SteveSteveSteveSteve.
“You didn’t ask.”
“Yes.”
But everybody
“You’re here now.  That’s what matters.”
“Like in the park?”
“Steve--”
“Fuck you, Rogers,” he said, and Steve laughed again.
Perfect gentleman.
“I know you can,
Was he feeling nothing? Tony wondered.  Had that night in the hospital
Her eyes drifted shut, then popped back open. “Go home and sleep,” she said, lifting a finger to point at him. “I’m serious.”
“I’ve been knocking for ten minutes.”
“Enjoying the party, kids?” Tony asked, and before either could even think of answering, he went on. “I only ask because you seemed very intent on ruining it before I decided to step in. Miss Potts is a patient woman, but she puts a lot of work into these things and would be annoyed if it was, you know, avenged, for lack of a better word.” He snapped his fingers. “Wait, just thought of one. Fucked up. Yeah, that’s more appropriate. Fucked up.”
“No.  Just a basic assessment.”
“Fuck no. I’d love it.”
Steve shook his head.  “I’ll come back later.”
in me. Right now, okay, Tony? I want you to fuck me all night long. I want you to fuck me blind.”
Of course, that wasn’t what happened.
Tony pushed himself harder against Steve’s firm shoulder. “I know you are, baby. I'm sorry too. It’s okay.”
“What are you doing here?”
Steve didn’t hear anyone coming as he sat on the bench reading his book. Well...maybe not reading. Looking at. He was trying to read, but it wasn’t working. His mind kept wandering away from the words on the page, the letters swimming before his eyes, black letters swirling in a sea of white, changing to spell out a name over and over.
Steve felt a soft, warm weight on his hand, then the clasp of Tony’s fingers on his. He didn’t look down, though. He was afraid if he did, Tony might move his hand, and he didn’t want him to move it. It felt too nice. He
Tony nodded, kissed him again, then sat on the stool with Sir Purr in his arms.  “Yeah.  I’m good.  I’m all kinds of good.”
p.s. I know fuck-all about physics. Thank Google for the science-y words. If you do know something about physics, please forgive me.
problem,” Sam shot back. Steve looked up from his book and met Sam’s eye, and then they were both laughing. That was the way it was between them. The way it had always been between them, and Steve loved that.
“Baby,” Tony said softly. “You didn’t have to come over tonight. We could have postponed until you felt better.”
“He loves me,” Steve said solidly. “And I love him.”
“Where’s Steve?” she asked, frowning a little.
on his bed, when he had very clearly stated that no dogs should be on the bed just made the dream theory that much more plausible.
Steve frowned. “But…?”
He was standing in the control room.  Back at the Tower.  Malibu was a bust.  A big, sodden, drunken bust.  It was better here.  For real, this time.  There was an energy in New York that just made him feel more alive.  It wasn’t as good as the cabin--as
“Bruce?”
“No, I’m not,” Clint said. “He likes you.” He nudged Tony with his shoulder. “If you asked him out, he’d say yes. Guaranteed.”
He nodded toward the door. “You’d better go.”
Hands shot in the air. Clint. Nat. Bruce. Thor, who didn’t seem to know what he was voting for, but looked happy to join in. Sam. Pepper. Hill.
“It’s alright, Steve.”
More tears fell, and Steve scrubbed them away with the back of his hand. “We are? I mean, yeah. Yeah. We are.”
Tony was drowsy now, that elusive nymph, sleep, upon him again.  Such a fickle thing, appearing and departing only at her whim.
“What class?” Tony asked, standing next to them, the three of them forming a tight little knot.
“Maybe nothing.  I don’t know.  He said something when I went to visit and I thought it was weird.”
Steve swallowed and tightened his grip on her hand.  “Are you bringing him in or joining him?”
JULY, SUNDAY 6:20 PM
Tony sat forward in his seat, hands clasped loosely between his knees.  “So, what now?”
Steve reached back with his other hand, groping in the air, and Tony took it.  Steve squeezed it hard twice, and Tony didn’t have to be a rogue to figure out what it meant.
At 1:05, Tony started to pace.  At 1:08, his thumbnail a bloody ruin, he started to get his phone out of his pocket, ready to call Fury, call Ross, call
“Are you okay?” Steve asked, and Tony had no fucking
Steve and Nat nighttime chats and cuddles.
Tony turned his head enough to brush his lips against Steve’s arm. The skin beneath his lips was smooth like silk. Soft like silk. “I was just thinking,” he sighed.
“Yeah.”
The officer shrugged a little. “They usually start out with ‘Hi, honey,’ and then they go from there.”
“Are you sure?”
Steve laughed, and put his arms around Tony’s waist and held him tightly. He closed his eyes and just held him, breathing him in. He hummed a little as Tony slipped his hands through his hair, still brushing his lips along his neck.
“You talk then,” Steve urged.  “Tell me what we’ll do when I get out of here.”
Sam surprised him again by laughing a little. “Well, at least you can admit it. Steve never does. Never
Steve closed his eyes and slept.
“You’re the only ones who count.”
Tony narrowed his eyes as Steve brushed the color over his nail. “Are you trying to distract me?” he asked. “Get out of saying you’ll come to the party?”
Tony leaned into him and kissed his mouth. “Quiet, you,” he said softly. “Let me finish.”
“He started screaming,” Steve said hollowly. “I don’t know why. He was talking normal at first. I heard him. I heard him say something about bananas, and then his dad said something--I don’t know what. I couldn’t hear--and then he was just...just
“You acted like you were afraid it wouldn’t.”

“There’s a hole in your shirt,” he said.
“I’ll look forward to it.”
“I don’t know. It’s been a long time.”
The pizza place didn’t want to deliver.  Too far away, the guy said.  It would cost more in gas than it was worth, the guy said.  Oh, and the pie would get cold.  He said that as an afterthought, but it came out sounding like an apology.
part of him--was glad he had.
“Now you’re gonna get it, old man,” Tony said, and vaulted over the railing.
Tony nodded again, and Steve carried Morgan down to her bedroom. He sent her to the bathroom to change and brush her teeth, turning down her bed while he waited, and when she came back out, he lifted her up and tucked her in.
“What’s been the best one?”
Steve shook his head.  “I’m okay.”
still my best guy.”
he thought, as he finally turned the shower off.
“Really,” he said, pitching his voice low, and smiling. He hoped it was reassuring. It didn’t feel like it. It felt like a Halloween mask covering his face, but he hoped it looked better than it felt. “I’m okay. I’ve just got to study. And then I’ve got work this weekend. I’m fine. I just really do have a lot on my mind.”
He didn’t know how he did it. Considering the trouble he’d had getting into the bathtub, Tony was almost shocked to discover that he was suddenly on his knees. Suddenly able to pull Steve into an awkward, uncomfortable, but undeniably
Tony squeezed his shoulder again. “You got
Steve tightened his grip on Tony.  “I know.”
“But how did they know to do it?  I researched Baxter, Steve.  Dr. Wilkes recommended him.”
Peggy Carter it turned out, was
“I mean, I thought I was bi.” Steve started to shuffle backwards, Sharon took the hint and climbed off him, sitting on the edge of the bed as Steve sat up and drew his knees into his chest. “I thought I was, but I…”
“I don’t find you attractive.” Sharon’s hand froze mid-air, suddenly she felt cold, like she was hyper aware of the fact she was half naked in front of who she assumed was now her ex-boyfriend. She reached down and grabbed her top, quickly pulling it on. “Oh god I’m sorry, I…I didn’t mean it like that, god you’re beautiful, you have to know that. I just… I never had a problem with him… Not that I’ve had sex with a guy, it was just texts… Oh god I shouldn’t be telling you this, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry.”
“No! I…I wouldn’t, I wouldn’t do that to you. He wouldn’t do that to you. It was weeks before we went on a date. I never meant to hurt you though, I would never purposely hurt you.” Sharon frowned slightly.
“Steve Rogers!” Sharon growled out. “If you don’t stop apologising for being gay, I will hit you with something. I’m not saying this doesn’t hurt, there was a small part of me that thought that this would be it, that you were ‘the one’. But I don’t hate you or anything, I don’t begrudge you learning to be comfortable with who you are. I’m probably not the best person to be talking to about this, and once I walk out that door I probably won’t want to see you for a couple days, but I love you and I don’t think you have anyone else to talk to at the moment so I refuse to leave you alone.” Sharon reached out again and put her hand on Steve’s. Steve let out a small sob. “I just, you mentioned a guy, you weren’t, you know… when we were together…?”
“She’s going to get hurt either way! I’m just trying to minimise the damage.” Tony sank down into a chair, resting his elbows on the table as he rubbed his hands over his face.
“Oh.” Peggy reached out, resting her hand on the tabletop to brace herself. “This conversation needs considerably more gin.”
“It seems that way, but unless things have changed a lot since I was in high school, I don’t remember art and sport really mixing. Though I guess you’re probably an exception.” Tony dragged his eyes up and down Steve’s chest with a smirk, then jolted when Peggy kicked him again. At this rate he was going to need a new shin. Peggy probably had a point about him flirting with Steve though, as entertaining (and adorable) as it was to watch the tips of his ears turn pink and the slight flush in his cheeks, Sharon didn’t look too happy and the last thing Tony wanted was to upset her.
“I am not a child, so stop being so patronising. I’ll text you when I get home if that makes you happy but I can’t be around you any more, because right now you’re just 6 months I spent in a lie and if you ever want there to be a chance that we can be friends or even civil you need to leave me alone.” The door slammed behind her and Steve sank to the floor.
. 3d printing in general, I know it’s flawed but it’s an engineering device and it creates functional and aesthetic devices.”
Sharon bit her lip as she dragged her eyes over Steve’s body, she’d known he was fit, but knowing it and seeing him spread out on a bed like a pin up model were very different things. She pulled slightly at the edges of her top before looking Steve in the eye and pulling it up and over her head, the top covered her eyes, but she still heard the sharp intake of breath Steve made as her chest was uncovered. She let the top drop to the floor and climbed onto the bed, straddling Steve’s hips, she put her hands on his stomach pushing them up towards his shoulders, feeling every inch of muscle and following the path with her eyes. She finally looked up to meet Steve’s eyes, his pupils were blown, he looked wild, he looked
“You don’t have to worry though, I can’t leak the photos, I mean I wouldn’t but also I can’t cos I already deleted them. I didn’t want anyone finding them by accident…” Tony paused reaching for the door handle and nodded, before opening the door to reveal Sharon on the other side. Steve turned sheet white, his hands visibly shaking at having gotten caught. Tony placed his hand on the small of Steve’s back and pushed him forwards and out of the room.
“I knew Steve before she brought him home. Well I knew
“Option 4: Depression, don’t do anything, mope around on my floor doing absolutely nothing until you fail out of college and get dumped.
“Well you never were one to wait for others to do something you could do yourself” Peggy teased.

Sharon closed the door to Peggy’s house and let out a small sob as she slid to the ground. She’d managed to keep it together for the whole walk home, but now she couldn’t hold back any longer and broke down. She vaguely heard someone call her name and felt arms wrap around her. Part of her registered that it was her Aunt and she managed to whimper out “Steve. Tony”.
“Is that what the kids are calling it these days?” Steve sat up from where he was lying on the floor and threw his pillow at Sam’s head. “Okay, okay, remembering I’m not even slightly qualified and we do have *actual* therapists on campus, this is how I see it:
“Guessing you’re not a huge fan of the arts?” Steve teased him, “It’s not all just painting though. We have to document the process, make sketches, photographs, and then there’s things like art history, colour theory, digital manipulation as well as other modules like psych and physics.”
Steve pulled away from Sharon in embarrassment, it would have been bad enough being caught by Peggy, but it being Tony added that extra hint of uncomfortableness. Sharon turned around, placing her hands on her hips to glare at her Uncle. “Do you have to insist on making Steve uncomfortable every time you see him?”
“I’m not! I, um, I’m, um, fuck I’ve never said this out loud before” A mildly hysterical laugh slipped out. “I’m bi, bisexual I mean, I like Sharon, like a lot.” The arm ‘pinning’ him in place relaxed a little, Steve could have easily walked out of the hold, but he figured Tony deserved this interrogation. Besides it felt, kinda nice?
Tony snorted and raised his hands “Okay, okay, I get it, there’s beauty in the world”
Sam snorted as Steve sat on his floor and explained it to him, “maybe don’t tell your girlfriend that
This chapter was 100% not planned, but it felt a bit rushed going from last chapter straight to the next one. Plus who doesn't want more Sam? Sam's only flaw is that Steve doesn't listen to him.
Steve’s head shot up. “Did you have to bring him up now? It’s not because of him. I just, what if I do it wrong? What if I’m really bad and she dumps me?”
Sharon deflated slightly “And he didn’t think it would be nice to say that to my face?”
. “It’s okay. Well no it’s not okay, you have frankly the worst timing ever, but it’s okay that you’re gay.”
“How does an art major even get busy? Just slap some paint on a canvas and say it represents your childhood.” Tony snarked when Steve apologised for not having come around sooner. Peggy and Sharon both glared at him across the table and Peggy kicked him swiftly in the shin, Steve just laughed. Tony’s heart skipped a beat, from the shock of Steve laughing, not because it was the first time that Steve had smiled at
things you enjoy. Go for a walk, bake some cookies, ride your bike, see Sharon,
“Art isn’t a set of topics, it’s a way you see the world. It’s about finding something you’re interested in or think is important and showing it to the world so they can see what you see. Anything can be art, it’s not all Mona Lisa, Starry nights or The Persistence of Memory. You seem to be more inclined towards science so let’s use engineering as an example.” Tony’s eyes narrowed and Peggy and Sharon glanced at each other, this was not going to end well.
happened?) and held her hand out for him to take. Steve took a deep breath, plastered on his ‘sweet, Brooklyn boy’ smile, the one Buck had always said could help him get away with murder, and pushed the nerves all the way down into his shoes where they couldn’t get in the way. Then reached out and took her hand.
“Wait, have you not seen her naked yet?” The shy ducking of Steve’s head was all the answer Sam needed. “Why? There’s nothing wrong with that, but you’re in your twenties, been dating for months, neither of you is holding out for marriage… It’s unusual. I just want to make sure it’s not because of the whole Tony thing.”
“Now should we go through to the dining room?” Peggy didn’t wait for an answer and began herding the group into the dining room, whilst subtly pulling Tony toward the back of the group, where the young couple couldn’t see the dirty look she threw at him. She seated Steve and Sharon together and Tony opposite in Sharon in the hopes in would encourage him to be on better behaviour, then headed to the kitchen to fetch their dinner, ignoring both Sharon and Steve’s offers of help.
“I know it’s rude to get a phone out at the dinner table so sorry about this.” Steve smiled apologetically at Peggy. “So are you honestly saying there’s a functional reason for the edges being curved like this? For the colour schemes?”
Sharon deflated and scrubbed her hand over her face. Steve jumped off the bed and edged towards her. “It wasn’t a relationship, it was just a couple pictures, I didn’t want to ruin us by telling you.”
“Well you can have your boyfriend back now, with my blessing and everything.” Tony slammed the door behind them, leaving Steve to bluff his way out. After all stress builds character or something like that.
“Would you like to come back to mine for coffee?”
“Curved edges reduce injury and colour is product design
Uncle Tony and Sharon walked back towards the group; Steve felt like he was going to throw up. Tony smirked at Steve, the smile not quite covering the threats swimming in his eyes. Steve took another deep breath and held out a hand to shake “It’s a pleasure to meet you sir”.
Sharon could feel something in her ache. She’d know Steve for years, she’d heard him talk about never knowing his father, about his mother’s death, about learning his best friend had been murdered, but she’d never seen him look this
“I agree, maybe I should spend more time on Campus if this is what students look like.” All thoughts of being hugged by his childhood hero vanished when Steve heard the man’s voice from the stairs and looked up to see his face. Sharon beamed up at the man and ran towards him, diving into a hug.
Steve frowned at the list, none of them sounded particularly effective or appealing, though it did sound a bit familiar. “Wait! Aren’t those the 5 stages of grief?”
“Well yeah, but you have to have painted nude models before, right? And it’s not like you’re bad at art so you’re not going to accidentally insult her.”
Sam was about to start reading a handout on coping mechanisms when his phone pinged. “Avoidance didn’t work” He sighed and threw the handout back in his bag as he texted back “I’ll bring pizza” Steve probably needed it more than him.
“I… Um… Okay? I mean, I don’t understand why you’re bringing that up now.” Sharon let out a small awkward laugh. “I don’t have a problem with that, if that’s what you’re worried about?”
“Couldn’t you hear? I mean you were right by the door.”
“With his blessing?! We don’t need his blessing! Urgh, I’m sorry Steve I don’t know why he’s been such an asshole to you.” Sharon grabbed Steve’s hand leading him down the stairs, she seemed more upset by Tony’s comment to her than anything else, maybe she didn’t hear everything? “What were you two talking about in there anyway?”
.” Steve hissed out.
Clearly the universe hated him, because it wasn’t Sharon that opened the door. Steve faltered in his step forward to embrace her, when he realised it was actually Tony stood in front of him. Tony raised his eyebrows and snorted in amusement when he saw Steve almost stumble away from him, then turned around and walked away leaving the door open in what Steve assumed was an invitation to come in. He resisted the urge to rest his head into the door as he shut it, somehow it felt like this was going to be even more awkward than the last time he was here.
Sharon slapped him.
“What the hell was that?” Peggy turned to Tony as soon as Steve and Sharon had left to go on a walk. “You’ve been nothing but rude to and about Steve since Sharon brought him home. You switch between flirting with him
Sam snorted and raised his eyebrow. “Sure, unless you know you’ve been dating them for months. Besides it doesn’t have to be an entire gallery of just Sharon, throw in some stuff she likes too, maybe if you ask nicely you could paint Peggy too. Have generations as a theme? Or SHIELD? I mean everyone knows you love them.”
“Yeah that’s gonna work out so well for you.”
“Uncle Tony! Stop flirting with my boyfriend! You’re embarrassing him.” Sharon was clearly trying to keep the smile off her face whilst she admonished her uncle. However, the sight of a tomato red Steve staring awkwardly at his shoes made that a lot harder than it should have been, and she couldn’t help the small giggle that escaped causing Steve to half-heartedly glare at her.
tell me not to get involved.”
Sorry this took a while but life got... hard
“Option 3: Bargaining, bribe Tony into saying nothing and hope you have something he’s interested in (well something else that he’s interested in).
Tony snorted as he reciprocated the handshake, his fingers stroking almost imperceptibly across Steve’s “You don’t have to call me ‘Sir’, Tony will do, unless you’re into that.” A grin stretched across Tony’s face as he winked, causing a flush of red to spread across Steve’s face. “And now we know you’re pretty when you blush”. The red got worse.
“He wouldn’t hurt me? I know him?” Steve froze, realising his mistake. “I don’t know many people outside of College here, pretty much the only people I know outside of school are my Aunt and… Oh god, Tony? You
Also I know nothing about American colleges, or art degrees, so pretend that this is how they actually work
Steve flinched at that word. “Is it? Cos it doesn’t feel like it is, it took me
“So much make sense now. Why he kept flirting with you. How you ended up in Peggy’s office with him when you were going to the toilet.” Sharon ignored Steve’s protests. “Why he was so angry about us and then why he ran away! It was all because you’d had a relationship and were hiding it from me! God Steve! You lied to me, for months you’ve lied to me. I can’t believe you.”
“Ha ha. I can’t exactly use Sharon in my project. This is serious Sam! I’m going to fail this module and have to retake and then I’ll fail that because I have nothing! No plans, no inspiration, no anything, and 6 weeks isn’t enough to fix that and create the amount of work that I need to justify a gallery worth of art.” His words sped up as he talked, his breath coming faster until he was hyperventilating. Sam launched himself off his bed and crouched in front of Steve.
Steve frowned, it made sense, he could think of multiple directions he could take a project like that. Logically it made sense, Sharon wouldn’t mind, she’d teased him a couple of times about when she was going to be the focus of his art, and he had plenty of photos of her already so it wouldn’t take much of her time. He could have Sharon in Peggy’s old uniform next to an old photo of Peggy. He sighed. “It doesn’t feel right. I know that sounds really dumb, it’s a great idea, but it’s like part of my mind has already decided what I need to do and it’s just waiting for the rest to catch up.”
and the grin lit up his face.
“I was *really* happy when my little Sharon said she was bringing home a boyfriend, so imagine my surprise when it was you that walked through the door. Cos from my experience she’s not exactly your type. You better not be using her to protect your closeted ass.” Tony growled at him.
They moved further into the apartment, Steve occasionally turning them away from a table or wall, slowly directing them towards the bedroom without pulling away from each other. Sharon kept alternating between scraping her nails down his back and soothing the skin with her fingertips, sending sparks though Steve at the slight edge of pain. He pushed deeper into the kiss. Steve stumbled back into the edge of the bed, letting go of Sharon to fling his arms out and regain his balance. Sharon pulled back from the kiss and smirked, pulling away and laid her hands on his chest, spread her fingers out and pushed. Steve fell back onto the bed and propped himself up on his elbows, reaching up to brush his hair out of the way.
“Fiiine, fine if you want to be boring, so when did you two lovebirds meet?” Steve could feel Tony’s eyes boring into him, but he kept his eyes on Sharon as she took his hand and explained their meeting 2 years previously living across from each other in student halls. Steve felt himself twitching slightly as the glare directed at him grew heavier and heavier.
“Yeah, pride is a bit bruised though. Tony just wanted to make sure I was going to look after you, so probably a good thing he didn’t see that.” At this point Steve was 90% certain he’d spent more of the afternoon blushing and making a fool of himself than not. “I should probably leave before I embarrass myself even more. Please thank Peggy again for me.”
Steve didn’t normally have difficulty opening his door, but then again, he didn’t normally have Sharon wrapped around him, trailing kisses up neck whilst he did it. Eventually the door clicked open and they fell through it, Steve span around, his hands coming to rest on her hips. His fingers brushed at the base of Sharon’s top, dipping under to graze across her bare skin. Sharon backed away slightly, reaching back with her arm to push the door shut then grabbed Steve by the collar pulling him down until their lips crashed together. A whimper left Steve’s throat and he dove into the kiss, walking Sharon back until her back was pressed against the door.
“There are so many things wrong with that sentence. Sharon isn’t going to dump you for being inexperienced in bed because she’s not a terrible person. Are you a virgin then? I thought with the whole grindr thing that you had experience.”

“But we didn’t go on our first date until 3 weeks ago.” Steve squeezed Sharon’s hand in relief as Tony relaxed at that news and stopped glaring at him. “I got tired of waiting him to make a move so asked him out”
“Okay, that’s good, but this is all still a helluva coincidence. You match with me, get some dick pics and then less than a month later you’re ‘dating’ Sharon and managing to wrangle an invite here? If this is some attempt at blackmail, you better walk out that door right now and never talk to her again cos trust me the world has seen my dick often enough that you leaking some pictures doesn’t faze me, but my lawyers *will* crush you.” Steve flushed at the reminder of their previous ‘relationship’, but the rest just confused him.

at work and from how things went with Pepper.”
“Are you honestly saying this wasn’t traumatic.” Sam nodded in concession, though not quite the kind of trauma he meant. “And we never went on a date, we just…talked.”
Peggy sighed and pulled her niece closer; she’d naively hoped that with Tony out of the picture things would last. “I know sweetheart, I’m sorry”.
After concluding his business and washing his hands, thoroughly, Steve started making his way back to the stairs only to be pulled through a door into what he assumed was Tony’s study. Before he could get his bearings, Steve was slammed into a wall with Tony’s finger rammed in his face.
He was definitely going to need some free therapy after this.
“Well, now that that’s settled and you’ve both proven how smart you are, perhaps we can discuss a topic everyone can get involved in?” Peggy raised her eyebrow and she stared them both down. Steve flushed as he realised how Tony and he had completely monopolised the conversation for the past 10 minutes. He squeezed Sharon’s hand and squeaked out a sorry.

“I’ve painted nude models, but they’re not Sharon!”
, but nothing was interesting, nothing was jumping out and yelling at him to show the world.
“I didn’t know he was your uncle. I didn’t I swear.” Sharon pulled her hand away and stood up, pacing away from the bed before turning and glaring at Steve.
to be vaguely okay with being bi, before you, only 2 people knew, Sam and… someone else. And now I’m not. God the only way I could even consider being okay with interacting with a guy in that way was by setting the age range too high to pick up anyone I knew at college.” Steve laughed slightly hysterically, 5 minutes ago he was going to lose his virginity to his amazing girlfriend, and now he had broken her heart and was rubbing it in by talking about being on Grindr, what was wrong with him? “I’m sorry, I shouldn’t be talking to you about this. I’m sorry, I do love you I really do, just not the right way and I don’t”
And yet— And yet…
"Clean up nice, yeah?" Tony said and motioned over himself.
"I was
Thor frowned at the stairs a second, setting Mjölnir on the coffee table before he turned to Steve and said, "Forgive me. I did not know Anthony was still asleep."
” Tony said clearly. One word, but it was enough.
“It’s okay, Dodger,” Steve said, hoping he wasn’t lying. “Mom?” He put a tentative hand on her knee. “Mom? You okay?”
"Tony?" Nat said. "Shotgun."
“Okay.”
all did. Sometimes we got on each other’s nerves, but none of us cared much when we were getting ready to go to sleep.” He fell silent, the humor leaving his voice. “It got cold out there. Sometimes...” he said, then paused as if he was going to say something else but changed his mind. “Yeah. Sometimes it got really cold.”
He put his arm around her.  “You don’t hate me,” he soothed.  “How can you hate me?  I got you free bagels.”
Tony looked back at him, and Steve could see his mind was made up. He’d already decided. He’d already made his choice. Steve let go of his arms and let his hands fall to his sides.
“Yeah.  You said stuff in German and called me that.”
“You’re not old.”
between them, something basic and greedy and hot that always put both of them on edge when they were together.  Or when they were apart.  Sometimes all it took was the mere mention of Steve’s name to throw Tony off balance.  And then there had been the post- and sometimes pre-battle jerk-off sessions he indulged in so frequently.  How many times had he wished Steve was there with him, gripping him, stroking him, getting on his knees in front of him, or just throwing him down and pounding into him until they both came so hard they’d see stars?
“Where the fuck have you been?” Steve snapped.
“Trouble in paradise, huh?”
Tony waited for a moment. Waited for Howard to respond. But he didn’t.
“It doesn’t need to be broached.  She just goes in and does it.”
“I know the kind of stuff he says, Tony!” he flared. “But you can’t react. He feeds off that. I told you. I told you how he is, and still.”
It’s still we.  It always will be.”
Steve watched Tony cuddle the cat and sighed.  “Fine.  Dinner’s ready.”
“I will.  As soon as I can.”
He ran his hands over Steve’s arms, his back, then touched his cheek, wanting to slow this down a little, wanting to kiss him, wanting to draw it out and make it last.
“I don’t think it was that high in the first place.”
Tony sat in the middle of them all, holding court like a king. He was their center. The hub of all the activity around him. The funniest, the wildest, the most beautiful of the beautiful people, and Steve wasn’t the only person in the room who stared whenever he was around. He wasn’t the only person staring now. Glancing around the room, at least a dozen others were staring at Tony. Steve could see the same look that was currently on his own face on their faces too, so he felt safe staring a little. If Tony felt eyes on him, Steve had only a one in thirteen chance of Tony catching him, so yeah, he felt safe. After all, who was he now? Just some guy. Steve had been right. Tony hadn’t recognized him. Hadn’t remembered him. In spite of their close friendship before, now he was just some guy in a sea of people busy eating and talking and bitching about homework assignments and football games.
“Yeah.”
Just ignore everything I say, guys. I thought of a couple new scenes I wanted to write, so this will be longer than "Two more to go". Not much longer, but it will be longer. I'll give you the head's-up when we're on the last one, though, don't worry. It's weird posting as I write. My first series was halfway written before I even started posting at all, so I always knew what was up. Not so with this one. Oh well. "Whatever." ;)
Tony kissed him at the door that morning. For a long time. Even though it was eight-thirty, and Tony had to be at work at nine, he took the time to indulge in a very thorough good-bye kiss, complete with tongue and roaming hands.
So, why the hell was he nervous now?
When he got home, Tony got out of the car, put his most contrite face on, and went inside.  “Hi, baby,” he said, tossing his keys into the bowl by the door.
“You’d have to leave a trail of breadcrumbs.”
“I”m not determined.  I’m just prepared.  Most soldiers are.”
you got your toothbrush?” Tony asked, and Steve ducked his head into Morgan’s sweet-smelling hair, hiding his smile.
Tony went to the back door and looked out.  Steve was sitting on the deck, staring down at the lake.  Tony went outside.
Tony kissed his temple, touched him with gentle fingers, and Steve sighed with a contentment Tony didn’t know he still had in him. “You go to sleep,” he said. “I’ll wake you up in a couple hours.”
. This.” He walked closer, closing the distance Steve had put between them. “It’s not my fault I live here, Steve,” he said. “It’s not my fault my father likes to have this stuff. Don’t take it out on me.”
Tony nodded, but he stayed where he was, let out a breath and ran his hand through his hair.
“It’s okay, Bruce,” she said, but her eyes were on Tony now.  Questioning, defiant, ready to either comfort or fight, whichever he chose.  She would either rise to the occasion or lower herself to it, her eyes said so.
“How do I look, Daddy?” she asked, and he cocked a critical eyebrow and moved his index finger in a tight twirling motion. She spun around, making the skirt of her dress bell out around her knees, and his heart did a strenuous tumble inside his chest, nearly bowling him over with his love for her.
“Rogers!”
kid, and Tony thought that was pretty much the same thing anyway. That was his own personal approach to parenting too. Of course, he was lucky enough to have the best kid in the universe, so it worked out perfectly for him.
Tony squeezed his eyes shut, then opened them again.  He lifted his hands up and looked at them.  He
Steve shifted, pressing against Tony’s side, and Tony's hand on his thigh squeezed, not-so-subtly, as Steve’s breath caressed his skin.
say Mrs. Perkins was home…”
Sam shrugged. “I don’t know. They make it sound pretty good. Full college tuition paid. On-the-job training. Salary. ‘See the world, kid’. You know. It might not be so bad.”
“I always was, Tony.”
“Here are the terms of your imprisonment,
“‘S’okay,” he mumbled, finding his voice at last. His eyes stayed closed, though. He didn’t quite have the strength to open them yet, but his hand had found an easy rhythm, petting Tony’s back.
“Okay.  I love you.”
“I wanna go back to New York.”
“Yes, boss?”
“I know so.”
Steve ducked his head until he could press his lips against Tony’s wrist. “Yeah, you did,” he agreed.
She led them in, and Morgan jumped up from where she’d been kneeling to pet Dodger. “Daddy!” she said, then ran to them and threw herself at Tony.
And Howard told him exactly what he’d heard.
Tony shifted into second, then third.  He glanced at Steve, the way he was curled into himself, and smiled a little.  That wasn’t defeat in Steve’s posture.  Had not been defeat in his words.  He was playing along.  Still thinking he had the upper hand while giving the impression of surrender.  The fact that they both knew what was going on was part of the game too.  That’s what made it work.  That’s what made it fun.
“Honey, Nick’s right--”
“No,” Steve said faintly.
“It’s just been a long day, and I’m glad you’re here,” Tony said.  “I’m glad
“I joined for the wrong reason,” he said, squeezing Bucky’s hand. “Maybe quitting for the wrong reason is the right thing.”
“I didn’t say that.”
“Rogers.”  Fury.
Fury had called him in to brief some agents on an upcoming mission, and he wasn’t home yet. He’d texted to say they should start the movie without him. Tony told him he didn’t want him to miss the start of the movie.
.  I thought he’d just forgotten.”
“Yeah?”
“That’s different, Tony, you’re
“You’re not mad at me?  I promise I won’t do it again.”
Steve took a step closer, almost as if he couldn’t help it. Like he was being drawn in. “It was...better last night,” he said quietly, then touched Tony’s other hand with his own, timid in a way Tony never knew an ex-soldier could be. “You know?” Steve said. “Here? With...” He smiled through downcast lashes, and those fireworks went off again. Like D.C. on July 4th.
Tony laughed.  “What can I say?  I’m a cuddly drunk.”
“It’s here,” Nat said, stopping by a metal door.  There was a small window set into it, wire embedded in the glass.  She looked in.
Steve laughed softly.  “Shut up, Tony.”
“Alright.”
Sam and Nat brought out the cake around nine. It was covered with candles. Tony had told them to do that. Sam had wanted to just put one on there, but Tony had insisted they put on as many as would fit. They only had enough room for 70, but Steve laughed and blushed when he saw it. Tony knew he would. He laughed more when Sam and Natasha raced each other with lighters trying to get them all lit before the others burned out.
“Steve-”
“I don’t know.  You got me worked up and I just grabbed.  I think it’s Bruce’s.”
“I guess that’s true,” Tony agreed.  “But that seems strange now, too.”
And that was all.
“Me too,” Steve said quietly. “I’ve been thinking about you all day. Missing you.”
“You weren’t supposed to know about this.”
She was standing by the front door. He felt bad, felt like he’d abandoned her for a moment, but he’d make it up to her. He’d apologize later, but for now, he got to do this. Got to give her this.
“Dodger-” Steve heard, and then Sarah was on her knees beside him, throwing her arms around his neck, and crying into his shoulder.
Steve stood up and bumped his shoulder against Tony’s.  “Of course you will.  Nothing keeps Tony Stark down.”
“No, but we’ve both had several birthdays since then. Are you telling me you and that Petrol guy didn’t have birthday-sex?”
Undeniable relief.  Undeniable happiness.  “Yes, boss.  I agree completely.”
“Is he...How is he?”
Bucky glanced over his shoulder at Tony and Josh. “Don’t let that get to you. And whenever you’re ready to leave, we’re gone.”
“Are you sure you’re okay?”
.” He cocked an eyebrow. “‘Cause I don’t want to be the one to catch hell if they find out I let you get on a bus and fall asleep and end up in New Hampshire, or something.”
and a string of emojis Tony couldn’t have explained if he’d tried.  They all seemed to know Steve was with him, though.  He didn’t know if that was poor secret-keeping on Natasha’s part, which seemed unlikely, or just good guess-work on everyone else’s.
deserve it.  I loved you.”
, in Tony’s arms on that grassy little hill in Central Park, and now here he was, using a leg that had been so much useless meat, to help boost him into bed.  He was wearing that Yankees t-shirt.  His face was smooth and clean.  His nails short and healthy pink inside their beds.  Tony wanted to wrap him in his arms and never let him go.  He wanted to sit on a beach with him somewhere and drink Mai-Tais while the sun went down over the water.  He wanted to watch him tie his shoes, and hear his voice over the phone, and yell at him for not wearing his helmet when he rode his motorcycle.  But mostly he wanted this--to lie beside him in bed with the darkness kept at bay by a pane of glass and a cozy bedside lamp.
Steve laughed, the sound a little forced in the night air.  “
“If you speak up again, Miss Romanov, you will be asked to leave,” he said.
They’d never done that before. He was hoping tonight might be the night they remedied that situation. That would be the icing on the cake to a really nice day. Lying on his bed, phone to his ear, eyes closed while Steve told him what he wanted to do to him. Steve was shy and sweet, but he was also an animal in bed. He was the perfect combination. The perfect man. Tony’s perfect man.
Tony shook his head.  “Rhodey would never--”
“Sure.  Just toddle on over to the garage.  I’ll be there in two shakes.”
“I missed you, too.”
Then Tony was asleep. Steve set his alarm, then drifted off too. There were no nightmares. No real fear of them either. He hadn’t had a nightmare in weeks. Not since the night before the party. Not since Tony had told him he loved him. He knew they would still happen--he wasn’t naive enough to believe they’d never happen again--but he hoped they would be fewer now. Fewer and farther between. He thought they might be. With Tony here, he thought they might be.
“Yes, boss.”
OCTOBER, SUNDAY 2:00 PM
“What do
He pinched the bridge of his nose.  “My head hurts,” he muttered.
being selfish. Thad had been right when he'd said it last night. If Thad thought it, Tony probably did too. It was okay. Only a matter of time, really. Thad wasn’t the first person to point it out. Steve’s mother had, too. Right after his father died. Right before
“That’s okay, Tony,” Steve mumbled, already more than half asleep. “Just set the alarm for me.”
Steve looked at him, feeling almost affronted.  “You have season tickets to the Yankees--behind the
“Sorry about that.”  He tapped the reactor.  “It’s this.  They were worried about it, I guess.  I mean, it’s not like everyone and their goddamn dog doesn’t know I have it, and I
--but they wouldn’t last.  And the making up would be better.  There was that to look forward to.
, he thought.
Steve lay back, and Tony eased himself down beside him, curled up next to him. He kissed him, then lay his head right next to Steve’s on the pillow. They were both sweaty, sticky, a mess, but Tony was too exhausted, too content to just lie here with him for a little while to care. He ran his hand through Steve’s hair in a gentle, possessive way. Steve closed his eyes and hummed out a breath. The corners of his mouth ticked upward in a tiny, satisfied smile.
No one noticed the small group of people on the hill in Central Park.  There was no reason why they would.  They were away from the crowd, and there was only three of them.  No one noticed the way one lay on the ground or the way the other two knelt above him, whispering urgently.  No one noticed that one of them was dying.
She laughed again, and patted Dodger who had finally settled himself pressed against Steve with his head on his thigh, looking adoringly up at him. “We were down there for about an hour, and then I took Dodger out. When I came back, Tony was curled up in your bed, sound asleep.” She squeezed Steve again. “I just let him rest.”
Relief flowed through him.  “FRIDAY?”
of Steve’s bag being dropped on the floor.
Steve slipped out of his hands and backed toward the door. “I’m pretty sure you will,” he said smoothly.
Tony, who didn’t know his thought process, huffed in his ear. “That’s funny? You’re taking pleasure in my pain, Rogers? Cruel.”
Tony eyed him skeptically.  “Do you really deserve kisses?”
That made it through too. His self-preservation was starting to kick in. The part of him that made sure he ate something other than gummy bears and blueberries. The part that made sure when he finally collapsed from exhaustion, it was usually onto his bed, or at least the sofa down in the lab instead of just onto the floor near his work-station. That part of him was finally bustling into his brain, eyeing up the situation, figuring out the best way to get his body back on track.
Scared.
They were still huddled together when the alarm went off at six. Tony groaned and rolled onto his stomach away from the sound, and Steve shut it hurriedly off. He could usually catch it before it went off and woke Tony up, but he had been too comfortable. Too warm and snuggly this morning.
Tony cleared his throat. “Yeah,” he muttered, “uh, how ‘bout we keep that between you and me, ‘kay?”
Steve started toward them then, moving easily, hair glinting in the sun, skin smooth and pale. Tony sucked in a breath, and Clint squeezed his shoulder again. “Ask him,” he said, and then he walked away, leaving Tony standing there, waiting. As he passed Steve, Clint said, “All yours, hot stuff,” and casually smacked Steve’s ass. Steve jumped a little, shaking his head and laughing under his breath. His cheeks pinked alarmingly fast.
“You’re right.”
“She’s jealous of him,” Strange said.  “But that’s not why she stayed away.”
“What the hell?” he said.
But he was on the phone with Billy from town who was going over the roster for the adult basketball team they had been thinking about.  Billy was of the mind high school students would be perfectly fine to have on the team as long as they were at least seventeen.  Jack, Billy’s brother-in-law, and a member of the
“About my...
That look was answer enough.
“You’re not really planning on sleeping out there, are you?”
“Tony.”
He saw his hand lift up, saw it moving toward Steve’s shoulder.  He was wearing a white t-shirt.  Tony loved it when he wore white t-shirts.  Or black t-shirts.  Or blue button-downs.  Or gray sweaters.  Or-SteveSteveSteveSteve.
Until they did.
“Well, let’s just-” he began, and then moved to hug him. At the same time, Steve put his hand out to shake. They both stopped, laughed a little, then Steve went for a hug the exact same time Tony tried to shake hands.
“How are we, FRI?” he asked.
“Rogers, sir.”
We're nearing the end here, but not quite yet. I know i keep saying this, but I'm not 100% sure where we're going, so we'll be surprised together. I am sorry to say I don't think we've seen the last of everyone's favorite just yet...dun dun DUUN! But he won't be around for long. I promise!
Tony scrubbed a hand over his face.  He’d been through all this in his mind a thousand times, and he always got hung up here, too.  But, he had to push through.  Play through the pain.  Just do it.  And all the other sporty metaphors that basically boiled down to “Stop caring so much and get the job done”.  That’s what he was trying to do.  Stop caring.  Get the job done.
To Tony’s great relief, Steve began moving against him again.  Just a little, just tiny, gentle thrusts, but the feeling was all the more delectable for its delicacy.
“You don’t think that hurt?  Watching that?  Hearing from Stephen fucking Strange that you tried it again?”  He clenched his fist on his knee.  “How many times
Tony lay in his bed for a while. He didn’t sleep. He couldn’t. He wrapped himself up in Steve’s blankets--
“Buck,” Steve warned, but Nat was nodding a little.

“I don’t have to be,” Steve said.  “I just am.”

Steve ran water in the sink and dumped the dishes in.  “Besides,” he said, raising his voice so Tony could hear him, “there’s always somebody hanging around the Tower.  Either that, or we all go out together.  Not much chance for alone-time.”
“You’re sure? I won’t sleep tonight unless I know for sure.”
Tony thought of his elegant, graceful mother.
“You shouldn’t be here.”
happen while he’s gone...at least you won’t still be mad at each other.”
“Thanks, Sir Purr,” Tony said, and opened the door.  “Steve?”
Tony let out a breath.  He was still scared, but even those five little words shut the panic-rat back up in its cage.  However, now the pissed-off monkey that sometimes rattled
Afterward, Steve laid by Tony's side for a while. Just holding him. Just kissing him. Just being quiet together, letting their hands and minds wander. After a bit, Steve kissed Tony once more, then went and got into the shower. Tony lazed in the bed after he was gone, replaying the evening in his head, thinking how perfect it was, how sweet and warm. Steve had
“Hey,” Steve said, and Tony looked up, his hand hovering over the screen.  “Make sure you do it anonymously.”
“Yes.”
“You think I was going to trust you with my booze?  I don’t think so.”
"That's what a fundraiser
“No,” he said. “It’s okay. It’s more than okay. I just...didn’t think she’d do it.”
more qualified to judge coolness. But,” she gave his arm a playful swat, and he smiled brightly, “it’s really just one guy. One guy...and his kid.”
Tony pulled reluctantly back at the sound of his voice.  “What is it?” he asked.  “Too much?”  Tony was in utter awe of his own ability to keep his voice gentle when his body was in such a state of rampant turmoil.  His own heart thundered in his chest; his hands shook.  His cock was hot and heavy, straining against his pants.  His skin sizzled, especially where Steve’s fingers touched, restlessly moving, leaving him in flames.
“What did you say?” Tony asked, and Steve leaned back against his chest, letting Tony take some of his weight. Giving that to him too. Giving him everything he wanted. Everything he would take.
“Hurry up, Rogers,” he said, stretching up to say it into his ear. “I need you.”
Steve curled his fingers into Tony’s belt loops. “Tony,” he said haltingly. “Tony, are we gonna…?”
Last night had been the worst. Tony had barely slept. He’d twisted and turned, rumpling the sheets, alternating between throwing the blankets off and burrowing underneath them every thirty minutes. He just couldn’t get comfortable. He couldn’t turn his mind off. It felt like something was wrong, something that he couldn’t fix. He wanted to call Steve, but by that time, it was three AM, and Tony didn’t want to wake him up, so he powered through, and finally dropped off around four. He’d never been happier to hear that seven o'clock alarm.
Next chapter on Tuesday or Wednesday.  I'm almost finished writing.  I'll probably have it done by Friday. Hopefully fully edited and posted by Saturday. We'll see.
, isn’t he?” Tony said in a teasing voice, trying like hell to get a smile back onto those lips.
“How did you two even--” he stopped, a sick look on his face.  “Please don’t tell me the Gala.”
Nat touched his wrist.  “You should.  You’ve been a hermit the last couple months.  You need to see people.”
“There’s still chicken from last night,” Steve said, and Tony closed his eyes.  “Or would you rather do something else?”
Tony shot him a withering look.  “Wow.  Really, Bruce?  You and Rhodey have been spending
days.”
“What?”
He shook his head again. “No, Tony,” he said. “I don’t want you to.”
Steve shook his head. “Older,” he said. “And I’m not sure if your godfather would like it if-”
And Christ, the voice was the same. The same half-amused/half-sulky tone that he’d used the last time Steve had heard him say those words. That day seemed like it was a long time ago. And like it was just yesterday.
“Why?”
Tony knew he was just waiting for a reason to do it. He hadn’t wanted Tony in public school, at all. Maria had set it up last time before she died, and this time, Tony, himself, had insisted. He didn’t want to go to private school. He
Steve laughed, putting his face into the crook of Tony’s neck. “Quiet,” he said. “I don’t want my mom to know I like it freaky.”

There were eyes on him.  He could feel them. He looked up and met Pepper's steady gaze.  She didn't hate him. Steve didn't think she was quite capable of hatred--she was too good for that--but she would never like him.  Steve understood. He really did. Thought, in fact, she was hugely generous for the civility she was able to muster whenever they were in the same room together.  He was, after all, the "other man". He always had been. The shadow in the corner. That dark presence that had always loomed over the relationship she and Tony had.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony answered.  “They’re gone, and no harm done.”
“Oh my god,” Tony breathed.
If he stretched, Tony could just reach Steve’s foot with his own.  He nudged him with his toe.  “Goodnight, Steve.”
Tony leaned into Steve’s chest, knocking his head a couple of times against the hard muscle.  “And here I thought I was the dad.”
“I know that,” Tony said, and Steve could still hear the smile in his voice. He was glad. So very glad. “But we can just sleep,” Tony went on. “If that’s all you want to do, that’s fine with me, baby. Just don’t leave me, okay? Don’t leave me alone?”
to home, but not home, and the departure time at the airport. The ticket price was astronomical, but he didn’t care. He had plenty of money now. At least for his needs. He had set up an allotment for his mother when he first joined the army, but didn’t actually use much of his own paycheck beyond the basics.
Tony blinked and shook his shoulders a bit, visibly trying to get himself under some kind of control. He could hear/feel his heart pounding in his ears. Was that the sign of a heart attack? He thought it might be. It was the sign of
“Steve…” Tony trailed off.
“If it’s not...tell me now. I don’t want you to feel like I’m using you.”
Steve eased his grip but did not let go.  He stepped closer until there was a bare inch between them.  His hand slipped into Tony’s and folded their fingers together.  “I’m not sorry about what just happened,” he whispered, lowering his head until his forehead was pressed against Tony’s.  “I’ve wanted that for so long, but I didn’t know how to tell you, and now I’m scared to death that it’s too late.”
“I feel better now.”
“Okay,” Steve said warily, and followed him out the door.
Tony repeated incredulously. "So, I have never heard you sneeze before."
“I need to talk to you about something.”
“I know. But you can’t force love where there isn’t any.”
feel like a home,” Tony said. “But only because you’re here. It’s never felt like that before.”
Steve put the thought of that right out of his head.  He was feeling bad enough without a raging hard-on complicating things even more.
“Does he know?”
“Somewhere close, though.  I can’t go back into the city yet.  I-I don’t think it would be good for me.”
“Don’t hurt yourself, Rogers.”
Steve let out a strangled breath as Tony laughed again and hung up, leaving Steve holding a dead receiver. “Tony,” he choked out between sobs. “Tony, don’t go. Tony.” He ran his hand back through his hair, clutching at it, crushing the phone against his ear. “I need you. I miss you. Christ, Tony, please,” he whispered into the nothing in his ear. “I love you. I love you so much. I wanna be with you. Forever, Tony. Please. Please.”
Sarah scrutinized him, her eyes flashing over his face. “Don’t bottle it in, Steve,” she said softly. “If there
Tony glanced at him.  “I’m going to pretend like you didn’t just say ‘our age’ like we’re the
Steve clutched Tony to his chest. Tony muttered again, shifted, quieted.
“Hm,” Howard mused. “I believe I may have underestimated you, Steven.”
He walked like he used to. Walked up and down the streets, shoulders hunched in on themselves inside his jacket. The weather had turned cool, and as the hours passed and evening turned into night, a deep chill settled into his bones. He hated to be cold. It had been a while since he had felt so cold. Not since before he and Tony became friends. Tony exuded so much warmth, wrapped him so generously in it every day, every hour, every second of every day, especially now that they were more than friends. Now that they were
“Just tell me what it says, smartass, huh?”
“Mmm. For the kiss or the offer to sue me?”
“You’ll monitor this, right?  If you think she’s hurting--the
He didn’t hear the soft-footed approach. He only looked up when the shadow fell on the page. And when he finally did, his eyes widened minutely.
Steve nodded.  “That’s what we should all hope for.”
They waved at the taillights, and then Sam turned to Natasha. “I’m sorry about tonight,” he began, but Nat laid her finger across his lips.
Tony glanced at him. He sounded so shy. His face and chest flushed with red. “What?” Tony asked curiously.
One more night.
“Hey,” Tony said, rising.  “Are you okay?”
Steve shook his head. “No. That’s all you, Tony.”
“It’s a nice view,” Rhodey said, gesturing with his bottle toward the lake.
Tony came up beside him.  The gauntlet he had used to shoot him with melted away as he put his arm around Steve’s back and heaved him up.  “Come on, soldier,” he said.  “Up you get.  Come on, you’re fine, I only hit you with point-five percent.”
“No, I don’t,” Tony said.  “I think you’re doing what you need to do.  If that means we don’t ever discuss it, then we never discuss it.  I don’t care.
“Of fucking
“Christ, think about that,” Steve mused, and his voice was quiet, filled with shadowy awe. “Ten years, Tony. Where the fuck did that go? Huh?”
The smile got bigger. Better. “Nice,” Tony said, backing into his own door. “Goodnight.”
Tony watched him go, half-amused, half-anxious.  It was the third time he had asked.  Tony thought he was just excited and maybe a little nervous.  It had been just the two of them here for over a month, discounting Rhodey’s little day-visit, and it was strange to think of someone else coming into this space.
Steve laughed.  “Yeah.”
“Hope so.”
“He's not pressing charges. He knows if he did he'd have to explain to his wife exactly why he got into a bar-fight in the first place."
“No fights?”
Short and sweet...
“Tony.”
Steve nodded his head. “But just sleep, okay?” he managed, trying to hold on to that last shred of self-control.
“Nat and I are just friends.”
Steve blinked fast, smiled. “Buffalo.”
Steve squeezed Tony’s hand one more time then let it go.  He sat Wanda up, then held her face in his large hands.  “Are you sure about this, red?”
in a while.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed. “We’re almost there. I think you’ll like that too.”
Tony squatted easily and ran his hand through the grass.  A light drizzle was falling and it was damp under his fingers.  It had been damp before too, but that time it had been damp with Steve’s blood.  This was just the rain.
