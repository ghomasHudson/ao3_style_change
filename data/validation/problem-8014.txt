Steve handed it over as gently as possible, but Cable upturned the shirt and everything inside clunked it down next to the glove, making Steve flinch at the sound. He tossed Steve back his shirt and Steve untied it and put it back on.
When the darkness was beginning to fade, Peter slowly settled back into himself and began to note the passage of time.
“Let’s get dressed, put those bandages on you, and then I’ll introduce you to the Commandos,” Steve said. “And then I’ll get you unofficially a part of the mechanics’ division.”
Tony dug his fingers into Steve’s arms and believed him and those unwavering eyes.
“No,” Steve replied and Tony’s relieved smile fell. Steve quickly explained, “That thing down there, it’s called Venom, and Peter is trapped inside it. It’s trying to become one with him! We need to separate them before it’s too late!”
“The Captain is in a coma,” the doctor stated, saying the very words echoing ominously in Coulson’s mind. It had been a week since Rogers was brought into the hospital, a week since he was operated on, and a week since he’d been conscious. Captain Rogers was healed and should no longer be unconscious at this point. Yet, the Captain wasn’t stirring. The doctor continued, “I have never seen a coma like it before. It is like he is in a medically induced coma but, we are not the cause of it. For some reason, the Captain will not wake, his heart is beating slower than it should be, and he is showing signs of only minimal brain activity…It is a miracle he survived but, maybe, only his body survived and Steve Rogers gave up.”
“Wade, dear! Don’t forget brunch on Tuesday!” May called after them.
Tony nodded happily and they embraced again.
Steve expected him to cry again, simply embrace him for comfort, or maybe open up about what happened.
“Tony, we can discuss pet names later,
Peter wrapped his arms behind Wade’s neck and started to kiss him again as he dragged Wade across the hall toward his bedroom. A few frames were knocked off the wall in the process but Wade didn’t really mind because he was going to his bedroom with a highly-aroused Peter and only good things can come of this.
“Yes, but why –,” Peggy began.
“Steve, put your hands down and, Pep, turn around, we’re decent,” Tony stated and he pushed himself up to sit next to Steve.
It took Peter a moment to remember the meaning to the acronym and then he burst out laughing. He knew there were websites that “shipped” his dad with Steve, he’d come across them when he first found out Tony was his father and researched him. He found it hilarious that Wade was one of
“No, shit?!” Tony gasped. Before Peter’s exposure, his lab experiment with Brock was all he talked about.
flirting to Wade? What if Peter just took it too far?
“I need to speak with Peggy. Can you keep an eye on him and, if he wakes, come get me?”
Wade paid the cabbie off with the card Clint had given him and the man drove off before Wade completely shut the door. He turned back to the Parker brownstone with slight trepidation.
survive, then neither should
“We’ll go down fighting…together,” he replied.
“…I’m sorry, Steve,” Tony murmured gently. Tony reached forward and lightly took his hand. Steve curled his fingers into Tony’s and they both looked at each other with longing.
Taken aback, Steve gasped, “What?”
Barton was the only one who wasn't there because he went out for Brock. Once the initial chaos of Venom’s capture was over, Steve took charge of his team and Barton was the first to receive direction. Getting Brock was their number one priority.
Steve’s heart rate picked up and he leaned in closer as he ran his fingers along Tony’s scalp. He kept at it for a couple of minutes and Tony’s hand left the back of his neck and began to do the same to Steve's hair. Steve did not think it was possible but he had to bite back a moan under the touch.
,” Steve hissed he reached out to him but only felt residual heat. Tony was gone. Steve’s heart began to beat faster and he called out, “
Steve did not think both of them would attend the party at the same time.
He was so very conscious of their state of undress and Tony’s familiar touches. His body was beginning to react and, with
Pride and love burned brightly in his chest.
“Yes, sir.”
Last night was a blur of drinking, laughing, and fun.
“We’ll wrap you back up and you can sleep on the comfier cots in the medical tent,” Gabe offered.
going to let me live it down.”
“I think he’s referring to my skin condition and not the fact that I have a glowing reactor embedded in my chest,” Tony sarcastically grunted and bumped the back of his head against Steve’s stomach as he leaned into him.
She forced herself to calm down then smoothed back her hair. To the doctor, she commented, “He’s is not going to be thrilled.”
To escape Steve’s shocked gaze, Tony dropped his head and buried his face into the couch by Steve’s shoulder. He felt blood rushing to his face as he murmured, “…Sorry.”
No one attempted to stop Steve as he stalked out of the building. Steve did not pause to say hello to the agents he knew and worked with nor did he look back.
Within the portal, the nuclear blast went off, destroying the ship within and the Chitauri on Earth fell all around them.
Peter hid his smile with his papers and then murmured, “Those were pretty much my thoughts when I found out…”
Steve had a beard. How -? When-?
“You are never going into that machine or cryostasis chamber ever again.” Tony smiled reassuringly at his long-lost friend and whispered, “I got you. You’re safe and, soon, this will all hopefully make more sense…”
“If I put out a billboard, Chewie himself might see it and try coming back…” Tony added with a smirk as he imagined Pepper’s expression.
They were trying to create a living shield that protected its host from environmental and human factors. It was going to be revolutionary if it worked. Their protoplasm was strong, durable, and reactive to outside elements. Ultimately, however, it was supposed to protect whatever DNA it was fused with and fusing the protoplasm was going to be the hardest part.
Tony was used to smothering his feelings and pretending nothing hurt. Growing up with an emotionally distant father and always being in the limelight did that to people.
He’d seen the notebook dozens of times whenever Howard had sat at Tony’s sickbed and worked on his equations.
“…You two are no longer together?” Coulson questioned, surprised by the new development. He was supposed to know of all the significant changes in the man’s life. He was going to have words with Natasha.
As soon as they had left the hall where his room was, they came into the thick of the 107
He pushed back Wade’s mask, revealing the bottom half of his face. Wade was smiling and he slipped his arms around Peter’s back as Peter pushed up his own mask.
“No,” Mary hissed, rising from her stool. “Not Hydra.
Tony slid off his jacket and moved with ease. He was wearing one of his designer suits with his buttoned-down shirt was too thick to see his reactor’s glow. He was not wearing a tie and the top few buttons were undone to give Steve a glimpse of his throat.
He gasped, “That’s none of your business.”
“I’m just looking,” Steve replied innocently, he looked up to Tony’s face, wearing the most innocent expression he could muster. Tony scoffed when they made eye contact.
He went down to his workshop and, because he was feeling nostalgic still, he opened up his personal files and opened all the images he had of Steve. He wasn’t feeling as sad as he used to when he had first compiled the photos. He looked at the images with a fond smile and, his chest may have been a little tight with sadness, but it bubbled with the warmth of his love for Steve.
The reactor was working but the next morning Tony couldn’t get out his of sleeping bag because he was feeling too dizzy.
Natasha knelt beside Bruce and helped him in removing Tony’s gauntlet. Her hands were steady whereas Tony’s were shaking.
Brock visibly gulped and replied, “Yes…but, there’ll no way to control the current. Peter would receive the same voltage.”
Tony snorted, making Bucky’s small smile twitch into a slightly bigger one. It was heartwarming to see…Tony murmured, “I knew the two of you would get along, jerk.”
The fact that it could happen again sickened him and the remains of his sandwich sat heavily in his gullet.
“No, let’s go,” he whispered, feeling like a coward, and Steve’s shoulders drooped.
“Dad is in the mood for an expresso,” Tony murmured as Happy drove them to Oscorp Tower. They sat next to each other in the back of the Bentley and Tony had been playing with Steve’s fingers, carding them in and out of his grasp when he finally spoke up.
Tony paused for a long time as he thought about their time together and then finally whispered, “I don’t know if you are here right now or if you’re watching from somewhere up high or if I’m just wasting air but…I love you. I still love you, even right now, knowing you’re – you’re dead…I miss you so much and it breaks my heart every time I have to remind it you are gone…” Tony couldn’t look at the statue’s face anymore and he whispered, “You were my great love, Steve. I doubt I will ever find someone as amazing as you were and even though we had such a short time, I’m glad we had it…I’m glad I had you…” Tony wiped a tear out of his eye and said, “Bucky is doing good, he’d be doing great if you were here but I think I’m doing a good enough job. The future is also looking brighter. Hydra is finally being destroyed. Your mission is almost done…and that bill for same sex marriage is going to be passed in a year or two so…so I’m going to uphold my promise to you. I know you won’t be the first in line to get married anymore but…but I’m going to be there all the same and I think I might come out and tell people about this amazing man I would’ve married…because I would have…I would have married you. I would have spent the rest of my life with you…”
“I’m sorry, babe,” Steve whispered, emotion clogging his voice now as he shared in Tony’s past torment.
Eddie shrugged and murmured, “It’s no problem…can I say I’m a part of the Avengers now?”
Mary waved her free hand for silence and Bruce complied. Mary stated, “Show me and then let me show you how we created the symbiote.”
What if they never dreamed together again?
Rogers froze, his hand stalling in picking up their cups. His eyes widened and he asked, “I’m sorry?”
{Maybe we were in a fairy tale and he broke our curse} his voice observed.
Howard’s grip on the clipboard became white and Bucky grasped Steve’s arm and tried again, “Steve, the future –!”
Steve wore his black SHIELD ops armor which was just like his Captain America garb but it did not have any of its patriotic stars and coloring. He had given up the shield so did not see the point in wearing his Captain America garb. However, he still felt off balanced without his shield, but, if Steve had his way, what he wore to this fight would not matter soon…
Steve raised his head. Pepper was kneeling next to them with a large, wobbly but happy smile. Around them, hospital staff and patients were openly staring and several had their phones out pointed at him.
“Cheers,” Eddie said, lightly tapping Peter’s tube with his.
Peter opened his mouth to scream for her to run but Venom overtook him again and once again consumed Peter’s would-be-savior.
Steve and Tony were never far from each other’s sides and, on numerous occasions, had publically called each other best friend and America fell in love with their rapport. Their friendship was being painted as the cornerstone to the formation of the team. People proclaimed them the dream team with Steve bringing the strength and old-school knowhow and Tony bringing the brains and modern tech. It was a role both men easily adorned. Steve had been the face of the American soldier during his USO tour and he simply adopted the same mindset. He didn’t have to kiss any crying babies yet but Tony still teased about the possibility. Tony too was able to handle the media as he had been doing it all his life. He confided to Steve that it was much more fun with someone at his side.
Tony’s heart felt too heavy to even to attempt to follow her.
Who is the mom? Is it someone I know?”
“They’re in the pipes, Chewie. The fireworks distract people, make them look up, and the aliens come out and sink into your skin,” Solo murmured.
As he walked away, his face hard but calm, he internally was screaming.
“You, my soulmate, have really cute bed hair,” Tony murmured and then started kissing Steve down his neck.
Tony closed the holograms and retorted, “It does to me, Bucky…”
“I was going to call Harry to have his chauffeur pick me up then Harry could have shown me where she was!” Peter retorted bitterly. Steve blinked in surprise. Peter had actually thought it out. His son was too smart for his own good. As if he heard his thoughts, Peter mumbled, “Aunt Tasha trained me to be smart about missions. I wasn’t going in without a plan.”
“So soon?” Steve gasped, framing Tony’s face with his hands. His heart had started to beat faster because of Tony’s kisses but now it began to race for a whole new reason. The suit was an experiment at best. Tony wasn’t 100% it was going to even function. What if it didn’t work? What would the Ten Rings do?
Captain America….
Natasha needed no more encouragement and he heard the screech from the scepter as it broke through the shield and destroy the mechanism holding open the portal.
He only had a month until he’d finally meet his mate. Years ago, he resented the coming date but, now, he was ecstatic.
Steve spun around and grasped Tony’s hands to calm him down. He whispered, “It’s alright, Tony. Don’t worry about what they’re saying…”
“Yes, Sir. It will take just a moment for him to walk into range.”
Peggy and Howard were holding trays of food and looking at Tony curiously.
“They’re both wayyyyy too young and will abuse it relentlessly,” Tony warned Bucky.
“Oh gay and narrow then! I don’t know! However else you would spin that!” Steve replied with a heavy sigh. To himself, he murmured, “Can never have a serious conversation with these two, they always find a way to twist my words…”
Then maybe he would have had at least one more precious memory of Peter before he was gone...
His heart clenched as he remembered the spot on the bridge he and his friend used to sit and watch the boats float by.
The place was a little messy, a close reflection to the chaos in Wade’s mind, but it was homey. The front door had a small entry way that opened up to a kitchen living room combo with three more doors on the opposite walls leading elsewhere into the house. Peter’s smile quirked back up when he spotted a wanted poster on the wall of Deadpool in the living room. It was written in an Asian language Peter could not pinpoint but he had an inkling that it was real.
have joined up with their team and added in their two cents for the best ways of dealing with Hydra or SHIELD.
– please, don’t cry. I’m fine.
“Stevie…” Bucky murmured sadly.
The projection of his father was of an older version of him with an additional twenty years aging him that Tony never got to see. The widow’s peak of his hair went deeper and his eyes appeared more sunken in due to his wrinkles. He still held himself tall and wore a modern, well-tailored suit
Tony's heart dropped.
The future was theirs.
“She will literally kill me,” Bucky added.
His dad was sitting on the ground, not a few feet from the door, like he had run in and collapsed. He was being held up by Uncle Bruce and was sobbing uncontrollably into his shoulder.
Suddenly concerned, Steve also froze and asked, “What’s wrong?”
Did he have a fucking kid or…?
He missed Steve and the rest of the team…but he also missed Pepper, Happy, Rhodey, and his life in the future…
Steve groaned and buried his face into his hands. He sat alone in an empty room with bare walls and no windows with the exception of the tiny one in the locked door. The air was stale and there was an odd stain on one of the cement benches across from him.
This was going to be permanent.
The bouquet was modest, containing three stems and each stem had over two dozen tiny flowers on each end. The flowers were six pointed stars and the points curled inward toward the base of the petals. They were bundled so close together that the stalk of the stem could not be seen beyond the petals.
“I only know he’s been taken to SHIELD HQ,” Pepper replied and Tony hurried past Pepper to his suit.
She had tried to hail both Steve and Tony but neither were answering their comms. The hour deadline had long passed and SHIELD was not answering their hails for help either. Something big was happening at HQ. They had gotten a few calls of distress and then nothing, just radio silence.
Taking it back to Malibu, however, was a different story entirely. SHIELD and everyone else was on high alert so he was pinged left and right and even had a LAPD helicopter fly alongside him for a little. He took the cryostasis chamber straight to his workshop but unfortunately had to knock over a few pieces of equipment to squeeze it in and finally settle it down.
“Look at me, Steve,” Tony hissed.
“But it’s different now…” Tony reasoned stubbornly. “Now
“You can grow it back when you get back to the future,” Cap retorted, waving it off like it was nothing. “For now, you can use my shaving kit.”
“Ya need something?”
Steve replaced walking around the city with Peter to walking around the building. Peter became compliant about the situation. Steve promised to bring him to a larger zoo once the media circus died down.
Steve wobbled over to Tony’s side and probably was only able to stay upright due to the way the other man’s gaze never broke from his.
“We’re soulmates, sir,” James replied stiffly in explanation.
Tony grinned and cupped the side of his face as he replied, “Hello.”
Tony turned his attention back to Coulson and asked, “When can I see him?”
Peter sighed again and leaned deeper into Wade. He lifted his hand and lightly rested it on the back of Wade’s head. His hand came into contact with the fabric of Wade’s mask and he lightly stroked it as Peter asked, “Why are you wearing this?”
Tony’s eyes flickered up and saw it was 4:42 a.m. He hadn't gotten a wink of sleep. He groaned lightly, turned in Steve’s arms, and pressed his face against his chest. Steve mumbled something and wrapped his arms around him tighter. God, he was perfect. Why did he love Tony? How did he get so lucky to win over Steve ‘Fucking-Fantastic’ Rogers?
Tony lay his hand on the tabletop, open and inviting. Steve looked from Tony’s open hand then to his open smile. With a racing heart, Steve shyly reached out and placed his hand in Tony’s. Tony’s fingers wrapped around his and caressed the side of his hand with his thumb. His hands were rough from the years he spent working with metal and electronics but Steve instantly loved the texture. Both he and Tony leaned forward, separating their legs but drawing their upper halves closer. They came so close that their breath intermingled.
“The Sinister Six,” Wade stated.
Tony narrowed his eyes and glared at both of them. Steve’s assertion broke him out of his shock and emotions instantly tightened his chest.
Steve looked worried and Tony smiled at him, trying to calm his nerves.
“Do you hear that? Is that you making that noise?” Steve asked in confusion.
“Nervous?!” Tony gasped, “Why would he be-?”
Before Tony knew it, his home was crawling in agents and equipment was being set up to make this SHIELD’s new HQ. He only noted them when they bumped into something like when one damn near knocked over a priceless Han Dynasty vase and Pepper almost had a heart attack because of it.
He couldn’t help but grin as he imagined the boy’s face as he crushed the reactor in front of them.
Bucky bared his teeth in an angry grimace and slowly withdrew his hands from Steve’s torso. Bucky slipped off his hips then the bed and turned his back on Steve as he stepped away from him.
His throat sealed with that silence. He opened his mouth to call out to Steve but no noise came out.
be able to sense any danger from it. To his senses, this thing was an extension of Peter and not the monster in hiding it truly was…
Tony chuckled at his AI’s tone and turned on his thrusters. He shot out of the Tower and circled it to admire the building’s progress before turning uptown.
for Tony.
city, right in his backyard. Jarvis relayed the coordinates to his helmet and Tony blasted forward.
“Your preliminary hearing has been scheduled for next week,” Tony stated and the smile melted off Steve’s face too.
Later that night, the entire team was gathered in the communal room, watching an 80-inch hologram of satellite footage from Vision’s journey. He would be in safe throwing distance to the sun soon. The Avengers watched the tiny smudge that was Vision with good spirits.
Tony seemed to get what was up and murmured, “Hey, hey, big guy, I…I’m grateful too. No need to hide it.” Steve picked up his head and tucked his face next to Tony’s. Tony’s eyes were so warm and loving and it was all directed at Steve. This was all so unreal and amazing that it had to be a dream. Tony flushed and murmured, “Can you be any more remarkable?”
They had a private ceremony with only close friends and family before the main one for the rest of the world. There was maybe three dozen people there and everyone spoke at the podium about Steve.
Steve quirked an eyebrow and evenly replied, “I’ve been seeing him more than my own soulmate.”
The latter thought hurt more.
Natasha positioned herself in the doorway and had her gun level at the only exit, waiting for the Red Skull or his agents to storm in.
“Hail, Hydra.”
Peter grabbed a fistful of Wade’s uniform and drew him toward him, murmuring, “C’mere.”
“It was more erotic than simply nice,” Tony teased, scooping water up to cover his arms. Steve cupped more water behind him and help pour some over Tony's back. His eyes trailed over Tony’s back, taking in the bruises left by his fingers.
“W-We never tried methods on how to remove it physically! It always responded telepathically!”
One by one, the rest of the Commandos woke and packed up. They sat around their fire and boiled water for their rations of instant coffee. When it was done, they wordlessly shared the hot water and passed it along the group. Each man filled up his own mug and their freeze-dried, powdered beans turned into a cup of joe. Steve missed the fresh coffee from the Hydra kitchens already...
Steve’s face flexed oddly and his gaze widened. Tony spared him just a glance before his eyes were drawn to Bucky as he replied, “It would be disastrous. The military is usually lax when it comes to the common soldiers but anyone who’s higher up…or under the public eye like Steve is…He could go to jail or worse…”
The excitement in him grew until he could barely contain it. As it was, he was smiling widely at nothing.
“Alright, gay boys, I think you’ve both had enough to drink,” Bucky stated, shaking their shoulders in unison.
had preserved him until they could heal him.
He never searched for familiar characteristics with father before because he never once considered the fact that they might not be related. He had always assumed his dark hair and hazel eyes came from one of his deceased grandparents...
He knew what Bucky was saying was true but…Steve couldn’t stop the way his heart was already tentatively reaching out to the other man.
“Trade secret,” Peter replied, the omission coming easier to him now.
Angry at Norman then, and with good reason. Did he blackmail her, threaten her, or something worse? Steve’s stomach bubbled unpleasantly as he thought of the man. He never liked Norman but was he more than a mean person? Could he have locked Mary away against her will?
Natasha regarded him then turned to leave. With her back to him, she whispered, “The flowers did it.”
he was also waiting for the inevitable.
He looked up at the people around them. He was prepared to beg, barter, or fight –
“Ben!” She gasped, taking a step toward him, then stopping herself. She looked torn between running to Ben to running away.
A wide range of emotions crossed Steve’s face as he looked at the photo. Surprise, joy, sadness…it was all there. He put down his mug, still staring at the image, and scratchily gasped, “You would not believe how many days I stared at that photo and
“I think I’ll make my exit now then,” Pepper said and nodded to Natasha and said, “It’s good to see you again.”
Peter’s eyes returned to the television and he watched his dad fly around the tower, blasting at the enemy with his repulsors.
“Whenever a couple is happy, something happens to make them unhappy or break them up,” Tony explained.
“Soon,” Steve promised, wishing he could wipe away that expression from Peter’s face. “Your dad and I just need to confirm something with Uncle Bruce first, were going to meet her one more time for coffee, and then you can meet her. It’s going to happen soon, Peter.”
Tony could never relax in space.
“Odd,” Coulson provided.
Tony smirk privately to himself upon that last thought.
Speaking of which…
He wanted to run after her and scream that nothing needed to change. It shouldn’t matter he was once American! They were still soulmates. They still cared for each other.
soulmate.
“Don’t be ridiculous! You’re still you! And I thought I only liked women but I clearly am ok with the change!” Tony rubbed his forehead and took a calming breath before he stated, “Steve…this is not healthy. You shouldn’t lock up yourself like this. You’re only hurting yourself.”
Eddie swallowed his water thickly and, without meeting his eyes, replied, “You shouldn’t…you don’t have to thank me, Peter…”
Once she was as bare as he was, she grasped both of his hands and made him cup both of her breasts and they groaned together upon the contact.
Tony scrambled out of his car yelling for Jarvis to call paramedics and then he looked over the side and…and saw the intruder had fallen hundreds of feet to the beach below and…and was running again.
Tony nodded in agreement, not trusting himself to speak.
His eyes trailed to Tony’s abdominal muscles, where his fingers had trailed so often…and now will nevermore.
Hulk stared at the dark screen of the flat screen for a few seconds before looking back to them and yelling, “Hulk want Disney!”
“No, boss,” Friday replied, sounding amused.
The Avengers helped with the roundup and then the cleanup until Coulson ordered them to return to the Tower to get some sleep. They would be needed again when more clues were found in the daylight.
Peter pulled back and traced his nose along the side of Wade’s nose. He lightly kissed him and whispered, “You are the most important person in my life. Don’t you dare think you are anything less than valuable because, to me, you are the world.”
Finally, Steve found himself on top with Tony beneath him. Tony slowly raised his legs wrapped them around Steve’s waist. He dug his heels into Steve’s ass and Steve bit back a moan.
“How long has this been happening?”
“Are you up for more visitors, Cap?” He asked.
“Should we leave separately to make people less suspicious?” Tony suggested with a sly grin.
“Don’t ‘
“Are you going to leave the Avengers?!”
He took a step toward them and wobbled as his body tried to work through whatever damage Venom had wrought. He gasped to his husband, “He’s right there, Steve.”
has happened. We just haven’t had the chance to pop in his lab and check it out.”
Steve’s own body clearly could not deny the man and his heart was already head over heels for him so…why deny him? Why question it?
went into a beaker sitting on Peter’s desk. Wade was starting to get used to the
Steve spread Tony’s legs lewdly and his fiancé shuddered. Tony's hold on the bottle loosened, making it slip a little lower in his grip.
“There are other ways to fight this Tony!” Pepper hissed.
Steve started to tremble and he tried to hold back his tears and be brave for Peter but failed. Peter’s face was inches from his as the tears began to fall down his face and his breath began to hitch in his throat.
“What the fuck…” Tony hissed, not liking being on this end of the time travel paradox.
Tony came up to them and Steve dropped the subject. Tony held a cup of steaming coffee in one of his hands and the invention in the other. The coffee was already half gone.
Tony laughed again and grasped the collar of Steve’s robe to give his assent and draw him into another kiss.
He might've been imagining it but Tony's arms seemed to tighten even more around him.
Steve’s expression grew founder and he whispered, “If I wasn’t so head over heels for ya, I’d argue against it…”
Tony pulled out of the hug and cupped the side of his face. His eyes were wistful as he whispered, “You are brave, Steve.”
Bucky laid down next to Steve, wrapped his arm over his torso, and laid Steve’s head on his chest. He whispered, “Yes, he is.”
“It’s no problem, Captain Rogers,” Happy said with a nod.
The elevator opened and Steve stepped inside before Ben could respond.
He turned around, holding their coffee cups, and nearly dropped them when he saw Steve laying on the bed. Tony hurriedly put the mugs on the counter and ran over to Steve, gasping, “
Feeling uncomfortable, Tony played with his food and plastered a fake smile on his face as Steve laughed, "No, Sneaky said nothing of the sort!"
“What
“I can drink to that,” Tony stated. “…Thanks for watching with me.”
Tony shook his head and replied, “And give the board members the chance to send me another thousand e-mails? I don’t think so…”
(See the end of the chapter for
...” Peter’s voice whispered from the past.
Steve sighed and kissed his forehead one last time before he slipped away from him.
He rubbed his face and murmured to himself, “I cannot be thinking like this.”
“Do you think she got it??” Bucky repeated, most definitely referring to the letter he had written Natasha. He stood in their doorway, clutching the frame.
Now was a whole other story.
Peter’s party ended hours ago and his son was sleeping upstairs. He, Bucky, and Tony were sitting in his and Tony’s living room and Tony presented his idea about his first mission with Project Winterwidow.
The rest of its body opened and the human stepped out. Steve watched the entire process, dumbstruck. The man rubbed at his flattened, dirty hair until it unruffled. His entire body was grimy like he hadn’t washed in days and he was barefoot wearing only old jeans and a thin undershirt.
Pops’ brows knitted together and he whispered, “We just want to make sure we are not rushing her into this. She does not remember you being born and Hydra did a lot of bad things to her…We just want to make sure she is ready…”
“Your experiment worked?” Steve gasped.
He dropped the body as soon as the man was dead and it was removed an hour later. His subordinates knew to not bother him then and he was left alone to stew in his anger.
Steve readily climbed into the bed with him and held on to Tony like he was the only thing keeping him on this Earth. Tony held him just as tightly as Steve muffled his sobs into Tony’s shoulder.
Tony focused on the closest soldier with a ray gun. He was firing at any moving figure and already destroyed two jeeps, killing the men inside. Tony moved without a second thought.
His shield was with him, sitting on his chest, so he slid his arms into the straps and pushed up. The casket easily broke once he put all his strength behind it and dirt poured down on him from above.
“I am not leaving you alone in here,” Wade whispered harshly, coming up to Peter’s side to show him he was committed.
As if the Lord had been listening, his question was answered when he heard Peter begin to cry on the very balcony Thor had landed on.
“Forget Amy Mechanics, forget the Commandos, join my team.”
They could have shared something if only either one of them could have been born in different eras…
“Now…Shall we go over what you shall say when you meet the Captain and his husband?” The Goblin informed her more than asked.
The future still had them, thank God. He did not see any commuter trains, all the ones he passed on that particular railroad all carried freight. This particular rail had been around in his era and it seemed to still be going the same way, west to California.
"Sir, were you able to tell him everything you wanted in your first meeting?" Jarvis asked.
“I’m not older than you,” Steve stated, already in Disney prince mode already pulling some cheese out for the grilled cheese sandwiches he planned to make.
“This is crazy,” Steve whispered.
Rogers grinned and said, “It’s quite all right, I’m actually used to it. Tony does it too.”
“Swear it, Stark,” she hissed. “If you hurt him, I’m going to beat you within an inch of your life. That man has been through a lot and you hurting him on top of the rape accusation will destroy him!”
It felt like he held Tony for an eternity until…Tony finally showed signs of life. The body in his arms grew warm and pressed weight into his.
His eyes drooped and Tony’s heart leapt into his chest. He grasped Steve’s face and hissed, “No! Don’t go to sleep! What if you don’t wake up again!?”
Happy rounded the corner of the car, walking backwards towards the driver’s side door, and stated, “I’ll be on the southwest corner, except for every hour and half hour marker. I'll be making a sweep then.”
Steve sighed and was tempted to start their argument all over again. But then he looked at the shorter man and all his arguments dwindled away.
By the time they reached their destination, Tony had no luck with SHIELD or Phil. That gut feeling Steve had was beginning to clench painfully. He didn’t like going into a possible hostile situation without all of the facts.
“Tell Pepper, I brought Bucky home and tell Fury I did some early Christmas shopping,” Tony retorted, stepping out of his suit.
He looked exactly like the man standing only a yard away from Tony…In the decades that had passed, this futuristic Bucky seemingly hadn’t aged a day. He looked like the same old Bucky…except…
Knowing what Tony was implying, Steve said, “We don’t know what this is.”
He sent a similar text to his dad saying: ‘Just saw the invite. You are a dork. You and Pepper will never make my invites again.’
He tried to be discrete in keeping an eye out to him but he could not keep anything from Pepper.
“Oh, no, you don’t,” Peter hissed and tugged the symbiote back. Peter fell back from the inertia but he was able to get it away from Wade. They crumbled together on the ground.
Staring sadly at their failed experiment, Peter whispered, “It can’t stabilize on its own.”
Ms. Potts sighed and asked, “Jarvis, does the confidentiality contract apply for both genders?”
“What’s the new discovery today?” Peter asked them as he entered the room.
“Ok, good, because the mainframe hook up to the brain makes it sound like I am,” Tony replied. “Alright, little guys, let’s make a heat seeking missile.”
“Oh, you’re so cute,” Pepper cooed at the little boy being carried off screen. The screen flickered again as a few shorter takes quickly filtered through his father stumbling through his lines.
Peter hiccupped and sniffed loudly at the snot dripping from his nose. Steve brushed back his son’s tears again and whispered, “Promise me you will always look after him…Dad, Uncle Bucky, and the others are going to be sad but you, Peter, you always make them feel better. I don’t know what you do but your presence alone puts them at ease.”
For an immeasurable amount of time, Steve moved through the world like a ghost and merely lived by shadowing Solo.
The first text was quickly followed by another, ‘If you feel comfortable with it, can you not wear your mask? Your choice. You don’t have to.’
He was hurt, angry, and he and Tony were easy to bat heads. Usually though their fights were how a battle was handled not on the wellbeing of their son. Their prides were not on the line in this fight but their very hearts.
“Can I get shirts of all the Avengers??” Peter asked excitedly, clutching the hulk shirts to his chest.
“Fireworks,” Tony replied tersely.
“I’m sorry, Steve,” he whispered sincerely. “It broke my heart just thinking of breaking my promise to you and to actually do it made me feel like a monster.”
“Palladium poisoning,” Tony whispered.
Peter laughed and replied: ‘Don’t ever change Wade.’
Bucky had returned to his loved ones...just not his most cherished loved one.
“Sir?”
They all came to a halt by the door.
“Uncle Tony can do it,” Peter retorted and everyone turned to Tony.
Tony’s eyes were red and as shiny as newly polished glass. He looked disheveled and his shoulders were slumped low like he carried the weight of the world.
The other two did not.
Howard stared at his notebook like it was the Holy Grail.
Wade was slumped on his couch with a bucket of knives next to him. He was playing “How many knives can I throw at the wall to feel better?” Twenty-three didn’t cut it. The 24
The Captain lifted his gaze and Coulson was struck by how young the man looked. The Captain may have been born decades before Coulson had been born, but in body and mind, Rogers was a decade younger. His glassy, blue eyes only added to his youthful appearance.
He brushed it off too, trusting Tony's knowledge in the subject, and settled into their cuddle with a happy sigh. He observed, “This is the first time I have ever had a ‘post-ejaculate cuddle’.”
“Awe we at Unca Tony’s?” Peter asked, cocking his head to the side.
How did that get five stars??
“Dude,” Peter countered.
“Was that why you got her the ‘I’m sorry’ – hiya flowers?” Peter asked with a pinched brow as he was trying to understand all of this.
“This place looks worse for wear than our old place,” Steve observed. He tried to smile and make it come out as sort of a joke but his voice was hoarse and he only sounded sad.
Steve flushed and stubbornly argued, “Maybe, and I’ve heard hate for fruits but I’ve heard more hate towards anyone who wasn’t white or Christian and we’ve both got neighbors who are such and they’re happy!” Steve stared morosely at the sandwich in his hands and mumbled, “I understand if you don’t like it but…I just want to find someone too…even…”
“Can the real Steve please answer?” Bucky asked, smirking at Steve and not talking his gun off the imposter. He already knew but he wanted Steve to answer.
Tony followed his gaze and murmured, “Does it bother you?”
Gabe’s brows pinched together in confusion and he looked from Tony’s face and back to his chest and confirmed, “
“Make that noise again and
Jarvis wordlessly grasped his shoulder and nodded to him. The suit turned and, just like that, his AI was gone.
He wanted to race after his best friend and hold onto him and stop him. He wanted to try to reason with him. He...He wanted to...
The words were harsh and Tony withered under them. He lay limply in his hold and dropped his gaze, whispering, “Soon…a few days…when you finally face off against the Red Skull. You’ll both meet your end.”
Mary’s eyes widened then she gasped, “You met it?? How?”
Jarvis had a new identity ready for Steve within the hour they had schemed it but, after several pop culture references going over Steve’s head, Tony deemed it best he get a proper education before they sent him loose into the real world.
His fingers felt nothing as they brushed away the snow and icicles. They are like five, solid chunks of flesh and Steve darkly wondered if he had acute frostbite. Would the serum save his hands?
Tony snorted, glad he was not drinking any of the hot coffee just yet and glanced to Bucky for his reaction.
Tony peered down at Steve’s serene face with a small smile. There was a slight flush to the younger man’s cheeks and water still dripped from his hair. He was beautiful. He was perfect. And, better yet, he was in Tony’s arms after making him come with a guileless touch.
“You’re a little past the curfew,” Tony grumbled and Steve’s hold on his leg tightened in warning.
Peter sat up on his elbows and murmured, “I don’t really do much for my birthday, you know that…”
He was unstoppable.
Tony grinned and said, “We are definitely dating. No, we are super dating. No, we are super-duper dating! You are my boyfriend and don’t you dare let a bullet scare you! So give me that devouring look again and kiss me!”
After regrouping with Sam and changing Tony’s bandages, they decided their best bet for more information needed to come from Hydra itself.
Yet the thought had been planted and began to fester.
Pepper’s eyes widened marginally and she gasped, “Peter’s dating?? When did this happen? Who is this Wade? How did he meet him? How long have they been dating? I can tell by the looks you’re giving me it’s been a while…” She sarcastically retorted the last bit and crossed her arms over her chest.
Venom tightened around him and hissed, “
Tony stared at the mask clutched in his son’s hands and tried to keep from laughing. His illegitimate son looked just like him, was a genius in the making like him,
Luckily, Peter began to cry so Steve did not have to answer the troubling question Tony gave him. Tony released his hand and Steve shot him a small smile before shooting to his feet and running over to his son.
Tony leveled a glare at his fellow Avenger and purposely stopped moving his leg to announce, “No, I'm not.”
Harry squeezed his eyes shut, fighting back tears, and gasped, “I-It’s a monster.”
Steve gently squeezed Tony’s hand and, after looking to both of them, he whispered, “I love both of you so much.”
Once the car remained somewhat stable, Tony cleared his throat and then had several holograms opened before him.
Tony nearly smacked himself. Had he had a bite of pancakes in his mouth he probably would have choked. Why did his first complete sentence to Steve have to mention
A future Tony had no part of…
Steve turned to him with a grin and Gabe started a new jaunty tune.
“Captain Rogers will likely keep your confidence and he did not learn of his fate. All-in-all, it went as well as it could be expected, you even look somewhat clean-cut now,” Jarvis added the quip with a nod.
one.”
Steve wanted to gather Tony in his arms and just hold him and feel his heart beat with life against Steve’s skin…but he merely smiled happily at the obviously grumpy, injured man.
Steve suddenly paused and murmured, “…Is that your name?”
“Dear, if Tony had –,” she worriedly began.
The Goblin had leapt up to the remains of a second level, where Clint had hidden himself, and was trying to catch the acrobatic archer. The Goblin mostly charged and Clint easily evaded him but the monster was watching Clint with a critical eye, studying his moves.
Pepper had deemed yesterday’s interview their last hurrah so, barring any other controversy, Tony and his family merely had to ride out the rest of the media storm until it was over. No more interviews or statements. Tony, Steve, and especially Peter, were free from society’s demands. If society wanted more, then they’d have to look elsewhere.
“What the fuck!? Get the hell off her!?” Hawkeye tried to pull him off his target but he was no match for the Soldier’s strength.
“Yes, we’ve gone over all of this already,” Tony replied drolly.
“He’s good too,” Peter retorted. He didn’t say another word until his coffee was poured and he was able to have at least a third of the mug.
Pepper had increased the temperature and heat in the reactor, overloading the plasma that generated the energy. The impressive light show had been the reactor releasing that backup of energy. By the way Obadiah’s suit was sizzling, he must’ve gotten hit by the main body of the blast…just as Tony should have too.
had they been allowed to meet, love, and be torn apart in such a horrific way?
He and Tony were thrown to the side, with Steve landing on top of him. Their bodies didn’t land in any compromising positions but the front of their faces ended centimeters from each other and both flushed from the sudden closeness.
The port’s busy summer months had come to a close and August was ushering in the beginning of fall and the eventual total freeze of winter. Everyday Coulson got a little closer to the Captain but the retracing of his footsteps was slow and they were still weeks behind him.
He thought Steve was and...and Steve just laughed.
Steve smiled at the other two Avengers. They arrived in the car after them but had been able to squeeze through the press without a problem.
Steve grasped his metal hand and his fingers curled into his. In the years since he had lost it, Tony had improved the limb with extreme dexterity and simulated nerve endings…all so he could feel his husband’s touch and hold his hand like he used to.
“I’m fine,” he assured Steve, feeling shamed for worrying Steve so.
How was he supposed to do this??
As soon as she saw him eating, Aunt May busied herself with cleaning up the kitchen. His father also seemed satisfied and turned to his aunt and began to tell her his plans.
Steve chuckled, “No, he still
“Peter.”
Tony pressed his foot against Steve’s and whispered, “I
With the ocean to his left, Steve began to run north and, in what seemed like no time, passed the sign for entering the Malibu city limits.
There wasn’t as much of the black mass as there was last time. What remained of Venom was barely enough to snake around his torso a few times. Maybe,
In Steve’s mind’s eye, he saw the time machine in the French Hydra base that Tony had traveled through. He specifically remembered the giant circular structure that sat behind the seat. It had looked eerily similar to the gears in Cable’s glove and the one’s they had used to gather the infinity stones.
“Thank you again for staying the night,” Steve said, somewhat embarrassed.
“I know enough about
Peter dropped his head and relaxed into the magic’s hold as he gasped, “
“I can’t,” he gasped, struggling to regain some ground. “I-I am with Tony. I care for him Buck, I can’t.”
Eddie also smiled and he said, “Well…Since Subject A’s tested it out, I think it’s Subject B’s turn.”
Steve shook his head and straightened, murmuring, “Peter…I need to go to Peter.”
“Thief! He was my adorable walking billboard!” Tony hissed.
The Winter Soldier did not leave a trail but, if he was carrying Steve, that meant he was weighed down and was going to be moving slower.
Steve’s usual mixture of feelings toward Tony was now even more of an enormous mess of a blend after Tony broke the news to him. Tony appeared enraged by it, even more so than Steve, and he was pulling all out all the stops to get a handle on the situation. Steve was too shocked by the fact that someone would accuse him of doing this to react just yet. It was too unbelievable to him still.
Upon his blank expression, Natasha expression became venomous and she informed him, “I am his godmother. There are no other suitable candidates.”
Peter called out pitifully to him, “P-Popsss.”
"You'd really do that for me?" Peter whispered, shocked by what he'd accomplished. The Avengers and the X-Men had been trying to do this for years.
“How'd it happen? Where you born with it?” Peter asked, knowing he didn't have to elaborate.
Jim has passed away in action not long after Steve’s plane had crashed and Dernier had more recently passed from old age. They all shared a toast to their fallen comrades and the former Commandos sat down and told their once dead fellows what had occurred in their lives since they had “died.”
“Oh, Steve,” Tony gasped upon hearing the sincerity in his voice. “Jeez, I did not know. And that whole Winter Soldier fiasco…”
A glowing orange Kilian climbed out of the floor and smirked sardonically at them.
Fury pinched his brow and asked, “Should I be concerned about the timeline?”
memorized. Would you like me to retell it instead?”
“I gave my word,” Tony replied with a shrug.
Tony was still staring at him with a shocked expression. Steve groaned internally. He let this go too far. Tony had asked Steve to tell him to stop if things got too weird but Steve did not give him the same courtesy. Tony must be creeped out.
It seemed, he really had lived a different life once with her and, before her, with Steve…
Steve Fricken Rogers.
Both women blushed and they fumbled with the visitor badges. One of them finally managed and held the two plastic card out to them and said, “Have a good day.”
They were both wearing nice suits and kissing. Future Steve was cupping Future Tony’s jaw, the gold bands were on their fingers clear as day.
But Tony couldn’t change Steve’s fate or he’d change history.
“So they don’t…”
Natasha bit down on Bucky’s lip, her blood mixing with his. She drew her fist back as far as she could and punched him across the jaw. Bucky was thrown back and made no move to catch himself. He stumbled back and must have landed painfully on his tailbone.
and I’m going to make sure that is something you never have to fear.”
“Please don't. Or you'll garner more support for Ms. Tyler,” Steve sighed, his face buried in his hands.
Bucky’s arms snapped away from him and Tony carefully let him go. Bucky sharply got to his feet and, breathing shallowly, he stared down at Tony like he had just stabbed him.
Natasha had her freedoms stripped from her but she still retained her own mind at least and she couldn’t imagine accepting the Academy or anyone having such control over her. It was frightening…
They helped each other up and the jerk picked a tomato out of his dark hair as he asked, “What were they wailing on you about anyways?”
“You okay, Tony?” Steve whispered, gently running his fingers through Tony’s hair.
Steve blanched and his nose picked up on a burning scent. He gasped, “The meat!”
Tony was instantly enraged. Who would dare touch Peter?? And what did they do to him!? Peter looked like he saw a ghost! He demanded, “Who is he!? Who put a hand on you??”
“Tony…you’re too young to understand this right now so I thought I would put it on film for you. I built this for you…and some day you’ll realize it represents a whole lot more than people’s inventions. It represents my life’s work. This is the key to the future…
century, he thought having a family or any kind of normal life was lost to him but Peter provided him wrong.
doesn’t go to the fundraiser with
Tony stepped out of his suit and followed May inside. He’d only been in the quaint house a few times but today it seemed smaller and more confining than usual. The back door opened to the kitchen and Tony left May to finish her pancakes. He walked down the main hall and then turned to go upstairs. It was quiet and the stairs creak loudly beneath his tread.
“You mean Steve, Tony Stark’s sexy sex toy, Rogers, right?” Tony quipped and Steve turned around to give Tony a stern look but the burn in his glare was weakened by his blush. Tony nearly groaned at the sight. His boyfriend's blush was such a turn on.
As if the fates were listening, the van jerked violently forward as they were hit from behind. Everyone was pitched forward and Steve instinctively reached out to Tony. He wrapped an arm around his chest, acting as a human seatbelt.
When there was no response, Steve dropped his head.
Bucky nodded with a serious expression and Tony chuckled.
The video though…was it possible Peter still lived or were Tony’s fragile hopes trying to reason the impossible into an improbable possible?
Tony’s head fell back onto Steve’s shoulder.
The mass rose and Venom’s face appeared with a hiss. It leaned toward Wade and Peter with a growl and Wade hit a wall and couldn’t possibly pull Peter any closer to himself.
Eddie turned to him and slowly lowered the phone from his ear. His face was nearly white and Peter was instantly concerned. He asked, “What's wrong?”
When Thanos’s army started to turn to dust, Steve was relieved and elated all at once.
The glow was gone from the reactor so he ripped up Tony’s shirt to see if there was anything he could do but he was horrified to see the reactor wasn’t even there.
“I await with breathless anticipation.”
As if he heard her haughty thoughts, her soulmate reached behind him and whipped out a gun. The move was so fast Natasha could only attempt to dodge but her instructor was a marksman and he managed to shoot her either way.
“I have shrapnel in my bloodstream. The reactor keeps the metal from getting any closer to my heart or doing further damage,” Tony stated.
The memory of Tony pressing kiss flashed through his mind and Steve buried his face into his hands.
The mere sound of his voice was a precious treasure to Tony. He had never thought he’d hear it again. He still couldn’t believe he was here and he was going to hear that strong tone every day.
It was exactly a week until the day Tony would need the reactor to save himself when Steve was running by the house in the early evening, and something exploded within.
The hardest part was staying quiet. He wanted to say something to distract Tony from his pain or comfort him.
He was met with silence in reply.
“…Why didn’t you continue the ruse?” Steve had to ask. “We all believed you to be a machine. You could have shadowed us as ‘Sneaky’ and asked the same of me as a robot. Why put your trust in me like this?”
Steve turned away from Tony and did not look back as he left the room.
! Tony yelled at himself to keep himself from losing it.
Steve leaned forward until most of his weight was on his hands. He heard Tony make a sound of protest but he did not look at Tony or Bucky. He did not want to see Tony’s reaction. He crawled, keeping his head tilted up so he can watch the Red Skull and make sure he did not attack him in this vulnerable position.
Natasha leaned back and asked Stark, “Don’t you have a reactor to work on?”
Kilian smirked and said, “Power of course. Air Force One has crashed, my soldier brought her downright after he captured you. The President was aboard and went down with the ship. Now, my man in the White House is in power…By bombing that base in Kuwait and the Chinese Theatre I have frightened the American people but their anger is only a dim, flickering fire. Killing you, America’s favorite son, will turn that dim fire I started into a raging inferno. The American people will be clamoring for revenge against the Mandarin and I will supply the army of super soldiers to fight him…It’s brilliant really. In the end, I will be in control of both sides.”
, my sperm and impregnated Mary with it.” He blushed slightly saying sperm. He hated having to saying it aloud, especially to a lady. It was downright embarrassing.
He assumed shrapnel again and his eyes were already heating up as he turned him over. He assumed the worst. There was no way Tony would be lucky enough to survive a second explosion. His heart wasn’t as strong, Tony told Steve so himself. However, after turning him over, he saw no blood or visible wounds…just a hole in the shirt where Tony’s reactor…
“Are you sure?” Tony whispered, desperately hoping Steve was right.
Tony’s eyes flickered to him and then back to Wade and he reiterated, “I was just clarifying the nature of your relationship. I wanted to know if you both have the same version of it going into it.”
He was awake.
Bucky lay a hand on his shoulder and Steve leaned into the touch. Bucky whispered, “In his era, he probably wouldn't have thought twice about it. You are a one of a kind guy.”
can enjoy!”
Tony grabbed the comforter and wrapped it around himself. He followed the cold and found half of his kitchen was missing and was replaced by a huge hole in the wall, exposing his home to the rest of New York City.
“Did your girlfriend watch!?”
boyfriend’s hand with pride.
Behind him, he could hear Tony grumbling darkly under his breath until finally he jumped to his feet and yelled, “That man has no right to say those things about Steve! I was there and he was anything but
“Hmmm,” Wade hummed with understanding.
He did not know what to say to Tony to draw him out of this. He could not even provide false hope because there was no hope for them to cling to. The very thought made tears well up in his eyes again but this time Steve did not fight it. His tears flowed silently down his cheeks and into Tony’s scalp.
Tony grew and the world grew with him. As worldly affairs became more noticeably to the child, he started to tell Steve about it. Soon, Steve was getting updates on, not just Tony’s day, but also of the world. It was through him, Steve learned over thirty years had passed since his plane had crashed. Tony took it upon himself to fill in whatever gaps in history he missed, including the music and movies. Tony would try to sing favorite songs of his and Steve would teasingly laugh at his attempts.
“Yup,” Tony replied dryly, he hadn't been the first to ask and won't be the last...well, Tony hoped he wouldn't be the last...
“Why?” Steve gasped. Mary worked for SHIELD. They should have been the first ones to know. They might have been able to get to Peter sooner if she just stepped forward.
“Just a little tender,” Peter promised both of them. He sat himself up, propping himself against his backboard and continued, “It just feels like a really, really bad sunburn all over my body.”
– Steve Rogers?”
“Jarvis,” Peter stated when he reached the edge. He looked down the hundreds of stories below him and gulped.
Karma must’ve been on their side because…Tony found a cure.
Hints to the epilogue can be found in the latest tag, just added! ;D
-ly, decades after the fall of Hydra, it decided to grow back its Goddamn heads.
Tony lightly touched the side of his face and hissed as the pain flared more.
He didn’t seem able to voice it and Tony didn’t want to say it either so he gently cupped Steve’s jaw and pulled him back to Tony’s face. Tony’s future was screwed no matter what so he did not really think much about the consequences as he brought their lips together. They gently kissed and held each other, almost afraid to let go. But the kiss ended and then Steve buried his face in the crook of Tony’s neck and tightened his arms around him.
“Hello, sweetheart,” Steve whispered. “I snuck in here so I might have to jump and hide if a nurse comes in.”
inappropriate. He shouldn’t be thinking like that anymore.
“Am I that much of an open book?” Wade murmured, still not looking at the Captain.
Luckily, Tony had the largest fridge and pantry known to mankind and he always kept it well stocked to feed the team and a super soldier with a very high metabolism. Steve pulled out all of the bread, coffee, eggs, and bacon and got to work.
It was no longer blank.
With his testimony, the defense concluded their case, leaving the trial in the prosecutor’s hands…
The director took a step back and hissed, “What the fu –!”
They went to her lab, like she wanted, but both of them were tense. By the way Tony’s jaw was set, Steve could tell he was gearing up for a confrontation. They tried to look in on her in the lab but the firewall was still blocking Jarvis. They had no idea how Mary had taken her talk with Ben after he left and it was nerve-racking.
“Do you know where you’re going?” Steve asked as they journeyed deeper into the forest.
When Steve reached his side, Tony suggested, “Let’s take another walk.”
A look of extreme concentration crossed his face as Peter took his question seriously. Steve muffled a chuckle as he waited. As the elevator doors closed behind them, Peter finally replied.
“No,” Steve protested. “We can’t continue this!”
“Why do you hate me?” Steve whispered harshly into the comforter. He looked up and asked God, “Why do you give me so much after all this hardship and then make it so easy tear it away??”
Tony frowned at the flush. What was going through Steve’s mind? Tony tried not to openly stare but he stared at him from the corner of his eye. Steve’s flush may have revealed his discomfort but Tony reluctantly admitted to himself that he liked the way it looked on his friend’s pale skin and it made his eyes appear bluer.
“No!” Norman growled, “I won’t be made a fool of again!”
Steve squeezed Tony’s arms and then murmured, “Let me help you out of those clothes and we can snuggle up and get warm in the bed. Then maybe in the dream world we can imagine somewhere nice to go, maybe that tropical beach you went to in the second year of college?”
“Sir, by my calculations, you may need four stiches now,” Jarvis announced from the suit.
Steve turned the hologram toward Tony and asked, “And this?”
“Peter!” His dad’s exclamation interrupted his line of thinking. Both Tony and Steve got to their feet as Peter entered the living room.
Tony pricked an eyebrow and lightly grasped Steve’s hips as he asked, “Want to join me for a quick shower?”
“Yeah, it’s about a time traveler with a big head,” Steve sarcastically retorted in a quiet whisper.
Tony grumbled unintelligibly and shifted on his side and closer to Steve, burying his face in Steve’s pectorals. He leaned into Steve with a content sigh and his breathing began to even out as he returned to sleep.
. I refuse to lose you too.”
But it was impossible, a silly dream even. Her soulmate was dead.
She nodded, her eyes a little shiny from unshed tears and whispered, “I’ll call for pizza.”
“J?? Are you connected??”
“I know,” Tony murmured, his voice cracking as he nestled his face deeper into Steve’s chest.
Steve just wanted…he wanted…
“Maybe it’s because we’ve been using the wrong supplies,” Eddie murmured. Suddenly, Eddie yelled, “Think fast, Parker!”
The battle was quick but brutal and they just barely kept the helicarrier flying. They got Barton back but Loki had escaped and Bruce had Hulked out and was gone.
“CAP?” Bucky called.
It wasn’t fair that he was going to die just as Tony was opening his heart to him.
Pepper paused and asked, “What’s that?”
He whispered, “I…can agree to that compromise. Though if it's outright illegal
“Yes, me,” Schmidt replied with a grin. He stepped into the room placing himself between Steve and the only two men in world he loved. “You didn’t think you were the only one to have survived, did you?”
Tony flinched. This was it.
“Let’s go,” Cable gruffly urged and then ran back upstairs.
His near-smile vanished and he twisted his arm out of the alcove and shot at the Hydra agent down the hall. There was a muffled cry, a large thump, and then total silence.
,” Tony gasped. “I never thought we would do this again.”
He was tempted to ask Peter when they adopted him. Wanting to know when he’d become a father but but down on his tongue, knowing Peter would probably not tell him anyways.
Peter typed up something quickly and stated, “Done. No turning back.”
Could this plane crash be some kind of pivotal moment in the universe that couldn’t be prevented? Just contemplating such a thing gave him a headache.
Thank you for reading! I hope you're enjoying the angst!
“I think I need a scotch,” Tony Stark stated, earnestly.
However, there was now a downward hunch to his shoulders that was never there before and his gaze was clouded, as if he were not completely there with them. Even his voice had lost its usual tenor. It was like Peter had taken a piece of Bucky with him and Bucky had barely survived the amputation.
“But first the program,” Natasha retorted dryly.
My brother and I are doing well, and I should be able to start posting regularly again. Thank you for your patience! Now enjoy the new chapter! :)
Once the hum of their voices reached acceptable levels, Marston yelled, “Steve!” The audience’s tone quickly lowered several decimals and Marston continued, “Steve, you honor me by making such an announcement! Give me all the details! Who is the lovely lady? Please say I know her!”
He looked for more differences, unable to process what his mind was adding up already.
Iron Man landed in front of him and stated, “Things probably are really weird right now but, long story short, you’ve been on the most extensive power nap in known history and it’s 2003.”
Steve sunk into the water and Tony went down with him. He barely had a second to turn off the water before Tony pushed him against the sloping wall of tub and reunited their mouths. Chest to chest, Steve opened and wound his limbs around the man above him, inviting him into his everlasting embrace.
But the lunch itself renewed Tony's confidence that this was going to work. He and Steve had flirted low key between trading information about their day and where the 107
Tony dreamed up different scenarios involving Steve as he worked on the menial tasks Panzer had left for him. Most were innocent as he imagined different ways to flirt and win over Steve…though, a few were not so innocent. It was fun and distracted him from the pain of being torn away from his home and family…
“Eat me,” Tony mumbled into the mug. His mouth suddenly broke away from the cup with a smile and he chuckled, “Oh wait, you already did.”
Steve was a little thrown off by the request. He expected to go right to kissing. Handholding was so…innocent. But then again Steve was flinching at the simplest of touches…He flushed maybe this practice was not going to be the raging make out session he was imagining it to be.
“Tell you what,” Steve murmured into his hair. “How about I fall asleep first so, when you fall asleep, it’ll be just like old times.”
Before Tony fully committed to the existential crisis that was about to overcome him, he had to confirm: “My father is alive in the future? In 2009?”
Hello! Sorry for the delay! I took an impromptu, mini road trip with my friends and fell behind in my writing because of it! BUT you get a much larger chapter than usual and its only a few days late so win-win?
Tony was quiet for a moment but then he whispered, “I’ve had concussions before…this is different…”
“How can two guys who call themselves ‘Chewie’ and ‘Solo’ be so hard to find?!” Tony finally cracked, slamming his fist into the desk in front of him.
Steve came, biting his lip, trying to muffle his needy groan.
Peter flushed as he realized Wade’s adoration went deeper than he originally thought.
Why did God hate him so? Why did He take away everyone he loved?
“Tony?!” His voice was cracked and strained.
He saw the movement and jumped back and her bullet only nicked his coat.
Tears blurred his vision and he remembered Tony’s lamentations about Happy. Steve stated what Tony had, his voice came out in a squeak, “He’s a fighter. He can’t go out like this.”
Breakfast was nice. Steve had ordered out and they had pastries like donuts and danishes. They sat at the small table in their breakfast nook and basked in the sun as they discussed both Peter's present birthday and past ones.
It was there that a new nightmare blossomed.
Steve grinned and gasped, “That’s great!”
He gently put down the beaker at his feet and then slowly reached out to the shield.
“I was told you faced a dire experience and survived. I am glad you are fine, my friend,” T’Challa stated, clasping Peter’s forearm.
“Are you sure?”
He leaned heavily into her and tried to take comfort from her nearness but…but all he could think about was Steve.
“What do you mean?” Steve asked in confusion.
“I didn’t think this would be possible,” Bucky whispered. “I thought I’d die without finding my soulmate.”
His words were…mellow and Steve even felt a little sad by it too. They wouldn’t last forever… even their time at the fortress was coming to an end. The Colonel issued the move order just yesterday...
Tony nodded and grabbed the uniform Bucky had thrown to the ground as Steve happily pulled out some bandages out of his bag.
“Kissing my soulmate, isn’t it obvious?” Tony retorted, angrily. “We were meant to be together! I don’t see the point in denying it any longer!”
As many of you probably noticed, I purposely let Norman escape and get away with what he had done. In my mind, he and Peter will be archenemies. They will share many fights and eventually Peter will discover his identity.
“It’s too risky.”
But it also brought Steve clarity.
“Tony!” Steve hissed and Tony turned toward him just as Steve impacted him.
birthday, he woke up to Wade sucking him off.
Once free of the armor, he leapt into the Audi and sped out of the garage. He calmly adjusted the gears as he went faster and, through the car’s audio system, he asked Jarvis, “You still have an eye on his guy?”
Was he near home? Or Oscorp? Was he still even in New York?
“Tony?!” Steve exclaimed in alarm as the winds tore through the compartment.
Steve surged forward and stopped the metal doors from closing. He paused as the 1940s sentiments instantly cropped up. It made him want to smother the emotions that were welling up inside him. He had to remind himself what century he was in then embrace the emotions and say what he really wanted to say.
?” Steve hissed.
“Steve, I did not mean that –,” Tony began apologetically.
“Christ…” Howard suddenly leapt to his feet, scaring Steve, as he lifted his arms in the air and cheered, “I sired a genius!”
Avengers meant a world threat.
“Not even you,” Peter countered pressing a finger into Wade’s chest. Instead of being pushed back from the poke, Wade only leaned in closer, smiling warmly.
,” Tony cried. “
They pulled up to the bus station and then Father Michael proceeded to take money out of his pocket and hand it to Steve.
“You are useless right now,” she accused.
He shouldn't think like this.
Despite everything that was going on in their lives, Tony knew for certain today was going to be a good day and nothing was going to spoil it.
Steve rested his cheek onto the soft tuft of hair and smiled at Tony, agreeing, “He is…”
“But…” Harry looked between the picture and Peter with a pinched brow. “…But she isn’t dead.”
Bucky looked to Steve and hopefully stated, “Maybe…Maybe?” Bucky ran his tongue over his teeth and repeated less confidently, “…Or maybe not? Why hasn’t she approached me then?? She hasn’t said a word! She would say something, wouldn’t she?”
Neither one of them verbally spoke. They communicated through their hands, lips, and hips. It was strangely more silent than when they made love though they were going through the same motions. Maybe it was out of respect to the music…maybe because it was more intimate… Either way, they were both sweating profusely by the end of the second song.
“But he failed in the mission of looove,” Tony whispered to Steve.
Steve smirked at his friend’s acting ability. Had they really been dating he could see Tony doing something like this. Steve looked over his meat patties and sighed, “Just one.”
“Hulk don’t want Puny Banner to come out,” Hulk muttered sulkily. Hulk stepped over to them, his anger evaporating with every step. His large green eyes fell on Steve and Peter and his gaze totally softened.
Steve awkwardly ran his hand through his blond hair, dirty from dust and sweat from all the work he had been doing, and he said, “Tony…when you say you want us to be ‘casual,’ what does that mean?”
[…Because I still feel something,] Bucky murmured in reply. He kept his gaze downcast and speared into the ground by Natasha’s feet.
It took only an hour for Steve to learn how to operate a tablet and search the internet. Tony directed him to the historically correct websites and Steve dived into learning what had happened since he woke. He’d learned some of the basics already by word of mouth but desperately needed to know more everyday details that most deemed unimportant.
Tony took it upon himself to dig a little deeper and do some hacking in SHIELD’s database.
Wade leaned into his side and ran his fingers over Peter’s skin. Peter was shirtless but someone had given him pajama bottoms to help preserve what little dignity he had left despite the fact that
He had the ability to save people...but the first thing he needed to do was right the wrongs his company had created.
,” Peter quickly receded, realizing how bad that must have sounded so soon after their spat. “I…I want to tell you about my dad and how I met him only a couple of years ago and how…turbulent our relationship was at first…I just want you to understand our relationship and why what happened tonight was so much more worse than it seems…I don’t ever want a repeat of this so…we need to talk.”
They both chuckled and Tony angled his head away but Steve gave him one last squeeze and only then did  they separate. Pepper promptly held out his suit jacket and he accepted it from her.
In the heat of the moment, both Bucky and Natasha seemed to have forgotten that they were only supposed to be demonstrating how to punch for Peter.
“No, this is very real,” Bruce gritted. Stats and readings were streaming in and both Bruce and Scott were pouring over them while anxiously glancing up to Venom.
“You won’t be able to help him if you’re dead,” she hissed.
Sorry for the long wait! BUT I have finally made up my mind on where this fic is going so the tags have been updated! And I once again deliver unto you two chapters!
Tony sighed and said, “No, you can’t, but maybe using proven material will work again? Try it, she might surprise you.”
Ben’s face crumpled sympathetically and he whispered, “I understand.” He held out his arms and said, “Give me Peter. I will feed him while you pack.”
Steve stated, “Peter wants to meet you. Ben’s told Peter stories about you and has given him some of your old heirlooms. We have pictures of you in our home. You have been ingrained in Peter’s life all these years – and we want Peter to become ingrained in yours…Peter is dying to meet you.”
The suit was a blank slate…waiting for Tony to take a step out of line.
Eddie poured their experiment into the beaker with VENOM before Peter could say another word.
Tony snorted and then leaned against the locker as Steve dropped his jeans. He stated, “You are one sexy super soldier…”
Now that he and Steve were involved…when Steve died, was it going to be Tony on the other end?
“Is he wearing a backpack as he’s accepting his diploma?” Steve asked, pointing to one of the pictures.
They made love again and this time Wade topped. He moved slow and murmured endearments to Peter as the younger man figuratively unraveled beneath him with each shallow thrust.
"How did you do it?" Steve finally asked Bucky.
Natasha’s breath caught in her throat. There it was, the smile she had been looking for.
Her stark words gutted him.
Steve testified to his innocence and clarified what Tony had said, he was not attracted to women and had never been. He also stated that today was the first time he had ever seen Susan Tyler and as soon as the words left his mouth, the indifferent expression on Tyler’s face burned away and became venomous.
Next time, Ch. 5: Forging Ultimatums
Ben stepped up to the other woman and held out his hand as he said, “Nice to meet you ma’am.”
Please be alright, Tony.
Fury looked over to his shoulder to his senior agent. Coulson stood by the Captain and had been silently directing the others to remove the tranquilizers and then was going to move him out. Coulson had been listening in and met Fury’s gaze. He nodded once but it was all the Director needed.
Pops was hovering over his dad, from what he could hear he was begging him to hold on.
Date Night!
Steve’s stomach curled its acid painfully in his stomach. He was comparing them in his mind without meaning to, as if looking for the best match. There was no contest. He was with Tony. Tony was his boyfriend. Steve cherished him and all he did for both him and Peter. It was Tony who was sitting by his side right now, not Bucky. It was Tony holding his son, not Bucky. It was Tony who had helped protect Peter, not Bucky. It was Tony who he loved and Bucky…Bucky was once his best friend and, ultimately, a different man than the one he remembered.
Natasha laughed and it was a wondrous sound. She pinched his chin and slipped out of his hold. She asked, “So Stepan but not Stepan? I can work with that.”
“God, yes,” Tony moaned. “I –
“Pops…”
James leapt on her and tore the gun out of her hand before she could fire.
As if reading his mind, Natasha said, “Pepper has him barricaded in his apartment. She didn’t want him to run on to the stage in the middle of the speech and say something stupid about SHIELD. He isn’t too happy with our organization at the moment.”
It took all of Wade’s power to keep from bursting into happy tears right there but his smile did wobble slightly. With the water from the shower soaking them both, Wade couldn’t be too sure that one or two drops of tears escaped but Peter wouldn’t notice. He cupped Peter’s face and whispered, “I feel the same.”
“Telepathy?” Eddie guessed and then looked pointedly at the beaker.
“That and the Iron Man suit,” Steve joked, making Tony laugh. Steve continued, “But seriously, I am not going to kiss you in that.”
Steve went to get his own mug of coffee, elbowing Bucky along the way.
Deadpool always flirted with Spider-Man and sometimes Peter would flirt back but…it had all been in good fun. Peter wasn’t expecting anything to happen but now here was Wade, leaning toward him, obviously interested…
“Please, don’t,” Peter sighed. Happy was eccentric when it came to Tony’s protection but with Peter he took it to much higher levels.
“Alright, I ain't blind. What's going on between you two right now?” Bucky asked, putting down his cards.
Tony and Steve let go of each other and exchanged chuckles. Jacques tossed Tony another beer and he cracked it open. When he saw Steve wasn't partaking, he asked, “Why aren't you celebrating?”
Tony.
“Master Parker was orphaned at age five,” Jarvis stated. “Richard and Mary Parker died in a plane accident.” A news article replaced the picture of Peter and his aunt. The headline read: Prominent Scientist Couple Killed in Plane Crash. There was a black and white grainy image of the destroyed plane. Jarvis added, “His uncle, Ben Parker, also recently passed.” Another article appeared, smaller than the last, titled: Mugging Gone Wrong.
Peter paused, wanting to discuss something more personal with his dad for the last couple of hours ever since his conversation with Wade about the media.
you.” Tony surged forward and kissed him again. This time Tony’s tongue slipped into his mouth and drew a line on the roof of his mouth, leading Steve toward his mouth and beckoning Steve closer.
He and Peter were going to spend the rest of their lives laughing together and loving each other…it was the perfect, happy life he never thought he’d get…and now he had it with Peter.
“I got this, Pep,” Tony assured her. “I’m going to hook this thing up to my systems and figure out how to get him out of there safely. That’ll be the easy part…” He crossed his arms and, without looking at Pep, he stated truthfully, “The hard part will be what to do once he’s awake. He’s not the man he once was…he’s Hydra’s now.”
Vision nodded and stated, “If we do not act fast, it may succeed.”
Howard wanted to know why but, for once in his life, he didn’t demand answers. He could see Tony was in a delicate space and he whispered, “…Alright.”
Tony teased, “Gay? Please tell me you have a giant dildo hidden under your bed. No, wait,
“I told you we could hook them up,” Tony murmured, nestling his head back on Steve’s chest.
“Can wait! We're not going to cater to their every whim! So, if you don't mind, I want to get some alone time with my husband right now!”
Tony dropped his hand and grasped Steve’s arm, his eyes were only for the super soldier. The emotions in both of their gazes made Bucky feel like an intruder, more so as Tony wetly gasped, “Steve…I might only have minutes. My – My heart’s beating so fast and it’ll just make me go faster.”
Haha Coulson's in for a big surprise!
No one else approached them and Venom wondered what their endgame was. Then he could not help but wonder if he tried to eat the blond man again if he will digest this time.
Steve never once lost his cool in battle. He was always able to take a step back from his emotions and fight no matter the circumstances. But right now, all rationale left Steve and his emotions ran high as he looked at the scene before him.
“Go away!” Steve hissed, wanting to push them away, but unable out of fear of hurting them with his superior strength. His sunglasses had fallen off in the shoving of bodies and he took off his cap to cover Peter’s face so the reporters would not get the picture they were looking for and Peter would not have to see them.
His entire body hurt from the fumbling he took and his head spun like a merry-go-round. If his head didn’t right itself soon he was going to be sick and the smell of the rotting food wasn’t helping.
“…Peter’s outside with the others. He has not seen you yet, we thought it best he should see you awake. You have been out a few hours. And it’s technically a new day but it’s still dark out so let’s just say its night. You’ll be happy to know you are no longer bald and have some peach fuzz.” Tony ran his hand over an exposed portion of his head where his hair was already starting to grow.
He ordered a beer anyways and nursed it as he took his phone out of his pocket. He opened the internet app and typed in Tony’s name in the search bar. After scrolling through all the drama about him and Tony being mated, Steve found older articles on his mate.
“Moving on,” Tony quickly interceded. He’ll bug Coulson about Point Break and his Terminator-wannabe another day. Instead, he inquired, “Have you found any of my dad’s old stuff yet? I sent in my third request for it weeks ago.” Tony stopped tossing around the gauntlet and walked over to the spread out of documents over his work table.
Would the Army want him to fight in this new war? Or…would they experiment on him and try to find a way to recreate the super soldier? The latter was the more likely of the two since he had somehow survived all these years with no change and…it did not sit well in Steve’s stomach.
In due course, she stated, “I am here because you helped me when you did not have to and your son tried to save me even though he did not know me. I was showed compassion and now I wish to return the favor.”
“Who are you currently seeing?!”
"I do go bald, don't I?!" Bucky demanded.
James closed his eyes and asked in an almost undiscernible whisper, “Did I hurt you? Or Steve?”
“How does that feel?” Tony asked.
Steve blanched and hurriedly said, "We'd never do that!"
A harsh sob passed through Steve’s lips in response and the tears fell freely from his eyes.
“Wh-What are you talking about?” Peter gasped.
“His body was in severe disrepair when he returned to this era but, he is fine now,” Jarvis replied and Steve let out a breath of relief.
“…Maybe in a year or two he'll be open to it,” Pepper shrugged. “Either way, right now, Peter is our number one priority, not the press, not our shareholders.
Tony’s smile instantly folded down into a frown.
Without looking away from his soulmate and, in a small voice, Steve gasped, “Please don’t hurt him. He has nothing to do with us.”
Steve assured him he had everything in control and promised a meal would be ready for all of them tonight and for Peter not to worry about any of it. He even promised to have a word with his dad. Peter had slipped away before Tony woke but he could already imagine him grumbling and harrumphing under his breath.
“We should add more base,” Eddie said, reaching for the stopcock. Peter’s hand shot forward and grabbed Eddie’s arm before he could touch their experiment. He hissed, “If we add too much base it’ll dilute the solution and turn it to liquid! Wait, Ed!”
“Do you want to go over the specs one last time?” Cable asked.
Century, there were still events and peoples whom he had no recognition with. Steve put the magazine down and reached forward to card his fingers through Tony’s lax hand. Tony’s fingers sluggishly curled around Steve’s fingers and he smiled sweetly at him.
“I got him a bus ticket to Los Angeles myself. The bus left twelve hours ago. If you leave now, you might just be able to meet him there.”
, I am going to let him live with me. I have to help him, Pep. I have to…”
Steve looked down at Tony and lightly ran his fingers through the time traveler’s hair. Steve whispered, “He tossed and turned all night. He finally settled down a few hours ago…”
Finally, he will help his hero be properly laid to rest.
But he smiled more and seemed to be happy.
“Maybe I should use pushed by a bike messenger, I haven’t used that one in a while,” Peter mumbled to himself. He dropped his backpack, one of the fingers to his Spider-Man costume was sticking out from between the zippers but he did not notice.
“No, don’t be – I – Well, I forgot about that…” The cuddling was so nice and relaxing that the kiss jarred him back into reality. He had forgotten why they were there and got lost in the moment. Steve mumbled. “… I – Sorry.”
that left little to the imagination. It wasn’t weird to see Wade wearing women’s clothing. Heck, he’d once actually fought beside the man while he was wearing a maid outfit. Not to mention, it was incredibly hot seeing his boyfriend in the lacey undergarment and slowly swaying into Peter. Peter’s hold on Wade tightened and he began to rock his hips beneath him again, flowing with Wade and building up that need again.
Cable shrugged and said, “From now until you and Stark are reunited after you wake hinges on Stark. If you don’t interact with him and I fix this reactor in time, everything should be fine. I’ve been traveling through the past for years and haven’t disrupted much because I kept an eye on the big stuff.”
Steve chuckled, somewhat embarrassed, and agreed, “Yeah.”
Harry started to shake and said, “P-Please?”
Steve stopped, huffing from the effort, and looked at him impatiently. Tony continued, needing to get this out there before it was too late. He gasped, “Just so you know, I don’t
His shield was right where he left it, leaning against the wall beside his bed. He picked it up and unconsciously slipped it onto his arm as he jogged back.
It was still the stealth unit but the armor had more weapon inserts, making it look more bulky. The eye slots had a more pointed look and its head was larger. The most glaringly obvious change to Tony though was the moniker on the suit’s chest.
“Sorry to interrupt, boss, but we have a critical situation on at home base,” Friday interrupted.
Tony’s eyes grew large as he took Steve in and he hissed, “
“Yes, Sir.”
There was little to no information on the man himself and he could tell key things were missing from the files he was given.
Steve flushed and adverted his gaze, “I…I’ve been, well, how’d you say it? Gay? I’ve been, uh, gay my entire life. Bucky and I lived together so he met some of the fellas I took home.”
How had Tony found him?
On Steve’s birthday, Tony had outdone himself and broke the world record in the private purchase of fireworks. The fireworks display lasted late into the night and they used the fireworks so much that the sky never really grew dark. Tony had to pay a lot of fines for breaking countless city ordinances but he claimed it to be worth it.
He worriedly cupped Peter’s face and asked, “You okay, baby boy? Ultron hurt you? Venom spook you?”
Peter punched the button for the elevator and impatiently waited.
“Tony’s floor,” Steve answered for him. He blushed, maybe he was moving too fast. Tony might still be mad at him. Steve stammered, “I mean…well, if that is alright?”
Tony’s entire face contorted at the sound of his name and he dropped his head to hide the newest onslaught of tears.
“Sit on the counter and take off your shirt,” Steve commanded.
Peter was wearing a nondescript shirt and plain jeans. His wild hair was untamed as it always was but he looked as handsome as the first time Wade saw him in a designer suit with his hair slicked back for his parents’ wedding.
“And now we shall feast!” Volstagg stated merrily. He clapped Thor’s shoulder and their prince nodded heartily.
“Wha’ happened?” Peter gasped, peering at the decorations with mounting excitement.
“I am a dumb ass,” Wade stubbornly retorted.
“Have you ever known Tony to leave us in a hunch?” Clint countered.
Steve returned the hug, pressing his face into the side of Tony’s neck and whispered, “And we’re together.”
“Oh my God, Steve, what are you doing?” Tony groaned, arching in Steve’s direction to get him to continue.
His spare reactor was gone.
“Oh God, yes,” Tony gasped, interrupting him. Tony thrust his hips against Steve, pressing his own erection into Steve’s ass.
His armor crumbled and Tony flew back.
Coulson nodded his head in goodbye and left, coming within inches to the sealed closet door as he passed it.
“How did you get down here?” Peter hissed. There were numerous security checkpoints and Wade had no clearance to get past any of them.
,” Clint groaned darkly with an overly exaggerated sigh. Bruce chuckled into his sandwich and Natasha’s mouth quirked to the side slightly. Thor grinned at Clint and looked on the verge of laughing again.
Stevenson.
He could do something to help now that he was awake.
He went to the one place that had always been his refuge: his lab.
“That and baking soda,” Tony murmured with a smirk, looking to Steve.
“No killing,” Steve attempted to joke, though they could all tell there was no humor behind it. Even now he was trying to be strong for them when it was them who should be helping him through this…
“Fuck,” Tony moaned under the water. Too late now for him not getting hurt! Steve was worse than alcohol. Tony just wanted to go back and suck him dry.
All along, in the back of his mind, his thoughts lingered on Bucky. As he ate he wondered if Bucky had anything to eat and when he went to bed he wondered if Bucky had a bed to sleep in. He worried for his lost friend and could not help but wonder if he was still watching him like he had promised.
She rushed forward and grabbed his free hand and then begged, “There has to be another way! Somebody else – or another time –!” She gasped the words with tears welling up in her eyes.
Bruce’s statement only made it worse. The last time he saw Tony alive, his back had been turned to him because Steve had betrayed him.
you, Peter, he loves you, he thinks of you as his own son, and what you just said hurt him…He is
The results came in on Tony’s end and he announced, “The phone is in Ohio too.”
Tony sat Bucky in front of the TV and turned on the news to keep him from pacing through the house. The SHIELD versus Hydra debacle was the main story and Bucky was instantly fixated.
When his aunt walked in the door, she came home to Peter sitting on the couch with all the photo albums and boxes of photos of his parents spread out in front of him. She paused with a blank look of shock on her face. She questionably looked at him and he desperately asked, “Is Richard Parker really my father?”
To everyone’s surprise, the imposter suddenly stated something in Russian. Natasha hit him over the back of the head and demanded, “Who are you?”
“Wait…” Peter raised his head and looked suspiciously at Tony and Steve. He asked, “Then why are you two here?”
Schmidt backhanded Tony with the blunt end of his gun, pushing him away. Steve was laying curled up on his side and the Red Skull viciously stepped on his head and pressed the gun barrel against the back of his neck. He whispered, “Goodnight, Captain.”
“Unbelievable,” Pepper hissed, getting to her feet. She stomped over to the window and looked up to the level above where the balcony jutted out. She demanded, “Is Phil there?”
, Friday is sending me your readings. You need to stop what you are doing now!
“Go for it,” Tony mumbled, already closing his eyes.
He didn’t know how long they webbed across the city but they eventually made it back to their roof. The flowers were right where Peter left them though were a little wilted.
Before that moment, his soulmate’s dreamscape was only colors, random objects (mostly toys), random noises, or flashes of images that had to be memories (a warmly smiling woman, a large male figure tucking him in).
Tony immediately assumed the worst.
When Peter initially woke up, it was like it all had been a dream.
Tony did not get a wink of sleep but he was used to it and solved the problem quickly by chugging down a couple cups of coffee. Steve, on the other hand, also did not get much sleep and had dark bags forming under his eyes.
“…She was a maid here until Pepper fired her for-for…being inappropriate.”
He clenched his jaw to keep his frantic emotions from alerting the AI. He stared into his reflection’s gaze and hardened his heart. It didn’t matter what others would define him as…Eddie was in this for himself.
Peter’s head jerked up and he looked to his stepfather, narrowing his gaze so he wouldn’t have to look at the other two.
Steve smiled sadly upon his explanation. Despite Tony’s hurt, he still took the time to make sure they were cared for. That need to take care of others… it was one of Tony’s best qualities.
“Where?”
“Maybe we need to stick with the old fashioned approach?” Steve interjected, suddenly inspired. Both Tony and Bucky looked questionably at Steve and Steve explained, “A letter. Write her a letter telling her your true feelings.”
“HE WAS DOING FINE WITH ME!” Tony yelled, after Fury but the man ignored Tony’s exclamation and disappeared. In his wake, Tony let out a string of curses that would have made Steve flush.
Tony heartedly groaned, the sound shaking his chest as Steve entered him and skewered him right on his prostrate. Tony bit down on his lip and Steve grinned wickedly at him, knowing exactly what was wrong. Tony tightened his ass muscles and that wicked gleam left Steve’s eyes only to be replaced by shock and passion. With that Tony began to move and it was Steve’s turn to bite down on his lip.
Before going out, Bucky trimmed Steve’s hair and then he and Steve went down to the private beach and sat down together in the sand for a long time. Tony watched them from the balcony and curiously wondered if Bucky was finally telling Steve about his time as the Winter Soldier. He could've had Jarvis listen in but he gave the men privacy and went back inside and started looking up all the dating possibilities in the area. He was so immersed in his work that he didn't realize the two had returned until Steve came up behind him and pressed a kiss onto his cheek.
“No shit, Sherlock,” Tony chuckled darkly. He let go of his reactor and stiffly pulled his shirt back on. He slowly did up the buttons and Howard watched it all with a speculative look on his face.
Steve also noticed the obvious change and, for the briefest of seconds, he saw heartbreak on the super soldier’s face. Peter’s guilt doubled. He shouldn’t have used his father’s name…
“What if Osborn wasn’t pulling our leg?” Tony whispered in Steve’s shoulder, drawing him out of his relaxed state.
“Yes, that should help you keep a low profile,” Jarvis dryly retorted.
“This is real and you are spoiling our first kiss,” Peter dryly stated.
The only time she looked at him again was to state, “Steven is not gay. The whole time I worked in the Tower I never saw him nor Mr. Stark interact intimately. It’s obviously all a lie to discredit me. They’re friends so of course Mr. Stark would help him but Steven doesn’t love him. He loves me.”
He laid the album on top of Steve Roger’s business card and then got off the couch. He went straight to his room, tossed his mask on his bed, and then opened his laptop. The internet tab was already open with an article about applied sciences which he wanted to read. Peter ignored it and typed into his search box: ‘Parker and Stark.’
Norman assisted Hydra and initially did so to learn as much as he could in the hopes to reproduce whatever they learned. At first, the experiments were dismal failures. The Super Soldier’s samples led them nowhere and ended up killing their test subjects…until they decided to go the old fashion route and produce the Super Soldiers via Steve Rogers’ sperm and an unfertilized egg.
“Somebody woke up on the wrong side of their spy-themed bed,” Tony grumbled.
Wade grinned and wound his arms behind Peter’s back. He asked, “Are they captivating? Have they stolen your breath away?”
Wade nuzzled his face into the side of Peter’s neck and whispered, “I love you too, baby boy…”
“I still can’t believe you’re here,” Tony whispered. His eyes were riveted on Steve’s face. The other day, he thought Steve was dead but now here he was alive. He was half afraid to close his eyes and find out this all had been a dream.
Tony didn’t sleep well. The constant ache in his chest and uncomfortable cot were reminiscent to when he had been held captive by the Ten Rings. It made for uneasy dreaming.
Steve was not going to wake up.
He looked back to Bucky, guiltily biting his lip, and truthfully replied, “I…I met him a few days ago.”
“HellllooOOooo,
He sat down on the cot next to Tony and picked up the damp cloth Howard had left on Tony’s forehead. He gently wiped away the excess water droplets that had dripped from the cloth and then wiped down the areas around Tony’s face and neck where Steve used to overheat when he was feverish.
’s jeeps to transport Tony. They both raced to location and racing time itself in order to fling Tony deep into its future before…before the unthinkable could happened.
Images from the reports and scenes from movies replayed in Tony’s mind as he remembered both men were not expected to live much longer. Barnes would go first and then, less than a week later, Rogers would die. It was clear both would die for the other or…be willing to change the future to save the other and Tony couldn’t risk it.
“Everything okay?” Steve murmured, sleepily running a hand over Tony’s arm.
And just like that, Venom sensed his thoughts and the restrictions on his chest stopped and he found he was able to breathe again.
Rhodey was pacing next to him like an agitated wild cat and was muttering under his breath about higher command.
James took a large gulp of his concoction just to show her she was wrong, only to instantly clutch his mouth to keep from upchucking the contents. He ran to the sink, muffling his heaving as his breakfast threatened to come up, and Natasha laughed at his expense. He spit it out and gagged until every little bit was out.
“Nah, man, you’re still kicking,” Bucky assured him.
“But what if you deflected from the Americans? They’ll kill you before either of us could ask for sanctuary, and
“Tomorrow night…I mean technically tonight? You know, Saturday night?” Peter stated, hopefully.
“I don’t need to hear this, Steve,” Tony stated quickly, his face growing paler.
Peter leaned forward following his friend’s point. Steve flushed, thinking he was pointing at Steve and Thor’s photo of both of them making odd faces at the camera.
“Yeah, but you burnt me too,” Steve murmured, rubbing his arm. The burn had long ago healed but the memory remained. “I want to find a solution that does not burn Peter to cinders…And Venom jumped right back on me once the heat was gone.”
Steve graciously accepted a mug of coffee from Tony and then patted the spot beside him. Tony took the silent cue and, with his own mug in hand, he pushed himself up onto the examination table next to Steve with a heavy sigh.
Steve’s heart went out to Tony and he instantly reached for his communicator only to find it gone. He must have lost it at some point when Venom ate him.
Peter stiffly let go of his phone and sat it on his leg so neither of his elders would notice he’d taken it down with him. The phone was on silent, thankfully. Otherwise, it’d be lighting up and buzzing with every new notification he received.
“Keep it together, Cap. Or we’re not going to be able to get your better half back,” Cable said, pushed Steve back from him to straighten him up.
He found himself staring at her whenever she wasn’t looking. She was beautiful. He didn’t think he’d seen another being so beautiful and lethal all at once. She was a quick learner too and he felt pride in her whenever she surpassed her next level.
His excitement disappeared and in its place a large lump filled his throat and threatened to suffocate him.
Peter did this. They were only here to help him.
Natasha shook her head again and replied, “We’ve got people on it. We already have agents in Tennessee and in California, where Pepper was last seen. We’re going to find them eventually and we are going to help, just not in finding them. We are needed elsewhere.”
Alright, Tony loved the guys at TMZ and their hilariously ridiculous questions (his answer was Starship Captain) but the rest of them could go fuck themselves in his opinion.
He needed to get out of the area now before he fell into their hands and became their weapon.
Venom suggested eating wrongdoers but Steve denied it. Even a criminal did not deserve such a grisly fate.
Peggy was already crouched down and firing at the enemy like a machine made to kill. She didn’t notice him slip from her side. He reached into the trunk of the truck he was living out of and grabbed his own ray gun.
And Steve’s heart had to accept it too.
“I will watch Peter, go to Tony,” Natasha commanded and took a bite of her leafy greens.
“Yeah, about that, you’re from the future!” Bucky stated, turning it around to that glaringly obvious fact. “And a light bulb is in your chest keeping you alive?
Tony raised the phone and Steve cautioned, “Do not post this online.”
Tony walked up to the statue and put his hand on the shield with a heavy sigh. He never spoke to a dead person before…not even at his parents’ graves. Where did one start?
She returned to where she left the food with a slight spring he’d seen her practicing in her ballet classes.
“The truth will come out, Steve,” Natasha promised and Steve smiled at her. Tony could have kissed her. A promise from Natasha was as good as gold.
“Okay, make it ‘roar,’” Tony said. “The sonic vibrations from the ‘roar’ was probably what woke Steve.” Under his breath, Tony mumbled, “
“What are you two still doing up?” Peter asked curiously, pulling off his mask.
Bucky. He was in the hologram, Steve. He shouldn’t have been there. The future changed drastically because Bucky survived. I had to make a horrible decision so I could save you from Hydra and fix the future.”
Pops glanced uneasily at his husband and Dad shrugged. Dad said to him, “Pete sprung this on me with his therapist and Bruce was backing him up too. They all agree it is fine…I didn’t like it at first but he—he doesn’t just want this—he needs it.”
Steve was alive.
“Okay!” Steve said loud enough to stifle Tony’s struggles. If he kept moving like that, God knows what kind of damage the needle of the syringe would do to his throat or what would happen if any of that blue liquid would do if it escaped. He placed his hands on the ground and repeated, “Okay, I will do it.”
Steve paused in his stride and opened the link. As he took in the article, he slowly sat down on the bed and his heart sank as all the good and joyful feelings left him.
, remember?”
“I know, I know," Tony replied. It was going to be hard. He wasn’t used to retraining himself but he’ll do it for Steve.
Tony reached to the side and picked up the bottle of lubricant. He popped it open with a smirk and wiggled his eyebrows at Steve. Steve paused in kissing the area over his heart and lay his cheek over the arc reactor as he stared up at him.
Halfway through his mug, Tony hummed happily and Steve asked, “Are we human yet?”
“I hope Iron Man flies in like last year!” One girls exclaimed, grabbing Steve’s attention. He saw a brief glimpse of Stark flying to his tower last week. Steve smiled at the memory. He’d love to see the suit in action again.
Steve fell on top of Tony but, upon Tony’s muffled grumbles, he chuckled and slipped off him. Tony faced Steve and Steve scooted so he could more easily wrap his arm over Tony’s side.
But Pepper even paused in walking toward the stairs and she asked, “
Loki, the cause of all of this upheaval, was spotted in Germany and they were to bring him in. Steve almost sighed in relief over the mission. Loki was terrorizing innocent people, which was horrible, but…at least Steve could focus on the mission and not…other things.
Wade’s mouth tasted of sharp, bitter metal. It was another reminder of the pain he put him through. He gasped into Wade’s mouth, “I’m so sorry.”
After Steve testified, Tony hooked his arm into his and pulled him in the direction of the coffee cart. He excitedly gasped, “You were amazing! If I was a doubter then I would have changed my mind after that! Did you see those jurors?? That one lady in pink looked like she wanted to leave the box and hug you!”
Both of them were too content to move but Steve raised his hand in greeting and said, “Hello.”
“Wait –.” Steve stopped and then whispered, “Let’s go in there.”
“A month,” the Colonel bit back. “I will not endanger my men because our specialist is impatient to get back to his toys.”
“Phil…” Steve sighed, rubbing the bridge of his nose before stating, “I don’t think I will be able to keep my privacy for long being mated to Tony. Eventually, someone is going to find out. Wouldn’t it be better to do it on our own terms? I’m prepared to tell everyone right now.”
“I have no idea!” Pepper gasped. “All I know is that madman, Kilian, is working with the Mandarin and he pumped me full of this stuff that made me feel like I was burning alive!” Her eyes widened as she looked over his shoulder and she gasped, “Steve! Look o-!”
Despite the layers of clothing between them, he felt both of their pulses pick up. Both of them noticed at the same time and tensed but Steve did not relinquish his hold on the smaller man.
“Is that a good thing?” Steve asked. Steve always thought the ads looked a little fake. Tony grasped his hand and steered him into the elevator. Steve’s fingers twitched in his hold. He did not know if he should leave his appendages lax or curl them around Tony’s grip.
The Sinister Six were gathered together in a pile not too far away. Each man was handcuffed and hunched over in defeat with SHIELD agents surrounding them.
Steve chuckled and broke away from Tony’s neck to kiss him on the mouth. Tony’s lips parted for him without another word of complaint. When he eventually pulled back they shared mutual grins.
tl;dr I'm back. New chapter. August 20th also got hit with newness.
“Steve,” Natasha hissed. She dropped her head and Steve waited. The sound of her voice was what stopped him. It sounded so raw, so human. It was not Natasha. Even Peter stilled in his arms and stared at his aunt with concern. Natasha continued in that voice, stating, “Steve, do you really want to
march out so slowlyyyy.
“Hold on, Tony,” Steve whispered, clutching him closer to him. He pressed his face into Tony’s hair and closed his eyes, trying to shut out the encroaching darkness.
But come morning, Tony did not come to breakfast. After the meal, Peter was distracted by Thor as the large man was telling him one of his tales of Asgard. Steve stepped away to ask Jarvis where Tony was only to find out that he was no longer in the Tower, in fact, he was no longer in the state.
Tony’s eyes looked past the projection of Manhattan and the East River to the borough of Queens and whispered, “We need to tell May. I don’t want her to find out from the media…”
Tony and Steve walked over to the couch and sat down. Peter regarded them nervously but also with open curiosity.
Bucky grunted and pushed Tony to the ground to latch onto Steve. His grip grew lax almost as soon as he grabbed him. He slid down and Steve guided him to the ground.
“Exactly what I was thinking,” Tony said.
“Get off!” Peter grit between his clenched teeth, “
Steve ran a hand down Tony’s side and replied, “Just like his dad.”
“Thank you,” he said and stood. He let the lawyers surround him and lead him out of the room.
Natasha’s face hardened and she said, “I know what you are planning. Stop now or I will retaliate. You do not want me in the middle of your and Steve’s relationship.”
! No! What are you doing!? Stop!” Pepper wildly gasped and pulled him upright. She continued, “We have a broom and dustpan. You could hurt yourself! Let me see your hand!”
Before Steve could give an explanation, the machines came to life with Tony's presence and DUM-E, quickly followed by Butterfingers, raced over to them, chirping in excitement.
Again Bucky nodded and his hands started to creep toward Steve’s plate again.
backpack.
She pulled out some batons for herself and replied, “And you are my soulmate. How many more times must I remind you of this?” She turned to him with a teasing smile and he felt his lips twitch in return.
His secretary nodded and rushed out of the tent, pausing only to smile at Steve. Steve didn’t notice and went over to Howard.
He used the cream Steve had gotten for him…even though his chest ached all the more whenever he pulled it out of his bag.
The rest of the team instantly jumped to their feet and rounded on Thor.
“It’s my past!” Bucky countered. “It’s a past when the Winter Soldier was more than just a machine! I want to remember more,
The shield was too far, it was not going to reach him in time.
“I –! I don’t know what to say!” Tony gasped. Tony planned to support Bucky but…he didn’t think he was ready for this. He didn’t think he would ever be able to. He didn’t want to say goodbye because…because he wasn’t ready. Steve was still in his heart. He didn’t want to let him go yet…
On Peter's 22
“Then they are going to have to go through me,” Steve growled.
“Just for you, Petey,” Wade murmured, his mouth still curled into a smile.
“The officers would probably get some oscillating fans but their prisoners will get nothing,” Bruce naysaid the idea before it could take fruit in Tony’s mind…and he really liked it for a second.
Tony was alone.
Then the sudden realization hit Steve like a ton of bricks, Norman was playing with them.
Killian had wanted his help with his Extremis experiments and went after what made him most vulnerable…his family.
Tony could not turn around and meet his eyes. He knew if he saw the painful truth in that blue gaze he would crumble. His armor was on in in less than a minute and he did not turn for a quick kiss like he usually did. His face shield dropped and he opened a private line with Jarvis. He commanded his AI to open the balcony doors and when they opened, Tony blasted out of the room without looking back at Steve.
“It’s like an angry little chiwawa protecting its owner,” Wade laughed.
“Just don’t let me catch you sleeping here again,” the officer stated in warning and then walked away.
Tony’s lawyers had been reduced to a smaller team. Four of them were there, probably to make defending Steve a little more manageable. The others were mostly busily preparing for the trial. Marcel was leading them and directed the other three’s attention to Steve and Tony.
He and Wade held hands automatically, like it was as normal as breathing. When Peter noticed this, he smiled happily at his boyfriend and murmured, “From now on I want end every birthday like this, with you.”
Hulk charged Venom before he could resume his attack on Steve. Both yelled at each other with all their might as they met in a deadly embrace and knocked over a concrete wall, throwing their fight into the other room.
Tony clenched his jaw and nodded tightly. He turned his head to the side to press it against Steve’s and Steve nestled in closer to provide as much comfort as he could to Tony.
A few blocks over, they surfaced again and again Peter was freed.
“…D-Do you have a heart?” Gabe asked breathlessly.
Anyone else would have been insulted but Steve just smiled sadly at Bucky and whispered, “He made me whole. I just did not see it until it was too late.”
He began to breathe faster and sharply as he tried to control the emotional storm that was brewing within him. He barely had it under control.
“Ok, how in the hell-!?”
. The way that spandex cupped Spidey’s ass was God’s gift to the 21
“Actually, no,” Steve replied. “We need to secure the area. It's why it took them so long to get here. Apparently, the forest outside the perimeter is crawling with Hydra agents.”
Steve’s grip tightened on Peter and he silently prayed to God that he would never lose him.
. It was weird imagining his dad use it on Steve. Or total strangers use it. “Baby boy” already equated to Wade’s Peter in his mind and…he didn’t know how he felt about that.
,” Steve hissed. “How do you know about Mary and Peter??”
Only Monty was up and he was poking the fire back to life. He nodded to Steve and he waved back before dropping his rucksack and taking down his tent. It took him only a few minutes to tear down and roll up. He tossed it and his rucksack beside where Monty had tossed his own.
Because the Soldier found he wanted to meet this person.
inappropriate noise.
“Why do you keep looking up?” Steve asked him curiously. The threat of snipers in the trees was very low as the branches were extremely sparse and too thin to bear any real weight. Bucky was trained in looking for them and he was positive his friend would spot any if there was a sniper in the trees.
Bucky finally smirked at that. He returned to Steve and pulled him into a tight embrace. Steve returned the hug the best he could with his one arm and even pressed his face into Bucky's shoulder.
Steve did not care either way and watched the two debate with patience.
Venom followed the invisible pull and the SHIELD agents did not hinder him.
But he was rooted to Tony.
“The Avengers are coming!
Coulson’s usually passive demeanor slipped and he grinned widely as he replied, “It’s no problem, Cap.”
“Don’t you have her on video stealing the…’samples?’” Bruce inquired awkwardly, his eyes flickering over to Steve with a slight blush. “Can’t we use that to disprove her?”
They were most likely his enemy…but they were also his only chance for surviving.
Living on seemed impossible at first.
Steve flinched from the sudden, sharp pain and whined, “
Tony sighed heavily and said, “You were out a little over a week and I was shot three times but got it all fixed.”
Steve stood stiffly and James helped him put on the lab coat to spare him some dignity. While he helped him, Steve whispered, “I have a soulmate, Buck. He’s a fella. Like I always wanted.”
“Be-Beta –,” Jarvis said and his screens flickered with life. Tony sat up straighter as he took in the new world around him. Gone was the dust and decaying machines. In its place was a glowing, functioning lab filled with uniformed people, all staring at him in shock or hurriedly working at their stations.
Peter forced his grip to relax and, as he watched the flames die down, his heartbeat began to pound loudly in his eardrums. He could hear his uncle’s communicator as it buzzed loudly but indiscriminately with the rest of his family’s voices. Their voices were loud and frantic.
“Get out of here!” Tony angrily shooed them away. When the men and women back off, with the help of security, Tony murmured to Steve, “The trial is going to make it harder to control them…”
“Sorry, Cap,” the robot murmured. “I didn’t mean to scare you. I just wanted to speak with you privately and had to make sure you were alone before I showed myself.”
–Buddy, you haven’t latched onto anything I’ve said today, have you?” Tony sighed. He ran his hand through his hair and said, “I know this all must be so very confusing to you but…No more missions. We’re just going to work on you healing and remembering.”
“I figured,” Peter replied with a shrug.
“Shall I return the elevator to the ground floor, Sir?” A voice suddenly asked out of nowhere.
He squeezed Steve’s shoulder and he leaned back into his hold for the sparse moment he held him.
Tony could marry him when it became legalized in New York.
“Perfect,” Wade replied with clenched teeth, bright red with blood.
He heard the newspaper crinkle as his uncle lowered it then Uncle Bucky replied, “Most likely…”
Tony would never have attempted this in the future. He would’ve just created new cores, he would’ve never used a damaged one like he was forced to do now.
Bucky growled and rolled them over again. Natasha dug her hands into his throat and he punched her across the face. Blood immediately filled her mouth and she grinned up at him as her white teeth turned pink.
Tony grinned like Steve had never seen before, looking so happy, young, and carefree.
Steve gulped, his throat tight with emotion. What did Bucky do to him indeed? His best friend and first love, what was he to Steve? Bucky deserved an answer. They had danced around this long enough.
Peter’s gaze spanned over them and he nodded, saying, “We got this.”
Before Peter could think more on it, Wade steadied him and that feeling drifted away in seconds, including the anger. He smiled gratefully at his boyfriend and Wade smiled back unknowingly as to why.
ignore Peter’s commands before and thought nothing of it! I could have used my head for once and saved him before this happened! It’s my fault! Peter is in there because of me!”
Tony was frowning but he nodded and quickly embraced Steve tightly before running to the elevator. As soon as he disappeared, Steve stumbled back and collapsed onto the couch. He caught his head in his hands and internally battled with a hurricane of emotions.
“You tried to fuck me into Sam’s counter?” Tony supplied dryly.
again.
Captain America! Tony could hardly believe it.
Tony came with a strangled cry and collapsed beneath him. Steve let his face slip from his fingers and he readjusted his hold on Tony’s hips. Steve clutched his hips tightly and thrust quickly and shallowly to follow his lover and he too collapsed as he came.
Steve sat and asked, “What kind of tests?”
Steve grasped both of Tony’s hands and pulled him toward the tub, whispering, “We’ve gone through enough heartbreak in our lifetime to last each other three lifetimes over.”
Stark couldn’t – no – he wouldn’t, he…Norman’s mind worked it out and he realized Stark saw no other option. Norman confirmed for the other man that his son was gone and now nothing was holding him back from killing the beast he thought destroyed the boy he had adopted. He was really going to kill Venom.
“But why kill us?” Howard murmured to Peggy as they entered the building. “Wouldn’t they want to kidnap us instead for our knowledge?”
Harry ended up leading them to his father’s study but stopped dead in his tracks when he saw the door was closed. He gasped, “We can’t go in there.”
“Tony...What is going on?” Bruce asked.
“Wha-?”
Peter had said he’d used alien materials to make that suit. Could that explain it?
“H-Have you and Mary f-found anything since then?” Tony asked, fighting with all his soul to keep his voice steady and his eyes dry in front of Bruce. He had to be strong for Bruce, he was always there for Bruce and he did not want his friend to doubt his strength…and at that moment all of Tony’s strength had shriveled into a thin, gossamer barrier that would hold up to nothing. He forced his mind to not think about Steve’s grisly fate and focus on the science.
Tony followed the communicator’s signal to where Peter was. He had been expecting him to be waiting on the side of the street. His son sounded unusual but he was clearly alone. He heard no voices in the background so he had to be safe from the paparazzi.
“Steve’s been busy and it’s depressing being upstairs all alone,” Tony replied with a shrug. The apartment felt too empty without his friend’s presence. Pepper visibly looked upset by his statement and Tony retorted, “Hey! Don’t look like that! I’m getting stuff done!”
“Then I’m at a loss…” Peter sighed.
“You big idiot,” Tony murmured into his mouth but then wrapped his hands behind Steve’s head and returned the kiss.
“It’s not your fault,” Steve replied, squeezing Tony’s hand slightly. He instantly felt guilty. Here he was worry about himself and he hadn’t even considered how Tony felt.
“Just giving an example,” Tony retorted. He let go of Steve’s hand and said, “I’m going to be more touchy-feely to make our relationship more believable later…unless you keep jerking about like I’m shocking you with electrodes…”
His dad looked like he didn’t want to leave but he nodded and repeated, “Alright…Alright, well, we’ll be right outside.”
“Stop it!” She hissed.
He expected another rebuttal from Steve. Instead, his husband’s hold grew lax and he pulled away from Tony. Tony moved with him, fearing losing his touch but Steve separated himself from him all the same.
“BARNES!” Howard yelled aghast.
Before Tony could say anything, he leapt off the cliffside.
His bedroom was not too far away and, as soon as he pulled Steve into the room, Steve pulled back and drew Tony back to his embrace and warm kiss.
“Yup!”
The creature was his creator and, just maybe, he could be his savior as well…
“I kissed you because
So this fiction is going to involve a lot of New York legalities and, since I am Californian, I may not get everything right! If I mess up on anything please let me know! XD
As Steve fought, all he could think about was Peter. Was he okay? What if this Doctor Doom decided to attack the tower too? What if Peter threw a tantrum? What if he hurt Ben? What if Ben was not keeping such a good eye on him and he swallowed something? What if he got into something he was not supposed to? What if? What if? What if? The “what ifs” tumbled around his head making him crazy with worry.
Tony carded his fingers over his stomach where some of his scars were and murmured, “You saw all of me the other night. Don’t tell me the reactor distracted you from the rest of me?”
Tony had stupidly grown hopeful as soon as he found out there was a Winter Soldier in this timeline but now he was crushed and was reminded of how he missed Steve so much…
and he only remembered
Tony put down his tools and gasped, “Let me see!”
Peter.”
Steve sighed heavily and pulled Peter into a hug. He whispered, “I wish it could be so simple…”
“It’s all we can get…”
Tony glanced down and huffed, “Huh. I thought it was getting a little wet in there.” Looking back at Steve, Tony explained, “I just got clipped by a bullet.”
“Sir, yes, sir!” Stark replied smartly.
“Buck? What are you doing?” Steve whined but used none of his superior strength to pull away from his friend. Bucky didn't reply. He just pulled them into the closest empty room. He sealed the door and turned on Steve.
Ben leaned in closer and whispered, “He is. We did the DNA tests but
Peter had said he’d wait as long as he needed…but would he ever be ready for this?
“I hate you,” Steve groaned.
“Don’t move,” Bucky whispered, his voice was harsh like he was not used to using it. Steve’s jaw dropped as Bucky murmured, “You lost too much blood.”
Tony ignored Clint’s comment, snapped shut his laptop, and raced after Steve.
“So I take it that you did not sleep either…” Steve said with a sigh, drawing another grin from Tony.
Tony shook his head and murmured, “He’s my best friend.”
His heart was beating like crazy and his hands were shaking too much to properly weld
“Hey, there, Steve,” Tony murmured, smiling with a coy grin.
He pushed Steve over with a grunt so there would be enough room for Tony and then curled into his side. For a moment, Tony closed his eyes and let the heat from Steve’s body soak into his skin and listened to Steve’s easy breathing. He pretended it was like any other night and Steve would wake in the morning.
Peter smiled widely and then stepped through the holo screen to close the distance between him and Tony as quickly as possible. He embraced his father in a tight hug and whispered into his neck, “Thanks, Dad.”
Peter looked at his aunt one last time and then, faced the door, inhaled deeply, and then stepped outside.
The SHIELD agent’s face went white and he looked from Peter to the remains of the burnt body. He stuttered a mortified apology and quickly slipped back into the room, closing the door.
Steve leaned down and kissed his soulmate, dragging his crotch up Tony’s leg until he came into contact with Tony’s hips. Both of them moaned and Tony began to lightly buck his hips, making Steve’s arousal spike with each thrust.
Steve suddenly was no longer content to merely wait and envision what he could behold with his own eyes. He slid out of the bed and tiptoed into the bathroom. The bathroom was spacious with a huge, Jacuzzi tub to the right and a toilet beyond it. Across from the tub, was a marble countertop with two sets of sinks and beyond that was the spacious shower Tony stood in. It was encased in glass, which was fogged by the hot water Tony was using. By the way the showerhead was positioned, Tony’s back was to Steve.
He tried not to gawk as he replied, “Just looking for Steve.”
What the fuck…
Howard’s jaw dropped and Tony hugged him one last time. He murmured to him, “Keep working on finding me the cure for my poisoning and never stop your search for Steve.”
“He was comparing Venom to the alien in the
Ms. Potts entered the room and jolted to a stop when she saw him. She stared blankly at him. Without Jarvis’s greeting, Steve would have still recognized her as being the woman Tony was always talking about. Steve awkwardly waved his sponge and said, “Hello.”
Steve also smirked at the irony but added, “Luckily, the ‘figurative vultures’ cannot fly whereas you can.”
Tony smirked and he asked, “Do you want a bath too?”
“T-Tony?”
“Yeah…Nice to meet you too,” Sam said and by the sound of his voice, Tony knew Sam noticed his change in tone.
“They managed to capture Stevie and not capture him all at the same time,” Bucky sighed, lightly touching the larger version of the shield.
But…it was the best option for Tony to survive.
He hoped Tony had returned from the past and got the help he needed. Steve’s heart shriveled as he considered Tony not surviving. Steve didn’t think he would be able to live in the future knowing that the man he loved in this era was dead…
And then there was TMZ asking him if he rather be a Jedi Master or a Starship Captain…
By the way Wade whispered his name, Peter knew Wade wanted him.
“Would you like to help me scrub my back too?” Tony teased.
, Steve…”
It’d be so easy to slip back into his old life that revolved around the alcohol contents of the latest bottle in hand. He’d be able to muffle the pain with enough booze.
Steve smiled sadly at him and patted Tony’s shoulder, murmuring, “You pretty much told me it wasn’t going to happen, you thought I was with Peggy, remember? History remembers me as a normal man who loved women. Don’t worry about it, Tony. I grew up knowing I’d never get what I want but, now, knowing what the future holds for people like me, well…it just makes me happy. I couldn’t ask for anything more. It’s near perfect.”
Next Time, Ch. 2: Hiding a Shield, Avoiding Shield, and Spotting the Shield
Both men had been affectionate towards Peter, like most parents, yet, after Venom they ingrained themselves totally into Peter’s life. They had been there for him for the good times, the bad times, and the times he wished he could never remember…It was with their love, they helped him feel human again.
She let go and he slowly lowered the gun, staring wide-eyed at the chair.
Tony sighed heavily and leaned away from Steve. He teased, “If no one could see us, I’d not only hold your hand but also suck your tongue into my mouth and have my way with you!”
“Hello?” Peter said. With the door open, he was better able to see the individuals who rang the doorbell. One was well over six feet, had a burly build, and blond hair. Blondie became his immediate nickname.
“Tony is hurt. You had paramedic training, didn’t you? Do you think you could help him?”
Bucky asked, “Got a prognosis yet, Doc?”
He woke with the memory lingering behind. The feeling of safety and acceptance in Steve’s arms remained and enveloped him in comforting feelings.
“…The future is so bizarre,” he murmured, opening a circular tin which looked like it was filled with soap that had melted flat. He got out another empty tin bowl and then poured a little water from his canteen into. Tony watched mystified as Cap, the super soldier responsible for bringing down Hydra, then dampened his brush with that same water and then scrubbed at the soap until he attained a fine foam
Steve nodded and murmured, “The other thing feels different.”
“Shut up, J, I’m human,” Tony grumbled. The palladium core to his reactor was revealed, but, it was no longer the white-silver insert he had installed. It was almost entirely covered in a reddish-brown rust. His core was literally the core of the problem. Tony gulped, “Y-You wouldn’t happen to have a backup palladium core on you, J?”
“I have to Tony. If I don’t nobody else will,” Steve gasped. “This might be my only chance!”
Upon seeing the frown splitting his father’s face, Peter promised, “I’ll be right back.”
“I…I can’t,” Tony whispered.
One of Steve’s hands reached behind Tony and under the towel and it unknoted from his waist, making it fall to the ground. He pulled Tony tight to him, loving the feel of his naked body against his.
“Me too,” Steve snickered. He grew solemn and stated, “…But I have been thanking God every day that you are still here…
Tony smiled sadly at him and murmured, “Future stuff.” He around at the gathered company. Everyone looked shaken, Peggy and Gabe most of all. Tony said, “Alright, let's get this thing started! Ready to help, Gabe?”
Rogers reached into his jacket and pulled out his phone. He tapped the screen and said, “For the last three years, Tony has had the biggest fodder for media publicity and he has yet to even hinted at it.” Rogers held up his phone and on its screen was a picture of Rogers and Stark kissing. Peter’s jaw dropped and he looked to Rogers to see if he was pulling his leg but he looked dead-serious.
“Apparently, they’re also the reason you were able to time travel to my era,” Steve added.
“I’ll come to you,” his dad stated resolutely.
She did not have to burdened with him.
I am handing it over. BUT what’s more likely going to happen is that you’ll be poked and prodded and nobody wants that…So the solution’s simple. Let’s get you a new identity.”
Steve returned to Wade and clasped his shoulder. He earnestly stated, “You’re welcome to come by any time.”
Wade jolted from the quiet voice and the touch to his shoulder.
She should not be reacting like that. She should be shocked not horrified.
Steve flushed and said, “Natasha, once told me about ‘friends with benefits’ and I was wondering if that was what we’ll have. We’ll remain friends but we’ll also have sex?”
“Hey.”
“Do you need any help?” Peter asked.
“When you were unconscious, we unlocked all the SHIELD files on our databases and released them to the public…including the Hydra files. He was in there…He’s really Barnes.”
Steve flushed and his gaze dropped and, for a moment, Tony thought Steve was going to push away. Tony desperately whispered, "Don't pull away."
Surprisingly, the first thing the man asked, “What are you doing here??”
“I will inquire,” the AI retorted and then fell silent. Eddie didn’t expect an immediate answer so he raided the room’s mini fridge and then took a shower.
Steve smiled at his lover and then looked to the other couple. Both men’s faces were masked but their eyes seemed larger. Wade pumped his fists and gasped, “Sexy Pops is the best!”
“Steve?” Tony whispered, his voice harsh with concern and he clutched Steve’s leg with his weak grip.
“Peter…” Tony stated, “I...I'm sorry for last night and how I treated both you and Wade. It was wrong of me and…you were right. You gave me so much. I need to meet you halfway and return the favor. So, please…come back home. I'm sorry…”
The Goblin grinned and his long, pointed teeth gleamed.
Peter was clenching his fists so tightly together that his nails were starting to dig too deeply into his skin. He could start bleeding at any moment. He felt like his voice would be shaky but it came out clear as he stated, “I cannot go outside. I cannot talk to people about my mom. I cannot participate in my internship.
His father was silent throughout the exchange and it got to a point where Peter forgot he was there. In the cocoon of their flesh, it was just Peter and Wade.
be on the list,” Peter said with a laugh. If not, his dad was going to get an earful from him.
Steve’s smile widened and he pulled on the same arm he just pinched in order to pull Tony into his embrace.
Coulson paused when he looked inside.
Bruce blearily blinked at Steve and murmured, “Steve? No, no can’t use Steve. Can’t sacrifice one for the other…” Bruce wearily turned back to his computer and Steve stared at hum dumbfounded.
As Bruce tried to explain his sarcasm to the befuddled Norse God, Steve whispered to Peter, “Don’t worry, Uncle Tony is Iron Man, remember? He is invincible.”
For the briefest second, Tony imagined Steve sitting next to him in his workshop as they shared a tranquil kiss. Being discovered would be the last thing on their minds. The vision faded and Tony ruefully agreed, “It would have…”
Wade snorted but bent down and kissed Peter squarely on the forehead.
Tony’s heart stupidly beat faster. He knew Steve meant it but it still had made him irrevocably happy to hear. Tony gently cupped his hands around Steve’s neck and whispered, “I know. These last couple of weeks…they were the worst in my life. I felt lonely before I met you and totally crushed when you were gone because…because you are my love
Everything slowed again. The shield seemed to float slowly toward him and Ross appeared to leisurely raise his machinegun. Steve felt remorse, not for his own lost life, but for not being able to see Peter grow up or truly grow into the budding relationship between him and Tony or seeing recognition finally dawn in Bucky’s eyes. He closed his eyes and prayed his death would be enough of a distraction that Tony and Peter would get away.
She joined him on the mats and he backed up to the opposite side of the mats. Everyone stopped whatever it was they were doing and strolled up to the mats to watch. Wade stayed sitting on his stack of mats and Clint took his perch on the mats stacked next to him. Bucky stood in Natasha’s corner, watching her with a smug grin and Peter's parents stood near him. They leaned into each other and smiled encouragingly at him when he looked to them.
Taken a back, Steve asked, “What do you mean?”
Two pots later, Steve was sipping on what he decided would be his final mug as the father tapped his chin and stared at Steve with assessing eyes.
“I brought lunch and Pepper told me she bought all of this from your favorite places,” Steve said, pointing to the disposable coffee cup sitting on the counter beside a takeout box of food.
Peter glanced up from under his lashes and saw Tony leaning toward him. His interest gave him the courage he needed and he replied, “It was alright…I…I like my coffee black and Steve had said you do too.”
Ever since they held hands at breakfast, he found himself reaching out to her more. They’d hold hands walking down the street, driving in the car, or eating together. They’d lean into each other’s sides whenever next to each other. And whenever she caught him staring at her, she’d smile and he was beginning to smile in return.
Howard’s hand twitched in Tony’s grip and he unhappily let go of his son’s hand.
“No, but I am placing the tower on lockdown and informing the rest of the Avengers. The projectile entered the room you and Master Roger currently occupy. From what I can deem from my sensors and video feed, it was a single bullet.”
On the day of, Tony helped him dress into his formal Captain’s uniform, gifted to him by the Army years prior. Steve’s fingers shook as he tried to button his sleeve. Tony gently placed his hands over Steve’s and carefully buttoned the corner of his sleeve for him. Tony patted down the cloth around the button and then raised his hands to pat down Steve’s chest.
Tony nodded and murmured, “Then, I guess this is goodbye until…”
Coulson looked over the names with a pinched brow and then demanded, “How did you get these names?? These are government agents whose names are –.”
“Tony
Tony shook his head and unconsciously stepped closer to Steve, murmuring, “No, it was my fault. I initiated it.”
Tony turned on the coffee machine and asked Steve, “What are you going to do about the cyborg on the couch?”
Steve realized his hand still rested in Tony’s hair and then drew away. Tony moved with him, trying to keep Steve’s touch with him a little longer. He stared at Steve with large, shocked, and disbelieving eyes and appeared completely captivated by him. His words were definitely having an impact.
Tony turned back to the fight on the ground and saw Steve struggling under mountains of sand and fighting just to breathe. Tony blasted to his super soldier without another thought.
Steve embraced Tony a little tighter. Tony lay his cheek against Steve chest and stared up at him tenderly. Tony’s hair was mussed from Steve’s attentions and his lips were swollen red from his countless kisses. His face was serene and relaxed like he had never seen before. Even working on his machines, Tony never looked this content. It made Steve feel special.
They went down the stairs, side-by-side, and Peter said, “She’s my
“I can handle it,” Wade pressed, grasping Peter’s hands.
“Thank you,” Steve replied smugly, wrapping his arm around Tony's shoulders.
“A fractured soulmate pairing would be worse press than if you didn’t turn up at all,” Pepper said, nodding to Coulson in thanks.
The description of my overall series is simply "Building a Superfamily is never easy..." which I take to heart in my writing. I know some of you are upset but I did not want to write a "and then they feel in love and lived happily ever after fic." There are bumps in every relationship and Steve and Tony are going to go over a big one. I wanted to not just explore my writing but,mostly, I wanted explore the person Steve Rogers.
“Seriously?” Steve gasped.
She turned back to James and drew her blankets over him. She tucked him in, parted his hair, and then just watched him for a few minutes, letting herself finally pause to marvel at his existence. She sat down on the bed beside him and continuously ran her fingers through his hair. It was dirty as they hadn’t let him bathe when he was in his cell so she groomed him the best she could with her fingers.
The Iron Man suit was exactly where he had left it last night. Jarvis was in sentry mode and had merely turned on all its stealth capabilities when Bucky had entered the room, but, with Tony’s inquiry, it reappeared and both Steve and Bucky jumped.
“And where will you be leading me, Cinderella?” Wade asked, his mouth never breaking free from its smile.
He could have sworn he saw hurt and conflict in Steve’s for a moment but it all disappeared in a blink and Steve roughly whispered, “As long as you’re in my arms and you’re happy…then I’m happy.”
Instead, Natasha pushed herself away from the table and spun on her heel, leaving the room in a quick gait. As soon as she left the room Bucky slowly stood and stared at the door she exited.
Tony mostly attributed it to missing Steve, but he assumed part of it was also but to the effect of tight bandages around his chest. Tony had only been able to give himself rudimentary sponge baths underneath his sleeping bag to muffle the light of his arc reactor. His skin was sensitive around his reactor and he could still kinda see those odd lines around it. He couldn’t get a good look at it without leaving his sleeping bag because then his reactor would illuminate his tent with its blue light and everyone in the vicinity would know something peculiar was happening within it.
Wade texted back: ‘At least tell me what kind of pet names they use.’
“Would you like me to list out everything Pepper disallowed from your birthday party?” Tony asked, his voice strained and his eyes worried.
“She…If she's a good girl, she wouldn't mind…” He managed to reply despite the conflicting emotions growing within him.
Tony looked back up to the Captain and peered at the relaxed face. When he wakes, the world was going to change with the reemergence of the super soldier.
“And he’s four-years-old,” Steve reminded him.
to his father, especially on the topic of their relationship. It was still fragile and Peter knew how much Tony treasured it…
Natasha sighed heavily and her heart went out to Stark. She read the personal accounts of the Howling Commandos and they attested for the Captain’s stubbornness when he set his mind to it. Poor Stark bad a fight ahead of him.
Tony's shoulders seemed to sink more with Steve's silence.
He paused in front of the door for a moment and paused to toughen his resolve then went through the walkway.
“If you don’t think I’m not going to marry you after everything we’ve been through then you –,” Tony began but Steve cut him off, seemingly unable to hold back the exuberant kiss he needed to give Tony.
He groaned and collapsed as a fresh wave of pain rushed through his body. Tony’s head snapped up and he hovered worriedly over Steve. He lightly pushed Steve back into the bed and gasped, “
Steve closed his eyes and imagined him and Tony as old men, leaning into each other and sharing mutual smiles as they watched young versions of Peter running around.
Steve smiled brightly at him and said, “You didn’t wake.”
Bucky sat back down and Tony went to his side and popped the arm in. He designed it to disconnect and reconnect easily. It’d make it easier for Tony to update or repair. It locked in automatically and Tony watched the process with a proud smile. Bucky was able to move the arm in seconds. He tested the joints and fingers by moving them around in front of him.
Because his heart latched on to loving Tony and was unwilling to let go no matter what Steve’s brain argued.
Steve bit back a smile. Okay, he was with Tony on this one. Their foe looked absolutely ridiculous.
“No,” Steve whispered. “I-I just have never seen it apart from your armor.” He reached up and ran his fingertips along the rim. The arch reactor pulsated beneath his touch.
With his eyes still half open, Tony considered his soulmate’s words and the fear he usually felt did not come. He rolled it over in his mind and then lightly caressed his fingertips over Steve’s back in a few strokes as he considered his words.
Wade laughed and grabbed Peter to roll him over onto his mattress. Peter gaily laughed and landed with a huge smile that threatened to split his face. His eyes sparkled with that emotion Wade wasn’t ready to label and he smiled back, pouring all of his love and devotion into it.
"Yeah, didn't go exactly as planned but I am persistent when it comes to my girl," Bucky replied with a happy, warm voice. "Can you come pick us up? We're at that Hydra Base in France and the room to the time machine is sealed up tight."
He was relieved Peter was gone but…at the same time, he wanted to badly wanted to hold his child, after all this pain and suffering, he had been gone for weeks without his boy and he missed him desperately. Was it too much to ask for a single minute of peace?
Peter nodded, staring peculiarly at Wade as he let him maneuver him into the house.
It all had been a figment of his imagination.
“I say, let him try and ‘woo’ you and if you like it, go for it,” Bucky stated. “Tony’s a smart guy and he knows more than he’s letting on. I bet he’s got an eye on all the major historical events that are going on right now. He won’t let them change. I trust him.”
Peter dragged Harry over to the workstation and picked up one of his bobbles to show his friend. The particular piece Peter picked up lit up whenever he flicked a switch. Peter excitedly explained to Harry what it did.
“Whatever you want, baby boy,” Wade murmured.
“Vlad…Yuri…Oleg….Kostya—.”
Tony sighed heavily and said, “Jarvis, you might as well call back that cleaning crew. Looks like they have another mess to clean…Plus order us a new fridge…and microwave…in fact, get a hold of my contractor, the entire kitchen needs a remodeling…”
Steve and Tony had successfully kept Peter’s identity a secret. Whenever the media referred to their boy they used the grainy cell phone pictures taken of him as a pudgy toddler. But as a skinny 6-soon to be 7-year-old child, Peter looked like he could have been anyone’s son.
“Pepper, what’s going on??” Steve demanded.
“I’ll gladly assist,” Fury added. “Parker, where’s your ball and chain?”
“I just don't want you two to get discovered,” Bucky muttered. His gaze flickered over to Steve and he asked, “Feeling lonely?”
“No, it’s ours,” Steve said.
Ever since he shut down the weapons' sector in Stark Industries, this reactor had been his dream and now it was
Steve looked around them, searching for an escape or a way to fight back.
Tony’s brows rose to his hairline and he gasped, “Y-You –.”
“Dad?” Peter’s voice was hoarse and he sounded unsure as if he doubted Tony was real.
Tony knew little of Spider-Man. He was a vigilante who handled mostly small crime. Whenever the Avengers were saving the world other than in New York, (yes, Tony could admit the world did not revolve around New York) Spider-Man went head-to-head with the big villains. His first one had been a Lizard man, Tony only remembered that because Dr. Connors had been a colleague and he had been horrified by what happened to him. More recently he had fought with Electro, who had put Jarvis offline for over an hour and scared Tony to death. He had feared the AI received permanent damage but, luckily, the fail-safes worked and Jarvis had been fine.
“Yes! Let’s go save Petey!” The stranger held up his hand with a large looking clock face on it and hit it.
“Oh gosh,” Peter replied, pretending to be bashful and they both laughed.
The building was near invincible. The Avengers hunched over the blueprints and tried to figure out a way to get in without alerting Schmidt but were having little success.
“Only if you command it,” Bucky stated.
Peggy’s eyebrows rose a fraction and now she too glanced between the two of them curiously. She did not make any comment however and rolled up the map with a nod. Bucky and Monty walked over to Peggy as Steve went to Tony. Bucky looked between the two of them with a pinched brow.
Tony squared his shoulders and pompously crossed his arms across his chest. He stated, “It is a title I wear proudly.”
Tony’s eyes swept over the area until he saw the slight distortion in the air that was his suit. Had he heard it correctly?
Steve inhaled sharply and then looked back down at those lips. Open, ready, and willing. There was really no valid excuse for him not to do it so he took the plunge and separated the distance between them.
Venom took that moment to jump out at Wade with a screeching fury. It stayed connected to Peter by just one wrist and jerked him forward in its attack, wrenching Peter’s shoulder even more.
Peter knew this was going to happen one day.
Steve didn’t have to break the bars as Vision merely had to reach through and then pull Peter through like he was nothing more than a ghost.
“What’s the word?” Stepan asked.
Steve felt fidgety. He wanted to help – to do something –
Tony burst into the room and, after Iron Man’s steely gaze swept the room and did not see their son, he demanded, “
The Avengers and Guardians were teaming up to go to the surface and destroy a base that had been built by a would-be-invading group of aliens.
“Nah, just a place to sleep,” Tony replied. He was slowing down on eating so Steve grabbed his canteen and tossed it to Tony. Tony caught it with a grin and said, “Thanks.”
Or the fact that several people were now entering the property without invitation.
Alarmed concern flashed over Steve’s features and Peter wanted to cry in relief.
Tony raced across the room and to Steve’s side. His eyes fearfully took in the dark splotches and his eyes grew larger as he saw the big one on his back. He grabbed Steve’s hands and gasped, “Are you becoming one too? Are you going to turn into Venom??”
“And tell me, ‘
The last was posted by a famous Youtube personality that researched and gossiped about celebrities. The video was titled “Who is Peter Parker?” It was over twenty minutes long, an eternity in Youtube, but it already had over a million hits.
, Harry. I want to see her! My parents keep pushing back our meeting…If you got a chance to see your mom again, wouldn’t you take it?”
They arrive at the burger place, which is a total hole in the wall.  Steve stares at the window-papered door with marked skepticism.
“We’ll see you tomorrow. Be good tonight.”
Tony pulls Steve toward him and into a promisingly filthy kiss.
“Oh you poor dear, you’re a mess.  What have James and Steven done to you?”
Clint, Steve and Bucky look impressed.
It seems like the type of story that ought to remain private.  Especially when Sean points out that Tony was drunk at the time and a ‘total slut for it’.  For some reason, that’s what gets the biggest laugh.
Every day the internet explodes with pictures of the new man or woman (or both) on Tony’s arm.  Every day there are photos of parties and kegs and vodka fountains.  And like clockwork, every day for the first two weeks there are texts from Pepper and Rhodey asking Steve for help.  Asking him to intervene.  Then abruptly, without explanation, these texts stop.
. “Not long. This is all my fault.”
who is ultra-talented and super friendly and who gave me permission to post this here!  She sometimes does commissions and you can find more information on her Tumblr.  You can also see lots of great art there!  I totally recommend giving her a follow!
“That makes perfect sense,” Bruce says. “That must have been incredibly grating. And now, to get back to your question-- what I would do about you killing people is entirely dependant on who you’re killing. Which probably makes me a shitty person, but I don’t have the energy to go around defending assholes like Hydra, I just don’t.”
Tony nods.  “I don’t think you know what you’re in for, but sure I’ll give it a go.  Under one condition.”
“You won’t break me,” Steve says.  “You didn’t break Pepper.”
“Just be glad you aren’t getting Bucky’s hangover cure,” Sam says. “That’s a big glass of orange juice with a raw egg mixed in. It’s wrong, man. So wrong.”
Clint shrugs.  “If you’ve got it, flaunt it.”
Tony’s holding a remote control and looking unimpressed.  Bruce walks over to him, takes the remote control, and pats him on the back.
“I want you to see,” Tony says.  “Before-- before you just let this go.  I want you to see the pictures and I want to explain.”
Bucky bumps Clint with his shoulder.  “I didn’t
my friend.  Or I’d like you to be.  I guess whether you are or not is up to you.”
Steve flinches slightly at the comment because up until two weeks ago his nickname had been Captain America because he was so damn wholesome, and now he’s outed as gay and he punches
“What’s wrong?” Steve asks.
Content Warning: There is a one line reference to past child abuse.  It's within Tony's list of reasons he's visited the burger place for comfort food.
Clint repeats his words in German then in Russian, or at least that’s what Bruce thinks he’s catching from his limited knowledge of the languages. That seems to get James’s attention even if Bruce can still see the way James’s pulse is throbbing in his throat.
“It was actually,” Tony says.  “Can’t really tell you what the rant was about since the Judgement Free Zone takes place within the Circle of Secrets, but I promise, it was epic.”
“I’m on to you, Banner. What to do you think, James? Is he bluffing?”
“Delinquent,” Tony says.
“Come upstairs with me,” Tony prompts.  “I need your help, roomie.”
“They were having some mafia trouble when we started coming here,” Steve says.  “Some punks in tracksuits trying to extort money off of the elderly owners.  Natasha and Clint took care of it.  Now it’s Free Fry Fridays.”
Bruce may be frozen, but James is not.  Somehow, despite his injuries and the blood and the pain, James shifts into a crouch, with the knife held in one hand.  If Bruce didn’t know him, he wouldn’t recognize James as the same person.  James’s eyes no longer belong to their quiet companion from the last few days.  They belong to a predator and they are trained with an ultra-focused malice on Bruce and Clint.
“You sure you’re a doctor?” James asks, as he takes the brick.
Once Tony’s standing on the sidewalk, Clint dusts him off with a series of sweeping thwacks up and down his chest and legs until Tony’s forced to shove him away.
“You might look past retirement age,” Clint points out.
“Damn straight,” Clint says.
“My awesome save?” Steve guesses.
Only this time, the sound doesn’t come from the table.  It comes from the kitchen.  All eyes turn in that direction, where Bucky stands next to a frying pan not looking the least bit sorry.  His hair is pulled back in a messy bun, and a few strands have come loose and hang in front of his eyes.   If anyone thinks he looks a little silly in his My Heart Belongs to Hawkeye shirt, no one’s going to say.
“In that case, let’s go.”
This isn’t how the leader of the team is supposed to act. He can’t make himself care.
“Can’t you hire more security?” Steve asks.  “Or I’m sure SHIELD could spare--”
“Sorry. You’ve got a little...” Tony makes a wavy gesture in front of Steve’s face, and Steve remembers the goop on Tony’s forehead. Which is now on his own.
“What about you, Steve?” James asks. “Cat got your tongue?”
“S’good,” James says, once they’re walking down the path that will lead to a road that will lead to the address Tony has texted. “Everything else causes a malfunction.”
“Gladly, Captain.”
“Come on’ Cap.  I know a back way out.  We can avoid the press.”
Tony can think of way worse ways to spend an evening.  All of them end with him alone.
He would never leave Rhodey to that fate.  It’s not even a question.
“Captain America out!” Tony shouts, holding up a peace sign.
“JARVIS?  Can he hear me?”
Tony nods against him.  “They were worried.  I tried to buy The New York Post.  It was a thing...”
“Shit,” Tony swears. Now it’s his turn to be the cuddly one. He turns in and presses kisses to Steve’s shoulder. “I’m sorry I’m a jealous asshole. I’m sorry you had to cut talking to that kid short when you noticed I was missing. I’m sorry I--”
It doesn’t matter.  Tony can hide it.  His coat covers all evidence of his discomfort and his voice miraculously doesn’t weirdly pitch as they step into the elevator and Tony instructs Jarvis to take them up to his office.
“I wish I’d talked to you after the whole New York thing,” Clint sighs.  “They made me see a SHIELD therapist.  He was... not real helpful.”
“You can call it SAD,” Steve says, sounding fond.  “We all do.  When I left the army I didn’t really know what to do with myself, so Bucky and Clint let me stay on their couch.  They introduced me to Sam, who was looking for a roommate and since all three of them worked together at SI it just made sense for me to try and get a job there, too.”
At least there’s that.
Tony tilts his head forward so his forehead is resting against Steve’s.  “I don’t want to fuck this up.  I do that a lot.  Too much.”
“Yeah. Well, not now obviously. Just when I was a kid.”
“Hey Bruce?” Tony asks, stopping Bruce as he’s walking away.  “Missed you, buddy.”
Tony walks further into the living room and pulls out his phone.  He taps on it a few times shakily and the lights brighten.  Jarvis’s voice fills the apartment.
Steve feels shivers run down his spine.
“That’s disappointing,” Tony admits.  “Scandal is my favorite.”
The copter is closing in.  So are the fleas.
questions about the contents of your go bag and whatever is pushing out that edge up near the zipper-- did you pack the actual kitchen sink in there?”
The spy twins turn their eyes on him.  Apparently it’s a suspicious opinion, judging by their matching expressions of disbelief.
“Order it all,” Steve says. “I’m paying today.”
“Just take care of Tony for me,” Rhodey says. “I got the rest.”
Steve smiles.  “Something like that,” he says fondly.  “Anyway, the two of you can naked science to your heart’s content if I’m ever around.  I won’t be scandalized.”
James’s eyes go straight to Clint’s sling. “Did I do that? Did I hurt you?”
“My father cheated on my mother a few times while I was growing up,” Pepper continues.  “He wasn’t discreet and I watched what that did to her.  What it did to them.  How much she hated him by the time they divorced.  I couldn’t do that to us; it wasn’t healthy.  I was going to lose him forever if I stayed.”
“When you were captured and...” Bruce fumbles for a word. “And programmed, they could have altered your brain. They could have done something that caused a malfunction that-- that robbed you of your ability to be you. And seeing Steve could have been a trigger that shifted part of your natural state back into place. So in that scenario, what’s going on-- it might not be a new malfunction so much as a
True to their word, Clint and Natasha never mind when Steve brings Tony around. They have a regular booth in the diner now. Steve and Tony take one side, while Bruce, Clint and Natasha smush into the other.
“Pepper?” Tony asks.
“I killed your parents,” James says.
“But I probably will for a while,” Steve says.
After all the kind and gentle therapists they’ve dealt with lately, this is a big change.  Steve approves.  He glances at Tony.
“Sorry... that was an infodump you didn’t ask for...”
?” Sam asks.
“Oh, sorry.  Didn’t even realized I’d picked that one out,” Steve says, reaching to take it away. “Not exactly fashionable, huh?”
“Oh, you mean you took your eyes off Prince Charming long enough to miss me?” Tony asks, with false cheerfulness. “I didn’t expect you back until after breakfast.”
Someone (probably Natasha) had left a fresh glass of water and a bottle of pain pills on the nightstand. Bruce hands two to Clint, who takes them immediately.
“You hang out with the science bros long enough you get to do all sorts fun stuff,” Clint agrees. “Plus, they’re great to have around when things breaks. Tony can hook up a DVR like a boss.”
“Take your time,” Steve tells him.  The car starts to roll forward and away from the scene and Steve places a hand on Tony’s back consolingly.  “You okay?”
“I know it’s not as soft as mine yet, but sleep under it every night, and play on it every day and remember I made it with all my love.  Just for you.”
Tony tries again, patiently. “I feel like you should acknowledge that I haven’t been the most likable guy in the world lately. It would be good for you.”
He hadn't known.  He’d just... gotten it right all on his own.
There’s an easiness in the way he agrees that’s maybe a good sign, but he also sounds tired. More tired than he’d been the morning before. Panic attacks could do that though, and James had had a significant one the previous night. That could be it.
“You wanna come with us and find out?” Tony asks.
He gives Clint an ‘I hate this” look then walks out onto the porch alone.
“Unlike you yahoos, I’m not wastin’ food.  Eggs are for eating.  You want one, doll?”
“Oh, I approve fine,” he says.  “But someone has to be the judge and I’m the only one who won’t cheat.”
“Nothing,” Bruce says. “I was wrong.”
They have done lots of this slow-paced affectionate touching.  It feels different, somehow, out in the real world.  At the clinic, sex was not something that was going to happen.  There were security cameras in the bedroom, and while they’d been assured they did not transmit sound (Tony had done a little poking around to make absolutely sure that was true) they were still being broadcasting via visual feed to the front desk.
What Bruce does know is that fussing over James like a child is infantilizing, so he’s just going to chill the fuck out and give him some space. James can fly a jet; he can figure out water knobs and a bathtub stopper.
+100 x 8 or 9 (I’ve lost track) to Tony for Getting Steve Laid. Over and over. So much sex, seriously guys, you don’t even know.
Tony takes the cell and hold it to his ear.
“I’ll do better than credit,” Steve says.  “Five hundred points for surviving long enough to meet me.”
“Prince Charming?” Steve asks. “I’m old enough to be that kid’s great-grandfather. In another life I could have
After SHIELD falls, Bruce manages to go a month and a half without trouble. He ends up in the Alps on a whim, with no real thoughts on a destination apart from Shit Shit Shit Run. Maybe it was watching
Sam pats Steve on the shoulder as he walks past.  “We’re going to need all the help we can get.”
“Are you okay with it?” Steve asks.
I'm sorry this fic took me a while to finish! I loved it too much to ruin it, and nothing I wrote did it justice for the longest time. But I think (and hope!) that I got it right in the end.
“He turns into a total bag of dicks any time you’re in the room,” Clint says.  “I like him fine when we’re alone.  I can’t stand him when he’s within a hundred feet of you.  Or Nat.”
Tony’s shoulders tremble.  He’s crying.  Steve tugs the door shut behind him to protect Tony’s privacy.  There’s a crowd gathering.
Tony leans in for another kiss.  When he pulls back he looks at Steve seriously  “Let me take you out to dinner,” he says.
Steve and Tony have smoothies for breakfast.  They don’t speak more than a few words to each other as Tony packs.  When it’s time to go, they take a hidden elevator down to Tony’s private garage.  There are two dozen gorgeous cars waiting, in every color of the rainbow.
“Where’s Steve?” James asks.
Natasha and Clint are in the same room to recover, which makes it far easier to pile in and fuss over them.  They’re both groggy, but happy to see their friends.  Bruce kisses Natasha on the forehead then takes a seat on Clint’s bed.  Steve mirrors that exactly, greeting Nat and then moving to check on Clint.  He can see from the way she’s looking at Tony that she wants a moment of privacy with him.
The officer nods.  “I’ve got to see him all the way to the door but after that, he’s all yours.”
The rest of the guys walk out with Rumlow and Steve gets in the elevator for the ride up to Fury’s office.  He should not be surprised when music suddenly swells from the speakers right at the most rousing part of the chorus to The Star Spangled Man With a Plan.
“I’ll see what I can do,” Tony agrees.
“I want to see him,” Steve says helplessly.
“I’d like to think so,” Steve says.   “Or I guess I thought so.”
“I’m not worried about it,” Steve says.
“That’s debatable and irrelevant,” Tony assures him.
“Steve would die for you whether you’re you, Bucky Barnes or some guy he met 5 minutes ago on the street. That’s just how he is. Avoiding him won’t change that.”
Tony’s not concerned about the early hour.  It’s pretty common knowledge Tony rarely leaves the building.  It’s just people might want to talk to him and Pepper’s made him swear on every car in his garage that he will not have any new sexual harassment complaints aimed at him this year.  And he very much likes those cars.  Also (and he gets defensive here, even if it’s just in his own head) those complaints aren’t usually his fault.  Obadiah had been in charge of hiring for a long time, and a lot of those asshole hires were still around, and either corporate spies or lawsuits waiting to happen.  Combine that with Tony’s less-than-stellar reputation, and voila!  Trouble.
Bruce laughs on the other end of the line.  “You’re incorrigible.”
On screen, Steve stands and gently picks Tony up to shift him down the couch.  He grabs the pillow.  Goes for the terrible, itchy, blanket  (that one of the designers had picked out and Tony hadn’t gotten around to throwing away yet) and stops himself.  JARVIS offers to lead Steve to better blankets.
She does a waggle with her finger and the audience roars with laughter.  Even the hosts can’t keep their composure.
“SHIELD was HYDRA in sheep's clothing,” Bruce says, unhappily.  “And I think that explains a lot about some of the medical ethics I witnessed there first hand.”
“Sounds like motivation to me.  And if nothing else, Nanna’s got cookies.”
“He was gonna die for me on that helicarrier,” James says. “Do you have any idea how confusing that was?  I just spent 70 years of no one giving one single fuck about my life except that I was useful, I guess.  Then that punk shows up, I’m tryin’ to kill him, and he wouldn’t fight me. He didn’t want to hurt me. It was like-- like a broken piece of code. It caused an error. Once the error started I couldn’t make it stop.”
