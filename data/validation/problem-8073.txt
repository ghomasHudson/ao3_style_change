Steve sighs happily, and wraps his arms around Tony. His mouth doesn’t say anything, but his brain’s stuck thinking lovesick thoughts about how well the brunette fist up against him, and how very like a puzzle he feels, having found its missing piece.
Somehow, when Steve tells him he's got another date with Tony, he
“you’re beautiful.” He mutters softly, positioning himself in the upside down V of Tony’s legs, and dragging heavy hands over his shoulders, down his spine, to settle on his hips finally, holding him still. He sinks into Tony slowly, in one long thrust that seems to last the span of a lifetime. It feels… like every thing he remembered, and everything he didn’t realize he’d forgot all at once. He groans lowly, and reaches under Tony, to lay a hand over his stomach gently. His fingers find the thick keloid surgery scar, and he whines softly. “ I love you. So much.”
has the guy called him anything other than Tony or Stark. Unless it’s an insult. And the only other people who call him Tone – or Tones, depending on the situation – are Rhodey and Pepper. He also catches the accent, manages to moan out a curse and then a, “Hot,” before he’s kissing Steve again, far more desperate and passionate than before. He doubts that he’ll be able to come without a hand around his cock, but he can feel the tightness in his abdomen growing nonetheless. It’s only once he’s broken away from Steve for air that he realizes Steve asked him a question – sort of, given that it was more of an order – and his mind catches up to everything else.
“I love you.” There’s a beat of silence between them, and Steve feels a blush start to creep up his neck and cheeks. “I’m in love with you, Tony. have been for a while and… I get if you don’t feel the same bu—” Tony has to lean so far out of the wheelchair to reach Steve, that he nearly falls over. The angle is off, and neither of them have shaved in days, so their stubble is scraping together something awful, but it’s somehow the single most perfect kiss that either of them have ever had. Steve pulls away, dazed, and Tony smiles gently, a soft and timid thing that’s far too embarrassed to be anything but genuine.
Steve shoots Bucky a look and he puts the gun down, finally, though his eyes are still much more than stormy. At least he isn’t planning on shooting anyone, right now. Steve sighs, and resists the urge to grovel at Tony’s feet. He said he’d find a way, so he has to trust that. Even if his instincts are telling him that it’s just a polite way to give him the brush off.
Steve feels immense guilt for the crises that Rhodey’s going through right now, because if they’d just told him in the first place… no. no, that can’t be how he thinks, because that was a decision they made together, over several long conversations, throughout the entire pregnancy.
“Thanks, Nat.” he smirks, and points to a smudge on the polished wood, where his forehead had just been. “missed a spot.”
“I – I have a friend who’s ran into you when you were, uh, doing mob things,” and it’s not entirely a lie. Jessica did run into Barnes before, though it was planned, a way to divert attention. And Tony orchestrated the switches and the drop-offs from the safehouse with Pepper, led a few of Barnes’ guys right to where Rhodey and the cops lay in wait. Oh, he’s so dead.
“I wasn’t.” Rhodey scoffs.
Clints first thought is slicing through his consciousness, before he has a chance to rein it in, ugly, and bitter, and beneath him. You had that. But that ship has sailed, and sunk, and sailed a few times more, so the sniper closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and lets it out slow enough that Tony probably can’t hear it. Probably isn’t listening for it, anyway. “Hi to you too, Tony, I’m doing great.” he pauses for a second and smirks, to himself. “Shoulda gone home, when you had the chance.”
“Don’t lie.”
It works if you work it, and you die if you don't, so work it, 'cause you're worth it.
Tony can hear the ambulance pull up outside, hangs up on the dispatcher and moves over to place a gentle hand on Steve's shoulder. Part of him trusts Steve to not give into Bucky's requests, to be stronger than that, but Tony's thought that about himself before and caved when it came to helping Jessica. "Steve, honey, go bring the paramedics up, okay? You know more about what's happening to him that I do, and you'll be able to help explain it better. I'll stay here with him, make sure nothing happens. Leave him for ten seconds to go help the paramedics, okay?" Bucky makes a wounded sound where he's lying. "I don't need the hospital, Stevie," he repeats, though everything about his demeanor points to the opposite being true. "It's in the Hunt's territory, baby, you know what'll happen if they find out I'm there." "I have favours I can call in," Tony says immediately. He doesn't particularly want to out his relationship to Pepper, knows that it's a one-way trip to being suspected of being the mole, and maybe he won't even make it back to check that Bucky makes it through. But he knows that losing Bucky would kill Steve, and he can't have that. Can't stand the thought. "Friends in high places. They'll make sure you're protected, Bucky."
Steve sniffs quietly, turning to look at the intruder on his moment, as soon as he’s aware of the sound of another human being moving. The guy got much closer than he typically would have, but Steve’s… he hates to say grieving, because Tony will come back, he’s confident that he will, but… he just looks so damn
“Right, so if he ain’t your husband, why you mopin’?” Steve opens his mouth to argue, and Bucky flicks Steve’s chest right in the middle, where the heavy gold titanium alloy ring sits. “and why you carryin’ that thing around, and havin’ the audacity to think I won’t notice, huh?” Steve sighs heavily, and his posture goes lax, all at once, as every bit of his fight is sapped out of him.
Bucky moves, takes half a step back and brings his hands to cup Steve's face, make him look him in the eyes instead of hiding his face against his shoulder. "I don't want you to stop seeing him if that'd make you unhappy," he says, because he's willing to learn how to adapt and cope if it means Steve's happy. There's also a bitter little voice in the back of his head, telling him that Steve and Tony can't possibly have learned that much about each other in a night, that there could always be a deal-breaker for one of them. He doesn't fully trust Tony, and it's not just because Steve's apparently falling in love with him.
wishes it was the drugs. It's not that he doesn't want Steve to see Tony he does, he wants whatever the hell's gonna help his Stevie, but he doesn't exactly trust the kid that fell out of existence for three solid weeks, and suddenly pops back up. He agrees to cover for Steve tonight, because he knows his husband is head over heels, but he doesn't have to be
Tony tells dispatch what Steve shouts to him, resists the urge to roll his eyes when the lady on the line tells him that not panicking is key here. She asks him to stay on the line until EMS arrive, informs him that the nearest on-patrol ambulance is only one minute away, and Tony wonders which god is watching over them tonight. The bad news is she’s giving him more information, maybe hoping to calm him down while Steve works to kickstart Bucky’s breathing again, and the ambulance headed for them is one from the Hunt’s territory. He knows, logically, that the nearest hospital is in Pepper’s terf, and that she might try to murder both Steve and Bucky if she figures out who they are, but he also knows he can’t really let that happen. “Steve, nearest hospital’s sided with the Hunt,” he says, hand over the receiver so the lady can’t overhear him. He watches Bucky’s chest, waits for a rise, doesn’t get one. “Forty-two seconds until EMS arrive,” he mutters, glancing over to the clock again.
Steve shucks down to just boxers without thinking about it and rubs at his eyes with both hands. He throws the covers back with absolutely no flourish, and smiles at Tony nervously. It's the first time that they'll share a bed together in a way that's as innocent as it is. It's almost enough to cause him nerves. It feels… significant in a way he can't quite label or quantify. Standing beside the bed all night isn't really an option either though, so he carefully gets into bed, reaches for his phone on the nightstand and sends Bucky a text, telling him that he and Tony are sleeping here. He adds a gentle request asking him to come back, but it sounds pathetic, so he deletes it before deciding the text sounds too clinical and adding a simple 'i miss you.’ he sighs and plugs the phone in before turning the light off and rolling over to look at Tony. In the still and the quiet darkness, everything between them feels heavier. He squirms for a minute before finally looking into honey-brown eyes and sighing quietly. “There's one other thing I didn't tell you that I should've.”
“Who I am, isn’t really important. What’s important, big guy, is that I have information you want.” He walks closer to Tony’s bed, and Steve feels something not unlike hackles start to raise on the back of his neck. The newcomer must sense this though, because he sits down in one of the abandoned chairs, and focuses up at Steve. From this distance, Steve can tell that he’s either an active alcoholic, or very recently recovering from addiction. He’s not sure if that makes him feel more or less sympathetic to him. maybe neither. The newcomer clears his throat again, and points to tony, like he’s not the most important person in the room . (not that Steve’s admitting to anything. He’s not.) “Einstein-Rosen bridges. You’ve heard of them, yes? Jane Foster, Thor’s main squeeze?”
He knows, before he’s in earshot of the hut, that Bucky’s awake. He always is. He likes to pretend that the nightmares aren’t still plaguing him, but Steve knows the exhausted set of his eyes, and the furrow in his brow. Hell, he sees it on himself every morning, after all.
There's no denying that Steve has a point. Even if he was capable of arguing, Tony couldn't argue with that. If they try to do this too quickly, Tony's just going to end up sore and bruised for all the wrong reasons and, really, he's been switching between a constant ache and a constant emptiness for the past few months enough to know that he doesn't want to put himself through any more pain than he has to. For a single second, he hates biology, the fact that he has to go through this again only months after almost dying on the operating table. He hates it. But he doesn't hate Steve. And it's important to make that distinction there.
is this a healthy poly relationship? not really. do i condone this type of poly? of course not. does it work out for them, in this specific instance? it's stuckony.
Bucky’s hold on the grip of the gun tightens, and his eyes narrow dangerously. “Thanks for caring enough to share. I promise I’ll weigh that carefully.” His voice is low and just an octave above ‘murderous’. Steve stands up, sliding into his pyjama pants from before, and steps between Bucky and Tony. A bold move, considering how pissed Bucky is, but he’s pretty sure his husband wouldn’t shoot him. relatively. Like. 65% sure. Steve reaches for Tony’s hands, and holds them gently, looking up into his eyes with a painful earnesty.
Tony looks at Steve for all of a single heartbeat, considering what he’s saying. If he’s gotten any impression off of Bucky in the past couple of encounters, it’s that he’s willing and ready to murder anyone who so much as attempts to hurt Steve, and being in a relationship with him would certainly leave a lot of room for risking hurt. Tony’s not exactly looking forward to the shovel talk he’s no doubt going to receive—that’s if Bucky doesn’t skip the ‘talk’ and go straight for ‘shovel’—but he knows he can be careful and considerate if it means not hurting Steve. He knows he can manage to not fuck this up. “If a hacker doesn’t want to be found,” he says slowly, “you’re not going to find them. The Hunt was compromised a few months back, and we’re all off the grid at all times, save for any field operatives. I didn’t…Steve, no matter how hard you looked for me, you wouldn’t have found me, alright? That’s got nothing to do with you. So, I do have to apologize.” He pauses, then, “But we can talk about it more in the morning. You need sleep, honey, and I’m not going anywhere.”
She looks regular enough, in a plain white T shirt, black jeans hugging her hips. She’s faced away from him right now, staring through the window of what appears to be an operating theatre. She doesn’t say anything immediately, just continues to stare, like some part of her is missing, and she curls further into her self, wrapping her arms around her body, tight. Tony’s just to the point of asking her if she’s ok, when she turns to him, with a quiet sniffle.
They spend another five minutes solid looking for a way to get Tony out of the suit, and Steve merely rolls his eyes, and steps closer, touching the tiniest indentation at the back of the neck, where sure enough, plates start losing their cohesion, and falling off, into a brilliant, gold and hot rod red mess on the ground. Steve’s not prepared for seeing Tony’s face. He’s seen him injured before, of course, they’ve been on the same team for years, and Tony’s mind never stops, so there was more than once, more than a hundred times, likely, that he got hurt in his workshop, but this is… different.
. Co-captain of the avengers” The nurse-- Famike he can see her nametag now-- seems nearly shocked at that. Her cheeks go a pretty rose pink, and she shuffles through the paperwork that’s on the clipboard in her hands, semi desperately like he’s searching for any lifeline there is.
Steve raises an eyebrow, but nods, confused as to what this stranger could possibly mean. “yeah. I’ve heard of them, it’s some real science fiction stuff.” He answers offhandedly, folding his arms back over himself in a defensive movement. “what about them?” Second Tony nods, and speaks, looking at a spot in the middle of the actual Tony’s blanket, rather than to Steve himself.
, to refer to Tony that way, but he’s a little more than heartbroken that he’s staring at the Hunt, in his own fucking territory. In the
Tony’s in a bed, in front of him. A hospital bed, by the looks of it, and he’s curled around a telltale bump. Steve takes a step closer, not sure what the fuck he’s meant to do, and dream Tony whines softly.
Steve nods, and rests his forehead against Bucky's, finally feeling like he can breathe, now that Bucky isn't asking for a divorce, or demanding Steve grovel for forgiveness, not that it’s any less than he’d deserve. “Yeah. He's seen some shit. He's got a few nasty scars too, at least one that looks like an old GSW.” He shrugs, and sighs gently. “I've never…” he pauses, searching for the right words, and failing to find them. “Buck, I've never felt a connection with anyone else like that, except you. It's…” he cuts himself off with a frustrated noise at not being able to express himself right. “How many times you ever seen me get emotional during sex? How many times you ever seen me cry during?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Steve?" Tony asks, voice quiet, and he waits for the 'hm?' of acknowledgement from Steve before he murmurs a quiet, "For once in your life, shut up." It happens too fast for him to think about any possible repercussions, him leaning forward and kissing Steve. It's soft and gentle and quickly evolves into something that's anything but.
“Did I mention, get the fuck outta my bar?” Clint laughs, nods his head in slight deference.
“You’re absolutely, fucking with me.” Clint laughs, and it’s something startled out of him, something much less guarded than he wants for it to be.
“just goes to show you, jerk, I’m not trying to prove anything, and ‘m not overheating.” Bucky looks up at him lazily, from where he’s leaning up against the wall, staring out at the beautiful sunrise.
"You could... We could meet somewhere else. We couldn't really stay long, without someone noticing, but... It could be something." He falls completely silent, holding his breath in anticipation. It feels like his entire life is hanging in the balance, and he can't breathe. It all comes down to this knee moment, the will he, won't he.
Tony shifts slightly where he's waiting on the couch of the summer house, watching the TV without really watching it. Pre-heat kicked in early this morning, and the cramps only stopped an hour or so ago, which means that Tony can feel the beginnings of slick between this thighs. He's beginning to wonder whether or not this was a bad idea.
“It’s Christmas eve, and what does that have to do with anything, Tony, I’m on duty.” Steve offers with a smile.
Steve groans longsufferingly and punches Bucky in the shoulder, albeit adoringly. “C’mon, when you say it like that, I sound like a total pansy.” Although, to be fair, he is kind of a pansy, at this point. He sighs and runs a hand through his hair, trying to find a way to sum up the feeling in a way that makes any kind of sense.
Steve means to say something, means to offer tony reassurance, or tell him he missed him too (he did, oh god, he did) but he isn’t prepared to have a hundred and eighty pounds of solid nervous energy flung directly into the center of his chest, and he’s definitely not expecting the sweet smoky scent of heat, not this strong, and not this early. He growls, low in his chest, and some part of his brain that’s functioning more on baser instinct and what feels good, rather than actual logical thought, moves quickly, catching Tony’s slight weight (god, it’s so slight, has he always been this light? Is he eating enough?) and lifting him up into the air.
There’s nothing, but the sound of Steve’s breaths, haggard and harsh in the quiet antiseptic laced air around them, for several long moments. When he finally calms down enough, to speak, his voice is rough with raw emotion. “you… what?” Ed scoffs, andturns away, so similar to the way Tony is, when upset with himself.
He shouldn't be here. Not when he's in heat and Steve's in rut. Rhodey would call him crazy if he knew what he was doing -- as it is, Rhodey thinks he's taking some time to get his head straight. But it's too late to turn back now. He's told Steve the address, and that the front door is open, and now all there's left to do is wait. There's an uneasy feeling in his stomach, and his shoulders feel weighed down with the knowledge that he's going to have to tell Steve about the loss of their pup sooner or later, but to tell an alpha in rut something like that probably isn't the best idea. Lord knows Steve's going to be emotional enough as it is.
Steve whines softly, because Tony is absolutely right. There's not a damn thing they can do now, aside from wish that things had gone differently. Everything had gone down so quickly, in the blink of an eye damn near, and now they're just left in the wake of the destruction.  He sighs, and runs a hand through his hair, trying to collect what there is is left of his thoughts. It's a losing battle, as they're left just as scattered as ever.
“nothin’ escapes you, does it, genius.” Tony fixes him with a glare, and he smirks in response. “Yeah. It’s a crib. And over there…” he steps to the side, and points to the other half of the room, to a rocking chair, with a six foot two super soldier, and two tiny bundles. Tony gasps, and Bucky huffs out a quiet laugh. “yeah. You know them.” Tony moves to open the door and freezes at the last second, looking back to Bucky with obvious confusion writ over his face.
“Boss…” somehow, she manages to sound sympathetic. “it’s been an hour. You should get something to eat.” Huh. An hour. That’s… interesting. That doesn’t mesh with his mental clock at all. Still, an hour isn’t that much time, and he’s survived worse.
“about there. maybe… twenty stories, tops.”
Steve huffs out a quiet laugh, and it’s maybe not the healthiest thing in the world. “I uh. I thought you wouldn’t call.” He hates that he sounds so desperate already, that his voice is already cracking, but it’s like this one call has served to tear down all of his walls, and expose the soft squishy center of emotion that he tried so hard to cover with sweat, and self-sabotage.
This looks bad.
The heavy, awkward feeling from earlier in the kitchen is back, and Steve feels a fluttering in his stomach again, but this time, instead of terror, it feels a lot more like excitement. He moves to open his mouth, to find something to say, some excuse to make, or half-assed apology for not ‘fessing up sooner, but nothing that comes to mind sounds right. He makes a snap decision, and leans into Tony’s space, brushing the lightest of kisses against his lips.
Tony scrunches his nose up at that, because he's too caught up to put the thought into raising an eyebrow. "Gonna have to tie me down to stop me working, babe," he says, a smirk curving the corner of his lips. On the incredibly slim off-chance that he does wind up pregnant again, Tony knows he's going to need to give into the 'keep you in bed' part of what Steve's saying, because he has a funny feeling that a doctor would recommend excessive bedrest and minimal movement for the sake of the pup, and ensuring that Tony can carry as close to term as he can manage. Working, on the other hand...He could maybe give up Iron Man for nine months. Maybe. But he's still head of R&D at SI, which means a lot of paperwork.
Tony doesn’t miss the nickname, not by a long-shot. He could have been drunk off his ass and he still would have snapped to attention at that, because while kissing and reverent, concerned looks and more attention than necessary are one thing, nicknames are another entirely. He’s known Clint for seven years, and not
“I’m not shitting you. It’s getting serious. You know he got works through Davis, if the shit he’s pushing is bad--” shady kid nubmer two interrupts the first, eyes wild and searching the area around them.
Tony takes the opportunity to rub his neck the second Bucky's let go of him, though his heart's still pounding against his ribcage and he's not entirely sure that he isn't five seconds away from an anxiety attack. He watches as Clint takes his jacket off, reveals both his pistols, and takes them out one at a time, sets them on the sidetable by the door. It's not exactly surprising he doesn't want to put them on the table nearest Steve and Bucky, but it still makes him look like something of a threat, even if he does raise his hands again afterwards.
“Yeah, Stevie?” he asks, just as pleased as anything, lining the sights up with where Tony’s currently standing.
“It was like… remember how it felt, the first time we were together? When we were, what 15 and 17, how it felt like everything was falling apart around us, and it was new, and terrifying, and perfect too?” He's maybe being a little poetic but he remembers clearly, the world shaking apart as Bucky held him together, in solid arms. He squirms slightly, because it's almost uncomfortable, being this candid with his husband, of all people, who shouldn't have to hear him describe how life changing a one-night stand with someone else was, but if anyone stands a chance of understanding, it's him. “And it wasn't… it wasn't just how I felt either… there was something there, Buck, I know there was. I was shaking all over, after, and he just rolled us over and kisses me through it. Keep saying how I was ok, we were ok. I…” he stills, and shakes his head in disbelief. “It was more than sex for just a minute.” Bucky stares at Steve for a few seconds, then shakes his head slightly. He wants to relocate them to the bed, sit down and talk instead of standing by the doorway, but he's not entirely sure he wants to sit on the bed until the sheets have been washed. Being okay with Steve having a one night stand - if it can even still be called that - is one thing, but sitting down on the bed after it is another entirely.
shot me, and I'm pretty sure I'd still want to be with you," he says, and he ignores the slight scoff that earns from Clint over by the doorway. "Clint, call your contact and give them the codeword. We're fine here, okay? No one's in any danger, and I'm sure they need more help with the mission tonight. Just...give us some room to talk." Clint hesitates, glances from Bucky to where Steve and Tony are standing, and huffs out a breath.
"Also, for the record," he adds, turning properly so that he can rest his head against Steve's shoulder, and his words are nothing more than a mumble, "I like the accent. It's cute."
hey, heds up, in the next update, we're definitely gonna see some torture, and mayyybe an overdose, depending on how it breaks down. make sure you mind the tags! sorry this took forever to upload, i just strepthroat, got better from it, caught it again from my esposa, and then got in a car wreck, and caught a sinus infection. yay!

There’s something that’s akin to understanding washing over Rhodey’s face, and he pales, as he stares across the room at Steve. “Run. Steve, Run!” He doesn’t have to be told twice.
“It's been two hours. I got a little absorbed, sorry. One of my… colleagues. He's shit with numbers.” He smiles apologetically, and moves to get in the bed with Tony. He's still partially clothed, of course, but he isn't about to be insisting that they rush to round two that quickly. He's more than happy enough to lay here and cuddle, sharing lazy kisses. Maybe that's the herb talking, but Tony doesn't
“Get the fuck away from him.” The beta bites out, in no uncertain terms. Steve hates the pure disgust that he sees in Rhodey’s eyes. He hates the way his jaw and neck clench, already preparing himself to fight the alpha that caused this, whether it’s actually the truth, or not. Steve whines lowly, and shifts his weight, so he’s more in front of Tony. his breathing is still ragged and shallow, but it’s starting to even out. Steve had been so fucking close to having him out of the woods.
“Jesus christ Tony, what’d you take home a fuckin’ vampire?” he asks, when he gets a look at the bruises blooming dark and prominent, across the genius’s fair skin. Something possessive and dark lances up Clints spine, but mostly, it’s… it’s concern. Tony, little shit that he is, simply grins.
Tony’s just taken Dream Steve’s hand, is just getting ready to walk down the hall with him, when there’s a lurch feeling that stops him dead in his tracks. It’s something kind of like nausea, but with the added misery of butterflies and jitters all at once. He doesn’t make a conscious effort to let go of Dream Steve’s hand,  but the next that he’s aware, it’s gone. Dream Steve is talking to him, is saying something, but Tony can’t hear him anymore. His mouth is moving, but he’s suddenly fuzzy at the edges, ill-defined like looking at an image through a cup of water. The last thing he hears, is Dream Steve screaming his name, and then he’s blinking his eyes open slowly, to cornsilk blonde hair and big hands, gripped tightly onto the blanket.
Tony manages to hold back a whine or a pout when Steve pulls back like he’s just been hit with an electric shock, and he’s more than used to Logan greeting him in the exact same way this guy’s greeting him and Steve, though something’s distinctly more… off about this. Logan always wears a smirk, and he’s usually waiting in the kitchen when Tony stumbles out of his room for food, and his body language is a lot more relaxed than this guy. It takes Tony a few seconds to piece everything together – and he’s sure he would’ve been a lot faster had he not been drinking last night – and the wedding ring he can see on the new man’s finger is more than enough of a giveaway, the final piece of the puzzle.
"Don't stop if I fall, and don't look back, oh baby, don't stop. Bury me, and fade to black!"
“yeah. Little reason to harm you, except the mole you planted.” And it
time. it’s not so long ago, that Tony would be here with him, rambling about how he could improve some piece of technology, or the redundancies in his newest iteration of an AI, to prevent it gaining sentience. (it turns out, he could learn a lesson, as much as Steve liked to tease him for being stubborn.) it’s not so long ago, that Steve would have been
He can't say he doesn't deserve as much.
Steve smirks softly, and bites his lower lip, to avoid blushing, though with his fair fucking skin, he probably is anyway.
It’s good. It’s so fucking good, and Steve finds himself biting into his lower lip, trying to keep from either growling obnoxiously, or popping his knot after a handful of thrusts. It’s ultimately useless, and he whines frustratedly, dragging the fingers of one hand through Tony’s hair. “baby… fuck… I… ‘m not gonna last long. ‘m sorry.”
For the longest time, he debates what he should say back. There are so many things he wants to say, wants to tell Steve, the most obvious one a nagging thought in the back of his brain. But he can’t make himself say that. Steve didn’t know that Tony was pregnant—Hell, Tony hadn’t known that he was pregnant until it was too late.
“Bryan is dead.” the other kid scoffs, and shakes his head.
By the second day of the third week, Tony’s spending most of the morning in the bathroom, being sick, or trying not to. They go out in the evening, to an impossibly small drug store that doesn’t look like it could hold much more than the contents of a couple of shelves worth of merchandise. They buy a box of purple tests, and they both cry when every single one of them turns out positive.
He takes a few steps away from the bath so that the sound of running water doesn’t overpower the sound of his voice through the line. At least it covers the way his heart’s pounding against his ribs in his chest. “I miss you, and I haven’t been able to get a single night of solid sleep since”—/since they sedated me at the hospital because I woke up in hysterics after the surgery and nothing could calm me down, not even Rhodey—“you left. I haven’t been eating, and the bots have to keep reminding me to fucking shower, and—and¬—” He cuts himself off, runs a hand through his hair and notes, absently, that it’s getting too long. But like hell is he going to let anyone go near his head with scissors—they can be made into a weapon too easily. “I miss you,” he repeats, the words far softer and too near a whine for his own liking.
He sighs, and flips the phone back open, meaning to type out a final goodbye if nothing else. He's surprisingly numb, he thinks absently. Hell, maybe he knew this was coming all along.
Tony’s body hasn’t ever done particularly well, at taking a fucking hint. All the way back to grade school, when he would get nosebleeds, at the most random of times, and for seemingly no reason. Imagine his surprise, to learn that chronic nosebleeds are something to look forward to in pregnancy, too.
Steve's all nerves, pacing the Halls of the gallery proper. Usually, the art helps settle him, sets his mind back to a creative space, but all he can think of now is Tony. Wondering where he is how he's doing, if he's actually going to show. It's madness. When he sees a cab pull to the curb and stop, his heart jumps into his throat violently.
Tony’s down in the workshop when he hears it: a sharp, tinny chime from the drawer Rhodey made him lock the burner phone away in. Well, Rhodey didn’t make him lock it away, but both Rhodey and his therapist agreed that it would probably be better for him and his recovery if he didn’t spend a solid two hours a day holding the phone in his hands and staring at it as though he could use it to telepathically communicate with Steve. So, he and Rhodey locked it away, and Rhodey left the keys in a little box on the opposite side of the workshop, because Tony swore he wouldn’t unlock the drawer.
He runs a hand through his hair, leans back against the arm of the couch, flexing his fingers over the keyboard. The live footage playing out before him shows Jessica and Wanda undercover, trying to subtly extract information before they resort to more serious measures. More deadly measures. He has another algorithm running on one of the computers at the opposite side of the room, glances over at it every few seconds to check the progress. At the loft, he'd managed to latch onto the signals both Steve and Barnes' phones had been sending off, could use it to remotely trace and track and hack.
“Tony… Tony, you’re not… You’re
Whew! sorry about that, that was uh. a long sabbatical?? whatever, I'm taking it. but I'm back! thank you all for the kind comments and kudos it... it seriously means so much to me, that people actually care about my useless ramblings. thank you, thank you, thank you. <3
Steve hums softly, the only sign that he’s willing to give, that he heard Tony. he’s quickly descending even further into rut, and he’s not afraid or ashamed to admit that he’s losing his higher brain function, and really, words aren’t the important thing now anyway.
“there was… another you, too. I think he was supposed to… take me to the other side, or whatever.” Steve raises an eyebrow, in intrigue and Tony groans quietly. “I know. I know how it sounds. Bear with me. I… when you asked me to come back… I was about to leave with him. Steve, you pulled me /
“it was… alright. Seeing another me was weird.” Steve hums quietly, and nods his agreement, and Tony bites at his lip softly. “that’s… actually what I wanted to talk about. The nurses… they said that the only way knew what to check me for, is that someone left them a note… Steve, Ed’s been gone for a couple days, do you think?”
“thank you. I… I’ll be ok. I’m gonna be ok.” Even though he’s jut been telling her the exact same thing, now that his words are being echoed back to him, he’s confused, and nearly ready to ask her how the hell that could be. There’s a sudden silence, as a beeping sound that they’ve grown used to hearing, stops. He turns to look down at the theatre, and notes that sure enough, one of the main monitors has been turned off. He moves to look back at the girl, and she’s disappeared. He’s getting sick of people doing that.
“so you’ve covered who you are, ‘Ed’. Want to explain ‘why’ exactly you’re here, now?” Steve’s sure to put a certain amount of emphasis on the other mans name, let him know that Steve’s still not exactly buying the cover story of being from another universe. (can you blame him?) but, if the brunet notices, he doesn’t acknowledge it, in the slightest. He’s fiddling with something, in his lap, a piece of technology not unlike a StarkPad, but more hardware intense, less holograph dependent, like the ones in the Tower. Ed must catch him checking the piece of technology out subtly, because he smirks, without looking up, and swipes a few pages off to the side.
"damn, Tony, impatience looks good on you." He growls before he reaches for a condom with shaking hands and rips it open, rolling it on as fast as he possibly can. He's a little shaky with the lube, so there ends up being a bit of a mess but it isn't like he can't afford to fucking replace the bedding, so he chooses to ignore it for now. He crowds into Tony's space, and kisses the breath out of him, before lining his cock up and pushing in slowly.
He drags his free hand through the lukewarm water—anything hotter is uncomfortable and stuffy, even two days out from heat—as he tries to figure out how to put his thoughts into words.
There’s a chime, a deep, resonant thing from the grandfather clock that inhabits the office on the other side of the book shelf, and Steve smiles, happy to see time passing, for the first time, in a long time.
“Don’t see the family resemblance? I mean, I know I haven’t shaved in a while, but I thought at least I’d be recognizable.” He smirks again, and tilts his head to the side in a show of manufactured adorability. “I’m his cousin. Maria’s side. The Carbonell genes always run strong.”  Famike might have said no at one point, might have insisted that he show some form of identification, or some other form of security measure, but the charm that Ed lays on thick seems to smooth away whatever remaining worries she had, and she simply smiles.
“what happened, Clint?”
“That's not...he's not-- he's my partner, not my um. Not my
“You can’t call me a Neanderthal!” his eyes flash for a second, the only sign that he’s panicking, and it’s maybe the span of a single second, before he’s continuing, assured of his own words. “My mom and sister are dead, I have no family, you’re contractually obligated to be nice to me!”
Tony bites back a wounded noise at Steve's accusation, though it hurts regardless of whether he makes it known or not. There's no point in trying to convince Steve that he wasn't sent here to harm him, or find out information, and Tony's really only got himself to blame for assuming that he and Steve could still work, even after he found out about Bucky. He should've known that something which started off as a one night stand could only ever end that way, should have accepted that and moved on, ignored any feelings that arose. It was stupid. He was stupid. And now he's going to be shot because of it, and Clint'll be injured, too, as if dying alone wouldn't be bad enough.
“Bucky I… I can’t, ok? I just… I can’t.” it feels like a lackluster explanation, and it probably is, but he can’t think of what to add to make it better. Fortunately, Bucky has always known when to push, and when to let it go, so they lapse back into silence, and this time it lasts, without intervention. They both turn back to the water, watching the antelope that step gingerly on the far bank of the river, dipping their sloping necks to drink their fill before the sun heats the water. When Bucky speaks again, his voice is quiet, timid almost.
Back upstairs, Tony’s starting to come back around from the panic that had all but swallowed him, and realizing that Steve’s nowhere to be found, ironically, is making him panic that much more. he shifts slightly, trying to get into a more comfortable position, and a cramp wracks through his stomach. He doesn’t give his body permission to scream, but it does it anyway.
“Merry Christmas, Stevie.”
“Son of a bitch, Tony, tell me that you didn’t fuck James godamned Barnes.” it wouldn’t be entirely out of the realm of the possible, even if Tony technically knew better. The guy had gone into Red Star territory last night, and he hadn’t been exactly sober, when Clint had seen him, though he’d clearly been straight enough to lose Clint in the crowd. Which is… not insignificant. Clint’s a damn good tail.
“Are… Are you wearing a fucking ‘save Ferris’ shirt?” Steve prime looks down, at the grey T shirt in question and shrugs, like it’s nothing.
On the drive over, Tony'd noticed a cab tailing them for a couple of blocks, at the start of the journey - so Jess and Clint can stop worrying, because he
"If he didn't feel the same, I'm pretty sure there would've been a lot more yelling and cursing you out this morning, not telling you that he'll call you." "But," he adds after a second, his usual smirk tugging at the corners of his lips, "you are a pansy. Think the way you just described our first time goes to prove that." Before Steve can get offended or defensive, Bucky tilts his chin up, kisses him. "It's cute."
The corner of Tony's lips ticks up in a smile, and he's relieved that Steve can't see it with the way they're standing. He doesn't really want to rest, never has been one to take that particular piece of advice every alpha who's ever helped him through a heat has offered, but he hasn't been sleeping much lately, either. Heading into a heat with his energy levels already below a baseline is a one way ticket to disaster. "Good to know that some things never change," he mutters, tightening his grip around Steve's waist for half a second before he lets go entirely and steps back, out of Steve's arms, much as it pains him to do so.
The more and more Steve thought about it, the more the moniker of Star seemed like it fit Tony. they were always volatile in the beginning, reactive, like Cesium and water, burning into a compound so much bigger that itself, rapidly enough to shatter everything around it. Some of their fights were nuclear in their intensity, but no matter what they did to each other, Tony stayed every bit his bright, beautiful self, burning just as brightly as he ever did. Steve knew he loved him even as they stood on the helicarrier in 2012, spitting venom and vitriol at each other.
“Yeah, yeah, message received.” he says, though, there’s actually no bite to his words, no anger, surprisingly. “You should try it though. It’s sweet.” Bucky leans back, hip against the bar, as he crosses his arms, looking down the curve of his nose, at Clint.
“he… ok? Who attacked him, what powers? medics are on their way but we need to kno—”
“I’ll go into pre-heat on Thursday,” he says, opening his eyes to stare at the ceiling. “Listen, Steve, if you don’t want to meet while we’re caught up in the middle of our cycles, I’m not going to blame you,” he adds, even though his hindbrain cringes at the idea of not spending a heat with his alpha, especially so soon after…everything that happened. The doctors assured him the damage to his uterus was contained and repaired, and it may make future conception more difficult, but it wouldn’t do anything to dampen the effects of his heats. “I get it. Emotions are gonna be high enough when we meet, and it’s probably idiotic to do that while you’re in rut and I’m in heat, but I’ll be there if you want me to be.”
“I know he did. We haven’t met. Not really. Anthony Edward Armstrong, Stark, until ’91, when I found out the heir to the Stark fortune, wasn’t. thanks, Howard.”
“thank you for your service, ma’am.” Something weird flicks across her face, something brief and quick, but painful, nonetheless. It takes Tony’s brain a second or two to catch up, but when it does, he whines softly, involuntarily.
Tony’s words only serve to stoke the fire that’s already burning in the pit of Steve’s stomach, and as much as he wants to make this last as long as he can, as much as he wants to draw it out, and make Tony squirm and suffer, reduce him to a crying, begging mess, he just… can’t. he pulls back with a soft growl, and licks his lips in a way that is absolutely vulgar.
“Yeah. Yeah, I don’t have anything. Do you… want to meet at the gallery?” he knows it sounds kind of tacky, like he just wants to roll back into bed with the guy (he does) but there’s so much to talk about, and they need to decide where this is going, if anywhere. “I’ll cook.” He tries, hoping he doesn’t sound like he’s desperately trying to cover. (he is). “Clothes on, Bucky told. The right way, this time, honey.” Tony hums, as if he actually needs a moment to consider whether or not he wants to meet up at the gallery.
“Screw you, buddy, I’m fuckin’ manly as hell.” He pouts slightly, sticking his lower lip out like a kid. He looks over the apartment for a few seconds, and sighs, before shaking his head. The bedding needs to be stripped and washed, there's the remains of a lamp on the floor that needs dealt with—round three had been… violent— and there's an overwhelming air of emotion in the atmosphere that feels like it's strangling the life out of him.
Cint should say no. he really really shoud. But… he hasn’t ever really known how to do that with tony, has he? He sighs heavily. “Fine, yeah. Half an hour, you fuckin’ pillow princess.” the squeal of unrestrained glee from Tony is almost almost enough to justify the hike all the way out to queens.
Absently, Tony follows the movement of Steve's fingers through his hair, tipping his head back and to the side to give Steve easy access to his bonding glands, should he choose to mark Tony this time. He feels almost as though he's trapped underneath the surface of a body of water, but it's not necessarily an unpleasant feeling. It just takes a lot longer for Steve's words to reach him than it usually would.
Bucky smirks softly, and shakes his head. “not quite.” He moves to walk a little further down the hall, pushing past the confused nurse who looks like it’s in her job description to argue, but really doesn’t want to. Bucky waves her off, and she goes willingly enough. When Tony stands in the exact same spot he was occupying a moment ago, Bucky raises an eyebrow at him. “are you… gonna c’mere, or…?”
Tony shuts and locks the door behind himself, leaving the key in the lock to make it clear that this isn't any kind of trap and that Steve can walk out whenever he wants to. If Tony hopes that he doesn't want to, well, Steve doesn't need to know that. He runs a hand through his hair, a self-conscious little thing because he hasn't had his hair this long since Afghanistan for very good trauma-related reasons, and is halfway through trailing across the room after Steve -- he's not paying attention enough to realize it's happening -- when he comes back to himself and stop by the couch. There's maybe twenty feet between them, and it's entirely too much.
He staggers out into the hallway, disoriented, and confused, and mad as hell. He only makes a few steps, before a well meaning nurse is rushing up to him, trying to usher him back into the room. He’s, understandably, having none of it. “Where’s my kid.”
In the few seconds it took Steve to grab himself pajama pants, Tony repositioned himself so that he was under the covers instead of on top of them, because he doesn't want to be cold, but he doesn't want to get dressed either. He raises an eyebrow at Steve's question, mostly because he's been tipsy half the night and Steve didn't seem to mind, and there were people doing far more dangerous things in the club that Tony hadn't paid much attention to. After a beat, he shakes his head, shifts slightly so he's back on his side with one arm tucked under the pillow.
“Stark. Hey.” he says, jostling the slighter man, to get him to wake just the slightest bit. He hated to wake up alone, when he’d gone to sleep with company, Clint knew that. Something borne from the way that his parents raised him, or acquired from a lifetime with the mob, or hell, just a random quirk about Tony. No matter what it was, Clint knew about it, and he always tried to do what he could, to make sure that he didn’t set off that particular anxiety. It was the least he could do, he figured. “Stark. C’mon, man, you’re crushing me.” Tony stirs sleepily, and shifts his position, burrowing more into Clints chest, and making his heart ache painfully, with missing something he technically never had.
The sound of the burner going off again is almost  enough to make Steve break. He's torn between excitement, because his omega is still talking to him and dread, because it can be nothing but bad, surely. He opens the phone with trepidation, and bites down on his own lip, trying to keep from screaming in hurt and frustration and confusion. He manages, but only just.
“we, ah… it would be helpful if a member of the team, anyone who knows what was going on, what the mission was, any environmental factors, could accompany him. It’ll save some time with the charting, help the doctors know what kind of tests to run.”
“No.” Fury raises an eyebrow, looks Steve over with a skeptical eye and takes a long moment to consider what he’s going to say.
“Hey, I wasn’t trying to--” clint raises a hand, to stop Tony right there, shaking his head slightly. This always happens, when he brings up the deafness. People trip all over themselves to apologize, even when it has, like now, not a damn thing to do with them. It makes Clint want to scream, but that’s not exactly easy to explain, and doesn’t do much to alleviate the unnecessary apologies. Clint sighs softly.
Steve can't keep back the tears then, even though he's biting his lower lip hard enough that it's definitely bleeding. The sound of the loft door shutting is enough to crumple him, and he drops his face into his hands, muffling a curse, and a shout. When he finally looks up, his face is tear-stained and red. “Can… do you hate me?” It seems like such a pathetically stupid question, but Bucky's gone, and apparently he took the rest of Steve's strength with him. Nothing is certain now.
Tony’s breath catches in his throat at Steve’s suggestion, and he half expects Rhodey to come crashing through the door and slap the phone out of his hand, into the water. Rhodey seems to have developed a sixth sense for when Tony’s about to do something incredibly, incredibly stupid, and Tony would be lying if he said it hadn’t saved him from more than one near death experience. It would make things easier now, for certain, because Tony doesn’t know what he wants.
He groans softly, and flops back into the mattress, debating the merits of attempting to suffocate himself with his own pillow.
“Hi.” Clint would probably make fun of him if he’d heard it, given that not twenty-four hours ago Tony had been yelling instructions and locations at him and Luke over comms, making increasingly frustrated noises when the systems showed that Clint cut the wrong wire and that an alarm had been tripped, which he then had to figure out how to defuse remotely because apparently Clint couldn’t listen to orders unless they were from Pepper – even then, it’s rare. Not really his fault he sounds a little on the shy side, though. He’s not paying attention; still searching the crowd past the guy’s shoulder to see if he can catch glimpse of Karen. He knows Clint would never divulge to her what they both really do – even if he’s convinced that she’s not got as clean a record as it appears – but it’s still a worry. Most hitmen Pepper hires wouldn’t crack under the most brutal torture; Clint, on the other hand, only needs to knock a few drinks back before it all comes spilling out.
"In this world, we're just beginning to understand the miracle of living. Baby, I was afraid before, but I'm not afraid anymore. baby, do you know what it's worth? Heaven is a place on earth. They say in heaven, love comes first, we'll make heaven a place on earth."
Steve is universally fucking terrible at having faith in anything, but he nods, and steps out of Tony's way because it's the right response. Or, it's the rightest response, as far as this situation goes. The brunette makes his way out if the loft and down the stairs, and Steve tries his hardest not to think how he's probably making his way out of his God damned life. He turns to Bucky, slowly, and sighs.
“C’mon, Tone, tell me what you like. Tell me how ta fuck ya.” His accent slips through, accidentally, and he'd be embarrassed about it, if he had more capacity to care.
“Tones? Tones, you here? You were supposed to head out to the compound and—” his sentence stops off short, and Steve knows he’s been spotted. His mind scrambles for some kind of explanation, anything that explains why he’s sitting in the floor, holding Tony, while the omega cowers. Rage flicks over Rhodeys face, and Steve raises his hands out to the side, placatingly. Which is maybe the worst move that he could have made, given that there’s still blood on his hands. He winces visibly.
Steve sighs again, and rolls his eyes in defeat. “Fine then, give me a coo—” the engineer moves in the span of a heartbeat, entirely too fast for what could be humanly feasible, and before Steve’s even aware of what’s happening, there’s a sugar cookie being shoved into his mouth, and one Tony Armstrong smiling at him impishly.
Tony laughs. It’s probably rude, and yeah, Steve prime doesn’t seem particularly impressed, but then again, the real Steve probably wouldn’t be either, so maybe that’s a win.
Steve’s heart violently skips a beat, the way it would when he was young, and would forget himself, playing. He’s not entirely certain why something so simple-- a mere clerical error, surely-- makes him feel so… fluttery, but he doesn’t have time to parse that at the moment. He clears his throat, and stands, running his palms down his thighs, to try and wipe away any sweat, along with the nerves that had caused it. When he speaks, it’s with a clear, authoritative tone.
I don't know. They were gonna bang. They really were. But Clint is a gentleman.
“Are you gonna tell him the truth or am I?”
Dum-E presses forward with the blanket more insistently, and Tony rolls his eyes, taking the blanket off the bot and moving to set it over on the couch in the corner. “I’ll go up to bed, alright?” he asks, and he’d feel crazy if he didn’t know that they could understand him. They couldn’t respond, but they could understand. Burner phone in hand, he heads for the elevator, already wondering whether or not he should’ve just left it in the drawer.
"You're okay," he says, voice barely above a whisper. "You're okay, Steve, I've got you. 'm gonna move now, okay?" And he lifts himself off Steve's cock slowly, for both of their sakes, so he doesn't hurt himself or push Steve to the uncomfortable side of over-stimulated. The second he's off, he lies down on the bed next to him, leaning back in to kiss him again. "You're okay," he repeats, even quieter this time. "We're okay."
“You’re not… hallucinating. You’re… it’s hard to explain this place.” Tony looks around them, at the Steve and Tony originals (does that make
Steves so convinced that he's not going to get a response that when the phone goes off, he nearly jumps out of the bed with shock. He tries to calm himself down before he opens the phone, tries to squash that feeling that's entirely too close to 'excitement' for comfort. After all, it could be an automatic response, a non-existent number letting him know his text hadn't got through. Tony may have contacted the company, got the service cut. Someone else could have the number now.
“God no. My brains already half melted, is that really what you want to do with my remaining thought processes?” His cock is thickening with interest, and a small smile plays on his lips as he rolls his hips up. Tony's gotta still be sore, they were
He snaps awake violently, eyes wide and breaths coming in ragged pants. “Tony? babe, you ok?”
Tony steps closer, and narrows his warm eyes at Steve. “Okay, you might be on duty, but I’m your boss, and if I say that you should have a cookie, you’re like. Contractually obligated.”
“She didn’t – She’s one of the ones to face you and live, and she – she managed to grab nearby security camera footage. You should really be more careful about that, by the way. It’s, uh, it’s destroyed, but, y’know, for future reference.”
He isn’t going to say they’ve been flirting over the last month, but he isn’t going to discount the idea either. There’s a thick, heavy silence that falls between them, as his brain scrambles through the last 30 days, twenty-three hours, twenty-seven minutes. The serum hives him the benefit of an eidetic memory, so picking apart every interaction they’ve had since Thanksgiving is easy. It’s probably only three or four seconds of oppressive silence, but to Steve it feels like a lifetime.
Steve has to use his hand to stifle the laugh that’s begging to break out, and he miraculously manages to disguise it as a cough. Tony, for his part, merely rolls his eyes, and takes another sip of his coffee. Peter’s only thrown for a second or two before he’s retaliating.
Steve’s confused, initially, lost on why it sounds so very much like Tony’s trying to apologize for something beyond his control, and then it clicks. he’s talking about the future. A future that they might actually have. The simple revelation is enough to nearly choke him with emotion, and his next breath is ragged. “Tony. I don’t… I don’t care. I don’t care if we never have pups.” He promises softly.
The nursery is right below the one that he’s on, which shouldn’t be weird, really, except that every patient stares at him. Not just ‘cute newborn, too tired to hold head still’ stare, actual stare. With prolonged eye contact, and little baby fists and mouths wiggling, all eager to see the man before him. He had no earthly idea how children worked. But he didn’t like it. He seemed to be totally invisible to almost everyone around him, but these little heathens seemed to know where he was every minute of the time he spent on their floor. It was unsettling, at best.
"'m sorry," he mumbles, shifting slightly so that there's less tension held between his shoulder blades. He reminds himself to breathe, tries to focus on Steve's scent to calm himself down. He needs to relax. "I'll behave."
“You would’ve, too. And maybe… maybe you’ll get your chance, again.” he shrugs slightly, the movement rocking Tony gently. He tries not to imagine himself as the alpha that gives Tony the chance again, and fails miserably. He sighs softly, and wraps his arms around Tony, holding him close, careful to keep his grip loose enough that Tony could break out of it, if he wanted to. After a few moments, Steve leans down gently, to press a soft kiss to the corner of Tony’s temple, where a headache tends to settle in the early stages of heat, before his instincts take over enough, to make pain an afterthought. “You should be resting while you can.” He mutters softly, already half convinced that Tony won’t take the advice. He never did.
Steve’s effort ends up being for naught, because the elevator chimes pleasantly, and Rhodey strolls out, looking confused and pissed. He hasn’t rounded the kitchen corner yet, so Steve isn’t visible yet, but it’s only a matter of seconds.
The dreams drift away slowly, as Bucky sleeps. What's usually a calm peaceful rhythm of his chest rising and falling turns to nothing but...well, nothing. He still completely as his respiration falls that much lower. Steve squirms, as Tiny readjusts the blankets and something, who knows what, makes him open one eye slowly tiredly. “T-Tony?” He mutters, voice rough with sleep and disuse.
“FRI, what the hell knocked me out of the sky?” no answer comes though, and he scoffs, thinking a bitter ‘e tu, Friday?’. Seems like people have been abandoning him lately, but he didn’t think it applied to tech too. He never thought one of his talents would be scaring off AI that was programmed to do his bidding, but hey, Howard did always say he was an overachiever. Especially in the art of pissing him off. He sighs, and moves to sit up.
Tears well up in his golden eyes, and when he blinks, they spill over, though he makes no attempt to wipe them away. “I’m so sorry you had to go through that alone.” "I wasn't alone," Tony says softly, because it feels important that Steve knows that. "I had Rhodey and Peps, and Peter, though sometimes the kid does more harm than he does good." Never intentionally, but Peter doesn't tend to navigate well in tense situations, and the first few weeks after Tony woke up from the surgery felt like something else entirely. Whether it was ill-timed jokes or treating him like he could break at any moment...Yeah, Tony gets Peter was just trying to look after him and keep him safe, but that's meant to be what Tony does for him, not the other way around.
"When you're strange, faces come out of the rain, when you're strange, no one remembers your name, when you're strange."
Clint shuffles into the kitchen, flips the coffee pot on, and jumps up onto the counter, dragging the med minder over, and disinterestedly staring it down. He remembers, after a second or two of Lucky nosing at his hand with intent, that he actually has to turn the alarm off, or the poor thing is just going to follow him all day, confusion, and disappointment in his eye, while he waits for his dumpster fire of a human to remember that ‘this sound means treats’. Clint smirks softly, and reaches across the island, grabbing a bacon treat out of the tin there. “Thanks, Luck.” he murmurs, tossing the treat into the living room, smiling softly as a whirlwind of blond and eager chases after it.
“No, Tony.” the beta repeats himself. Tony, for his part, seems utterly confused, and blinks three or four times, before his eyes finally clear, and he actually looks attentive.
He whines softly into the kiss, and they're pressed close enough together despite the size of the bed around them that Tony can roll his hips against Steve's, hoping that he gets the memo.
“my universe. Didn’t think there was a Steve there too? There is. Or there… there was. There was, until I went and got myself put in a fucking coma.” A look of shock crosses Steve’s face, he knows it does, but there’s little to nothing that he can do about it, he always has had the worst tells. Ed shrugs softly. “it’s not the same. Not. Not exactly. It’s close enough though. I went into a coma, rated an eight on the Glasgow Coma Scale, which is… not ideal. They were convinced that I’d be vegetative for life. My Steve fought the doctors for as long as he could, put up every bit of fight in his body, which is uh. No inconsiderable amount. But we weren’t married, or engaged, or anything other than on-again off-again lovers, to anyone but the team. So they puled the plug.”
Steve’s reminded, perhaps morbidly, of wax figures. Made to look lifelike, had the right coloring, and the appearance of who they were meant to model, but… there was just something eerily wrong. All of Tony’s usual, frenetic, brilliance was just gone. Steve couldn’t even say that it looked like he was sleeping, because even in his sleep, he’d never seen Tony Stark look this still. A wave of nausea rolls over him, tightening in his stomach, and he’s quick to look down, try to steady himself again.
Clint’s dead wrong about manpower, but neither Steve nor Bucky are willing to correct him, because it’s just information that can be used against them in the end. Steve’s about to say something rude, but Bucky cuts across him, glaring down the end of his nose, at Clint.
“he just… fell.” Steve raises an eyebrow, and resists the urge to tilt his head to the side.
Bucky points through a glass pane, toward a corner of a room that’s almost entirely deserted. There’s a large plexiglass… “I-is that a crib?” Bucky scoffs, and rolls his eyes.
The well meaning nurse, a beta, if his nose is right, looks at him, confused. “Mister Stark they… didn’t they tell you?” he has no earthly idea what she’s talking about, but he’s heard enough bad news in his life, to know that those words don’t bode any sort of well. He’s just teetering on the edge of sobbing, when a familiar voice drifts over to him from behind.
“look, bud. You think I won’t set the entire city skyline on fire, just to see Stevie smile, you clearly don’t know who I am, and I’ll take every man you have down with me.” Steve smiles fondly, as weak as he thinks he can stand to be in front of Clint, who may still be a threat. He sighs, and puts a thumb over the hammer, holding it back while he squeezes the trigger. He eases it back forward, and he flicks the safety again, setting it back down on the table. He holds his hands up in a placating gesture and nods to Bucky to do the same.
he remembers it all, and he knows he isn’t wrong.
“Sorry for nearly shooting you Tony. Again.” he takes a step closer, keeping his hands visible, and his movements slow, and offers Tony a hand, gently offering to pull him into a hug that they no doubt both need.
He should say no, he should turn away, and be done with it, but he’s weak, and something tells him that’s the only way he’ll ever be able to have Steve. He sighs softly, but his lips quirk up in something of a smile.
Clint feels his left arm start to itch, at the inner elbow, and it takes everything in him, not to reach down and scratch it, Because that’s a tell, and if Tony knows that this particular conversation is making him crave a hit, he’s going to beat Clint within an inch of his life, if he’s lucky. Except… he’s never lucky. And he knows that. More likely, what would happen, is that the genius would blame himself for Clints ineptitude, would entirely take responsibility for shit that wasn’t his, and spend the next month and a half avoiding clint, out of the misplaced idea that doing so was somehow ‘helping’. He tries to convince himself that maybe he’s letting his anxiety get the better of him, and maybe it won’t happen, but hell it has before, more times than he cares to count. Clint sighs again, softly.
"You're not the one who's gonna have difficulty sitting for a week," he mutters, though there's a teasing lilt to his tone that should let Steve know he isn't actually bothered by this. He'll
“look, honey bear, the pillows aren’t my favorite décor either, but you could have just said. Miss Potts would be the one to throw them at anyway, I just pay for things.” Rhodey fixes him with a look that’s so unimpressed, it’s just off being physically painful to look at.
“So, you are him.” His voice is quiet, but Steve can’t figure out if its disappointment, awe, or something else entirely. He clears his throat thickly, and nods, looking down at the floor between them, which has cruelly still failed to open up and swallow him.
"Steve, I'm not...I'm not apologising for our fight," he says, glancing down at the ground and then back up to meet Steve's eyes. He can do this. It's likely a horrible idea that he'll regret five seconds out in the open, but he can do this. "I mean -- I hate the fact that we fought, yeah, obviously, but I'm not apologising for that. I didn't..." He trails off, unsure of how to best approach this. Steve needs to know. "I was pregnant, Steve. I didn't know, was too stressed to catch onto any of the signs my body was giving me, and I don't -- I'm sorry." Steve feels like he’s been punched through with something. His heart thuds painfully, and he blinks rapidly once, twice, before he feels a tear fall off the end of his lashes.
“Yeah?” he asks softly, as he sinks back into Tony, gasping out relief as he does. His cock is starting to tingle at the base, and he knows he doesn’t have long left. Hopefully, he won’t need long, to get Tony to come first. He jerks forward in a particularly rough thrust, one that scoots them both further up the bed. He should probably feel bad, but right now, it’s just fuel to the fire. He leans down and nibbles over Tony’s earlobe, teasing relentlessly.
He can’t help but to be sad that William’s gone, even as he got to watch the soldier have his own happy ending. He wonders, briefly, if that’s what it would look like if he goes. If he crosses the barrier, decides to stop hanging around here, and go to the ‘great beyond’ in whatever form it takes, will he have someone beautiful to take him there? Who would it be? Who would even love him enough to care where he went?
“Tony. You’re not hallucinating.” Tony scoffs.
He ends up giving the team a few simple directives, Sam comes around to help Natasha finish the task, Vision takes his place on air support, and other than that, the team remains mostly unchanged. Barton’s shaking when Steve gets to him, and he isn’t cracking a joke, he isn’t even so much as smirking. all of the color drains out of Steve’s face. Those signs don’t bode well.
“I’d compliment your for Karpov, but that was three months of border fights for us. Nearly lost us midtown, and cost me personally 15k.” Yeah. He’s got a grudge. Clint shrugs, slow and easy with his hands kept where they are, unwilling to chance being shot (not that he hasn’t survived bullet wounds before, but something tells him Steve shoots to kill).
“Hold on tight, doll.” He shifts the car into drive, and pulls away from the curb. There's this myth that—well, it's not exactly a myth. There's this
not expecting the shrill ring of his personal phone to go off over the sound of screams. He rolls his eyes and scoffs gently, flicking the needle he’s shoved under the guys nailbeds, because he can, and because he’s not in the best mood. “Listen to me, Gordon. You’re going to be quiet, while I answer the phone, aren’t you?” Gordon screams, and nods his head, eyes wild and desperate, like a wounded animal.
to purposeful. It’s all designed to make the occupants think ‘everything is alright. You’re not waiting on a loved one to die. Look how cute these hodgepodged together chairs are, would anything bad ever happen in a place as quaint as this?’ it makes Steve sick.
"No, you didn't," he says, forcing himself to look at Steve. "I went to every doctor and every expert I could find asking for an opinion on it, Steve, because I was so fucking convinced that the pup would've survived if I hadn't followed you to Siberia, but that -- that's not what caused it." He takes a breath, drops his gaze down to their hands. "It's a genetic thing. I didn't know it, but Howard and mom apparently had trouble conceiving because mom kept miscarrying. The doctors don't think it's a hostile uterus, so much as something more like a uterus that isn't the, uh, normal shape, I guess. I didn't even start to miscarry until I was already recovering from Siberia. So, no, Steve, you didn't cause it."
Steve growls softly, and his hands come up to grip at the two perfect globes of Tony's ass. he kneads them softly, with overeager fingers, as his hips twitch involuntarily upward.
Tony’s backed himself into a corner, because that’s the safest place to be, when he panics. He remembers being a child, Howard berating him when he was drunk, when he threw things. Corners were good places to be. Harder to fight off hits you can’t see coming.
As soon as tiny mentions somewhere more private, Steve's brain kicks into overdrive. He’s insanely lucky that any of this worked out, didn’t end up with a drink in his face, or insults lobbied his way. He takes a half a second of personal time to marvel at the gods smiling on him, and then every non necessary brain function is quickly diverted to trying to figure out where they can go. There's the office but Bucky and Sam are in there running numbers, and that's not exactly romantic. There's the vip lounge, but it's closed off and unlocking it with the key he has is
Hes not expecting the kiss that Tony pulls him into, and it's dizzying for several seconds. When Tony moans against his mouth, he can't help but to smile softly. “Yeah? Right there?” He thrusts forward again, a rough snap of the hips, hoping to pull a reaction from the lithe man under him. He sucks Tony's bottom lip between his teeth, and bites down softly, just enough to add a layer of sensation.
Alright. first things first. this chapter is... major. there is graphic description of a opiate based overdose here, I will warn you if this is triggering to you, or if you are in an addict in recovery, tread /carefully/. this was triggering for me to write. feel free to head over to my tumblr @thejovialkynnadyg-ray if you want to ask questions or if you want me to explain a bit more about what happens.
“sure, Tony.”
From the bottom of my Hear your voice again Could we dim the sun And wonder where we've been?
“Yeah?” Tony blinks a few times, before breaking out into a hysterical laugh.  “You make a movie reference. You made an 80’s movie reference, and you were under the ice then, which means that you know things you shouldn’t. if you know things you shouldn’t… fuck. I’m hallucinating.” Steve pouts softly, a gentle sloping downturn of his pink lips, and tilts his head to the side, as if hurt.
Tony rolls his eyes, and kicks a piece of paper on the floor of his dining room-turned-workshop, cutting his eyes over to his computer, and definitely absolutely not pouting. He’s an adult. He would never. “It’s not nice to gloat, darling.” he doesn’t mean for the term of endearment to slip out. It just… does. He isn’t even really aware of it, until Clints answering comment makes him consider the word choice.
Steve closes his eyes, lets himself melt into the kiss. The sheer warmth of Tony, the fact that it’s actually
try to kick you, so, uh, be prepared for that?" He doesn't bother asking what Steve's work is, exactly, because he figures that if Steve wanted him to know, he would say. And the warning about kicking is only because it's a reflex from all the times he falls asleep at their main safehouse and Clint has to wake him the following morning to ensure he's not dead, hasn't been poisoned, or hit and not noticed.
Steve stares for what is probably longer than socially acceptable, but he can’t exactly bring himself to care. Because Ed is from a different world. Ed is from a different world, and Tony’s still unconscious, and it seems to bee too early in the day, to be dealing with that type of nonsense. He sighs heavily. “Ok, so if… if you’re here from a different world… why?”
“Colonel, a squad is incoming, 2 minutes and counting.” Steve could swear the world actually stops spinning, and the moment drags on for an inordinate amount longer than it should. It’s done then. Tony was right, they should have stayed in Italy, or taken their chances with telling T’challa. Steve coming back into the country was a remarkable, incredible mistake. He growls lowly, and fixes Rhodey with a death glare. It feels like he should say something, but there aren’t words foul enough in the English language for what he feels right now. He whines softly, and cups Tony’s face gently, tilting his chin to look up at him, not unlike so many months ago, hidden safely in the summer house.
"Catch you on a bad day?" he asks, cutting three security feeds entirely. Jessica and Wanda are half a block away from the warehouse they're supposed to be raiding -- infiltrating it undercover before they bring out the big guns, literally. His tone's light, teasing, and he doubts that anyone would think he's in the midst of covering up a hit. Granted, it's a hit to prevent more future murders at the hands of pissed off drug dealers, but it's still a crime. He doesn't wait for Steve to respond, types out a message to Clint on the laptop. Jess and Wanda are going to need a driver, after all.
Tony takes a few seconds to run through everything that could go wrong if he decides they should go back to his place: There’s the gun taped to the back of the bedside table in case anyone tries to break in, he doubts they’d be moving the bedside table for any reason, but it’s still a risk; there’s the ever-present threat of Rhodey dropping by to check in on him because apparently relapsing into old habits means constant supervision; and he’s pretty sure that he left half his computers on before he left the warehouse – not to mention that he co-habits the place with Logan because rent isn’t exactly cheap (can’t use your father’s credit cards when you’re trying to live off the grid, apparently), and he has no idea where the guy plans on being tonight. Sure, the warehouse puts enough space between them that they never really cross paths aside from in the designated communal areas, but he doesn’t want to risk it. “Your place,” he says after a second, looking over to the bar again to ensure that Clint’s attention is still on Karen. Both of them are gone, but he has more important things to worry about. So, he grabs Steve’s hand and tugs him through the crowd, towards the exit, only stopping once they’re outside and he can breathe without the fog machines they have at the side of the floor suffocating him. He turns to look up at Steve, raises an eyebrow. “Live far from here?”
“Boss, Cap, Colonel Rhodes is in the elevator, headed to the penthouse now.” Steve’s eyes go wide, and his stomach sinks to the floor. No one should have access to the tower at all, let alone the elevator to their private living space. Tony must have forgotten to pull Rhodey’s security clearance, or deactivate one of the override codes. Steve curses quietly, and moves to wipe away some of the blood on Tony’s nose.
"You're here with me, honey," he says softly, trying to remember how Pepper used to help him through his nightmares after 2012. "We're in Italy, and we're in my mom's old summer house, and we're both safe, alright? I'm completely fine, Steve. You almost kicked me off the bed with all your thrashing," he adds with a slight smile, because there was one night where Steve /did/ accidentally shove Tony out of bed. "But we're fine. Okay? You back with me?"Steve blinks a few more times, his eyes not quite focusing on what’s in front of them. His brain might be awake, but his body still hasn’t gotten the message. He groans softly.
“Hey, baby. Can you tell me what’s going on?” Tony shakes his head, and as frustrated as that makes Steve, he’s sure to keep his face neutral. The last thing he needs, is to further set off Tony’s anxiety, by emoting too strongly, and making it seem like he’s mad at him, too. Steve’s just opening his mouth to speak again, when there’s a soft whir to indicate a message from FRIDAY.
on him. “’ony?” Steve tries, cookie still hanging out of his mouth. Something flashes across the engineer’s face, and he’s taking a step back, out of Steve’s space. Steve, of course, panics. “Uh, Tony, I-I don’t… I didn’t—”
He rolls over onto his side, and fixes the plain white wall with a blank stare for long enough that his eyes start to water, from not blinking. One thing’s for damn sure he thinks, as he clutches the burner phone that much tighter in his hand. This, what he’s doing right now, isn’t getting anything done.
“It's alright ma'am.” He gives her a half expectant half pleading look. “can I see him?” She makes a quiet little nervous noise, and shifts her weight.
“A week.” He agrees. He fiddles with a bit of fuzz on the top of the island, and speaks to it, instead of Tony. “I… I should probably wait a little longer. Take a few missions. It’ll look suspicious if I don’t and… America’s dangerous enough already. Better not to tempt fate. Tony looks like he might cry (which is a sentiment Steve echoes himself, honestly.) but he nods. They’ve decided, for the time being it’s best not to tell anyone that Tony’s expecting. Not until they have amnesty figured out, and it’s legal for Steve to be with him. It’s just a few weeks. It feels like lying, but it really is the best option. They finish off their meager breakfast (not surprisingly, no one’s hungry) and share the briefest of kisses, before they split ways. A few weeks. It’s not… it’s not the end of the world. Even if it feels like it.
“Now. I just… just wanna get it out of the way. Living room?” When no one openly objects, he leads the way to the cozy living room, and plops down on the couch. He leaves spaces on either side of him but the armchair is also straight across from it. He very nearly loses his nerve. He said he'd confess, and he meant it, but damn was it hard. He sighed and dropped his head to stare at the floor, fingers resting not so comfortably in his own hair. “I… I've been using drugs, the last three weeks. More than weed, I mean.” He says softly, closing his eyes against the weight of his statement.
It's loud, sweaty, and obnoxious in this club. Everyone here is vapid and airheaded, but Steve has appearances to make, so he smiles, and nods, and schmoozes, and sells a few dimebags, while he's at it. The drugs are good, this newest batch allowing for a softer body high, letting the mind wander. Steve would be partial to it himself, if he wasn't so carefully opposed to partaking of the product. Bucky did, and that was fine and well for him, but Steve had watched his lover complete one too many 12 step programs for comfort. The game isn’t exactly what it was six months ago either. there’d been a sudden dump of new drugs into the area, that no one could track back to a specific gang which meant more time in the lab for Bucky, trying to fine hone their competitive edge, and unpredictable side effects from anything that wasn’t theirs, signed and certified. It also meant more time for Steve, spent just like this, hawking their product where he could, and taking note of anyone who used to buy, turning up their noses. The blond slumps and takes another hit off of his pipe before staring back out over the floor, idly wondering where Bucky was.
With a sigh, he tugs his boxers up a little higher to cover the scar, turning on the faucets for the bath. He skims over Steve’s message, ignores the aching emptiness in his chest, and moves instead to Steve’s contact information, hesitating only for a moment before he hits the call button. There’s a lot that can get lost through text alone, he supposes. It’d…It’d be better to talk.
Steve prime scoffs and the only response he gives for a long time, is to scowl off into the dramatic mid-distance. “it’s harder than that. You have to choose… staying, it won’t be easy, you know, Tony. just. Think about it.” Tony blinks slowly. Everything about this Steve, from his 80’s pop culture shirt, and ripped jeans, all the way down to his chuck taylors, is designed to make Tony feel comfortable. So why would his brain, which is trying so very hard, to keep him comfortable, tell him something this… serious? He opens his mouth to ask just this, but the door opens again, and a man walks in, leaning against the far wall, near the door. He pulls his dark red ballcap off, and he looks like a dead ringer for Tony, who huffs a soft laugh.
Clint’s so taken aback, that it takes him a moment or two to regain the power of speech, and another to fully piece together what he wants to actually say. In reality, it’s only ten seconds wait or so, but he can see Tony, watches how he carefully notes the pause. “Dunno. Not much really.” he shrugs. “He’s the Red Star enforcer. Married to Rogers.” he pauses and hums softly, in consideration. “When he isn’t busting heads, and kneecaps, his main thing is gun running. But he’s been known to cook books for their operation, too. Kind of a jack of all trades. Everyone thought for a minute there, that they were trying to get into human trafficking, because of where Barnes was going, what he was doing, but before you know it, a handful of pimps are gone, mysteriously, and something like a hundred kidnapped kids are being marched back to their parents, why are you ask--” he cuts himself off, and his eyes narrow, as he calculates the look on Tony’s face.
Tony's face is so gorgeous. He looks lost to pleasure and feeling, and it's a
Tonys mind spins away from his quickly, and his hands are shaking in a mere matter of seconds. It’s a strange position to be in, really. he’s panicky enough to be breaking down, but sane enough still, to watch himself fall apart. He blinks a few times, and he could swear there’s blood on his hands. He knows from experience, it never matters how many times he washes them, they won’t come clean. They won’t come clean, because it’s not actually there. He sets his tools down gingerly, and takes a shakey breath.
One of the decorative stock photos on the wall across from him, right next to the picture of “Melinda R., Radiology, Super Star Staff of the Quarter!”, is a seemingly innocent shot of a pretty flower, but the blood red color, is jarring. There are four huge petals clinging desperately to the hairy stem. The seed head is enormous, more closely resembling a forest, than a flower, as zoomed in as it is. It  reminds him of the stories his mother would tell him as a child, when he was coughing too bad to sleep. She was a wonderfully devout Irish catholic woman, so naturally the stories were designed to scare the daylights out of him. He remembers her telling him in hushed tones, of fairy trees, and how naughty little boys and girls that were too curious, might disturb the FaeFolk that lived in those trees, and summon a fetch, an eerie spectral copy of themselves, who would take them away to hell, never to see their mothers and fathers again. He shivers unpleasantly at the memory, and blinks hard, determined to ‘unsee’ the horrific faerie tale his mind had conjured up.
They’re not medically certain, whether or not those in comas can hear the words of their loved ones. There are a handful of studies that would suggest both, each contradicting each other, until they all seemed worthless to the scientific community. But Steve isn’t the scientific community. Steve is desperate. Steve is desperate, and lonely, and scared, and he’s at he end of his rope. So he does the only thing he can think of. He talks.
Clint looks back and forth from Tony, or more accurately the impassive, glinting iron man mask, and Steve a grand total of three times before he manages to speak.
Tony’s taking full advantage of the fact that no one can see him, to make the most severe confused face he thinks he’s ever made. This guy, this Ed, if that is his real name, is right in that the Carbonell genes always carried strongly down the lines, but he god one crucial detail wrong. Tony’s mom… she doesn’t have siblings. She has cousins of her own, sure, but none with the direct name, more like Furlanis, and Bianchis. So whoever he is, he’s clearly lying, about something. Tony hangs around, listening and waiting, wanting to see if he could get a better inspection of this guy wearing his face and his name (or… the inversion of his name, same difference, as far as tony is concerned.) but he offers infuriatingly little about himself. eventually, tony gets bored, and begins to wander.
Steve smirks softly, and presses gentle kisses against Tony's cheek.
“I… I can’t wait anymore, Tony, I need you.” He trails a hand up the inside of Tony’s thigh, lingering over his skin, letting his touch burn a brand there. He should be slow, he should be caring and kind and soft, but something tells him that Tony is just as ready for this, as he is.he sinks two fingers into his omega, and hisses out a harsh breath through his teeth, at the way his inner walls are already tightening and clenching around his fingers. “shh. I know baby. I gotcha.”
“alright, Mister… Carbonell?” Ed nods, and Famike blushes again, prettily. “well, your cousin’s safe with us.”
There’s a bad smell, he thinks. Something antisepticey, and wrong. He wonders if Steve might have cut himself or something. Maybe it’s whatever he used to clean up the blood. Wherever it came from. There’s an itch on his arm, and he reaches up to scratch at it, without looking. His heart stops cold, when he realizes that what his fingertips are touching, is an IV line.
Bucky makes a wounded noise in the back of his throat, rubs his thumb over Steve’s knuckles. He can’t…He doesn’t exactly know what to say. He wants to yell, wants to tell Steve that he’s seen what drugs can do to people, seen how they’ve affected him, but he also wants to run from this conversation. It’s not exactly a pleasant one, even if he knows it’s necessary. And he has so many questions. “Where did you get the needles?” he asks, and he tries to keep the combined anger and worry out of his tone. It doesn’t exactly work. “Steve, I…I’ve made sure that the loft and our home’s clear of that shit to deter myself from relapsing; how did you…who gave you the drugs? Who gave you the needles? Heroin’s…” He trails off with a harsh sigh. “Last time I used it, I wound up in the hospital, Stevie. Did you know any time you shoot up with it, you risk an overdose? Higher chance than some of the other drugs. You could’ve died, Steve. You could’ve…” He trails off again, but only because there’s a lump in his throat that he can’t speak around. He really doesn’t want to contemplate having to exist without Steve, doesn’t think he’d be able to. “It’s good you’ve told us,” Tony says when he realises Bucky doesn’t intend on continuing his train of thought. “We can…we can watch out, keep you from doing something stupid. I’ve done it enough times for Jess. And I can help you out, too, Barnes, if you…if you want to try getting clean.”
“I um. I love you too.” He reaches out with a heavily bandaged left arm, and allows his hand to trail down the gentle sweeping curve of Steve’s cheek. They sit like that, just… sit, for a long time. enjoying each other’s presence, and soaking a world that finally seems like a much brighter place.
Steve blinks open fiercely golden eyes, his top lip curling in a snarl, until he realizes that he’s looking at Tony. “baby. Hey, you shouldn’t be standing.” He furrows his eyebrows together in concern, and shuffles them and their pups until he’s standing, and Tony’s in the chair he was just occupying. Steve smiles softly, and hands over the other bundle, this one with a hat that has a tiny purple bow affixed to it. Steve looks every bit, the proud father he is. “you’ve already met out son. Here’s our daughter.”
There’s a teary moment or two, where Peter insists they all mention what it is they’re thankful for. Harley says he’s glad he doesn’t spend his days alone anymore, and Peter quietly thanks Tony for the care his aunt May receives at the nursing home she’s apparently in. Tony blushes prettily, and makes a few vague hand gestures, and suddenly it clicks into place, for Steve. Tony’s paying for her to be there. The moment passes quickly enough, and Tony jokingly says his thanks for the almighty coffee bean. Steve’s noticed that the engineer tends to do that, use sarcasm and jokes as a form of deflection. He wonders what it is the man has to hide from so adamantly, but three pairs of eyes are on him, and he realizes that it’s his turn.
He reaches out for the doorknob, and starts to turn it, but something pauses him, and he turns back to Bucky. “hey, Bucky… about my parents—” a tortured look falls over the alphas face, and for just a moment, there’s something impossibly heavy in the air between them. It’s gone, almost as soon as it happened though, and Bucky shakes his head, sticking his fingers in his ears, as he walks away, like the clown he is. “later, Stark.”
Fury shakes his head at that, stands from the chair, and straightens the trench coat he’s wearing. He mutters something about ‘being in touch’, and Steve doesn’t see him again. it’s a pretty blonde girl, some agent 13, that brings him the reassignment. Her S.H.I.E.L.D. issue identification badge says her last name is Carter, and that causes his chest to twinge painfully in memory.
“Stay.” the engineer says, sleep soft and fuzzy, and damnit, Clint almost does. It takes a moment or two, to convince his mutinous body to push the genius up, but eventually, he does.
“last chance, Tony. last chance to back out. You sure you wanna do this?”Tony stares at Steve for a few seconds, unwavering. If he's being honest, he's surprised that Steve is still this in control given how he's already at least a day and a half into rut. It's a miracle that they didn't end up with their clothes off the minute they saw each other, actually. When it becomes clear that Steve's going to need verbal consent and communication before he does anything, Tony leans close to kiss him again, then murmurs a,
“Tony… please, please, tell me you weren’t sent for me.”
What he needs, is to find a medic. See if he can’t convince someone to head in this direction, a nurse, a doctor, even a fucking mailroom clerk would work at this point. Anyone who could run for someone qualified to help. The movies have it all wrong, he’s meant to be able to /help/ people, in the balance like this, right? He’s meant to do something and yet here he is, with a girl whos name he doesn’t even know, dying in his arms. Not ideal.
"Go ahead," he mumbles, letting his eyes fall closed once again. "Like the glasses - they look good on you."
Chapter is of All the Gin Joints in the World by Fall Out Boy!
Tony would respond to the fact that Barnes just called him ‘kid’ if it wasn’t for his brain refusing to move past Steve’s sudden confession. He thinks he might throw up, and he’s pretty sure he can’t feel his legs.  he’s painfully aware that he’s likely seconds away from getting shot while he’s just millimetres away from where his jeans (and therefore phone) are lying on the floor, a call for help he so desperately needs to make because he’s not sure how he’s supposed to cope with any of this. There’s also the issue of how he knows who Barnes is, what he’s involved in, and how he’s supposed to come up with a story without blowing his cover. Easier said than done, really, especially given that Steve’s broke his brain in less than two sentences.
He tugs off his scarf the second they’re through the door to the loft, throws it over the back of one of the chairs, though he doesn’t take his jacket off yet. He’s lost the majority of sensation in his fingers, and he knows it’ll take him less time to recover the ability to feel if he stays warmer. His phone buzzes in his back pocket, a text instead of a call, so it can’t be anything urgent. He turns to Steve, leans in for another kiss, and lets himself smile when he pulls back.
Skin on skin, whispered promises and moans that work into a jumble of wordless, meaningless syllables, that mean much more for their cadence and tone, than their actual meaning. A bright, burning feeling, that’s as comforting as falling asleep in the sun.
One look at the coding of Barnes' phone made it clear that it would be a Goliath task even for someone as skilled as Tony, and Steve's wasn't much less protected. There are holes in Steve's firewall though, make it marginally easier to crack than Barnes's, and the program he's designed has been decrypting the information for over a week. He's pretty sure Steve'll think he's no longer interested, or was hurt by the whole husband thing. He can't even return to the club - Pepper's threatened death if he tries. There's a ping from across the room, and then his phone vibrates where it's stuck between his thigh and the couch, and he smiles to himself. Jess and Wanda are doing okay, so he figures he can take a quick break to call Steve, arrange the next time they meet. He sets the call up so that it goes through his laptop, using his headset so he can easily switch back to Jessica's comm line if needs be, and he lets it ring, prays Steve isn't adverse to answering unknown numbers.
“few little things. Way you talk, way nothing is ever too heavy for you, the punching bag you destroyed the first week you worked here. You can blame structural integrity as much as you want, but I’m a physicist, Steve.”
“Boss, it’s time for a break.” He hums to himself, a half annoyed, half exasperated sound. He’s too close to finishing off this last problem, he’ll take a break in a bit. Maybe five minutes pass, of him fiddling with the circuitry in peace, and then FRIDAY is chiming again.
is he something, up close. His eyes sparkle with an intelligence, and a danger that's more than a little intriguing. Steve's instantly hooked, and he's already pretty sure he's leaving with this guy, if he has anything to say about it. He smiles slow and easy and tilts his chin back in an assessing nod.
Bucky smiles softly, brushes a piece of hair behind Steve’s ear, in a motion that’s maybe a little fonder than they usually are. “Sure thing, doll.”
Tony cries out at the pleasure that courses through him, a short high whine that would've woke anyone nearby who wasn't roused by Steve's growl. It's a good thing they're surrounded by miles of unpopulated country, really. He's torn between jerking his hips forward, trying to get away from Steve's mouth because it's doing nothing but stoking the fire under his skin -- Tony could get off from this, yes, but it's not going to sate him like being knotted would -- and pushing back against Steve to let him bring him to climax anyway. In the end, he forces himself to still, stay exactly where he is, because Steve hasn't given him permission to move yet, and he's at the point where Steve's praise is affecting him in more ways than one, and damn it he wants to be good for Steve.
Tony's words go straight to Steve's cock, and it jumps and strains against his boxers. Tony moans so prettily though, he isn't quite ready to break contact and pull his underwear off, and start the mad grab for lube and condoms. He leans forward the tiniest bit, and sucks the head of Tony's cock into his mouth, swirling his tongue around it, before sitting back up. He smiles impishly down at Tony as he reaches over to the nightstand and fumbles around, grabbing until he comes up with a strip of condoms, and a bottle of lube. He briefly considers asking Tony to get himself ready for the sake of time alone but that sounds tacky even in his own head, so he refrains. He lays the condoms on the pillow next to Tony, and flips the cap open on the lube, dousing two fingers and dropping to an elbow, to rub gentle fingertips across his asshole. He looks up often, wanting to see every expression on the brunettes face, as he works in one finger, then two. Shortly after he gets the second finger in, he crooks them both, hitting Tony's prostate roughly.
“Mm. The
“You’d be helping a lot of—”
Clint cuts him off with a soft sigh, shaking his head, and looking back up to the TV, pretending to watch it, for a few blissful moments of stalling. “Blipped last month.” he says simply enough, trying to push past it. It doesn’t work, of course, and he hears the tiny inhale of breath, from Tony, before he can stop it. “C’mon, Tony, you know it happens.”
He hears the mug shatter on the tile floor, before he realizes that it’s slipped out of his hand. “STEVE!”
Steve's words work their way into his chest and nestle somewhere by his heart, and Tony makes a quiet little half-keen sound. It's pitiful, and it's one of those noises he'd be embarrassed if anyone else heard, but Steve isn't anyone else. Steve's Steve and, despite everything, Tony knows he can trust him.

Bucky slides into the spot next to him, and leans forward on the mahogany edge of the bar. “Tastes less like shit, if you chill it.” he says, matter of factly.
Bucky raises his head off of the countertop, and shakes it slowly. “nah, I’m pretty sure I know where he is. ‘m not worried.” lie. “he just… didn’t mention finding anyone worth leaving with.” And that’s the crux of the issue, isn’t it? They’ve been together for eight years, married for six, they’ve always said that if there was anyone else, there was no reason to cheat, just be upfront about it. But neither of them had ever bothered to find anyone else. Bucky shakes his head, willing the self-pitying thoughts away.
"Think I'm getting used to that," Tony says, voice quiet but earnest, and accepts Steve's hand, hugging him tight the second Steve pulls him close. "I was gonna tell you," he adds. "If we decided we wanted to be more than a one night stand. I'm sorry, Steve."
Clint is so far past giving a shit about any one single thing, that he’s ready to throw a fist, as much as a dirty look at the guy that sits down next to him. But then he looks up, into ice blue eyes, and all of a sudden… “shit” he mutters softly. James raises an eyebrow, and nods.
“I’ve missed you.” It’s a difficult thing to admit for someone as emotionally closed-off as Tony tends to be, but he has a feeling that Steve feels the same way, so he’s a little less hesitant about saying something he’d typically file under: ‘Romantically cheesy. Never Speak Aloud.’
in it.
It’s instinct to lean forward, drag his tongue over Tony’s scent glands, and it’s all too easy to bite down on the old scar, renewing it fully. Emotion washes over the pair, and it’s so intense, for a few hysterical seconds, Steve isn’t sure if he’s going to survive it. He whimpers slightly, and when he pulls away, he licks over the wound, hoping to close it. “f-fuck.” He says softly, voice weak and wrung out. “you ok?”
“Missed you too, Star. God, I missed you too.” The nickname rolls out of his mouth with no effort, just like it always has, but this time, it makes something in his chest ache. It’s the first time he’s used it in ages, and it feels so bittersweet.
When he wakes again, his head’s a little clearer, and he’s able to hold a thought in his head, without having to work for it like a beggar. He sits up slowly, and runs a hand through his hair. It’s dark, and three doesn’t seem to be anyone around, but there’s mechanical and medical equipment all around the room. It’s kind of odd, actually, it looks like something designed for much more intensive care. He shakes his head, and stands, deciding to deal with that thought later. Maybe they just wanted to make sure they didn’t screw up and kill Tony Stark.
[I know. I can't...god I can't either Tony. I can't eat, I can't sleep, I Can't go five minutes without wanting you here. Beside me. I'm sorry I messaged you, ok? I guess... I don't know what I was thinking.]
Tony doesn't have to look to know which scar he's referring to, though he doubts he can give the real story behind it without completely blowing his cover, and that's not something he wants to do, not even if Steve is earning his trust a lot faster than anyone else has. Except maybe Rhodey.
Steve groans quietly and takes a step closer, wrapping an arm around Bucky's side, and hooking his chin over his shoulder. “I'm sorry, Buck. It's not an excuse, but I was buzzed before I left, and I blazed when I got here.” He nuzzles up against the curve of Bucky's neck, where he's sensitive, and can't resist soft kisses and bites, and whines again. “I really am sorry, Jamie.” And that's, maybe, a little overkill. It's a nickname he doesn't use often, doesn't hardly use ever, because it's got sentiment like no one's business. It's the nickname he called Bucky way back when, when they were just kids, who didn't have all this shit to be afraid of, or gang wars to fight, or product to move. It was the nickname he woke up screaming from every bad nightmare, and asthma attack that nearly put him six feet under. Bucky gives in, wraps his arms around Steve's waist, though that doesn't mean that there isn't still a dull ache in his chest, Steve's words about loving Tony echoing through his head.
much less this time. Steve moans loudly as he sinks to he hilt in Tony, and his fingers squeeze desperately at his hips, harshly looking for an anchor. It’s only a few seconds, before Steve is pounding into Tony, each thrust a punishment, every one angled perfectly over the sensitive lump of nerves that is his prostate. Steve growls lowly, at the muffled sounds Tony’s mewling into his ear.
“text him, Steve.” Steve shakes his head, and drops his head back against the wall, letting his eyes flutter closed. If Bucky expects a response, he doesn’t make it apparent, and he doesn’t press for one. Steve hunkers down into his hoodie, in an effort to escape the cold that’s been one with his bones for just over three months
(See the end of the chapter for
A comfortable silence stretches out between them for several long moments, and Steve doesn’t question it, because he doesn’t have to. In these moments of perfect silence, the two of them say much more to each other than words ever could. I love you. You don’t eat enough. I’m scared. You need to sleep more. so much that they haven’t ever bothered to say outright, but it’s all there. Steve’s relaxed enough now, that his mind’s a million miles away, when Bucky speaks again.
Steve hesitates to say that he was suicidal, coming out of the ice. He never had a plan or a note. Hell, there wouldn’tve been anyone around to read it, but the S.H.I.E.L.D lackeys that treated him like something under a microscope slide anyway. He’s not even sure if he could have killed himself, but the thought had occurred more than once. And then there was Tony Stark. Loud, brash, over the top Tony Stark, that crashed into Steve’s life violently enough, that it rearranged every single thing about it. The proverbial ‘big bang’ that got him out of his own misery. The first light in a long, long era of darkness. Tony always led him back home, from every single rough mission, every sleepless night, every time he felt out of place and unwanted in this century… Tony was always there, giving him his bearings, no matter how lost he was. His own personal North star.
Steve…that’s unforgiveable.
“Hey, Tones, hey, hey.” He soothes gently, letting himself rock the both of them just slightly. “it’s… it’s ok to miss him, alright? Just… I don’t want you getting hurt again, alright? That’s all.” Tony sniffles a few more times, and rubs the tears out of his eyes. Tears that he didn’t give permission to be there. Maybe he’s closer to heat, than he cares to admit.
“how are you, baby?” he asks, breathlessly, resting his forehead against Tonys. His skin is cold from the outside, and some mother hen part of Steve pouts, wanting to keep him warm and safe forever—like that was possible, with a mobster. “hinny, you’re chilled through, let’s get you upstairs.”
There’s a certain amount of comfort to be spoken for repetition. For the simplistic contentment of habit. Even a bad routine, is a routine, just the same, and there’s a certain comfort to the screeching alarm you hate, or the early morning cancer stick you promised your wife you’d quit ‘as soon as this pack is done’. There’s a certain amount of comfort to be spoken for repetition, Clint thinks, as Lucky dives into the bed, pouncing on him, and using his paws to tap at his face. But the comfort of repitition, is kind of what got him here, isn’t it? Dragging his ass out of bed at seven thirty, not because he wants to, but because it’s demanded of him.
Tony smirks softly, and shakes his head. “you’re no fun, you know what cap? No fun.” Steve rolls his eyes, and shoves Tony’s wheelchair slightly.
Steve pauses for a minute or two, considering again. There are a few places that he could take Tony, a few safe houses out here, but in all honesty, they're near the edges of their territory and Steve's afraid of outing himself by getting any closer to their center of their operations. Anonymity was key when picking up one night stands (he figured, he really doesn't do this often) and getting his cover blown as a fucking mobster was probably a pretty good way to scare Tony away, and that would be a
“Better than Less than Zero.” He offers noncommittally, and for one bright, shining second Tony’s so confused that all he can do is blink at Steve for far longer than he probably should, mouth slightly open like he plans on catching a fly. The first words that come to Tony are—as is so usually the case with him—not exactly sensical to the situation at hand.
“quite a collection you have here… didn’t peg you for a Captain America fan. Isn’t he… kinda overly righteous?” Steve’s damn
Steve’s panting with effort, by the time that he pulls his fingers away. And his hands tremble with the pure need to grasp. “fuck. You… you ready for me?”
“You could say that,” he mutters, mostly to himself, as he sets about turning the faucets off when he deems there to be enough water in the bath. Tucking the phone between his ear and his shoulder—because putting it on speaker seems so far detached from anything remotely personal, for some reason he can’t parse right now—he unscrews the cap of a bottle of bubble solution, one that smells vaguely like the cologne Steve used to wear. Tony is unfortunately aware of how pathetic that sounds, which is why he’s never, ever going to admit to it aloud. “I can’t be there, though,” he adds after a moment, when there are far too many bubbles forming in the water. He’ll get lost under there. His voice is soft, but this time Steve’s meant to hear it. “You know that, right? I can’t—God, Steve, you know I’d love to be able to run away with you to…wherever the hell you are, but the UN would pick up on that immediately. I just…I wish I could turn back time, and tell our past selves to figure out some other way. But that’s not exactly a doable thing, huh?” He’d also tell himself from before the ‘civil war’ that he was pregnant, and to not do anything stupid, but too late for that. And Steve doesn’t need to know that either.
He ends up deleting the last few words, because of course he's not alright. How the hell could he be?
, that is. Until he gets a closer look at the cloth on Steve prime’s shirt.
“you were gonna.”
“You’re no fun.” he whines, pathetically, though he does actually move to the other end of the couch, stretching and making little annoyed sounds, as his joints pop back into place. It shakes something loose in clint, a memory of a time not unlike this, with significantly less clothes between the pair of them, and significant more touching. It hurts, though, to think of them like that. Because no matter the amount of times that they skirt around the issue, the amount of times that they share fond looks, and touches that last just a little too long… no matter how it seems like attraction is still there, Clint had fucked that up. It was gone now, and that… that was just that. That had to be what he accepted. Because questioning it… that just led to madness. He’d know, from experience. He sighed softly, as he stood from the couch, and moved toward the door. He isn’t expecting Tony to be behind him. But when he turns, mismatched eyes, one blue, one brown, look at him, hiding depths of genuine, unselfish care. “Go see doctor Cho.” he reminds. Clint’s halfway through opening his mouth to argue, when Tony leans in, and kisses his cheek, seemingly dismissing him. “‘Night, Clint.” Clint stands outside of Tonys closed apartment door for forty five full seconds, before he manages to force out a handful of words.
They spend something like two weeks after their shared cycles in a perfect, blissful kind of trance. They relearn each other, what makes them who they are, and what makes their relationship work. There are some days where they never manage to make it out of bed, too wrapped up in each other, in the nuance of skin on skin, and the intimacy they’ve been missing for months, but it’s not a guaranteed. There are other days, where they do nothing but talk, about everything. Thoughts, and fears, whet makes life worth living. This is what they should have been doing in the first place.
“you shoulda told me about him, punk. That was always the deal. We talk to each other, Stevie. I don’t deserve to have to find you neckin’ some pretty little thing in your loft.” He shoots a glance to Tony and huffs quietly. “and he don’t deserve the red star enforcer threatenin’ to shoot him first thing after he wakes up.
"Yours," he agrees, coming back to himself enough to speak around the trapped whines in his throat. "'m yours, Steve. I swear." And there's some smug satisfaction in knowing that Steve's his, too, even if it's an unspoken thing between them. The bond mark on his neck throbs and Tony presses his head against the pillow to stifle any wounded noises. The last time they slept together, they hadn't had time to renew the marks. And Tony hates to admit that it's affected him more than he cares for, amped the whole 'abandoned omega' thing up to a twelve.
Tony’s got half a mind to throw the phone across the room, see if he could break it to avoid furthering the breaking of his heart. He hates all of this, and he’s always responded to anything he hates with destruction. There aren’t any mirrors in the apartment anymore for that exact reason. None in the workshop, either, and he’s ensured that the walls are permanently blacked out. What he hates most of all is that he knows Steve’s lying. He’s trying to save face. He’s realised that the Rogues can’t stay on the run forever and is trying to make amends, or he’s trying to get back into Tony’s good books so he’ll speak to the UN on their behalf, or he’s just lying for the sake of it. Maybe he got bored and decided he wanted to screw around with Tony’s emotions.
Tony undoes the locks with shaking hands, the butterflies in his stomach worsening, to the point that they’re damn near bats now, and he absentmindedly wonders if maybe the doctors didn't actually fix him. It doesn't matter now. Opening the door, Tony doesn't hesitate to throw himself at Steve, arms going around the alpha's neck, and it's a move he's blaming entirely on his heat.
, receiving that look. Steve prime sighs softly, and rests a hand on Tony originals temple.
Maybe you and me.
him, than anyone else besides Bucky. Normally, he keeps things professional lets people see 'the Captain’ not Steve. He sighs quietly, and rolls to lay on his side, reaching over and pulling Tiny into a loose hold. He's adamant that its not a cuddle, just a way to conserve body heat. “You ok? Went kinda...went kinda rough. You need anything? Advil, shower?”
.” He walks away, pulling the phone from his pocket, ignoring the receding sound of sobbing. He notes, absently, that the number calling isn’t identified, which likely means wrong number, bill collector—because
?" Tony fires back, his tone a touch more incredulous than he intends. But he'd woken up to Steve murmuring nonsense right above his head, and the murmurs had quickly evolved into yelling and screaming. Tony hates to think that Steve might have spent months on his own like this, tortured by his own mind every damn night. Lord knows that Tony can't sleep, but he doesn't experience the nightmares as much because he doesn't let himself. Only when he passes out, and even then, he only wakes with a gasp and a cold sweat sticking his clothes to his skin.
There’s a strange energy between Steve and Tony though, something significant, that neither of them are talking about. It seems like something needs to be admitted to, but Steve can’t exactly identify what it would be. He clears his throat for the fifteenth time, and Tony finally sits up, looking over to him.
Nick Fury, the most stern faced person Steve’s ever seen-- aside from the exception of Colonel Phillips, who perpetually looked like his son had just told him that he wanted to become a professional unicyclist—sits heavily on a wheeled office chair in front of the too cushy couch that some agent showed Steve to, after they’d finally convinced him out of the gym that he’d been haunting like some malevolent ghost. The director asks Steve if he wants to take the shield and cowl back up, assures him that his secret identity from the ‘40’s was never revealed, even after they’d declared him KIA, and the only response that Steve can think of, is derisive laughter. It isn’t exactly in keeping with manners, but then, those seem more like a suggestion than anything in this strange age, and Steve thinks, maybe, that it can be excused.
“Tony, if you need to tal—”
Watching Tony fly that nuke into the wormhole, thinking he might not come back… that was what made it click, and for the worst fifteen minutes of his life, Steve wasn’t sure if he’d ever be able to see the night sky as anything but dim and weak, now that it’s brightest star was staring down another galaxy, waiting to blink out.
The seventeenth time that Tony manages to nearly take himself out, he’s trying to wire an arm to work with the repulsor tech that weaponizes the Iron Man suit, and enables it to flight. Steve knows that Tony is the one who created the suit, but what he doesn’t know, is who pilots it. It’s got to be someone enhanced, as close as he can tell, because surely no mere mortal man could handle being shaken around inside a tin can, or a gold titanium alloy can, as the case may be.
Falling sucks. Tony doesn’t remember much about where he is, or what he was doing before, but he knows it feels like several important parts of his spine, that should probably have spaces between them have definitely been compacted. He’s… going to be feeling that tomorrow. He blinks his eyes open slowly, and asks FRIDAY for an adaptive sitrep, tell him what happened since he checked out. The various displays and lights are still blazing bright around him, so power didn’t flicker. Which means…
“Fuck you, first of all, Rogers, you’re so wrong, I don’t actually have time to tell you how wrong you are. it was gritty and esoteric and—you just made a movie reference.” Steve slides his hands into the pocket of his (torn, what the hell?) jeans, and shrugs again.
“FRIDAY, contact secretary Ross.” He speaks to the AI without ever looking away from Steve. “You have two fucking seconds to get the hell away from him, Rogers.” Steve growls, instinctively, before he can stop himself, and he hates that he’s worried enough , that he didn’t have the presence of mind to cut the sound off. Appearing aggressive isn’t exactly fucking helping his case.
“no, you don’t understand, he just, /fell/. We had just taken down an invisible kid, and one who could control rocks, and he just… went down, like a lead balloon. He wasn’t hit, he just—” Steve isn’t sure why, but he doesn’t want to hear the end of that sentence. It can’t be that he just went down, something had to have happened, maybe he was hit out of Clint’s line of sight.
It’s not so long ago, that things were… as close to perfect, as Steve ever thought they would get. he had a home. A family to fill it with. He had hope for the future, for the first time in a long,
It’s all he can think to say, for a long time. Tony was pregnant. He doesn’t have to think too hard, to remember back to the last heat they shared. Before everything went to shit. When they were happy, when they actually looked toward the future with hope rather than trepidation. He closes his eyes, and lets out a deep breath. The fact that Tony’s here, in Italy, for at least a week, if he plans to stay through his heat means that… the prognosis isn’t good. Steve clears his throat, and he’s damn proud of himself, for his voice not cracking with the sob that he’s trying to hold back.
After his night with Steve, Tony had retreated to the main base of operations in The Hunt's safezone. He knew that if he skipped a meeting and went straight back to Logan, back home, he'd get an earful from Pepper and probably protective custody from Clint - because that was a thing. They thought one of their own was threatened, they were detained in the safehouse until the storm had passed, even if there wasn't a storm and it was only a one night stand. Well, a one night stand that was meant to turn into something more, if Steve's request for another chance meant anything. Tony wants to assume they did.
Steve's crumpled into the bed, and full on sobbing, when the phone goes off, a tinny, shrill ring, that cuts through him, leaving what feels like an open, exposed hole in his chest. He wonders briefly, if he might just be hallucinating, if it could just be wishful thinking so strong that it's causing him to break from reality. He whines softly, and reaches out for it, anyway, taking a moment to be comforted by the vibration he definitely feels, before flipping it open in one smooth move.
"I love you too," he says quietly, leaning forward to rest his head against Steve's chest. "You weren't responsible for this, Steve. And I know you would've been a great dad if...if either of us had known, and it had gone differently" Steve smiles softly, thinking of Peter, and his excess of energy, trying to take care of Tony who’s got to be hands down, the worst patient Steve’s ever met. It’s amusing, but he feels a little guilty for smiling at it. Tony’s next words cut straight through him, more than he would have expected, and he shoves the feeling to the side, violently, vowing to spend as little time thinking about it, as possible.
“nothing new. He’s working on it. Apparently the UN is pretty close to a deal, they’re offering amnesty to Barton, Lang, and Nat, but they’re… not budging on me and Bucky.” He knows the reason they’re not relenting. He knows that they’re wanting at least one of them to take the fall for the whole ‘Civil War’, but he and Bucky have talked it to death. They’re not selling each other out, not after all of this. Steve suspects that the answer might be different, if Bucky… if /anyone knew that Tony was pregnant, but that’s… not something he wants to think about right now. “Hey. It’s ok. There’s still time, alright?”  Tony makes an unconvinced face, but he lets it go for now, picking the hot chocolate back up , and taking a small sip of it.
“I don’t owe you anything. You, or anyone else. New York still exists because of me. I’m the reason that it isn’t a red skull shaped hole in the ground, I’m done. Sir.”
He’s gotten tired, and he can tell that his vision is fading around the edge of his periphery again. maybe this time, if he chases the darkness, he’ll be able to go to sleep, wake up with all of this over, and safe and warm in his bed. Despite the fact that he’s pretty sure the last place he slept was in the lab. He tries to track back what he can remember, but the nurses move him into a different bed, and the world tips and spins on its side, dangerously for a few moments. Yeah. Better to stay still. He needs a fucking drink.
There’s a million things that Steve wants to say, but one thing stands out more than any other. “I’m not the only one keeping secrets, am I?” he says it whisper soft, the words barely making any sound in the space between them, but Tony clearly hears them, if his resulting huff of laughter is any indication.
“I know, Tony. You have every right to be, I’m… I’m sorry. I should have told you about Bucky.” Bucky scoffs, and puts the gun back in his waistband, before crossing his arms over his chest.
Steve’s dreams are disjointed and confusing, somewhere between nightmares, and dreams. He dreams in quick little snapshots, brief segments of things, that flow together much more like a flipbook, than a movie.
good look on him. His face is lax and open and his entire body goes soft. If the feeling of being inside him wasn't enough to push Steve over the edge, looking at him like that would be. Steve stills and his hips stutter in their movement for a moment, while his right hand comes up to cup against Tony's face. his thumb strokes over the high, sculpted cheekbone there, twice, while he stares deeply into animated brown eyes. The moment is overly tender, and Steve knows, as it happens that he's gotten in way too fucking deep, for a one-night stand, but he can't write bring himself to pull away.
outside Pepper's territory - hence why she's sent Clint, maybe not for a mental health check-up so much as ensuring that nobody grabs him on enemy ground - but he turns down anything he's offered. He doesn't particularly want to take home someone who's high, either, which is going to be easier said than done.
Tony lets his legs fall down from around Steve's waist, back down onto the bed so that he's supporting himself more than Steve is supporting him. Steve's asking him something and it's... Entirely too soon to even attempt talking. He focuses on his breathing for a few moments -- even without the reactor, even with all the exercises his doctors have given him, his lungs still aren't as good as they were before Afghanistan. When he thinks he has enough of a hold on himself to form something of a coherent sentence, he reaches up to wrap his arms around Steve, bring him back, closer, because he pulled back and Tony doesn't like it. "Fantastic," he murmurs, blinking his eyes open slowly. "'m fantastic. I love you."
distracting, Tony.”
“But surely his husband could see him?” he puts emphasis on the word husband, raises his eyebrows just enough, so that she understands that he’s asking special permission. Knows that there’s really two conversations going on here, the one that they’re having, and the one hiding just underneath the words they’re speaking. Its taking advantage of a fragile system, and Steve should maybe feel bad about it, but… he needs to see Tony. needs to make sure he’s ok. Famike sighs softly, and picks at a torn corner of Tony’s chart.
Steve doesn’t give him the chance to finish whatever that thought might be, because he’s been guilted by enough military brass, that he knows a dressing down when he hears one.
girls.”  Tony shakes his head softly, and tries to comfort the girl.
A thousand questions run through Steve’s mind, and they all clamber over each other, in a rush to get to the front and get said first. The thing that wins out in the end is possibly the most direct. “you’re still here?” Ed shrugs.
Tony doesn’t get a chance to make a joke, doesn’t get a chance to ask Bucky if he’s come to see about the possibility of a three-way. The second Bucky notices him, he’s crossed the distance between them in two long strides, presses him back against the nearest wall with enough force to knock the back of Tony’s head against it. He doesn’t waste time, uses the short moment of confusion to pull his gun and press the muzzle of the gun under Tony’s chin. One of his arms is flat across Tony’s chest, keeping him pinned where he is. Before Steve has a chance to protest, because he made a distressed noise the second Bucky manhandled Tony, Bucky lowers his voice slightly, but not enough that Steve won’t hear.
Bucky glances over at Tony, like he knows any more about this than Bucky did. Tony shrugs slightly, chooses to sit down in the armchair when Bucky takes one of the spaces beside Steve—despite his brief encounters with drugs, Tony’s area of expertise related more to alcohol and its draws, so he figures it’s best to leave this one for Bucky to field. “Stevie,” he says, low and careful, and Tony might be reading into it too much, but he swears Bucky sounds hurt. He moves to take Steve’s hands in his own, but doesn’t try to make the blonde look at him. “Why didn’t you tell me, doll? You know…Honey, I would’ve helped you, kept you away from it. I don’t…I don’t want you going through what I go through.” Tony tries not to contemplate the very real possibility that his lack of a call for the past three weeks had something to do with this. It seems a little egotistical to think that he drove a guy to drugs, and he figures there’s something bigger that pushed Steve that far, even if the lack of contact aggravated it a little. “What did you take, Steve?” he asks, voice quiet. He’s seen Jessica go through rehabilitation programmes after any falls she has, but he doesn’t know jack-shit about how to help a person other than being there for them.
Tony mumbles something completely incoherent, and even he's not too sure what he's meant to be saying. He presses his face against Steve's hand though, and it takes a considerable effort to not fall straight back asleep with the comfort the gesture provides him. He doesn't kick out though, has enough awareness about him to recognize that he's not in the safehouse, is still in Steve's apartment. He doesn't know how long he's been out for, but it feels like a lot longer than thirty minutes, and he doesn't think there's enough light to suggest that it's morning, but his back's to the window, and Steve always could have shut the blinds.
Tony Armstrong is
Regardless, he chances wrapping his hand around his cock, moaning at the relief that the mere touch alone provides him with. “Think I’m—” He’s cut off by a noise somewhere between a whine and a moan, and the rest of his sentence is just on the cusp of frantic. “Think I’m close, Steve.”
