. “He’s had a really rough life. More than… almost anyone, I would say. He’s still trying to recover; it hasn’t been easy on him.”
A few days go by. The Kingdom is aflutter with the scandal. Steve is accosted by people singing his praises and demanding to shake his hand.
When the arc reactor light dies, Steve leans down, brushing a kiss against Tony’s lips. “We’re meant to be. You’ll see. I promise. Everything will work out. Sometimes you just aren’t ready to hear things, and I wish you hadn’t have found out about your parents like this now, but it’ll be better. We’ll be better. It’s out in the open now. No more secrets.”
A week after, Tony sits in his workshop in the Compound, glaring at the hologram in front of him. He tries to tell himself that it’s okay, he doesn’t
Steve putters around the Mansion, looking for anything to do to make time pass quicker, when Tony finds him.
“Yeah,” Tony breathes. He steps up into his tiptoes, and his lips brush against Steve’s as he says, “You always take care of me, Cap.”
Tony, who survived, who found a way, who discovered time travel so the universe could be whole again. Tony, who willingly sacrificed his life to save everyone else’s, only to be gifted it back by Death herself.
He calls Steve immediately, his pulse rushing through his veins, and tries to temper down his anxiety. He can feel an attack looming on the horizon, but knows that Steve’s okay. That everyone is okay.
They make their way further into the bunker, searching for Zemo, and Tony’s world comes crashing down as soon as the video begins to play.
Tony’s breath hitches and Steve’s hands flex in surprise when saltwater hits his lips. Tony’s crying in his arms, and Steve shushes him, kissing away the tears. He turns Tony around, and his eyelashes are clumped together, eyes bright. He’s beautiful.
It’s not a cure all fix—there’s too much that actually does need to be discussed between the two—but it’s a start.
Tony can tell instantly that Steve is on guard. This is less his boyfriend and more his team leader. He holds in his instant remarks and instead waits for Steve to set the tone of the argument.
“Sir Clint told me what you were doing. Gather those you’ve selected. Do it quiet, but do it quick. We’re working against the clock now.”
He’s free from the public eye in the evening, and he meets Tony in the foyer of the Mansion, still wearing his old dress uniform that he’s been dressed in all day. Tony comes down the stairs in a stunning, Iron Man red tuxedo, and it’s all Steve can do to keep his whimper below Tony’s hearing. Tony’s hair is tousled, like he’s been running his fingers through it—like
Tony takes it with trembling hands, opening it to see a set of beautiful cufflinks. The design is of Steve’s shield, and Tony feels a magma chamber come alive in his stomach at the sheer possessiveness shown by the act.
They head over to the table and Tony lets Steve sit first, pulling his chair out for him. He pulls off the lid to their food. It’s baked salmon, with asparagus and roasted potatoes. Steve takes in the smell wafting up to his nose and feels overwhelmed.
“Shh,” Steve says, shushing Tony. He moves closer, bringing his arm around Tony’s waist, and lifts them both up. He places Tony on his lap, then leans forward, kissing him with all the care in the world. “You’re so important to me, sweetheart,” Steve whispers. “I love you so much. I know things are hard right now, but I need you to trust me, okay? When Bucky is back, we can help him recover. Together, remember? You and I are so strong. We’re meant to be. We’re endgame.”
Stevie leans forward, resting her elbows on the table between them, and reaches out for Toni’s wrist. Toni obliges, and Stevie lifts it to her mouth, kissing along the pulse point while maintaining eye contact with Toni.
Tony sits on the floor, staring at the wall. He doesn’t know how long he zones out, but he’s stopped crying. He feels numb, as if nothing matters anymore.
Steve takes him out to get hot dogs a few days later. Tony laughs when Steve gets a bit of ketchup on his cheek, pointing it out and guffawing when Steve blushes down his neck into his shirt.
Steve stares at the tulip. He can’t tear his eyes away from it. His eyes sting, and he can’t remember the last time he really felt this happy.
“And I would bet anything that, the moment Bucky found out I was alive, he set to work in making sure that I could have you.”
“My beautiful James.” She kisses his nose, rubs her hands down his belly. In another world, another life, he could be the right partner, but his soul has been broken, has been stripped of too much to be the Alpha King she needs. “You may go find your mate.”
Secretary Ross comes to the Compound and formally introduces the Avengers to the Accords. An argument breaks out—because when have the Avengers ever actually gotten along outside of a fight?—and then Steve is leaving with a short, “I have to go.”
“You know what, baby girl?” Stevie says into her neck. “I bet we could make a better lesbian movie, don’t you think? Show off your pretty, pretty thighs around my head. Zoom in on your clit in between my fingers. Capture your chest bouncing up and down while you ride my hand.” The unzipping of her jeans deafens Toni, as loud as it sounds, and Toni lets out a sob when Stevie slides a hand under the band of Toni’s underwear, raking her blue fingernails through the dark curls on Toni’s mound.
Tony leans into his side, tentative at first as if unsure of his welcome. Steve opens his body, letting him settle against Steve’s chest. Tony sips on his hot chocolate and watches the fire as well.
“You got it, Steve,” she giggles. Turning to Tony, she adds, “I love you, babe. Beep me if you need me. I’ll see you for Christmas dinner next week, right? Daddy has been looking forward to it all month.”
Tony’s voice holds a secret to it, like he knows something Steve doesn’t, and Steve wonders at what it could be.
Even still, he can’t help it. Spending forty-six years encased in a block of ice changes your perspective of what
Tony isn’t going to give Steve and their relationship up. No matter how much he’s hurting, he’s going to work tirelessly to stitch them back together.
The tension rises, thick and cloying, and Tony can’t hold back his shock and tears. He feels the anger rising in him, emotions that will consume him in a moment if he lets them.
Toni bites the end of her pencil, looking up from her engineering homework to meet Stevie’s warm blue gaze. There’s a spot of paint high up on Stevie’s cheek. Toni wants to wipe it off with her tongue.
“Hey, Tony,” Steve says. His voice is awkward, too high pitched in the middle, and his shoulders are drawn in on himself. He looks like a man who’s been down on his luck, and no matter what they’re relationship is, Tony wants nothing more than for Steve to be happy.
Natasha comes striding in as soon as the doors open, her gaze hard but concerned, and takes one look at the phone in his hand before her face crumples.
Steve’s birthday is in two days and he’s absolutely dreading it. It’s his second birthday in the future—his second birthday without Bucky—and Steve hates having to live without him.
“Why bother, then?” Tony asks. His mood shifts, so fast he almost has whiplash, and the anger explodes like a volcano. His anger drowns out the alcoholic fuzz, like a spray of cold water, and he seethes. “No one asked you to help me. You don’t owe me anything. I thought I was doing you a favor by getting out of your hair. Why are you even trying to take care of me?”
Janet, Tony’s best friend, just gets this small, secretive smile on her face, her eyes laced with sadness and happiness both.
Tony finds Steve in the gym, pounding away at the reinforced punching bag Tony had made for him, and can’t help but take in the sweat gleaming down his back and his forehead. The tears streaming down Steve’s face, though—that’s new.
“I do,” Tony replies, and the answer is stated so plainly and rings with such truth that Steve feels it down to his
“Steve?” Tony enters, silent, and lays a hand on Steve’s back. “Steve, baby. Talk to me. What happened?”
Steve’s response is immediate. “Tony, what are you talking about? We can still work this out. This doesn't have to end. We'll figure out something. I'll make it up to you. I promise. I told you, we’re going to make it out of this together. We have to.
Pepper finds him and two empty bottles two hours later. She sits next to him, quiet, and it takes Tony too long to realize why that’s bad.
“Listen—” Steve starts, his stance shifting. He takes a deep breath, and his eyes get a glint to them Tony’s come to associate with Captain America, not Steve Rogers. “I was wrong in not trusting you. I should have done better. The team should have done better. You’ve proven to us time and time again that you deserve to be trusted and that you have nothing but the best of intentions for us all. We take advantage of that—of
His outfit is more relaxed than normal—those jeans have to be Natasha’s work—and Tony tries not to let his eyes drift to the bulge in front. Steve’s shirt is a simple Henley, dark blue and tight across the biceps, and Tony resists a shiver.
It’s quiet on the drive to Tony’s place, and then Tony is pulling into an underground garage. The two of them step out and Tony locks the car, turning to face Steve as he comes around the front of the car.
“I’m your team leader. You’re under my responsibility. You know this. I should’ve been the first person to know about this. Why did Ross go to you and not me, anyway?”
Tony walks to the throne, stopping only a few feet from the chair. The man’s gaze is like a brand on Tony’s skin, claiming everything that he is for the King’s use.
When they wake up the next morning, they find out they don’t have to stage a breakout anyway. Tony is relieved just as much as he’s angry.
“When we found out you were alive, it took a while, but he told me that…” Tony bites his lip, glancing to the side, and then seems to come to a decision within himself. He tilts his head just the slightest to the side, his eyelashes fluttering against his smooth skin as he looks back up at Steve. “He told me that, one day, you would take care of me, too.”
Stevie finally wins her fight against the lock and gestures for Toni to enter. Toni’s steps are measured as she places her laptop and bag on the desk next to Stevie’s bed. As always, the room is impeccable in its tidiness, and Toni feels out of place with her cropped band tee and ripped jeans. She isn’t pristine, not like Stevie—Stevie, whose full face of makeup and sunflower dress both leave Toni with clammy hands and sticky thighs.
The scent stays intense, stays overpowering and wonderful, but the call does not accompany it. Toni pets Natasha's ear, strong and sure, and says, “You may go find your mate.”
President Ellis appoints Lieutenant General Thaddeus “Thunderbolt” Ross to Secretary of State on May third. The same day, Tony goes to MIT for a presentation meant to showcase his newest technological breakthrough, Binarily Augmented Retro-Framing. He hasn’t yet shown it to Steve. He wants to surprise him. He knows how important Bucky is to Steve, and he will do anything for Steve’s happiness.
The silence is more comfortable, but anticipation builds, the edge of the precipice they’re on looming closer and closer. He knows his next question will change everything, but he has to ask.
Toni beckons to Natasha first. The red wolf stalks forward, snout pressing into Toni’s covered stomach as soon as she can reach. Toni reaches down and places her hand on Natasha’s head, the fur soft. “Let me know you.”
Tony swallows. It’s too much for him. He doesn’t deserve to have Captain America of all people telling him he’s worthy of anything.
Tony lets himself chuckle, and then he laughs, the sound bursting from his throat hysterically until he’s sobbing into his knees. Steve is silent on the other end, and Tony can picture the expression he’s making perfectly.
Steve has been the Royal Baker since his mother passed when he was eighteen. He’s been diligent in his work, ensuring all the pastries and desserts placed before King Anthony are temperature appropriate, high quality, and fresh. It’s been the one thing that Steve allows himself to feel pride over, especially when the King comes to the kitchen in the middle of the night to ask Steve for his special cookies.
from his mistakes. All his life, all Tony has tried to do is correct his mistakes. From selling weapons to the black market, to Obie, to providing technology to SHIELDRA for their Insight Program, to the Mandarin, to Ultron, to Pepper, to—
It’s mid-October and the two of them are sitting under one of the trees on the Compound grounds. Natasha holds a packet of blueberries in her hand, eating one at a time, while Tony nibbles on a peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
The woman—Janet—has a gigantic grin on her face. She clutches Steve’s hand between hers, and then leans up, kissing the air next to his cheeks. “Hi! Steve Rogers, right? It’s awesome to meet you! Tony and Nat have told me so much, like, wow. Give me your communicator, let me give you my number, and we can hang out more! I was just about to leave so I can’t stay.”
With a final rub of his thumb against Steve’s tingle fingers, Tony withdraws his hand and picks up his fork instead, glancing up at Steve once again with a smile on his lips.
Steve has heard so many things since unthawing. How HYDRA didn’t actually die with him. How Howard was actually working directly under the Red Skull. How Howard’s son—
Tony breathes in, holding it for four seconds, and then slowly releases it. “I need you to come home. Now. I need to see you.”
The fire pops in front of them and it draws Steve’s attention. The flames flicker, the emanating heat seeping into his skin.
He holds himself together long enough to see Thor off, to leave Cap, to joke and laugh and pretend he’s okay, and then he’s back at Stark Tower—just his now, not the Avengers Tower, never again—crawling into his empty lab, where the movers haven’t yet been able to retrieve all of his items from the Compound. Alone, he opens up a cabinet, pulling out a bottle of whiskey.
“Okay, you have to try this. It’s so good. Come on, don’t be shy,” Tony goads, spooning off a piece and holding it out for Steve.
“Oh, um, thank you, but I—I can’t get drunk,” Steve says. His fingertips are tapping against his thigh and he can’t help that his eyes are darting across the table, looking everywhere except at Tony.
None of the other Avengers find it odd. Natasha smirks, but stays silent even when pressed. Clint cackles hysterically, then wanders off to find Lucky. Carol gives him this
So when Head Advisor to the King Obadiah Stane gives the sad and shocking news that the King has fallen ill of the mind, Steve is positive that something is going on.
He looks at the burner phone, placed on the floor just a foot away from him. It’s taunting, a presence to it so strong that Tony finds himself reaching for it hundreds of times over the week. He laughs, hiccuping, and then realizes his hands are shaking.
Tony’s eyes drop to the table. A blush rises to his cheeks, and he nods, like he doesn’t know how to respond.
He nods and Steve beams back at him, walking forward and stopping just in front of Tony, holding out a pair of cufflinks. They’re of the reactor, the very first one from Afghanistan, and it doesn’t take Tony long to realize that Steve painted them himself.
“It’s still stigmatized, don’t get me wrong, but it’s… not nearly as bad as it used to be. You can’t be arrested for it anymore, for one. Not in New York.”
You must understand why I couldn’t let him do that. My only regret is how long it took me to find you off the streets.”
Tony’s smile dims. He tilts his head, a considering look crossing his face, and says, “Yeah. A boyfriend. I thought that was common knowledge around SHIELD?”
The sound of a door opening reverberates around him and he closes his eyes, trying not to let his sobs escape his lips.
“You underestimate how wonderful you smell, my Queen. The Alphas have surely already gathered at the Circle.”
The empty pack lands on the ground next to his leg. Steve opens the phone, trembling with repressed emotion. A promise of return, a promise of love, a promise of connection. That’s what this phone had been meant to represent. A secure, open line to reach Steve, no matter the time, after Steve had fled for Wakanda.
Tony sighs, glancing up at her, and nods his head. “Tomorrow,” he says, his tone final. “We all need to sleep first.”
Bucky averts his eyes from Steve’s gaze and doesn’t say anything else. But it’s enough confirmation for Steve. Bucky knows something is wrong, too.
Cap picks him up and Tony cries in protest, his forehead pounding with the movement. Cap is gentle, sticking to the darker hallways instead of the ones next to the bright, untinted windows. They finally reach a room, and Cap unlocks the door, shouldering it open. He walks straight to the bathroom, depositing Tony in the bathtub, and Tony grins up at him. Cap starts to tug Tony out of his clothing.
Steve inclines his head, and it seems as if that’s all the confirmation Bruce needs. He whips into action, racing over to King Anthony’s side. Bruce grasps the King’s wrist. Lays the back of his hand over the King’s forehead. Leans in close to listen to his breathing.
“Tony,” Steve breathes, astonishment and hope flickering in his gaze. “I knew you would come. I don’t know what I would do if I didn’t have you.”
“I didn’t think you would let me sign,” Tony says. Silence follows his proclamation, but then Tony’s voice goes low, a dull whisper, “I’m sorry I didn’t come to you. I just… I thought that this was the best course. We need to be put in check. What if something like Ultron happens again? I wouldn’t survive it a second time, Steve. I barely survived the first.”
Tony nods his head, sniffling, and turns around in the circle of Steve’s arms. Steve thrills at the movement, how Tony doesn’t try to get away. Tony selects a different record, and he switches out the current one with the new.
“I can’t do this right now, Steve,” he manages to say. “Let’s talk it out after the whole business with the Accords is over. Can we do that? Please?”
He doesn’t remember the Soul World. Not really. Steve recalls an endless sea of red, nothingness stretching on for eternity. There were other people there, he thinks. But even thinking of that makes his head feel like exploding, and he has to stop.
Tony refuses to let himself think of the date. Refuses to think of how he wishes he could spend today of all days somewhere else, just him and Steve, wrapped around each other with smiles and laughter echoing in the air around them.
Sometimes, the only heat that they’d had in the winter months had been from what their bodies shared; and yet, Bucky had promised Steve that, someday, the two of them would run away and find a better place, where it could just be the two of them, happy and free.
Stevie laughs, hiding her teeth behind her hand. Toni’s never understood why Stevie doesn’t like showing her teeth when she’s happy. She’s beautiful inside and out.
He wakes up with the sun blaring into his eyes, the taste and smell of his own breath making him gag.
A candle flickers to life in Steve’s head, and he nods, the action more by rote than anything else. The muffins are placed on a plate, artfully arranged around the platter of cheeses and meats from Sir Chef. At last, Steve heads for the King’s chambers.
Numbness fills the void left by the King’s words. Tony has been so careful. He hasn’t told a soul where he’s from. For all the King
“No, Tony,” the voice continues. “I’m not leaving you like this. If I had thought letting you leave the compound would cause you to self-destruct like this, I would have locked you in a room. This isn’t—I can’t believe—Damnit, Tony.”
“How can you really expect me to still be here waiting for you, Steve?” Tony mutters, trying to calm the raging inferno storm inside him. He knows it’s not Steve’s fault. He knows it’s his own failings that have led to this situation. He just has to tell Steve. “I’m—I’m not okay. I’m struggling. I have tried so hard to be here for you, to support you, all while you have been off for weeks at a time with no communication, no way for me to track you, and I—I can’t do this anymore, Steve. I can’t. I feel like I’m playing second fiddle to Bucky. I just… can’t do this anymore.”
Tony holds his wrist in his hand. He refuses to let Steve knock him over, like a leaf caught in a breeze.
“Captain!” Tony smiles. “It’s wonderful to see you. Here, let’s go sit down,” he offers, gesturing to a booth. “Oh! This is my best friend, Janet Van Dyne. You might have heard of her as the Wasp?”
He finds a promising restaurant and goes in. Steve scans the room—a leftover habit that he’s never bothered to grow out of—and double takes at the sight of Howard Stark’s son standing at the bar with a woman, talking to the waitress.
But Tony doesn’t act like he’s taken with Steve. When Steve hugs him, Tony leans in, tilting his head to the side to let Steve nuzzle his beard into Tony’s throat.
What Steve would give to be able to erase those past five years. What he would do to rewind time. But this is his punishment. His recompense to the universe. Live in the future, again and again, losing years at a time, losing people, losing love. Peggy had been his first. Tony his second.
The lighting doesn’t change. Tony lays his hand over his eyes, remembers JARVIS’s death, and feels his heart break all over again.
Their relationship is in tatters. Steve openly glares at Tony during meetings. He passes by him in the hallways with quick, measured steps, refusing to meet his gaze. His jaw is locked in anger more often than not, and it continues to build.
“My friends and my mom already know my feelings—or lack thereof—toward men. I don’t much care what other people have to say.” Stevie leans back in the chair, her hands crossing in a stretch above her head. Toni tries not to stare at Stevie's puffed out chest. “It’ll be fun. You can spend the night. I’ve got some gummies we can have, or if you don’t want that, we can get into Nat’s Tobaritch. We can watch a movie about cute lesbians. Maybe,” and here a twinkle shines in Stevie’s eyes, giving away the teasing words next to come, “maybe we even make out a bit. I could watch that pretty blush spread across your chest.”
“This isn’t right,” he whispers to Bucky. “I saw him two nights ago. There isn’t anything wrong with him, Bucky.”
Steve enters, his eyes glancing around the lab—whether leftover from Ultron, or just simply something he’s begun to do since visiting the labs more often—and then settling on Tony.
“Maybe you can find your own happiness. Something you deserve that doesn't rely on anyone else. Just you.”
The leaf hits the ground, resting so soft and careful on the grass. Just like there is nothing left for the leaf, Tony knows there's nothing left for him and Steve.
He doesn’t tell Steve—not right away. He shakes, the encounter underneath the MIT auditorium still vibrant in his mind.
“If the Alpha is smart at all, they’ll know I don’t want that.” Toni’s breath hitches as Janet’s fingertip bumps against a particularly sensitive spot. “How long do I have to wait for them?”
They head out and slip into Tony’s car, which had been parked on the side of the street next to the restaurant’s entrance. There’s a slip of paper on the windshield, and Tony doesn’t even glance at it before folding it and putting it in his pocket.
, lighting up and bursting with a completed connection. Two halves of the same soul recognize the other as what they truly are, completing a forgotten circuit and leaving tears in his eyes.
Warmth flows up his back, and it doesn’t take his genius intellect to recognize super soldier body heat less than an inch from his body. A hand reaches for his hip, resting there, and the contact lights a fire up his spine.
Janet kisses along Toni’s neck. “Don’t worry about that. You just let yourself feel good, and I’ll do the rest. That’s what I’m here for.”
“He’s getting better! He’s just not ready for a lot of things. It’s slow progress, but he’s worth it.”
. The goat is the runt of the pack, smaller than all the rest by leagues, yet has the strongest attitude.
He stands up, a flawless motion that somehow doesn’t disturb the birds on his shoulders, and reaches for a stack of papers. He holds them in his fist, rolled up into tight tubes, and then flickers his sharp eyes over to Steve.
Bing Crosby echoes around the rooftop. Steve closes his eyes, resting his cheek on top of Tony’s head, and sways them to the beat. They dance in small, slow circles, and Steve lets himself cry when the last line,
Instead, he’s been given this life. Travelling the world, alone, always alone. No best friend. No husband.
It’s like thousands upon thousands of tiny hints slot into place at once, like the world suddenly has righted itself after years of being off balance.
Stevie takes it for what it is and dives in, pushing Toni back onto the bed and crawling over her as their lips crash together. Toni whimpers in response, at the mercy of whatever Stevie wants, giving herself over without question.
The first drag in his lungs is like fire scorching. He watches the goats, holds in the nicotine for minutes on end. Blows the smoke out in silence. Time passes, the sun rising in the sky.
He knows his drinking wasn’t the cause of Ultron—knows he was manipulated by Wanda, by his hubris, his arrogance—but drinking has always been an indulgence, something that helps him to forget, and Tony… doesn’t deserve to forget what he did. The people he's murdered deserve better than to have Tony’s guilt over their deaths drowned out by a haze of alcoholic peace.
“A pocket of happiness, huh?” Tony's laugh is void, empty of emotion, and Natasha's smile is shaky. “What I would give to go back.”
The Royal Head of Staff approaches him, a tall and imposing woman named Pepper. She guides him to the King’s chambers once again. The guards from before have been removed—Natasha and Thor stand sentry instead.
“There's nothing wrong with that, Tony. Your relationship ended, and it was a beautiful, tragic little pocket of happiness you carved out for yourself, crushed irreparably.”
The bruise on his eye is still painful but he tries to ignore it. He walks around, scanning for heat signatures, and eventually finds two.
“I got you another gift.” There’s a rustle of fabric and then Steve is sliding his other hand around Tony’s waist, holding up a small box. “Open it.”
, that should not look as enticing as it does, not on an American Symbol™ like Captain America. Tony blinks, mouth gaping just a bit too much to be attractive. “Hey, sweetheart,” Steve croons.
Steve and he are cuddling in bed that night, and Steve’s hand is just so tender over his chest, over his scars. His thoughts from earlier echo in his head, overwhelming in their intensity, and the emotions burst out from him, unbidden.
Steve shushes Tony. His voice is weary, but even still Tony can hear the bit of happiness—because nothing makes Steve happier than knowing Tony needs him—shining through.
“You told me he spent years being tortured, Tony. And you told me you’ve been dating him for five and a half years? You’ve been working to terminate the mind control, and it was HYDRA who had him, wasn’t it? I bet—” Realization slams into his head and he cuts himself off with a sharp gasp. “You’re the one who rescued him, aren’t you? You—You brought him back. You’re helping him recover.”
He could get past Bucky killing his mom. Mind control is strong and overbearing, and there’s no way that Bucky could have done differently. He doesn’t blame him.
Steve nips at her neck. At her bonding gland. Is gentle for all of a moment before he bites down, releasing her essence onto the forest floor.
When they arrive at Stevie’s dorm, Toni shuffles from foot to foot. She knows she isn’t doing anything wrong, but years of denying a fundamental part of herself have left a stain on her.
The cigarettes in the pack dwindle. His lungs scream, but his brain floats, a false calm overtaking his everything.
That tone is familiar. He keeps his eyes closed, trying not to throw up his lunch again—What did he even eat last? Has he eaten recently? How long has he been like this?—but he shoves the questions aside, his hand cradling his stomach instead.
It doesn’t matter now. Nothing matters. Tony hadn’t said yes. The rejection had sat sour in the depths of Steve’s soul.
. He follows Tony unseeing up the stairs, and it takes him a moment to zero in on his surroundings when they enter the main room. His eyes catch on the giant fireplace in the corner, a pile of pillows and blankets placed in front of it. The fire is already roaring.
“Here,” Tony whispers. He pulls over a blanket, soft and heavy and warm, and wraps it around Steve’s shoulders. His fingers brush against Steve’s neck and he shivers.
Steve misses the 1930s. He misses the 1940s, when, if he felt too cold, he could just fit himself against Bucky’s side, and Bucky would throw one of his massive arms over Steve’s waist, pull him close to his furnace-hot chest, and hold Steve tight.
screaming in her ears. But it’s quiet, like it holds the potential but hasn’t been actualized. Toni knows it could grow if she fosters it, but James rolls to his belly in front of her, and that’s not what Toni needs. Not from her mate.
The phone looks up at him. Accuses him of always failing, of being too late, of being out of time. Isn’t that what Loki called him, all those years ago? The Soldier Out of Time.
, the old music store down the street from Bucky and Steve’s Brooklyn apartment. Tony’s deft hands move with precision, placing a record down with care, and he puts the needle into place.
“I heard a rumor.” The tenor of the King’s voice reverberates, like a sledgehammer to Tony’s helmet, loud and damning in his ears. “Whispers of an uprising out west, in the forgotten ruins of Manhattan’s far borders. It appears as if the citizens there believe their Prince to still be alive. That he’s been living in Brooklyn in secret to gain the King’s favor before chopping off his head.” The King pauses. A heavy weight pushes against his body, trying to send him to the ground, to lie prostrate. “You wouldn’t happen to know anything about this, would you?”
“Mmmm… Our anniversary is coming up soon, actually. Christmas, if you can believe it,” Tony chuckles. “It’ll be five years.”
“I’ve always belonged to Buck, even before we knew what we were,” Steve says. “And one thing has always been true through the years: Bucky seemed to know what I wanted, what I needed, before I even had a stray thought about it. He would give me anything I wanted if he could but do it.”
It’s been ten years since his parents died, ending the war and leaving him an orphan. After two years of fighting tooth and nail for a scrap of meat, a slice of bread, a blanket to sleep under—Tony Carbonell never expected to be taken in by the King of Brooklyn. Then again, he never thought he would abandon the
“None may enter.” The guard is too big, too wide, his teeth sharpened unnaturally. “We will deliver the King his food.”
Tony turns away when he sees Steve reach out for him, trying to get over the disagreement between the two of them, but he can see in Steve’s eyes that he isn’t going to apologize for what he said. He knows Steve feels shame for his words if only for the way that their relationship changes at night.
Tony holds Steve for what feels like hours, and he barely hears it when Steve finally manages to get out, “She’s gone.”
Drinking is a weakness of the mind, meant to give him relief from his real life issues. After last night, he knows he doesn’t deserve that peace.
The relief there is a slap to the face. He can already tell what Steve is thinking. He knows Steve; he knows how Steve views their relationship. He knows that Steve thinks the secret coming to light will clear the air between them. Will set him free from having to hide something so crucial from Tony.
The clang of metal against metal jars the atmosphere of the room. It’s like it knows something is coming. Like it knows Tony isn’t long for this world.
, Steve. Sometimes they’re all I can think of when I’m listening to Obie drone on and on about the war effort.”
When they drop Peter off at his aunt’s and Happy leaves, Tony stands inside the Compound, empty and dark, and hates every second of it.
. The plume of Steve’s confession settles for a moment and his eyes meet Tony’s—begging, hopeful, and all wrong.
The smash against his head, the bleak darkness, coming to, only to watch as Thanos disappeared in a portal with a stunned Thor left standing bereft—
“I loved you, Steve. I would have done anything in the world for you. But we both know we can’t come back from this. There isn’t anything left for us. We’re—We’re done.”
die), is on a constant loop in his mind. By trying to save the Avengers, he murdered one hundred seventy-seven people in Sokovia alone. Every kill done by Ultron or one of Ultron’s bots is on his head and his head alone.
Tony walks away and Steve jolts, seeing a record player sitting on an old stand. He can tell even from here that it’s old, but well taken care of, and not a replica. Steve could see it easily sitting in the front window of
He gets back to the Compound late that evening. He’s in the middle of taking off his jacket when he gets caught on his cufflinks, staring at the shield design. Claiming him. Protecting him.
. The young singer’s voice had begun to croon out into their apartment, and Bucky had swung Steve around, his large hands almost completely wrapping around Steve’s waist. Steve remembers he had reached up, slinging his arms around Bucky’s neck, and had listened as he sang along to the lyrics to Steve.
Tony’s boyfriend’s name is a secret. Tortured for years, he had experiments run on him, part of his body made into a
“I have an inkling that, if you’re stuck in ice for a couple decades, you don’t handle the cold very well.”
Steve’s words begin to blur; each vocalization is present in Tony’s mind, and he knows they’re meant to be words, but the meaning is gone, stripped from Tony’s mind into a string of useless sounds. Tony feels himself begin to cry as Steve gets off the ground, walks over to Bucky, and helps him stand up with a grunt.
In the morning, Steve bakes the blueberry muffins that King Anthony enjoys so much during breakfast. The Head Chef, a tiny man reeking of anxiety, cooks breakfast for the King, and when Steve offers to take it up, the Chef fidgets for a moment before nodding his head. “Don’t go stealing any bites. These have medicine in them to help the King’s condition.”
The liquor cabinet is full, too, and Tony opens it carelessly. He doesn’t even know what he’s grabbing until he’s on the floor, draining the bottle dry. Natasha’s favorite vodka slides down his throat, and Tony’s hands tremble.
He reads the letter, staring at the words while his hands shake. He breathes in, trying to find it in himself not to cry, and then sits in the chair with a huff.
“We need to find a way to break everyone out,” she mentions, careful of her words. “I can’t stand the idea of them locked away. Not now that we know the truth.”
“No,” he whispers. Natasha slides her hand over, catching his in her grip, and refuses to let go. “I don't think I would.”
into Toni, and her knees go weak, the overpowering scent of an Alpha like a geyser of sensation to Toni’s brain. It’s so much, and it takes a moment for Toni to expose herself to it, to see if that ancient call of
“You want to watch a film about lesbians having to hide who they really are? Don’t you get enough of that in your real life?”
Steve and Tony eat their meal accompanied by quiet conversation. Steve laughs at Tony’s commentary, and Tony gasps, dramatic, when Steve retells old Commando stories. Before long, their plates are empty. The record has long since gone silent.
! And then you—you—you—you hide this big of a secret from me for our whole relationship? And you think I can just… just forgive you for that? No.
Tony lowers himself. Bends his knee. Bows his head. Holds back the quivering of his bones. “Yes. This I do swear.”
“Tony, stop!” Steve tries to command, but Tony is done. He’s not going to listen to anything that Steve has to tell him. Not anymore.
“You’re my teammate, Tony,” Cap says, his voice low. “You’re under my command. You’re mine. You shouldn’t have to suffer through your guilt alone.”
But he gave his blood, his sweat, his tears—he gave everything he was, every atom of his existence, to the fight. To the cause. To being a good soldier. A good man.
He staggers to the kitchen. Even with the Avengers having moved to the Compound, there’s still the occasional need to stay here, and Tony has JARVIS keep the fridge full just in case.
, and was even mind controlled. Tony was working on a method to break it, but so far, the two of them have been playing it safe and keeping his boyfriend’s identity need to know.
Tony can’t move. With the power in the suit completely drained, he’s immobile, and Tony feels the tears crystallize on his face.
King Anthony is asleep, his face drawn and pallid. The fire is roaring across from the bed, keeping the room toasty for the King’s pleasure.
The two of them make their way over to the booth. Tony calls over his shoulder to the waitress, ordering a chocolate cream pie, and then sits down across from Steve.
He wraps his arms around Tony’s middle, practically crawling into his skin, and rests his head against Tony’s, his lips turned into Tony’s cheek.
Tony pauses for a moment, and Steve can see the anxiety crawling up his back. He places a hand against Tony’s nape, leaning his chest against Tony’s side, and Tony shudders in a breath.
Tony’s smile is sympathetic and understanding, and he reaches his hand across the table, rubbing his thumb across Steve’s knuckles.
“This was going to be our wedding song,” Steve confesses, and his tone holds a hint of reverence to it that has everything to do with Bucky. “We couldn’t get married, not back then, but we always thought… Maybe we could go off to some little spot of land, maybe in the country, and have a ceremony between just the two of us. We could profess our love before God and have a private wedding.”
Janet laughs even as her unoccupied hand circles one of Toni’s nipples. “What do you think the Alpha you choose is going to do?
“As you wish, Sir Doctor.” The guard looks put out, but he opens the door, and Steve finally is allowed inside.
His paws, giant and menacing, land on either side of her shoulders as his belly fur brushes against her spine. She didn’t even see him move, the heat haze commanding her every movement.
She calls upon Sam, next, a quiet Alpha with a sweet disposition. He greets her with a lick to her palm, polite as always, and sits in front of Toni as she utters the words to break the spell once again.
The King’s grip loosens all at once, but his eyes stay hard, calculating. His gaze flickers down to the rest of Tony’s body, taking in the reds and golds of Brooklyn’s finest knight.
Manhattan will never be avenged. The throne will sit, unoccupied, abandoned, for the rest of eternity.
“Your pre-heat started.” The comment is unnecessary, but Toni appreciates it anyway. It lets Toni know she’s still in a stable sense of mind.
He cuts himself off as he actually takes Steve in, his mind short circuiting for a moment. The old fashioned Army dress uniform is
When the Avengers hang out at the Mansion, Tony crawls into Steve’s lap like it’s normal, like he’s expected to sit there, like it’s
Tony bites his lip and shoves his face into Steve’s chest. An instant wet spot begins to form on his uniform, but Steve can’t be bothered to care. He rubs his hand up and down Tony’s back, and whispers, awed, “I can never thank you enough for saving him, Tony. I could never hate you for this. You’re—You’re
“It’s okay, baby girl. I’mma take care of you. I’ve got you. You don’t need these baggy jeans anyway. I’ll get you some pretty ones to show off your legs and ass. You’ll be irresistible to all the boys, won’t you? But they won’t ever get a taste. Won’t ever get what I do. Isn’t that right, honey? You’re all mine, aren’t you?”
He’s twenty-one now, the day of his majority having passed a scant month ago. Tony remembers when the King had taken Tony in off the streets, just two years after his parents had died. The young King had greeted Tony with a kind hand, with a soft smile, with welcoming blue eyes. It’s been an absolute truth in Tony’s world that someday, somehow, the King would demand for Tony to repay that kindness.
Wealth, prosperity, fortune, and, most importantly, friendship. Love, pride, and admiration. Strength of character, faithfulness, honor, and remembrance.
adding a layer of whimsical happiness to the atmosphere. Tony tilts his head, like he’s listening with a renewed sense of energy, and Steve reaches a hand up, cupping Tony’s face with his palm.
His commanding voice screams inside her head. This is what Toni needs in an Alpha King. She may be the Omega Queen, may possess the highest status within the pack, but Steve
The King’s eyes lock onto Tony’s. “Do you swear to live your life in service to me? To serve no other King, to serve no other Kingdom?”
“Hey, soldier,” Tony greets as soon as Steve opens the door. “Fancy going on a date today? I’m—What are you wearing?”
Steve stares in wonder, as if all his dreams have come true, and then somehow manages to stagger his way to Tony’s bedside.
“Have you ever been here? Fundamentally Blue is incredible. Ashley, the waitress over there, is the owner. She’s great; you should talk to her when you can. Even though this is a diner, they have a brewery in the back, and everything on their drinks menu is to
Bracing himself, he puts up walls and blocks his emotions as much as he can. He’s here to do a job. He’s here to protect Steve. He can’t let Steve suffer. Even as their relationship falters—despite every ounce of pain and regret between them—Tony knows in his soul that he and Steve can make it through this if they both try. He told Steve he would try.
Steve’s eyes crease in confusion and anger, and Tony sits up, meeting him head on. “Tony, you know how important to me Bucky is. You haven’t had any issues waiting for me to come home before. Why is it different now? What’s changed?”
Stevie’s body shakes with repressed laughter, but she doesn’t respond. Time passes, and as they end the climax of the movie, Toni comes to the sudden realization that Stevie’s fingertips are skirting the edge of Toni’s jeans. She leans up, just enough to see Stevie’s face, and doesn’t stop herself from glancing down at the pretty pink lip gloss along Stevie’s lips. “Stevie?”
“Yeah,” he concedes, if for no other reason than to put an end to this farce. “It’s okay, Cap. We’ll get through it—together.”
He can’t force words out of his mouth. He can’t get himself to say anything, and Natasha seems to understand, and he doesn’t acknowledge the tears falling from her eyes.
“If you wanted to keep it while I was gone, all you had to do was ask, Tony. Hold on to that. I’ll be back for it—and for you—soon. I swear. Wait for me.”
Clint waits for him on a smattering of hay, Redwing and Lucky nestled into his shoulders. The birds both turn beady eyes Steve’s way, but Clint whistles and they settle against him without complaint.
He has to spend his morning and afternoon participating in Fourth of July celebrations. It may be his birthday, but it’s Independence Day, too, and Captain America holds a duty to his country.
He remembers in 1939, he and Bucky had been just goofing off, as young men are wont to do, and Bucky had put on the record for a new popular song from
“Memories can be good things, Cap. Don’t ever apologize for getting lost in them. You of all people deserve that happiness.”
The five Alphas of her pack await her approach. Agatha, the pack’s Witch, has laid an enchantment on them to help Toni choose without interference.
. Like he’s coming to terms with the fact that he’s screwed up their relationship so badly that Tony isn’t going to forgive him.
The talk between them is quiet and warm, familiar in a way that Steve’s addicted to. Eventually, Tony lays a hand on his bicep, tilting his head to look into Steve’s eyes, and asks, “Do you want to spend your birthday with me?”
“I feel so—so—so fucking guilty all the time, Nat,” Tony says. “And it’s ridiculous why! I feel so relieved that I’m free from him, and I hate it. I hate it so much.”
Tony holds tight to Natasha's hand in his, breathing in the crisp autumn air, and waits for his new beginning.
, but his voice is confident. He sounds so sure of himself, and yet each word that he says is like a dagger in Tony. “We’ll be okay. We’re endgame, remember? We’ll make it through. We’ll be okay. We have to be okay. Okay? We have to.”
Steve hesitates a moment longer, reaching out for Tony, and Tony yells again, shoving himself out of the room, passing Steve with not even a backwards glance.
He calls the only contact in the phone. It rings in his ear, and an almost imperceptible click graces his world. He doesn’t say anything. Just waits.
Her grip on his hand tightens. The air is filled with the scent of alcohol, heady and overpowering, and silence descends between them.
Fuck, but Steve had screamed, had cried, had begged God to show mercy on his soul. Had pleaded for nothing less than to make up for all his past mistakes to Tony.
“Then answering me should not be cause for hesitance.” He pauses, moves his hand along the curve of Tony’s jaw, and cups his cheek. “I’ve let you run amok for long enough. It’s time to give in. You knew this moment was coming.”
He pulls out the two six packs and carries them down to his lab, sits on the floor in the corner of the room, and drinks them all.
“FRI,” he demands, “Order some whiskey. Maybe a crate. Express order. I don’t care how much money they want for it—I want it in an hour.”
She leaves, her shoes in her hands, after helping him up to the old common room. He stumbles onto the couch, falling down face first, and the phantom feeling of Pepper’s fingers trembling where they’d brushed through his hair lingers until he falls asleep.
“Great,” Steve grins. His hand reaches up, and soft fingers—always soft, never calloused, because no matter how much work he does the serum always heals his skin back to baby smooth—drag along his jawline for a moment. The breath in his lungs freezes as Tony looks up to meet Steve’s piercing gaze. “See you soon, Tony.”
The days, weeks, months pass, and each smile that Steve aims at Tony is filled with happiness and joy. A flicker of possession dashes through every once in a while, dark and commanding, but Tony finds that he doesn’t mind. Steve has lost so much in his life. It only makes sense that he would hold what he considers precious close to his chest.
“Come on. You can come back with me. I’ve got this nice, big fireplace. You’ll love it.” Tony steps up out of the booth, his eyes crinkling with his smile.
Tony struggles to believe that Steve could be so cruel as to bring up Ultron again, to say that Tony learned
The Winter Soldier slips from the shadows and stops in front of him. His eyes are made of the coldest ice, guarded from any and all attacks. Tony wishes he could strike him down. The murderer of his parents.
“Steve? Hey, are you okay?” Tony asks, and Steve shakes himself back to the future. Tony is blurry in front of him, and Steve realizes it’s because he’s crying. Steve smiles and wipes off the tears before glancing back at Tony, who’s sitting across from him in his beautiful tuxedo. Tony’s gorgeous brown eyes crinkle with concern.
Stevie bites down on Toni’s nipple at that, right through the thin material of Toni’s crop top. Toni hadn’t bothered to wear a bra today, not with the size of her chest being what it is. Toni’s never been more grateful that she’s a card carrying member of the IBTC.
Eight days go by. The clock and the calendar taunt him, announcing the date like a beacon in the sky, and Tony giggles.
Steve’s breathing is ragged, harsh and violent, and Tony wraps his arms around Steve as he finally breaks, sobbing into Tony’s chest. They fall to the floor in a heap, the musk of the gym surrounding them, and Tony brushes back Steve’s hair, rocking him softly in his arms.
“Will you give me that, baby?” Stevie asks, voice saccharine sweet. “Let me record your pretty pussy while I make you come?”
“My boyfriend isn’t in right now. Sorry I can’t introduce you; I know he’s been dying to see you,” Tony says, his voice filled with remorse.
Stevie’s face drops, expression twisting into something hard. Serious. “No one is going to tell your dad, Toni. I told you he’d never come near you. Especially not this.”
“Come to my dorm tonight, baby.” Toni doesn’t know why Stevie bothers to ask. Toni will do anything Stevie wants.
He loves Steve, more than he loves life itself, but he can’t let Steve bulldoze over his wants. Tony can only give so much of himself before nothing is left.
Tony flinches, his hands flexing where they’ve come to rest on top of Steve’s arms. It’s like he had been expecting a beratement, a
Silence. Tony watches the breeze twirl the changing leaves off the branches. He follows the path of one as it swirls in the air, inching its way closer and closer to the ground, unknowing of what awaits it at the end.
“So you say, Iron Knight.” The King stands, his height towering over Tony even while clad in the Iron Knight armor. “Remove your helmet.”
Steve’s smile drops and he stares at the table. Clenches his hands in his pants. He can feel an awkward air forming between them, and he knows it’s his fault, that he should excuse himself and leave to lick his wounds in peace—
“Sweetheart,” Steve whispers, and he leans down, his nose bumping against Tony’s, “haven’t I been taking care of you since that day at Fundamentally Blue?”
He sits, alone, as the morning breeze tosses the fine tendrils of hair across his forehead. Steve pushes his hand up, running his fingers through the strands. The grounds about his feet surround a forgotten old shack, sequestered at the joining of two rivers. Bleating goats wander around the grass, taking advantage of the enriched soil and vegetation to sustain their simple existences. As the phone flips in his hand, the side button responds to gentle pressure and the screen displays the time.
, and he’s been tortured, experimented on, has been forced to kill thousands of people. He’s being hunted, and Steve is positive it’s HYDRA hunting him, and Steve remembers the mind control.
Steve’s scent wraps her in a cocoon, a protective bubble of scent and safety and love, and Toni falls to her hands, a cry escaping her as her mind
Natasha is a lot like him in that regard. She tries so hard to make everyone happy, and it always seems to blow up in her face.
Their kiss is like coming home, and Steve gathers Tony close, pressing against his lithe frame as much as he can, holding Tony like he might disappear at any moment.
After Ultron, he feels blessed to have Steve by his side. But he’s slowly dying inside, and he needs to say something. Communication is supposed to be key in a relationship, isn’t it?
He might be enraged, infuriated, and hurt by the betrayal she did to him—a decision which led to his best friend being shot down and stuck in a coma in a hospital, most likely never to walk again—but Tony can’t deny, not even to himself, that she did it with nothing but the best of intentions.
As soon as the phone connects, Tony is demanding, “Steve? Steve, are you okay? What happened? Talk to me, baby.”
“People aren’t possessions, Steve,” Tony whispers. Seeing Steve like this kills him. And yet—And yet—Tony can’t let himself feel any sympathy for Steve’s pain. “You don’t get to tell me what I am or am not allowed to do or am going to do.”
No one talks about Natasha letting Steve and Bucky go. Even if Tony is mad at her, he isn’t going to let her go to the Raft.
Tony squeezes his eyes together. He thinks of everything that’s happened between them, of the lies and the kisses and the laughter and the tears. Everything that’s happened between them has left an impact on Tony’s life somehow, and he doesn’t want to let something else fail.
Steve sounds wrecked, as if he’s finally allowing himself to acknowledge that he can’t just bulldoze his way through this
When all is said and done, half of the Royal Court has been either killed or jailed. Zola had caved when presented with Natasha’s terrifying interrogation skills, listing name after name of people that were part of the King’s poisoning. The most shocking of all was Sir Obadiah, the mastermind behind the plan.
Maybe this feeling is something he could live for. Maybe the way his heartbeat quickens when he looks at Tony’s lips, or the way he finds himself smiling in return when Tony does, could help him recover.
“Make fun of me when you’re sober. Have you been like this since you left? It’s been three days, Tony.”
The two of them get situated on the bed. Stevie pulls Toni close, her manicured fingertips grazing against the exposed stomach, and nestles Toni so that she’s resting her head in the hollow of Stevie’s throat. Her natural aroma is strong here, pulling Toni in with each breath.
Toni shifts in her seat, her thighs rubbing together in response to the heated exchange. She hates herself for it, just a little—but, if there were to be anyone that Toni is weak for, it should be Stevie.
“Oh, it’s nothing. A parking ticket. Word to the wise: laws that only have a cash punishment are a punishment to the poor.”
“Have care how you speak, Sir Baker,” Thor responds, his voice loud in the weapon’s room. “King Anthony’s illness is a grave situation for all the Kingdom. I assure you, I am doing everything in my power to be sure he is kept from outside harm.”
“Language, Cap,” Tony giggles. His head vibrates and he groans, trying to press the cool bottle closer to him.
Tony closes his eyes and holds his hand over his chest, rubbing the scars through his shirt. He can’t do anything but accept Steve’s words as the truth.
“I thought you might like something familiar.” He holds out the cookies he’d baked this morning. “They’re not fresh, I’m sad to say, but I made them just this morning.”
Him having lied to Tony is the ultimate betrayal. It’s the last straw that broke the camel’s back of Tony’s second chances.
The movie starts, unassuming and soft, and Toni lets herself get lost in the period fashion and Saoirse Ronan’s eyes. They shine in the sun on the screen, a waterfall of colors cascading within a contained sea.
He walks through the door instead, steps measured as he restrains himself, and doesn’t react when Steve closes and locks the door behind him.
Tony stops. He’s like the wailing wind that’s coursing through the halls; he’s the frigid bite of the ice that lingers inside this cursed, decrepit building. He’s shattered into a million pieces, because Steve
He’s been stripped of his title. Captain America no more. No, that title belongs to Bucky now. Bucky always should have been Captain America, really. What is Steve but a kid from Brooklyn that couldn’t walk away from a fight?
In the vase sits four different flowers. There’s a small bunch of Peruvian lilies. A few red carnations. A handful of gladioli. And—And a single tulip in the middle of it all.
He’s been drunk for a week. He doesn’t care that his sobriety is broken. He doesn’t care that he’s probably going to die from how much he’s had. He doesn’t care about anything.
He hesitates. Steve hasn’t been forbidden from seeing Tony. He hasn’t even been discouraged. Agents Romanov and Barton have told him time and time again that he’s a great person… just rough around the edges. But, consistently, everyone he’s talked to has assured Steve that he will like Tony. He just has to get past the act he puts on for the world.
“You’re gone for so long, and I want you to find Bucky, I do, but it’s hard to be supportive when you’re gone more than you’re here.”
“No, no, Steve—” Tony gasps. Steve flicks his gaze up to see Tony’s eyes widen, the evening sun bouncing off of them and bringing out the millions of swirls of colors present. Steve can feel his palms start to sweat.
But then again—Tony thinks he probably died the moment Steve told him he knew of Bucky killing his mom.
Hearing Steve say these things to him, saying that Bucky means more to Steve than Tony—it breaks something in him, just like Tony can tell his refusal to give into Steve’s wants is breaking something in Steve.
Tony lets himself think of all the happiness, the laughter and the kisses and the whispered lies of devotion in his ears. He thinks of the shield in his chest. He thinks of
“Okay, boys. We’re closing up now. You guys better get home before the storm worsens.” Ashley’s voice is kind but firm, and Steve glances out the window with surprise and then a forlorn sigh. He hadn’t realized just how long he and Tony had been talking. He also hadn’t realized it had begun to sleet, slush already forming on the ground.
Tony shuffles on his feet, but his breathing is quickening, and he leans against the heat of Steve’s chest. It’s like nirvana. “Yeah. If people found out where he is… Well. A lot of people are after him, and if they get to him, I can’t—I can’t protect him.”
“Oh, dude, don’t call me ma’am. I’m pretty sure I’m younger than you are. Just Jan is fine. It’s what all my friends call me.”
The day Thanos’s Children had arrived on Earth, Steve had called Tony, mesmerized by the motel’s clock blinking 5:00. Tony had answered, as Tony always does, and Steve had asked—he’s asked—
“I don’t care about fucking Barnes, Rogers!” Tony roars, throwing everything he has at Steve. He knows Steve can take it, but Tony needs Steve to hurt, to burn, to feel even an ounce of the pain that Tony is feeling. “You lied to me! You chose a friend over me! And on—on today of all the goddamn days you could have chosen—”
He can’t think of anyone who’s around Tony’s age that fits the description of Tony’s boyfriend and of someone that he hasn’t seen in a while but was apparently close to. Maybe it was someone who thought they were closer than they actually were?
“My—My boyfriend—” Tony begins, stuttering. He breathes in once, deep, and then swallows. “You actually know him.”
Steve bites his lip. He doesn’t know if Bruce is truly loyal to Tony, or if he’s simply loyal to whoever holds the title King. It’s a guess if there ever were any.
Steve is quiet, processing the request, and he tries to think over how oddly Tony is wording his sentences. In truth, Tony has always been odd when talking about his boyfriend in relation to Steve. Steve never has figured out why, but he’s sensing that something is going to change between them.
“I don’t know their name,” Clint responds, smoothing the papers out and handing them over to Steve. “I only know their intent.”
Strong fingers lift Tony’s chin. The King’s grip is strong, sure of his welcome, and Tony bites the inside of his cheek.
“You preached to me!” he yells, getting up into Steve’s face. “You preached to me about how important honesty and trust was between us! How I
Steve flushes, overtaken by her genuine friendliness and enthusiasm. He pulls his SHIELD-issued communicator out of his pocket—and Steve doubts he’s ever going to get over how quickly technology has improved—and hands it over to her. Janet winks at him as she takes it, pulling up a new contact information box and inputting her number. “Thank you, ma’am. It would be lovely to meet new people.”
He tries to drag air into his lungs, tries to find the will to breathe, but nothing works, and he turns to Steve—
Cap is silent. His hands resume their work, reaching for the zipper on Tony’s jeans, his movements professional as he removes the garment from Tony’s body.
The top paper is writ in a heavy scrawl, a single line of coded messages, with a secondary translation sitting underneath it.
When he enters, King Anthony is sitting up on his bed, a book in his hands. His head turns to meet Steve’s gaze, and the golden-brown color within his eyes flickers with warmth.
hasn’t even ended before recognition fills Steve to his very bones. He curls his fingers around Tony’s waist and turns Tony to face him. His mind just—shuts down, from hearing this song and knowing what it means, to seeing Tony’s beautiful, tear streaked face. He looks like an angel as he cries, eyes wide and wet and gorgeous, and Steve feels something new come alight inside him at the sight.
Bruce’s eyes narrow. He takes the plate from Steve, grabbing a piece of the meat and gathering a small kit of devices Steve’s never seen before. Steve can’t follow along with what Bruce is doing, but it’s just minutes until Bruce is back in Steve’s space in the corner.
“Tony,” Steve breathes, relief evident in his voice the moment he answers. He launches into a speech without a second thought, and Tony lets himself relish in Steve’s voice, if only for this moment. “I was worried when Nat told me you were locked in your lab. I said that we’re going to get through this, remember? I’ll figure out a way to get back to you. I’ll make this up to you somehow. Okay, sweetheart? We can be Avengers together again. And now that I have Bucky, I’m not going to have to leave on those long missions. I’ll be around as much as you want, Tony. I promise.”
A softness creeps into Steve’s body, and he reaches out to Tony, cradling his face. “You survived, Tony. Not only that—you thrived. I know things are tough between us, but never doubt that I love you.” There’s a pregnant pause, and then, “I’m not trying to be harsh. I know you’re trying, but you can see how I’m right in this case, can’t you? Do you understand what I’m trying to say, about us doing this together? You shouldn’t have to go through this alone. Let me do it for you. I can’t lose you.”
Thor doesn’t seem to understand the problem—polyamory is the most common expression of love on Asgard.
They hit a rough patch, about seven months in, and Tony knows it’s his fault. He’s been trying, of course he has, but it’s been difficult. Pepper, his most successful relationship, left because of him. Previous relationships all failed because he wasn’t capable of being the person they needed in a partner.
“Steve,” the King whispers, his fingers running through Tony’s hair. Each pass creeps closer and closer to the soulmark written on the back of Tony’s neck. “When it is just you and me, you will call me Steve.”
Steve lines himself up against Tony’s back, and he feels guilt and self-hatred climbing up his spine. Tony is taken. He shouldn’t be plastering himself against his back like this. He should step back, but something stops him, and he doesn’t. Tony’s warmth against his chest is intoxicating, and his smell under Steve’s nose is like the sweetest ambrosia.
Steve’s yell is enraged, and his next punch against the armor is so much stronger than all the previous ones. Tony staggers, falling to a knee, and barely manages to spin to the side to avoid Steve’s next attack.
“Your Majesty?” Tony presses his head into the meat of the King’s thigh. The leather pants are warm against Tony’s cheek. It’s almost enough to distract him from recognizing the King’s words for what they truly are.
Not that Stevie is. No, Stevie is all curves, an hourglass figure like Marilyn Monroe, with a busty chest and a model thin waist. Worst of all, Stevie
. You can’t just say that!” The aforementioned blush blooms across her cheeks in an instant, eyes darting this way and that for any potential eavesdroppers. “What if someone tells my dad?”
Tony brings him over a drink shortly after, and Steve moves over so Tony can sit on the blanket next to him. He takes a tentative sip and
He falls asleep to the feeling of Cap’s hands rubbing into his shoulders, massaging away the ever present knots. If asked, Tony doesn’t know what he would say—if he fell asleep because he knew Cap would take care of him, or if he fell asleep because he didn’t care either way.
She disappears without a trace as the words hang in the air. Steve crawls out of bed, throwing on nightclothes and a cape to cover himself, and heads for the Falcon’s Nest atop the highest spiral. He takes the back passages, the ones hidden from sight and meant for use only by the Royal Family. Steve doesn’t let himself think of why he knows of their existence.
“I’m so sorry,” she says, reaching him and dropping gracelessly on the ground next to him. “I’m so sorry, Tony.”
They sleep side by side, but their backs are turned, and Steve only relaxes once he falls asleep. Tony flips over, sometimes, just to watch the rise and fall of Steve’s breathing, and wonders if the love they feel for each other means more than the damage they cause.
James whines, but obeys, leaving her with a final lick on her neck. It’s bold, especially after a rejection, but Toni doesn’t scold him. She closes her eyes.
His words are slurred and he’s not even sure if Cap can understand him. He can’t get the energy to open his eyes, but the jerky movements from before, of Cap undressing him, stagger to a stop.
Toni sobs, nodding her head before Stevie’s even finished asking. “Yes, Stevie. Yes. Whatever you want.”
He knows it’s psychosomatic, his dislike. He knows his body has healed in the seven or so months that’ve passed since he was thawed from the ice. He knows he’s warm now.
Steve chokes out another sob, rubbing his face into Tony’s chest. His arms tighten around Tony’s waist, and Tony gets the impression that he’s trying to crawl inside of Tony—inside safety. “We need to talk and figure this out, Tony,” he says. “You’re too important to me to let this end. You’re—You’re mine. I get to keep you. I can’t have us end, too. I can’t lose you.”
Tony pulls the phone away from his ear. He can hear Steve on the other end, frantic in his pleas, and closes his eyes.
“Sweetheart,” Steve croons. “If there’s anything I know about James Buchanan Barnes, it’s that you don’t disobey his orders.”
The Royal Doctor approaches the doors, small in stature and mousy of hair. Bruce Banner, a trusted physician that oversaw the health of the previous King. The guards surely must know better than to disobey him.
He doesn’t want this to end with Steve. He knows Steve is better for him than anyone he’s ever possibly going to meet, whether in the present or the future. He has to keep trying.
Steve shifts on his feet. Tony’s arms have somehow found themselves crossed over his chest, over the scars, and he bites his lip as he takes in Steve’s words and contrite body language.
Tony trudges up to the castle, his armor clanking loudly through the stone hallways. The throne room awaits him.
Tony laughs, bright and hilarious. “Jan? Oh, god, I love her to death, but I could never date her. No, she’s my platonic soulmate.”
It’s time, he decides, to stop ignoring him. Tony has done nothing wrong to Steve. Every (limited) encounter the two of them have had has been polite. It’s not Tony’s fault that Steve looks at him and can only see Howard’s betrayal.
“You’re mine, Tony.” Steve’s voice is low, his eyes pained as tears coalesce at the corners of his eyes. He’s desperate, and Tony understands with a visceral pain through his chest that Steve has lied to himself about their suffering relationship—that he’s buried his fear of abandonment so far down that all Steve has left is anguish and anger. “Just like Bucky is mine. You aren’t going to leave me. You love me too much. This is just—a hiccup. And we’re going to solve this.”
