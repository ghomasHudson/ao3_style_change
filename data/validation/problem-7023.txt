Tony would not feel intimidated by this no way, so he turn to face Rogers fully, looked at him directly in those deep Blue angry eyes and with a smirk said “ or what?” That all he said and that broke the camels back. Because the next thing tony knew warm, harsh lips were on his.
Tony felt so much power running through him it was overwhelming but also he felt sadness that this was the last time he’ll see his dad, he hugs his dad tightly “please don’t go please not again” he cried. Howard soothes him “oh come now don’t cry my son, you’ll be fine I wish I could stay but just remember this I love you Anthony” Howard told him and Tony felt so much love from his father like never before.
Fury observe the other two, Clint was nodding along agreeing to everything that Natasha said. But Steve, he looked awkward and avoid looking at anyone.
Davis laughed at the silly joke “nah I go nothing to hide kid come on I’ll Make us some coffee” he spoke as walked away from the door and back into his house. He motioned tony to come in which he did.
“Sure thing J and how do I look by the way?” He ask with a smirk. “You look impeccable as always sir” JARVIS replied with a hint is sass to it. “Aw J you always know the right things to say” Tony tease “well sir you did program me” he sass back.
It was then in the room was just Tony, Tobias, Peggy and Davis. There was an awkward silence at first until his mom spoke to him gently. “Darling tell what’s going on?” She said.
That made Tobias head spin, “what that fucking....ouch” he hissed in pain when his grandmother smack him across the head. “Don’t speak just vulgar language Tobias you are far too young to speak like that” she scolded. Tobias rub his head to sooth the pain “grandma I’m 19 I’m not that little boy anymore. But I’m sorry to say that in front of you” he apologies, “Good” Peggy replies.
Why does Rogers have to be a pain in Tony’s ass, why couldn’t he be thankful that beat the bad guys quickly, why does he have to shout at him.
But that wasn’t the case here, for fuck sake after all this time, they now decide to bring him this after months of knowing. He informed everyone that if this certain thing happens then he needs to be informed immediately, he had an action plan in place but now he doesn’t know what to do.
“Sir, Captain Rogers is demanding to enter your floor” Jarvis burst out saying. God tony doesn’t want to deal with Captain self righteous right now or any of the avengers in fact he just wants to lay on his couch with the ice pack on his head and drink his smoothie.
Tony didn’t know what to say to Steve or how to explain it. But now it’s not the time he had to go and get his son. He step away from Lily, “don’t ever come near me again and for your own sake leave as far as you can” he warned her and she nodded knowing what he meant.
Tobias was up about an hour ago, he had a shower, got dressed and then went to the kitchen expecting his dad to be there, which wasn’t a surprise as his dad was more of a night owl than a early bird. But for some reason something was odd, since last night when his dad came over looking terrified and that scared Him as well.
In the background Tony heard Clint scoff, “Really Stark? Well if you’re going to handle the matter. Then was the deaths of Lieutenant Marks and his wife part of it too?” He growled.
“The woman got away luckily, but the attackers got me instead. I... I know one of them his name is Daniel we use to be friends but he left and now he’s change. He ur... he and his gang hurt me badly, they beat me, tortured me and they.. they raped me” there he said it, he wanted to hide away and pretend that this was some fuck up dream.
For a moment lily looked sad, “I didn’t come here to take revenge, in fact I was gonna was the glad to sent to that prison. It gave me a lot of clarity, I was in bad place before Daniel came along, he made me believe that my anger needed to be express in a certain way and I just took that as a ok to be a monster that I was to you and I am so sorry Tony. I don’t expect you to forgive me or even believe me but I am truly sorry for what I did to you” she ranted with tears now coming down her face.
Tony roll his eyes and motions Steve to follow him, he feel Steve happiness from behind him and it was annoying him, but he can’t help but smile a little maybe this was a good first step for them.
Whilst Tony was getting change, he took off with ‘extremely’ expensive watch and went to his bed side draws to put the watch inside. As he open the drawer he notice the braces and the neckless that his mom gave to him for his birthday,he didn’t really think much of them at time but now the way the neckless was shining with all kinds of colours is telling him that this might be important.
“Sigh” why does that not surprise him. Contrary to what people thought, Fury cared for Tony greatly, he may not show it emotional but he does care, sure he kept secrets from him like what happen to certain people in his life that damage him or that Fury was his godfather, he still remembers how Peggy actually made him Tony’s godfather it still makes him chuckle.
“Why?” Peggy suddenly said, Steve turn to face her with a confused look “What ..” “Why did you do it? Why were you so harsh to my boy, he’s been nothing but kind to you, sure he can be an arse but it’s not intentional it’s a mask to hide his true feelings” Peggy takes a breath. Steve wanted to speak out but Peggy hush him “what happen to the man who hated bullies? What happen to the man I once loved, the man who will protect anyone, to fight for anyone. You were once a kind hearted, understanding man, so what happen to that man Steve?” She whispers, with tears threatening to come out.
The agent heard the female spy, she knew this was going to happen, but this was her mission. She will not disappoint her superiors, she look straight at the spies who were coming closer to her, she gave them a dark grin, holding a device in her hand and simply said “Hail Hydra”, then she pressed the button.
“I can’t believe this, why didn’t you tell us Tony?” Steve mindlessly ask. To that Tony scoff “are you serious Steve why should I you hate me and I didn’t want you to despise me more knowing who my mother is. And not only that if you somehow blab about my true heritage could you manage the scandal, the backlash of it all I will not allow my family to be harm by that” he ranted and that shut Steve up.
But as peaceful as it is, Tony has work to do, “right here we go” he said to himself. Tony walks into the woodland area, when he comes to this place he always drawn to the woods, he never knows why exactly but he always conclude that this is where his soul is located.
Tony put his phone down and sighed, today was too exhausting. But he can’t rest he needs to prepare himself before Daniel comes out of the shadows, he needs to train.
It was cold, the forest was surrounded by thick fog, he couldn’t see anything. He needed to find it but couldn’t he shouted and shouted hoping it will answer him but it didn’t.
After that we left MIT and went to go to Harvard and study criminal law for the next two years. Now, so far it’s going well and soon he will hopefully pass the bar exam in no time.
The spy twins, Rogers and Bruce are chatting away except for Tony it didn’t feel like he was welcomed in the conversation. Tony felt a large hand on his shoulder, he turn to look and saw Thor smiling down at him “are you alright?” He whispered “yeah I’m good big guy just thinking that’s all” Tony replies.
Clint just shook his head and chuckled, “ don’t get all defensive cap, we understand that you’re human and needed a little me time. Sure it’s with Stark, but if the rumours are true I’m sure he gave to a run for your money uh”.
P.s. also I wonder if you guess could help find a fix that I’ve been trying to find for ages but remember the name of it, the story was basically all the avengers were caught by some villain and the bad guy had this magic staff that can look into peoples past. He uses it on Tony and it shows how his life was very abusive ie his dad been the main one, but in the end was a happy ending and Tony and Steve got together, I know it was completed and I think it had either 6 or 7 chapters. Hope you guys can help me with this and also hope you all are doing well 😊
The next item was two large bracelets, they were leather and old. He pick one up, Tony was surprise to feel cold metal underneath so he turned it around and what do you know they were blade. When he was younger his mom told him that there were people who would use these blades to stealthily target the bad guys they were useful, quiet and quick. He never seen one in real life until now and he didn’t know why he needed them, John must of sense his doubts cause the next thing he knew John touch his shoulder as some kind of reassurance “I know you have the armour but they can be useful when the time is right trust me your mom wouldn’t have given you these now if she didn’t have a reason” he spoke gently and yeah he was right he shouldn’t doubt his mom.
Tony couldn’t say how long he’s been strapped to the bed, but he can say he was getting fucking annoyed about being tied down to the bed. The muscles on his arms and back were aching, he needed to move his arms as they were going numb.
Pepper sighed, “It’s ok, that happens some times, just call me ok. I was worried about you” she smiled gently to reassure him. Tony smiled back to her, grateful for her patience.
“So the others two are getting Brucie bear and point break?” Tony asked like a whisper, Fury gave him a sympathetic look which was unusual in Steve’s opinion. “Yes, they should be here soon” he reply, Tony sighs “ok then I’ll we just wait until they arrive then I guess” he said nervously.
At this point both Natasha and Clint argue, while Steve was saying nothing he couldn’t shake the feeling about how Tony reacted to him and about that kid too it just didn’t make sense.
“So what’s the plan Tony?” Steve asks, Tony then became serious “first off, J make sure you surveillance every corner in this city, any car, truck or a plane that may look suspicious and also make sure our security is top notch”  He told is AI, “certainly sir” Jarvis replies. “Good now secondly you two” He points at Bruce and Steve “are going to look after my family and keep guard, while I be in my What you’ll call a mini lab” he told his team and then he remembers “oh and J be ready for the rescue suits for my family” he informs Jarvis “of course sir, they are ready when you give the your order”.
Tony was confused his mom and Davis never mention that, “ok if that’s true why am I just been told this now?” Tony ask.
“You done day dreaming kid, or do you need another 5 minutes” Davis teased when Tony (that he will never admit that he jump out of his skin when Davis spoke) turned towards Davis, “Oh ha ha What do you think I am I a twelve year girl fantasising about a boy” he sassed back. Davis just laughed “ I wouldn’t say got a twelve year old girl but I wouldn’t put it passed you to fantasising about a man” he grinned and Tony just snorted.
“(Sigh) ok you figured it out, but it’s nothing anything more than sex ok. It’s like a stress relief you know” steve tried to defend the reasoning behind his and Starks relationship.
Agent Hill open the door, looking rather irritated. “Sir, agent Barton, agent Romanoff and Captain Rogers would like to speak with you. They say it’s rather important” she said.
That what Natasha heard first, then the smell of burning tires, metal and even human flesh (she will never get use to that smell). She was slowly coming out of her haze, she can feel pain in her shoulder most likely dislocated and pain in her leg (feels like burns).
He turned out the director “ What the hell happened?” He ask. “ Well until the other two are here Tony and I will explain and let I remind you Doctor Banner that before accusing someone maybe you should hear the facts first, I thought you know this since you have had similar experience” he chastised and Bruce look down with guilt he was right maybe he was too quick to judge Tony after all Tony has never judge him and he accepted the other guy. “Puny Banner stupid, being mean to Tin man” Hulk grumbles in his head, Hulk always seems to chastised him every time he said some not so nice comment about Tony. Bruce thought it was strange how the other guy care so much about Tony maybe he seen something in his friend that he has yet to see.
Nebula had been a great companion for Tony, he's very thankful for her. She doesn't talk much but she listens. Tony's glad that he's listened, for once. No one listened to Tony, not even Peter, that kid is a trouble. But he's a kid, Tony loves him, he's a great kid. Tony felt so guilty for what happened, he's a kid. He was just a kid. Rhodey listens to Tony when Tony talks, but Tony could barely talk to Rhodey after what happened in Siberia. He still hadn't told him what happened with Steve, he just told Rhodey that he let Steve go with T'Challa. He knew where Steve had been hiding and what he had been doing all this time. Steve. Surprisingly, when it comes to stupid babblings and rantings, Steve listens to him the most. Tony would talk and complain to himself as he works on one of his armors and Steve would sit down on the floor, smiling at every words that leave Tony's mouth while Steve sketched him.
But Hephaestus had Zeus's attention, at least in one aspect, and he could not risk losing that because he didn't
What is this alternate reality he’s woken up in? He feels like an intruder in a life that someone is claiming is his own.
It takes over a minute for Hephaestus to organize his thoughts back into place. He feels uncomfortable with the sudden intrusion, but resigns himself to fact that the gesture was necessary.
Tony’s lips quirk upward at the nickname, amused despite himself. Tossing the scratchy wool blanket aside, his dog tags clang softly against the reactor. Steve holds out his hand and Tony accepts the help to get up off the floor.
He wants to demand answers, but even after such a short time knowing him, Hephaestus knows there would be no point.
When Loki and Fury are finally done comparing dick sizes, Tony waves away the prisoner feed to the background of his mind in favor of the conversation starting in the chosen briefing room.
It’s not that Tony now feels inclined to commit horrific acts, but that he simply doesn’t care about anything anymore. He’s numb.
“Excellent!” Hades looks at him thoughtfully, “You need to finish healing, which won’t take very long with my help. We’re leaving in a couple of days, so you should have your power back by then.”
Unafraid, without glamours, and emboldened by the responsibility that rests firmly on his shoulders.
, fuck his insatiable curiosity) all he could make out at first was the large crowd of GI’s and a man on stage wearing a skin-tight red, white, and blue costume.
Getting to hear his stories about his mom, Bucky, a neighborhood in Brooklyn where Steve got into a fight in almost every alley and corner, makes Hephaestus only want to know more.
His laughter grates. “You’re funny, even though you speak with ignorance. Hephaestus, you are naïve and weak. Rejoice in that you have a sponsor who wishes to save you.”
“It’s just been a lot of yelling from the drill sergeants and attempts to strip us of our identities.” He looks like he’s trying very hard not to roll his eyes. “But I was expecting that. Bucky, the guy from the expo and my best friend from Brooklyn, had told me what it’s like. I just need to push through the physical training.”
His body tenses and his mind comes up with all sorts of possibilities of who could be on the other side of that door. But after an impatient look from Hades, Hephaestus finally moves to let the person inside.
No, his eyes are blue. They are actually a bright blue that remind him of the glow from the Arc Reactor.
Hera, the supreme goddess, patron of marriage and childbirth, was not very good at being a wife and mother. She may be the goddess of family, but she did not understand that kind of love.
JARVIS, the wonder child he is, pulls up the disturbance detected within seconds so it's splashed across his monitors.
It isn’t hard to guess who the being is in front of him, but damn it, he doesn’t want to voice it. He doesn’t want to be right.
The effect of that is like a shock of cold water. He books it, every thought in his mind dedicated to saving his friends.
They rush out the back door of the facility, their numbers too large for so few guards to deny. Hephaestus makes sure the cameras are deactivated as to not alert any more of Hydra’s agents and they steal the guns of those they knock out.
He hears a few choked coughs of muffled laughter throughout the room, but Tony turns toward one Maria Hill whose expression doesn’t shift.
The tie and suspenders Hades were wearing earlier are abandoned now. Instead, his sleeves are rolled up and a smudge of grease stains his collar.
Tony, hand still on the wheel of his Stark 11 (a gorgeous R8 Spyder, thanks for asking), only narrows his eyes as any indication that he heard and is listening to JARVIS’s suggestion.
Tony doesn’t recognize Pepper has entered his workshop until she speaks right behind him. “I’d ask if you heard the intercom, but clearly you’ve been a bit preoccupied.”
“Yeah,” Rhodey says. “It’s funny, because it looks like someone stepped in and destroyed those weapons for you.”
He doesn’t know what he did to make the universe hate him so much, but all Hephaestus can focus on is the all-consuming pain. He can feel a throbbing ache all the way to his core.
Just so y'all know, in my head, Tony in the 40's looked like MCU Tony without the facial hair and in his natural Hephaestus state he looks like 616 Tony just shorter. For reference please see this amazing fanart https://i.pinimg.com/originals/14/7a/d2/147ad2651557286270af6737bf297c08.jpg
Tony flexes his fingers. He fights the urge to tap on the reactor. It’s a nervous tic he’s started to pick up over the last few months. Tony doesn’t want to think about how it began once the aches in his chest started.
He was sitting in his office looking at the plans that his agents and himself have thought out, it was coming together smoothly. Sure Anthony got his family in his tower but no matter they are not important right now, what is important is making sure he can tear the Avengers apart and then finally he will have what he wanted his sweet boy.
Then Tony heard the door open, and quickly look at that direction and who came in made his heart beat twice as fast. “Ah Anthony you’re awake, excellent I thought I had to throw cold water at your pretty face, I’m sure you would like that wouldn’t you” Daniel spoke mockingly as walks towards the bed.
“Wait you’re telling me that you were aware of mom and my abilities?” Tony ask. “I was” his father answered “ your mom told when you start to develop your abilities, she told to leave it alone as it wasn’t my place and for once I listen to her and I’m glad I did god knows what idiocy I would have done if I intervened “ he spoke with some humour in his voice.
Thor looks up at Steve and smiles “ Friend Steven, how have you been, I understand you wanted to speak with me?” Thor spoke.
Peggy smiles fondly at Bruce “oh please Doctor Banner just call me Peggy, and I’m glad to see that you care for my son you made quite an impression on him he talks about you a lot” she informs. “He does?” Bruce reply’s, “oh yeah my dad calls you his science bro” Tobias speaks up.
“Oh fuck...hmmgg” tony moan, the sensation was too much but it felt so good Rogers hit his prostate over and over that he could see stars, he was going to cum soon. Rogers seem to read his mind as he held tony with one hand, he use the other hand to grab Tony’s cock and jerk it off in a fast pace. “Cum Stark, let me feel you” Rogers demanded and Tony obeyed, everything went white, he felt himself spasm and his own cum spurting between them, landing on there clothed chests.
Fury was brought out of his thoughts, when a knock on the door came from the other side of the door. He sighed and closed the file he had been reading, “who is it?” He said.
Slowly but surely Tony calms down and was now focus where he was, “Jarvis hows Tobias?” He asks his AI.
“Jarvis gather the Avengers and tell them to meet me in the training room I think it’s time for us to start forming a battle plan” Steve informs the AI. “Of course Captain Rogers” the AI replies, Steve then turns to Tobias “I must be off, thank you for this talk, this means a lot” he smiles and walks to the elevator.
But it had to wait he needed to go and he also got the gala tonight too. Tony sighed and looked at Steve “Ok, we won’t argue or whatever we do that isn’t the norm, but I can’t today got things to do you see. But I promise we can talk tomorrow, is that okay?” He asked with uncertainty.
Before Steve even respond, Tony dash past him and went straight to the elevator, “ground floor J”. “Right away sir” Jarvis replied, “and may I say sir your conversation with Captain Rogers has greatly approved” Tony scoffs “not helping J and cut the sass will you or I might actually donate you to a community college” he teased to his AI “Oh heaven for bid Sir my apologies” Jarvis mocked and Tony chuckled god he did love his AI.
“Anyways, everyone expect you Tony you al can just walk around and talk to a few people. Let them get to know you and improve your PR, I recommend for you Captain to talk to some of the military men and women they would love to talk you” Steve slightly chuckle at that “will do Miss Potts” he replied.
“I thought last night would a good chance for us to talk properly for once to actually see the real you. But you know what you are Stark, your just a arrogant, egotistical, selfish, slut who just happily spread his legs for everyone to have and not only........Argh” Steve would finish his sentence. But that’s when a fist connected to his face.
A minute later, a very pissed off spangles came through the door. “STARK!” Steve shouted as he strides closer to tony.
God this was such a messed up situation, the man who was his childhood friend, a man who brutally raped him for some kind of fucked up revenge is now escape from prison and possibly planning another sort of fuck up revenge on him.
“WHAT DID YOU SAY” the creature roared which brought Tony out of his thoughts. Tony grins at the creature “you heard me, but since you’re too fucking stupid let me break it down for you. I’m.. Tony Stark the genius, billionaire, ex-playboy, philanthropist would like you the gross creature to kindly disappear from my mind forever” he said on his usual snark.
“ sorry guys but I need to think over some stuff and I need to go and speak with fury I need to clear up some things” he announces.
Pepper roll her eyes and huff in frustration. “For god sakes tony, when are ever going to realise that there are people to be considered, today I wanted to treat you to a nice dinner for your birthday I wanted us to have a great time like we use to have before everything got crazy is that too much to ask” She ranted.
“Is it consensual?” Fury asked bluntly. Steve was shock at that question, why would Fury asked that. “Um yes it is sir” he replied but the answer that he given didn’t sound convincing. And it seems that fury himself didn’t like that response not one bit, “Rogers if you have hurt Stark in some way I swear to god I’ll....” “What no no no I swear it’s consensual, it’s like stress relief for us” he said maybe a tad bit too much which made him blush with embarrassment.
A couple minutes later Thor enters the lab with a concern look on his face. “Anthony where have you been Steven said that you insulted a lady and left the gala rather abruptly what happen?” He frantically ask.
But then a quick second later warmth wrap around him. Tobias hugged him tightly, it reminded Tony  back when he was just Tobias’s age when his little boy would just hug tightly saying if he hugged him like this then all the sadness will go away and to be honest it worked at times.
Tony looked at his mom and gave her a sad smile and nodded “I promise mom I try” he responded and Peggy just gave a grateful smile.
Tony reach out and manage to grab the handle, then everything went white. The world around him felt warm like he belonged here, he could see into things, the past of sorts. Seeing people fighting, protecting and loving other people and their homes, their world. The things he could see were not from earth but from a different world all together could this be Asgard Tony wondered. He felt power seeping around him, it felt familiar to him, felt like home to him.
“Is that how Stark sees it Captain?” Fury asked with a hint of anger in his voice. Steve was ready to reply but for once he wasn’t sure, first saw that and sighed again.
Tony felt rage and fear at the same time. “So what, is this why your back to come get some sort of revenge, well hate to being the bearer of bad news but you deserve it after what you did” he said coldly.
And most importantly what was that file that Fury was looking at well you find out soon in the next few chapters
Peggy just chuckle which confused tony, “oh sweetheart, it’s not a present that I brought. It’s something that is past down to the family and I want you to have and maybe you could even improve it” she said.
“If your going to see the boss man, then we’re going with you, we would like word with him about stark too” Clint continues.
“Yeah sure I’ll do that for you kid and I’ve made sure my best agents are searching for that man too, you have my word Tony that I won’t let anything happen to your family while they under my protection. What about your son where is he?” Fury asked
Once Tony was outside, he called the suit as it will be the fastest way to get to his son, once he was inside the suit. He use the thrusters to lift him up in the air and fly to his son, each second he flew, he tried desperately to call his son but there was no answer which panics him.
I’m back sooooo sorry for this late chapter was quite stuck on this one but finally finished it woohoo
As Steve went to sit down he look towards Peggy and her family, he instantly felt guilty again. The looks on their faces wasn’t pleasant they all look distraught about what happened to Tony. “Um Peggy I’m so sorry I wish I was stron.......” he wanted to finish his sentence but Peggy interrupted him, “Steve it’s okay you don’t to apologise, it wasn’t your fault it was them okay not you” she told him firmly but also kindly as well. Steve felt relief at those words, he was glad that Peggy didn’t blame and she was right it was those Hydra scum who did this, but yet he still feels guilty but he can make up for it when he rescue Tony.
Thor told that he should stop as the training they did would drain too much energy for Tony which could lead him to collapse. He agreed as he wanted to go a see his son, he even promise Thor that’ he could even meet his Bambi at some point.
“That does sound like a better idea, I think we will need supplies,” Steve said, unable to help looking over at the other two men. He’d especially wanted to see Bucky like this for a while, but he was definitely happy that Tony was involved in it too. Taking off his towel, he tossed it back in the bathroom, making a note to clean up later. “Where’s your room?”
“You haven’t been, Bucky. And this isn’t something small,” Steve said, about to scoop Bucky up in his arms and head up to their shared bedroom when Tony appeared in the doorway looking spooked, wide eyed and pale. “Tony?”
Steve and Tony smiled, putting down their drinks and reaching out to take both of Bucky’s hands, squeezing them.
“Then…how about we get him for you?” Tony asked, biting the inside of his mouth to contain the gigantic grin that was threatening to spread across his face.
“I love you too, Tony,” Steve said as he leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes and getting comfortable. “Don’t let me sleep too long.”
Steve jumped as he heard a sound like the front door being kicked in. Unweaving himself from Bucky, he clambered over to a small hole in the middle of the floor Namor had showed him. Pushing aside the book that was covering it, he looked down into the lit room below in time to see a bleeding Namor on the floor with two guards standing over him. And more guards were coming.
“So basically you’re telling me that if you have a window, it’s a constant battle with wildlife and weather, and you might suffocate if you don’t open it enough?” Bucky chuckled as he leaned back against the wall, wrapping the blanket around him. “Are you saying that they did me a favour not putting me on the top floor?”
“We’ll talk about it later,” Tony replied, leaning back in the throne as he gave a nod to Pepper, who disappeared into the neighbouring room. “This should be interesting, I can’t believe they got here so fast from Latveria.
“I don’t feel like spending my time hanging around waiting,” scoffed Von Doom, trying not to look as angry as he felt. He’d wanted to marry Tony and head right back for Latveria, this place was entirely too colourful and pleasant for him.
“But what if they both walk away?” Tony asked, having thought of that possibility as well. “What if they both only agree because…because I’m King, and they want this life? What if they’re agreeing so they can be with me, but they’re actually miserable?”
“I’m going to admit I’ve never thought about something like this but….let’s see where it takes us, right?” Tony asked, looking at Steve in the moonlight, feeling comfortably warm with Bucky pressed against his chest. The two of them had managed to make him stop thinking about the nightmare he was going through, they were making him feel human again. “Steve?”
“You bought the ticket, and chance made us winners, we didn’t earn this spot at all,” Bucky reminded her.
“Tell me what you want the world to know about them,” Pepper readied her pencil, looking over at him. “Remember, Natasha and Sarah can help with this, but you loved them too, you should get a chance to have your words said.”
“Oh? And what are you going to do?” Ronin laughed, walking around the foot of the bed, blade drawn in front of him. This guy seemed like a big mouth, probably because he had a visible weakness. He could just cut Bucky’s other arm off and make this even less fair. It was tempting after that kick to his chest.
“I know, but I don’t like the thought of war breaking out and you having to go,” Sarah shook her head, looking at her son with worry in her eyes. “There have been so many rumours lately, and I can’t stand the thought of…why did you have to become a soldier? Why couldn’t you have become a baker?”
“Why don’t we give Bucky some space, this was a lot for today,” Ms. Carr said with a fake smile, wanting to break up this conversation before it could get started, touching Steve’s arm to catch his attention and lead him out of the room. “I’m sure Steve will come back tomorrow, Bucky. The nurse will be here soon for your check up, she’s bringing your dinner.”
“Windows…I know what they are but I’ve never really seen one,” Bucky said, laughing dryly before taking a drink. “They look great.”
“I wouldn’t have accepted the job if I knew he was your friend,” Clint said to her, fiddling with his mask in his hands.
“What’s going on?” Tony asked, pulling up beside them with his window open, looking concerned at the change of pace.
“I just hope he’ll be happy with me,” Steve said with a weak laugh as the waitress came to refill their coffees. “Goddamn does he deserve it.”
“Obviously he either lives here or he knows someone that does,” Natasha crossed her arms, wishing Clint had an actual name or more information for them to pursue. She already had every intention of hunting these Ten Rings people down, she just wanted to start immediately.
Bucky didn’t reply, only pulling his blanket around him tighter, looking up at the tall trees lining the sides of the road. He was hoping to see a moose, he’d seen one in a nature book once and he didn’t know if he believed they could be as tall as he read.
When he woke up the next morning in his posh new bed in the castle, Steve had no idea what the day was going to hold. He imagined he’d be eating a massive meal again, probably right after the tenth time his mother fussed about how expensive everything there was. Even the blankets were embroidered and colourful, and the bed and pillow were a delight to lie on. Steve could definitely get used to this kind of living, especially with his mother by his side.
“Baby…” Tony smiled as Steve held Bucky’s hand for him to slip the ring on, pulling him into a hug as Steve gave him one from behind, keeping the three of them tightly together. “You’re ours, we’re yours, you had a long road to get here but…now you’re home.”
“One at a time we can lie them down on the bed beside you, but you’re not well enough to sit up and hold them quite yet,” Steve said, getting to his feet as Bucky adjusted himself as much as he could in bed to give the baby room. Once a spot was clear, Steve dragged the chair over with his heel to sit down close to the bed, putting the baby down with Bucky. “Bucky, this is your daughter, Gwendolyn Maria Stark-Rogers, she was five pounds and twelve ounces, and she came out first.”
If the lack of conflict or complete silence between the three gods seems odd to him, Steve doesn’t comment on it.
Tony loses himself to the memories of a strange woman named Maria Stark and a childhood he doesn’t remember having. He doesn’t know how he got here, but it’s a whirlwind. He’s living through a quarter of a lifetime in hazy patches that are only now being fused together hastily in a number of hours, minutes.
“You children make it so easy.” Koios sounds disgusted. “I’m glad I’m only the first of many to be released. I’ve been told you’d make a valuable ally, but I don’t see it.”
“You know what was real bad business…” Private Jim Morita mimes the motion of shooting a Hydra weapon, complete with semi-realistic explosion sounds in the wake of the blue blast.
Tony knows full well that he can’t really attack, but let’s just say that the repulsor blast he sends has a little extra something in it.
Studying his posture and violent grin, Tony realizes that Thor really believes he has the upper hand here.
“Unless,“ Tony points at the doctor, “Selvig has figured out how to stabilize the quantum tunneling effect.”
for Hera. Maybe once she might have desired to feel the emotion, especially after seeing how happy it could make the families she created, but at the end of the day she was a goddess. And goddesses could not afford to feel love.
Of course this was to stay on good relations with Asgard. Why would any of them care that this was the tool he’s used for decades?
Hephaestus holds back a sigh and doesn’t look up again until the secretary finally returns. He accepts the uniform with a stiff, polite nod.
Now isn’t the time to grieve. He can’t afford to mope around anymore. Not with so many dying and a suit of armor waiting for him downstairs.
They both do not speak for a few minutes, but Hades eventually breaks the silence. “Well I cannot tell you the reasoning behind it, but right now,” he stands, and the god of fire watches a shift occur in Hades. The immense power is gone, leaving behind an empty feeling in its wake, “I’m Howard Stark.”
Surprisingly, it’s Steve who tentatively opens the door. “I know it’s late, but I was wondering if I could talk to you?”
The promise of destruction brought down by the Titans themselves, resurrected from their prison in Tartarus.
Phillips stares at Erskine. Then Hephaestus. For a long moment they wait for the General to reply before he reaches inside the closest crate instead.
Horrifyingly, a suit of armor looms beside him, the reflection of Tony’s own if through a monstrous fun-house mirror.
“From where I’m standing, it doesn’t look that way.” Bucky shakes his head. “If you don’t want anything to do with Steve, fine, but make sure the punk knows that.”
He realized just before the battle with Ultron that his worst nightmare is being unable to live without a battle. It’s a horrible kind of ironic, but Steve was so tired. By the time the accords were being negotiated he was no longer afraid of that fact. He’s a soldier. His life is war. So Steve lives with his intimate knowledge of the guilt and pain and emptiness that death brings.
He knows where this is going and it feels like he’s been gutted. A sharp stabbing pain of regret, self-hatred, and horrifying fear.
He shakes his head, “But you need to remember that everything with the military is hush hush, so you can’t say a word of this to anyone. Seriously, even the American public thinks I’m just making innovations for the future or something.”
Hephaestus’s eyes grow slightly wider when Steve breaks eye contact with Carter to look at him instead. It feels like all of the air has been sucked out of the room. “The right partner.”
It’s that thought however, that made Hephaestus firm in his decision to distance himself from Steve.
Hephaestus fleetingly wondered what the story there was. Why did Odin already decide this when he has another son?
Hephaestus covers his chest with a hand self-consciously when Hermes pointedly nods to it. Does all of Olympus know about his heart or did Hades tell him? Hephaestus
He paused here for a breath, but really looked at the little boy before him. Eventually, he nodded once.
“You’re the absolute worst, you know that?” Her words are undermined by the stunning smile still gracing her cheeks.
He claps his hands together. It all looks very odd on the king of the Underworld. “We need to pick a name for you, and change your facial features. You can do the latter yourself, but any ideas about the former?”
He knew that there is a larger version of the arc reactor out there with Howard Stark’s name on it. It’s in a Stark facility for the whole world to see.
“Engorged veins. They look nearly as painful as that metal in your chest.” Yinsen casually pokes at the fire.
Although Steve is only allotted 15 minutes, Hephaestus can’t help but look forward to seeing Steve eating from a metal tray (well, maybe not the tray because dear gods no). If he was pressed, he’d go as far to say it’s his favorite part of the day.
On the third day of working, he finishes synthesizing his element, the Vibranium glowing even more brightly than the Palladium in his chest.
“Yes, sir.” The unit breaks away as soon Jones nods. It’s still evening technically, but to get a reasonable amount of sleep they need to start getting ready for bed now.
“It’s okay.” Needing to keep up the façade, he doesn’t think he could build weapons for very long anyway.
And it isn’t his powers. It isn’t his ability to manifest fire. To manipulate the very ground that they walk on to form mountains. He can shift the fucking tectonic plates in whatever way he pleases so that lava pours from the Earth. It isn’t Hephaestus who ends Stane’s life.
As Hephaestus works to take out the final guard, Steve looks down to talk to the infantry who stood in attention when one of the wardens fell straight on top of their prison, unconscious.
Hades reaches over and taps the middle of his forehead twice. Hephaestus gives him a puzzled look, but then fights his mouth threatening to gape open at the sudden knowledge rushing into his mind.
The bastard who decided to scare him, Bucky fucking Barnes, just smirks and takes a seat next to him.
“Tony?” Steve scrambles to get up and raises his hand. The motion is aborted before Hephaestus can discern what it is Steve stopped himself from doing. “I thought I’d never see you again.”
“Thousands of years ago something containing your element crash landed on Earth. It had long-lasting effects I never could have predicted.”
He forces himself to keep his response easy and light, “Of course. You have the same right as everyone else.”
The rest of the box contains his old uniform. Tony is about to dismiss the rest, but then he reaches the bottom.
The boy entered the throne room, a massive place filled with artifacts and columns that ended with the sky.
Hephaestus forces himself to joke in a bad attempt at lightening the mood and getting away from his stupid feelings, “But honestly seeing this outfit of yours makes me regret it even more.”
The machine already on (“It’s called a car or an automobile, Hephaestus.” “The only thing that thing could be called is a
He has to admit to himself that he’s ashamed of it now. Of what the name Hephaestus truly represents. He’s created not only weapons, but has brought monsters to life.
Because his thoughts have always been flighty. A mess of words and equations. Tumbling. Jerking. They will crisscross into different channels of thought without warning. And sure, it’s what makes him so smart, but it washes up to edge of his sanity.
The costume doesn’t really hide anything, and the muscles that he would compare to the warriors on Olympus. He can’t deny that warmth builds low in his stomach and his mouth goes a little dry at the thought of ways Steve could use his new strength, but when Hephaestus looks back up at Steve’s face to find a familiar adorable flush, he is filled with a fondness as well.
Hephaestus held back a wince at the sharp pain of it. A mark would have been left on a human, but the young god healed almost instantaneously.
Hephaestus though, is a name that only brings bloodshed. There are things he’s done centuries ago that can never be made up for.
So he approaches with caution. He makes sure his stance is relaxed and his smile carefree, but his mind is on guard.
The explosions to destroy the facility have left the floor an array of smoke and fire. The men are on opposite sides of a catwalk and Hephaestus rushes up the staircase on Steve’s side to avoid the flames. He doesn’t want to have to explain why his clothes are burnt and not his skin on top of everything else.
time that day. It was announced that the recruit will be chosen tomorrow and to no one’s surprise Hephaestus hasn’t been given any hints as to who either Erskine or Phillips prefer all week.
“That is correct. But, that’s not what we’re going to be doing first though. Tomorrow, I’m presenting at the Modern Marvels of Tomorrow exhibition. You’ll be helping me backstage and after I’ll introduce you to Doctor Erskine.”
“I wish I could tell you I was doin’ something for kicks, but there was a message from the higher ups at headquarters.” Bucky sounds resigned.
Even when slowly, almost without notice, Ares began steering Hephaestus’s work toward only weapons for war.
Tony takes a few more hits and lets himself drift with the temporary high of nicotine. Thoughts of a time decades ago and still so fresh swirl in his mind.
On his bed that’s far too big for one person, Tony stares at the expanse of his blank white ceiling, frustrated.
“Phillips believes this super soldier is going to be the first of a group to personally escort Adolf Hitler to the gates of hell,” Hephaestus argues. “Never mind that it doesn’t exist. It’ll be hard to get him to risk that.”
He wants to say he's uniquely Tony Stark now, but no, that’s not right either. Because he doesn’t remember blue eyes in that second set of memories.
Ivan Vanko seems to not care about his weapon’s wrath. He sneers at Tony who is now blocking the entrance.
The annoyance in her tone begins to escalate into frustration. “Sometimes you don’t give me the information that I need–”
also a genuine question, how close to canon do you want this fic to be? i'm tying in a lot of elements, but for example, i'm thinking of just scrapping age of ultron entirely. thoughts? lemme know. i am conflicted.
“I’m sorry I left so suddenly. I didn’t want to.” He can’t help the sincerity that leaks into his words because it’s true. Leaving Steve, his first real friend, was more painful than he wanted to admit.
Tony restrains himself from quipping back bitterly that there’s no omnipotent God in this universe, only gods. And they’re all assholes.
He thought Hermes would be bright, full of fun. He’d heard stories of a young god who was a natural athlete and had the most mischievous grin. He supposes the ability to talk others into just about anything is true, but that’s just because it hasn’t been disproven yet.
But he stuck a diplomatic smile on his face, and went on anyway, terrified of disappointing his parents and losing the admiration from the other Olympians.
His mother sat, as always, to his father’s right, in a throne only slightly smaller. She did not speak to him.
Hermes in all his bland, odd wonder gives a two fingered salute. “Affirmative.” Hades stays with him to watch Hermes leave. They’ll both be going out the door to avoid suspicion in a camp far more active than the previous.
With so much on the line, Tony doesn’t try to hide his abilities from Yinsen, freely manipulating the cameras to hide their work and not attempting to slow down his process.
wrong. Because that loss was nothing compared to this. Survivors guilt was a problem for Steve after the ice, but
Because he’s JARVIS, amazing and undeservingly loyal, the AI doesn’t doubt if Tony is telling the truth. He just offers a possible answer to his question, tone sincere.
Tony knows he should be upset. Angry and frightened for Steve and the danger he left everyone in, but he doesn’t have the energy.
Tony has an almost immediate recovery time with the suit, so before long he’s looking down at Thor the Great and Stupid, watching the young Asgardian struggling to get back up again.
Hephaestus catches Hades’s eye, seeking some sort of reassurance. Of course, instead the god is draining his drink, his brow quirked in a way that’s definitely mocking.
The prisoners gather around the two men, waiting for direction. Orders. Something. Hephaestus looks at Steve who looks lost in thought.
As Tony blasts back upward and back toward home he realizes that with absolute certainty that Rhodey is going to track him down.
Tony opens his mouth for an annoying retort, but he’s cut off by Steve. “Let's start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works an awful lot like a HYDRA weapon.”
JARVIS asks him to start drinking chlorophyll to counteract the symptoms of the Palladium poisoning and Tony doesn’t even ask about the AI conducting his own research. He just agrees without an argument because who cares if he survives a few days more? It’s death either way.
“The rest of the raw materials Agent Barton can get his hands on pretty easily.  The only major component he still needs is a power source of high-energy density.  Something to kick-start the Cube,” Tony finishes explaining.
He scrambled up off the floor covered in unknown trinkets and tools, before warm hands reached out to steady him.
Two glasses of champagne in hand, Tony takes his time walking right past the agent and over to Pepper. She raises a brow as he passes the drink to her and takes a seat on the leather upholstered sofa.
Steve is going to have to go through all of that. His body was already exhausted after the first hike.
The whole world mourned and all Steve could do was selfishly think of his own loss, those in his own life being ripped away
Afraid of his feelings because he knew that the guilt would consume him otherwise. Tony has always been opposed to the manufacturing of weapons and he did it anyway.
To be honest, he wanted to call the whole thing off, but he can’t afford to miss the opportunity for good PR right now and he knows that.
When he arrives in the living room, Rhodey is sitting at the bar with his jacket slung over the chair. He’s nursing a drink, likely his usual scotch.
As should be expected though, similar incidents occur within the next several weeks and then months. Incidents that leave them jumping for the safety on their guns, heart in their throats.
So he can’t reach out, but in the back of his head, where he can still distantly feel the energy within the mansion, distinct and buzzing, a large presence shifts.
Steve looks down at the red, white, and blue monstrosity he’s wearing and shrugs with a self-deprecating grin. “Well the crowds that I’m used to are usually a little more uh…”
Steve shakes his head, as if in disbelief of his own behavior, and he should. Steve is so fucking smart. It would be stupid of Hephaestus to think that he wouldn’t notice all of the secrecy. What he doesn’t understand however, is how Steve can be such a fool to talk and confide in Hephaestus despite that.
. I only allowed you here because you were my son, but now I know you are the direct blood of my brother." He laughed in horrific delight, "I have no obligation anymore. Death and chaos run through your veins. And like your
“You say that now.” Koios looks over his shoulder. Heavy footsteps are heard in the train car behind him. “What you’ve witnessed today is only the beginning.”
Tony went in to the kitchen to gather all the ingredients that he needed, whilst Tobias just sat at the counter and chatted to his dad about his studies. Whilst talking, Tony notice that he’s missing the sausages that he needed for the breakfast, sure that might be a minor thing but that’s always been there traditional breakfast.
Thor looked at Steve with shame, of course he couldn’t think of anything, Anthony will never cause a civilian any harm. “ can’t think of any examples then, let’s continue with your other accusations. You say he’s selfish, but yet who was the one to give you a home, food and safety does that sound like a selfish man to you captain” Thor sneered as he moves closer to Steve. “Will a selfish man, build you and the entire team new gear and a new suit so that it will help you in battle. Would a selfish man make sure, all the damages that we and enemies have cause to be paid for by his own money. And would a selfish man defend us and shield us from the press so that we don’t get ask difficult questions, tell me Steven is that a selfish man to you” he panted.
“Yo J any updates yet?” Tobias spoke up to the AI, “As of right now Young Master Carter I have narrow down at least 10 possible location that look similar to the blue print I found. I am currently narrowing down a bit further to find the one that is most likely where Sir is kept” Jarvis informs.
“What the fuck have we done Nat? We are spies and we didn’t see that Tony was hiding his real self, why couldn’t we see it and how the fuck are we going to fix it?” Clint suddenly spoke. Natasha felt the same as Clint, she can tell Clint felt the most guilty besides Steve. He always had something against rich people from what Natasha had learned it’s due to the fact from the abuse that Clint and his brother suffered from people who deemed untouchable due to there social status.
“Ouch” the boy cried as Peggy flicks his ear “Behave Tobias, you made Doctor Banner more nervous, I apologise for my grandsons behaviour Doctor please don’t mind him” Peggy apologises. “Oh um it’s alright Ms Carter I’m already use with your own sons teasing as it is he didn’t cause any offence” Bruce assures Peggy.
A few seconds later a white light wraps around Tony. Thor and Steve were both amazed, but then the light disappears and Tony open his eyes. Thor give a giant grin “Anthony I can sense you have change you did it” he said with proudness in his voice.
Bruce look confused for a moment and he took the chance to look at everyone in the room there’s was more people then he realised. One he recognised it was Ms Carter and the other two he hadn’t got a clue who they were.
John told Tony once he had a lot of discrimination against him due to his race, because his mom was white and his dad was black. You see back then in the 60s when Davis was born, interracial relationships was still an issue so he got pick on a lot from the kids and the adults, and the older he got the worst it got too. But he never let it get to him once he got older as once he starting his career he met people who treated everyone equally and respected them too, of course Peggy was one of them and they been friends since he was just 20 years old, after all they both have the same abilities so it’s no wonder that they meet.
Oh great, (sigh) why does Rogers have to be like this. Every time they are on a mission, ok Tony can admit that he does disobey Rogers order, but not because for the hell of it. No, it’s because he found a better way to defeat the bad guy, or there is a innocent civilian that got caught in the cross fire. So yeah they are all valid reasons for his disobedience, but does the good Captain notice. Hell no, after the mission, after the debriefing, Rogers will come barging into Tony’s lab, floor or even the common room and what will he do shout at him and treats like a child, calling him selfish and telling to never do it again or he will kick him off the team blah blah blah.
Steve process the words that Nat spoke of, it’s true that maybe Steve feels a little bit jealous that Thor’s getting more attention than him at this moment in time, he might speak thor about this matter.
“Well Rogers this is my tower and I owned this kitchen, so excuse me I’d like to use my facilities” tony snark
Natasha groans as she starts to sit up, Clint helps her and stead us her “easy there” he gently soothes. “What about the other agents are thy okay?” She ask him, Clint had a sad look to his face “agent Marcus died on impact I couldn’t Save her” he said. Natasha was sad by this news she like Agent Marcus she had a good sense of compassion and responsibility “It wasn’t your fault Clint we couldn’t have known one of our own was Hydra, we thought we have gotten rid of them during the take down” she tries to reason.
But he doesn’t want the nightmares anymore and he doesn’t want the tense between them. After a few minutes of debating with himself, he finally made up his mind. He walk out the kitchen and got the elevator “ Jarvis can you take me to Starks floor please” Steve ask, “of course captain” Jarvis replied.
Once Clint and Natasha arrived they manage to get Natasha check out quickly, the doctors pop back her shoulder and clean and bandage her burns and cut. The Doctors said that she will heal quickly but suggested to ease from fighting for a week or so until the shoulder heals properly.
"Okay. Uh. Hi, Cap. If you're seeing this, then I'll probably be dead 'cause there is no way I would let you find this recording as long as I'm alive." Tony sighed before continuing, "I don't even know if you're alive, or dead, or disintegrated. I'm not sure I want to know unless it's the former. But I'm sorry. I wish I had called you earlier. Maybe things would be okay. Maybe we would've won. Or lose, but either way, it'll be better if we were together. Sorry I lashed out on Barnes. I know how much he means to you, I hope he's okay. It's been such a long time, Cap. I miss going on 1 AM ferryboat rides with you. I didn't really know what I was doing with the Avengers when you weren't here. There.
"What is home, Thor? He was my home. He needed me and I couldn't be there. I promised I would." Steve sounded so broken, he felt like he was the boy he was before the serum. "What about Barnes?" Rhodey asked. "He has Natasha. Sam has you. I wouldn't have anyone. Please, understand. Let me be selfish for once. I don't see a reason to save the world anymore, Rhodey. I lost mine a few years ago with a chance of having him back in my arms, but this is it. I can't bring him back. I couldn't save him. Let me stay with him, please." Tears left his eyes as he ran his thumb over Tony's blue lips. Tony must've been so cold and scared.
Things wouldn't be the same for them. Tony might still get nightmares even if Steve would be wrapping his arms around Tony's waist as they're sleeping. Tony wondered if Steve got nightmares too, he wondered if it's the same nightmares he kept getting.
Bucky did drop his glass at this point, though just as it shattered to pieces as his feet, he turned to wrap his arm around Steve. Burying his face against him, Bucky broke out into sobs, shaking all over as Tony’s words repeated in his head over and over. Both. He wanted them both. He was going to get to stay with Steve.
“You can tell him yourself later,” Pepper walked up to Steve, looking him over, lightly touching his chin to move his head from side to side. “Jarvis, I’m thinking a short style for him. He was a soldier, he would suit to look like one.”
“I’m okay, still sick in the morning,” Bucky said with a nervous smile, wishing they could just skip to the part where he found out his baby was okay. “I haven’t forgotten to take my vitamins or any of that.”
“Perfect, let me know what he says,” Tony finished his coffee, plunking the cup down with a smile on his face. “Try to think up some more acts, maybe a short play, some musicians, something like that. Just get back to me on that.”
“King Von Doom is right here, I think you should marry him,” Stane said finally, pursing his lips as he nodded. “I don’t think this was by chance, I think this is the world of the gods. They’ve brought Von Doom to us, and who better than him for you to marry? You’ll rule over the Iron kingdom as well as Latveria, you can combine them into one great land.”
Putting the piece of wire down, Tony took a long drink of his coffee and turned towards his walking table on the table with him. His father was right, he did need to work on the joints so it could walk more fluidly, he just didn’t want to admit that the man had been right. He also didn’t want to admit that Howard had found someone he’d like, someone he could fall in love with, and someone that could bring him children. In that moment, he wondered how much of Bucky’s personality was Howard’s programming, and he felt even sorrier for him.
“This is Clint, he’s here to kill me,” Bucky said nonchalantly, shrugging a bit, not moving from Steve’s side.
“I promise,” Bucky said softly, reaching up to rub at his eyes, wiping them on his flannel pants when he was done. “I really love you, Tony, I really do.”
“That’s fine, go ahead,” Tony nodded as Pepper hurried out, turning to face the two nervous looking men. “I thought whoever won would be a lot happier. One of you looks lost, and the other one looks like he wants to eat that one’s face every few minutes. You two know each other?”
“Then we’re both fortunate, and so are our people,” Tony said, leaning back in the chair further as he looked into the cup, wondering if the beverage was enchanted somehow. “This tea, is it magic?”
“Tony, Steve,” Howard said politely as if he was just there for a cup of tea instead of keeping one of their husbands hostage.
“Yeah, but…both of them…” Bucky said, looking up at Steve again as he tried to move over a bit more.
“Uhm, what else? What else can we really put?” Tony asked, thinking that over, catching the colourful ball of glass. “We can’t really specify that they need to be nice, or generous, or anything like that. Anyone can say they’re those things anyway.”
“I thought you needed the sleep,” Bucky slowly began to relax as his contraction eased off a bit. He still felt like he was going to throw up, though, he felt more nauseous now than on the airplane. “They’re only eight minutes apart, so it’s not a big deal yet. I don’t feel well, though, I feel really sick.”
“If we don’t find out, the bet is off, that’s the fairest way to do it,” Tony said, trying to keep a straight face. “And no, you have to look after dinner if you lose. You have to drive to town and get a large pizza.”
“That’s just how I want to be,” Bucky breathed, looking up at Tony as he positioned himself in front of him. Licking his lips, he pressed a delicate kiss to the tip of Tony’s cock as he looked up at him with wide, innocent eyes.
“Elektra Natchios is out…” Von Doom said immediately, trying to think as well. “I angered her a few years ago after a job she failed to complete for me. I don’t trust her, and she doesn’t trust me.”
“I was never at the bottom of that list,” Steve protested, pressing a kiss to Bucky’s shoulder, nuzzling the spot. “I was right up at the top. I was just a fucking idiot that couldn’t tell you that.”
“Maybe if you ask nice,” Steve teased, reaching to take his hand in his own before resting them both on Bucky.
“I haven’t heard you complain about the plan,” Von Doom said crisply, raising an eyebrow. “You’re not backing out of our agreement, are you?”
“The council helps with that,” Strange replied, summoning two cups of tea for them with a wave of his hand. “And my own studies help as well. I remind myself of what exists out there in terms of magic, the sorcerers I have met that could tear reality apart. I embrace my fears so I will not forget, and that keeps me grounded.”
“Where else would you be?” Tony laughed, heading back inside before he could hear the smart ass comment that would likely follow. That was two down, lots more to go, and time was running out. He still knew he was doing the right thing, even if things cost a bit more than he thought. He was helping a family, and it meant he didn’t have to marry some other money and power obsessed snob. Tony may not execute and torture his people, but that didn’t mean someone else wouldn’t.
“If things were different, we’d have kept you there and have the doctor come to us,” Steve said as he rubbed Bucky’s arm, looking down at him and feeling genuinely guilty this birth couldn’t go the way Bucky wanted it to. “There has to be a doctor and someone to help knock you out so you don’t feel her cutting into you. There’s no way you could deal with that if you stayed awake.”
“It’s a new type of steel manufactured by our top metallurgists, it’s twice the strength of normal steel and half the weight,” Von Doom said as he knelt down to pick up a single bar, bringing it over to put in Tony’s hand. “It was to be a wedding gift for you, but I hope you’ll accept it still. Maybe it could be put towards something good in their memory.”
“Can you imagine eating like this every morning, though? What is it you’re eating, you’ve had an insane amount of it,” Natasha sat up in her chair a little, putting her plate to the side as she laughed at her friend.
“If…if you want. Bucky?” Steve asked, not sure why Tony wanted their appointment to be pushed up, though he supposed that he was just stressed out.
“It might even be fun, you could enjoy yourself,” Namor added with a half smirk as Bucky turned to glare at him. “It’s possible.”
He felt like he could cry from happiness, he didn’t think that he could possibly feel like this. He had no clue how he was possibly going to go to sleep when he was this giddy. Though he knew he had to try if he was going to be getting up early tomorrow to deal with his goats before meeting the others for breakfast.
“What??” Bucky’s plate went flying as he jumped to his feet, his jaw dropped as he shook his head. “What were you thinking?”
“I want it to be like marrying Steve and Bucky even though they’re dead,” Tony clarified, looking at Stane as if he was challenging him to change his plans. “I loved them, I want them to be as loved in life as they were in death. I want them to be buried as Kings.”
“Y-yellow I think…” Bucky said as he sat up, watching as Tony walked over to his door to open it. “Like…if orange was an option, I’d say orange.”
“I know,” Bucky sighed, heading out the door, wondering if the guards would have jobs after tonight considering his head almost got cut off.
“I told them I had a nightmare,” Bucky grumbled, annoyance heavy in his voice. “I couldn’t think of anything else, so I said that, and now those guards will think I’m a fucking baby.”
“No, I’m fine,” Bucky got in the back seat, hugging his blanket around himself as he got as comfortable. “Can you sit with me, though? I don’t want to sit by myself.”
“I thought Tony wasn’t going to tell anyone we were here,” Steve frowned, wishing he could just see Tony so he could clear it all up.
“Honestly, I can’t say I know much about Canadian geography, I’ve never been there, but…” Steve pulled out his phone, glad that he’d remembered to charge it overnight, and looked up their new home on a map, his eyebrows raising. “That…is north.”
“Then Steven, place the ring on Tony’s right ring finger and pledge your life to him,” the priest said, the corner of his mouth tugging up into an amused smile. He hadn’t minded the interruption, he found Tony’s wish to be rather sweet.
“So what happened to you this morning?” Bucky asked, more interested in Steve than the video games, or himself.
“I didn’t know there were forty four types of solitaire,” Steve said, trying to sound interested rather than sad that Bucky obviously had more time on his hands than anyone he’d ever met. He should be out hanging out with friends, going to school and planning for his future, not mastering how to play games by himself.
“I was going to say the same thing, but grandfather and another set of his brothers for me,” Steve said, about to ask Bucky when he remembered that all he knew of his family were their names and their fate.
Laughing into her hands, Natasha watched as a stunned Bucky made his way over to the stairs, looking both confused and terrified. Bucky could do this, he could really make their lives better, she believed in him like no one else. She couldn’t wait to tell Namor that their plan actually worked, that they’d gotten Bucky into that castle. It was only a matter of time before Bucky let the king know how things really were for his citizens.
“What the-“ Stane’s mouth opened, but no words came out as he struggled to express himself. “What are you talking about?”
“Clint and I can get the bodies then, just tell us where to go,” Natasha got to her feet, ready to go get dressed and start this.
“You think?” Tony laughed once he caught his breath, shaking his head as he threw an arm around Bucky. “This was amazing, this was…I mean, do we ever need to leave this bed?”
“Of course, and I’m fine,” Tony said with a tight smile, not looking forward to what his brain was going to be subjecting him to in the quiet and dark once he didn’t have Steve there to pull him back from the edge. “I love you, Steve.”
“Your father would have wanted you to marry for love,” Stane corrected him before he could stop himself. “Or to better the position of the Kingdom. Your father loved the crown and his people, he was a good king.”
“I have…no idea,” Bucky examined the ring of fruit again, picking it up and giving it a little shake before shrugging and biting it. “It’s delicious. I don’t care what it’s called.”
“I can look into that,” Pepper said as she nodded, pausing her pencil on the paper as she looked up at him. “Tony, maybe you should take a couple days to relax after what happened. I’m all for throwing yourself into your rule, but maybe you should wait a few days. A few days won’t make you too late to fix some of these issues.”
Tony couldn’t speak for a second, opening his mouth a little as only a tiny strangled sound escaped. Looking down at the two other men in their t-shirts and boxers, Steve with his perfect build and Hollywood looks, and lithe and beautiful Bucky looking at him with wide sky blue eyes, he felt like he was going to melt into a puddle where he stood. Nodding, he reached out to take Bucky by the hand, letting him lead him to his side of the bed.
“Of course, anything,” Tony said with a sigh, nodding a little as he watched the other men. “…did you think I was in on this?”
By the time Bucky made it to bed that night, he was completely worn out from his day. He’d started it in the stables with his goats, making sure everyone was fed, watered, and taken care of. Next was an appointment at the tailors, being fitted for the suit for their wedding. After that, he met up with his fiancés in Steve’s studio where they drank, ate, and laughed as Steve worked at painting an apple. It had been a beautiful day, and as they all said their good nights to each other, he couldn’t wait to spend the next day with them as well.
“I get what you mean, it’s okay,” Steve said, settling against Tony, looking at the image of the three of them together that Tony used as a wallpaper on his laptop. “You’d rather this didn’t happen, but it did, and we’re here.”
“Hang on…” Bucky closed his eyes, kicking harder, his legs aching so much he could cry, but he wasn’t about to stop.
Steve couldn’t believe what he was hearing. This job sounded amazing, but he was still looking for the catch.
Timing the pain, Bucky discovered it wasn’t lasting as long as he felt. He was going to have to keep doing this, though Dr. Marner had told him early labour could last for days. Just another reason for him to do this alone. He was going to need Tony and Steve more as it got closer to the end, right now was easy compared to that, though he wished he could train the dog to go get his heating pad for his back muscles. Turning on the television, he kept a close eye on the watch in his hand, determined to keep everything under control.
“It’s going to be okay…” Bucky whispered, holding onto Tony tightly as he petted his back like Steve did for him. “Everything’s going to be okay. You’re not alone.”
“Wow…” Bucky said, looking at the picture of the kid wearing a harness with a leash attached. “…how old is that kid?”
“Sire…I mean, Tony….” Bucky was starting to worry, Stane was taking a while, what if they’d arrested Natasha. “About my friend who’s coming to live with me at the castle. She…out of desperation, she’s stolen a bit, and-“
“I think you’re right,” Steve replied sadly after a few seconds, rubbing Bucky’s shoulder. “I’m sorry I waited so long to apologize. I’m sorry we didn’t do this ages ago.”
“When do you think we’ll have another goat to slaughter? People are getting hungry around here, and they’re not pretty when they have empty bellies,” Natasha said as she got two pieces of bread for Bucky on a plate, looking around for anything else before giving up to go deliver it. “Sorry, I know you love those goats.”
“I think you’re going to have to find a way,” Rhodey turned his body more to face Tony, keeping a comforting hand on his shoulder. “You’re not going to be happy if you lose one of them, are you? Maybe by telling them this, one will walk away anyway, and you’ll know it wasn’t meant to be.”
Taking the glass of whiskey in his hand, Bucky sniffed at it carefully before he lifted the glass and downed the liquid. Blinking back tears, he felt like the inside of his chest was burning in an oddly pleasant way, the sweet taste of alcohol on his lips. This was so much better than the ale from the pubs, he could get used to this, even though he knew he shouldn’t. It did, however, amuse him when the amber drink caused Steve to cough. At least he could handle his alcohol.
“He found the gym,” Bucky said with a chuckle as he moved over to Tony’s side, looking at the robot with a cocked head. “So what does it do?”
“Then, yes, that’s what I want. Please,” Natasha couldn’t help the nervous smile that broke across her face. Looking at Bucky, she almost giggled when he gave her the same look.
“And now, so you can all get back to drinking and having fun, let’s get this draw over with!” Tony gestured for Stane to step forward, a large bowl of paper scraps in his hands. “I’ll pull out one piece of paper and read out the number, and then I want the owner of the ticket to put up their hand and step forward. Just the winner, please, we’ll have lots of time to bring your family to the castle tonight.”
“Are you sure?” Strange could see that something was bothering Tony, but he didn’t seem to be very forthright about it.
“Why do you worry about me? I just break up fights and catch thieves and that, and I have Sam in case someone tries something,” said Steve, frowning a little when he thought he saw something in the shadows of the alley near Sam.
“You don’t have to apologize,” said Steve as he cleared away their clothing, hanging it up as best he could before putting on some more casual wear. “And we can, just have a whiskey, maybe something sweet to eat. I’d like to just have some time with you.”
“Tony, you’re doing it again,” Steve interrupted again, pursing his lips together. “Just spit it out, man, you’re doing all our heads in.”
“So that’s why you did the lottery? Because you wanted to marry a peasant?” Steve asked, raising an eyebrow, shocked to hear all of this. This wasn’t what his view of Tony was at all, but he had to say he liked what he was hearing.
“Right on it,” Tony said as he walked over to his night stand, opening the top drawer and pulling out a bottle of lube with a silver label, passing it over to Steve. “It’s amazing, it lasts forever, you don’t need a ton. Sorry, back to being quiet, continue.”
Tony didn’t say a word as Von Doom got to his feet, glared at him, and then stormed his way to the doors. All he could do was smile as he disappeared from view and the heavy doors closed again. It had taken him years to find out where the poison in his life was coming from, and in minutes, he’d excised and disposed of it. Now he was truly open and ready to move forward into something much better and healthier.
“Good, good, I’m glad you’ll have people you get along with guarding you,” Tony smiled, popping some roast meat into his mouth, wondering what kind of wine they had in the tent. “Is that everything? No more surprises from either of you? No kids, no undercover spying, none of that?”
“Are you going to…am I going to jail for this?” Clint’s voice was small and concerned, hoping that he wasn’t going to have to try to break out of somewhere. Though he knew jail was the gentler of his options. He could hang or lose his head for this.
“Maybe you can one day, but right now two babies are plenty, so we’re going to be using birth control for when you feel up to that again,” Steve said, unable to stop looking at his two husbands and the pure happiness in their eyes as they watched the babies. “You don’t have to jump right back to that, I know you’re sore and tired.”
“Not your turn. It’s my turn,” Bucky pointed out, leaning forward more as he thought. “Okay, have you had to use your hand on yourself since coming to the castle? Before we found out we weren’t supposed to, that is.”
“You…” Bucky just laughed and blushed, pulling over a blanket to cover them both with. “I like when you say it too, you know.”
“I feel like I’m going to make a mess, it’s so clean,” Steve said, looking at the purple velvet couch, afraid to even touch it.
“I hope I last longer than that, I hope you like me enough to keep me around,” Steve said, wondering how much power Bucky had when it came to hiring and firing his companions, he would be disappointed if it was completely out of his hands. The teen should have some choice in life, it was painfully obvious he didn’t.
“So what do you do for your spare time?” Bucky decided he’d jump in and start the conversation between the three of them. Hopefully Steve wouldn’t have too much to add to it.
“I don’t know yet…” Tony trailed off, looking over at the wall at a picture of him posed with a greyhound. He hated that picture, mostly because the dog bit him afterwards. “I feel like I’ll know when the time is right, but for now, I have to keep perfecting my craft.”
“You don’t want that, I’d name them them something nerdy,” Tony laughed a little, trying to think of something off the top of his head that wasn’t his father’s name. “Uhm…Luke and Leia? No matter what we’re having, that’s it. They’re just Luke and Leia.”
“I’m always going to need you, don’t talk like I won’t,” Bucky replied, rolling onto his side, leaning his back against Tony’s chest as he reached for Steve. “Can we just…can we just be close like this tonight?”
“That sounds fine. Are you actually going to sleep tonight?” Stane asked, feeling accomplished for the evening, even if he hadn’t gotten to some of his paperwork.
“What if I’m horrible at this?” Bucky asked, taking Tony’s hand and standing up, staying close to his side as Tony led them from the room. “I don’t want to be disappointing. I’ve been thinking about this a lot, I mean, I spent tons of time by myself, but thinking is different than doing.”
“Bucky, you have nothing to be sorry for, you of anyone…” Tony looked up at him with teary eyes. “You don’t owe me anything…”
“I never would have let him do that to you…” Tony said, reaching out to touch Bucky, looking at Steve for a moment to okay it with him, waiting for his little nod to put a hand on his shoulder. “I’m so sorry, Bucky, I’m going to do the most I can to give you a wonderful life. I’m…I’m so, so sorry…”
“Here we go,” Natasha whispered, unaware that Sarah had said the same thing to her son. “Are you ready?”
“Don’t talk about yourself like you’re a piece of machinery, Bucky, you’re a living thing. Like a plant,” Tony explained, playing with Bucky’s metal fingers, already delighted with how smooth and cool they were. “Plants grow well inside under artificial lights, but when they have sunlight, and space, and I read somewhere that they need love too. Life is about learning at every age, you’re an adult now, and you’re going to have every opportunity. You’re going to grow, Bucky, you’ve got everything you need to, and I can’t wait to see what you become.”
“Ha ha, shut up,” Tony said as he put the wheelbarrow down to gather more sticks himself. “And the Internet knows how to make stew, so we’ll be fine. I can follow directions.”
“You two are so kind, she must have been pleased you were there,” Sarah picked her spoon up again, stirring the stew she made special for Steve earlier. “I made some of those biscuits you like, a nice lamb stew on a cold rainy day. You should have invited Sam over for supper.”
“Don’t beat yourself up any more,” said Bucky, burying his face against Steve’s neck, closing his eyes. “…let’s not talk about that any more, or Tony…let’s just sit like this for now. Let’s just pretend everything is going to be okay.”
“I like them both. Way too much,” Tony admitted after a moment, his brow furrowed as he frowned. “I can’t choose one, there’s no way. They’re both so clever and sweet and I want to know everything about them.”
“You may wear whatever you want, Mr. Rogers, very few people will see you down here,” Ms. Carr said as she pressed the button for the elevator, the doors opening immediately, closing once they’d stepped inside.
“I’m sorry,” frowned Tony, swallowing hard. “Is it hard for you to be here around them? I didn’t mean to…I mean, how could I have known, but…you know what I’m trying to say.”
“I’m…” pursing his lips, Bucky wasn’t sure if he should put up more walls or tear some down. Tony was staring at him though, he had to say something or he was going to look either boring or stupid. “I like to sing.”
“I don’t know…I feel like I’m…” Bucky closed his eyes, rubbing them with his free hand, and breathing slowly. “I’m fine…I’m being stupid, sorry.”
“Any time, Bucky,” Steve said, hoping that this was as good a first impression as it seemed. He still had a lot of time to fuck it up still, he hadn’t managed to push that idea out of his head. “Is there anything else you like that I can bring in for you? Or order? I can go to the cafeteria and get anything you want.”
“Sorry, I’m just trying to make conversation. It sucks in here,” Steve sighed, looking out a crack at the street below, the whole alley bathed in evening light. He was getting hungry, but he knew they would have to wait to eat, and they weren’t getting meals like they did in the castle either. He felt fully spoiled by the lifestyle he’d grown accustomed to.
“I agree, though…I was scared I was going to hurt you, and I didn’t want to do that,” Peggy said, getting herself a piece of paper towel to dry her eyes, sighing at the smudged make up on it. “You couldn’t have done this before I started my make up, jerk?”
“…babies…” Bucky whispered, his hands squeezing Tony and Steve’s once he realized they were there. “What about the babies? Where is he?”
“Oh we can handle it,” Fury said, his hands on his hips. “But it doesn’t mean we’ll enjoy ourselves.”
“We have do to this, Natasha and your mom deserve a good life,” Bucky’s voice trembled as he snuggled tighter against Steve. “I could live in a shack with you if it was just us, I wouldn’t care, but it’s not.”
“I do, good sir,” Bucky nodded a little before catching himself and stilling his head. “With a full heart and a clear head.”
“I think I speak for Steve and myself when I say fuck yes,” Tony said with a little laugh, his hands grasping Bucky’s thighs to keep them against him as he thrust into the younger man, feeling like his cock was getting harder with every precious sound his lover was making. It was going to be hard to last long with Bucky, everything about fucking him was like something straight from one of his personal fantasies.
“Maybe that will get you out of your room more often,” laughed Tony, delighted in how wide Steve’s eyes were as he looked around. Obviously Steve liked it, and he couldn’t ask for a better reaction than this.
“Let’s go make it more fun,” Tony laughed as they headed for the stairs, going up and into the east wing where Bucky and Steve had been staying. Tony was hoping to move them down the hall to his own room later, but he hadn’t had a good chance to bring it up. “Think we should sneak up on him?”
“So what were you going to say, baby?” Steve asked, looking at Bucky, then over his head to Tony on his other side. “He said he was going to tell me what the best thing about having two husbands is.”
“Six…” Steve set the cards down, holding up six fingers. “I drive a motorcycle to work and I will admit that it makes me feel more confident, I’m allergic to bees but I’ve only been stung once, I’ve had my nose broken twice and almost broken a lot more because I tend to break up fights if I see them, I love golden retrievers and I want one as soon as I am more stable, my favourite colour is blue, and I like watching Star Trek. Do you know what that is?”
“If it makes you feel any better, he doesn’t blame you in the least. And neither do I,” Steve said, watching as Tony buried his face against his hands again, feeling sorry that he was taking all of this upon himself. “We both saw how you reacted, you didn’t know, Tony. None of this was your idea or your doing, and I really don’t think Bucky’s going to start thinking that any time soon. It’s the opposite, to be truthful, he knows you saved him, he knows you’re doing everything to protect him right now.”
“Now that we’re getting closer to him being moved, we had minimized the staff and were relying on your predecessor to keep him company. After his death, there has been a short period of time where Bucky has been alone more often, he’s not always up to socializing with me or some of the others. He was very attached to his last companion,” Ms. Carr said, knowing just how attached his companion was getting to him, which was why they’d had to get rid of the man. He hadn’t given them any other choice, really. “He’s taken it very hard, and he’s nervous about the move, we thought it would be best not to stress him with lots of new people, I think you’re going to be enough for him to swallow for now.”
“Do you have a favourite character?” Steve asked, very aware of how upset Bucky was, wishing he’d taken psychology in school instead of art. Bucky didn’t seem to want to talk, and he was pretty sure he shouldn’t push him.
“They told me to be at the square when the number is announced though, they’ll move onto another number if someone doesn’t step forward then,” Sarah tucked the ticket back into her apron, patting it as if to secure it. “Not that I think either of are going to forget to go to that.”
“Just leave him alone, Rogers,” Natasha said before Steve could open his mouth, noting the crushed expression on the man’s face. “I’m not trying to start anything with you. None of us want to bring problems into this, we have enough to stress out over without…”
Steve felt his own emotions bubbling up as he watched Bucky cry into his hand, finally stepping forward to take a seat next to him. Putting his arm around Bucky’s shoulders, he pulled him in close, hugging him as tightly as he could. He didn’t ever want to let him go again.
“Fuck…” Bucky breathed, reaching down under the blankets to give his cock a squeeze, letting out a shaky moan. Just imagining Tony and Steve touching him at the same time, their fingers probing inside of him, stretching him out to make him ready, he couldn’t help himself. He didn’t know if he was supposed to refrain from touching himself, but it was fucking hard not to. Steve and Tony were both gorgeous, and strong, and sexy, and he didn’t know how he was supposed to last four days without even kissing them.
“You do, I’m excited,” Tony agreed, sitting up on the couch and giving Bucky his undivided attention as he clasped his hands together. “Will you please sing it for us and absolutely make our day?”
“It’s a portable ultrasound, like the one they used to check my organs with, I remembered how to use it from watching them,” Bucky said softly, his voice quiet as he slowly passed the probe from hand to hand.
“I think we killed him,” Tony laughed as he slowly withdrew from Steve’s body, helping him to flop to the side so he could recover. He wasn’t done yet, though, and neither was Bucky, and staring at Bucky’s ass presented in the air, he knew exactly what he wanted. “Bucky, you good to keep going?”
“We’re not going to lose you, or our kids, just trust in us, okay?” Steve said, wishing he could believe himself as he said that. He wanted the burden of fear to be on himself and Tony, he didn’t want Bucky to have that cloud lingering over him for what could be his last time on Earth. He just really had to hope that he was being pessimistic for nothing.
“Don’t you dare apologize for that, don’t!” Steve said, watching as Tony tensed up even more in the driver seat, keeping his arm around Bucky as he tried not to let the stress of the situation get to him even more. “We are not angry at you, and we’re not going to be upset with whatever you choose. There is nothing for you to feel sorry for, so get that thought out of your head. Tony’s right, let’s deal with this when we’ve all calmed down, okay? Oh thank god, is that the airport?”
“Bucky, may I?” Tony asked, getting to his feet to go over, waiting for Bucky to nod before running his fingers over the scar. “He really got it all, didn’t he?”
“You mentioned once there was a council you go to,” Tony said, crossing his arms to keep himself from fiddling with more of the little bottles. They had wisps of coloured smoke in them, and he couldn’t stop wondering what it was.
“No, you’re going to be using the same type of entrance as you were used to, just at a different location,” Ms. Carr said as she reached out for the door handle, pushing it open and stepping into a white room with neon lighting overhead. “Come, you can finally meet Bucky now.”
“Tony, this could be your grief talking,” Stane sighed, going to take a seat next to Tony’s, reaching over to put a hand on his arm. “You’re hurting, you have just had an immense loss. You need time to grieve properly, and I think making decisions as a King in your state could be dangerous. You’re not thinking straight.”
“How about this…” Steve said, looking up from the cards into Bucky’s eyes. “You know my name and that I sometimes play baseball, and that’s not much for someone you’re supposed to trust. So you’re going to pick a card, and I’m going to tell you that many things about myself.” Fanning out the cards, he held them towards Bucky, giving him a warm smile.
“I think he’d be a hard pressed to be moreso,” Steve said, trying to brush all the dirt from his laughing daughter’s head. “Tony, this one is you’re doing, I swear.”
“Yeah, they don’t want to look at it either though,” Bucky laughed dryly, peeking out the side of his eye to look at Tony. Gods, he was handsome. “I keep it pretty covered though.”
“I can get these,” Steve said as he picked up the biggest bag, about to grab another when Tony grabbed his arm. “What is it?”
“That. And for you to tell me I’m yours,” Bucky purred, parting his legs further and willing himself to relax as Steve’s index finger gently probed inside him before slipping all the way in. Letting out a gasp, Bucky squeezed down around his finger, biting his own lip. “That feels a lot better when someone else does it.”
Walking into the courtyard, he was surprised to see Tony outside, even if the man had sent word to meet him there. He was used to seeing Tony in his workshop at this time of the day, or maybe in the throne room if he was being forced to be more hands on.  He wasn’t going to complain, though the lack of a table likely meant they wouldn’t be sharing a drink together. Pity, he already knew he was going to need one.
“I have to stay at my optimal weight,” Bucky explained casually, staring blankly over at the corner where the chair had been. “I’m not supposed to gain or lose weight or they modify my diet accordingly. It’s…it’s annoying, but it’s…” Sighing softly, he shook his head again, not wanting to get into this whole mess just yet. Steve seemed nice, he didn’t need to know that Bucky was a freak of nature.
“That, if you’re wondering, is my private whiskey,” Tony grinned, handing his glass back to the servant, who took Steve and Bucky’s as well before disappearing over to the side again. “It was aged much longer than the stuff you may have tried.”
“Works for me,” Tony chuckled as he looked over at the cabinet in the corner, hoping his surprise was still in there. “Well, shall we get comfortable before we begin to celebrate?”
“I hope they’re something good, he deserves some happiness after today,” Tony turned his attention to the fetal monitor, not entirely sure what numbers were good or not. He was going to have to get filled in by the doctor. “I hope he doesn’t wake up until we know they’re okay.”
“I do, good sir, with a full heart and a clear head,” Tony said as he looked between Bucky and Steve, his face aching from smiling so much.
“I-I don’t…” Steve shook his head, turning his attention to the biscuit in his hand that he’d just dunked in his stew. Blowing on the gravy to cool, he fought back his own guilt for the moment.
“Easy, easy…” Tony led Bucky inside the clinic as Steve, carrying the bag, went to talk to the secretary for a moment before they were directed through the door and down a hallway. Keeping a tight hold on his young husband, they walked to the end of the hall and took a right to a small waiting room. “Have a seat, Buck, I don’t think we’ll be waiting here long.”
“I mean, she was pretty much my mom, I could keep her here,” Bucky shrugged, tilting his head as he kept his eyes on Steve, waiting for him to say he couldn’t give this up.
“Even if they came from a medical experiment?” Bucky whispered, turning his head to look Steve in the eye. “Even if they give me to Tony and I really like him, why would he want to be with a mess like me? That’s why I worry about ending up in a prison again, Tony and his normal boyfriend raising our kids. I couldn’t blame him.”
“We’ll take care of that later, right now’s about you. What do you think, Steve?” Tony asked, looking at the other man with a wide smile. “I have to admit, I’m being kind of selfish because I’m dying to watch you two fuck.”
“Because you’d be dead if I didn’t do it,” Bucky sighed softly, closing his eyes in the dark again. “No matter how angry I was at you, I knew your life meant more than my arm, so I was glad I did it. I was glad you were okay, I just hated you.”
“Oh, they’re terrible, people are always falling out of them, they let animals in your house, rain just keeps pouring in,” Steve said, shaking his head and trying to look as serious as possible. Meeting Bucky’s eyes, they both quickly gave way to laughter. “You’re not missing anything, I promise, it’s more of a hassle than anything.”
Stane spun around when he heard the knock on the door, taking a moment to clear his throat and straighten his robes. Reaching onto his desk, he picked up the glass of water he’d recently poured for himself. Taking a sip, he coughed a little again, before turning his body towards the door.
