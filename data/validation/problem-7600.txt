“You should be grateful,” Ty said, his voice icy.  “This is as close as you’ll ever get to the University, Ashony.” The word was mocking, in a childish sing-song.  “Father’s just humoring you, and as stupid as you are, I think you know it.”
“That’s my bright boy,” his mother said, turning back to the pot.  She filled a second bowl, glancing back at him as she did.  “What did Mrs. Doyle tell you?”
“The Council shall reconvene tomorrow at lunch,” Carol declared.
“Doesn't make any sense if you've just got to drive back tomorrow,” he agreed.  “Hotel okay?”
And he had no idea how to make that answer sound like a lie.
He didn't bother to lift his head at Pepper's voice. He heard the door shut, and the familiar sound of her heels. “I can't do this,” he said. “I know it's not fair. I know it's cruel. But Pep. I can't do this anymore. I can't-”
“You've got the photo, and a copy of the license, and-”
He shook his head.  “Right,” he muttered under his breath.  “Silence.  That’s what you’re after, Rogers.  Right. Pull the other one.”
“There aren’t enough hedges in the world,” Bruce said, his voice dire, but he let Bobbi propel him out of the kitchen.
“We found him,” Pepper said, stepping into his arms.  Rhodey hugged her tight, his lips gentle on the crown of her head.  “Thank God.  We found him.”
“You alienated half of the city’s culinary scene in one three minute video,” Fury said, as Thor collected Tony’s empty cup and returned to his blender.  Fury considered Tony over the rim of his cup, one eyebrow arched.  “That’s efficient.  Even for you.”
“And how pleased I am to hear it,” T’Challa said, shaking his head.  “Then you are here to meet people, in the hopes that in five or ten years, you’ll agree to marry one of them.”
Stark's eyes flicked up towards the ceiling, an eyeroll without any of the effort.  "I don't care," he said, cutting Steve off without a qualm.  "Unless you're planning on selling the plans for my light fixture to my neighbors, I don't see how it really impacts anything that you looked at a stack of paper that I left out in the middle of a room in plain view of anyone who passed by."  He leaned forward, his dusty fingers spread across the surface of the table.  "But honestly, I didn't expect anyone who could actually-"  He stopped.  "You can read these.  Well enough to catch a drafting error."
“Maybe not, but I was...”  He frowned.  “At loose ends, Tony.  I had Bucky and the truck and this place and that was it.  I had the work with the soup kitchens, I knew a lot of people, but I missed the rush.  I missed a restaurant kitchen, I missed the people, I missed the pressure and the madness and the personalities.  I missed a lot.”
“It happens a lot in this group,” Steve agreed.  “Maybe we should stop giving advice.”
“They’re already on the way,” Phil said, and Clint hung up.
Tony spread his hands.  “Really, Drew?”
And he absolutely didn’t miss that.  Tony took a long sip of his coffee, letting it burn all the way down the length of his throat.  No.  He didn’t miss that at all.
“I can be sneaky if I want to be,” Steve called after him, and a woman walking by started, hopping back towards the shopfronts.  Steve gave her what he hoped was a reassuring smile, and she gave him a suspicious look before scampering away.  “Well.  If I want to be.”
Startled, Tony’s head swung around.  “I-”
“Typing's hard, too, I know, I know,” she said.  There was a faint buzz from her hip pocket, and she fumbled at her pants, finally coming up with her phone.  “Huh.”
Tony’s eyes flicked in Steve’s direction, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. “I mean, you could try.  He seems very durable.”
“You got it,” Tony said.   He pushed himself to his feet and dusted off the seat of his pants.  “Do you want to go watch the movie now?”  He held out a hand, and DJ took it, his grip surprisingly strong.
Internally, Tony cursed himself.  “Right.”  He slid into the jacket, letting Jarvis set it in place on his shoulders.  “So.  Bread and butter.”
“He’s always got a get rich quick scheme or two in his pocket, but he knows not to look a gift horse in the mouth.  This place isn’t much, but it’s his foot in the door.  If he gets fired…”  Billy’s voice trailed away, and he shrugged.  “He’ll be starting over from scratch.  For him to be gone this long?”  He shook his head.  “It’s not normal, let’s just put it that way.”
DJ looked up from his tablet, blinking hard to make his eyes focus.  Steve was smiling down at him, and DJ tried to smile back.  “Yes,” he said.  He closed the invitation with a flick of his fingertip and set the tablet aside.  He rocked forward in his seat, his hands braced on either side of his hips, his toes curling up tight.  “It’s…”  He made a face.  “Confusing.”
Tony's head rolled in that direction, not really wanting to, but not able to stop himself.  He'd known what he was going to see, even before he did.   Somehow, he'd known.  But still, the sight of Steve Rogers, sprawled out on the bed next to him, sound asleep, was a shock.
“Friendship bracelet,” Darcy said.  “I taught him.”
“He is quite well, and it is very kind of you to inquire,” Jarvis said.  He lead the way up the stairs, around the hall.  The hammering got louder as they got closer, and Steve wondered what kind of repairs they were making.  A single gunman shouldn't have been able to do that much damage, not if he'd been captured as quickly as they'd reported.
Ellen gaped at her. "What is wrong with-"
“Yeah, I’m the-” Jess broke off to yawn, her whole face scrunching up with the force of it.  “I’m the crazy one of the group.  Stop biting my style.”
“You really can’t.”
“Despite my best efforts, you never seem to have gotten comfortable with it,” Jarvis said.  He smiled, just a little.  “What are you going to do about DJ?”
DJ dug into his pocket, wiggling his arm until he came up with Furbro, the little lizard darting around his fingers.  His feet spread on the back of DJ’s hand, Furbro looked around, head darting from one side to the other.  DJ stroked the back of his head with one fingertip.  “Stay with Steve?” he said, and the lizard tipped his head back, blinking up at him.
Steve chuckled. “Right. We're just going to stay here. In this car.”
“But...  You don't need it,” Tony pointed out.  He waved a hand behind him.  “There's-  There's a bathroom.  You have your own bathroom.  It's very nice, it's not as nice as mine, but still, there's a shower and everything.”
“Stop fussing,” Tony said, even as he relaxed into the double embrace of Steve’s arms and the coat.  “I’m fine.”  Steve’s hand found his again, and Tony raised it to his lips, pressing a kiss to Steve’s knuckles.  “I missed you.”
While Steve was still sputtering, Tony rocked up onto his knees, catching Steve’s head in his hands.  A few quick rubs, and he’d worked the shampoo into Steve’s hair.  “There,” he said, the pressure of his hands changing, his fingers smoothing over the lines of Steve’s head.  “That’s not so bad, is it?”
“Perhaps you should go upstairs,” Clea said, her voice bright, as Strange brought up both hands, light forming into complex patterns around his fingertips.  “The lilies have been…  Disrespectful.”
“Codfish.  And beans.”  Steve nodded.  “You met Rhodey at boarding school, didn’t you?  In Boston.”
Something-
Tony stared down at his Twitter app.  “And the reply, ‘I meant twelve each,’” he said, his voice reverent.  He looked up.  “Right.  Right.  So.”  He nodded.  “I am so turned on right now I’m actually dizzy.”
Steve nodded.  "Yeah." He took a deep breath.  "I'm sorry."
“He won't,” Jarvis agreed, setting a small plate of strudel in front of Pepper.  He looked at DJ.  “Would you like some tea?”  DJ shook his head.  “Lemonade?”
Peter sighed  “And anyway, Natasha’d  never bet on anything involving Miss Potts.”
“Probably.  I found them,” Jess said, blinking at him from behind a curtain of dark hair.  “Seriously, though, how do you wake up Clint, because he’s snoring like a congested heifer and I really need a shower.”
Pepper slipped her arm through his, her fingers locking on his elbow.  "Let's all go," she said, her teeth flashing in a bright smile.
“Here we are,” Tony agreed.  He rolled his head on his neck, trying to loosen the muscles.  “Right where you left us.”
This time, the burst of words was very loud, and Tony held the phone away from his ear.  He pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Well, of course I still lie about THAT, Pepper, but in my defense, so do you!  I mean, that’s not nearly the same thing about lying about the fact that I was dying, and yes, that was wrong, I should not have-”
“Right.”  Tony didn’t look in his direction, but he heard Stark shift in his seat, one foot bouncing against the floor.  “Right.  So, guess your father and mine might have had some things in common.”  Stark exhaled.  “So here’s something I’ve figured out.  When you were a kid, and your father was doing the talk show circuit, relaxing on couches in front of a camera with a scotch on the rocks and few quick anecdotes?  I’m guessing you came up.”
“Please go away,” she said.  “Let me die in peace.”
“Worst case,” Tony said, and Steve laughed against his skin. “It ranked just above, or below, as the case may be, the possibility that you were married and sneaking off to see your wife and what was probably half a dozen lovely blonde children.”
Tony smiled.  “I love you, too,” he said, building miracles with numbers and simple gestures.  “Let’s get our kid back.”
“Terrible,” she agreed.
Natasha smiled at him.  “Why don't we try that?  And if it doesn't work, if it's wrong, we can always go back to working on your routine.  Okay?”
“Raggle Muffler!” DJ said, and then he bounced out of sight.
Tony caught his hand and pressed a kiss against his palm.  “Promise,” he said, and gave Steve a brisk shove.  “On your back.  And I’ll show you just how fine I feel.”
“I'm very wily, but Happy gave me a badge.  It's got my picture on it and everything,” Steve said.
“Not panicking,” DJ said.
"I know." DJ resisted the urge to flop on the counter.  It was harder than it should've been.
“Perhaps, if the young master should care to share,” Jarvis said.  “Dinner tonight is roasted chicken, mashed potatoes and giblet gravy, green beans and pearl onions, roast chestnut stuffing and sweet cranberry orange aspic.”
The silence stretched a very long time.  Tony cleared his throat.  “Hello?”
He stopped.  “I don’t know.  But I want to find out.”
“Oh, are you going to wake up now?” he asked, his fingers smoothing over Tony's cheek. “Hi,” he whispered.
“Welcome home,” Tony said, not even looking up from his work.  “How was your day?”
“That was also in the running,” Tony admitted, tapping his pencil against his cheek.  “Not as popular, though, since honestly-” He braced a foot on top of his desk.  “No one believes me when I say it.”
“Makes sense,” Sam said.
"Is it true?"  The boy hunched a little deeper into his sweatshirt, his shoulders coming forward, bony and hard beneath the soft fabric.  His dark eyes met Steve's without flinching, but his breathing was quick, hard.  "Are you like me?" His adam's apple bobbed as he swallowed.  "Are you gay?"  His eyes fluttered, the blinking too fast, too hard.  "Or, I mean, bi?"
It made no sense, but at the same time, it absolutely made sense.  It might've been a stretch, but if there was even a slight chance, Steve was willing to take it.  “You know what?” he said to Rhodey, who opened his eyes, blinking up at Steve.  “I think I will see if I can find a-” He waved a hand towards the pool.  “Something to swim in.”
“Thanks for that vote of confidence, Buck,” Steve said, scraping the bottom of his bowl with his spoon, and reaching for the pot.
“Right,” Tony said to Charlie.  “She’s-”  He looked back at the camera.  “I don’t know what is going on here, and that is not a position I like to be in.”
Jarvis sighed.  “Though I may be biased, I must say, it’s not as terrible a prospect as you might think.”
Phil’s chin dipped in a nod. “Right,” he said, and Clint threw himself backwards into his chair.
“Yeah, that's...  That's probably going to happen again,” Tony admitted.  He pushed himself to his feet.  “You have breakfast yet?”
“Definitely effective in the short term,” Strange said.  He gave DJ a gentle push towards the staircase.  “Off you go, you know where the library is, I’ll be right behind you.”  He leaned in, adding in a whisper, “Don’t eat the cake.”
“I'll take them off your hands,” Pepper offered.  She reached for them and Tony moved them out of reach.
Callie shrunk back behind Clint, her shaking fingers scrambling against his vest, trying to get a grip.  Clint patted her hand, letting her hold on.  “Don't worry.  He's a grump, but he's a good guy,” he said.  “Just don't lend him money.”
“Really.  This isn't bad.”
He stood there, swaying on his bare feet.  He was proud of himself.  He was still holding his coffee cup.  Steve was laughing so hard now that he was bent double, his arms wrapped around his stomach as he laughed himself sick.  Tony glared at him, then lifted one bare foot and kicked at a puddle, splashing Steve's legs with a wave of water.  It was childish, but damn if it didn't help.
“But if you ever visit, I'll ask Bernie if we can borrow her cat,” Steve called.
“Almost have everything,” DJ said.  He took another bite of the oatmeal.  “Almost.”
Tony stared at him.  "Five."
Tony pressed both hands to his face.  “How much of parenting, percentage wise, is regretting the loopholes that your child finds in what you tell him to do?”
“Literally or figuratively?” Natasha asked, her head popping up over the edge of the dock.  She tossed a piece of a machine onto the dock.  Steve was pretty sure it used to be a submarine.  Or at least a part of a submarine.  “Deal with that, will you?”
“We're going to end up in an expose, you know that right?” he asked.
Steve's mouth dropped open.  “What?  Why would you-”
“Lame Duck Prime Minister looking to get himself into the history books,” Jesse said.  She patted Ellen's hip.  “It's fine.  Everyone else was caught just as off guard.  We got here, right?”
“Because Hill wanted him here,” Tony agreed.  “The question is…”  He wiped his hands on a rag.  “Why?”
That was met with silence, and after a moment, Tony glanced up to find Peter smiling at him.  “It’s worked out okay for me,” he said.
Steve pulled a sack of apples and a couple of oranges out of the fridge, dropping them onto the cutting board.  “Is DJ charging, or asleep?”
“Steve?”
“You’re both going to be on an extended sugar high,” Darcy said, reaching over and stealing a petit four off of Harris’ plate.  He pushed it over so she had more access.  “Up til the middle of the night, then-” She tossed the cake into her mouth.  “Boom. Hard crash.”
“Chore?”
The certainty of others, the life, love, sight, hearing of others.”
The relief on DJ’s face was answer enough.  But he nodded anyway.
"When you're out on the streets, Miss, you learn right quick when people have bad intentions towards you," he said.  He blinked, an expression of consideration crossing his young face.  "Or maybe only the ones who make it do.  An' the ones who don't, no one ever hears from them again, do they?"
“Thank,” DJ said. His nose wrinkled.  “Thank you.”
“Just so we're clear,” Tony said, and he didn't know how to end that, so he just gave a firm nod and headed for the gym.
“It is.  But you're not giving it back once it's fixed,” Val said.  “Are you?”  DJ shrugged, and she shook her head.  “They're going to figure it out eventually, Deej.”
“Spying?”
Greer reached for a napkin, wincing in sympathy.  “Here,” she said, handing it over.
“Cool,” Jesse called from the other room.  “I like the ugly cup.  It might not be pretty, but it's got character.  And a good shape.”  There was a pause, and Ellen paused, waiting for the other shoe to drop.  “Like me.”
He pitched the towel over his shoulder.  “Now get out.”
DJ made a face.  “He has…  Opinions,” he said, his voice somehow ominous.
Sue took it.  "He is, but-"
Steve realized his mouth was hanging open.  He closed it.  "I see," he said, and he didn't.  But anything else he could say would only get him in trouble, and he'd had his fill of trouble.
From the depths of his armchair, DJ peeked out from within his blanket cocoon, his dark eyes sleepy.  "Yes," he said, the word dissolving into a yawn.  He wiggled a bit, finding a comfortable spot in the creaky old chair.
Jan took a sip of her tea.  “Go, Yankees!” she said, her voice chipper.
“I'm Commander Henry Gyrich, head of Project Wideawake,” the voice said, seemingly unconcerned.  “And you are interfering with a government operation.”
Peter stared straight ahead, his mouth pursed up tight.  “I was HUNGRY,” he said, with the sort of wounded dignity that only a teenager could manage.  Steve hid his smile behind his coffee cup.
“Right.  I’ll just…  Stay right here.  Where it’s safe.”
“Fine,” Pepper said, her eyes rolling.  “You’re going to go out with Tony while he’s drinking.”
“Wonderful.”  Tony took a drink, savoring the taste.  “And where do we go from there?”
“I think it was something like, ‘it’s cool in the daytime and warm at night and it’s just the right size for me,’” Shuri said, and Bucky buried his face in his folded arms.  Shuri grinned at him. “And my brother looks at him, and looks at the hut, and he’s covered in half-dry clay, and a goat is screaming at him, and we’ve sent about a third of an army out here, one and two at a time, trying to dislodge him, and-”
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve ran towards the Nursery nearly barrelling in to his omega as the door opened.
Peter and Tony have a play date, Peter does not behave and suffers the consequences.
The sound of the lift doors opening and of voices quietly talking roused Tony somewhat from his groggy thoughts, he supposed he should get up and greet the two doctors but the effort involved seemed too much and any way if Steve had wanted him to get up he would have ordered him to present himself by now. Decision made he snuggled back down careful not to put any pressure on either his throbbing backside or his aching stomach, after all he was being a good little omega and not making any decisions for himself just waiting for instructions from his Alpha.
“Tony, Winter is coming up to guard you and the pups, he is in charge and you will be obedient and do everything he asks.  I know it is not an ideal way for you to be introduced but I expect you to behave in a manner fitting for Captain America’s Omega.
“That’s it sweetheart, let go and embrace the all the sensations flowing through you, pleasure and pain, whatever it takes.”
Rogers had suddenly stopped with the frowny face and harsh words a couple of months ago and had taken to just studying him quietly whenever they were in the same space which had become more often after the avengers moved into his tower and don’t asking how that had happened, one minute he was alone and the next Pepper had been ushering the other team members out of the elevator and showing them their rooms and the communal living area that just happened to be his expansive living room.
The air in the penthouse was thick with Alpha pheromones, Tony’s holes were gushing sweet smelling slick to add to the mix. His erect nipples rock hard and aching under the lustful gaze of all the Alphas.
“Now whilst you have Pup strapped down can you to check out his anal glands, he does not seem to be producing much natural slick, we were wondering if this could be a side-effect of the long-term use of suppressors?”
Bruce sent Petey to the Milking Barn to join May Cow, he wanted to spend as much time with the healers as he could and they had offered to find him the perfect Jotun Omega for Hulk, last night’s omega had not been shapely enough for Hulk although Bruce had found her pleasing.
Tony begins to wish he had engaged his brain to mouth filter when the hard angry stares of his Alphas land on him seconds after the words leave his mouth.
******************* Flash Back**********************************
There was pain, so much pain, he felt as though his heart was being ripped out of his chest, all his limbs were cracking and twisting, as his lungs struggled to take in air.  Darkness took him as he screamed in agony and fear, his mind fracturing as the black thread twisting down his flesh frayed then disintegrated leaving a red scar looping down his arm.
Cold blue eyes looked down at him lips thinned in a disappointed line, even as gentle fingers wiped away his dripping tears of pain and frustration at his failure to complete the first part of his punishment in one attempt.  It did not matter that his Alpha has stacked the odds against him, Tony hated to lose at anything but especially when it was connected to his being an omega.
“Well since you asked so nicely, hold on tight you are going to get your wish.”
“As you can see Alpha Rogers your omega’s cock has settled at 2 inches in penile length, he can still feel sensation and become aroused when it is touched but he will not be able to get an erection  or ejaculate.  I suggest prostrate milking as a good source of relief, you may find that he can still achieve orgasm but with great difficulty the further the pregnancy advances.
I cannot give him any strong pain killers because of the pups, so two paracetamol four times a day.  Ensure that you feed him the food supplements I have designed for him as they contain extra boosts of femme omega hormones which will ensure his body adapts and softens.  A feeding gag will be the best method, so that he cannot spit it out and also he will not be aware of the supplements he is ingesting.
Darcy gives birth and Tony reflects on how his life has changed.
“Mr President, your omega has been blessed with my seed, she will be forever fertile, and every breeding will be multiples.  I hope that my omega has sufficiently satisfied you, if not please let Sira know and the breeder will receive extra punishment on top of her daily scheduled punishment.”
She would just have to ensure that she avoided the bastard, unless it was absolutely necessary.
Steve gathered his omega into his arms an held him tight as he sobbed, placing gentle kisses all over his face once he had calmed down.
Steve stood back and took a good long look at his beautiful omega Tony was naked fresh from the shower, his skin smooth and soft not a hair in sight from the neck down.  His soft belly and widening hips has become more pronounced over the past week, his nipples constantly erect and sensitive to any kind of stimulation.
‘Ben I will always love and hold you in my heart, but I need to look forward,  there is no changing what has happened these past few weeks, I must adjust and make the most of my new life, for Peter’s sake as well as my own.  Please forgive me but the thought of carrying pups, even though they are not my own fills that empty part of me, to no longer be that ‘poor barren omega’.
Nick looked furious and the bewildered as Tony started to sing.
The lighting technician couldn’t believe his luck, quickly flicking his phone on to film mode he hid behind the lighting panels angling the lens at the half open office door.
The Winter Soldier bonds with his omega.
“Awww baby, don’t cry, so perfect for daddy, look at you filling you diaper for the first time, daddy is so proud of you. Now let’s get you all cleaned up ready for your next conditioning treatment, Dr Gottlieb and Nurse Meyer will be along soon.”
“Well go on then, get it over with, just let me know how much Captain America is angry and disappointed in me and no longer wants to bond with such a useless omega.”
Steve’s large hands pinned Tony to the wall and with one thrust breached his hole entering him fully making Tony scream with pain and pleasure.  Each thrust of his huge cock lifted Tony off his feet the rubber cuffs tightening around his ankles.  The constant burn of his Alpha’s cock stretching his abused hole wide and massaging his prostrate made him scream louder and louder as the pressure built.  Steve bit down on his mating mark and jerked Tony’s cock once before releasing it.
Drawing in a deep breath he could almost taste the sweet honeyed scent of the omega, but what caused him to rear back away from the unconscious omega was the underlying redwood scent of his Alpha.  It couldn’t be, his mind screamed there was only one person that scent belonged to and he would be long dead by now. He had to be mistaken no two Alpha’s had the same scent, Stevie, that was the name he could now put to the blond and blue eyed face, how could he have forgotten that scrawny, sickly stubborn boy who had change in to a perfect golden god.
Steve and Winter reward their omega for his good behaviour.
The strange Hulk’s face disappeared to be replaced by ‘not my Steve’s’ smiling down at him, the warm hand stroking the back of his neck, soothing his jagged nerves, flooding his system with calming pheromones.  The heady scent of Alpha approval as he leaned into the touch caused his whole body to relax, the pain receding to a distant ache.
He cried out when the Captain forced his cock in alongside his fist, the pain excruciating as he forced both deep into his battered hole. He didn’t want to acknowledge that he was pushing back to meet each thrust or that his thighs were coated with slick and his useless cock was leaking and semi hard.
A wave of pheromones released from his scent glands mixed with his Alpha’s, clever fingers had him squirming and humping his Alpha’s leg trying get some friction on his caged cock.  Lost in a haze of lust he failed to notice until it was too late that Steve’s cock was once again engorged and his knot pressing against the roof of his mouth.
Chapter 3
Steve caught Tony as he fell, wrapping him tightly in the blanket Natasha had thrust at him.
Thirty minutes later he swabbed the titanium ring piercing her now enlarged and exposed clit with an antiseptic wipe, her pitiful whimpers of pain annoying him, stupid bitch should be grateful that she was being giving the chance to contribute to the strengthening and growth of the Avengers Pack.   Releasing her from the stirrups and straps that had been holding her in place on the examination table, he led her over to the breeding bench and secured her firmly in place, ass high in the air legs spread wide so her sex was fully exposed,
Pepper and Steve initiated the final step of their plan, Tony was initially admitted to Mountain Rise for detox treatment subject to further treatment depending on the outcome of their meeting with the Judge.  Pepper had been fully confidant that the Judge would act in their favour, she had left nothing to chance.  Intelligent, ruthless and ambitious nothing would get in her way, Tony’s fate was sealed the moment of Pepper and Steve’s first meeting when she had placed the brochure for Mountain Rise in his hands, not the usual Brochure containing the Standard Conditioning Therapies but the one that only available to the extremely wealthy Elite of Society.
“Winter come join me, we are going to do this together, his boy pussy will stretch wide enough to take us both at the same time, once we have him hanging off our knots, we will bond with him.”
“Listen doll, you don’t get any say in what happens with your body, we own you!  As of 10 am tomorrow The Omega Rights Law will be repealed, followed by the re-instatement of Alpha Pack Law, there will then be a full vote on the new Stark Omega Registration Bill which will be ratified using the ‘special measures’ clause available to the President during times of crisis. By mid-day tomorrow all Omegas will be subject to Government Registration and Alpha Rule.
There are very few reasons why the courts would revoke that decision, catastrophic mental or physical injury, mental illness, if the minor is convicted of a criminal offence or on the very rare occasion that a minor has managed to hide their……. Oh, dam! what the hell did Howard Stark do, it was Howard not Tony, Fury am I right?”
Steve’s hands caressed his stomach and chest as he spoke, stroking and kneading the soft flesh and pinching his nipples until the stood hard and erect.
“Yes Alphas, anything you want, just make me come!”
“That’s it baby, so good, now suck clean daddy’s fingers such a messy boy.”
Tony felt restless after his shower, his sex ached, and his asshole felt incredibly empty, he wasn’t used to not being plugged continuously.  He stared at himself in the mirror, his eyes drawn to his smooth mons, his fingers tracing the slight bump where his cock had been.  It was the first time he had looked properly, or even touched himself in months. He remembered clearly the day he had finally broken and asked Him to have it removed completely.
“Well done sweet boy, taking Daddy’s knot, going to keep you full of my milk all the time, plug your hole so nothing can escape.  Daddy will knot you every day to insure, that you remember that you belong to him and no one else.
Shaking his head, he smirked at the thought of his needy omega who seemed to have no idea that he was on the verge of his very first unadulterated heat.  He felt his cock swell within the tight confines of his uniform and the ridge of skin around its base starting to soften and expand making room for his knot to form when he finally bred his omega.
Steve watches, fascinated as Hunk manhandles Tony in to a pair of frilly black and white cow patterned knickers with a very short ruffle skirt attached.  He palmed his throbbing cock as Hulk pulled the thong tight splitting the omega’s fat labia lips before tugging it up to disappear in to his crack.
Tony sobbed over and over again, when he became aware of the growing wet patch on his t-shirt and the floor underneath his bottom his cries became louder, his cheeks flushed with mortification.
Pepper over the last year had become more stressed and angry with his behaviour, he knew since the events of New York and the worm hole his behaviour had become more erratic and out of control.  He constantly felt he needed to prove himself amongst a team that consisted of alphas and one beta, and an organisation that did not allow omegas into the field and barely tolerated them in administrative and scientific jobs.
When he arrived at the forge it was to see his mother being scrubbed down like a horse at the water pump.  Colborn was dragging a piece of burlap between her spread thighs, the rough material chafing her cunt lips and clit. Frigga was moaning like a cheap whore, her hips thrusting forward as much as her bulging stomach would allow, when the blacksmith scrubbed her milk laden breasts and hard nipples, she cried out her body going rigid as she came.
Clint snorted, “I wouldn’t let Tony hear you call him that, still got the bruise on my shin from the first and last time I ever called him that.”
“Captain Rogers there is a disturbance in Sir’s Workshop, my sensors project that a portal will open within the next two minutes.”
“Omega is this what you truly want, to be mine?”
Omega Tony was awake and sipping on one the cum shakes that he seemed to be addicted to when he entered the communal lounge, propped up on a mound of pillows he motioned for him to climb into is nest.  Peter settled beside Tony and as soon as the other omega curled into him all the tension and stress he had been feeling melted away, burying his head in Tony’s shoulder he allowed himself to shed a few tears before basking in the amazing soothing scent of the pregnant omega.
“Look at you such a fucking fat slutty omega, heavy with pups and still panting for it like a bitch in heat.”
Steve lifted his omega off his knot;
Grabbing Tony’s calves, he pushed them up and outwards so his knees were splayed either side of his pregnant stomach, still bound cock and cunt on full display for Bucky.
Bucky finds some toys to play with but not in a good way.
It did not absolve Steve completely from his actions but he could admit to himself that Steve had never been shown any other way to treat an omega, his views and ideals were firmly of his original generation and unfortunately for Tony these were being backed by a club of extremely conservative Alphas.  Pepper had played her cards well the deck had been firmly stacked against Tony from the beginning.
“Tony, oh god, l am so happy, l wanted so badly to believe you were really my Tony, but it was just so difficult.  Now that you have explained it all, l can see how you didn’t stand a chance against those monsters, after all you are only an omega and consequently hard wired to eventually submit.  I just never really thought about you truly being and omega because you never acted like one apart from that one time, but now though l won’t make that mistake again and will treat you just how an omega should be.
He skimmed past the explicit video evidence of Tony thoroughly enjoying being knotted by the Captain, the punishment sessions though, he watched and had to readjust his cock a few times.   He knew that he wanted his own omega, but had been stopped by Hulk situation and the gamma radiation in his blood and semen.
Steve frowned as he picked up on his omega’s thoughts, they were really going to have to break Tony of his assumption that he had any say in how his Alphas acted.  Perhaps Bucky was right and he had been too soft on Tony, well now that he had Bucky they would both just have to show their omega how to behave properly as a bonded and bred omega.
“Don’t you ever dare to cover them up, they are mine!”  he growled.
After Bruce had departed to spend the day at his Clinic he made his way back to his suite, it was time to release his omega and indulge in a full session o his play room to test his omega’s stamina.
“Please Alphas fuck me harder!  Need it bad, please, please fill me with your cum!  Nn..need it so bad, fill my slutty holes,  milk my tits, don’t stop want your  cocks to drown me in cum, please, please let me prove to you both that I can be the perfect cum dump for you.”
“There you are my pretty little omega, just in time for the main event, now hold still whilst I turn you over, going to do this the traditional way, face down arse up, legs wide so that virgin pussy is on display.
Rough hands dragged him out of the cubicle, tearing off his pants and shirt and throwing his shoes across the floor. The cold marble of the vanity chilled his backside as the man stood between his spread legs fondling his silk covered cock. Struggling and kicking out, earned him a hard slap across his face, the hand on his cock tightening until he was crying with pain.
Odin bowed his head.
The limo pulled away once everybody was seated, Steve had Pepper sit opposite him so he could stare at her to see how long she could keep eye contact and whether she would backdown when he used his Alpha Voice on her.
Steve could scent the jealousy and envy rolling off the other Alphas, Tony’s pheromones teasing and beguiling them.  Spinning Tony so was facing the crowd, he stroked his fingers over the omega’s hidden cock until the skin retracted and his tiny perfect cock was fully on display.
“Tony your awake, I have run a warm bath which will help with the pain, lets get you out of your wet diaper.  Oh, sweetie look how pretty your tiny pee pee is, I do think it has gotten even smaller overnight.”
**********************************
Tony was about to shout out ‘No Pepper it’s a trap’ but Sir’s hand covered his mouth just as he took a breath.
His body felt as though it was on fire his blood boiling in his veins the need to be fucked and filled consumed him, he needed the emptiness in his belly to be gone.
Your penis will eventually break the hard mucus plug and fully connect the birth canal to his breeding pouch when the pups are ready to be born. You will know the signs as he will start producing copious amounts of slick from his birthing canal to aid in the delivery.”
Thor bought his soul orb back to
Confused, glazed eyes stared at him for a minute, Steve swore he could see the moment Tony’s brain engaged, quickly picking up on the one procedure that was not in keeping with his injuries. Steve surreptitiously pressed the nurses call button, wanting to put off the lengthy explanation until Tony had been given some pain relief and a doctor was present to explain all the medical procedures that had taken place and what his ongoing treatment regime would be. After that it would be his responsibility as Pack Alpha and potential Mate to explain what being an Omega meant with regards to being part of their Pack, what set rules he would be expected to adhere to and then to negotiate and come to an agreement on some of the softer rules.
Lunchtime saw him lead his newly bonded omega into the dining room, by a thin chain leash attached to his nose ring.  He had him naked and plugged, rings through the base of each nipple, clit and pussy lips fully pierced with a row of rings.
“Tony, can you look at me please sweet heart?  We need to have a serious talk about how being an Omega, changes things for the Avengers Pack and for the Avengers Initiative going forward.  Firstly, let me say that we are all happy to have you as our Pack Omega, to be honest even before the revelation we all made it part of our daily routine to look out for you and make sure that you ate and slept and didn’t work yourself to death.  We are all kicking ourselves for not recognising the now glaringly obvious signs of an Omega in distress.
Steve timed 10 minutes then move Tony to suckle on her other breast.  By the time Tony had drunk his full, Pepper was moaning and restlessly moving her legs, her nipples swollen and red.
It had been two months since he had been branded, stripped of all body hair, and had his long hair cropped short and suffered the indignity of being given an enema. It was nothing compared to the torture he had received at the hands of Hydra when they had first captured him, but it was the care with which it was done and their subsequent handling of him that was throwing him off balance. Even when he lashed out, kicking, and shouting then rarely punished him, they talked to him, explaining why they were doing these things, how they were turning him in to a worthwhile, productive stud, rather than throwing him into the fighting pit, to be killed, after all a one armed, semi enhanced human was no match for the beasts that ruled the Pits.
“Miss Darcy, you will come with us, you seem to have forgotten your invitation to a late supper with the President. Now if you come without a fuss I am sure that your brother will not find himself under arrest for suspected terrorist activities, after all trespassing on government property and attempting to subvert presidential staff away from their responsibilities be could construed as a hostile act.”
Tony will be conscious through this final detox and suffer all that it entails, it will be serve as a deterrent and reminder of what he will have to endure if he falls back in to the cycle of drinking and drug taking.  Yes, I know that with the structured life style he will lead in future it is highly unlikely that this will occur but as you have stated he will need to be perceived to be adult and independent in public during certain occasions.
Tony woke sandwiched between his Alphas, their cocks warming in his holes, the early morning light shone through the blinds letting him know that he could have another half hour of warmth and comfort before he needed to start his morning routine.  Snuggling into Steve’s chest he closed his eyes, content to play cock warmer for his Alphas, this was the calm before the storm as he could feel the curl of warmth forming in his womb and the teasing ache of his pussyfoot it gently pulsed around Steve’s cock.  It would be a few days before his heat struck, he wanted to see Loki’s baby being born and the First Lady’s.  A small spiteful part of him wanted to see them suffer as he had, when giving birth to the boys.
Steve pumped the remaining dildo up in to Daisy’s bitch hole, making sure to fuck her clit with each thrust.   He could tell from her throaty moans that she was nearing her peak, nodding towards Winter they withdrew until only the tips of their cocks and the dildos filled her holes, only when they heard the first moo did they slam back in , their cocks and the dildos filing her holes to the hilt in one thrust, the combined shock and force tipping their milk cow over the edge as her loud vocal Moos echoed round the lab.
“Mmmm…. But as they say, there is no pleasure without pain Alpha.  Now I want your big fat cock stretching my cunt and my ass plugged up with your cum, then I am going to sleep and when I wake up you can deal with the freak out I am going to have about giving birth to triplets.”
He was convinced that everyone knew what was going on, especially whenever a low moan escaped his lips when Steve randomly shifted his hips to push up against his prostrate.  He tried his best not to squirm or moan, he knew he usually had more discipline that this, but coming off his heat must be messing with his control.  He squeezed his inner walls as he pushed down on Steve’s thick length, wanting to feel every inch inside him, hoping no one would notice if he kept his movements small and subtle.
“There we go sweetie, just keep sucking hard on Pepper’s nipples and in a few minutes her milk will start to flow, and you can taste how yummy it is.
“Hmm highly disturbing, this reads like a suicide note but there are no mentions in any of the medical files of a recent attempt.”
Widow coaxed Pepper’s cock out of its sheath and into the studded cock cage, ensuring that the two hard outer studs would rest up against her balls that were covered by the sheath.
Tony lay splayed on the bed, where Steve had carried him after the two Alphas had finished rubbing their, cum onto his skin and hair. His limbs felt like jelly, his holes ached with the need to be filled and the soreness of his throat felt comforting, he couldn’t help but smile knowing that he had taken Bruce/Hulk’s cock deep into his throat and not panicked or passed out.
Steve’s cocks coating his omega’s cunt walls with cum.  Grinding his hips down he pushes his knot further in his balls flush against Tony’s ass. Ravaging his omega’s mouth swallowing his cries he catches the last fleeting taste of milk with his tongue.
“This look is what I would call ‘English Rose’, feminine and pretty, ideal for the outfits that you will be wearing, and you can adapt the eye colour depending on the colour of your dress.
Steve and Bucky woke early the next morning, Steve unamused that his omega was not warming his cock as was his duty each morning. Bucky once again sucked down Steve’s cock, the stupid fucking omega would pay for this he thought to himself.  Sucking cock was for omegas and betas, he had only sucked Steve’s cock yesterday to weaken the Alpha’s resistance to bonding.  He might not be the top Alpha but it didn’t mean Stevie could treat him like an omega.
Happy was red in the face as he shouted,
“No! No, no, no!   That did not happen, it’s not real, you are planting false memories.
Well, he would play this stupid game, and when Thor finally showed himself, he would kill him and reclaim his omega, Tony belonged to him and no one else.
Thor’s hand pressed down on Pup’s exposed stomach, fingers caressing the smooth pale skin.
It will have a happy ending,  Tony and Steve do love each other.
He glared down into his omega’s fevered eyes heat sweat trickling down his face, the taste of honey and vanilla heat pheromones ramped up his arousal with each suck on the bond mark, the sweet scent of slick making his already engorged cock ache with the need to fuck into his omega’s needy hole.
“Settle down baby boy, just relax and enjoying the feeling of my knot filling your boy cunt.  You are perfectly safe, your tight little hole cradling my knot is all the support you need.”
Steve adored how flustered Tony looked, and how he kept glancing down at his caged cock, his mitt covered hands twitching as he restrained himself from touching.  To keep him a bit more off balance before his treatment he decided that now was the time to slip on the new omega drawers that were a bit more, fancy that the plain ones he had been wearing for the last few days.  The soft white cotton was trimmed with delicate lace around the edges of the legs, mother of pearl buttons lined the expanding waistband.  But it was the thin lace panel that held his caged cock in place, yet allowed it to be seen, that had his breath quickening and is own cock stirring.
It had only taken a moment after the loud obnoxious little man had entered the Heli- Carrier conference room for Steve to know that the Omega was his and that nothing or no one was going to stand in his way of claiming him.  Stark’s scent was bitter sweet, tainted with the smell of alcohol and metal.  Stress and anxiety underlay the projected air of confidence and arrogance.
His nipple were taut nubs sticking up from his chest through constant stimulation whether by fingers or mouth, teeth marks marred the surrounding flesh.  His scent glands and mating mark throbbed in time with each thrust the skin surrounding them swollen and bruised where sharp teeth had worried and bitten.
"Okay, give me a-"
And then he was gone.  Pepper stared after him, and then turned to stare at Tony.  “That was shameless.”
“Yes.”  Tony smiled.  “Do you want to marry me right now, Steve?  Because I like to think I know you pretty well, and you’re-”  His smile flickered and died.  “What’s wrong?”
“Yeah, yeah, can’t have you asking Tony out while wearing a wetsuit or something.”
“Got me in trouble with the boss, if I get fired, I’m holding you responsible,” Tony said, pointing a finger in Steve’s direction.  “You.  Personally responsible.”
“Scones, pastries, coffee, and fruit,” Steve called back.  “Want something else?”
"Relax," Tony said.  His eyes slid in Steve's direction.  "You look like you're about to face a firing squad."
Val heaved an audible sigh, propping her hands on her hips.  “You're both going to be in such trouble,” she said.
“Tony.”
“I've mellowed,” Steve said, smoothing Tony's hair away from his face.
Steve stared at him, looking for some sign of annoyance or anger on his face, but there was nothing, nothing but Tony, relaxed and smiling.  “One second,” he said, and before he could think better of it, he took a step back, and another, retreating, and then half jogging, half sprinting towards the kitchen, his hands pulling down on the hem of his shirt with every step.
DJ rested his chin on the kitchen table, staring morosely at the cat.  “I could.”
“No,” Steve gritted out, adjusting the shield on his arm.  “Save the chatter for the debrief.”
She gave his arm one last squeeze, and stepped back.  “Pepper, how do you LIVE with him?” she asked.
Tony held his gaze, his mind rolling through the options.  “You paid Hammer to grab him.”
With each step he took away from the door, the less space he found he had, the plants growing up steadily on both sides of the walkway.  By the time he was halfway through the greenhouse, he was pushing swaths of leaves out of his way, forcing his way towards the back. Feeling like he’d somehow entered a jungle, he ducked his way past what seemed to be a full grown tree, finding his way at last to something approaching an open space.
Tony's lips twitched.  "It's not the same.  I'm not Captain America."
Steve exhaled.  “No,” he said, and the way that Tony had looked around his flat made sense now.  He waited for the door to be shut behind Tony before he moved to the other side of the car, sliding into the back seat next to Tony.  He glanced over as Happy started the car.  “I would’ve gotten word to you, if he’d shown up here.”
Steve forced his fingers to relax.  As the fabric slipped through his fingers, it took a remarkable amount of self-control to keep from grabbing it again.  “I don’t know,” he gritted out.  “Nearly kill yourself?”  Tony blinked at him, so obviously confused that Steve just sighed.  “You could’ve fallen?”
To his surprise, something like a blush rose on Tony's cheeks.  He turned away, reaching for his champagne glass.  “Of course I will,” he said, before draining his glass.  “I-”  He looked up, his smile steady and warm.  “Yes.  Thank you, Steve.”
"Or joining a firing squad," Steve agreed.
“Well, you're pretty durable, so probably-” Tony started, and Steve cut him off.
Stark reached out, his hand closing on the dowel. He drew it with a flick of his wrist.  "Kneel."
Once upon a time.
Tony twisted around in his seat.  “What do you mean, can I hack them?  No.  I can’t-”  He pressed a hand to his face.  “No.”
Steve looked down at himself, nonplussed.  Stark tipped his head to the side.  “I think it's quite nice.  You know.  For a loaner.”  He tapped a finger against his lips, his eyes locked on Steve.  Steve shifted his weight, embarrassed, and Stark nodded.  “A bit tight, but many a man would do the same if he had shoulders like that.”
There was a beat of silence.  “I’m somehow very thankful I survived that,” Harris said to no one in particular.  Darcy held up her glass, and he clinked his against hers.  He looked at DJ.  “You okay?”
Rhodey looked at Jarvis.  “Tony’s made a mess of it, I take it?”
"Did you know he can blow glass?" Stark asked Steve, who didn't know if he should laugh or throw something directly at his head.  "Do you want some new windows?  He can-"
“Battle to the death!” Tony said.
For the first time, the words seemed to sink in for Steve, his eyes blinking.  “Your place,” he corrected, his fingertips dipping beneath the waistband of Tony's pants, his rough fingertips coaxing Tony closer.  “Mine is all the way out in Brooklyn and yours is-”  He sucked in a slow, heavy breath, and he was a mess already, his hair tumbled over his forehead, his shirt askew.  “Yours is right there.”
Steve pinched his nose between his index finger and thumb.  “Clint...”
“Thank me by not getting me killed,” Tony said.  He headed up the stairs, tugging her along with him.  “Or arrested.”  He glanced back at her.  “Jan?”
Darcy grabbed the churro back from him, and looked around his arm at the face of his phone.  “Busted,” she said, her voice saccharine.
"Thank you," Steve said, jogging around to the back.  Peter was fast, fast and efficient.  And he'd been trained in Tony's kitchen, everything was done with precision, and everything was done right.  Even as he climbed up into the truck, Peter was wiping down the counters, a bucket of bleach water steaming next to his elbow.  Steve exhaled, some of the strain going out of his shoulders.  "Really.  Thank you."
“Oh, do you think so?” he pulled the sweater out of the box, holding it up in front of him.  It fell against his chest like it was made for him.
Tony reached up, gently pushing Steve’s arm down.  “Did you think that I wouldn’t notice that no matter what bed we end up in, or where I was when I fell asleep, when I wake up, you’re always on the side of the bed between me and the door.” His jaw went tight.  “The last thing I need is a human shield, Steve.”
She took a large bite, and chewed with vicious intent.  “This.” She bounced the spoon on the edge of the bowl.  “Do you even know what you’re doing?” she asked Bucky.
“That’s a community service,” Bucky said.  “It’s a service.  I provide our community.  Out of the goodness of my heart.  And also because it’s funny.”
Tony grinned after them, and snagged a dishcloth from the stack. “Shift change,” he said, his voice brisk.  “Off my station, Banner.”
“I know, I got a watch.” Without waiting for an invitation, Isaiah shouldered his way past Steve, waving a brown bakery bag in his general direction.  “Wasn’t sure you did.”
“Anyone who tried would’ve given me back,” Tony said with a wry smile.  “Probably before they’d gotten to the edge of the property, and I’ve only improved with age.”  He reached for his coffee, and Obie held out a hand.
“Because politicians exist,” Tony said.  He reached out, adjusting Steve’s sweatshirt.  Steve let him, standing still as Tony smoothed the worst of the wrinkles out of the fabric.  “We should at least get something better to wear.”
Tony reached up, dragging Steve down.  “It’s almost like you missed me,” he whispered, just barely able to see Steve grin.
He pushed himself to his feet, his face hot, and DJ was there, his hands coming up in a burst of joyous energy, flower petals tumbling from his fingers.  Laughing, Steve tried to dodge them, but DJ wasn't the only one throwing them now, Peter and Natasha and Bobbi were behind him, all of them tossing petals into the air, so many that it was like a storm.
“That seems like cheating, though,” Tony said.  He broke a crab rangoon in half and offered a piece to Steve.
Stark grinned at him.  "You meant what you said, my God, you really have no filter, do you?"  But he was still smiling when he went back to the file.  "And I meant, did the man you arrested have anything useful to say?"
Tony's head came up, his eyes meeting Steve's.  “Well, then, I don't care.  And right now, right here, no one else matters.”  There was a twinkle in his eyes, amused and brilliant.  “I'm the only one, the only thing, that you have to worry about, Steve.”
DJ yawned.  “Waiting,” he said, and yawned again.  He blinked, slow and sleepy.  “Late.”
“I mean, not all the time,” Clint said.
“True,” Pepper said.  “But the third quarter-”
“Right,” Clint repeated.  “So.  We're going to stay here and see if being less freaked out helps.  Does that sound okay?”
Steve nodded, but there was a muscle jumping in his jaw now.  “And he signed the rights to these things away?”
Sue was already shaking her head.  “It’s one per family for us,” she said, ignoring the way both Franklin and Johnny groaned at that.  “We will take one.”
“And we're all looking forward to that,” Steve said.  He gave Luke a slight smile.  “Right now, though, I need a dance partner.” He held out a hand.  “Wanna dance?”
Steve sank down onto the bench, exhaustion sweeping over him like a wave.  "My significant other goes to space," he said, scraping a hand over his face.  "Does that count?"
“I demand a double serving of dessert for this, Jarvis.”
“Steve Rogers,” Steve said.
"Ah."  Rhodey came up behind her, peering over her shoulder.  Down on the sidewalk below them, Officer Rogers was fending off a half dozen boys with a faint smile, ignoring as they circled him, stealing pieces of penny candy from his pockets.  He shook his trunchon at them, making them scatter, but they were all laughing, skittering just out of reach before darting back under his guard.  Rhodey braced a hand on the windowframe, his eyes narrowing.  "Not what I expected."
“Probably.”  Clea stepped onto the landing, a long parade of books bouncing along in her wake.  “What good timing.  I made a cake, I’ll fetch you a slice.”
“And yet, you’re resisting because you can’t bear to make a mess that the housekeeping staff would have to clean up, or to waste food,” Tony told him.  DJ, who had been digging through the platters, moved a few closer to him, well out of Harris’ reach.
"Fix his sleeves before I forget myself and start adjusting how his pants hang," Miss Van Dyne said, her voice dire, and Stark caught Steve's lapels, pulling him back around.
“No,” Bruce said.  “Of course n-”
“Put food in your mouth and shut up for a minute,” Harris told him.  He looked at DJ, who was chewing on his straw.  “You hungry?” He reached for the tray that Sitwell had left for them.  “The sandwiches are actually really good here.”
“I was not, but always pleased to hear that someone doesn’t want to punch me in the face,” Tony said.  “Balances my karma a bit for the many, many people who do.”
DJ grinned up at him.  “Yes,” he said, and offered Tony a screwdriver.
“It doesn’t say anything on the sign,” Peter said, because he was Peter, and he hadn’t learned yet.  Nebula’s pen stilled on the page.  Peter blinked at her.  “There…  There is no sign.”
The guard nodded.  "They are."  She reached into her shirt pocket, pulling out a slim white envelope with the StarkIndustries logo stamped on it.  She held it out to the boy.  "But you can always use one more."
“That sounds more threatening than it is,” Darcy told Trip.
Steve nodded.  “And I find myself out of the ice and into the fire,” he said.  He took a deep breath.  “I can’t promise you anything, you Majesty.”
“Nope.  Wrong answer.  Say, 'yes, Hawkeye, as it turns out, my neighbors are asshole bigots and it sucks that I have to deal with that, but they're the problem, not me,” he said.  He tried to smile.  “Right?”
"To Hammer House?" Steve opened the folder, flipping through the neat, typewritten pages.  "Why?"
Tony waved a hand through the air, cutting the call.  “Banner, where do you think you’re going?”
“Uh-huh.” Things were a mess in here, and Tony made a deliberate effort to ignore that.  Nothing was on fire and at this point, he’d take that.  The box was on the top shelf, and he collected it with hands that weren’t quite steady.
DJ frowned at him.  “I like fixing it.”
At some point, someone was going to ask him that question, and they were going to do it in front of a tv camera.  At some point, some point very, very soon, someone was going to ask him if he loved Tony Stark.
Cynthia smiled. “I bet they'd like that,” she said.  “Now, if you don't mind, I should get back to work before I get fired.”
"We're not watching New Hope again.  We're not.  I could recite the whole movie."
She blinked at him.  "The reception."  Tony and Steve just stared at her, and she frowned at them.  "You are having a reception, aren't you?"
“I always endeavor to be as such, sir, thank you.”
Clint nodded.  “Yeah, are you mad about that, or are you mad about the eloping thing?” he said.
“She set me up,” Tony said, his mouth hanging open.  “Son of a bitch, she-”
Tony tried to swallow, but his throat felt like sand.  “Won’t.  Get out,” he managed, the words forced past a mouth that refused to help him.
Love was a incoming tide.  Slow.  Steady.
"And as soon as we get home, we'll be pouring that into you," Steve said.  Tony glared at him, dark eyes malevolent over the collar of his coat.  Steve grinned at him.  "Yay!"
Clint shrugged.  “I don’t have a better one.  Is this because I told Nat to fake my time sheets?”
“I don't have a letterman jacket, sorry.”
“Very good, sir,” Jarvis said.  “Perhaps a comb?”
"Oh, well, if Beyoncé had been single, this would never have happened," Steve agreed, tossing his hands in the air.  "I might be gay, but Beyoncé transcends sexuality."
“-We stand up for what we believe, no matter the odds.”  The words had a strange, uneven cadence, like a half remembered poem, but each word was solid, hard and unrelenting.  “When the mob and the-” He stared up, his hands flexing at his sides, the metal on his fingers rattling as his hands formed red fists.  “And the press and the whole WORLD tell you to move-”
Shuri grinned at her.  “There is so much to see, so much to do, who can sit still?”  Okoye held out an apple, and Shuri studied it, her head tipped to the side.  “Who is this for?  Me?  Or her?”
“Captain Rogers had already finished his run and returned to the building before the rain began,” Jarvis said.  “He is on his way up now.”
He looked up at Sam.  “Nothing,” he said.  “Talking-” He flopped a hand through the air.  “Talking to myself.”  He leaned forward, and God, his back was killing him. “How do you do that?”
“Do not bench press anything,” Steve said, moving a stack of books out of the way.
DJ looked at Steve.  “No,” Steve told him, trying to hide his smile.
Stark's smile stretched.  "I shall leave the nonsense to you.  I've got real world problems to solve."
“The soap might have something to do with that,” Tony said, because he loved being helpful.  He especially loved being helpful when it made Steve look like he was considering strangling him.  Tony smiled at him, bright and easy.  “You did remember the soap, didn’t you?”
“You’ll ruin his dinner, darling,” Strange said, ducking as the books whirled past them.
“Very good, sir,” the man said, reaching for his ledger.  “Will you be paying now, or will we be billing you?”
"Oh," Clint said, understanding dawning.  "I'm the fuckup uncle."
Stark nodded.  “Trust me, I’m as surprised as you are,” he said.
“Know what?  I’m skipping out the back,” Tony said, “and leaving you with the bill.”  He gathered up the piles of noodles, twisting them into neat knots, ready to be cooked.  He took a step back.  “Well?”
He leaned forward, one knee drawn up against his chest.  “The company has a twitter, and I know when it’s him, when he’s the one running it.  He tells us all their bad game ideas.  I think, mostly to shame them into not using them.  And he replies to people, giving them hints, when they’re stuck.”  He rested his chin on his knee.  “He has a dog that comes to the office sometimes, and the dog takes over social media those days.  And I think he’s dating someone there.
“For now.” Steve looked back down at his sketchbook.  The random doodles that he’d been working on somehow seemed to have turned into a detailed drawing of Tony’s hands.  He stared down at it, wondering if he could even trust himself anymore.
Ellen blinked at her.  “How expensive?”
“Then I guess we can learn together.”
Steve kissed him, and Tony’s arms dropped, looping around Steve’s waist, his fingers digging into the fabric of his shirt.  For a long, infinitely long moment, Steve just sank into the kiss, savoring the pressure of Tony’s grip, the weight of Tony’s body against his.  The loud, sharp blast of a car horn cut made them both jump, and Tony pulled away, his lips parted, his shoulders heaving with the force of his breathing.
“Small mercies.  I was expecting to find him climbing the shelves in the butler's pantry.”  The man was lanky and loose limbed, with broad shoulders and well muscled arms revealed by his rolled up sleeves.  His wheat blonde hair was cut short on the sides, and longer on top.  He peered at Steve with one blurry eye.  "Who's this?" he asked, his voice a slow, easy drawl.
Tony followed after her.  As if they weren’t already in trouble.
He leaned back.  "Hey, Rhodey, did you see-"
Tony glared at DJ.  DJ did not appear to notice.  "Prop up his hand.  I need it."
When he was distracted with the wine, Tony reached over, spearing one of the tortellini off of his plate.  Steve didn't even look in his direction, just swatted at his hand.  “Eat your own, Mister.”
“I’m not twenty-one,” Peter parroted.
“What is he doing?”
Steve jolted, his body pivoting hard on one heel.  There, just at the head of the stairs, Miss Potts stood, a large ledger cradled in one arm, her other hand trailing lightly over the newel post.  She smiled at Steve, her gleaming copper colored hair loose around her shoulders.  "I'm sorry," she said, her voice soft.  "I didn't mean to startle you."
“He’s not twenty-one,” Bruce said.
“No, sir.”
The gravel crunched behind him, and Steve sighed.  “Right.  You were stalling.”  Natasha held up a hand, her finger and thumb a bare inch apart, and he tried not to smile.  “Right.”
"Oh, God, does he have you fooled," Tony said.  He executed a complicated piece of footwork, not because it was necessary, or even a good match for the music, but just to stymie Rogers.  To his surprise, Rogers followed him this time, his own steps a bit off beat and a bit forced, but just as game.
Steve took a deep breath.  “In a heartbeat.”
“You asked.  I said yes.  DJ’s here.  Everyone else’ll understand, as long as we make it legal later, and they get to be there to make our lives hell.  But we’re here.  So.”  Tony stepped in, his chin coming up.  “Marry me.”
Maybe it was the gray, pale light filtering through the blinds.  Maybe it was the heavy, damp feel to the air, even here in his climate controlled bedroom.  Maybe it was just the almost inaudible sound of raindrops hitting the windows.
Steve set the basket on the table, glancing over at the stove.  A large stock pot was pushed to the rear of the range, a weight holding the lid in place.  “Why is there soup?” he asked.
Her hand paused.  Then it swept up his back again.  “I know.”  She straightened up, and Tony let her go.  “We’ll get them back.  Both of them.”
Steve blinked.  “Hi Tony Stark’s Phone,” he replied, a reluctant smile curving his mouth.  “Which sounds a lot like Tony Stark’s Assistant.  This is Tony Stark’s boyfriend.”
“Get rid of him,” the thug hissed, even as a big, broad figure of a man came stumbling out of the fog, a hat clamped on his head, his jacket sliding off his shoulder, one foot scraping behind him with each step, in an awkward, protracted limp.  A bottle swung wildly from his other hand, bumping against his side every time he moved forward.
“I love you,” she said.  Her teeth dug into her lower lip.  “I love you so much.”
Tony laughed, and Steve pried one eye open, blinking at him through the soap suds dripping down his face.  Tony wiped them away with the side of one finger, his thumb rubbing Steve’s cheekbone.  “Lean over here,” he said.
The slight build and the clothing, a pair of skin-tight jeans, battered doc martins, and an oversized hoodie, marked the figure as a teenager, as did the backpack slung tight over one shoulder.  Their head was tipped forward, their hands shoved into the pockets of the sweatshirt, hidden in the folds of the fabric.
“I think that's fair.”
He sank down to one knee, his elbow braced on his upthrust leg, his head bowing forward.  "For your service to this kingdom of New York, for your bravery in the face of overwhelming danger and your efforts to defeat the greatest threat our kingdom has ever known-"  He felt the gentle flick of the dowel against one shoulder, and the then other.  "I dub the Sir Rogers," Stark said, and there was something unexpected in his voice, something Steve didn't quite understand.  Steve glanced up, meeting his eyes, and Stark smiled.  "Arise, Sir Rogers, and greet your adoring public."
Tony stared across the room.  Peter was sitting on the edge of the table, his head tipped forward as Bruce ran gentle fingers along his face and neck.  He’d said almost nothing since he’d woken up.  He’d explained what had happened in a few short, halting sentences, then he’d lapsed into silence, his thin shoulders slumped, his arms tucked in close to his chest.  His aunt hovered nearby, her face expressionless, an ice pack at the ready.
Steve groaned.  “Tony.  I don't care about the state of your kitchen floor, and I'm not going to make it back to my place.”
Obie sank back into his chair, and Tony struggled to breathe.  “You had to make things difficult.”
Tony nodded.  He looked down into his coffee, the cup clasped between tense fingers.  He took a deep breath.  “You're everywhere,” he said, his voice strange to his own ears.  Still and strange.  “You're so deeply embedded in my life at this point, and I don't know how that happened.”  His lips twitched into something approaching a smile.  “I'm usually more careful than this.”
Steve ducked under a branch.  “I’ve been wrong about a lot of things, recently.”
Steve stared up at the ceiling, praying for patience.  “I can't dance.”
The last word was soft, sad.  There was no accusation to it, no anger, but still, it hit Tony like a physical punch, his chest aching.  Rogers stared at him, his blue eyes guileless.  “He's never been alone,” he said.  “And...”
Knowing a dismissal when he heard one, Steve pushed himself to his feet.  "Yes, sir."
“Understood, ma'am.”  He watched her go, her scarf fluttering in her wake, a faint smile on his face.  Next to him, Tony sank down into a chair at one of the tables, his fingers idly playing with the stem of a champagne flute.  Steve looked down at him.  “Tony?”  Tony looked up at him, and Steve tried to smile.  “Are you...  Okay with this?”
“Pardon me, I got five of them before you stopped talking, and you used to be better at distractions,” Natasha said, shaking out her hair.  She gave Steve a slow, considering look from under the sweep of her lashes.  He tried to steady his breathing, because that was easier than putting his thoughts in order.  Nat smiled at Steve, even if she was still talking to Happy.  “But you were tethered quite tightly to a wrecking ball, so I suppose you did the best you could.”
“Twenty-four, seven, baby,” Trip said, not even looking up from her copy of Rolling Stone.  “Though we do close early on Christmas Day and open late on New Year’s Day.”  She flicked the edges of the pages down, peeking over the top.  “You looking for a future booking?”
He raised his head, just far enough to aim a glare in the phone’s direction.  Maybe if he ignored it, it would go away.
Steve’s fingers brushed across the bandage, and the skin above, and Tony sucked in a breath.  Steve snatched his hand back.  “Sorry, I-”
“As much as I’d like to feign a business emergency, Pepper’s also on the guest list, and she will rat me out in a New York minute,” Tony said, easily keeping pace with Steve.  He smiled, tucking his hands in his back pockets. “Which I’m told is a shorter, and, in many ways, ruder minute.”
He’d expected that, but it still hurt to hear, a twist of a knife that he’d almost forgotten about.  Still, he managed a tight smile.  “I figured,” he said, closing out his holographic programs, one after another.  She waited patiently on the other side.  Tony tossed the files aside.  “No news is good news, I suppose.”
Greer blinked.  She wiggled free of the neck of her sweater.  “D’ you think so?” she asked, reaching up to twist her hair into a loose knot on the top of her head.  She picked up a pencil, twisting it through the locks.  “I’ve never bought a man flowers before.”
“Just the clean-up left,” Steve said.
Ellen yawned, holding the photo back out to her.  "Nice work.  Good.  You should submit it somewhere.”
“You really think so?”  Tony made a humming noise under his breath.  “I don’t know.  They seem to be keeping you out, just fine.”  He nodded at the board.  “Your turn.”
Nat gave the boy a curious look.  “Are you going to give me trouble?”
The staffer, his face flushed and his hair disordered, glared at him.  “I’m sorry, ma’am,” he said, and made a grab for the broom.  Harris jerked it up and out of reach.  “I’m really sorry, I’ve called security, we’ll have him removed right away-”
"You can't live in the bath tub," Steve told him.
Thor frowned at him.  “That would not work, not just any bird,” he said.  He sounded deeply disapproving.  “It is very important-”
“I’m certain he’ll let you know.” Jarvis smiled.  “Good night.”
“That just happened nearby,” Shawn said.  “Sure, we helped, but we weren’t really involved.  The explosion on the churro cart, though, that was-”
“God, I am predictable, aren't I?” Tony said, and Steve choked on a laugh.
“What the fuck-” The thug swung around, his head darting from one side to the other.  “Where the fuck did that come from, what is-”  Someone made a noise, like a choked off scream, and the thug spun back around, the club coming up.  “Who are you?”
“Should’ve thought of that before you moved in,” Tony said with a tight smile.  “That was a bad choice.”
Clint unleashed a barrage of terrible fake French that still managed to convey that he was reluctant to let Tony start disassemble anything in his kitchen and also that he was more than willing to start stabbing if Tony persisted with doing so.  Tony pointed at him.  “How dare you talk like that in front of an impressionable young man?” he asked.  He looked over his shoulder.  “DJ, cover Peter’s ears, he shouldn’t have to hear this.”
“Well, it's packed with food truck chefs, so...” Steve rolled his head on his neck.  “I've slept in quieter places.”
Steve nodded.  “She did a good job.  It looks great.”
“I’m not talking to you anymore, why are you even here?” Jan asked her.
“I wasn’t going to ask,” Harris told him, and Tony grinned.  “Did you tell anyone you were going out?  If you go missing-”
Pepper grinned at him.  “Switch partners!” she said, turning on her heel and heading straight into Rhodey's arms.  Laughing, he took her hands, letting her drag him into a dance.
Steve nodded.  “Grab me a beer on your way back?”
“‘Cause I’m bored a lot,” Bucky admitted.  Something was rattling in the background of the call, and Steve had a sneaking suspicion it was the door to his fridge.  “And fighting with idiots on the internet is a cheap and unlimited source of amusement.”
Steve froze, his stomach icing over in an instant. Tony smiled.  “That was the plan.  That’s why you told Pepper about him.  Because you were going to keep him, when I sent him back.”
Steve stepped down, keeping his boots out of the water.  “Not getting better?” he asked, his voice quiet.  Above them, the wind still stirred the branches, the faint, warbling call of a bird mixing with the rattle of the leaves.  Beyond that, there was just silence.
Steve nodded.  “Well, that’s fantastic,” he said, heading to the elevator.  “Now, when some reporter asks me when you told me you loved me, I get to say, ‘well, he was naked and wrapped in a blanket, and we were walking across a parking garage.’”
“There’s an emergency reset,” Rogers said, his voice quiet.  “If he gets too close to the ground, the armor reinitiates.”
And if he did, Officer Rogers absolutely wasn't it.
Jarvis drew himself up, his back going ramrod straight.  “Excuse me, sir,” he said, his British accent getting crisper with every word.  “In the last few years, I have not had much chance to look after a child.”  He paused, his mouth pursing.  “Other than yourself, of course.”
"Bruises, cuts, burns, got it," Tony said.  He swallowed.  "He's going to be okay."
“No.”
“I mean, that's why we're here, isn't it?” Pepper asked, her voice sweet.  “So you all write about the wonderful products we have to offer.”
“I'd say Whitman might object to that, but-”  Steve made a humming noise. “Actually?  Probably not.”
“Done,” Steve said, and he looked at the priest, giving him a smile and a nod.  The old man adjusted his glasses, nodding back.  Steve fished his phone out of his pocket.  “One second.”  He turned, grabbing Tony's arm to pull him in next to him. “Smile.”
“And yet you keep expecting him to do engineering work for you,” Steve said.  “And also clean up the workshop.”
“I’m going to take that as an ‘I love you,’” Tony said, pushing himself upright, groaning as his back protested the movement.  “And my spine hates me.”  Steve braced him with a hand on his back.
“That’s good, because I don’t know if I’ve ever been on one,” she said.
DJ nodded, and scrambled over to take Pepper's hand.  “You can read other books, too,” she said.  “There are a lot in here.  Enough to keep even a very good reader going for a while.”
“She knows he’s never going to use them, doesn’t she?” Steve asked.
DJ grinned.  “Always,” he said, and Steve laughed.
Danvers head tipped back, blinking up at him.  “Then why did you feed it?” she asked him with an easy smile.  “Besides.” She shrugged.  “You’ll need it to keep the mice at bay.”  She crossed her arms over her chest.  “If you need anything, Wilson can be trusted.”  Her lips kicked up in a wry smile.  “For the most part.”
“You did, you called Jess,” Jess said.
Tony nodded.  "Very close.  That was, that was a good attempt.  Sue, give me the smoothie, he can make another one once he's exposed himself to water."
Tony returned to his desk, only to find his chair occupied.  “Hello,” he said, and one of Furbro’s ears twitched, but he didn’t raise his head.  Tony scooped the cat up, and dropped into his seat with a distinct lack of grace.  “I can’t imagine what you mean,” he said.  Furbro padded in a circle on Tony’s lap then flopped over, draping himself over Tony’s knees.  Tony considered pushing him off, but the damn animal was purring already.  He scratched the cat behind the ear. “I can’t think of anything that’s more important to me right now than this conversation.”
“If it was you and me, we would’ve eloped,” Clint told her.
Tony, his hair a tangle and his cheeks flushed, leaned towards the camera, his eyes narrowed with suspicion.  “Is this thing on?” he asked.
“You think they’re going to kill you,” Steve said, bringing Nicholas’ attention back to him.  “And you think-” He twisted in his chair to look at T’Challa, who was sitting with his elbows on the table, his hands tented in front of his mouth.  “You all think they’re going to kill me, too.”
Steve caught his elbow, tugging him back around. “I love you,” he said, and Tony could swear his heart stopped beating. Steve grinned at him, wide and bright. “I love you, you make my life better, you make it easier, you-” He stopped, a flush sweeping up his cheeks. “You make me happy, and no matter how this works out, no matter what happens between us?” He smiled and it was beautiful, he was beautiful. “I'm always going to be grateful that when I asked you to marry me, you said yes.”
Steve glanced at him.  “I doubt I’ll be back, Jarvis.”  He reached for the pants, but Jarvis had already turned away.
“Or watch me rip the sleeves off of your dress after they get in my way,” Carol said.
“Thanks, but...  You could've told me not to bother making coffee,” Steve said.
“Why do you keep doing that?” he asked.
“Pickled beets?” he asked with a grin.
“If you fixed it right, I couldn’t break it,” she pointed out, and Tony’s head fell forward.
“Yes.”  He brushed a kiss against Tony's temple, letting his lips linger there for a second.  “This is the happiest I've ever been, actually.”  He let his eyes fall shut.  “Thank you.  For the dance.”
Ignoring that, Jarvis set the plate directly in front of him.  “Of course, sir.”
“Does he,” he said, the words slipping through frozen lips.  He tried to swallow, and his stomach turned over, a sick, hallow twist of nausea.  “I don’t-”
“No,” DJ said, and Steve laughed.
“Answers.”  Everyone looked at Jarvis.  “He’s looking for answers.  Despite the fact that he only knows half the questions he should be asking.”  His eyes were sharp, when he looked up.  “The shooter is one thing.  The person who hired him is another.  But beyond that, he wants…”
"You know, if we ever end up not being able to make ends meet, we could probably fund all of our super hero antics by starting a part-time moving company."
Steve wasn’t really sure why they were talking about Pepper, but he nodded anyway.  “She’s good at it.”
“Right,” Peter said between bouts of giggles.  “Excellent work.  That was-” He hiccuped.  “Again?”
Jarvis didn’t step back.  He just stood there, a faint smile on his face.  “No, sir.  I could not.” He reached out, tapping Tony in the middle of the chest with a single finger.  “And neither can you.”
“Get away from the windows,” Steve repeated, and he was four steps away now, three, two.  He didn’t stop and Tony refused to give way, his bare feet braced on the carpet.  Steve reached out, catching Tony’s arm.  “I gave you an order, Mr. Stark.”
“I give you a reason for wanting and needing the plane without having to explain that there’s one more Stark in the universe right now,” Clint said.  “I’ll keep Lewis from lighting anything valuable or irreplaceable on fire.”
“That, too.”
“Anything is worth fixing, if it can be fixed.”  Tony’s head tipped to the side, the line of his jaw sharp as he scowled down at the gears.  Mumbling under his breath, he began the process of disassembling the watch.  He huffed out a breath, holding a spring up to the light.  “Besides, it’s not the watch, it’s who gave it to you.”
“I know the rules.”  Clint ducked past him, and Steve fell into step with him.
"I oughta toss you into the street is what I oughta do," Steve told him.
“Your appreciation of the classics notwithstanding,” Jarvis said, because he was the only one who could’ve gotten away with sass at that exact moment, “we were merely waiting for you to finish your discussion so we could once again continue with our duties.”
But when the started down the aisle, Steve felt the last of the tension leaving him, dissipating like fog in the wind.  Outside, the chapel had seemed cheap, and run down, but on the inside, it was warm and cozy, light flowing in from high, arched windows.  The aisle lead up to the front of chapel, where Trip waited behind a lectern, and rows of white wood chairs flanked each side of the small room.  Clint and Tony were on one side, and Harris on the other, all of them looking back and smiling.
“Whatever I please,” Shuri said.   Her head came up, her lips twitching in a gamine smile as she looked from Okoye to Steve and back.  “So.  Shall we race?”
He pushed himself up, his arms shaking, and he stared down at the unfamiliar shirt he wearing.  It took him a couple of tries to read the writing, upside down as it appeared to him.  'New York Original: Made in Brooklyn.'
"Thank you, Miss..." His voice trailed off, and she gave him an amused look.
Steve glanced over his shoulder.  There was an awful lot of clothing tossed around the room.  “I always end up wearing the wrong clothes to these things, Sam.”  He shoved a pair of pants aside and took a seat on the edge of the bed.  “I’ve got a talent for it.”
“You are quite distracting,” Pepper admitted.  She looked over at Jarvis, even as she swept the last of the papers off of Tony’s desk.  “I’m done with him, Mr. Jarvis, you may take him away now.”
Tony glanced in his direction, and regretted it.  “You couldn’t even manage pants?” he asked, finding the bacon at last.  He plucked a perfectly crisp piece from the top of the pile, and waved it in Clint’s direction.  “I mean.  You couldn’t manage pants.”
“Seems like better living through technology,” Steve said, taking it.  “Isn't that your motto?”
Understanding dawned.  “He started bootlegging,” Steve said.
“Almost as if,” Bobbi agreed.  “But there’s no chance anyone would warn such dangerous people of a legitimate police action.”  She picked up her hat, rotating it between her hand.  “Sure, their tactics are brutal.  And innocent family members often get injured.  And whole ethnic enclaves have been the focus of raids with little proof that anyone there is involved in anything illegal, but…”  She smiled at Steve.  “The police know what they’re doing.  Don’t they?”
This was pathetic.  Tony let his head fall against Steve’s shoulder, hating himself for it, but too tired to lift it again.  “I can’t…”  His voice trailed away, and he let his eyes fall shut.  “What do you want?”
“Bite your non-existent tongue, Jay,” Tony said.  He wandered through the still, empty rooms of the penthouse, yawning as he slipped into the kitchen.  Jarvis was, as always, as good as his word, and the coffee pot was steaming away on the counter.
Obie shook his head.  “Tony, that’s just…  It’s not done.”
“Good, I can work with that,” Clint said, levering himself into a seated position, his back braced against the side of the tunnel.  He wiped blood and dust off of his arm, wincing as he found a long scrape just below the armline of his vest.  "Ugh, that's gonna hurt."
“The instructor was a man,” Sam said, and Steve cursed under his breath.  Sam gave him a distinctly amused look.  “Look.  You’re my friend.  You know that, right?  That I’m you’re friend, and I’m going to support whatever decision you make here.”
Steve smiled back.  “I was in the army,” he said, choosing a paring knife from the block.  “And wasn't always known for following orders, so...”  One shoulder rose in a shrug.  “Spent a lot of time peeling potatoes.”
Wanda gave her pasta sad look, but she stood, shaking out her skirts.  “Yes, ma’am.”
"I-"  He stopped, his mouth open, then subsided back into the chair.  “Okay, that's fair.”  He sipped his coffee.  He paused.  “Before or after Pepper?”
Rogers smiled.  “Always.”  His fingers stroked across Stark’s cheek, cradling his jaw in his palm. “I’m sorry I scared you.”
Tony struggled to swallow around the lump in his throat.  “So.  That's a 'no' on inviting me to your apartment?”
Steve stopped dead.  “What kind of a situation?”
Tony gritted his teeth.  “They can stay for a few days,” he said.  Obie’s mouth opened, and Tony reached for his water glass.  “Take the deal, Obie.  It’s better than the one you’ll get if you keep pushing this.”  His eyes met Obie’s.  “Do we understand each other?”
DJ nodded.  “The laws.  The laws governing magic use.  On this plane of existence.  All the magic users, anyone who can, who can independently work magic, they meet.  To figure out the laws,” he said.  He dragged one leg up wrapping his arms around it.  “If you abstain, or dissent, you are outside the laws.
Steve shifted his weight, his thumb still rubbing back and forth across the surface of the ring.  “Do you want me to?”
“That’s how we know that they are uncontrollable, Clint,” Phil said.  He reached for his pen.  “And every state you crossed and every building you set foot in and every magic user you looped into this conversation has resulted in another form for me to fill out or report that I need to file, so I’m going to repeat, do you really think that annoying me right now is your best plan?”
Tony looked at Peter.  "Cat," Peter agreed.  Tony didn't break eye contact, and one of Peter's shoulders rose in a half shrug.  "I'm...  Sure it's a cat."
“It IS,” DJ said, trying not to smile.
He could feel the pull, even as he set his foot on the first step, on the second, on the third.  The sound of his footsteps disappeared first, never reaching his ears, never escaping the pull of that darkness.  He ducked down, beneath the level of the floor, his eyes wide, trying desperately to see something beyond the reach of his hands.
He smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners.  "Just Jarvis will do, please, sir.  I don't mean to interrupt your meal, but I require your assistance, if you don't mind."
Steve tried to smile. “Hey,” he said, his hand falling back against his side.  “You okay?”
He paused.  His mouth opened.  Closed.  "Well, not HERE, precisely.  Cambridge."
“You and a large, large internet community,” Darcy said.
Clint gave him a wide, bright grin.  “Sexy Iron Hero!” He said, his hand moving slowly to another rack of costumes.  “Short skirt.  Big bow on the butt.  Heart shaped hole where the arc reactor should be.”  He traced a very large heart over the center of his chest.  “Boot covers included.”
Steve blinked, and realized that he was crying.  He shook his head, reaching up to swipe up his cheeks.  “I'm fine,” he said, with a slightly wobbly smile.  “I'm just fine.”
“You never know what'll help until you try it,” Val said.  Her fingers slid through her hair, separating the strands, then twisting them back together.  Apart.  Together.  It was comfortable, familiar, and DJ focused on the way the light slide over her hair, changing the texture with each movement.  “Trying stuff is scary.  But sometimes you have to do it, because if you don't, well, you'll never find something that works.”
“Oh, God, why?” she asked.
“You're both delusional,” Tony said, as Marcy fell in on his other side.  He glanced from one to the other.  “Is this a flanking maneuver?” he asked, suspicious.  “Are you attempting to outflank me?”
"Oh."  Steve shook his head.  "No.  He gave a statement, but it seemed-”
DJ plucked at the corner of a page, trying to turn it without pushing Furbro aside.  "No," he said.  He looked up at Steve.  "Ending?"
“Yeah, he's snoring,” Steve agreed, grinning at him.  “Lots of snores.”  He reached for the light.  “Do you feel better?  Is it okay if I turn off the light again?”  DJ nodded, and Steve turned it off.  “Okay, let's go back downstairs.”
“Are there drugs in here?” Tony yelled from the bedroom.  “Pepper.  Pep.  No, I-”
Thor held it up.  “A bit of you, so carefully woven.”  He slipped it over his hand, holding it up.  “A perfect fit.  Thank you, my small friend.”
“Yes,” Steve said and he could mean it this time, with all his heart.
He didn’t, but mostly he didn’t want Harris to get up.  “No.”  But he struggled to his feet anyway, clumsy and awkward.  “I’ll.   Water.”  He stopped, glancing up at Harris, and then away.  “Want?”
“Right,” Tony said.  He stepped past the armor, snagging the portable comm unit as he passed by.  “I'll be right back, this isn't-”  He tucked the comm into his ear.  “It's non functional, what else do you want from me, Coulson?”
Steve blinked at him.  “Thanks?”
He turned, and rage swept over him, hard and fast.
“I’m not spending the entire weekend in the backseat of a car,” Tony told him.  “I mean, I’ve done it before, but not a rental car.”
She paused, as if waiting for a reply.  “Right,” Ellen said.
“I absolutely do,” Tony said, because if he was going to go down, he was going to go down swinging.
Grinning to himself, Tony turned, looking towards the curb for the car.  A woman with a child holding onto each her hands walked in front of him, and he stepped back, out of her way.  She passed, barely glancing in his direction, and before Tony could move forward, a man stepped up, blocking his path.
Happy’s head snapped up.  “Drunk?” he sputtered.  “Who you calling a drunk, you-”  He tried to stand up, wobbled on his legs and fell right back against the wall with a thump.  “I’ve never been one t’ walk away from a fight.” He brought the bottle to his lips, draining what remained in a couple of hard, fast swallows and then wrenched it away with a belch.  He wiped the back of his hand across his mouth.  “Right.  Right.”  He looked around, swaying on his feet.  “Who’s first?”
"I think he's trouble.  Think I told you that already."  Clint heaved a bundle of linens into the cart.  "In fact, I'm certain I told you that already."
“I must’ve,” Steve agreed.  “Probably going to do it again.” He arched his eyebrows.  “If that’s really a deal breaker for you on this relationship.”
“He might not have been before.”  She crossed her arms over her chest.  “But he will be now.”
He wondered if Tony would give him some advice, because he suspected Cynthia was right.  Going public, in the way they had, had some consequences he'd never anticipated.  Back when he was that child's age, he'd gotten pretty good at figuring out who was safe, who was likely to leave him alone.  And who was like him.
“You're kidding.”  Bruce blinked up at them, his eyes wide behind the lenses of his glasses.  “What-”  His voice trailed away.  “Why?”
On the other end of the kitchen, Riri's head came up, her eyes going wide.  "Chef?"
Grinning, DJ braced his feet on Jarvis', and Jarvis started to shuffle, from side to side, then front to back, ignoring the way DJ's feet scuffed the immaculate polish of his black shoes.  "And...  One, two, three, one, two three, one, two, three!"
Tony didn’t bother with the lights, making his way to the grand hall by memory.  His footsteps echoed across the cavernous space as he sidestepped piles of boxes and past a rolled up rug.  It was a mess he didn’t want to deal with right now.
He seemed somehow small.  Or smaller than Steve thought of him as being.  Without the armor, or maybe more importantly, without the force of his brilliant, oversized personality, he seemed almost slight.  Fragile.  He fit in Steve's arms, and he shouldn't.  He was all heat, and energy, and fierce, sharp movement.
“Tony Stark,” Tony said, running his fingers through his hair.
And Tony was smiling at him, as if he could love Steve, too.  As if maybe he did.
Jarvis sighed.  “Efficiency should be the watchword in all of your efforts, Mr. Barton.”
Tony arched an eyebrow.  “Didn’t that shirt have sleeves when I gave it to you?”
“Excellent.”  Tony set the man down and crouched down to study the machine.  “Jarvis?  What're we looking at here?”
Each word was bitten off with precision, his teeth clicking against the consonants.  Tony sucked in a breath, and tasted copper and dust in his throat.  "I'm calm," he said.
With that, he went back to his phone.
Strange ducked, the box flying harmlessly past him.  He looked over his shoulder, where it had hit the wall, leaving a damp spot, and then back at DJ.  “What-”
"You don't have to do this," Steve said, and it wasn't enough.  It was never enough.
"Victor Aimsbridge-"
“I’m not saying we’ll actually go through with it, but there’s traffic and I’m bored,” Darcy said.  “DJ.  My man.  Heist?”
"You can thank me by letting me watch Clone Wars episodes," Clint said.
Steve’s hands slid up, his fingers brushing against the rough edge of Tony’s bandages.  He stilled, his eyes locked with Tony’s.  “Stay here,” he said, and Tony blinked, his face going blank.  “Promise me.  That’ll you’ll stay here in the house, where you’re safe, until we find out-”
There was a moment of silence, and then a soft sigh.  Steve looked over to find Jarvis smiling at him.  Steve exhaled.  “Sorry.  It’s got nothing to do with you.”  He turned his attention back to packing.  “And you’ve been nothing but nice to me.”
“I make no promises,” Tony said.  Once Bruce had slipped out of the room, pulling the door shut behind him, he looked back to Obie.  “I’m fine.”
Tony took a deep breath.  And another.  “Right,” he said at last.  “And the YouTube video?”
“Oh, will I?” Rhodes pushed himself forward, striding across the kitchen to collect the books that she held out to him.  He gave Steve a smile.  “I guess I will.”
Steve’s fingers tightened, his grip almost painful for a second. He took a deep breath and let it out, careful and even.  “I know.  Phil told me.”
Steve couldn't hold back a smile.  "Charming enough that I didn't kick your ass out into the hall," he admitted.
Steve hopped over a fence, looking back in time to see Bucky set his foot on the wood, propelling him up and over in two quick, sharp movements.  He crashed back to the ground, his boots hitting hard, and Steve shook his head.  “Do you remember if there’s actually a river here?”
Halfway up the kitchen stairs, Steve heard the front doorbell ring, and he wasn’t sure why, but he came to a stop, one hand braced on the bannister.  On his back, DJ shifted his weight, his fingers fisted on the fabric of Steve’s shirt.  A few steps behind them both on the stairs, Peter paused.  “Steve?”
T’Challa gave her a look, then turned back to Steve.  “Rumors have been swirling for a while,” he admitted.  “The War Dogs assigned here have…”  His mouth went flat and tight, his eyes going sharp.  “Concerns.”
“I know it’s beneath you, but my job serves an important purpose.”
"In a few weeks, we'll sit the two of you down with a carefully selected exclusive," Marcy said, her arms crossed over her chest.  Her head tipped to the side, and Steve had an uncomfortable feeling that he was being measured.  "With someone who doesn't have an agenda."
"Horrible, yes, wrong, no," Jan said.
Steve slipped out of bed, doing his best not to wake Tony on the way.  He spent a moment searching the dark floor of the room for his clothes, and coming up with only his shirt and a sock.  Another tap on the door, and he gave up, grabbing one of the robes hanging in the open closet instead.  He shrugged it on, heading for the door at the same time.
Nakia burst out laughing, even as T’Challa raised a hand in a ‘what have I done to deserve this?’ gesture.  “I might be interested!  What is your opening offer?” Nakia called back.  She cantored up to them, the men right behind her.
Tony's lips curled up.  “Mmm.” He shifted, his head burrowing a little deeper into his arms.  “Right.  Bed.”
The studio was quiet now, and he kept his seat by a force of will. "Let's let that 'last' already have passed us. Today. Yesterday. Last week. One more is too many, one more is something we should not bear." He looked at Morrison. "My goal, Mr. Morrison? So that we can all be proud to be here? To call ourselves Americans?
Stark’s eyes closed.  “What is it with the fucking world and-”  He stopped, his breath hissing audibly from between his teeth.  “Let’s be clear.  That was stupid.  What you did?  Was stupid.  It was pointless and dangerous and it was just as likely to get you killed as it was to help DJ.  You put your faith in Doctor Twinkletoes, and that?  That was really fucking stupid.”
“No, not like me, I am a grown adult with a government clearance and a driver’s license and a shiny blue check mark next to my Twitter profile,” Iron Man said.  “You, meanwhile, can’t even be depended upon to stay in the right dimension and you’re grounded for the next couple of eternities.  Understood?”
She gave him a sweet smile.  “Unlike you,” she said, with a toss of her head, “I don't have any secrets from anybody.  Except, of course, yours.”
“I’m just saying-” Tony’s lips brushed against his collarbone, and Steve realized his shirt was half open now and he wasn’t sure if Tony had done it or if he had, and he didn’t care either way.  His hands were under Tony’s shirt, and he was desperate in ways he’d never known before.  Tony lifted his head, just far enough to smile at him.  “Not every artist I’ve ever met has been open to the idea, but most have a healthy appreciation for-” His fingers slid down Steve’s breastbone, down, down, and Steve’s stomach muscles tensed under the caress.  “For the human form.”
Nebula opened her desk drawer. “I got half a bag of off brand Bugles,” she said, holding them up.  “Expiration date unknown.”
Steve stared at him, and Clint grinned.  “Three doors, three people.  Rhodes, Miss Potts, and Mr. Stark himself, all standing in one of them, all of them holding guns in what could only be called a professional manner.”
“We knew Stark had this much stamina,” Natasha said, running a cloth back and forth across the wood in a loose parody of polishing.  “But what were the odds that he’d find someone who could keep up with him?”
“Another day in paradise,” the man said with a quick smile.  “Have a good run, fellas!”
“Because she married my father and he brought her here.  She left the only home she’d ever known, she left her mother and her sisters and all of her friends, left her graceful, dignified old family manor to come here, where she didn’t know anyone but my father and everyone spoke a language that confused and frightened her.” Tony paused, his lips twitching into something like a smile.  “She left her home, left everything she knew, to come to New York.”
Bobbi turned around, leaning her hips back against the banister.  “What does he want?”
“Fuck you,” Tony said instead, with a wide, brilliant smile.
“Are you having a breakdown right now?” Darcy asked, her hands braced behind her on the bed.  Her legs swung idly through the air.  “Because this seems a bit like a breakdown.”
DJ smiled.  “Like you.”
Then Tony was taking the vase from him, long, strong fingers cradling the crystal, drawing it out of Steve’s hands.  “So no one on this team trusted Jess with the flower arrangements.”
