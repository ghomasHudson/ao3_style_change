Bruce grows hungry around noon, right after they’ve done a full body scan of Clint, and suggests they take a break for lunch. James hesitates to agree. He doesn’t outright say no, of course. He just looks unhappy and frustrated and opens and closes his mouth a few times wordlessly.
“I’m done with what I can do to help,” Steve says.  “Bucky’s got this rigged so you can see everything they’re doing.  Jump in if you want.”
Bruce feels like there’s significance in that explanation. Unfortunately, dealing with his own mangled emotions is decreasing his ability to concentrate on the problem at hand. There’s reason to believe James has better-than-average healing abilities. So if the knee got worse after the initial damage, something might be impairing that. Malnutrition. Exhaustion. Repeated use. James could have been in shock that day and numb to the pain initially. Or a hundred other possibilities, none of which could be easily ruled out in an Swiss barn.
this truck.”
“You got all that from talking to Barton?” Tony asks. He sounds confused. And rightly so.
“My boyfriend is really good at paper basketball,” Steve consoles, threading their fingers together and then pulling Tony’s hand up to his mouth so he can kiss his knuckles.
“What am I eating?” Steve asks.  His eyes water as he tries to force his gag reflex (his strong gag reflex, thank you) back under control.
Clint gives Bruce a look that manages to say ‘this fucking sucks” very eloquently with only his eyes.
They’ve been home a week now. They haven’t left the tower and they probably won’t for another few days, so it seems like as good a time as any to get the YouTube Outing over and done. Tony rolls out from under the car, and he’s got smudges of grease on his cheeks and something else goopy on his forehead. The look Tony gives Steve is equal parts amused and surprised.
At least there’s hope now that sometime in the future, things might not be so lonely around here.
“I’m not mad,” Bruce says easily, as the reading begin to fill in above the little baton.  “I trust you to make those kinds of calls. It wouldn’t be fair for me to blame you for doing the thing I had hoped you’d do.”
He doesn’t clarify if that’s a good or bad thing. James can figure that out for himself.
Steve’s stormy expression is more than enough to shut him up.
“I’m more than a little mad,” Steve admits.  “Not at Buck but at whoever James is.  Whoever he
“I’m supposed to go back over to Tony’s tomorrow,” Steve admits.
“This talking thing is hard but I like it a lot better than when everything I do makes you want to yell at me,” Steve says.
“Is that a problem?” Steve asks Tony.
“Don’t suppose Tony’s mentioned anything about James to you?” Clint asks, before James can respond. There’s something off in his tone. He's worried. “Cause this is a little more complicated than you know.”
” Tony sighs. “They better be magic.”
There’s a beat of silence.  “I didn’t know I was doing it,”  Tony admits.
“That part was improvised,” Steve admits, ducking his head in embarrassment.
Bruce takes the seat closest to the door. Steve slowly moves to sit in the chair next to the bed.
James shakes his head.  “Want you to stay.”
Clint nods.  “I always do.”
“Is that why you’re here?” Steve asks.  “Cheeseburgers?”
“I was just about to tell James my thoughts on one of his malfunctions,” Bruce says. “And honestly, your perspective might be helpful. I... um... I’m not an expert on this. On any of it.”
An off-handed ‘good for you’ is not at all what Steve intends to say, but it’s habit now.  People make so many assumptions about his moral standards, it’s the easiest way to help them understand he doesn’t give two shits about what they get up to in their free time.
“...Yeah, everything’s... hello,” Bruce’s voice comes through the phone.  He sounds concerned, but not unhappy.  “Everyone’s okay here. We’re just okay out on the porch. Being okay...”
“So wait. You knew right away?” Steve asks.
“No. Because my pansexual awesomeness ends right at you.”
“I think in another day or two your knee won’t be giving you any more trouble,” Bruce says. “You’ll probably want to consider waiting a week before you jump off any roofs, but walking around should be fine. I still want JARVIS to double-check me if that’s okay?” Bruce asks.
Pepper looks a little surprised by that.  “He’s had a bad week.  People think those interviews don’t get to him...
“It’s an essay,” Tony says.
4 Eggs Down - 3 To Go
“You know I love milkshakes,” Steve says.  “I do.  But this is
“Nope. See you in a few hours. You hang tight until then. Stay right where you are, promise me?”
A wave of nausea hits Tony and he sucks in a breath of air.  His eyes fly open and he looks straight at the sun to dislodge the images.  He’s confident he’s gonna see them again in a nightmare soon enough.
Tony’s unsure. He’s not great with morning afters, especially when it involves blacking out. Steve might want him gone.
“You’ve pissed off enough people that consequences are a given,” Steve says.   He thinks of the close friendship Bruce and Tony had enjoyed before all this, and how hard that’s going to be to earn back.  “I don’t see why I should add to your misery.”
Steve can feel how guilty he must look as he shrugs.
Howard scoffs. “Then you’re right. I raised a loser.”
James codes twice, and the monitors scream and flash angry red as James
The house is empty.  The house is
“Be honest with me,” Steve implores.  “How bad is it?”
“Mr. Stark, it’s fine,” Steve says gently.
“Bucky Barnes is dead. I’m what they stuffed in his corpse.”
Steve, who'd picked the right quilt all on his own.
Steve sounds helpless and pathetic and sorry and Tony’s anger cracks a little at the edges.
“ICER?” Bruce asks.
“I take that for the compliment it is,” Natasha says.
“I want to put your wrist in a splint. If you’ll keep it in a sling the swelling will go down more quickly and then you can either get help from a real doctor or I’ll fix you up.”
“We’re multi-talented,” Natasha shrugs.
The soldier’s eyes bore into Bruce. Bruce takes a deep, stilling breath, and lets it out on a four count. The Other Guy is definitely not a fan of the soldier’s sharp gaze.
“Fries, NOOOOOOO!” Clint cries out, with an overly dramatic fist shake toward the ceiling.
“Son of a bitch,” Tony grumbles.  “That’s gold.”
Louboutins and I’m only just now finding that out?”
dogs, or cops who
“Barnes,” Bruce sighs. “He had his glove on a puck that got smacked free. Somehow took Barnes’s glove with it, and someone got tripped up. Skated over Barnes’s palm and nearly cut him clean through.”
“You’re not going to eat that?” Tony asks.
“I’ve waited to do this for so long,” Steve breathes out.
“Pick that up and follow me.”
“I’m guessing the answer he’s looking for isn’t ‘uncomfortable’,” Tony says carefully.  “If it hurts like a bitch, then tell him that.”
I regret nothing.
“This is great,” Bucky says. “Tony Stark wants my autograph.”
“I’ve got a visual on Barton,” Tony says, through the comm. “Get Romanov out of there. I’ll meet you at the hospital. SHIELD’s 2 minutes out. They’ll clean up the mess.”
“Correction. I’ve been sober for… 6 days,” Tony says. “It was a year before that. And I’m not going.”
“Maybe,” Steve says. “I just-- I think there are some things you might be into that are absolute nos for me. Like... I’m not going to hurt you. I’m never going to leave bruises on you. I’m never going to put you in danger. You are precious to me. I won't treat you like you're anything less.”
“JARVIS, you getting what we need?”
That seems to catch Steve by surprise. “Me and Buck and Clint stay late some nights after practice,” Steve explains. “We goof off. Act like idiots. Reminds me of all the pick-up games I played as a kid.”
Bruce flinches at the honesty. James’s face is a mask of scary calm.
“Together?” Steve asks.
This time there’s Clint.
“Correlation doesn’t imply causation,” Steve quotes.  He’s heard Bruce say it enough times to know it can win a lot of arguments with Tony.
“I think James would disagree with you on that.”
Tony knew she meant the Tupperware bowl (Rhodey had warned him long ago his mother took Tupperware seriously) but a few weeks later he had packaged up the bowl and the quilt together and had them sent back to Mrs. Rhodes.
“It’s not important,” Tony says.  “Sorry I bothered you.”
“Steve--” Tony says it more firmly this time.
In the forties, Steve had been promised a future without hunger.  Without war.  A city on the moon.  Flying cars.
“I like to live dangerously,” Clint says with a bright smile.  “So yeah-- sign me up for being your friend, too.  If you wouldn’t mind.”
“And you don’t sleep, apparently.  Want any company?” Steve asks.
“Ordinary?” Clint asks.
Steve returns with a duffel bag slung over his shoulder and a gun in his hand.
“Am I wrong?” Steve asks.
“That’s the spirit,” Steve says.  He hops off the table spryly and opens the door for Tony.   As soon as they’re inside, he takes the lead again.  Tony’s got a clear path all the way back to his seat.
Steve moves on and Tony follows.  When they reach the second floor, Steve hesitates for a moment before he opens the first door to his left.
“Are they ceramic?” Bucky asks.  “Because Hammertech may be behind in the weapons market but their security is a-okay.  Looks like Stane’s been hired as the head of it, and every access point to the farm has got a hair-trigger metal-detecting grid on it.”
“National treasure, my ass,” Tony grumbles.  “There’s no way whoever dubbed you that had ever met you.  Come on.  Tell me I’m right.”
“I do!” Kate says, as she arrives for the morning. “Who are we watching?”
“Nothing,” Steve says.  “Or something, I guess.  It’s a code she and Barton use.  She didn’t tell me what it means.”
The topic changes after that. They both have more than enough to think about, and it’s easier to move on to less touchy subjects. Steve tells Tony about how he’s been going to the tower at least once a day to air things out, and talk to Jarvis, and visit Tony’s bots.
When the jet lands and Natasha and Sam stroll out the back, they both look surprised to see Tony.
Tony feigns insult.  “Original Italian.  Do you think I went to a state school or something?”
It’s the one excuse Tony can’t argue with. Rhodey doesn’t get to see his daughter enough as it. He really isn’t going to try and get in the way of that.
“I’m not gonna cry cause you say his name,” James cuts him off in a drawl, before limping over to the couch and plopping himself down.
“Stop,” James groans. “Too many words.”
“Great talk, doc,” Tony says, giving Bruce a false smile. “Talk to me after we’ve won the Cup and I’ll think about it. For now I’ve got to go.”
Steve is blown away.  Obviously, he had no idea that his reluctance to accept gifts from Tony was contributing to this sense of unworthiness.  And if it will help, even a little, he’ll let go of his stubborn pride.
“He got it exactly right,” Bruce says quietly. “I wouldn’t have forgiven him for less.”
James’s eyes flick back to the people on the porch who are now watching them interact.
“I have excellent lawyers,” Tony agrees.
“What was that?” Tony asks, making eye contact with Steve for the first time since the table.  His voice is off-key to his own ears.  It was meant to sound light-hearted but instead it reveals so much of what he wants to hide.  The confusion.  The unworthiness.
“But it’s a start,” Steve agrees.  “You want to-- I don’t know.  Watch some TV or eat or something? If you’re not busy.  If you’re busy, it’s fine--  I can make myself scarce.”
“And I want you to only buy me things because it makes you happy.  Not ever to apologize.  When you apologize, I want you to use words.  I don’t want to be bought off.”
“Yes,” he says emphatically. “I met Steve Rogers and then I malfunctioned.”
“You don’t need the chair,” Bruce agrees as he starts to ease his fingers from his vice grip on the kitchen table.  Hulk shape disaster averted for now.
Whatever Tony has set up, the look of enthusiasm in his eyes means Bruce is going to want to headdesk repeatedly when he sees it. Still, it is undeniably awesome that he has a friend. And that that friend is Tony Freaking Stark.
“I thought I saw him die. I should have jumped off the train after him when he fell. Followed him down the mountain. Every day I’m so damn sorry that I didn’t.”
“It’s Bruce.”
Tony starts doing interviews with anyone who will have him on their show or put them on the front page of their newspaper.  He reveals things he ought to keep quiet.  About all of them.  No one, not even Bruce, is spared.  Tony’s words are brutal.  He’s got a knack for knowing exactly what to say that will cause the maximum amount of emotional damage while skirting the edge of anything classified.
“Ten,” Tony says.
“Clint could use the win,” Bucky says, waving him off.  “Take it punk.”
“We all know what you’d do for a million dollars,” Natasha says, nudging Clint. “We’re talking about Steve, and Steve doesn’t want the money.”
That’s an oversimplification, but Tony can’t bring himself to give more details yet.  Tony needs context before he goes and ruins Steve’s happiness again.
“You knew there was a way around the rules?” Tony asks.
“Crueeeeel,” Tony complains, though he’s laughing because Steve’s making nerd jokes and that more than anything makes him turn in Steve’s arms and look at him.  Really look at him.  “You’ve really been practicing that whole speech?”
“Pining?” Tony asks, perking up.
Steve holds the glass of water to Tony’s mouth and waits for him to take a sip.
“Hey, James,” Steve says carefully. “Nice to finally meet you in person.”
An ending.
Everyone is finally in the same house!
There are clean towels stacked on a shelf and he grabs one to place down next to the tub so it will be easy for Tony to reach.  Steve spots a razor and pockets it.  It doesn’t seem like a good idea to leave Tony alone with one just yet.
Then Steve switched to staring at something else and eventually Tony needed to know.  If he knew, he could help.  So he’d looked again, felt physically ill after reading one paragraph about Barnes’s extracurricular HYDRA uses and sworn off spying yet again.
Howard. The two of them got along like a house on fire. The snark never stopped. And we never met your mom. I don’t-- don’t have any answers. I wish I did.”
“Can we lose our shirts?” Steve asks.
Tony looks like he’s going to say something biting, then leans back hard against the wall and covers his face with his hands.  “So do I.”
“It’s not always about getting drunk,” Tony says.  “I just thought-- nevermind.”
Tony narrows his eyes at him.   “I just want to know why you’re doing this so I can stop thinking about it, okay?  I don’t like not knowing things.”
“Too bad Stark went batshit,” Rumlow says.  “He was an asshole but his airspeed was useful.”
“Lies,” Tony says.  “False accusations.”
THUD.
“Okay,” Steve starts. He takes a slow breath. “After I’ve been injured, it hurts like hell.”
“I understand,” Steve says.  “It seems like just about everyone wants a piece of him this week.”
“Get a room!” Sam teases as he walks up to join them.
He works for several minutes before Tony’s eyes close.  His breathing slows.  He’s still upright so he must be awake, but it’s as calm as Steve has ever seen him.  Tony slits open one eye when Steve switches from the left hand to the write, but that’s all the reaction he gets from him apart from relaxation.  It’s nice.  Steve could happily continue long past where it might get weird.
“I malfunctioned,” James says. “At the knee. Now it’s healing stupid and Bruce thinks you might know why.”
Tony leans back to take an overly obvious look at Steve’s ass and then nods.
“Bruce, just stay there for a sec,” Clint groans as he lifts himself up off the ground. He’s cradling his arm against his chest. “You got this?”
“That Bucky Barnes was alive for one? I mean we could start there but probably-- the part with my parents. That’s-- that’s the part--” Tony snaps his mouth shut. Not because he doesn’t have more words but because words fail him. What are words when the world is closing in around you? What’s... what’s anything... when your lungs burn and your peripheral vision blurs and--
“Not a chance.”
At least he’s being honest.  Steve knows he should do the same.  Stop being such chicken shit.  Own his feelings.
“Seriously.  It was a dumb game anyway,” Bruce consoles.  “Why don’t you clean up the mess and we don’t even need to tell Tony how it happened?  I’ll say I bumped my egg myself.”
“Because you’d stab me with it,” Bruce says.
who is legit one of the nicest, sweetest, kindest, most generous Stony artists out there.  If you don't follow her you absolutely should!  And as always, you can find me at
“So that's me on top then,” Tony declares.
“I would have been a dick about it,” Tony admits. “I was relieved when I saw Jarvis’s activity log. I was embarrassed but relieved.”
“You know you’re going to tell us,” Steve sighs.  “One hundred points if you can keep it secret for one whole minute.”
Bucky follows after Clint, which leaves a spot for Tony in a chair on the end, squeezed between Bucky and Steve.
The woman who opens the door isn’t at all what Tony’s expecting.  It’d been easy to picture the woman who’d raised Bucky Barnes as someone formidable.  This woman is barely 5 foot tall.  Her white curls are pulled back into a soft bun, and the look of pure joy on her face at the sight of Bucky, Steve and Clint catches Tony by surprise.
Steve stops and looks down at the floor.  When he looks up his eyes have softened slightly.  His tone is less irritated.
Tony shakes his head. “I love unprofessional. The lesson here is do not fuck with my boyfriend.”
“I feel like that’s an insult to my ass,” Tony says.  “My ass is insulted.”
Clint beams at Steve over his food.  “Best. Lunch. Ever.”
“Fine,” Clint says as he finishes lacing on his skates. “You can be Captain.”
Steve unscrews the top and takes a long swig of it.
“I believe I have found them, then.  I am displaying them on the television now.”
“You said shit,” Tony says.  “I want my twenty points.”
Once Steve is wearing jeans it feels like a waste to stay miserably flopped on his bed so he goes out to wander the penthouse, which is really mostly an excuse to find Tony.
Which settles it. Steve stays. The guest room is huge and the bed is comfortable and Steve sleeps better than he has in weeks.
“Better get inside then, darlings,” she says, moving so they can enter.
The same smile Bucky's always using to get his way.  It melts Bucky's resolve like a hot knife through butter.
“Loud and clear,” Tony says, his image replacing the cartoon cat and mouse. “I’ve already got Jarvis sorting out what I’ll need for a lab, Pepper is clearing my schedule and Steve ran up to his room for his duffel bag the second Barnes said we could visit. You’ll see us in under an hour. Good work, Banner. Way to save a life.”
“I want it cut,” James says.
“The bazooka?” Steve guesses.
“You finally brought me home someone worth meeting,” Nanna announces to Steve.
“You said you wanted updates if I heard from anyone,” Tony answers quietly.  “Bruce just texted.  Wanted a place to stay in Switzerland.  That’s all.”
Steve gives a slight shake of his head.  “Remember how I said I spend a lot of time looking at pictures and videos of you?  For work.  As part of my job,” he clarifies.
Steve lets Tony go first, keeping his eyes on the alley, until Tony is safely down. Then Steve joins him. They wait beside a dumpster, well out of sight.
“He did,” Tony agrees.  "Parlez-vous francais?"
He hadn’t played Tony’s team in those two weeks between the news breaking and Steve’s suspension from his team, but Tony has a reputation for being an asshole. best case scenario is that they manage to ignore each other all night. He’s really not in the mood to take any shit from anyone and after punching Rumlow, Steve isn’t going to make it back on the team this season if he gets into it with Stark.
Pepper is too, but Pep has been keeping her distance, so JARVIS is the better option.
“He does,” James says, eyeing the house like it might eat them.
Tony and Steve use the service elevator to get to the garage, and take Steve’s bike out through the back way to avoid being seen. The YouTube video has swung public opinion in their favor, and the downside to that is that everyone and their grandma wants a picture of them. Maybe especially the grandmas.
If Natasha notices the gentle shoulder squeeze Steve gives Tony as he walks away, she has the good grace not to mention it.
Probably that weapon cache Bucky’d mentioned.
Natasha and Clint flip over their placemats and they’re off.  Bruce and Steve talk about a new stroganoff recipe and about a science documentary they’ve been watching on Sunday nights until the food shows up.
“Rogers said he didn’t want to hurt me,” James says, after Bruce’s words sit in the air for a while.  “People have said that before.”
“S’good,” Tony says.  “Where’s Steve?”
He’s defeated. He’d just played one of the best games of his life and he can’t enjoy the victory. Which is why he, Sam, Clint and Bucky are all piled onto his hotel bed, which is filled with every snack Bucky and Clint could snag from the vending machine down the hall.
“In New York could I get shirts that fit?” James asks.
Iron Man stiffens. That clearly wasn’t what he expected to hear. “Glad you got that off your chest, Cap?”
“Give me a minute,” James says before he even opens his eyes. When James does open them, he turns his head to the side to look at Bruce. “Not-- functional? I can’t feel my-- anything.”
Steve realizes too late that being compared to Bucky is probably the last thing Tony wants.
Steve leans in and presses his lips to Tony’s.  He lingers there, moving his other hand to the small of Tony’s back and Tony is more than happy to go along with this plan.  He deepens the kiss and tugs at Steve’s shirt until they’re pressed flush against each other and Tony can close his eyes and lose himself in the oh god yes of their first kiss.
“You’re such a shit,” Steve teases.
The only thing keeping Steve from punching this guy is the knowledge that he’s too angry to do it without killing him.
“So talk,” Tony says.
“Why don’t you check then, Wilt Chamberlain?”
“If James is up for it, I’d like to give him some more of the IV nutrition first,” Bruce says. “Then I’ll go collapse somewhere.”
“Smelled the bacon?” Steve asks.
He wonders if Steve had gotten to the point where memories of Bucky no longer hurt him, before all this shit got stirred up. If Steve had thought fondly of his friend when he remembered their times together. And how awful it must feel to have Bucky’s body back with someone new inside. Someone who wants nothing to do with Steve.
It’s Sunday, and today it’s Tony’s turn to read their homework assignment out loud.  Considering Tony’s reaction, Steve braces himself for a doozy.  He reaches for the paper and takes it carefully out of Tony’s shaking hands.
“Maybe someday soon you’ll be able to ask him,” Tony says.  “You never know.”
“Will you please just suffocate me and put me out of my misery?” Tony asks.
“I do,” Bruce agrees. “He’s got a lot of personality. I wasn’t expecting that.”
“I need to ask for some medical equipment to get a better look at your knee and Tony’s my best friend... I’d like to tell him who I’m with. I know he has a reputation for... well, being Tony, but if I ask him to give us space, he will. I trust him to keep you quiet. I was fine with him not knowing who I was with before but now that Steve and Natasha know it isn’t just a secret. It’s a
“When I found out Tony Stark was headed our way... a big part of me wanted to curl up in a hole and die.  I’ve faced scorn from the scientific community for years.  I’m a persona non grata-- totally unwanted.  At best I’m a cautionary tale and at worst I’m a monster.  I fully expected Tony to treat me like shit.  I really did.”
“I’m not worried about it,” Clint says. “You could come at me with a rusty knife made out of a Pepsi can, doc. I’m going to trust you know what you’re doing.”
“JARVIS?”
The waitress walks away and Tony expects to part ways as Steve pulls on his coat.
It starts ascending a lot more quickly than before.  When it stops, it’s at roof level.  Tony is leaning casually against a new model quinjet.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says.
Tony shifts away from Steve to make room for Bruce to sit between them.  Bruce only hesitates for a second before he joins them on the couch and the grateful look in this eyes over this small kindness is almost more than Steve can take.  He leans in a little against Bruce’s side, and he can see that Tony’s doing the same.  They can’t be there for Clint and Natasha just yet, but they can take care of Bruce.
“Not happening,” Tony says simply.  “We’re not splitting up.”
“It’s Hockey for the Heart. How bad can it be?”
“That’s not a no,” Steve smirks.
That sure sounds ominous.  The crowd of photographers in front of the tower aren’t a good sign either.  Steve pulls around back, up into the delivery bay, and leaves his bike there before he steps into the private elevator.
Tony nods.  They both climb out and Steve pops open the trunk to retrieve Tony’s duffel bag, shouldering it easily.  There’s a desk, with an older woman behind it.  She has the eyes of someone who has seen it all and she smiles at them in greeting.
Tony debates the merits of sitting on Bruce's desk and waiting, but the office has interior windows and employees are glancing in, and fuck it, seriously.  He steps out the door and lets his eyes sweep over the large, cubicle-filled room.  There are less than a dozen people at their desks.
He wiggles against Steve, who rolls off of him with a groan.
It’s not about him.  It’s not.  He doesn’t even want it to be.  He just wants… he wants…
“Make it so I can hear the call.”
“That,” Steve says. “I want a lot more of that.”
James’s eyes close and almost immediately the readings on the monitor calm.
And God does he flaunt it for the next minute and a half.  Steve’s showered with plenty of guys-- that’s part of Army life.  He has never showered with anyone so intent on
Clint nods.  “Sure.  But can we make our sex tape after?  Cause I’ve already got a name and everything.”
Tony’s eyes tingle with tears he refuses to let fall.  No one has ever defended him like this before.  Rhodey and Pepper have come close, but what Steve’s doing is unprecedented and Tony has no idea what to do with his stirred up emotions.
“That’s not a code,” Tony says.  “It was in the security files she dumped on the net.  Bogotá, Columbia.  It’s where Hawkeye found her when he convinced her to let him bring her in.  Broke every policy and procedure in the handbook to do it.”
“I’m coming to the tower,” Steve says. “I’m already in New York. I’ll be there in ten.”
“That’s such a stupid name,” the soldier says.
“Thank you,” Steve says appreciatively.  “I want to talk to Clint and Natasha, too.  I think they’ll understand, but if they don’t, I don’t want them blaming you.  This isn’t about me trying to get him back on the team.  I just want him to have his milkshake.  That’s all.”
James nods and then slowly, with effort, relaxes more fully into the stretcher and stares straight up at the tree. “I’ll go in the house. Clint can be close. They-- they should stay out of reach.”
“You’re going to leave it?” Steve asks. “I thought... I mean I figured you wouldn’t. You don’t have to.”
He’s Captain America.  Isn’t that what Captain America’s supposed to say?  ‘Hey kids.  Don’t be wasteful.  Stay in school.  Check to make sure your friend is really dead if they fall to the bottom of a canyon.’  Helpful shit like that.
“What?” Tony asks.  He really doesn’t see it that way.
Steve shakes his head. “It doesn’t bother me. I know I’m good and I know Bucky is better. People expect me to be jealous but it’s never bothered me.”
Steve leans in and plants a kiss on his cheek. “I know that’s a lie.”
"Gladly," JARVIS says.
“We’re going for the Fourth of July,” Bruce confirms.  “With considerably more dirt, gravel and bang.”
Bruce glances toward the front, and Clint and Nat are in the pilot’s seats.  It’s good to see Clint up and moving, even if he’s sweaty and pale.
“Bucky was the best friend I ever had,” Steve defends.  “I don’t know how that connects to you-- to his body. But I can’t fight you without fighting him. That’s what I know. Also, since we’re already yelling, you sound exactly like his ma.  And mine.  So you aren’t him, but I guess
“Help me,” Tony says.  “We need all of this.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I am happy to assist, Captain Rogers,” Jarvis says.  “If you have needs of this nature in the future, I have taken the liberty of programming my direct contact information into your phone.  I have also sent you the name and address of the man who abused Sir in the video.  I anticipate it will be useful to you should the tape appear elsewhere.  Perhaps even if not.”
Steve’s just pressed the button to switch the phone to speaker when James’s voice comes through the line.
“You don’t have to lie to get in my pants,” Tony mumbles.  “I’m a sure thing.”
“On the helicarrier,” James says. “It lost additional functionality in the days after.”
“Breakfast. Eat.”
“You’re trolling me,” Tony insists, turning carefully on his heel toward the elevator.  “I am being trolled by the star-spangled man with a plan.  In my own bedroom.  J, order us some pizza?”
He’s not hearing any of it from Tony because Tony won’t return his calls.
Tony leans in and kisses his neck.  “There was a lot of singing,” he whispers.
“Maybe try a drink of water?” Bruce directs to Clint. He’s definitely not going to trust his own legs to stand and move just yet.
He lifts his hand one more time and knocks. The wait is awful.
“This is why you’re my favorite,” Clint replies, with a wink.
“Shit,” Bruce swears, just as Dum-E lets out a string of panicked, plaintive beeps.  “It’s okay, Dum-E, accidents happen.”
“He doesn’t think he deserves any better,” Pepper says.
“Affirmative.  Coming down now,” Clint agrees. “See you in a few.”
“Earth to Captain Rogers,” Rumlow tones, in his best NASA impression.  “You with me, Rogers?”
“I don’t need to see,” Steve says.  “I don’t think you’d cheat on me.  And I know if you did, you damn sure wouldn’t lie about it.  If you say it didn’t happen, it didn’t happen.  End of story.”
“I love him like a brother,” Rhodey interjects.  “I’ve spent more than half my life cleaning up after that man’s messes.  Might as well call me Mop Man.”
What Steve’s supposed to do with this much hurt and heartbreak, he’s not sure.  He can go to his room.  Close his door.  Stare at the ceiling. Take off running somewhere, or wander aimlessly around New York.  It doesn’t really seem to matter.
“I believe you.”
It helps his control immeasurably that Bruce has already gotten some of the story from Tony (who had gotten it from Steve) so Bruce knows the Winter Soldier isn’t necessarily on team HYDRA anymore. Everything is okay for now. They’re far enough from civilization that this might not even get ugly.
Bruce can feel tears stinging at the edges of his eyes and he is
“No,” Bruce says, with a soft smile and a shake of his head.  “No, Tony treated me like I was-- like I was brilliant and valuable and human.  I can’t-- can’t really--”
Damn biology.
He likes it so much that they watch five episodes straight and the sixth is about to begin before Steve looks over and realizes Tony’s fallen asleep.
not like it now.”
They skate again after their chat. More slowly and without all the playful checking from before. It’s comfortable. And it’s late. Steve only realizes it when he yawns.
“Have a HoHo,” Clint prods. “You’ll feel better if you eat something.”
“Wouldn’t end things without a reason,” Tony said quietly.  “I lied.  To her.  To everyone.  I did take a woman back to my room.  We drank.  We talked.  But I didn’t cheat.  No matter how drunk I was I couldn’t.”
“Four hours, give or take an hour,” Natasha says from the cockpit.
“Who couldn’t?” Steve asks.
“On self-discovery?  No.  No, I think it’d be good for you.  Even outside all the incredible fantasies I can cook up.  You should do this.  Look into art school.  Or work with one of my foundations.  Start your own foundation.  Find what makes you happy.”
Dum-E is elated to be given the job of cameraman. He drops the camera twice within the first minute of taping, and the outtakes from that are going to be hilarious. Steve doesn’t get more than a dozen words out before they have to start again. Tony’s face as he scolds Dum-E is priceless.
“Where have you been hiding Natasha?  I could have had a
There’s nothing new about that, Steve thinks grimly.
Nanna seems to sense Tony’s discomfort, because she drops the subject.  She hands him a holster belt, and he puts it on before sliding the gun in securely.  He tugs his shirt back down and it’s hidden.
Steve shrugs playfully.  “I’d heard of it.”
He knows malnutrition when he sees it. He sees other things too-- tattered clothing, favoring of the left leg, dark shadows under the eyes, shallow breathing, rib retractions-- those aren’t as easily solved as hunger.
“That’s fine,” Steve agrees.  “I’m not going to push you into something you don’t want.”
Natasha takes the next right.  “I thought you might want to be in the neighborhood.  We’re three minutes out.”
“You said--”
“Cheerful,” Steve muses.  “You want to stick around for a bit? Tony suggested I spend some more time on the plan for what we’re going to do with Bucky once we get him here.  I know we’ve discussed it at a high level but the actual details...”
Unfortunately, Steve’s too smart for the deflection.
Heard about Barnes. Anything I can do? (Seen 11:49 PM)
“Nothing.  Just... I’ve got a crossbow,” she adds.  “And I’m good with it.  I want to keep you safe.”
Steve chews on his bottom lip. “It’s a good feeling knowing you’ve got my back.”
Steve takes a few seconds to meet Tony’s eyes. “I was hoping maybe you would be a friend. And don’t worry. I won’t say a word. Not to anyone.”
They get to the rental car without incident.  Steve rented one with dark windows, so no one can see in as he pulls out of the garage and down the street.  The reporters are all out front anyway, waiting for the Tony Stark circus to begin anew.  They ignore the plain green sedan that cruises by.
“You should call him Bruce,” Tony says.  “And go talk to him next time you see him.  He’s a good guy.  He could use some friends.”
There’s a breathiness to his voice and Tony all but runs from the room.  Steve looks up at the ceiling, silently wondering if JARVIS has any input but he’s met with silence.  Steve turns his eyes back to the television, puzzling out what sent Tony running.  The picture is equal in skill to Natasha’s.  Iron Man is front and center, done in gold and red, with his name below.  He’s painted against an ornate circle of clouds that ring a black and silver night sky.  It’s gorgeous from an artist’s point of view.
Tony shakes his head.  “I try not to do that.  I get it all the time, you know?  People read about me and they think they know me.  They make assumptions.  I guess I just wanted to... start fresh.”
“I’ve got a security team for this kind of thing,” Tony reminds them. “I know you know that, because you work for them.” He’s still a little on edge because of the way everyone in the room is looking at him and his headache is back in full force. “People have been trying to kidnap or kill me since the day I was born. We’re prepared.”
!" Steve explodes. Like he's been holding it in for days and Tony's finally given him a convenient place to shout.
Which is more awkward than the silence, now that it’s out in the air.
Tony’s genius is nothing short of amazing.  And so is Tony.
“I’m sorry,” Steve says.  “I’m bad at sitting around.  It reminds me of... before.”
Now it’s Tony’s turn to look incredibly dazzled.  He runs his hand through Steve’s hair then gives him a nudge away.
The whole scene is unexpectedly pleasant.
“Please let him look at you,” Bruce says gently.
“I’ll ask,” Bruce says. “I won’t do a medical procedure without his permission.  That includes scans.”
“I don’t know how it’s going to feel seeing Barnes for the first time, but I’m not dreading it.  And I do hope Bruce and Clint can make some magic happen.”
Steve hears a scuffle, like someone’s being pushed, and the sound of car keys, and then a thud, like a punch.  Steve tries the door.  It’s locked.  He shoves his shoulder into the wood and it opens into the room with a sharp crack.
“That’s ugly,” Sam says, joining them with the device, as Bruce carefully turns Clint’s wrist into a better position for scanning.
“He didn’t recognize me,” Steve says finally. “I don’t know what they’d have had to do to him to convince him to kill your folks. Bucky
“Oh god we’re still talking about it,” Bruce groans.
James seems to weigh all that in his mind then looks to Clint.
“You’re such a nerd but fine,” Tony says.  “Barton, you’re with us.”
“Does sound kind of intimate,” Bucky agrees.
Tony rolls his eyes.  “I’m dating Captain America.  Equal worth seems like a stretch.”
Tony closes his eyes for a second. Tries not to think about how many times he heard those exact words from Obie. Tries not to think about how much this is going to hurt if Steve’s playing him. And then he opens them again. Steve’s looking at Tony like he hung the goddamn moon. Like he’s sunshine on the first day of spring. Like no matter what Tony decides, he’s going to have his back.
“I’m dating Iron Man,” Steve points out.  “And he’s brilliant, and funny and a real handsome guy.”
“That’s not how I saw it at the time,” Tony says. “I believe you now. I know... I know how protective you are.”
6 Eggs Down - Tony wins
When the rest of the gang shows up, Tony leaves his hiding spot and joins them.  Bucky and Sam try a little jello for themselves.  Steve laughs at their cherry red lips, and he chats with Tony about things that are fun and normal and good.  They can definitely do this friendship thing.  Steve seems absolutely determined not to make another flirtatious move.
Tony stumbles to the door once he’s on two feet and then uses the wall for support to get to the bathroom. He’s no longer drunk, he’s just too weak and miserably hungover to trust his treacherous legs with all his weight. When he’s done and his hands are washed, Tony steps back out into the hallway.
The response is immediate.  A flurry of victory GIFs and thumbs up emoji buzz into both their phones.  It’s incredibly ridiculous and immature and Tony loves it.  It must show on his face because Steve’s staring at him.
“I don’t think you are. It’s just important to me to identify you in the way you want to be identified. I still-- I don’t really say the Other Guy’s name when I don’t have to. My friends all say it and it’s not like I can blame them; they’ve got to call him something. I just don’t like to own it.”
“You shouldn’t.”
“Ask Sam when he comes running in here at dawn and I’m only three-fourths of the way finished with his wings.”
“You know your old guns,” Nanna says, clearly pleased.  “It was a gift from JFK.”
Tony sounds insistent. Steve’s mostly stuck on the part where this might be the first time he’s ever heard Tony use his given name.
“You should,” Steve says firmly.  “You absolutely should.”
“Boop?” Tony asks finally. “You lost your virginity to a woman named Boop?”
Shayla’s as pretty as Steve expects.  She’s also an accomplished pianist and singer.  If Bucky was describing her Buck would have said something like she had legs that went on for miles and curves like a Coney Island roller coaster.  He was always better than Steve at describing things like that.  He could paint pictures with his words.  Steve can only paint pictures with... pictures... and he hasn’t really had the heart to pick up a sketchpad lately.
“Yes.  I could have used it,” Tony says.  “To throw at a ramp.  Which is exactly what I did.  Try it.”
“We should send him a thank you
“Nerds,” Clint sighs.
It’s well after midnight and they’ve all been hanging out in the living room, reading quietly for about half an hour, when Clint speaks up.
“If you feel like staying up,” Tony agrees, which is way more chill than the
“Tony, I’m concerned,” Bruce says carefully. “You can’t keep this up.”
“You need to see a doctor,” Steve insists.
She’s asking Tony’s boyfriend, who sighs dramatically.
Steve laughs.
Natasha isn’t far behind. She steps up behind Sam and wraps her arms around his waist.
“Has anyone ever told you how hot it is when you get indignant?” Tony asks. "Because I kind of want to jump you right now."
Despite having sworn off drinking for the rest of his life after the previous weekend’s hangover, Tony finds himself back at Lido’s for beer and fries on Friday night.  They’re celebrating.  Hammer and Stane are behind bars, and if the US Government and the SI Attorneys have anything to say about it it, they’ll be there for a long time.
“Good,” Howard says. “I don’t understand why you keep getting yourself into these situations, Tony. You could be the greatest player the game has ever seen. Do you understand that? Can you get it through your thick head what kind of responsibility that is? To our name? To our legacy?”
“I don’t have fun,” James tosses back, as if the very insinuation is insulting. “I don’t have-- any of this. This is a malfunction. More malfunctions. A long list of fuckin’ malfunctions.”
"Or you could not?"
a thought for future bedroom use.
Steve takes the seat next to him, and then rests his hand on Tony’s thigh under the table. It’s the kind of lazy, casual affection Tony loves. There’s nothing contrived about Steve. When Steve touches him, Tony isn’t left wondering if Steve’s doing it for his money, or his connections, or for fame.
“You didn’t know he was tracking you,” James says, repeating the thought from before the call.
Tony shoots and Steve throws himself horizontal. The whole arena takes a simultaneous gasp and
“There’s going to be more healing,” Bruce says. “So this isn’t your stopping point. Another day could make a big difference here, but if you feel like something’s wrong in the healing process I want to take that seriously. I have two suggestions, and whether or not we try them is entirely up to you. If you would rather just move on, I’m good with that.”
The bathroom is steamy when Steve opens the door, though thankfully the air isn’t overly hot.  Tony hasn’t been scalding himself.
“Or find a supply closet,” Natasha suggests. “No one wants to watch you two go at it.”
“Just don’t drink anything they try to hand you in a cup, and you’ll be fine,” Tony says. He hesitates. “How’s everyone else doing?”
They strip out of their gear and jumpsuits without much care for privacy.  Tony used to be so concerned with anyone seeing his arc reactor and now he doesn’t appear to think about it at all, as he guzzles some bottled water and stands around in nothing but his boxers.
They’re somewhere over Ohio when Tony starts to stir.  He’s not exactly awake as he struggles against the covers.
Tony doesn’t invite Steve to stay but he doesn’t seem unhappy when Steve clears off a chair and joins him.
“I can’t help it,” Steve says. “I’ve missed you.”
“No casualties,” JARVIS says through the speakers of the phone.  “Though the drones have contained and subdued Hammer’s staff.”
“I could go first,” Steve says gently.  “Mine’s easy at least.”
“I believe they are most happy to see you, Sir,” Jarvis interjects.
“We’ll walk,” Bruce says, as Natasha flicks her finger toward Steve and then points her thumb toward the car, so he knows he’s riding with Tony.
The seizing stops and James lies motionless in the grass except for the harsh rise and fall of his chest. Bruce waves the scanner over him starting with his head and moving it lower, forcing himself not to rush this despite the urgency. A blurry picture isn’t any more help than no picture at all. What the hologram starts to fill in as Bruce works is a nightmare.
Steve knows the usual lunch crowd and they are long over any Avenger celebrity awe. If someone does make a big deal out of him and Tony, it’ll be a tourist, and the diner doesn’t get too many of those.
They drink and they watch Star Trek and Steve is transfixed.  Tony makes a lot of jibes about the special effects and the fashion and the genius kid (who Steve suspects hits a little too close to home), but Steve can feel how much it means to Tony that he does enjoy the show.  He enjoys it a lot.
“We trust you,” Bruce says.
There’s quiet.  Even Tony’s silent, just staring at him with a puzzled expression.
“Why are you complaining?” Steve asks.  “You’re going to get 100 points out of it.”
“But I don’t,” Tony says.
Tony lets that sink in, looks a lot more pleased and then shifts to all fours so he can crawl back up the bed to Steve.
“JARVIS, wake me up when James wakes up?”
“Ugh, nooooo,” Steve complains, though now he’s laughing too. “I’m never going to get that out of my head. I need brain bleach. Or a time machine.”
Tony’s elevator opens and Steve and Natasha step out.  Natasha is all business.  Steve looks like he’s about to be sick.
“How about I put on some jeans?” Steve compromises.
“I think that sounds entirely doable,” Tony agrees.  “JARVIS could help you with the paperwork and with setting up a foundation.  He’s pretty much an expert at charitable giving.”
“Oh. Then I guess I figured it out before you two did. No big deal. I’m clearly a relationship savant. I mean, look at my boyfriend. I did good.”
“I’d like to state for the record that Sam did not know why he was doing this bullshit,” Sam inserts.
So it’s either a crush or all the french fries.  Fun times.
“I can walk through pain,” James disagrees.  “I’m malfunctioning; not useless.”
“Good,” Pepper says.  That one word contains a lot of emotion inside it, and Tony doesn’t miss the slight quiver in her voice.  But he also doesn’t have time to dwell on all the close calls that have led his steadfast friend to sound... all feely.
Clint speaks in Russian, and while Bruce can’t understand it, it’s calm and steady sounding.  Clint stays very still until James’s body slumps more heavily against the post and he lowers the scissors entirely. When that happens, Clint moves to stand.
Steve pulls Rhodey into a hug of their own. “Give ‘em Hell, Mop Man.”
Tony gives up on office work around 4.  He has no idea what he’s been reading for the last hour, anyway.  Patent paperwork, maybe?  It can matter later.  Right now what matters is all the nervous energy Tony needs to burn before he sees Steve.
“We good with just a tiny bit of property damage?” Natasha asks.
One second stretches into something out of time. It’s just the two of them. The crowd, their teammates, the whole world fades away.
“Yeah,” James says, finally sounding more like himself.  “I’d like that.”
Tony glares to let him know what a stupid question that is.
“No. The NDA. You said your assistant drew them up for you and that you always made people sign them. Where’s mine?”
“We’re not fucked,” Steve says, putting his hand on Tony’s arm to try and anchor him.  “Maybe this issue is just gonna take some time.”
But this morning, Tony wants to find Bruce, because Bruce left some new design specs on Tony's desk and they are
“Do you agree with him?” James asks. “Stark’s gonna want to experiment on me?”
A kudos from you!
“I like what you did there,” Bruce says.  “Looks good.”
"JARVIS, display it all. Start from the beginning. Pull up everything you've found."
“Don’t think of me as the nanny,” Rhodey says. “Think of me as the dude who shows up, makes sure you’ve showered, puts you in a suit, and gives you a shove toward a car.”
Tony’s face is buried in his knees but Steve sees his head bob and understands it as permission.  He eases closer to Tony and wraps an arm around him.  Tony leans fully into his grasp, still breathing rapidly and Steve applies a little pressure to his shoulder to help ground him.
Clint’s hilarious misadventures in juggling, his downright appalling abuse of ‘the ten second rule’ and his earnest love for his one-eyed dog make him a breakout YouTube star. Companies beg him for endorsements. He’s awarded free Dunkin’ Donuts for life.
“I’m impressed,” Steve says, inspecting Tony’s work.  “The balance on that’s got to be a real bitch.”
Sign and return to Stark Industries Human Resources, Stark Tower, 3rd Floor, New York, NY
Steve’s caught Tony working on his Iron Man suits a few times, but Tony doesn’t want to talk about it. Clint and Natasha still aren’t ready to have Tony back on the team, and they all know it. And while their friends seem to genuinely enjoy Tony’s company again, they don’t turn their backs on him.
“Hidden drawer...” Tony coos in an awed whisper.
Bruce is sure it doesn’t help that he and Sam are stained with blood. They’d scrubbed off what they could but without a shower they can only get so clean.
“Does come back later mean something different in this century?”  Steve snarks.
<3 Arrow
Tony’s not sure if he’s talking about the coffee or about him. He doesn’t ask.
JARVIS pipes in then, with new instructions for saving James and Bruce loses track of everything else after that. He can hear Clint and Nat talking, and then Tony and Steve as well, but words aren’t registering. For Bruce there’s really nothing other than JARVIS’s efficient instructions, Sam’s quiet reassurances, and a whole lot of blood.
“About a million things, and not a single one of them has to do with my wardrobe,” Bruce laughs.  “Let me go check on James, and then we’ll catch up.”
“I fix things,” Tony says finally.  “Not always because I want to.”
Tony can hear him walking slowly up the stairs. He resists the urge to throw anything in Rhodey’s general direction.
“Tonight.  7 PM.  Meet me here,” Rhodes says.
Now that Steve’s made up his mind, he’s eager to move forward and he’s hopeful his friends will understand.
“Boop was an amazing woman and she was kind to me at a time when I was lost and confused and alone. Very, very patient. She’d have had to have been, because I didn’t know any more about how to get around a woman’s body than I did about how to navigate Albuquerque.”
“Do you want to have to hold all our Avenger team meetings in a jail cell?” Steve asks.  “Because that’s where this is going to land me.”
“That-- that makes me think you and I need to have a separate talk about where babies comes from,” Bruce says. “But that’s the concept, yeah. What do you think, James? Does that feel valid to you at all? Because I could be full of shit. That’s fine, too.”
“That depends,” Steve says.  “Are we talking a translation from an earlier translation or did you work from the original Italian?”
“Oh?”
They’re half way through their feast when Mae drops off the milkshake menu. True to her word, the Iron Man is back in its spot. Tony reads the list then looks up at her.
“What’s this?” Steve asks.
In 57 minutes of game play, he only lets one puck by him, and it’s a top shelf, glove side goal from the point.  He stops every other attempt and it sets the Stars up for a score of 1 to 1. Steve barely notices Tony on the ice now. He’s got eyes for the puck and that’s it. He’s making saves that are going to light up the highlight reels for years to come. It’s the game of his career. He’s playing for himself, yes, and his upset at Tony is giving him a sort of laser-focus, too, and he wants to win this for Bucky.
“Bucky, shut up,” Clint groans.  “Unless you brought me coffee from home and then I don’t care, just give me coffee.  I’ll love you forever.”
“Why don’t you take some time and find out?” Tony asks.  He abandons all pretense of making sandwiches, to step around the counter and rest his hands on Steve’s hips.  “I can keep you financially secure and I am
“Give me another one. I’ll do better.”
His rude comment is cut off by a rough shove to the shoulder, and surprise of surprises, it doesn’t come from Steve.  Clint pushes Brock hard enough that Brock hits the nearest wall with a loud thud.  Hard enough that dust from the ceiling shakes down into their hair.
“Do you have what’s left of them?”
“Child’s play,” Tony sighs.  “You’re sure, Nanna?  This could be dangerous and I don’t know I’m worth it.”
“I’ll do it,” Tony volunteers.   He might as well make himself useful until Bucky gives him something else to do.
Tony looks so deeply concerned, it's kind of incredible.  The man has a world to save, an empire to run, a past to grieve, and a hundred other things on his plate, but damn it all-- he's going to rescue these birds.
“Why? Do you have some kind of paintball crossbow you’re trying to break in?” Steve asks.
Steve shakes his head.  “He moved out of the tower.  He’s staying with Clint over in Bed-Stuy.  I don’t think he’s up for a visit just yet.”
The three of them and JARVIS work seamlessly together, and Steve knows he’s only in the way.  He’s got no more to contribute here than he’s got to give to Bruce and Nat and Sam.
“See if you can help him stay like this, but don’t restrain him,” Bruce directs as Clint joins him. “And don’t put anything in his mouth.”
Steve chuckles at that. “Or maybe I’m just here to kick your ass at hockey.”
Sure, he’s the better coach. Tony is positive Howard would have some tips and tricks that Tony might lack. But he will never allow Howard to squeeze the joy out of hockey for his niece the way he’d done it to Tony.
“Really?” Steve asks. “That joke was stale in the 1940s.”
When Dr. Gerber brings up the importance of equality in a relationship one last time, Tony loses his patience entirely.
It leads to more stories about Tony, and Steve finds out things from Pepper that have never appeared in any SHIELD file on Stark.  Steve had no idea that Tony’s designed more third-world accessible medical technology than whole universities put together.  Or that on occasion he puts on his full Iron Man gear to visit the children’s cardiology ward and walk around making all the patients honorary Avengers. Good Morning New York had certainly made no mentions of the 3D printed limbs Tony’s developed for injured soldiers, or that Stark Industries provides them free of cost.
“I set Jarvis loose on them,” Tony explains. “If it’s tech, and they touch it, they get a blue screen of death that tells them to apologize to you in person for being unprofessional dicks. They’re going on ohhhh... 20 hours with no phones, internet or Xbox.”
You just don’t want to admit you lost, Rogers. Should have known you’d be a sore loser after all that whining.
“I’m sorry I wasn’t more attentive,” Steve says. “I’m sorry I gave you reason to worry. I would never consider going home with someone else. I don’t want to be with anyone but you.”
“Unmute me, J,” Tony says.  He waits a moment until he hears Bruce breathing on the other end of the call.  “Spangles and SpyGirl are here, but you’re not on speaker.  Where were we?”
Steve crosses the room and takes a seat next to Tony on the bench. He carefully places a hand on Tony’s wrist. Tony can shove him away if he wants. This isn’t a show of power, it’s supposed to be comfort.
“Barton, I will end you!” Steve hears Natasha shout from across the woods.
“Go-- away,” Tony grits out.  “Mfine-- totally dying-- but fine.”
“Heeeeeeey,” Steve says, drawing out the word to shush away that line of thinking.  “You didn’t fuck anything up.  Nothing between us, anyway.  Where’s this coming from?”
Tony somehow manages to laugh and cry a little more at the same time.
“And Plan B?” Steve asks.
Steve’s changed into sweats and a t-shirt, and again, that’s something Tony hasn’t seen before. At his place, Steve’s either in his work clothes, or in his boxers, or in less, and then back to his work clothes again in the morning. Casual Steve is something Tony is looking forward to seeing more of.
“I wouldn’t say better,” Steve disagrees.  Not better by a long shot but she’s not wrong.  Something small has shifted.  And while he’s far from being okay he’s definitely not as miserable he was when he woke up that morning.
“Bucky’s word.  Not mine,” Steve says.  He’s trying to sound put out, but there’s a smile in his voice.
It takes Bruce a while to get to sleep after he showers and lays down in bed. Clint’s words bounce around in his thoughts until finally exhaustion wins sometimes around 2 am. When he wakes the next morning to light streaming through the window, he hears sounds of life outside the door. He can’t make out what’s being said, but he hears two voices he know are James and Clint (mostly Clint). There are dishes clanking, and Clint laughs. Bruce can smell meat cooking. He stays in bed an extra few minutes to enjoy the peaceful feeling that comes with starting out the day knowing everyone’s alive and in one piece.
Steve sucks in a breath and holds it there, before letting it out slowly.
“We won’t stop you if you have to go,” Bruce says. “But personally, I’d like it if you stayed. There’s no punishment for this. I understand why scissors can be a trigger. They are for me, too. You didn’t do anything wrong.”
“Nearly got himself killed?” Steve asks.
Hammer was giddy at the prospect.  Clapped and gushed and offered the guy a few hundred-thousand dollars right there on the spot.
“They’ve been sitting there for years.  Another day isn’t going to make a difference.”
Steve’s pretty sure the only way the milkshake brag is true is if Clint’s ordering five a day, and hearing Clint call himself uncle is so ridiculous it brings a smile to Steve’s face no matter how bleak things feel.
“Tony,” Steve warns, good-naturedly. “You’re making him nervous.”
“The memories?” Clint guesses sleepily.
It’s Bucky’s first time with the new glove Tony had designed for him. It turns out Tony’s been designing shit for years that no one ever knew about. And now that he’s out of the game, it’s a full-time gig, or it would be a full-time gig if he hadn’t been absolutely serious about coaching his niece.
“If there’s any news, J can send it to your phone. You don’t need to be in this exact spot.”
“Go away,” Tony mumbles.
“Tony, what did you do?” Steve asks.
Steve walks to the security desk and looks down, keeping the brim of his hat over his face to hide some of how idiotic this is.
He’s not upset at Clint’s suggestions.  Steve’s relaxing by the second and Tony can’t help but think Clint has a gift for getting inappropriate at the times they all need it most.
They continue until they’re both out of breath.  Steve aches with how much he wants this to go further.
Clint shakes his head no.  “The other half start with people trying to kill
“Yeah.  Might as well,” Tony says.
“Then he could do it for Bucky?”
“What did you do?”
The confession takes a huge amount of effort and still it’s not very descript.  Steve really has no words for what he’s feeling.  No adjectives for his abject misery.  No verbs for the sobs he buries in his pillow.  Language can’t work around the sort of numb and terrible longing that has gripped him since he woke up in the hospital a month and a half before.
Steve smiles.  “Okay then,” he says, reaching over to rub Tony’s thigh.  “Have at it.  Shop away.”
“Bruce texted?”  Steve asks, trying hard to make his tone even.  Keep it uncomplicated by the sort of desperate misery he’s cocooned himself in.  This morning’s reading has been rough.  It’s difficult to shake it off long enough to make words work in a polite direction.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I can think of lots of people who owe you apologies,” Steve disagrees.
“I’m bi,” Tony repeats again slowly. “I’ve just been reallllllllllly good at hiding it. And now I kind of wish I hadn’t. All this bad press-- I should have taken that hit. Made the way for guys like you.”
“What kind of world would it be if all of the worst mistakes we ever made were held against us?  Because that’s the world Tony lives in.  Everywhere he turns there are people telling him he can’t make up for his past and people waiting for him to fail.”
“Did you even write this?” Steve asks.  He’s still gripping the paper, and he looks so annoyed Tony’s forced to take the question seriously.
“How long does James have?” Clint asks, interrupting Bruce’s guilt spiral while tapping rapidly at his phone.
Clint flings a fry at her and she manages to catch it in her mouth and then she throws her hands up in the air victorious, like the giant nerd that she is.
And what had the future given him?  Dog Cops.
“No,” Steve says adamantly.  “I’ve eaten K-rations that were more appealing.”
“It's what I should have done a long time ago,” Steve says quietly.  “What I said-- that wasn’t off the top of my head.  I’ve rehearsed it for months-- in the shower, in the gym... in bed at night.  Not as a speech to deliver in a hearing, but to say to you.  So you’d understand...”
“Fuck yes,” Bruce agrees in a rush. “JARVIS, can you access the scanner Tony sent me?”
dating.  I don’t know.  I’m out of practice.  You’re the expert.”
Take care of yourself,
“Not anymore?”
The question is like a punch to the gut.  The night Steve and Jarvis had bonded over destroying the sex tape had given Steve a glimpse of how much Jarvis cares about Tony.  But in this moment, he has no doubt that Jarvis is capable of more care than Steve thought possible from a machine.  What he’s hearing sounds like love.  Because what
Natasha is there, carrying two glasses of water and a bottle of tylenol that she has tucked under her arm. She’s wearing purple pajamas spotted with little pink bullseyes.
Sometimes it feels like chasing ghosts.
Steve picks up his bagel, gives Tony a nod, and exits quickly.  Jarvis has the elevator door already open for him.
“I wasn’t exactly at my best,” James says.
“Nothing new,” Bruce says.  “But when you wake up I’d like to do a few new scans to be sure.”
“Tony,” Steve breathes out.
“You want a beer?” Tony asks.
“Kind of, yeah,” Steve admits. “But we shouldn’t. Too many witnesses.”
then kindly tell him to take his phone and shove it up his--”
“I don’t know why I’m here,” Steve admits. “You really hurt me.”
“Will you stay?”
Which sounds like a no, but then panels in the wall light up with a blue glow that flash in a pattern Steve takes as direction.  He follows them up the stairs, and then down a clear-plated hallway lined with two levels of labs.  Steve sees Dr. Banner below, but Bruce seems thoroughly engaged in his work and Steve doesn’t want to bother him.  The lights that are showing him the way end at door that’s up one more set of stairs.
James doesn’t respond. He’s distracted by his reflection in the window.  He runs his skin-covered fingers carefully over his hair. He looks troubled.
(+10)
“As of a few minutes ago, yes,” Bruce says. “Tony-- I don’t know what to do.”
Steve walks around the lab like it’s Disneyland.  He gets down on his knees to meet U and Dum-E so he can speak to them on their level.  And when he does speak, he talks to them like they’re special.  He says it’s nice to meet them and reaches out a careful hand to touch them reverently.
James gives him a small nod and Tony reaches above his head to grab for the swinging arm of the more advanced scanner Bruce had pulled in.
Once he sees the knee, he knows there isn’t much he’s going to be able to do in the barn.
He applies pressure with each finger separately to make it more obvious.
“Okay,” Tony says, pushing himself to his feet.  “Okay, yeah.  I’m done here for the night.”
JARVIS has the doors open for them before they get to the elevator.
“Exactly like that.”  He pauses, and then picks up another bagel.  “I’m gonna eat this in the elevator, shower fast and then meet you back up here.  You’re really okay to leave?  I know you’ve got a lot--”
It scares Bruce that James didn’t run. It scares him because if he’s somehow put a psychological leash on the guy, it’s going to be a nightmare getting James the help he needs. And that doesn’t even start on the heaps of guilt Bruce will feel. Is already feeling.
but he wanted to know the specific part of their current shitshow that was causing Steve so much pain.  So Tony’d typed out a few lines of code to force a sneaky screenshare.
“S’bad break?” Clint asks.
Tony throws the phone like it burns his hand and it hits the wall hard and thunks to the floor all in one piece.
“Hulk’s still running around somewhere.”
“Hydra isn’t looking for me. I went down with the helicarrier. They won’t be looking for you either. They have other objectives.”
“You good with that Bruce?” Natasha calls back.
“Queen Natasha has spoken,” Nat declares.
“Come with me,” Tony says.
“Barnes wasn’t in the city,” Sam says.  “We’re pretty sure he wasn’t on the continent.  But he was there at some point in time.  These prove it.”
“M’in New York,” Tony says.  His voice is rough, either from shouting or vomiting or disuse.  It’s impossible to tell.
“We’re rewarding ourselves for making the other happy,” Tony says.  “Is there any way that can be a bad thing?”
“All clear,” James reports, coming to stand in the center of the living room. He looks exhausted, despite his rigid posture.
Steve knows Tony’s being sarcastic and rhetorical, but you know what?  He’s got an answer for this.  A memory that comes to mind more often than Steve would like, when he remembers his mother.
“We can move out to the porch after breakfast,” Clint says.  “That way the wind can do some of the work and we won’t have to sweep up.”
“I don’t know if I could,” Steve admits.  “Some of my friends... Hydra’d captured them and when I found them they were strapped to beds.  Tied up in cages.  Kind of ruined the whole bondage thing for me.”
It's always so hard,
“Why am I in the bathtub?”
Steve laughs.  Really, honestly laughs.  This is so much better than the misery of the past few weeks.
Thankfully, Tony seems to have the same plan.
“Come in,” Steve calls.
They all look starstruck and shell-shocked.  Like the halfway point between a rock concert and a war zone.  Steve can see from their tags that they’re interns.  Must be eighteen or nineteen at most.
The morning is a bad place. The sun is pain. Alcohol is never again.
Steve gives Tony a dirty look, and Tony looks extremely pleased with himself.  He really must love being a little shit.  Which is probably why Steve is enjoying this conversation.
“I’ll call Kate,” Clint says. “She’ll take care of him.”
Clint snags a fry off Steve’s plate, just to be a brat, and dips it in ketchup before shoving it in his mouth. “Just don’t expect the rest of us to be so forgiving.”
“Oh my God, you’re jealous!” Bruce whispers. He’s radiating delight. He’s grinning like a maniac.
“I ate,” Steve shrugs.
Natasha kicks Clint under the table.
“Selfishly.”
“If you are looking for a blanket, Captain Rogers, I can direct you,” JARVIS says at low volume.
“And here I told Steve we wouldn’t see you until noon,” Rhodey greets.
“A story I’m going to demand to hear over lunch,” Tony says.  He turns on the car and puts it in drive.  “For now, we’re going to talk about feelings and it’s going to suck and just... roll with it, okay?”
“Just-- just a weird couple of days,” Steve says.  “At the end of one of the worst weeks of my life.”
“Pretty sure that applies to every Avenger,” Tony consoles.  He takes Steve’s hand in his own and threads their fingers together.  “You built him up in your head. People rarely live up to the hype,” Tony says gently.  “My whole life growing up, I had this ridiculous crush on Captain America.  Read every comic.  Snuck into my dad’s archives to look at old war plans that Cap had scratched some art on.  I had high expectations--”
“I have to hurry back for a meeting and you shouldn’t rush this,” Pepper says.
Tony nods.  “I really think we are.”
“Yeah, okay,” Tony says. “You’re hired.”
“Naked science is nothing you’d have wanted to see anyway,” Tony says, before taking a swig of his smoothie.  “I was serious about the pale thing.  Banner’s ass is stellar but
Tony’s hyperventilating between words and Steve walks around the bed and sits down next to him.  Tony has the blanket half covering his head and he’s folded himself into a tight ball.  It’s no wonder he wants privacy since it’s such an intimately helpless scene.
“Thank you, Pepper,” Steve says. “For everything.”
“Why did you invite us to the tower? Why help at all if you think this is for nothing?”
“No guilt eyes,” Bruce confirms. “Come in. Make yourself at home.”
It couldn’t have happened to a nicer person.
“Understood.”
“I get it,” Tony says.  “I’m the wild card, here.  And for the record, I’m with you on Steve’s trust issues.  Shoot me once, shame on you.  Shoot me six times...”
“One’s got skin and one’s got metal. That seem complicated to you?” James asks. His eyes flicker up to Bruce’s face and he looks almost amused.
Miraculously, Tony doesn’t argue.  He climbs into the passenger seat and buckles himself in.  He’s still weak, and he’s definitely got the shakes.  Steve knows this can’t be easy.  That Tony must be absolutely miserable.
Clint’s scream sends nearby wildlife running.
“Would SI really mass-produce it if you design something?”
“Ask,” James says.
Tony nods.  “I’m well acquainted with that one.  I went to college when I was 14, and I was...”
When he spots Tony in warmups it’s the first time he’s laid eyes on him since the weekend everything went wrong. It was one weekend. Why is he still so hung up over this?
Tony puts his hands on his knees and pushes up to stand.  There’s definitely a part of him that wants to argue.  About the complexities of super soldier brainwashing.  About the video from the bridge in DC and of the fight down at ground level.  About the
James chews at the inside of his bottom lip, considering. “You two aren’t gonna leave me?”
“I’d forgotten,” Tony says.  “I didn’t cheat, I swear.  I just... it wasn’t important and so I forgot about it.”
have a kudos or two!
For one, because Tony’s swearing up a blue streak and it’s hilarious.  For another: forearms.
“We appreciate you coming to us,” Rhodes says, once Steve takes his seat.
“God, I wish Tony was here. He loves it when you break out the F-bombs.”
“Let us move you somewhere safe. If we can’t sort this shit out on own we know some heavy hitters who can.”
“This might be different. At least give it a chance?”
Not ever.
Mae lets the words hover for a few seconds, then pats Steve’s hand as she stands.  “You’re one of the good ones, Steve Rogers.  You’d make any mama proud.  Now when Mr. Stark is better, you bring him around.  I’ll have the shake renamed for him by then.”
Tony isn’t sure what to make of the offer.  Dinner sounds good.  Time with Steve always sounds good.
“Is there anything I can do from here?”
“Injuries need to be noted in my field report,” Steve sighs.  He’s tired.  He needs to eat.  He just wants to get the damn paperwork done.  At least he knows what a SpongeBob is; he doesn’t need to waste time looking it up.  “I swear, between you and Barton, I’m never going to finish one of these things on my first try,” he mumbles, mostly to himself.
Until...
He texts Steve.  Or actually he composes a text, changes it twenty times, bangs his head against his desk because he’s garbage at this, deletes the texts, writes a new text, and then presses send before he can talk himself out of it.  All for:
“You’ll get it sticky,” Steve snaps, and snatches the BannerBar away from Tony just to make him stop. “How is eating this sponge going to be useful?”
How Clint can see through the smoke and the dirt and the distance is a mystery, but Tony’s got his own eyes up in the sky and JARVIS speaks through his phone a moment later.
3) The Day After the Funeral in ‘91.
The next two weeks are some of the longest of Steve’s life. He’s antsy all the time. He’s distracted in conversation, because his brain is far more interested in replaying that last hug with Tony than thinking about anything useful to SHIELD. This isn’t the first time Steve’s been stuck on someone like this. It was just as bad with Peggy. Boy, did he have it bad for her there in the beginning.
A Hawkeye is peanut butter, maple syrup, and marshmallow fluff.  A Black Widow is dark chocolate strawberry.  Despite the waitresses’ protests, a Hulk is not mint.  It’s bright orange mango, since Steve gets the feeling Bruce has had enough green in his life to last him a lifetime.  Thor is raspberry rainbow.  The Iron Man shake takes the most thought, but Steve finally settles on coffee, cookies and cream.  It sounds a little strange when he thinks up the combination but once he tries them all together it ends up being his favorite.  Go figure.
Tony’s body does not disappoint.  Sure, there are scars.  And an arc reactor.  There is absolutely nothing unattractive about either.  If anything, the imperfections add to Steve’s attraction.  Without the scars and the reactor Tony wouldn’t be alive.  He loves them, because they’re a part of the journey that brought them here.
. And Tony’s feelings aren’t hard to hurt when he’s left out.”
Steve ignores him and drops to his knees to pick up the bigger pieces one by one.  “I prefer to clean up my own messes.”
“Can I cheat?” Tony asks.  “Talk about Jarvis and Ana instead of mom and dad?”
“Incapacitating cartridge emitting rail-gun,” Natasha explains. “I know the kid who designed it. He’s good people. Whatever we gave James is safe.”
The nest powers down.
“You know that for certain?” Bruce asks.
When they arrive at the penthouse, it’s spotlessly clean and the air is lemony stale.  The whole place smells like citrus cleaner and closed windows. Steve wanders around, carrying Tony, until he finds the master bedroom, walks through it to master bathroom and then places Tony carefully in the bathtub, fully clothed.
It’s been a long time since he’s had a friend he trusted like this.  Seven decades, at least.
Steve groans, and then stands, crossing the distance between them in two steps.  He rests his hands on Tony’s hips and leans in to press a kiss to his forehead.
“Feel free to declare me your queen,” Natasha said, handing Steve back the Team IronAmerica flag.
He’s walked all the way to the door when Tony speaks.
“For a couple of minutes,” Tony concedes.  “No rest for the wicked.”
“Coming next on IceTalk Weekly: Should more teams start suspending for less? If Tony Stark and Steve Rogers are any proof, the answer is yes. Stark was out for alcohol, and Rogers for a fight off the ice, and you know what they have in common? Their return to the game has brought with it the kind of hockey play I haven’t seen in 30 years. Stay tuned for an in-depth analysis.”
“I watched my dad prioritize work over his family and friends way too often.  Come on.  I’m done letting history repeat itself, aren’t you?  So what do you say: Burgers?  Fries?  Seriously, you’re giving me a complex with the not talking thing,” Tony says, making a sort of wild gesture at Steve’s face.  “Talk.”
It’s small talk.  He ought to be better at it, but he isn’t, so he takes a huge drink to keep from blurting out any follow up questions.  He’d pay a lot of money to be half as smooth one on one as he is when he’s charming crowds.  Intimate conversation is not his strong suit.
“But he didn’t?” James guesses.
Steve’s only met Colonel Rhodes a handful of times.  When he meets him in late January at a military event and asks if he has a minute to talk about Tony, Rhodes looks unhappy.
“Everything we need and more, Sir,” JARVIS confirms.  “I am sending you the most pertinent information now.”
Steve shakes himself from this line of thought as he pulls into the private entrance to Tony’s personal garage.  All the cars are where Tony had left them.  And they are gleaming clean.
“If you come with us to New York you won’t be a prisoner.  You won’t be a slave.  None of us would ever deliberately make you do
“If you’d just
They both end up reinstated within the week. They don’t see each other again, but they text. Text every day. Enough that both Bucky and Clint notice right away, and the rest of the team notices by Steve’s third game back. Their third win in a row, after a cold streak while Steve was out. That’s all it takes for the tide of public opinion to turn. He’s back to being Brooklyn’s sweetheart.
“You said her name’s Jenny?” Steve asks.
Bucky reaches under the tattered carpet at the rear of the van, gives something Tony can’t see a hard yank, and a false floor pulls out.  Not only had they been riding with a frankly terrifying assortment of flammables, they were riding on top of a goddamn armory.
“Jarvis--” Steve starts.
and august is, too.
Shit. Are you alright?
“Yeah,” Steve agrees.  “I mean-- that army of flea drones that distracted the helicopter definitely created themselves.”
There’s a pause.
Steve’s led back through a series of halls to a holding room separate from the rest.
“You can bet on it.”
His whole body freezes and his expression goes from annoyed to panicked in an instant. He shuts his eyes hard. Bruce stares in worried fascination as James’s face smooths into something cold and impassive.
“In my defense, you were asking me to sign an awful lot of paperwork,” Tony replies.
This doesn't feel like rejection, more like disbelief.  Steve pulls over to the side of the road and puts the car in park.  He wants to have this conversation without distraction.
When he finishes at the bar (he doesn’t even want to think about how much of Tony’s money he’s poured down the drain) Jarvis directs him to the kitchen, then to Tony’s workshop, and then to his office.  The alcohol is never very hidden because Tony’s never had a reason to hide it.  None of his recent boyfriends or girlfriends showed concern about the amount that he drank.
Right.  Tony might have let that particular daydream go on a few awkward seconds too long.
With his mind made up, he waits until the very last minute to change out of his Dior suit into a pair of beat up jeans and a faded MIT shirt.  He throws on a hoodie and a ballcap and hopes that's enough to throw off any paparazzi that might be wandering the streets of New York.   They don't wait outside the building anymore like they used to, since the chances of getting a glimpse of Tony have gone to nil the last few months.
Steve bites at his bottom lip, like he’s nervous and then hitches his head toward the kitchen.
“You kiss me every time I’m a bigger science nerd than Neil Degrasse Tyson.”
“What the hell are these?” Clint asks, after unwrapping the first set of bars from their brown paper.  “I watched you eat about a thousand of the silver ones.”
“I think it’s a good idea if you’re comfortable with it,” Bruce says. “Tony’s right. Working on the static issue from the start could give us better results in the end. It’s up to you, though. We can go on without it and no one will be angry if you say no.”
Tony snatches the shirt back toward his chest like Gollum with the precious.
“Give me a second,” Tony says.  “Gonna put you on mute.”
Steve’s back to speaking to Dum-E and U in a low, kind voice, and Tony digs his fingers into his palm.
“You guys should go,” Steve adds. “Have fun. You don’t need to be in here moping with me.”
It’s their first charity event since Tony’s return. The only reason they are here is because it honors the last World War II veterans, and there are so few of them left now, Steve doesn’t want to miss. He isn’t sure how many of them will be left when next year rolls around.
“I’m proud of you,” Steve says, as he climbs in.
According to what Clint tells them later that night, the word translates to “Poltergeist who lives in the house and causes mischief and also grips your ankles with long spindly fingers in the middle of the night when you sleep barefoot.”
“Better now,” Bruce agrees.  He even means it.
That makes Tony smile.  Jarvis isn’t wrong.
James gives a slight nod. “Tell him to find some playing cards and get his ass in here.”
Though maybe if he asks Tony he could get some access to it.  Come in after hours, and have a security guard unlock it.  Have some privacy, maybe.  It’s worth asking.
Steve nods.  “You’re right.  It is a good superhero name.  A good song, too.  How about you let me get you both to your town cars and after you’ve given it some more thought you can call me in the morning.  We’ll talk.”
“Wouldn’t have you any other way.”
“Bullshit,” Bucky laughs, shoving the man playfully hard in the side.  The guy is so built it doesn’t even budge him.  “Steve here’s too good at photoshop,” Bucky continues.  “We’d be looking at pictures of him on the moon, wishing we weren’t all down by 5,000 points.  His cheatin’ ass is judge by default.”
“It’s for the rich and famous only,” Rhodey says. “And I’m neither of those things.”
James gives up any attempt at sitting and flops back down, the heaviness of his arm more apparent now that he has no control over it. His whole body pulls to the left.
Rhodey strapped to a chair.  Tony smells the blood and the electricity.  The tang of a car battery and burning skin.
The guard doesn’t look impressed, but he does seem a little less skeptical about the odds of this working.  He types something, waits, types something else and then nods toward an elevator that has opened from the blank wall behind him.
There is the slightest hint of life in the soldier’s stare.
“Not the glass,” Tony clarifies. He walks over to join Steve and kneels down to help him with the clean-up.  “Barnes.  You blame yourself for what happened to him so now you’re the one who’s going to clean up the mess.  Even if it gets you killed.”  It’s not a question.  A question would be pointless when Tony already knows the answer.
“Did he go visit my things a lot then?” Steve asks.
“How long is this tranq going to last?” Bruce asks, as he slumps to the ground, under the med bed.
“I can’t do this,” Tony repeats.
Bruce is holding a taco and looking guilty.
Steve has given Tony a lot to think about lately.  Maybe too much.
Steve swallows hard.
“Prototypes,” Tony says.  He points to the horizon, where sure enough, a gray cloud of swirling metal is flying fast in their direction.
“What’s that?” Steve asks.  He’s smirking.  With his hearing there’s no way he missed it.
“Yeah.  I picked up what I could,” Sam says.
) they were likely leaked.  And by all rights, not his to see.
“JARVIS will fly us anywhere we want to go,” Tony says.  “I made it for the Avengers.  Technically it’s SHIELD’s but I can use it when I want.”
“In that case, give me a minute to change into something more comfortable and I’ll meet you down there.”
As always, you can find me on tumblr at
Clint flips off Tony and Steve and then dashes around to the other side of the SUV.
“She was.  And so was Mr. Jarvis.  It’s funny.  I always called Ana by her first name, but I called Jarvis by his last.  They never corrected me.”
Clint and Natasha fix him with identical looks of pity.  Clint speaks his next words slowly, like Steve’s the Kindergarten glue-eater.
Steve can see the concern in his eyes.  Probably because Steve doesn’t talk about this stuff enough.  After all these months, this shouldn’t be a surprise to Tony. It's Steve's fault that it is.
“An invitation isn’t the worst plan I’ve heard,” Natasha says slowly.
He’s already pretty sure he knows the answer. Knows that Tony wouldn’t resort to bribery. That he’s changing. Getting better. Risking more.
"You'd better not keep her waiting," Steve agrees.
Bruce feels all the tiny hairs on the back of his neck prickle.  Logic keeps him in control. James isn’t upset and he isn’t aiming his guns anywhere. Honestly, he doesn’t seem nearly as alarmed by the distant intruder as he does by the cutesy-wootsy house.  Bruce can at least take a breath.
“Not a problem,” Tony says, his voice carefree and just-this-side of flirtatious.  It breaks the tension. “Just do something impressive today.  Blow up something awesome.  Make it worth my time.”
Tony eyes him wearily.  “I don’t need your help.”
“You’re doctor Robert Bruce Banner, born in Dayton, Ohio, to Dr. Brian and Rebecca Ban--”
James carries the computer over to join them at the table when Bruce and Clint sit down to eat.
could get hurt,” Steve objects.
Clint doesn’t have to think about it. “Yeah, I would. I never trusted doctors much growing up.
When Steve’s at the buffet, Tony’s getting a refill of what is hopefully water. (Steve might not like the guy, but he’d also been sad to hear about the drinking relapse.) When Tony’s at the buffet, Steve makes sure he’s somewhere else.
to be in Tony’s lab.  Wants to meet his bots.  Things only gets worse when the elevator comes to a halt.
“How much of this hillside you think we can send into the air?” Clint asks, surveying the deep pit ahead of them.
“It will be okay,” Steve says, looking at Tony with all the determined earnestness of a basset hound puppy.
famous, and I would say, up until around the first time I met him, he was kind of notorious for being a dick.”
He tightens his arms around Tony and breathes him in.  Wills this moment to see them through forever.
Clint is cackling loud enough to be heard easily despite the distance.  “It wasn’t me, Nat!  It was Tony, I swear.  He’s a sharpshooter.  You’ve got to keep your eyes on that guy.”
“I’d tell him that I’m sorry,” Steve says without needing to think about it.
Tony hits rock bottom and Steve refuses to leave him there.
“Thanks,” Bruce says. He really can’t say anything more than that or he risks word vomiting to Clint that he’s a fraud, and a monster, and why don’t any of them have better sense than to spend time with him for fuck’s sake, he’s
“Haven’t looked,” James says, his face and eyes aim straight ahead. “The leg is functional,” he adds a little hesitantly, as if he’s concerned Bruce might assume otherwise from this report.
No one follows them down the hill.  When they emerge from the forest at the bottom of the hill, there’s a Stark SUV waiting.  The doors swing open and Natasha’s in the driver’s seat.  Sam has taken shotgun and the rear seats are empty and waiting.
“If you reconnect it, will the feedback come back?” James asks. He sounds worried. Bruce totally gets that.
Tony’s smiling when Rhodey and Jenny arrive.
Steve glances down the hall.  He takes a deep breath, and Tony can see the pained reluctance there, to leave James.
Terrible timing?  Your name is Steve Rogers.
Steve knows there aren’t any magic words to fix this mess between them.  Even if there were, Steve wouldn’t use them if it meant a shortcut around all the pain.  Tony needs rehab.  He needs time.  He needs to heal.
“I want a life,” James says, sounding sad. “Don’t know how possible that’s gonna be since Stark’s got every right to want to see me locked up.  I won’t fight it, if that’s why he’s here. I know that’s what I deserve.”
“She said everyone called her Boop,” the kid offers helpfully. “Like Betty Boop?”
“If you couldn’t stop yourself from killing?” Bruce guesses.
Nanna looks at Tony with so much warmth, it makes Tony feel a little itchy inside.  He’s never really had the grandparent thing.  This is something he could get used to, though.
“Have you seen Star Trek yet?” Tony asks.  “Specifically the Next Generation?”
“Nat knows what she’s doing,” Steve says.  “And so does Tony when he’s not handing out his address on National Television.  I think they’ll be fine.”
“I don’t have a clue,” Steve admits.
“That’s stupid,” Tony says.
“Awwww, Cap.  You should have called me,” Tony says.  “JARVIS can track down anything, can’t you J?”
Steve is enthralled.  Days could pass, and Steve’s pretty sure he’d be content right where he is.  At least until Tony yawns.
“He’s been texting me updates from the Piggly Wiggly,” Bruce says. “It looks like they’re having fun.  I just hope they’re managing to have it discreetly.”
When Tate and I wrote The Company You Keep I was new to the Marvel universe and she was a Bucky/Steve shipper so that's the direction we went.  Now she's moved on to other fandoms and with her enthusiastic permission, I'm
“With time to prepare,” JARVIS chimes in, “I believe I could be.”
“I might stay,” the soldier says, stepping over a few feet to a low, square hay bail and then carefully lowering himself onto it. “Will you tell him I’m here?”
“I’m out of bed before noon because I wanted to see you,” Tony says.
At Tony’s warning, Natasha and Clint freeze.
“Pillows and pajamas and all that,” the male host agrees, enthusiastically.  “I think we can make that happen.  What do you think, audience?  Would you be interested?”
“When there was nothing of me... only the mission and what Hydra put in there... I knew him.”
Operation: If I’m not in Peru I’m in trouble. Take 2.
The car arrives a few minutes later, and Steve smiles the whole way home.
“You wouldn’t have known where we were going even if I told you,” Tony says, easing the huge SUV into a narrow clearing.  He puts it in park and undoes his safety belt.  “Okay.  Everybody out.  Steve and I need to kill you and bury you real quick because we’ve got an appointment up the road in...” he glances at his watch.  “Half an hour.”
"Right. I guess that explains everything then, doesn't it?" Tony snaps in return.
James nods.
“Can I put an arm around you?” Steve asks.  “It might help.”
Steve gives Tony a light nudge so Tony will look at him.
“That’s us,” Clint agrees, spreading his hands apart in a ‘Ta da!’ kind of motion.  “At least you know what you’re signing up for.”
“The best Keurig money can buy,” Tony agrees.
It’s two months after that that Rumlow snaps his fingers in front of Steve’s face sharply.
Steve quiets Tony with a shake of his head. “I don’t need you to apologize,” Steve says. “Right now, all I really want is to go to bed. It’d be nice if you were there, but if you’re busy murdering a robot that’s okay, too.”
Steve's not even mad.  He deserves it.
“Wow,” Tony says.  “Senior year was a good year for you.”
“I don’t know,” Steve says. “You seem pretty popular with your team.”
Tony knows, and believes, that Clint and Bucky and Steve don’t mean him any harm. But things are getting weird. And... well, their friendship is sort of convenient for kidnapping or murdering him, now that he thinks about it...
The next morning, James is still waffling on hairstyles while Bruce cooks breakfast.  Clint shows up as soon as the smell of bacon fills the air, and James ignores them both as he taps away at the laptop.  Since the screen is facing the kitchen, it’s hard for Bruce not to notice that James keeps switching between tabs: some that are pictures of random men with short hair and some that are most definitely pictures of Bucky Barnes circa 1940 something.
Tonight, Bruce has come over to cook something spicy and colorful in Steve’s small kitchen.  Usually on these nights, Bruce brings books, too, about the places he’s been and the things he’s seen. (Bruce has no personal photographs of these places, since he hadn’t been running around with a camera.)  (Plus, you know, Hulk smash.) They look through the pictures in the books together, and Bruce weaves them all into an incredible narrative.
“Looks can be deceiving,” Steve says.  “But in my case I grew out of it.  Mostly.  When I was a kid, I never met a bully I didn’t think needed a punch in the face.  I was small so there were a lot of bullies.”
“Later,” Steve says.
“Howard made you tough them out?” Steve guesses.
“You’re welcome.”
Steve rolls over to glance at the clock.  9:37 AM.  He’s been asleep for less than an hour.
“Don’t,” Steve says. “I don’t want to hear you talk about yourself like that. I just want an explanation. A real explanation.”
“You think I don’t know how to track the direction of a bullet?  You shot me, ass!”
There’s no two ways about it, Steve’s depressed.  Google told him so.  JARVIS told him so too, when he asked for the AI’s opinion.
“You wouldn’t believe how much I want to help you with that right now,” Steve complains.
(Seen 10:02 AM)
“I don’t get why we can’t take an uber,” Steve says, finally opening the door and taking a seat in what might as well be a clown car for as well as it fits either of them.
“I did,” Steve agrees.  “I don’t know how he was later in life, but when I knew him he was loyal, brave, a total smart ass, and he never treated me like some kind of national treasure.  Exactly the kind of person I wanted to be around.
Hammer and Stane are thoroughly fucked.
Steve can’t even begin to figure out how all these bruises could relate to sex.  It looks more like Tony volunteered to be the punching bag in a gym somewhere.  Or joined a Fight Club.
him for dragging him into saving the life of the man who murdered his parents.
Steve rolls himself closer to Tony and leans in to kiss his shoulder.
He takes a deep breath, then shifts in his seat so he can look at Tony.
“But not from me,” Steve insists. “I can’t stop you from feeling insecure, sweetheart. I can be more aware of how situations might look, though. And I can make sure I check in more often. How you interpret things... that’s up to you.”
The sound reverberates in Tony’s ears as loud as the answering roar. Steve caught the puck. The game is lost. It’s over.
“I know it’s weird,” Tony says.  “Do you ever go and visit her?”
It’s not really a matter of trust. Tony trusts them as much as he trusts anyone these days. It’s just... and he’s not going to say this part out loud... they’re desk staff. He’s not sure what a trio of translators, a Photoshop expert and two security strategists think they’re going to do other than hide him, and Tony has a few safe houses that are off the books. He can do that for himself.
“I want it cut. I want--” It’s painful to listen to James drown in the effort of words. “I want it shorter. It’s always in my face. Tactical disadvantage.”
“I’ve got this,” Steve says.  “We’ll be out of your hair in a minute.”
He leans heavily against Steve and Steve turns him so he can hug his boyfriend-- fiance-- close.
Steve lets Tony go.
“Shit. Not-- I mean, that wasn’t... the crack about the Kiss Cam. I’m not gay for you or anything. I didn’t come back here for that,” Steve rambles.
“You boys are up next,” Natasha says, pointing to Tony and Steve.
Well shit.  Tony’s got absolutely no idea what to say to that.  Thankfully, Bucky plows on.
Tony takes all that in. “Okay,” he says. “What about you? What classified stuff was Clint talking about?”
“Not picky, remember,” Tony says.  “Dealer’s choice.”
Tony shrugs.  “Well.  We know a god.”
“I’ll be back in New York tomorrow afternoon. You can see me then.”
“Thank you, ma’am,” Tony says politely.
1) The Big Gay Freakout of ‘88.
Sean’s drunk and maybe plain stupid, because he gives the table a shove toward Steve, and it topples over glasses and a few bottles as it comes to an abrupt stop at the wall that is Steve Rogers’ abs.
Steve stands.  “You want to take this outside?”
Tony doesn’t sound bitter.  Just sad.  Tired, maybe
When Stevewas outed in the press, his own team had been great. Supportive. Protective. Most of them had already known, so it wasn’t a surprise.
“If we’re going to be doing some walking, would you mind if I take a look at your injuries?” Bruce asks. “I think I can make some suggestions without needing to touch you, if that would make you more comfortable.”
Tony nods. “Okay. Whatever you want.”
“Are you calling my brains cow shit?” James asks.
“It doesn’t involve Tony either,” Clint adds. “Not until James can say whether or not he'll allow it.  Sorry, Tony-- that whole murdering your parents is a brain fuck, any way you turn it over.”
“Okay, fine,” Steve continues.  “I’m a little mad at him.  Bucky.  Fuck.  I mean James-- I know it’s not his fault and it’s completely unfair--”
Clint looks pleased by that thought then he frowns. “Neither did the Winter Soldier.”
“This is incredible.”
There’s a moment of silence before Tony speaks again. “Does that mean we can start now? I want to get a look at your arm before we start singing kumbaya.”
“But could you?” Natasha asks.  “Can this wait?”
“Bruce, buddy? Talk to me, big guy. I’m looking at these scans and we’ve got some work to do. I’m right here. Listen to my voice.  Focus on my words. You’ve got this, okay?  I know you, and you’ve got this.”
“You think Thor could help?” Steve asks.  He hadn’t even considered it.
“What?” Tony asks.  “Am I bleeding?”
“Of course, if that’s what you want,” Bruce says. “Before I go grab him though, let’s make a plan. Even if you’ve agreed to letting him in, that doesn’t mean he gets to stay as long as he wants. He gets to stay as long as
“It’s potting soil, Nanna,” Clint explains earnestly, with an absolute shit-eating grin aimed in Bucky’s direction.  “Bucky shoved him into the trunk of a car.”
See what you've done??? <3
“You mentioned that,” Bruce says. “I’m going to guess since they were freezing and thawing you, they were giving you liquid nourishment? Solids could pose a logistical problem to that process. Obstructions and ice damage would be trouble throughout your digestive track.”  He looks to James for clarification.
“You mean the same sort of low-lifes who flock to him now?” Steve guesses. “Avengers and present company excluded.”
Steve chuckles.  “I think one is plenty.”
“I’m not going to transfer you to the bed just yet,” Bruce says. “I’m not sure I can do it without causing more damage, so you’re stuck on this thing until I’ve got that figured out. Is that okay?”
“I recall that conversation, yes,” Tony confirms.
“Seems like we all are,” Clint agrees.
in with the team,” Clint says, plating up some extra crispy... ham? Turkey? Bruce isn’t sure. He also isn’t picky, so he has no room to complain either. “Figured protein would go further for breakfast,” Clint explains. “It’s a 4 hour hike to our new place, unless we want to steal a car.”
“You broke Clint’s arm,” Clint counters. “You didn’t break Clint. Anyway, Bruce is the mother hen of this outfit. Don’t take that from him.”
“Yesterday,” Bruce nods. “Curiosity got the better of me.”
Steve hops on the next SHIELD jet west.
“One bacon cheeseburger, hold the onions, a large fry and a large Iron Man shake, coming right up,” she rattles off.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I need a taste tester,” Tony shrugs.
“I--” Steve cuts himself off before he blurts out
“That’s great news,” Steve says as he lets him go.
The entire table shifts under Clint’s weight and everyone grabs for their drinks simultaneously, which leaves no hands available for stopping the half-full platter of fries from pitching forward.  It slides to the ground with a crash.
“I’m a lot of things, Cap.  Cheater ain’t one.”
“What intel?” James asks.
Which makes James roll his eyes. Actually roll them, like he’s thirteen and Bruce is a particularly annoying parental figure.
“Um... yes?” Sam asks.  “Are you serious?  I can’t tell.  Is this some kind of billionaire version of punked?”  He glances around the room as if looking for a camera crew.
“I’m Clinton Francis Barton, I’m 31 years old, and  I like long walks on the beach, archery practice, and giving the best blow jobs in the city.  My perfect man would be--”
“It’s not like I’d have really done it,” Steve says.
want to be the shitty ex?” Clint demands.
He turns the screen toward them to show them a picture that’s not Bucky Barnes but could definitely be his first cousin.
“I wish I could have met them,” Steve says.
“He was.  About people and about other things too.  He was really interested in science.  Always dragged me to every Future-Fair and Science Expo that came to New York.  If he was here now-- the old Bucky I mean-- I bet you’d never pry him out of your lab.  He’d want to know how everything works and how it all fits together.”
Things have been better between Tony and Steve since that day in the tower.  Tony isn’t as hostile.  Steve isn’t as quick-tempered.  They work well as a team in the field.  Steve accompanies Tony on a Children’s Hospital visit one sunny spring day.  They stop for milkshakes after and Tony laughs until tears stream down his cheeks when Steve orders a large Iron Man to go along with his cheeseburger.
The holy shit has Bruce spinning around in alarm, since Clint’s not the most flappable guy around. But it’s nothing bad... just James. And James doesn’t even look particularly menacing. He’s standing there in plaid pajama bottoms and no shirt. The most intimidating part of him is his metal arm and his metal hand is clutching dirty clothes so not a gun at least.
“I taste it in my lungs,” James says, with such appalled finality that Clint laughs out loud.
“They’re all fakes,” Tony says.  “Everything at the museum is a replica.”
“Me picking up glass?  Yeah.”
“It’s stupid,” Steve says, stilling, as if he’s been caught doing something wrong.
Tony fumbles with the buckle to get himself free.  When it clicks open, he climbs out.   Steve checks to make sure there aren’t any cars coming then exits after him, because he’s not going to continue this conversation by shouting out the door.  As soon as Steve takes a step in his direction, Tony takes several steps back toward the car to keep it between them.
“Right every time,” Bruce says. “When you say you can’t feel anything, can you tell me more about that?”
“That’d be great,” Steve enthuses.  “It’s been so long since I felt like I knew what to do with myself. Thanks."  Steve pauses, then adds "If I keep thanking you for all this help, is it going to get annoying?”
Tony stares after Howard’s back as his father marches off. He knows Howard’s upset. Tony’s upset. But it’s the last straw in a series of last straws. He’s not waiting to make his announcement. He’s not wasting one more second of his life on the opinions of a man who does. not. care.
“I can take it from here,” Tony says, reaching out for his bag.
“Captain America as my bodyguard.  Tempting,” Tony says.  His eyes open.  “But no.”
Under the cracked table, a flicker of movement catches Tony’s eyes.  Clint’s fingerspelling two letters over and over. O and K?
“Only the classiest shit for our lover boys,” Bucky proclaims.
“I don’t,” Tony disagrees.  He does actually, but there probably
He’s a grown man. It doesn’t have to be like this. He can tell Howard to fuck off and he can apologize to Steve and maybe it’s not too late. Maybe.
James nods. He also takes a slow breath, bracing for something painful.
There’s a pause.  Steve speaks again.
“It was great,” Steve says slowly.  “I mean.  Except for the dialogue.  And the plot.  And the 42 minutes of my life I’m never getting back.”
“You’ll need to say your goodbyes in the lobby,” she tells them gently.
“None of those people are you,” Tony says.  “Anyway, this isn’t going to work.  Even if it’s what we both want, I’m tainted.  Used goods.  There’s nothing left.”
“It’s the best,” Steve agrees sarcastically.  Or well, it’s meant to be sarcasm though it comes out absurdly sincere.
“It was a guess,” Bruce offers. “Not even an educated one. Maybe wishful thinking on Steve’s behalf. He’s got friends out looking for you.”
“You’ll get no arguments from me,” Tony says.
“Absolutely,” Steve agrees.  “Take whatever you need.  All that’s on there are my old AP English essays, and no one-- and I mean no one-- wants to read my thoughts on Macbeth.”
Bruce turns the phone toward James so he can see the picture Tony sent. In the interest of trust, he’ll show him every text that comes through until James tells him it isn’t necessary. Maybe that show of trust is the push James needs, since that’s when he speaks.
“Out of the bath,” James calls from his place on the couch, as Bruce steps in the door after his phone call with Tony. When James sees Bruce, he gestures back toward the bathroom. “Barton is practicing his stealth.”
“I’ll buy the damn car.  We’re fine.”
Tony flexes his left hand a few times, like his fingers are aching.
“A video, huh?” Tony says. “Kinky.”
“Not that kind of recreation, grandpa.  The bruise is from my girlfriend. The physics professor I’ve been seeing?”
“Great.  Now you’re gonna get us
call you ordinary.”
“No,” Bruce says. He’s not afraid. “It’s important to me that I know you understand that all this is your choice,” Bruce says, figuring James can handle the honesty. “I-- I don’t have a medical history for you. I don’t know much about you, really. I’m afraid that people who’ve worked with your injuries before didn’t give you the option of telling them to fuck off.”
They fall into silence.  Steve isn’t sure where to go from here.  Howard’s presence still hovers over them like a cloud.  A shadowy unknown.  And it’s confusing because that’s so far removed from the Howard that Steve knew.  His Howard could brighten any room.
“Might be memories. I never fuckin’ know,” James grumbles.
“Whenever,” Tony says. “Her birthday isn’t for another few months and I promised her a new pair of skates I’ve been working on for that. This is a gift just because she’s awesome.”
if you want to read it!
turned on by the thought of you as a kept man.”
“I’m not suggesting that it is,” Dr. Gerber says patiently.
Steve shakes his head.  “It won’t work.  It looks too much like we’re setting a trap.”
“Do you know where they’re taking us?” Tony asks.
“No, you know what?” Tony asks, taking a step away from the woman. “I’m not going to be in your picture, because you’re right. I’m a shitty role model. If I had kids I’d hope they weren’t anything like me. But Rogers, here? He’s a good man. And I’m not sure what crawled up everyone’s collective asses and died but--”
It’s calming.  Peaceful.  It makes Steve realize how much he could use some sleep, too.  He just needs to recycle first, take a quick shower, and then hope like hell he can pass out on his pillow before the guilt of the day catches up with him.
“Thanks, doc,” Clint says. “If you run again... you should let me have your back. I’ll be bad ass with finger rockets.”
“If you’re the sort of person who’s noticing all this, I think it’s a good sign for what kind of person you are. I can’t say I’m the best judge, though. By any standard, if I was a decent person I’d figure out a way to kill myself. I even tried once, but it didn’t take.”
“Sorry, Nanna,” Clint apologizes.  “I learned that word from Steve.”
“What the fuck?” Bruce choked out.
Steve throws the newspaper back in the trash and goes to the sink to wash his hands. A look at the clock tells him he has a half an hour before he needs to leave for the Hockey for the Heart event. He should probably shower, shave and get dressed.
“I don’t think it’s stupid,” Steve says. “I think I’ll probably mangle it, and pick all the wrong words and it’s not going to be smooth but I’ll try. Whatever it takes.”
The room itself is large and airy.  The wallpaper is a little garish with faded clowns lining the ceiling, and the carpet is a worn, seventies orange.  But none of that is what’s got them both out for revenge.  It’s the twin bunk bed that’s sitting off to the side, undersized for Tony and practically a toy bed for Steve.
Tony pulls back and Steve lets go.  Tony’s warmth lingers on Steve’s hands and forearms.  They meet eyes and Steve gives him a nod of promise.
"I'll get right on that," Tony says.
“The fire extinguisher is in the basement,” Nanna says.  “I’ll go find it.”
Good speech. Made me proud. See you tomorrow?
“Didn’t I fire you?” Stane asks, as he rises from the floor and glares at Clint.
“All correct,” Bruce says, feeling a lot more calm. He has an idea about what’s going on but wants to confirm it a little before he discusses it with James. “May I touch between your knee and ankle?”
“I’ll just sit here and look pretty,” Clint says. “Worry about James, Doc.”
I don’t know what I’m looking at.
“You do realize it’s going to be my ringtone from now on, right?” Tony asks.  “That’s what you’re getting into with this.  With... me.”
,” Jenny says as she nods.  “He had the roof off the Jeep. Everyone could hear.”
Clint isn’t fragile like James, but he’s got his own issues. Bruce keeps his voice calm.
“He comes over and cooks for me sometimes,” Steve explains.  “As a friend.”
“Captain America isn’t real,” Steve says.  “If they want to say Steve Rogers is gay then they can go right ahead and say it.  I don’t advertise, but I’m not ashamed.”
Steve and Tony laugh all the way back to New York.
“You sure?” Steve asks.
Steve knows this isn’t like that.  It’s not the same.  This is absolutely a good thing.  It still aches like a loss somehow, because feelings are hard and Steve’s don’t always work right.  Tony isn’t the only one who’s broken.
Art by
Steve hits send and that’s the end of it. He can see that Tony saw the message, but there’s no reply.
Bruce laughs at the ridiculousness of that statement, particularly because he knows that Clint knows a hell of a lot more about human anatomy than he lets on.
“Pardon?” Bruce asks.
“My doctors think I’m ready. I think I’m ready. I want to go home,” Tony says.
“You wanna blow this popsicle stand?” Tony asks. “I’ve got a car here, and I swear I haven’t had anything stronger than a water with lime.”
“Who’s ‘on your left’ now?” Sam demands, throwing up his arms in triumph.
“J-- I need you to find me a rehab.  Somewhere I can start in the morning.  Out of the city but still in New York.”  Tony says it all in a rush, as if he thinks he’ll change his mind if he doesn’t get it all out at once.
“No one’s locking you up,” Steve says quietly.  “I’m here to take you home.”
“Don’t be offended if it takes me a night or two to get comfortable.  Sometimes mattresses still feel too soft.”
Bruce thinks about that for a second. “Neither did I.”
Knowing all that doesn't make the experience of spending time with Tony any less surreal.
“Order it all,” Tony repeats. “This from Captain ‘Rinse-That-Plastic-Fork-Because-We-Might-Use-It-Again’ Rogers? It seems a little wasteful.”
“I like you,” Tony says.  “You’re terrible.”
"I wasn't sure if you wanted to see me or if you wanted your space," Steve explains, searching for an answer. "It’s good to see you though, James. I'm glad you're alright."
“He was just being nice,” Steve deflects.
Bruce groans. “I vote we don't make any decisions regarding an unqualified doctor until everyone is off their pain meds."
For the first time Nanna seems to realize there’s a fourth person at the door.
“You don’t know?  I figured you’d look us all up the first chance you got,” Steve says.
the plan,” Tony objects.  “I’m just trying to figure out if I need a ride home.  I’m not going to beg you to stay.  I already said you could take the car.”
“I know,” Tony says.  “And I appreciate it.  But if you’ll let me have this, I’ll keep working on the rest.  And I’m not ever going to doubt your intentions.  Your sanity, sure, but not your intentions.”
Bruce really isn’t sure where else this will go and the staring contest going on between them only seems to agitate things. Bruce reaches slowly for his backpack and pulls a StarkBar out of a side pouch. StarkBars aren’t technically a thing yet, so much as a side project that Bruce had been working on before he left. On the run they’d been a lifesaver. When Bruce gets back, he and Tony are going to revolutionize food aid.
Steve fights the urge to ask for more in depth information.  Tony’s being as open as he can, and they’ve got all the time in the world; Steve doesn’t need every question answered tonight.
The silence turns into something heavy and almost palpable as Steve drives Tony the rest of the way to his new temporary home.   It’s been awhile since Steve has prayed.  Old habits die hard apparently because he finds himself doing it without really meaning to.
“You’re giving me a lot of credit.”
“No shit,” James scowls. “It’s something else. It’s...” He trails off with an annoyed huff, like the words have wronged him somehow.
When he does get up, he dresses in slightly warmer clothes for their hike to who-knows-where, and walks out to see what’s for breakfast. James is sitting at the table, typing on Clint’s computer while Clint narrates his own cooking like he’s on Food Network.
Tony feels sick.  He is turning down one of the hottest men he’s spoken to in years.   Steve wants him.  Now Tony has to ruin everything.
“Everything okay?” Steve asks.
“Bruce told me about the neural feedback you've been experiencing,” Tony says. “A brain scan would help us figure out if that’s because of something in the lower wiring or up there in your head. You up for one more quick test before we cart this stuff out?”
“Neural activity looks good,” Bruce says. “Heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation are all within range. At this point he’s probably doing better than you are.”
Tony nods.  He’s pretty sure he’s okay.  “I’m alive.”
“A backseat o’ boring?” Clint asks.
“I’m messing with you, Bruce,” James says.
It turns out the stocks are from the year Stark Industries was founded and they are worth a whole lot of money.  More money than all of Steve’s back pay combined.  More money than Steve’s conceivable pay in the near future unless he lives for a couple hundred years.  It feels wrong to take that much.  Undeserved.
Steve doesn’t pull away until Tony’s almost breathless and then it’s only to whisper one word.  “Deal.”
“I’d date him,” Clint says.  “But I don’t go down for anything less than HBO.  What about you, Nat?  After watching what happened between him and Pepper, would you date Stark?”
“Are you okay if I let everyone know what you’ve agreed to?” Bruce asks.
And as long as Bruce keeps texting, Tony’s not alone.
Steve heads straight for the workshop when he gets back to the tower. Tony’s ripping the guts out of a circuit box like it personally wronged him. He studiously ignores Steve.
James turns his head to look at Clint.  “But I followed them.”
Steve walks over and picks Tony up carefully.  Tony goes limp against Steve’s chest and blinks his eyes open for a few seconds before closing them again resignedly.
Tony kind of understands. The bathroom might be in the hall. Or the bathroom might be dying. The only thing Tony is sure about is not wanting to wet Steve’s bed on the first night he’s ever spent in it. That is not the good kind of kinky.
That’s it though.
“You know you love me,” Tony’s voice echoes loudly from nowhere.  “It.  You love it.  When I’m an ass.”
Bruce gets it though.
Tony goes quiet again.  Steve glances over occasionally and he can see Tony thinking.  Puzzling something out.  Tony’s finger moves erratically like he’s writing on an invisible StarkPad and he has that ‘I’m sciencing’ look on his face.
“You should do exactly what you were doing before Hawkeye took a dump on your good deed,” he says.
Tony collapses next to Steve at the center of the rink and enjoys the chill from the ice below him. He’s sweaty and gross and still wearing a few parts of his fundraiser suit underneath his hockey gear. It’s great.
His brain isn’t going to let a ‘blame Tony’ moment go unchecked.  Blame Tony seems to be the default for SHIELD, even though Tony’s been gone for 6 damn months.
Not because he’ll win.  It’s not a kitchen sink in his bag, it’s the industrial grade toolbox he keeps his art supplies in for travel, but well-- if losing means he gets to take Tony out for a burger and fries when all this is over... (as long as this doesn’t all blow up in their faces)
“Sir,” JARVIS’s voice over-rides the music Tony’s got turned up in his office.  His thoughts and the volume drop to simultaneous, eerie silence.  “There is an emergency in Switzerland.  Dr. Banner requires assistance and an emergency evacuation.  I am assisting him now.”
The overhead lights flicker as Tony and Steve walk down the stairs.  Tony can see why right away, when Steve leads him into the dining room and Clint and Bucky are seated at a dining room table that’s been turned into a makeshift security command center.  They’ve got mangled together tech all around them.  Half of it looks like stuff that would have been ancient ten years previous, and some of it Tony thinks ought to be in the Smithsonian.  There are three laptops held together with bread ties, shoelaces and duct tape.  There’s a giant satellite phone, and what might be an ultra old-school global positioning system.  All the devices are plugged into the same two outlets.  Those outlets are humming ominously.  Occasionally there’s a spark.
“I was more thinking you could let me massage your hand,” Steve suggests.
“I have a few times,” Steve says.  “Not often because I think it upsets her.  Was she happy when you were young?
“Busy,” Tony says.  “You’re lucky you caught me.  I’ve been in Malibu.  Am going
“Your nanna lives on Sesame Street?” Tony asks Bucky.
Something’s not right and I think it might kill him, supersoldier or not.  I’m really worried and I don’t want to fuck it up.
Yeah, well fuck him what’s he going to do to my career?
Steve smiles.   One fence is mended.  Only a couple hundred left to go.
“Very,” Tony says.  “I’d go and stay with her and her family sometimes over the summer.  They’d take me to the beach or to science museums.  I always felt like they wanted me around.  It was good.”
Tony places a mug in front of Steve. “I’ve got a car coming for you in half an hour. I’d have taken you home myself but I’ve got company coming.”
Which is a shame, cause being within a stone’s throw of Tony is way better than being alone.
“I have found the video you’re referencing.  Sir was highly inebriated and I do not believe his initial consent would be considered valid by a court of law.  Even if it was, he revokes that consent within minutes and continues to revoke it to the end.  However, I have standing instructions not to alert the police when I detect criminal activity of this nature.”
“Nothing yet.  I just got a text from Clint,” Natasha says.  “You said you wanted updates.”
“Awwwww, stew,” Clint complains in a quiet voice. “No fair. Next time I get that drunk I’m coming back to your place. You can both be the big spoons.”
“Barnes, get a leash on your creeper boyfriend,” Tony complains.
The paparazzi outside the fundraiser end up exhausting Steve before he makes it inside, and once he’s in there, he spends another hour shaking hands with half the city.  By the time he gets his plate from the buffet and loads it up, he’s just looking for a quiet place to sit down and recover.  He’s pointed toward a VIP table by a helpful woman in a server’s uniform and he takes the seat labeled with his name.  It isn’t long before Tony and his guest take the seats across from him.
“Good to see you awake, James,” Clint says, grinning down at them. “You gave us a scare.”
It’s like a party at rehab the next day.
“You didn’t kill Steve,” Bruce says carefully. He wants to tread lightly here, since he imagines the soldier’s conditioning makes a failure unacceptable. “You rewrote your mission. That’s... it’s incredible, honestly.”
When the soldier steps fully into the barn he isn’t what Bruce was expecting. He’s limping ever so slightly. He looks miserably tired. And when he speaks his voice is scratchy and unexpectedly hesitant. Like English doesn’t come as easily as it should.
“I remember her,” Steve confirms. “I had the biggest crush on Boop when we first met. She was a beautiful person, inside and out. And one of my first friends in the USO.”
Which seems inauspicious, to say the least.
"And here I thought it was because Tony’s always sneaking in pointy things to poke you with on stage," Steve comments.
“Did it?” Tony asks.
“They weren’t your equals,” Steve objects.  “Sean and Shayla and the rest of them were so far beneath you they might as well have been worms.  And Pepper wasn’t an asshole.”
“Sirs, I am sorry to interrupt,” JARVIS speaks in stereo from all around the roof, “but the quinjet is incoming.  You have two minutes to leave the landing area.”
“Is that a .38M Leoreuchek?” Tony asks in wonder.
“Oh no.  Not at all,” Tony assures him, as he climbs out of the driver's seat.  “You should hear Rhodey when he gets going.  One time we got in a car in Malibu and we made it all the way to Vegas on just one rant,” Tony says fondly.
Brooklyn.”
Pepper’s going to murder him, but he’s a grown up.  He can do what he wants.  And not tell her.
“Sap,” Tony accuses, elbowing Steve lightly in the ribs. The soft smile on Tony’s face chases away any semblance of an insult.
"That hurts me, Kate," Clint says.  "Here."  He flexes a muscle as he points at his own heart.
“Always,” Tony agrees.
One glance at his phone stops Steve in his tracks.
PS tell Barton the next time he invites me for a slumber party at a house with multiple killers and zero alcohol or coffee, I’m cancelling his All You Can Eat card at SoupSoupSoup.
“We’ll land soon,” Steve soothes.  “You’re safe.  I’m here.”
Tony lets out a groan.  “Ughhhhhyessss I know.  Can you not talk about us breaking up right now?  It’s all I’ve thought about for three days.  How that’s exactly what I’d deserve.  Karma for lying to Pepper.”
“You thought the two tight-lip-super-spies and the man with the big, green secret were going to out you?  Bad plan, Rogers.”
“Must be nice to have a supersoldier metabolism,” Tony grumbles under his breath as Steve beings unwrapping breakfast.
“You’re very welcome.  I live to serve.”
“You are so hot,” Tony says.  Which is probably a mixed signal, now that he thinks about it.  “And so off limits.  I’m sorry.  Gods, I am so sorry.  If you didn’t work at SI we’d be in a taxi already, headed for my place.  I just... I can’t.  I’m your boss and there are... reasons... I’ve been told there are very good reasons.”
“We’re in the trunk of a car that smells like a cemetery,” Steve says. “I’d probably be more concerned if you weren’t freaking out. Maybe we can start over?”
“If I told you, I’d have to kill you,” Clint says.
to put out their hit on me.  Look at this.”
Sounds like you’re looking for a rematch.
“That’s our cue,” Steve says.  “We should have plenty of time to get down the hill on one of the side roads before they get this far.”
Steve pauses.  Tony knows he knows about Pepper.   Which in this context make zero sense.
Tony has never known a time when he’d worried about the cost of fries, but he nods.  At least Bruce is looking equally clueless.  Clint moves to catch back up with Bucky and it leaves Bruce and Tony to bring up the rear.
Except that’s not true. If he were popular, at least one of the assholes on his team would have bothered to call him or check in with him since his suspension. But no one had. No one cares that he’s gone, and if they do care at all, it’s just because they’re pissed they’ve lost a star player. It isn’t about Tony.
The rest of the night passes far too quickly.  Tony and Steve are maybe flirting but it's so far removed from Tony's usual experience he's not 100% sure that's what's happening.  It's nice though, whatever it is.
“When I give him something better to do with his mouth, he does,” Sean says.
Steve tilts his head in curiousity and the kid looks down. “My name’s Steven. After my father. After his father. All named for you.”
(See the end of the chapter for
It’s all he can do not to take off running for Clint’s place. It’s like the very first hour he was Captain America. Like taking that first breath, with lungs that worked into a body that finally reflected on the outside what Steve had daydreamed about his whole childhood.
Natasha comes back to New York a few days later. She and Clint meet Steve at their diner, and that’s where he tells them about an idea he had on the drive back from rehab.
“What?” Tony asks.
"I'm a lot of things,” Clint begins again, “but mostly I'm the guy who’s been straight up creeping on Bruce for the last 6 weeks. Not you know... sexually. Just. Protectively.”
When he sees the streak of red and gold above them, he’s not sure he has ever been more glad to see Tony.
If you loved TCYK just the way it was, thank you SO MUCH for reading it and know that it still stands all by itself.  These are two completely different universes, but about half the content is the same!  The other half is all new!!!
“Sorry,” Steve amends.  “This is your tower.  You can go where you want.”
“That’s complicated,” Bruce says. “He’s not ready to see you, yet. When he’s ready he says he’ll find you.  Please don’t ask Tony for our location.  I don’t want to put him in the middle of this.”
“Oh Phase 2 is absolutely a go,” Tony agrees.  “We’ve got answers.  We’ve got so many answers, right down to why they chose
A few minutes later the water shuts off.  There’s more rustling and some muted thumps.  Eventually the door opens, and Tony’s leaning against the doorframe for support, with the towel wrapped around his waist.  He’s angled himself deliberately so his chest is turned away from Steve.
“I mean it.  Listening to you talk about the things you’re passionate about?  I feel like you could have kept all of us mesmerized for hours.  Science talk was all the rage back then.  Or we were giant nerds.  Could have been that, too.  Probably a mix of both.”
“Negative.  Flight commands can only be issued through the physical controls on board.  They have removed remote override.”
Steve, who had hurled plates at the roof and dissolved them into dust because he trusted that even Tony's more batshit ideas could still be good ones.
Both parties shall notify Stark Industries Human Resources Department if the status of their relationship changes by way of parting, or by marriage.
“Is crime often associated with human friendship?” Jarvis asks.
There’s really not much he wants to do less, but if he’s going to prove to the world that he’s got his shit together, this is what it’s going to take.
“You want me to head back in?” Tony asks.
Steve’s touched they’re willing to do that for him and Bruce.  It’s going to make life a hell of a lot easier once Tony’s home.
“You should ask Tony,” Bruce says.  “I avoid the unfiltered internet as much as possible.  Comments aren’t good for my calm.”
“I’ll cook with you,” Steve offers. “I could be the person you’re teaching. If you want to do it.”
“Because that’s not my idea. No sex tapes. I’ve had enough sex tapes for a lifetime.”
A part of Bruce wants to step in. To spare Tony from this pain when he hears the stress in his friend’s voice. Except Tony is a big boy. He knows how to walk out a door if being near James is too much. Bruce glances back down at his StarkPad, checks over the readings JARVIS has taken over the last 11 hours and doesn’t interfere. From the chair in the corner, Clint seems incredibly interested in his gun.
“Your dad will be there. And Obadiah. They’ll keep the press away.”
“You know Steve Rogers,” the soldier says, and it’s almost a question. There’s room for denial, if Bruce has any reason to deny it. He doesn’t.
“Phil is dead,” Clint cuts him off sharply. “I don’t know who SHIELD has running around with his face. The real Phil Coulson never would have left me to deal with that shit on my own.”
Tony’s laugh is off pitch and angry.  “Ummm.  No?  No, not a problem, just wondering why the fuck you never told me,” he says.  “I thought... I thought you disapproved.  All this time.  Thought you... you hated me for it.  Howard’s son.  Gay.  A disgrace to his memory.  You were one more person for me to disappoint.”
“Everything and more.”  Tony laughs against him, and presses a kiss to Steve’s shoulder.  “Dr. Gerber’s going to shit himself.”
“I suck,” Tony says helplessly. “Really. That’s the explanation. I wish I had something better for you, I really do. I just-- I didn’t want to take you down with me. And I knew-- I knew I was going down. I knew that’s where we were going.”
“Mr. Stark?” the security guard asks incredulously, with all the rebuke a native New Yorker can manage in just two words.  “As in Tony Stark?  You got an appointment?”
Steve turns a playful glare on him. “And this is Tony Stark. Which I’m sure you already know. Do you want to say hello, Tony?”
“Thanks, J.”
“What can I say?” Tony’s eyes sweep over Steve. “I’m into antiques, lately.”
Steve feels a wave of relief.  Bucky hasn’t run off again.  And he hasn’t killed either Bruce or Clint, so that’s good news.
“Not a big fan of that myself,” Tony agrees. “But it’s just the watching you don’t want to do, right? Any problem with playing?”
Turns out, fate takes matters into her own hands.
“Five hours ago they weren’t finished.  JARVIS and the bots have been busy bees.”
“Say it anyway.”
James looks skeptical.
Tony has J order Indian, and dinner is served at 6.
Bucky pops the trunk.
“I’ll pack up lunch,” he agrees.
“Maple syrup.  Got it,” Steve confirms.  “Thank you for the science lesson.  That was great.”
“Huh.  Superman has kryptonite, Captain America has chlorophyll.  You super-beings and your weird-ass weaknesses,” Tony notes as he walks to the fridge to pull out a bottle of water.  He tosses it to Steve.  “That might be more your speed, Yankee Doodle.”
It makes Steve’s stomach churn to see Tony look at him the way he is looking at him now.  The same way he’d looked at Jonathan after he’d been hit.  He’s waiting for a punch.  Steve wishes they had Tony’s Iron Man suit with them just to give Tony somewhere to hide.  Some way to feel protected.
“It’s just me and you under this tree, and some friends over on the porch,” Bruce says. “I’m Bruce Banner. You came to find me. Do you remember that?”
“You were watching,” Tony says.
“Is it Pep?” Tony asks.  “If you want in her skirt I wouldn’t blame you, but you should know I don’t think you have the kind of money it takes to keep her in the manner she’s accustomed.”
“Let me see what you’ve got so far,” she says instead.
“Or we could scan you now,” Bruce says. “If that’s what you’d prefer?”
He’s noticed the way Tony keeps running his fingers over things (the kitchen counter, the knobs on the bathroom sink, the books on the nightstand) like he never expected to see any of it again.
“This isn’t Clint’s fault,” Bruce insists.
“Okay.”
“That’s my mistake,” Bruce says easily. “And for what it’s worth, I wish I could’ve been more help after New York. It took me some time to get my footing. Things were... tense...”
Bruce makes a face, still not entirely sure the archer isn’t plotting to give him a mohawk just so Clint can go around saying mo-hulk for a month. But James nods.
“Right.  A momentary lapse--”
“I’m not a therapist,” Bruce explains. “It’s a miracle I haven’t messed you up yet, James. When we get settled somewhere you’re going to need to see someone who knows what they’re doing, if you’re willing. And I think, if Steve will take the suggestion, he should, too.”
“No hard feelings here, either,” Natasha says, tapping at her lower left stomach, where Bruce knows at one point she was shot. “Most of us have been used. We don’t ask for apologies or explanations.”
“No,” Steve says emphatically.  “If I had issues with his performance on the team I’d talk to him.  In person.  Alone.”
“I need you,” Steve says. “Please.”
“Eww.  Gross,” Tony scoffs.  “Get your brain out of the gutter, Rogers.  This isn't a high school kink.  Just.  I like this shirt.  And you can’t have it back.  It’s mine forever.  For infinity.  I’m not sure you’ll understand how serious I am about keeping this shirt until I die and have myself buried in it.”
For some reason that makes Tony laugh.
“Steve, you wanna get the shovels?” Tony asks.
“May I touch your hand?” Bruce asks.
Tony’s scared.  Steve knows this, because Tony can’t keep from fiddling with the worry-ball he’s holding and he keeps having to ask for things to be repeated because his attention is firmly elsewhere
“Clint and me are on uniform procurement then,” Bucky says.  “Steve, get them IDs.  The printers in the shed can handle whatever we need.”
It’s a Saturday morning, two days after one of these fights, when Bruce texts Steve to ask if they can get lunch. They meet at the diner and chat about the usual things until their food arrives. Steve only learns why Bruce has asked him to meet when Bruce pulls out a crumpled envelope and taps it on the table.
"I don't."
“JARVIS is in my earpiece so I’m all caught up,” Sam says, handing Bruce the gauze and showing him where he wants him to hold it. “Can you apply pressure here? We’re going to slow the blood, get him on a stretcher, then get him on the plane. One, two, three, easy as that.”
Tony’s smile broadens and he laughs so hard he ends up leaning against Steve to keep his balance.
“Eh, if I stopped hanging out with people who I’m 100% sure won’t kill me I’d be down to my dog... and maybe Steve. Maybe.” Clint gives it a second more of thought then shrugs. “I guess that’s all to say, I’m not too worried. I know you’ve got my back. What’s he like?”
His eyes fill with tears, and he half expects Tony to mock him for it but Tony’s looking a little misty-eyed too.
“Sir is in his suite,” JARVIS says.  And yeah, it’s a British Robot Voice, but Steve feels like he senses worry there.
“A generous billionaire,” Natasha adds, “who hands out cars like candy.”
Oh. Okay. Are you home?
“The damage to your knee is internal,” Bruce says, keeping to simple terms to try and help James identify with the words and put together that his knee belongs to him. “Your knee is bruised and swollen. I’d like to press there gently to see if I can tell what’s going on. Is that okay?”
That gets the table quiet.
I could scan him 100 times it won’t change my interpretation.  All I see are wires wrapped up in more wires.  Can you do the scan?  Then you can zoom in on what’s important.
“We called it fucking,” Steve says.  “And by the time your dad and I were friends I was already interested in someone else.  Howard knew my preferences and he helped me sneak around but that was the extent of it.  He never told you about any of this?”
Steve’s about to toss it when Tony steps in front of him.
“In case you were too drunk to remember,” Pepper continues.  “The winner gets to choose where you celebrate the win and also go by “Winner” on comms for a month, if they so choose.”
*crack*
“Hey, you know that big tree thing in the corner of your office?” Bucky asks, seamlessly inserting himself into the conversation.  “That was all me.  Now no one can get sight-lines on you from the Oscorp Tower.”
The evening wears on and champagne is passed around like water, and it’s not even 9 PM and most of the table is drunk.  Tony’s finally talking, and it’s about hydraulics and pneumatics and how they relate to some race-car Tony’s built, and he’s excited.  Really excited, judging by the expressive way his hands move and the smile that finally reaches his eyes.  Tony’s discussing a type of science Steve understands and even though Steve’s not part of the conversation he’s fascinated.  He wishes he could see Tony like this more often: happy and unguarded.
“Look, I can explain. It’s not what it looks like.”
“You know, if you set the house on fire and I die, that kind of negates the part where you’re trying to keep me alive,” Tony comments.
He can feel that his cheeks have gone warm.  Steve Rogers is troll enough to make him blush.  Tony is such a goner.
“You already love me forever,” Bucky says, handing over a thermos he pulls from his messenger bag.  He turns his eyes to Tony and uses a flirtatious drawl when he speaks.  “Whatever Clint did, I’m sure he’s very sorry.”
“Yes,” the soldier replies. “I kill. That’s what I do.” He says the words in a different voice. It’s recitation. Rote learning.
“Well-- it’d be uncomfortable,” Steve begins.  These are explanations that don’t come easily to him.  He doesn’t like to complain.  Doesn’t like for other people to notice his pain.  He spent long enough under medical scrutiny as a kid to resent it as an adult.  “Healing wears me out so I need more rest. I need more food, too. That’s about it.”
Bruce is apologetic in both tone and manner as James freezes. It hadn’t occurred to Bruce when he’d asked that James would know quite that level of detail.
When the trunk opens and Tony sits up, he has to blink a few times for his eyes to adjust to the bright light of day.
“They were
Tony bites back a soft noise of pleasure and Steve mumbles something quietly to himself.
“We’re the good guys here,” Steve says. “And you do still have your gun, right? I don’t want you to feel like we’ve got you here against your will. You have my permission to shoot me if I suddenly get all... nefarious.”
Three minutes later it’s a huge relief when Clint strolls in from outside, alive and well.
There really is something incredibly weird going on with this family, but since at this point they are allowing Tony to be a part of it, he isn’t going to complain.  When he and Steve finally get some time alone though, Tony is going to have his explanation.
Curiosity kills cats. Turns out there are plenty of fates worse than death.
He’d made the wrong choice. He should have pushed about the trigger. Clint could have died because of Bruce’s inadequacies. How would he even explain that?
Bucky pulls more coffee cups out of the carrying container on Clint’s desk.
“Yeah, obviously,” Bucky says.
“I’m bi,” Tony says. “It’s just never come up in the news because before I even think of asking a man back to my hotel room he’s got to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement that would give Rumplestiltskin a hard-on. I’m pretty sure they’d owe me their firstborn child or something if they broke it. I’ve never actually read it beginning to end, but since my PA, Pepper, put it together I’m gonna guess it’s brutal.”
“That’s SHIELD,” Steve tells Tony.
Tony’s phone dings again and this time he grabs for it like a lifeline.  He reads through Bruce’s housing request and he’s overwhelmed with relief.  The task is a distraction from the ugly place in Tony’s soul that had opened up six weeks ago and continues to fester on the daily.
“Yeah. Yes, everything is fine,” Bruce confirms. “Better than fine maybe. Ummm. I guess there’s no non-dramatic way to put this, so I’m just going to say it. I’m here with Clint and James. The James Barnes you’re looking for.”
“Teams?” Clint suggests.
“I’m sure we’ve got a fire extinguisher around here somewhere,” Steve pipes in.
He looks back at Steve (since throwing himself off the building is probably a little dramatic) and Steve’s fiddling with the strings of his hoodie and not making eye contact and looking vulnerable and sad.  In the six soul-sucking weeks they’ve spent in Bucky Barnes limbo, all the other times he’s seen Steve this somber it’s been on the video feed when Steve was alone.  In front of Natasha and Sam and Tony, Steve always stays strong.  But here, now, Steve’s letting that go.  The least Tony can do is give his question a shot.
It’s been weeks (months? years?) since Tony woke up feeling so rested.  Which is odd, since when he blinks open his eyes he’s on the couch.
“Fuck old ladies,” Tony whispers in return. “Get some octogenarian venereal disease. Pine for a hot young ass, like mine.”
Steve tries to school his features and fails epicly. Tony rolls his eyes but leans in against Steve, and stays there. It’s an awkward angle until Steve puts his arm around Tony, and then they fit together just right.
“Okay. You’re right,” Bruce sighs. “I’m just hoping he understands why we did what we did. He might have preferred us to let nature take its course.”
“I remember.” James sounds ever so slightly troubled.
“I pick Jenny,” Bucky says. “Unless you want to play on your Uncle Tony’s team? Wouldn’t blame you, kid.”
Steve looks away.  “I didn’t save them all.  We thought the building was clear.  It wasn’t.  And then the men who escaped went on to shoot up a town square in the next city over.  More people died.   Because of me.”
He takes a deep breath. “Be kind to others. Be kind to yourself. Learn to accept help.” Tony looks back at Steve. “That’s all I’ve got to say.”
“We’re not giving up,” Steve objects.
“Must be nice,” Steve says.
She raises a hand to silence any objections and then turns her back on them to strip down to just her bra and underwear, and then she glances back over her shoulder to glare at them until they look away.
Because there’s more than one.  Steve should have known.
Now it’s Tony’s turn to smile. “Assume away.”
I’m the best uncle ever. Thanks for that!
This art is by (and posted with the permission of) the super-talented
Steve greets anyone who stops by the table cheerfully and only drinks water no matter what he’s offered. He’s not going to go home with Tony, smelling like wine.
Yes, he likes talking about Steve.  Likes the way saying his name feels on his tongue.  Likes just thinking the word.  So okay, shit, yeah.  It’s obvious.
“Fuck, I-- want this.” Tony’s incoherent too.  His hands grab at Steve to drag him up, and when their faces are even, Tony presses up to kiss him hard.  Desperate.  He shifts to open his knees further, so Steve’s weight will pin him and force them closer.  “You’re everything I want.”
“I’ve never seen anything about him dating one on SportsCenter,” Steve says. “And experience tells me that’s the kind of thing ESPN likes to bring up.”
Tony’s fingers fly over his keyboard.  JARVIS helps, of course, and Tony finds Bruce the best house within the location parameters, and he’s careful not to choose anything so over the top that Bruce will regret ever making the request.
“Sorry about that,” Steve says. “Bucky thinks he’s funny.”
“Just hard enough to be obnoxious,” Bruce says.
There’s silence for a few seconds before Bruce speaks.  “Do you want me to come home?”
“I’m not lying,” Steve says, looking up at Tony with lustful eyes.  “You are gorgeous.  Perfect.  Incredible.”
Steve’s able to stand with no problem and he reaches down a hand to Tony to help him up.  Tony stares at Steve’s hand, then takes it.
“Perfect,” Steve says, as he rubs at the spot with his palm. When he pulls his hand away there’s a dark smudge.
(See the end of the chapter for
“This essay’s about The Potato Eaters,” Steve says.  “And it’s perfect.  It’s everything I’d say if I could put my thoughts to paper the way you can.  This is art interpretation at its
“You got a lot of those people?”
“We know,” Bruce says. “We’re glad he’s getting the help he needs.”
Steve looks down for a flicker of a second then back up again. This time with resolve in his eyes, like he knows what’s coming is going to be painful but he’ll face it anyway.
She’s twelve and like Tony always says: she’s his favorite. Smart, hilarious, full of sass, and hell on skates when she plays hockey. There are already college teams looking at her, and Tony couldn’t be prouder of that if Jenny was his own.
“It’s more the internet I have a problem with,” Steve says.  “Not my computer.”
“Later.”
Jarvis had been the one to track down this particular therapist.  He had his doctorate (which Jarvis felt might keep Tony from railroading the guy) and he was known for working with ex-child stars and professional athletes.  Apparently there wasn’t much he hadn’t seen before.  That would probably come in handy.
Bruce slings the strap of the duffel over his shoulder and approaches from the side. “Is the injury internal or external?”
“What?  No,” Tony says.  “Not... I mean, not like yes.  Not thinking about it seriously.  Just... thinking.  Of things.  Neutrally.”
Tony glances around the table and then looks back at Steve.  “I really am,” he agrees.  “So what does everyone else do?”
Tony chokes on a laugh.  “Don’t think I’m ever going to get used to Captain Potty Mouth.”
“No,” Steve says, then looks at the smoothie in his hands and he can’t help making a face.  “I’m not sure this is edible.”
“Not quite home yet, but I’m aiming that way.  Can you let Tony know?”
Rhodey makes another gesture that’s difficult for Steve to interpret.  Irritation, maybe, at the people who’d taken advantage of a lonely kid.
It was a fair question.
“StarkBar,” James says.
If this had been a few days ago Bruce might have pushed for more enthusiastic content, but now-- he’ll take unhappy acceptance, if that’s what it takes.
“I’m not going to say no,” Tony says.  “You’re not in any hurry to get to bed?”
“Tony will probably have us a new place before the day is out, but I think it’d be good to give James’s knee one more day to rest before we try and hike," Bruce says.  "Especially if you’re still in any pain, James.  It would be helpful if you can keep us updated.”
“I’m glad you like those,” Bruce says, glad for a reason to change the subject. “I can’t say for sure, but you look like you’ve healed up more than a typical person would expect overnight. You might have stayed injured as long as you did because your body didn’t have anything in it to use for repairs.”
“That was five days ago,” Steve says.
“It’s fine.  You need to get this done.”
“So you’ll do it?” Steve asks.
He follows James further into the house and discovers it really is perfectly suited to their needs.  It’s one story, fully furnished, and in addition to the living room and kitchen, it has two bedrooms and one large bathroom.  There’s a modern minimalist decorating scheme consistent throughout, with lots of light colors set against dark wood that Bruce finds calming. It also has very few windows. If you want to take in the view you’d need to go outside to sit on the large, wrap-around deck, and that’s not a problem since it will give Bruce or James some breathing space if either of them start to feel confined.  Clint too, if he decides not to run.
“I’m out,” Bruce says, shaking his head. “I don’t think Knitting with the Hulk would go over very well with the other guy.”
“Old,” James says.
be that cruel.
you know that it's true.
“I’ll help you carry,” Natasha offers.  "Let these nerds clean up."
“Holy shit, that was
That at least draws Steve’s attention. He turns his eyes slowly up to Tony. “I feel like I’m going to regret asking this, but what’s a BannerBar?”
“A large Iron Man and a large Captain America,” Steve says. “Two straws for each.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Don’t act like that doesn’t make quantitative sense, Banner. It’s an insult to us both.
The Other Guy feels the threat lessen and control is easier to wrestle back.
“He’s looking for Bucky Barnes,” James growls. “And that ain’t me.  Him wantin’ his friend back isn’t gonna change a thing.”
“I thought you said this was Bruce’s project.” Steve takes a nibble.
Bruce ducks his head in apology, and James looks entirely unimpressed with his idea. Clint is giddy, though.
“Even the part where you swore, used the Lord’s name in vain, and broke the table?” Tony asks with a grin.
“I knew what I was doing when I offered the tower.”
couch and insult my favorite show?  Sergeant Whiskers is a national treasure.”
“Are we getting close?” Bruce asks, as he wrestles his water bottle out of his bag and unscrews the top.
“He was more than just air support,” Steve says automatically.
“You read it right out of my mind,” Bruce deadpans. “The only thing you got wrong was the timeline. I am an expert with braids. I’d have us both done in under twenty minutes.”
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry,” Tony gasps between laughs. “It’s just... you’re totally aiming to be the Hawkeye of sex.”
Steve shakes his head and laughs, but does open the back.  Inside there are four massive crates.  He lifts them out one by one.  Each is labeled with one of their names.
That’s how it’s meant to go.
“I was,” Steve lies.  “You’re a terrible influence.” He doesn’t mean for it to happen but his voice goes a little soft.  A little extra fond.  He reaches over and rubs his fingers over the top of Tony’s hand.  “And I wouldn’t have you any other way.”
“Tash is making hangover stew and fried potatoes. Have a seat,” Sam says. “She gets testy when people get too close to the stove.”
“I’ll make it up to him later.”
“Because you’re supposed to be inside, eating the damn fries.  Five platters, guys," Clint complains.  "It’s like you’re not even trying.”
They stop for lunch about two hours in, and once they’re off the ice and out of their skates, Tony checks his phone. He’s got a text from Steve he hadn’t heard come in. When he sees it, he smiles.
“You ever heard that all work and no play makes for a dull boyfriend?” Clint challenges.
He doesn't resist at all as Steve drags him down against the cushions and pins him there.  Steve's response is muffled in Tony's neck, but Tony can hear him well enough to be filled with a warm, pleasant glow.
“I come bearing gifts,” Natasha says in a soft, not-painful-to-the-hangover voice.
Bruce and Bucky form a tentative trust.  Tony and Steve could use some help.
A taxi pulls up and Bucky speaks to the driver, while Natasha opens the back door.
Tony lifts his egg in victory.
“She’s going to love you,” Steve says. “How could anyone not?”
Tony ignores the comment and is clearly delighted when the screen changes to the portrait of him, though as the seconds creep on Steve glances at Tony’s face and sees the beginnings of something less happy.  Less sure.  Then downright unfocused.
Easter Eve dinner turns into a huge argument about who is the most capable of keeping a baby alive should one of them ever end up a parent.  It's the sort of argument that only happens after mortals are several bottles of wine in, and the Super Soldiers and the deity have celebrated the holiday with some Asgardian Rum.  Pepper's idea on how to settle the dispute once and for all is met with tipsy, wager-making enthusiasm.
“I wouldn’t stop you from getting your reve--”
“You’ve seen me exactly three times in the last three months. At the gala when I yelled at you. During the whole California mess when I yelled at you,” Tony says. “And today. Where there’s no guarantee I’m not going to yell at you. I’m a weird thing for you to miss.”
In the best news of the day, Kate and Nanna are right behind them.  The two women blend in with the rest of the astonished crowd, and then as other employees rush to their cars, likely heading for safety, Kate and Nanna do the same.  Tony watches Kate’s bug pull out of the parking lot with no trouble, then the drone-cam feed switches to the black escalades headed in the direction of the blast.
"Is there a reason why you called? Not that I’m not happy to hear from you but just… did something happen with..."
“Turn on IceTalk,” Bucky says.
Steve sits down on the edge of Tony’s desk and his posture has relaxed.  “I don’t think Pepper’s going anywhere because you can tell a Monet from a Manet.”
“You look good,” Steve tells Tony. “Really, I mean it. So good.”
“Ummmm.  Have you tried turning it off and on?”
answer and the way the conversation steers to absurd if Bruce ever asks to know anything too specific. Which means Tony isn’t as accurate as say... CNN, but he’s a hell of a lot more interesting than the latest breaking news.
“You’re kind of embarrassing, too, Uncle Tony,” Jenny proclaims as she lets Tony go. “But you don’t pull up to my school blasting country music, so you’re doing better than dad.”
. You’ve got this. Okay? You’ve got this.”
It’s not a question of how pissed I’d be. It’s more a question of who punches you first, James or Steve. My money’s on Steve.
“So who’s gonna go put them on?” Steve asks.
“When did you injure yourself?” Bruce asks.
“Sam was a big part of that,” Bruce deflects.
“Won’t that distract you?”
“He should be nervous,” Tony says. “Their return policy is generous.”
A few hours pass in near silence before they get to the right town and it’s on the other side of that town, past the outskirts, up a lengthy, steep climb, that they find their temporary home. The small chalet could have easily been the inspiration for the evil witch’s cottage in the Hansel and Gretel story. It’s gingerbread brown, with icing white window shutters and dozen of suncatchers dangling like colorful glass candy. There’s a balcony that stretches all around, but only a few windows.
“Can I walk you back to SI?” Steve asks.
Steve gives her a
Might as well pass along the message of hope.  Considering everything they’ve all lost, it’s about the only thing they’ve got left.
“Not up here he’s not,” Clint warns. “Whether he’s got two working arms or one working arm, we are all kinds of fucked if he’s awake.”
“If it’s all the same, I’d kind of like to see your lab,” Steve says, sounding a bit shy to make the request.  “I always wanted to get up close with a robot.  If it’s not too much to ask, I’d like to see yours.”
Steve sighs.  “Can you please--”
There’s no way he’s going to out Tony, even to his two best friends. So he’s got to keep Tony’s confession to himself.
“I don’t care who you’re sleeping with,” Steve says, trying to keep his tone polite.  He turns from the punching bag to give Tony his full attention.  “If someone’s going to act like an asshole I’m going to treat them like an asshole.  In any century.”
“Fine, you’re impossible but fine,” Steve grumbles.
She straightens back up and looks at Steve expectantly. “You lovebirds know what you want to order?”
“He gave some guy an island once,” Clint says wistfully.  “I can’t believe he’s got that kind of cash to hand out and he
Tony gets it, he does.  Steve doesn’t want to be alone.  For that matter, neither does Tony.  He’s got a lot on his mind and if he lets his brain do its own thing, that’s just asking for a panic attack or nightmares or insomnia.  This is better.  Company is good. They both deserve a break.  And Tony’s not sure when’s the last time he’s eaten anything that’s not yellow and shaped like a sponge.
credit.”
“I don’t mean to be ungrateful,” Tony says. “I just... I need to know. Is this for real? Because if it’s not, I’d rather you tell me now. I could arrange for my ransom. This...”
“Eighty-six, huh?” Bruce asks. “Did you read them all?”
“Wait. What?” Tony asks.
“Tony never knowingly or intentionally sold weapons to arms dealers or terrorists.  That went on without his knowledge.  He would have rather burned his empire to the ground than see one more innocent life lost to Stark technology.  I know that for a fact.”
Tony ends the call.
What’s new is the way Tony tilts up his face and pushes forward the inch or two so that their lips meet.
“Maybe next time,” Steve says.  “Someone’s got to keep Fury and Stark from killing each other.”
Jarvis joins them by phone.
Tony trails off. So many people don’t know this. And usually if they find out it’s after a whole stack of paperwork. But he trusts Steve. Trusts him implicitly.
“I’m already working on it, sir.  However, Captain Rogers will need to take a look at my results as there are multiple sets by varying artists.”
Thirty minutes, that’s plenty of time to give himself a minute.
“You’re the worst taste tester ever,” Tony complains.
Bruce appreciates the redirect.  James is looking ready to bolt.
“I appreciate you telling me, whatever you can,” Steve says. “Tony said you’ve been incredible through all this.  I don’t think I’ll ever be able to thank you enough.”
Clint looks up with so much undisguised horror at the word ‘share’ that Tony chokes on a laugh.  Nanna’s back is turned to Clint as Clint slowly draws his thumb across his neck in the universal sign for ‘Take my figgies and I’ll kill you dead.’
“I don’t want to force him on you,” Steve says.  “What he did--”
Steve laughs at Tony’s surprised expression. “I do. We could afford nice places of own just fine, but we both like the company. He grew up in a big family in a noisy house, so he’s used to a crowd. I grew up alone and always wished there was someone around. I dunno. It just works for us.”
“I want to stay home and watch the game.”
Steve finds himself wondering if the men are in the middle of some kind of lovers’ quarrel, because for the first thirty minutes Sean doesn’t say a single word to Tony.  Technically neither does Steve, but that’s because Tony won’t make eye contact with him.   (Or with anyone else for that matter.)  Not even with Barton, who has taken the seat to Steve’s left and whose company makes for a welcome relief from the rest of their dining companions.
“Always,” Tony says.
“Uber,” Steve agrees.  “If we’re fast about it, we could be back in time for last call.”
“You don’t need to apologize,” Bruce says easily. “James wouldn’t have asked for your opinion if he didn’t want your honest perspective.”
“I’m not sure it would be helpful,” Bruce says.
“There were no options,” James says. “Only obedience. You sure that’s not what you want?”
“Did you catch that interview with Stark’s ex?” he asks after they place their order.  “It was brutal.”
“How long will it take you to get ready?” Steve asks.
“Unless you would rather I do it, I think you could do all the scanning of your legs yourself,” Bruce suggests. “Or you can try the whole scan on your own and I can check the picture and if there’s something we can’t see clearly we’ll figure it out.”
“Not men,” Steve says.
“A lot of somethings happened at work,” Steve says. “Every single IT person at SHIELD came to find me at some point today to meaningfully and sincerely apologize for having teased me when I first woke up from the ice.”
The pride in Bruce’s voice is unmistakable. Bruce is exactly the kind of friend Tony deserves.
“I hear banjos,” Natasha whispers in a low, spooky voice.
The photographers push in further and Steve starts shoving them out of the way so he can join Tony and get the SI staff through the mob.  Since heading back for the street seems like a poor life choice, Tony and Steve get into the elevator, too.
“Well, if you’re gonna be all
Natasha sticks her tongue out at him.
“Okay then,” Steve says.  “There we go.  I know as much as anyone, probably, and I’m still here.  I’m not going anywhere.  I am deeply, ridiculously, happily in love with you.  All this... baggage.  We both have it.  It doesn’t change a thing.”
“Ha ha,” Clint grouses.  “Seriously.  Shower?”
“Jesus, I’m not a kid,” James says, in frustration.
Tony nods.  “He’s the son of a competitor.  He got himself into some trouble and then his parents disowned him and I recognized his name in the paper.  I know a little something about how that feels.  Went to check on him.  Offered to pay for his rehab.  I was stupid to think we wouldn’t get caught together.”
Tony shrugs again. His whole life is a big damn shrug at this point.
“I’ll be right back,” Steve assures him unnecessarily, since Tony seems to still be asleep.
They all skate to center ice, and Bucky looks over their assembled friends. There’s really only one choice that makes sense.
“I don’t have to give you the keys,” Tony points out.  “I’m trying to talk about this like an adult.”
Steve leads him through the crowd, with a possessive (and doesn’t that send a thrill down Tony’s spine) hand to the small of his back.  They make their way out to the little back employee patio and Steve lets go of him, so they can sit next to each other on the picnic table.  Tony leans in for a quick kiss, that Steve manages to turn into something with a lot more heat and promise.
Natasha leans forward in her chair.  “Is amnesty ours to offer?”
Bruce nods. He can’t hide his smile and James narrows his eyes in annoyance.
“Leave it. I can walk,” James says. “If I slow you down, go ahead. I’ll find you.”
“I don’t mind at all,” Steve confirms once they're outside.  “Thanks.  For everything, by the way.  The last few days, especially.  I was in a bad place.  Guess you must have noticed.”
going to be alone.  Suddenly the hand on Steve’s thigh took on all new promise.
Steve relaxes at the touch.
“That was a yes, guys!” Tony calls instead.
“Also, I’m proud of you. I don’t think I can say that enough times.”
James looks down at Clint, then back up at Bruce. “Can I talk to Steve now, do you think?”
“It’s okay to have a crush on someone.  You weren’t doing anything wrong, there.  So I looked into it for you,” she says.  “Turns out, since you aren’t his direct supervisor, it only takes one form.”
The look on Clint’s face makes Bruce bristle.  He can only imagine.
designing weapons.  His flea drones are meant to be more of a nuisance than anything.  They’ve got nets and smoke bombs and magnetic fences.  It all started as crowd dispersal stuff mostly, but in JARVIS’s capable control they are quite an army.
“Everything...” Steve repeats.  There are a lot of crates but when they’re meant to encompass
If anyone else said that, Bruce would be irritated. It negates his experience. It wipes out the bad that he ought to be held accountable for. It absolves him of crimes Bruce plans to mourn to the grave. But he doesn’t get irritated with James. James is new to friendship and he is trying.
Steve hasn’t felt this unsure in a long time. Like there’s no right answer. Like he doesn’t know what he wants or why he’s here or how to use a damn door. He’s almost convinced himself to leave and try this again at a normal hour and also use the bell when the door swings open.
Those are the first words Tony has spoken in over an hour.
They’ve both still got paint in their hair when they collapse into the booth across from Bruce at their favorite diner.
“What’s the right word?” Steve presses.  He keeps his voice even, trying hard not to be defensive about this.  Just because it isn’t his fault doesn’t mean it’s not valid.
“Me three,” Rhodey chimes in.  “Pepper’s the only person Tony’s ever dated that was worth a damn.”
“Bigger on the inside...” Tony whispers dreamily.
Tony pulls on a hoodie over his pajamas and goes to join two of the most important people in his life.
“Is feeling the malfunction?” Bruce asks.
“So not about the explosions then.”
“I was the farthest thing from bored,” Steve confesses.  He sits the muffins and the coffee down on the table next to Tony.  “Can you take a break?”
Steve reaches over and squeezes Tony hand.
“Dr. Banner,” Tony clarifies, pointing toward the office.
Steve sounds like the least-nefarious person Tony’s ever met and Tony feels like a complete idiot, because yes, he does have a gun. He has the weapon Natasha had handed him in the apartment tucked into the waist of the back of his jeans. He’d forgotten it was there in his panic.
“Not getting laid,” Tony says. “Made a friend.”
“Nothing,” Tony says. “Tired.”
“You’re definitely alive,” Steve says.  “And a lot better off with those assholes out of the way.  That was incredible by the way.
“I didn’t cheat you on you,” Tony says, as Steve hands him a towel.  Tony half-heartedly dries himself then wraps it around his waist and tucks it in. “I swear I didn’t.  There are photos.  I can explain.”
Tony chews at his bottom lip. “I don’t deserve it. Probably wasn’t fair for me to ask.”
“Dr. Banner,” JARVIS says calmly.  “Sir is on line.”
“Where’s Sleeping Beauty?” Clint asks.
“I’m not sure what you thought would happen when you told me this,” Tony says.  “But it doesn’t change anything.  You really think I’d even go for someone who’s all about following orders?”
Rhodey alone in a dark cell.  More than picture it, Tony can
“Ice. Right,” Bruce says, after a beat. “I’m sorry. That was... not a helpful thing to suggest. What about soaking in a warm bath? That can loosen up the muscles a little so it won’t hurt as much if I need to reposition your knee.”
“Come ‘ere,” Steve says.
Over the years the quilt (and a bowl of fresh cookies) had come back to Tony a few times when Mrs. Rhodes suspected he needed them and when Rhodey’s mom passed away the year before, the quilt came back to him permanently, without the bowl or cookies.
Tony shakes his head.  “Fine.  Pep was the exception.  We all know how well that worked out for her.  Even when I tried to contribute, it was all wrong.”
“How about one really mind-blowing kiss?” Tony asks.
“Apparently the Vita-Rays didn’t do anything to enhance your tastebuds then,” Tony says.  “Or is this just what happens when you grow up before the invention of sliced bread?”
“Oh my god, you two are seriously having a pissing contest over spooning, while we’re fleeing for my life. With tacos. Who even are you?”
“I put on my big boy undies today,” Tony agrees.  “I’ll survive.”
“Huh,” Tony says.  It’s more of an audible huff than commentary on Steve’s answer.
“I can only imagine,” Steve says.
Steve isn’t sure if this is the kind of thing Tony wants to hear, but it’s the truth and some of these things just need said.
What else do I like?
“Clearly science must not do for you what it does for me then,”  Steve teases.  “I like to listen to him talk.  Like to listen to you talk.”
Tony’s cut off when Steve’s cell rings.
James shrugs. Bruce doesn’t take it as indifference. He gets that right now James is in totally over his head, so without waiting for a reply Bruce continues.
“James, you can feel free to check over the scanner parts if you want to see what they look like or smash them with a hammer if you really don’t them in the house. I won’t be mad.  I'm not going to
“No ring yet,” Rhodey says. “Not even any real dates yet. That’s what this conversation is about. Was supposed to be about anyway, before we got derailed by the Tony Stark Talk Parade. Pepper and I both agreed we wouldn’t move forward without your blessing.”
“Were you all Special Ops?” Tony asks, as Steve takes his hand to steady him.
“We all have those moments,” Clint says. “Don’t feel like you’ve got to run off just cause we’ve seen one.”
Steve’s known Tony Stark for a few months, and he’s still not sure how he feels about him.  As Iron Man, he’s competent.  Not exactly enthusiastic about the team dynamic, but he shows up, and he does the job.
“Because I want to know where my boyfriend is going with my car?” Tony asks.
The six people ahead of them laugh and chat and move as one, like a murmuration of starlings.  Their friendship is effortless.  Tony feels his nerves return, but at least he’s got Bruce, and they make quiet small talk the few blocks to the restaurant.  Once they’re inside, Steve leads the way to a table, and Bruce and Tony are separated as Bruce is nudged into the booth and Clint scrambles in behind him to claim “best seat”.
stuck.”
hoping for as much honesty as you can give me.  Even if it’s not pretty.”
They walk past Jenny and she beams up at them both, which puts another smile on Tony’s face that lasts long after they leave.
“I’ll stay,” Steve agrees.
“Let Tony go check,” Bucky counters.  “You and me have to make a trip to the store for the rest of what we’re gonna need for Nanna and Kate’s uniforms.”
“I’d have shot you,” James says with finality.
that name.  I saw him punch a guy once, just cause he wouldn’t stop calling him James even after Bucky asked nicely.  So why's he want to be called that now?”
“Let him,” Steve says.
“I don’t know,” Tony says.
Tony shakes his head.  “He’d have had to be around to do that.  Mom wasn’t a fan of needy children.  Or of me in general.  She wanted me to deal with them on my own.”
Steve’s stumped.  Not that Tony’s ever been particularly predictable.
“You stopped at the Toro Taco Stand?” Tony asks.
He tosses and turns for almost half an hour after she's gone before he gives up on getting any more sleep.
“Tony, Bruce, I need you to head into the trees first.  Stick together.  Head downhill.  Once you’re in past a hundred feet that copter will be firing at you blind,” Steve says, his voice steady and firm.  “We’ll hold their attention to give you a head start.”
Tony gets to his bedroom and turns back to his friend. “I’ll go. You don’t have to stay to watch me out the door.”
“Texting someone special?” Sam Wilson, the Stars’ head athletic trainer, asks.
“You’re calling middle?” Tony asks, following as Clint leads them carefully down the alley. It’s a strange conversation to have while they’ve all got guns out, but Clint and Steve seem perfectly comfortable. “Just like that?”
“You aren’t useless,” Natasha says.  “Someone needs to keep an eye on Tony.  Someone needs to keep an eye on you.  You two can watch each other, then no eyes are wasted.”
It takes Tony less than 24 hours to decide he wants in on the game and by the end of business that day, he's racked up his first 20 points.
He opens the first by laying his hand against a blue lit square, a security measure Tony occasionally uses in the lab.
“Can you explain the malfunction to me?” he asks.
“Tony!” Clint greets as he leads his group away from the stream of Stark Industries workers who are all heading for the front door.  Clint’s friends are easy to recognize since they are the only ones dressed down, amidst a flood of darkly dressed, business casual colleagues.
“I’ll see what I can do,” Tony agrees, as they speed toward the security checkpoint gate of HammerTech.
“Which means we protect him,” Natasha explains. “Like one of our own.”
“That’s perfect,” Steve soothes.  “You’ve got this.  Keep breathing, nice and slow.”
