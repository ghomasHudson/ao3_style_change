Steve immediately tried to struggle off the bed, just as Tony had known he would. “You want to put my dick in a cage? I don’t fucking think so!”
"I'm not asking for much, sweetheart. It can't be that hard. Or is your greedy little hole too stretched out to keep it in?"
“Have I told you lately how cute it is when you blush and get all shy? Of course I meant actually sleeping. But I’m not against the idea of sitting on your knot, either. You know, when we’re both feeling ready for that step.”
Maria sighed, petting Tony’s hair. “I wonder if your body is reacting to losing Steve so suddenly… Let’s keep an eye on you, and if you get worse, we’ll go to the doctor, okay?”
Tony followed Steve, like a duckling following its mother. He was silent, his hands in his pockets as he looked up at the sky. More rain… just what they needed. Add more gloom onto the already gloomy day in Italy.
Tony couldn’t finish his sentence, and Peggy could guess how it was going to end. Nodding, she pulled Tony to the side, away from the soldiers taking Hydra agents into custody and taking over the radio tower. “Alright, what’s the matter?”
The brunet winced slightly as he moved his torso the wrong way. His rib was nearly halfway healed, and occasionally he'd get headaches, but those weren't nearly as bad as his rib pain. He kept ice on it a lot. Most of his shirts had creased a certain way because of the ice packs he wore. They were going to look weird when he was healed fully. Or maybe he could just get new shirts. His mother would probably love a shopping trip sometime soon.
“I lost the baby weeks after you disappeared,” Tony said weakly. “I wanted to keep the baby so bad, but I couldn’t… I physically couldn’t, Steve…”
Steve nodded, and after sending texts to both people, he helped Tony up from the bar and held the omega close to his body. "Come on, let's get you safely home. We can put on a movie, have some snacks, and forget all about your exes. Sound good?"
The omega seemed to struggle with himself for a bit, but then he nodded while biting his bottom lip. “Okay… I’ll go in…. You won’t go anywhere, will you? I don’t know if I’ll be comfortable enough to stay in there for too long.”
The omega tugged the alpha to his lips in a hungry kiss, nipping at his lips until they parted for him so he could dazzle his mouth with the talents of his practiced tongue.
Smiling, Tony moved to get some clothes on. He couldn’t wait to see Steve again and show him the designs he had come up with. Tony couldn’t stand another day seeing that horrible show suit that the blond had to wear most of the time, though his tour was officially cancelled, so Steve wasn’t going to be wearing the suit any time soon. Any other time he was going to be wearing the suit would either be heading into a Hydra base or out of one. If Steve was going to still be Captain America, he was going to go in style.
Moving with determination, the agent moved over to her vanity, pulling out a box and opening it, smiling to herself. “Perfect,” she said as she moved back over to Tony. Inside the box was a brooch and a pair of clip on earrings. They were sparkling red, almost matching the color of the little gems around the face of Tony’s watch.
Steve nodded. "We can worry about it tomorrow, or whenever I can get that meeting set up with the leader of Hydra."
“Mmm, fuck my incredibly smart brains out, then spoil me with gentleness in the aftercare. Bonus points if you stoke my ego with compliments during any of it, and mega bonus points for eating me out in the start—fuck, that was hot.”
Tony rolled his eyes with a light chuckle through his tears. “Yes, silly. There wasn’t anyone else I ever shared a heat with.”
“Hello again, Tony,” Peggy greeted with a smile. “It seems that Steve just got a job offer of sorts.”
Steve wastes no time getting to the door, fully dressed in the tux Tony had gotten for him. He smiled when he saw Tony after opening the door. "Hey, Tony, I hope the broken elevator didn't cause too much trouble for you."
“Of course. I just hope the baby survives.” Peggy nodded her head. “Also… maybe don’t mention it to Howard. He doesn’t know yet and… he wasn’t very fond of his son being in a relationship with the father of the baby.”
“Wow, I… thank you, guys. I thought I’d have to do more convincing.” Tony chuckled, then started crying, a smile on his face. “I love you guys,” he whispered as his parents wrapped their arms around him.
Tony, you just exposed yourself to the enemy. They know who you are now, you have an identity out there that Hydra is out for now. You’re on Hydra’s hit list now! They want to kill you!”
This time when Tony landed back in California, it wasn’t just Jarvis waiting for him and his father, but Maria was also there, holding a hankie to her eyes because she had heard the terrible news about Captain America and of Tony’s dance with death. When she had learned the news, she had wept bitterly for her son and for the happy future he had been looking forward to. Now it had all been ripped out from underneath him, and when Maria finally looked upon his face again, she couldn’t hold back her tears when she looked at how dull and depressed he looked. A far cry from the happy days the holidays had brought to the Stark household.
The car stopped in front of a completely normal looking building, and Steve didn't suspect a thing until the entered the building and saw nothing in the lobby but a simple desk and an elevator. Of course. Just like the old SSR base. Fury led Steve into the elevator, then they were going down much faster than the blond had anticipated. He startled a little when the elevator moved, and he felt his face heat up in embarrassment.
Tony felt like something wasn’t right, but he picked up the phone and sat down next to it, feeling a sense of dread rising as both Jarvis and Maria put hands on his shoulders. He swallowed and spoke. “Hello?”
The alpha flushed when his mind came to those latter thoughts. Now was definitely not the time to get excited. He willed himself to calm back down before he returned to the kitchen, the smell of a fresh meatloaf filling his nostrils.
Even as he lay there each night, his sweet omega spent and sleeping peacefully in his arms, he was dreaming of what he would do to him next. The erotic tortures he could visit on this ever so willing man. Anything he wanted, Steve would let him have. Would belong to him completely and still offer more. Was already so deeply in Tony’s thrall that he would never betray him. Never leave him. Never abandon him.
“You’re wrong!” Steve fought harder, straining to free himself, glaring daggers at the smug man standing before him. “I won’t do this! I won’t give in, do you understand me?”
"Arms behind your back, grip your wrists. Don't let go until I say you can." He slid onto the bed behind him, thighs stretched on either side of Steve's, arms wrapped around him, breath hot on the back of his neck. Steve slid his arms behind his back, gripped his own wrists tight.
"Not today. Not after that stunt with the plug. I think you earned yourself... Three days? At least?"
Tony’s lips twitched with amusement. “No honey, it’s not. Let’s get it over with now. Then I can spend the rest of the day being nice to you. How does that sound?”
Gentle fingers brushed his cheek. "Sweetheart, you know you're welcome to spend time downstairs with me whenever you'd like, right? I gave you full access a while ago."
“Good boy. If I let you off the board will you behave? Sit and eat dinner without trying to hit me again?”
He shook his head. “No… Omegas don’t… We release. It’s softer, but lasts… A lot longer…” His breath hitched as the pressure on his neck stayed, drawing out the sensation.
There was a fluttering sensation in his chest. Cautious hope. Maybe this could be real. Maybe he could have this.
Poor Steve! Every time it starts to get better, it gets worse. Feel free to let me know what you think in the comments. Hope you enjoy!
Rolling onto his back, Steve realized that Tony wasn’t lying beside him. When he listened, he could hear the other man moving around in the living room. He contemplated trying to remove the cage and felt a pang of guilt. Tony was trusting him. Leaving him alone for the first time in days. Besides, his experience with the plug told him the cage wasn’t going anywhere if Tony didn’t allow it.
“Alright. Sunset is a beta. Or at least, that’s what she declares publicly. We dated for a while, as I’m sure you gathered. Everyone was thrilled. Meeting of two tech giants, America’s sweethearts, all that jazz. After a few months, she got me alone. Candlelit dinner, fine wine, the works. Said she had this fantasy. Since I was an alpha, she wanted me to dominate her. Treat her like an omega. Of course, since she was such a public figure, we’d have to go somewhere private. Get away for a while. She told me about this private lodge in the mountains she owned. Said it would be perfect. Piece of advice, Steve? If anyone ever invites you to their secluded cabin in the woods, run.”
The door opened behind him, footsteps on the tiles as multiple people entered the room. The scent of evergreen and motor oil rolled over him. “I see he’s awake. Good.” The voice was rich and deep. The alpha he’d seen in the hallway moved around into his line a vision. “Good evening, Steve. You look lovely.”
“Well, Rhodey ditched me again to go out with his new girl, as if I didn’t know him and Pepper had been seeing each other for months. I am insulted that they think I wouldn’t figure it out! Insulted! And that they’d think I wouldn’t be happy for them! I mean, really!”
"Oh..." He took a breath, and gingerly settled himself onto the barstool. Tony watched him for a moment before he turned away to pull out ingredients and arrange them on the counter. It only took a few minutes before Steve was squirming around on the seat, hips shifting to try and find an angle that didn't press the plug into his prostate and then jerking the other way from the pressure. The low buzz of arousal that had faded into the background returned with a vengeance causing his body to throb and ache. A sharp pinch to one of his tender nipples drew his attention back with a gasp.
Steve allowed himself to be pulled to his feet, to stumble down the hallway after Tony. Gratefully collapsing onto the pillow waiting for him at the foot of the bed when he got there. He should be on his knees for Tony, to please and obey him. He dimly heard the sounds of the older man moving around the room, but then he was back in front of Steve, fingers gently combing through his hair.
Tony paused for a moment, gazing into Steve’s glassy eyes. The moment he could, he’d be struggling again, which meant preparing him before the medication wore off. He didn’t want to keep him drugged all the time. It wasn’t good for him. He quickly retrieved supplies from the room he’d set up for corrective purposes and training exercises, knowing he’d need it to be close. A slim nanotech collar was fastened around Steve’s neck, leaving the fresh bite mark fully exposed. Tony flipped the pliant man onto his stomach, propping his hips on a pillow, ass high in the air. He removed the generic plug from the center, eliciting a soft whimper. The stretched and reddened hole pulsed under his gaze, needy and empty. A good sign. Some of the necessary instincts were in place.
The man in the holding room was breathtaking. Golden hair gleamed under the lights. Smooth, lightly tanned skin was on display, as the omega hadn’t been allowed the privilege of clothing. As Tony’s eyes ran over the well muscled chest and thighs, he thought it might be a shame to ever allow that body to be covered. The omega had taken no notice of the two men standing in the hall, continuing his attempts to force the door open and secure his release.
“I looked over his history. I think we can deal with a lot of the physical issues fairly simply. As for the mental ones, I’d be happy to make some recommendations based on what worked with James.”
Tony pulled Steve close, tucking the blankets around them. Each time he was shifted it drew a soft breathy moan from Steve’s throat. He’d been right. That was exactly what Steve needed. And he intended to keep giving him anything and everything he needed. Anatomically and emotionally. Tony refused to lose. To be abandoned, helpless and alone, ever again. He slowly drifted to sleep, arms locked tight around Steve’s body, with several ideas on how to replicate and use an alpha’s knot running through his thoughts.
“You touched yourself without my permission, sweetheart. And you just earned yourself a spanking to boot. I think you’ll be a very sorry boy by the time today is over.” He swallowed the rest of his coffee and set the mug aside. “Now, where were we? Oh, yes. I remember.” He made a production of coating this fingers with a thick layer of gel, knowing Steve’s eyes were locked onto the sight. Finally he slid back into Steve’s body, three this time, pressing deep.
He heard the water shut off and busied himself with gathering plates and silverware, setting a few bottles of water on the table. With all the crying Steve had been doing today he was probably dehydrated. He retrieved the bags of food from the elevator and began arranging containers waiting for the other man. Tony looked up when Steve padded quietly into the room. The thin t-shirt and pants left very little to the imagination. Color climbed up Steve’s cheeks at Tony’s blatant perusal, but he made no attempt to stop him or hide himself. Another piece of the puzzle clicked into place.
"Loki!" Thor took a step towards him, stopping only when more weaponry turned towards him. "Brother, are you well?"
Steve rolled over, burying his face in the pillows and groaned, hips grinding down into the bed desperately seeking release.
Afterwards Steve curled up against Tony's side, head on his shoulder and legs draped across his lap, a hand smoothing idly over his hip. "You know, I'm enjoying the time together, but this isn't exactly what I thought you'd want for today."
The beginning of his knot began to swell, teasing at Steve’s abused rim as it rubbed against him. He could feel his body slowly building up, almost entirely pain with very little pleasure. Tony thrust hard, burying himself as deeply into Steve’s body as he could, knot swelling to full size as he came. The pressure on his gland triggered Steve’s final release, his body spasming around his alpha uncontrollably, and the pain finally knocked him into darkness.
For the rest of you, I appreciate the comment that contain constructive criticism, requests, and non flaming or insulting opinions on the story. Prepare yourself for a big chunk of massive porn, because that’s apparently what I write when I’m stressed out or upset.
Steve curled up tighter in his lap, cuddling and kissing until food arrived. He pulled a chair around the desk so he could sit close to Tony while they ate, reaching out to touch him often, reassuring himself that the other man was still there. After lunch, Tony walked him to the door, kissed him and promised to be home as soon as he could. Told him to be a good boy, while squeezing the cage through his pants.
He noticed an odd numb spot just below his prostate when the alpha’s cock rubbed over it. The sensation was unsettling especially when the knot swelled, relentlessly pressing on the area. His thoughts were interrupted by callused fingers stroking over his cock urging him towards his own release. It took him by surprise as it crashed over him, the feeling of his balls pulling tight to his body no longer there to signal impending orgasm. Those clever fingers slid below his cock, pressing in and rubbing the now bare skin, drawing an even more explosive climax from his spent body. He lay there, trembling, struggling to draw breath, clenching around the cock still held inside of him.
Steve watched Tony with trepidation for the next several days, hoping for any hint of what was coming. Each time the genius noticed, he simply flashed a wicked smile and carried on with whatever he had been doing. It was driving Steve crazy. Which was probably the point.
Steve closed his eyes and moaned. The idea that Tony had taken the time to do that made him flush. "Th- Thank you, Sir. You're so good to me. I'm so sorry."
Steve cried out, arching off the bed, brought to release by only Tony’s words. He clung to him, sensitive and trembling, as the last aftershocks rippled through his body. Tony gathered him close, pressing soft kisses to his hair. “That’s right, sweetheart. I’ve got you. I’m here. I’m not going anywhere.”
Steve smirked. "Probably about the same as they would if they knew he liked to be tied up and tortured by Iron Man."
The bath done, he dried off and rubbed a sweet-smelling lotion that Pepper had brought him into every inch of skin he currently had access to. He took special care to make sure the cage was properly cleaned and dried. Tony wanted him to wear it, had made it with his own hands in the hopes that Steve would someday, it was important that he showed how much that meant to him by taking good care of it.
Steve’s gland throbbed harder than before, seeming to clench tightly. It spasmed, releasing in a rush of pleasure so intense it nearly rendered him unconscious. His entire body felt like it was seizing, shaking uncontrollably in the restraints, leaving him sobbing and helpless. His vision went blurry, prickles of black around the edges.
"A conference, actually. In London." Steve slipped behind him, wrapping his arms around Tony's waist and burying his face against his back. "Which is why I cleared your schedule."
Pulling off his shirt, Steve used it to clean up the bulk of his mess. He picked up the cage with trembling fingers, sliding the tube over his tender cock and his balls through the thick ring behind it. For a moment nothing happened, then with a hiss the entire thing seemed to shrink down around him, molding to the exact size and shape of his body, and curving back to fold his cock in half before locking in place with an audible click. He ran his fingertips over the smooth metal, shuddering uncontrollably. It was too much, too intense.
"Since you ask so prettily." The blunt head of Tony's cock pressed against his rim before stroking into him. Fast, hard thrusts, angled to strike his prostate as often as possible. He didn't hold back, using Steve for his own pleasure, leaving him throbbing and desperate for more when he was finished, flooding him with his release before sliding out again. "Thank you, sweetheart. I needed that."
"Mertlock the Magnificent. Pompous fucker. Steve! Look out!" Tony flipped around in the suit, plunging into a steep dive, knocking him out of the way of the largest construct yet, rising high enough to touch the tops of nearby buildings. "Are you okay?"
Tony smirked slightly, knowing that he’d won. “Then it’s my job to take care of you. And if I tell you to come get me if you need me? Even if it’s the middle of the night?”
"Yes, Tony, God!" He was close, so close to release, even with the cage holding him back. He could feel it creeping up his spine, locking his muscles, his balls getting heavy and tight, the vibrations echoing in every inch of his body. So close...
"Alright, sweetheart. Come here." He pulled Steve's head down to his shoulder, gently rubbing his back. "That's better. Take your time."
Tony began digging through drawers and file cabinets, muttering to himself about overly helpful robots. The entire situation was so surreal that Steve couldn’t help laughing. Tony glanced back, smiling at him, and suddenly he felt light and free. Safe, in a way that he never had before. He was a claimed omega. By Tony Stark no less. The man he’d wanted since they’d met. And a kinder, gentler version. Who made Steve feel wanted and cherished.
“I know we’ve never talked about this, and I’m sorry if it puts you in a bad position, but there’s something I need to say to you. I’ve enjoyed our time together. A lot. You are creative and amazingly sadistic. But we can’t keep doing this. Because it’s not fair to you, not when I’m in love with someone else. I’m so sorry.”
“The rules are simple. If you’re hard, you have my permission to come. For every time you come without my permission, you earn a punishment. Understand?”
He held Steve there until his cock softened and slipped out. Continued to hold him in position as his body was brutalized with ceaseless pleasure. Tony finally released his hair only to grab his pecs, kneading them hard enough to bruise, pinching and pulling at his nipples. “I’ve missed these perfect tits of yours, Steve. Maybe next time that’s where I’ll fuck you. Right here between your perfect tits.”
He sobbed as Tony's fingers slid out, leaving him empty and wanting. His body still yearned for pleasure, even as he ached. The clamps were released, a fresh wave of pain shooting through his abused nipples as Tony massaged feeling back into them, finally curling Steve into his arms, holding him close, brushing away his tears.
The pleasure built, distracting him from the pain for a while. The longer it went on, the more his hole clenched, desperate to be filled, leaking slick all over the surface of the machine. Steve didn’t notice the whimpers and cut off moans that were falling regularly from his lips as he attempted to grind down. His body tensed, the muscles in his legs stiffening. Steve could almost feel the gland tucked above his entrance harden, sending a bolt of pain up through him before it released. A rush of come dripped from the cage, once again without the accompanying pleasure.
That lightheaded drunken feeling from the restaurant had returned. It felt like the world was spinning around him. Part of him wanted to refuse, to laugh it off as a joke, and forget this part of the night had ever happened. But a stronger part of him, the part that liked the feelings Tony drew out of him, that part wanted to keep playing. To see where this went. "Yes Tony." He whispered.
“Okay. Then that’s what we’ll do.” Tony moved away and Steve’s skin instantly felt cold. He must have let out some sound of distress, because the other man immediately began to soothe and praise him. “Such a good boy for me, taking your punishment so well. Just a little bit more now.”
“You can try, sweetheart. I do love a challenge. But at the end of the day? You will belong to me.” He slowly walked back behind Steve, fingers tracing over his skin, running down his spine. All he could do was tense his muscles, unable to jerk away from the touch.
Tony turned around as soon as Steve entered. "Good timing, sweetheart. Just finished getting ready for you. Come here." He pulled the chain from around his neck, unlocking Steve's cage and gently removing it. "Feel okay?"
Steve's voice came out a whisper. "I want you to spank me... And then take me. Hard. A little... Rough?"
For a long drawn out moment, Steve was afraid he failed. That he lost him.  Then strong arms slid under him, pulling him up into Tony’s lap, before wrapping tightly around him like steel bands. More tears fell, this time from relief. Tony buried his face in Steve’s neck, whispered sweet words and promises against his skin.
Tony let out a sign of relief. He’d been worried after he’d read Steve’s file, afraid that a lot of the damage would be permanent. “Great. I’m assuming you came prepared?”
Tony urged him to climb up on the bed, pulled Steve in against him and wrapped his arms tight around him, making him feel secure. He relaxed in the hold, mind starting to slow down as the fog from dinner earlier started creeping back in. “Thank you alpha…”
He shushed him, kissing his cheek, holding him close. "It's okay. That was your punishment, baby. It's all over. You didn't think you'd really get to come after you tried to sneak behind my back and take it, did you?" Steve just shook in his arms, devastated, desperately trying to process the sensations.
As if in answer to his prayers, the machine stopped, his body lifting free of the vibrator. He could feel the slick gushing down his thighs. The headphones and blindfold were pulled away, leaving him blinking helplessly into the light. When he could focus on the image of his alpha standing before him, he arched forward, mewling around the dildo, begging for what he needed. Tony unfastened the strap around the back of his head, gently sliding the gag from his mouth. As soon as he could speak, Steve was whimpering and begging to feel the man inside of him. “Please… Please, alpha. Please! Need you. Need you so much. Please!”
Steve leaned forward, arms still held behind his back, began nuzzling the hard length, lapping at the leaking tip with soft kitten licks. Tony gave him a chance to explore, enjoying the feel of Steve’s lips and tongue. He was always so eager for Tony’s cock, in any way that he could get it. Eventually Tony started to get impatient. He slid a hand into Steve’s hair, gripping it firmly, using the hold to guide him down onto his aching cock. Steve moaned, immediately taking him deep into his throat, even as it made him gag, tears forming in his eyes. He struggled so hard to please, and watching it only aroused Tony further.
Steve felt a slight shifting inside of him, and then a thick viscous liquid began to flow, rapidly beginning to fill his womb. He could feel the delicate tissue stretch beneath the onslaught of heavy liquid, see the outline begin to show beneath his flat stomach. He begged and pleaded behind the gag. Tony’s only response was to drive the vibrations against his sweet spot higher. Steve screamed as he released, body clenching painfully, shifting the plug spearing him open. His omega gland was swollen, throbbing as it was crushed against the unyielding speculum.
Begging and whimpers fell freely from his lips, as he writhed and pulled at the restraints. "Please! Tony, please!" His hips ground back against the wall before jerking forward into the air, trying uselessly to get some friction against his cock. The vibrations ceased for a moment, before starting on the lowest setting once more, leaving him groaning in disappointment.
Stark motioned Steve to stay back, probably afraid that Bucky was dangerous. He wanted to reassure him, promise that he’d never hurt Steve, would kill himself first. But he couldn’t find the air to speak. His lungs burned and his face was wet. Stark slowly moved into his space, as though approaching a wounded animal. First resting a gentle hand on Bucky’s knee before sliding closer. He got his arms around Bucky’s back, pulling him into the strong warmth of his chest, and Bucky allowed himself a single moment of weakness. He buried his face against the smooth skin and firm muscle, hiding from the world, from the horrors of his past. Seeking sanctuary even though he didn’t deserve it.
"Oh no." Firm hands gripped Steve's hips, pressing him back down to the bed. "You stay where I put you. Or am I going to have to tie you down?"
Eventually the itching faded, until only an echo was left behind. Clamps were removed, allowing blood to flow freely back into the abused tissue, drawing more tears down Steve’s face. The vibrator slowed and stopped before being gently eased out of him, leaving him feeling open and empty.
“So pretty for me, honey. You stay right there. I want to get a few things that I think will drive you out of your mind.”
Steve straightened up, and then gasped, grabbing the footboard for support. The plug inside of him was heavy, dragging against his rim and threatening to slide out altogether. He squeezed around it, turning wide helpless eyes to the brunette.
Hello lovely people! I’m finally back! Sorry it took so long for those waiting on an update. Finally moved, settled, and unpacked at the new house. It’s been hard to find the motivation to write lately, and being honest, a few nasty comments I have received have compounded the problem.
"As opposed to what? Because as far as I understand, if you play like we do, you're supposed to take care of your partner."
He let out a slow breath and settled into the sensation of kneeling before the brunette, carefully holding him in his mouth. There was brief movement as Tony pulled out his phone, and then he stilled. Steve closed his eyes, let himself float. He was where Tony had put him, doing as he wanted.
“Please what, sweetheart? You didn’t think you’d be rewarded for trying to touch what’s mine, did you?” He knelt on the bed, easily flipping Steve onto his stomach and pulling his hips back.
Steve moaned loudly as he was split open on the plug, stretched wider than he’d been on Tony’s cock. Steve shuddered helplessly when it was fully in place, his rim squeezing repeatedly around the thick neck, the base resting flat against the curve of his ass. The widest part of the plug settled near his opening, pressing against all of Steve’s sensitive glands, just like Tony had intended. Mimicking a knot.
I love reading all of the comments and hearing how much you’re enjoying my writing. Thank you so much!
Steve howled, arching as high as he was able as Tony pressed firmly against his prostate, milking it for a moment before moving his attention to the gland just beneath it. His omega gland was swollen and rock hard, spasming at the touch. A sharp stabbing pain caused Steve to tighten around Tony’s fingers, leaving him little room to move.
“You’d be amazed what I can be into LeBeau. I mean, not for you, obviously. You couldn’t handle me. All the cameras are in place, Tony. We have full surveillance which I’m sending to your HUD now.”
He wasn't due for a few more hours, and Steve was stretched out on the couch pretending to watch television, when he heard the sound of the elevator behind him. Probably Natasha coming up to try and cheer him up or coax him downstairs to spend time with the team. He had just decided to ignore it when he felt a hard hand fist into his hair.
The rest of the meal passed in a blur of frustration and need. And Tony asking him if he was alright. There were times Steve was grateful for how perceptive the genius was. Tonight was not one of them. After a seemingly endless drive back to the tower, and multiple assurances that not only was he just fine, but that he would actively make more time to spend with him, Tony finally let him escape to his floor.
Tony tilted his head to the side, studying him intently. "Miss being manhandled? Feeling delicate? Having a fella put you where he wants you, being able to keep you there?"
Tony stroked sweat-damp hair back from his forehead, leaning down to kiss him softly. "Don't worry, sweetheart. This one is just for short term play. Only for tonight. If you're a good boy, it'll come off tomorrow morning and I'll make it up to you."
And Tony knew. Was watching him carefully, waiting to see realization spread across his face, the tears fall. “Tony, Tony please!”
“That’s horrible! I’m so sorry, Buck. But we’re together now. We can… We can get away. Go home together. Be free.”
He groaned, closing his eyes, trying to hold onto some semblance of control. The machine varied the strength and speed of its thrusts in response to Tony's whims, and his hand never left Steve's cock, stroking him in rhythm with the dildo pounding into him, drawing release after release out of him, until Steve lost track of how many times he had come, sensitivity so great that every stroke was torture.
He smiled. "Yes, sweet boy. I had something brought in earlier. You do like to take care of me, don't you?"
Tony ran his fingers through his hair, trailed gentle kisses over his temple. "I love you like this. So sweet for me. You're my good boy, aren't you?"
Before Steve could ask what he meant, Tony was stroking him to hardness, coating his cock in a thin slick substance. A tube was slid over his cock, a soft hiss coming from the mechanism as it tightened down around him, followed by a humming sound. The slick material around his cock began to shift in pulsating movements, feeling almost like a mouth sucking him. Steve moaned, hips jerking down against the surface of the frame as it continued steadily. “T-Tony…?”
The fingers retracted, allowing him to breathe a sigh of relief, but returned a moment later. Instead of a finger pushing through his cervix, it was something else. Not much thicker, but less pliable than flesh. High pitched cries were torn from him as the entrance to his womb was forced open and held that way by some form of torturous plug. He jerked in his restraints, hips working frantically to shake the horrible thing free, but it was too late. It was jammed securely inside of him, triggering another round of cramping as his body unsuccessfully tried to force it out. He shuddered uncontrollably, but nothing else happened. He tried to feel relief, but knew Tony wouldn’t make it that easy.
"Yeah." Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's waist, pulling him closer. "Have I mentioned lately how absolutely perfect you are?"
“Yeah, okay. Just be careful if you decide to shred anything else. I’ve got some stuff down below that I’d like to keep.” He ran his fingers through Steve’s hair, kept him close, until the last hitches smoothed out of his breath and the tension drained from his muscles. “Feeling better, sweetheart?”
“Good boy. So polite.” He pushed Steve back against the bed, straddling his chest, and gripping him hard. Pushing his pecs together roughly around his cock. It did look a lot like a woman’s cleavage. Like breasts. And then Tony was thrusting between them, moaning, careless of anything except his own pleasure. Using Steve like an object that existed solely for that purpose. It shouldn’t have been as exciting as it was, but it caused his stomach to twist tighter with arousal. He was so close. So close to coming despite the cage, but he couldn’t quite reach it.
As soon as Steve had earned the privilege of clothes, he demanded to accompany Tony to every gala and dinner. The first one was difficult, being surrounded by so many people, unsure of how to act or his place among them. But once he relaxed, it went surprisingly well. Steve had the natural talent of putting people at ease, something he put to good use to further his mate’s interests. He rarely saw Bucky at the events, but was guaranteed to have a good time when he did.
“Offer me your neck, sweetheart.” Tony chuckled cruelly when Steve tilted his head to give Tony the side he marked earlier. “Oh no. Other side, omega. That’s what you want, isn’t it? All bitten up by a possessive alpha?”
Steve drifted awake to the feeling of soft kisses being trailed over his forehead, his cheeks, and finally his lips. He allowed himself a moment to savor the gentle caress before blinking his eyes open to smile up at Tony.
Tony slowly removed the plug, setting it aside, taking a moment to watch Steve’s entrance clench and relax. He scooped a large amount of the pale pink cream on his fingers, carefully sliding them just inside the twitching rim. His slick glands were easy to find, so badly impacted from years of neglect that they were hard lumps just inside his passage. “Ready sweetheart?”
Tony walked to the couch, grabbed a cushion and dropped it on the floor beside his chair at the table before sitting down. He gestured towards it, watching Steve carefully. It had been years since Tony had the luxury of taking a submissive, but the wanting never went away. To have someone at his complete mercy, bound up with ropes and begging him to let them come. The desperation as he would tease them for an entire weekend, sometimes longer. He’d never been able to picture the Steve Rogers he’d known like that, but this one… Tony was willing to bet that he’d love it. Want more.
Tony could feel his orgasm building, getting closer. He tightened his grip on Steve’s hair, holding him down as he came, pouring down his throat and forcing him to swallow again and again in a desperate attempt to breathe. Tony waited until Steve was tense and trembling, anticipating the moment Tony would release him, slide free and let him breathe unimpeded.
Tony sat in one of the chairs and patted his knee. “C’mere honey.” Hesitantly Steve walked over, allowed Tony to pull him down into his lap. He couldn’t meet the soft brown eyes staring at him. “You still mad, sweetheart?”
Once he’d recovered and tucked himself away again, Tony turned his attention back to James, palming the remote and slowly increasing the vibrations to the highest level. A ragged gasp escaped his throat before James came, convulsing hard enough to tumble to the floor. He continued to shudder and moan as the vibrations didn’t cease, writhing from the oversensitivity before his hips began to grind down against the floor, straining to force the toy deeper. Tony continued to let it pulse against him, until James came a second time, a scream tearing free as he spasmed again and again, before Tony finally turned the toy off. He continued to writhe, the bumps of the toy rubbing over him with the frantic movements, wringing a third orgasm from his overworked body. James finally collapsed against the floor, spent and satisfied, reminding Tony of a jungle cat. He almost expected him to purr. Maybe next time.
Steve gripped the cage, desperately trying to bend the metal, pull it apart, anything to escape for even a few minutes. He could feel the surface shifting under his fingertips, moving until the metal was wrapped securely around him, not allowing any freedom for him to pry it off. Tears slipped down his cheeks as he felt Tony’s firm grip on the back on his neck. “Tony… Please, no more. I can’t…”
Steve gasped as the metal of the cage slid over his length, crying out as it tightened around him in a punishing grip until he went completely soft before locking with a click. His hips churned desperately. This was worse. This was so much worse than when he used ice to force him to go soft. This was just the right kind of pain to make him ache and want and need. “Tony! Tony, please…”
Steve stretched languidly, reaching for Tony before he remembered the other man kissing him goodbye and urging him back to sleep earlier that morning. Instead he rolled over to bury his face in the older man's pillow, breathing in the scent of him. After their playtime the night before, he felt relaxed. Settled in a way he hadn't expected.
“I absolutely can. We need to do it at some point anyway. It’ll be better for you after you adapt to the cage, shrink down a bit. Then you’ll be more focused on releasing like you’re supposed to, and not trying to come like an alpha. Now, move. You know the consequences.”
The other change was Tony. He still worked, often times obsessively, but he tried to make sure he was there whenever Steve needed him. After the gala incident, Tony had given him full access to everything in the tower, except for areas restricted for his own safety. He started to become a regular fixture in the alpha’s workshop, curling up on the sofa to read or draw while the genius was working. Steve eventually became bold enough to drag Tony up to the penthouse when he’d gone to long without food or sleep. Rather than becoming angry, it seemed to amuse him. Though Steve quickly learned the best way to get his alpha upstairs was to suggest going to bed early.
When he was completely buried in Bucky’s body, Tony paused, tangled a hand in his hair and pulled his head back. Tony’s lips brushed softly over his, another claim that Bucky was eager to offer up. Tony began to move inside of him, holding him in place, dark eyes focused on his face. Watching him slowly build to another devastating orgasm, trembling in his grasp. Bucky could feel his balls tighten, cock throbbing relentlessly against the metal. He was sore inside, unused to penetration. His prostate overworked and aching. But Tony obviously wanted him to come again, so that’s what he would do.
Steve spent a few days after their night at the club turning the experience over in his mind. This led him to a single conclusion, and he decided to act on it. After bringing lunch down to Tony and Bruce in the lab so the two scientists might remember to eat, he took the elevator to Bruce's floor of the tower. The elevator stopped, but the doors didn't immediately open.
Steve stumbled after him, uncertain of where they could be going that would require this level of preparation. All thoughts left his head once they settled into the backseat of the car. As soon as they were moving, Tony turned in the seat so he could watch him, a pleased smile on his lips. His eyes glowed blue for a brief moment, the same color as the arc reactor, and the plug buried in Steve's ass buzzed to life, stealing his breath, and leaving him writhing against the smooth leather seat. "How- How did you do that?"
How could he live blithely in the past playing house with Peggy and ignoring everything around him. Leaving Bucky to be tortured. Howard to be murdered. An unending death toll that would once again be his fault. Steve didn’t know how to escape the guilt he already carried around with him, much less anything more. It would break him. In the end, the answer was simple.
Tony gently deposited him into the water, kneeling beside the tub. He retrieved a soft washcloth from beneath the sudsy water and began slowly cleaning every inch of Steve’s skin with soft strokes. Strokes that were going to feel more than comforting very quickly.
Steve finally allowed himself to relax, leaning against Tony's shoulder once everyone had settled inside the tower to wait for dinner. Loki was curled up against Bruce's side, in careful conversation with Thor, who didn't seem to care who Loki's lover was, only that he was being treated well. He closed his eyes, knowing that Tony would continue to keep an eye on the situation.
Tony grinned. “Oh sweetheart. I don’t need to touch your cock to make you come. Why don’t you let Steve distract you a little bit. I think you deserve something nice.”
"You don't have to say anything. I just... You could have gotten hurt today. I could have lost you. And if that happened, and I never told you... I would never be able to forgive myself."
“I don’t think you do. And I haven’t had a chance to play with these gorgeous tits yet. That’s not fair to me, is it baby?”
He rolled over onto his back, leaned up to capture the other man's lips with his own. Tony relaxed down until he was stretched out on top of him, leisurely kissing him until his lips were swollen. Steve drew in a breath when they finally parted.
Steve let out a sharp cry, almost another scream, body arching high enough to lift them both off the bed as he finally found release. It seemed to last forever, causing his vision to white out as he dropped back to the bed, muscles trembling. Tony rode him down, squeezing tight around him. "Come on, baby. You can go again. You're still hard, I can feel it. One more for me. Come on."
Steve moaned when Tony removed his plug, sliding into his slick passage easily. Reaching around, he lightly stroked Steve’s cock, occasionally rubbing over the head. Steve began clenching around Tony’s cock as he hardened, rocking back and forth between his hips and his hand. “See? I told you if you were good, I’d let you come. I’ll always take care of you, sweetheart. If you’ll let me.”
Steve rubbed his face against the collar of Tony's robe, trying to stem the flow of tears. Felt soft kisses placed against his hair. "So... What does this mean? I mean, what does it do?"
Steve felt the bed dip under Tony's weight as he sat down beside him. He took his time, running slow fingers over Steve's body, teasing brushes, learning where he was most sensitive. He felt the other man move, straddle his lap, and lean down to start blowing soft puffs of breath over his nipples. Steve had never realized they were quite so sensitive until Tony began to toy with them. At first, it was light breaths and fingertips, then it became hard suction and pinching. He moaned, arching into the sensations. Tony's touches became rough, almost careless, but that only served to make Steve harder, writhing under his touch.
“Such a sweet boy for me.” He snagged the blanket from the end of the bed, wrapped it tightly around them both. “I didn’t push you too far, did I?”
Tony flashed him a sharklike grin. “You just leave that up to me. But answer me one question, sweetheart.”
“That’s what I thought.” Tony cupped his chin, turning Steve’s face up so he could kiss him, slow and deep, until with a sigh Steve went limp between them. After they broke apart, Tony buried a hand in James’ long hair, holding him still and plundering his mouth until he was shuddering helplessly. Satisfied, Tony slid further down the bed, pulling the blankets carefully over all three of them. “FRIDAY, lights down please.” He let out a pleased sigh as darkness fell around them, tightening his grip on both men. “Good night, my beautiful boys. Sleep well.”
"Yes, Sir." The words uncoiled tension he hadn't been aware he was holding, allowing him to relax into the restraints. He didn't have to think. He was here for Tony.
Steve didn’t fight him when he moved back between his legs, trembling but not struggling in the restraints. Tony kept a gentle hand resting on his calf, knowing the contact would be soothing. He was as gentle as he could be, working each gland until it gave, giving Steve a break after each one, praising him constantly.
Steve closed his eyes and buried his face in the blanket, idly listening to Tony moving around behind him. He sighed, relaxing into the touch as slick fingers probed at his hole, gently stretching him open. A soft whimper escaped his throat as the fingers retreated, but they were soon replaced with the smooth coolness of one of the many plugs Tony liked to slip inside of him. This one was a little smaller than the ones he usually used, and Steve's muscles clenched around it greedily.
“Yeah Stevie, I was. I couldn’t get my Da’s voice out of my head. I thought listening to my instincts made me a failure. Better than our biology. Wasn’t that what they always told us?”
Steve slowly drifted back to awareness, rolling over onto his back on the silk sheets. His skin felt hot and tight, his cock throbbing almost painfully in the confines of the cage. He wanted to rip it off and stroke himself until he came over and over again. The yearning coiling in the pit of his stomach was so intense it was almost unbearable. Never in his entire life had he felt anything so strongly. The slight breeze, the feel of the silk beneath him, were both enough to have him squirming on the bed.
From somewhere far away, Steve could hear the soothing murmur of Tony’s voice, feel the gentle stroking of his skin, but it wasn’t enough. The throbbing in his core kept building, a frantic pulse within him. He had a moment of fear that it was going to rupture, explode and leave him more damaged than he supposedly already was. Time had no meaning. It felt like hours as the torment continued. Occasionally the electric pulses would stop. He could feel Tony removing the plug, only to fill him with another dose of the cream before replacing it. Then the shocks would start again. Over and over, until he had screamed himself hoarse and run out of tears.
Tony strode away from him, disappearing into a closet, leaving Steve to strip off his clothes with shaking hands. Now that it was really happening and too late for second thoughts, he began to feel the chill of fear creeping through him. He’d thought he knew what kind of man Tony Stark was, but this wasn’t the version he’d known. This Tony was cold and commanding. There was the distinct possibility that Steve would end up dead by the end of the week, but even that was a relief in its own way. He was standing naked in the middle of the room, shivering in the cool air when Tony returned.
Steve broke, the tears pouring out of him, sobbing like his heart would break. It was too much to ask of him, but he couldn’t say no. Couldn’t disagree with the man wrapping his arms around him and pressing soft kisses to his face. He would do almost anything for Tony to want him as his omega, to keep him. “Tony…”
Steve studied his face, searching for any hint of a lie. He couldn’t find one. And he was so tired. “Alright.”
The toy was dragged out of his body, passage clenching tightly around it, trying to keep it buried inside. More tears fell when it slid free, leaving him empty and wanting. “Please, alpha. Please. I need it. I need it so bad.”
Steve keened, hips slamming back against Tony's, fucking himself desperately on his cock, squeezing around him, until he finally felt him spill inside him. A relieved whimper slipped from his mouth as he fell over the edge after him, only a few droplets spilling from the tip of his cock, and he collapsed against the bed, completely spent.
Steve was just about to make his suggestion when he was interrupted by Jarvis’s smooth voice. “Captain Rogers, there’s a delivery for you in the elevator.”
Steve smiled. This was familiar territory. Late nights when neither of them could sleep, talking over hot drinks in the kitchen. "Guess away. I promise it's not aliens invading New York this time."
“It increases their sex drive. Makes them pretty much insatiable, actually. It’s why it’s recommended for difficult omegas. I put James in a suppression cage afterwards, to get him used to how his body was supposed to work. He hated it at first, but it was the right descision.”
Tony walked to the doorway, turning back to gaze at his helpless omega, bound and at his mercy. With a thought he flipped the sybian to the lowest setting, reaching down to squeeze his cock at the resultant cries of pleasure.  Taking a breath, he forced himself to turn and walk away.  He could monitor Steve from the lab. He had work to do, and Steve had a long day ahead of him.
“Tony!” Steve’s eyes were wide and pleading. “No. Please. Please don’t leave me like this. I need you. I need you so much…”
The blows paused again, leaving Steve sobbing into the pillow. The crop was set down on the bed, then Tony was reaching beneath him, cupping his soft cock in a warm hand. “Well this won’t do at all. I want you to enjoy our playtime, sweetheart.” He began stroking Steve’s cock, thumb brushing over the sensitive head, relentlessly working him to hardness. The pleasure soon began to eclipse the pain, driving him higher and higher. When Steve was trembling on the edge of release, Tony stopped, picking up the crop and landing devastating blows to his sore hole until he went soft again.
Near the end of the first week, Steve woke early to Tony murmuring his name against his ear. "Come on, sweetheart. Wake up for me."
"Spread your legs for me. Wide." Steve spread his thighs apart as far as he could, feeling the strain in the muscles. He knew what was coming, or at least he thought he did. Tony moved away again, and Steve didn't have the energy to lift his head to see what he was doing. All of his concentration was taken by the burning in his ass, the throbbing in his cock, the ache of his balls trying to pull up against the loop of metal holding them in place. He felt metal wrapping around each ankle, holding him spread wide. Tried to close his legs and felt the bar between the cuffs holding him open and exposed for Tony to play with. "Built this one too. Thought you might like it. Do you, Steve?"
Tony woke him the next morning with slow kisses, exploring the depths of Steve’s mouth as though they had all the time in the world. He loved it more than he could put into words. The feel of his alpha’s lips moving against his, gently dominating him, made him feel weak in the best of ways. He couldn’t help the way he clung to Tony’s shoulders, or the soft whimpers that were immediately swallowed by the other man’s mouth.
“Okay. We can do this one of two ways. I’m going to take the ring off. I can either make you come again.” Steve’s eyes widened in panic. “Or, I can give you a small shot that will make you go soft. That way I can get you all locked away and safe.”
“I do try. Bucky says I look out of place in it though. Probably because he’s known me as the scrawny little beta for most of his life.” Steve shrugged with a smile.
“What more could be wrong with our boy? He’s heartbroken and sick, and he barely moves when someone talks to him. It’s like… he’s dead.” Howard shook his head and closed his eyes.
As the agents backed down, Steve relaxed some, but he was still on edge. His stomach churned just a little; worried about the truth of what happened to his omega, the love of his life whom he missed so much that it physically hurt. He knew what that feeling was. It was the start of mate sickness, and Steve figured that Tony had gone though it most of his life if he had chosen not to move on from the super soldier alpha he had fallen in love with.
Steve tossed his shirt to the side as he approached Tony. "I don't get drunk. Doesn't have any effect on me since I had the serum injected into me." His eyes grew dark as he towered over the omega, a low growl filling the room while he started working his pants open.
Steve wrapped his arms around Tony and smiled. "Let's go, then. I haven't played Mario Kart in ages, so I'm ready to get my butt kicked."
Maria’s heart broke as he watched her son cry in pain and anguish and frustration. She knelt next to his bed and reached over to wipe away his constant stream of tears. “I think it’s time we go to the hospital… It’s clear you’re not just sick.”
Howard was running after several more minutes, heart beating rapidly in his chest as he feared the worst. He was about to assume the worst and go find Peggy, but he heard a cry for help, one that didn’t sound very strong, and sounded vaguely like Tony.
Nearby, at the tent next to the medical tent, a head poked out, dark hair messy and dark circles under eyes as the omega looked around, curious about the commotion. And then he spotted Steve. Jacket torn, face dirty and streaked from dried sweat, but it was Steve. Tony let out a sob with a smile, pulling back inside his tent and dressing in loose clothes and boots before running out and calling out Steve’s name.
“Tony!” Clint gasped before stretching to grab the box that held his hearing aids. Quickly, he put them in and turned them on, “What?”
“No!” Tony ripped his arm from Peggy’s grip, grabbing hold of the front of Steve’s jacket. “You can’t go, Steve. I don’t want to be left behind. You promised you wouldn’t leave me behind…”
Tony thought he had been doing well since his mother had taken care of him. He’d been drinking enough water, eating right, getting exercise when he felt extra good. He’d been doing everything right for nearly three weeks. He truly had been living the best life he could without Steve being around. Tony had felt happy and healthy, despite missing his alpha. He had blamed everything that had happened after Steve left on depression, because it was a plausible explanation. It was the only thing that made sense, in his mind, that made him feel terrible.
After Steve left, Tony stayed on the bed a moment, letting out a breath. “...I want his knot again…” he muttered before rolling off the bed and starting to gather his clothing from the day before. Not bothering to put them on, he slipped out the hidden back door that took him to the back of the club where small dorms were located for the omegas who worked there.
Steve’s shoulders noticeably fell. Tony and Peggy could only see his back, but his whole body language changed in mere seconds. The omega stepped forward and put his hand on Steve’s arm, offering any amount of comfort he could. Hearing the news that his best friend had died was very hard on the young alpha. Then suddenly his shoulders lifted again, blue eyes piercing as he looked at Phillips.
“You’ll let me dress you?” Tony asked, running his fingers over the rack to get an idea as to which section had the softest options. None of them were as soft as Tony’s chosen pair, and the colors available were quite limited compared to the omega section. While the omega section had a full rainbow to choose from, the alpha section seemed to consist of dark green, black, grey, and navy blue. Though there was some maroon as well. And, well, maroon was close enough to the bright red Tony loved, so he pulled out a decently soft pair of maroon pajamas and held it up to Steve.
“Shh, I’m sure you did all you could, my love,” Steve tried to reassure. “Me disappearing was tough on you, I can tell. It broke you, and I regret my decision in that light, but sometimes… sometimes things like this just happen. It’s not your fault, Tony.”
Tony was greeted with the smell of breakfast cooking, which made him smile. His stomach growled loudly, and he wondered if whoever in the kitchen could hear it from where he was on the stairs. The omega soon found his mother and Jarvis both working hard to make a breakfast of eggs, bacon, and pancakes. All three foods sounded absolutely delightful to the omega, and he almost moaned at the promise of real food again, as opposed to the snacks he and Steve had shared during his heat. Briefly, Tony tried to remember how good his heat was with Steve in rut, but he couldn’t remember much. He dismissed the thoughts and cleared his throat as he entered the kitchen.
“Tony, you come back here right now!” Howard started following his son, but he was abruptly stopped by Steve, who actually
Steve glanced over at the car, then jumped in as fast as he could. He was barely sitting down before the car was lunging forward again, which made Tony gag a little. The quick motions weren’t kind to his stomach.
Tony nodded, cheeks a bit pink. “Yeah… Some of the guys wanted to help train me… uh… it’s a long story.”
“They work well enough, but Tony wants to get his hands on them to upgrade them for me since I could barely afford the cheapest ones. But he doesn’t have the tools he’d need so I live with it and try my best not to let them get damaged.”
"Come on, Captain. Let's get you readjusted to the modern age, then we've got one more thing for you that we think will make you feel a lot more at home."
Just when Steve thought he might be close enough to come from the throbbing in his ass alone, Tony stopped. He settled against the bed, clearly in Steve’s line of sight, unfastening his pants and freeing his cock. He was almost close enough for Steve to touch, but not quite.
Tony kept him on his lap for a long time, petting over his skin and through his hair until he felt drowsy and sluggish. Once he was relaxed, Tony gripped his hips, slowly urging him to turn, settling him with his back against Tony’s chest.
“And what happens afterwards? When you’re finally forgiven? Do you go back to your world? Leave all this behind?”
"Alright pretty boy, I'll take care of you. I always do. There's lube in the box, get it out. I want you to prep that pretty little hole of yours for me. Hands and knees. I want to see you do it." As he spoke, Tony casually reached down, tilting the phone so Steve could see him, stretched out in the hotel room, naked and stroking himself.
"There, there. You're such a good boy for me. Here, onto your back. Let me get you cleaned up." Tony's hands were gentle as he pressed Steve back onto the bed. A soft warm cloth cleaned him up, causing him to shiver as it brushed over his sensitive cock and ass. "Almost done. Just a little bit more. Anything I want, remember?"
Tony continued talking about chemical compositions and the DNA modifications of the super soldier serum, but Steve couldn’t follow it. His entire attention was taken by his prostate. It tingled and throbbed, felt almost swollen within his passage. When Tony’s fingers brushed over it again, he almost screamed from the sensitivity. A few gentle circles had Steve trembling on the edge of the orgasm his body had been aching for all night.
Steve blinked against the tears he felt well up. Had to swallow before he could speak. "I... I want to be yours. I want to stay yours." The last words were a whisper. "I want you to lock it. Please."
He claimed Steve’s mouth in a heated kiss, and all he could do was cling to the other man’s shoulders. The elevator doors opened and Tony dragged him into the penthouse, towards their bedroom. Steve managed a whine of Tony’s name as he was pushed back onto the bed, and he began fumbling with the straps, releasing them and sliding the dildo free. A rush of slick followed, soaking the sheets underneath him, and Steve’s face burned with embarrassment.
“You can, and you will. You’re too sensitive for me to touch, so we’re doing it this way. Don’t worry. I’ll take care of your pretty tits and neck later. Get my sweet omega releasing nice and easy for me, whenever I want.” Tony stepped back, settling himself in a chair facing him, unfastening his pants and freeing his cock, eyes never leaving Steve’s body. He began to slowly stroke himself with one hand, the other still holding the remote, pushing the setting two clicks higher as Steve watched helplessly.
Men and women were dressed in leather, gauzy fabrics, or nothing at all. A woman was on a small stage on one side of the room with a naked submissive strapped to a bench, paddling him for her appreciative audience. A girl dressed in a few layers of sheer white material was crawling on her knees behind the man who had her leash attached to his belt. Others were in conversation with obedient subs kneeling by their feet.
"Wonderful. Go into the bedroom. Bottom drawer of the dresser. I want you to strip down and pick out something in there to wear for me. Come back when you're done."
Tony’s eyes glowed that beautiful blue that Steve couldn’t bear to look away from, and a soft click sounded from the cage. He felt the metal sliding away, exposing his cock. Steve was so oversensitized, had been locked away for so long, he could feel every gust of air against his skin causing him to writhe against the sheets. A low ache throbbed in his shaft as it hardened almost immediately.
Between their excursions around New York, and the time spent over coffee or tea chatting quietly in the safety of the tower, Loki began to slowly open up to him. The picture he painted of his prior life was unrelentingly bleak, even with the moderated descriptions offered by him. Steve knew how to read between the lines well enough to understand exactly what they were protecting him from.
“That’s right, sweetheart. Feels good, doesn’t it? I bet you’re so tight and hot inside. Wrap around me so sweet I’d never want to leave. Is that what you want, Steve? Good boys do get rewarded, don’t they?”
Tony cut him off. “No. I don’t. I want to. Now, do as you’re told, sweetheart. Remember: I can and will punish you. And I don’t have to hurt you to do it.”
Steve jerked futilely at the restraints, wracking his brain for the answer, serving only to shift the clamps back and forth, putting more pressure on his nipples. He could feel come oozing from his cage, dripping down over his thighs to join the mess of slick beneath him. His body was on fire, and no answers were forthcoming. “I don’t know! I don’t know! Tony, please!”
“The alpha bites them, usually before or during sex. Hard enough to rupture the bonding gland. And then that’s it. Sometimes a really possessive alpha will take both glands, make sure the omega can never bond with anyone else.”
He carefully eased the tube around Steve’s soft cocklet, until the end was pressed flush to the skin around it. As soon as he began twisting the knob, increasing the pressure and dragging the trapped flesh deeper into the tube, Steve’s attention flew back to him. Another turn and the vacuum began to pull and stretch the sensitive tissue, causing Steve to thrash and jerk his hips, trying to dislodge it. But it was too late. The grip was strong enough that it didn’t come off, despite the frantic movements.
Tears brimmed again, as Steve gazed adoringly up at his alpha. His mate. “You’re… This is just… Everything I always wanted, and was so sure I would never have… No one ever chose me. Except for you. And it’s…”
“Okay. Just a second.” Tony disappeared from the room, returning with the plug in his hand. Steve rolled onto his stomach, pushing up onto his hands and knees, a feeling of rightness rushing over him as he presented for his alpha. He moaned as the plug stretched him open before settling into place, keeping his alpha’s come safe inside of him.
It didn’t take long for Steve’s body to begin throbbing with need, his passage growing slick around the plug. Tony gripped the base, sliding it free, replacing it with his mouth. Steve moaned, pressing back into the feel of warm breath and a hot tongue moving over his entrance. He was already so worked up, combined with the enhancement drug, he was releasing in moments, crying out in satisfaction. The assault on his hole never let up, Tony’s tongue dancing around the delicate skin, occasionally dipping inside to brush over his slick glands. Building Steve up to another shattering release.
Soft cries fell from his lips as he was slicked quickly, then the fingers were pulled away and the head of Tony's cock was pressing into him, rubbing against the swollen tissues, pressing hard against his abused prostate. Hard fast strokes, building him up again. It didn't take long for him to start meeting Tony's movements, wanting the other man deeper. "Please? Please!"
“Institute full lock down procedures for my omega. Steve does not have access to anything beyond the penthouse unless I am escorting him. And no one other than myself has access up here when he’s alone.”
He stared out the window, desperately hoping for Tony’s return. When he was prompted to get ready for bed by the AI, Steve burst into tears, then slowly prepared himself for another sleepless night. He hadn’t seen his alpha for the entire day. It was a clear rejection that weighed heavily on his aching heart. Steve obediently stretched out in his designated place on the bed, waiting for the restraints to fasten. When nothing happened, he curled into a ball sobbing as though his heart were breaking. Steve was a bad omega. He didn’t know how to obey, or please his alpha. He was too much work and the other man had obviously decided that he was no longer worth the effort.
“You bet your sweet, tight ass I’m gonna make you come.” Tony moved down his body so he could unbutton and unzip his pants. Steve lifted his hips to aid in the removal of his jeans. Tony pulled them and his boxer briefs off in one tug. Steve kicked them off and pushed them to the other end of the couch.
“I don’t blame him.” Steve took the drink from Tony who looked at Steve like he had grown a second, Chitauri head.
“We don’t know yet.” This was a stupid idea. What had Steve expected to get out of this? Peace? Calm? “But whatever the purpose is, you have every right to be alive.”
“...Steve. A lot of what I said wasn’t about you either. That was all...” He did not wanna bring Howard into this. Not right now. Not without a drink. “That was my own shit. I know you were special before Rebirth.”
“Please.” Steve wanted to take the word back as soon as it left his lips. Tony didn’t say anything, just moved into his space and wrapped his arms around Steve.
“Oh, yeah.” He thought he heard the sound of a wrench or screwdriver hitting the floor. “I was gonna order Chinese and watch some old Star Trek episodes. Thought maybe you’d like to join me?” Steve took a long draw of his cigarette and sighed. He should say no. He should tell Tony that he had other plans or he was leaving the country. Steve was just about to say something like that but his mouth had other ideas.
“Of course you would. You’re you.” Tony sighed. “Look, I know I’m the last person who should be lecturing on mental health or a decent sleep schedule. I mean, we are both sitting out here at...J, what’s the time?”
“The food has arrived just now, sirs.” Tony jumped up from the couch and jogged to the elevator. The doors opened and someone handed several bags to Tony.
“What do you want for lunch? Old or new?” Tony pulled his phone out. Three new messages from Pepper. Nothing too terrible then. It could wait.
“Every time I look at it, it reminds me how soundly we all kicked his ass.” Tony’s voice came from behind him and he turned. Tony and traded in his jeans for more comfortable looking black sweats and his dirty tank top for a worn AC/DC t-shirt. He must have taken a quick shower too because his hair was damp and sticking up in different directions.
“Post-traumatic stress disorder.” Steve closed his book. No amount of magic was going to save him from this conversation. “Of course SHIELD wanted me to see a therapist.” They couldn’t exactly have a traumatized super soldier running around. In the middle of a mission and having a total breakdown because the sound of bullets took him back to the battlefields of France and Germany.
They hadn’t talked about or made any mention of the kiss since it had happened. But Steve noticed that Tony no longer hesitated when he went to touch him. And Tony was very touchy. They were all simple, friendly touches but any time Tony touched him, Steve could feel his heart race. Tony surely didn’t mean anything by them. And Steve had to stop reading into things. The guy grew up in a different time than Steve. Two men holding hands wasn’t automatically gay or even a crime. Steve had spent a couple sleepless nights reading all about Stonewall and toxic masculinity and second wave feminism and the sexual revolution. It had been fascinating. And he was a little sorry to have missed it.
“Old, familiar, vintage. You know, pizza, burgers, hot dogs on Coney Island. Or new. Sushi, ramen, pho, fusion cuisine. Shwarma.”
“Relax, Steve. It’s the name of a Star Trek episode. One of my favorites, in fact. Now, keep in mind this show is from the 60s so it’s a little dated by today's standards.”
This was it. His life had reached it’s pinnacle of absurdity. He had thought that happened 70 years ago. Or maybe even when he kissed Tony Stark and begged him not to go back to California. But no. It was here. A modern diner made to evoke nostalgia for an era he had never even lived through. A Russian spy that had defected to the United States. A product of a war he had not fought in. Music playing through the speakers that was considered old but was all new to him. And what did he want to do with his life?
Tony still tasted like oil and sunshine. But the coffee was traded in for cheap beer and sweet and sour pork. God, what the hell was he doing? Tony kept pulling Steve in deeper, pulling him forward until Steve was practically on top of him. He bent his knees up to accommodate Steve between his legs and his brain short-circuited.
“Tony...” He didn’t know what Tony heard in his voice but he seemed to understand. He stroked his hair again.
“Everything tastes different.” It was small. Subtle. And maybe if Tony didn’t have a huge crush on the guy he wouldn’t have even noticed. But unfortunately for everyone, he did. Something about the way he said it was just...sad? Sad or maybe nostalgic. Either way, Tony wasn’t sure the hole in the wall Indian restaurant was the best time or place to have any kind of deep heart to heart.
“Steve, you could run for president if you wanted to. And probably win.” Natasha shrugged. “It’s not a matter of qualification.”
“You. Fuck, Tony... Want you. Please.” His face was burning and he would probably feel ashamed about all of this later. Probably. Or it would fuel new dreams and nightmares. Because somewhere, in the back of his mind, in the part that was still able to think clearly, Tony was not his to keep.
“Thank you, sir.” Steve turned and left the conference room. The meeting was pretty much exactly as he had expected. Washington, DC had been a bit of a surprise. But then again, where better to have a shadowy, government agency? The FBI, the CIA, and SHIELD. Each one more secretive than the last. Still, Fury had a point. What was Steve going to do otherwise? He couldn’t stay at the Tower forever.
Tony grabbed a handful of his hair and pulled him into a searing kiss. Fuck, he was hard and making out with Tony Stark on his couch in the penthouse of Avengers Tower. This, this was the height of absurdity. He might have laughed if Tony hadn’t rolled his hips and moaned into Steve’s mouth.
“Touch me. Want you...want you to touch me. Make me come.” He watched Tony’s eyes darken and felt his cock twitch.
“Suggestion noted, J, thanks.” Tony stretched his arms up and then fell back into the couch, his head resting on Steve’s shoulder. “My point is, you don’t have to fight all by yourself. You’ve got resources and people that care about you.”
“I don’t think you should.” Tony shrugged. “I think you’ve earned a vacation, Steve. Jesus, you’ve been working nonstop. You had just woken up in a new century and they were shoving the shield back in your hands and shooing you out the door to fight aliens!”
“I killed aliens from outer space, fought a demi-god, wrangled a team of super humans, and did it all without his direction or supervision. I’m fine. He wants Captain America, he can ask me himself.” Steve picked up another bag from the floor and hung it up. The touch to his shoulder was a surprise.
“Well, no argument here.” Tony smirked and gently knocked the side of Steve’s head. “Still, it would be a pity to muck up that pretty, pretty face.”
Steve rested his head against the punching bag. He was tired of hearing this crap. When would everyone just drop it already? This was his life and his shit and he didn’t need everyone telling him how fucked up he was. As if he didn’t know. Like he wasn’t the one with the perfect memory, reliving it all over and over again.
“Yep. Did you see what they are doing to War Machine? It looks like Iron Man and Captain America had a love child.” Tony laughed when Steve almost spit whiskey. “It does!” He picked up his phone and pulled up a picture. Tony held up the phone for Steve to see the picture and...well...he wasn’t wrong.
“Sorry, Tony. Guess I’m not really all here.” Steve swirled the amber liquid in the glass. Most of the time he felt that he wasn’t all here. Part of him was here. Part of him was back in 1943. Back in the freezing cold winters of Europe. The roar of the planes. The crunch of the ice and snow under the tanks. The Commandos huddled around him for warmth like he was a bonfire. Bucky’s bloodshot eyes stared off into the distance.
“Can’t. Too busy lookin’ at you.” Steve gripped his hips tightly for a moment before he started to push Tony’s shirt up. Tony took over and pulled the shirt over his head.
“I don’t know, Tony. I feel like most people care about Captain America. Not sure they give a damn about Steve Rogers.” He leaned his head down to rest on top of Tony’s. “After all, I’m just a man out of time.”
“My point is that despite having almost no experience working together, the whole team worked seamlessly. It clicked. I don’t need you running point on a team that doesn’t run missions all the time. I need you running point on this team.”
“It has been 76 years since my last confession. Not since Ma died.” There was a stunned silence before the priest cleared his throat.
“You are. And you still will be. But we don’t need the Avengers on a weekly basis. Hell, I’m hoping we’ll never need them again. That isn’t likely to happen, though. Still, a monthly meeting outside of world ending crisis should be plenty to keep the team afloat.”
“My gym, tough guy. Thought maybe you’d like some company. You been comin’ earlier every damn day. Might as well move in.” Johnny held open the door for him and Steve ducked in. The lights were already on and, thank God, coffee was brewing.
“I mean, not those specifically. But like, we should do stuff. Watch movies, go to dinner, get your hair cut.” Tony ran his hand up the back of Steve’s neck and into his hair. This seemed like it may be crossing the line from friendly into...what exactly? “It‘s a little old-fashioned.”
“Well, he was freaking out. So yeah, it was urgent.” Tony gently pushed Steve down onto the bench and released his hands. Steve looked down at his hands, still shaking.
“Did we?” Steve sat back in his chair. “Bruce seemed pretty sure of what he was saying. Maybe he didn’t wanna say it but...he meant it. I guess I meant it too. But not about you.” Fuck. Shit. Shit. Goddammit. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Tony was going to have to actually apologize. Because apparently Steve had taken what Tony said in that stupid lab to heart. Apologies were not his thing. He apologized to Pepper once in all the time he had known her. He made her a shitty omelet.
“I like that.” Tony chuckled. “Field trip, that’s cute.” He yawned and Steve couldn’t help but smile. He was in so much trouble.
“Someone saw me struggling to use the computer at the library to find history books. They helped me with that and then said it would be faster to Google everything.”
"Oh.. neat" Tony answered back as he saw the camera had been covered up with a pair of black boxers... with arrows and bows on it. Tony was guessing it was clint's, and that was a scary thought.
After they'd all sat down, and finally began to eat Bruce’s delicious korma (Like really, was it even legal to make such good food?). They were now in a very heated debate over chicken. Fried chicken more speficially.
"Shut up Legolas, it’s not my fault i wasn't expecting to feel a fucking fuzzy head while being kidnapped." Tony answered, but they both knew he wasnt a bit irritated that Clint was there.
Because the first one is of Tony and Clint kissing each other, and the second one is of Tony and Steve, talking while Tony plucks sharp glass out of Steve's hand.
"Yeah, like, he looks at Steve like he hung the moon. But when either of those idiots come in a one meter radio of each other he immediately steps back. Or gets up from the couch, like what the fuck?!" Clint exclaimed, finally letting his irritation at the whole situation come out in one, big, messy, sentence. Natasha slowly closed her book on the bookmark that she had conveniently placed beside her, then stood up and went over to her mirror opposite the bed.
Steve silently thanked whatever god was up there when Tonys hearbeat started slowing down, and the irritating beeping of the machine winded down, beacuse he was dangerously close to having a heart attack after all.
"Hmm, we'll see about that." She says, moving closer to quietly whisper the plan into Clint's ear, afraid that JARVIS would hear and tell on them to Tony. Never mind that JARVIS is just as tired of having conversations with Tony on how soft Steve's hair looks or how nice it would be to feel his abs than the rest of them.
"Oh fine, come in then- She said, and when Clint opened the door she was sat on her bed. A book payed beside her and she had her hair up in a messy bun. Looking very relaxed and welcoming, but Clint knew that somewhere in those sweatpants, a sharp knife was hidden and he would really rather not find out where.
But Clint knows her mind games and that that is just a threat. That is also why Clint swallows very loudly and quickly scurries out of her bedroom before she strangles him with her hair. He's seen her do it on a AIM-officer before and he would
So he promptly decided that he would have to find his own way of entertaining himself. And there really was only one thing that would do just that.
After Bruce had told them the most illegal thing he had ever done, Tony reveled much more about the most explicit thing he had done with honey than everyone wanted and Natasha swiftly escaped telling everyone what actually had happened in Budapest. It was now Nastasha's turn daring Clint to do something, and they all were a bit tipsy, except Bruce. Since Sam had proclaimed himself an amazing bartender and Tony of course taking that to the test.
"Tony opened his top 3 buttons on his was-white-once-upon-a-time shirt and started screwing on something on the arc reactor. He finally got it loose enough to connect the red cable into a small socket and twist with an old, rusty plier. Once that was done, he sat back and started slowly counting down from 30.
"I shall do whatever you deem necessary!" Thor proclaimed, as he had, after the first times, now completely gotten the hang of truth or dare. And after Sam said his dare it was simply a matter of time before the god of thunder prank called the pizzeria down the block to claim that his pizza had come without any sauce or cheese on it. And after that it was just all in since the metaphorical ice that hadn't even been there from the beginning now had completely been crushed.
"Stop. Trying. To run." Ty says, which comes out as a growl and an order. No room for arguing. He then tries to grind on Tony, who opts between staying completely still and struggling against Ty's arms.
Because Steve was as red as a tomato, and had a utmost scandalized expression on. That was just too good to not laugh at.
Surprisingly, his bedroom was empty when she peered her head around the doorway, welp, that only left one place, the shooting range.
With that final thought, she left to go shower and change into new clothes. The gym doors closing behind her with a gentle swish.
Tony held the eye contact a few seconds longer and then looked away, just as the guy/girl/whatever he was dancing with got pushed to the side and a pair of caging arms took the other ones place.
Tony had never been more happy to see/hear Clint than what he was now. Or, well, Clint was usually the one to get takeout on the way back to the tower and Tony just really loved his fried chicken. When he had declared his love towards both Clint and fried chicken, saying that he would marry Clint while standing
Steve walked into the apartment and finally let Tony down onto an old couch. Tony gave a content sight and cuddled closer to the homey and warm feel of the fabric, what he didn't appreciate however was the pain in his ass, or the stinging from where Ty had punched and kicked him. Just as he was going down the very depressing road Tony felt the sofa dip where his waist was and he opened his eyes to Steve's worried face, he had a wet towel with him and were going to put it on Tony's forehead.
"Ohh, okay we doing it the rough way, not the biggest fan of BDSM but it'll do, very nice arms you have here, I'm sure you've had to torture very many innocent people to get where you are now."
Steve went into the changing room and soon shouted that he needed a bigger size, at the same time that Bruce was done with a pair of pants so Tony and Clint both went out into the store to hunt for a bigger size and to leave the pants of it’s hanger.
"Oh hooo Clint you are getting in troub-le." Sam claimed a bit slurred since the drinks he mixed was made up on vodka, orange juice and one of Thor's mysterious cocktails which made everyone a bit fuzzy in the head.
But, now Steve was off about some morally right shit that nobody cared about anyway and they’d sat in the same spot for about an hour and a half. So nobody could blame Clint for becoming a bit bored of it all.
"What? Hold up, hold up, hold up. Why do i have to fly with the suit? I was in god damn capity?" Clint exclaimed, once again irritated.
That's why, when the call came in that Fury had, to everyones surprise (and slight worry). Canceled their usual tactics talk, the Avengers were over the moon about it. And they decided that a casual and completely random shopping trip would be a perfect way to celebrate it. After all, what could possibly go wrong?
"Nope, I'm hanging this in the front room." Clint countered. Still very much not over the fact that the public thought he and Tony were a thing.
He finally started to strech out and when his arm hit something warm and fuzzy he may or may not have let out a very manly scream. And if that didn’t wake up whatever it was then the flailing arm that hit it’s head certainly did.
"Oh come on, not again, didn't you already knock me out? Dammit, i swear to god one of these days I'm gonna make sure to get Bruce with me, or Thor. Eihter of them works just fine."
"I'm getting-cutlery, yes.. be right back." He stammered forth, as he was making his very obvious retreat. If he thought he was making a very planed and calm exit, he could dream on, everyone knew what he acually was going to do. Except for Tony, it seemed.
A bit of winding and grinding later and everybody in the room had gotten into it, Except for a certain popsicle. Who had gotten quiet as soon as the dare was proposed and now seemed to be planning his escape. As the song was about to end Clint decided that it was now or never, and promptly started making out with Tony, who, was
“So what do you actually have?” Tony asked Steve while idly looking through khaki-pants in mostly different shades of military colours.
"What the fuck is this? And could you please shut up? Getting hit with a metal pole isn't the easiest to cope with. Jezz"
Out in the hallway it was eeirly quiet, the only sound being Clint’s steps and the sound that dragging a body across the ground did. On the plus side the air was much more clearer and Clint could finally breathe again. He took Tony over his shoulder, but not without warning the guy that his sense of gravity was about to be completely off.
I thought i would apologize right off the bat for not posting chapters. Its been a bit over 2 months since the last one and I'm trying, but school is a pain in my ass and I've just lost all my motivation. But I'm back for now at least so let's make the best of it.
Bruce, who had been sipping on what Natasha thought was a glass of water, started chocking on it as soon as she said arc-reactor. Of course she couldn't see him but unless he was getting a blowjob, he was chocking on something. Maybe he was giving a blowjob? No he answered when she asked him something, so he was definitely just drinking something.
"Yeah, no, not deleting that Capsicle. This is fucking gold." Tony said, who had since recovering from his laughter-attack. Gotten up and was on his way towards the doorway. Probably time for another 36-hour shift in the workshop. That only Steve could break, weirdly enough.
The elevator came to a stop and she got out, immediately entering the kitchen and connected living room off Clint's floor. The place was empty, which it usually was unless he was either sleeping, in his private shooting range or angry at the team for some reason which she absolutely had no idea of.
He dropped something on the floor in front of him, which looked like a circuite-card and some tools, and a big piece of metal. Tony just stared down at the pile and then slowly trailing his gaze up towards Clints face.
After picking out a couple of shirts as well, they shuffled towards the changing room where Bruce already was stationed trying out clothes that Natasha had picked.
This, of course looked like they were halfway there, if you get what I mean. Steve, finally broke and threw the bowl of chips on the floor and stalked away towards the elevator. The sudden noise stopped Tony and Clint and everyone turned towards the doorway where Steve had just gone through.
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU DON’T LIKE FRIED CHICKEN??!" Tony and Clint exclaimed in perfect sync at the now pretty alert Steve Rogers. Meanwhile Bruce who had just been taking a bite of his food would soon find curry-rice in his air way.
Hello again! Well its been almost a year and i swear to myself i did not intend to make you guys wait for this long, i have been thinking about finishing this but with school, sports i play and friends i simply haven't had that much time and my inspiration levels have been at 0. But now i am finally doing the last bit of the tony and clint part and then we're on the run up chapter of the end :)
Steve just shrugged, and while he still looked like he just dropped his icecream. He didn't have that devastated look anymore. And it got better when Tony leant into his personal space to lightly pluck away all the leftover bits.
When they arrived at the exit of the underground bunker, Clint was pretty fucking done, so no one can really blame him for falling asleep, he was going to travel for about an hour in the suits arms, so why not yanno?
.” Tony said while watching Natasha take out her brand new Stark-phone (disguised as a blueberry, of course).
“Ok boys, say cheese” Sam said and just a second later the flash went of and the photo saved itself on the camera roll.
"No can do birdbrain, we’re either too far away or underground, and even if we were in the radius then it could take up to a day or more for it to arrive." Tony answered, a bit distracted as he was clipping a few wires apart and inspecting them.
Anyway, that really wasn't important now because he had been chattering about doing something as a team for a while, so this would be right up his alley. Also she could easily convince Steve to drag Tony and Bruce up from the depths of hel-i mean their labs and workshops. Thor was also easily convinced, just say that there would be pop-tarts at the location. And you could guarrante that he would be there.
What they didn't notice however, was how Natasha and Bruce quickly ushered everybody out of the room. And Natasha stopping just in the doorway, taking a quick picture of them.
"Blergh.. hmm, hmm, uh, yes?" Bruce answered once he was done chocking, and Natasha nodded once and looked up again, to see a new wave of very-darkly-clad-and-generally-bad-looking-guys walk towards them. She got into a fighting stance immediately and they were off again.
Natasha smiled to herself where she was sat, curled up in a bean bag with Bruce on her right and Sam on her left. Tony was breathing deeply into the mask while trying not to burst out again, and Clint was on the floor rolling in laughter.
"Barton, you fucker, help me get the glasses down or so help me god I will punch you square in the face."
And that's when he heard the first cough, then a second, third, fourthfifthsixthseventh all followed in rapid speed after each other. He looked up, and Bruce was, of course chocking on the curry that he had sample-tasted just seconds before Tony's ass-wiggle, thankfully Thor came to the rescue and thumped Bruce on the back a couple of times before Bruce finally got the coughs down.
"Sir yes sir" Clint answered all whilst standing up and moving slowly towards the genius-billionaire-philantropist. The playboy had suddenly stopped being a playboy after his 30eth birthday. "JARVIS, music please" Just as the first beat of a very,
“Great!” Tony took Steve’s drink and set it aside with his own before he took Steve’s hand to lead him out onto the dance floor.
“Sounds like we’re a match, omega.” Steve picked up the pace just a tiny bit, moving his hips back further until he was almost pulling all the way out of the omega.
“This is an upgrade I’ve been working on for hand prosthetics. It's still in its infancy and you can see how it kinda looks like those sketches you made. The next render won’t have all these lines at all, but this stage….it still has all the potential in the world. It has room to grow and develop into something great. There’s no restrictions of problems to work around yet. It’s simply possibilities, as all projects are in the beginning. And that is what I want to think of when I see the mural you’re going to paint! Endless possibilities for innovation, for the future. You could perfectly render my newest completed project in the painting, but that will soon be outdated. With this style,” Tony tapped Steve’s sketches, “it will always speak to the future while also honoring the past and present.”
“I can definitely make you that way,” Steve said with a spark in his eyes. “I’ll make you come so hard you’ll see stars.”
The summer day that letter came was a joyous one for the omega. He went running through his home to find his mother and tell her of the news, and they celebrated by going out for ice cream and then swimming when they got back home. Tony went to bed happier than he had been in several weeks, and both Maria and Jarvis were happy to see that.
Tony watched her leave before closing his eyes with a light sigh. He hated how he felt. He was in pain from his injury and his body craved an alpha to mate him. Quite possibly the second to worst situation he had ever been in, being held hostage by that man being the first.
Once everything was inside, Jarvis insisted on Tony eating with his mother as his things were taken up to his room. The omega was too tired from the long day he had and the stressful heat he had been put through to care too much. He gladly joined his mother at the dinner table for food, which he scarfed down as quickly as he could handle. The last heat had also come with a stomach ache, one that wouldn’t go away no matter how many times Steve knotted him. That was why they only knotted twice, spending the rest of the time either curled up in bed or hunched over the toilet and throwing up basically nothing. Tony’s throat was left raw afterwards, and it still was as he ate real food for the first time in days. If he was to be honest, he still had a bit of a stomach ache.
Before Tony could do much else, Steve pushed him away slightly, suddenly having a very serious look on his face. “Tony, I need to talk to you before your next heat. This is important, so I need your full attention.”
The omega was quickly reduced down to just moans and whines, taking all of Steve at a merciless pace. There were no signs of the alpha slowing down, and Tony couldn’t say he was disappointed by that. The longer the alpha went, the better Tony felt.
“Obie, this is my date, Captain Steven Rogers. Steve, this is my Uncle Obie I believe I’ve told you a little about?”
“I don’t want to talk to anyone, Peggy,” Steve responded, shifting forward to hold his head in his hands.
“Then I suppose just a trim is in order. You can have your longer hair, but there’s no need for it to look unkempt all the time.”
“Well, Brucie-bear certainly got lucky with finding Thor, and I’m hoping I did too with you.” Tony purred at Steve.
“If they have anything for you,” Maria continued, “I’m sure it’ll be more scandalous things than normal every-day clothing.”
Maria shook her head and brushed back some of Tony’s hair. “Looks like you need a haircut. Your hair is getting long, unless you’ve been trying to grow it out for Steve.”
The two exchanged unsure expressions, but Peggy sighed and nodded. “Okay. Just don’t let your fear consume you, especially not here.”
Tony whined again when he tried to follow Steve, but Peggy caught his arm and started pulling him the other way. “We don’t have time, Tony. We need to get to the hangar.”
Steve sighed as he left Tony standing alone for just a moment. He grabbed some ammunition and one of the chorus girls' helmets, the one with the A on it. "We better get going."
Steve caught a whiff of Tony’s scent, making him groan deep, his body shifting into rut to compliment Tony’s heat. He closed his eyes and relished in the feeling before opening them again and moving his hands, spreading apart Tony’s ass cheeks and leaning down to give the waiting hole a lick.
“You’re not going with Captain Rogers, but you can watch me work for a while if that will make you happy.”
“Well if this one is as sweet as you say,” Thor said, “then I should think there would be no problem with jerks anymore.”
“You look so beautiful,” Maria said, cupping Tony’s face with her hands. “You used to complain so much about having to dress up for these parties, you know.”
"I can't say I'm upset at her. She did save me from my boredom." Tony shrugged as he looked up at Steve. "But that was very smooth."
Peggy and Tony met up again when they couldn’t find Steve. She sighed and hugged herself. “This is turning out to be harder than I thought,” she said, stepping closer to Tony. “I’m assuming no luck on your end.”
story of an alpha and an omega. This was how most of those stories went. The omega sees an alpha and falls in love, the alpha slowly realizes that and finally accepts the omega and they have wonderful and magical sex together.
“I know you’re the one who gave me the ring,” Steve said, his voice full of emotion. “But I feel like it’s only right that I ask you this, since it seems you’re ready for it.”
“Thank god,” Tony said with a sigh. “Steve, can we take a break after you clean us up? Your rut is amazing and I love it, but my body can’t handle it as well out of heat.”
Tony slammed his hands onto the table with a frustrated noise. “I can’t believe he kissed her back! She’s just a beta, she wasn’t even that attractive!”
Reluctantly, Steve shook Justin's hand, though he offered no smile. "Captain Steve Rogers. And I'm sorry but I have to disagree with you. Tony is a phenomenal omega, smarter than I'll ever be. Who am I to stand in the way of his success?"
After about an hour of waiting, Steve's knot finally deflated enough to let him pull out of Tony, a load of slick and cum dripping out once it was released. The alpha groaned and stretched before slipping off the bed, intending on making a warm bath for the omega to clean himself up with. Of course Steve would be helping, because there was no way he was going to force Tony to clean himself up.
“Tony, you’re insane,” Steve called out while going left, keeping up with Tony in case the shielding mechanism failed so he could move in to protect the omega.
Steve looked at Tony, noting the fire in his eyes that wasn’t there a month previous. That was when he knew Tony was ready and could handle the battle. He nodded. “He’s ready.”
Once Obadiah walked off to disappear into the crowd, Tony sighed and turned to smile up at Steve, “Sorry about him. He’s been kind of like an overbearing parent ever since I lost my parents. I think he forgets I’m not a teenager anymore.”
Steve got to show off his new ring later that day to Maria and Jarvis, Tony donning a similar ring that he had claimed was a scraped design for Steve’s ring, but the scrapped one seemed to fit Tony’s finger perfectly, so Steve wasn’t going to rule out the possibility that Tony had made his own matching ring to go with his own.
Steve didn’t respond right away, simply blinking as he processed what Tony had told him. “A baby… Our baby? Biologically?”
Slowly the months went by as the seasons changed from Summer to Autumn, temperatures gradually getting cooler as the new season settled in. The ocean waters put off colder breezes, causing morning runners to bundle up on their daily jogs before shedding all that clothing to adjust to the days that were still rather warm. August turned to September, October, and November, the heat of the day finally relenting and setting to a more comfortable range for anyone who participated in outdoor activities.
Steve sighed and looked back at Tony. “Our next show is in Philadelphia, then New York City after that.”
Tony stopped and thought to himself. He called Steve his alpha. The brunet smiled like an idiot as he entered the base with his father. God, if only Steve could see just how happy Tony was in that moment. Maybe he would smile and kiss Tony in front of everyone, showing Howard just how much they meant to each other. Maybe Steve would push Tony against the big table with the map on it and kiss him until he was practically lying on the table, shirt riding up while the big alpha had him trapped. Tony could almost feel just how hot he was getting, or rather how hot in his daydream he was getting. Looking up at Steve, seeing those intense blue eyes roaming over his body, stopping at the bare skin of his stomach showing, flicking back up to give Tony a look that sent shivers down his spine.
"What happened?" Tony asked in a shaking voice once he had calmed enough to gather his thoughts. "Why… why is it
Tony tensed up a bit. Steve’s movement send a whiff of his scent floating to the omega’s nose. He shivered and grunted lightly. The liquid suppressants weren’t really doing their job properly with a newly presenting alpha standing right next to the omega in heat.
With Steve tugging off Tony's pants, he managed to turn the brunet and push him down onto his back. The end result of these actions was Tony laying naked on the cot, knees brought up while the omega peeked around them at his alpha. Steve looked down at him with need, feeling his clothes get tight as his body reacted to Tony's scent. He took off the top of his costume, which he had even started to admit was ugly, and tossed it to the side, exposing his chest for the first intimate time to Tony. Next came his pants he wore on top of the costume, and the boots and socks. Lastly, his costume pants came off, leaving him in his briefs.
There was silence, and Peggy never got a straight answer from Tony, because Colonel Phillips stuck his head out of the top of the tower and called out for the two.
“I think that would be wonderful. I blame my grandparents for my taste in that music. They listened to it all the time when I was around them, so I ended up liking it.”
Steve handed it to him and watched him open it. “It’s a bunch of assorted chocolates. I hear those are good snacks during heats.”
Once they both were packed, they left, Tony leading his friend by the hand to where Steve had said his car was parked.
It was a few minutes later when Tony came to, groaning when he shifted and felt Steve buried deep inside him. The alpha was still holding himself up above Tony, and when the omega looked up at him with wide eyes, Steve growled softly.
“Splendid!” Thor turned to the living room and approached the couch, his smile seeming to get wider and wider. “I’m here Bruce,” he crooned while shoving his nose into his omega’s neck.
A flock of birds suddenly burst out of the trees, cawing and screeching as they fled the Hydra base, and then the radio next to Colonel Phillips crackled to life, giving the command that the team had been waiting for.
The alpha snorted, then he claimed a kiss that was as possessive as it really could be, leaving Tony moaning and picking at Steve’s clothes. Since they both had Tony’s room available for their privacy, the two had taken advantage of it and had some intimate times outside of Tony’s heats. It was nice to not have to worry about using protection to prevent a pregnancy outside of heats. Tony was sure glad he didn’t have that extra amount of anxiety to worry about while the war was raging on. Pregnancy was the last thing on his mind, and he hoped the same was true for Steve. Besides, Steve had to worry about being Captain America first and foremost.
“No, baby, you don’t need to be sorry for this,” Maria responded, her own voice cracking with emotion. “You did the best you could.”
Flying to Malibu had been relaxing and serene. They were on a private jet that very clearly had a logo for Stark Industries on the side of it, which had excited Tony greatly when he saw it. It meant that Howard had achieved something absolutely fantastic while Tony was sleeping away the years. Tony was sure that he was going to learn more about Stark Industries in the near future.
Jarvis took away the new clothes to wash them and make sure they were ready to be hung up in Tony’s closet in the morning. It was well into the night when Tony found himself sitting outside with the butler, sipping on glasses of whiskey while looking up at the stars in the slightly chilly night.
When they parted from the kiss, Steve leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Tony, head resting at the omega’s heart. It was an action that let Steve be vulnerable, something he didn’t show to just anyone. Even in normal moments when they were alone with each other, drawing or reading a newspaper, Steve was never this vulnerable. This was a special side of Steve that only Tony got to see, and Tony cherished it.
“We need to talk,” Tony said after he had settled down enough to simply hold onto Steve’s shirt and close his eyes to relax. His alpha’s scent was doing wonders to calm him, but so was the crooning that filled the room. “Somewhere else though. There’s… a lot of private things we need to discuss.”
Soon entering the terminal, Tony frantically looked around, and before long he spotted the family butler he had trusted so many secrets with over the years. He nearly burst into tears at the friendly smile Jarvis gave him as he approached. It was hard not to just drop everything and run into those welcoming arms.
"Yes, you did." Steve offered his hand to the older man, putting on a fake smile. "Nice to meet you, Sir."
“Hey, I’m sure you’re fine, honey,” Maria said softly, rubbing Tony’s back. “Just relax, and let it out if it needs to.”
“It’ll never be the same…” Steve sighed as he stripped down to just his underwear, grabbing the pants of his uniform.
Steve had to hold himself back from completely taking over and having his way with Tony. The omega was truthfully the most attractive omega he had ever come into contact with, and he didn’t want to risk losing Tony as both an ally and his personal omega by taking over too quickly. Still though, he at least let himself touch Tony ‘s cock and stroke it, just to show who was the alpha in the room.
The alpha was getting antsy the further into the medical facility they went. He just wanted to know where Tony was. He had woken up in a strange new time period, and not one person even mentioned his mate’s name since he woke up, which had to have been close to an hour already.
When the plane finally took to the sky, Tony whined, stepping forward and clutching Steve’s dog tags tightly to his chest. A feeling of emptiness filled him as he watched the plane for as long as he could until it was just a speck in the sky.
There was a long pause, neither Peggy nor Tony knowing what exactly to say. Peggy was the one to break the silence after several seconds.
Tony was curled up under a pile of blankets and shirts, all the shirts belonging to Steve, though they had long lost their scent of the alpha. The omega’s usually bright and curious eyes were dull and sad, puffy from bouts of crying throughout the day. It was a sight that broke Howard’s heart, but he knew his pain of seeing his son so sick was nothing compared to the heartache that Tony was experiencing. The poor omega was paler than his sheets and thinner than he had ever been. He looked like he was barely alive. The only sign that Howard had to know his son was still alive was the omega’s gaze switching from the wall to the new visitor.
"Oh trust me, I'm not new to the area. But… I could go for friends and drinks. Been getting tired of just painting and then going straight home."
Steve, feeling Tony tense up, pulled his hand away quickly. “Sorry… I think I need to get used to being an alpha before I try touching you again.”
Steve blinked and went stiff for a second when Tony jumped into his lap. “Uh… I’m not really a fan of parties. Too many people for me, but… I might be willing to go with you.”
The hug lasted for a good while before the three pulled away from each other. Maria was the one to break the silence when they all had a chance to wipe away their tears.
Finals went very well! I passed all my classes for the semester so I'd call that a win lol But here's the next update for yal! There's just a little bit of everything in this chapter. Fluff, smut, angst, you name it. Enjoy, and Happy Holidays!
Tony looked at himself in the mirror and popped his collar up once more, adjusting the tie underneath and flattening the collar back down. He sighed, wishing his mother, or at least Peggy, were there to help him make sure he looked properly dressed for such a big date. At least the tailcoat he wore was flashy enough. It almost touched the floor, billowing out more like a dress than a tailcoat. Tony had grown to like it after Peggy had bought it for him, plus a matching pair of pants. The whole outfit was certainly formal, but it definitely had an omega tone about it. Usually Tony didn’t like most outfits omegas were sold, but this suit that Peggy had gotten him somehow was something he actually liked, despite the slimmed waist of the tailcoat that was meant to exaggerate his hips.
“Can’t blame me!” Tony said, finally crawling out from behind the TV with his tools and putting things away, “The man’s too hot to not try to court! Plus he seems really sweet. I don't get sweet alphas that often. Mostly find the jerks. Or the jerks that pretend to be sweet. But I’m not worried of that since Rhodey already likes him enough to invite him over, and Rhodey always has a good sense about these things.”
Tony sighed as he looked at the drawing. The ache in his heart was the most intense he had felt in a long time. He wondered if he and Steve would ever recover from losing Bucky.
“These are the weapons factories we know about,” the alpha said as they stopped at the edge of the table, Tony standing just behind him. “Sergeant Barnes said that Hydra shipped all the parts to another facility that isn’t on this map.”
Except that he wasn’t at the same time. He, Steve, Peggy, and his father were all cramped underneath the streets of London in some secret base that held untold secrets from the world. Tony thought there were so many secrets that the world would never get the chance to know them unless a huge leak in information occurred. Which was highly unlikely because this base wasn’t known to the public. Hell, it also acted as a bunker in case nuclear war broke out. Tony hoped that would never be the case.
Maria came up behind him with Howard, and the three hugged before the woman moved over to the piano and played a classical piece for Tony for the last time. It was difficult to listen to, but Tony sat on the sofa with his father, listening to the beautiful song as the last hour of his birthday passed. Tony had no regrets in his decision, but knowing he would never get to hear his mother play for him again, never get to tinker with machines beside his father again, never see Jarvis and joke with him again, it all came crashing down on the omega as he sat on that sofa, and he cried until his throat hurt and his eyes were dry.
“He’s mine, Clint, not ours. He’s taking you with us because you’re my friend and wants you to have a better life, too. You’re free to look for your own alpha if that’s what you want. He said I can be free to be smart and you—you can play with weapons if you want.”
“Relax,” Fury said. “I know you want to know all about him, but we can’t really tell you much right now.”
Tony nodded. “You know, I thought I had a chance at becoming a good friend of yours, but that was before I realized you were going to become a freaking tree.”
It wasn’t long before their plane landed on a small runway, ready to unload all the supplies the Howling Commandos would need for their mission. Tony helped out as much as he could, carrying most of the lighter things, but only because the alphas could carry the really heavy things, which were far heavier than what Tony had ever worked with during his weight training. He was still an omega after all. Despite that, he worked as hard as everyone else to set up a temporary camp, not having to worry about if he might go into heat during the mission. The pills he was taking were working like a charm, and he nearly forgotten that he was supposed to have a heat due that month.
“Both of us? No more sitting in drunk alpha’s laps just so they can feel special? No more getting groped simply for walking by? And I’ll be able to invent things? And—and would Clint be allowed to play with weapons? He likes crossbows and stuff like that.”
“I believe there’s an opening a couple days from now. I can look at the schedule in the omega clinic back at the hospital and call to give you a time.”
. I plan on continuing to fight. I’m going to keep fighting in the war and do what I can, because I know I can do more. I was meant for more than sitting at home and behaving like a good little omega. I won’t act like an omega if I can help it!
Tony chewed on his bottom lip, staying silent until their food was finally brought to their table. Both alpha and omega thanked their waiter and started eating, striking up casual conversation between bites. At some point in the middle of their conversations, Tony felt the need to bring up his plan to Steve. He was prepared for the worst, to have his plan rejected, but he hoped that would not be the case.
Steve chuckled. “Well you’ve got time to relax now. Sleep if you can, I’ll get us cleaned up when my knot releases.”
Groaning, Howard stood up and placed his hands on his hips. "He risked that baby's life… and I let him fight."
“Yeah, I know,” the omega muttered, looking out the window at all the snow that had fallen in the night.
“Even if he is, I have to save the others. They’re all in danger still, and they don’t deserve to wait out the rest of the war to be saved.”
“More than miserable, but I see where you’re coming from,” Tony said. “You spent a rut without me and I spent a heat without you…”
As the plane started up, Peggy reached forward and pulled Tony away from the landing strip, careful not to be too rough. She knew he wanted to watch the plane go, watch Steve go. It was going to be a long night for both agent and omega, but for Tony, it was probably going to feel like the longest night of his life, especially if his heat kept him awake all night. When they were far enough away from the plane, Peggy put a hand on Tony’s shoulder, squeezing lightly to tell him she was there for him, she was going to take care of him until Steve got back.
“Good.” Steve sighed slowly and looked around at the other commandos, wishing they had more time to just relax, but the Hydra base was too important to wait too long to destroy. The sooner they took it out, the better, and all the commandos knew that.
The exasperated mother raised a hand to her forehead and sighed. “I’m sorry, Tony, I wish your father didn’t have to bring those topics up all the time, as if he doesn’t curse as well.”
“Don’t worry, I would never take a Stark omega to go dumpster diving for food. Though maybe for spare parts for new projects…” Steve smiled at Tony as the omega flushed.
Tony smiled and buried his face in Steve’s chest. He didn't know how he did it, but somehow he had scored a stupidly romantic alpha.
“Steve isn’t interested in my money, company, or social status.” Tony defended. “He likes me for me.”
“Finally?” Clint asked, stepping out ahead of the obvious new couple and settling himself next to the other alpha.
"One thing at a time, Tony," Steve said gently when the omega started to get worked up. "We've got a lot of time, we can do everything you want."
“It’s what makes me good at my job.” she said smugly before turning back to Steve, “I trust you’re fine with signing the basic NDA? You’ll be able to mention that you have a commission with us, just not any specific details regarding what Tony may show you or tell you about unreleased projects.”
“Of course I would have! Because you’re not safe out there! Young men your age are dying every single day out there in the battlefield, and I’m worried sick I’m going to see your name in one of those condolence letters that the colonel sends out.”
Steve shoved his pants down before approaching Tony, eyes focused in on the omega’s waiting hole. He couldn’t help but continue to growl, even as he trapped Tony on the bed and nuzzled underneath his chin, making pointless attempts to scent the omega. One knee went between Tony’s legs and pressed against the smaller cock.
“A very good plan. I’m glad you’re considering joining Hydra’s cause. Now, let’s forget all about the politics and whatnot, and let me fuck your brains out, omega.” The alpha moved to push Tony back on the bed, taking off the rest of his clothes so he was fully exposed. A growl filled the room as Steve caught the scent of Tony’s slick.
Tony shook his head, hot tears forming in his eyes. “No… no you’re not. You don’t care. If you did, you wouldn’t be greeting me with shouting and anger.”
"If you know your history well, you might recognize the name Captain Steve Rogers, or Captain America." Steve hooked a finger under the collar before kneeling before the omega.
"You know I wouldn't be opposed to sharing my room." Steve smirked back before the elevator chimed and the doors opened.
“I know. That’s when my next heat is due after this one, so if he does get to come in August, I hope he comes before my heat. Or during it. I don’t want to go through more than one without him now. It just feels wrong.”
“Tony,” Maria said in an exasperated tone. “I know this is surprising, but really, I don’t think you need to say things like that.”
, I wanted to put an end to the bullies. Joining the army and fighting in the war was the only way I could see me achieving my goal.”
“Hell you intimidate me already. I mean you’re the owner of a huge company. I’m just a simple painter.”
The two were hurrying to each other in the blink of an eye, Steve getting up so quickly the chair he had been sitting in tipped backwards. In seconds, Tony was in his arms and crying out loud, overwhelmed with emotions. Steve couldn’t help but bury his face in the omega’s neck, taking in his scent that was comforting in his time of need. Together the couple cried, mourning over Bucky and simply enjoying being back in each other’s presence.
“I want to learn. I’m willing to learn, and I want to fight. I don’t want to be a useless omega anymore.”
Wearing their pajamas already, Steve decided it was a good time to just go to bed for the night. So as carefully as he could, Steve picked up Tony from the nest and carried him to the omega's bedroom, setting him on the bed gently before pulling back the covers and tucking in the omega. Once Tony was under the covers, Steve got in the bed behind him and wrapped his body around the omega. After a stressful time at the gala, all Tony needed was some peace and quality care from a proper alpha, and Steve was determined to make the omega feel safe for once.
