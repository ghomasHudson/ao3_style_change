“Oh come now. We both know that’s just a title. I’ve always been in charge of that quadrant.” Pierce smiled, and Tony did his best not to tell him to shove off. Between this guy and Senator Stern, he’d been struggling to keep hold of the suits. If they’d had their way, he’d be under their payroll as an agent being shipped off to far countries till he eventually got blown to hell. He still remembered Stern calling him a prick. That had been fun.
This time he had a different set of escorts. This group of young women didn’t pay much attention to him but they didn’t seem too bothered by him either. He counted that as a win.
His feet connected with the lamp-post and before he could help it, he looked back at Steve with a grin.
He was pretty sure he could feel his heart break from that. This was their new norm. A careful balance between a fight and a treaty. A temporary truce.
They’d unzipped the top half of his uniform and had already scrubbed away and wrapped his torso in several bandages but he there was still so much blood Tony couldn't even see his chest. The helicopter nearby was starting to open its hatch and Tony figured they were getting ready to take Steve up to the Helicarrier for further support.
Steve had a pinched expression on his face. Slowly he put down his sheets and leaned back in his seat. “Tony-“
“Sure.” Tony said mildly, searching desperately for something in Steve’s eyes. Maybe some acknowledgment that he wasn’t just some agent but his near lifelong friend who-
Then, before Tony could say anything, Steve pressed a button under the desk and turned to the holo-screen that appeared in front of him. Agent Hill appeared on the screen.
“When you spoke to Pierce you looked at me like you...” Fury shook his head. “What did he say to you?”
Tony didn’t have the heart to tell him there was nothing like that for him. That his body had been washed of all that hope and joy and excitement. The promise of happiness that he lost all those years ago.
“See, this is the problem with you superhero types. You think you have rights to everything and that includes everyone.”
“It’s for you sir.” The young air-hostess behind him said. “The Commander has requested you put it on before arrival. There are several sizes in the back but he said to start with this.”
“Wait.” Steve said, and held up his hand higher. He wasn’t looking at Tony, still far too busy frowning at some unseen force on the ground. Then he lowered his hand and clenched it into a fist.
“Hey. What’s going on?” Steve said with what he hoped was a pleasant smile. Having worked with him for a short time however, they instantly seemed to pick up on how fake it was. Natasha simply shook her head and sighed.
“Oh, why yes, of course Stark! We do need to get on that, but don’t worry about that yet. If you could just complete the next lot I’ve sent, that’d be great.”
He repeated the mantra over and over in his head, and leaned his head back against the wall with a dull thud.
Steve wanted him to wear Captain America cuff links. And even the suit now that he thought about it was a really similar color to a stealth suit of Steve’s. Maybe it was a coincidence but didn’t he have a blue and silver battle suit? Tony was pretty sure he did but maybe he was mistaken.
"Tony?" He asked quietly, with something that sounded an awful lot like concern. Then his hands slowly began to lower and Tony instantly shot out to grab them.
Steve didn’t say a word but slipped his arm through Tony’s carefully. Then, with Tony’s arm linked to his, he gently pulled him forward, much like the couple in front. Tony couldn’t help but stare up at him in surprise. It was only thanks to his years of practice that his mouth didn’t fall open and he kept walking straight.
Minutes passed without a word. Zeke continued to mutter soft words of false comfort without stopping Tony. And slowly, the fog of Tony’s mind began to clear. And with it, the sinking resignation set in.
“Sorry, Cap. It’s better this way, trust me. You'll thank me one day.” Iron man croaked through the speakers and took off to the sky, not offering Steve a ride back like he normally would.
Slowly, he reached for his belt and removed it, steadying his hands against the rising shame. Steve watched him with laser focus but when their eyes met, just seconds before Tony was about to take off his pants, Steve’s gaze softened. It said one thing.
Needless to say, that conversation had ended with a long make out session and Tony having to fight for Steve’s sweatpants. Thankfully, he'd won.
Three weeks went by. Nothing changed. Nothing got better and nothing got worse. Life on the Helicarrier was turning out to be fairly uneventful, even after Steve's little display.
They’d discussed it last night. What exactly Steve was doing and who he was taking. Apparently the investigations department had collected various pieces of the robots and had taken them apart to uncover camera footage from each case. And the result had been pretty worrying.
"You're alive." Tony whispers and watches Steve settle into the bed with him. The bed dips when he lies beside him, and Tony can feel the heat coming off him instantly. It really is Steve. He really is
Steve didn’t hesitate then. He couldn’t hold back anymore and as a wave of emotions swamped his entire being, he slipped his arms around Tony and sat them both up, pulling Tony into a tight hug. Then he held on like he was afraid to let go and cried into Tony’s hair, keeping Tony close because this was the first time he’d gotten to touch him since Tony was trapped and they had been through so much even then and Tony was
“Do I really look that good in this?” He mumbled distantly and to his surprise, Steve barked out a laugh.
When they reached the punishment room, Tony heard Norman sigh. Suddenly he was reminded of the last time they’d stood in these positions. It was thanks to Norman that he’d even gotten a chance to leave the cavern. He should’ve thanked him for that.
Steve brought out the best in him, as he always did for everyone. He would always approach you with a smile and a clap on the shoulder and a compliment of some kind. Tony had always done everything to go above and beyond for that praise.
Grant’s head shot up the instant he heard the word. It had to have come from the man running towards him now at almost god-like speed, and in the distance, Grant noticed him holding his arm out with a large disk attached to it. It seemed to be brightly colored and detached as he lifted his hand up and swung.
Elijah and Zachariah both nodded and Tony couldn’t help but smile at the praise as he joined the line further down. It seemed things were really looking his way.
“Cap? Hey now.” Stark laughed nervously but Steve didn’t let go. If anything, he just pulled Stark closer. That scent...
“It has his blood on it.” He continued to echo, not daring to open his hand again, for fear that he’d see something else that would just break him. “It’s been broken off. Definitely his armor.”
It was Steve-living, breathing and in the flesh. No part of him was out of place and that was good-very good and Tony couldn’t ask for more. A healthy, happy Steve was just perf-
“Well I’m a busy man. Just because I don’t work for you, doesn’t mean I don’t work.” He replied, folding his arms too. He was exhausted from the journey and he didn’t appreciate the tone he was getting. Shield had called him, he came, what more did they expect?
Together they walked towards the corner of the roof, hopping onto the ledge to sit down comfortably. Below was a bit busier than Tony’s block, with several people clubbing together around some mummies.
Finally he sighed and threw his head back and stretched his body, groaning at the aches he felt. When he finished, he looked down at Tony who was still kneeling before him.
“Are you toying with me!?” Steve shouts because apparently Tony is adamant on ignoring him, even behind closed doors.
The suit felt cold on him. More empty, like he'd never be able to fill the space. The movements were somewhat jerky and unfamiliar and he had to double back a few times when he pushed too far with in the air. Simply put, he was out of practice and it showed.
“It’s the same.” He said rather curtly and didn’t really invite anymore topics. In fact, none of them really did. Tony was suddenly reminded of crickets after a bad joke, or a kid at school dinners saying they liked the crappy mac and cheese more than the chocolate cake. The silence was deafening.
Today’s the day. It’s been months and things have finally come to a head. Steve isn’t afraid to admit it anymore, even with the loss of many nights and days spent thinking.
Ben was stood in-front, and scowling, but when he met Tony's eyes he faltered. Maybe because he could see how livid he was.
“How did this even happen!?” Tony gasped, letting go of the rings and dropping his head in both hands, starting to feel a little giddy. Hysterical.
Tony played with idea in his head. He wouldn’t have to hunt as many humans, Steve did seem strong enough and-
“What’s changed?” Tony shrugs and holds out his arms. “I’m still the same. I’m still just a man who-“
“You and I. What we have. Is it...is it something you want?” Steve said and the words felt distant to him. But at the same time, they encompassed his very being.
The world was watching. The heat of Steve’s hand on his cheek was searing, even more so that the weight on his chest. If there was ever such a thing as claiming...Steve had just done it.
But this scent wasn’t doing that. On the contrary, now that Tony had managed to land and grab the man by his shoulders, he was certain there was a hint of vanilla in there. And maybe...pine?
While Pierce tried to get the bartender's attention, Tony scanned the crowd vacantly. He thought he noticed Fury staring at him with a deep frown on his face. Calmly, he smiled back and nodded.
But the medic just smiled softly and shook his head. “I won’t tell anyone, I promise. I think you’re doing a lot better now though.” He said and stood up. “Would you like to see him?”
“You did more than enough. You gave me a home, remember? You gave me a home Tony and I love you.” Steve said, just as shakily, and Tony wondered if they’d stumbled on a live wire.
“Hush now. You are so kind aren’t you? I understand Anthony but the rules are clear? What happens when you break them?”
So how could he just waltz into the tower and greet Jenny at the front reception? How could he keep sending emails to Mike in the R&D department when he’d soon make him jobless? How could he go back there and pretend everything was fine when it clearly wasn’t?
Tony felt his palms start to itch. It was a rare feeling but he hated being the center of attention here. It was the equivalent of getting a target drawn on your back.
“I like this fledgling vampire! He amuses me.” Thor remarked and Peter burst out in laughs. But Steve didn’t look at them for this. His eyes were only on Tony.
“Good.” He purred, loosening his hand a little. “Whitney will escort you to my room later. We’ll discuss your punishment there, pet.”
That alarmed Tony. How could anyone track Zeke? The bastard was so tricky, he’d once slaughtered an entire gremlin family without being noticed.
“Besides.” Ty purrs and pushes his drink towards Tony. “We both know he’s not your alpha. It’s an odd match. You and I make a lot more sense. I mean, he’s Captain America for crying out loud.”
"I nearly killed you. When we fought." He said, and paled as he spoke. "I had my shield raised and I was seconds away from doing the one thing I wouldn't have been able to live with. If anything had happened to you because of me-"
It took twenty nine minutes before they managed to reach the planet atmosphere. Mist surrounded the quinjet but thankfully the sensors did not let them down. With Carol and Thor’s help, they managed to land safely on the surface.
He decided to look around instead. With a sweeping glance, he noticed that the landing strip was completely empty of planes or any weaponry which was odd since even thousands of feet up in the air, the Helicarrier was still a target.
Before Tony could open his mouth to say anything, Happy had quickly turned away and was rushing back to the pavement where the car was parked. Soon enough, the engine purred and Tony was abandoned with only his gift in hand.
“He used to say Stark men are made of iron. And you know how I felt that day? Like crap. No iron, or nothing. Just crap. Because that’s all I had from him. I never got more. Thanks to your friend.” Each word was a carefully formed dagger that he aimed directly at Steve’s heart. It was only fair, he thought. Steve should suffer too.
Steve smiled and pressed a soft kiss to Tony’s hair. “That I can do. And maybe one day I’ll be able to give you what you want.”
“Y-yeah...” Tony whispered and felt Steve come around hold his shoulders and then drop down to lift him by his knees. What was happening?
“Thanks. How come you have so much first aid stuff?” Tony asked tiredly, gesturing to the pile of bandages and gels in the huge green box.
“I’m sorry Tony.” Steve exhaled, suddenly dropping his head in his hands. “That...I didn’t mean to lose it there.”
“Then how can it be you?” Tony croaks and wipes at his cheeks tiredly. “You don’t love me. You’re Captain America and you
They meet on neutral ground. Weirdly enough the Avengers had decided on the place of the incursions. The point where the worlds can be seen instead of a kinder horizon. Two points meeting, and seen from both sides.
That night, he flies back to the Helicarrier, the world feels quiet. There’s an unease stirring in the corridors as he smiles manically at the Shield agents for the first time. He knows they’re probably spooked by the image he portrays. His cheeks are damp and his eyes feel sore and in his shaking hand, the cracked frame is still there, plain as day for everyone to see. He looks like a mess.
“Give him whatever you need to. I’m his medical proxy, give him whatever you think will save his life.”
A loud screech of metal filled his ears like nails on a chalkboard. He mistimed a step and nearly tripped over the bent traffic light.
It was just pressing 11pm. He was kind of wishing he hadn’t skipped breakfast considering he hadn’t eaten dinner last night either. He hoped Clint would appreciate the new arrows he’d made instead of feasting on lasagna.
“Tony?” Steve asked, having paused beside his motorbike. He was frowning a little, but relaxed a bit when Tony blinked at him.
Just as Steve was about to say more, the com came to life in his ear again, and to his horror, Carol and Thor began to congratulate them.
“The Avengers, Tony.” And Captain America stares at him like he’s surprised. “We’ve all been working together for years.”
“Well in that case...” Dugan seemed to make his decision. He leaned back and crossed his arms casually.
Steve was stood in his full combat gear in the middle of the huge empty room. The inside of the warehouse was mostly empty, and Tony saw how the SWAT team working with Steve was mostly just inspecting the corners. Steve seemed to be fiddling with something in his hands.
”You know how Steve gets.” Tony explains as he lifts up his head and looks out of the cafe window. There’s couples wandering around holding hands. It’s the right day for it and many are smiling.
Maybe he could’ve been more once. Maybe he could’ve had something greater to offer. The world would never know now, not while he stayed in this cavern.
If he told Fury, it would only confirm what he thought, which would just be completely humiliating. And if he didn’t, Fury would just keep prying. So where was the middle ground?
When Peter laughed, Tony knew he’d passed the invisible test. Taking that as an invitation, Peter edged his body into the room and finally settled down in the seat beside the bed.
He ran and ran, feeling his heart race in time with his breathing. He continued to run for what felt like hours when he realized it had only been minutes.
Images of Stern and Sharon filled his head. One taunting and one bouncing with excitement. It must’ve shown on his face because Fury frowned again.
Shocked and surprisingly relieved, Tony sat down quickly beside Sam and tried not to feel too disappointed by how much Trish and Ben glared at the poor girl as a result.
“So this...invitation.” Tony began, finally feeling comfortable enough to broach the topic. He fidgeted with his cuffs.
His stomach felt warm and damp and he couldn’t feel any pill from his stitches anymore. His hands felt cold. His eyes closed and when he opened them a moment later, he realized he was lying flat on the ground and facing the ceiling.
The baby’s getting bigger too. His stomach is starting to swell more and he knows he won’t be able to hide this under three piece suits soon enough. And he can’t pilot the suit. Time for a break.
Tony’s heart sunk at that. It was a sore spot for him and one he’d really struggled with. He owed it to everyone to try.
”Or you could just order me two body suits and get me some normal clothes. I don’t always need to look like a good little soldier.”
“I remember.” Steve said loudly, focusing solely on Tony’s blank stare. On the dulled eyes that were far too empty. “I remember everything. Every word you said while you were trapped. And I’m not leaving you.”
“Nice catch.” Tony said quietly and felt his breathing shake when the hands around him squeezed and then let go. Steve let out a slow breath and stepped back, allowing him to turn around and face him.
“Tony...” Steve’s eyes glimmered and darkened a little. He licked his lips and Tony watched his tongue like he was hypnotized by it.
The woman didn't say anything else. Instead she glanced at him and bit her lip. Then she turned and quickly left.
Some people were also wearing army suits. Steve would’ve gotten away with it by the looks of it too, and Tony could see rows upon rows of medals on these people’s clothes.
They reached lower Manhattan. The buildings blurred around him. He dashed past humans and creatures alike, too fast to even be seen.
“Yes.” Steve said quietly, and Tony was taken aback by the seriousness of Steve’s tone. He looked deadly serious and like it wasn’t a joke.
“Right. Well...I’ve found them.” Steve took a deep breath and turned. To his surprise Tony was standing up and leaning against the island, with his arms folded and a small smile gracing his lips. His eyes danced with a warm glow and the scent in the air was so light and freeing. Underneath it was another scent that was bubbling in anticipation.
The next half an hour was spent navigating his way to the labs. He’d learned the route but it took time to get there from the quarters and his little trip to the cafeteria had added to that. All for food he was never gonna get.
“I’m ready.” He croaks and sniffs to hide the tears he didn’t know he had. One falls on Tony’s cheek and Steve hates that he now knows where those tears came from.
The realization made him groan and the sheer feeling of Steve beginning to lavish him with kisses made him dizzy. It took everything in him not to beg for more.
With a shaky breath Tony looked away and clasped his wrists brushing his thumbs gently over his skin. He didn't remove Steve's hands though which gave him immense hope.
Continuing to drain the man, Tony held him down until the man’s cries died out. When he started to slump, Tony pulled back.
"Tony?" Steve stopped instantly when he heard him sniff. Then he froze and pushed himself up to check.
“Steve?” Tony asked, then yelped when Steve yanked him close and tucked him into his chest. His nose nuzzled Tony’s hair and his chest rumbled happily.
It was just that he didn’t want Steve hurt. It was just that he couldn’t bear the thought of losing Steve again. And it was just the fear that he’d lose what they could have.
“My therapist says the same!” Tony exclaimed and instantly clamped his mouth shut when he realized what he’d just told Steve. Mortified, he ducked his head to hide how red his face was going.
“I know you’re trying to do what’s right. But this can’t be it. You have to see that.” Steve implored and reached out to clasp Tony’s hand. “You know I’m right.”
“Oh Tony. Come.” Zeke beckoned him towards the bed and patted the edge. “You sit and I’ll have a look.”
Tony felt his eyes widen. “You’re not gonna tell them? You have a soulmate and you’re not gonna tell them?”
"Don't you ever get up like that again." Steve heaved a sigh of relief and slid back into his place, running a hand through his hair as he did. "You scared the living daylights out of me."
“Sure, whatever you say. I could use the distraction. Although-” Stark tilted his head at him and frowned. "You don't have to help me. I'll be alright."
“Steven had something to say about that day too. He told us later, ‘I think I found somethin’ real special. I’ve never seen anything like ‘im!’. And I swear that boy was all teeth that day.”
“Wait here.” The tallest guy grunted and pulled off a com speaker from his belt. With a click of the button, he activated it, giving Tony a quick once over.
“Ah well.” Steve twitched uncomfortably under the scrutiny. “I’ve met them but they don’t know yet. It’s sort of something I plan to keep close to the chest for a while. I haven’t opened up the bond yet, and since they don’t know-“
He’s lost weight. He used to be stronger. He used to have a bright look in his eyes instead of this monster who is almost unrecognizable. Dim, faded eyes stare back at him, desperate for the next drink.
The family was not present. The father of the faction, Ezekiel was not present in the cavern at this time and so, as was common, the remaining members of the faction would squabble among themselves in a fit of rage that would only worsen with time. Tony knew it all too well and it was only because he had climbed the ranks, that he was fed enough to prevent that descent into madness.
“You’re exhausted. I think it’s good if you relax. I haven’t seen you like this in so long.” Steve murmured and when Tony blinked at him, he just shook his head and reached for the blanket, wrapping it around Tony. Then he slowly leaned back against the wall and adjusted Tony with him so they were side-by-side.
A moment passed between them. His fingers slowed down and just brushed over the silver of the little shields lightly. The metal was smooth under his thumb, save for the ridges of the shield.
“It’s okay.” Stark sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose as if the tears running down his cheeks had just been incidental. “You don’t need to stay. Please.”
“Well thanks. I guess I’ll just head out.” Tony finally settled on, though he was sure it came out as more of a question. Thankfully the woman nodded and so he turned and darted past Steve, only turning to do a quick check and, yep, Steve was following him.
“Wait a minute. I know you.” The man frowned and had a good look at Tony. He was close enough for Tony to simply lean down and bite but...
“Some of the instructions might be in Russian. Or Portuguese-“ Steve’s eyes started to crinkle as he watched Tony quickly rummage through the bag, taking some of the orange bottles out to stare at them like they were gold-dust. Some of the corners of the labels were peeling away but somehow, Steve didn’t think that would matter.
“I...did you-“ Tony shook his head and blinked back against the burning sensation in his eyes. “Did you see what he-what he did?”
“Next week!?” Tony cried out, and wanted to smack himself for his own stupidity. Horrified, he clapped his hand over his mouth.
Tony sighed and continued to eat in silence. He shouldn’t be sat here enjoying this. The shoes were for someone else to fill and it wasn’t him.
They engaged in a fist fight, one hand swooping in after the other. Zeke managed to land a few blows but something in Tony’s veins was giving him an edge. His reactions were that much quicker, and his claws were that much sharper. His heart raced in a way that made his hands tingle.
Feeling exhausted, Tony simply nodded, letting his smile fall. What was the point in pretending? Everyone knew him anyway and everyone clearly wanted him gone. Maybe it was time to leave.
Steve raised a hand to the panel by the screen and pressed the call button. “Sharon, Maria, confirm?”
“Oh, Tony.” Steve whispered shakily and ever so gently brushed his thumbs against his shoulder blades. His skin buzzed and felt burning hot under the touch but it was Steve’s voice that really hit.
“It’s John.” Tony’s look-alike grumbled and soon enough it was just Tony and Steve left. And they hadn’t backed up.
The day just got better. After their meal, Steve took him down to see the team. After a few bear hugs and some terse apologies from Thor, he sat down to watch the team train and was surprised to find himself agreeing when they asked him to join him when he felt better. Carol was the most relieved when he said yes.
“Of course there would be certain stipulations. For instance, I’d have to restrict your access to some of my designs and of course, your designs would have to be signed over and your suit would need to be-“
“Are you hurt?” Tony heard in the coms and watched Steve lower the shield and straighten up. He still didn’t turn towards him. “Tony, are you hurt?”
“I know about Carol’s offer. I will be refusing. I never wish to be an Avenger or team member of any sort ever again. Goodbye Captain. I hope you can find some solace after all of this is done. It’s what Tony would have wanted.”
Steve’s hand was still resting around Tony’s waist. The contrast between his skin tone and Tony’s was obvious. Tony had cold pale skin, where as Steve’s was a soft pink, warm and safe.
The armor was flat on its back, and seemed to be an older version of Ironman. The helmet was engaged but no lights were on and under Steve’s palm, the chest plate was cool. Steve couldn’t tell whether Tony was even inside.
“Hey, easy, easy.” Steve said firmly because Tony was always prone to being reckless and that hadn’t changed.
"No way. You're not leaving yet. We haven't had breakfast yet." Steve whined quietly and Tony's heart broke at the tone. Sleepy Steve was a whole other being the world didn't know about yet.
Steve lies to himself. It’s a constant thing he does these days to try and forget the pain he carries. The ache of betrayal feels etched on his skin and seems impossible to shake off sometimes.
Scoffing, Tony stormed ahead, not giving Steve the chance to see his own lips twitching. He hated how Steve managed to get so much out of him but at the same time, it was the most fun he’d had in so long.
After a brief moment of silence, Tony dropped his hand and sighed. “You know I can handle myself right?”
“So this is where you’ll work. Any problems then just give me a shout. I work in the main lab with a couple of others just through that door.” He explained, pointing out a glass door that Tony could see led to a huge lab, much like the one he had back home. “That’s where the head of research works. Who knows, if you’re good, I might let you in.”
Once settled, they browsed the menu and placed the order. Drinks arrived and by that point Tony had managed to shake his surprise from earlier.
Scoffing to himself, Tony stood and smiled. Could it really have been that arachnid that took the ghouls down? What did it have to do with big blond over there?
As quickly as the smile appeared it vanished from Ben’s face. Instead, he was now glaring at Tony with an equally angry expression.
“Those designs you kept bringing. It’s your work. Anyone who’s seen you work can tell.” Steve was smiling as he said it. “Good job Shellhead.”
Iron man went quiet for a moment, letting the wind continue to fill the void for them. When Steve looked at him, he felt the arm around him tighten just a fraction.
The moment stretched on. No one said a word and no one moved a muscle. The cold stone under his knees dug into his flesh through the material of his dark pants and his palms remained loose on the ground.
In the distance, a faint light flickered and he wondered if maybe that was his chance. It looked like the old sign of some gas station but maybe someone there would let him make a call. If he could just borrow someone’s phone-
“Is that him?” He spoke quietly, in a clear voice, in Whitney’s ear and she laughed brightly, batting his arm playfully.
Then the storm hit. Dozens of baby tsums, Cap and Iron, poked their heads up and chirped. They kept chirping and peeping and some even tried to swim through the sea of balls towards Steve to do something. Tony figured they wanted to save the little Iron-tsum who was still peeping softly and spinning around frantically in Steve’s palm.
His mind swirled with thoughts, and it wasn’t until the doors slip open to the training area, that he stopped.
Tony didn't go back to the office when he got the notification, but decided to put the tablet down and use his lunch to take a quick break. His head was starting to spin from the constant staring at a bright screen-something that never got to him before, but now, with the sheer amount of screen-time, was becoming a daily problem for him.
“Thanks.” He said softly, not looking at Tony as he curled his hands in his lap. “That’s nice to hear.”
Tony waited for a response but didn’t get one. Instead, Steve stepped in line with the entrance to the alley and scanned the streets. Then he held out a hand behind him and beckoned Tony closer.
“I brought you some food. Try and eat it for me, okay?” Steve said, giving him a small smile as he blinked to clear his vision. Slowly, he rolled onto his back and pushed himself up. Steve put the tray down and quickly wrapped an arm around his shoulders, helping him up.
“H-how..did you...?” Tony’s eyes closed for a moment and then he frowned. But when he opened them they were back to normal, fully bright and wide and full of color. Tony’s color.
“He has a name." Carol admits, like she doesn't know how much it hurts to hear that Tony belongs to someone else. "But Steve, it’s-“
The window next to him showed his reflection staring back at him. Tired, dull eyes blinked and a shadow of fear seemed to paint the reflection in a darker light. If only he could truly pull himself out of the worry to enjoy the view outside.
Sucking in a sharp breath, Tony twisted his head round and stared. The sight of Steve snoring softly with his eyes closed made Tony start.
“Explain yourselves. Now!” Carol demands and Steve steps back from Strange, creating a meters distance. If anything, that makes Strange struggle more.
!” Steve suddenly roared, loud enough that several of the waiters and customers paused to look at them. But Steve didn’t care. “You’re not a liability and I’m getting sick and tired of you thinking that! You act like that around everyone! Even around me you-“ Steve finally noticed the room and cut himself off, taking his voice down a notch. “-you act like you’re on egg-shells.”
They went up the elevator in complete silence. Tony said nothing and so did Steve. There was nothing to say. Just the truth.
Steve didn’t buy that. Tony was too smart to fall prey like that. And Tony had tried to say his name that first time, Steve was certain.
Dugan chugged his drink and more or less slammed the glass down. “Shush boy. None of that talk. These morons are ridiculous. Back in the day, Cap would’ve taken them out back. Hi, Nick, how’re you doing?”
Another battle cry appeared and Thor, the mummy Steve had mentioned and had shown him, the one he’d seen in that photo Steve had up in his apartment-
. You may not remember everything, but even you know you’re a bad liar.” Steve scowls darkly and folds his arms, and for once, Tony is thrown by the alpha. Steve’s never called him out like that before.
He’d lost a friend today. His best friend. All because he’d been too insistent and too impatient and too greedy.
“Right this way, just follow the signs to the East Room. Enjoy your evening. Sir.” The guard said, and Tony got the distinct impression he was only really talking to Steve. Tony could’ve been dirt on the ground for all he cared.
“Tony Stark.” She smiled and held out her hand and yeah, he liked her already. “I know who you are.”
These things always came easy to Steve. He was the type of person who just clicked with people. Like a solid part in well oiled machinery, people took one look at him and loved Steve instantly. Maybe it was the Captain America title, or the looks or the unwavering determination to do the right thing but whatever it was, Steve was good and people loved him.
“You’re really sat there checking me out?” He turned back round and put his hands on his hips. “C’mon, you’re not even hiding it.”
Tony swallowed and paused. Then he crept forward and edged closer, finally settling on a stool by the table. His eyes homed in on the long sweep of neck Steve was showing.
Steve knows that’s not it. Tony just risked his life to save him and hasn’t even bothered to mention they’re soulmates, not once. That doesn’t come from shame or neglect. That comes from fear. Shame in a different way.
As much as he hated to admit it, he enjoyed talking to someone else. It was nice to be treated like a person rather than a pet.
Eventually they finished up dinner and the waiters came to take everything away. Meanwhile, Tony heard Gabe mention something to Dugan.
Or maybe he’d just known it from the start. The realization at dinner had only really confirmed that.
“Did I want-OF COURSE I DIDN’T WANT THIS! I NEVER FUCKING WANTED THIS!” Steve roared and Tony all but collapsed back into his seat in shock. He couldn’t breathe and he had to cup his mouth with both hands to keep the gasps down. He was hyperventilating-he was gonna be sick-
“Not for spiders no. I prefer the more humanoid types.” Steve said lightly, scanning the small group for someone else.
Within seconds, Tony was spun around and held against Steve’s chest with his mouth just brushing Steve’s collarbone. They were so damn close it made Tony’s head spin.
Well that cleared that up. He huffed and tossed the phone on the table, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms. He squinted at Steve.
“Shhhh.” Steve leaned down and breathed into his ear. “I’ve seen you do this before. It’s the same. C’mon Tony, give it to me.”
It was coming to evening. The sun was beginning to set in the distance, blending the sky into an artful mix of yellow, pink and lilac. In the far distance, the deeper blue was beginning to appear, and with it, the beginnings of night.
There was a brief pause. Then Pierce gave him a funny look before deliberately running his eyes over Tony carefully.
Pleased, Steve watched Tony finish the smoothie and start on the soup. Full of vegetables and chicken, Steve hoped it would be good for Tony. And he seemed to be enjoying it.
The woman smiled kindly once more and closed the door behind her with a soft click, giving Tony an idea of how to reinforce the door. Perhaps he could tweek the locks so that-
“Oh, well! It was phenomenal, wouldn’t you agree?” He clapped his hands, looking at Norman once again.
He’s preparing. Bucky was the first step. Now he needs to deal with assets and that leads him to his properties.
Now it was the opposite issue. He knew Steve too well, so well that he would do anything to spend time with him, which was exactly why he couldn’t. This wasn’t some reward for good behavior, and it wasn’t some second chance. He’d run out of those.
“Hey.” Steve whispered softly, tilting his chin down and feeling his heart drop at what he saw. Tony looked so lost, like he’d just been told news that would change his life in a way he couldn't tell.
“How about a paternity test?” Ty suddenly suggests and Tony wonder why he hadn’t thought of that. “I’ll get the obstetrician back, hold on-“
The instant he felt Whitney’s hand on his shoulder, the skin around his eyes grew tight. He dropped his hand and waited.
He was lucky he’d managed to get this appointment. Maybe he was downplaying it but things had been...difficult lately. Ever since he’d woken up from his self induced coma, too many things had happened at once and he’d barely had a chance to breathe. They’d taken out Norman which had been great and all but other than that...
“Whitney. I need to speak with Anthony alone.” Zeke interrupted them both, appearing just before the main hall entrance. His brow was furrowed but he seemed calmer than before.
Sighing to himself, Tony knelt down and beckoned them closer, watching the hopeful look on their faces. A quick check of his surroundings confirmed they were alone and so, silent as a mouse, Tony unzipped the collar of his black uniform and tilted his head, exposing the pale smooth expanse of skin.
“You won’t do it.” Steve said softly as he watched Tony’s lip tremble. “Because you still care about me.”
A knock on the door pulled them out of their moment. Tony’s lawyer opened it and nodded at the pair, though his eyes lingered on their joint hands.
Tony tried not to look too smug as he broke the news. That was until he saw the sheer fury in Steve's eyes.
At Fury’s gesture, Tony walked with him back to their table. All around the room, people were ambling back towards their seats and waiters began to set plates out. In the organised chaos, Tony instinctively found himself looking for Steve and Sharon.
“C’n you g’ve it to them?” He slurs and makes to stand up from the bench. He feels it’s important and he knows that it’s better to trust someone else with the task than himself. Plus, there’s something about this stranger that he trusts.
He ducked behind the ledge of the roof and peaked over carefully. The vantage point was excellent; from here, he could see so much.
The next day had been uneventful. Zeke had requested the details of his excursion in front of Norman and had naturally asked for a full description and Tony spared nothing regarding the blood hunt.
For all Steve was super-human, he was still human. The limitations of that had never burned more than now.
“Careful pup. You wouldn’t want me to reveal just how deadly I really am, would you? I may be new but I’m no different from the rest. Don’t make that mistake.” Tony explained, holding a finger up calmly, but instantly he pulled it away. His hands were shaking again.
“But I want this to work for all of us. I hate the idea of you being out on the field on a different team and I can’t even help you. It’s...not right.”
A small hushed noise escaped him. It sounded muffled to him but he thought it was the sound of him gasping reflexively. It was getting...fainter...
for Steve to knot him flooded his mind. The way Tony had looked, the way he’d been so scared, something no one but Steve had ever seen on the great Tony Stark...
Tony took a bread-stick from the centerpiece and snapped it in half, scowling at the crumbs as they fell. His life had improved massively since Steve had walked out. He didn’t have anyone nagging him to eat or sleep or do something stupid like go for a walk when he had at least twenty jobs to do. He didn’t have anyone sitting on his head all day, making the stupid rustling noise with sheets of paper. No coffee mug stains other than his own. The ones he chose to leave behind, instead of finding them everywhere. Steve was surprisingly messy with his kitchen ware. And just about everything else. And he meant
He doesn’t know how much time passes but the scent of vanilla hits him first. Then apples and a hint of leather. Voices start to come back next. Then he hears one right above him.
“You’re burning up.” Steve breathed, sounding like he’d been the one to get punched and Tony could see the Commander stance finally dissolving completely.
I hope everyone is well and safe during this time! Thank you so so for your patience and support-please see the notes at the end!
“Fall backwards, I’ll catch you!” And hoped and prayed that Tony would understand because if he didn’t, Steve would lose him again and-
“I don’t have any soul marks left.” Tony admitted reluctantly and then looked up again, only this time he was calm. Even Steve’s quickly paling expression was doing nothing to stop him.
“Nick’s an old friend of mine. As I’m sure you know. But sometimes he doesn’t always listen to me. Same as your Captain really.” He said with a slight shake of his head. “They work hard but sometimes that’s not enough.”
did they do this to me?” He asked with a voice that sounded like razors ran against his throat. But when had that ever stopped him?
“Pick it up J. I’m all ears.” He chirped and set the blowtorch aside to gather the coils on his table. Thankfully they weren’t that heavy.
When Tony tried to explain again for what must’ve been the seventeenth time, everyone had shushed him and told him to wait. They’d all know soon enough.
“We’re all here Trish. Don’t think anyone’s still asleep.” Ben supplied helpfully and suddenly it clicked.
“Help my team complete the repairs.” Steve clarified, eyeing a particular phone on the table. “Shield’s R and D department is struggling. We need an extra set of hands and as much as I hate to say it, you’re our best chance.”
“You need to see a doctor. You’ve lost weight.” Carol says to him. Three months after the funeral, Tony gets visitors on the Helicarrier. Sam, Carol and Pepper have come to see him and it turns out Maria invited them. So now, all four of them have pulled him aside and want to talk to him. Apparently they’re worried and so are a few other Shield agents.
“L’ve you Winghead.” Tony slurs and feeling his head loll, he brushes his fingers against the matted blond strands on Steve’s forehead.
He approached them from behind them and clapped Tony’s shoulder lightly before coming around to join them. In his hand was the same glass he’d carried earlier, only it was completely full.
“So Stark. Had enough of these clowns yet?” Fury asked giving the wine an unimpressed look. But then again, when did he ever look any different?
Either way, Tony couldn’t deny he was curious to know more. What kind of person would have Pureblood Prime Vampire Ezekiel Stane on the back foot? The man must have been something else to have Zeke retreating. Tony couldn’t even begin to imagine it.
“You probably don’t want me anywhere near that. You know how I am, me and machines can get into all sorts of trouble, I’d hate for something to happen to-“
But then, two weeks into his break, Tony got a message from Steve saying he had to go take care of Shield business and would need to leave the Helicarrier for some time.
“Get it yourself Stark!” Ben snarled into the coms breathlessly and to Tony’s absolute shock, started to run the other way.
“I think I should go.” Tony sighed and pushed his chair out, only pausing when Robinson instantly reached over and grabbed his wrist.
“He’s anemic. And quite badly by the looks of it. He’s lost weight and he doesn’t really have the same muscle tone as when he first came in. Not to mention, he’s exhibiting signs of long-term exhaustion and stress and dehydration.” The doctor said and glanced at him briefly. “He’s awake.”
Slowly, Tony trudges through the thin layer snow. As someone had correctly pointed out, a snow storm is coming and Tony knows it will be his last stop. He’s on his last legs-an animal needing to be put down.
The Cap-tsum looked at him sadly and at the outstretched hands, he shook and bleated softly. But then Tony noticed him glancing behind Tony and then something steeled his resolve. Slowly and ever so carefully, he swam towards Tony and allowed Tony to pick him up carefully.
“But how can a Cap-tsum have a baby Iron-tsum?” Tony tilted his head and pursed his lips. “And why do they look like-oh.”
Feeling a stone settle low in his stomach, he coughs and feels his body choke as he hooks one shaking finger under each side and pull the cowl back.
“Don’t worry about me.” Steve cut in, eyes now fixed on Tony. “I need him okay, you understand? That’s an order.”
Tony’s heart began to calm as soon as Zeke took his hand away and spun to face his advisors. His palms itched and burned when he clenched his fists tightly. Slowly he pushed himself up and stood tall.
"It's agent Stark." He said numbly and turned away, even as he saw the fear in her eyes. "Don't hesitate to ask my boss if you need any upgrades, Captain Marvel. The research team is happy to help."
Unfortunately, as soon as Tony placed the folders down, Steve paused and looked straight up at him, about to say something. Only, as soon as he saw Tony he closed his mouth and frowned.
“I just w-wanted to say-“ And he has to pause because what does he want to say? There’s always been so much and he’s always been good with words. Wasn’t that a thing? Tony Stark is good with words? Tony Stark is-
“Mr. Stark, oh, I’m so sorry, let me.” Senator Stern said sweetly, pulling out a napkin to dab at the nasty wine stain that was now soaking the front of his suit. Really, could the evening get any worse?
“I don’t care either. I want people to know.” He said, watching Tony’s eyes widen as he leaned closer. And behind Tony, shadows began to appear in the mist.
“H-here.” Tony mumbles and pushes himself to stand. Sucking in a deep breath, he forces his limbs to stop trembling as hard and stands on his own two feet.
The voices are distant. He can just about hear them over the bleeping coming from his right. It’s a steady beat that sounds familiar-almost like his-
There was something Fury wasn’t saying. His shoulders were tense like he was expecting an attack, and his gaze kept darting back and forth between their surroundings and him. Fury kept looking and him with such a stressed look that Tony almost felt like asking if there really was a fight coming.
It was a huge robot. Insanely huge. And around it were several smaller ones that were raining down gunfire on the packs of agents. Some of the robots were focusing on taking down the agents in the turrets lining the top deck. Others were looking for something, tearing through the agents like paper.
“We have to help them Tony.” Steve whispered, watching the scene carefully with a fiercely determined expression. “They could get hurt if we leave them like this.”
“Calm down Cap. Come here boy.” Dugan suddenly said, having finished his conversation with Gabe. He turned back round on his seat and leaned forward, crooking a finger his way. Wary, Tony took the seat Steve had pulled out and settled next to the man.
He could be strong. He could put Tony’s wishes above his own. He could push aside the intense sweetness, that mouthwatering scent of warm liquid honey, toasted coconut and vanilla, to think for both of them and do the right thing. Steve wasn’t most alphas. He wanted his future with Tony,
Steve was staring at him with a frown. He wasn’t saying anything, but his eyes darted over Tony’s face rapidly.
. He simply weeps into his hands while Blackbolt and Beast turn from restriction to comfort. They rub his back gently and don’t say a word.
“My lord. It’s good to see you.” Tony said, keeping his eyes to the stone floor to allow Ezekiel that divine respect. Ezekiel shifted on his feet and sunk his hand into Tony’s hair gently.
The being was tall and broad, well-built muscles shifting as he folded his arms and gestured to the squirming ghouls being loaded into a car. His bright blond hair rustled in the wind but his gaze looked firm and his body held still.
A moment passed and Tony briefly tried to picture a way in which he could just run without being mocked for the rest of his life when-
“Mr. Stark. Captain Rogers. Now that we have reviewed the papers and all decisions have been made, we will assemble the documents for you to sign. To be clear, Captain Rogers has agreed to not claim any assets that were acquired throughout the marriage. All property held by Mr. Stark is to be relinquished fully, with no divide of equities.” The lawyer eyed Steve at that, and only continued when Steve nodded tiredly. “All documents today will be registered and will effectively end the marriage between both parties involved. Once signed, both parties will have no relation identifiable by court. Gentlemen, please wait in the other room while we assemble the forms.” He finally said, standing up swiftly with a pile of sheets in hand. Tony’s lawyer stood up as well and he quickly followed them along with Steve.
“Sure Ty.” He sighed and stood up and took the pile of folders from him carefully. Then he stopped and felt his eyes widen.
"Mhmm. You smell good." Steve said against his neck and huffed before lifting his head and squinting when Tony looked up at him.
He could see the stress on everyone’s faces. In the tension on their shoulders and the clenches of their jaws. These people were starting to worry too.
It feels that way at least. His mind is foggy in a way that almost reminds him of when he’s starting to reach the peak of the drink. That hazy sweet escape that beckons him to commit sins. To forget what he’s worth and give it all away.
When he brings his hands around himself, he realizes he’s dropped his bottle. The one item he still had.
Registration had taken over their lives. Nothing had been the same since Stafford. Their homes, their friends, their family-it had all been thrown aside for the sake of battling it out over the accords. And Steve was sure, just as Tony was, that he was fighting for the right thing.
“I don’t doubt it. He’s the best I could’ve hoped for. Completes the team and we all agree. Men like him hold people together.” Steve said conversationally, like he hadn’t just turned the huge insult into a massive compliment. Tony wished he could’ve kept the surprise out of his face, but he knew he couldn’t. And neither could Pierce by the looks of it.
There was a red carpet rolled out all the way to the entrance and the sides were brightly lit with lights and glitzy dresses and smart pressed suits. Cameras clicked and lights flashed and instantly Tony remembered some of the red carpet events he’d attended in his life. This was normal. This wasn’t new.
As they both settled into their seats, they began to talk about their week. Jeremy went first giving Tony time to lean on his hands and just enjoy watching him talk.
“Captain America. I know it’s hard for you to understand with your forties sensitivities but some of us like to have fun-“
"But that's not something to do with Ironman." Steve pointed out calmly and well, didn't that sting?
In front of him, Sharon’s eyes lit up. She smiled broadly and with such happiness and joy that Tony couldn’t help but feel immensely guilty for the horrible ache of jealousy. But of course, he couldn’t stamp out the overwhelming sadness.
With a roll of his eyes, Tony nodded and accepted the papers, taking a moment to flick through them.
Had he been excited, even a little? Or had he wrapped his wrists in thick bands to hide Steve’s marks on his skin because he was ashamed?
Ducking under the ledge of his home, he snuck in and quickly grabbed the small sack he had stitched together with a sewing needle and string he had. He’d found it in a tin in the bunker, back when he’d just woken up and found himself covered in cuts and bruises. He’d had to use the needle stitch his own wounds at some points.
“What?” But Steve was nodding resolutely and Tony’s heart sank because once Steve made up his mind about something, he didn’t let go.
Life as an Avenger in the 21st century was never dull. Since waking up from the ice, Steve had begun a life unlike any other. Meeting the best team of superheros and being able to do his part to keep the world safe was a privilege. He couldn’t be happier...
He’d given up on meals. The few pieces of bagel slices and cream cheese from the janitor in the cafeteria was more than enough. It was more for the action itself than the actual food.
Steve took a deep breath and exhaled. In contrast to Tony’s nerves Steve looked completely relaxed and at ease with the world. Untouchable. Infallible.
As quickly as it appeared, it disappeared. Finally, Steve sighed and took a seat next to Tony, tucking the covers tighter around Tony's waist.
His thoughts were cut short when they entered the inside of the Helicarrier flight hanger. Through their, they crossed the mostly empty hangar (except for a few fighter planes) and reached the elevator at the end. Maria still had her mini-army of Shield agents but they waited for him to enter before clogging up the lift. With a single scan of Maria’s palm, the elevator began to descend. It was probably the most painfully awkward elevator ride he’d ever had in his life.
“Hmmm.” Zeke folded his arms and leaned back against his chair, clearly searching Tony for something.
“They’re mine. But you have them.” He said confidently and Tony glanced at the tags before looking up with apprehension.
With a nod, Steve took out his keys and leaned over his bike. “You need some food. Plenty of rest too I guess.” The lights turned on and the ignition kicked in. Steve revved it a few times and inclined his head.
“Perfect.” Tony noted that Steve seemed especially pleased, and mentally patted himself on the back. “I’ll be there soon.”
“I can do... never-mind.” Tony petered off and Steve fought the urge to beam as he cleaned, fully aware of what that meant.
Steve had gone ballistic and destroyed everyone around them. Then he’d picked him up and carried him to the med team. It had been an eventful fight.
“Thank you.” Tony replied with a confident smile and took a deep breath before dusting his suit down and standing up.
Pleased, Zeke walked towards his desk and began to filter through his papers. While he did, he continued to speak.
Time stopped. Silence suffocated the room. Steve said nothing and Tony wondered if he’d made the biggest mistake he could’ve. A shambolic way to end their time together.
He leapt onto the building roof again. His leap was getting better-more blood gave him more strength and greater reach.
“Wait. Tony listen.” Steve blocked his hand before he could open it, and suddenly Tony was staring up at Steve from his place by the door.
He finds a small alley in one of the blocks nearby. It’s empty, save for a few bags of trash and some pieces of metal rust. Snow covers most of it though and Tony sees it as the perfect place to rest.
He knew it was a bad time, but Tony couldn’t help but feel like they were Winghead and Shellhead again. He was reminded of the past where Steve and him would make their strategies and everything would fit perfectly. If he closed his eyes now, he could picture the mansion with Jarvis and the others and feel Steve’s hand on his shoulder.
...” Tony continued to cry, feeling tears stream down his face as he promised himself that if Steve came out of this alive he’d never go near him again, he’d never touch him or love him, or ever hurt him again. He was cursed. Soulless, and this was what he did.
“Put me down!” Tony cried but couldn’t move with Steve’s steel grip around his body. He didn’t let Tony even squirm much, and only dropped him back on his feet about ten minutes later, when they reached the entrance of his block.
“Why did you save me?” Because it still didn’t make sense. Tony being there in his suit and screaming his name as he fell from the skyline. Tony shouldn’t have been there. He should’ve been handling registration.
Confused, Tony paused behind him. “I mean. Vampire. Kind of goes without saying. Bloodsucker. Leech. Monster.” He felt something shrivel inside as he spoke. His good mood vanished and he looked down at the juice in his hand once again, weighing it in his hand.
“What is this?” Steve says in a dangerously quiet tone because this is a complete disaster if everything he’s allowing Reed to do is leading up to yet another weapon.
“And which freak show did you crawl out of?” Tony coughed, gesturing at the pentagram and stripes. That was right, he wasn’t the one who needed to be embarrassed.
"Well apparently you did." Steve sighed. "I don't want you to think of yourself like that. You're not a traitor Tony. We both made mistakes. for instance-"
He was still in the med bay as promised, and wasn’t allowed any tablets or laptops for a couple of days until he was more stable (that hadn’t been a fun discussion with the doctor). So he’d slept and dreamt of strange satellites and robots with the Shield logo and Steve’s concerned gaze and hands on his neck. He’d been sleeping there for a good few hours and it was nice to be woken like this.
With a sigh, Steve shook his head and stared out of the front. The vast expanse of space stared back at him, revealing the distant stars. They were in space and he still had issues that seemed bigger than that.
“I owe you an apology. I’m sorry Tony.” Steve said and his smile slipped a little. “I haven’t been fair to you. I haven’t treated you right this evening. I need to make it up to you.”
Steve saw the moment Tony’s eyes widened and the realization hit. He knew Tony understood, he just knew. Tony was fully aware of the implications and Steve knew he understood the weight of his decision. Steve had risked everything too.
That was one thing that was strange that day. Tony didn’t see even a glimpse of the masked cow. And he didn’t hear anything about that from Zeke or Norman either. Instead, Zeke had moved on to other topics.
“Hey.” Steve nudged him gently and that was when Tony realized, he had closed his eyes and was leaning his head on Steve’s shoulder. Somehow, he’d managed to shift so that he was relying on Steve.
“I was k-kidnapped?” The idea was horrific. Was that why he had been covered in so many wounds when he’d first woken? Was that why he had incomplete parts of things?
"I need to go." Tony said quickly and tried to pull away. Tried being the key word since Steve's grip turned to iron the moment he spoke.
“Do you remember anything at all? Does seeing me jog anything?” Steve spoke calmly, now beginning to run his hands over Tony’s arms. His movements were poised and calculated and Tony suddenly had the image of a soldier giving commands. Steve really seemed like the type.
More than the children could ever hope for. At ten years of age, they would remain this way for years and would only grow to live beyond that if they didn’t disobey. Such was the life of most vampires.
“Tony.” Carol says and Tony squeezes his eyes shut because he knows what she’s gonna ask and it’ll sting but he hates that she has to. After all, he came close during the issue with the SHRA and if Carol has spoken to Sue then...
“What’re we celebrating?” He mumbled, scowling into Thor’s shoulder, which to his disappointment, was just as warm as the rest of the god.
But they weren’t friends and this was their new normal. He needed to stop forgetting that, because it wasn’t gonna change.
“Whitney, what on earth are you doing!?” Zeke’s voice echoed and Tony watched as Whitney turned back in horror. Zeke had just approached the door.
Steve pressed his hand to the scanner and then, rather than stepping through, he took their joint hands and pressed Tony's palm flat against the scanner.
"No." Steve shook his head firmly and ripped back his cowl angrily. "I never asked you to throw yourself into fire-"
As he says it, he looks at Tony with a soft gaze. It’s not like when Ty smiles at him, it’s different. Like he’s proud but on the inside. Like he’s in awe rather than expects it.
When Tony woke up, the sun was just starting to peak through the blinds of Steve’s window. Sunlight marked the room in a square pattern, all the way across Steve’s body, highlighting the shape of his muscles and the pink of his skin.
Steve’s gaze turned sharp and the corners of his mouth turned down a fraction. Like he was disappointed but Tony had no idea why. He scrambled to say something more.
A wild fire possessed him. The beating drum of Zeke’s pulse called to him like a Siren. He couldn’t stop it no matter how much he longed to.
Taking a deep breath, he took the pillow away and sat up, blinking hazily towards the light coming from the window. Then he got up and began to gather his uniform from his locker and one of the towels he’d somehow remembered to bring. There was a laundry area he’d spotted somewhere that he needed to get used to using, and plenty of other things he’d need to sort out, but at least there were facilities. Tony was immensely grateful for the cafeteria that Fury had clearly blessed them with.
Feeling his body coil in anticipation, Tony licked his lips and looked up, feeling a little pleased at Steve’s hungry stare. Steve's hands tightened a fraction around his wrists, holding him in place.
“Tony...” Steve groaned and threw his head back when Tony began to suck a mark near the hollow of his throat. His mouth parted and his eyes closed, his whole facade abandoned by the sensations and that was good-perfect, even because there was no way Tony was losing-
The woman paused, giving Tony a chance to inspect her. Her hair was white and cut short, and her body was small and hunched over from the loss of strength to her spine. Her feet shuffled from side to side, distracting him from her plain civilian clothes and her sharp brown eyes darted from his hands to his face.
“What’s happened? Is it Steven? I swear if that kid has done somethin’, I’ll get my frame and smack ‘im myself! He’s so thick-headed sometimes.”
He could barely remember the last time he’d had an escort take him to the Helicarrier. Usually he’d fly in his armor and finish up the work there before heading home to meet the team.
Fury looked away and spoke to some other bigwig. Feeling the walls close, Tony turned back to Pierce and focused on the heat seeping into his shoulder.
Taking a deep breath, Steve held his shield out and began to walk a little to the side, taking a fighting stance.
When Tony looked back, Zeke and the others were scrambling back in horror. Their bodies shook against their will as the backed away quickly. But Steve was already on them, having ripped at half of Ty’s men almost instantly.
. If he didn’t, he would never have a chance at surviving. Even if there was no one there, maybe the ship would have something.
It had been an accident. Jan had been standing in the wrong place at the wrong time when part of the building had threatened to come down. Iron man had been the one closest to her and while keeping her safe, he’d taken a nasty hit to the front of his torso.
Rogers scrubs his face with his hands and swallows. “You are my omega Tony. Don’t let him take you away from me. From what we built together.”
"You're not the only one who was being reckless. Lets just leave it at that." Steve had admitted quietly, and without thinking, Tony had reached out and grabbed his hand.
Then he sealed his lips to Tony’s and pulled him close, holding him tightly in an almost bruising grip. Tony gasped in his mouth and Steve used the chance to slip his tongue into his mouth and take what was his. Tony moaned and shivered but didn’t stop and Steve couldn’t help but smile into the kiss.
“He also blackmailed you to put on the suit by using your relationship with me. And he insulted you, and he claimed all your designs. Which I did notice by the way.”
Startled, Steve jumped back and cursed mentally, feeling his heart begin to pound. He yanked the shield off his back and held it out, squinting his eyes to look for the danger.
Tony watched and felt the realisation begin to dawn. Instantly he felt his face burn and his heart begin to race.
“Hey, what’s wrong?” Tony asked but Steve just stared past him at the door as if solving some code of his own making. It wasn’t until Steve blinked again, that Tony could heave a sigh of relief.
“Yeah. You’re being a gentleman but really I’m fine with taking a car. I’ve got plenty. Hell, you can...you can drive if you like.” Tony finally sighed, feeling a headache start to appear. He really didn’t know what he was saying wrong and he hated this constant navigation around Steve. If only he was more sure of himself around Steve, he’d be able to relax and not feel like he was trampling on any good feelings.
“I said, stand in line. I won’t repeat myself, Stark.” Steve repeated, and from a glance, Tony could already see he looked annoyed. God knew why.
“I bet.” Tony sighed and rolled onto his back. His neck pulsed happily and the sound of Steve’s gentle breathing relaxed him.
For a moment he closes his eyes and tries to imagine the mansion covered in tinsel and mistletoe. He used to hate Christmas as a kid. Jarvis was the only one who knew but his father would often have one too many drinks on the day and would often pull out the belt at night. Christmas was a reminder of what needed to be given, not what Howard would give.
Scrunching his eyes shut, he groans a little at the stiffness of his body. Then he opens them again and turns towards the voices.
Realization dawns in the Avengers team and Carol tries to say something. She only manages to open and close her mouth. It’s a poor display so Steve takes over.
There was a pause. Steve’s lips twisted downwards and his shoulders slumped in defeat. But Tony wondered if anyone could ever feel like a winner around that.
“Steve-“ Tony breathed softly, watching in awe as big Iron-tsum gently nuzzled the babies. It seemed to be snoozing and surprisingly didn’t seem concerned by the two humans watching it. But maybe that was because it could see Cap-tsum.
The ship engines screamed and instantly the whole thing began to descend. Stunned, Grant watched as the cause of his nightmares fell to the ground like a comet, leaving nothing to be saved.
“Tony.” He pleaded, waiting for him to look up. “It is a problem. It’s a problem because you’ve become my mate. I bonded you that night. The mark is permanent.”
Then he did something absolutely unheard of. Something that set all the vampires off in a wave of hissing and snarling.
“Right.” Tony opened his mouth but hesitated. He tried to shape the words to let them take hold but each time, Tony’s mouth clamped shut.
“Tony, it’s not a bad thing to have a soulmate. It’s an amazing thing, a gift.” Steve implored and took a deep breath. “Aren’t you excited to meet yours one day? The thought that there’s someone there for you no matter what?”
It’s on a night where Tony is thinking about this, that he gets a visitor. A man dressed in uniform, holding a gun and stepping out of the shadows to face him. Just the man Tony’s looking for.
It took only a day for the contract to reach him, and Tony knew instantly that Steve had planned this for a while. It was well thought out, covered several deals, and was of mutual benefit for both of them. It was fair, just like Steve promised.
) he realizes that maybe having someone, feeling someone will bring back some life for him. Maybe something to remind him of what he felt for Steve. Maybe something to distract him.
“It is! And that’s exactly my point!” Steve cried out and was about to say more when he suddenly froze. Then he stopped and leaned back in his chair. Calmly, he folded his hands in his lap and smiled tightly, going back to his Commander stance. A reminder for him to behave because Steve was the boss here. Steve made the calls.
“Ah, look at that! Boy comes in wearing this man’s colors, and he doesn’t even notice!” He cried, and even Fury huffed, rolling his eye when Tony glared at him.
“I’ll keep an eye on him. I’ll protect him.” He said quietly because he didn’t need to have it spelled out for him and maybe that was the right thing to say after all. The others were looking a little more relieved and Strange was staring back at him with bleak approval.
Steve was one person Tony didn’t want to upset right now. He didn’t want to be reminded of his failings and step on any toes. He just wanted to do whatever it was Steve needed and be done with it. The longer he stayed here, the more he’d miss his old life, and lament the decisions he made, even if he couldn’t remember them.
Steve eyed him with a look full of dread. "Including kill yourself. You'd hurt yourself if you thought it would make me happy."
Steve was standing there with his back to Tony holding the shield high in front of their bodies. A few feet away, five agents were collapsed on the tarmac with multiple bullet wounds.
“...What is wrong with you?” Steve says, feeling stunned. Is this how far Tony is from reality now? Has he lost his mind?
Steve didn’t seem to have that pinched look in his eyes anymore. And there was a warmth from him that Tony hadn’t known he’d missed.
“Hey.” Tony smiled, adjusting his black leather jacket as he joined Steve by the door. Steve was wearing his brown leather jacket and had a tasteful assembly of jeans and a pale blue shirt. The man held a smirk on seeing Tony and casually leaned against the garage door, turning around to hold it open for Tony.
Somehow the quiet room felt peaceful. Like for a moment he had a chance to just breathe. Him and Steve hadn’t spoken in months. Now suddenly they were talking again and he was going to live on the helicarrier where he’d have a bigger chance of seeing Steve than before. And not just that, he was going to live as a shield grunt working for shield.
Tony glanced at the men and women beside him who were staring forward with perfect poker faces and ram-rod backs. They were perfect military.
And what a world it was. The familiar stench of Manhattan streets permeated the air and the tired groans of creatures returning home late could be found in all corners. Street lights directed the paths clearly but several flickered whenever some bats and birds swooped past, and cabs horned at each other in the distance. Tony recalled seeing a billboard that said
To his surprise, Stark barked out in laughter and took a swig of his drink like Steve had made the best joke ever. It didn’t sit right with Steve. No one should laugh like that at a compliment.
“Don’t.” Tony said sharply, and thankfully Robinson backed down. That wound was far too fresh and he didn’t need it scraped by this snake.
“I did enjoy myself you know.” Tony finally said, once they left the restaurant. He wished it had gone better but he couldn’t help if they always clashed.
“The number of US bonded pairs has tripled in the last month. Over three thousand omega pregnancies have been confirmed. Steve...” Nat glanced at the door. “He is an exception.”
Oblivious, Steve rushed forward and patted some of the cushions on his couch, and swept some of the blankets aside. “Here, take a seat. It’s not much but it’s-“
“We don’t expect any. Yet.” Tony glanced at the agents around him before lowering his voice. “Those robots...you’re sure you know what you’re doing?”
“Tony? C’mon, look at me.” Steve was right behind him now, and he sounded more like a drill sergeant.
“Have you called medical?” Steve asks sharply, placing Tony’s hand down on his stomach so that his wrist is hidden, concealing Steve's name from the world. Carol leans over and presses two fingers into Tony's neck and behind them he hears T’Challa making a call.
“Oh no, no need for that.” Robinson said casually, waving away the idea. “I am interested. After all who wouldn’t be?”
They didn’t need air. As Steve watched Thor and Carol begin to fly around the quinjet, he felt his fingers begin to itch with the desire to do something. It was horrible in every sense, to be standing here and just watching.
The moon was out tonight. A thin knife-edge crescent that was clear and unblocked by the clouds. Usually the air pollution would prevent Manhattan from seeing the stars, but the moon was always there.
“Peter. Peter Parker right?” Tony smirked, enjoying the stunned look on the arachnids’ face. He closed the book Steve had lent him and pushed himself higher up on the bed to greet this newcomer, feeling better than he had compared to the last few days.
“Okay. Stop.” And instantly Tony unlatched, not wanting to ever dare upset the man, for fear that he’d hurt him or-
“This is classified information but we were attacked just over a month ago. While in flight. It left a dent and since then, we haven’t been able to get the main weapons back online and at full throttle.” Steve sighed tiredly, reaching out for the piece of paper. Tony watched him stare at it like it had personally insulted him.
"I'm so glad you're okay Tony." She said quietly and glanced at Steve who was sat by him on the bench. "And you too, Steve."
Thor eyed him carefully before reaching over to pat him on the back. “I am glad you joined us. You fight well for a fledgling.”
It took two whole months after realizing his feelings for Steve to actually muster up the courage to ask Iron man directly. It happened after they’d just won a fight against Batroc the Leaper.
“No you don’t. You can, but you choose not to. Because something about me scares you. And I don’t know what-“ Steve held up a hand when Tony made to speak. “You don’t trust me to take your side.”
“Anthony, you really shouldn’t upset her-“ Zeke began and already Tony knew where this was going. “How can I allow you to marry her if you make her so miserable?”
"Focus!" Tony said sharply, knowing his voice was coming out colder through the helmet. Still, it worked and the agent tightened his grip and stood tall. "Where's the commander? Where are the Avengers?"
(He was afraid. He wanted to find out but what if he was attacked? What if they hurt him and took his supplies? What if they just left him to die?)
“It was.” Tony looked down at the clothes all around him, knowing Steve was smiling now. “The best.”
Zeke nodded and turned away. “Good. Come to my room later. I’ll explain the details of your new role and lay out more rules. Do not fail me.”
The lead medic nodded encouragingly and continued to check him over. “Good, that’s very good, now four things you can feel.”
Through the corner of his eye, he watches Ty continue to scramble and panic. For a moment he feels nothing but relief.
When Tony tried to separate them. Steve shook his head against his shoulder and squeezed tighter. His neck was damp and his heart felt heavy.
“Inbound asteroid belt of delta 49. Expected ETA is ten minutes.” Carol’s voice came through from the back of the quinjet and with a sigh, he turned and left the cockpit. Sharon didn’t say a word to him as he left.
“You’re more of a man than any of these pigs. And I tell ya, Nick woulda been heartbroken if we’d lost you that day. Stevie too. And many others.”
"You should just leave me. Leave me to die." Tony cries into his hands and his vision is so blurred and he feels lower than the low, like he's worse than every single rotting piece on earth. He's tainted and awful and so far from what Steve and everyone else deserves for what he's done and it's about time everyone realize they're better off without him. Hell, if they won't let him die, maybe he can just delete his memories, even that will be enough for him-
The werewolf smiled and nodded his head, clapping his hands. His canines were prominent even from a distance. He looked just as pleased as Tony was and Tony...
“I-“ To Steve’s horror, Iron man took a step back, almost as if he couldn’t handle what he was hearing. “You can’t-I-“
Steve’s eyes widened when he saw the metal. Then his hands clenched and something burned in his eyes.
it was just that he didn’t want anyone to realize just how disillusioned he’d been. If he kept standing there and staring at Steve, someone would eventually notice the red eyes and put two and two together.
With a sigh, he lies his head against the wall and looks up, the sun is setting and the day is blending into the night. Its always worse at night.
Tony. With everything that's happened...it can't have been easy for you. We tried to get in contact, but Pepper said you've been travelling a lot." She sighed and looked him up and down carefully.
“Then make me a promise.” Steve said, suddenly determined. “Promise me that at this party, you’ll come to me if anything bothers you. I mean anything.”
“Sure.” Tony said and suddenly broke into a fit of coughs, having to grab the side of Ben’s desk to stay upright.
It’s when Steve touches Tony's cheeks that he breaks. There are trails of tears on Tony’s cheeks, still damp and shining.
“Well obviously!” Dugan rolled his eyes and leaned back in his chair. “Our boy just needs to get on with it. Good on Nick though-“
“What if I told you that Shield can get a larger share in the company.” Steve said quietly like it was some inside knowledge. Tony wasn’t convinced though.
“Oh look at him. He’s so hungry, can’t you tell?” She purred and fiddled with the mask on her face. She was one of those, Tony had learned. She didn’t want to risk recognition on a hunt and had been spurned enough times for being a monster to make the choice of hiding her face. Some vampires chose that; the life of the hidden. Some had even gone centuries without looking at their own reflection.
Tony could sink into this scent. It’s amazing and warm and makes him feel calmer than he’s ever felt. He never wants to let go of this-
Tony clapped a hand to his mouth and shook his head, and to Steve horror he saw Tony begin to blink rapidly. And he knew why.
Steve swore and reached for his other pocket. The burner phone identical to Tony’s came up and Steve offered it in his palm.
Slowly, hands slipped under his head and neck, and just under his shoulder blades. Distantly, he registered that he shouldn’t have been able to move because of something to do with his back but-
Steve’s voice gets thicker. He struggles but doesn’t stop. “You’re gonna be the best of us kiddo. We’ll make sure of it.”
It felt like it was lived in. People lived here. They ate and bathed and joked here, and behaved like a family. They probably squabbled and made up like one too.
Symbolism. Someone had once mentioned that at a conference after he nearly fell of the stage. Everything happens for a reason.
“I can’t have an alpha!” Tony exclaims and throws his hands up like that might help. “I’ve never been with an alpha before.”
“So what you’re telling me is...” Tony swallowed and felt his lips tremble. “No one else can have me.”
“They’re probably at the table.” Fury said quietly behind him. “It’ll be fine Stark, stop stressing.”
“Whitney, leave him. You are to escort him and nothing more.” Zeke interrupted, though there was a hard line to his words and when Tony caught his eye, he saw irritation simmering under the surface.
A knock on the door pulled him away from his thoughts. Unsurprisingly, both doctors walked in, and Steve quickly followed them. All three of them settled beside his bed.
The movement jarred him and he nearly tripped. Only firm hands snatched him by his waist from behind.
The yellow was gone. Tony felt cold all over and Steve finally turned to him with burning look in his eyes.
With the help of his lead medic, Tony stood up and walked towards the ambulance, approaching the hardworking group of medics that swarmed the gurney that Steve was lying on. There were wires and IVs and machines which Tony had never pictured they’d be able to set up so quickly. Tony could see they were already replacing an empty blood bag.
How was your first day? Tony tried the thought on for size and found he couldn’t really answer. Or rather, he didn’t want to answer. But he was very curious about Steve though.
“This is not a fail safe. It’s a bomb. Have you seriously learned nothing from these past few months?”
“Why’re you being so nice to me? Do you want me to make you something?” Tony winked but Steve sighed and folded his arms.
“I’ll figure it out.” Tony didn’t want to admit that he’d forgotten about that. And he couldn’t take Steve’s chauffeur since that would be completely unfair. “Take care Nick.”
Slowly, the assistant grabbed the steel handle and pulled the glass door open, finally showing some modicum of decency. It took every ounce of strength not to make a point of it as he walked through. Finally the door swung closed behind him, leaving just himself and one other person in the room. The man he’d wanted to see.
Back when he had first woken from the ice, Tony had welcomed him with open arms and given him a chance. He’d done everything to make him feel happy and alive. And he’d been there, as more than a friend.
"It's fine. I understand." Tony said quietly too and shook his head, feeling lighter than before. Something felt right again. He had hope that things would get better.
“Tired. Shakey. My head really hurts.” Tony admitted, dropping his head into his hands as the energy left him. He felt drained but that was nothing new.
“Indeed I will.” Zeke agreed, taking a seat at his desk and reaching for a pen. “I will have to call for reinforcements. Perhaps I’ll send for my friend, another prime to assist me in dealing with the Captain.”
That second option was the one they could see Tony dreaded. Steve knew that every time Tony glanced at Steve after admitting to a mistake during a mission, or after praising Bucky needlessly, it was because he was seeking assurance, and trying his best to avoid a forced bond. A forced heat, a forced pregnancy-a forced life.
. Tony, never.” Rogers instantly says and looks close to tears too. “I never hated you. Not even at the start. God-"
Tony thinks to himself and remembers the relieved look Steve would send his way. The look of absolute relief and gratitude that would flood his face whenever he saw him waking up. Steve would always be happy to see him okay.
See, if things had been going great (which they weren’t but Tony wasn’t going to stop himself from hoping), he wouldn’t have been sat in this hostile little reception, waiting for the CEO of one of Stark industries biggest competitors to let him up while doing his level best to try not to drop down on his knees and beg.
Tyler led him to his own small square lab area in the far end of the room. It was the same as everyone else’s-it had two small lab tables that came together to corner off the area, and was backed by a wall of draws and glass cabinet that haled all sorts of equipment under lock and key. There were also some blank holo screens and tablets that he itched to turn on, and what looked like a fabricator. He couldn’t wait to start.
“What I don’t get-“ Steve interrupted with a raised hand. “Is how someone so intelligent, so kind, so generous, can feel like they’re not as impressive as they are. It baffles me.” He scoffed and ran his eyes over Tony’s expression, almost purposefully teasing his gaze lower.
“It’s a shirt I gave you during your heat. One of your favorites.” Rogers says from across the room and Tony hates that he instantly loves the way it feels and smells on his skin. Apples and vanilla again. Seriously, what alpha smells of
“You’re Iron man. Whoever you are under the armor, you don’t need to prove anything to me. I know how I feel about you. I just want to know.”
“Where are my assignments?” Tony paused and sniffed a little, feeling a wave of exhaustion sweep over him. It was okay. He just needed to finish the stupid equations and then he’d be free to spend the day in bed. Would Ty or Ben let him leave early?
It’s not right but he knows he’s been thinking about that a little too much. He knows you’re not meant to think about things like that, that it isn’t healthy. But he does wonder and he does wish.
If Tony had been more himself, he would’ve laughed. “No.” He answered blandly instead, knowing he didn’t get the right to challenge their behavior. These people were not the problem obviously.
He ran through the streets, fast enough that few could see. Some bystanders yelped when he pushed past them but he didn’t stop. The feeling of his muscles moving was thrilling, like one of those roller-coaster rides he’d tried as a kid.
“You...ah, you’d make a great couple.” He said quietly, finally deciding that maybe it was time to let go. Steve wasn’t meant for him, no matter how much he’d hoped and he was kidding himself. He always had.
The Helicarrier is silent. Slowly, Steve gets out of bed and puts his shoes on. He leaves his quarters and begins to walk.
" Tony rolled his eyes and looked away but not before catching Steve's glare. "So I'm going to go and bring it here. I'll be back within the hour."
Reed pauses by the door. It’s not a favor, Steve knows that. But still, he thinks Reed loses some of the tension in his shoulders.
The camera footage showed nothing, and other than a few separate docs attached to the detailed report, there was nothing.
Ben, who was sat with Sam and the other blond in the middle, spotted him, but instead of saying anything, just turned to his friends and rolled his eyes. He didn’t turn back after that.
Warmth bloomed in Tony’s chest. Even though he was completely stunned, a part of him couldn’t stop smiling, especially when his eyes drifted to their hands.
He loved every moment of it. They spent the night exploring each other. And after Steve groaned and sank his teeth into Tony’s soft neck, they moaned together through their final climax and drifted into sleep, Steve curled around Tony from behind, his huge knot hot and heavy in Tony’s body, and Tony’s neck throbbing deliciously.
“TONY, LOOK OUT!” He screamed, looking ice-white and terrified as he yanked his shield off his back and flung his arm out to throw it. The shield went flying and behind Tony there was a loud metal screech.
Iron man. Iron man was the enigma. The puzzle he wished to solve. The key to the lock of possibilities, or so he felt. He knew he didn’t need to know but somehow not knowing was driving him up the wall.
“That’s right. As soon as we get home. You’re going to show me.” Steve said and narrowed his eyes at him like he was the target. “And prove to me that we’re soulmates.”
All the way home, Tony wondered just what Steve had to be thinking to have said all of that. And if he really did mean what he said. The party would be telling.
The one that had spoken for the group responded. He was a tall dark haired man with a slim build and a smug look. He didn’t seem like the type to show off, but he did seem overly cocky.
It was strange to think Steve was sat here talking about food with him. It kind of seemed like something they would’ve done in the past. Before the SHRA.
Sam and Carol are worried. He's pretty sure Maria is too. She's one of the few that doesn't lift her nose at him when he walks. The Avengers are the same too.
“Captain?” The doctor asks quietly after the brief silence and Tony watches in awe as Rogers stares at him with a fierce expression.
It was time to go back. He’d spent enough time out and the last thing he wanted was Zeke sending Norman his way, or worse appearing himself.
When Tony braved a look in Steve's direction, he was greeted with a good sight. Steve's eyes were closed and he was smiling to himself. His head was tipped back and the wind swept his hair back.
"We should sleep." Steve reminded him gently and nodded towards the bed. "My bed is on offer. We don't need to do anything but Tony, I'd..."
“Well.” Pierce sounded tight-lipped, and really, it was the only reaction Tony could see him having. “For what it’s worth, I think you’re an excellent Avenger. I mean, no one is Captain America, sure. But you’re exceptional Stark.”
“You wouldn’t remember but after Osborn took over and you were in a coma, Pepper sent out a call. And we all came. Not just me but Thor and Rhodes and Maria and Natasha-even Dr. Strange was there to help you. Do you know why?”
“Ah, that’s brilliant Stark! Absolutely brilliant, but then again, I never expected anything different!” Tyler cheered and beamed with pride as he flicked through the blueprints. His eyes were lit with pleasant surprise.
Once they arrived at the main cavern, Tony joined the line of vampires all waiting patiently. Norman was stood in the center, speaking to the twins.
Finally Fury sighed and lowered his hand. “Rogers needs you to do a few things for him. Stay a while, talk to him. He planned a few things for you.”
For the first time in months, T’Challa speaks. And what he says, hurts more than seeing Strange cry.
“Suppressants and forged notes? Why Steve-“ Tony’s voice was shaky but when he looked up, his eyes were shining and his lips were curving up. His eyes narrowed a little as they grew wet. “-it’s-it’s almost like you care.”
Sharon smiled a little and shook her head. “I think you’ve got the whole table covered. You’re good.”
He sees Steve in everything. He sees his happiness, his smile, his sharp mind and calm persona in everything. He even sees that unbelievably strong sense of justice that Steve used to have.
Their moves developed. Steve began to circle Stark and Stark started to shift in tandem. Like a dance between two birds, Steve carefully placed his feet forward and set his eyes on the target.
“Boy? What’s wrong?” Dugan called over but Tony was on autopilot. Feeling his hands shake, he stood abruptly and left the table with a brief wave.
That was a close one. Screamers were bad because they drew unnecessary attention from the wrong creatures and drove other humans away from the source. Tony would need to try the other alleys for a while.
“Iron man. He’s a fraud. Trust me, you’re better off without him.” Stark smiled grimly and lifted up his glass. “Cheers. To fate.”
Humming his agreement, he focused on his screen and turned so as to follow the path. He was above trees now, and could see the warehouse up ahead.
Steve doubts it though. Something is definitely going on behind closed doors. The Illuminati are hiding something.
Weeks of anger at the unfairness, the frustration born from being helpless, had finally built up to so much that Tony couldn’t hold back. This was Tony breaking. This was him finally letting it out.
“You are so precious to me. You think I’ll let them do this to you?” Steve’s hands curled into tight fists but he kept his eyes on Tony. “You think they won’t pay?”
“Steve, enough. Just...take a breath and step back.” Maria said calmly, but her shoulders were tense and from behind, Tony could see her hand clenching around the wine glass like she was desperate to keep it safe.
With a sigh, Steve stood up and stretched. “If I hide it, you won’t notice.” He said with a small grin. “Let’s go.”
Steve’s eyes flashed as he watched Tony’s dulled response. Then carefully, as if he couldn’t stop himself, he reached out and pressed the back of his hand against Tony’s cheek, eyes dark and full of dread.
do you understand!? And if you don’t well- “Steve pushed his chair back and began to stand. Tony gaped, having long forgotten about the sheets.
he realized, as he watched Maria say something quietly to Steve who was just staring blankly at the table with clenched fists. Once again it had all become background noise and he couldn’t focus on the words they were saying but he could understand what he was seeing.
“Steve, I have a plan.” Tony said quickly and grabbed Steve’s arm. “If you aim for the control panel again, I’ll-“
“I’m-“ Steve broke off into staticky coughs and Tony watched in horror as Steve doubled over in front of him and started to vomit.
