He knew, and yet he didn’t say anything. Did that mean that his feelings weren’t reciprocated? Or did it simply mean that Tony was just as much a chicken as he was?
Instead of calling Nat out on bruising his poor body, Clint drew the second to last slip of paper. The one he was waiting for still hadn’t been read and he hoped it was finally time. But no luck yet. “Never have I ever watched keeping up with the Kardashians.”
First the love revelation at breakfast, the unusual cuddle session on the boat and Clint nearly choking on a marshmallow, although that last one was probably the most not “Dear-God-I’m-In-An-Alternative-Universe”-thing to happen all day.
“Darlin’ I love you, but I don’t think I’m gonna be able to perform adequately tonight. Not after that much food. But there’s always tomorrow.” He said with a sly little grin.
Steve always had an emergency bag ready, so he was good to go on a moment’s notice. Yet for some reason something held him back from just taking his bag and flying to Romania. It felt wrong to leave without telling the others, or at least telling Tony.
“Fine! Fine, we’ll make a plan first.” He sounded less than happy about it, avoiding eye contact with Tony.
“This can go one of two ways: either you sit down next to Steve and let him do his thing or I’m gonna make you.” Natasha had her arms crossed, a hint of provocation in her eyes.
Steve shook his head. “Thor, the whole point of the Secret Santa is that you don’t know who gave you the present.”
“No! No, you can’t do that.” Clint begged. Little did he know that was exactly what Natasha had wanted. She loved the fact that she could have one of the most skilled assassins begging for mercy. While there was a cone stuck to her head. And melting vanilla ice cream running down her cheek. That was true power.
Tony had thought that after they would return from the boat trip, he would come back to the house and when he would see Steve, he would know what to do. He had no such luck. The moment he laid eyes on the super soldier, his brain got up from its chair, waved and went out the door. Leaving Tony, a) absolutely uncapable of forming a decent thought and b) exclaim nuggets of rhetoric brilliance like “Oh Cheeseburgers” and “I want to change”. Thanks for nothing. Genius my ass.
“What? That? Oh, come on Steve it was just a game.” He tried to play it off with a wave of his hand and something must have snapped inside of Steve. He lunged forward, catching Tony’s wrist with his own hand, the other one grabbing onto his shoulder, pinning Tony against the wall behind him. Thanks to the serum, Steve was way too fast for Tony to react and too strong for him to get out of the soldier’s grip. Tony could feel the hot breath on his skin, as Steve’s face was just inches from his own.
Natasha seemed even more tense and alert than usual, and Sam finally understood what the weird mood back at the tower in New York was all about.
Steve had to admit he was more than surprised, that Nat actually apologised, and he couldn’t help but smile.
Steve chose to ignore them and instead got straight to the point. He told them all about the file and his plans to go and get Bucky home.
For all the strength the serum gave him, he wasn’t strong enough for this. Wasn’t strong enough to stop his voice from breaking, from a small pathetic sob to escape. His hands were shaking, shame burning its way through his body. The last thing he wanted was to break down in front of Tony, he could not let him see this. It was already humiliating enough to be rejected, having a meltdown in front of the guy you loved was just too much to bear. He wanted to get up, escape, but two things were blocking his way to freedom: a locked door and Tony. The locked door he could have dealt with easily, but Tony?
It wasn’t like he was getting all hot and flustered when a particular person was smiling at him or even just looking at him.
Tony had left half way through the second "Die Hard" movie and as Steve got up to go to bed as well he wasn't quite sure if he should go to his own room or Tony's.
Bruce nodded in agreement. “The only ones outside of this room who know about it are Vision and Wanda and they are there right now.”
Before one of them could reply, the pilot announced that they have arrived and everyone grabbed their bags, getting out of the jet. Tony looked at his reflection in the window before he got up, checking if he had something stuck to his face, that could explain the weird looks he had gotten from Bruce and Steve. Nope, no drool, no sleep-marks, not even sharpie drawings. Weird.
The moment the door closed behind him, May was on Tony like a bloodhound. “This better be good, or so help me god you will never see Peter again.”
“Come on man, I hate talking to a door. So unresponsive. Not that that would stop me from talking. You know I can on and on and on forever. And you’re gonna open this door eventually. I could smoke you out with more of my hilarious drunken adventures. For instance, have I told you about the time I accidentally broke into a zoo to free all the meercats? Now you’re probably wondering how one does accidentally break into a zoo-“ Before he could go on the door opened and Tony was faced with a very pissed off looking Captain America.
Tony rubbed the back of his neck. “Well, if me tagging along is going to be a problem we can do it some other time.“ He sounded slightly hopeful. He could go get some coffee. Relax by the pool.
“Listen, we are in this together if you like it or not. We are a family and if you want to get Bucky back then we will find a way to do that. Together!” Natasha’s tone allowed no room for backtalk. “Now, first we need somewhere to hide him. Ideas?”
“Oh, I think I know why.” He shot her a quick glance, her silence indicating that she wanted him to go on. “I hurt Thor. I lashed out at Tony. I… messed up.”
Tony meanwhile was brooding about what he had learned at the breakfast table. Steve liked him. Liked him like he used to like Peggy. Liked him like Tony hoped to like Pepper. What the hell was he supposed to do with that information?! It’s not like he could walk up to Steve and tell him: “Hey there Captain America, a former assassin told the God of Thunder that you have a crush on me, so I thought I might ask you if you wanted to go to the homecoming dance with me.”
The doctors had said that it wasn’t life-threating but that her hearing and her balance would be impaired and could get worse. They could operate if she wanted. If she could afford it.
Fury didn’t tell them where they were going and to be honest it didn’t really matter. A Quin-jet picked them up and they flew for about six hours, most of which Tony had slept through.
Stepping into the shower, Tony closed his eyes and let out an almost pornographic moan when the hot water hit his sensitive skin. He could already feel his tense muscles relaxing a little. He clearly wasn’t made for this whole fighting business. He was an engineer, a mechanic and not a soldier. Yet he knew that he wouldn’t be able to go back to a life where he wasn’t Iron Man, where he wasn’t part of the Avengers, trying to make this world just a little safer.
Making his way back to his bedroom, Steve walked past Tony’s room. The curtains were only half drawn, and Steve knew that if he stood on the right spot he could see inside. He knew it was a bad idea, but his feet seemed to think otherwise. He found an opening between the white curtains and turned his back to it.
Steve tried to shift away from him a little, but there was nowhere else to go and instead of getting away from the inventor, he somehow got even closer to him. He could feel their bare arms touching, Tony’s heat radiating over to him. He could feel the man next to him tense ever so slightly. See his tongue dart out to wet his dry lips, making Steve wonder how that same tongue would feel on his own lips. He wondered how Tony would sound moaning like the woman on the screen. At once his blood went from his head straight to the other end and his pants grew noticeable tighter. It was all that he could do not to just grab Tony and find out.
Bruce just kept grinning. He knew exactly what it meant when Tony was rambling. And he never heard him ramble on like that before.
Until Aunt May got sick. For weeks she had been complaining about hearing loss, brushing it off as just a symptom of age. Both Peter and Tony had tried to get her to go to a doctor, but May was as stubborn as… well as Tony himself. With the hearing loss also came a sort of clumsiness. She kept dropping things and losing her balance and more often than not Tony found her mopping up something from the floor when he came over during his lunch break. One day he didn’t find a bag of flour on the floor of the bakery, but Aunt May herself. She had tripped and hit her head on the counter when she fell.
A small smile sneaked onto Steve’s face. “You won’t get out of it that easily. Just try to keep up.”
Blond guy still had his back turned towards him and just as Tony was about to make his presence known, blond guy bend over to dip his brush into the paint bucket. No longer staring at blonde guy’s back, Tony’s eyes were no fixed on the most perfect ass he has ever seen.
Clint knew better than to push her, but his patience wouldn’t be infinite, Natasha was well aware of that. And yet something always held her back from turning this, whatever it was, into something concrete, into something meaningful. And here she was lecturing Steve about getting a move on with Tony. Maybe watching her fiends pining was her punishment for being such a coward.
Now all eyes were fixed on Thor, looking at the god, Steve’s mouth opened and closed again, his smile replaced by a frown.
Natasha couldn’t help herself and started laughing. “Seriously? Man, no wonder you didn’t get laid in the 40s.”
Tony clapped his hands. “Right then children, let’s do this. Bruce and Clint, you explain the rules to the newbies, no offence muscle men,” he looked at Thor and Steve. “Nat you take care of the drinks.”
“He remembered!” Steve’s voice was raised now, his hands shaking in anger. Why was Tony like this now? Didn’t he want him to have Bucky back? What was the point in giving him this file, if he just sat at home, comfortable, ignoring that his friend needed help?
“Maybe I should ask the others for inspiration.” She turned around to face the rest of the team, Tony and Bruce were grinning from ear to ear.
“I am prepared to watch you fall!” And with that they started to wiggle back and forth on top of the inflatables to make them move towards each other. As soon as they were close enough, they started hitting the other with their pool noodle, Natasha using her left hand to spare her sprained right wrist, each shouting insults and threats at their opponent.
Steve didn’t really mind what they would be watching, and Clint assured him that “Die Hard” was a Christmas classic and that Bruce Willis was basically Santa with the small but significant difference that instead of delivering toys to children he delivered bullets to criminals.
The car ride home was spent in absolute silence. There never has even been a quiet minute when there was more than two of them in the same place. Even more bizarre.
Tony knew that voice, had heard it before. Once. Thirsty. Only now he noticed that the hands that pulled him away from Hammer were still holding on to him. Blonde guy pushed himself into Tony’s field of vision, staring straight into his eyes.
“No way. The 90s are over, so no more black nails for me!” He took a step back, acting as if Steve had just threatened him.
The only other thing his unhelpful and mostly absent brain supplied, were pictures of last night. Steve’s body pressed against his. Steve’s breath on his skin. Steve’s smell in his nose. Tony’s boner in his pants. All very helpful.
“Alright. Never have I ever tried to see how many marshmallows can fit into my mouth. Who wrote that? A five-year old?”
Steve could only nod in agreement. Everything about this situation was ridiculous. Starting with the fact that they were Iron Man and Captain America. On a Caribbean island. Locked in a closet. By Black Widow.
“Hey, if you say we get him, we get him.” Sam said before Steve even had the chance to get hot headed again.
Tony hurried upstairs to get the cigars he had brought with him for just such an occasion and Tasha prepared drinks for all of them. She didn’t even have to ask what they wanted, she knew her boys well enough by now.
His travel bag gone, Tony entered the common room. He was still avoiding Steve's gaze, but the soldier didn't care. Tony was back and by the looks of it he planned on staying.
“I guess I’ll be puttin’ on the movie them.” Steve made his way over to the TV and set everything up. Taking the remote with him, he climbed into the fort, where the rest of his team was waiting. Clint and Natasha were snuggled up under a blanket on the left, Thor and Bruce shared the middle space, leaving a place to the right of Tony. Of course.
On the drive into town he made sure to ride in the same car as him, sitting in the backseat, watching Tony drive. Naturally, he didn’t notice how exceptionally weird he looked, staring at Tony through the rear-view mirror.
“Okay, since neither of you paid any attention, you get demoted to fetching the supplies.” Bruce scolded. “Tony, Steve, you go get dried beans for the crust. I think I saw some in the cupboard under the stairs.”
Steve was seriously concerned now. He sat up properly and watched Tony. “Hey, you’re starting to scare me.”
“Just… just know that I love you and that I’ll… just… here.” He handed Steve the folder, his hands shaking.
He had listened to Steve leaving his room in the early hours of the morning, most likely to go for a run.
As Steve pushed past him, his face all shades of pretty red, Tony automatically turned to look after him. He always thought Steve’s ass looked best in the Captain America uniform, all tight packaged and ready to be squeezed, but now he had to re-evaluate. Because this – this was just a whole other level. This was mouth-watering level. This was holding-yourself-back-from-running-after-him level. And all too quickly it was gone from his view again. He definitely needed a shower now. A nice, long warm shower.
“You’re messing up the structural integrity of the castle!” Tony shouted, trying to grab the shovel from Thor.
“I want to change!” Tony exclaimed, his voice a little higher pitched than usual. He had been uncharacteristically quiet since they had returned, and Steve hated it. If someone had told him a few years ago, that he would feel uncomfortable and even unhappy about Tony Stark shutting up, he would have laughed them out of the building. But now… now that silence made him feel more on edge than ever. And he had fought actual Nazis.
“I mean really what’s the worst she could make him do?” Steve asked, more talking to himself than addressing anyone in particular.
Nat shook her head. “I find it best not to go down that road. Because after all – we are friends with them which says a lot about us.”
The town was small, and Tony insisted on calling it a village. But it had everything they needed: a few restaurants and shops as well as a bar and even a dance club. The advantage of such a small selection of restaurants was that there was not much arguing about where to eat. Naturally there was still some bickering, but noticeably less than in New York, where it could take them over an hour to decide where to have dinner. Every single movie night proved that.
Steve and Thor joined them a little later, Steve immediately turning a furious shade of pink when he saw Tony laying on a deck chain in nothing than his swimming trunks.
So, some part of Tony was scared. Scared that Steve would leave as soon as he had someone better to go to. Scared that if given the choice Steve would choose Bucky over him. It was incredibly selfish, and he knew that, but still couldn’t help himself.
Clint on the other hand seemed to have a death wish. No matter how many times he got kicked out of the kitchen, he always came back without fail. Whether he was just too damn stubborn to give up helping Bruce or just liked getting on the other man’s nerve, Clint refused to back down. Not even Nat could convince him to stop, and that meant something. After a few months of hearing every curse word in the English dictionary coming from the kitchen in the tower, something miraculous happened. Bruce seemed to finally let someone help him. The shouting became rarer and apart from the occasional swat on the back of Clint’s head with a kitchen towel there was no violence. That they saw.
Bruce smiled happily up at Steve. “You would all starve.” He liked cooking, but he loved making meals for his family. It reminded him of a time before the other guy, when he used to cook with his mother. He liked having a family again.
“I call the shark!” Natasha called out and grabbed the inflatable shark and one of the pool noodles.
Steve ran a hand over his face, contemplating Nat’s words. He knew she was telling the truth, knew this wasn’t another attempt at interfering.
After a sullen silence, he finally replied. “He… he said he was very upset with us and that he did not want to talk to anyone, because he couldn’t trust us anymore.”
Now, standing in front of Steve, looking at the expression on his face, Tony’s anxiety roared back to life. Had he done the right thing by looking for Bucky?
There was a big common room and kitchen on the second floor, again everything was kept in warm earthy colours. The sofa in the middle of the room had more cushions on it than the whole Avengers Tower had in total and it looked like heaven. There even was a fireplace in the corner, although Tony doubted that they would have need for it. He could already feel a bead of sweat running down his back. Good thing he had two pools and an ocean to choose from to cool down.
Tony sighed, shaking his head. “Okay, let’s say he does remember you, say he remembers who he was or is. Let’s pretend he will come with you willingly and without putting up a fight. Bucky is still a wanted man. Do you think you can just march into the country with him, without the government having something to say about that?”
Steve was sure he was going to die of embarrassment, when Tony, his hair still wet from the shower, made his way back downstairs to the middle floor, where he and the others were sitting on the sundeck. The sly grin on his face seemed to melt his insides and then there was that certain twinkle in Tony’s eyes, making him blush to his roots, which in turn made Tony grin even more. Steve sunk a bit lower in his chair, as if that would hide him from those dark brown eyes. Maybe he should have stayed upstairs and pretended to be unwell for the day. Or maybe next time he walks out of the bathroom he makes sure not to run groin first into one of his teammates.
Not long after they found a lovely little clearing, flooded with sun light, flowers all around. And more importantly butterflies. Those small delicate creatures seemed to have worked a spell on Thor. His face lit up the moment he saw one and even more so when one landed on him.
Tony was just about to close up for the day and drive Peter home, when the bell above his door rang again. Looking up from counting the register, he found himself opposite one of the few people that actually made his skin crawl.
It took a moment before the door opened and Steve emerged. His hair was all messy like he had been lying in bed. His upper body was naked, and Tony had a hard time not just staring at the exposed body in front of him. Steve’s lower half was covered by the door, leaving the question of its nakedness to Tony’s imagination.
Natasha started laughing again and Steve rolled his eyes with a smirk on his lips. When he was finally finished with Nat’s nails and they had dried, he looked over at Tony. “Your turn, Stark.”
Unbeknownst to him there was more than just a shopping trip on the to-do-list for today. What Tony had forgotten, or quite possibly just repressed, was that today was Friday. And Friday was movie night. That was the law. Usually they also got take-out food but since they had that yesterday and Bruce felt like cooking, they let him work his magic. Not that anyone could have stopped him, even if they wanted to.
He had to admit, that today had actually been fun. Not that he would ever admit that, especially not to Nat. But he had enjoyed doing something so normal like shopping with his group of very not-normal people. Sure, it was still a little awkward between Steve and, well everyone, but they were getting there. Tony caught Steve staring at him a few times, but he was almost certain that Steve hadn’t noticed him noticing. He had had that far gone look on his face, that he usually only gets when he’s either thinking of his past pre-capsicle, or when he was trying to figure out how to solve a tactical problem.
When Steve finally stepped out of the shower and dried himself off, he realised he forgot to bring a set of fresh cloths with him to the bathroom. With the towel wrapped around his waist, Steve opened the bathroom door, still lost in thought and bumped into a body. It was only thanks to his quick reflexes, that he caught the towel before it hit the floor, quickly bending down and pulling it back up to cover his groin as best as he could, almost losing his balance as his wet feet slipped on the floor.
Half an hour later, Thor was back downstairs. Alone. And with an expression on his face neither of them had seen before. He looked like his spirit had been crushed, the usual twinkle in his eyes completely gone.
Nat knew that he was right, but that didn’t make her any less angry. None the less she walked over to Thor and looped her arm through his, just as Bruce did the same on his other side.
Tony had been acting weird for a few days now, ever since the team had decided to do a Secret Santa for Christmas.
Tony dismissed both of them with a wave of his hand. “Please. I’ve done more embarrassing stuff in the 90ies.”
“I request you purchase an ice cream and inquire if the vendor is a believer in the majestic creature that is the unicorn. And before he will reply, you will take the ice cream and put it on your forehead. So, you become the unicorn!”
Tony was in the middle of a soul-destroying yawn, when Steve came out to the deck. He was wearing one of those impossibly tight shirts again, that made Tony’s mouth water. Steve looked very surprised to see Tony standing there in front of him.
Tony looked up at him and gave him a crooked grin, holding up his thumb. With everyone else he would feel embarrassed about his current state.
Two weeks where he didn’t know what to do, how to tell Steve about finding Bucky. It shouldn’t have been so difficult. He should just have been able to come up to Steve and given him the file right away. But he was scared.
“Did you enjoy that?” It was barely a whisper, more like a growl, low and fuelled with barely contained rage. Tony took an involuntary step back. He’s never seen that side on Steve before and it was more than just slightly unnerving.
Clint and Nat had helped Steve picking out the perfect tree for the tower, which took almost two days, while Bruce feverishly had started drafting a Christmas menu.
“No ambulance. I’m fine.” That might be a bit of an exaggeration but the last thing he wanted was to go to a hospital and the first thing he wanted was a stiff drink.
Steve immediately whirled around, facing them. The laughter and chatting stopped the second they spotted Steve standing there, with his hands behind his back, rocking nervously back and forth on his feet. Five pairs of eyes stared at him and he could feel his palms getting sweaty. He’s never been this nervous in his life.
“Okay so does this mean we’re all friends again? And more importantly, can I have the coffee now?” Clint asked.
Tony grabbed the biggest mug he could find and filled it to the brim with the delicious life-giving liquid, before he sat down at the dining table with everyone else.
The man on the pictures barely looked like the man he knew. The man he knew would never leave the house without shaving, would never have let his hair grow that long. Steve remembered fondly making fun of Bucky and how vain he was about his hair. He remembered all the bickering when Bucky took too long in the bathroom again, before they left to go out for the night.
Now they were gathered around a big conference table in the Avengers Tower, Fury sitting at the head of the table, for the debriefing, which Tony wasn’t really listening to. What he wanted right now was a shower and a weeks’ worth of sleep, and not director Fury talking about how they just got beaten up. He was there, he knew what happened, thank you very much and good night.
With the glass in his hand, Tony left his room to look at the rest of the house. He assumed the other bedrooms looked pretty much like his, so he didn’t bother. Also, the other might not like him snooping around in their rooms. Not that that ever stopped him.
He turned to look over to Tony and Bruce standing in the kitchen, getting a feast ready. The moment Steve sat eyes on him a surge of determination took hold of him. Taking a deep breath, he quickly walked over to the two of them in the kitchen, eyes fixed on the one person who could make his heart jump in his chest.
The frown immediately disappeared and was replaced by that breath-taking smile again and Tony’s heart skipped a beat. “Oh, you mean Thirs-tea. Yeah, it’s a bit cringy but I thought it was funny.”
The floor was littered with empty food containers, dirty clothes and most of all newspapers. Steve bend down to pick one up at random. It looked like it was written in Russian, but he didn’t need to be able to read it to know what it was about. Half of the front page was taken up by a slightly blurry picture of Bucky.
Tony shuffled away from Steve, leaning back against the door. It was impossible to be so close to the blond man without his thoughts and convictions straying, but it was crucial that he didn’t give in to his desires and instead made Steve understand why this was more than just your average bad idea.
Five minutes later Tony entered the gym, empty apart from a very angry looking super-soldier. Steve was at the bench press, lifting the weights into the air. He was still wearing his Captain America uniform.
Hello you wonderful people! I had a pretty bad cought for the last few weeks and some other stuff to take care of but I finally managed to write the second chapter for my little Christmas fic. Even tho it is a little late I hope you enjoy it!
Still mulling over Steve’s behaviour, he turned off the light and laid down in bed. Maybe Cap just had a little too much sun and it fried his brain.
He made the best, sold the most and earned a lot of money doing it. Which in turn allowed him to buy a lot of booze. And occasionally other substances that helped him forget that his inventions actually killed people.
Steve’s heart did a double flip the moment they kissed. It was a shy and delicate kiss, so innocent and yet so meaningful. A soft moan escaped Tony, when Steve’s tongue licked over the other man’s lips. The sound flicked a switch in Steve’s head. Still sitting on the upturned bucket, he grabbed Tony’s hip with one hand, pulling the inventor onto his lap, while his other hand disappeared in his curly brown hair. In return Tony wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, pressing their bodies as close as they could get in this position.
Tony fled to the balcony for almost an hour talking on the phone to Rhodey, apparently having a very heated discussion about one thing or another.
“I mean I love you, but you… don’t.” It was the first time Steve had said this out loud to anyone, including himself, but Tony didn’t know that.
It was always different with him. And that made him a little nervous. Tony was used to being in control over the things he did and felt. But this was neither the time nor the place to think about those sorts of things. This was the time to show Steve that he could keep up with him. “Let’s carry on. Or are you already giving up, old man?”
“I’m sorry. I-I shouldn’t have done that. He’s your friend. Not mine. I should have just stayed out of it. I just-“ Before he could dive headfirst into a full blown panic ramble, Steve finally got off the bed and pulled Tony into a kiss. His worries melted immediately in Steve’s arms and for the first time in weeks he truly allowed himself to relax.
“You know, sometimes I wonder where my life went wrong to end up here.” Clint mumbled to Bruce. But the man didn’t hear him, he was already on his way over to the trio on the deck chair, so he could get his nails done next.
He had trusted Natasha, for the first time since he got out of the ice, he had really trusted someone. Steve knew she liked to play games and be in control of everything and everyone. He just thought she wouldn’t be like that with him. Guess he was wrong.
As expected, Thor didn’t last long for the lack of bluffing skills. Tony couldn’t help but wonder how the game would have turned out if they had played against his brother Loki. Without all the murder and backstabbing, obviously.
Hearing her giggle from the kitchen, he stormed over to her, Thor and Tony right behind him. “You promised me no more meddling! You promised!”
“Maybe in a bit. Have you checked out the closet under the stairs? They have all kinds of pool accessories there.”
Last nights drinking game caused more than just a little tension. Maybe a boat trip and an eating contest could fix things?
They continued like this for about half an hour, Steve’s favourite guesses being a unicorn (Thor), a dagger (Natasha) and a tramp stamp (Clint). They had also decided that it was a good idea to take a shot every time someone made a wrong guess. Which was a lot. So, by the time Bruce called an end to the madness, they were already quite tipsy. Out of solidarity, Steve drank with them and he started to feel the effects of Thor’s Asgardian liquor.
Clint blinked in surprised at Bruce’s outburst. “Yeah. What he said.” As much as he agreed with Natasha, that Tony and Steve should just finally get together, Bruce was right. All they achieved was upsetting three people, that were really dear to them and the last thing he wanted to do was make it worse.
“Uhm Tony could I talk to you?” Steve asked awkwardly. He would not make the same stupid mistake again and not talk to Tony. If this was going to work, they needed to communicate with each other.
It’s been three weeks since blonde guy first stepped into Tony’s life. Or at least into his close vicinity, which was bad enough.
When Thor finally released Natasha from his embrace, Clint leaned over to her, finally awake enough to form words. “I didn’t know you could knit.”
She returned her attention to the chattering trio of weirdos. “Okay as much fun as it is to watch you embarrass yourselves like this, all of you still need to drink. And I think I speak for all of us when I say that for this one you have to drink double.” Clint and Tony nodded in agreement and even though the three of them looked annoyed at the close-mindedness of Natasha and the others, they complied and drank.
“Yeah that seems unlikely. There are no eggs stuck to the ceiling” Nat mumbled, and Steve was almost glad about the little jab. It’s what Natasha did, and you only ever should worry when she is super nice to you. That means you’re in deep shit. So, he took her comment as a good sign.
He only had been sitting in the room for about ten minutes, when the door opened, and white coat appeared in Tony’s field of vision. The perks of being able to afford private insurance, Tony thought, until he saw who the white coat belong to.
Tony let his gaze wander over the sun deck and out to the ocean, when he heard someone walking up the stairs. Turning around he saw it was Steve who just came back from his usual morning-workout. He wore black shorts and a grey shirt that stretched impossibly tight around his biceps. The sweat made it cling to Steve’s body and you could count the muscles of his six – no eight – pack. Tony unconsciously licked his lips.
He also didn’t care that every other day at exactly 4pm someone came to pick up blonde guy. It was always one of two people picking him up. The first guy was young Denzel Washington type with a stubble that he tried to sell off as a beard and what seems to be a fetish for leather jackets. He never wore the same jacket twice, but always wore the same smug and slightly flirtatious smirk on his face. Guy number two never smiled and always looked like he’d rather be anywhere else in the world. He always wore his brown hair tied put in a man bun, always wore long sleeve shirts and always wore a glove on his left hand.
Steve caught Sam up on all the details on the flight to Bucharest, while Natasha was flying the jet. Since the only time he had met Bucky he was the Winter Soldier and he tried to kill them, Sam definitely had his doubts about the whole operation.
Natasha and Clint seemed to already have come to terms with Bruce’s involvement in all this. They also seemed very… changed. Just now Steve noticed the two of them holding hands and the glances they exchanged. Apparently, they too, were finally together. Then again, he and Tony hadn’t actually talked about what they were to each other. Did their kiss mean that they were a couple now?
The next morning was uncharacteristically quiet. Steve didn’t leave his room, not even for his usual morning run. So, it was just the five of them sitting around the breakfast table and apart from Thor no one was eating. Not that Tony was eating in the morning anyways, he could live on coffee for all he cared, and if it wasn’t for Bruce pestering him about it all the time he would. Now here they were sitting in silence, Nat and Clint looking like two beaten dogs, while Thor shoved waffles into his mouth and Bruce stared very intensely into his muesli bowl.
At the hospital they made Tony sit in a little room by himself, blonde guy and Peter had to wait outside.
Eventually she had convinced him to stay in New York and keep an eye on Stark, because he too looked less than happy about what was going on. Nat knew that he had been trying to find Bucky, Tony wasn’t half as good at hiding things as he thought he was. At least not good enough to hide stuff from her. She had wondered how long it would take Tony to find him and then she had wondered how long it would take him to tell Steve.
Before Steve could answer Clint and Thor stormed back into the room, at least he thought it was them, since all that could be seen were two mountains of pillows and blankets with a pair of feet sicking out at the bottom.
Christmas Eve was spend watching a selection of cheesy Christmas movies. Bruce got his will with "Love Actually", threatening to not cook for them otherwise.
At the end they finally were able to develop a solution against Adhesive X, but the baddies escaped, not before giving them a good beating.
The others watched him leave, a little surprised about the outburst. Nat raised an eyebrow at Tony, who got up as well. “On it.”
That did the trick. Tony turned around to face him, his barely open eye widened, darting between the bag and the file up to Steve’s face. Gone was his sleepy morning face, replaced by a deep frown, the one he only had when something was wrong.
Of course, he knew that Tony was right, but every second spend not helping Bucky seemed like wasted time to him.
Ten minutes later, Steve was sitting on an upturned bucket, watching Tony bang his fist against the door, cursing Natasha and promising her a slow and painful death if she didn’t unlock the door immediately. Steve meanwhile tried to get as much space between them as possible, which wasn’t much in this tiny room. Even standing at opposite sites of the closet, they were almost touching.
Tasha was still giggling like a little girl, so untypical for her and yet it suited her perfectly. “Yes, Captain!”
Even with Natasha’s and Bruce’s affirmations and promises that yes, they were a family and no, Steve didn’t mean what he said, Thor was still hurt. Too often he had ignored harmful words from people he considered family, just to be betrayed by them. Of course, he knew that Steve wasn’t Loki, but still, the pain burning in his chest was the same. So, instead of enjoying a lazy morning in the sun with Bruce, Nat and Clint, he was lying on the giant bed next to Tony.
Before he knew it, Steve felt Thor’s arm wrap around his shoulder and pull him closer to the god’s side. “Not to worry, Captain. All is forgiven. Families fight. Then they make up and have a feast.”
He had fucked it up with Pepper, had seen how hurt she was. Pepper, who was one of the strongest people Tony has ever met. He had been sure, that if he could make it with someone it had to be her. And yet it all ended in tears and heartbreak.
How could he tell him that there could never be more between them than friendship, when Steve looked at him like that?
His mouth still agape, Tony stared down at blond guys very blond and very soft looking hair as he knelt before him. He almost expected porn music to start playing in the background.
Thor finally looked at him, doubt in his eye. “Believe me man, I’m not upset about you. And Steve’s a dick for what he said.”
“I-“ He started again but was interrupted by a Norse God charging at him. Before he knew it, he was being pulled into a rib crushing hug.
“Have you talked yet?” He read out loud and couldn’t help but laugh. “You know Steve, we have very intrusive friends.”
Tony sat up and rubbed the sleep out of his eyes. “Steve, don’t you think that’s a bit, I don’t know rushed?”
Steve couldn't help but smile. He knew from the beginning that Tony was a hot mess, but then again so was he, just in a different way. He knew that Tony's childhood was less than happy, but this was the first time Tony actually spoke of it.
From a purely tactical standpoint this was a good place to stay. Top-floor so everyone coming from downstairs could be anticipated easily; the roof was close enough to the next house so that Bucky, or Steve, would be able to jump that gap, but not too close for a non-enhanced human to do so; there was a small balcony in the back, from which one could escape as well, if necessary. It was a good apartment for someone on the run. And yet Steve could clearly tell that this place, while practical and with only the essential furniture, is where Bucky tried to make a home for himself.
But the what had changed the most were his eyes. They used to have a certain sparkle in them, used to be so full of life.
The beginning wasn’t all that bad. Harry and Sally met, bickered, met other people and then met again. All innocent enough. And then they were in a restaurant.
May, clearly picking up on the tension between him and Pepper, gave Tony an encouraging pat on the back, before she left with Peter, blonde guy right behind them.
“Oh my go- Thor what happened?” Clint asked confused. He walked over to the blonde man and for the first time in while he felt the urge to hug another person.
“Well then, let’s snuggle up and put the movie on.” Bruce said, placing the rest of the food in front of the pillow fort.
Looking around the table he realized that even if they didn’t know how he felt and even though he had been a dick, they were with him.
“You are right. We don’t consider you a friend. You are family.” Steve declared, squeezing the god’s hand.
The only one who wasn’t moving or saying anything was Tony. There was one more apology Steve needed to make and it was by far the hardest.
Steve raised an eyebrow, looking over at Bruce to confirm, that it was in fact in the rules. The scientist knew better than to go against Tony, so he nodded in agreement. “It’s in the rules.”
Thor slung an arm around his shoulder, pulling the smaller man closer to him. “I have to say I did very much enjoy this game of yours.”
“No witty reply, Stark? Are you dying?” Clint joked, earning him a kick under the table from Natasha. That was the second time today and he could already feel the bruises forming under his skin. If she kept going like that, he would look worse than after a fight against the villain of the week, which seriously made him consider holding his tongue and cutting back on the snide comments. But that would be wrong.
Clint just glared up at the god, wondering for the nth time this week why he was friends with those people.
For now, the important thing was to get him back, keep him safe and let him know that he was no longer alone.
Tony made sure to make a lot of noise when he walked in, so he wouldn’t startle Steve. Not that that was even possible, but still. He crossed his arms and leaned against a pillar near the bench press, watching Steve.
“Sorry Mister Stark.” Just like Peter never got used to calling him Tony, he never got used to the kid’s little rambles. And he thought that he was the king of rambling. But he’d be lying if he said that he didn’t enjoy it. Sometimes Peter reminded Tony of himself when he was younger, just without the daddy issues and underage drinking. Like a version of himself that he could have been, if his early life had turned out less messy.
Steve’s smile dropped immediately, before he could stop himself his eyes darted over to Tony, who in turn tried to kill Natasha by sheer willpower. Bruce and Clint were both trying their best not to laugh, while Thor was visibly confused by the sudden tension in the air.
Tony pursed his lips. With his arms still crossed as he turned around and left the kitchen, Steve right behind him, trying to hide his grin.
Choosing to let the foodies be, Tony went further downstairs, to the bottom floor. Apart from Nat’s and Clint’s bedrooms, there was also a game room with a pool table, a dart board, he was sure Clint was going to insist on playing, which as everyone knew was pointless, and a poker table. Naturally there was also a bar in the games room.
He sighed and pushed the suitcase off the bed so he could lie down on it instead. Pulling the blanket over his head, he closed his eyes. He felt like crap and he knew that he deserved it.
A burning fire spread through Tony’s whole body; his hands started to shake. “Get your hands off him!”
The little sack of dried beans Steve was still holding in his hand, burst open, spilling its contents all over the floor. “Tony, I get it! You don’t feel the same. It’s fine! Just forget about it!” In the confined space, Steve’s voice bellowed louder than intended. He was definitely pissed off now.
If Clint, Bruce and Natasha seemed uncomfortable, it was nothing compared to Tony. He had attended a lot of weird dinners. Dinners where no one talked. Dinners where everyone talked at once. Dinners with his father shouting. Not one of them was as strange and puzzling as this one. If he didn’t know any better, he would have sworn, that Steve was having some sort of psychotic breakdown.
“And then I asked if him and me should just stay here while you guys go and if he wanted to see how many marshmallows we can fit into our mouths and he said...”
Steve entered the small apartment, making his way to the kitchen area. He let his hand run over one of the many floral tea towels and a long-forgotten memory pushed itself to the surface.
If anyone had planned on sleeping in on Christmas day, they faced a brutal reality in the form Thor. He had stayed up all night, waiting more or less patiently for sunrise to wake everyone up, so they could open their presents together. So, the moment the sun rose above the New York skyline Thor stormed into everyone’s room to drag them out of bed. The competition for “Person who looked most grumpy about being awake at 7am” was fierce but the runners up were definitely Clint and Tony, who both looked like they were ready to kill as soon as they were awake enough to do so.
After the painting party, Steve actually managed to get both of Tony’s and Bruce’s hands and one of Clint’s feet, they all had dinner together in the kitchen. Bruce had cooked some sort of Caribbean dish that Steve never heard of but very much enjoyed. He always enjoyed Bruce’s cooking and so did everyone else. Thor especially. The man was eating for ten.
Without the toy phone but with a victorious smile on his lips, Tony returned to his friends. “Easy! Now, how about we let our great warrior over here storm into a store shouting ‘for Narnia!’”
Steve couldn’t help but laugh out loud and the sheer ridiculousness of the scene in front of him. It wasn’t everyday that the God of Thunder and one of the most feared assassins in the world were fighting each other. At least not like that.
“The only thing you are is an idiot. Which makes this a room with two idiots in it. Tony, I already knew that you’re sleeping schedule is basically non-existent, we live together. I have nightmares and if you let me, I could try and help you with yours. It doesn’t matter that you never told anyone you loved them, because neither have I. The past is not an issue that could ever push me away from you. You are arrogant, but rightly so. You are a genius! And the world should know how great you are. No one likes to admit when they’re wrong, but I’ve seen you change your mind or view countless times when presented with new information, because you are a scientist and that’s what scientists do. When I said you were nothing without your suit, I didn’t know you. I didn’t know the great things you are capable of, in and outside of your workshop. You have given me, and the others, a home. You were the one who brought us all together and no suit of yours could ever measure up to the strength you show when one of us needs you. I don’t care about your past Tony, about who you once were and who you spend your time with, I care about your present. And your future. And… I would very much like to be a part of that future. If you let me.”
Not wasting any time, Steve practically flew down the stairs and just caught a glimpse of Bucky disappearing into an apartment three floors below. Judging by the absence of screams, Steve assumed that the tenants were either not home, or this was a planed escape route and Bucky had rented that place as well as the one they just came from. Following suit, Steve saw Bucky jumping out over the balcony, landing on the opposite roof. There he picked up his rucksack and ran full speed away from the building behind him.
He kept rambling on about blind backing the crust, but apart from Thor no one was really listening. Clint kept staring at Tony’s fake apron-boobs, earning him a clap on the back of his head from Natasha. “They’re not real!”
Finally, the scene was over, and Steve was able to focus on the screen again, although most of the remaining plot was lost to him. It was just shapes and noises up until they were kissing. They were kissing and fighting and kissing again and all Steve could think about was kissing Tony and then the movie was over.
Tony grabbed the cigars from his suitcase and went back downstairs. Everyone was already gathered around the poker table and Bruce was still trying to explain the rules to Thor, who seemed a bit upset about the special treatment.
Reluctantly Bruce raised his glass, his eyes downcast “Don’t ask.” He mumbled and drank. Tony made a mental note to ask him about that later, because there was no way in hell that he was not going to find out about the time Bruce had sex in public. By the way the rest of them were grinning, Tony was sure that there were going to be some probing questions from them as well. He almost felt sorry for Bruce. Almost.
After that Clint insisted on watching all of the "Die Hard" movies as a treat for sitting through two and a half hours of Hugh Grant.
“Do you want me to kick you again?” Nat asked warningly, which made Clint flinch and back away from her.
Tony massaged the bridge of his nose. “To be honest: Yes. We’ve been out there fighting for three days straight, Fury, and I get that there is a point to that debriefing, but seriously, all we need and want right now is a break.”
“Hey Mister Stark, can we stop by the bodega- oh hi, sorry I didn’t know there was a customer there. I’ll wait in the back.” Peter was about to turn around again, when Hammer grabbed him by the shoulder.
Steve frowned slightly, but didn’t reply, so Nat continued. “All this tension between you and him is killing both of you and to be honest the rest of us too. Sure, it was fun to watch at first but enough fun and games now. You two need to work this out and soon.”
Speechless Tony and Natasha stared at Bruce, who was still wearing his apron which read “All this… and I can cook”.
“He said that only real friends do that.” His answer was barely a whisper. “He also used some bad language words.”
It was something he barely had admitted to himself, let alone anyone else. He was simply scared. On the one hand he wanted things to change in the sense that he wanted to be closer with Tony, so much closer.  But at the same time, he wanted things to stay as they were. They had a good dynamic as a team, as a family and the last thing he wanted was to ruin it, like he already almost did.
On the other hand, there had to be said something about him wearing fake eyelashes as a moustache, Steve thought to himself when Clint had put on the rainbow coloured abomination that Nat for some reason or another had in her purse.
Thor chuckled and let go of Tony’s hand. Nat placed a gentle kiss on his cheek, before she too moved back to her place on the sofa, and so did the rest of them. Minus the kiss.
It sounded like the plot of a mediocre rom-com staring a blonde himbo and a very sexy nerd, who against all odds find love, thanks to their quirky best friends.
Four things happened at once. Bruce nearly chocked on his muesli, Tony spit out his coffee, Clint banged his head against the table and Natasha threw a bagel at Thor.
Tony had called him Captain Rogers. He only did that in two situations, when he was pissed off or when he was teasing Steve. This was definitely not the latter.
Strange’s eyes crinkled at the corners and a low chuckle arose from deep inside his chest. “I didn’t you were that kind of guy.”
Stepping into the shower, he thought about Nat’s expression, wondering what that was about. It was a similar look she shot him the previous night the poker game and a couple of times before, back in New York. She always seemed like she was able to read his mind and it never bothered him before, so why was it bothering him now? Nothing had really changed.
The man in front of Bruce looked at him with wide eyes and slowly backed away from him, before turning around and almost running away.
Thor and Steve set out into the jungle, the latter bringing his sketch book with him to get some drawing done. They walked in comfortable silence for a while, each taking in the beautiful scenery around them.
Shaking his head, he entered his own room and got undressed. Tony always slept naked. Just felt better that way.
Still slightly suspicious Nat got up and sat down next to Steve, handing him the small bottle. “Okay then.”
“Mean woman.” He hissed, but Tony could have sworn there was a hint of a smile in Clint’s eyes. God, those two were almost as bad as, well, never mind.
“Well, you mentioned that you wanted some.” He caught Clint staring at him, shaking his head. “What?”
If there would have been any space, Steve would have taken a step back. Or maybe a thousand. This was what he had been afraid of. This was why he had avoided talking to Tony for so long.
Fury turned to look at the blond soldier. “You just got the crap beaten out of you Captain, you and your team need a breather.”
Natasha took another step toward Steve and narrowed her eyes on him, just like she had done before with Thor. Unfortunately for her, she wasn’t as lucky this time. It took a bit more than her glaring at Steve to intimidate him. Not much more, but still. Also, he really enjoyed teasing his friends like that.
“Oh, Kim just told Kris that she can’t buy the same Christmas decorations as her, because last year Kourtney stole all her decorating ideas from Kim and we really don’t want to repeat that.”
Reading the information Tony had been able to collect, regarding Bucky’s time as the Winter Soldier, as a Hydra-puppet, Steve wasn’t surprised about the look on Bucky’s face. He was sure the information in this folder was just the tip of the iceberg and he couldn’t, didn’t want to, imagine the things they must have done to him.
At exactly 5.30am Tony stepped out of his room, fully dressed and ready for action. And for coffee. And more sleep. This was a terrible idea.
Everyone else stood up immediately, Steve and Thor to coo over the new arrival, Tony and Natasha to shout at Bruce.
Before he could get another word in edge wise, Tony abandoned Steve along with his half-chopped onions in the kitchen and went to inspect Thor’s and Clint’s creation.
Half an hour later everyone was finally ready to leave. Steve lead them around the house to a garage with two SUVs in it.
Bruce came up to Fury, who was watching the couples leave for their rooms. “I gather they finally got their shit together.”
They had walked past a toy shop a few streets back, so it only took Tony a couple of minutes to buy a toy phone. Another couple of minutes later he had handed it over to a very confused looking woman, sitting in a café across the road from where their group was waiting.
Steve was avoiding eye contact which was uncharacteristic of him. Tony remembered how it had irritated him at first that Steve always looked everyone directly in the eyes when they were talking, not breaking contact once. It had made him feel exposed, like Steve’s piercing blue eyes could see past all his defences and right into his soul. Now he didn’t mind so much anymore, to the contrary, he liked how Steve always paid so much attention to whoever he talked to. Especially when he talked to Tony. But now – nothing. Steve seemed to look everywhere but Tony and that was suspicious.
Running his good left hand through his already messy hair, Tony began pacing up and down the small room. “Look I know he was trying to provoke me, and I shouldn’t have given in. But the moment he put his hands on Peter I just saw red. I know what he is capable of and so do you.” Pepper was one of the few people who knew about his suspicions about Justin Hammer, the others being Rhodey and now May.
So, it wasn’t Steve’s tone that made him pause and frown, but the words he had spoken. “What do you mean I don’t feel the same?”
Steve has never seen Bruce’s face, or anyone’s face for that matter, in such a deep shade of red and he couldn’t help himself but laugh.
“You hurt my feelings.” Tony put his best puppy dog eyes on, which to be fair wasn’t even half as good as Steve’s, but it was definitely funnier.
game last night?” Bruce asked, ducking just in time to avoid another airborne breakfast food. Clint grabbed the last of the bagels for himself before that too would get a flying lesson by Natasha.
Only now Tony noticed the haunted expressions on the faces of the others. He had assumed it had something to do with the debacle that was yesterday, but as it turns out there was a brand-new crisis ahead.
When the movie was finally over, Tony risked a small glance over at Steve. He was very conscious about how close they were to each other and it by no means slipped his attention how flustered the super soldier had gotten during the restaurant scene. Not that he had any more control over his own body. Noticing Steve, noticing him looking, Tony abruptly jerked his head around, facing the other way. To his left he found Thor and Bruce yawning and rubbing their eyes, evidently ready to fall asleep at any moment. Clint and Natasha were still snuggled up under their blanket, her head resting on his shoulders, both snoring softly. It made an adorable picture, just like they would make an adorable couple if they finally got their shit together
Tony’s patience was already running thin, it had been a long and very shit day and the last thing he needed was an argument with a self-important neurosurgeon.
If it weren’t for him, Bucky would never have fallen off the train, wouldn’t have ended up as a Hydra experiment.
Steve knew he was out of line. He knew that what he said was horrible and that he had hurt Thor and he was honestly feeling guilty about it. The moment the words left his lips, he felt a pang of regret and he regretted even more, that he didn’t go after Thor to apologize. He was just so… angry.
He couldn’t hold back a short bark of laughter. “Thor, you were the only one with enough balls to actually tell me. I’m upset about the information, not the messenger.”
Strange raised an eyebrow at him and pursed his lips ever so slightly. “You know I’m not supposed to cause pain. There was an oath and everything.”
Thor was happily stuffing his face with the pasta Bruce had prepared, while telling the group about how butterflies loved him because they could sense his godly powers. Everyone listened intently, smiling at Thor’s child-like enthusiasm. Only Steve didn’t seem to pay any attention to the story, staring at his plate as if he wanted the pasta to spill some secrets of national importance. Of course, Natasha immediately noticed how the super soldier tensed up as Tony walked in. She nudged Tony gently and raised an eyebrow at him when he gave her a puzzled look.
Behind her Tony could see Peter and blonde guy- what was he still doing here? – peaking in. Peter was anxiously playing with the hem of his hoody, while blonde guy just looked very confused about what was going on.
Steve took the bottle from her and placed her hand gently on his thigh. “Have you done this before?” Nat asked. Steve just briefly looked up at her and smiled before he started painting her nails. He knew Natasha loved to keep secrets but hated it when someone else did and it was way too much fun to tease her instead of admitting that it was in fact the first time, he painted someone’s nails.
“Steve.” Her voice as soft as her touch, making him turn around. She was looking up at him, eyes full of concern and understanding, a small crease between her brows. She looked… defeated. Gone her usual air of confidence and poise. It was unnerving seeing her like this. Natasha always kept her composure, always made sure to look strong and in control. This was her with all her defences down, no games, no tricks. Just her. Forgotten was the anger he felt towards her for meddling, for scheming behind his back.
Just as everyone on the boat hid away from the sun and settled into bed, Steve finally made his way out of his bed and went downstairs to find the house empty. Looking out on the ocean, he remembered the boat trip they had all planned together and felt another surge of guilt. He needed to find a way to fix this and quickly. Those people were everything he had in this world and he was damned if one outburst, one moment of utter stupidity was the reason he lost them.
Steve rubbed his hand over his face, Thor clearly didn’t understand the concept of Secret Santa, but then again, the important bit was that everyone had a good time.
Nat was about to follow him, but Clint held her back shaking his head. He didn’t know Steve as well as she did, but he knew that it would be better to let him blow off some steam first.
“Forget it, we’ll never find out.” Tony threw his hand up in frustration. He hated not getting his way. And he hated not knowing. He was also slightly turned on by the fact that Steve had a tattoo somewhere that it covered by swim shorts. And by slightly, he meant a lot. The thought of going to find out where the tattoo was, just the two of them, alone, in a bed, made his pants grow a little tighter.
Naturally they fought over who was staying in which room, not even Natasha’s threats could prevent that. Before anyone could get seriously hurt, more than they already were, Bruce made them pull straws.
“I can’t believe this.” Steve mumbled and pressed past Tony and Thor, to talk to the person who was behind all this. “Natasha!”
The grand finale of  my little vacation fic. We have everything the heart wants, angst, fluff and intrigue! I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it!
Every floor had its own bathroom with a bathtub that could easily fit three people, as well as a rain shower, all white marble and glass.
The shocked expression on Tony’s face was priceless and Steve really wished he had a camera to capture this moment forever. Natasha meanwhile doubled over from laughter, which earned her a stern look from Steve. “Hold still or I’m gonna mess it up!”
“Okay chuckleheads, my turn.” Natasha picked a piece of paper and read out loud. “Never Have I Ever gotten I tattoo that I regret.”
So, the responsible thing to do would be to talk to Steve about all of this and make it clear to him, that he had chosen the wrong man. Thank you very much for your interest in Tony Stark, unfortunately we are currently not hiring any hot super soldiers, who make us feel weak in the knees and hard in other places.
As much fun as it was to watch the two idiots tiptoe around each other, Natasha had decided it was time for Steve and Tony to get their shit together. She and Clint had talked about it at length after the hike and after some convincing, that may or may not have included some mild threats from Natasha, Clint had agreed with her. They also worked out a fool proof three step plan on how to get Steve and Tony together.
Tony uncrossed his arms and patted Steve on the back, the grin finally breaking through. “Good talk, Cap.”
Tony’s shoulders dropped. The last thing he needed was a sermon from Pepper, even though he knew he deserved it. He could only imagine what a publicity nightmare this was going to be for her.
Natasha flinched ever so slightly at the harsh comeback, earning Steve a death glare from Clint. He knew that Steve knew how sensitive a topic that was for Nat and how much she tried to leave her past in the past. Bringing it up like this in front of everyone was far from okay.
That was the question that kept him awake at night. It was what he was thinking about almost every day. Did he want there to be something? Did he want Tony to look at him like he used to look at Pepper? Or did he just enjoy being close to someone - anyone? Was he just feeling comfortable with Tony as a friend or was there more? And if there was more on his side, was there also more on Tony’s side? If not and he said something, it could simply ruin everything they had. And if there was something for both of them then… Then what?  They would live happily for two weeks and then kill each other? They would live happily for two weeks and then the team would kill them? They would live happily ever after?
Steve ran a hand through his hair and eyed his half-packed suitcase on the bed. He had been packing his things when Thor had interrupted him and now his resolve of leaving the island and returning back home to New York weakened by the second. First, he needed to apologize to Thor and then he could leave. Maybe he needed to apologize to Tony as well for last night. But then he would leave.
“Fine. You, Sam and me.” Nat was having none of his nonsense. “I can speak the language and as you pointed out so rightly, I know what it is like to be a hunted assassin.”
No one had brought up the topic of Tony's absence since Steve had joined them and he was glad about that. He smiled softly to himself as he watched Natasha braid tinsel into Thor’s hair. Yes, he was upset and hurt about Tony not being here with them, but he would be damned if he let that ruin his Christmas spirit. Steve was taking another sip of Bruce’s homemade extra strong eggnog, when for the second time today Steve's heart clenched upon hearing the elevators 'Ping', but this time it was out of joy.
Wrapping one arm around her shoulder he pressed a soft kiss on the top of her head, before letting her go again.
It wasn’t like he was thinking about something, or someone, in an inappropriate way, that would make him nervous about Natasha knowing.
Taking a deep breath, Steve walked over to her with a tub of her ice cream in his hands as a peace offering. “Natasha.”
Tony stared at her open mouthed. After all these years he should know better than to be surprised by her incredible efficiency, and yet she never failed to amaze him.
Guided more by instinct than anything else Steve found Bucky’s apartment on the twentieth floor. By the sounds of it, or the lack thereof, the apartment was empty.
Morning came and went, and they didn’t talk. Breakfast was spent with them talking about what to do, since it was their last day on the island, before heading back to New York the next morning. Bruce wanted to go back into town to explore a little more, Thor and Steve wanted to go back into the jungle one to see the butterflies, the other one to draw, Natasha wanted to go to the beach again and Clint and Tony just wanted to relax by the pool.
The problem with having a super spy for a friend is that no matter how much you try to hide something, there is no way said friend isn’t going to find out anyways. Meaning that Natasha noticed the exchange and immediately narrowed her eyes at them.
Tony shrugged. “Clint can be a… how do I say this without using a bad language word?” The super soldier rolled his eyes. “Sometimes he can be a pain and when people are like that, we think of ways to make them pay.”
Steve noticed a peculiar tick in Tony’s eye that only ever shower when he was nervous or trying to hide something. But now was not the time, they would talk when they were alone.
Bruce held his hand up to silence the two of them. “First,” he held up one finger, “it is no longer the Stark Tower but the
“You are just afraid mine is bigger than yours.” Tony mumbled at Bruce, who just rolled his eyes in response.
“Of course, we’re going to help him Thor, but we need a plan! What if he is still hostile? What if he doesn’t want to come with us? Where are we going to hide him?” Tony asked.
Steve sighed and ran his hand over his face. “Yeah, yeah, I know I shouldn’t just have stormed out like that but come on! We don’t need a holiday, we need to find those Masters of Evil and bring them to justice!”
Steve leaned against the door, listening to Tony’s footsteps. Only when he heard the other door close, did he move from his. “Rascals?” He was never going to hear the end of that one, but at least it made Tony go away. Steve looked down at himself. If only other things would go away that easily.
Comments and kudos are live giving, so if you like what you read please feel free to share the love.
Saving Bruce from a round of embarrassing questions, Steve continued the game. “Okay, never have I ever… seriously?” The super soldier looked over to Tony and raised a brow at him. “Never have I ever wished I was as smart as Tony.”
“Right boys, who wants to start?” Nat asked, after everyone had finished writing and put their slips of paper in the unbelievably ugly hat.
Despite its formality Steve was more than happy to hear this message. He thanked J.A.R.V.I.S. and a minute later stepped into Tony's penthouse apartment.
At the end it was just him and Natasha left, and the Black Window showed absolutely no mercy. Not that Tony was expecting mercy from her but still, the joy she had stripping him of all his chips was brutal.
Steve walked over to Tony, who was now sitting on one of the deck chairs next to Clint and Nat, both evidently very much in love.
He had also listened to Steve returning and taking a shower. Meaning he had heard the shower run. Because it was right next to his room. It wasn’t like he had actively listened to Steve showering. That would be weird. And Tony wasn’t weird.
Pepper didn’t even look up from her phone, her perfectly manicured fingers flying over the screen. She was wearing an immaculate snow-white suit, her strawberry blond hair tied back in a tight ponytail, lips painted bright red. She looked as perfect as ever.
And he did. He thought back to last month when his insomnia got the better of him again, so he went to the common room to watch an old black and white movie, like he did when he was a child, and fell asleep on the sofa. He had woken up a few hours later covered by a blanket, Steve sitting next to him with a hot chocolate in his hand and a second mug on the table for him.
Neither of them wanted to leave, for one enjoying their little paradise far too much, and also because they were afraid their new-found happiness would collapse as soon as every day life had taken over again.
It all started a few months ago, when Steve couldn’t sleep and actually got bored of the gym, so instead he wandered into the common room where he found Thor sitting on the sofa with a giant bowl of chips. On the TV there were a bunch of loud women shouting at each other and Thor shouting at them.
“You know, I don’t think she’s gonna let us out any time soon.” Steve said quietly, worried he would upset Tony even more.
Tony’s smile faltered a little. “Uhm… well I’ve got you in the Not-so-secret-Santa and uhm…I’ll give you your present later. When we’re alone.”
By the third movie the only ones still watching were Clint himself and Thor. Natasha had fallen asleep with her head resting in Clint's lap and Bruce had disappeared into the kitchen to start cooking for the next day.
Nevertheless, a decision needed to be made. They had narrowed it down to “Dirty Dancing”, “When Harry Met Sally” and “Brokeback Mountain”. There was a hard veto against “Brokeback Mountain” from Tony and Clint, because the last time they had watched it (together), both of them had to cry and Clint decided that the glitter-moustache was enough humiliation for the day.
Bruce sighed and shook his head. “I’ll explain later.” He glanced over at Tony, who shifted uncomfortably in his seat.
Bruce and Tony busied themselves in the kitchen while Clint and Thor were taking care of the construction of a pillow fort.
After they had finally finished dinner, they almost ran back to the cars. Everything to escape this situation. They rode back in the same group, but this time Nat was driving instead of Steve.
Sitting there uncomfortable and only too aware of all the places their bodies touched, Steve started the movie, hoping it would distract him from being so close to Tony.
An annoyed groan went through the crowed and Nat hit Tony on the arm. “Ow!” It didn’t really hurt, it was just a reflex. And the fact that Tony was a drama queen. “You’re all just upset because it’s true. You do wish you were as smart as me.” This time it was a pillow thrown by Clint, hitting his face and Tony’s shocked and overly theatrical facial expression made Steve laugh out loud.
But Tony was so happy that Steve found such a good friend in Nat and that the man had someone he could trust.
He thought back to all the times Steve came down to his workshop to bring him something to eat, because he knew that Tony forgot to eat when he was working.
To distract himself from Steve’s… well everything, Tony picked the next slip out of the hat. “Never have I ever given or received a lap dance.” He read. “Oh, please who hasn’t?”
Now Natasha finally understood why Tony had hesitated that long. She had expected Steve to be over the moon about finding Bucky and not to fly off the handle like that.
Steve watched on in amazement how Clint tried to negotiate with Natasha, and he was very, very glad that it wasn’t him graveling before her. There was a reason why she was the best.
“Believe it or not, but even neurosurgeons have to go though all of medical school.” Strange said, putting on a pair of rubber gloves.
What did bother him was that he didn’t see Aunt May as often as he used to. Usually he would go to her bakery during his lunch break and they would sit together and drink coffee and just talk. She made sure he would eat, and he would make sure that she didn’t work too hard. Now he only saw her when he visited her at home, after he closed his bookstore. She was allowed to go back home two weeks ago but was still weak and most of the time already asleep when Tony came by.
It pained Steve that his lover had to endure so much pain and hurt throughout the years and he would give everything to turn back time and undo all of it. But since going to the past and altering things, especially to such an extent was impossible, he vowed to do his best to make Tony's present the happiest it could be.
Thor and Tony were sitting next to each other in the sand. Tony holding a bucket and Thor holding a plastic shovel.
Clint nodded in approval, again reaching for the gummy bears. “And anyways, marshmallows aren’t real food.”
“Oh sh-“ He didn’t even get to finish swearing, interrupted by laughing. Their bodies were still very close, and Steve could feel Tony’s whole form shaking with laughter.
“Going swimming without any clothes.” Bruce explained, while lifting his glass to take a sip. So was everyone else. Including Steve.
Steve thought. Direct and quick. But definitely not gentle and it hurt a little. Or a lot. That’s how he would describe Natasha right now.
Someone kicked his leg under the table, which made Tony turn back around to the group. Nat was raising an eyebrow at him, barely managing to suppress a smirk.
Through the open window he could hear Natasha and Thor making a lot of noise in the pool downstairs.
“It’s a movie where a closet is a door to another world and there is a talking lion.” She tried to clarify.
“Oh, you think this is funny, Rodgers? Let’s see how funny you find going in that pet-store over there, grabbing some bird seed and asking how long it takes for the birds to grow from it!”
“I will show you,” Steve started, but before he could get any further, he got interrupted by loud cheering and Clint’s wolf whistling.
She could feel Clint grinning behind her, could feel the little puff of air tickling the back of her neck. She was a hypocrite and she knew it. Her and Clint have been dancing around each other like this for months now. Stolen touches, meaningful glances, shameless flirting. But not once had they actually talked about what was going on between them.
Before they got into the car, Tony caught a glimpse on man bun standing on the other side of the street, arms crossed, looking less than pleased. Blonde guy exchanged a few words with him, which seemed to only increase man bun’s bad mood, but Tony had other things to worry about.
Suddenly there was an arm around her shoulders and Nat looked up at Clint. “I need to fix this.” She whispered and he pulled her into a hug.
“You must have the wrong address. The owner of this bakery doesn’t want to sell her place. To anyone.”
Finally, everyone clamed down enough to continue with the distribution of the presents. Absentmindedly, Clint tossed Tony a package. “Here. Enjoy it, there is more where that came from, but you won’t get any.”
Steve paced around in the kitchen. Sat back down. Got up again. Why did it take them so long to walk up the stairs? He rearranged the plates on the dining table.
Steve was shooting him a disapproving look, but everyone else seemed to agree with Tony, for once. After a brief moment of silence Fury crossed his arms and nodded. “That’s why I’m gonna send you away for a week. Outside the city, outside the country.”
A broad smile took over Steve’s face. He shrugged his shoulders, like the information he had just given Tony was nothing special. “You had to be careful back in my day and nowadays I have to make sure no one recognises me for who I am but… you wouldn’t be my first.”
If looks could kill, Thor would have dropped dead the moment he announced the completion of his masterpiece. In her frustration, Natasha nearly kicked the whole thing in. At last Steve had grown some balls and approached Tony and now this. Of course, she knew that Thor didn’t do this on purpose, but that didn’t help Nat feeling any less frustrated. And by the sound of Steve attacking the onions, he felt the same. What would it take for him and Tony to finally work it out? It looked like the gods, or at least one of them, were against them.
Yesterday, when Tony said that he would give Steve his present later when they were alone, Steve had expected everything from mattress gymnastics to a complicated tech gimmick, but certainly not this. This… this was more than he could ever hoped for.
Focus, Rogers! This was neither the time, let alone the place for this. Sitting in a cave of pillows with his four best friends was not how he had imagined the two of them getting together and oh how he had imagined it.
Natasha kicked his leg under the table. She really did that a lot lately, but that was to be expected, when she was surrounded by imbeciles all the time. “Snap out of it Stark! For some reason, that will forever be a mystery to me and the rest of mankind, Steve is in love with you. Now if it were up to me, I wouldn’t have told you, at least not like this, but thanks to the god of idiocy over here,” she gestured towards Thor, “my plans went out the window.”
Tony hadn’t looked at him this morning. But then again that was to be expected, after Steve’s horrible, horrible flirting attempt. He hadn’t been able to sleep all night, which happened a lot lately. So, instead of getting some desperately needed rest, he had stared at the ceiling and thought of ways to fix this whole mess.
Natasha narrowed her eyes slightly, fixing her gaze on Steve, but he was avoiding everyone’s eyes. “As much as I hate to agree with Stark,”
Tony looked up at Peter over the rim of his reading glasses and slowly put the book down that he had been reading.
Steve crossed his arms and narrowed his eyes. “It’s on Banner. And you’re next.” He pointed his finger at Tony, who was still giggling.
He put his hands up defensively, trying not to laugh. “Whoa calm down Natasha, I was going to offer my help.” It was adorable how upset Nat got about something so trivial and how her lips pursed, and eyebrows sunk low when she got angry.
Steve’s jaw twitched. All of this made sense now, her and Clint insisting on playing this stupid game, them whispering behind everyone’s back, Nat’s questions earlier that day on the hike.
With another sigh he placed the phone back on the dresser next to the bed and started to get changed. He didn’t want the others to be waiting for him.
Before the inventor could get up, Tasha and Clint rose from their chair, holding hands. “We’ll… leave you. Bye.” And off they went downstairs to their rooms to, well, be alone.
Bruce took a deep breath. “Because we just found out that there is a town to go to and you can’t just go into town without a propose. So, we’re going shopping.” It sounded like he was reciting something he had been told over and over again.  Natasha patted him on the head, looking very pleased with herself.
If it weren’t for Peter sitting outside the room, Tony was sure he would have cursed like a drunken sailor on leave.
“Please Mister Stark.” Tony hadn’t even noticed that Peter had moved to his side until the boy spoke.
The god thought for a moment before his face fell in shock and he looked at Tony. “Don’t tell Tony.”
Like a whirlwind Peter made his way to the back of the shop, his hair was a mess like usual and he seemed a little out of breath. “You never guess what happened today sir. So, you know this new girl in our school Shuri, she’s like a princess or something from a super small country like Genovia, you know from the Princess Diaries, but in Africa and she always knew she was a princess so maybe not like that at all, but anyways so she and Flash don’t get along at all, which isn’t really a surprise because, well, you know Flash and so he went up to her and said something but I didn’t hear what because I was talking to Ned in the hall, and did I tell you he got a Lego Deathstar and we’re gonna build that tomorrow evening, but anyway so Flash was being weird to Shuri even though we told him to cut it out and she was super calm while he talked trash and then suddenly BOOOOM she had like those super weird gloves on and Flash was lying on the floor and papers flew everywhere and I guess the gloves were like blaster things, you know, and it was so cool she just walked away from him like a total badass and everyone was speechless but it was awesome, well I guess not for Flash or for her because she had to go to the principal’s office and her brother, who is like a king or something, had to come and pick her up and he didn’t look very happy but Ned, MJ and I thought it was really awesome and before she left we asked her to be part of our study group and she said yes, so now I’m friends with a real princess, but she said if we call her a princess she will blast us like Flash, but I guess it isn’t too bad because he was barely hurt and those blasters are really awesome, it must be like a repulsor technology or something you know.”
It was hard to tell who was more in shock. Tony took off his sunglasses, raising an eyebrow at him, Steve and Natasha exchanged a concerned look. Clint had a shit eating grin plastered on his face. Since he usually was the only one allowed in the kitchen, he felt very privileged.
“You should be.” Bruce mumbled and Steve’s smile dropped immediately. Okay, there was definitely a list. And now his palms were getting sweaty again. Great.
“Yes, I get it.” The tick in Steve’s jaw and the thin line of his lips gave away, that he was getting agitated, but Tony needed him to understand. Needed to make him see why this could never happen.
Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse.
It was a very close call between Clint and of course Thor. Both of them were too stubborn to let the other one win, so they ended up shoving more and more marshmallows into their mouths until Clint accidently inhaled one and nearly chocked. Naturally, Natasha fell into a laughing fit, because in her opinion choking on a marshmallow was the glorious death Clint deserved. Thor meanwhile took Clint nearly dying as a sign for his own victory, celebrating it by jumping on the sofa and raising his arms into the air and shouting… something. Since his mouth was still stuffed with the fluffy white treats, it was impossible to understand him. At least it was for normal humans.
After almost scrubbing his skin raw under the shower, Tony got changed into a pair of grey sweats and an old AC/DC shirt.
Thor seemed to be able to read his mind, but then again if two people spend enough time together that was bound to happen. “A lot could go wrong. But what if it works?”
Natasha squeezed in between the two and at glared at them. “Don’t you dare fight. We have one week off and I won’t spend it listening the two of you bickering all day long. I hear one more word and I will personally see to it that you will regret getting out of the ice,” she pointed at Steve, then turned to Tony, “and inventing that suit of yours! Is that understood?!”
“Admit? What’s there to admit? Anyone who isn’t convinced that you can kill them in their sleep, kill them in
Steve didn’t seem to notice, he just smiled slightly and nodded. “Yeah. Good. You should come some time.”
Clint finally removed his hands from his face, just so he could roll his eyes at Tony. “Yeah because that’ll make Steve’s feelings go away.”
And if Tony didn’t feel the same, well then what was the point in talking? According to Nat, he already knew about Steve’s feelings for him and surely if he was reciprocating his feelings then he would have said something by now. Unless he was as much as a coward as Steve was. Which brings him exactly to the same point he was last night, before Thor accidently interrupted him.
“Steve and I will drive ahead in one car and you boys can take the other one and follow.” It wasn’t a question, more like an order and not even Clint dared arguing with Natasha.
Bruce pursed his lips and shook his head. “No, you heard right. I’m tired of cooking for you children. It’s time you learned how to take care of yourself!”
“Your pain always brings joy to us.” Bruce mumbled, earning a glare from Tony. The next pillow hit Bruce in the face, Natasha narrowing her eyes at him.
“I mean, Tony, that I am no longer the owner of the bakery. In fact, I think it’s a tea shop now. Sold it to a very nice young man, stunning eyes, good manners.”
Still frowning and wondering what Nat was on about, Tony went upstairs. The light in Steve’s room was still on so, he gently knocked on the door. “Steve?”
Bruce wasn’t physically hurt but during the fight the other guy came out to play as well, and that always drained all energy out of him.
The blond soldier looked up from his masterpiece at Tony. “Well that depends. Have you been a good boy?”
Looking at himself in the mirror in his bedroom, Tony sighed deeply. There were dark circles under his eyes, which to be fair wasn’t that unusual, and neither were the frown-lines on his forehead. He was a mess. Sure, he wasn’t as bad as he used to be. He had stopped doing drugs and prostitutes. He didn’t drink as much anymore and apart from the occasional poker night with the team he didn’t gamble either. But that didn’t mean he was good. He was still Tony Stark, certified mess. Working too much, sleeping too little, eccentric, stubborn and always needed to have the last word. How could anyone be into that?
First things first, she had to complete Thor’s dare. Nat put on her best fake tourist smile and walked up to the ice cream truck. She ordered a scoop of vanilla in a cone, took a deep breath and smashed it against her forehead after asking the vendor if he believed in unicorns. Without waiting for a reply from the puzzled guy, she mustered up as much of an air of “Obviously it is completely normal for me to have an ice cream cone stuck on my forehead” as she could, which was quite a lot, and walked back to the guys.
Steve grabbed his shield and exited the jet with Sam, who after giving Steve a reassuring nod, took off to keep watch on the opposite roof.
“I messed up.” He admitted, clinging to the ice cream in his hands like his life depended on it. His whole body was tense, and he was barely able to hold eye contact with Natasha. But he’d be dammed if he was the first one to look away. He needed her to know that he meant business, that he knew he made a mistake and that it wouldn’t happen again.
Bruce chuckled at Nat’s description of the game. Naturally, he knew what this was actually about, he had noticed her and Clint whispering, plus he wasn’t stupid. It was painfully obvious that there was something going on between Steve and Tony and it was also obvious that the two of them were idiots, so this had the potential to be a lot of fun. And Bruce had already some great ideas about what to write on his papers.
For once in his life he didn’t know how to respond. No comeback. No witty remark. No cheesy one-liner. All Tony could do was stare up into Steve’s eyes, no longer brilliant blue but dark, pupils dilated to the fullest. Tony’s muscles were tense under Steve’s grip, his skin hot everywhere their bodies touched. And one place they didn’t touch.
“Yes, ma’am.” The soldier mumbled, Tony just shrugged, but apparently that was enough confirmation for Nat, her scolding expression being replaced by a big grin.
Thanks to the brilliant, but insufferably arrogant brain surgeon, May was on the path of recovery and Tony was sure she would take over the bakery again in a few months.
Tony only hesitated a second, opened his mouth to speak but instead shook his head and pushed the button to call the lift. The quiet 'Ping' announcing its arrival broke Steve's heart. Without another word from either of them the elevator doors slid closed and Tony was gone.
Steve stepped in behind him, reaching over Tony’s head to grab the beans from the top shelf. “Got ‘em!”
Tony flinched, he had forgotten that Thor was lying next to him. “Nothing.” He looked over at Thor and sighed, upon seeing his sad face. “Ignoring what you accidently told me. That’s a good plan.”
Apparently, his face, even hidden, betrayed his emotions because Bruce placed an arm around Tony’s shoulder.
Before he could stop himself, Tony leapt up from where he was sitting on the floor, closed the very short distance between them and took Steve’s face in his hands. Not a second later their lips touched and for the first time ever Tony’s head was silent. No self-doubt, no questions, no thoughts. Just peace. Nothing had ever felt this right before in his life and he’d be damned if he ever stopped kissing Steve.
His eyes glued to the floor, Steve quickly wiped away a runaway tear, when he felt a hand rest on his knee.
There was still one present to be delivered. Steve stood up and handed the box over to Nat. “I hope you’ll like them.”
Thor’s face dropped. “We can not have that. The battle will take place after we made the moat.” And with that he handed Tony the shovel. The inventor immediately went to work, fortifying the wall of concern.
By the time they were finished it was nearly 2am and Bruce had fallen asleep with his head on the table.
“But no one asked you, Stark.” Clint snapped. Even though his dare was quite harmless, he still seemed very tense, which made Steve wonder what the archer had whispered into Natasha’s ear. She did say something about a quit pro quo. Poor Clint.
“Tony?” Steve stood in the doorframe, file in one hand, bag in the other. Tony had his back turned towards the door, one leg poking out from under the blanket, hair sticking up in all directions. He looked adorable and Steve had to fight the impulse of just climbing back into bed with him.
Instead of smiling at Tony, Steve did some weird thing with his lips, basically baring his teeth at Tony. Every time Tony looked him in the eyes, Steve stared at him for a second, eyes bulging, before he jerked his head around and looked the complete opposite way and when he actually did hold eye contact, he almost squeezed them shut completely closed. His version of a brief and light conversation was him asking “Do you like the food?” and then, before Tony could even answer properly, turning away again to talk to someone else. But the worst thing was probably the body language. Steve sat in his chair, legs spread as wide as he could and when he returned from the toilet he stood right in front of Tony with his hands on his hips, which Nat could only imagine was his implementation of an “open stance” and “turning his body towards Tony”. Nat was horrified. And it took quite a lot to horrify her, she took pride in that.
“Well, that sounds nice.” Steve nodded again and licked his lips. Why was his mouth so dry again? And why was he still blushing?
“I think he’s right. We shouldn’t rush into this. We need to be careful. After all he is a hitman with a price on his head.”
He and Steve made their way back down to the beach, when they heard shouting. Exchanging a brief glance, they sped up to see what the commotion was about.
The whole time he had reasoned with himself how ridiculous it was to think that, had even asked Rhodey for advice and frankly was lucky not to get hit over the head by him.
Steve couldn’t help but smile, as he picked up one of the half-empty packs of cookies. It seemed like Bucky being a sweet tooth hadn’t changed at all and neither had his unwillingness to do the dishes, or the state of constant chaos he left behind everywhere.
Steve rubbed the back of his neck. “Uhm, yeah, I guess I was thinkin about what happened. In New York I mean. Hope we’ll catch those rascals. Right, I should go back to bed. Good night.”
“We will see about that.” Tony turned on his heel and without looking back exited the shop. He would put things straight and he would kick this guy out of May’s bakery and fix the damage his builders had done to it.
Tony observed Thor shovelling dry sand into one of the buckets, turn it over and watch it fall apart.
They had been called to a mission over three days ago. All they were told at the time was that a group of previously unknown people were attacking New York with glue. Tony had been sure that he just misheard Fury, but as it turned out that was exactly what was going on. A group called “Masters of Evil” had developed a substance they called Adhesive X and until a couple of hours ago there was no known solution for it, so it stuck to everything it touched. The Masters of Evil, actual identities still unknown, covered the whole city in the stuff. There was extensive damage to buildings, the infrastructure and there even have been some casualties. Tony and Bruce had been working on a solution for Adhesive X, while the rest of the Avengers were working on helping the civilians and most importantly keep the Masters from doing anymore damage.
When he peered over at her again, she gave him a small nod. Permission to speak again. “I did something about it. I yelled at him and slammed my door shut in his face. That ought to take care of it.” He sounded more tense, than he had intended, his hands wrapped tightly around the steering wheel, knuckles white.
“The man who owns the teashop opposite you and drove you here.” So that was his name. Good to know, Tony thought.
“Sorry man.” Steve turned his head from watching after Tony, to Bruce, who smiled softly at him. Instead of replying, the super soldier took the knife Tony had left behind and continued chopping onions, although chopping might be the wrong word, it was more of a bashing.
The helplessness and sheer resignation in Steve’s voice, made Nat soften a little. “It’s not that difficult. There are basically seven easy steps you need to follow, and you can’t go wrong. First: Make eye contact, small glances and catching his eye. Hold the gaze briefly and then look away and smile. Two: Smile more. Preferably slowly and not like a maniac, maybe crinkle your eyes or something.”
Most of the day went by in a lazy haze, all of them relaxing by the pools, dozing in the sun, reading or swimming to cool down, it was simply too hot to move any more. At some point someone suggested having a picknick on the beach and they made their way down to the little bay in front of the house. Thor grabbed a couple of things from the mystery closet, where he also got the pool inflatables from, wrapped whatever he got in a towel, while the rest of them carried the food Bruce and Clint had prepared. The food was delicious as usual, they had all sorts of tapas because Bruce was feeling “Spanish”.  They had long stopped questioning the logic behind the food choices Bruce made for them and just let the man do his thing.
“I wouldn’t have any stress if it weren’t for a certain someone,” here she fixed her eyes on Tony again, “behaving like a Baboon high on testosterone!”
Thor nodded in agreement. “It is very foolish, that our Captain is upset, just because he is in love with you.”
If Steve only could muster up the courage to talk to Tony, he might get that sight a lot more often. But if there was one thing this team didn’t do, it was talking to the people they had feelings for.
He hated walking behind Steve. He hated the way Steve had hugged Natasha so close and how he had kissed her head.
Clint had tried to convince them that he should come with, arguing that he could fly the jet and that it would be good to have another pair of helping hands. Of course, Natasha knew that this was about how Steve had spoken to her this morning. The jab about her past didn’t sit well with him at all. She wasn’t that thrilled about it either, making a mental note to talk to Steve about that when he had calmed down a little, but Clint… It was him who had made the call to bring Nat in instead of following his orders. It was him who convinced her to come with him, to choose to be better. It was him who stood up for her, when they barely even knew each other. So, to him an attack on her felt like an attack to him. It was sweet really. And she loved him for that, even though she hadn’t even said that to him yet.
Steve just shrugged, a small smile on his lips and drew the next slip before anyone could ask questions. “Never Have I Ever Thought Natasha Could Kill Me in My Sleep.”
Well that wasn't entirely the case in the Avengers Tower. In fact, there were a lot of things stirring; Clint, Natasha, Bruce and Thor were decorating a 4m Christmas tree (and each other) while two floors above them, Steve and Tony had their first fight. First fight as a couple that is. God knows they had more than a few rows back when they were just team-mates.
Before she could even finish her sentence, he was all over the presents, looking for the one addressed to him. No two minutes later, the floor was littered with wrapping paper. Thor was holding up a hand-knitted throw depicting the nine realms aligned along Yggdrasil, the tree of life. Thor stared at it, speechless.
Mumbling to himself, he got up for a refill. It would be easier if he could love Pepper. It would be easier if he could stop staring at Steve.
Tony stirred in his sleep and Steve quickly stepped away from the gap in the curtains like he was a little boy being caught stealing candy out of a jar. He quickly made his way to his own room and told himself that he was just tired and still stressed from the fight and that this didn’t mean anything. This was just a stress thing.
Natasha shifted her focus from Thor’s tinsel-hair and shot Steve a questioning look, as if to ask if Tony is forgiven for leaving in the first place. He couldn't help but give a little chuckle before he nodded.
Nat kicked Bruce’s leg under the table and the scientist yelped. “Ow! I mean… Oh! That sounds like a great idea. Let’s all go for a hike!”
Tony eventually had enough of losing against Clint and decided it was time to play a game he was good at. Poker.
Trying his best to push down the feeling of rejection, the pain - and dear god were those tears trying to escape him? – he nodded slowly. “Yeah. Ridiculous. Just… forget that… I mean you don’t… It’s fine.”
“Ha! I do not think that the spider-woman can kill me. Not even in my sleep!” Thor declared proudly.
Hammer’s face twisted into a sneer. “I see. Grooming the next generation, are we? Tell you what kid, if you ever want to work for a real man, call me.” With that Hammer wrapped one arm around Peter’s shoulder and with the other slid a business card into the pocket of Peter’s jeans.
Natasha already had a spoonful of ice cream in her mouth, Thor was halfway through the poptarts and Bruce had started on his pasta mumbling something along the lines of it getting cold.
“I don’t think you are.” Blonde guy objected, looking down at Tony’s right fist. It looked like someone had dipped it in red paint, the knuckles broken open offering a glimpse at the bone underneath and Tony could have sworn that it wasn’t his. He uncurled the fingers to stretch them out and pain shot up his arm straight to his head, making him sway a little. Maybe blonde guy was right.
Upon hearing this everyone stopped smiling and moved over to Thor. Bruce immediately had one arm wrapped around Thor’s middle, Tony took one of his hands and Nat climbed over the sofa behind the god and hugged his back, placing her head on his shoulders. Clint knelt down in front of him between his legs, with his head resting on Thor’s knee, while Steve scooched over, next to Tony and grabbed Thor’s other hand.
Steve looked at each of them in turn and crossed his arms. Naturally, he had figured out that they were lying, but he also knew that there was no shaking them. They looked like bloodhounds chasing their prey. And he was the prey.
The blonde god shot Steve a desperate look, they both knew he was going to break, that the pressure and the questioning and curious stares from everyone was just too much for him. Steve couldn’t let them break him, he was a soldier after all and when he saw one of his men under fire, he couldn’t just leave him behind. He was the Captain.
The god lifted his head but didn’t look at Tony. “Because I’m the one who informed you about Captain Roger’s feelings for you.”
“It warms my heart that you think I’m beautiful.” Tony deadpanned, making his way over to the coffee machine, all the while trying his best not to look at Steve, who was sitting at the head of the dining table.
No matter if it was leather jacket or man bun, or sometimes both, who picked him up, Steve always embraced them, and his face lit up like the sun as soon as they stepped into the shop.
It was like they changed roles. Tony was the voice of reason, suggesting forming a plan of action first, and Steve had turned into the impulsive, irresponsible hothead.
“I’m sorry.” Steve breathed, making Thor squeeze him even harder. “Okay. Air. Getting hard to breath. Thor!”
Now it was Steve’s turn to almost choke on his food. He quickly turned away praying to god no one noticed, and he was almost lucky enough to get away with it. But he should have known better with Nat in the room. And if it weren’t for the fight they just had, she would have called him out on it. The odd thing was that it felt wrong that she said nothing and instead just joined Thor and Clint on the sofa. Sure, neither of them was openly mad at him anymore, apart from maybe Tony, but Steve could feel that there was still some resentment. Hopefully they just needed to spend some more time together to get back to normal.
It frustrated Steve immensely that he didn’t get all the pop culture references the others made. The only one who was about as clueless as he was, was Thor and to be honest he was glad that he wasn’t alone in this. He had found a sort of studying partner in the God of Thunder and he was extremely grateful for it too. They had spent countless evenings and nights together, watching movies and TV shows the others kept talking about. He hoped that those nights with Thor and huge bowls of popcorn weren’t over after what he had done. Because Steve had an ever-growing list, now adding “Brokeback Mountain” and “Dirty Dancing” to it. It’ll show them how he can handle the dance-scene. Whatever it was.
If Steve had to sum up this week, he would have to say it basically consisted of awkward exchanges and surprised silences.
Suddenly nervous, Steve took a deep breath and took out the lockpicking tools Natasha had given him for his last birthday. Even with his trembling fingers, the lock didn’t pose a problem to Steve. Taking in another deep breath, he pushed the door open and for the first time in 70 years he entered Bucky’s home again.
May laughed and rested her head back on the pillow. “I have tasted your cooking, dear, and trust me when I say, you would burn down the place in less than a week.”
Thor looked over at him with a thankful smile. “Would you like to join? I’ve read on the Internets that this is a beach tradition.”
