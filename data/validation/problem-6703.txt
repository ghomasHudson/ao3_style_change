Even since leaving the hospital couldn't shake that uneasy feeling he had. He was able to push it down and ignore it for a bit but it was beginning to eat at him. "..I can't.." What did that mean? What was he trying to tell me? It was like he was afraid of closing his eyes or something. Maybe that's why he forced himself to stay conscious when it would have been easier to drift off and not feel anything for a while.
"Maybe there's hope for us yet." Thor said cheerfully, having only known these mortals for less than a week was actually beginning to feel sympathetic towards them. He felt nervous about what was to become of the man of iron. But he held hope after growing up watching warriors from his land lay down their lives day after day. He'd found it more of a routine, you live and die for what you believe in. He watched friends of his fight and eventually slain in battle. But this, this was somehow different. They know each other for a pathetic amount of time, nowhere long enough to care what would happen to them.
"My forensics shows me that it made of a material called Vibranium. I assume you've deducted this conclusion even before I have Ms. Romanoff." Jarvis informed the woman patiently waiting for forensics. He also pulled up on the big screen the detailed information about the mass and composition of the item. Even leaving some specs on Tony's blood type which coated it. Natasha sat down at the counter with Clint to her side as they both of them looked up at the giant monitor.
"Tony don't worry about a thing. The worst is over. It's up hill from here keep that in mind ok?" He smiled, trying his best to comfort him. From what he'd learned from experience on the battlefield the best thing you can do is to just keep up hope. He wasn't able to predict the future but nothing good can come from being pessimistic. That wouldn't help whatsoever; he just didn't want to lose Tony. He was the only tether to his past. He was his ally and friend, the son of Howard.
Something bright caught his eye it peaked his interest. He carefully shifted around some other photos noticing it lit up the back of the drawer whatever it was. He carefully reached inside and pulled out Tony’s first chest arc reactor. After the Obadiah incident he kept it close, after all damn thing save his life twice.
After a while Steve figured it was time to clean himself off a little bit after all he was still covered in blood. He looked himself in the mirror; it'd been a long time since he'd seen himself look so unsure. He had looked lost, his eyes wondered from the broken expression on his face to his dark and bloodied buttoned up shirt as well as up his forearms. He turned the faucet on and pumped some soap into his hand and scrubbed them. The blood had plenty of time to dry making it harder to wash away. It was even up underneath his finger nails.
Blood falling in large quantities by then, the prints made by feet scuffing around him. Trailing the red in all directions, if he didn't know any better he would have thought he was staring back at a crime scene. Like some sick bastard gutted his victim and attempted to paint a picture with the precious copper liquid that sustained life.
Dr. Helshier thought it best for Tony's guests to leave and get some rest themselves. After all they have been here for a painstaking amount of time and what their friend really needed right now was a good amount of stress-free rest. They decided it was best to take his advice there wasn't much they could do at this point other than wait plus they did need to let the others know the good news.
"Thank you Steve.." The blond blushed slightly under the others arms not expecting those words to ever leave Tony's lips. He smiled under his warmth although he was pretty sure it was a growing fever. He ran a steady hand down his side, feeling the roughness of the bandages under his fingertips. He frowned at the thickness of the cloth, motioning over the wound light caressing it and felt something wet. 'I hope his wounds didn't reopen because of his stubbornness.' He thought to himself. "How are you feeling Tony?" The other asked quietly knowing he had his full weight on him by this point.
"Ste.. Steve.. " Tony was to the point where he could hardly choke out any words. "I'm scared.." He was losing blood fast. He continued to spit up mouthfuls of blood and some ran out of his nose. Steve narrowed his eyebrows and wiped away the liquid using the sleeve of the casual jacket he was wearing. He hated seeing the highly respected man in such a pitiful state. It killed him. He had known his father long before coming to know Tony and he's surpassed him in so many was. He admired the man and was not going let this be the end of him. So help him.
It was funny he spent half his life idolizing the man to his right and the other half resenting him. Tony was a logical thinker and no matter how he looked at the question he still couldn't figure it out. He didn't even know him until about a week ago and it just didn't add up. "Why do you care so much anyway?" Tony chuckled painfully but he couldn't help it. He had to know. That last remark caught Steve off guard but attention in an instant, drawing it away from Banner suddenly leaving the room. He instantly went from being worried to angry, "how could I not care?!" He retorted a little harsher then he was meaning to. But to him it was a stupid question to ask.
After working with someone for so long you begin to learn more about them than they probably know about themselves. You start to pick up their habits; way of doing things, the way they talk or act how they are under pressure or in a different environment, even the way they smell is imprinted in your own mind. They were best friends; they looked out for each other no matter what happened. It'd be pretty sad if they didn't fully know each other after years of working together. Especially given their skill set.
"Bruce.. If you keep calm.. I'll let you.. Tinker with some of my... New toys in the lab.." Tony said panting through gritting teeth. With every word a small amount of blood would bypass the enamel barricade and trickle down in the crease of his parted lips as he managed a weak smile.
The driver said in a low tone, his voice matching his physique. He looked over his shoulder at the two men sitting in the back seats, looking for an answer. Upon laying eyes on them he noticed just exactly who the hero's in civilian clothing were, none other than Captain America and another fellow who wasn't so easily distinguishable.
He pulled his gaze away from the city and looked over to Bruce who had his chin resting on one of his palms with his mouth hanging open and a stream of drool running down his arm which made Steve giggle. He looked comfortable as far as he knew; honestly he could never sleep like that. He sighed and looked up at the digital clock in the corner of the room; it was almost one in the morning. He rubbed his eyes and heard something from behind him. It was light grunting that sounded strangely familiar. He paused for a moment before he realized who was behind him. He looked back to see Tony wincing and slightly moving his head to the side in discomfort.
He must have been about 100 yard away from the missile by this point although it was coming in pretty fast it was still far from the city. Maybe less than five minutes or so before it would actually hit anything. Tony glanced around the area for a second and figured this would be the best place if any to detonate the projectile. It was nowhere near anything that would take on damage; it was being far enough away. Right outside the city just before it could be met with any sort of skyscraper.
A shaky yet firm hand reached out and grasped the wrist of the doctor before he was able to inject the substance into the IV. His finger tips dug into his sleeves as he lifted his head to look him in the eyes.
Steve slid the oversized cutters underneath the thick metal and started to cut with unhindered concentration, it being as gentle as if he'd done this sort of thing on a regular basis. He knew just one quick move would be hell on Tony. It was funny to think after all his years he'd never had to cut a man of a body suit, especially one made of God knows what. But with his strength he drove it where it needed to be. After a few good presses from his overly sized arms it finally split at the object. He and Thor, who had been waiting patiently, worked to pry the shell open just enough to get Tony out.
It was strange seeing him as the son of one of his good friends. Hell he was still having trouble seeing the future as the present. He’s the spitting image; Tony likes to think they’re nothing alike. They do have their own differences and there's no way he could know what he was like in the time he was asleep. There was no way he could’ve known Howard would be consumed by his obsession with finding him.
Tony groaned as one of the men pulled the blanket away although silently he thanked him. He was burning up, "fever" one of the men mentioned before tearing away the sheets. Tony’s side was bleeding again the white cloth stained. A new sense of urgency ran through them as they picked up the pace. Steve could only step back and watched as several men worked around each other with fluid movement. One of them carefully cut away the cloth holding the binding together.
His dizziness lingered alongside the exhaustion frightened him still. The look in his eyes could tell it all, constantly dilating darting in between lucid and awake. He could only pray for rest but he wasn't so sure God would be willing to allow him even that. He allowed his eyes to slide shut, best to not focus on anything in particular.
He made a promise to himself and Yinsen that that would never happen ever again. So long as there was breathe in his body not another weapon manufactured under his name will be used in the name of false justice. He was better than that after all, he was better than his father who built an inexhaustible addition to modern war from the ground up. He could use his mind for the greater good, something over violence. The Iron man was an exception, just a tool to help clean up the mess he made.
The duo walked over to the center of the gravel roof top and sat down next to each other to watch and wait. The beams of light from his thrusters slowly began to blend with the sky as Tony went out to greet the smoke exhausting missile sent by an unknown alias. He seemed like more of a streak of blinding color with a red speck tip. If you didn't know what you were looking for you would simply think of it as a passing jet or something rather than a one person suit. Although after the crazy things that have been happening around here lately, people would begin to think otherwise.
Clint placed a heavy hand on her shoulder but her gaze never faltered; not until he flipped on the lights making the inside instantly brighter. The sudden change stung their eyes slightly but Natasha didn't mind it, she just continued to lather her palms and wrists with soap. Once all the color had seemed to run down the drain she dried them with a clean white dish towel. She looked up at Clint and flashed a smile before setting the towel down and letting out a breath she seemed to of held the entire time.
"Yea I'm ok now. It's just now and then I get so overwhelmed with what I am and this is a totally different environment. It's just so weird that you guys don't resent me for what I can become. Over the years it's caused me nothing but pain and suffering to me and others. I hated myself for a long time now. I've found myself with nothing to look forward too, nothing to live for. I've gone on like that for such a long time so I started helping people those that didn't have the means to help themselves. I'm just not used to all this you know? Everything happened so fast."
The surgeon used biodegradable stitches and with carful precision started threading them threw the ripped sides of his lung, pulling them back together best he could. This would be the longest part but once all the necessary structures were reconnected they could finally close him up. Once the inner parts of his lung were reattached the blood flow slowed down considerably. He then enclosed some of the loose muscle tissue back together and with much thicker stitches he sewed his skin back best he could. IT didn't look horribly bad, the cross stitched line on his abdomen was straight and bound tight. The bruising around had gotten extremely worst once the procedure was near finished. Dark purple was all that was there, it surrounded the fresh scar.
The doctor seemed to dance around that portion of his prognosis. Or perhaps it was just his overactive imagination. More often than not he was his own worst enemy. He hadn’t brought it up but this was the longest he’d remind coherent enough to hold a conversation.
He moaned the image of the car battery wired through a hole in his chest weighing heavily on his subconscious. Absent mindedly he clenched his stitches making the feeling more intense without realizing it. Steve quickly noticed this and how tense Tony became. The heart monitor sped up as did his breathing. He scooped up his hand using his other to pry Tony's arm from his wound. Pained tears escaped their lidded barrier running down Tony’s pale cheek soaking into his shirt collar.
What came out was an even more distorted version of the once known man of iron, now riddled with a PTSD that no one on the Earth could even begin to fathom. The curse of a never ending nightmare that is constantly haunting his sleeping form and slowly working to destroy his waking one with anything he can, alcohol being his main poison. Tony's face slowly became stern and troubled at the thought of it all. It was too much even for someone as ingenious as him to handle.
"Pshaw I know that... I'm indestructible remember?.." The cruel reality of it however was that he was the weakest among them without his armor, the most vulnerable. He tilted his head to the side and spat out a mouthful of blood all over the floor. In a daze turned back towards the others, his jaw covered in a crimson red. He hadn't felt it at first being that alcohol dulls the senses, as well as the burst of adrenaline, but the pain was slowly setting in.
Tony not used to such a pain let out a bloodcurdling scream. One that made all the all the other Avengers cringe. Natasha tried her best to keep the other still bit even the sound of him in pain was even unbearable for even the master assassin who tortured people for a living. Thor held his wriggling body still throughout the calamity to prevent further affliction.
Although every now and again I'll reach a resolve and make it back to the Earth. No recollection, seeming as though it were merely a skip in time. Just with a bang and I'm faced down in the ruble, such a pitiful state for the so called genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. All titles to mask the broken man who carries them. In reality I'm the most fragile one that hides beneath a layer of overconfidence, locked away inside of a shell of metal. Weak.
He took in a shaky breathe before deciding to give an answer. "Just a bunch of stuff I wish I could forget. Old ghosts I guess." It was becoming a far too familiar feeling lately. At first it was simply the time he spent in Afghanistan, being torture and made a slave to build weapons; nothing but a useful commodity who was only good for crafting articles of war. I guess the apple doesn't fall far from the tree in that department.
He picked up one of the scalpels from the metal plate to his side and cut the gash wider and set retractors in place to hold the wound open. His assistant held a little siphoning tube and used it to suck up the blood that was still gushing from his lung. All of a sudden the heart rate monitor began to wail with erratic beeps. This alerted the lot to no prevail. The more experienced ones sprung into action and quickly thought of the best course of action. "He's going into cardiac arrest!" Tony's labored breath became more and more sporadic, though he was still unconscious he was mildly tossing under the stress. Two of the nurses held him down at the shoulders to prevent him from hurting himself anymore.
Tony figured rather than to have a huge monument located in the center of New York with his name plastered on the front if it. It would be put to better use as the head quarters for the newly form team of misfits. Or in his words a playhouse for the super wanna be hero freaks. The world however will soon know them as the Avengers.
His eye lids weighed heavily along with dark circles but he refused to let them fall, however exhausted he may be. He was not looking forward to hellish slumber. "Umm uh Tony? Are you feeling alright? I mean other than you know hole in your side. You know despite my age I tend to pick up things rather quickly. So why is it you don't want to go back to sleep?"
It seems Tony wouldn't be the only one bracing the sleepless night in wait. Steve was spending the majority of the night starring at the ceiling. Perhaps it was because he wasn't used to lying in a bed that was so comfortable it almost hurt. Perhaps it was the fact that he was unable to calm his mind even after settling in a few hours ago.
It happens all over again like a reoccurring dream. Each time I get closer and closer to the dangers. I can almost feel the heat and then nothing. Quiet. This will happen a few times over before I begin to wriggle and sweat. Even after each time I see it I can never get used to it. The only difference is I know when it's coming. I'll never get used to feeling of falling, completely out of control. The nightmares never seem to cease.
Tony looked so peaceful, his face was relaxed and his hair was in a tangled mess. It was getting really late. Bruce had been falling asleep over the past 2 hours; his head would occasionally nod off until he finally gave in. He sat behind the captain in an overly comfortable chair and joined the other in rest. It was almost midnight and after all the commotion I wouldn't blame him for being tired. They would be leaving soon anyways the other are probably worried sick by now.
"It's no problem; I thank you for taking your job seriously. That's my friend back there so it means a lot." He smiled at his honesty, then paused for a second to let what the driver said fully register in his head. After a moment he finally realized just exactly what he said which made him hang his head low out of shame. "Wait, you said don't get mad… That means you know who I am don't you.." He sighed out of shame, he hated who he was and after so long of trying to hide just exactly what he was, all those year of secrecy melted away within a few days.
Thor waited on the roof of the tower just in case there were anymore threats, that he would be ready. He figured it'd be their best chance in case there was another attack. It wasn't like he didn't trust Jarvis or the any of the other modernized technology, it's just he trusted his eyes and ears over machines. Nothing can beat his battle instincts nor his hammer and lighting. He could out due any sort of bomb or missile any mortal would dare throw at him. An Asgardians senses were far more advanced than that of Earthlings.
He opened his eyes again lying on the ceiling fan idly spinning above him. He was still remembering bit from the day prior. With Steve’s help he was sure he could fill the gaps in his memory. He didn’t get a good look at the metal shard while he was bleeding out. His curiosity peaked.
"You underestimate.. How well I can hold my alcohol.." He smirked. He always had a habit of making a joke in bad situations. It made everything feel less tense in a way kind of like a defense mechanism. He attempted to sit up more but it sent a shooting pain that spread through his side and up through his chest. Forcing him to fling his head back and stay still until it would suffice, his eyes squeezed shut. His side throbbed vigorously as he clutched it with the arm that was not attached to an IV and other machines. His head pounded just as bad, an after effect of the drugs mixing with the alcohol already in his system.
The doctor pulled the covers Tony and left the room for the others to say their goodbyes. Steve sat back down in his chair resting his cheek against his fist and Bruce decided to stay standing. The two of them remained silent as they watched Tony sleep. He looked so peaceful even with the oxygen mask was strapped to his face. A faint wheezing could be heard with every inhale he took. Bruce placed a hand on his shoulder and sighed, "I think it's about time we headed back to the tower; I'm sure the others are worried sick."
The way his skin looked made him near sick to his stomach, if it wasn't for his time in the service he probably would have lost his lunch. How Tony was able to hold out the way he did or even be able to force himself to sit up was a mystery to him. It was a long cut at least 20 stitches and a few staples held it together, but that wasn't what alarmed the hardened soldier. It was his skin; the discoloration was something he hadn't seen before. It was made him ache just to look at it. He turned away for a moment while the good doctor rewrapped his side.
The doctor redirected his gaze back towards the slightly shifted and stained bandages that wrapped the man. He looked almost like a mummy at the waist. He pulled out a small pair of surgical scissors and began cutting the cloth away. "My name is Hector sir."
"Hey... If it means anything.. I guess you were right.. My motor skills that is.. They were delayed." Tony redirected his eyes towards Bruce.
"Tony, none of its real it’s OK. But your stress level is rising too high, you’ve gotta calm down.." Steve stood fast shoving his seat back as he stepped up close to Tony. Keeping a firm grip on his wrist he squeezed his shoulder, shaking him lightly. He was too afraid of hurting him anymore.
One well placed, concentrated blast should be all he would need to explode the insignificant threat. He held out his right arm, keeping the other down at his side in order to maintain his stability. Jarvis targeted the missile through the suits system and locked onto its exact coordinates. He held his position and charged of up a fair amount of energy in his palm to blast a hole straight threw a cinder block building with little resistance. He waited until it was nearly in front of his face before he finally shot a bright blue ray in its direction.
Steve was left alone with two snoring team mates and the sudden feeling of restlessness. He glanced around the room before feeling the need to head to his room. He walked around the couch passed a sleeping Banner and noticed the tint of red on the tile. He stepped around it and grabbed his shield that was on the other side. "Steve.. I'm scared.." Those words rung in his ear, he could almost picture himself cradling the blood drenched Tony.
“This shit happens when you declare yourself a target to the entire world.” He remembered doing that shortly after defeating Obadiah. It hasn’t done him any favors. Now this, it’s a harsh reminder of those out there only for themselves. He didn’t regret a thing after all these things remind him of what’s important, the reason why he wears the suit.
"Oh the Incredible Hulk is telling me when I've hit my limit," Tony said jokingly as he began to shake his mixer containing God knows what. The look on the other face however was in distaste. Tony was already hard to deal with sober. Damn near impossible when he's drunk. Whenever he did get that way he had a habit of joking around more than usual. His favorite activity to date as far was poking fun at Banner. Up until he could provoke a reaction out of him. Being he could keep his emotions so well in tact after all. It wasn't such an easy task but it still entertained Tony to try.
"Where..?" His voice was harsh and scratchy and he tried to contain the cough lurking within his throat. But to no prevail, he hacked what seemed like his other good lung in a fit. His entire body pulsed in agony. The flexing core as he coughed only made it feel like he getting stabbed a thousand times over. He managed to cover his face with his palm before he unable to so. He felt something wet seep into his skin.
Steve glanced up to the bags of liquid hanging above him running to the other by way of multiple rubber tubes. The most notable being the dark red bag of blood running into the bend in his arm. He shift his sights back to Tony, he remembered how much blood he lost. It was everywhere, running along the grit of his tile up stairs, on the elevator floor, and all over Steve’s clothes. He still had a bit of blood beneath his nails.
The Black Widow is well aware of her surroundings but tonight she was in a fog. She noticed Steve was being unusually distant since coming back; he didn’t look anyone in the eye. Just as her mind turned to him he passed by, she was sitting in the dark. They just so happen lock eyes with each other. She was cozied up on the couch with a blanket still bright eyed and awake.
He loved to help out it was how he was; he was born with a weak body but a kind heart. It was unfortunate but that never stopped him. He loved his family and stood up for who ever needed it, although there wasn't much he could do that didn't stop him from trying. Bucky was always there too, just as kind hearted. The two of them were like brother even if they were completely different yet they loved each other. When his mother died he was all he had, they looked out for each other. Well more like Bucky watched out for him, no matter how kind Steve was he would still be the one getting into fights.
They all held a matter of respect for Tony. He was truly a hero and an amazing man who didn't deserve to be put in this situation. Who knows how many times he'd avoided death already. He was going to make it through this.
He flexed against his pillow, lolling his head to the side. The medication the doctor had given him was warring off and the vigorous muscle spasms coming from his wound felt like torture. His mind started to associate it with memories of his capture a few years ago.
She looked at herself in the mirror and smirked at the thought of working with this group even longer than she had anticipated. Now that Tony decided to generously donate the tower to the cause; the Avengers initiative. She was going to see a lot more of them in the near future. She was ok with this. She just kind of had the feeling she didn't really belong. After all her and Clint were on a completely different level compared to the rest. But they needed the knowhow as well as the authority. They were after all the most qualified to handle things in hazardous situations.
Once Tony settled a bit Steve released his careful grip on his shoulders and allowed him to settle back into his bed. He exhaled exhausted and sat back in his chair as he watched his friend take in shallow breaths. Before it dawned on him, why was Steve so troubled over him? It didn't make any sense, he hardly knew him. I mean he knew his father sure but he didn't know much about the imperfect son of Howard. So far all Tony has managed to do was help save the city with the lot of them and show his ass and only one of those things was acceptable.
Tony's Arc Reactor shone brightly against the ceiling of dimly lit room. Proof that Tony Stark still had a heart; even after his ordeal it still wasn't done ticking. The machines to his side beeped lightly. He had been out of surgery for an hour or so and the doctors finally decided it would be ok to let his friends in to see him. They'd been waiting for so long to see how he was holding up.
“We’ll find who did this.” Steve was serious, but oddly Tony seemed to accept his fate. He assumed it was the drugs. He didn’t care if they caught the culprit, there will always be someone else to take their place.
“Hey I brought you some stuff.” Steve rummaged through the bag finding his phone beneath some clothes he’d snagged last moment. Tony looked over as he handed it over. Steve set it in his hands and sat back down. Even though Tony was half out of it he had no trouble unlocking it and tapping rhythmically against the glass. Steve hadn’t figured that one out yet. He didn’t want to seem amazed but he kind of was.
"What's the deal with him" she said, allowing herself to let out a small chuckle. "He tired because he ran up a few flights of stairs. It's ok though he was falling asleep in the waiting room anyway. It's probably a good idea we follow his and Clint's example and hit the hay." Steve stood up, stretching out his muscles in his arms before maneuvering around the coffee table. He was about to walk past Natasha but she held out her arm and caught him before he could get past her. He stopped and looked down at her with a puzzled look.
"Someone will be checking on you within the hour. Just get some rest." With that he disappeared through the door.
Steve lightly tapped the rail of the bed to the beat of the heart monitor. It was steady and rhythmic the way it should be; words could not describe the relief modern day machines brought him. They kept his friend breathing and gave him more blood to replace what he'd lost. Things have advanced so much since his time. He smiled as he listened to Tony's light breathing the sound from oxygen tank drowning out his wheezing. Steve could still hear it however, thanks to his heightened senses.
Steve sat there in dark for the better part of 30 minutes after she left, listening to the steady electric beep of the machines surrounding him. His focus on his unconscious team mate lying next to him. His forehead was riddled with sweat and he was much paler than hours ago when he'd last seen him.
'Should I wake him?' Hovering over him he slid a careful hand under his neck steadying him. His eyes were half slitted and dazed, trapped in between sleep and awake.
He even had a partial kitchen in there, the man could spend days locked away in here if he wanted to. Steve shrugged as he found Tony’s dresser, quickly snagging a few concert tees a pair of sweat pants, some socks, and shorts unsure what he would want to wear even if he could change. He thought of anything else he could bring for him when he noticed his bed towards the back. Perhaps there was something over there that he could bring him to better his stay.
"What's your name?" He let out slowly as he was being examined yet again. This man looked up in surprise at the sudden interest in him of all things. Doctors in some instances were meant to be seen and not heard. That is unless when delivering bad news to patents or loved ones. Considering Tony had never liked going from his early checkups he really hated to be in this position. Mostly the bed ridden thing, but he could tell there was an awkward conversation just waiting to be stirred up.
He just happened to be right above one of the many highways that were not so highly traveled. Lucky for him the falling debris wouldn't cause that much of trouble in this location. At least it wasn't above any of the major schools or coffee shops or God forbid anything else of the sort. In fact he couldn't have picked been a better spot even if he'd tried.
"What the striped man says is true. You are an ideal contribution to this team, even if you're just as barbaric as an Asgardian warrior." He finished his sentence by raising his fist in admiration. There were few in the universe that could impress the God of Thunder. Let alone he'd find one of them to be on what he had always thought to of been a little insignificant planet he'd otherwise overlook. There was much here that impressed him not just a giant in a little man.
"But Mr. Stark, This will make the pain easier. You need to rest. I promise you'll feel like a million bucks when you wake up." He insisted but not moving from his spot; waiting for a signal of some kind to reassure him he understood.
Steve absorbed ever word he spoke as though it were scripture. The tone he used was intense and near shattering. He had been threw a lot, way more than Steve could ever imagine. In truth he hadn't been around for the time of the Hulk to know the harm he's caused. But he had an act of reading people and to him it was the man who was worth knowing. Not the history or rumors, most of what he has heard was all one sided and destructive. But with one simple chat with the person who carried the monster within him he could tell there was a deep sorrow that he also carried with him.
"So have you had this job for a long time?" Bruce said timidly wonder whether or not small talk would make him feel better or not. It was bad enough to be worrying over something you didn't have much control over, but worse to be stuck with just your thoughts about it. It was starting to drive him crazier than he already was. At first the driver didn't even acknowledge his question, being preoccupied
His head pounded against the side of his skull blocking out all of the surrounding noise. All he could hear was the muffled footsteps of his teammates as they rushed over to him. The ones who were already at his side were immediately to his aid. Calling out to him in order to find out what was instigating his affliction, but they seemed as only distant echoes to him, too far away to recognize. He started to cough feeling something wet begin to run down his chin. Through his hazy vision he started seeing dark spots forming on the floor in front of him.
It's funny in a way; even after all of this he never would have imagined himself working well with others. That is unless of course he was the leader of the so called team then maybe. But he didn't care about that, if anything he's just happy to be the benefactor of the group. He was just happy to be a part of the team even though in the beginning it seemed more like a chore than a duty. If it meant anything they really did come through in a time of need and it felt great having a common goal for the greater good. And even though they didn't know each other they managed to pull it off and saved lives. If that doesn't call for a drink than I don't know what does.
"You need to relax now Tony and try to get some rest." The man in bed was hardly able to keep his eyes open, his vision fading once again. Steve caught Tony and gently laid him back in his bed, his head heavily sinking into the soft pillows. His breath was slow and shallow and his bandages were a tinged a little redder than he'd originally anticipated. This made Steve a little nervous as he watched the other drift off. "Steve I can't," He barley let out as a whisper before there was a knock at the door.
"Alright Mr. Sour Puss you can be like that if you want, it doesn't hurt me one bit." He said with a snob taking another huge gulp as he walked out from behind the counter and plopped himself on the couch. Natasha swirled her martini and sighed, sharing occasional glances with Bruce from where he sat across from her on the other couch the other blushing before looking away in embarrassment. It was quite an entertaining sight since Thor enjoined the squabbles of normal people. He chuckled and took another swig of the fine aged Asgardian whiskey from a jeweled silver flask.
He leaned in close, studying the others pained face. He felt his forehead with his knuckles and noticed the difference in temperature. Tony leaned into his hand as his breathing became more erratic. He narrowed his brows. His temperature was rising and showing signs of fever.
But now it's gotten way out of hand. There were things out there too big for any of us. I mean they got extremely lucky the first time but that's an understatement. How is anybody supposed to just walk away from what happened that day. Our entire world has been turned upside down and now all kinds of craziness is happening all around. No sane person could walk out of that unaffected. So I guess that sums up where Tony's sanity lies, up there in that hole that opened up over the city.
When he returned, it was originally to retrieve his mettlesome brother and nothing else, but his mission took an unexpected turn. Loki managed things that even he didn't think possible or quite understand. None the less he had his eyes set on Earth for some reason. He wished he knew what was going on with him during the time of his absence. That would be one of his questions he'd ask him in his cell once all this business is cleared up. If anything good happened out of that mess, it'd be the fact that he'd actually managed to make quite a few friends.
As well as make it harder to remove, it was a good thing that Steve used his better judgment and quickly thought to remove the shard rather than leaving it in. With his strength it wasn't much of a problem. If he hadn't Tony probably would have an entire lung full of blood to drown in. But he manages to just skate by with one massive hole rather than the shredded bottom half. They hooked him up to the heart monitor which gave out several quiet beeps as the staff hurriedly prepped for surgery.
"What's her problem?" Tony said a little too loudly. He was always a loud drunk, subconsciously wanting to be the life of the party. In some cases he was but with this lot it seems like no one really wanted to celebrate at the moment. It was a bummer but I guess for some reason there were always things that need to be done, unfinished business as you will. Post battle contemplation just a bunch of stuff. As well as things he just couldn't understand.
Hector collected the used cloth and set everything back in pristine condition for when he left. "So when I looked you over it seems like you popped a few of your stitches. For now I put a bridging tape on that area to keep it held together. If you can promise me that you'll stay in that bed from now on I won't call the staple guy in here until the morning. Save you a little extra discomfort.
She scowled, using her clean hand to turn the faucet on so she could scrub them. She was used to seeing blood after all she was trained to be an assassin, but she could never stand the sight of her friends blood stain her hands. It was sickening; the mere thought of it left a fowl taste in her mouth. She watched the dark red suds slide down the drain as she heard light footstep coming up from behind. Clint walked towards her with a usual serious look plastered on his face though a little softened. He looked at her then down to the sink where her eyes never left. She obliviously knew who was next to her even without the need to look up.
Steve and Bruce entered the dark room. After being in such a horrible state he finally looked peaceful even if he still wasn't flushed with his usual tan color. From his stomach to his chest was bound in thick bandages tinged slightly since first being set. His left arm attached to a blood bag as well as an IV. He was unconscious and hooked up to all sorts of different machines, the duo hated to see him this way. It was pitiful and weak, the complete opposite of what Tony stood for.
"Vibrainium and imbedded within it a homing device. Nat disabled it but it seems you were their target, Tony." He was currently staring up at the ceiling. He suspected as much. It wasn't a surprise, this was normal for him right? Target for missiles were the norm. He’d aggravated numerous crime syndicates before, survived 2 months in the desert. Yeah he'd be fine.
Steve managed a smile even though his eyes haven't changed since leaving the hospital. His usually bright blue eyes remained dark and void of life even when he spoke of retaining hope. It's just at the moment nobody knew what their next move was, except maybe the mystery man who sent the present to their home in the first place.
The only thing he could distinguish throughout the ordeal was those blue marble like eyes staring him down every step of the way daring him to fall asleep. He refused which in turn astonished the super soldier. After all he'd known people whom been hardened by war unable to do what he did, so calm. He'd seen countless others fall the same way Tony almost did.
"I had a feeling but I had to be sure. What is the rarest substance on the planet doing hidden in a missile?" She said out loud placing a hand under her chin out of confusion, although she knew the answer to that question as well. Just not wanting to come to that conclusion just yet, one thing she could never be was clueless. Clint was the same way most of the time.
His sheets were crumpled up blending with the black blanket and tossed over to the side, pillows littered most of the king sized bed. It seemed like it was quite comfortable, way above his standards but considering he was used to sleeping on a military grade cot. Anything else was comfier, Tony’s couch had more cushion than the bed he had back at home before everything.
'I wonder what Steve has to say to me, he looked kind of out of it when I last saw him. There's no telling what's going on with that guy. I don't even wanna know what Banners thinking in that hyperactive mind of his. Hell I'm not even entirely sure what happen. All I know was there was blood, muffled what seemed lots of screaming and the urge to nod off when I was too afraid to. Glad that's over with; maybe they can enlighten me when they come. If they come."
It didn't take long before the cab driver realized just exactly who the other was in the car with him. It was that once gigantic green rage monster of a man sitting in the back of his cab. In a way he was even more honored but more so terrified than anything else. He put his car in gear and they went on their way near pushing the speed limit.
The two exited the hospital looking as though they'd witnessed an execution and resurrection all in the same day. There was a mix of emotion, ranging from anger and relief to a grim sense. Steve seemed to have a permanent scowl fixated on his face ever since they'd left Tony in his room. It was unlike his usual physique, he had always kept up the sense of professionalism and above all leadership. Someone has crossed a line that should never to be trampled and there was a storm coming.
Even though he would never admit it, the jealous prince taught him something very valuable about himself. That selfishness can be the cause for such a disaster. Although Tony was notorious for being a self centered rich boy he had managed to disband most of his foolhardy habits through team work.
"I felt bad for leaving you here alone, even for the night.” Tony scoffed inwardly ‘oh wonderboy how noble of you.’
Steve's expression tightened when he knelt down to pick up the broken man. As he worked his hand behind his neck he felt how cold he had gotten. His skin was like ice and extremely pale compared to his usual tan complexion, he'd lost so much blood it was no wonder. He knew he had to hurry if there was any chance of saving him. He worked his other arm under his legs and gently hoisted him up. He leant his head up against his shoulder, him nuzzling just in the crook of Steve's neck. Tony seeming to swoon as Steve cradled him in his arms. Steve was so gentle every move he made was so subtle and well calculated. He could run all the way down the stairs right now and never disturb him, but he refused to take the chance.
"Well aren't you going to ask for my name?" He suddenly said breaking the silence. The other look slightly confused, like it was a question that really didn't need to be asked. Everyone knew who Tony Stark was. It would have been asinine if he hadn't.
"Tony's suit is made of the strongest combination of metallic substances on Earth other than Vibranium. And that one shard cut threw like it was nothing but a piece of card stock. They knew that he would be the one to take care of the missile; he's done so many countless other times. They even calculated the force needed to drive a stake threw him. He was a threat and it would be in their best intentions to get rid of him." Clint said as he crossed his arms together and plopped on the couch. It pained him to admit it but they were in trouble without Tony, after all without him there would have been no way they would have lasted as long as they did against those aliens. At that moment Thor walked in threw the outer doors, drawing no attention to him from the others who were obliviously troubled.
"Bruce is fine thanks," he replied with a chuckle. It was nice to be thanked for once rather than blamed. It made him feel good about himself. Saving lives and being able to have a conversation with one of the survivors. Made him feel a kind of warmth deep down, a way better feeling than the fiery burning sensation of anger, he liked praise. "If you want to thank anyone for that feat you'd have to talk with him," he said throwing his thumb up behind him. "He's a true Hero. He distracted that abomination long enough for me to; as you say pummel it into the ground."
But she was actually happy here. That mission to collect the big guy and rally up a team of misfits was the best thing she could of done. Spending most her time as a solo miracle informant was what she thought was her expertise. Who knew she'd work so well with a team of untrained, unqualified, undignified bunch of outsider. But in introspect she has glad things turned out the way they did.
There were moments where he'd reminded him of his friend from ages ago. He'd known him for less than two weeks but it feels like years. He was the closest thing that reminded him of one of his dearest friends. It just wasn't fair, not after everything we've been through. He shouldn't have to be suffering. Steve bit his bottom lip a surge of helplessness flowing through him.
"It's not always about being right. Besides no one could of guessed that something like this would be inside that thing. I watched you the whole time and you did everything right. We just should have taken the situation a lot more seriously even if we knew how to handle it. But you're not the one to blame." In a way he knew something like this would happened but he could have never of expected this.
"Although we haven't known each other very long you're still my friend. We protect our own and I wasn't just about to let you bleed out and die on your own floor. I know you're strong and well able to handle yourself; you've done it way before knowing any of us. But we're a team and we do care for you. We're friends now Tony, whether you like it not I'm going to have your back."
It was eerily silent which in itself made it uncomfortable to enter. It felt like there was a weight that hung in the air above them, something near ghostly that held their soul in its grasp. They shifted the uneasiness along with the open doors. The team was the only ones occupying the tower today. Tony being a generous boss gave his staff a celebratory day off, which in turn became more of a week but it didn't really matter. The tower was pretty much under reconstruction as well as repurposing.
Tony was in and out of surgery quite fast even though it was a 5 and a half hour operation. For the people working on him it seemed as those they didn't have enough time. But for the two waiting outside as well as the one waiting at the tower, time moved even slower than it should have. They were just glad that they'd gotten him help in time. He could have bled out all over his comrades and the floor of his facility or drowned in a lung full of blood in the arms of his friend while the others watched. Nothing they could possibly do about it. It'd be best to forget all of that happening and look toward the future.
“Yea something like that.” He started walking again slowing when he realized he should let someone know where he’s disappearing to. “Actually, I’m going back to see him.” Steve spoke in a quite somber voice. “Something wasn’t right when we left; the doctor was amazed he’d woken up from the aesthesia as quick as he did. It didn’t seem right he seemed scared. He insisted against going back to sleep. I’m worried about him.”
He shuffled back over to his bed, careful not to bump into anything. He stuck a hand out to feel the soft silk sheets and allowed himself to embrace them face first. He buried his face in his pillow feeling the cold cloth from not being unused all day. It relaxed his tensed body. He could feel his body urging him to sleep, yet his mind continued to run a mile a minute. Constantly thinking about his friend, whether he was alright or not, if he was still breathing or if the worst had already happened and he wasn't there. Honestly he could understand how the others were able to fall asleep like they did. He cracked his eyelids open to look that the clock, it read 3:28 am, which meant he only had to lie there for 4 more hours and 32 minutes until he could see his friend again. Hopeful he would be in better shape than when he left him.
"Absolutely Ms. Romanoff, the specimen should take about 10 minutes to fully examine." She nodded stepping away from the table as the machine was making little beeping noises and going back and forth with the little blue grid. She stared down at her hands and clenched them tight and releasing her grip to get a good feel for the substance covering her usually supple hands. They were wet and sticky being coated in thick, slowly clotting blood. She walked over to the sink and held her hand up in the light; it shined in the light and felt like it was an ironic kind of sick joke. The substance that retained life could look so beautiful under the right conditions.
"Tony maybe it would be a good idea to slow down a bit. I mean just take a break and relax for a while" Bruce was referring to the drink he was in the process of making, which in this case would be his fifth one. Even if he was a rich boy with a high tolerance for alcohol it would still be in his best interest to let up a little. After all drinking yourself into oblivion was not always the best way to party.
"We're going to need a bag of A positive to replace what he has lost. Come on people hustle don't forget why we're all here, we have to work our best to save this man. It's the least we can do after what he did for all of us." Some of the staff hung their heads a little lower, unsure whether or not they could save him or not, but being reminded of their duty they somehow found a burst of inspiration and purpose. Each of them carried out their tasked to the fullest of their capabilities.
His head pounded and his body was hot and burning against the sheets. His body jolted when he felt a strangers hand touch him, he quickly realized where he was and he couldn't decide whether the nightmare was actually over. However he would allow them to stick him with whatever needle they so desired, anything to kill the pain.
He blinked once again to see if the time would change any quicker but it didn't. At this point he had two choices. One he could go back to sleep and let the sun or staff wake him up, even worse his subconscious. Or lie awake and wait till morning. Right option two it is. He let his head weight back into the pillow and stared up at the ceiling. The reactor in his chest a constant night light, yet it did no justice in scaring away the monsters. He sighed figuring it would be better to get his mind off the subject and distract himself.
"Let's take the stairs Steve," Bruce said already walking in that direction. Steve finally let his hand drop back down to his side and followed the other without uttering a word. Everything happened so fast it was like none of it was actually real. That there wasn't blood spread out in every direction behind them. That one of their friends was fighting for his life even when he gave them the impression that he was perfectly fine.
They cut away the temporary bandage that had been completely soaked threw by now. Once it was removed little streams worked their way down his side, meeting the surface of the operating table. One of the nurses wipe the area around with a cloth dampened with disinfectant. The main surgeon came over to assess the damage so far, his other colleagues swarming around behind him placing all sorts of instruments around his station. He picked out a blunt hook and stuck it in the gash to get a better look inside; he tenderly pulled some of the torn flesh to the side and used a little flash light to get a better idea of the condition of his internal organs that were exposed.
After some time a doctor entered the room. The heart monitor sent an alert to his station that his patient was in distress, which he clearly was. Tony was hunched over the side of the bed bordering about passing out or puke. His oxygen mask was removed and dangling down at his side. The only thing still filling his lungs was the thin tubing fixed in his nose.
Dr. Helshier gave him a quick look over and could tell he was in a great deal of pain, completely riddled in sweat and pale as he was. He was surprised he hadn't passed back out yet. But Tony was as stubborn as they come. Helshier knew that from his yearly checkups which he despised so much. Plus everyone knew what kind of man he was, with the big ego and the type whose face the camera loved and who didn't mind giving an audience just exactly what they wanted. He uncapped a syringe of heavy sedatives and injected it into the IV.
Young Hector finished patching up the soiled wrapping and just sat back examining the man in his care. Tony thought for a moment wondering whether or not he should answer the man at his side. He really didn't want to go into it. If it was possible he wished the feeling would have died along with the Chitauri. Never to be brought up again. Doesn't seem like that would be an option in this case, however this didn't mean he had to share every detail if any at all.
At least they didn't have to spend much time calming the man bleeding out on the tile. Being as drunk as he was somehow kept him in high enough spirits to realize the extent of what happened. Not to mention the amount of adrenaline that was pumping threw him to keep him from noticing how bad he'd been injured. One moment he rocketed up in the sky. The next blowing up a simple missile he spent most of his life manufacturing. Safely landing in hopes of chatting and carrying on with his friends and then to just end up laying belly up with a thick shard of metal sticking out of him.
He vaguely remembered it after a moment he produced another bottle. Tony visibly perked up. “How many” Steve asked casually. “Just one” it would be just enough to take the edge off, clear his mind. Maybe he could get some rest before Pepper came in a few hours.
Tony never cared much for his father. He loved him he really did but he was always too busy to pay attention to him when he was growing up. He couldn't really blame him though; I mean he did have one of the biggest companies in the United States to run after all. When he was around Howard the thing he talked about was either ways to improve the business or about his past working with the famed Captain America. For the longest time Tony idolized his, how couldn't he? He was a hero that ended the world war.
She stood from her seat without a single word and set her drink down on the end table, turned and walked off towards the bathroom. Just because she wasn't a loud to show emotion didn't mean it wasn't there, hiding just underneath the surface. It was her strength, even if she was told it was to be a weakness. It gave her a reason to continue doing what she did best to escape the past and work towards something worth it, for herself and no one else.
Steve and Bruce each took one of his arms and wrapped it around their shoulder, gently hoisting Tony to his feet. The duo walked the man all the way inside and set him down carefully on the tile, leaning him up against the wall until they could figure out what was the cause of his discomfort. "What is wrong with the man of Iron?! Did he not destroy the explosive heading this way!?" Thor burst into the quarrel utterly concerned and confused, looking at the countries captain and the not so green man for answers.
"I figured as much. I may be slightly stooped but I'm not incapable of functioning." Tony said snidely in satisfaction as the remaining pieces of his suit were placed and locked together. His helmet being the last to be attached, he made it to were the face plate remained up so they could still look him in the eye when they talked. He shifted slightly under the metal shell before walking over and opened up the glass panels between the room and the balcony with a little remote. He rushed outside and took a quick look around to see if he could spot the missile in the direction Jarvis calculated, Steve and Bruce not far behind him.
They were greeted by an unwelcomed trail of blood. It seemed to stain the areas where it wasn't so thick and remain pooling in other spots and running along the seams in the tile. How Tony was even able to remain conscious let only alive was a mystery. Their eyes stayed glued to the liquid, making extra careful to avoid it as they entered. Like somehow stepping in it was some sort of taboo.
Tony was probably the only person that would never make a mistake on the job even while intoxicated. He was just that brilliant sometimes even if didn't have very much self control and the remainder of the time he acted like a self loathing jackass. The others had to admit after that day the Earth was attacked he'd strive to make a bit of a change. Even if it was a small change he would eventually catch on. They could only hope so.
"Fine then good job paper weight." He shot back at the man, who was obviously not expecting a retort. He was always led to believe that the Captain wasn't capable of joking around and having a good time. He had to be serious being the leader and a hard ass all the time. But he had to give the man some props, that was a good comeback.
"Anesthesia" The surgeon shouted over his team as he pulled a pair of latex gloves over his hands. Numerous people were zipping around the room, some of them were prepping Tony for the surgery itself and others were setting up their stations. One of the nurses hustled over with a breathing mask that would replace the little squeeze one they'd used when bringing him in. Another young nurse rushed over to cleaned his arm and set up an IV. A meticulous syringe held delicately between her lips as she finished placing the needle in his vain. She pulled out a piece of tape to hold it in place and removed the syringe from her mouth and injected it into the porous tubing.
"Not again," Steve said silently to himself. "I can't lose anyone else." He continued to pace back and forth; the lobby couldn't have been anymore baron, just the two of them and the receptionist until they were moved to a more private waiting room that was meant for families. It was just him and Bruce waited for any word regarding Tony's condition other than the ones waiting at the tower, they were alone. Bruce remained quiet, only an occasional sigh escaped threw his fingers. He sat hunched over in his chair, his face nuzzled in his hands, deep in thought. He never really vented his feelings to anyone instead he'd rather contemplate quietly to himself.
It'd been a long stressing day for all of them, which was ironic since today was initially meant to be a day of relaxation, giving them a chance to unwind a little. Everything was normal without any worries, everyone was just starting to get to know one another and yet someone had to go and crash the party.
After the battle, Thor took his troublesome brother Loki home to Asgard to be tried for his crimes in attempting to take over the Earth. The Allfather was not proud in the least bit though Loki could honestly care less. He was the god of mischief after all. It was his pleasure to cause trouble. Even if it was just to destroy or enslave another world. It wasn't a mystery as to why since he couldn't rule over his own. Or what he at least thought was his own.
He shuttered when Steve lifted his neck to readjust him and the difference in temperature lulled him out of his trance. Finally he was aware someone else was there with him and he was slowing coming out of it. Just when it seemed he was finally coming out of it several doctors came through the door swarming him as he struggled to get out of their way.
His last comment struck something in Tony and caused him to soften his expression. In a way he sensed how much that comment hurt the supposedly impervious super soldier. The only two people in his life that he showed real emotion towards. That truly cared for him and not afraid to show it was his best friend Pepper and Jarvis who was nothing more than a computer now. I suppose Rhodey could be thrown in that equation as well but their friendship was a little different than the one he had with Pepper. To Tony she was always there since the beginning, she was like the sister he never had who always nagged him about doing something stupid and occasionally scolding him for embarrassing her.
"From the information that Jarvis collected it appears it'll hit the tower within 15 minutes or so. That is unless we can destroy it before it demolishes the tower. It's still pretty far away and it shouldn't take much to destroy it before it can get any closer. Lucky for us Jarvis spotted it before it got too close for comfort." Tony said, slurring his words just a tad but still adequately informing the all too eager super soldier.
After learning more about his past he was antsy to return to his side. He exhaled deeply wondered how he’d look when he returns. Just as he was off again Natasha remembers something he might want to hear.
The surgery would be time consuming to say the least. Since the shard hit him with such force, making it able to pierce his armor as well as bend it inward. It tore right threw his left side; it missed his stomach and angled its way up into his chest cavity. The area around the wound was slowly bruising and turning into a dark sickly purple. Sadly the aid of his arc reactor in his chest the magnetism assisted in drawing the metal fragment further and further into his lung and closer to his heart at the same time.
Steve and Natasha looked up at the blond with raised eyebrows, Tony only laughing at the far end of them. Clint shared in on the chuckle; Bruce just shook his head then looked at his glass of water. He could see his reflection on the liquid. Every time he'd move it'd ripple slightly, distorting the image.
She smiled shyly; in the end the only thing they could do at this point was remain optimistic. Worrying is like praying for something you don't want to happen. It was getting dark outside and they have yet to hear any word from the others. Thor remained on the roof as a look out and all was quiet, considering how late it's gotten already it doesn't seem like there would be any more surprises tonight. He'd probably be coming inside in a little bit pretty soon. After a little bit the computer maybe a loud electronic buzz to notify that the analysis was complete.
His answer relieved more than just Steve, the driver seemed to be holding his breath ever since laying eyes on the Hulk and seemed to gasp for more as he turned the corner. Banner's words seemed to reassure both of them for the time being, his duller eyes being the proof of that. It wouldn't take much longer before they got back.
"Wait before we call it a night I have to tell you something." Natasha all of a sudden said real serious. Steve nodded and sat back down next to her. "You saw how Tony's armor had been pierced right? It was almost like it was tinfoil or something. It nearly went right through him if it wasn't as thick as it was." Steve held a look similar to the one on her face, of course he could tell. He was taught to be perceptive during a time of urgency, although he really didn't want to be reminded of that at the moment. If anything he wanted to replace that image with a better one, hopefully the sight of the usual over confident and prideful Stark he first met. Even if he was annoying, that was better than the broken one he'd witnessed earlier that evening.
Tony's eyes were wide and seemed permanently fixated on the ceiling. Natasha continued to hold his head but his sight never appeared to shift; almost like he was having an inward struggle with in consciousness at the moment. The blood engulfed the small area once there was no longer anything stopping the flow.
Tony smiled at the man. He had to of been no more than 22 from the looks of him. He seemed like a kind hearted person and smart to of been a doctor at his age. Then again by the time he was his age he was building turn of the century warheads, but impressive none the least. He could feel the cold steal scissors as the glided above his bruised skin. He was still debating whether or not it felt relaxing or the polar opposite. The touch nearly made him want to shift under it. He alleged to ignore it.
He tried so many times to impress his father but it didn't make much of a difference. He could have created the cure for cancer, but unless it had a way of finding his Capitan America hidden in ice it was not interesting. He gave up after awhile and learned it was better just to do things for yourself rather than someone who didn't appreciate you. All he gained from his father was the company and his inherited genus. Unfortunately some of his old habits as well, that's what put him in this situation, his uncontrollable ego and need to drown his troubles in alcohol. The thought of all that was starting to make him depressed. He figured it was about time to answer the man hovering over him.
Bruce didn't say a single word the entire car ride. The driver even more quiet, which he didn't think was possible. The man must have been in his mid-forty's. He had a thick mustache and glasses as well as the stern expression he held. It there was a text book definition for led foot then this would have been the perfect example. This man wasted no time getting where he needed to be, that was good. Bruce watched the road mostly, having occasional spasms as if to be hitting the imaginary brake on the passenger's side. Especially when it came time to run the red lights, that was the scariest part mainly because the traffic in New York was already terrible.
Bruce chuckled somehow feeling a little better than he did. Probably because he had hardy known any of these people for more than a week and they were comfortable around him. He never thought that there would be anybody who would accept him, being a freak and all. He liked the feeling of acceptance. It had been so long since he felt like he actually had a purpose. Or even at home, like he had friends that were more like a family to him. That cared. "Thanks guys. I needed that."
Steve looked at the scientist confusion plaguing his facial features. "Bruce.. There's no sensing in beating yourself up over this, none of this is your fault or anybody else's for that matter. Only that bastard who sent the missile is to blame. I feel like shit too but the bright side is that even if Tony got hit and is lying in a hospital bed as bad as he looks right now we can say he's alive and still willing to fight. So I say why shouldn't we? He stopped that missile and maybe it was intended for him but regardless he stopped it before it hit us. It sucks I know but there's not much we can do at the moment but pray."
Just when she stops worrying she gets news from home that he’s in the hospital. She told Natasha that she would be back in New York early in the morning that she would ride over soon as she lands.
"Feels like Bruce got angry and wailed on me.. Head hurts.." He said with what little breath he had, straining every few syllables. "But it's ok.." With those last words he slowly started drifting, his body was steadily getting heavier and he was slipping. Steve felt the shift in weight on his shoulder and knew Tony needed to lie back down and rest. He should have stayed there to begin with but it couldn't be helped. He wasn't ok but he was too innocent to know any better. Surly he hadn't gone through anything quite as serious as this. Even if you counted his unfortunate stay in Afghanistan, this was not to be taken lightly.
After all of the craziness that went down it was a wonder the city was even still standing. In retrospect it was in better shape than if it was nuked off of the face of the planet. Sure some buildings were demolished, the streets were torn apart but the city was safe at last. Other than the Chitauri body's that remained as well as a few huge space lizards. The newly formed Avengers could count this as their first ever official victory as a team.
The thought of that little pipsqueak getting the best of them almost brought his blood to a boil. He was never afraid of him. He was just another bully trying to pick on an innocent bystander. People like that needed to be put in their place.
He shouldn't be worried. With the advances of this generation, medical care should be one less thing he had to worry about. But he felt guilty for not being there. He should be along by his side just in case. Steve furrowed his brows in deep thought it seemed pointless passing wasted hours his eyes darting around the room.
He wasn't all that bad, he's really has improved since he went off the grid not that long ago, him being the only one who truly knew what happened while in Afghanistan. There's no telling what kind of horrors he endured out there. That thing in his chest was a mystery in itself. He never really liked to talk about that either, anytime he was asked about it he would trail off into some kind of overly complicated technical lingo that even Natasha couldn't keep from boring her.
"Umm it's an honor to have a hero of the city take a ride in my cab." The man could barely contain himself, usually when Steve was recognized he would have been a bit coyer. Most of the time he'd blush but something told him this wasn't the right time to be flabbergasted so he nodded in acknowledgment.
I'm surrounded by total darkness I can feel it I don't even need to see it, nothing but the cold, quiet void of empty space. My hands begin to shake. I've never been this far from my comfort zone I don't know what to do. I have a pretty good idea what's around me. I chose to be oblivious rather than its counter; after all it's a better state than panic. I feel nothing just weightlessness and the absence of oxygen in my lungs as I continue to drift.
His heart began to race yet again as his eyes widened at the sight. Blood ran from his palm down the length of his wrist. He couldn't help but think the worst. That maybe his dream was a warning of his imitate demise. He needed to know where the others were. He needed to see them.
He allowed his head to sink into the pillow his body finally releasing the tension. He let out a shaky exhale as his eyes fixated on the ceiling. His breath evened. It was calm and quite when familiar face finally stepped out of the corner.
Steve looked near shattered they'd waited so long that they didn't what had happened. He let out a timid "yes" and moved to the side allowing the man to walk in. He was nervous and in between whether or not he wanted to know what happened or not, but he had to know the suspense was killing him. "What's the news doctor?" Bruce said from behind Steve, the time was beginning to take a toll on him but he was very much aware. Especially since Steve had paced back and forth for a whole 5 hours.
"Blood loss will do that to you." Steve recanted, still picking the dried blood from under his finger nails. Tony chuckled but it hurt too much to let out a genuine laugh. He set his hand over his side where they’d tightened his stitches.
In the drawer there were a couple family pictures, not many however. There was a couple with family, his parents’ together young, a half dozen of him as a child and his mother, Jarvis whom the Al is based. Several news clippings of personal and technical achievements, business, some of flattering pictures of Pepper he wish he hadn’t come across. He quickly shifted them away out of respect for the both of them. He already felt guilt for snooping that was until he stumbled across some really dark blurry picture of what looked like a hostage. Strange it seemed to go with an assortment of files.
As he stepped out onto the patio and couldn't help but glance down at the ground. Little puddles of blood contrasted against the dark gray surface. He knelt down and touched one of the pools, it was cold and partially dried this was expected since blood didn't stay liquefied long after being exposed to the oxygen in the air.
He had plenty practice concealing his presence on missions, it would be nothing to slip out of a building he'd become accustomed to. He threw together a gym bag with some clothes when he had the idea to bring Tony some fresh clothes and things as well. His room was on the floor below his. He slipped out allowing his door to slowly shut behind him as he made his way down the stairs.
It's funny, his whole life he'd been looked up to as the son of the king and one of the strongest. All of his friends were fighters like him, but it felt a little bland at times with them. The same old thing every day, an all out brawl followed by an over the top feast. He wasn't saying he was sick of his long times friends, it's just it's nice to meet new people, some of which who were so diverse and interesting. This was the place he'd met Jane after all, the most wonderful women he had laid eyes on. She was so beautiful and intelligent, not a very common combination in Asgard. In his eyes she was perfect, not a care in the world and so innocent. He would have never imagined himself falling for a woman with absolutely no battle experience who would never harm a fly.
He thought it best to leave her alone. After working with her a few times before the actual Avengers got together he learned it was never a good thing to be on her bad side. He was a person that learned from trial and error but she was one he didn't want to test. Almost like a chemical experiment that had to be taken cautiously or else it could potentially be hazardous and life threatening.
Tony was in and out before Steve even arrived. By the time he'd made it and up to his room Tony nodded off again. Lulled by the cool air against his feverish skin and with the boost in pain meds he was feeling pretty good right about then. Although the fear lingered in the back of his mind, he couldn't help mending with the bedding. His eyes rolled back as his breathing calmed and evened with the aided oxygen.
Steve was glad and felt like he could relax a little knowing now that Tony was in good hands. His expression calmed and he exhaled a breath that he seemed to be holding all the way on top floor. Along with the morphine the paramedics also injected him with something that would slow the bleeding just enough to effectively wrap his wound. The two trained medics worked to disinfect the area around the gash; Steve didn't realize just how gruesome it looked until he got a good look at it. He could almost hurl at the sight of it which he couldn't understand. He watched people die in front of him, seen others have a limb blown off, but he couldn't watch as modern medicine worked its miracles. Steve couldn't help his face from scrunching at the thought of his comrades from way back when.
He thumbed his shield before pushing the image to the back of his head. He turned on his heel and headed for the hallway, dimming the lights on his way out. The tower has never been this silent, whether it was Thor carrying on with some story from another world or Jarvis giving constant updates on a certain project. Even when Bruce and Tony go into a heated argument over some kind of scientific mumbo jumbo he did quite understand. Any sort of noise felt more comforting than bitter silence.
But after awhile he began to envy the super soldier, he was always the center of his dad's attention, even though he was gone forever at that point in time. He still spent all his time searching for anyway to locate him. He didn't understand why he did that, there was more to life then living in the past. Jarvis was more of a father figure to him growing up than is actual dad. He just wished his real father cared more than just for his grades in school and spent some quality time with him. Anything was better than him being locked up for hours at a time working on something and hung over the next morning.
"We're going to find who did this, no matter what." Steve said in a vengeful tone as they walked up to the curb he held out a hand and hailed a cab that would take them back home. After all they needed to let everyone in on the good news. One of the many yellow cabs in the city pulled up alongside the sidewalk close to the pair.
He didn’t really have any family pictures other than the one’s he’d seen tucked away. Let there be some handmade frame he'd made as a child with a picture of him and his father. He didn't have many of his parents as it seemed Howard was slowly slipping away, missing from the picture. Tony's smile also seemed to melt throughout the years until he’s carrying around this fake one. He knew how it felt to feel you’ve lost touch, as your emotions nullify. It comes with experience.
He wasn't so used to being accepted the way he was here or having people who actually understand where he was coming from. Everyone was here for a reason; they all had their own experiences that set them apart. So it was nice to have a place where he could actually fit in. Now that his consciousness was somewhat clearer than it had been he was able to feel that he actual held a place in this world.
The doctor injected the now clearer liquid into the split in the IV. Small swirls sprawled out every which way. It looked almost surreal as it began to flow in one single direction, eventually leading into his veins and blood stream. He then took a cloth with antiseptic and wiped the red away from his still clenched jaw.
The room was once again encompassed in silence. Tony felt like he was floating, they'd doped him up best they could before clearing out of here. At the moment he was mildly content just dealing with the dull lingering pain, still it was manageable. They’d taken the liberty of upping the dosage of pain killers along with a time release button to supply them when he needed it. What was shocking was Tony was never a substance person. He never cared for them, didn't really need them until after Afghanistan.
Natasha knelt down behind him, taking his head it into her arms and gently stroking his hair rhythmically in order to calm his nerves. She always been gentle even though she'd come across tougher than nails and then some. The same woman who wouldn't hesitate to snap an arm in order to get what she wanted. Not many people had seen the caring side of her. Especially not Tony unfortunately he wasn't over thinking that little detail much at the moment.
Steve stood up for a moment and yawned as he walked towards the window, careful not to disturb either one of his friends. The moon was so beautiful it shined so brightly threw the glass panels and against the tile. New York has come so far since he last saw it; the buildings doubled in size and seemed to cover as much square foot as possible. Everything was so compacted and full of life, such an odd pair. The moon was as bright as the sun tonight, just like the city that never sleeps.
"Hey lighten up a bit Bruce I'm messing with you. Is it so wrong to live a little? After all the crazy things that went on yesterday it's nice just to have a little time to relax you know? And I promise you I won't drink myself to a new liver. That is if it makes you feel any better." He finished his sentence by placing a fresh paper umbrella in a new colorful drink.
"What was that thing?" Steve knew what he was implying. There weren't many things Tony's suits were vulnerable to. Things like this didn’t happen by coincidence. He knew well enough someone had planted it.
Our last means of hope were sent from the government which originally was meant to obliterate us all and our home. With quick thinking I threw it right where it needed to be. Up at the mother ship and hoped for the best.
At 3 am a nurse comes in to check Tony's vitals. She was a young blonde with hair pulled back in a messy bun from the circles under her eyes it was obvious she. She seemed surprised to see Steve sitting there in the dark since he had been there during her last check and he didn't make a sound when she entered. Only when she stepped up close did he make himself known, nodding as he slid back and out of her way.
Steve remained timid and distant as the woman tended to Tony's vitals and distributed various medicines through strange tubes connected to his arm. He did seem to tensen less as the drugs entered his system his body didn't have to work so hard. Keep his body focused on healing and not on the pain.
Tony couldn't remember much of what happened after that. He figured he'd recollect the events of the evening seeing no better ways to spend the night. It was a mystery how he was able to make it through something so physically traumatic. Although the events of Afghanistan and arc reactor will remain one of the worst experiences of his life, but this was a definite second.
In the end you live your life only the memories remained of your past, which is getting harder to hold onto and even harder to let go. He didn't want Tony to end up as another blood stain on his memory.
It was near impossible to fall asleep not knowing what might happen. Steve wasn't much of a patient man when it came to another well being, he always wanted to be there just in case. He'd always been that way, the kind of overseer of his peers. He starred at the shadowed ceiling, his mind racing with what if's. He hated to be pessimistic but sometimes he just couldn't help it. In a way being overly optimistic isn't realistic; after all you always have to be prepared for the worst even if you remain hopeful.
They already had one in an extreme state they didn't need more. He held the dish towel over the entry wound but it was quickly soaking threw. He made sure to apply steady pressure but not to hurt the injured man with his extra super human strength, which would only cause more harm than good. He ripped a strip of fabric from the bottom of his shirt and bound the cloth tightly around his waist.
Tony was silent. He didn't feel like arguing although he was usually one to instigate it. He promised himself he’d get better at that. Still it was nice to have somebody here with him. He closed his eyes, feeling the cool air kiss his feverish skin.
Tony’s eyelids were shut tight still just beneath his eyes darted every which way. There was something his subconscious was forcing him to relieve and he could tell it was something heavy. Tony was now clenching the sheets with right hand with left clinging around him in visible pain.
Hector could tell that the question was a little much for his patient to deal with at the moment and he had a pretty good idea why. He couldn't even begin to imagine what kind of stuff he's been through and now this. Whatever was eating at him must have taken quite a huge chunk. "Better clean up this mess. Surly you don't want your friends to worry anymore than they already have over something like this."
"I went from constant depression and attempted suicide to helping to heal the sick. It was a simple pleasure but it kept me from hating myself more than I already did. Then all of a sudden Natasha was sent to find me of all people to recruit into the Avengers. But not for the muscle but for the brain, for the person I was and not the thing I became, she wanted the scientist but not the monster. I'd have to admit however the other guy really came in handy toward the end."
"He's awake.." Steve gasped as he rushed to the man's side. Barely able to contain his concern, he had waited hours for any change on his condition but not expecting much, especially not for him to be awake already. Hell he was just glad that he didn't slip into a coma or something. So that was another relief. He pulled his chair closer to Tony's bed and sat down and took his hand. He grunted once more unintentionally scrunched his eyelids in blatant discomfort before he lightly fluttered them open. He looked so weak as if one touch from Steve would make him cave in.
They moved Tony to a private room after they ran whatever tests they wanted. They deducted that in addition to the lung he had 3 broken ribs, another 4 cracked on both sides and a few cracked vertebra. It was like he got punched by the Hulk himself and hit the wall behind him. He laid in what seemed to be a very comfortable bed with the covers pulled up to his chest his arms on the outside of it. The room was fairly decent sized and recently refurbished, the décor was nice and he had a window. By this time the sun had completely gone down and the moon was at its highest.
Steve continued before feeling the need to look away from the injured man and stare at the floor, noticing the all too familiar white tile. He set his elbows on his knees and buried his face in his palms. At a loss until a few more timid words escaped his lips whether or not they would fall on deaf ears. "I've lost a lot of friends Tony.. I don't what to lose you too.."
He swore on that day he would never sell another weapon used to hurt people ever again. The light installed in his ribcage was a constant reminder of that one fact, as well as the shrapnel from his own weaponry. Weapons that were designed to help protect the people of his country, and yet their pieces will be forever imbedded in his body as a punishment for his eagerness. What made matters worse was that fact that his company sold to whoever was willing to buy. Especially those who threatened the vary security of the nation. Terrorists who kidnapped and held him at ransom just to ensure they got exactly what they wanted. It was hard being held up in a cave with only a car battery and his whit's to liberate himself. Never again. Not now not ever.
He dashed for the elevator not taking a chance in waiting for the paramedics to come all the way up to the first floor with a stretcher. They were trained professionals he knew that, but time was of the essence and even if they knew whose life was at stake they still took too long. The only thing that truly mattered at the moment was that the ambulance was here waiting down stairs. The rest was irrelevant, just as long as he could get him medical help, all would be well... He could only hope.
"Thanks captain obvious." Clint said while walking over to join the others as he placed a hand to his side as he watched Tony configure to screen, beer still in hand. Even though he was trained to be calm in extreme situations, he still seemed a bit more lax than he should have been; this was after all an emergency. Probably because of all the critical missions he'd been involved in as well as being utterly out matched during the attack on Manhattan. Someone else could take care of it for once, they were qualified enough, plus it was his day off anyway.
Tony had a tendency to brush off any sort of uneasiness, especially health wise. He hated doctors. Anyways he just figured he must have been hungry or something, I mean when in doubt food is the answer. After all, blowing up missiles and saving the day once again could work up quite an appetite.
The thought of his friends came flooding into his half asleep mind. 'I wonder if they'll show up in the morning. Hell they're probably glad to get me out of their hair for the night, if not longer.' He couldn't help but be pessimistic, it was in his nature. "I guess I'll just have to wait and see what tomorrow will bring. Well technically speaking today but whatever."
That and the fact that Tony's body was processing slower than usual helped to dull the feeling of pain, along with the adrenaline flowing through him. He suffered much less at the time, which was a good thing. Now all that was left was the tedious recovery process. Once they'd removed the fragment he was rushed to the hospital for immediate surgery. It could best be described as sewing up a ripped open teddy bear, except with not much stuffing to work with. With the continuous blood flowing out of an almost lifeless body, they had to work fast and extremely critically.
"Oh sorry, don't get mad or anything I'm not trying to be mean by ignoring you. I just need to concentrate so I make sure I don't miss a turn or hit some idiot who's not paying attention. When you're speeding through traffic you got to have good judgment." The driver said with a slight smile as he turned the corner, his eyes never leaving the road. His voice was deeper than expected, he was pretty skinny and his voice didn't really match his physic. At least he gave Bruce the courtesy of being polite and actually answering him.
Tony looked so defeated. His eyes fixated out the window as they stuck him over again with the needle tugging his flesh tight again. Within minutes his wound was resealed, it was clotting so at least the bleeding has stopped. With assistance they rebound his incision tight with clean bandages. Carefully they rolled him back onto his back his brows taught in discomfort but still managing.
He forced his eyes open finally, it was dark. Too dark, if it weren't for the light beeping from machines and blue tint on the ceiling he would of had to deal with a full on panic attack as well as his injures. He felt the need to sit up. He needed to see the light in his chest still glowing. Feel it and know this wasn't a dream anymore. He moved one hand and touches the brightly lit glass in his chest it brought him comfort to know it was real, even if it did bring with it the dread of why it was there in the first place.
Steve eyes rested on his arc reactor again, the constant light was blinding but still beautiful. He rubbed his chin doubting he’d ever fully understand the importance of that piece of tech. Still it fascinated him; the fact that he built it with scrapes in a cave was impressive.
All that was left now was for Tony to destroy the missile then they could go back to truly enjoying each other's company this time. Now that the elephant was out of the room the two of them felt as though they could actually relax this time. Even if that meant dealing with the ultimate joker drunk, sir Iron Man himself. He chuckled at his untold remark then redirecting his sights up in the sky to watch his friend.
He smiled at the thought of her. 'Before I leave again I promise I'll make sure to come see you Jane, I'm sure your worried when you shouldn't be.' He said silently to himself as he took a deep breath and sighed, remembering where he was at the moment. It was easy to get lost in thought when distracted by the natural beauty of the sky over the huge city.
Within minutes Tony found it harder and harder to keep his eyelids open until it was utterly impossible and he drifted off. It was after he passed out that the doctor noticed the heavily stained bandages and parts of the sheets. His eyes widened at the sight and he quickly over turned the covers to get a better look, hoping that none of the stitches had come loose and opened up to wound again.
Clint said nothing as he took another sip from his beer. "Shouldn't take too long it's not that big of a deal." With that last comment he turned on his heel and sat down on the couch in a huff like a child. Natasha went to join him only to exchange in professional conversation and to remind them just exactly who he was and what organization he was representing. Also most likely to tell him it'd be a good idea to let up a bit, at least until the threat had been dealt with.
I can feel a sharp pain. It's overwhelming I can't stand it, and in my subconscious no less. Something is very wrong and I don't know why. I can feel myself wriggling with discomfort. It's so bad it forces me to wake up and deal with the issue firsthand.
The assistant sprinted back with another needle in hand and plunged it into his chest, slightly to the side of Tony's arc reactor. Within a couple second his breathing slowed once again bringing only minor relief for this would only cause another problem. If his heart rate were to either race or slow just a little bit more there wouldn't be much more they could do about it that they already hadn't done. They needed to work fast.
Even so something was bothering him. Although Bruce was playing along it was hard for him to hide his concern. He always felt like he never had or needed anyone to look out for him. He'd always been able to care for himself he had to after what happened to him. After all he had no other choice. Not much in the world could actually harm him. But he liked to watch over others the only ones who he felt actually accepted him for what he was as well as who he was. Not just the monster but as the man. He pictured himself almost as some sort of guardian angel in some ways, probably more of an arc angel in other ways. He narrowed his brows slightly, figuring it wasn't right to joke around about serious matters like that. He'd always had a tendency to jinx things.
