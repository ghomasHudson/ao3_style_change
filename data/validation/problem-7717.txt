Tony picks up the outdated piece of technology with trembling hands – trust Steve to somehow find a model that Tony is pretty sure ended production at least three years ago. It’s bulky plastic, but rugged – and Tony has a feeling the line is more than secure, it is likely untraceable.
“I did diving when I was in MIT,” Tony continues, crunching on the bacon.
Tony hums in response, which is better than the usual silence he treats Steve to whenever he says those three words. He presses a kiss to Steve’s lips instead.
“Keep – Keep who guessing? You think we’ve already been found out?”
Steve struggles to get his own gloves off, though he cocks back his arm as Tony advances towards him. “I’ll lay you out, Tony, I swear to God. Christ, why did you do that?”
“It has been a very, very, very long time,” Tony mumbles, reaching behind him to grab at Steve, pulling him closer. “I’m not gonna – it’s gonna be quick – God…”
“Do you have a fever?” Steve presses closer to him, his chin resting on Tony’s shoulder. “You’re burning up…” He glances down slowly and his eyes widen, the outline of Tony’s erection is straining against the thin fabric of his briefs. Steve wonders how long Tony has been lying like this in his arms. All night? Surely not. “Oh.”
“Harley,” Tony corrects quickly, and then winces – he’s proving Steve’s point. “Anyways, it doesn’t matter. Pete’s okay, but he wants to stay a little low to the ground.” Tony frowns. “Bad phrase. I mean, he just wants to keep to his neighborhood. I told him that’s fine, of course it is. When I heard about what happened – I – You know, if the kid died…”
“It’s nano-tech. It does what I want it to do, and it’s instantaneous. If you ripped this helmet off of my head, another one would be there before you could land a punch. I learn from my mistakes.”
Steve stands beside Tony, watching as his head shifts slightly on the pillow, a small puff of air escaping through Tony’s parted lips. Steve gently runs the pad of his thumb over Tony’s bottom lip, recalling the many times he had kissed Tony until he was breathless and giggly. It was his favorite thing to do, to reduce Tony to a giggling mess.
“Hey, look. Look at me, Steve.” Tony meets his gaze when the other man is finally able to lift his head to look at him. Gently, he runs the fingers of his right hand through soft blonde hair, taking his time.
Tony picks up his fork, cutting into his egg with the side of it. He takes a big bite, grinning at Steve. “I’ll be Captain America’s first customer at his barbershop. Will there be a quartet there to serenade me?”
“You’re a romantic,” Steve says dryly, but his heart feels a little lighter in his chest. “I don’t consider being in love with you akin to damning myself.”
Tony arches up into his touch with a breathless moan, his hand grabbing at the fabric of Steve’s sweatpants. “Steve,” he gasps as Steve’s fingers dip below the waistband of his briefs.
Steve eventually leaves the ring, once his legs don’t feel so wobbly. He walks into the locker room, sitting down on one of the benches so that he can unwrap his hands. He’s still bleeding, he can feel it trickling warmly down the side of his face, and he shakes his head with a befuddled smile. Tony had swung at him with his full force, and he had packed quite a punch – and then… His fingers touch his lips, closing his eyes for a moment. Tony had kissed him, kissed him hard – but only for a few moments, a few perfect moments, and then he had left Steve standing alone in the ring like an idiot.
One morning, Steve steps out onto the front stoop of the apartment, keys to the motorcycle in his hand, and nearly falls down the steps when he sees Tony knelt on the sidewalk. Tony is surrounded by every single part of Steve’s motorcycle, down to the leather seat. His hands are covered in oil, and there’s a nick on his forearm dripping blood, but Tony doesn’t seem to notice. His teeth are grit together, muscles shifting in his forearm as he twists the socket wrench in his hand, and he pumps his fist in quiet victory when a bolt finally comes loose.
Tony pauses, though his feet don’t falter despite his hesitation. He looks up into Steve’s eyes, his smile tinged with regret. “You have my apologies, Cap.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hang on, I’ve got something for that.” Steve slips off of the stool and pads into his bedroom, rooting around through his duffel bag. He had checked the weather, and assumed that he and Tony would spend some time out in the sun – though his suggestion for a trip down to the beach had died when Tony had told him more of his time in Afghanistan.
“Oh, embarrassed, are we? Lying to my face, that’s easy, but when faced with a little scolding, Steve Rogers runs the other way. Dear old Dad never mentioned that Captain America was a coward – but he spent his whole life licking your boots, so his mouth was a little busy.”
Steve chuckles, not because Tony’s particular line of thinking is funny, but because Tony is spilling out a stream of consciousness – and because Tony is no longer on the roof.
“Don’t kid yourself Tony, you’re gorgeous.”
A cardinal chirps loudly from a towering tree next to the platform, and Steve looks up at it curiously. Tony, warning him not to do this – or Tony, telling him to come?
“One minute,” Tony pulls away from her, hurrying over to where his suitcase is sloppily thrown open across the bed. He unzips one of the suitcase’s compartments, pulling out what looks to be a smart-watch. One quick tap to the watch-face would provide him with a gauntlet – not much, but better than nothing.
“The one who fell off the train?” Tony’s eyebrows raise, and Pepper shrugs. “Steve and I have talked about more than just you and the Avengers, Tony.”
Steve Rogers arrives in Vienna with zip-tie handcuffs around his wrists. That pleases Tony and horrifies him all at once – Steve deserved it, he could have called Tony – could have called in back-up before causing an absolute clusterfuck in Romania. But they shouldn’t have tied Captain America’s wrists together, how dare they do that? Tony hurries over to where Steve and Sam are being led into the building, pulling his Swiss-army knife from his pocket, sliding the blade under the ties around Steve’s wrists. His touch lingers on the back of Steve’s hand, brown eyes briefly searching for any indication on Steve’s face that he had missed Tony. That he had given the night they shared any further thought.
Steve pulls his hand away and Tony sighs almost inaudibly, but Steve hears it.
At least he had learned one thing from Boy Scouts.
“I’ve got enough rest,” Steve tries to wave his right arm, his fingers still numb, but it remains motionless at his side. He tries to snap his fingers sometimes, like he had with the gauntlet on, but they don’t even twitch. He had been offered a prosthetic – but that would involve an amputation. Nothing they could create here would be as good as what Tony would create – so why bother? Tony will fix his arm. Hell, he’ll probably create synthetic nerves and reroute Steve’s entire peripheral nervous system.
“Is that lube? Are you rubbing lube on my neck? What the fuck?”
“In my hotel room,” Pepper says as she presses her hands together. “There was – blood.”
“Shut up and box, Tony,” Steve grins at him, holding his arms up defensively. “You left yourself wide open.”
“You could wear them,” Steve says wildly.
Tony frowns at him, picking up a pillow from where it had fallen off of the foot of the bed, and chucking it at Steve’s head.
“Not bad?” Steve takes the steps two at a time, his hands resting on Tony’s shoulders, squeezing. “It’s great! Feels brand new.”
Tony shrugs again, “No. I have FRIDAY monitoring all channels, believe me, but I still want to be careful. You’re great in the sack, Rogers, but I’d prefer not to die just because I needed to get laid.”
“What’s gotten into you?”
Steve shakes his head again, raising an eyebrow at Tony’s back. “You seem jumpy.”
“Tony,” Steve’s voice is soft, the voice he uses when it is just the two of them. The door to the med bay closes behind him, and Tony is dimly aware of blood staining Steve’s suit. Fresh blood.
There’s only one contact in the list, Tony stares at the name and the string of numbers beneath it. Steve, it says – not Steve Rogers, or Captain America – but Steve. Perhaps… Tony reaches up and rubs at the edge of his jaw, scratching through the neatly trimmed hair.
“No,” Tony groans as he struggles to his feet, wanting to come up with some razor-sharp retort to the fact that Bruce Banner is pushing a wheelchair into the med bay for him, but all he feels at the idea is gratitude. “No, I have stuff I need to say to our magnificent leader.”
“But I thought we – weren’t?”
Tony laughs giddily, covering his hands with his face. “Christ, Rhodey, I think I’m going crazy. I really think I’ve lost it. One too many hard blows to the head.”
“Steve,” Pepper says quietly, getting to her feet, her hand brushing down his forearm. “It’s good you’re here. He’s been asking for you.”
Steve’s blue eyes are dark with something Tony’s never seen in them – terror.
“We’ll be here,” Pepper says softly at the other side of the bed. “I promise, Tony. Rest.”
Once the bill is settled, Tony stands unsteadily from the table, and Steve’s large hand rests on his waist to steady him.
“Uh… The other night, when we had chicken, I cut the packet open with them.”
“You’ve told her?” Tony’s voice is sharp, “Jesus, Steve – I don’t want people knowing – the whole point of meeting in secret is to keep it secret.”
Brown eyes scrutinize him, and Tony’s lips press together firmly, but he doesn’t question Steve.
“This okay?”
“Tony,” Steve chides. “You’ve practically adopted Peter Parker. What about that kid in Tennessee. Harold?”
“Dashingly handsome? Drop dead gorgeous? Utterly fucka-?”
“Okay, thanks, then. Thought you were doing something really fucking weird. Like letting me know that you have a sunburn fetish, or something. I was gonna walk out.”
“Yeah, you should have.” It’s supposed to be spiteful, but the words from Tony are exhausted. How many times had he asked Steve to just
“Yeah, but next time -.”
“Schmidt,” Tony corrects himself obediently, though it’s not nearly as impressive. “He said she was dead. I don’t think he’s lying. Nebula didn’t think so either.”
Tony lets Steve guide him down onto the grass, lets Steve rest his hands on his shoulders and take a look at him.
“Which one is that?” Rhodey asks lightly, watching him walk away. “There are just so many.” He laughs as Tony flicks him off without looking back, but his expression turns troubled – whenever Tony kept something from him, it was usually bad news. It was usually life threatening.
Tony moves his hands up between them, pushing against Steve’s chest until he lets go. There’s a scowl on his face as he looks around the arrivals terminal.
“It’s beautiful,” Steve says honestly, closing his eyes as Tony’s fingers move swiftly over the keys with more confidence.
“Steve…” Tony breathes, and then he groans loudly, and Steve tenses. “God, Steve – Are you still… Ha… Located in… Good ol’… NYC?”
“God, Tony, you have a lot of hair.” Steve’s fingers gently massage his scalp as he works, shifting as Tony sags against him.
“Ten,” Tony replies guiltily, moving away from Steve so he can sit at the table. He gives Steve a look when the other man sits across from him and pats his lap, one that tells Steve not to push his luck.
“No, Tony,” Steve murmurs, rolling his hips experimentally against the other man’s, Tony’s fingers tugging at his hair sharply, insistently. The pearl buttons of Tony’s dress shirt ease out of the holes confining them in quick succession, Steve’s blunt fingers dancing down the scar left over from his recent surgery. “I’m going to make you beg for it,” he murmurs, capturing Tony’s lips with his own, ignoring the sharper tug at his hair, instead focusing on the way Tony’s body jerks against his.
“I have to go, Tony – I have a meeting in San Francisco. I tried to cancel it, but…”
“Tony?” Steve asks carefully, his hand shifting over Tony’s side. Tony tenses at the touch, exhaling sharply between gritted teeth.
He nearly bumps into Steve as he gets into the ring, caught up in his own thoughts. Steve steadies him with a red glove to the shoulder, pressing the gold mouth guard into the palm of Tony’s black glove.
Tony turns his head, giving Steve a sardonic smile, the faint bruises on his neck now visible over the collar of his dress shirt. Steve’s eyes widen slightly, his jaw tensing, and his voice is low when he speaks.
“Try it on,” Steve suggests, watching Tony pick the piece of jewelry up, holding it between his thumb and forefinger.
“Take a later one,” Steve requests quietly, feeling Tony tense in his arms.
“Wait, what’s going on? Are you okay?” Tony watches her as she hurries away, and then throws himself back against the building as a taxi careens onto the sidewalk. He looks up into the sky, people are pointing at the sky –
“Tony — my bike!” Steve says in horror. “What the hell are you doing to it?”
Natasha’s hands reach up, undoing his crooked tie, her blue eyes focused on the red fabric.
“I shouldn’t have come here,” Tony says, his back to him. He stares out at the ocean, watching the rough waves as they roll in against the cliff. “I can hardly look at you without wanting to throw a punch or vomit. Sometimes both.”
The question catches Tony off guard, it seems too personal. “You mean, how long did you put me in the hospital for, Cap?”
He moves his trembling hand to the back of his head, the hum turning into a whine.
“You said it yourself, Tony, he’s staying low to the ground. What’s the worst that can happen in Queens?”
Steve huffs, fingers curling against Tony’s hip, ushering him forward. “Genius intellect?”
Tony pushes himself forward into the counter, the edge of it painful against his hip, and he grabs Steve’s arm and pulls his hand out from under his sweater. Inches away from him, and then feet – another room, as he hurries towards the fireplace.
“You know how to make fresh pasta?” Steve can’t stop himself from asking, he wonders if Tony will ever stop surprising him.
“You had a fifty-fifty shot, don’t get too cocky,” Tony mutters, grabbing him by the hand and pulling him inside. “C’mon. Stairs. Up the fucking stairs.”
“No, don’t.” Now it is Steve begging, and there’s a nice change – because Tony had spent the last couple of months begging him to come to his senses, to sign the goddamn Accords and be done with it.
Tony scowls at him, but he doesn’t pull his arm away. “Missed you, you idiot. Of course I missed that too, but that’s not why… I wanted to see you. Found your address. I was just indulging in a little bit of liquid courage before coming to see you. Meant to order an Uber. Got a bit too drunk – those guys must have followed me once I left the bar. They said my name, I turned — no one has called me by my name in a long time – and then, bam, bat to the head.”
“We have to keep living, Tony,” Steve moves to his bedside, his hand now resting on Tony’s wrist. Tony pulls his hand away, nausea returning.
“Safe and sound. Snug as a bug in a rug. Though, if I were a bug in a rug, I’d be worried about getting stepped on. So is that considered snug…?”
“Steve.”
shield – he had felt the crack of bone more than he had heard it. It was hard to hear much, with the blood rushing in his ears, he could barely hear Steve’s panting breaths as he struggled to climb off of Tony.
Tony’s pulse races, arousal and panic – he needs to get out, now, needs to get away. His fist strikes Steve on the ear, Steve’s hand pulling away, his teeth biting sharply at Tony’s bottom lip in surprise.
Tony stares at him searchingly, and then he shakes his head, bruised hands clenched into fists at his sides.
He manages to lift his right arm, trembling fingers pressing against the front of his hospital gown – and he doesn’t feel metal and glass like he did last time, but the rough fabric of sutures.
Tony laughs, bordering on manic. “Are you kidding me, Steve? We’ve barely scratched the surface – hell, you’ve not even read the goddamn thing, and you shot it down.”
There’s a huge spaceship descending on New York City, and Tony swallows back vomit.
Steve closes the newspaper and sets it over his knee, frowning at Tony. “How are you feeling?”
“I understand now,” Steve sighs, the pastry buttery, the chocolate rich. “I’ll probably eat eight.”
“How long of a walk is this?” Steve can’t help but ask as Tony turns him down another winding street, though he’s slowly untucking Tony’s shirt from his trousers as they walk.
“We’re all meeting in the dining room,” Steve says, his voice already fading as he walks away.
Steve will grin and pull his hand away, and will allow Tony to get the tomato – but only if he agrees to have coffee with Steve. Tony will blush, and stammer, and say
“I’m so sorry, Tony.”
“You’re okay,” Steve repeats, hand still slowly stroking Tony through his orgasm, the other man rocking into his touch. “I’ve got you.”
“Mr. Stark, Mr. Stark! Are the other Avengers joining you to ratify the Accords today?”
Tony’s fingers drop from his goatee to the bruised bite mark at the juncture of his shoulder.
Tony looks down at his filthy arms and hands and shakes his head slowly. “Doesn’t matter, does it?”
“I do hear you,” Steve insists, climbing out of bed. He wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, holding him close, the night’s cool breeze playing over his warm skin. “I hear you, Tony.” His lips press to Tony’s neck, feeling his pulse quicken at the touch. “You don’t want to get married. Okay, we won’t get married. But you don’t come here just for sex.”
Steve’s hand unfurls against his thigh – they have circled back to this, and perhaps it’s time. Time for him to listen, and then he will tell Tony what he needs to hear – because Steve is starting to believe it, too.
“Are you complaining?” Steve’s voice is low, his fingers brushing down the bumps of Tony’s spine, running over the curve of his ass.
Tony pauses as Steve’s lips press against his neck, the bandage wrappers fluttering to the floor as his hand unfurls. His eyes close, doing his best to stay standing – it’s not his fault that Steve had got lucky, had figured him out easily, had placed a kiss on the spot that has always unraveled him. Thoughts of tomorrow’s meeting slip away, thoughts of Steve’s damaged reputation fade.
It stings when Tony pulls out of Steve’s arms so that he can begin packing up his suitcase. He pulls away very quickly, and Steve feels like an idiot, his arms dangling at his sides.
Tony fists his fingers against Steve’s broad back as Steve’s hand squeezes between his legs, and his knees go weak.
Rhodey had invited him over to his mother’s for Christmas, noticing the way Tony was wandering lost around the compound, his hand occasionally moving to a slight lump under his shirt. He was wearing a necklace of some sort, Rhodey could see the metal beads that made up the chain around his neck – but Rhodey was also concerned about the faint blue light visible through the fabric of Tony’s shirt. Tony had declined his invitation, how could he look into the eyes of Rhodey’s mother, as the man who had effectively paralyzed her son?
“Come to bed,” Tony murmurs, grabbing him by the hand and pulling him up off the couch.
Steve leans back in his chair, crossing his arms over his chest. A muscle jumps in his forearm, Tony watches it, his mouth going dry. He forces himself to look into Steve’s eyes, to not get distracted by the almost healed cut on his face – the cut Tony had caused.
Steve laughs, shaking his head. “You wanna try the real thing?”
“You might want to like – start out with some scissors. Do you have scissors?”
Steve looks away, and Tony shoulders past him.
Again, Tony’s punch misses. “What the fuck are you talking about?”
“Welcome, Anthony, son of Maria. And…” Tony’s fist strikes Steve’s bicep, jumping out of his skin as the cloaked figure appears before them.
“I don’t care for that name – or, I didn’t.”
Tony swallows again, Steve can feel his heart racing against his chest, and as he waits, he brushes his fingers over the patch of dark hair just above Tony’s reactor. Tony’s breathing hitches.
Pepper keeps her eyes fixed on his, though she’s worrying her bottom lip with her teeth.
“Tony,” Steve says in warning, looking over at him. “I thought we agreed not to talk about -.”
“When I showed myself in Russia, has Ross been after you since?”
he’ll say, his voice quiet. Steve will begin to hear the gears shifting in Tony’s brain, the endless amount of ideas taking shape simultaneously.
“Tony, you know that I -.”
“Hey,” Tony’s voice lowers, hand reaching out for Steve’s, but then he pauses and pulls it back to his side of the table. “Yeah, I’m the official whipping boy for the Avengers, but someone’s gotta do it, right? Not like you’ve left me much of a choice."
“This’ll do,” Tony mutters to himself, opening up a cabinet and pulling out a box of pasta. He frowns, shaking it. “It would be better fresh.”
Tony would laugh at being called sweetheart – Steve’s not called him a pet name before, not even in bed – but he’s drunk, and he’s terrified, and he can’t pull himself away from the edge of the roof.
“You bought this whole – when?”
Pepper catches his wrist, gently pulling his hand away before he causes some damage. “You had to have your sternum replaced. It was cracked in two. It’s lucky you keep such excellent documentation on your health, Mr. Stark,” Pepper gives him a tired smile. “They were able to craft a new one from your blueprints. You had a punctured lung, too, and that will take time to heal. A few cracked ribs. A concussion.”
“December is shot for me,” Tony replies unhappily, “I’ll spend Christmas alone because otherwise it’ll attract attention. Any time after – I’ll let you pick the place again. This time I’ll stay for longer than an hour.” He wipes his fingers clean, returning to one of the open windows, gazing down at the street below. The music is louder, and he leans forward, wishing it were his fingers on the keys of the piano.
“The Soul Stone requires a soul before it reveals itself. A soul for a soul, as it were.”
Tony squeezes his wrist, brown eyes dark.
“I do,” Steve blushes, looking away. “I – Well, Tony, I came here to spend time with you. I wasn’t just going to sit inside and watch television when I could sit out here with you.”
“Why did you come, then?” Tony snaps, taking another gulp of wine to fortify himself. “Don’t answer that.”
Tony shrugs his shoulders with such fluidity that Steve once again wonders how a man could be so tense and so relaxed all at once.
Steve nods. “Was the kid alright?”
Steve hears the door to the bedroom shut behind him, slowly reaching up to touch where Tony had kissed him, his skin warm. He smiles to himself, gathering up the clippers and the kitchen scissors.
“I did ballet as a kid. You envy my footwork,” Tony says, stepping closer to Steve, the other man’s eyes on his right hand when they really should be on his left. Steve seems completely unfazed as Tony’s fist strikes him in the ribs, though Tony doubles over and draws his hand back.
“We’ll see you in five seconds, Cap.”
“I’m sorry, Tony, but I have to. I’ll be back first thing in the morning, okay? I promise.” Steve leans down and kisses Tony’s cheek, the coarse hairs of his beard a new sensation. Steve idly wonders when he had decided to let his perfectly shaped goatee go.
Steve laughs, setting his duffel bag down on the bed – Tony had arrived the night before, and had already made a mess of it. He straightens one of the pillows idly, looking over at where Tony’s standing at the balcony with his back to him. Steve carefully reaches into his pocket and slides the ring box under the pillow.
“Why are you wearing a helmet?” Steve asks as he shades over the crest of Tony’s bicep, frowning down at his drawing.
“I hate you,” Tony says heatedly, brown eyes so dark that they’re almost black. “I hate you – I shouldn’t have to worry about you getting your dumb ass caught! You think – I know you
Tony is a difficult man to fully understand – Steve had seen countless tabloid covers recounting Tony’s exploits. In idle jealousy, he had done research on every ex-flame Tony had that had been publicized. There was never a photo of him kissing his partner, though, the most scandalous thing was a snapshot of him holding hands with Pepper as they walked down the street. For all the talk about Tony being a playboy, his displays of affection are kept private.
And yes, he had to ask Wanda Maximoff not to leave the Avengers compound – ask being a shifty word. She hadn’t tried to leave, thus far, he had checked the security cameras. She was doing something pretty fucking weird, though, Tony had squinted down at the footage in disbelief. He wouldn’t brag, but he considers himself quite experienced when it comes to flirtation, and if he didn’t know any better – Wanda was spending her time flirting with
Tony is pulled out from the song by the brush of cool metal over his skin, Steve’s dog tags resting between the juts of his collarbones. He reaches up, fingertip rubbing over the raised metal of Steve’s name.
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve says as he fixes the collar of Tony’s hospital gown, Pepper’s hands trembling as she strokes Tony’s shoulder and gently presses him back down against the bed.
“What are you doing?” Steve is stressed – Tony can tell, because the other man is snapping at him, and his hands are fisted at his sides. He stares down at Tony where he’s knelt in the dirt, a muscle twitching in his jaw.
“I’m on the roof,” Tony breathes, looking down at the ground again – it doesn’t seem so far away now, and the snow would catch him, surely. It would cushion his fall. It wouldn’t be so bad, to jump.
Steve matches his intensity, as if he has the same pent up longing that Tony has suffered from since he was fifteen – but there’s no way.
He runs a hand over his face, feeling the heat of his cheeks against his palm – he doesn’t have the energy to act on these thoughts tonight, these thoughts of Tony – and when he did act on those thoughts, he usually ended up feeling worse than before. He wonders if this is how Peggy had felt for the first few years, wondering if Steve would ever come back.
“Shh, Tony. Sweetheart, please, breathe.” Her fingers card through his hair, slender and soft while Steve’s had been thick and rough from work. Guilt burns almost as bright as the pain in his chest, but he shouldn’t feel guilty – it has been almost half a year since they had broken up. But he does feel guilty, she still wears the perfume he had bought for her, she still touches him with the same tenderness – old habits die hard.
Steve does not smile, and more tears are falling. Tony, on the other hand, feels nothing. Maybe the faintest bit of terror – but he’s accustomed to death. Yes, he’s afraid of heights, but it ought to be immediate. It will be nothing like slowly starving, adrift in space. It will be nothing like the fifteen minutes of sheer paralysis Obadiah Stane inflicted on him, razor-sharp shrapnel moving through his sluggish veins to his heart.
“Where’d she go? Didn’t Nebula say she died?” Tony reaches up and curls his fingers under the collar of the new suit he’s wearing – red, black, and white. Totally tasteless. But they had been pressed for time on the design front, and all it had to do was protect their bodies from the Quantum Realm. Tony doesn’t allow himself to think about the Quantum Realm for any extended periods of time, he finds it entirely infuriating – how can something exist that defies the laws of physics so arrogantly?
Tony’s grip on the phone tightens, his jaw set.
Someone must be sitting on his chest.
“I just want to make sure that we’re both clear.”
“You didn’t come here to drink.”
“Wanna go for a walk?” Tony asks instead of answering the question. “It’s a nice day out. We could go to Central Park.”
“Keep living,” Tony repeats to himself as the door shuts behind Steve.
“Steve.” Tony says in utter exasperation, pushing himself off of him. Steve watches as he climbs out of bed on unsteady legs, staggering into the bedside table before he rights himself. “Steve, you’re a
Tony rubs at his tired eyes as he steps into the stairwell, the air incredibly warm compared to what he had endured outside. His feet carry him down the stairs, walking without purpose – at least, he doesn’t think he has a purpose as he falls face-first onto Steve’s bed.
Tony clicks call, and raises the phone up to his ear, hearing it ring. He looks up sharply at a whistling sound coming in through the doors, looking over his shoulder at the other three men, and then hurries towards the door when he hears screams.
Tony pulls his fingers away from Steve’s hand, his jaw set, knife slipping up under Sam’s ties and cutting them.
“Anything earth shattering?” Tony pulls back the comforter to slide into the bed beside Steve, but he’s not fast enough. Steve’s eyes travel down from his face, to his chest, to his abdomen, lower – lower – and then back up to his face in a flash. He’s blushing, Tony realizes, and Tony isn’t.
“Captain America,” Tony slurs, giving him a sardonic salute. “Need a fresh uniform there, buddy.”
Steve is tense in his arms, shaking slightly, and Tony rubs his hand against the small of his back soothingly.
Tony’s fist slips off the side of the bag, thrown off by the sudden appearance of Steve Rogers just behind him. He whirls around, crossing his arms over his chest, trying to ignore how stupid he feels in these clunky boxing gloves.
“Don’t Tony me,” he snaps, pointing at Steve, inwardly wishing he had the gauntlet on – the hum of the repulsor would keep him at bay. “When you Tony me, it makes me…”
Steve’s large hand rests over his, easing up on the bottle. His warm breath causes the hair on the back of Tony’s neck to stiffen.
“What?” Steve’s skin is cold against his palm, and his eyes bulge slightly. “No, absolutely not.”
Steve plugs the razor in, opening the small case that comes with it and nudging it over to Tony. “What guard do you… you want?” His eyes are fixed on the terrible scar on Tony’s abdomen, and Tony flushes, looking intently at the options.
“Yup. I think the number is closer to fifteen. All because of my parents – all because I thought my dad… killed the both of them by being drunker than ever. His BAC had been off the charts. I never dug into it… Always believed what I was told… Thought the autopsy photos would tear me apart – they probably would, too. So, Dad drove drunk, Mom died and he died, too – and I was left alone. I give money every year to a fund for children who lost their parents due to drunk driving. I rail against it whenever I have the opportunity to in the press. And he probably wasn’t even drunk.” His laughter is raspy, and he regrets laughing at all because his lungs flare with pain. “Christ.”
No trust, he had said. He had called Steve a liar – and wasn’t that the truth? All Steve ever did was lie to him – whether it was about his parents, or his intentions, or loving Tony, or saying that he wants to marry him.
“Here, let me,” Steve says, reaching for the handle, and Tony wrenches it away from him.
“This is crazy,” Steve sounds almost hysterical, borderline, anyways. “There has to be another way.”
“You’re bleeding,” Tony snaps, feeling like a broken record, but he doesn’t wrench his wrist out of Steve’s grip, and he doesn’t knock the ice pack off of his hands once Steve places it there.
“Are you telling me that you don’t want me to cook?” Tony laughs, and Steve rests his forehead against the door at the sound. “Believe me, Steve, my desire to poison you has lessened a tiny bit since yesterday. I’ll take a bite off of your plate before you eat so you can be sure of your safety.” He opens the door, taking half a step back when he sees that Steve is standing in the doorway. “Anyways. Ross is breathing down my neck,” he squeezes past Steve, doing his best to ignore the fluttering in his chest at the close contact. “I can’t afford to be seen eating dinner with a not-blonde but maybe-blonde if you squint muscular looking guy.”
Tony’s hand drops away, and he presses his face against Steve’s abdomen as he stands in front of him, his arms idly reaching up to wrap around Steve’s waist.
He selects a guard and slots it on top of the razor, holding it up to Steve.
Steve holds up his hand, and Tony’s eyebrows raise, but his lips clamp together all the same.
Steve looks over his shoulder, wary of being overheard. “You shouldn’t call me that.”
“Steve,” he murmurs, his lips parting at the brush of Steve’s tongue.
The punching bag swings back as Tony lands another hit against it, jarring his arm all the way up to his shoulder. He snarls, left arm cocked back, and hits it again. It has been a long time since he’s boxed, but today has been particularly stressful – hell, the past six months have been extremely stressful. Sweat trickles down his back, soaking into the black tank top he had thrown on with shaking hands, his designer suit lying crumpled in a heap in the locker room. Wrapping his knuckles with white tape had been easy enough, tugging on the boxing gloves with his teeth had been a struggle, but now he’s here – completely alone, able to throw as many punches as he wants.
“Fell?”
“There’s an address in the envelope – you’ll have to cut it open, I slipped it between the padding. Meet me there, Tony. We can talk.”
Tony deletes the text, again, pressing his knuckles to his forehead.
“Where are you, sweetheart?” Steve can’t help himself, he needs to soothe Tony – this is just like Christmas on the roof. “Can you see a street sign? I’m coming to you right now. I promise.” He pulls on a shirt and throws on his leather jacket. It’s chilly out, and Tony is now sobbing into the phone – Steve can’t make out what he’s saying. He grabs one of his hoodies just in case, if Tony’s been mugged, he might be down a coat.
“Maybe Gamora didn’t die after all,” Tony suggests, and Steve squeezes his arm tighter. Sighing, Tony looks up at the crest of the mountain, squinting – this place is awfully foggy. He wants to ask FRIDAY to run an analysis on the atmosphere – but Steve is already snippy with him for getting distracted.
“You could retire.” Steve shifts in his chair. “You know that you could retire.”
The pen, his father’s pen, strikes him dead between the eyes. Tony’s eyes water instantly, reaching up to feel his skin, the welt rising up on his forehead.
Steve grunts as Tony shoves him away, bumping into the ropes behind him, and his expression is a mixture of disappointment and confusion.
“I haven’t played in forever,” Tony murmurs, mostly to himself, his touch light. “Not in years. Feels rusty.”
Steve’s hand brushes lower, getting a generous handful of Tony’s ass and squeezing, grinning when Tony makes what sounds like a surprised squeak – he’ll tease him about it in the morning.
“I did,” Steve says through the door as Tony shuts it between them. “I got some bits and pieces, though, nothing major… I thought we’d go out to eat.”
“Fuck.”
Pepper looks over her shoulder at him, frowning. “Steve, can’t it wait?”
dang things got a teeny bit raunchy, huh... alright i think i feel satisfied with this one  -- it had to be more than a one shot, but... i made myself sad :(
Steve’s stomach drops, appetite withering. “You’re – just one night?”
.” Venom drips from Tony’s voice, and Steve is the one to recoil, looking out the glass door at the parking garage. “You want me to bust my skull open? Jesus. I’ll rent a car.”
“Nat? I… It’s Tony – he’s home.”
“Alright, fine. Fine. You don’t want to talk about it? Fine. I don’t want to talk about it.” Tony wipes at his lips with the napkin he had spread across his lap, his hands mercifully steady. “You can ask about the kid, I can ask about Nat – but we shouldn’t… You know… Otherwise, we’ll both just fight. The last time I fought with you, I nearly died, so…”
He lets go of Steve’s hand as they step onto the main path of the park, reaching out to rub his fingers over the white petals of a hydrangea. He leans in and breathes in the scent of the flowers deeply, until he sneezes. Steve laughs quietly at his side, patting him on the back.
“You – sports?”
Instead, he opens his mouth and says, “I’m not having sex with you this time.”
Tony groans, still smiling. “She’s evil.”
“My bathroom, the razor’s in there.” Steve makes his way down the hallway to his bedroom, hearing Tony’s light footsteps as he trails behind him. He’s not as skinny as when Steve had last seen him five years ago, but he’s leaner than before – his biceps are toned from heavy lifting, though, and Steve wants to hear more about the projects that Tony had dedicated five years to. Did anyone ever thank him for his help?
“Bit of a light pour, there, Rogers,” Tony looks at him over the rim of the cup, relaxing as warmth travels down his throat.
He wipes his hand over the fogged up mirror, gazing at his reflection. There are dark shadows under his eyes, the shower had washed away the concealer he had cautiously applied in the cramped airplane bathroom. His fingers brush over the ragged edge of his goatee, reaching with his other hand for his razor – he has time to take care of that, at least, there are bound to be press photos. He needs to look his best, he needs to look like he himself had written the Sokovia Accords.
Steve humors him. “You were right about the Accords. I don’t believe in them, Tony, you know I don’t. But we wouldn’t have been able to avoid them, or something worse later down the road. The world is different, sometimes I think I’ve adapted to it, and then something happens and I realize that I’m still frozen. I should have just signed them.”
The surgeon raises his eyebrows, “Then it’s a damn miracle he got out of there with only a skull fracture and internal damage – usually we see broken limbs.”
Steve laughs, and Tony closes his eyes at the sound. “Hey, I was just asking for a suggestion, Tony. C’mon, give me something to go on.”
Possessing the flip phone that now sits on the glass top of the desk is probably more than an inch out of line.
Tony sighs as he looks at him, leaning back against the door. The sunlight pours in from the curtains, which stir at the slight breeze – Tony had opened the windows before going to the bathroom, wanting to breathe in fresh air. The light dances over Steve’s back, shadows and glow, catching streaks of gold in his now dark hair. Tony’s mouth had left a purple bruise on the curve of his shoulder, so Tony leans down over the bed and presses his lips to it. Steve stirs, his hand grabbing at the hem of Tony’s shirt, trying to pull him down onto the bed.
“Tony.” Steve opens the door for them, his hands held up defensively in front of his chest. “Look, whatever it is you need to say…” He shuts the front door behind Tony, his voice echoing against the white tile floors. “I promise, I’ll listen – but I really think that you should lie down.”
“It doesn’t matter now,” Tony says quietly, looking away from her. “It doesn’t matter – because – because he nearly killed me. And he would have done it, I think, if I hadn’t…”
Bucky says nothing, he looks at Steve for a long moment – Steve can see pity there, and exasperation. And then he is alone, lying on a bed that is too big for just one person, with Tony’s ghost beside him.
Tony waves his hand noncommittally. “You didn’t answer my question.”
“Do you think — You can say no. In fact, if you say no, you’ll spare me from any further embarrassment, but… Look, I haven’t been sleeping. So, I was wondering —.” Tony grimaces, looking away. “Do you think I could sleep with you tonight?” The words come out in a rush, said on one breath of air, and Tony deflates slowly afterwards.
“Absolutely not,” Tony yawns, his blistered fingers held protectively against his chest – he’ll be a mess in the morning. At least there’s the med bay, though there’s no doctor here to tend to him. He’ll make do – a Boxing Day miracle.
“I know,” Tony says quickly, “I know, you can’t bring yourself to do this. You’re grieving too, I know. Somehow you lost the love of your life and gained your best friend back from the dead all in one day.”
“Oh, you have such a way with words – why didn’t you say that before I sucked your dick?” Tony’s hand strikes the table top, and Steve’s eyes widen in embarrassment, his cheeks flushing. “Or after? What was that to you, just a way to let off steam?”
“No, I’m not gonna wear that shit,” Tony calls after him, though he feels as though he’s floating above himself.
“Print media’s still a thing?” Tony asks, reaching out and poking Steve’s newspaper in the center of the front page. “Or do you order it special?”
“Did it get Ross off of your back?”
Steve closes his eyes, forcing himself to try to rest, and he’s just drifting off when a heavy vibration rumbles through his wooden nightstand. He keeps the flip phone charged – just as he did while he and Tony were meeting in secret – a desperate, quiet hope that Tony would call him. He is the only one to know the number. Steve’s eyes open, lifting his head up from the pillow, squinting at the nightstand in disbelief. The vibration continues.
“My eyes are quite literally up here, Cap,” Tony says sharply.
“Captain Rogers.” A nurse stands at the foot of Tony’s bed, making notes in his chart. “Visiting hours are over.”
Steve frowns, Tony’s hands slipping down to grab at his bicep, leading him down the hallway to their room.
“I love you,” Steve murmurs in the dark as Tony pulls the duvet up over them, slinging an arm over Steve’s chest.
If Steve is surprised to hear that Tony knows exactly where the ex-Avengers are hiding out, he doesn’t show it. Instead, he reaches up and brushes his fingers through his dark hair, it’s long enough now that he’s slicked it back with something. Tony’s fingers twitch against his thigh – if it’s not as blonde anymore, at least it will still be soft, right?
The days between Christmas and New Years pass in a drunken blur for Tony. Rhodey, at some point in that time span, returns home – and is horrified to see the state that Tony is in. He bandages Tony’s burned hand for him and tries to wheedle out what has gotten Tony to this point, but Tony merely brushes him aside and disappears to his workshop.
“Secretary Ross and a few lackeys made an unexpected house call. Don’t worry, Cap, I gave as good as I got.”
“I came on my bike. I don’t want – you’ll… I don’t want to hurt you.”
Steve follows after Tony sleepily, not protesting when Tony pulls his shirt up over his head. Tony’s lips press to his bare skin, and he can almost hear Tony’s thoughts with each touch of his lips:
Steve’s childhood is a mysterious thing, Tony is curious about it, but he's never asked. Without realizing it, he’s inching back from the edge of the roof, the nanites making their rapid trek back to the reactor.
“And I slept with him – like an absolute idiot.” He reaches up with his free hand to run it over his eyes, brushing aside tears. “Oh, Pep, I was an idiot. I slept with him, he lied to me, and he didn’t even give a damn.”
lonely and nobody cares what happens to him. “Why’d you call me?”
“Come on,” Tony scoffs, crossing his arms over his chest, “I’m not that egocentric.”
“Thank you,” Tony mumbles, his hand dropping away. “I’m…”
“I said…” Steve’s fingers slip away from Tony’s hair, down his neck, dog tags jingling as he plays with them idly. “Marry me.”
“Looks like you’ll have to improvise,” Tony’s voice is muffled against the fabric of Steve’s t-shirt. “You’ve got to be almost done, this is taking forever.”
“Okay, tomorrow, then,” Tony says quickly, hurrying his pace. “I’ll admit, we should have taken a taxi.”
“No,” Steve says, his voice hoarse from disuse. “No, I’ll do it.”
“It is you,” Steve replies fervently, “It is you. Yeah, it’ll be hard. I’ve got notes on what they did to you in Wakanda, and I won’t have access to the tech, but I’ll make it work.”
“Mr. Stark,” the nurse says cheerily, “I have your discharge papers – but first, you need to get out of bed!”
“I…” Steve swallows, this isn’t how this is supposed to go. Lisbon is experiencing a freak heat-wave for January, the temperatures outside are in the low 70s. This trip to Portugal is supposed to mirror their trip to Paris. They were supposed to set aside what happened in the past and enjoy each other’s company. Not even in bed, the entire time, no – Steve missed hearing Tony rant about his newest invention, and Steve had never heard Tony play the piano. There had been one in Stark Tower, a beautiful, shining grand piano. Pepper Potts had heard Tony play, and Steve knew it was ridiculous to feel jealous about that, but… When he had rented their house for their time here, he had searched high and low for a house that came with a piano – just in case Tony felt like playing for him. Now, Tony is more likely to throw the piano at him in a fit of rage.
“About this?” Steve steps back to allow Tony into the elevator. The moment the doors slide shut, Tony’s hands cup his face, his lips pressing to Steve’s softly.
“Can I get you some lunch now?”
“I have a flight.” Tony murmurs, his hands slipping away from his face as Steve’s lips press just below his ear.
Rhodey looks up at him as he walks back into the gym, and he instantly can tell that something is up.
“Fine.” Tony can’t believe the word comes out of his mouth, and hope is growing in his chest again, no matter how many times he plucks it out. “Fine. But I’m not – I…”
Steve’s hands brush down his shoulders and over his arms, and Steve’s grin has faded. “Are you okay?”
“Tony.”
“There are a lot of things you don’t know, Cap.” Tony says dryly, shifting on his feet.
“Oh, really?” Tony lands another blow, grinning against the mouth guard, his teeth grinding into the rubber. Steve’s forearms are like rods of steel, Tony’s knuckles swelling inside of his gloves as his fists attempt to get through the barrier Steve has created to his body.
Tony reaches up slowly to rub at his upper arm where Steve had grabbed it, gently brushing his palm over the fabric of the jacket he’s wearing. The movement draws Steve’s gaze to the faint light in Tony’s chest – and that’s not right, Tony didn’t have a reactor anymore. He had seen the evidence of its removal himself.
It stings, and Steve closes his eyes and wonders if the burn is punishment for the kiss.
“Tony?” Steve turns the keys, motorcycle humming to life, but Tony is still slumped over. He grabs him by the collar of his thin t-shirt, pulling him back to rest against Steve’s chest. The way Tony’s body flops lifelessly against Steve terrifies him, and his trembling fingers press just under Tony’s jaw. There’s a pulse there – thready, weak, and arrhythmic, but there. Steve holds him as tightly as he can risk with Tony’s internal injuries, and speeds to the nearest hospital.
When Tony wakes, he’s lying on one of the beds in the med bay. There’s an IV in the back of his hand, and Tony squints at the IV rack beside his head.
“My…” He blinks again, eyes narrowing, sudden clarity – Steve relaxes. “Oh, right, my haircut. Where to, Cap?”
“Did you make snowmen?”
“You keep threatening to hang up on me,” Steve teases, and he doesn’t have the right to do that – not after the damage he’s inflicted on Tony, both physically and… “I’m serious. Give me a chance to explain, to apologize. I just – need to see you. You don’t have to see me again, afterwards, if you don’t want to – but…”
“He killed my parents!” Tony’s voice cracks as he shouts, and he stops himself before he can lob the empty glass at Steve’s self-righteous head.
The world, having lost so much already, does not take note when Tony Stark disappears. Steve Rogers does. Once every three months or so, Pepper Potts would alert him to a large cash withdrawal made from Tony Stark’s private bank account. Always in big cities – Miami, Seattle, Las Vegas, Dallas, New Orleans – never New York. Steve would throw himself onto the Quinjet the moment Pepper notified him, and he would spend a week in the city Tony had made a withdrawal from, hoping to catch sight of him. Five years had gone by, and he had never seen Tony – no one had heard from him, not even Pepper. The only reason they knew Tony was alive at all was because of these large withdrawals, made on the first of every third month. Steve would watch the grainy security footage on the flight, blue eyes focused on the blurry image of Tony Stark – bearded, with shaggy hair, and always wearing sunglasses.
Afterwards, once he’s caught his breath, he climbs off of Tony with the intent of getting a washcloth from the bathroom to clean up. Tony tackles him back against the mattress, moving with shocking speed and expending force Steve didn’t know that he had.
“So…” Steve says after a pause, another sip of wine – it’s dry, and not entirely pleasant, but he’s never been one for wine. “How’s the kid?”
“Eager,” Tony tsks, looking over at a quiet park to the right. “God, I wish it was daylight. The colors on the leaves are beautiful. Hey, let’s stop in there…”
He manages to hold his right hand over the wound, nanites flowing upwards from his chest to encase his hand in a gauntlet. They flow out of his fingertips and into the wound, incredibly cold, and Tony bites down on his bottom lip at the pain.
“What?” Steve murmurs, “Do you want to talk about it?”
“In bed.”
“Sorry,” Steve manages to pull his gaze away, his cheeks flushed pink. He nearly looks Tony in the eyes, but his gaze falls upon the reactor in his chest. It’s a different design than Steve remembers – triangular, sleek, the blue light laced over by streaks of silver metal. Surrounding the reactor are fading bruises, Tony’s battered chest now covered in a few more scars. Steve almost drops the plate of breakfast.
Tony squirms in his seat, he needs more wine before they have this conversation. Clearing his throat, he reaches for the final oyster.
“Put any money on it?” Tony yawns, barely covering his mouth with his hand.
“I —,” he looks away from Steve, swallowing back vomit. “Pepper — is she…?”
He must have fallen asleep, because the room is dark, and Tony’s lips are pressing to his softly.
Tony falls to the dirt as Thanos pulls the blade and his hand away, the green Time stone slotting into his golden gauntlet with ease. Tony gasps, red dust coating his lips, making a sludge on his chin as it mixes with his blood.
Steve hooks his arms under Tony’s armpits and hauls him to his feet gracelessly – Tony cries out and slumps against him, nearly falling again. With a grunt, Steve has Tony in his arms, his legs dangling over Steve’s left forearm.
“I left.” Tony shrugs. “I know you guys were keeping track of me – or at least, Pepper was.” Tony doesn’t look at him, he’s giving Steve an out, a way to deny any interest in Tony’s whereabouts for the last five years. “I made those big cash withdrawals because I didn’t want you guys knowing my every move like you would if I used a card. I floated around – never stayed in one place for longer than two weeks. A lot of the time I helped with rebuilding efforts. Infrastructure’s crumbling, you know? The manual labor was good for building up muscle, and nobody asked any questions when I finally dropped the self-confident, arrogant attitude I’ve been hiding behind since I was old enough to know better.”
“But I want to talk.” Steve had to tell him now – even if it ruined things between them. Tony had kissed him, had murmured something that sounded awfully like ‘I love you’ against his chest in the darkness – and Steve could no longer keep the truth of the death of his parents from him.
One morning, Tony comes out of his room for breakfast, and he’s shaved his beard back into his usual sculpted goatee. Steve says nothing as he slides a sunny-side-up egg onto Tony’s plate.
“You’ve stopped thinking,” Steve murmurs against his skin, and Tony can feel him smile.
There’s a car waiting for him at the front of the building, and Tony dips into his moderate grasp of German to request that the driver vacate the wheel. There’s some confusion, some bickering back and forth into a walkie-talkie, and Tony speeds off while his driver-slash-captor is standing with his back to him.
“No, hear me out. You could come with me, you could be at my side. We could be a team, Steve. A real team. Captain America and Iron Man, staunch supporters of the Sokovia Accords – and then we won’t have to talk about it at all. Just…” Tony’s hands drop to his sides, and he’s pleading with Steve – a position he’s almost too proud to be in. “Take my side, for once. Trust me, believe in me, I know I’m doing the right thing for the Avengers – for us. I’ll never ask you to trust me again, Steve, I swear.” Tony smiles wryly, though it fades after a few moments. He meets Steve’s gaze. “Please. Do this for me.”
Tony blinks. He looks at Steve emptily, and Steve wants to reach out and shake him by the shoulders, but he waits.
Tony glances down at his hand, thinking it over. In another reality, he would have said yes – but perhaps in that reality, Siberia never would have happened. In that reality, maybe he and Steve would have gotten together at the start. This reality is too messy, there’s too much between them for Tony to ever imagine anything beyond what they’re doing now to work. A long distance relationship, fine. Meeting in secret, fine. But being married to Steve Rogers? Impossible.
Tony might as well lay all his cards out on the table. “No, our accommodation has been arranged,” he replies, words curt. “Christ, Steve, you cut to the chase, don’t you?”
“And then I met you – and there’s the rub – you hated me the moment you laid eyes on me. Just my luck, right? Ever since I was 15, I had the biggest fucking – infatuation, with you – I kept a fucking Captain America poster above my bed at MIT, for Christssakes.”
He spends weeks in the med bay, receives skin graft after skin graft, and barely talks. Bucky comes to visit, sometimes, just to keep him company. If they have a funeral for Tony, they don’t tell him about it – but that’s fine, he’s going to be seeing Tony again very soon. Very soon.
Steve turns on his side, dog tags sliding over the metal beads as he shifts in bed. Idly, he reaches up to hold them, the silver ring cold against the palm of his hand. He should have gotten rid of these, after Tony had told him that he wanted nothing to do with him – after Tony had made that very clear by disappearing from everyone’s lives. But, he had kept them – because when he closed his eyes, he could still picture Tony sprawled asleep naked in bed with nothing but this very same necklace on.
“Somewhere warm. By the ocean.” Tony pulls one of Steve’s pillows closer to him, breathing in deeply. With Steve’s voice in his ear and Steve’s blankets around him, it’s almost like the other man is there.
“Hey,” Tony says as they move back onto the sidewalk. “I want to ask you something.”
Steve follows after him out onto the deck, still holding the rapidly cooling plate of breakfast he had made for Tony. It’s cool outside, a breeze coming up off of the ocean, but the pool is heated. Tony stands at the foot of it, rolling his shoulders slowly. Steve reaches behind him, the deck chair giving way against his palm, and he lowers himself down onto it without taking his eyes off of Tony. Tony is still wearing the helmet, which Steve doesn’t understand – but his confusion gives way to surprise as Tony dives into the pool. He has impeccable form, and this display of athleticism is not something Steve had anticipated. Yes, Tony is in shape – in fact, he possesses the exact kind of body Steve had wanted before the serum. Not well defined musculature that required constant upkeep, but a subtle strength that came from hefting a metal suit around.
“Promise me you’ll get them back?” The heels of Tony’s shoes dangle over air, and his toes dig against the inside of them, trying to keep himself here – with Steve, not dangling over the edge of a cliff. Not dead.
“I know the lie you tell yourself,” Tony replies, “And the lie you’ve told me. But you know the truth, Steve, so say it.”
“For instance, the United Nations -.”
“Voila,” Tony says with a flourish, placing the bowl of pasta and seafood in front of Steve. “I tried to go light on the spice for the sauce, didn’t want your head to explode.”
Tony glowers at him, and then decides that consequences be damned, he needs more whiskey. Steve follows him to the kitchen, a pace behind Tony, but the closeness makes his head swim. He’s exhausted – he should have spent the night in Edinburgh, should have made Steve wait another day – oh, to make Captain America squirm and doubt himself. But Tony is too weak to allow himself that sort of empty victory – no, Tony had come running at Steve’s beck and call. Whiskey sloshes over the edge of the glass, Tony blinking down at it in bewilderment, liquid still pouring from the bottle and onto the countertop.
“You’re bleeding,” Steve glances down at the base of Tony’s throat, a few beads of blood forming on the white fabric of the bandages. Tony’s fingers twitch against his thigh, his skin hot, he wants to button up the shirt – but he also wants Steve to reach over and slowly and methodically unbutton it.
“Yeah, I’m finding it hard to get away, actually. I need a beach vacation,” Steve says dryly, watching as Tony picks up his left hand and starts to wrap it for him.
“Oh, thank you, Dr. Rogers,” Tony simpers sardonically. “Whatever would I do without you? Not conducive to healing, fuck off. I have to think, because I’m the only Avenger who has the brains to navigate a fucking… treacherous political climate – but, oh, excuse me, I forgot. You don’t want to talk about it.”
“Who did that to you?”
“You can stay with me. Of course you can stay with me, Tony.” Steve’s thumb brushes over the backs of his knuckles, feeling Tony’s grip relax, hearing him sigh quietly. “Is that alright?”
Tony shakes his head slowly, raising his hand again to rest it against Steve’s cheek.
“Good,” Steve says as he shrugs out of his shirt, the fabric fluttering to the floor. “That’s what I wanted to happen. I thought it would give you a chance to breathe.”
Somewhere off to the side, Stephen Strange is talking to the titan – bargaining for Tony’s life.
“I said I was your wife.”
“I think –…” Tony’s voice is muffled against Steve’s chest as he carries him to his motorcycle. He doesn’t cry out when Steve settles him in front of him on the seat, instead, he slumps forward over the handlebars, his blood dripping on the pavement.
Tony stands in front of the fireplace, gazing down at the flames, the smoke burning his eyes.
“But I’m his —.” Steve stops himself suddenly, he’s nothing to Tony. He could have been his husband, if the other man had allowed himself to be loved. If he had allowed himself to keep living.
“I’m not going to punch you, Tony,” Steve says, gesturing to one of the chairs. “Go on, sit down. I’ll help you unwrap your hands.”
“You want to bill me for the cottage?” Tony fixes the napkin on his lap as his main course is set in front of him – a filet of beef, roasted fall vegetables, and a nice scoop of mashed potatoes. American enough, he had figured, for Steve’s palate. “I’ll gladly pay half.”
“I don’t…” Tony swallows, looking away from him. “C’mon, Steve. Wake up.”
Steve blushes, grinning down at his plate – so, Tony plans on spending the night in a bed with him. Their conversation turns casual as they work on their dinner, they avoid the topic of the Avengers or Bucky, but Tony is eager to hear what Steve had done with his day in Paris.
“Where’s that music coming from?” Steve asks as he turns Tony around in his arms, his hands resting on Tony’s hips. Tony’s eyebrows raise as Steve starts to sway them around the one bedroom apartment.
“Okay.” Steve sits on the couch, his hand idly brushing over the soft leather. He wishes he had his shield to protect himself with – because Tony is seething, and there is something glowing in his chest.
Tony’s eyes fix on the shield now, reaching out again, crying out at the pain, his metal-encased fingers leaving scratches in the concrete as he drags himself to the shield.
Steve slips back into a light doze, grabbing at Tony’s pillow and holding it tightly, smelling the billionaire’s cologne faintly. He doesn’t stir when Tony slips back into the apartment half an hour later.
Just as Tony feared, there’s a crowd of reporters outside of the impressive glass UN building in which each nation was to ratify the Accords. His hand twitches at his side as he steps out of the car, wanting to shield his eyes from the flash of cameras.
) and presses his lips to Steve’s. Steve tenses, and Tony closes his eyes, expecting a punch that’ll take his head off of his shoulders. But then Steve’s arms wrap around him, pulling him closer, until Tony is pressed up flush against him. His lips part against Tony’s, and Tony’s hand bunches in the damp fabric of his tank top. Steve’s tongue is hot, and his body is hard and unyielding against his, and his blood tastes of iron and sweet, sweet satisfaction. Tony wants to kiss him until he can’t breathe, wants to pull him down onto the mat and…
They’ll sit at the coffee shop, and Tony will stare at him every now and again, and when Steve catches him, he’ll blush furiously. Tony will tell him what he’s working on, pulling out a mangled looking notebook from his pocket – and instead of detailed descriptions of his nightmares, as he kept in the one at his and Steve’s brownstone apartment in New York – this notebook will be filled with ideas and designs. Tony will take a big gulp of coffee, and then look Steve dead in the eyes.
“In the years I’ve known you?” Pepper cocks her head, her fingers gently trailing over the back of his hand, mindful of the IV needle. “At least twelve.”
Tony spits out his own mouth guard, panting, grabbing the Velcro of his glove between his teeth and tearing it. His boxing gloves thump against the mat, his swollen, wrapped hands clenched in trembling fists at his sides.
“We’ve contacted his next of kin,” the nurse says kindly, trying to comfort him. “Virginia Potts? She’s on her way – so he won’t be alone.”
“What floor are we going to?” Steve stares into his eyes, his hands bracing against Tony’s back, the keys cold against his hot skin. Tony swallows, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist, his fingers laced together at the nape of his neck.
“We can talk about it later,” Steve says easily – even though he knows it is anything but easy.
“It’s aloe,” Steve says in exasperation, squirting more out of the bottle onto his palm. “I burn easily, so I brought it just in case.
“I — I lost the kid,” Tony manages to hold back the sob that comes with those words, manages to stamp down the almost overwhelming grief that comes when he thinks of Peter Parker disappearing under his hand.
Steve grins, closing the sketchbook and looking over at Tony as the other man sprawls out on the deck chair.
“Well… I was thinking of jumping.” There’s the honesty Steve’s been searching for, but he knows that Steve won’t be relieved to hear it – won’t be relieved at all.
Steve blinks, and opens his mouth to apologize, but Tony cuts him off before he can.
“Tony.” Steve sits up properly, running his fingers through his hair. “Christ, Tony – Are you…”
Tony pulls his hand away from Steve’s grip, slamming the car door shut.
now blaring on the surround sound. He walks down the hall, past the door to the gym, past the door to the med bay. The stairway to the roof is hidden in the back of the compound, and he shoulders the heavy door open with a grunt. Snow had fallen a few days ago, and more is falling as he makes his way up to the roof, shivering at the chill. He takes a quick sip of vodka, the warmth spreading through his body against the snow, and he knows that as long as he has something to drink, he’ll be alright.
