He places the paint palette and the paintbrush down on a little metal tray he must have dragged into Tony’s bedroom. “The doctor said you would have periods of confusion.”
Carefully, Tony moves at the same time Steve reaches upward and then they meet with an urgency and desire neither voiced, but both understood. At first the kiss is tentative, a testing of the waters. It grows then as a slight moan slips out of Tony and that encourages Steve. He wraps his arms around Tony, shifting him fully onto his lap. All the while they never stop touching, never stop kissing. The heat roils and coils deep in Tony’s groin and just small movement sends another cry out of him. Steve answers him with a moan of his own. Emboldened, Tony reaches down and tugs Steve’s shirt so that he can run his fingers against hot skin.
“Yeah,” Clint said as he straightened up in the passenger seat. While Steve had parsed through his thoughts on Tony and vampire mating, Clint dozed next to him. “I know.”
“Where would you like me to start, sir?” Tony swore he could hear a sarcastic tone to the AI’s voice. “At the beginning?”
Steve looks up at him and his eyes are fully open, the swelling down considerably. It isn’t normal, it isn’t human. And the feeling of being out of place, out of time comes over Tony and he jitters as Steve grasps his arm.
Shaking his head, Steve went to his suitcase and pulled out his track pants and a t-shirt. Surely the hotel had somewhere to workout.  Once dressed he found the work out room tucked next to an Olympic sized pool. Steve stared at the pool for a while, thinking maybe he should just swim instead, but part of him – a quiet part that people didn’t know – hated the water. He remembered the gagging, as the ocean burst into the Valkyrie and the rush of water like a freight train slamming into him. His breath turned fluid and he drowned as the ice of the water chilled his bones. With that in mind, he went to the work out room. He couldn’t hit punching bags because he would end up paying for the ruined ones. Instead he took to the weights and began his repetitions.
He starts to walk away. He places his hand on the ornately carved door handle. “If you do see him, if you talk to him, tell him – tell him, he’s free.”
Shaking his head several times, Tony blinked and said, “I get it. I do.” He hissed. “I understand. I’ll give you some space, okay? You need space. Shuri said there are clothes in the cabinets over there.” He pointed behind Steve. “When you need me all you need to do is.” He shook his head. “Just ask someone.” He escaped before Steve could say a word.
Tony swings around and sees the fire cracking in the large hearth. This should all be romantic, but all it is – is painful. “Shouldn’t we try and get out? I mean what if there’s an emergency. We’re Avengers after all.”
Steve leads Tony into the mud room and then they enter the main kitchen. Tony knows the place like the back of his hand, he designed it. When he first purchased the land, he had one of the best architects in the business work with him on the plans. The main floor invites the occupants and visitors with its open spaces and high ceilings. Tony kept to a clean line design with modern features but also brought in the rustic feel of the Canadian wilderness, adding exposed beams and a natural stone fireplace that reaches up to the second floor. On the second floor with its open staircase and landing to the first floor, there are five bedrooms and five full baths. Each room has its own ensuite. The basement floor or really the ground floor from the street in front of the house has Tony’s workshop and a three car garage.
“The drawing. I want to do you and the scene from the back porch. You don’t have to sit on the porch, but inside in front of the sliding glass doors.” Steve waits on his response.
After quiet moments, Tony says, “I’d like you to accompany me to a luncheon tomorrow of the Conclave dignitaries. It will be a small affair. Nothing formal.”
Steve curls his lips. “Well, everything’s a little too perfect. Like hyper-realistic. They said that Pixar tried to do something like that with the animation of people. Giving them pores and fine hairs on their faces and it turned out that audiences found it really creepy.”
Denying his desires became second nature as a young man. It’s not something that’s a foreign concept to him. Being alone and on his own remains his stasis quo. He misses knowing he has someone to come home to. His Ma always worried about him.
“What are you going to do now?” Steve has to ask – his life is on the line and his wings as well. The wounds on his back pulse with a fresh ache.
He studied her. He knew there were things he could implicitly trust her with – she wouldn’t rat him out. She couldn’t because of the soul bond. “Can I tell you something?”
. It was not Soviet made, nor was it Chinese or Japanese made. It was alien, and it was a virus. The first person to be infected was Howard Stark. Officials still do not know how it spread during those first few months. It was soon discovered that the virus changed a person, transformed them into a nearly immortal being – an immortal being that fed on other humans, drinking their blood. They were called vampires for want of another term. The human population changed during those months from human to vampire, workers, and stock. Workers were humans who never changed when infected by the virus but were considered to be part of the vampire clan. Stock were those who were never infected, could not be infected for some reason and became the stock for the vampires to feed off. Some infected by the virus did not survive the transformation and died.
“And you shouldn’t.” Steve leans forward and kisses Tony’s temple. “You shouldn’t. I made my bed. I made the mistake.”
Steve halts his snow angel and gazes silently up into the cloudless sky as if he is communing with it. Abruptly then he moves, almost too quickly for Tony to track his movements. He bends over Tony and his flush cheeks and wild eyes take up his line of sight.
“You did this on purpose?” Natasha asked while Fury surveyed them, watching their reactions. Steve could have bet that the man relished the idea of this
Steve’s already nearly finished one of the sandwiches. “It’s good.” He chews around the words. “If I’m hungry I’ll have a few apples.”
“You will and you have to,” Fury says. “You know he’s holding most of the power in the Belts, hell, he’s probably got a bit of the Rims and the Outers with him as well with his humanitarian missions plastered all over the Rag-nets and Grids.”
“You like it?” Tony’s voice falls an octave and when Steve peeks his gaze over his shoulder to look at Tony, he spies the heated want in Tony’s expression.
When he walked out of the bathroom with the glass in hand, Tony said, “I think we need to cool it a bit. I’m drinking too much.”
“And you are in trouble,” Tony says and crawls up the piano. The dissonant notes sound as he brutally ignores his treatment of the instrument. He shoves Steve up onto the piano proper. “I think I need better access.”
“Yes, it is. I ordered JARVIS to prepare it that way,” Natasha said. “Now, eat as I set this up.” She picked up a blood bag on the tray with an intravenous line.
“Let me raise the bed and I’ll get you some with some crackers.” She pauses and then asks, “Are you nauseous or anything?”
Bruce looks like he just rolled out of bed and Tony’s strained tone doesn’t move him at all. “It’s nothing bad. Steve’s still in stable condition last I checked.”
The vampire – a female – eyed Ross and then looked up at Steve. Her eyes were deep motes and her fangs were long – longer than Tony’s. Her pale face was gaunt and hollow – they had starved her. He closed his eyes and turned his head as much as he could as she went back to feeding. In his mind, he reached out to Tony, knowing he could hear him. Odd sensations crept over his skin as the vampire touched him, as she began to stroke him as she drank. He squeezed his eyelids and bit down on the gag. He didn’t want to come.
Sam had a point. A very definite, important point. Tony sacrificed, he tried. Steve needed to recognize his willingness to lay down on the wire. He shifted in the bed again, but it hurt so he stopped. “That’s one way to look at it.”
“Thought I’d help you undress,” Steve says and unties Tony’s left shoe and then his right shoe. Tony’s perfectly capable of disrobing on his own, but the idea of Steve peeling off his clothes, of touching him sets him on fire. Steve telegraphs every motion, every touch. It takes away none of the anticipation or thrill, only builds on it. He slips off each shoe and then runs his long fingers up Tony’s ankle to slide off each sock. In a slight surprise Steve kisses the inside of Tony’s ankles before rising to his feet and putting his hands on his shirt, unbuttoning it.
“What you had within that other life, isn’t yours. Not anymore.” Logan faces him then, his eyes piercing and brutal. “We had something. We had something based reality. Our reality.”
“A bully stick,” he stops. It’s official name is shock rod. Bully stick is what’s used on Brooklyn. “Shock rod. Impact on my calf, lower back, and abdomen. It’s not bad. Tony brought me back to his quarters had me take a bath and is feeding me electrolytes and other stuff.” He picks up one of the electrolyte drinks.
When it opens the burst of light is the first thing Steve takes in. He gasps a little. The corner art room is lined with windows. All the natural light he could ever ask for and more. It’s absolutely beautiful. “Wow, I just-.” He can’t speak.
“He’s not like that,” Tony said. He crossed his arms, closing her off, shutting down the conversation. “You don’t know him like I do.”
Tony shifted some of the glass shards with his shoe toe. He really should call maintenance to come and clean up this mess and to haul the destroyed centrifuge away. “Karma?”
“Howard – well, let’s just say, he kind of – he propositioned me.” Steve’s cheeks turn bright red and it’s not from the heat of the fire.
Steve bobs his head. “Yeah. I do. Buc-. My friends would say that but not using that term. I think that’s a new term.”
It’s small only a couple of meters wide and the same in length. The stench burns his nostrils and makes his eyes tear. Huddled in the corner, he glimpses a figure – collapsed and broken. He can’t make out any details because the faint blue light in the room is too dim. Redwing tweets in his ear and he hops down. He supposes that the blue light is some kind of surveillance or camera. It’s not going to stop him.
Steve hesitates only a second, before he follows the request. He hits the light switch at the entrance and turns on the lamps on the nightstands as well as the floor lamp in the sitting area near the couch where Steve slept. He stands next to the unlit stone fireplace and waits as Tony makes his way out of the bed and surveys the room; his mouth slightly open. Usually when Tony wears the glasses in public, he also wears contacts that link with the glasses to give the illusion that his eyes see. It’s disconcerting to have him walking around the suite, scanning the room with sightless eyes.
He doesn’t expect Tony to answer him. He climbs up and digs through the saddlebags on Tony’s horse. He has to have something, some device to shock him. His hand hits on something metal. Digging it out of the bag, he pulls it out and identifies it as some kind of battery.
"Come to dinner, at my house?" Tony says and there's a glint of play in his eyes. "Maybe, maybe my house would be a good place for us to meet, Captain. But you didn't come here for dinner, you didn't come here for a drink. What did you come here for?"
“I’m fine. A little mortified that I couldn’t keep us on our feet, but otherwise just a little wounded pride.”
“Neither can I,” Tony said and they both exited the elevator. Tony glanced around the corridor of the hospital. It had quieted in the short time Tony had been gone, and Clint waved for him to follow. Since Tony had no idea where Steve might be now, he said nothing and allowed Clint to lead.
It took some haranguing with Strange, but Steve finally scheduled a visit with Wong. He would come over to the Tower and meet with the entire pack, help them work through the issues, and possibly give guidance to the next steps. He also needed to confront Tony again. He knew the next day that it wouldn’t be enough time to process everything that had happened. From being added to a pack without his consent to having learned his parents’ death wasn’t an accident the last few weeks had been a roller coaster ride. Worse than Coney Island as far as Steve was concerned.
He steps away from her as she slips on her glasses. “I don’t need anyone. I have  Jamison and Harry.” He knows he needs an omega; he won’t be permitted to take the High Alpha Chair without one. He won’t be part of the Council if he doesn’t have an Omega warrior. The warrior is not only a status symbol but a shield against any threats or challenges to his status as the Lord of the Stark Family. “I could use an android.”
“The rarity of the condition and the overall anatomical changes does make this a difficult case. We had hoped that the serum would step up and heal the uteri but it doesn’t seem to be happening. We’ll have to operate and remove them.”
Steve unlocks the door and pushes it open. Tony hears him switch on the light and then he instructs, “Walk about three paces forward and two your left and you’ll get to a table to put the milkshakes on.”
Adonis scans the area as if he’s looking for mentioned date, furrows his brows, and then purses his lips. He’s pretty. Too pretty for Tony. He doesn’t want this kind of beauty around him. Not now. Not anymore.  He snaps at the man. “Don’t you own a suit?”
That was a bit of new knowledge that Steve hadn’t heard. As they walked into the wide open living space of the house with its vaulted beamed ceilings and tinted windows for ages along the back side, Steve searched around for the missing vampires. “Where are Bruce and Thor?”
“When you really want to date him. Well, you’re a terrible liar, so you’re going to have to get over it and deal. Or confess to him that to you it’s a real date,” Sam says.
“Though you know who he is as well,” Tony says to Frigga. He steps in front of Natasha as if to protect her.
“It’s okay to share it, Steve. We’re here for you,” Tony murmured. Steve didn’t reply, not verbally, but the wall he’d constructed between himself and the rest of the pack disintegrated and the flood of pain and loss hit Tony. He gripped onto Steve. “That’s it. We’re here for you.” His voice sounded strange, off, as if he listened to it from very far away.
He comforts him and looks to see Sam with Redwing and Clint to the side, silently watching over them, sentinels against the darkness.
Tony drops to the side and covers his face with his hands. He’s not the type to complain or show outward signs of pain. It alarms Steve.
It’s there. All they need do is leap, enter the Hub and then find the exit Door. The worm will do the rest. They’ve destroyed the rest of the world. There’s nothing left to this reality then the Hub – which is the most dangerous place of all.
In front of him a holographic display of the prince’s schedule appears. A quick review of it reveals that the schedule leaves the prince with little time to himself or even to eat properly. Steve grumbles and crosses his arms over his chest.
“Entanglement, quantum entanglement,” Tony says. Of course, it makes perfect sense, in a weird physics kind of way.
"Christ, it's your dick. You're staying here for a hot piece of ass."  Obie swears again before adding, "I don't care where you put your prick, Tony, but you have fucking responsibilities." He stops to visibly hold back his tirade. Inhaling and then expelling it, Obie says, "You gotta know I have your best interests at heart. Come back to California. Bring the hot piece of ass with you. I don't care. Just get on track, my boy."
“You could,” Steven says and his gaze doesn’t waver and shy away from the defiance just lurking in the shadows. He stays on his knees as protocol states, but there’s a fire in him that burns the room to ashes.
“Not the kind you think. We’re going to an island in the Northern Atlantic. It’s not all that warm there.”
Steve eyes the big man and Luke raises his hands in surrender. “Fine, as long as he doesn’t start talking about switching again.”
Using the skinner, he works it under the flesh and flays it away. He’s not careful about it. His skin will grow back. The serum will take care of it. He’s sure. This is where it gets dicey. Tossing the skin in the sink as he works, he bites back the pain. He gulps down the rising nausea and pushes the gland out from under the tissues. It isn’t swollen. It is about the size of a plum with a root near the apex of his shoulder. As he pulls it out so that he can make the cut, his vision darkens if only for a moment. He has to close his eyes as the room loops around from his lightheadedness. He’s not bleeding that much but fussing with the gland might be causing it. He really doesn’t know.
“Steven,” Natalie repeats and then considers him. “There was Steven of the Carbonelli Family, I recall. He was the omega involved in the Uprising. He was commanded by his Alpha to infiltrate the Omega Uprising.”
“Where would you like to go first,” Steve says, and he tries to stay chipper about it. As he glances around the wooded island, he admits to himself that he loves the peace and solitude, so different from the fast pace of the city. He barely ever got a chance to hike and hang out in the woods as a child.
Steve adjusts his shoulders, standing straighter. He enters the vestibule that looks like something out of a palace instead of a spaceship.  Happy doesn’t follow, just folds his hands in front of him and says, “Go on through to the main room. He’ll be waiting and don’t mind the mess.”
He dropped the papers and marched off. He went to his penthouse apartment and went directly to his bedroom, but he stopped at the doorway. The bed was still rumpled from the night before – the staff hadn’t had a chance to straighten it up yet. A lingering scent of musk hung in the air and the reality of his dream wrapped around him. But it wasn’t real, not at all.
Steve screwed up his face and Tony wondered whether or not the remark about Clint as Natasha’s mate might have something to do with his pensive mood. Whatever the deal with Clint and Natasha, Tony didn’t want it to influence his relationship with Steve. He’d already broken one of the coven’s unspoken rules by falling in love with his mate. Digging into Natasha’s business would get him thrown out of the coven or, worse, sent to stasis like Loki. Inwardly, a shiver ran through him. He never wanted that to happen to him.
“You think that sweet ass of Stark’s could be yours?” Bucky snickers. “He would eat you alive. You got nothing but a few dark alley hook ups and quick one nighters. You think he wants someone as inexperienced or as filthy as you?”
Three days after they dragged Steve off into the unknown, they hauled him back. Tony tries not to think about all the various wounds and bruises all over the man’s body. He looks like they strung him up and used him as a slab of meat for a butcher to practice on. He’s barely breathing when Raza’s thugs drop him on the cot and mutter something at Tony.
Steve smiles. “I did put a few things on my application about politics and the Inner Regions. So maybe-.”
Somehow Steve relents and he says, “She was a nurse. My dad died when I was very young. She died when I was eighteen. Seems like yesterday. But it was forever ago.”
Tony stiffens and glares at Steven. The gall and the impudence astonishes Tony. “What the hell? Get your hand off of my bourbon.”
“We actually didn’t expect it,” one of the clinicians said but shut up again when Ross side-eyed him.
“Shit,” he curses and drops the battery. Again he tries as he listens to Tony heave in a breath and then shake as he exhales it out. The tears fog his sight and he murmurs, “I’m trying, please God I am trying.”
Tony claps at Steve enthusiasm and follows his wish. As Steve splashes around in the peaks of bubbles, Tony cannot help but think of Blu playing in the water with him. They would often go down to the stream during the height of the day when the heat slowed them down. There in the small stream they found relief and lost themselves, splashing and soaking one another fully. Surely, Blu hated to go into the water most of the time, but on those days, he enjoyed himself. His attention draws to Steve, in the bath totally free of expectations. He’s more restricted in his attitude and actions than Blu, but here in the tub he finds the joy in life. When he spots Tony watching him, he smiles, and Tony’s done for. That smile, those eyes melt into Tony thoroughly.
Tony notices that one of the doctor trails behind him, but he doesn’t decrease his pace. Tony sweeps into the ICU room, startling the nurse who sits at a small console monitoring Steve’s vital signs. She has a small kindle in her hand, and Tony nearly barks at her. She swiftly pockets the kindle in her white coat. He says nothing but goes to Steve’s bedside.
Even under the stream of warm water, Steve shivers. He doesn’t trust Stane. He never will. The thought that Stane might have the right idea to end the war seems ludicrous and erroneous. Stane isn’t the kind of guy who looks out for others’ welfare at the expense of his own. On the contrary, he would shove a baby out an airlock to save himself in an instant. Steve’s sure of it. Finding out what Stane is planning becomes a singular focus for Steve. He finishes his shower, feeling more centered and focused. If he finds out what’s going on, protects Tony, then he’s sure he can extend that to recovering Bucky. He does not at any second (or so he tells himself) think of the possibility that recovering Bucky isn’t an option. Steve might not be able to rescue him, but there must be a reason he’s working for the prince right now. His mother would agree.
He watched the movie, riveted by it, and confused. How could they possibly use dream technology (that didn’t even exist) to ever interrogate Ultron’s mind. Later Tony explained it to him.
His room is spartan but pleasant. The bed looks cozy with plush pillows and a deep gray comforter. Attached to the room is a bathroom – his own bathroom that he doesn’t have to share with the rest of the tenement. There’s a white bureau and a closet. He stuffs his duffle in the closet and sees clothes hanging on the rods.
He's not sure what she means and knows he's too far in over his head to argue, so he takes Steve by the shirt and drags him along. If he is the original Captain America then what just happened to him must have jarred him royally. He's not functioning on all cylinders. But Steve follows him and when Tony chances a backward glance he finds Steve trying to mentally catch up. There’s a lost look in his eyes, and it recalls images of Steve as a young man, thin, sickly – Tony saw those photographs. He knows them as the beat of his heart.
“Hmm?” He tries to clear his head but the fog has settled all around the edges. He’d thought someone else was here, someone he didn’t know. He takes the cup and drinks; he feels parched, dry like the desert sands.
“I thought you might be hungry. I have some work to do. So why don’t you watch the stream while I work.”  He points to the console and then nods as he looks Steve up and down. Steve’s still dressed but he did leave the robe in the bathroom.
Tony ignores the first and focuses entirely on the last part of that sentence. “Your observation skills suck for someone with 20:20 vision.”
“Hi – sorry is this Darling?” There’s a delay with the words and it sounds distant, like someone might be on a speaker phone.
“How do you know the Starks?” Pym settles back in his chair and Janet grimaces at him. “What? You want to know, too.”
“Yeah,” Steve said and sniffled as he looked at the brand on Bucky’s flesh. “Sorry, I-.” He hissed. “Nat keeps telling me to not apologize, but I feel like I should every time it happens without the other person’s consent.”
Natasha nodded and stood at ease. Somedays Steve felt like an observer of his own life and everyone else had more interesting parts, at least when it came to Natasha and Fury who seemed to hatch a plan without speaking to one another.
“Okay. Sure.” Though Steve doesn’t want to leave Tony, it’s the best solution. He’s the only one that knows the important files. “I’m going to leave for a little bit, Tony.” He touches his face, hoping that Tony’s focusing on him. “Pietro is here to keep you company.”
Tony pushes Steve away and scrambles out of bed. “No, do not say it’s me, do not go there.” He shivers as if the repugnance he feels is a physical thing. “I get it, I understand. I’m a worthless asshole. You know the whole of my story I would assume. I get it.” Tony separates himself, walking the distance to the doors, picking up his clothes as he attempts to exit.
“Does intimate mean like – what I think it does?” Because he really couldn’t consider the thought of having sex with Bruce or maybe the Hulk – that terrified him.
“Then tell me how you got involved with the V-Corps?” Tony had asked as Steve tentatively picked up a fork and stabbed the steak.
Jane stands up and takes his hand. “You’ll never forget her, Steve. But that doesn’t mean you can’t move on.”
“All sides. The perimeter’s been breached and we are surrounded. I’m trying to get our helicopter to the pad, but I doubt it will get out of the garage without them shooting it down.” Tony shook under Steve’s hands. “It’s dawn, Steve. Dawn.”
“Hell, where would you all be if I didn’t? My fortune supplies this place and the coven. Without Pepper, we’d have nothing,” Tony spat back.
Heat warms Steve’s cheeks but he ignores it and walks into the welcome the prince. “I thought you might like to forget your troubles for the day. Considering you’re trying to save humanity; I think a nice dinner with ambience is a small reward for your troubles.”
When he asked what else happened, her face paled and she shifted her gaze away from him to the floor. “You don’t want to know, Sentinel. There’s been a lot of things I’ve done in my life, a lot of red in my ledger, but that – what he was doing to your Jedi it shouldn’t be done to anyone.”
“So that’s it,” Steve says. “You come, check him over with a stethoscope or whatever, and suddenly we’re on our way back to New York? That’s it?”
“I have an appointment with Strange next week. If we hire this guy Steve, he can take me – hear all the horror stories of what happened. It will be a good learning experience for him,” Tony says. He shifts the glasses to shades, darkening with the lenses with just one quick shift of his eyes. “You go. You have things to do. I’m going to sit here and check out the files on the good Captain.” He takes the tablet from her.
Tony should take solace in these words. Steven is committed. He doesn’t seem as if he’s willing to shun his duty or even do a poor job. His caring touch says things to him that Tony must be misinterpreting. Steven leads Tony out of the shower and wraps in him a towel. Leading him out of the bathroom, Steven brings him to the bed. He dries Tony and then pulls down the linens. With a gentle touch, Steven gets Tony to lie down and he tucks the blankets around him.
“You?” He’s not of two minds, now. He wants to beat the omega into submission. He would have him right in the middle of the conference room to show the omega that it is not his place to decide for his
“God, don’t say that. Just don’t say that.” Bucky turned away from Tony. He grabbed at the single window near the sofa. His hand opened and closed on the sill. “Steve’s a good guy, you know. He’s always fought for the underdog. Always cared about everyone, even Arnie-.” He stopped. “Oh! Jesus, Mary, and Joseph.” He shuttered his eyes. “Of course. Yeah, yeah.” He didn’t explain his thought processing, but Tony remained still, frightened that whatever breakthrough they might have achieve would be washed away if he interfered.
Steven had shrugged. “It wouldn’t be the first time that society made decisions based on biology. Women have been subjugated for centuries because they are the ones to have children. I never liked it. I never will. I don’t like being bullied. I don’t like bullies.”
“But I left you behind,” Tony weeps. The words come out garbled, but it doesn’t matter – there’s no one here to hear them. Tony’s always alone. Alone with his billions. How does it feel to be a billionaire? Money can buy yachts and mansion and the best of everything, but it can’t buy him what he needs.
Steve pushed back into the cushion of the seat. “I don’t know, I think we’re not utilizing the pack the way we should. We’re the Avengers and we’re not even a real team. Haven’t been since the Chitauri invaded.”
Sawyer smiled. “I’d love to get out of here for more than a few weeks at a time. Hard to live here without family 24/7. Specimen 18704 isn’t all that much company, you know.”
“We didn’t even- it wasn’t romantic or tender. I wanted to show you how much you mean to me,” Steve buries his head at Tony’s neck. “You were all I thought of, all I hoped for. You were my world in that cave, by the stream. And look how I treated you.”
Steve rubs his hand up and down his back as Tony shudders. He almost fell. Into the sea. Blind. He almost fell. The air thins and he tenses. It’s always been a secret terror, something he keeps hidden away, buried deep and dark inside the recesses of his consciousness. It is his consciousness and not his subconsciousness. He knows the terror of not being able to do something for himself – like crossing a street, or finding the strawberries in a grocery store, or being able to tune his speakers in the lab. Having his sight robbed from him by a freak accident caused by his father twisted his consciousness so he is always prepared, always ready for the unknown, the unseen. Yet, here he is nearly toppling off a pier into the icy waters of the Labrador Sea.
“Generally that means I’m going to be going on some kind of mission that will get my ass kicked and several of my team members will be doing their own mission. I’ll have to say no thank you.”
There are doctors and nurses around him then, trying to stop the anxiety, the panic from overwhelming him. He keeps asking for help, but not for himself. He needs to save Bucky, and he needs to beseech Tony. He doesn’t want them to hurt one another. Not because of him. Not because of the evil that Bucky had to do, that he was compelled to do. Something must be injected into the port in the intravenous line because he feels a burning through his veins and then he fades away. It shouldn’t be so easy to knock him out, but he sees it coming and he succumbs.
“No, of course not,” Steve says and slides his gaze to Pepper for a moment. It turns over in his gut; he knows it’s wrong to consider the father and son as one and he’s ashamed of his reaction. The fact remains though that he tastes bile in the back of his mouth and cannot trust himself.
“Seems they have a story about a bomb and their parents and Stark Industries.” Natasha had placed a hand on Bucky’s shoulder as she shifted out of his touch.
He flops over and crawls up to the pillows. Tony doesn’t deny there are tears in his eyes. The stress. He blames it on all of the stress. The tears turn into true weeping, but it’s quiet and dignified – if crying can ever be dignified. Why can’t he let himself love? Why did he keep Steve at arm’s length while all the time flirting and playing with him? How come he didn’t know his time with Steve might be abruptly cut off.
“Buck,” Steve says and goes to his side. He squeezes his shoulder and sees a fogged, nearly dazed look haunts his expression, his eyes. “Hey, you gotta rest.”
Bruce stands next to his bed, his huge form casting a shadow over the room. “It’s okay Tony. You’re going to be okay.”
“Fuck. Do it!” His own cock drips. He’s always been a messy lover; it’s something that his clients have loved because he’s so very responsive but this – this gush of pre-come is for Tony only. He’s never been this needy, this wanting.
He installed a laboratory in several of his safe houses and Bruce routinely stayed there. He never ventured to the city unless he needed to, and Tony wondered what drew him in this time. As they made their way down the quiet roads, Tony asked, “Came to the city, huh?”
“Here we go, Barton.” Tony snorts. “Watch this.” He lets loose the arrow and it hits its target with the thud – dead center. Steve frowns. He’s never seen Tony do that before and he’s watched the man play darts enough.
“I’m not sure what you mean,” Tony said. He took Steven seriously. He knew enough of the omega to listen and to assess what he said as the truth – as the omega saw it.
Stark winks at him again. “Oh, but you did, didn’t you? You thought you would be the one conducting the interrogation.”
“What if they strip search you?” Tony got out of bed and petted the bruise. “I could try and lick it more?”
Steve turned to Tony and slipped his hand up against his neck. Tony wanted to lean into it but stopped himself. “It means that we’re closer together, more the same.”
“Oh, you need to move aside. Seriously, all of you need to give the poor man room to breathe. You may not need to breathe, but he does.” As the group of Divini and vampire moved from the bed, a young teenaged girl with her dark hair done in braids on either side of her head greeted Steve. “How is my patient today?”
Steven tilts his head and narrows his eyes as if he’s staring into a microscope and can see the finest details of Tony’s thoughts. “Maybe.”
“It’s more complicated than that, you know,” Frigga informs them. “What you have between the two of you is something akin to what Heimdall has for all the living beings of the universe except on a much smaller scale. You have to be able to know without a doubt that you can reach out to the other and firmly place yourself at his side. Is that possible?”
“Bucky?” He wanted to ask what had happened. How it had happened, but the look of absolute disdain on his friend’s face stopped him. “What’s goin-.”
“Well, why don’t you ask him. Spend time with him, Tony. I’ve noticed you hanging out here too often lately. You usually avoid this place like the plague. Maybe you should go back to that and spend time with your new husband.” She stands next to him. The lights from the parking lot below glitter in her eyes. It reminds him of the cosmos, of Steve.
“Just-.” Tony put a hand to his forehead and then closed his eyes only briefly. When he looked up at Steve all friendliness (however small) had disappeared replaced by unbridled loathing. “Just go to DC and make friends with those – those spineless bureaucrats like my father.” He huffed and looked up and down at Steve. “Captain America, huh. I thought you would be taller.” He marched out of the door, slamming it closed.
“Why? What’s going on?” From what Tony said it hadn’t been that long, they could still salvage the situation. “Steve? Stop pacing and tell me what’s going on?
Once they land everything becomes a whirlwind of activity. Pepper and Happy, along with an ambulance, greets them on the tarmac. There’s not a lot Steve’s allowed to do, he’s almost pushed aside as the professionals and Pepper take over. Steve watches from the sidelines in a kind of horrified miasma. Tony keeps searching for something, and Pepper only leads him away from the jet, makes him get on the gurney. Tony’s troubled and his eyes glisten with tears. Pepper shoots Steve a glare and he can’t parse why or what the issue is, so he runs up to help and she stands in his way.
Steve bows his head and presses his lips together in a tight line. After a moment he nods. “Yeah I get it. I understand. I owe a lot to my friends. My Ma died when I was in college and I didn’t have much. No one tried to kill me – well, not outside the Army anyhow. But they’ve been there for me. All the way.”
As soon as Steve was able to, he contacted Strange and asked if it would be possible for Wong to come to the Tower. The situation couldn’t be ignored anymore and needed to take front and center stage.
“Think about coffee, Stark,” he mutters and starts downstairs with his mug in hand. The aroma of the coffee, eggs, and bacon mix and cause his stomach to protest in a loud growl as he walks over to the dining nook.
“Nothing to be sorry for,” Tony waves her off and sighs when he hears the click of her shoes on the linoleum floor. “Christ this is going to be hard.”
He picks one on the other side of the couch. He figures it’s not an outright rejection but it’s not an invitation either. His father always called him a coward. “How about – maybe a World War II movie. You might relate to that -.”
“Nothing. Just-.” He can’t lie to her. He never could. “Just wondering if Ross is going to demand something more.”
He glances down at his hands; the simple band is on his ring finger. He touches it, spinning it on his finger. “I didn’t mean for it to be real.”
Tony attempted to touch them, to stop them, but none of his actions registered. The agents efficiently did their job. They put a wooden stake into his open jaw and then strapped his mouth closed with a quick snap gag over the small stake. They had to be careful not to disturb the rotting flesh. One of the agents cursed as pieces of Tony’s face slipped away. Tony only closed his eyes. He didn’t want to see this, but with every touch and every moment, everything that the agents did to him – he could feel and experience. The taste of poison in his mouth choked him.
“Director Coulson, Phil, can take care of it. You know, numbers give that guy a hard on. Just imagine what a shitload of diplomats at a Peace Conference would do to him-.”
Tony stood there frozen with the possibilities. He looked down at his chest where the iron rod had pierced him and all he saw now was a shining disc. He lifted his hand and touched it. It felt neither hot or cold, though it almost had a bluish sheen to it – a cold fire in his chest. He opened the palms of his hands and small discs were there too with the same ethereal glow. What had happened to him? This transformation of his vampire abilities should terrify him, but it only set off new questions in his scientific brain. Thor controlled the atmosphere, Natasha slipped through dimensions, and now, he could summon energy.
“Sam is still in DC. That leaves you, Bruce, and me.” Steve bit back words. Tony saw him weighing whether or not to say them out loud.
Tony shares his thoughts and aspirations only with JARVIS, who is only his AI, an alter-ego and therefore bound by his personal laws and dictates of his code. His confession doesn’t extend to Rhodey nor does it extend as far as Pepper. He keeps his plans an unspoken truth. He works tirelessly in his workshop to repair his armor and to hunt down any information of a lion in the far reaches of Afghanistan. It takes weeks, weeks after Tony’s already destroyed Stane and his nefarious plans. Throughout the time, Tony works – regardless of how tired or weak he feels. He finds a way to replace the palladium more for the sake of his larger project – the one he vowed to do – than to save himself. It takes far longer than Tony hopes. But finally, there’s a bit of hope.
He scrubs away the fatigue or tries. When he was in the army, he spent many hours on watch sleep deprived. He’s gotten soft in the area of sleep. Of course, the idea of sleeping with Tony hasn’t crossed his mind – or at least he’s denied the idea. Just holding Tony yesterday after he nearly slipped off the dock sent a thrill through him that still causes a coil deep in his groin and he has to turn the water to cold to stop from fantasizing about his boss.
How much longer, Tony wants to say. Both Bucky and Sam are looking at Bruce and then at each other. They’re worried as well. Tony closes his eyes and tries to remember the brush of Steve’s hand on his jaw, the quiet moment in the wooded area they had before Steve left on his mission. Steve hadn’t even flinched at the scarring on Tony’s face. He’d touched him tenderly and with purpose. The moment Tony nearly died had been the moment he had been reborn.
Tony gazes at the man, studies him. He reaches out with his bare hand, cupping the man’s jaw, his cheek. He sees it in his eyes; he knows those eyes anywhere. “Blu?”
Tony tries not to think about losing this one strong and fierce link. Aunt Peggy has always been the bedrock of his foundation. When he enters the living room she's sitting at an ancient roll top desk but instead of letters on paper there's a small laptop blinking with its blue light.
Storm clouds filled with malice and hatred infiltrating his consciousness. His tenuous mental grip on Tony, bonded through their new link, slipped, faltered, and then snapped. Ultron swept in like a hurricane, destroying everything, beyond that, Steve remembered nothing. Something deep in his bones echoes with pain, reverberates with a secret, a prison in which he’d been trapped.
Steve doesn’t tear his hand away but he shakes his head. “No, Tony, it isn’t going to be okay. I was serious when I said you should have left well enough alone.” He looks out into the twilight as the sun dips down in the sky and the deep night creeps down like a veiling shadow.
“Burgers?” Steve asked and fumbled his way to one of the white couches even though he looked supremely uncomfortable with his straight back and his rigid posture.
When he wakes from the dreams, the dreams of hell and nightmares of a recalled heaven, he feels the soft comfort of cushions instead of stone beneath his head. He groans as he moves, because with awareness comes pain, the agony has not left him. He claws at the linens beneath him and wonders where he might be – but the misery, the ache and burn, the lash of pain stays and his brain cycles around it. He cannot escape it.
He needs to focus on his work; the Peace Conference opens in three standard days. The attendees are already arriving and his plate is full ensuring their security and evaluating what will be the best way to get these disparate fractions talking to one another. Loosely tied together colonies and systems hasn’t worked. Steve’s spent an inordinate amount of time reading over the earliest and ancient histories of the revolutions on Earth. Trying to understand the psychology of the human race seems pointless and futile at times.
They rolled his body to a pair of clinicians who checked the state of decomposition. “Very nearly complete,” One of them said – he was tall, bald, and peckish looking. With gloves on he moved Tony’s head and lifted up the jaw to examine the neck and what was left of Tony’s inner organs. “Glands are atrophied. Not sure we will get the response we need.”
He startled and grumbled at JARVIS. Sometimes he really wished to be alone. “If this is you asking what’s wrong, JARVIS, I don’t want to hear it.”
Tony breaks away first and his hand cups Steve’s cheek. “I cannot tell you how many times I cursed you. I can’t tell you because I don’t think anyone can count that high.” His breath comes in pants and he shivers against Steve. “But the truth – the truth is always how much you disturbed something – some equilibrium I’d built around my soul. I believed I had to live with walls. Even with Pepper I built them. But you- damn you – you always torn them down.”
Steve cleared his throat and persisted. “It hasn’t. Like you said, we don’t know if an urgency cycle is what’s happening. But I think I would be the best candidate to help him. With the serum I can withstand-”
“What? Steve, what are you doing?” Tony asks and jerks his hand away from him. “Stop messing around.”
Nat pops up on her toes and eyes Tony with a look of disgust. But she offers Steve a quick peck on his cheek and then disappears back into her apartment. Steve waits a few moments before he turns to face Tony as if he has to put on his stage face.
“I’m asking you to be Captain America,” Peggy said. The profundity in her words stretched out, encompassing them in the dim bedroom. “So many have lost their way. Your country is lost to us. Right now, it’s gone. There’s martial law being declared. Vampires are being rounded up. If we don’t do something the American dream, your dream, dies, Steve. I’m not asking for just us. I’m asking you to fight for the soul of your country.”
“The base is actually a fortress,” Natasha said as she pointed to it on the map. “Might have more than just low-tech defenses.”
“Yeah, I think we might have tried a little before, you know.” Steve leaned closer, his lips only inches from Tony’s mouth. “Maybe this time doesn’t have to be so rushed.”
When he left the room he collided with Natasha and Sam who stood at the entrance like guardians. Before they said a word, he raised his hand and shook his head. He stepped around them without uttering a word of explanation. He didn’t have anything to say. He had no lengthy words to give them that would clarify his actions – at this point his own need to flee confounded him as well.
They fly then. They fly far and wide and escape the lights, the sounds, the chaos of the city and their lives. They fly away.
Tony keeps his eyes trained on the road as he navigates the car through the narrow streets of Bayonne. “That was not something you consented to, no. You really want me to believe you consented to being garroted?”
“No,” Tony said, his voice firm. Steve swallowed down his fear, his uncertainty. “No, you don’t get to do that if I don’t. Neither of us is to blame. Those fuckers are!” Tony had pulled away as he spoke. “What they did, we can’t let it defeat us. We can’t let them defeat us. We don’t have much to work with here, I know, but if we give up, if we surrender.”
Steve doesn’t look at Tony as he places the k-cup in the machine. “We’re working on a project together. He’s part of the Avengers, though he’s only part time.”
“We’re in the lanes of the system. We should drop from hyper-scape by this evening. Drifts will be in three days, tops.”
“He would be the Lead in need of training,” Doctor Strange answered while Fury rounded his desk. Strange ignored Fury and instead focused on Steve. “Captain Rogers, you will be pleased to know that we will be lending out Wong’s services in order to train you in the ways of the -.”
Tony adds, “This is Captain Steve Rogers. He’s a member of the Army and Colonel Rhodes is here to clear him to leave with his husband. Isn’t that right, Colonel Rhodes.”
A tugging on shirt drew his attention away from his mental spiral and he dropped his hands from his face to look at Pepper. She had her hand clasped over her mouth and she pointed to the observation window. Tears welled in her eyes. At first, he didn’t know what to say – yes it was terrible. Yes, these men were guilty of dehumanizing a person – a man. Probably someone that Stane or his father found on the street, lured away from their homelessness with the promise of a warm bed and a cup of hot coffee.
Steve negates that immediately. “No. Ultron thinks you’re inferior to him. So, if he wants to be human, he has to shrink down his abilities to multi-task. It’s the only way to become more human. Otherwise he’s always confined to being an AI.”
“Bonded? The the infamous An’Tony Stark bonded?” That came from behind him and he finds An’Furin shaking his bald head and clapping his hands. In his one eye socket is a computer uplink to the Viz-nets that he had implanted when he lost his eye in combat. It’s disturbing but Tony imagined useful.
“Nope, because I’m not dead.” Tony smiles but the ache in his chest probably turns it into more of a wince if looking at Steve is any indication. “No, really, I’m good.”
After, he’d spent the next hour in the bathroom puking and crying. Fury had found him. Steve had never been so ashamed. He had been Captain America, fought in World War II, saw the worst that humans could do to one another, but still to wake up in a new century only to see it had turned and decayed into something horrific after all he fought for and hoped for all those years ago. Fury waited for him to clean up and then half sitting on the edge of the sink, told him that things could be different. The V-Corps could be something different; it needed to transform. They needed leadership like Steve, someone with integrity, morals, and the ability to inspire. That was Captain America, Fury insisted. Steve complied, but within a week he lost all hope and ended up giving himself over to a Blood Den, hoping to die. But he didn’t – Tony happened, Tony saved his life.
Tony chuckles. “Don’t worry about it. I can find stuff on my own, you know. It’s just a little messier sometimes.” He touches the tray. “But could you move it away. Maybe onto the side table or something?”
Steve takes the box with trembling hands. Tony ignores how much his hands shake as he opens the box. It’s what he feared. A bonding collar. Steve has others – or had – from Tony. But this one, this one is gorgeous. Tony spared no expense. The center jewel setting looks exactly like the arc reactor once embedded in Tony’s chest. It’s a sapphire. The Asscher cut black onyx gems line the collar made of vibranium. Steve knows that metal with his eyes closed.
Steve shuffles quietly to the side. He sees a big bald man with a thick beard projected in front of the prince.
Tony presses a hand to his upper arm. “I think I understand. Now, you were part of a tour, Captain America tour, right?”
Eating at a dining room table that looked like it might have been forged by giants since it sat twelve, Steve found himself enjoying the dinner. That hollow empty abyss stayed closed inside of him, smaller and contained. Tony clutched his hand every now and again as if to check in with him and ask him if he was okay.
Maybe that someone he searched for during those last moments before he fell to Earth had been Pepper. Hadn’t JARVIS asked him if he wanted to call Pepper, to say goodbye? But even as he considered it, even as he closed his eyes as he saw the flashes of gold stretching out into the abyss, he knew it hadn’t been Pepper. It would never be Pepper, no matter how hard he tried and how hard he hoped. He hadn’t landed on where he was supposed to be. He fell to the Earth and cracked the foundation of himself. His soul, his energy, his astral projection, failed. There was something wrong with him. Even if it was possible, he would never be able to bond with Pepper.
The reality of his own yearnings, the deprivation he’d subjected himself to all the years of his life. Tony Stark became the center of his life. And now, Tony’s there, in his mind, drinking from the well of knowledge. Steve’s bare naked in the woods, helpless and afraid. Tony can cut him down, remove all hope and devastate him from the inside. Forgotten is the pain of his wounds, all he knows is Tony. He releases all hold he has on ‘self’ – he slips into the presence of Tony. Everything ebbs away.
“Yeah.” Steve packs up his comic portfolio. “Just can’t make a living in it. I paint but not often enough anymore. Just no time with trying to make ends meet. That is until I got this job.” Steve zips closed the cheap leather case and Tony wonders if it’s the last time he’ll be able to see his art. Something hard and cold sits like ice in his chest. He rubs at his sternum and then turns away.
“I kind of have to, don’t I?” Steve tried his best to sound casual, as if none of any of this affected him as deeply and as messily as it did. Sam read right through it. The soul bond between them jittered and Steve knew it blared like a trumpet that he was covering. Sam, though, gentleman that he was, nodded.
“Not really. It’s fine working with you because it’s a challenge and I get to use problem solving skills on top of creativity. It’s fun. But most technical drawing is for different instructions or technical booklets. There’s not much creativity. Plus, with you I’m learning a lot from robotics to AI to biochemistry. It’s really fascinating.” Steve lifts a branch as they continue through the wooded area. Tony stays quiet and Steve can’t tell if he’s contemplative or just depressed. “So, what made you buy this island?”
“Now you’re taking care of me,” Tony says and touches her lightly on her cheek. “Always taking care of me. What would I do without you?” He smiles.
The easing tones sweep over him and the tension that he holds in his back muscles releases. Part of him as a young omega wished that at the mating blocks he would be sought after, auctioned to a large alpha who would take over him, who would dominate him. He has to admit he hadn’t expected to be wanting this, but as the man works, Steve’s erection seeps and he groans.
Steve remained perfectly still. Frozen by the words. It didn’t matter that they told him he was transformed, that he was this Divini. He was nothing but that thing in the cell, devoured and used.
Steve shrugs. “I don’t know if I call it purpose when I think some of the motives aren’t kosher. But I’m learning. I’m learning to be in this world again. I’m learning to be human again.” He rotates his shoulders as if to emphasize how he recognizes his humanity aside from being a feline.
“Don’t worry, you won’t die.” She snickers but retrieves a ceramic bowl and ladles out some of the stew. “You’re healing. It will take time because of the Soul Keeper. But you will heal. He can’t stop that.”
Tony tastes his soup, shrugs, and then says, “When I was little but a little too old to go crying for a kiss to make it better, Ana would make me soup. She was always a wonder in the kitchen.”
“Just my duffle and portfolio. I do some comic book drawing on the side.”  Steve grips his bag to his side. “Nothing special.” He notices Tony in the background listening.
Tony flexes his still gauntleted hand. “Time moves differently in here. We’ll need to sleep. We’ll need to eat. It’s all a simulation, but we need to do it. Our avatars need it, just like in a game.” He sits on the bed. “We can’t lose that backpack.”
Whipping around, he’s just on time to see Tony, slowly, inexplicably, slide out of his saddle and plunge into the freezing current.
“Yes, my lord,” Steven says. He doesn’t pursue the issue – and Tony cannot deny he wants him to.  He wants the debate.
“Shit!” He jumps up and races to the bathroom to wash his face and get the last vestiges of the seizure off him; it always feels like a thin layer of slime clings to his body when he wakes. He scrubs his face, checks his hair, and then straightens his shoulders. He can do this – the vision is gone – it’s just a dream, a weird quirk, an after effect of being frozen for 70 years. He tells himself these lies, and he heads to the lobby.
“He fucking tried to rape you?” Rage mars Tony’s beautiful features. “That fucking piece of shit. I’m going to fucking get him thrown out an airlock.”
Steve is not going to feel empathy for a mad robot. “I don’t think you can understand. You don’t get the depth of human feeling or circumstances. You don’t understand empathy or hope or desire or love.” He doesn’t mean to list it all, but there’s no stopping him now. “You don’t get to stand here and pretend you’re a living being. That you know what it is to long and yearn for someone that you’ll never have. You don’t get to pretend. You might think your Pinocchio, but you’re not a toy, or anyone’s puppet. You’ve always been a warped machine gone wrong.”
