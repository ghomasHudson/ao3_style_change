"Steve. I brought Peter." Nat spoke up. "We worked out a plan. I talked to Pepper, and she has an apartment she's not using. It's a few blocks away from the tower, so Pete won't be far from his friends. I'll stay with you guys for a while, then my apartment is just down the street."
"Oh- Oh- I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you." Steve laid back down and curled up, trying to make himself small.
Steve stood with his hands folded, patiently waiting. The elevator slowed and Steve moved to get out, but Friday stopped him.
"Well, let's get these X- rays done, and we can see whats going on. Change into the gown and I'll be back in a few." The doctor smiled and walked out, shutting the door behind him.
"Oh. No problem." Tony sat in the seat by the bed as Dr. Sackler pushed the wheelchair through the door.
"I didn't leave any money down there so I'll come to." Tony followed and got on the elevator with Steve.
Steve dumped the pasta in, and set the timer. Leaving the top off the pot, Steve grabbed two plates, to spoons, two forks, and two butter knives. He set them out onto the table, then went back to check on the pasta. While he waited, Steve gathered the rest of his ingredients and got everything prepared so he wouldn't have to hurry.
"You're filthy. Go shower. Then wash the sheets, make the bed, and wash the dishes." Tony kept eating, and working on his phone. Steve waited to see if he would continue his demands, but walked away when he knew Tony was done.
"No. You're saying that my father is the genius billionaire that is Iron Man." Steve stood from the bed. "And my mother runs his company."
"How about we have a fun day in. I'll make some breakfast, and you pick a new movie to watch. Maybe something that you haven't seen yet."
Tony yanked Steve's leg straight, letting Steve's knee pop into place. Steve yelped. He was being pulled by his leg, and although the pain was less, Steve could feel that something in his knee was still wrong.
"What the hell happened to your face?" Natasha's hand traced the swelling of Steve's eye, then gently pet the bruises on his cheek. "Who did this Steve?"
"Enough. Shut up." He squeezed Steve's throat. "Now you're going to tell everyone that you have some kind of meeting tomorrow and that you should be going to bed. And then you are going to go to bed and wait. No TV or phones or whatever. Just sit. Got it?" Steve did his best to nod his head yes. "Good. Now get the damn pizza." He let go of Steve's throat, but before Steve could get anywhere, Tony quickly stabbed Steve with a syringe.
"You're not so special." Tony shoved Steve's head to the side then walked away. "Now I'm going to eat breakfast and you're going to make it for me."
"Yeah. Yeah, we do." Steve smiled back as he was pulled into a hug. Bucky pulled back and walked towards the door. "See ya' soon Buck."
"Tony I was wondering if I could go to the store and get some stuff to cover up my face." Steve rubbed his hand over the bruises on his face.
"Open!" He said playfully. Instead, Steve pulled at the new restrains on his hands. He couldn't get out. "I said open." Tony gave Steve a moment to comply, but When he didn't, Tony grabbed a glass that had water in if for Steve, dumped the water on Steve's face, then hit Steve with the glass, knocking him unconscious.
Steve sighed. "I'm doing good Buck." Steve smiled and placed his hand on Bucky's reassuring him. "How are you?"
And then he couldn't breath. He was so cold. He cold feel the water rising around his body, freezing him as it got higher. He struggled to keep his head above, he struggled to breath.
Steve stood, ignoring the slight limp, and curled up under the covers. As soon as he was settled, Steve froze at the warm hands that wrapped around his waist.
"I didn't say that you could use anything. I want to see you down on your hands and knees. Pick up the glass, then lick up the rest." Tony chuckled to himself. Captain America on his hands and knees licking up a mess. That would be a sight he'd need to cherish.
"Why the hell would he have an asthma attack?" Nat walked quickly to the elevator. Tony followed behind. When they pressed the button, the elevator stopped. Inside, Clint was holding the inhaler and frantically trying to get the elevator to close.
"Dad it's just a reaction." Steve laughed and sat next to Peter on the bed. He sighed, and unconsciously turned his body away from Peter.
Steve walked towards the lower cabinet containing the cleaning supplies but stopped dead in his tracks when Tony stopped him.
"I have to go back to the city." Steve paused, waiting for a reaction. Sam was too busy trying not to choke. "I know that it's not the best idea, but the only way to protect Pete is to get everything with Tony sorted out."
Two more chapters then part two is coming... Also I’d like to thank all of you that are supporting this story and if you get a chance, say something or doing something nice for someone today. There’s no reason to spread hate for no reason. Love y’all (even the people that don’t like my writing) and stay safe!
"Of course Rogers." She smiled and pulled him into a hug. "Now let's get out of the bathroom and figure out where we are sleeping tonight and what we are going to eat because I haven't eaten this morning."
"Thanks." Steve answered the phone and shut the door. "Hey Peter." He tried to fake enthusiasm, but it failed. Steve sounded tiered and upset.
"Steve, I'll be right back keep breathing. Okay? Right back." Clint ran out the door as Steve sat on the bed. In his head he counted out the beats to breathe in on, hold, and breathe out on as best as he could. It'd been a long time since he'd had an asthma attack.
"Why didn't you tell me?" Tony threw Steve onto the ground. "I deserved to know!" Steve curled onto his side at the first kick. The second kick was to his back, paralyzing him in fear and pain. "He's my son Steve. My son!" Pain radiated from his hand. Then his thigh.
"Did I ask?" Steve didn't answer, instead he sat down on the couch again. Tony walked out of the room, leaving Steve alone.
Steve followed the instructions, first picking up the glass, accidentally cutting his hands a few times when the shaking got worse. He stood up and walked toward the garbage. Tony could see Steve pause and take a breath after looking at his hand probably noticing the blood. Instead of washing his hand, Steve just continued to walk towards the mess and get back on his hands and knees.
Steve laughed at himself. It was weird to think that at one point he was kind of like this phone in the sense that he was a brand new invention.
"Get up!" Tony yelled. "Get up." Tony nudged Steve with his foot. When Steve refused to move, Tony grabbed Steve by the throat with his suited hand. "I said get up. When will you start to listen?" Steve grabbed at Tony, refusing to hurt him, but he couldn't breath. Tony's grip got tighter, then he launched Steve into the wall.
"Steve." Tony shouted and shoved Steve off the couch as hard as he could. Steve rolled off the couch and fell on the floor, slamming his knee and his head on the ground. Steve grunted and slowly pulled himself off the floor.
"I wasn't supposed to!" Steve tried to lift himself up. The pain in his knee was excruciating, and Steve tried to straighten his leg, but he couldn't make himself do it.
"Steve and I are going to go to bed. You guys are welcome to stay and if not tell everyone to take the pizza with them."
"Yeah, well I am super tired anyway." Steve limped toward the elevator. He pressed the button, and limped on the elevator, trying to not bare weight on his knee.
"Don't be such a bitch!" Tony pushed Steve. "Huh?" He pushed Steve again. "Look at you! Captain America, won't even defend himself. What a joke!" Tony backhanded Steve harshly.
"We sure as hell are going to." Tony grabbed the book and pulled it back. He threw a punch at Steve, who dodged it and ran out of the way. "Come on! You think I'm too weak? Even without the suit I can beat you, but I wanna make it more fair." Tony held out his hand and waited for the older version of his suit to cover his hand.
"Ok. Well that is to be expected for a while. It's only been three days and considering how many other injuries you had, this is the best healing we could've asked for. Any trouble with your knee?" He bent over and opened the counter, grabbing a large blue hospital gown.
"Would you please-" Steve had to stop. He shook with sobs. "Please- help me- please. I can't- I can't do this."
Steve brought his hand up to his face, letting his fingers gently run over the bruised skin of his face. When his finger touched his jaw, he sucked in a sharp breath.
Also, if you've read up to here, please remember to be kind online (and all the time) and remember the difference between constructive criticism and just plain rude criticism.
"That's a lie and you damn well know it Rogers." Nat's hand stopped it's stroking. "It was Tony, wasn't it?"
"Stop trying Steve." Tony got off the bed and turned toward the door. "You ruined the mood. We were having a good time and you ruined it. So typical of you." Tony then circled back to the bed and sat down, facing away from Steve.
"What is that!? Where did you even get that from?" Steve started breathing a little faster and scrunched his eyes close.
"Tony?" Steve walked into Tony's lab. "Tony? It's time for dinner." Steve walked around the bots and half made suits, to the large counter, covered in metal scraps and tools. Steve walked along the metal counter. "Tony?"
The AI didn't answer which mean that Tony would be realizing any second that Steve really didn't want him to know where he was. The elevator started slowing.
"Steve, what happened?" Nat sat on the slide of Steve's bed, gently placing a few fingers on his hand.
Steve kept his eyes low and on the table. He didn't like when Tony talks to him and about him like this, but he wasn't going to change anything.
Steve set down his menu and took a sip of his water that the waitress had just brought him. On the other hand, Tony reached into his pocket and pulled out a small bottle of alcohol and dumped half of it into his coffee.
"Tony told me to close the door, but I hesitated because I thought I heard you. He wasn't happy and slammed my face into the door."
"Stevie! Wake up!" Tony shoved Steve gently. "Steve!" Tony shook Steve now, but he still wouldn't wake up.
"I said I'd have Nat find me a place, and that I wouldn't be alone with you." Steve answered quietly.
"I'm sorry?" Steve turned to face Tony. His face was slightly red. He was a little angry, and slightly hurt.
Putting all of his weight on Steve, Tony adjusted so Steve couldn't breath. Using his other hand, Tony held Steve's head in place as he painfully lets bite marks and bruises on his neck and shoulders. Steve's hands clumsily fought to remove Tony's arm from his neck, and he squirmed, trying to get out of Tony's grip. It didn't work, and Steve lost conciseness a few moments later.
"Okay... Friday send up some help, tell them it's an emergency. Erase all security tape from Steve and my own floor from the past hour and shut down my floor until I can get back there." Tony sat down next to Steve who was watching his with a half open eye.
"My living quarters." Steve stood in the back of the elevator with his hands held together in front of him.
"Stop!" Tony turned around and pushed Steve back. For every step that Tony stepped towards Steve, he stepped back. "Shut up! Just shut your damn mouth for a second! Just because you are the leader of the Avengers doesn't make you any better than me or anyone for that matter!" Tony was now yelling. "See you don't get to tell me what to do in my own damn building. And you sure as hell don't get to judge me for my decisions. You know, sometimes I hate you!"
"Well Tony, you pushed me into the elevator and threw a vase, I wasn't going to pursue you. You're an aggressive drunk."
Steve searched through his clothes, but wasn't able to find anything his taste. All his old clothes were gone, Tony had replaced his clothes. Steve grabbed a random outfit and put it on.
"Tony-" His voice craked, and fresh tears fell from his eyes. "I'm sorry." He cried, but he didn't dare move closer to Tony.
"He follows orders pretty well." Dan looked at Tony, talking to him as if Steve wasn't just standing there.
"Where are you going to go?" Tony pushed Steve to the floor. A thunk could be heard as Steve's head bounced off the floor. "Huh?" He picked up Steve's bag. "I'm Tony Stark. Everyone loves me. Even Peter. Who's going to believe you?" Tony walked away, knowing that Steve wasn't going to leave. "You're weak. If you leave, you'll have nothing. You're going to make an even bigger fool of yourself than you already have." Tony threw the bag into the bedroom and walked back out.
"No way." Tony said slapping Uno cards on the coffee table. Both Tony and Steve sat on the floor, both on opposite sides of the table and Tony started to shuffle.
‘But sir, it’s in my protocols to keep you safe.’ JARVIS pleaded, his British voice was full of concern, full of emotions. Something Tony was proud of. He created a being with human emotions. It’s sad that the only thing that cares about him is his own creation.
Now all is left is to find a way back to the city but as the supersoldier is looking around, scanning their surroundings, it seems they are still at the place Steve and the rest of the team were searching for Tony so the blond has an idea as to where they are supposed to go.
“As you wish then, Steve. We will talk once we get out of this shit hole. Just remember that I love you.” Steve doesn’t reply to that anymore and the billionaire wipes his teary eyes but doesn’t stop creating others. The two men are sitting there in awkward silence Steve is eating the bread alone since he found out that Tony doesn’t need it at all.
"And do you know where he is then?" Steve asks yet another question and even though Pepper is really tired she doesn't let anyone see it and answers. "No, I have no idea where he is." At that, she fixes her perfect high ponytail in frustration.
Then he looked at the core with the reactor. The ticking stopped, the bomb was defused, but the reactor was broken so there was no way for him to put it back into his chest.
"Promise," Steve answers with a calm voice. Tony knows that the super-soldier never breaks his promises so the billionaire is fine.
"He's not coming?" Natasha asks even though she already knows the answer. The assassin just wants it to be confirmed.
"Sir, I detected your stats are higher than it's usual. Should I call for help?" JARVIS asks like the good A.I. he is, but not even he can help Tony right now. Nothing and nobody can help him right now. The best thing that ever happened to him in his miserable life is gone, but it can’t be gone because apparently it has never been his in the first place.
“Guys, now I know where are the civilians. The bots dragged them into a dead end and now they are guarding them, so they can’t run away.” Natasha shouted in the comms with a voice full of worry.
"It's nothing, really. It's my job after all." And on that, the doctor walks away to another patient.
"Of course not, how can you think about something like this?" Steve asks with wide eyes, he can't believe what he is hearings right now. The romantic atmosphere is gone but that doesn't matter to Steve at all.
"He is in his workshop," Steve replies and Tiberius quickly turns back to the elevator, "but before you go, can I talk to you for a minute?" Steve blurts before the dark-haired man gets a chance to walk away.
"Steve, I'm sorry…" Tony whispers as his eyes start to fill with tears. His voice is not shaking anymore and also his skin is back to normal. He didn't mean to do this.
Tony has a few cracked ribs, internal bruising and few minor cuts all over his body. His previous injuries reopened a little bit, although it’s nothing life-threatening. Nevertheless, he still needs to take it easy for the next month or so. He is also starved and sleep-deprived and that's something Steve is going to take care of.
"I can't believe I fell in love with you…" Steve is really bitter at this moment and he might be saying things he will regret saying in the future. He really feels like this is not the man he loves in front of him. It’s not because he is a creature that drinks human blood but due to all the lies. He doesn’t know what to think and this is his coping mechanism. On the other hand, Tony is shocked by the confession the blond man just made, but then he remembers the situation they are in and his expression saddens even more.
Tony was the least fine of all of them. He took some painful shots, had some minor injuries, but that was nothing new. He was trying to protect others - mostly Steve - from the hits and didn't take regard to himself. He thinks of himself as replaceable, however, that’s not true at all. The team loves him and has in him a good friend except for Steve who would like more.
He sped to him, putting him in his lap, keeping pressure on the wound, stopping the stream of blood. He didn't care that he will get dirty from the blood, all that matters is to save Tony.
"We are your team and you didn't tell us! We could have worked it out like we always do! You didn’t have to be on your own." Steve spats angrily. He thought that the engineer learned that he is not alone anymore and that he has a team that cares about him and will always have his back no matter what. But he was terribly wrong. He is still the same narcissistic soloist like before the battle of New York. Doesn’t trust anyone and thinks he is better than all the other people around him.
Steve takes Tony's face in his hands because he sees the genius is panicking. He cups his cheeks gently with love in every movement. And then he opens his mouth to ask what happened because he is still confused and he wants to know why.
"I never said those words." Steve throws back. He doesn't know what is happening. He was the whole day on the mission.
Tony slowly walks to the lab, too exhausted by his life falling apart right in front of his eyes. Steve is nowhere to be seen - good. When he arrives at the lab, he moves to his workbench and looks at the photo of the two of them smiling, wrapped in each other’s arms, happy, at least that's what Tony thought it was, but now it's just another lie. Everywhere he moves it reminds him of Steve, of the memories they had together. Every second, every breath, every step without Steve hurts so much, it's unbearable. Maybe it's the time to end the pain…
And then Tony finally sees who is beside him and he is shocked. It's really Steve. Tony is starting to shake a little in fear of what's coming. Is Steve here to mock him even more? That he is pathetic for trying to end his life? But he doesn't let Steve play with him anymore. He is going to fight back.
He is waiting in the hospital for Tony to come out of the surgery. They had to pump out his stomach since he has eaten so many of the sleeping pills. They said that if he came a few minutes later it would be much worse. That he might have died. Steve doesn't, no he can't think about that outcome.
"That's just amazing!" Clint yells out of frustration from his spot on the stone, his bow resting beside him.
Tony waits for another hour but then he hears the door opening. He eagerly jumps from his seat and runs to the source of the sound. Tony quickly hugs the super-soldier and gives him a welcome kiss, however, something feels wrong, Tony can't point what exactly it is, but something isn't right. Steve seems tense and uncomfortable, it must be because of the mission, maybe it wasn't as easy as he said it would be. Nevertheless, that doesn't change anything about the dinner. Tony is sure that Steve will cheer up after it.
The residential genius is a charming, mysterious and sarcastic person but he is also the fearless Iron Man and the supersoldier's teammate who Steve has a crush on. It's not really a crush anymore it's more of a love towards the billionaire who flies in the suit. The blue-eyed man hopes one day they will be together as more than friends, however, he is willing to wait and for now, he is happy as it is. The truth is that he thinks life couldn't be better. But one day changes it all, a day no one expected.
"Of course I will," Steve replies without any side thoughts he so sure of this that he has never been so sure of anything before. This feels right.
At that Tony's eyes start glowing red, his fangs are on full display, however, as he is in the shadow of the corner Steve can't see the pair of sharp teeth protruding from Tony's mouth. Tony's mind is shouting for him to jump at the blue-eyed man but there is sunlight coming from the small window and crossing his path to the blond.
As they climb the stairs and open the door to the surface, they see darkness, only the moon provides some light. Tony and Steve breath in the fresh air of the night and now it finally seems they are truly free. The way they escaped was strange but they can’t complain.
Tony was telling the truth when he said he was able to defuse the bomb, but it required to overpower the core of the missile and to do so he needed a lot of energy. The only near source of energy was the Arc reactor in his chest - he wouldn't make it in time if he flews back to the tower.
"Tony, can you hear me? Where are you? Please say something..." Steve’s voice was shaking with fear as he asked and still no answer.
"But you guys didn't see him before... it was like from a horror movie... blood everywhere..." He answered, eyes red and puffy from the crying. He wants to cry more, but he has no tears left.
Tiberius thoughts to himself. The dark-haired man hates the captain for everything he stands for, it's good to know he is not as perfect as everyone says.
“Is it really true? How did it happen?” Natasha says gently, looking at Tony with kind and understanding eyes. She knows how to act in every situation and that’s why everyone in the team loves to have her around. She is such a good listener and always gives good advice.
Tony doesn't react for a while, it takes his slowed brain by sadness more effort to process the question and form a reply. So the two of them are staring at each other in awkward silence until the genius finally responds: “I invented a special serum that allows me to walk in the daylight for 8 hours and when we are in a fight the armour protects me.” As he ends the sentence he puts his head back into his knees. He can’t stand to look at the man he promised himself that he will never hurt but did the exact opposite. He is ashamed and even if Steve will one day forgive him Tony won't. He can't.
Steve is satisfied with the answer and it actually perfectly makes sense. Of course Tony would invent something that would ease his life as a vampire. The genius is probably the only one who has that serum so it's good to know no vampires are lurking in the daylight.
"Steve, I can't live without you. I was about to propose to you but then you - the shapeshifter - said all those words and I broke down I wanted it to be perfect but now it's not possible. I'm sorry." Tony says sadly. Now he can't surprise Steve with the proposal and he wanted it to be special.
Hope settles in the supersoldier's mind and he works on autopilot, that's when he feels a needle in the back of his neck. It stings a little but he can't think about it for too long before his vision starts darkening. The fatigue lowered his guard and he is now unconscious laying on the ground. Whatever they do to him at least they will get him to Tony.
They don't have a precise location but it will have to do. It seems they took Tony somewhere outside the city and there are not many cameras there. The radius the A.I gave them is still huge and they will need everyone in the team to help with the search. Steve just hopes Tony will be okay when they get to him.
"And what about you Thor?" Clint asks the North god. The movie that they were watching with Bruce is ending.
Steve turns back looking at Tony who is still trembling in the corner of the room but now it looks like whatever is happening to the genius is getting worse. The supersoldier takes the bread and tries to hand it over to the philanthropist but on that, the engineer flinches away like the touch is poisonous.
Steve was in the best condition of them all. He received almost no hits. He had no bruises, utterly nothing. Someone could blame it on the super-soldier serum, but even that can’t heal so fast. It was truly weird - it looked like the heavy punches were avoiding him and Tony knew why...
Then there is silence, everyone is waiting for what's going to happen next. And that's when Steve starts with his own speech. He needs to make this right, he can’t lose Tony because of something solvable like this. The supersoldier doesn't want to live another second with Tony thinking he hates him. He needs to fix this and the words he is about to say will hopefully do the trick: "Tony please don't think that my feelings have changed due to what happened." The team except for Tony doesn't understand Steve's words at all, however, the genius feels hope settle in his heart. He can't believe what Steve's is saying. He still loves him, he hasn't messed up.
"Tony! Where are you?" Steve said worriedly because now he could hear how Tony's voice was trembling, like he couldn't breathe...
Tony just lays there and lets the man do whatever he pleases. This is it, the end. He can't defend himself anymore, he never could. He is nothing without the suit just like Steve said when they met for the first time, he is just a fragile weak old human. Nobody is going to find him in time and he will die here in his workshop by the hand of his abusive boyfriend.
Tiberius lowers himself to the ground before Tony so they can be face to face and continues in talking, his voice is cold and merciless. "Did you tell him anything?" He asks even though Steve was clearly clueless about what is happening down here. He just needs an excuse for beating Tony some more and he always finds it.
However, when he examines Tony some more he can see the man is pale and his body is massively shaking, sweat mixed with blood visibly formed on his forehead. His perfectly tailored suit is shattered, the jacked lays beside him, the white shirt is covered with blood and dirt and there are holes in the trousers under which he can see light bruises. The wounds are probably nothing life-threatening but Steve is worried either way because the engineer doesn't look good.
"You must be so pathetic to think that I would ever marry you, that I would ever truly love you. It was all just for the sex nothing more." Steve's hurtful words are stabbing the engineer's broken heart. He is trying to be strong but he can't. Steve was his everything and now he has nothing left.
And that won't be such a problem because as he saw the genius lying there wounded and curled up in himself, Steve knew he doesn't want to live without anymore and if he doesn't confess his feelings for the billionaire he will certainly regret it for the rest of his life. So he confessed right after Tony was released from the med bay.
"I will ask him when I see him." Steve volunteers, he wants to solve this problem once and for all and see Tony's cheerful smile once again. It physically hurts him seeing Tony like this. The billionaire is like a ghost of his past self.
“The operation was successful he is not out of the danger yet. But there is a high chance that he will make it. He may even wake up soon.”
Tony opens his eyes and he is confused. He sees white all around him, but that is not why he is confused. It’s the fact that he sees Steve. His brave Steve with red eyes from crying. Why is he here when obviously something happened to the others. Steve wouldn’t cry for him. He might have been sad for a while because he is his teammate, but not cry, especial not like this, full of desperate.
“Thanks, doctor, these are amazing news to hear,” said Nat, relieve visible on her face. Everybody relaxed a bit at hearing the good news, except Steve who was still worried.
It must have been the shapeshifter. That's terrible. Tony thought it was him who said the horrible words but it was the impersonator all along.
On that, the team returns to the tower from the failed mission. The worst part is that someone will have to tell Pepper the bad news. The woman will be devastated, they have been friends with Tony for a long time and the redhead cares about him even though he is such an idiot sometimes. Someone could say they are even platonic soulmates.
"Then it's good that I will never leave you. You are never going to get rid of me. I love you." Steve takes Tony's hand in his and kissed the top gently.
Tony and Steve got married two months from the horrendous event. The shapeshifter has been caught and imprisoned and they live happily ever after.
"So it wasn't you?" Tony asks his lower lip is wobbling adorably. He is on the verge of tears but they are tears of happiness this time.
"And do you know what he was asking about?" Tiberius continues the conversation and Tony is not sure if he should answer this time. He rather stays silent but that might have not been the best idea the genius had in his life just like many things that happened all the months in the relationship with Tiberius.
lessons in going for the jugular – well, she learned from me, I guess. She said it was bad enough that I had an obsession with creating robotic friends with weird personalities and locking myself in my workshop to mess with tech when I should be glad-handing shareholders and paying attention to her, and being a superhero and drinking which she also said affected my performance in bed which is
But compared with some asses he knew, it wasn't even close to perfection, and his dick had better just go back to sleep because if it couldn't have that perfection it wasn't settling for less...
"Thor," Tony replied, from behind the faceplate, thanking the God he didn't believe in for the distorted voice of Iron Man.
"Shit!" Iron Man dropped back down into the water, giving the limp body he was still holding by the collar a second soaking. "Get behind me and grab hold. Arms round my neck, then just hang on and thank whatever gods you believe in that that it's not a bridal carry."
The thought was broken as right side window shattered into a thousand pieces. The small green thing landed on Jan's lap, provoking a choked-off shriek that was echoed in a small way by Hank, but by then the miniaturised Hulk had bounced up onto Steve's shoulder and scuttled round to his left ear.
It was a feat that left Tony in awe. He went barrelling in, blasting with the repulsors to left and right, covering Thor as the hammer flew outwards, felling trees and bowling attackers aside.
They hadn't discussed that and he wasn't sure he wanted to tell Tony, but the other man was now looking at him with growing interest. "I had an interview."
"It would be easy enough to work out," Tony replied. "You have to be in the top thirty on the Forbes Rich List to afford one of your rooms, and living in California to make use of it. It's not usual for the same dining room to be available for months, and everybody and his mother knows I'd moved to New York for that period. Someone with a lot of money, even by my standards, was prepared to block book the room and actually use it, so that they'd know when I was there."
"I'm not a dog." All the same, Tony followed the coffee's trajectory into a sitting position, clasped the mug in both hands, and took a gulp of its contents. It tasted foul. "Urgh."
Steve shaded his eyes, trying to get a better view because the thing was in the full glare of the sun. Whatever it was, it was getting closer, looking as if it might just clear the top of the bridge.
been an increase in cryptozoological sightings in the past three months,"  Jarvis reported blandly. "I have eliminated the obvious frauds and am attempting to track any possible movements of sighting towards Seattle. Steve is checking the credibility of those reports on which I cannot make a human judgment call."
"It's the latest of a dozen texts from Virginia Potts – I take it that's actually Pepper," Bruce said. "Are you sure you want me to...?"
"How did it do that?" Steve shouted, turning his head to one side so that the wind of Iron Man's speed would not drown his words with its noise on the comm-link.
Being ridden herd on by three different men in the same silly white suit – with shoulder pads, cape, ears and
There was no sign of the portal; gritting his teeth, Tony blasted away several feet of rock and found nothing.
"Sir," Jarvis interrupted. "I hate to intrude at this moment, but Ms Romanoff is now calling and she insists on speaking to you personally."
It was late in the evening before Tony and Jan finally escaped the attentions of the NYPD and SHIELD and returned to the Tower. The authorities had spent so long arguing over jurisdiction that Tony had, in exasperation, pointed out that the entire incident would have been viewed on the Internet by half the world before they got around to seeing the footage.
With the Stealth suit at his side, Iron Man let loose with all the considerable power of the repulsors, throwing trees, scrub and rocks into the air. Thor's hammer hurtled past, taking out the biggest trees, while Jarvis changed tactics with the Stealth suit to clear the remains behind them.
He glanced at his watch then, with a shrug, selected charcoal grey pants and a cream cotton shirt. They would have to do.
Steve slid his shield onto his back and followed Tony back to the now-deserted hangar. Creepily, Tony's flashy gold and red armour followed at their heels.
He followed her eyes to the cracked and starred glass, and his hand started to move to the arc reactor on – in? — no, resting – on his chest, then stilled. His breathing was easy, deep, unrestricted despite the second of panic. But that, he guessed wasn't what Natasha had been talking about; instead, that would be that his hair was as dark as it had been that day in 2012, without a hint of grey, and he looked thirty or less rather than the forty-two he had been then, his face untouched by pain and stress.
Tony spread his hands wide. "Director, you know every move I made the day of the battle. But you can also have my word that I didn't load a Chitauri troop carrier onto a helicopter."
"Anthony." Both of them jumped at Howard's voice. "I need a word with you in private. Steve, I'll be back in a few minutes. Meanwhile, can you manage on your own?"
"Doesn't act like it," Tony pointed out. "Stop talking as if you and your body are two different—" He stopped in mid-flight for nearly ten seconds, then rolled on top of Steve, pinning him to the mattress. "That's it," he said. "That's what's bothering you. That's why you kept pushing me away. You think I'm in love with the legend of Captain America but you don't really believe you could have been him. Well, I'm not. I'm in love with the man I picked out of the Long Island mud."
So here Tony was, standing outside of Steve’s apartment, absolutely exhausted. Instead of sending the usual text, Tony just dialed Steve’s number.
The alpha made quick work, unwrapping the box and opening it to see a deep red scarf with gold accents. When he didn’t say anything, Steve felt the need to explain himself.
Steve's eyes flew open. "I was never in Ireland. The Republic was neutral in the war, Tony," he said sharply, then, seeing the other man's grin. "But you knew that."
"Secondly," Clint continued, "someone – we suspect Roxxon Oil and Hammer, among others – has persuaded various members of the government and Congress to attempt to grant eminent domain purchase of the ARC technology as being vital to the commercial and military interest of the United States."
"No. It is not Makluan," Clea agreed. "It is not, I think, of this particular universe. It comes from elsewhere. Perhaps even from the first universe from which our local multiverse sprang."
"You won't have to. He only agreed to do it if Jarvis and I disguised him as the Hulk. I've told you before: he has no intention of being a superhero."
Tony sighed and closed his eyes. That was better. He'd have to ask Steve to find his sunglasses. "SHIELD sometimes lies by omission, and sometimes just lies."
Iron Man fell from the sky, between him and the chopper, repulsors glowing with blinding blue-white light, and, for the first time since Stuttgart, Steve saw all the armour's formidable armament arrayed at the same time.
It was less than five minutes later that Steve walked into the workshop, folded his arms, and gave Tony his best 'Captain America' glare. "Pepper told me it used to be her job to 'throw out the garbage'." His face twisted in distaste at the phrase. "But there's no one here now who'll do that for you, Tony."
"You've given me even better reasons to mistrust you. Like wiping my best agents' records from my IT systems. Then helping them to vanish. That wasn't friendly, Stark."
That was Tony's cue: "A-Jet2 - relaying position of hostiles. Drop your passengers at the perimeter, then get the hell out of Dodge and resume previous position. Over."
was what Tony thought. What he did was activate the sensors in his suit so that Natasha's relieved, "He's alive," was no surprise.
Ignoring the order, Steve freed his seat belt and plunged through the cockpit hatch, even as the plane tilted forwards and sideways, wings almost brushing the tops of the hangars, just in time to see the sky open like an eye, a dazzlingly bright blue-white eye, a terribly familiar portal leading God only knew where.
"Oh?" Selvig looked sceptical. "You'd better not tell Jane. She's already furious with him for not looking her up after the Battle of Manhattan."
But Jan had spotted her and was on her in an instant, blasting her with the full force of her stingers, even as the woman aimed at Iron Man.
Steve pressed his face into the curve of Tony's neck, drinking in his warmth, his scent, and the pulse-beat – so fast – against his cheek. He was beginning to remember why he should pull back, say something, make a joke out of it... but maybe he was dreaming again – he must be, surely – and letting go of the dream was as hard as letting go of Tony.
Tony bit back further argument. They were in battle, which meant Steve called the shots. Also, he happened to be right. But he had never found that fact so difficult to accept. Somehow, he restricted himself to, "Take care, Cap," and lifted off into the skies.
"Maybe he thinks he's at the Tower," Jan warned, "as he's sure to have seen Hank's performance in New York. But there was enough in General Ross's study to convince me that his research group was still in business, as you suspected, Tony. One thing you need to know right now, boys, is that Ross knows – or, more precisely, thinks he knows – that Steve's dead. And he's desperate to get his hands on your body, Cap."
In the circumstances, there seemed to be nothing he could do but obey, letting Tony ease him back onto the bed. "Dehydration," Tony muttered, as if he were checking a mental list. "Water, water... Jarvis?"
"Heimdall sent a message to Thor that two of his friends had vanished not just from the face of Midgard but that of the Nine Worlds. One moment they were visible, the next they were not. Also, there was the presence of magic. Thor asked him to keep a close watch. Two Midgardian days passed, with the only surprise the arrival of yet another of Thor's friends at that location – the one called Bruce Banner."
"I know, I know. If I could," Tony lied, "I'd invent a time machine, to get you back where you belong." Or maybe, if it was possible, he'd actually do it, because that would stop Steve hurting. He wouldn't be here with his arms around him, but Steve wouldn't be crying.
"That wasn't a normal Doombot," Tony said. "It was a mixture of tech and programmed organics. That's why Jean could read its mind and I could sense the tech, but neither of us could control it."
Once again there was that bitter note behind Tony's droll manner. What had Howard done to him in those years? Certainly it was not something Steve could ask him, not something he would ever talk about. But there was at least one more question to which Steve wanted – needed – an answer.
"They won't take the risk. Not if they figure you're out of the game – and I can arrange that. They don't have the evidence to convict Steve Rogers of major charges. With your record, it would be political suicide. And no one knows what really happened at the end outside those actually present. They won't call Vision to court to testify against you because he isn't human, or Natasha because they remember all too well last time they tried it. Or Wanda because they're terrified that she can manipulate their minds. That leaves me. I'm not going to testify against you."
Sitting down seemed to be committing himself to staying here in Tony's suite – and he didn't even dare look at the bedroom door, or at Tony, though he was uncannily aware of the other man's exact position.
"Right," Jan said briskly. "Shuri, come with me and help me rig this baby to bamboozle air traffic control. I'm hoping it's a challenge, but Tony has probably made it automatic. Steve, see if there's any food in the lockers. It's going to be a long flight."
"Probably. I was on leave then so all I got is gossip and speculation. But Cap being with you and Bruce would panic anyone."
Then, barely a hundred feet above the beach, the engines caught and the aircraft came in for a perfect landing on the narrow stretch between the cliffs and the incoming tide.
"And Iron Man has Captain America." The bitterness was there again. Much as Pepper was trying to hide it, Tony knew her too well not to see behind the mask of lightness.
"Not a problem," said Hank. "Bruce figured we might be putting the base in jeopardy by going to help you and Cap, so Jan and I shrank down everything of importance. It's sitting in the truck we drove to Oklahoma City. Even Bruce doesn't know how to return it to normal size. As for the computer data, we removed the hard drives and shrank them too."
Steve stopped listening. All his instincts were telling him that he was being lied to, distracted, even if it was by a computer. Because Stark, unlikely nurse though he was, had been genuinely worried about him, and genuinely reluctant to leave him to Jarvis's ministrations.
Once through the Holland tunnel and out into Jersey he would have to make a choice, but right now his only plan was to leave Manhattan behind and to stay away from Brooklyn, because that was probably where everyone would look for him.
Tony hesitated. Ten Rings. He'd been in their hands. Yinsen had been killed by them. They might already have Natasha and Clint. Steve... "There could be anything down those stairs."
"And your father wasn't?" Fury snarled back, plainly stung, which meant that Tony had been near enough to the mark to repay the original jab with interest.
Steve did not look at all convinced, but so long he didn't think to ask whether the explosion had done so much damage that the armour might have sprung several leaks unless he surfaced at once – or Jarvis didn't rat to him – he would have to accept it, because Jarvis always told the truth.
He found Steve and Howard sitting opposite each other on matching sofas, a bottle of whisky on the coffee table between them, tumblers cradled in their hands.
Steve shrugged. "Before the serum, women didn't want to date me and I wasn't the sort to pay for it, even if I could have afforded to. After the serum – well, by then I'd met the only woman I wanted to spend my life with. I'd plenty of opportunity when I was with the USO – but that would have betrayed what I felt for her."
"You have to go to Washington," Tony reminded her. "If, that is, you're representing Stark Industries, not StarkEnergy, or me. Time enough when you get back to move your stuff out. I'll sleep somewhere else." The workshop, probably, though he could use any one of the other suites...
And, dammit, there was that yellow cab with that particular license plate again right in the rear view mirror.
Tony snorted. "They knew less than I did." His eyes narrowed as he looked sharply at Steve. "Did they interrogate you?"
Though he could not see the other occupants of the vehicle he could hear the murmur of their voices, though no words in either English or Wakandan could be distinguished.
Tony nodded. "Yes. But the mercenary group have a quantum bridge – a teleportation portal. It seems to me highly likely that this was used to steal at least two of the so-called 'leviathans'. God only knows what they intend to do with them.
"We can't stop you," Steve said. "We can't even ask. No, Tony, we can't. Like Colonel Rhodes, she has a duty—" He stopped, biting the inside of his lips. He didn't need the expression on Tony's face to tell him how personally dangerous that remark had been.
"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry, babe," Tony was whispering into his hair, "but, God, you scared me. I thought you were dead – I knew you were dead – I can't..." Steve could feel his breath against his hair, followed by the touch of what could only be lips.
The hotel itself was disconcerting; at once what a few months ago in his own timeline had been a familiar if slightly dated style and at the same time disturbingly changed.
After a while, Tony said, "Out there, beyond the portal, I saw... I saw the stars in all their unblinking glory, the swirl of the galaxies, and the aliens' mothership. Jesus, Cap, it was
"Dad was an alumnus. So no, unless Obie or Pep enrolled me without my knowledge. I'm probably on their shit list because SI stopped manufacturing small arms and assault weapons. Are they pissed?"
Jan smiled at him. "I rather thought you got in the way of the war, hon. When it came to it, Dad backed me to the hilt, sent me to Paris, Rome and London to study, and financed my business. It was successful, too. I think he was proud of me. He said he was proud of me..." She was blinking rapidly, and Steve was sure there were tears in her eyes.
He was interrupted by another sharp but unintelligible warning, then the imprisoning hands let him go and, without their support, he fell to his knees in the darkness, feeling the rough concrete of the sidewalk under his hands.
"I didn't shoot nobody, least, not on a public highway. But right now you ain't on the public highway an' we don't like snoopers around here. Specially not when they're following up on the hoax my boy played on that damnfool jock." He leaned forward intimidatingly and, incidentally, took a long hard look inside the SUV. Apparently, he saw nothing untoward, for he stepped back with a, "So if I were you, ma'am, I'd go peddle my line elsewhere."
Then the guard stepped forward, and the hair on Tony's neck rose as he recognised the accoutrements of a Hatut Zeraze warrior. That warrior now waved the SUV to a halt without letting go of his spear, which, according to T'Challa, was tipped with a vibranium alloy that could cut through diamond. When the warrior saw who appeared to be at the wheel, however, he took half a dozen steps backward. The spear, now raised, was shaking slightly in his hands.
Mjolnir was gone, along with the Pym Particles and his wrist device, though his nano-suit that Tony had designed for their journeys through the Quantum Realm was thrown over the back of a hair.
"I wish I could say that she wouldn't because she almost certainly knows about us. She was dropping hints back in Wakanda that she understood how I felt about you. But that makes her more likely to try and surprise us, not less."
Automatically, Tony reached for the electronics in the workshop, the rest of the armoury and the house and found them, and Extremis, functioning perfectly.
Steve was still trying to recover as Thor leaped down and tossed his reins to Sif, before reaching up to Steve, who slid down into his friend's waiting hands. Even then, his legs almost gave way under him.
God, but he missed Coulson. He'd always known where he was with Coulson. Admittedly, that had occasionally involved the threat of being tasered, but at least he'd grown to anticipate that.
"Nope. Sometimes the stock market drops and then it gets really exciting. Better this than a Board meeting."
"She wasn't angry with you. She didn't even know about you then, but she knows now that you've saved my life twice in the last week or so." Tony paused as something occurred to him. "What were you doing in White Plains anyway?"
"I'm cold. You just pulled me out of a hot spa into the freezing night." Tony shrugged Steve's hands away and reached for his robe. "I don't suppose you brought me that Martini?"
That night, in bed with Tony's head resting on his shoulder as the other man fiddled with a tablet, he raised the subject again.
Remember that I would warn for major character death, and that you have been promised Steve/Tony and it hasn't happened yet!
Tony overrode Steve. "I'm fine, I'm fine. The flash temporarily blinded me –" He hoped to God it was temporary "–but Jarvis can direct me out of here."
T'Challa's expression was a little bemused, and his tone was losing its fight for tolerance. "We need to be ready to leave. Why don't you borrow that mercenary's uniform? And his gun. Pull the hat visor down, put on that pair of sunglasses you've been hanging on to and you might not be immediately recognised."
The cabin's utilities were distressingly old, but the skylight opening mechanism was one of the things he had updated during the period he wasn't making any headway with Steve. Now he used Extremis and the rudimentary house computer to open it as wide as it would go. It would be a squeeze for Steve, but even if he had to force the mechanism he wouldn't make as much noise as breaking the glass would.
Miss Potts laughed at that, though a little ruefully. "I'll concede that one. But it had to be you who saved the world, didn't it?"
There had been too many questions about why Captain Rogers hadn't been there. Tony had tried to brush them off, but everyone seemed to think they were joined at the hip or something. The SHIELD agents, in particular, had been suspicious and he knew he would have to face Fury sooner or later.
Tony straightened his spine and glared at the pair of them. "Generals! Professors! I've dealt with both and they're wimps compared to those sharks on the Board. Look, I'd love to have you around to instruct me from your vast experience, particularly if you suited up – and God, would I love to see Clayton's face if confronted by the Hulk – but Pe— Mrs Arbogast would kill me—"
"This is all my fault," he said bitterly. "I thought I had an agreement with these people – plainly, I was wrong."
"Stay down there!" Tony put his armoured palm to the glass and pushed. The pane fell into the room. The fact that it didn't shatter suggested that someone had replaced the original spec with armoured glass.
Steve was moving after them before he had really thought about it, and he could hear the whir of the Wasp's wings close to his ear. Behind them, he heard Danvers say, "Guess you fly co-pilot after all, Lieutenant."
But Bruce was obsessed with finding a cure for his 'condition' and banishing the 'other guy' for good which meant he proved just as reclusive as Tony himself.
No longer believing that there is any hope that Steve is still alive, Tony arrives back in New York to confront more legal complexities -- and Pepper.
"I'll get Jarvis to scan it and see if he can pick up any latent prints," Tony said. "And J, do we still have that worm in the helicarrier's systems?"
Marilyn Bartowlski had, by some quirk of genetics, inherited her father's height and blond hair and her mother's tight curls and huge brown eyes, while her skin was milky coffee. The blondness disguised the fact that the hair was now turning grey, so she looked far younger than she was.
It was a vaguely familiar voice. Female. Not Pepper, though. And there was another familiar noise behind it: the clatter of helicopter rotors, the roar of its engines.
"But the Vita-rays are a whole new area of study," Hank protested. "You can't destroy scientific discoveries—"
"Because you've got personal experience of some of the amazing things that were supposedly invented or at least came to light during World War 2. You met the Red Skull. You're the only person who survived the super-soldier programme. And you knew Dad and Dr Erskine and Zola."
"And I suppose he told you that I betrayed him." Pepper's tone was bitter. "That I was some sort of agent working for SHIELD?"
Tony rubbed at his chin. "It's already growing back. I'll see about arranging a designer stubble version."
Deliberately, Steve pressed the call button on the second elevator. He'd get some food, and some sleep, and tomorrow – or later today – he'd deal with Tony. Maybe.
"You'd think," Iron Man said to the room at large, as Tony ignored the sinking feeling in his stomach and the pounding of his heart, "that after all this time Doom might have programmed a few more words into his robots' vocabulary. Still, like creator, like robot."
Hurriedly, he pulled his T-shirt over his head, and sat down to let his eyes adjust to the blue-white light of the revealed ARC reactor.
The equations, white against the dim room, hovered in the air in front of him. There were parts of Selvig's analysis of the Tesseract that were tantalisingly familiar, while others were awkward or mind-bogglingly strange. Selvig thought that the Tesseract had a kind of sentience, or at least purpose, but Tony wasn't so sure.
Obligingly, he tapped her gently between the shoulder blades with a metal finger, opened the faceplate, stepped back, and pointed at Jan, then raised an eyebrow.
He pushed and so did Iron Man. The truck moved, inching back. They lifted it so the front wheels could fall back onto the earth behind the edge.
After replacing his sneakers – his feet might be wet but he needed the traction – Tony moved in close to the cliff, leaning against to the rock face, checking every bump and hollow. Eventually, he focused on a jagged crack running near vertically down the cliff from a couple of feet above his head to disappear into the stones under his feet.
"No, though Jane – or, in honesty, me on her behalf – is suspicious about the source of her new research funding."
Steve hoped he wasn't blushing as her eyes met his in perfect sympathy. All she said, however, was, "Why are they here?"
He slid his right hand across to his left wrist, careful not to disturb the blanket. He could just disappear into the Quantum Realm and—
"Come on then." Iron Man held out a gauntleted hand. Steve took it, covering a wince as he was helped to his feet.
“Honestly, the two of you will have to see each other eventually, so we might as well rip the bandaid off now,” Natasha offered. “Plus we’ve all been so busy and it’s the first time in a while that we’ll all get to spend any amount of time together.”
“Alright good, just know that we’ll let you continue to do your pro bono work, however you must do it through Vision as opposed to doing it on your own.”
you wouldn’t keep something like this from me for longer than that,” Natasha spoke, somehow managing to sound absolutely terrifying while keeping her eyes on the road.
Ignoring the omega’s pleas, he bent over to get closer to Steve’s entrance, spreading him to get a good look before attempting to suck him dry. The gasp that fell from Steve’s lips was magnificent, and Tony wanted to hear nothing more but that amazing sound for the rest of the night. He used his tongue to dart in and out of the omega, making him squirm and cry out for release. Once he’d had his fill, Tony pulled off of Steve’s entrance with one final flick of his tongue, then ran a hand lightly up and down the blond’s back.
They moved over to one of the larger work tables covered in what seemed to be scraps, looking for pieces to use for the outer cover for the bot they were building. Steve settled into his stool and began sorting through what was in front of him, picking out pieces that looked promising. “So, how long have you been at Midtown High?” Steve asked, trying to strike up casual conversation.
Steve looked away at that, seemingly trying to compose himself and hide the additional tears that fell.
“How about you write your name right here,” Tony said, pointing to a space above the boxes, just to the left of where he’d written ‘Potty Chart’. Coraline took the marker from Tony and, with great concentration, wrote COЯA.
, Tony wondered, knowing he wasn’t expecting anyone during lunch hour. “Come in,” he said, putting down his grading pen.
“Alright well, let me know if you need anything today. I know we’re all busy but don’t hesitate, ok?”
It was because of that, because he was all his little baby girl had, that Steve continuously forced himself to get up every day. He fought for any bit of happiness he could find in all of the darkness, because he knew that his daughter deserved it. As hard as it was to remember, Steve knew, deep down, that he deserved it too. All he could do was tackle each day as they came and went, and if he smiled at least once every day, the omega counted it as a victory.
“Mm, what’r you doin’?” Steve asked, slowly waking from his sleep, and causing the brunet to freeze right in his tracks.
Tony broke their kiss and began peppering a trail of love bites up to Steve’s ear. “If you don't mind,” he began to whisper, “I'm going to suck you off until you cum down my throat. Then I'm going to fuck you until you can't even remember your own name. Sound good?” Steve let out a needy whine before nodding his head. “Good,” Tony spoke into the skin of Steve’s neck, sucking a small hickey there before returning to the previous task at hand.
Cora’s face lit up instantly at that. Steve let out a sigh of relief as she went back to playing happily, as if she wasn’t just on the verge of tears a second ago. Steve worked tirelessly on his painting, only stopping to feed Cora and put her down for her afternoon nap. Once he was finished, he looked at the final product and smiled; he knew Tony would love it.
Steve swatted at Bucky’s hands. “I’m older than you, asshole,” he grumbled. The other men just laughed in response. “We ready to go now?” Steve asked, with a huff. Tony popped the trunk, allowing Steve to put his bag away, and said goodbye to Sam and Bucky as he moved to the driver’s seat.
She screamed, as Tony launched an assault of tickles on her. He knew that this wasn’t the end, that at some point he’d have to explain himself to Steve. But for now he was happy to just have these last few moments before spending two weeks in his own personal hell.
“Tony, I’ve always been… This way. Bucky was the only one who ever knew I was attracted to men. Lord help him, he tried to find a girl that I’d be sweet on…”
“So, Cora’s been an absolute nightmare lately. She’s been as difficult as can be, as often as possible, throwing tantrums literally everywhere. It’s as if someone’s replaced my Cora with her polar opposite.”
“I’ve  honestly come to miss the straightforwardness that you have. It’s a quality that not enough people exhibit today.”
Tony took a step closer to the bed, and reached out to remove Steve’s hand from his hole. The blond didn’t even have time to give a disappointed whine at the loss of his own fingers, before he was moaning around the feel of Tony’s. The alpha looked on in wonder as two, then three, of his fingers worked in and out of the beautifully wet hole in front of him. An overwhelming urge came over the brunet to taste the man below him, so he removed his fingers and brought them to his lips. Without hesitation, he placed two fingers in his mouth, and fluttered his eyes shut in ecstasy. Steve tasted even better than he smelled, and Tony needed more of it.
“This is true. I usually have to restrain myself more than usual when I see you wearing any of my stuff,” Steve interjected.
He’d been out of the military for 5 years, and finished his degree in Physical Education a little over a year ago. Though he’d found a job working at a local gym, he learned fairly quickly that he needed something more substantial to get out of the paycheck to paycheck cycle he’d found himself living in. He remembered the day he’d gone to visit his best friend Bucky and his fiancee, Natasha, at their apartment a few months before. Steve had been feeling beyond discouraged, seeing the minimal amount of money in his bank account after paying his bills for the month.
Tony ran from the office all the way down the stairs and outside, to find that it was pouring. He tried to flag down a cab, and once one stopped, he jumped in, giving the man extra to step on it. They made good time until they hit traffic that brought them to a dead stop. Tony wanted to wait it out, but after five minutes, he couldn’t wait any longer. He jumped out of the car and ran the rest of the way, making it to Steve’s apartment less than ten minutes later. He knew he looked like a complete mess, but he didn’t care. All that mattered at the moment was fixing things with Steve and getting him to come back to Vision.
Truth be told, Steve wanted nothing more than to slink back to his car, drive home, and hide under the covers in that moment. But he swallowed that feeling, hoping he could summon the bravado needed to continue this conversation. “I appreciate your faith and trust in me, Principal, and I don’t take either lightly. I know how important this job is, and I intend to give 110% to my students and this school as a whole.”
“So, what are you doing up here all alone, Cap?” Tony asked, turning to lean on the deck railing, resting his elbows atop the wooden surface.
“It’s definitely alright. It’s so much more than alright,” Steve breathed, gently cupping his hand around Tony’s jaw to draw him back in for another kiss.
“Well, now that we’ve gotten all of that out of the way, I’d say we’ve earned a snack. There’s a place inside the market that’s got awesome avocado toast if that’s your thing,” Steve suggested as he stood up.
“Nope, all I had planned today was working on bots for the meeting tomorrow, so really...you’ve just added a little zest to my day if anything,” Tony said without looking up from what he was soldering. Steve could hear the joy in his voice, though, which made his chest feel warm.
, why don’t we go get coffee in the teacher’s lounge and you can tell me all about this new tall, blond and handsome.”
Steve just nodded, now feeling the full weight of his nerves. His hand itched to reach for his phone, to call Tony one final time, but he knew it’d be best to just focus on the doctor’s words and instructions.
The words hit him like a fist to the gut and Tony had to clasp the arc reactor as he tried to gasp for air.
Tony just smiled, opening the door for him. “Why yes, my love, we are in fact going ice skating at Rockefeller Center.” He barely got the words out before Steve all but tackled him in a kiss.
“Stubborn ass wouldn’t take no for an answer,” Steve said around a grin, throwing his arm around Tony. He pulled him close, placing a kiss to his cheek.
“A few days ago I asked Steve to come to our Christmas movie hang-out shenanigans and he said he’d love to come,” Tony blurted out.
“But I wanna stay up ‘til da New Yea!” There was a tense moment where it seemed like they were going to be dealing with a full blown hissy fit--those had thankfully been few and far between lately--but eventually she resigned herself. “Count ta ‘free, daddy,” she instructed, somberly.
"Steve?" Tony walked towards Steve and gave him a big hug. "And might I say that you look amazing. Absolutely perfect." Tony kissed Steve's cheek and stepped back. "What's wrong baby?"
"I should've helped you! Dad you let me yell at you like it was your fault, when I should have been keeping an eye out for you. I'm sorry Dad, I'm sorry." Tears trailed down his face.
"Steve's here!" Sam yelled through the house. He waited for a second, then opened the door to greet Steve. "Hey Steve! How are you doing?"
"Dad, Bucky asked me where we're meeting." Peter's voice broke through the silence. Steve didn't even move. "Dad! Can you answer me or answer Bucky."
"Friday, stall the elevator for a sec." Tony went back to passionately kissing Steve, who was returning the kiss, just not eagerly.
"Damn Steve." Tony took a step towards Steve and reached up to kiss him, but they were interrupted by the elevator stopping to pick someone up. Tony simply stepped away from Steve and stared the employee straight in the eye.
"Lack of nourishment?" Natasha spoke up for the first time. "Steve have you been eating?" He didn't respond causing Nat to run her fingers through her hair. Steve had to look away from her. The guilt was too much.
"Dad!" Peter stood up as he got increasingly angry. "I want to help! You can't just leave me here while you go off-"
This might be my last story for a while. I greatly appreciate the support and love. However, with this quarantine and everything going on, I cannot hand the blatant negativity I get from my stories.
"Fine, but only this once." Steve sighed and limped toward the chair. Tony and the doctor offered their hand to help him sit, but Steve slapped their hands away. "I can do it myself." He grumbled. Steve dropped into the seat, unable to catch himself. He let out a high pitched whine when his sore butt made contact with the seat.
"Captain Rogers? Tony would like you to start getting ready." Friday's voice made Steve flinch, but he silently got up and headed towards the bedroom.
Steve sat quietly and started at his hands. He opened his mouth slightly, then closed it. He glanced up at Bucky, only to immeaditly make eye contact with him. Bucky had his hands on the table, with his weight in his hands. "Steve. Why didn't you fight back?"
"Stevie?" Tony bent down to the floor next to Steve. "Hey, come here." Tony reached out and gently lifted Steve's head onto his lap. Steve flinched away lightly, but Tony wouldn't let him move away.
"Damn it Steve I'm trying to concentrate!" Tony stood up from under counter. "You messed me up!" Tony took off the welding mask he had on and threw it at Steve, who easily caught it. "Why are you here?"
"That's it babe. Lick it all up." Tony laughed and pulled out his phone and took a picture. "You've got a damn good tongue Stevie. How about we put it to better use?" Tony stood up and walked to Steve.
When Steve didn't move, Tony let go of his hand, and put his hand on Steve's head. "Look at me." Tony grabbed his hair and forcefully turned his head. "Steven Grant Rogers, don't forget why you're here. It's your own fault." Tears welled in Steve's eyes. "And if you tell anyone, I promise you'll regret it."
"They're fine. I can't tell if they hate each other or not." Peter laughed. "When are you coming back?"
"Steve?" Tony yelled. He walked into the living room area, but Steve wasn't there. "Stevie?" Tony walked into the bedroom and found Steve, still in the bonds and asleep. He walked to the foot of the bed and untied Steve's feet. Then he uncuffsd Steve's wrist and tried to gently wake him up. Tony shook him gently and called his name.
After a few minutes, he could finally move freely, but he was still tied in the bonds from Tony. He could easily break them, but he didn't want to upset Tony. All Steve wanted was to make Tony happy but, somehow, he was the reason for all of his misery.
Tony pulled away from Steve, still stroking his cheek. "Let's take it slow sweetheart." Tony pecked him on the lips again and went back to his phone.
“Sorry to interrupt, I just wanted to ask if you had any other copies of the gravity worksheets for tomorrow's a packets, Mr. Stark. If not, I need the keys to the copier room to make more.” Peter spoke, shyly. “Also, hi Mr. Rogers.” he said, giving a small wave.
Steve stood in front of the mirror adjusting his navy blue gingham button down for the hundredth time. He looked over everything: his hair, his shirt (again), his pants and his shoes. He felt ridiculous being
"Well I just want to make sure Steve's aware of the fact that you like to drink a lot. It's a well known fact on campus that you have gotten black out drunk at every party you've been to since school started."
Steve turned to see a brunet with a lecherous grin hovering over him. “No one said I was here alone,” he offered, trying to distance himself from the alpha.
Tony reached down to take Steve's face in his hands before practically growling his response, “I need you…
“Are you sure? I don’t have to go in to work at the bar tonight, and I don’t have any plans with Bucky so I could stay if you wanted.”
Steve had to school his reaction, remembering that this was information he was supposed to be hearing for the second time. He managed to keep up with the rest of Tony’s banter during their walk, right up until they made it to the hallway that split off leading to the science wing and the gym.
“Listen, you’ve been cooking that little cutie for six and a half months, and you hadn’t given any thought to what you wanted the nursery to look like?” Pepper asked, during her daily stop at his office in the morning.
“I wanna help, I wanna heeeeelp!” Cora yelled in excitement. Steve just turned to give her a small smile.
. bit about where my money was coming from. New Years, The Aquarium, the paint set…” Tony leaned his head back and groaned. “Money, Steve. A lot of it. There is a lot of money and I would gladly spend it all on you. A five hundred dollar paint set… for me, it kind of is pocket change.”
Christmas was three days away, and it had been two days since the brunet showed up to find Steve almost out of his mind. During that time they hadn’t spent more than ten minutes apart, and it was absolutely amazing. Steve thought back to his heat, and fluttered his eyes shut at some of the more vivid memories. Even with his mind roaming to all the ways Tony took care of him, he kept going back to that first kiss. He’d be lying if he said he hadn’t thought about what it would be like to kiss the brunet, but it was even better than he ever could have imagined. Steve wanted nothing more than to kiss Tony senseless, but he knew that he was asking for more than he really deserved. With that thought, the omega gave a sigh, and slowly moved out of bed to make breakfast.
sorry,” Steve offered, immediately, “I’ve been feeling off lately, and...well to tell the truth, the smell of your hair was really calming. But really, I am so sorry.”
Tony stroked Steve’s face softly, before leaning in to kiss him, as gently as possible. They continued to kiss, lazily for a few minutes, before resting their foreheads together.
“Yeah, well, you’re stuck with me, whether you think you deserve me or not, so deal with it,” Steve replied, placing a hand on Tony’s chest.
“I uh…” Bruce started, “it’s been kind of hectic getting my bearings at this new hospital. I’ve been on call a lot lately and helping with a lot of deliveries so I haven’t had much free time.”
When he looked up at his friends, they were all smiling at him. For the first time in days, Steve felt like he was able to forget about whatever had him feeling ill and just enjoy being in the moment. He truly wanted to savor this day and this time with his best friends, so he stood slowly, and clapped his hands together.
Steve kept a smile on his face until Peter went back to whatever he was working on, then he just sank into himself. Steve didn’t have the heart to tell Peter that not only was he likely not returning as assistant coach thanks to the blow up on Friday, but that whatever he and Tony had was assuredly over. There was nothing that needed sorting out at this point; Tony had made it abundantly clear that he wanted nothing to do with Steve. Like it or not, that’s how it would have to be. Peter would learn to accept it, just as Steve would; at least he told himself as much.
That last statement hurt a bit to hear, but Steve could see how pained Tony was just having to say it. So he out on a brave face and shrugged.
Steve rolled his eyes but smiled as they left the market. They walked towards the water and after a moment, Tony let out a gasp. Steve stopped in his tracks, turning with great concern, only to see a look of excitement on the brunet’s face. “There’s a carousel over there,” Tony spoke pointing to the glass pavilion housing the ride. “I haven’t been on one since I was a little kid...wanna go?”
“Yes, mom,” Tony sassed, knowing that if things fell through, Rhodey would be there to help no matter what. “If you’re done lecturing me, I’d like to talk about the fact that two of my students are in a love triangle with one of your JROTC students.”
Since they’d made up, Tony had spent day after day convincing himself that Steve would eventually leave for good. He’d opened up to Steve about his family and their money, and that seemingly drove him away. Tony wanted to believe that Steve would be able to love the real him just as much as he had before learning his real identity. Really, he did. But every argument they’d had in the last few months would always pop up in his memory to remind him otherwise.
As far as he was concerned, this was a win-win situation for the alpha, so he couldn’t be happier. Leaving the office, though, Tony couldn’t help but wonder where his new promotion left Steve. He pulled out his phone before heading out of the office building to find a text from the omega.
“Okay, well...some of us on the team, we saw you and Mr. Stark get into an argument after the meet on Friday. I just wanted to say that I’m sorry we lost the meet if that’s what you guys were fighting about. We didn’t mean to let you guys down, but I hope...we all hope that you guys can patch things up.”
With that everyone moved to take a seat. Once food was served, everyone began to talk to one another. It felt surreal to finally have all of his friends under the same roof with Tony and the people he cared deeply about. All he had wanted was for everyone to get along and thankfully, that seemed to be the case. Steve found himself deep in conversation Pepper about modern art, when he noticed that Bucky and Tony had gone off somewhere. He silently hoped that his best friend hadn’t given Tony too hard a time, but once he saw the two of them walk back into the room laughing, he knew that everything was ok. The night went on with good food and even better conversation, but once everyone was ready to bring it all to an end, everyone said their good-byes, promising to do this again soon. Tony walked Steve and his friends to the front door, and while everyone else had walked out the door, the brunet reached out to hold Steve back for a moment.
When Tony arrives in the main room the whole team is already there. Natasha and Clint are eating at the table and Thor and Bruce are watching some movie. Tony moves in the kitchen and grabs some waffles and what is remaining of the coffee in the pot. He sits next to Clint.
"Will you do what I asked you to or not? I'm tired of this! You think you are funny but you are not! This is just you hiding behind a mask full of flirtation and sarcasm..." Steve replied again, he finally got everything he wanted to say out of his chest. His voice sounded furious and tired, he just wants to get done with this mission. He is used to Tony not agreeing with him but this is extreme.
However, now it's not the time to think about it. Tony is lifelessly laying in front of him and the time is running. Steve is trying to stay calm but it's nearly impossible. His mind racing. He has to call the ambulance fast, so he calls 911 and waits in panic for their arrival.
"Y-you c-came…" Tony says through his tears and pain, his voice is still shaking but it's not because of fear anymore. He is relieved that he is not alone, that someone cares for him enough to save him and that someone is Steve. That fact brings peace to Tony's soul.
However, when Tony lifts his eyes and they fall on the blond supersoldier the words start flooding into his mouth: “I love you too, Steve. I was scared I wouldn’t stand a chance after you have found out what I am. That’s actually one of the reasons why I kept it hidden from you guys. But now I see I was just a coward.”
"It was fine, but it could be even better if we stay like this for the whole day." Tony grins at the blond.
So Steve continued in following the doctor. After a while, he arrived at the door, he took a deep breath and opened the door. However, he wasn’t prepared for the scene in front of him.
"You have nothing to be sorry about. I don't need a huge romantic proposal all I want is you and you only." Steve replies.
"Nothing." The former HYDRA assassin replies. They have lost Stark and now Steve as well. They are doing a great job so far.
"You know we can't, Tony. Today is the solo mission I've talked about." Steve answers with a heavy heart. He doesn't want to go on this mission. Solo missions are always terrible, nobody ever wants them, but this one is important. It's another raid on HYDRA base. SHIELD got an echo that there are experiments going on. It's not confirmed yet, that's why he is going to get more information. But for now, it looks like they are kidnapping people and then trying to enhance them. But it seems it's not working because a lot of corpses was found and SHIELD is sure they are the failures, they don’t know if there are also some successful ones, however, we all hope there are not. Since it's a secret mission they are sending only their best man and that happens to be Steve.
It's been 7 long hours, 7 hours that Tony was in surgery. After they took him they managed to give him the arc reactor in time, but right now the wound in his abdomen is the problem. According to doctors, he lost a lot of blood and before the surgery, they said it doesn't look well. But Steve and the rest of the crew is praying for Tony to survive.
“I’m sorry Steve… I will be fine in few days… ready to fight again… don’t worry... I won’t be a burden to you…” Tony blurted quickly.
“I don’t know if I can for now. All that matters to me now is to get out of here. I don’t have the strength to continue this conversation. It’s pointless.” Steve says, his voice low and tired. He calmed down but he still needs more time to fully process the news. The events are still fresh in his mind.
They eat the pie in silence, it's time to propose. Tony is so nervous and it doesn't help that Steve behaves oddly tonight. Tony stands from his chair and kneels on one knee in front of Steve who is still sitting. He opens the small velvet black box in front of Steve’s eyes and starts his speech, which he trained long hours in front of a mirror. He wants this moment to absolutely perfect.
"Shhhh Steve it's okay." Tony pet the side of Steve's face softly, then slapped it. He loved how the red marks didn't fade away anymore.
Steve whined loudly before letting loud sobs escape from his mouth. Drool trailed out of his mouth, mixing with the blood that had already pooled under his mouth.
Tony yelled at one of the bots to clean up the mess and then he ran to the elevator. Tony slapped the button and yelled at Friday to bring him to Steve.
"Before my father and another scientist created the serum, you were nothing. You had nothing, nobody. You were a wimp, hell, Bucky had to finish your fights for you because you're too damn stupid and pathetic to fight them yourself."
The door opened, and Natasha quickly walked in and closed the door before Tony could come in to. Steve was sitting on the ground, leaning against the tub. Natasha sat next to him and grabbed his hand in hers.
A comfortable silence settled between them. Tony continued to pet Steve's hair and Steve's breath became more even. As Steve relaxed, his head slid down towards Tony's chest. Tony covered Steve with the blanket without disturbing him.
"Hey it's all good man. We're all tired and on edge." Sam lightened the mood easily. "Unless you're Bucky. Then you're just and asshole all the time."
Steve stared at Tony on the screen. His jaw was clenched tight, and his fingernails were digging into his palms.
"𝘕𝘰! 𝘛𝘰𝘯𝘺 𝘪𝘴 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘣𝘦𝘴𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘩𝘢𝘴 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 𝘩𝘢𝘱𝘱𝘦𝘯𝘦𝘥 𝘵𝘰 𝘺𝘰𝘶, 𝘵𝘰 𝘶𝘴. 𝘏𝘦 𝘨𝘪𝘷𝘦𝘴 𝘶𝘴 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳𝘺𝘵𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨. 𝘛𝘦𝘭𝘭 𝘮𝘦 𝘵𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘺𝘰𝘶'𝘳𝘦 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘷𝘪𝘯𝘨 𝘩𝘪𝘮."
The shout from Tony caused him to jump and hit the control to far. Icy water ran down his back and over his chest. The door opened forcefully and Tony busted in.
"It'll wear off too soon in my opinion." Tony said, biting Steve's neck harshly. Steve suppressed a groan. Tony released the skin from his teeth, licked the skin, then sighed. "We're going to have a day in. Your eye is black and swelled up. It looks so gross. Does it hurt."
"Do I look ridiculous? I'll change if you want, it's just I'm kind of bad at picking out clothes that semi match and that are modern and-"
"I'm s-" The slap across the face wasn't overly surprising, but it still brought tears to his eyes. "Please Tony let me-" Tony grabbed Steve's hair and pushed his head down as he brought his knee up at the same time. Blood gushed out of Steve's nose. When Tony looked at Steve's face, his nose had bent to the right, and was beat red.
"What would you like me to do?" Steve asked quietly. His normally bright eyes had dulled. His neck had a large bruise, along with many large hickeys and bruises covered his neck and the top of his back. He could feel the blood slowly seeping out of him. The blood and the other thing.
"Come on. Let's give you a bath." Tony glanced down to Steve's bottom half. His underwear were sloppily pulled over his ass. Both red and white stains seeped through them. "Come in honey. Let's get you into a nice warm bath and we can watch a movie together."
"Boss, Captain Rogers is in the medical bay. Would you like me to bring you there of to the dinner he has set out?"
"No, no. I mean He's a great fighter. He's super smart. He built his own suit and it's amazing. And he's rich which is super cool. He's nice, good looking, and funny. The whole package. So I don't understand why dad would want to break up with him."
"Oh." Steve lowered his head even more. His face flushed a light red from embarrassment. He ignored Dr. Sackler's attempts for conversations, only paying attention to how many people walked by them.
Steve stood up and walked toward the elevator. "I'm going to get this cleaned up then I'm going to eat. You're welcome to join me." Steve waited for the elevator then got on.
"It's fine Cap." Tony pulled down his pants and pulled on shorts for bed. He didn't even look toward Steve.
Peter turned around, noticing Bucky leaning aginst a pilar, staring at him and Steve. He smiled and held a finger to his lips. Peter nodded back and took out his phone.
"James Buchanan Barnes!" Sam called out sarcastically. "Dinner is ready princesses." A second later, Bucky huffed into the kitchen, his hair wet, and totally oblivious to Steve's presence.
Steve ran through the hallway to Peter's room. He quickly attached the cords the connected his TV to his Xbox and stuffed them into a side pocket of his bag. He went to Peter's closet, found an old school backpack, and opened it. He stuffed the whole gaming system in the bag, then put all the games he could fit along with the controller. Steve zipped the bag and ran down to the elevator.
He knew he was being unnecessarily difficult but he couldn’t help it. All he wanted was one person to help point him in the right direction, as opposed to confirming that what he was hiding from was obvious.
Tony liked the fact that Steve lived so close to Rhodey and Carol, mainly because he could just walk to one place right after visiting the other. He usually used the walk to clear his head and really think about everything that he had going on in life. He was currently thinking about all that had changed over the past few months between him and Steve. They’d fallen into this routine, of acting the part of a bonded couple expecting their first child, and yet, only one of those three things applied. Tony didn’t even want to thinking about bonding, but he definitely wouldn’t mind if he and Steve became a couple. But with all that was happening, he just wasn’t sure what to do.
Clint said, narrowing his eyes. Steve had no idea why the suspicious look made him so uncomfortable, but he felt as though he had something to cover up.
"Yeah, ok," Steve spoke, trying not to let the sadness show in his voice, “you’re more than welcome to shower here if you need to.”
Steve was an absolute mess. He knew it, but he hoped no one else had picked up on his embarrassing school boy crush. He tried, he really really did, to rein it in whenever they were with friends. The looks of adoration and wonder he’d cast, just listening to the brunet talk, were sure to get him in some kind of trouble if he didn’t cool it. He tried to keep the daydreams to a minimum while working on the seemingly endless amounts of paperwork from Clint. He thought he’d been doing a fine enough job until Bucky brought it up.
Tony couldn’t help but smile at that. He was still nervous as all hell, but it didn’t hurt to hear that Steve had been thinking the same thing.
“I mean there’s another topic but this one is more fun so we can stick with this for now,” Tony answered.
Pepper said as she stood from her seat. Steve felt the need to stand beside her and once he did she rested a hand to his cheek.
“I said I’m sure. I only...it only happened once, but past that, we spent two full days together. He didn’t plan for me to come over at two in the morning, and despite what you might be thinking, I was fully capable of preventing this from happening. You’re seeming to focus too much on Steve and not enough of the fact that I’m the fuck up here.”
“Well I figure I’ll stick to the lighter stuff until I actually have to start spending time around any kids,” the man replied.
“Please tell me you didn’t answer the phone in the midst of having sex with my best friend,” Tony said, disgust evident in his voice.
That pulled a laugh out of Steve, as the teen at the ticket counter handed Tony his dollar in change and the two ride tickets. They walked into the pavilion, and looked at the different horses they had to choose from. “Well, all of these horses look equally terrifying so I guess we can just pick whichever one,” Tony spoke, still inspecting each animal looking for the perfect one.
“This is too much, I can’t except this. Where did you even get the money for this?” Steve asked, running his hands over the beautifully crafted wooden box that held the art supplies.
“Seems the alcohol you have here is still fine, so I’m a little confused as to why you’ve been spending all of your time at a bar.”
Pepper successfully made her way out of the workshop and through most of the house without running into anyone. When she got to the kitchen, however, she noticed Steve making a sandwich. As badly as she wanted to just run for the front door, her feet pulled her right up behind him. He turned and jumped, slightly startled, as he noticed her.
“What happened to you?” Clint asked when he came to the servers’ station after bringing waters to his first table.
“Oh, well then,” Tony stammered, clearing his throat. “While I usually don’t accept payment for my good deeds, I think I can make an exception. Just this once.” Steve gave a triumphant smile, as he stood. “Somehow I had a feeling you might.”
“Don't worry about it, I was like 8, it was forever ago. Anyway, I didn't know where to go so I just left and ended up at Jarvis’ house. Of course I picked a cold rainy day to just up and leave, so when I got there I was soaked. Jarvis let me wear one of his massive sweaters while I stayed with him. We played chess, watched a movie, baked some brownies...it was one of the most fun days of my life.
After a night out at Bucky and Natasha’s apartment, while telling his oldest friends about his troubles, Natasha offered to help.
Tony sat with his hands in his lap, just looking expectantly at the blond. Steve gave a quizzical look. “I can’t start the car until you put on your seatbelt. No way I’m gunna drive off in front of those guys without you safe and secure in this car.”
with nondescript signage or window displays to indicate what type of store it was. The moment they walked inside, however, it became immediately obvious that they were in a sex shop.
It took a minute for Steve to notice the slightly upward twitch of Tony’s lips. Instantly any guilt he felt melted away.
“Oh… alright. And I thought we’d been through this before, hon. You don’t need to pay me for watching Coraline.”
“Yeah, and I’ve seen you guys holding hands when you think we can’t see. But even more than that, we’ve all seen the way he looks at you,” Bucky chimed in.
“I’m sure if Mr. Volkov was able to find someone desperate enough to marry him, he’s not going to let them go,” Natasha teased, laughing at the look of disgust on Tony’s face as he pictured the other very old, very not good looking Russian teacher.
Tony just shrugged and continued checking in. Once they’d gotten their room keys and made it to the elevator, Tony looked at Steve, quizzically. “Are you sure you’re okay sharing a room?” he asked.
Tony just rolled his eyes, and lunged forward, seizing Steve’s lips in a kiss that was over far too soon. “I like you,” Tony confessed, resting his forehead on Steve’s, “I’d like to keep kissing you if that’s alright?”
As the last patrons got onto the ride, music started playing. It sounded like an instrumental version of Frank Sinatra’s
Images of the fight he’d had with Tony flooded Steve’s mind, making the throbbing in his head from the budding hangover even worse. He needed water and he needed food, but getting up to get either of those things seemed like an impossible feat. As if on cue, a knock came at his bedroom door.
While Tony struggled to catch his breath, Steve couldn't help but be turned on by it all. In that instant he wanted more of the Tony he saw in front of him.  As he leaned in for another kiss, Tony put his hand up to stop him.
“Add dinner to that and I’d say you’ve got yourself a deal,” Steve responded, standing up and moving towards the door.
“So, Steve, I assume you have no idea why I’ve asked you here today,” the older man spoke, in a friendly tone.
“Yeah. Tony showed up yesterday to ask why I’d resigned and I told him about the baby. We talked and we decided to keep it. I also retracted my resignation.”
Steve watched on in silence as Tony narrated his every move while he assembled the bot. They sat in a companionable silence as they waited for the machine to power on and come to life. Once a small red light at the top came on, Tony turned to Steve with a large grin. “Congratulations, it’s a robot! What would you like to name the little bugger?”
oh friends, first of all, thanks so much for all of the kind words and kudos! It's been so amazing to see how invested some of you are in this story! Thanks so so much for loving these idiots and little Cora as much as we do, and I hope you enjoy this chapter!!!
“Yeah, but then I also consider how crazy my boyfriend is, and then I realize that I don’t really mind so much.”
“Well, I may or may not have done some drinking after you guys had left, and decided to pay Steve a visit to say ‘fuck you’ but also give him his gift.”
“Yeah. What did you think I was going to do?” Tony asked, readjusting himself on the bed and giving Steve’s cock a few quick strokes.
“I know you Tony, you’re not going to turn around. We’ve been driving for hours.” Tony couldn’t help but laugh at the fact that Steve sounded like a petulant toddler.
“You know she doesn’t understand any of what’s happening on that show, right?” Steve asked, removing his shoes and jacket. Tony just looked up and gave a tired smile. “Yeah, well there isn’t really much that I watch that’s kid friendly, so I settled for this. Plus this was my favorite as a kid so I don’t mind.”
Steve sat in bed, staring up at his ceiling in the darkness of his room. He’d woken up twenty minutes before his alarm was set to go off, leaving him nowhere near enough time to go back to sleep, but enough time to just lay there and think. Today was the first day of what was to be considered his new normal. He’d wake up, go to work, then at the end of his regular work day he’d be starting his new job, bartending.
Tony nodded his head furiously, waiting for her to see what he was getting at. When she didn’t, he just threw his hands up in defeat.
“Sure,” Tony said, handing Coraline a bag filled with stickers. She gasped when she saw what was inside. “I know, exciting, right?” Tony asked, ushering them both back into the apartment. They went to the couches and dumped out their things.
“I’d rather the end of my trip be right now, but it looks like neither of us are going to have what we want,” Tony offered, noting the twitch in his father’s jaw that indicated he was very annoyed.
“Are you kidding me?!” Tony threw his hands up in exasperation. “I literally paid a premium to move to a desk within your direct line of sight a month after I started working there, in the hope that you’d eventually break down and ask me out!”
Steve turned around and startled when he found Tony standing there. “Alright, your five minutes is up,” the brunet said, walking over to throw his arm around Rhodey’s shoulder.
“I wish I could, but I just got news that the team I coach needs an assistant this year otherwise we won’t be able to participate in competitions. Something about there needing to be at least two teachers during away trips or some dumb shit like that. I don’t know, but now I have to figure out who has the bandwidth to take this on.”
Before Tony had a chance to respond, Rhodey walked in. He quickly dodged the sock that Tony hurled in his direction.
“Pepper I… I was scared,” Steve tried to rationalize. “I had no idea why Peggy was really leaving Cora with me, at the time, but I was horrified that the same would happen with Tony.”
“The part where the entire movie happens…” Everyone let out a laugh at that, as Cora ran over and grabbed onto Tony’s leg.
“Well it is our first date, so I figure I have to impress you if I want a second date. However, opening your door makes it easier for me to say you owe me one, so you should buy dinner tonight.”
Steve took that as his go ahead to take control, wrapping his arms tight around Tony and turning them around so it was Tony against the wall. There was a wicked grin on Tony’s face when Steve started working on his pants.
Tony quickly noticed that not only was Steve laying on his sweater, but he'd gotten cum on it as well. Seeing that in addition to feeling Steve’s hole flutter throughout his orgasm was enough to push Tony over the age.
. This whole thing blew up in my face just like you both said it would and from here on out, I’ll make sure never to fall for anyone ever again. Clearly love isn’t in the cards for me so...I get it. You guys don’t have to go into it.”
The two of them sat there in silence. Steve had just laid out a lot of things on the table and Tony didn’t want to deal with any of it.
Steve said, taking notice of the look on Tony’s face. As he walked out of the workshop, Steve couldn’t help but wonder what was about to happen.
Steve stood up immediately, rubbing his hands down the sides of his legs just for the sake of having something to do with them.
“Well”, Tony began, slowly trailing his hands lower. “You said the day is about doing what makes me happy. Right now, what would make me happy is doing
A few days into it all, though, Tony just felt tired. Pretending to have your shit together was a lot harder than it seemed, especially when you had to be convincing. All he wanted, come closing on Thursday night, was to walk into the closest bar and drink until nothing mattered anymore. He knew that wasn't the best way to deal with everything but for now, it’d suffice.
“Okay, well I guess I’ll head out and try to see if I can’t get a jump start on looking into this,” Nat said, getting her things together before she stood. “I’ll see you guys later,” she said in farewell.
“Well, if you say he’s a good guy, then we’re happy for you. We’ll have to meet him, of course to make sure he’s not just fucking around and all.”
“What’s the point of having a bouncer if not for that exact reason?” Bucky answered, clapping Steve on the back, firmly, “But either way, you’ll be fine, I know it.”
"Mornin' Darcy," he said giving a small wave. She leaned forward, resting her head on her hands as she began to bat her eyelashes.
Tony woke up in a haze to the annoying shrill of the alarm on his cell phone. He blindly searched for the phone on his nightstand, refusing to lift his head or open his eyes. Once he caught hold of it, he vowed to smash it against the wall as soon as he turned the alarm off. In doing so, he not only realized the texts and missed calls from Steve, but he realized the time. It was 10:00 am, and he had slept in.
“Welp, you sure showed me!” Steve stated, rolling his eyes, “Anyway, what are you up to while we’re off for Christmas?”
That warranted Pepper’s attention. She called to the front desk to ask them to hold all of her calls and push back the next few meetings she had scheduled. Once that was done, Pepper gave Tony her full attention.
Once the door closed, Steve let out a breath he hadn’t known he’d been holding. His “first” date with Tony had gone amazingly well, and he couldn’t wait to finally tell Cora that Tony was back, hopefully for good.
Steve woke up the next morning feeling like shit, again. He’d slept in his bed, so at least he didn’t have the crick in his neck, but that was replaced by the pounding in his head. The previous night’s events slowly became less and less foggy as he gingerly tried to sit up in bed.
After being discharged from the Army, Steve didn’t know if he’d be able to truly find happiness in his work ever again. Being in the Army was truly all he’d wanted for so long, and to lose that over something so stupid as breaking his femur while longboarding during his off time, had absolutely crushed him. But standing here, daydreaming about what new possibilities lay ahead of him, was genuinely the first time Steve truly felt like maybe he was meant for this. Maybe there was something else out there for him other than being in the Army.
know why I was late, it was because I was meeting with another teacher about them possibly being the robotics team assistant coach.”
it, Steve. It’s like a hotel only we’re going to make it so homey and Cora has her own room and there’s this jacuzzi bathtub that’s big enough for the three of us to fit in and we can teach Coraline how to swim and--what?”
