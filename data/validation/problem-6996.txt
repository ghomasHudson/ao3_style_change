"Dr. Strange," Steve greets, glancing at Tony, who is squinting at the scan like he actually knows what he's looking at.
Their first argument since Steve's world or memory change comes as a slap in the face of the idyllic relationship Tony's been working so hard to keep going.
Steve sighed. "Sure, I'm keeping my eye out just in case. But that doesn't mean he's the only reason I wanted to come here."
"Well, yeah. You were a dick. But he hated you before, right? You won him over once before," Bucky pointed out. "So do it again."
Tony puffs out a breath that's nearly a raspberry, lips vibrating together, a clear dismissal of Steve's concerns. "We've fought gods, and the guy who literally destroyed half the universe. Redskull is small fry."
"Why the hell do you want to go to sleep? This is serious! Stark, I need to get back where I'm supposed to be, not go for a nap with you," Steve snaps, thrown by Tony's cavalier attitude. The guy just got told his husband doesn't know why or when they got married, anyone else would already be on their way to the hospital.
Steve rolls over to find Tony next to him. It never gets old. He wraps his arms around his husband and tries to drift back off.
"The stick up your ass," Tony replies promptly. Steve's almost offended by the laziness of the insult. "Anyway, let's get this show on the road. People Eater, we're not leaving without those stones, and while still very large and..." he waves his hand around at Thanos. "Intimidating? Is that the right word? No, wait. Insane. That's the word I was looking for. You're large and insane, but we got a group of heroes and even a couple of villains here and you don't have power over the gauntlet anymore. I'm willing to bet that handling the stones all at once without it will kill you just as dead as it would anyone else, and we nearly beat you when you control of three at once."
"Like what? Did it hurt when you fell from heaven? Hey, I'm a director and I want to put your face on the silver screen? I'm shipping out on a dangerous mission tomorrow and this could be my last night alive?" Tony tried.
Another week and Steve's ready to pull his hair out. They've run out of tests. Tony tries his best to reassure Steve when he voices his frustrations, but no matter how many assurances he gives it doesn't change the reality that no one can figure out what's going on with Steve. Or that, increasingly, the only person who doesn't think it's a memory issue is Steve himself. Tony says he's keeping his mind open, but he's thought there was no world swapping right from the start, for all his help in putting Steve in contact with anyone who might be able to prove otherwise.
True to his word, Tony spends the next two weeks dragging Steve into home cooked meals, trips to the movies, a walk around Central Park, a trip to a coffee shop in Brooklyn that this world's Steve liked, and to anywhere and anything that might trigger Steve's supposedly missing memories. Tonight they were going out for dinner.
"At the hospital. He's fine. He's good. You saw him yesterday, remember?" Tony says gently. His face is getting more and more drawn with concern, the lines around his eyes tightening as he searches Steve's face for evidence of what's wrong.
"You're also insanely thoughtful and generous, and I don't just mean with your money, occasionally funny, and yes, you do have a the hottest bod," Steve said.
Tony scrubs at his face and tries to sit up, ending up propped up against the headboard looking only mildly more awake than he was a minute ago. "Honey. we haven't been in space in weeks. We haven't been to Wakanda for a little while either. And clearly I am not missing, I am right here, just like I was last night and the night before."
"We may as well use everything at our disposal," Strange says and turns to Tony. "Bring him to the sanctum when Dr. Cho has finished her examination." With that he strides out, cloak swirling behind him in a way that it shouldn't be able to do in a small, windless space.
Earth is still reeling, and Nebula's presence goes either unnoticed or is so far down the list of priorities that no one bothers them. The same probably couldn't be said for Redskull were he among them rather than tied up on the ship with one or more of them taking turns to guard him.
"For the love of- Yes!" Tony said. "Yes, I have been hitting on you, repeatedly and obviously. I thought that was clear."
"So yeah, I put this together in case it was me that got the iffy memory, and then I just kept it going because why not?" Tony concludes.
"I mean, when the Avengers are unanimous and get the Winter Soldier to voluntarily surrender himself, it pulls a lot of weight. Not to mention Ross's piss poor management of the Zemo situation," Tony says. "If you hadn't already told me about my parents months before Zemo's stupid plan, who knows what might've happened? The guy was trying to bust up the Avengers and Ross was practically complicit!"
Tony meets him by the entrance, somehow having got dressed without returning to the bedroom to do so and dangling car keys from his fingers. "Let's go."
"Captain Stark's blood pressure and pulse are elevated, but within safe parameters. Scanning for additional information now," JARVIS replies. And of course it was JARVIS. Steve should have connected that dot sooner, but it's been so long since he heard JARVIS' voice.
Steve forcibly pushed down the implications of 'pretty people' and lack of sleep. What Tony did was Tony's business, and it didn't change anything. "Sounds like you had a good time."
"Scan complete. Captain Stark is in perfect health. No abnormalities detected," JARVIS says after a moment. "Would sirs like me to start the coffee machine?"
"He's pretty unique looking," Tony says. "It didn't take much to piece it together when Nebula told me."
Tony's in his bed, or rather, he's in Tony's bed. He doesn't even recognise the room he's in. How did this happen? How is it possible? He went to bed in Wakanda, worn out from grief and fighting and the utter devastation of having lost. Thanos won.
"So," Bucky said, dropping a tomato onto the cutting board in front of him. "What's your move now, lover boy?"
Nebula steps forwards. "I have not held one, but I have had exposure to the stones for years. I only need to survive long enough to undo Thanos' work."
Tony's face did something funny before settling on a grin. "You'd be surprised." He shifted to face Steve a little more. "I'll admit, my pickup lines are a little rusty. I don't usually need 'em. We could just skip ahead to the making out."
Steve doesn't even ask about 'Captain Stark'. If he asks any more questions about the strangeness of this place he won't be able to stop, and right now thinks the priority is answering three major questions: Where is he, how did he get here, and how can he get back? And JARVIS scanning him might help answer at least one or two of those questions.
"Weren't expecting... Seriously, you had no radar whatsoever for when someone's putting the moves on you, do you?" Tony said. "No wonder your friend thinks his purpose in life is to be your overbearing wingman, he's probably worried about this exact situation happening. Maybe if he was there for all our interactions we'd have avoided a lot of awkwardness."
"Shuttup," Steve mumbled, feeling himself flush in annoyance and a little embarrassment. "I just... thought you were humouring me."
"Finished already?" Tony asks, a teasing glint in his eye. "I would offer you some of mine... but it's just so damn good, you know?"
It takes him several moments of slowly coming around in a cocoon of heat and comfort and what feels like it must have been actually decent sleep, before he realises the source of the warmth is lying next to him and not his own trapped body heat in the covers. His eyes flicker open, a confused frown already creasing his sleep lax face.
"C'mere." Tony sits up straight and pulls Steve in so he's the one on Tony's shoulder. Steve doesn't resist. "Wanna tell me what flavour it was?"
When Steve finally brought himself to explain what had happened to Bucky the only reaction he got was Bucky's shaken head and a quiet 'jesus'.
He'd told Tony about his parents, Bruce was still around, Ross was off the Accords, Bucky was in hospital...
"Can someone get him out of here?" Tony asks of those not about to wield a stone. "Or at least make him shut up. I can't afford to be distracted by his self righteous posturing."
"I am only entrusting this to you as I have learned to fear the power of the stones," Redskull adds.
"Earth," Tony says. "Pick up Dr. Foster. I know Thor wants to do it, but he's on Loki duty, and if he's around I'll never get to talk science to her."
"Hi, I'm Virginia," the second redhead introduced herself. "I ruptured my previous bosses' scrotum."
The dish arrives a short time later, and Steve has his suspicions about how fast their order was completed but isn't about to complain. The sooner he can get out of here the better.
When they'd finished, Steve made his way over to Virginia and plucked up the courage to ask, "Where's Tony?"
"We need everyone who's ever held a stone and lived," Tony explains. "Unfortunately there are less people than stones at this point, but we'll just have to try and hope for the best."
He isn't at all surprised to see on the emergency broadcast channel, the only one still currently running with any consistency, saying that S.I is organising emergency power and accommodation for those who need it, power and equipment for the emergency services, and a list of other facilities and resources . It's not a PR piece or a news item, not a story, just an update on where people can get help. For once Steve gives some thought to how much effort that must have taken, how much work Miss Potts and the newly returned Tony must have put into it to get it all up and running so quickly. He wonders if Tony already had contingencies in place for a disaster of this magnitude, and then with the thought is convinced that he did. Tony's been predicting this for a long time. That's what Ultron was all about after all.
Tony raised his eyebrows at the clear subject change but went with it anyway. "Sure. Anything I like the look of."
The car is less flashy than most of those Steve's seen Tony drive, but still undoubtedly expensive. The interior still smells new, and the seat heats around Steve while the air conditioning keeps a fresh breeze around his face.
"Actually, I kinda do," Tony tells him. "You're not all there right now, and the doctors would agree with me in a heartbeat. I'm your husband, second in command on the team, and I have power of attorney. If I say you're not going on the field until you're psychologically cleared, then our bosses, our teammates and pretty much everyone who counts will back me up on this."
Steve can't help the broad grin that spread across his face at that. Of course Tony already has a plan. Hopeless or not, it's not in Tony not to try. It's one of the things he lo- One of the reasons Steve had enjoyed being married to the other Tony. The grin drops at the thought at what he's left behind, and the bittersweet thought that if he's here, then that Tony should have his real husband back slips into his head. "Just tell us what you need."
"Steve," she said, looked Bucky and Peggy over with a sceptical but unsurprised expression and turned to walk away without another word.
Peggy pursed her lips in a way Steve knew was a precursor to something she didn't think he wanted to hear. "You moved back in?"
Tony shrugs. "I'll give Strange and Richards each a call. If they can't help, I'll call Foster and Thor and ask them if they think it's Aether related."
Steve thinks over his options for a moment. He can't really complain about Tony benching him without letting Bucky know why Tony is benching him. Distraction it is. "What is there to do around here?"
When it became clear Tony was taking his usual seat after all Natasha took the one next to Steve. When Fury entered he looked genuinely surprised to see the small swap around in seating arrangements but said nothing, taking his usual chair and calling their attention to him. "So far we've concentrated on figuring out what sets you off, what the roots of your behaviour are. This time we're going to be working on actual techniques to keep control when those triggers are pushed."
"Hipster?" Steve asked despite himself. He had never thought of that word as coming within five miles of describing him.
"I wanted to make a difference," Steve continued. "To help people. But they turned me down. Not much use for someone like me, I couldn't pass the physical."
Bucky looked him over and turned back to the fridge to pull out the rest of the ingredients he needed. "It looks like you already did the job for me a few times over."
Steve memorises the number she recites, then hangs up as politely as he's able with the buzz building under his skin. His thumb hovers above the call button for an interminable amount of time before he can bring himself to press it. And then he waits.
Steve turns over feeling warmer than he has since the ice. Something inside him has felt like it's never thawed out, and usually when he wakes up it's either in cold sweats or feeling like he used to in his old Brooklyn apartment in the middle of winter when the heating gave out. So the warmth is a novelty.
The raccoon, Rocket, agrees to ferry Steve off into space after a long argument in which Steve eventually manages to convince him that Tony is their best hope at fixing this. That the man who is with him, Dr. Strange, is their second best shot. Natasha and Thor insist on going with him.
"Mhmm," Tony replies. "Ridiculously decadent dessert that this restaurant does spectacularly well. Try some."
"Doesn't matter," Steve said, already cursing himself for taking it this far but unable to back down as always.
Tony waved a hand up and down Steve's body. "That's why he didn't want to let you in. It's the clothes."
"Yeah, sure. But your knowledge of our team and our enemies and our fighting tactics is not all there," Tony argues. "Hell, if the Maximoffs broke out are you going to tell me you'd help us get them locked up again without hesitation?"
Steve can't help the small smile that gets from him. When did Tony start making him smile instead of frown? "I don't know. I just... I don't want to be alone right now."
It's claustrophobic as always, the noise and the small space and not being allowed to move, but it's over relatively quickly.
"We think once the stones are connected through us, that she'll be able to control it a little. Enough, anyway," Tony says. "With the help of the mind stone."
"Just... so I know...," Tony said in between the pulling apart and meeting of their lips, "this isn't... just... a sex thing... right? I mean... it's fine if it is... but it doesn't.... feel like... just a sex thing."
"Which is why we gathered up the people who've survived it before," Tony says, which, yes, Steve had known that but...
Nebula traces her fingers over the orange coloured stone without touching it. "My sister died to give Thanos his power," she says, seemingly mesmerised by the stone. "I searched every one of Thanos' data stores for a way to bring her back."
"That's good, Buck. I'm glad to hear it," Steve says softly. He knows the Bucky from back home hadn't got more than an hour at a stretch since he broke his programming. He never got the chance to figure out a way to sleep through the night.
It was a massive shock to Steve when the session started and the guy with the eyepatch turned out to be their therapist. Out of everyone present, if Steve had had to put money on who might actually kill someone it would have been the eyepatch guy, who introduced himself as 'Fury', no first or last name, whichever 'Fury' wasn't, and no suffix. The irony of the name was not lost on Steve.
"You want to take over the negotiations? Go ahead," Tony snaps. "I'm sure your sheer Captain America-ness will get you anything you want as usual. Try not to move about too much in case you dislodge it though."
"Why, Steve Grant Rogers, are you trying to get into my pants on our first date?" Tony held his hand over his heart as if affronted.
Thor, Natasha and Rocket meet them back on Earth with a bigger ship that should hold everybody. Apparently even deposed Kings of Asgard get perks.
A moment later and Steve is back in his body. Or rather the body of the Steve from this world. "Is that it?"
"Only Jane's held a stone for more than a moment directly, and there aren't enough former wielders. There are six stones and only three survivors," Steve points out.
"Oh, that." Tony takes the phone back. "It's one of my favourite spots to eat out in public. You're inaccessible enough to avoid the crowds, you don't have to dress up, and it never fails to get that vein in Fury's head pumping."
He had a point, Steve had to admit. And boy did it make him feel guilty. Group was supposed to be a safe place and he made it the opposite for Tony. Not that Tony hadn't turned around and done the same to Steve. Still. "So why be nice to me now?"
The 'Family Album' is a collection of stills taken by Tony's HUD, photographs by the team themselves and the general public, news items, and even a couple of voice clips recorded over the comms.
His phone rings and he digs it out of his backpack with some difficulty, finding it to be the old flip phone SHIELD first gave him as a stepping stone to the pocket sized computers everyone else was using. He flips it open and answers without checking who's calling. It doesn't matter at this point, anyone that has the number should be able to answer at least some of his questions.
Strange circles him, scrutinising him. He finishes up back in front of Steve. "There are differences. But if you are indeed from a parallel world, it must be one incredibly close to this one. Have you had any previous experience of inter-dimensional travel?"
Tony's waiting for him in a car that looks like the kind of thing Steve always sneered at, but is so comfortable to sit in that Steve really can't find it in himself to complain, or even dredge up another 'overcompensating' joke.
"It could be worse," Tony said, though he didn't explain how. "Hey, if you want I could give you the numbers of some supermodels. Maybe then your friend would stop hassling you over getting a date."
At last Steve managed to make his feet carry him across the short distance between them, and after barely a moments further hesitation he leaned up to press his lips to Tony's. It was a dry, soft kiss that, while pleasant, didn't really prove anything, so Steve leaned in further, pressing harder and catching Tony's top lip between his own. He glanced up into Tony's eyes before allowing his own to drift closed, enjoying the sensation and the way his heart was beginning to race even harder than it had in the nervous moments leading up to the kiss. He let his hands drift up to frame Tony's face, pulling him in deeper and stepping in even closer.
Tony takes a swig of said beverage. "It doesn't affect you, and I'm so addicted by now this amount is more likely to send me back to sleep than to keep me awake."
"It sure is a shame you're giving them back," Bucky said, shaking his head. "I wouldn't even have to try to set this guy up."
It's a space station barely big enough to deserve the name, and Rocket goes to haggle docking fees with the guy in charge, Thor at his heel for intimidation purposes. Apparently around here a raccoon isn't likely to get good prices but a good looking well muscled god helps.
Bucky scanned him with raised eyebrows. "Well, damn, Stevie. This what you've been hiding under khakis and oversized shirts all these years?"
"Thank you for sharing," Fury said drily. "You will, however, still be learning to count to ten and talking about your daddy issues. Steve, you're up."
"Stark?" He asks in a voice more rough from the sudden overwhelming grief and shame he feels than the lingering sleep in his system.
By the time he takes a break it's well past lunch time, and his body reminds him that effort like he exerts regularly needs equally regular meals. He wants to keep going, the guilt driving him almost to tears as he lifts chunk after chunk of concrete, beam after beam of the building's frame, but the firefighters around him urge him to take a break with steady, grim reassurance that there'll be plenty for him to do later that he'll need his strength for.
"Well duh. I like to think I know my husband from just any old Steve," Tony says with an exaggerated eyeroll.
Bucky joins him not long after, dressed in soft clothes, with his hair loose around his face but clean and neat and healthy looking in a way Steve hasn't seen it in forever. He's not as skinny as last time Steve saw him in Wakanda either, not gaunt or sallow or tired looking.
"I'd really like-" Steve broke off, needing to do his best to win Tony over before he lost his chance, but not sure if he should given the resigned look on Tony's face that even the glasses couldn't quite cover. "I'm sorry for what I did, and there's no excuse-"
"Welcome to our world," Virginia muttered under her breath. Given the way she immediately attached herself to Tony, Steve was inclined to ignore her too.
Tony shrugged. "Same old. Lots of money, lots of meetings, lots of pretty people, not a lot of sleep."
"Is something wrong?" Tony asked. "Because you're acting... if there's something wrong we can... I mean, it's just a first date, no pressure, you know?"
Begrudgingly, Steve took the clothes and headed back into the bedroom. He dumped them on the bed with as much care as he could muster and went to get a towel for a shower. If the shirt was really silk he was not doing anything to risk messing it up before he could return it.
"Just you is fine," Steve says and means it. He wishes he could have Bucky there too, but Bucky is where he needs to be and Steve isn't selfish enough to really want that to change. "Can we... I don't want you to take this the wrong way, I'm not... I just don't want to be alone, it's not..."
Steve didn't know if the strong urge he had to move away was stronger or weaker than the strong urge he had to move closer. Instead of doing either he just stayed frozen, caught up in the smirk on Tony's lips and the heat where their bodies were pressed close.
"Yeah, well, I guess that's what happens when you've got a gorgeous husband to snuggle up to at night," Bucky teases. "Must be real good at keeping the bad dreams away."
Bucky laughs. "Don't ask me. He's a swell guy, but you fellas can tear each other down like nobody's business."
Tony stopped and turned, that stupid smirk still on his face. "Says the guy with an actual anger management problem."
Tony sighs. "Yeah, I know. But I don't know how to get around this one. I won't put the team at risk because you don't like being sidelined. I won't put you at risk, either. I know you can take care of yourself, but there's so much about the way we operate that you just don't know anymore."
"Yeah," Steve says faintly. "Yeah, I'm just... Processing. Things happened a lot differently where I'm from."
Steve felt everyone's eyes settle on him as he entered, and tried not to dwell on the amused looks most of them had at the sight of him. He knew he must look ridiculous, a tiny guy who could be knocked down by a stiff breeze here to learn to control his anger issues. He couldn't help but meet the eyes of one of the men, whose shit eating grin seemed superglued in place and whose eyes were hidden behind obnoxious red sunglasses. It was Fall in New York. No one needed sunglasses on, and definitely not indoors.
Steve nods dumbly, forcing his thoughts away from the word 'husband' and what it implies. Once Tony's out of the room, Steve gets out of the bed himself and digs around until he finds a t-shirt he recognises as his own along with a pair of joggers in his size. He glances to the window, which is either tinted black or is showing an unusually late sunrise for this time of year. "JARVIS? Could you scan the, um, the mansion?"
While Steve was still trying to work out exactly what Thor was on about, Fury called an end to the exercise.
"What? No. I don't want them. What would I do with them?" Tony said, pushing the box back towards Steve.
"I do want this, I-" Steve cut himself off as Tony's pointed look zeroed in on his mouth. "Oh." Right. Well, it was how he'd tried to determine if Tony was really interested.
"Erection, Steve. I have an erection," Tony says. "And if you don't want to be involved with it then you really need to let me go now, because it's getting very involved with you already."
"You're not exactly part of the body positivity movement are you?" Tony said with an amused expression. "You know what they say: all bodies are beautiful."
There was a pause of expectant silence while Steve tried to work out why he just said that and where he was going with it. Tony drummed his fingers on his arm and looked at his watch.
Steve breathed out in relief at the implied acceptance. "Well, I hadn't really got all that far. I thought maybe we could try another date. Not at a club though. You could come to my place, I could cook you dinner or something."
At their next group session Tony sat next to Steve and stayed there, and he didn't antagonise Steve even a little bit. Thor gave them both beaming smiles and pats on the back before they left.
So he keeps visiting Bucky, and he keeps letting Tony try to romance him, and he takes up all the responsibilities of this world's Steve and he lives.
Steve cleared his throat and wilfully ignored Tony's existence. "It's just always got to me. People always go one of two ways, 'oh look he's adorable let's patronise him' or 'man, isn't he hilarious thinking he's a tough guy, let's mess with him'. If I have a problem people just brush it aside and pat me on the head, sometimes literally."
"Okay. That's a good start," Tony says. "Do you want me to call Tasha or Bruce or someone to come hang out? Or you good with just me?"
They fall asleep on the sofa, both still in their suits but minus the ties, the take out they picked up on the way home sits half-eaten on the coffee table and JARVIS lets the late night infomercials play while they sleep.
Tony's eyes widen in emphasis as he nods. "Oh yeah. Big time. But we parted on civil terms, and you were willing to go sit in a giant doughnut with me when you came back from your road trip, and I made a real effort to only use pop culture references you knew. We got over it.
"Well, I can't say for sure, but from what you've said, you build each other up the same as you tear each other down," Bucky says, pulling away with an amused smile. "I only ever get to see the fallout of fights so that's the best I can do by way of marriage counselling. But if the pattern holds, you'll be back in here in two days with a grin the size of the moon, acting like you never argued with the guy."
Cho stops her conversation with Strange for a moment. "Given that you don't remember your relationship with Tony, we can gauge that your altered memories go back at least five or six years," she says. "But if you were a different person who'd lived those years differently then we'd expect to see a degree of difference from the last scan you had, and that difference just isn't there. Or at least, not to a conclusive degree. But then if something were interfering with your memory recall, we'd expect to see that when asking you recall questions during the scan, and that also didn't occur. Your brain lights up just the same as it would without any memory impairments."
Fury clearly knew something was wrong by the way he kept narrowing his eye as he looked between them. "Is there some air that needs to be cleared here?"
"Well, yeah," Tony admitted, somewhat baffled by Steve's approach. "But I'm also attracted to blond, skinny idiots with pretty faces and long fingers. I'm a man of many tastes."
"Fuck should I know? You're the one sat up in bed at," Tony rolls to glance at the bedside alarm, "half four in the morning, calling me Stark and acting like a weirdo."
"Good," Fury said in a warning tone. He looked around at the group. "I'm sure I don't have to tell you that everyone gets angry. Every goddamned motherfucker on this planet wants to knock another person's teeth out on a regular basis. The difference between you and them is that they have some goddamned self restraint."
"Sam from the VA up in Washington?" Tony asks, with raised eyebrows. "Sure. I mean, not bestest buddies or anything, but he helped you out with Bucky." He pauses. "You kissed Sharon? Really? Isn't that a little...weird? I mean, she's Peggy's niece, or did you not know that at the time?"
"Physically, in this room, in this building, with... you," Steve says. "I was in Wakanda. The last I knew you were missing. Rhodes said you were in space."
"Yeah, after weeks of making it clear you thought I was an arrogant, self centred jerk," Tony replied.
Steve could admit that throwing the guy's phone on the floor and stomping on it because he was refused to stop talking on it through the movie was probably an overreaction. The kind of thing most people would fantasise about but not actually do. He even got some cheers for it, but he also got a court date for assault and destruction of property. Steve couldn't help but feel he wasn't the only one that overreacted. It was just a damn phone and the guy wasn't injured. This time.
Bucky groaned. "Do you wanna be alone forever? Do you Stevie? 'Cause you're gonna be alone forever if you don't... If you don't..." He frowned, seemingly forgetting what he was saying.
Tony takes a long slurp of his drink, staring at Steve the whole while. He releases the straw and swallows. "Why don't you tell me what we're like in your memories or world or whatever?"
"I..." couldn't argue with that. Steve reluctantly met Tony's eye. "I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said those things."
"Too many people," Nebula replies, voice rougher, harsher than Steve was expecting. "We also need room to hold someone."
Bucky did of course help him with his boy troubles. His lifelong quest to get Steve in a relationship or at the very least laid was not at all affected by new revelations regarding who Steve might be willing to get into a relationship or get laid with apart from that his efforts now had a focus.
"Maybe," she says. "Having been a part of the stones, having died for one of them, I can tell you that isn't certain. Life and death aren't as defined when you have control of the universe."
Steve shook his head. He hadn't admitted to himself that that was the case until just then, after all Peggy's pushing.
"He's in my sessions," Steve said, though he was fairly sure he wasn't supposed to be disclosing that.
"If that happens then I'll still be me, I'll still know how to fight, how to look after myself and the team, and you can get me off the field as soon as possible," Steve says. Tony seems to be softening and he doesn't want to give him enough time to think himself out of it.
Thor wasn't the only member of the group to like Tony. Virginia and Bruce had hit it off with him from the first and second sessions, and the others all seem only too happy to laugh at his jokes and swap witty one liners and friendly insults. Even Jessica seemed to get on okay with him. They were all friendly towards Steve, too, but somehow their agreeableness with Tony only made Steve more annoyed with the man.
Steve looked down at the newspaper in his hand. There was a story about Tony that Steve lacked the context to understand, and a picture of Tony outside the club the night before. Steve could be seen to the edge of the picture.
Bucky didn't look convinced but didn't press the issue any further, instead opting to go back to scouting out potential hook ups for them both.
When the judge ordered court mandated anger management sessions Steve could already see the expressions on his friends' faces without turning to look. Bucky would be trying to hold back a laugh, and Peggy would look resigned and not at all surprised. She'd been telling him he needed to get his head shrunk for years.
"She's inside the stone?" Steve repeats, gaining nods in reply. "Alright, but how does that help us?"
"Damn," Tony muttered, staring at Steve and not releasing him from where he was held against Tony's body.
A petulant part of him wanted to ignore everything Strange had said, annoyed that the man had virtually promised answers and then given none. But the question of why someone would do something like this to him was a valid one. It seems highly unlikely that any of this is an accident. But how could this possibly benefit anyone?
Steve aimed a loose slap behind him and set the box down on the kitchen chair to pull out the clothes. When the trousers were removed Steve spotted a smaller box, this one containing a pair of shiny black shoes when he opened it. A nagging suspicion grew, creeping up Steve's spine. "I didn't order these."
Virginia rolled her eyes, but she was suppressing a fond smile. "Happy won't be here with the car for another fifteen minutes," she said casually, as if it was only an update.
Steve shrugs helplessly. "I didn't really have anyone. I..." He glances at Tony and away again before continuing, "I kissed Sharon Carter one time. Sam Wilson? Are we friends here?"
"Energy can't be destroyed. It can be dissipated or displaced, but not destroyed. You can't ever go back to our world," Gamora tells him. "I suppose in that way, you have died. You used up all the potential you had in that world, there isn't room for you in it anymore."
"What isn't wrong with them?" Tony scoffed. "They're the wrong size, they look like something a suburban father of three would wear, and your shoes look like the bastard children of a pair of sneakers and a pair of funeral shoes."
Steve laughed. "I guess that's one upside of this whole thing. If by some miracle Tony forgives me and agrees to go out with me then there'll be at least one area of dating I'm more experienced than you in."
Steve resisted the urge to argue. There was no way Tony would believe him if he tried to say his self-esteem wasn't that bad. "Sure."
Other world's Steve had had to punch one of them out. That's what other Tony had said. Even without him, Tony had got so close to defeating Thanos. And if he hadn't have experienced the other world, Steve probably would have thought the guy was just exaggerating.
Steve finally turns away from the breakfast bar to look at Tony properly. "Let me train with the team, read old mission reports. I'll catch up."
"I guess? I mean, no stone unturned and all, but lets save that plan for a last resort, right up there with giving Asgard a call and asking to chat to Loki," Tony says.
Tony waved him off. "Just a little gay panic. We're fine. So... what exactly did you want to happen here?"
He has no awareness of his body or even where his eyes are pointed, but there's a green skinned woman filling his vision. Steve's abruptly reminded of Tony, years ago, ranting about green skinned space women and whether Thor knows any.
Bucky pulled an offended expression. "I'm your best friend, your wingman. I helped you write and practise your apology speech."
"It's noon, they've had all night and half the day," Bucky said, laughter still coating his words. "You've slept half the day away. I'm gonna have to take you out more often if it gets you living like a normal person."
"Where's Bucky?" Steve asks, unable to face responding to Tony's sudden kindness, especially given the strangeness of the situation.
"Okay, so today we're gonna make some robots. Sound cool?" Tony said. In actual fact Tony had brought in ready made units that the kids could customise with whatever limbs they wanted. He'd insisted it would take too long to do the whole thing from scratch and the kids would still get to connect the wires and power source and all other kinds of 'educational goodies'. He'd discussed it at length with the center's manager until her eyes glazed over and she politely excused herself. It was the first time Steve ever saw someone bored by Tony.
Steve, as he has been doing for the past forty minutes, thinks about the Tony he remembers. Thinks about Pepper and Sharon, about the Accords and Bucky and Zemo, Ultron and Tony's parents, and can't wrap his head around the idea that in this world Tony and Steve had come through that as a married couple. "Are we happy?"
"Oh, like you're one to talk," Tony says dismissively. "Mr. I-signed-up-to-be-injected-with-an-unknown-substance-by-dodgy-government-types. At least I knew what I was injecting myself with."
Steve looks at the man in front of him and imagines what it must be like to be the other Steve, to live this life and know it's his. "You said you've been married two years. How long have you been in a relationship with... other Steve?"
"Good. When you have the time, we've come up with some options for you for a cover so you don't have to be Captain America in public. We also have a shortlist of possible living accommodations," Hill tells him. "Drop by and we'll go over them."
Tony smiles a little at that and when he speaks his voice is soft, full of pain and painful understanding. "I know. And I won't push. But I'm not giving up, not yet. I know you can feel that way because you did, and it made us both happy, so unless you're dead set against it I'm going to keep trying. If I have to let you go then I need to know that I did everything I could."
"True," Tony says. "But Loki would have plenty reason to pretend that Thanos managed to off him when he didn't. The whole thing could have been a trick to stop Thanos from actually killing him. You can't say it wouldn't be in character. Did you actually get a good look at the body yourself? Poke it a bit?"
Steve's whole body is clenched, teeth to fists to stomach. "That's not for you to decide. You don't have control over me."
Tony's face went through a serious of expressions that Steve might call calculating if he wasn't doing his best not to think so badly of Tony lately. Truce and all that. Finally Tony spoke. "Having PTSD is what happens when a person undergoes trauma. It is not always debilitating and it doesn't stop me from being the smartest person in any given room. It's been over two years now. Let it fucking drop. If I was a wounded war vet all anyone would be talking about is how brave I am for putting myself out there, how strong I must be to keep battling with it every day and still work my ass off running my own company. No one would ask if I should be sectioned or have my company taken away. So fuck you. Fuck your gaslighting bullshit and your obsolete ideas about mental health. Whatever nightmares I wake up from at least I'm not a deluded prick who can't see reality."
"You're not listening!" Tony snaps. "I don't think you are some other Steve. I don't think he is lost out there somewhere. We've not had a battle or an encounter with a weird object in over a month! A month, Steve! Whatever is going on with you I want it fixed every bit as much as you do, but Strange is a Doctor, a neurosurgeon actually. He'd tell me to get you examined first anyway and send him the scans. Richards would probably want the same thing before he did anything, and I'm not too keen on bringing him in as it is. I told you I'll call them and I will, but we're doing this first."
Virginia nodded. "He'll be back tomorrow. I'm supposed to collect him from the airport." She paused. "You can come along. But if Tony wants you gone, you leave. Understood?"
Tony wakes up to a face full of hair that smells like expensive shampoo. He wraps his arms tighter around his newly wedded wife and tries not to dwell on what it cost to get them here. The world's been set right. That's all that matters.
"So why not become a nurse, or volunteer with the homeless?" Tony asked, the first words he'd spoken directly to Steve that day. "I don't know where you got the idea that shooting people is the only way to help, but come on, even you have to have realised there's other shit you could do."
Steve didn't have the guts to try to contact Tony in any way after that. He had a cellphone number Tony had given him when they agreed to go out, but calling it or even just texting seemed a far more challenging task than it should be. He had no idea what he'd even say. So group rolled around again, and it was like a truce had never been called. Worse, because now it wasn't just Tony but also Bruce and Virginia who kept fixing him with disappointed or hostile glares.
Tony blinked again. "What?" He looked over the box, before recognition lit in his eyes. "Oh! Right. I forgot about this." He raised the lid and peered in. "I was more than a little drunk when I ordered these. And if it helps, my AI took your measurements and got your address to organise the delivery without me being involved. I don't know where you live. I mean, I could find out, but I don't currently know."
"You know what I mean," Steve says and kisses his husband, not letting up long enough for Tony to derail the sappy moment.
"Are you..." Steve started to ask, then changed his mind. Tony was just joking around and Steve didn't need the humiliation of calling him on it. "Are you going to buy much at the auction?"
Thanos smiles again, and even Steve has to forcibly repress a shudder. "The gauntlet may be gone, but the stones are still powerful enough that I can't let them fall into the wrong hands. Even if the use of them would kill you."
"Hell if I know, I've only met the guy once," Bucky said. "I guess I do have more dating experience than you though."
"We came to bring you home," Natasha says, coming up in front of Steve, probably to lessen Tony's threat perception. "Thor's here, too. Bruce is back home with Pepper."
"Okay, let's get this show on the road," Tony says and they all reach for their stones at the same time.
If he's not this world's Steve, which he's no longer sure of, then he wants to be. Husband and all. No reservations.
After that Steve spends nearly two hours being poked and prodded and asked questions that have nothing discernible to do with the situation but that Dr. Cho seems oddly interested in. She finishes at last, or rather Tony asks her if the other stuff she wants to do is relevant to the situation and not the serum and she doesn't answer so Tony grabs Steve by the elbow and tows him out of the buildling. Steve would shake him off, but he's more than happy to go.
Tony opens his eyes at last, though the squint they open into barely classes as open. "You talking to me?"
Steve swallowed and thought about his own world where even if he gets back and even if Tony's alive, that can't happen. "What about Pepper?"
Tony watches him for a moment, eyes calculating, mind turning almost visibly behind his pensive expression. "Fine. You study up, train with the team, and we'll see where we go from there. But I'm not clearing you until I have reason to think it's safe. I already lost my husband, I can't lose you completely. Can't and won't."
"I was in a hospital room. It was dressed up to look like the forties, but I knew something was off. The radio was playing an old game, and everything smelled wrong," Steve begins. "The nurse came in, and she was just... off. I wondered if I'd been captured, so I made a break for it."
"True," Strange concedes. "Or maybe who you sleep with really does have that much impact on the world." He seems amused by the idea. "Or maybe you didn't really go anywhere, and this is where you've always been. Altering your mind would certainly be easier than transporting you to another reality."
Steve laughs and gets out of bed. Getting the coffee is the least he can do. "I'd have thought you'd be more excited that I got my memories back."
"Because this isn't exactly the first time we've done this, Steve," Tony says. "I had that head injury where I lost two months of memory, you had that spell put on you that made you think you were back in the forties, and those are just in the last year. Not to mention the nightmares. I get that it's serious, and I get that you're scared, but half of the stuff we've been through that's anything like this wore off after a couple of hours. We know you're healthy, we know we're safe. Maybe we should just wait it out a little while before we start panicking."
Bruce shifted awkwardly as all eyes turned to him. "The gas station attendant was chatting with the guy in front of me. I just wanted to pay and get out of there."
He really should have remembered that the Maria Stark Foundation, the major donor for the center, was under the purview of one Tony Stark.
"I didn't even know you liked guys," Steve said faintly, still trying to reconcile Tony's revelation with his preconceptions.
It was fun in the end. Needless to say, Bucky did an appalling job of being a wingman and ended up seeing Steve to a cab before leaving in another direction with a leggy brunette whose name Steve didn't catch and probably wouldn't get to hear again.
"And I only did as sort of a test, to see if he actually liked me," Steve explained. "It was a dick move."
Steve sighed, already feeling done with the argument. "And yet I bet you're attracted to slender, fit, tall women with the kind of looks you see on magazine covers."
Steve pulls over and gathers himself, taking one breath after another as he scans for any sign of where the stones have dumped him.
"Your first selfie, I believe," Tony says, shaking his head. "A whole road trip across the United States and not one selfie. I consider that to be the moment you truly became a part of the twenty-first century."
"But I do like you back," Steve cut him off. "That's the thing. I didn't realise it before. Didn't let myself I guess. I was too busy worrying about why someone like you would even be speaking to me, but I realise it now. And that's why I'm here. Other than the apology."
Steve can't fight the way his fists curl and clench, feeling a shudder work its way down his body, slow and cold. "He's dead."
Steve didn't go home with a phone number this time, but he had to admit that was at least partially down to his lack of interest. He'd barely tried to talk to the girl Bucky pushed at him, and as always he didn't dance. The girl probably thought he was a total stick in the mud. It didn't bother Steve half so much as it bothered Bucky.
Prepped with a full speech explaining his behaviour and his recent epiphany as well as a full apology complete with 'how can I make it up to you', Steve strode into the next anger management session with a sense of purpose. Until the session began and Tony remained absent.
"No, I mean," Steve clenched his hands around the plastic chair seat, "I mean you. You're making me angry."
"It's home," Steve says, though he's got to admit, the temptations of this world are great. Bucky's alive and doing well, Steve's not a fugitive, the Avengers never split up, Ross isn't a problem anymore. And what does he have waiting for him back home?
From pulling up outside the restaurant to sitting at their table, Steve was questioning whether this Tony really knew his husband, but the second the server who took their order (something in French that despite his rough fluency, Steve wasn't quite sure of beyond something that sounded suspiciously like 'gateau') leaves Tony turns sparkling eyes on him. "Don't give me that look. I swear, this place does your favourite food ever."
Tony smiles tiredly. "And what if you lose it all again? We don't know how your head got scrambled in the first place, there's no way to know if it'll happen again. It could happen in the middle of a battle."
"And that's supposed to make it okay that you risked your life for no good reason?" Steve asks, though he begrudgingly admits, if only to himself, that it is a pretty good result.
They're walking back from the movie Steve pressed Tony into taking him to, despite Tony's grumblings about having his own home movie theatre in the mansion, and Tony's ripping holes in the plot of the movie in a way that would normally drive Steve up the wall. Instead he laughs at Tony's comments, realises that maybe it's actually a sign that Tony enjoyed the movie, that he's invested enough to care about these stupid little details.
Steve reaches up to feel the truth of the statement. Lowering the touch over his face finds the beard back in place as well.
"Why did you ask me here?" Steve asks. Surely the astral form thing could have been done back at the hospital?
"Or, well, you and Natasha. When Bruce and I first came up with the idea for Ultron, you both insisted that we do any work on quarantined servers," Tony tells him. "I blamed it on you watching Terminator for the first time not long before, but given the alternative I guess I owe Skynet an apology. Ultron only managed to get out after we knew he was a thing. He went after JARVIS, but I managed to get him backed up before Ultron could do too much damage. Vision was made with some of the code left of what Ultron thought were the only copies of Jay."
Tony's clearing a blob of ketchup from his bottom lip when Steve finally gets out of his head enough to ask, "How did this, us, happen?"
"My move? My move is to pretend it never happened and try to ignore that he hates me now," Steve said.
Tony raises his eyebrows but doesn't argue. "Alright. Anything you want to know about besides how you could ever make the mistake of marrying me?"
"I think I sorta was," Steve admitted. Between Virginia's attack and Fury's glares at both him and Tony throughout the session he may as well have been.
"Right," Tony said, smiling now. "Or you could order in. I'm two bad days away from a stress ulcer as it is, I think maybe I should avoid foods that can burn a hole through my stomach lining."
Tony brushed by without any indication that he'd noticed Steve's pause. "So, just so I know, what are the parameters of this? What level of groping is permitted here?"
Tony hummed and didn't respond properly for a few moments. "So, I just want to clear up a few things about my relationship with the press. They're scum sucking leeches, which we all already know. But my personal experiences have been having sex tapes and nudes leaked without consent, being harassed while recovering from being held captive in Afghanistan for three months, and being accused of being a mass murderer for my old business partner selling weapons under the table, while simultaneously being attacked for no longer manufacturing or selling weapons. I've been called the Merchant of Death, a manwhore, a lunatic, an alcoholic and drug addict, had reporters sleep with me for a story, break into my dorm at college, try to gain access to my medical records, spy on my personal life, and deliberately provoke me. I am here for the mandated sentence only. I am not here to learn to count to ten or take deep breaths or talk about my daddy issues. My anger is perfectly under control. I just don't feel the need to control it around reporters."
"When we got the stone from Loki's sceptre and the Hulk went crazy and you saw Peggy in the forties and everything went to shit?" Tony says. "That happened for you, right?"
"It's basically a gateau," Tony enlightens him, confirming Steve's suspicions and his earlier attempt at deciphering the name. "Just a very expensive one that happens to be the head chef's signature dish."
"Steve?" Tony sits up fully, meeting Steve's panicked gaze head on. "Hey, it's okay, we're fine. Everybody's fine. You're safe. Whatever it is, we'll deal, okay?"
When the session drew to a close Steve hovered, wondering if he should attempt to approach Tony. A pointed glare from Virginia stopped him.
Tony grinned. "You'll forgive me if I've been a little hesitant to make a move after the last time I tried it."
"How about we just order some food, watch a movie or something and you let me know if I get too handsy," Tony suggested.
They circle up, each person to their allocated stone, until Nebula and Tony are left. Nebula doesn't so much as blink when Tony takes the purple stone in the centre, just mildly goes to stand by the green one.
Steve doesn't try to correct him when Tony leads him to the bed this version's Steve shares with his husband.
Steve nods. As he'd thought. "So you built the Hulkbuster to battle the Hulk and then gave the man who turns into the Hulk piloting access?"
Steve's heart lurches. He turns to look at the glow of the time, date and weather that JARVIS displays on the window every morning. He's skipped forward in time by months.
Steve glares. He doesn't have an answer. He doesn't know what he'd do if he was facing Wanda across the battle field. He'd stop her from hurting anyone, obviously, but could he let Tony and the Avengers hurt her? Could he let them lock her up?
In the end, both Bucky and Peggy came to the airport. They took a cab instead of Peggy's car to avoid the airport parking charges, but they insisted he wasn't getting in the cab without them, and Peggy offered to pay the fare.
Steve wasn't lying when he said he volunteered with the homeless. Twice a month he wheedled out the time to work in the local food bank, and once a week he did an hour of work doing art with the children of homeless families at an outreach center. It was the kind of thing Peggy called sickeningly wholesome with a fond smile before handing over a box of canned goods to take with him.
"So, what now?" Steve asks. Tony and Nebula had been suspiciously vague about this part of the plan, and for once Steve hadn't forced the issue, too concerned with trying to gain Tony's trust. It's probably impossible after what they've been through and done to each other, but Steve has to try. Even if he can't have what that other world's Steve has, he has to at least try to get Tony as a friend.
Steve flipped him off and tried to get his sleep ridden brain to understand the words on the page. In the end he gave up. Tony lived a life so foreign to Steve that he couldn't even understand it by reading it from the papers. He got out of bed, not bothering to get dressed immediately for a change, instead heading to the kitchen for breakfast. Lunch? Brunch? Whatever it was when you've not eaten but it was past midday. He was halfway through peeling a grapefruit when the doorbell rang.
It's a bright, sunny day that contrasts with the world around him so harshly that he feels a little sick as he goes on his run. They arrived the night before and he's trying to stick more or less to the routine he's used to, hoping that small feeling of normal will help. It doesn't. He's barely two minutes into his run before he stops to help a family searching the ruins of their home for their dog. Then again for a group of civilians trying to clear the road of debris so the emergency services have better access. Then to help the fire service dig through an office building for survivors.
Tony twisted to greet Thor, who gave an easy smile and sat in the chair next Bruce without complaint. He turned back to Steve. "Seriously though, it's great to see you out of the granddad clothes. You've got a hot hipster thing going on now, it's way better."
"Look, maybe we've been going about this wrong," Tony says, in yet another pointless attempt at making Steve feel better. "Maybe we shouldn't be focusing on the 'what' or the 'how', maybe the 'who' and the 'why' are more important here."
Tony shrugged non-noncommittally. "It's an ongoing thing. Virginia, think you could bust some more balls for me? The pay is high and the benefits are excellent."
"Sorry," Tony says. "Not helping. Look, tell me that this version of events doesn't line up. Tell me you and me together wouldn't stop Ultron or Thanos. Pick a detail, any detail that you think is impossible or doesn't make sense."
It's technically still mid-morning, but they both order burgers and fries and nothing is said while they wait or while they eat.
Bucky manhandled him into taking off the shirt he was wearing. "Buy something nice yourself and you can wear that. Until then, this is what you've got."
He gets back to work, of which there is just as much as the firefighters had promised, as soon as the food hits his stomach, and he doesn't stop until Tony appears at his elbow when he grabs a drink of water.  He's moved on from the building by then, now working on car pile ups, on being a living Jaws of Life helping the paramedics get access to injured passengers of cars whose drivers were destroyed or were hit by other cars who had. Tony shouldn't have been able to get so close without Steve noticing, but sometime in the other world he'd become so comfortable with and used to Tony's presence that he lost his wary awareness of the man. Tony being close by was natural, comfortable, not worthy of attention when other things held his focus. Because where else would Tony be?
JARVIS is just giving him the results of the scan, a whopping no abnormalities on that front too, when Tony returns, handing Steve a cup of coffee and climbing back onto the bed.
This week he was asked to come in to help cover an event. A major donor was doing a publicity drive to try to get funding for a careers advice and training center to attach to the outreach building where Steve did art. It was a good thing, the event was open to the public and there was going to be a science activity held for the kids that Steve was supposed to help with. Science was never really his subject, but he was assured all he was really needed for was to make sure the kids didn't hurt themselves.
"You should think about it. If you can figure out a 'why', you might be able to figure out a 'who' or a 'what' or possibly even a 'how'," Strange says, walking back to his body.
"Don't give me that look, I got nothing to do with it. It's you and your crazy husband," Bucky protests. "So did you come here to complain or to take your mind off it?"
Thor considered him a moment. "I do not know what Anthony has done to secure your dislike, but I must tell you that I would advise you talk it over with him. He is a very generous and humorous man, I am sure you can put your grievances behind you."
It took very little time to get to the club, but it felt like hours with the awkward silence Steve couldn't find a way to break. Tony played on his phone the entire time and Steve began to feel both vindicated and pissed off.
"Trust me," Tony says, before Steve can figure out whether he most wants to address Tony's arrogance or the fact he didn't 'forget', he's just never been here.
"Tony, your turn to share," Fury said after Clint finished a tangential rant about dog walkers and Starbucks. They weren't going around in a circle today, Fury was picking them out at random and they were expected to just talk about whatever was on their minds. Steve wasn't really sure what the point was, but he hadn't been picked yet and Clint's rant took up enough time that he was hoping he wouldn't have to share today.
"Let me get this right," Peggy said after a few more darted glances. "You asked Tony Stark out on a date as some kind of elaborate game of Gay Chicken?"
Strangely, group seemed to be helping with Steve's anger issues. He wasn't sure how, all they seemed to do was rant about whatever had gone wrong in their day, and he and Tony were forever bickering. But the next time Steve got into a confrontation, this time with some guy who thought he could muscle Steve into paying for his groceries faster, Steve was able to keep his head and politely and firmly tell the guy to wait his turn.
"I'm not an ogre or a Dickens villain you know," Tony said, taking another bite of mac and cheese. "Besides, there's an auction later I need to be here for."
Tony shot him a considering look then dug his phone out of his pocket, going back to typing away at it instead of looking at Steve. "We're good. You can go get on with your life guilt free. See you around. Or not."
Tony's face shut down. "Nice meeting you, Stan." He walked away to where Virginia was waiting by her car and Steve could only glare impotently at his retreating back.
With everything that's happened, Steve is finally welcome in the USA once more, but it's a bitter homecoming. Every street is near empty, all but a few businesses are shut. There's devastation everywhere he looks, from vehicles whose drivers and pilots were the victims of Thanos, to rioting and looting and protesting as people demanded knowledge from a government who didn't have the whole story themselves, to simple neglect as the world came as close to stopping it's spin as it would before its eventual end.
"Fine. Whatever. Sell them on Ebay, donate them to a shelter, I don't care," Tony said. "Please not the Salvation Army though." At Steve's crossed arms he sighed. "Look, I don't mean to brag but I am rich as hell. Buying these was the equivalent to dropping my change by accident at the bar. Taking them back would more of a pain in the ass than anything. Just... take them. Do what you want with them. Wear them, don't wear them. I don't give a shit."
"All in all, if we're acting as a connected gauntlet then we should be able to direct the power through just one person," Tony explains.
"So, much happened since your last visit?" Bucky asks when silence descends. "You rescued any more orphans? Tony revolutionised any new fields?"
"Woah, hey. Stevie, what's wrong?" Bucky asks, hands, both metal and flesh, rubbing up and down Steve's back soothingly. "Has something happened? Are you okay?"
"Why are you such an asshole?" Steve snapped, more than through with the jerk after having to spend an hour in his company.
Tony huffed, covering a laugh. "Can we go back to the part where we were making out and you weren't insulting me?"
"So you did hire Virginia?" Steve asked, because he'd half thought they were sleeping together. Hell, maybe it was both.
Once Bucky's mission was complete and two pretty girls were stood across from them sipping drinks and laughing at Bucky's antics, Steve's mind went back to Bucky's early line of questioning. It wasn't that Steve thought Bucky was right about Tony, more that now that he thought about it Steve kind of wished he was. He told himself it was mostly for gratification. He wasn't lying about the kinds of people Tony dated, he'd seen some of them in magazine headlines just since he'd known Tony. For Steve to rate attention next to people like that... Not to mention that Tony himself was a very good looking fella. If Steve was into guys he probably would be attracted to Tony. He could imagine it quite clearly.
"Hello, friends. I am Thor," the big blond guy announced. He had an accent Steve didn't recognise, and spoke with more confidence and a heck of a lot more volume than anyone else in the room. Considering Fury and Tony that was quite a feat. "I am told I must master my anger to avoid altercations with those who are inebriated."
"You really aren't used to the team being an actual team, are you?" Tony asks. It doesn't sound sharp or accusatory, more sympathetic. "If you don't get your memories back, remind me to dig out the 'family album'. You'll get a kick out of it, I'm sure. All the best team moments, both in and out of battle."
"I have promised that we shall not harm Tony," Thor says in warning, clearly having been updated on the new team dynamics by Pepper.
Another laugh, this one awkward. "Yeah, I don't think those supermodels would appreciate you giving me their numbers."
"Shut up," Steve said. "It's not a real date. He'll either not turn up or he'll make an excuse not to do it again. I'm proving a point."
Peggy looked unconvinced but held her peace. Apparently she'd forced enough confession from him for one day.
Tony greets Thor with a manly hug, and Natasha with a nod before looking at the figure beside Thor. "You're not dead. Colour me shocked and surprised. Who ever would have thunk it?"
Steve knew about the auction. It was a mishmash of things the center itself had produced and donated items of various price brackets. Steve had spent the last few weeks helping the kids in his art group make projects to be auctioned off.
Steve elected not to dignify that with a response. He never got into a fight with someone who couldn't hold their own against him. In all fairness, that wasn't a whole lot of people, but he stood by his principles. And he didn't get physical with women or children, no matter how awful they were.
Steve nodded, though he wasn't really sure what she was saying. He knew he didn't do it to hurt Tony. Even when Tony's very existence grated on him he hadn't wanted to deliberately hurt the man. Well, not more than one solid punch to the face, and even that he wouldn't have carried through on. Probably.
Steve ignored him and finished getting ready, once again in the clothes that Tony bought. He felt a little self conscious wearing them for a date with the guy who bought them, but he was going to pull out all the stops. Tony would have no excuse for rejecting him, he'd have to admit the truth.
When they face Thanos again he seems... content. Like he really did save the world instead of destroying half of it. He smiles at them benevolently and Nebula twitches.
"I wanted to ask if you'd give me the chance to prove it," Steve said with a rueful grin. "I know you've got no real reason to believe me-"
"I just didn't want to leave it until the next group therapy session, if you even turned up, and have to go through another hour of awkwardness before I even had a chance to speak to you," Steve continued.
Bucky shook his head frantically, advancing on to negating hand gestures until Tony caught sight of him and laughed.
Tony rolls his eyes. "Whataya want from me? I'm still half asleep here. My pet names are not going to be up to my usual stellar standards. Now, why don't you tell me why we're even half awake right now?"
"Why?" Steve complained. "Isn't it enough forcing me out to humiliate myself without making me play dress up first?"
Steve closes his eyes for a moment, trying to take some form of reprieve from everything for just a moment. When he opens his eyes, Tony has strategically placed himself closer to an exit, with both Natasha and Nebula between them. It stings. "Why do we need Redskull?"
Nebula looks ready to say her piece as well, but Tony glares her into submission and continues talking. "Whatever. The point is, I won't let you handle the stones because I don't trust you. I don't trust what you'd use them for. Now, if you want to take someone else's place and let them off without the risk to their lives, go ahead. But I'm in the centre."
Tony looked bewildered for a split second before the shit eating grin was back full force. "I'm told I can have that affect."
That's... a little mind boggling honestly. The thought of Tony and Bucky sharing the holiday, Tony agreeing to go in to see Bucky, forgiving him for what happened... Steve honestly can't wrap his head around it. "And Ross just let that happen?"
The next session saw Steve carefully carrying the box in, clothes and tissue paper carefully reinserted, and dumping it on Tony's lap.
Steve may or may not have gone straight from work to go clothes shopping that Monday. He couldn't afford anything like the clothes Tony had bought him, but he took the time to try things on properly, make sure they fitted properly, and even bought the skinny jeans the sales girl pushed on him. It was an embarrassing experience as always, finding clothes that fit him that didn't come from the kids section and enduring the smiles of the sales people who clearly thought he was adorable, but he walked home with clothes he actually thought he looked okay in.
Steve took a breath. He glanced at his friends, both in a display of nerves and to try to gain some reassurance. Peggy smiled at him, while Bucky gave the least subtle thumbs up Steve had ever born witness to. Much as it made him want to slap Bucky around the back of the head, it also brought a smile to his lips and calmed him somewhat. If this all went to hell, at least his friends were here to either get him hideously drunk or force him to into a movie night complete with ice cream and things exploding. Peggy had a comparable level of taste to Bucky in the film department, but while Bucky veered towards romcoms and movies where people got lost on stag and hen nights, Peggy went in hard for implausible explosions, overly elaborate fight scenes and people getting shot.
"That's not quite how that one goes," Steve says, mouth curling into a smile at Tony's antics in a way he wishes it wouldn't. Tony isn't his here. Wasn't in the other world either, really. This one belongs with Pepper, the other with his own counterpart. He's ruined any chance of it being another way.
Bucky was attempting to do something with Steve's hair when Peggy and Angie arrived. Peggy's eyebrows shot up at the sight of him. "You weren't kidding about the clothes."
"Pepper?" Tony holds his gaze for a second, scrutinising. "We didn't stay broken up in your version, did we?"
"Great," Steve said and had no idea what to do next. They'd agreed to make out, but now what? How did they... How did he... Was there a way to make this feel more natural and less painfully awkward?
"Tony?" Steve takes a breath and runs his hand through his hair. It's shorter than he remembers. He hesitantly lets his hand drop to his face. His beard's gone, too. "What the hell is going on?" He mutters to himself.
Tony seems to fight very hard not to pull a face when Steve says 'where I'm from', and he almost manages it. "How'd it go down for you?"
There's a moment where Steve thinks Tony isn't going to answer, that he'll just avoid it and sweep right past it, then Tony rubs a hand over his mouth and steps in close. "If you really are from another world, then we will get you back there and get my husband back. And if you aren't, if you're my husband then I've got to believe that I'll get my Steve back. Even if you don't remember. Even if I've got to somehow make you fall for me all over again, even if we have to start from scratch. Hell, even if this whole thing repeats the second I do and I have to spend the rest of my life convincing you that you want to be married to me. I don't give up on stuff that matters."
Steve nods reluctantly. He'd pretty much come to the same conclusion every time he'd tried to do this himself or with a doctor or team member over the past few weeks.
Tony met Fury's gaze with an easy smile. "Nope," he said, popping the P. "Air has already been cleared. Go ahead. Let's get on with the deep breathing exercises."
"You mean, when you started dating Tony," Strange says with a quirk of the lips. "Odd that that should be the base of the branching timelines."
"Because I'm constantly accosted by people who deliberately provoke me," Tony argued. "I don't pick fights. I finish them."
Steve avoided looking at anyone as he tried to decide whether honesty was the best policy in this case. "I...um," he attempted.
Steve smiled and met Tony's eyes so he knew the next words weren't serious. "Oh, I still think you're an arrogant, self centred jerk."
"Yeah, you know, for the meds," Tony says. He looks at Steve and sighs. "Right. Memory. The meds were Bruce's idea. Something he and Betty worked on a couple years ago as a potential Hulk inhibitor."
That does make Steve grimace. No matter who he's talked to about home, or what the subject of the conversation has been, the comparison is always depressing. Everyone he's talked to about it ends up looking at him like he's crazy for wanting to go back. Maybe he is.
"Keep going," Tony tells him. "We need to be sure. And when you get to post-road trip, don't stop. We need to build up a timeline."
Bucky rolled his eyes and shoved the shirt forward again. "Whatever. Just don't pull off any labels."
Tony did give him a number to reach him on after the Chitauri invasion, if this world holds true to his own up to that point, but it went through Miss Potts before reaching Tony, and Steve would rather not talk to her at the moment.
"Whatever," Steve sulked. He didn't need backup for this. He wasn't that romantically hopeless, no matter what his friend circle seemed to believe. Tony had liked him before without any help from them after all.
Steve looks down at their joined hands. He supposes he shouldn't have expected a huge reaction from Tony, and he didn't really, but despite how deceptively easy it feels, it also feels like letting go. Like admitting that maybe this world's Steve is just Steve, and he's already home. He squeezes tighter.
Tony nodded like this didn't surprise him at all. "And Pep and I will be having words about letting her love of romance movies interfere with her job."
"Banner and I were in space with you?" Steve asks, because that has to be it. The team never broke up. Bruce never left. Of course he and Steve would have found a way to get on that ship with Tony. And if they'd all been together when they faced Thanos... He has a horrible thought. If this Tony still went to space and ended up facing Thanos while he was there, then surely that means the Tony from back home also faced Thanos? And given the fact Thanos then came to Earth and got the last stone, then that means Tony lost, and if Tony lost then he's probably dead. Alone on some dead planet, rotting away in his suit, not even surviving long enough to be turned to ash by Thanos' purge.
"Well, a ship would be a start," Tony says, tossing a scrap back into a heap of similar, equally trashed looking parts. "Ours kinda crashed into bits of the moon Thanos threw at me.
"Well, 'your world' is just sounding better and better by the minute," Tony quips. "If you're right and my husband is back where you came from then I'm going to have to deal with years worth of night terrors and hourly check ins when I get him back."
"It means we're not a perfect couple. We fight, probably more than we should, there are weeks where we barely see each other with my work and your... stuff. I don't take enough interest in your interests, you get too annoyed at my commitments and the time I spend in the lab," Tony shrugs again. "But we're happy for the most part. We make it work."
She nodded and he left, though she waited for the others to likewise exit the room before she turned her smile, now brittle and angry, towards Steve. "I don't want to hear whatever justification you've come up with for what you did. Whatever your reasoning was, it was a despicable thing to do. Tony doesn't need to hear your excuses either. Don't try to talk to him until you're prepared to give a proper apology."
