“See? Tired of having his brother. It just comes with the territory, son. Let Harley pout now about no longer being the baby and later they’ll be thick as thieves. You’ll be wishing they were more separate instead of joining forces and plotting against you two...which...can come from two boys.”
“Remember Harley you have to be gentle,” Steve reminded the boy as he helped the pup climb onto the bed. Not caring about the pain or the stitches, Tony hugged his son, comforting the boy that still had tears in his eyes.
“JARVIS is anyone awake?” he asked the AI once he got on the elevator to the tower, checking his watch to see it was half past six.
“God no, just my dumb ex the same age as me,” Tony said with a chuckle, which changed the sour smell coming from the Omega and made Steve’s inner Alpha purr with delight at the sound.
The two adults groaned in defeat as she saw Peter’s eye light up. Their Dad waved his hands to stop this blackmail from continuing.
“Just like a weekend or something, not long. Just a few days to recharge. In fact,” Steve paused, turning to Tony with a gleam in his eye. “We should go away this weekend, to your private island. It’s our anniversary after all.”
was because we needed to discuss something with you, and I was hoping to do it before dinner.” Joey felt herself freeze at that, not immediately digging into her plate as she watched the two of them carefully.
When Peter didn’t respond, Tony stole another look in the rearview mirror and frowned at the sight. Pete looked on the verge of tears.
“No you won’t,” Steve countered with a fake glare, small smile breaking across his handsome face as he walked over and kissed Tony on his cheek. “But I still like you.”
“That’s so sweet of you Pete, I’m sure she’ll be happy to know you wanted to make sure she was safe and comfy.”
“Dammit!” Joey cried, pulling away from a laughing brunette as Steve groaned in equal annoyance and sighed his husband’s name in disappointment.
“Yeah,” Steve said with a frown he didn’t realize he was sporting. He saw Bucky out of the corner of his eye roll his eyes dramatically.
He reluctantly started reading, rolling his eyes again when his brother leaned against his shoulder to listen as well.
She told him about Xavier, and Cara and even whined to him about Mr. Jefferson. Which he was not happy about, but he also opened up to her about this Stone guy and work drama – even confided in her about how at his next birthday he’ll be older than her Dad had ever been.
“This answer changes every few weeks, fair warning,” Tony interceded, followed by a pout from his pup and a chuckle from the others.
to class, Miss Barnes.” She swallowed her anger, saving it for someone who she can actually take her anger out on.
Tony’s attention was quickly brought back to the man behind him, who had rested his chin on the genius’ shoulders as he watched him finish cleaning the dishes.
Tony had promised that if Sarah and Steve ever died in some freak accident, he would marry his Pop to comfort the man.
“Guys! Guys. I’m not mad at either of you.” The two teenagers stared at him in silence. Steve couldn’t help a small smile before continuing.
“My hero,” Bucky said in a low possessive tone, kissing him fiercely again until they heard Rumlow groan in pain. “Come on, I think it’s time we head to the hotel I rented for the night…” He grabbed Clint’s free hand and pulled him along, past a grumbling asshole and out towards the limo.
Emerson chuckled a little in his lap. “You know Pop, just cause you and Peter are both super people doesn’t mean Dad and I are fragile flowers. We’re both tough cookies. Have faith in your man,” she finished. Steve pulled his head back to laugh loudly.
The braver of the men reached a hand out, resting on her shoulder before he lowered the strap on the dress she was wearing. Luckily, her self-deprecating thoughts were interrupted by a familiar voice.
“Tones, I know, okay? I know how difficult this all is for you, but screaming at your legal team instead of facing your husband is not helping you! And neither is a caffeine drink at nine o’ clock at night, Marcus,” she said with a glare in the assistant’s direction.
“Yeah...yeah of course. I think your Daddy means we have to talk about when’s a good time you can meet him. Okay, bud?” Steve offered, hurt evident in his voice.
"Heck yes I am, I know how delicious this is I just also know what it does to the human body," he said as he helped Miles with his plate.
“I already told you it didn’t bother me Steve.” She folded her arms across her middle, confused and a little irritated at the implication.
“You know, my middle name is Francis,” Clint said next to her as she heard the man behind her let out a puff of laughter. With a frown, she turned around to face him.
“Like...Daddy?” her question brought tears to Clint’s eyes, confusing her further until he brought her back into his crushing embrace.
The adoption ceremony was short notice, so Miles unfortunately didn't get to meet all the Avengers. He still had the time of his life and Peter was beyond happy to have a new little brother.
He looked over to Emerson, who wasn’t making eye contact with either. Peter interpreted her not immediate rejection of the idea as a sign to go. Adding a quick, “sure, Pop” before standing up to leave the room.
“You’re a great sister, Emerson. I’ll help you figure it out,” pulling away a moment later to smile at her. She gave a small smile back, reaching out to take the towel from him. The two cleaned in silence until Destiny’s Child came on, the two teens progressively getting louder as they sang along and even danced a little as they continued cleaning.
“You were never in the circus, silly goose,” Bucky said to Clint, gently patting the sober man on his head.
“So um…I’m going to go stay with Pepper for a day or two.” He could feel Steve’s watery blue eyes look up and bore into him, but he kept his eyes down before continuing. “I’m behind at Stark Industries and I think it’s for the best right now.”
She stood against her bedroom door, growing more frustrated at the sudden anxiety in her stomach and quick intake of breath. Pete was with Wade, her Dad took Miles clothes shopping and her Pop had offered to spar with her. She turned him down because she wasn't in the mood.
“I’ll have you know I was a ruffian myself at her age. Actually, I was twice as bad as her, a few drinks in the daytime really isn’t that bad.”
“Maybe I could…help you get out of your head for an hour?” he asked, hands trailing up the genius’ thighs. He was suddenly grateful they were the only two on board as autopilot continued their journey.
“Buck, considering what you’ve been through, I’m sure it’s not,” Steve turned around to say before turning back to grab two mugs from the cabinet.
When she was twelve, and about six months before her Dad was taken away from her, she tried pot for the first time.
Tony’s smile turned mischievous as he closed the short gap to his love before taking a finger and tracing it down Steve’s unfortunately clothed chest and abs down to what he was after.
He hadn’t heard from Steve all day, and was too busy throwing a pity party to return Pepper’s numerous and unsympathetic texts. He went back to his bedroom to take a shower, suddenly noticing that in his rush to leave, Steve forgot his medic badge.
Steve laughed at his brother’s antics, returning the favor before a full out bubble war broke out. A moment later the toddler reappeared and quickly joined the fight.
“I’d be proud to sign the company over to you! After you get a degree or two of course. But I have every bit of confidence you’ll whip those board members in place,” pausing to smile at her laugh. “I never…” the genius faulted, taking a moment go gulp his nerves. He kissed the top of her head before continuing, “I didn’t actually think a Stark would get to continue the legacy.”
Coffee usually helped the genius. Plus Bruce probably helped. Speaking of, the doctor smiled and waved at the super soldier before making his quiet exit to no doubt go find his girlfriend.
“Mr. Stark, we understand your concerns, we can provide body guards for you and your family…but Kevin’s right sir, unless we have
They both remained silent the last few minutes of their ride as Tony thought more about what was bothering his boy.
"Oh good," his brother deadpanned, "you're awake." He gently shifted the two to a sitting position as he checked her diaper. "Oh, look at that, and you left me a present, what a thoughtful daughter you are," he teased as Steve chuckled at the two. He watched his brother stand up to bring her to the changing table before bringing the two back over to sit on the couch.
He had taken note when she inched towards him when talking to the other adults. Noticing how much more comfortable she was talking to someone in uniform when he was in the room versus when he wasn’t. He offered her quips and jokes throughout the day, hoping she was recognizing the non-threatening nature of his home. He also couldn’t help the smile when she finally laid down on the couch, looking at peace with his presence and closing her eyes. Just as exhausted as he was. He took that opportunity to begin looking over the files her case worker had sent him.
“Ashley?” Steve tried again. “Sweetheart you’re safe, okay? We’re…just watching you for the day. Your uh…parents – Kimberly and Robert”
“Okay! We promise to lay off of cunts, alright? Joey?” he asked, turning to the laughing teen, “promise your Pop you’ll lay off cunts, okay? See? She promises, Steve. And…to be fair, babe I already promised to lay off cunts when I said ‘I do’, so–”
“So it’s settled! Poppy, Grandaddy, do you mind watching the three stooges for a few hours while we go shopping?” Wade asked as he started pushing everyone off the couch.
“No I didn’t,” she confessed as Steve made his way back to join them. He sat on the coffee table near Joey and tried to hand her the large ice pack. However, the drugs were strong in this one – as she just blinked and continued staring at the ceiling.
"What are you doing crazy pants? Trying to break every bone in your body? That was really dangerous and you should never, ever do something like that again, okay? Just because I jumped doesn't make it okay for your tiny self to jump and end up in the hospital, do you understand me?" Wade finished a little more calmer than his initial panicked reaction. Peter felt his eyes get a little misty when Miles quickly nodded before throwing his arms around the man's neck.
They laid in bed together after shower sex, the two curled up facing each other as Steve finished telling him what happened at work today.
“No,” she said sitting up a little more and looking both of them in the eyes. The genius frowned when he saw the tears in her eyes.
“Fuck yes I am,” the brunette growled before kissing him again. They kissed and kissed until Lucky playfully barked at them, causing them to chuckle and pull apart.
“Yeah yeah, good to see you too, brat. Now move so I can properly meet this boyfriend of yours,” Barney grumbled out before standing up and extending a hand to James. He watched as the two shook hands, remaining on the floor playing with Lucky.
And now, even after the movie, they were laughing along while deciding on a post snack meal. Therapy was good for her. She seemed a little like her old self, but with a little more sass and confidence.
“How about,” the shorter man said as he gently grabbed Steve’s arms, pushing him back onto the bed, “you just let me take care of you tonight?” Steve fell back onto the enormous mattress, smiling as Tony crawled over to straddle him.
Homecoming was apparently different than prom, in that people went straight from the game to the dance so there wasn’t really time to freshen up. At least for non players, the team usually showered in the locker rooms before heading to the gymnasium.
“I don’t know, not having rights to my own body?” she asked dramatically. Steve opened his eyes again, opening his mouth to respond but thankful his husband cut him off.
“Ashley?” the familiar green eyes looked at her imploringly, with that small smile that suddenly felt like a knife in her heart.
“Emerson,” Steve said quietly, holding eye contact with her. She may be a stubborn kid, but he was a seasoned vet – both literally and when it came to dealing with stubborn individuals.
“– NO!” she quickly interrupted and immediately felt horrible for doing so. “No, sorry. I’d rather…you not.”
"Good, way less gross then you two are," he teased as he made his way over to join them on the couch.
“So, I’m guessing it went well?” her Pop asked, now standing behind her. She thanked the receptionist before turning to him to answer. She instead began pushing him in the direction of the exit, following him out as he played along like she could actually move him.
"No," the boy confessed, "I had an accident." The genius realized then that the blankets were bundled up around him as he continued sniffling. Without hesitation, he reached his arms out to bring the soiled boy on his lap. He ignored the way it made his own sweatpants damp, as he gently rocked the boy back and forth and shushed him.
The officer that had her roughly pulled her out of the car and shoved her behind none other than Staci in the line of teenagers. Before she could say anything to that bitch, she heard the person behind her snickering.
“That’s not funny,” she said, yanking her arm away when they approached Mr. Jefferson’s door; mortified with the sudden turn of events.
“Speaking of stegosaurus, they happen to be my favorite dinosaur,” Steve said, holding onto his pup’s legs and waiting for the inevitable debate. The Alpha didn’t have a favorite dinosaur, but he knew the best way to distract the pup was to bring up his favorite hobby.
"Excuse me?" she called to the woman talking to her dads. She carefully lifted the tuxedo kitten above her head to show her and ask, "is this one a boy or a girl?" Her fathers laughed at her as the lady smiled and replied, "boy."
"Do superheroes get nightmares?" The superhero chuckled at the question as he used one hand to open the door to his room.
“Actually Pop, what Dad said sounds amazing,” she said – feeling like Tony deserved one too – as she further curled up in his embrace. She had her eyes closed, so she couldn’t see the two men absolutely beaming at each other. She felt Tony practically pull her on his lap as she simply snuggled up further into his embrace.
“You wanna kick some ass at beer pong?” Clint asked with wiggly brows. James growled playfully before kissing the blonde on the cheek, dragging the two to the nearest table.
“Me too,” Tony chokes out, more emotionally fragile than he realized. He hears Steve make a noise of confusion above him, vision too blurry to see his face.
As he swung around a building down the alleyway, he froze realizing his target had evaded him. He took another moment to look around; surely he could spot a red suited figure creeping around. Disappointed, he swung back to the crime scene, surprised to find a duffle-bag he must have missed earlier. He carefully stepped around the dead bodies before squatting down in front of the bag. He slowly zipped it open, not that surprised to find bundles of cash inside.
She welcomed him in when he knocked on her door, the teen sitting at her desk printing what the blonde assumed to be her finished essay.
Daci didn’t hear the rest, quickly making her way to the elevator with Wolf in tow. The knots in her stomach tightened - now with anger instead of guilt - as she hugged Wolf close, getting off the elevator on Clint’s floor and hoping the archer won’t mind her company.
“The doctor said you could hold him for a few minutes because of the importance of exchanging scents,” the nurse explained as he carefully took the pup out. “So I’ll come back in a few to take him back to observation. Congratulations,” she added with a smile as she carefully put the tiny pup in his arms.
“This doesn’t have to change anything, okay? I mean I get it changes things, but we don’t have to let it? If that makes sense?” Tony offered kindly.
“- no, no cub,” he said as he gently shifted her around to face him on his lap. “Look at me,” he said gently, waiting for her to look up before continuing and not caring of the tears beginning to form in his own eyes. “
“Good,” Steve said in answer, loving the surprise on the boy’s face. “If I’m ever mean to your Daddy, you should absolutely tell on me. Your Daddy is nice and deserves someone who is nice to him.” Harley clearly hadn’t been expecting that answer, as he stared at the older blonde for a few more seconds before puffing up his chest.
“If she’s anything like these three she must be an angel,” Clint said, walking to the fridge that was covered with family pictures. “I’ll trade her for Barney,” he continued, seeing the beautiful teen hugging Bucky in one of the photos.
She laughed as Miles threw another pillow at Peter, who was teasing the boy about trying on his mask when he thought he wasn't looking. The three turned as they heard their Dad approaching, walking in to join them with his mug of coffee in one hand and his breakfast in the other. He placed the items down before making a beeline to the smiling teen.
“Eat, then speak and say thank you,” Tony said pointedly, pulling the pup into his embrace after Harley drank some more lemonade.
"Were you going to try and pull him in?" she asked the pouting man who nodded in response, standing up with a grimace and gently stepping out of the tub. "I love you Daddy," she said with a laugh, feeling more and more excited for movie night as she also moved to climb out of the tub.
.” She couldn’t stop the snort of laughter from that, feeling an incredible amount of love for this man.
He went back into the apartment, looking everywhere for a fucking note she might’ve left. Sure, she didn’t know he had gotten off work early, but she should know better than to leave without the phone she had
“I would bet, let’s give her… three days, four tops, she calls you Pops out of the blue,” he says using his hands to make air quotes. “In fact, a blow job says under three.” Steve couldn’t help his eyes rolling, his husband using any and every opportunity to make him flush. “And when she does,” Tony continued a little more serious, “you can’t react to it. You have to act like nothing is different. Because behind that little badass snarky shell is an insecure fifteen year old girl who isn’t sure how to ask her Papa if she can call him Papa.” Steve looked into Tony’s eyes for any sign of a joke. When he realized what Tony was really saying, he smiled before kissing his husband back.
And as she clicked the red button, placing the phone back on the night stand, she thought to herself she didn’t really mind the childish implications, the nicknames or terms of endearment. She, in this moment, was just a kid who needed her dads. Two dorky, loud, ridiculous, kind, loving human beings that were happy to oblige a child’s request.
The almost twenty year old smiled along the way, glad for the chef since his family otherwise would've had to rely on take out till his Pop came back. The elevator ride was short as he made his way to the living room where his sick family was waiting for him.
“Emerson has a mild concussion and some lacerations on her legs, Peter – hasn’t sustained any injuries, mentally though – they
“Um…” Steve started as the door opened fully. He hadn’t scheduled anything and was confused as a tall man squeezed past Sam to enter his office. Steve stood up from his chair, brows furrowed as the stranger simple stood and smiled at the Captain.
“Are you kidding me? Father-daughter assassin duo would make a great TV show.” And that was the Clint Bucky had just recently remembered. Didn’t stop him from gently flicking the man’s elbow in retaliation. “Hey! I’m literally in a hospital bed.”
“Really? Uncle Bruce? The betrayal is strong in you,” she said with fake emotion as they continued playing Uno. He had just skipped her for the third time.
“Yeah well, next time don’t let a building drop on you and we won’t be so worried,” she said as she rubbed her eyes free of tears. She heard her Dad scoff fondly.
“It’s...it’s been really hard. Apparently Ty told Harley that Steve wanted to have a pup with me to then push him out of my life. I want
"Well, before we get to that, you guys should open this box," Peter said as he handed the box to his excited Dad and ignored his Pop with his one raised eyebrow.
“Six and a half, Ty. Now I’ll ask you again, what the fuck are you doing here?” Tony asked with his arms crossed over his chest. Instead of answering, Ty looked behind the Omega and spotted the pup.
With a confident smile, she spread her arms out in invitation, smiling when he returned the smile and quickly squatted down to hug her.
“Sounds like what you need Rogers is to get laid,” Rumlow said with a laugh. “A drink could help you loosen up enough to actually talk to a woman. God knows how long it’s been since you stuck your dick in a nice piece of ass.”
“What I was going to say, Emerson, is that…” he sighed, not really knowing what he was trying to say. That it was all going to be okay? That they will get their due justice? That she didn’t deserve any of this? She would immediately cut through that line of bullshit.
"There was a perimeter breach as well as an attack on a neighboring country," T'Challa informed them as he immediately suited up and left. Tony turned to Steve who was already racing back to their room to change, shouting at Tony to go ahead - that he'd take the jet and Tony should fly ahead - promising he'd tell their kids the update.
“Why? Because I’m right?” she sassed. The blonde took a long breath before continuing in a lower tone.
“So, what all did you hear?” He figured he’d cut straight to the point, no use lying to the girl. He grabbed the chocolate and began heating it up in a pot on the stove. He looked up at her as she hopped up on a nearby counter, smiling before waiting for her response.
“Hey baby, I thought you were working late?” he said as he sat up and grabbed a towel to wipe his hands off, turning to the blonde.
“You sure you want to get out of the bubbles?” he asked, just to be a shit. It worked for a second, Joey looking down at the bubbles while Bucky gave him the cut-throat sign.
“Yes baby boy?” Tony asked as he rounded the corner, smiling at the scene before him. All three babies were snuggled up with Steve on the couch, his husband extending an arm out in invitation.
He thanked his host and packed his back when the time came, taking a look at the mansion one more time before heading to the door.
Steve returned the kiss and tightened his arms around Tony’s waist, his tongue darting in to Tony’s mouth to explore further.
“What? I...I don’t...I don’t even like dudes! He just...pissed me off!” Not only had he always only been attracted to girls (which was an interesting conversation to have, coming out as straight to his two gay dads), but he hadn’t even seen his face! How could he have a crush on someone he couldn’t see? “I think I’m getting somewhere with-” Miles caught himself, looking at his niece and nephews and remembering Peter’s rule about only the three knowing about Miles being Spiderman, “-that...research project at the library. And he just swooped in and stole my thunder!”
“Officer,” she tried to manage from the backseat. “I’m not drunk,” she slurred out, humphing in frustration at herself.
“Yeah huh!” Tony exclaimed, offended and finally looking up at him. “I lied about your one hundredth birthday present, I lied about liking your oatmeal raisin cookies and I lied about your ass not looking slutty in your yoga pants.” A smile spread across the super soldier’s face as he considered the man’s confessions.
He gently closed the door behind them, returning the hug Emerson had quickly wrapped him in. He looked over her hair at his husband, whose arms were crossed as he offered a small smile to the two.
“So,” May started, taking a swig of her drink, “wanna tell me what’s bothering you?” Joey took her own long swig, wondering to herself how honest she should be. However her insecurities got to her first as she offered this kind woman a way out.
“What happened with the friends you were supposed to be hanging out with last night?” Steve asked, concerned.
“Daci, hey cub,” her Tati said as he walked over to no doubt pull her into a hug. But before he could, Daci interrupted him.
Then a thought crossed Tony’s mind. Remembering Ty look at his phone before suddenly leaving…not even trying to get the last word in…
? James, how dare you accuse us of such a thing,” her blonde father said, acting scandalized and sending Daci a wink that made her laugh.
“-or. OR. You could stay here, with me,” Clint slurred as he scooted closer to hang his legs over the side of the bed.
“Just because Bill and Kristen wouldn’t take advantage of you, doesn’t mean they would know what to do if you seized. Either way you put yourself in danger of having a seizure doing something I specifically told you not to do. Which, I’m happy you haven’t had one yet, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. Which is also why you just chugged Gatorade,” he explained carefully.
“You spared her a much longer and more painful death. You’re not a monster. And you were absolutely right – you sure as shit didn’t deserve us as parents.” Tears flowed freely down Emerson’s face as she smiled back at the woman. Her eyebrows furrowed as she considered asking a question she’s had since she was six.
"Jamie! How's my favorite grandson doing?" Tony asked as they saw his moms and baby sister join them.
“Tony! We were just talking about you! What are you doing here, man?” she slurred a little at him. Steve coughed loudly to make his presence known, frowning as Joey whipped to the other side to look at him.
“Now, force yourself to lower your breath intake. Your body is going into “fight or flight” mode due to the buildup of carbon dioxide in your lungs. Breathe slowly in and out – excellent work Miss” he added bringing a small smile from the girl. She took deep exaggerated breaths after his next suggestion, unable to stop the continuation of tears.
Instead, she went to her old friends, who helped her achieve her goal of drinking alcohol, which did in fact calm her down…until she ran into Cara. And her
“I’m going to the game room,” she said after pulling away from her father. “I think I could use a distraction,” she said as she turned from the pair.
“What are you talking about, sharpshooter?” Of course he would make a joke right now. Vi was right about him. And that’s why the next words came out of his mouth.
“He does look damn good in baseball pants. Stevie why don’t you play baseball?” Tony asked him with a pout while also leaning heavily into his side. Steve tried his best to keep a stern face, because the man was implying he should play a sport just so his boyfriend could watch his ass. But the pretty brunette was wearing glasses and Steve’s letterman jacket after overdramatically shivering earlier, so the blonde couldn’t help himself and just kissed the brunette in answer.
“Oh shit, does Rogers have a secret admirer? What’s her name?” Rumlow asked as he wiggled his eyebrows.
“Tony…” Steve said pointedly as Joey didn’t bother stifling that laugh. “Hey,” Steve’s attention turning to the teen, “you still need to answer my question,” he finished with a pointed finger in her direction. He turned his attention back to the sauce, revealing more on the stove for Joey to make out they were having chicken parmesan for dinner. She took another whiff as she smelled garlic bread in the oven.
Joey rolled her eyes fondly as she watched May take notes; glad and grateful to get what time she could get with this woman.
“I’ll do it,” Miles threatened, trying to appear taller. He was six two and about the same height as the vigilante.
“She’s with SHIELD,” her father said in English. As if that meant she was supposed to suddenly trust this stranger.
"Who's up for Toy Story?" Emerson asked, interrupting their impending squabble in favor of being selfish. "J? A little help?" she asked the ceiling as her parents took the hint and sat back in silence.
She not so gracefully shoved the books next to Steve before crawling up on the couch and onto his lap. He groaned in pain when she stepped on his crotch, holding his frustration in to let her move around enough to finally sit on his lap.
The woman apparently also didn’t like the news - if her flinch before her smile after finding out was anything to go by.
“How about you and Tony get the snacks ready and Morgan and I will go pick out the book, and we’ll all meet in the living room?” Steve suggested with a smile as Daci felt her slight fear dissipate.
“Yeah so should we head to your place so I can see a few samples of your work or…?” Steve felt himself blush again as Tony just smiled wolfishly at him.
“Yeah, I’ll give you that. Now come on, you owe me an essay,” he said, smiling as she groaned loudly and followed him out of the car and up the sidewalk.
“Come on,” the super soldier nudged his son. “Let’s go see if your sister wants go out for the day, just the four of us.” Glad to see his son really smile again, the captain joined hands with his husband as they followed their son out.
When they were done, they joined T'Challa as the group boarded the plane to return to the city. The King's bracelet went off, T'Challa revealing a holographic call from Okoye - who alerted them of the stolen vibranium.
They sat together at the dinner table as Pop brought the eggplant lasagna he made from scratch and Dad brought in some salad behind him. Dad started talking about the work he’s been doing preparing for the Stark expo, which happens to be the same weekend as his birthday.
“Daddy he hasn’t even seen Jurassic World!” Harley said, offense in his voice and a pout on his face.
“Guys, clothes back on,” Steve said trying not to laugh again as the kids shrugged before doing as told. His brother had his lips pursed together like he was about to ask a question…but still stared in fear as Steve couldn’t help laughing again.
“Pappy this is Harley, my mate’s son,” Steve introduced the two as the pup shuffled closer to the Alpha.
First was Clint and Natasha, who came over one morning for breakfast. Steve sat back as Emerson easily charmed the two assassins, even throwing a few jokes at Clint’s expense, which made everyone laugh. Nat had slipped away for a moment as Clint tried to prove to the two teenagers he was, in fact, still hip and cool. She stood next to Steve, smiling before speaking.
"Well, considering the analysis I think a cystoscopy would be best. It would flush your system out and end the cramping. And if it makes you feel any better I have done this procedure plenty of times all around the world. I have seen many...vaginas." Tony couldn't help but laugh at his friend's awkwardness, glad to see his kid smile a little at that as well. Steve elbowed Tony to pay better attention, turning back to Bruce as he tried to explain himself better.
“What’d you get me?” Tony asked as he obediently followed Steve to his room, sitting on the bed and swinging his feet in anticipation. The blonde froze for a moment, before looking down at the ground.
“Coming J, we’ll see you for lunch right?” he asked the brunette who was concentrating on his papers.
"And where might my youngest be?" he asked Jarvis as he stretched out a yawn, getting up to use the restroom.
“What?” Bucky bit out at the billionaire, quickly snapping at attention at the mention of his daughter’s name. “What are you talking about?”
“I take it back, I’ll just drag him by his foot. Keep it elevated and all that. You boys have fun,” her Tati deadpanned, making Daci laugh at the image of her father dragging Clint across the floor. She watched Tony and Steve leave and frowned when the energy in the room sank.
It had been four years since she last saw him. It was also just after the last and final time he had raped her. That fat, disgusting man had been heaving himself on top of her, ignoring her small cries to “stop.” When he rutted to a finish, he pulled out of her before tucking himself back into his pants. Didn’t even look at her as he made his way out of the room. She could hear him loudly asking the men, “who’s next?” before they laughed and started offering payment to get the chance. In that moment, she felt a fire burn deep inside of her, spreading throughout the rest of her body. Some primal, animal extinct told her to run and survive. It felt like something had snapped, waking her up to the idea that she couldn’t keep letting this happen. That she had to be the one to stop it. I’m done, the then eleven year old had thought to herself, no one is next.
“Oh I know,” he said with a smile, “you and Stark both have a thing for tall blondes,” he finished with a whisper, smiling as her face blushed furiously and her eyes widened. Before she could deny it or threaten his life, he used his hand to mime locking his mouth and throwing away the key.
“Harry?” he calls out, realizing he hadn’t heard any groans in a minute. But then he heard another groan that caused the teen to breathe a sigh of relief. Which only exacerbated the pain.
“I don’t like her! I don’t like who you turn into around her, I don’t like that she takes you away from us and when she does come by the tower she brushes off the other Avengers. She’s mean and I don’t trust her,” the child bit out, tiny arms crossed over her chest that matched Bucky’s.
Tony had a flash of anger course through him, taking a deep breath to calm himself down. That asshole could have had this the whole time. Instead he fled like a coward, waltzing back in when he damn well pleased.
Yeah, Cara confessed, but she also participated in doing some serious harm to Joey. Triggering a seizure for some revenge pics? None of them knew what to do if the seizure had gotten any worse. Or if she’d hit her head or broken something?
Honestly? He had never felt taller - even if everyone else was sitting down. Obie looked like he was going to blow a fuse, Sunset had her mouth hanging open in confusion, while Steve was giving him a look that seemed like
“To Emerson!” the crowd said, watching her as she stood up from her chair, making her way over to Tony. With the biggest smile on her face, she wrapped her arms around him in a hug before turning to do the same with her Pop. “Thank you,” she whispered to both, really truly meaning it.
“I’m sorry baby,” Steve began, “I’m so sorry you went through that.” When he saw his husband shrug in response, he released his hands in favor of pulling the brunette fully on his lap. Tony easily melted into his embrace, wrapping his arms around the blonde’s neck as Steve held him close to his chest.
“D’aww, thanks guys. I will admit, part of that was for selfish reasons,” she said with a grin as the two fathers found themselves quickly enveloping her in a hug sandwich.
Did...did Bucky remind Clint too much of Rumlow? I mean...they’re both white brunettes...but other than that he liked to think he was everything that asshole wasn’t.
“She wanted it to snow,” the man said as he looked at his younger brother. Steve let out another laugh, glad to see Bucky join him this time.
“Rogers-Stark,” the young girl added before breaking away from the two, nervous and happily tapping her foot against the floor.
“Well,” Steve said, not wanting to push him any further, “he’s pretty great. What um, what’s the new thing you’re working on?” Steve asked as he motioned to the thing in front of Tony. When the brunette looked up at him again, his eyes looked manic.
,” Steve whispered to the boy, kissing his temple before leading the two to the NICU. “The puppy will probably be small, but don’t let that scare you,” the Alpha explained as Dr. Strange led them to the pup.
"I love Iron Man! Spiderman is just my favorite and I couldn't carry both," he said almost sadly. Steve smiled as his husband instantly caved, kneeling down to address the boy.
Emerson wasn’t at school the next day. Or the next. His dads had noticed the absence that evening and asked Peter about it. Shrugging, Peter offered no explanation and was quiet for the rest of dinner until his phone buzzed. He pulled the device from his pocket to check the message, ignoring his Pop’s reminder no phones at the dinner table.  “It’s Emerson,” he said looking up at them, “she’s asking if she can come over tomorrow to finish the project. She said she was out sick the last two days.” He didn’t sound entirely convinced as he relayed the message.
“Xa…I’m literally weak in the knees,” she said quietly, smiling when he laughed aloud at that. She slowly got up, excepting the sideways hug from her friend before leaving.
Steve distracted her with her stuffed lion while Bucky put the cookies away and grabbed a wet wipe to clean her face.
Tony sipped on his latte - so thankful his father-in-law knew him well enough to get him one - as he looked around the room. Sarah and Aunt Peggy laughing in hushed whispers. Joe making funny faces at a squealing baby while Wanda joined in. Barnes stopped spinning Pietro long enough to kiss Clint, holding the laughing toddler upside down.
"Do you remember the way she described our father?" she asked, Peter finally realizing where she was going with this.
“She said…when my Dad died, you tried to give me to her,” she said in what Steve almost thought sounded like a fond voice.
“A week,” James confessed, shrugging a shoulder when Clint looked back up at him. “I’ve known for a while though…”
Amanda’s parents met them at the mall, leaving the two of them to hang out with each other for…two hours? It was only six…
“Our plan was to go out anyway, Steve join us and celebrate,” Nat said as she walked around and stole Sam’s spot.
“They count,” he said before lifting the smaller man’s legs up to focus on the other scars on his legs and feet from more ‘lab incidents.’ Tony laughed but otherwise remained silent, watching his love tenderly kiss each and every scar before moving up to another tattoo on his other rib.
Emerson gently moved to sit next to him, legs still resting on his lap as he heard Steve call out asking if they were ready. He looked at his daughter who realized they weren't ready, calling out to let Steve know before moving with him as they cleared some space in the living room to walk. She grabbed a nearby tablet to adjust the lights and prepare the music as Tony told Jarvis to record the whole thing.
“Enough Tony!” Steve laughed as he shifted to position himself to silence his husband the best way the super soldier knew how. And Tony of course was never one to complain when it came to Steve’s lips. The two teens groaned and extracted themselves from the bed.
“That’s not it and you know it,” Bucky challenged him, daring him to try and use humor to deflect. Not after everything they’ve been through. “How long did you wait in Brazil for me?” he asked more gently, hating the flinch it got from the archer. Clint only shrugged in response, which prompted Bucky to continue. “I’m so sorry, Clint.”
He ran his fingers up and down her back, wondering how much longer that creature would plague her mind. He smiled when he realized she was trying to control her breathing while still burying her face in his chest. Peter used to do the same thing when he was little.
“Daci!” Bucky cried out before finally moving his feet to chase after her. She began fighting Steve, who was blocking her moves but struggling not to fight back. As soon as Bucky got close enough, Daci spotted him, moved around and stomped her foot at the two of them. They flew back in unison and demolished the wall behind them.
The bell suddenly rang, the two teens taking their sweet time to get up and go to their first class of the day.
“So…” he began, sipping his own coffee and turning to face her with a smile. “How are you really doing, sister?” She couldn’t help the smile that broke across her face, having known how persistent this man can be when he wants to know something.
He turned to look at his son, wondering if he even looked passed his own hurt to see Wade’s. He waited until the door closed behind him to gently let his daughter go.
“We’re in public!” she wheezed out, flailing as this ridiculously strong human continued carrying her the short distance to the car – not even acknowledging the few bystanders staring.
She laughed fondly and rolled her eyes, smiling brightly as she heard Leo sigh heavily before walking over to help them.
After putting her hair in a cap and goggles on her face, she climbed the steps into the pool. It was cool without being cold and she kicked her legs a little before lining up on the side of the wall. Taking a deep breath she kicked off the wall and began freestyling to the other side.
“How…” Tony asked with a thick voice, unable to process he had actually found his soulmate, “how can I be sure though? Maybe I’m just super fertile?”
“I’m sorry to hear that, sounds like he was a good brother,” Tony said fondly. Steve looked back into those dark brown eyes and smiled appreciatively, nodding in response.
He took this opportunity to scoot closer to Tony, smiling when his love’s face blushed at the words.
“Come on, baby,” Steve said, giving her head a quick kiss before opening the door. She followed him in, both sharing a chuckle that Tony and Peter were
“She was?” Daci asked, voice small and still sounding unsure. He nodded back at her as he tucked some hair behind her ear. “Have you seen her? I think she was there at the base.”
“Yeah know, for the son of a genius, you’re really an idiot.” He looked back at her confused. “This morning he asked me about the color of your tux; and if I may add my two cents – don’t let him get a matching one.”
“Holy shit,” Steve said, tears in his eyes as he kissed Tony so sweetly. “I think...I think Bruce was right.”
“Miles when do you wanna go shopping?” his Dad asked, pulling Peter out of his thoughts to look at the older brunette. “Flower went through a growth spurt, he’s taller than your Pops now and needs new clothes,” he said to Wade who gave a satisfying shocked look to the teen.
The next day flew by in a blur. After speaking to her social worker, child protective services, her school, the police, several of his top attorneys, Rhodey and Pepper he was glad to have a moment to rest. Glad Steve had taken care of getting her stuff so he wouldn’t have to see the child-abuser in person, knowing his husband had better will power and self-control than he did. Glad also because he got to stay home with their newest occupant. Watching some old Looney Tunes with her and pigging out on junk food as they waited for Peter to come home from school.
It was two days before they walked across the stage, and Steve was starting to wish high school could’ve lasted longer. Here he was practically a king...but out there? He was a nobody. Who had no idea what he should do with his life.
"Alright, well as always Thor we love when you stop by unexpected," Steve said sarcastically as he stood to wish them farewell.
and…” Before the crying could really start, she buried her face in her arms that she rested on top of her knees.
When it came to his brother, he always found himself being more lenient – remembering he’d thrown a punch or two for Bucky back in the day.
“Look, what’s done is done, okay? Harry is still alive, in the hospital, and...and that’s all I know about him but Mr. Osborn doesn’t know it was me!” Peter really might throw up.
“Oh…my brother, he uh…he died a few years ago,” Steve said, always feeling that pang in his heart when he said it out loud.
"We'll also need to stop by a pet store after to get a litter box and food and stuff," her Dad added as he remained standing and dug into his food.
"That's right Peter rabbit, I'm your bubba," Harley cooed, kissing the baby on his head before gently releasing him back to their Papa.
“Don’t do that,” Bucky interrupted with renewed anger and hurt. Tears formed in his eyes and he had to clear his throat before continuing. “Don’t belittle what we had as some fucked up friends with benefits. I remember, Clint. I remember
She sat in the front seat this time, wanting to be sure she heard everything Happy said. Now she sat in silence wishing she hadn’t heard him.
I am well aware of. It’s kind of creepy…how similar y’all are. Not to mention your freakish clone mini terrorist –”
“Don’t listen to them Wade,” Emerson interrupted. “Once you seen them in footy pajamas, they’re not that intimidating.”
“Eat Unca Miles!” Lilli cried as her brother quickly chimed in, the two chanting and continuing the attack on their uncle.
Memories came flooding back of being six and her mother giving her cranberry juice when she complained about the pain. Kimberly hadn't had much sympathy at the time, Emerson surprised thinking back to the coked out woman who was able to even give her the right juice to help. Her mother had left after giving her a small bottle, telling her that the pain would go away eventually as she reminded the child that the hospital would "hurt and only tear their family apart."
"Well, how do you know he wasn't killing bad guys?" Emerson asked sincerely as she stole another glance at Wade - who was looking everywhere but at the other three people in the room.
“I confess there’s another reason I brought you in here, Rogers.” Steve’s head shot up again at that, gulping before steeling himself for the answer.
“But you are already there for him. Sweetheart, as harsh as it sounds, he needs more than you. And the reality is it might take him a second to come to terms with that. I went through a few shitty boyfriends before I met your dad. When I met him, he was still mourning your mom but still gave me the patience as I figured out my mental health. I saw a therapist because I finally felt ready to do so. And your dad slowly healed from losing his wife. We were good for each other...” she trailed off with a smile, looking off to the side like she did whenever she talked about her husband.
Steve and Bucky were both at eight, staying with their Pappy as their Mama and Papa were at the hospital having their little sister.
Emerson and Peter were sitting together with an empty chair for Steve and a few feet away were two teenage boys and a very angry looking woman who didn’t even bother acknowledging the man as he sat down. Mr. Campbell made his way to his seat before starting.
“You’d call Stephen a friend?” Banner asked Stark with a teasing tone, that the billionaire just ignored in favor of stepping into Bucky’s personal space. Before he could react fully, Stark sprayed the contents of the bottle in Bucky’s face.
His good mood was soured, however, when he walked in the front door and was immediately chastised by his brother.
“I think the power of king has gone to your pretty blonde head,” Tony continued purring, watching as Steve looked confused for a moment before rolling his eyes in understanding.
He focused on his breathing in this present moment, thankful that the normal sounds of the hospital came back to him. It was laughing that finally had him open his eyes he didn’t realize he had closed.
He contemplated bringing some sandwiches down to Tony and Bruce, but decided if they wanted to eat they could come up and grab some themselves.
The entrance way was blocked, even when Iron Man and Captain America had tried to use their combined strength to move it. Tony started using heat the melt the debris, working on clearing a path. Steve fidgeted as he watched, coming up with plans b-z to get her back safe and sound.
– which is why I invited him over for dinner.” She didn’t have time to be surprised at that, as he continued with his little speech.
“And you think your dad would’ve let today slide?” he asked. She shrunk in on herself, looking a lot younger than sixteen, eventually shaking her head ‘no’ in response. They sat in silence until Steve pulled up to their home.
Both he and Tony each picked up a stack, looking over them as she explained herself further, counting off the piles on her fingers.
“Oo oo ah ah!” the boy said, waving his arms around and puffing his small face out. The blonde couldn’t help but chuckle at the adorable pup.
“Yes, J. Tell him it’s safe,” he said with a smile as he again fiddled with his tablet while he waited for his love. A minute later he heard the elevator ding followed by heavy footsteps approaching him in the living room. He glanced up and frowned at the sight before him.
“Hey now, Buck. How can you say that? You’re doing a great job with Daci, you’re already giving her everything she needs and more.” Steve hesitated before reaching a hand out to rest on the other man’s shoulder. “She’s already changed into a happier and healthier kid in the short amount of time she’s been here.”
“Yeah, I’m just being silly. Your name was her first word, I’m just jealous.” Daci stared at him in confusion with a quirked brow.
“Just let me mourn in peace, Pop,” she said, unable to see the blonde throw his hands up in exasperation.
“Kid, we’ve talked about this. There are going to be bad people in this world that hate me and Tony, that doesn’t mean you sock them in the jaw.”
“Can I help you with something, anorexic Barbie?” she said deadpanned. An ‘ooh’ was murmured among the other girls, Joey noting that Cara had remained silent.
"Goodnight wonderful parents," she said with a smile as she turned to go to her room. He turned back to Steve who was smiling fondly at their kid, eventually turning back to look at his husband. A wicked smile spread across the taller man's face as his blue eyes suddenly got darker.
It just didn’t hurt that he had an awesome Australian accent to go along with his tall muscular frame.
“You were supposed to go to May’s because I fucking told you to; not because you were babysitting your brother
With a smile on her face she turned to Peter and said, “Cause they’re me, Peter. My name means ‘wolf’ in Romanian.” Her Tati had explained that to her and shown her pictures of the creatures numerous times.
“Okay then,” he continued, Jo not able to look at him as he walked over to sit next to her. “Come on kiddo,” the blonde said sadly as he grabbed her arm and pulled her across his broad lap.
She couldn’t help the chuckle that escaped, knowing just how serious he was being but unable to suppress the laugh from his statement.
coming up like bile in his throat as he spit out the next words like acid, “you wanted to know if I was happy? Well guess what, I’m not. Thanks to you.”
“Did you give your Tati a bubble beard? I keep trying to get him to grow one now that he’s growing his hair out. He just kind of looks like a baby wearing a wig without one.” The statement had her brunette father turn to her in question, silently asking permission for a hilarious prank. You can’t say being clones doesn’t have it’s perks - as they could usually read each other’s minds.
“Okay,” the brunette said with less confidence. “How about you circle the block while I put someone d-o-w-n for a n-a-p,” he said, spelling out the words. It didn’t work.
“Do you two have any plans for tomorrow?” Tony asked, taking a moment to look at the teen behind him. Steve raised his eyebrows at Joey in question.
“And why would we break up at all, cutiepie? Don’t tell me there’s someone else,” Tony said in a teasing tone, though Steve could hear the underlying insecurity. Steve quickly shook his head no in reassurance.
“Hey,” Clint said gently as he grabbed his boyfriend’s hand. “Everything okay?” James looked back at him with a forced smile as the brunette tried to lead the two inside. But Clint stayed put. “What’s wrong?” he asked in a more serious tone.
“Well, I can’t promise we won’t give random unwanted hugs or love you anymore than we already do…which is
“Look on the bright side, handsome,” the brunette added as he grabbed his love’s jaw gently. “Remember earlier when I said it was probably just GI problems? Well, you get to tell me
“Hey, no that’s not okay,” she replied with a frown, putting her hands on her hips. “Bruce doesn’t break your stuff so you can’t break his.”
“What’s he doing here?” Andy asked, walking him and Jackson over to his big brother while still eyeing the older blonde.
Steve sighed in contentment, feeling truly relaxed with the love of his life in his arms as the swayed in a hammock on a beautiful beach.
“Or maybe you’re not as intimidating as you think you are,” Steve said, little surprised with his sass but rolling with it. Tony simply continued smiling, though it was starting to look a little predatory as the brunette crossed his legs.
“Good god what is it with everyone concerned about paying attention to me! I’m the only one doing okay, besides my boyfriend and best friend losing their damn minds...that makes me sad. But I’m not offended you didn’t ‘pay attention’ to me,” the bastard added with damn finger quotes, “I’m a little offended by your reaction that it’s the
“That’s right Petey! A whole weekend with fun Uncle Rhodey! Who brings weapons as toys whenever he comes over…” Steve said with a smug smile as he walked around to sit on the couch with Morgan in his lap.
Steve was almost taken aback by the man’s presence, steeling himself to throw a nod to Sam – who looked skeptically at the stranger before returning a nod and closing the door.
“Oh, Petey,” the blonde began, moving to sit next to Emerson as he began rubbing his son’s back in comfort. His eyes became glassy as he sat helpless next to his heart-broken son, silent as he cried his eyes out.
He stole another glance at Wade, who eventually conceded the bill to his dads, wondering if maybe he already had.
Barney had just sat in silence for a good four minutes, finally saying ‘okay’ before turning back to the movie they were watching. It wasn’t really talked about again, but Barney did significantly reduce the amount of gay jokes and slurs he used to throw around.
Tony took it reluctantly and immediately frowned when he saw the messages. He had several missed calls and messages from Howard.
“Wait, Dad seriously?!” Tony exclaimed, watching as his son and father left the room together, much to the others delight.
“Thank you, Mr. Stark but we should be getting back,” Steve said even as he felt his cheeks warm at the implication.
“Now, why were you up little one, did you have a bad dream?” the blonde asked after releasing the two and taking a step back to look at Peter.
She considered that for a moment, wondering if she could ever feel the same way. Wondering if her dads would still think of her the same way…if they even wanted to still be her parents.
“Sorry, I…” a hiccup interrupted her speech as she did her best to hide it. She blinked away some tears as she saw Tony approach her. A gentle hand rested on her shoulder before she finally looked up at him.
why she went directly to her room instead of greeting us, eh?” the brunette said as he stole a piece of the garlic bread Steve had just finished slicing. He swatted the man’s thigh, though that only always enticed the man.
“Ugh, let me go! Stop being such a Neanderthal!” The suggestion gave him an idea, loosening his arms enough to throw the teen over his shoulder.
“No I didn’t. For all I know he’s been in on this from the beginning.” He made sure to sigh heavily before looking down at the magazine that had Steve immediately coiling in disgust.
She didn’t like that she insulted her dads…or her Papa,” he beamed as he leaned over to pull her back to his side. He couldn’t see her face but her ears were tipped pink as she laughed.
“However, I also know sexuality is a spectrum and I recognize that there might be a man out there who could turn me. In fact, if one of your dads does die, I’d happily take over as step-dad. Either one of them, I would do that for you,” he said, pausing as she laughed loudly at him.
“To apologize,” the woman began, interrupted again by Emerson as she shot out a fake laugh. “And…to tell you that I forgive you.”
He was currently surrounded by them, since they had all come for Steve’s birthday and to also celebrate the fourth of July. They were all out back, enjoying the big pool as Sam grilled burgers for everyone. Bucky and Steve were taking turns throwing Harley back and forth in the pool, much to the pup’s shrieking delight. Clint and Nat were floating on pool rafts while Steve’s Ma and Pop were lounging around chatting it up with Thor by the snacks. Pappy was napping loudly next to Tony as the Omega held the baby monitor in his hands and watched them all with a fond smile on his face.
She wouldn’t admit it out loud – mostly because she didn’t need to see that satisfaction on his face – but this was actually helping.
“You are! Daddy…stoooooop,” she said between laughs, breathing heavily in happy exhaustion when he finally did stop.
“Clint will be okay, Daci. And like your Tati said, you can’t feel bad about something you had no control over,” Bruce added, giving Bucky a long look after that had him averting his gaze. But his words apparently worked on his daughter, who still seemed sad but more at peace as she snuggled more into his arms.
"Oo, do I hear wedding bells?" her obnoxiously blonde father piped in. Before she could remind him they had had
Joey really liked May and loved that she made her feel welcome in her own home. Not a lot of parent’s ex’s would willingly watch their new partner’s kid. But as Joey was learning, May was a damn Saint.
“What crawled up your collective asses? Tough shift?” the man asked more sincerely as Sam waved and made his exit. Steve took pity on the guy, and seeing as he was the only one left, felt kinda obligated to answer.
He rolled his eyes moving to grab his wallet before they caught the blue folder. Tony felt Emerson freeze next to him, before they both moved to grab the folder. Clint was closer and quicker, able to hold it out of her reach with a smug smile.
“But Clint...if, if you are my parent...does that mean I can call you, you know...something different?” She’d been considering it for a while but wasn’t sure how to ask him. Ever since Clint and her Tati got together at the hospital, Daci finally felt like she was part of a real family. And she didn’t even mind when they went on dates, cause sometimes Clint made sure they brought Daci along and other times they always brought Daci back something.
“Sure,” the girl said dismissively, shrugging her shoulders for emphasis. Steve looked at her for a moment before grabbing the ingredients from the fridge.
"I can't believe I even have to say this, but no witchcraft in the living room," Tony said as he walked around to greet their guest.
“Hell yeah! You’re so smart, for all I know you’ve got the cure for cancer ready. Which way?” Steve asked, still wondering if it’d be weird to ask for a tour as he looked around. When his eyes settled back on Tony, the brunette had a weird expression on his face. “Tony?” he asked, suddenly concerned. But then Tony shook whatever it was off and smiled brightly at Steve.
He stayed there, nestled in his love’s strong arms, debating with himself whether or not to tell the truth.
“Could you give your dads and me some privacy? Official Avengers business, kiddo,” he continued, smiling at the teen.
“Like I said, traitors. Now, let me grab a blanket before you monsters start getting crumbs everywhere,” Tony said as Daci passed out the napkins. She snuggled up with the others and helped spread the blanket out, feeling warm and fuzzy and trying to appreciate the moment.
She took both the water and the pills Steve handed her, still not looking at either parent as she swallowed them. She finally responded, looking down at her lap.
“Woah, do I...fuck am I really that hot?” Tony asked with a smile, laughing when his boyfriend groaned in annoyance. “No, but seriously could I commission you for something? Or would it be too weird to have you draw yourself naked? I mean, the image that comes to mind only requires two full length mirrors…” Tony rambled before Steve cut him off in his favorite way ever. He smiled into the kiss as the blonde took the sketchbook away and pushed the brunette back against the bed.
“Where are you and Daddy going, Papa?” Peter asked after climbing off Rhodey and running over to sit in Tony’s lap.
But yeah, okay maybe therapy worked when you found the right person. And had such a perfect partner.
He told his Pops he’d be home in thirty minutes and it had been…an hour. That’s a whole thirty minutes unaccounted for. He was thinking of a lame excuse when the elevators door opened. He heard the TV playing the news and walked into the living room to find his dads cuddled up with blankets…watching…
“Yeah? And what do you want to do about fuck-face?” He frowned as Tony’s smile dropped, his husband’s demeanor changing at the mention of that man.
make you her father,” the vile mother spit out condescendingly. “Besides, everyone is well aware of her
know now!” the boy exclaimed in excitement before turning on his heel to sprint out of the hospital room.
“Sweetheart,” he heard his husband say. “You’re obviously in pain; let Steve look so he can help. We promise not to be angry until we’ve heard your side, in its entirety.” Steve looked away from her to gawk at his husband.
"Says the guy who just last night was -" Tony was interrupted by his daughter's hand to his mouth, laughing around her interruption.
“Wait, what did she just say?” Clint asked with concern, or at least it sounded like it, since her eyes were shut tight as she willed the tears to stop. She felt gentle hands on her shoulders, recognizing her father and jumping into his embrace.
“Actually it’s about damn time, I’m Natasha,” the beautiful red head assured, extending her hand in greeting as well.
"We were just talking on the ride up here how much you've grown, and what a beautiful young woman you've become -"
“Xavier was just telling me about his sister getting into med school,” the blonde offered to diffuse the tension.
“Not the point! Come on, what did little Stevie wanna be when he grew up?” He took a moment to look at the brunette, finding it easier and easier to talk to him. And be near him. And imagine him without the well tailored suit.
Wade had been out of the country the last week, unable to meet the newest addition to the family. When he finally got back earlier today, after giving Peter a kiss in greeting, he had called Steve to ask if they could take Miles out for a few hours. The vigilante was obviously still exhausted from his trip and it just seemed like...well, Wade was avoiding Peter.
as she handed the teen the phone, Joey taking a gulp before taking it from her hand to put to her ear.
She thought to herself as she let out a little scoff, debating whether or not to tell him the truth.
“No, Mama. Steve and I want to wait until he or she comes out.” Tony felt Steve grab his hand, giving a gentle squeeze and feeling love pushing through the bond in response.
“You know, I haven’t technically said yes,” Rhodey said after a moment, though Tony could see a smile on the man’s face.
Steve himself had been fighting with who he was for the last 29 years, so it wasn’t like Rumlow was targeting him specifically. He was an asshole with zero sensitivity who regularly threw homophobic slurs around cause it’d get the occasional laugh. Not from his friends, who at the most would offer an amused smile towards the guy. But other medics and EMTs at the station thought he was hilarious – and so it made it cement his idea of staying in the closet. Plus his life was complicated enough at the moment, and if he’d survived 29 years of not telling anyone his true self…well…he could always keep it in a little longer.
“How old is he?” Steve asked, confused because Tony didn’t look much older than him, and this pup was at least…
“Unless you wanna tell me what happened, my priority is getting your meds back.” She stared at him a moment later before hanging her head in response.
“Thank you,” Harley said, joining his Daddy on the couch as Steve sat on the other side of Tony. The Alpha put his arm around the brunette who leaned against his side.
“This animal just slugged me!” the leader said standing himself up, pointing to his face. His backup singers started defending the diva.
“Hey Em, look who’s joining us for dinner,” he said to the sullen teen, who offered a small smile to the falcon.
When she got to the local clinic, she walked around looking for someone important to tell. Her breathing was ragged as she tried to find a woman to tell, not really wanting to see a man. A dark skinned nurse made her way over to the frightened child, out of adrenaline. She stared at the lady’s brown eyes as she kneeled down to her level. When she got her breathing under control, she said with a shaky voice “my name is Ashley Sanchez. My father is Robert Sanchez and he sells drugs. He sells drugs…and he sells me.” Tears were in her eyes as she said that. She listened as the room had gotten quiet, other patients and people in the clinic now focused on her. The pretty nurse gave her a small smile before placing her hand on her shoulder.
Steve watched the car leave, chest heaving as he worked on not turning fully feral. He could feel a little bit of red bleed into his eyes before a hand grabbed his arm to bring him back.
“Have I told you lately how lucky I am to have you?” Steve asked sincerely as he ran his hands gently up and down the man’s placid arms. Tony felt a shiver go down his spine, smiling back at the man.
"Hey! Don't splash me Papa or I'll let Uncle Clint and Uncle Bucky take me home too!" the pup teased, giggling as Steve quickly swam over to the pup. Tony watched fondly as Bucky decided not to give Harley over, the three getting into a wrestling/splashing match as Clint waded Peter over to where Tony was sitting.
She pulled away from them with a laugh, turning when she saw Wade and Peter approaching them; pulling her into a much less crushing embrace then her fathers.
Their tiny daughter looked on the verge of tears again before finally speaking up and breaking their hearts.
“And a million aunts and uncles,” Peter reminded, the three men smiling when she did. They sat in silence again until Steve spoke, asking the question the other two had asked when they realized she had left.
When she woke, the first thing she recognized was that she wasn’t in bed. She was sideways on the couch, head lying on a pillow on someone’s lap. Blinking eyes helped her recognize Steve’s legs, the blonde moving his hand to card through her hair after she made her consciousness known.
“Yeah, we just gotta head down to the gym.” Daci watched him curiously as he lifted Morgan into his arms and grabbed Harley’s hand, leading everyone to the elevator.
She rolled her eyes as she tried to sit up, immediately pushed back by the God of a man she had somehow forgotten about. She did not mind his touch, however.
Steve squeezed Bucky’s arm in thanks before standing up a little straighter, taking a deep breath to fully calm his nerves.
Three days later and Steve’s staring at the note in his hand as he sits in his kitchen. It was his day off and he was thankful for that as he sipped his coffee and thought his life over.
“What if you came over next weekend for a sleepover?” Ty asked, cause he was a dick Alpha with no boundaries or common courtesy.
“No, you don’t get it.” She finally looked up at them. “They were asking me about dick sizes and wanted comparisons! I told them I saw those men as “uncles” and never thought of them like that. That’s when…” she trailed off breaking eye contact again.
"You don't want to see my new outfits, Papa? Daddy promised a cat walk," the little boy said sadly as the tension quickly sizzled in the room.
“You two going to start making out or what?” he sneered, encouraged by the small group of fellow fuckboys behind him.
“-Children are present!” Steve interrupted her in a high pitched voice as the redhead unceremoniously shoved the archer on the couch next to Daci.
“You wanna try? Please, be my guest,” his brother retorted. Buck threw the diaper on top of his drawing, hands on his hips as he stared at his little brother.
“Prolly has a tiny one,” Xavier muttered in support. She smiled at him, so incredibly thankful for her friend. In this uppity spoiled private school, she tolerated very few people.
“Not as often as I’d like,” he admitted sadly, taking another moment to look at his more recent photos before putting his phone away. The device immediately vibrated in his pocket, Tony pulling it out to see May calling him.
“I’m sorry I scared you Pete, I just went for a walk. I left a note but I think I left it too high for you to see it,” she explained gracefully, rocking the happy toddler in her arms.
“The doctor said you can’t rush these things, Sarah,” Joe said in concern. It was actually kind of cute how worried the man had been, especially since it made his wife crazy.
"You don't know what the end product is going to be? Man you are a braver daddy than I am," Pat teased as he fastened the apron around Miles.
"Hey little man, nice to meet you," his eldest smiled at the suddenly shy boy who cradled the toy in his arms. Peter's eyes made contact with the toy and smiled from ear to ear as he looked over to his dads.
“I...goddammit. Fine. I overheard him talking to Bucky about having second thoughts about our marriage.”
“Jay, have you seen my baby? About eight pounds, cute as hell and loud as all get out?” Tony sleepily asked the butler. The old man smiled before turning to the teen.
She soaked in Cara’s words as she walked to the elevator. She sounded genuine in her apology and kept the rest of the conversation light as she took them to the arcade next door. Joey kicked her ass in skee ball. That thought brought a smile to her face as she watched the numbers go to up to their floor.
“Is that what you want, Stark? For me to bend you over and punish you accordingly?” Steve whispered harshly while his hands roamed roughly over the smaller man he pinned down. Tony pushed his ass out, inviting whatever plans the super soldier concocted. “Wait,” he heard Steve’s unsure voice again, “do they sit on this table?”
About twenty minutes passed before he heard the familiar ding from the elevator, indicating his son was home. He glanced up at Peter and the classmate as they walked into the living room. The young girl had long brown hair and green eyes, tan skin and clothes that reminded him of his own hand-me-downs as a child. He smiled at the pair, stood up and offered his hand to introduce himself.
“Almost regret not getting a tattoo on my ass,” the brunette murmured as he wiggled his rear a little. Steve gently swatted said ass with a chuckle before responding.
“Sup?” she asked without looking at him as she stacked the papers evenly and started reading over the pages.
“How familiar are you with soulmate bonds?” the doctor asked after a moment. Tony sat frozen, not sure what to make of that question as the Beta continued. “They’re incredibly rare but they exist. There have been about less than a hundred recorded soulmate bonds in history, but there are documented cases. They’re said to even contain various powers. Like healing each other through the bond...and conquering infertility.”
He smiled and sat up a little as his father made his way over to his bed. The teen had still kind of expected more lecturing, but was pleasantly surprised when instead he moved some of his blankets, kicking his shoes off to climb in with him.
“And yet he had enough game to score this,” Wade suddenly spoke up, gesturing to his own body. “Plus your brother is doing a pretty big fucking favor so show some respect,” he added before smacking the teen on the back of the head.
“Bucky is he literally passed out on his floor?” Steve asked in concern, letting the irritation drip into his voice.
Bucky couldn’t believe he’d forgotten this man. This thirtysomething pouting in a hospital bed. After helping save his kid.
And if it happened to be next to the brunette, well, Steve was just making sure he was participating in the conversation. To not be rude.
Xavier huffed out a laugh in response, composing himself when she threw a mock glare in his direction.
His brother’s voice floated through his head, reminding him to never do this angry. Steve swallowed what anger he could as they stepped out of the elevator, walking to the living room.
"Why would I save you? Are you serious? What kind of question is that?" the princess joked lightly as Emerson smiled in response, deflating a little.
Maybe Tony had a point, he might be too mad to talk to her. His anger stayed burning in his chest as Tony put his arm around her, Steve only able to stare at that damn bottle.
"Um...yeah," she replied, looking over at Clint and noticing he had a weird look on his face. There was an awkward silence for a moment before Thor began pouring more drinks.
She looked at Tony, who was looking directly at her, before turning to look at Steve who had also turned to look directly at her.
“I know you’ve been teased at school for it. And when I stood up for you you literally yelled that you weren’t a damsel,” James muttered sheepishly, curling in on himself next to the blonde. Clint suddenly remembered that instance, guilt seeping in his pit for lashing out at this wonderful man.
She opened her eyes again, fidgeting in place as he walked over to her and handed her a bottle of red Gatorade. Her brows furrowed, taking it wordlessly as he sat on her bed a few feet from her. She popped it open to drink it, not particularly liking how calm he was being.
. Kill him, Weapon.” A million thoughts rushed through Bucky’s mind, but they all came to a halt when the small fingers gripping his wrist squeezed twice.
“Tony is technically short for Anthony and you would know if you’d join the team!” Tony whined at his best friend who only gave him an unimpressed look back at him. “How about I tell you over a cup of coffee?” he offered while standing up, knowing he needed one as well as the kids would be occupied with the toys for a bit.
"So you do want me?" the child asked quietly into Tony's shoulder, the billionaire quickly wrapping his arms around the boy in reassurance.
Nat and her girlfriend were going to Australia after graduation, the two talking about traveling before deciding on what school or career they wanted.
It was a stupid thing to do. Texting her. But then again, Joey was never really a smart kid. She knew this would only end in heartbreak.
"Wait, Tony are we not even going to talk about this?" The blonde asked incredulously. Tony shared a look with his daughter before addressing his love.
“Yeah, but I’m your impossible, Stevie,” he responded with an eyebrow wiggle, hoping the cheesy line would help get things back on track. He smiled and felt his chest warm up with the laugh that came from that beautiful man’s mouth. Though it did mean Steve let go of his shoulders and take two steps back. He suddenly got an idea that could further prove his sexual deviance.
“You sure we can’t meet this Wilson kid before you go? Share some embarrassing stories, snap a few pictures?”
“Come in,” he said as he sat up, knowing the odds of whoever it was on the other side that they would have just come in anyway. His eyes widened as Cheryl walked in, holding a mug of her amazing hot chocolate.
“Steve you mind watching the kid while I go to SHIELD for my evaluation?” Buck asked as Peter encouraged Daci to try the chocolate donut with sprinkles.
“Come on, Steve. If anything I owe you an apology for focusing on my boyfriend instead of you and your mother in a coma. The truth is,” Bucky continued after reaching a hand out to rest on the blonde’s shoulder, “we’re both growing up. We’ve both - shockingly enough - have long term boyfriends. They’re both short and weird little perverts but we confide in them instead of depending on friends or parents.” Steve stared at him for a moment as a smile crept across his face.
"Pop, do you want to know why I skipped school or continue answering your own question with hypothetical scenarios?" she asked, getting a snort of laughter from the genius. He quickly composed himself at his husband's look, clearing his throat to cover.
, not your completely fictional fantasy," his Pop quipped back, getting a laugh from Peter and Emerson. His Dad huffed before turning around to Peter, crossing his arms as he pouted.
He was glad to see Joey had showered and eaten, the two sitting in the living room with a half-eaten box of donuts while the teen sported damp hair. They stopped their conversation when Steve entered the room, the blonde glad to see an extra coffee sitting waiting for him at the spot next to Joey.
"Wow, okay. You are so paying for that at an undisclosed time and place. Now help me out of here," Daddy said with an outreached arm just as her Tati stood up and stepped away from the tub.
“She’s so small! I thought I could outrun her easily,” she said with a pout before hitting him again when he erupted into more laughter. Steve reached a hand over to pinch his husband’s leg, reminding him to lay off as the genius yelped in surprise.
He double checked that he had locked the door to his car before heading inside the high school to the front office. Behind the welcome counter were two teenage girls, office aids – he recognized, whose unprofessionalism showed the way their eyes comically bulged and gawked at the tired father with a forced smile. Of course he appreciated those that stood behind the symbol he had worked hard to cultivate, but right now he wasn’t Captain America – he was Steve who just hoped whatever damage had been done didn’t mean a lecture from Pepper...
“Ah. I see. Well there seems to be something else wrong with this picture…” Tony giggled before responding.
“Alright miss, up and at ‘em,” the man said, grabbing Joey’s arm and not-so-gently pulling her onto her feet.
“I’m only doing this for my love of Peter – who I expect to see frequently over the next 3 months.” He considered being offended but then changed his mind.
“Daci? JARVIS said someone was at my door. What’s up kiddo?” Clint asked with a yawn as he rubbed a hand over his face.
She’d never had a mother. Well, technically she did…for a few minutes. But then the universe ripped her away from the world.
“Please?” Steve added, kissing Tony’s neck with feather light kisses before pulling away to pepper some on his hair. “I’ll throw in a trip to the kitchen to get you coffee and chocolate…” that crafty bastard proposed, knowing Tony’s weaknesses. The genius couldn’t help but smile, wiping his eyes and nodding yes.
“I’ll be right back,” her Tati said with a groan, getting up off the couch and heading to Morgan’s room. It was also at that moment that an alarm went off and the ceiling robot spoke up.
“Aw, Peteroo that is so sweet!” she said as she enveloped her brother in another hug. “And that has nothing to do with the fact you get to eat some of these cookies and brownies, eh little brother?”
“An engagement ring, yeah.” She threw her hands up in excitement as she let out a cheer, letting out a laugh when some bubbles got on her father’s face. “I take it you like the idea?”
Peter was shell-shocked. Speechless. He knew he wasn’t the best at keeping secrets, but his biggest was already known by the person it was about?
“You were exactly the one who broke the glass by playing with your stupid robots when you’re drunk!” Pepper exclaimed, snapping Steve out of it as he helped the man with the cuts as Sam worked on the burns. He heard her escort the guests out of the room to give them more privacy.
Tony had fucked up. Royally fucked up. He had shut himself off in his lab most of the day realizing that he had fucked up the best thing that ever happened to him. It was a pattern, him being the one to screw up the relationship, inevitable to the fact that Steve was also completely out of his league. He did his best to have his PR guy take care of what he could, but it seemed the damage was already done.
“Tony,” he heard his husband say. He looked up into those beautiful blue eyes, knowing he could read his mind. “He’ll get through this. He’s our kid, remember?” The genius smiled at his love, knowing he was right. His smile faded as he looked down to the hand on his arm, the one with the silver band signifying their union.
“Yeah,” Steve whispered, “let’s put that off as long as possible,” he said as he snuggled more into Tony – who couldn’t help chuckle at that.
He was finishing his second run of the day, enjoying their long driveway when he saw his son-in-law’s car parked next to his. Steve slowed down, putting his hands on his hips as he finished walking to the front door, trying to remember if his son mentioned anything about visiting today.
"Hey guys, we gotta get heading back. Peter, Miles! You guys look so handsome," the blonde said as he smiled at their boys.
That’s what he concentrated on as Steve drove them to her apartment. That and having his kid back safe and sound. Before Steve could even park he was jumping out of the car, ignoring the blonde’s cries of protest to race up the several flights of stairs.
“Daci?” he called out quietly, checking every inch of the apartment as he heard Steve running to join him.
“I wasn’t being smart. There’s a lot of things wrong with me,” she said quietly as she suddenly looked down at her lap. Steve felt his anger only slightly dissipate.
“Right, well please ask for help the next time that happens. We have this giant here, let’s put him to good use and make him reach for things up high, alright?” Steve pinched the brunette’s side when he came into reaching distance, letting out a yelp and shooting the blonde a pout.
“Yes, well, I want to make sure my Pop gets a balanced meal…” The man turned to give her his infamous smirk, not believing her for a second. “…and if we so happen to see Thor…”
He looked around them, making sure no one was around before stopping Sam with a hand on his shoulder.
“Right? You’re welcome to take it with me,” he blurted, almost wondering if he shouldn’t have said it out loud. She’s probably still upset with him, as she just stared back at the man.
“ – He probably added you know, descriptors to it, etc” – it was at this point Peter gave her a playful shove, the light bulb going off on in Steve’s head that she was referencing something he didn’t know – “like, oh, I don’t know, Big Papa?”
“Tony Stark? Billionaire playboy? You’ve probably seen him on magazine covers in the grocery store, Mr. Lives-under-a-rock.”
“Babies smell like that Tony,” Joe said behind his magazine, unfazed by the glare the genius threw his way.
“Hey, none of that now,” he murmured in reassurance. “All is forgiven, you know Tony’s already forgiven you before he’s even heard the story. I’m sure he’ll lecture me later for even punishing you…” he tried to tease, except it didn’t help her guilt.
He could not believe his baby boy was going to prom. Wasn’t it just yesterday when they were teaching their Bambi how to ride a bike? When he would sneak into their bed late at night after having a nightmare? Insisting the two dress up for Halloween along with him? And now here Tony sat on the couch next to Emerson, watching Steve help Peter – who was mere inches shorter than the super soldier – with his bowtie.
“Hey, sorry hun, I needed to clean off some –” Tony halted a few feet from the couch, shrinking back when he saw how angry Steve was.
“You wear that little purple number and you’ve got yourself a deal,” the blonde said as he rolled the two so they were spooning on the bed, grinding himself against his husband’s ass to show him just how excited he was at the prospect.
“Sorry! It’s just…it’s been a while since I’ve seen you Uncle Phil,” he offered as he gave him a one armed hug before joining his dads on the couch. “I thought you were off planet for a while?” he hoped his voice sounded normal.
[Have you heard from Joey? I got off work early and she wasn’t at the apartment. Took her keys but left her phone…]
“She’s here to rub it in that Deadpool and Spiderman had to save your old sorry ass,” Sam quipped from behind Clint.
“And if you want to keep seeing them I suggest you go to sleep with me.” Tony huffed in response, probably pouting but Steve couldn’t see his beautiful face.
“And the bad news?” Joey asked quickly. The woman smiled at her before sitting forward in her chair to address the teen.
“Clint ma uraste,” she said before she burst into tears, unable to hold back any longer. Clint was the only one who liked her from the beginning, before they all felt sorry and or afraid of her. And now? {
They went to the same coffee shop he and Tony had went to, sharing stories and enjoying their coffee before the inevitable first call of the day.
“Why did you take a restraining order out on him?” he asked after they had showered and were getting dressed. He gave up with letting Tony lead, realizing maybe he actually needed prompting. He noticed his husband flinch, though, which made Steve feel guilty.
“Thanks Stevie, but that still doesn’t solve my sleep problem,” Bucky said as he took another gulp. “Plus I love her to death, but sometimes she kicks in her sleep.”
She was glad Peter didn’t end up getting suspended and that she only got two days suspension, since her Pops insisted on staying home with her and making her still do school work. She loves him, she really does. But two days of him talking nonstop made her dream of math class. She and Peter were riding the elevator up to their floor after her first day back at school, both singing along to “Bohemian Rhapsody.” It had come on the radio and pissed Happy off when they loudly sang along, so they continued in the elevator to finish the song free of old grumps.
“Pretty sure I’m the lucky one,” he said, before pointedly looking down at his husband’s crotch. His love shoved him lightly and took a step back.
So he figured since he was off tomorrow anyway – he’d give his husband space and time to tell him, while also bribing him.
“Can’t wait,” the Omega said with a blushing smile. Steve looked at them a moment longer before turning around to continue his run. The errands quickly flew out of his mind as he instead decided to run home and tell his brother the good news.
The man who held Miles scoffed as he handed him to another man who took Miles away. Hopefully going to release him and not harming the five year old. She couldn't tell, as three men approached her with huge smiles on their faces.
"Mhmm," she replied, clearly falling asleep. Tony followed Steve silently as they walked into her bedroom, preparing to tuck her in. He watched his love kiss her cheek before stepping back to give Tony room. The brunette leaned down, kissing her forehead and wishing that he could take her pain away. He knows she could have nightmares from this, quietly following his husband out before making a suggestion.
“He said I shouldn’t complain because I already ‘take it up the ass.’ I also confessed to Howard that Ty hit me, and the man said
“That I had no idea but that he should get you something nice though since apparently you’re paying for everything,” they both smiled at that. “And that, if he hurt you I’d rip his dick off and feed it to him.” Peter almost immediately fell off the bench from that. He regained his balance, looking at her smile realizing fully what she was saying. So, he did have a date for prom. Wade did actually say yes.
“Sounds good, you okay here with Daci? I’ve got a few SI things I promised Pepper I’d do. Figured I’d take care of it while they nap,” Tony said just as quietly as he stood up and shifted Morgan in his arms.
“I’m losing this long gorgeous hair of yours,” Clint pouted with his bottom lip out, running his hands through the long brown locks.
“There has to be something they can do,” Tony said more seriously, not looking up at one of his oldest friends as he stared at the drink in his hands.
“But, you’re so hot?” he said as James’ brows shot up, looking the blonde up and down before scoffing at him.
She shook her head no with a small smile of her own, not wanting to cause any more stress to the man by making the boy scream again.
Joey climbed off his lap and made her way to the elevators, obviously aware of the plan beforehand. Steve waited until she left to get it out.
“Goons are taken out. Tasha is helping Bruce back to the quinjet, no sign of Strucker. What’s the plan here?”
Even though he’d already met Harley, Tony kept the two separate for the first few dates, explaining to Steve that he didn’t want Harley to get attached until it was more serious. And that was after about the fifth date, as the two had discovered that the “L” word - though early - felt right.
“You...you’d spar with me?” she asked skeptically, following the man after a moment and frowning at the weird boxes he was trying to move.
“Yeah, guess I gotta catch up to you guys,” Tony said as he downed the whiskey without even making a face.
“-I’M NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU!” Steve shouted before immediately lowering his voice. “I’m majoring in ‘undeclared’ at a community college. You’re going to MIT,” Steve added, unable to add more to his point when Tony suddenly peeled out of the parking lot and sped across the streets. “Tony? What the hell? What are you doing? Where are we going?” he asked, panic in his voice as he hastily buckled his seat belt.
"If Clint's okay with that, I think we can do that," Bucky said, already knowing the answer and moving back to the chair so the two can snuggle together.
"Mr. Independent is right," his Dad added as Peter laughed and saw his Pop's eyes roll. Emerson laughed as well and continued just watching silently.
“Oh, no you’re right,” she said, too pissed to stop herself. “The word ASS is wayyy worse than homophobia. My sincerest apologies,” she said with her normal teenage attitude currently in overdrive.
“Josephine, get to class before I write you up for cussing,” he said – the only person who called her by her full name.
Emerson was already there, tears in her eyes as she squatted next to her crying brother, holding his phone to her ear. She looked up, helpless, as the two superheroes made their way to comfort their crying son.
He suspected foul play as she dodged his questions, namely where they were meeting this guy at as she drove them somewhere near the outside of the city.
“S-Steve,” Tony hiccuped, unable to say anything else when his husband smacked their mouths together in a harsh kiss. The brunette could only hold on tight, melting into a puddle.
“Oh yeah? You’d kick his ass for me?” he asked with a smile. She pulled away again to look at him before answering.
And since she didn’t want any company, she avoided reaching out to her friends. So she went alone to her luckiest liquor store to see if she could score. She had fifty dollars cash, it should be fairly easy.
"I've heard about you as well," Klaue said as he cocked his head to the side. "I was being selfish, wanting to kill your brother. With you, my men can have some fun before taking your life. They're such hard workers, they deserve a treat once in a while," he laughed as the men joined in laughing with him.
It’s funny, even though he was the strictest disciplinarian – he was also somehow the absolute best cuddler – giant and strong arms engulfing her in a bear hug that was almost like a cure all on its own.
Which was why it made sense, seeing the redhead storming towards him first thing Monday morning as he continued avoiding his boyfriend in favor of hiding beside the school.
“Um, okay...Tony works in the lab for too long at a time. Like three days in a row.” The statement, though brought upon by his husband, upset the man like a petulant child.
“I’ve started boxing too, Buck. Give me a few more months and I’ll happily kick your ass,” Steve whispered as he pulled the cart along with him, eyes falling on his cereal.
, is approaching complete strangers to harass them when they're clearly trying to comfort a crying child," he spat at them, only pulling back when he felt his boyfriend physically did so. The two sputtered in response as Wade led the three away from the nasty couple.
. And admitting to being a victim will probably only make him love you more. Well, that and he’ll probably be extra protective and possessive of you…which I also happen to know is one of your kinks…” she paused as Tony snorted with laughter.
“Daddy! Papa! You’re home!” the boy shouted in excitement before running over to the pair. Their no-longer-youngest had his jaw dropped as he realized what the parents had without even knowing the kid at that age.
“Did you hear?” he asked the blonde, not acknowledging the other people in the room as he waited for his oldest friend to give him vindication. Maybe have him convince Fury to hire her back.
“We’re here for Tony, miss,” he heard his godfather say kindly, though his eyes were still trained on his father who was glowering right back at him.
"Well, Pop, like you...I also happen to have a sugar daddy," he said, hoping to ease the tension in the room. It made his sister and Dad howl with laughter, while his Pop simply crossed his arms in response. Peter smiled a little at his family, knowing his Pop well enough to know he'd argue against him.
“Cause you’re not going back to your floor?” Steve asked, pointing out the lack of movement from the brunette.
Not necessarily in the bad way, when she first arrived and felt left out. But still in a way that felt like a trance and was hard to shake out of.
"Ugh, he can try. He just likes practicing braiding on my hair," she responded, getting another laugh from the father.
Tony noticed her grimace at the prospect, but declined saying anything when he heard the little patting of feet, turning to smile as Peter rejoined them.
The women were rarely as willing to commit a crime, so she usually looked for older men that were easy targets.
“Lunch is ready!” he called to the people in the living room, smiling at the sound of tiny pounding feet joining them in the dining room. Even though Nat and Clint joined them, they kept themselves fairly clean and after lunch everyone migrated down to the gym floor - minus Tony and Bruce, who were still down in the lab.
She offered to carry the boy up the elevator, where Tony legitimately offered her a well-paid babysitting position. She looked like she was considering it as they made their way to the living room, laying Peter down next to them to let him sleep a few more minutes as they ordered food together.
“Actually! Sir! These three came up to the young lady. They’re the ones that started it,” came a woman in her thirties.
“It’s to help you when times get tough, or you doubt my love for you. That book got me through a lot of heartache over the years.” Steve was somehow more confused, looking back and forth between the book and the book giver. The bastard only chuckled, not explaining anything, before he sat on the floor and motioned for Steve to join him.
“Vigilante business isn’t all autographs and hero worship, my friend. Especially for a goddamn infant,” Wade snapped at the teen, making Peter breathe a sigh of relief. He had almost forgotten how protective Wade had become of both Emerson and Miles since they married.
She bid them both goodnight, walking away as they watched her leave; Tony wondering if she’d ever feel comfortable enough to take him up on his offer.
His Dad looked at his watch before adding, “I realize you’re both teen boys, but maybe next time one of you can keep an eye on the time instead getting lost in video games? You’re half an hour late Peter.”
“You were just doing it! What now that a camera’s on you you wanna pretend you don’t wanna try anymore?” Bucky asked with a frown.
was a spoiled brat, and trust me – you are a much better kid than I was.” His smile grew when Peter actually giggled at that.
“Please, Daddy?” he asked with his puppy eyes as he lowered himself so he could look up at Tony. The man pouted at his son before turning to pout at Steve. Peter turned his attention to his Pop as well and also pouted with his Dad.
“Goddammit,” he said before looking up at the two confused people. “All this time I thought you were turning into Bucky…but I’ve
“Oh, that fucker is going down,” he growled out, crossing his arms as he looked like he was plotting the most evil demise ever. His expression quickly softened as he looked back up at her, demeanor changing as well.
She sat there torn. Part of her thought she deserved to pout alone in bed, hours before she could finally see Tony. She didn’t deserve comfort right now.
“Please do Miss” came the reply from the AI, Emerson noting the hint of exasperation in the bot’s voice.
“But it also brought you to us. And for that, my beautiful, kind, badass, baby girl, I am grateful.” He paused when she put her head down with a smile and a blush. “I love you very much, Emerson.”
“Are you calling me a sexual deviant, Captain?” Tony looked back up and let out a small chuckle with how red his husband’s face had turned.
cheated on me. Said the thoughts were as bad as actions – he was drunk when he did this, by the way – and said a bunch of other horrible things. Including that he wasn’t worth it.”
“Okay, so Pepper watches Peter until eleven when Jo comes home. How does that sound?” he asked the two. Jo rolled her eyes at that, but nodded reluctantly.
“It is Friday, Stevie. Tony asked us to come stay for a few days to help,” his Pop said with a smile, taking what looked like packages of food to the kitchen.
He didn’t comment on that, just tucked himself under the blanket to make himself comfortable as he continued smiling at her.
He carefully stepped over the puppy currently investigating the food bag to pull James into a heated kiss, pouring all of his love into it in hopes of the other teen understanding.
“Does this have anything to do with that girl you punched a few weeks ago?” Steve asked, realization clicking in when she blushed at the question.
“I know,” she returned, rolling her eyes as she smashed herself further into his embrace. He chuckled at that, humming to himself as the two sat there quietly for another moment. Before the bastard interrupted the silence.
“Captain returned approximately two minutes ago and is currently using your shower,” the AI replied.
“Ow! Hey! What do you expect of me when an Adonis shows up in my house?” the brunette said, smiling as he heard Sam laugh next to Steve. He shot his partner a glare and was disappointed when the man just kept smiling.
Clint sat on Buck’s lap with the crowded seating, not that the brunette minded at all. Tasha sat next to him and warned the older teen she’d be stealing his date for a few dances this evening. Again, Bucky didn’t mind, tightening his arms around his love when the blonde tried to crawl through the sunroof.
"You're Mama was a smart woman, Miles," Tony said at a smiling boy who suddenly jumped into the genius' embrace.
"Yeah I have a picture of what I'm thinking of," Emerson spoke up with a smile, dancing a little in her chair next to a grinning Miles.
Without a word he brought her to her room himself, rubbing her back along the way before sitting the two on her bed. She clung to him, feeling childish but pushing those feelings away like he told her to.
“But! That’s not even whyyyyy,” Clint whined again, even adding some foot stomping for good measure.
“Can we talk, sweetheart?” he asked gently. Tony was always careful with his words, she appreciated that.
“No, Peter, you’re not spoiled. Did someone at school tell you that?” he asked trying to figure out where this came from.
“Don’t worry, we’re the ones that get to take him home,” Steve whispered before placing a kiss on his cheek. Tony smiled as he stroked the strong arms wrapped around his middle.
“Oh you are just like your Daddy,” Steve said as he kissed the boy loudly on the cheek before gently placing him back on his feet. The boy giggled some more before standing in front of the man and doing his best Tony impression – which was pretty damn good.
“Wow,” Jo said, “If anyone else had gotten knocked up by Tony Stark, they’d exploit it for all it’s worth. You guys kept Peter a secret, you don’t take more child support than you need to, heck if I was in your shoes I’d be a stay-at-my-home/mansion-mom,” she said with a laugh. May shook her head fondly, laughing along with the teen.
“Smart for a blonde?” he asked as he continued his torture, the brunette’s laugh was music to his ears. Just when he thought Bucky would concede, the older teen reached his hands around and pinched the blonde’s ass.
“Nice to finally meet you both! When Stevie told us that not only had he found the perfect Omega, but that the cutie came with a pup and a soul bond we thought he was pulling our leg! I’m so happy you’re real,” the other Alpha said with a teasing wink, making Steve’s cheeks flush pink in embarrassment as his Pop pulled his Omega into a hug.
“– regardless, you liked it right? You liked it when he…called you Big Papa?” Her previous stoic face was quickly crumbling at what Steve assumed was her own joke. He was starting to feel insecure.
“Alright now you’ve gone too far,” Clint teased, pulling away from his offended boyfriend. He took a breath to ease his anxiety, rolling his eyes when he saw that not only was James giving him his respectable distance - he was also smiling with that stupid proud smile of his. “Shut up.”
“Let me rephrase that,” the woman said with a no-bullshit look, “you need a drink?” she finished with her hands resting on her hips in challenge.
"Yeah well," Steve responded, "it's her hair, her Dad's the one whose going to throw a temper tantrum."
"Happy birthday Emerson," her Dad said as he walked over and wrapped her in a hug. She thanked him after he kissed the top of her head, letting her go as he went to get more coffee. Her Pop turned back around after he turned off the stove, wiping his hands before walking over to her.
The music was pretty decent, but he was waiting for Steve before actually joining the others on the dance floor. So he stood next to Bruce, chatting about his latest invention and definitely not counting down the seconds until Steve should arrive. Tony estimated it would take at least twenty minutes for the blonde to shower...pause to vividly imagine...and get dressed.
He blinked several times in surprise at her, should’ve guessed she knew him better as a smile broke across his face.
“No of course not! JARVIS said he made it to his bed. He had crutches and everything, don’t give me that look,” the brunette said with a pout, getting Steve to drop the glare that had settled on his face. And also wonder what Bucky was still doing here.
“I did this for you, my ungrateful husband,” he huffed out. “If anything, it’s you who owes me, your brave and daring man.” Steve chuckled at that, hefting the man a little higher in his grasp as he continued their journey back.
“Cause, it’s just another thing to add to your list of things stressing you out, and anxiety is something I already have!” he pouted in his defense. The blonde rolled his eyes fondly before leaning back to address him more seriously.
Steve gently raised Tony by his chin to face him again, sadness heavily painted all over his handsome face.
“What happened with Clint?” the blonde asked, interrupting his thoughts and cutting to the core like the sorceress she was. His expression didn’t help, frowning when the woman just smiled back at him but giving in nonetheless.
drive drunk?” He finished before clearing his throat to get a hold of himself. He watched her curl her arms around herself in response, still not looking at Steve. He stared down at her, seeing she wasn’t going to answer him just yet.
But then…his ridiculous husband ground his pelvis down onto his and Tony couldn’t help wrapping a hand around the back of the man’s neck to bring him into a sloppy kiss.
“I’d really rather not,” the blonde said honestly. It wasn’t anything against Coulson, he actually liked the guy. It was the damn heart-to-heart vibes radiating off the man. He just knew if he went down to that office Coulson would get the dam to break.
“Ah! I’m sorry! It was dangerous…and I could’ve died!” she hiccupped a sob between breaths, wondering if she could pass out from this kind of pain.
“I’m going to make some tea,” the doctor said quietly, standing up and triggering Bucky’s reflexes. He moved to stand in front of the man when the redhead suddenly appeared in between them, blocking Bucky from his target. But before he could attack, the doctor spoke up again.
After a moment he pulled away, releasing James’ wrists as he sat back on his lap, still straddling his legs.
“That’s a great idea!” Steve said plating some of the pancakes before handing them to her. “I didn’t have anything planned today besides make sure this one ate and slept,” nodding towards to brunette, who had a mockingly “hurt” look on his face.
“Papa it’s too tight!” the boy complained loudly as he looked on the verge of a tantrum. May joined them a moment later, bless that beautiful woman, as she quickly joined Peter’s side.
“I hate being in foster care,” the boy said angrily as Emerson felt her expression change to a worried one.
“Hey,” she said, continuing when he made eye contact. “For the record, in case it wasn’t completely obvious, I am so
But the things is – Steve wasn’t whole when he met Tony either. He was a little broken. And as cliché as it is to think they complete each other…they kind of did and still do. Balanced each other’s crazy and insecurities and built something stronger out of it.
Since he wasn’t drinking, he entertained himself throughout the evening by watching Tony try desperately to flirt with Steve while the blonde stayed blissfully unaware that that was what he was doing. Buck couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the two, nodding to Natasha who stayed in the room while he let himself wander the mansion.
“Joey, when I said I didn’t want kids, it was because I was closeted 22 year old and was pissed about it. It wasn’t because I didn’t enjoy little people…having kids would’ve felt like…conforming to the very hetero-normative ideas that oppressed me to the point of waiting 30 years to come out. You think I didn’t want you? Kid,” great, he was hoping he could hold off on the tears. “I’ve loved you since the moment I held you the day you were born. I stayed with you while your dad…stayed with your mom,” he said carefully.
She took another moment before making her way inside, stopping to talk to her favorite receptionist – Gladys – who was an eccentric older woman who always made her feel welcome there.
And, as it turned out, Tony Stark was kind of a dork. He didn’t come across as the ‘spoiled brat’ Sam had painted him to be. He was even creative, like way more creative than Steve thought possible.
“I don’t know, but we need a vacation soon,” Steve suggested. “Maybe just the two of us at a secluded beach?” he asked with a smile.
– when Jarvis informed him he was receiving a call from the high school Peter and Emerson attend. Offering a “thanks J” to the ceiling, the exhausted soldier picked up his phone, dreading whatever this was about.
“That Carolyn is a disgusting hag and doesn’t deserve Joey,” he said, enjoying the laugh it got out of his husband. “And…” he continued more seriously, “I want to tell her it’s okay to lose family members that don’t love you. That she gets to decide who her family is from those who actually love her.”
He thinks sadly as he sits on the passenger side of the car, not even bothering lecturing Tony about his fast driving.
“You cannot go naked to the grocery store. You have to wear clothes,” he said for the thousandth time, holding out the cute dress he’d picked out for her.
and tease Clint for having little kids and...I didn't know if you two would want to meet him let alone let him stay here or anything like that -"
That image did not help his heart, though he pushed through the pain to walk over to the boy with his arms reaching out for him.
He focused his attention on the beautiful man in front of him, running his hand through the brown curls that were getting long.
“Especially when you pull stupid shit like this. Because you, Tony, you of all people deserve to be reminded how incredible you are. And I am just the man for that job,” his cheesy, dorky, wonderful husband practically purred above him, washing away the last of Tony’s worries.
...yeah there was no way she would win that argument. She certainly didn’t feel comfortable telling him the truth…if he’d even believe her right now.
“Talk to me first, then you can have your wicked way with me.” The genius could only scoff at that, disappointed his deflection didn’t work.
His belly...it was gone. His hands grabbed onto his mostly flat stomach as the Omega burst into tears. He’d lost the baby.
“Thanks guys, I’ll see you later,” Joey said as she got out of their car and headed into the mansion. If she can pull it off, she’s going to plan her eighteenth birthday – which is in several weeks – to play paintball with a small group. Peter wouldn’t be able to play, but he could cheer and watch them from the sidelines.
“Jesus,” Steve blurted out. Tony snorted out a laugh, equally puzzled by this entire situation – but with considerably more sleep than the blonde.
“I’m sorry it was rough today, Em, for the record – your Pop and I are really proud of you,” he said before taking a moment to look at her. She gave him a small smile in return before turning to look out the passenger window.
Steve leaned the extra inch to kiss his lips, smiling as the brunette returned the kiss. Tony pulled back first, surprising the blonde as he smiled at the man before he rested his head in the crook of Steve’s neck. Steve ran a hand up and down Tony’s back, smiling when the man essentially purred in response. After a few minutes he realized they probably shouldn’t fall asleep on the couch, gently shifting Tony away from him. The man’s eyes were closed, though they blinked open from the shifting as a frown appeared on his face.
Tony tried to blink away the tears, smiling at his beautiful husband. “Of course, Steve,” interrupted from saying anything else when the super soldier crashed their lips together. They both laughed some more, kissed some more, exchanged several more declarations of love as Steve put the band on Tony’s ring finger next to his wedding ring.
Tony was waiting for them in the living room, looking relieved as he saw Joey trailing behind him. He immediately frowned at the sight of her, sitting up straighter.
They agreed to wait until Peter was asleep before going to Joey’s room to talk to her. The boy had asked for his Daddy to put him to bed that night, his husband quickly obliging as Steve made himself busy cleaning up the kitchen. Jo was already in her room, where she’d been most of the evening, so Steve tried to be patient as he finished wiping the counters down.
“Of course they bonded quickly, the man gave him ice cream!” Pete exclaimed incredulously as he then heard his little brother cry out for help.
“You know, Staci, you could probably stand to get your carpet munched. Might even make you less of a bitch,” she retorted, smiling back at her as the crowd erupted in laughter.
“-you’re not getting out of babysitting, Barton. Up and at’em,” the older brunette said, shaking his free hand at the other man again. Clint stole a look at Daci, who was secretly hoping he’d join them, before grabbing the man’s hand to stand up fully.
“Maybe she actually wants to walk to her Daddy,” Bucky said as he stretched his arms out to encourage her to walk to him. Steve had her wrap her tiny hands around his index fingers, lightly supporting her first few steps before letting her go. She took two whole steps before falling forward and into Bucky’s arms.
“Daddy spanked me, Nana,” Joey tattled again and threw another glare at Buck, making Steve snort from laughter. He composed himself with the glare his brother sent him.
For the second time this week, she was stuck being lectured to by her most recent social worker. This old geezer obviously didn’t give two shits about her, obviously annoyed to even have her in his office to read the complaints he had been getting about her. She already knew he was planning on sending her somewhere new. “New school, new foster family.” Since the last family didn’t work out, thanks to her – he reminded her, she would transfer to a “promising family” in New York. Start at a new high school half-way through her sophomore year.
“Oh no! Where did Joey go?” Bucky asked, pretending he couldn’t hear the laughing toddler hiding behind Steve. “Steve, have you seen my baby girl?”
Steve thought seven was a reasonable time for Tony to finally wake up – but apparently Peter thought it was five. Insisted on it, according to May’s voicemail. She had to go to work anyway, so Pepper and Rhodey met her at the hospital to take Pete for her.
“The bruises…” she began, looking up at the super soldier. His face suddenly got more serious, unsure how to tell Natasha. He should’ve known someone with her past would’ve immediately recognized them.
“Oh my god, Daci...did...did you write your name?” he asked quietly with a weird expression. Her excitement fumbled as she nodded in response. A smile quickly broke across her face, though, when he yanked her up into a hug. “I’m so proud of you, cub,” he said as she returned the embrace, before he carried the two over to sit on the couch next to Clint.
Half an hour later, he pulled up outside of Steve’s apartment, suddenly having second guesses about all of this. The urge to see him won him over though, reminding himself that Steve hadn’t left angry. He got out of his lambo, locking it before steeling himself to walk to the door and knock. A few seconds later Steve answered, looking surprised but not mad that Tony had showed up unannounced.
Naïve for a six year old, but then again – it’s not like the sixteen year old was any better at knowing what love was. Her mind drifts back to the present, blinking away treasonous tears from her eyes. She took a few more minutes to compose herself before heading to the elevator and pressing the button to her floor.
“I think you can manage sleeping in your sweats, huh?” she asked more to herself than to Tony as she searched around the room. Finding what she was looking for, she walked over to the empty glass on Steve’s bedside table before going to the bathroom to put some water in it.
“Can you take me back to bed, Daddy?” Peter asked after taking a bite from the cookie Tony had handed him.
Obadiah had Howard on his feet when Tony looked back at them. He grinned when he noticed his father sporting a swollen black eye.
“Yeah? Which one is your favorite? Mine is my Uncle Bruce! He’s the Hulk,” Peter chatted as the two moved out of the closet, Steve ignoring the scoff from his husband.
Tony looked into those fucking beautiful and intoxicating baby blues, wishing he had any will power against them.
Leonardo Rodriguez, a ‘troubled’ seven year old who was recently taken by the state away from his father. His abusive, drug addicted, violent motherfucker of a father. Which in turn, unsurprisingly, made Leo a ‘violent child’ according to his case files. He’d never hold that against the kid, but he had two babies (and honestly, his own mental health) to consider.
“Of course! You know, if you think you’re ready then why not?” Steve added, hoping he sounded nonchalant.
“Mhmm. He was a million times worse than you, let me tell you,” she threw a wink at Buck, who rolled his eyes at the woman. “Your Daddy got into trouble a lot when he was your age. One time, he cracked all of my eggs under the dining room table while I was folding laundry,” she said, smiling when the girl in her arms giggled at that.
“Are you going?” Daci asked her father. She wouldn’t mind him going, especially since Harley had been clingy with Tony all morning.
“You have nothing to be sorry for, this isn’t your fault,” he assured, looking into his eyes. Tony gulped in uncertainty and looked away, causing Steve to gently grab his face in his hands, leaning down to kiss his lips.
Tony continued thinking about Steve even when they finished building a lego tower that Harley immediately destroyed pretending to be Godzilla.
“Hmm. Should we go see Peter? Or is he in timeout?” she asked, getting a chuckle from the tired husband and father.
It was a short walk to the store, but by the time she was finally dressed and had also insisted on walking most of the way, they found Buck with a mostly full basket of groceries.
“Emerson,” the woman whispered voice thick with tears. The teen remained turned away from her birth mother, but her feet didn’t move as she waited. “Remember,
“You’re right. I’ll ask her out, thanks Stevie,” Bucky said as he stood up off his stool. Steve’s face scrunched up in confusion, mouthing
,” she said, smiling with her parents who laughed along with her. “No, you guys! She’s so fast! I literally tried to outrun her!” she said before bursting into laughter. Steve rolled his eyes fondly as he continued laughing at the image.
“No, no of course that’s not a deal-breaker,” the genius said in reassurance, counting this as the perfect time to admit his own secret.
“Alright, hurry back so we can eat,” Clint said in reply, struggling with a squirmy baby. The two ran the fifteen feet to the restrooms before splitting for their designated rooms. Daci was done quickly, but didn’t beat Peter, who was just outside talking to an adult.
Yeah it was probably for the best he was in the waiting room along with the rest of his family. He momentarily wonders if his parents would’ve come if they hadn’t died in a car accident when he was twenty, but shakes his mind of it when his father-in-law hands him his coffee.
“Five, I told you I had a big sister at Stark’s party,” Bucky said as he led the two to the kitchen, where Clint was simultaneously thanking him for bringing that up while also noticing the final ‘monster’ already in the kitchen.
“Cause I’m it for you too,” Steve said with a big grin, which grew when Tony rolled his eyes at that.
He felt his love kiss his temple, just as exhausted as the genius. He pulled away enough to look at his husband, leaning in to kiss his lips.
She took her face out of his neck long enough to answer, but still turned away unable to fully face him.
“Did...did you experience bad homes?” he asked shyly. She took a deep breath before answering his question, not wanting to lie to the boy.
“Yeah...and you still want to be with my brother?” the older blonde asked. Bucky chuckled again as he heard his boyfriend defend his own honor.
“She has epilepsy; diagnosed when she was 10. She’s been great about taking her meds, I don’t think I’ve seen her have a seizure in almost 2 years…” he said in confusion as he wiped some of the sweat from her face.
“Plus this will serve as payback for those ‘toys’ in there,” Steve added with a smug grin as he pulled back, grabbing some wipes before making his way back to the kids. Tony followed, still in somewhat of a daze as he watched Steve help clean both Rhodey and Morgan.
“Woah,” she heard him say before he returned the hug. “What’s up Jo? Bad dream?” he asked her quietly. She only cried at that, tightening her hold on him.
“You’re right, he’s actually a coward. You could totally kick his ass,” he said confidently as she wiped her eyes tiredly.
“Hey!” Xavier said to get her attention, continuing when she blinked herself awake. “You is a gay nerd, where is your anger?”
Needless to say, the other players groaned but let them be, just walking around the two as they made their exit.
“Please! He’s not actually my type, I just decided to keep him around cause it meant having you in my life,” she looked at Tony who was trying not to laugh aloud at Steve…who was still glaring at him.
“Hey guys, Em, glad to see you back, can I get you guys anyth-” Steve stopped his sentence when his eyes noticed the dark marks on her back. She was leaning over their art piece and hadn’t noticed her sweater rode up, revealing old and new scars. Realizing his silence, she quickly pulled her clothes back down, not making eye contact with either.
The coaches turned back to their players when they noticed the fight broke up. It probably didn’t help that Joey turned to walk in the opposite direction of them, but she didn’t want to talk to anyone right now and didn’t need nosy grown men in her business.
Steve then kissed yet another ‘lab incident’ scar on the back on his neck, smiling when his husband hummed happily.
He and Steve got married after Tony graduated from MIT, but held off having kids as Steve continued figuring out what he wanted to do. He still did art, and took some commissions for local galleries, but after Buck got back the two went to school to be paramedics.
"Alright J, I'll be right up," the genius responded before turning back to the bot. "You, go power down, I don't trust you around all this stuff." The bot only chirped in response, not moving. The man looked at the bot a moment longer, staring down the hunk of junk before it chirped in defeat and moved to follow orders.
“Shh no baby, that is not true at all,” she heard him say with a waver in voice. “Your Daddy would be so proud of the young woman you’re becoming,” he said, pausing to tighten his arms around her further.
“Well done my young padawan! Do you want a hug, because we’re hugging now.” Emerson pretending to look uncomfortable and groaned as Tony pulled her into a hug.
“You read my case file?” she said accusingly, cringing at her own harsh tone. She felt her old walls go rigid with defense.
Steve got the call while he was working at his grandfather’s gym, a frantic Tony who said Tiberius was supposed to pick Harley up from school an hour ago but had flaked at the last second. Stone hadn’t even called Tony himself, he’d had his secretary do the dirty work.
"Okay! I give Papa I'll stay!" Harley cried out, pushing against Steve's face and wiggling in his grasp as the Alpha continued his assault. Trying a different tactic to get away from the Alpha, Harley reached his little arms towards Tony, who instinctively reached for his oldest. "Daddy help!" Harley laughed as Tony pried the boy from Steve's arms, lifting his son up out of the water and settling the wet boy on his lap to let him catch his breath.
"I'm good," Steve said, shifting on the couch to face the two. "Any regrets yet?" he teased to his big brother.
“Okay Papa,” a sleepy Harley replied, snuggling closer into the Alpha as Steve stood the two up before walking them back inside. He spotted Howard first, who smiled at the pair before turning to the living room.
They moved to follow, but then a siren went off as the same time that their phones alerted them of an Avenger's emergency.
“I don’t drink,” he said without thinking, as it was always his automatic response but now seemed kind of rude in the moment. He didn’t have time to cringe as Tony continued talking unfazed.
“Sorry you just, have a lot of missed calls from ‘Joey’,” Tony tried to say nonchalantly, though his voice wavered that gave away his insecurity. Steve took the phone from him, checking the messages and groaning loudly.
But right now, she was actually genuinely concerned for her mental health. She had just finished grad school but wouldn’t have gotten through it without her wife. Shuri was her rock, and always knew exactly what to say or do to help her. Not that her parents hadn’t been great…but the love of her life was the love of her life for a reason.
“No…apparently our picture was taken last night…” Steve said angrily at the realization of the lack of privacy. The truth is he knew this was inevitable, but the other voicemails is what pissed him off.
“Okay, Daci gets three extra seconds. Daci, ready? Set? Go!” Peter yelled before she took off, distantly hearing him begin counting down from three again as she had hightailed it to the other side of the floor.
"By the way you're invited for Christmas," James said before pulling him in to kiss. "But if you don't want to-"
“Hey I don’t know about you guys, but I’m so hungry I could eat a giraffe,” Clint said loudly while rubbing his stomach.
“Then we’re sorry,” Janet piped in, “but we can’t let you back there without ID. There’s a lot of crazy Iron Man fanatics running around out there. Wouldn’t want to put Mr. Stark in any kind of danger.” The two hyenas laughed at the apparent joke. Her clenched fists began to tremble as the tears flowed freely.
“Oh, Petey-pie, what are you doing up, honeybun?” the blonde whispered as he rubbed their son’s back in comfort. “Of course Daddy isn’t dying. His heart just needs a little work done. Like you and Daddy do in his lab with his robots? He just needs a minor surgery and then he’ll be all better, I promise.”
When he heard the door close, Steve spoke to Peter. “Is she okay? I hope I didn’t scare her or anything.”
“HEY! I----I wasn’t the one who broke the glass!” yelled the short brunette who made his way into view. Steve immediately became distracted at the sight of the beautiful olive-skinned man stumbling his way over to the group. He recognized him from the magazines, hair a little messy from drinking but still rocking a well tailored suit.
“You are absolutely right!” he quickly agreed and changed his demeanor. “I should really make an effort to visit my husband at his workplace more often! You are truly a genius my dear.” Joey couldn’t help laughing at that, knowing that man was also full of shit as they made their way to pick up some food to bring to Steve.
"I thought so too!" Wade said with a little exasperation, smiling at Emerson. "Little man must be cheating or something," the older man said as he suspiciously looked at the gloating five year old.
“I love you,” Bucky said easily, feeling it with every fiber of his being. The comment slowed Clint down a little, looking softer as the blonde smiled back at him.
“You...you distracted me,” Tony replied weakly, a pout still on his cute face as he got another sheet of paper to copy whatever had been written on the other.
. It’s...I don’t know it’s almost like I’m in love with you or something,” he finished, ducking his head from the confession.
“JustrememberedhavetotalktoPeteaboutbrotherstuff-” Miles rushed out as an angry Peter allowed himself to be dragged down the hallway and into the nearest bathroom.
“In Tasha’s purse,” Clint answered easily, shrugging his shoulders as well. Bucky chuckled and shook his head fondly before addressing him more seriously.
"She can call me whatever she wants," Tony said with a smile as he kissed the baby several times on her adorable face. "She can even add 'Lady' to the front, I don't care." They turned their attention to the giggling toddler, who was currently being thrown in the air by their teenager.
“Besides,” Tony continued with a sly smile, “I think this means I owe you a few photos...anything in particular you want to see me in? Or see in me?” He felt Steve harden below him, chuckling while the blonde just looked flustered.
“Say that again, just for the record,” Tony teased between yawns. Steve found himself smiling despite his ridiculous man.
He was thankfully distracted from any deprecating thoughts as his family enjoyed meeting his old friend.
“J where is everyone?” she asked the AI as she made her way to the kitchen, placing the stack on the counter top.
“Leo!” he shouted in an attempt to stop the boy, dodging strangers along the way. Leo kept running until Peter was finally able to grab him by the arm and yank him into the closest alley.
But he was still silent as he kept walking over to the couch, before turning around to sit. She stopped short and just stood, waited for him to speak but ended up talking first when he simply reached over to grab his drawing pad.
The blonde instantly froze at that, Tony grinning as Steve’s face began to blush furiously while his blue eyes widened. The song also ended at that time, which had Steve quickly release Tony and take an awkward step back. The blonde blinked several times while he also opened and closed his mouth, clearly flustered.
is doing just fine, no thanks to you," Tony said, anger somehow spiking higher when the Alpha rolled his eyes and scoffed. "Look, I get it, okay? I get that you are a spoiled privileged Alpha whose never had anyone use their Voice on them, but it sucks. Harley was catatonic, Ty. We're lucky it was stupid school kid who was experimenting as opposed to someone that could've actually taken advantage of him. Did you know before the Omega Rights Act, Alphas could use their Voice to -
“Uh…Cap?” Sam asked at the entrance to the break area. Steve and Natasha were sitting on the couch together while Clint and Thor had gone out to get the food.
For a fraction of what it was worth. Obadiah retired still a millionaire, which didn't leave much for his worthless son. Tony shut down the company, but kept all the workers - simply transferring them to SI.
“…And as I put her to bed that night, I thought…she is too innocent for this. She’s too precious to go through so much pain. So I sang her favorite songs, kissed her a hundred times…and covered her mouth with my hand…until she stopped breathing.” She closed her eyes before continuing, tears spilling down her cheeks.
She looked down at the boy, who was thankfully still concentrating on his drawing, before quietly getting up and making her way to Tony’s lab.
hadn’t returned Steve’s call and had just let her come back early? Without her meds? He was planning on giving her a piece of mind about that.
Steve got the vacuum cleaner out when he had swept up most of the mess, turning to his big brother who was frowning at the sight.
It took longer for Miles to regain consciousness this time. When he did, he noticed he wasn’t crushed to death. Glancing around showed that he had fallen clear of the majority of the debris, but was still kind of trapped underneath some metal.
She had already met Pepper when she first got here, but seemed glad to see her again when she brought along Rhodey and Sam for lunch another day. Steve laughed along with the others when Rhodey shared embarrassing stories of Tony as Sam cooked everyone a meal. He kept laughing even at his own expense when Sam brought up some additional stories of the super soldier. Kept smiling as he saw the way the young girl’s eye lit up with the more embarrassing tales.
“Did I ever tell you that your Dad said ‘no’ the first time I asked him out?” the super soldier smiling when he felt his son chuckle.
“I go?” she asked standing up at that. The bubbles slowly slid down her tiny body as he glared at his brother – the same man currently grabbing a towel and doing his own victory dance.
Another wave of inner peace rolled over him, so incredibly thankful for his friends who made this so much easier on him.
“Yeah Steve this is Nanny’s house,” Becca added in a smug tone, reaching for a cookie and getting swatted away by their Pop. “Hey!”
Currently, the superhero was sitting on a bench watching his boyfriend and little brother race each other to the swings. His earlier skepticism was silenced by the adorable sight before him as he grabbed his phone to snap a few pics. Wade will make such a great dad one day. Not in the near future...but definitely in the not-too-distant future they'd adopt some or maybe hire a surrogate.
Thanks to his latest upgrades, the suit materialized around him and he was able to quickly catch up to the Panther's jet. As he flew alongside T'Challa's plane to help, they saw another explosion up ahead, propelling them to go faster. Steve was not far behind, informing them he had a suited up Peter with them and that the others were safe.
“Yeah of course,” Steve said, switching chairs to sit next to him and look. Tony quickly pulled his phone out and clicked on his boy’s photo album, hundreds of pictures of the chunky little mini-Tony and handing it over to Steve.
Universe was not on her side tonight…as the second-hand smoke did just what the doctor warned it would.
“You didn’t have to do this, Steve,” Tony said more seriously, stopping himself from actually eating one.
“I’m so proud of you, Tony. He’s perfect,” his Alpha said with a soft voice, gently wrapping his arms around the two and kissing the top of Tony’s head.
“Hey sweetheart!” he said before bringing her into a quick hug. She looked around at the crowd while he just focused on her.
” She turned to throw a wink at the brunette who was looking back at her in amazement before continuing.
“You’re a smart cookie, Stevie. Must be why you’re the one going to college.” Steve returned the hug with a fond eye roll of his own.
“Lay off your Papa, she doesn’t stay up to date on the cool hip lingo like I do,” George teased, getting a groan from his teenage sister.
He continued driving in silence, soaking in her words but knowing her well enough to know she wasn’t telling the entire truth. He waited until they pulled up in front of Susan’s house to confront her about it.
“It’s what it always is, Steve. My stupid insecurities getting the better of me,” Tony said as he laid back against their bed. Steve laid beside him, propped on his elbow as he rested his other hand on the man’s chest and waited for him to continue. “You know how I’m old, right? And you’re going to outlive me and...I don’t know maybe I want a say in who replaces me a-”
“Say, kiddo, Ruth should be dropping Peter off any minute…do you wanna go wait downstairs for him while I talk with Steve?” Tony asked, surprising Steve with the announcement. He thought Tony was going to pick Peter up tomorrow morning, smiling when he realized he must’ve asked Ruth to bring him tonight…so the four could hang out…as a
Waiting for them was the King himself surrounded by the Dora Mijale, while off to the side was the princess herself standing next to Queen Ramonda, Mother of Wakanda; who Emerson hadn't thought about until just this very second. Add it to the list of reasons she was going to be quiet this vacation. Her Pop led the family off the plane, followed closely by her Dad who was holding Miles' hand, while she and Peter brought up the rear.
They made it to the lab in record time, guard still up as they inspected the destroyed area. There was obviously an explosion, evident by the charred remains, as the super soldier tried to focus on the fact that she was definitely still alive.
Five weeks into their relationship and Steve couldn’t even describe the kind of happiness he felt whenever he saw, talked to, or even thought about Tony. He was the one who finally convinced him to try out for Captain, helping him study as Peter provided background music. His Uncle Rhodey apparently sent him a toy guitar that he was in fact rocking while Tony promised swift revenge on his longtime friend.
That wasn’t necessarily new, asking to bring someone over. Usually his friends wanted to come over to see the Tower and it’s not like Steve doesn’t have any extra art supplies lying around. He typed his reply.
Bucky blinked in shock, looking down and seeing a...yellow paint splotch on the fallen teen’s chest. The other two cried out in pain as they heard small
“Well, then you can get one when you move out too,” Steve said simply before opening his soda and taking a drink.
"Yeah, for the record, I would've happily gone to your class to show those little shits what's cool. Like actually winning the prizes without bribes." She smiled but remained silent.
“Renee?” Carolyn asked with a smile. Joey didn’t return the smile, but did nod in response. “Do you know where I got Renee from when I named your mother?”
"He's mine, alright? I get it. This is karma coming back to bite me," she said as Peter came back in holding the toddler's clothes.
“Huh I guess you’re right,” she said slowly placing her card on the top of the deck; a red seven. “Just not the way you thought, huh?” Her other two uncles erupted in congratulatory laughter as she won the game. They then turned their attention to a stunned Sam, teasing him for losing and not being the better ninja.
“I just did,” Tony said defensively. Steve’s chest rumbled with laughter, increasing when the sexy man on top of him joined in.
“Right, well I came here cause Jo left her medicine here and had a seizure. Thanks to you incompetent assholes.” The statement infuriated the other man, who literally puffed his chest and stepped directly in front of Steve.
The group of girls made a semi-circle around Joey, who instinctually opened her stance in case of an ambush.
“But…” Harley said, confusion on his face as he looked back up at Steve before realization dawned on his face. “You mean...you?”
“Let me go!” Leo screamed as he tried to break free. Peter stood firm even when the boy turned and started kicking and punching him in his attempt to run. The arachnid kept a hold on his wrist but otherwise let him get his anger out. “Let me go!” he screamed again, though Peter could hear his little voice beginning to break.
“Yeah, well. It’s not the cure for cancer but I think it’s pretty cool. Let’s go downstairs,” Tony said as he led the blonde down to some glass doors.
“She’s definitely your kid,” Steve said with a chuckle as he rested his hands and the camera on his hips at the sight. When she made it to Steve, she looked happy again to see him. She threw her tiny hands up at him, making grabby hands as she whined to be picked up.
“He raped me, Steve. Got me drunk enough so I couldn’t say no,” pausing to gage the man’s reaction. Steve felt anger growing in his chest but did his best to contain it. The laugh that Tony choked out next broke his heart.
Tony just kept that shit-eating grin on his face, wiggling his eyebrows as his friend groaned loudly before following him back inside. As they sat together on the couch, Tony found himself thinking about Joey and what she was doing today. He knew Steve had a 24 hour shift, so she must be bored out of her mind stuck at the apartment. He pulled his phone out to text Steve, not remembering if she was still in trouble or not.
“Darling, if you hadn’t been pacing like a madman you wouldn’t have gotten in sweet Pietro’s way,” Aunt Peggy unhelpfully said, looking down on him after he fell in front of her chair. Sarah was sitting next to her, also unhelpful as she just chuckled.
Which of course, Clint and James dominated. Each time Rumlow had to take a drink, Clint gave James a filthy kiss that only angered the already sloppy asshole, but got cheers from the crowd. He even covered his eyes while tossing the ball, letting out a ‘whoop’ at the familiar sound of splashing.
“Yeah, he did,” she said in between chuckles. He rolled his eyes fondly, reconsidering how sneaky he thought he was at hiding it the first thirty years.
He turned to his husband, smiling at seeing him with his arms crossed and looking so damn proud of their girl. Joey quickly released her captive before walking back over to her dads with an adorably shit-eating grin.
