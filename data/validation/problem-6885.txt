"It hasn't yet, Sir," JARVIS says, and although he knows it does them both a disservice, Tony can't help but picture his namesake, the man who read him bedtime stories and patched up grazed knees and taught Tony every goddamn thing he knows about right and wrong. Edwin Jarvis may have been the inspiration for JARVIS, and his death was definitely what left the black hole that started Tony down the path to creating his AIs, but the man had layers Tony couldn't hope to code and the AI has grown far beyond anything Tony could ever have dreamed of. They're separate entities, only the name and the accent and the insubordinate loyalty in common, and yet Tony can't imagine his JARVIS with any other face.
, and it's only now, as he listens to Tony try to sneak out of there without waking him, that he realises just how much it mattered to him.
“Ms Potts is currently on the phone with Sir,” JARVIS replies. “I have explained to her that he has retreated to his office and is refusing to leave, and I am reasonably certain that she will succeed in convincing him to do so.”
“Okay,” Tony says again, then takes a deep breath. “Did you ever see him around? After you, you know…”
to be the end of them. “Right, because Mr Can-Barely-Recognise-Human-Emotions is obviously the best judge of things like that.”
, offers Jim’s sleep-deprived brain. On the one hand, he listens without complaint until Tony’s said his fill about whatever’s put a bee in his bonnet, offers something along the lines of the same advice he always gives Tony (
, and if maybe he focuses slightly more on a particular part of himself, it’s only because it’s working extra hard to make his argument for him. “All the evidence would suggest so.”
But, because Sam knows just how black a hole self-recrimination can send him into, he pushes himself to look on the brighter side, which is actually pretty damn bright. For the first time since he got here, Barnes has expressed a preference for something, and that’s definitely something to be celebrated.
“Steve, Wilson,” Stark answers with a very wooden smile; at some point, Sam’s going to have to point out that since he’s likely to be living under the guy’s roof for a while, they should switch to first names, but this probably isn’t the right time for it.
"Hey," Tony says softly, the sheets rustling as he closes the distance Steve's just put between them, his chest against Steve's back, chin on his shoulder and knees a gentle pressure at Steve's hips. "It's- Well, no, it's not okay, but…"
Tony waves away the apology with the hand holding the water bottle. “It’s fine, Steve,” he says, handing over first the towel and then, once Steve has patted himself slightly dryer, the bottle; Tony waits for him to drink his fill before adding, “Do you want to talk about it?”
Barnes nods, having heard pretty much precisely what he was expecting to. “So, if I turn and Stark has to kill me, you’ll show this to Steve so he knows what I said, yeah? Hell, if I turn and Stark doesn’t put me down, show Steve. Make sure he knows Stark put his relationship above saving innocent lives.”
Peggy smiles a little vaguely, patting his hand again, the anger of a few moments ago forgotten like so many other things. "You're a good boy, Tony," she says as he stands up.
He’s already on tiptoes by the end of it, and Steve is leaning in, and in, breathing in Tony’s declaration like it’s all he needs to live, and oh.
Though, actually, Clint's pretty sure she's disguised herself as homeless a time or two in order to keep an eye on somewhere, so it's not like she has a leg to stand on. Or would have, if she were here. Which she isn't.
“Look,” Clint says softly, fingers scratching at the label on his beer. “At some point Steve or Sam or whoever is going to want you talk to a therapist. If you’re anything like the rest of us, you won’t want to do it, but… Something happened to me, a couple years back. Not as bad as what you and Nat  went through, but this guy got into my head, made me do some shit I never would have done if I’d had a choice. Fucked me up pretty badly for a while, and I was a stubborn bastard about it, refused to listen whenever anyone told me to get help.”
Rather than restarting the elevator, JARVIS apparently decides the appropriate response is to open the doors onto the team's floor. "Doctor Banner and Agent Barton have expressed concern for your wellbeing, Sir," JARVIS says. "I believe they would find your presence at dinner reassuring."
Steve will make himself a literal obstacle, when someone finds the Soldier, and, sometimes, Tony doesn't think that'll be enough to stop him.
A moment of silence follows Bruce's mildly alarming (and, Tony thinks, most likely accurate) statement, before Clint says, "Really hoping that's a
It sounds like a dismissal, so Tony just says a slightly too emphatic, "Thank you, Natasha," and expects that to be it.
"Tony's in the shop, right, JARVIS?" he asks, swaying his way back inside and summoning the elevator. "Any chance you'll let me in so I can apologise?"
Unsurprisingly, FHD doesn't answer. Clint looks up to see if he's nodding or shaking his head or something, but his mysterious rescuer has vanished. He stands up and moves down the hallway to the door at the other end, looking up and down the street outside for any sign of the man. He's gone, though, disappearing so completely he might as well never have been there.
“I wasn't expecting to see you here,” Tony says, supremely intelligent, as he looks up to confirm his ears aren’t deceiving him. “Figured you’d still be marvelling over the miracle that is Barnes.”
"No," Steve answers. It's not entirely a lie, because Tony didn't text him, and if Steve says anything about the note Sam will just tell him to call, hear Tony out. Worse, Sam'll sound so reasonable and logical about it that Steve will think it's a good idea. He'll call, and Tony will make a joke of it, tell Steve that it was fun, sure, but that it would be better if they didn't do it again. It would be better if Steve stayed away, for good this time.
tattoo on his forehead, that way we wouldn't even have to draw straws over whose turn it is to collect him, just wait until some well-meaning citizen dumps him on our doorstep."
Steve had asked, earning himself maybe ten seconds of silence, just long enough for him to distract Tony into another round of injury-checking).
,” he stutters, shakily returning her smile and putting what looks like an awful lot of effort into meeting her eyes. He’s clearly too embarrassed at being caught staring to make conversation as he scans her purchases, and in less than a minute Nathalie has her shopping bagged up and her wallet out ready to pay.
He's sceptical at best about what they're going to find when they get back to New York, even as Steve seems about ready to boil over with anticipation, the poor sap too consumed with excitement at seeing his friend again and epic angst over his relationship with Stark to have any sense of self-preservation (though Sam has not as yet seen any evidence to suggest Steve actually understands the concept).
in comparison to what they did over the years it took to turn Bucky Barnes into Hydra's prized assassin.
Problem is, there aren't a whole lot of people left who knew him, and Tony has enough difficulty trusting the word of people he knows, let alone a complete stranger.
Tony makes a concentrated effort not to stare at him, instead opting to pour himself a coffee, then another for Thor, since he’ll be there any minute, and a third for Barnes, who’ll either drink it or won’t but there’s no point offering first because, based on what Tony’s seen of his interactions with the others, he’s unlikely to give an answer either way.
"He thinks JARVIS is sending them," Pepper explains tiredly. "Please, Tony. I understand that you're doing the reclusive thing right now, but the company needs you-"
He waits a moment for JARVIS to answer, then hangs up, jostling Steve's arm until Steve manages to jerk himself out of his stunned stupor.
“Wine?” Steve offers. “Or soda, I don’t know if you want to drink-drink, or…” He stops, swallowing audibly, and takes a deep breath before starting his question over again. “Would you like a drink, Tony?”
He travels a slow path up Steve’s neck, along his jaw, expecting every second to be the one where Steve tells him to stop, remembers that he doesn’t actually want this, whatever the flush on his cheeks and the hitch in his breathing and his hands slipping under the fabric of Tony’s tee-shirt might suggest.
Again, Barnes shrugs, unsure how much of her past Natalia has shared with the Avengers: they could know that he shot her, years ago as well as more recently; maybe they know he trained her, even further back than that; there’s a chance they know neither, and an even slimmer chance they know both. He should have done better by Natalia decades ago, but it’s too late for him to fix that and the only way he can think of to make it up to her is making sure he doesn’t go spilling her beans all over the place.
"I have had a very long, very difficult day, and you do not want to play games with me, JARVIS." Tony pauses to take a breath and a healthy swig of his drink. "You know exactly what this is about."
His cell has three identical doors. The first leads to a closet full of clothes in his size, comfortable and light, all loose enough to allow for easy movement without there being any excess fabric that might get in the way during a fight. That aside, they're all civilian clothes, lacking a sensible amount of padding or protection, and the asset wears his armour underneath.
And, God, he deserves a drink. He deserves the biggest drink he's ever had, deserves to be completely and utterly off his face. He should be as shit-faced as he was the day they put his parents in the ground, too drunk to stand up, to remember his own awful, bloodstained name.
Well. He knew they existed, but it was very definitely in a hypothetical way. Sure, he was aware there are people out there who could blow a few thousand dollars on a hotel room for the night, the same way he was aware there are people who take drinks out of hotel minibars rather than using them to store their own stuff. Those people existed, but Sam was never going to meet one of them, let alone have one offer to pay his bills.
Tony's visited Peggy here enough times that he doesn't need showing to the sunroom. Surprisingly, it's actually an accurate name; the room is light and airy, pleasantly warm, and the scent of impending death that always suffuses places like this is almost unnoticeable. Peggy doesn't spend a lot of time in there, but the fact that she's out of her room suggests she's having a good day, hopefully better than she has the last few times Tony has visited her.
“Yeah, well, it’s how Tony does them,” Steve says, more heated than he intended. He makes himself take a breath, then starts over. “It’s not exactly what I hoped for, but it is what it is. I tried to ask him if he wanted to go steady, back when we started out, and he shut me down before I could even get the question out. He wanted to be
Steve should be sleeping, resting, making sure he’s in the best possible state he can be, so that he can be as calm and rational as Bucky needs him to be. He needs to be with it enough not to crowd Bucky the second he sees him, has to be able to read Bucky well enough that he doesn’t make things worse for him.
. The asset doesn’t like to be touched, but he also knows that refusing is rude, and while he’s spent a lot of time being unconcerned by other people thinking he’s rude, he thinks Steve would be unhappy about it.
Tony spends a fair few minutes lying there before the need for caffeine wins out, at which point he rolls out of bed, pulling on yesterday’s jeans and the first clean tee-shirt he comes across.
For the first time since he escaped, the asset has been able to rest without fear that Hydra will come for him the second he closes his eyes, and he’s not ready to give that up yet.
“Okay,” Tony says, after a moment of that. “So, don’t think I’m not pleased to see you, because I absolutely am, but it’s been long enough that I’m entitled to ask. What brings you by, Thor?”
Or he would, if he had any idea what kind of help Steve wanted from him, what it is that has Steve tilting his head, the start of a frown crinkling his forehead.
This is Tony he's talking to, so Jim’s fully expecting the answer to be a firm no – best case scenario, he picks up his story from where he left off, but it's far more likely that he'll start over so that he can be sure Jim’s heard absolutely all of it. He's surprised, then, when Tony thinks for a few seconds before answering.
As far as Tony’s aware, it’s the first time Barnes has been outside of Steve’s floor alone. After the first few weeks where Barnes never left made a move to leave Steve’s floor, he’s seemed happy (or at least willing) to follow Steve, Sam or Natasha when they’re out and about within the Tower, and according to JARVIS Barnes and Clint have been spending a fair amount of time together in the evenings, sometimes with Natasha as well, and Tony has no interest at all in interrupting their little Assassins Anonymous gatherings.
Steve shrugs, picking at a slice of dry toast (possibly why his food got a concerned look from Sam, since Steve doesn't seem to have picked up anything to actually put on his toast). He doesn't overly want to tell Sam, even in the fairly vague way he's been talking about his relationship with Tony; he knows Sam is asking out of concern, and Steve loves him for it, but that doesn't mean he wants to talk about what happened last night/this morning.
part of her question and get right to the part that isn’t a request. “Sure. You gonna tell me where they are, or do I have to guess?”
Maybe if it was just his friendship with Steve, it wouldn't be an issue. In the course of his lifetime, Tony has screwed up more friendships than he can count, and, sure, Steve's a great guy and being friends with him is a hell of a lot easier than the antagonism they had going on in the beginning, but if they quit being buddies Tony can live with it.
"On a number of occasions, I have sent Captain Rogers what I had deemed probable locations for Sergeant Barnes," JARVIS confesses.
the point), and landed Steve in the hospital with injuries that would have killed a regular person three times over. Sam has every right to hate him, and his willingness to pretend for Steve’s sake that the Winter Soldier isn't beyond saving in no way impacts upon Sam’s ability to loathe him in secret.
“Indeed, Sergeant Barnes,” answers the ceiling. “I have a dedicated server containing all footage since cameras were installed. Excluding any areas that may reasonably considered private, that is.”
“So, hey,” he starts, reaching for a second doughnut. “You remember that time you all fucked off to Spain and left me tied up in a basement somewhere?”
It's Tony's turn to feel sad, so horribly, horrendously sad for Peggy, both the woman she is now and the fantastic, fearless woman she was for the rest of her life.
"Just to check, that's an offer and not a threat, right?" He's pretty sure, but it'll hurt less to check than it will to get shot, and Clint's three cracked ribs are already painful enough.
"We had an argument," he says, which is both accurate and vastly lacking information. The same is true of his next sentence, too. "I didn't want to talk to him about it."
“Um,” Tony says, still not entirely sure what’s going on; he’s both dumped and been dumped a lot, but not once has the dumping been preceded by a home-cooked meal. Even when it was Pepper, they went for the
Bucky shrugs off the apology. “Forgiven,” he answers lightly. “For that, anyway. Course, it’s not really me you should be apologising to, is it?”
“Oh,” Steve says a third time, stepping forward until he’s as close as they were before, Tony’s thighs either side of his hips, Tony’s hands holding on to Steve’s. “That’s okay, then.”
“Couch,” Tony says into their kiss, not wanting to move apart even for that long, so it comes out garbled and incoherent. That doesn’t actually seem to matter, because Steve is turning them around and lowering Tony to the closest worktable, and okay, fine, this is every bit as good, zero complaints for Tony on this one.
Tony, on the other hand, is well on his way to having a problem so, really, Clint helping himself to one of the unopened bottles of scotch in the elevator is basically his good deed for the day. He's not going to drink all of it, but a couple of glasses after an argument like that isn't an inappropriate response.
“I promise,” Steve is saying when Tony arrives, and since there’s no one else in the room, it’s pretty clear who he’s talking to.
Clint revises the count of concealed weapons up to eight, since he's got no idea at all where the second gun came from.
"Two outings in one day, JARVIS?" she asks; in the days when Tony spent more time out of the house than in it, this wouldn't be at all unexpected, but given how reclusive he's been of late, Pepper is a little surprised. Still, if JARVIS says Tony's on his way out again, he probably is, and Pepper isn't going to miss him because she's waiting for an explanation rather than taking the elevator up to the roof.
Eventually, he settles for sending a copy of the blueprint for the arm, subject line left empty, no message to explain it.
“This’ll do it,” Tony says, closing his designs and pulling the plate towards him and digging in. He’s not eaten since JARVIS told him he found the Soldier, hasn’t a home cooked meal in quite a lot longer (it’s Bruce’s turn to procure food this week, and he says he doesn’t have the patience for cooking; Tony’s pretty sure it’s just an excuse to get out of it, but not quite sure enough to say anything), and it gives him something to do with his mouth and hands that isn’t talking or touching Steve. “Come on, you know I don’t do thank yous, Steve. We’ve talked about this before.”
The asset is trying very hard not to make Steve unhappy, and the fact that he’s failing so far means that he has to make extra effort not to make a bad impression on another one of Steve’s friends.
He's not sure how long he's been dozing when Tony begins to stir, the sheets whispering against his skin as he stretches. He lets out a sleepy little murmur, and Steve is only a second away from rolling onto his side and pressing a kiss to the back of his neck when Tony curses under his breath. "
Maybe Barnes is going to answer, in that very delayed fashion with which he still approaches most conversations, but if so he doesn’t get the opportunity; apparently JARVIS decides he’s distracted Thor for long enough, and Tony only just has enough time to put his mug down and step into the middle of the room before Thor is there in front of him.
Eventually, Tony winds up his story on Thor's latest cultural misunderstanding and pauses briefly to catch his breath, only for Peggy to interrupt him.
Barnes turns his hand under hers, putting them palm to palm, and closes his scarred, awful, murderer’s fingers around her dainty ones. “I’m sorry, Natalia,” he says, the words only a little more than a whisper, knowing as he does so that this isn’t something he can make better by apologising.
“Indeed,” Thor agrees readily, because Tony just isn’t that lucky. “However, I was speaking of your romantic relationship. I assumed you would still be enjoying your honeymoon, and therefore uninclined to spend time apart.”
Still, he’s also not known for his patience, and Tony is fidgeting more than a little bit by the time Barnes finally answers.
"The Winter Soldier," Clint says, not entirely a question, though Tony answers anyway, particularly since Clint sees fit to surrender his beer.
"Whoa," Clint answers, hands raised in surrender, or maybe like he's trying to distance himself from Tony's suggestion, though it's much too late for either option to make things any better. "Come on, you know that's
It's already light out when Tony opens his eyes, and once the easy warmth of waking up next to Steve fades, panic sets in. Not about Steve, definitely not that, and if it was up to him, he'd happily have stayed there a very, very long time, maybe even see if he could talk Steve into spending a few days in the city with him rather than racing off after Barnes right away.
It studies its reflection in a mirror until it can be certain it knows itself well enough to recognise if its face appears in news bulletins or on wanted posters. It lays false trails and avoids surveillance, doesn't stay anywhere more than a week, travels in the back of trucks, choosing its next vehicle and therefore next destination entirely at random. It sleeps under bridges and in storm drains, applying skills previously used to lift ID badges and plant evidence to stealing food from dumpsters. Sometimes it doubles back, on foot if it can't find a vehicle travelling in the correct direction.
Barnes bares his teeth, as bad an imitation of a smile as Stark’s was. “You'll like this one,” he says, making it sound light, normal, as far as possible from the almost-desperation he feels. “If they get me back, you gotta promise that you'll put me down.”
That’s also something noteworthy, Sam thinks; as far as he knows, Barnes has only been willing to eat and drink stuff Steve has given him, and he always waits for Steve to eat first if Sam’s done the cooking, so accepting something from a stranger is both unusual and a definite positive.
“Of course,” the voice agrees, and the asset feels the elevator begin to move, the ascent swift and smooth.
Tony inhales his coffee, splutters slightly, and tries (and most likely fails) to keep his glance in Barnes’ direction a surreptitious one. “Why would Steve object?”
!" Clint announces, loud enough that FHD flinches, but he's too occupied with picking up the shards of his almost new bow and muttering curses to apologise. He's going to have to ask Tony for a new one, which usually results in having to listen to him bitch about how he doesn't build them fancy, expensive equipment just for them to smash them to pieces at the earliest opportunity (not that any of them take him at all seriously, because everyone knows building new and better stuff is one of Tony's favourite things to do), but since all that shit went down between him and Steve, Tony hasn't been the same.
"Thanks," Bruce says, spending another few moments pondering his next words, then decides he might as well just go for it. "I'd never ask you to tell me anything Tony's specifically told you not to, but if I was to talk to him about someone, you wouldn't let me make a fool of myself by mentioning the wrong person, would you?"
"Speaking of new things, there's a present for you on the jet, Falcon," Tony says, because the alternative is just standing there gawping at Steve and that's where he draws the line. "What d'you say, want to earn your codename back?"
, okay; he's not actually going to shoot anyone, but it's reassuring to know that he can, if the occasion calls for it) before he feels calm enough to let himself think back over the conversation with Tony.
"That's that, then," Pepper says. "Maybe we'll get lucky, and he'll decide to pull his head out of his ass all on his own."
was an all-encompassing statement about Bucky’s well-being or if it just means that Bucky and Tony didn’t injure one another.
"Tomorrow," Pepper concludes, stepping onto the jet's ramp before Tony can hit the controls to close it. "The company needs you here, tomorrow, at 8am."
"This is Sam," Sam says, his hand on Steve's shoulder. "I don't know what you just said to Steve, but- He did? And no one's hurt, right? Uh-huh. Yeah. Thanks, JARVIS. Yeah, we'll see you later. Tell Stark we said thanks, yeah?"
“Widow, Hawkeye and Falcon are too fragile to go up against the Soldier, Thor spends half his time on another planet and the Hulk isn’t exactly good at following orders. That leaves you and Steve, and I know who it’ll hurt less. You care about him as much as I think you do, you won’t put him in that position.”
. She tried to force Sam in on it, too, but apparently he’s just as fearless as Steve is, since all he does is shake his head and leave the room, despite Natalia’s smile, leaving just the two of them to compete.
Natasha takes over when it’s time to actually start cooking, and within a few minutes there are several bowls of fruit and a large pile of waffles in the centre of the table.
It's a bit of a surprise when the only people who answer Clint's distress call are Hill's minions. Not that he's complaining, because the Hill-clones are scary efficient (in addition to being practically indistinguishable from one another) and Clint's out of there barely twenty minutes after they rock up, but it might be nice for his teammates to express maybe a little bit of concern for him.
“I believe so,” JARVIS answers just as quickly. “Sergeant Wilson, would you be willing to visit the communal floor for the time being? I can confirm that there is coffee there, and that Agent Barton is in the process of making breakfast.”
"JARVIS, I need a line to the team," she requests, her computer pinging steadily as more photos are uploaded. "Avengers priority override 36482, I don't want any of them sending me to voicemail."
Nathalie pops her gum again, loud enough that he jolts to attention. The poor boy blushes horribly, and Nathalie smiles to show she’s not offended.
– but it's enough that Clint stops talking shit about Tony's parents. He shakes his head, then closes his eyes as he takes a deep breath.
“Bucky,” Steve breathes, apparently choosing this moment to pull himself together. “God, Buck, it’s good to see you.”
“Oh,” Tony answers, and the way he squeezes Steve’s hand is every bit as involuntary as his smile was. “Oh. Dinner?”
"Oh, hell, yes," Wilson answers, practically ploughing through Tony and Bruce on his way into the jet, where it seems to occur to him that he doesn't actually know what he's looking for or where he might find it.
"Pretty sure he'll say no," Tony answers, more of his mind on overtaking an old guy doing ten under the speed limit than on what he's saying or how Steve might hear it.
"Look," he says, faking calmness as best he can. "It was what it was, and then he told me his ex killed my parents and we broke it off so Steve could search for him. It doesn't matter who suggested it, because the whole thing's moot anyway."
“Sit,” she tells Bucky, waiting for him to obey before fixing two cups of coffee and joining him at the table. “Steve, do you want to sort out plates?”
He's not at all expecting it when FHD holds out the gun in his left hand, tilting it in Clint's direction when he doesn't immediately take it.
"It would seem Agent Barton is doing precisely that," JARVIS replies as Bruce shrugs. "I believe it's an expression of concern, Sir."
, says the part of Steve's brain still capable of calm, rational thought. The list of things unresolved between them is a long one – how Tony's dealing with his parents' deaths and Bucky's part in them; Howard's possible involvement in the Winter Soldier project; why Tony decided now was the time to answer Steve's call; what it is they're doing together and whether Tony wants them to be more as much as Steve does – and they shouldn't be falling into bed together without at least acknowledging them.
Sam gives him a steady, stern look. "Hey, man, I'm not gonna force you to talk if you don't want to," he answers. "Just remember, I'm around if you change your mind."
It's a bird, Steve realises after the fourteenth picture; an artist, Sam is not, but he is apparently very determined to get his point across.
“No, Yasha,” she says. “I remember many dancing instructors, but only one who was ever kind to us. You had just as little in the way of freedom as the rest of us did, and you still treated us better than anyone who chose to be there. You have
"I wouldn't presume to tell you what you should or should not care about, Sir," JARVIS says – lies, really, since he usually has a great many opinions on what Tony should care about. "I merely thought you should be aware of its existence."
Unfortunately, it seems Tony only left the workshop very early in the morning for an impromptu trip to visit Peggy in DC, so Pepper has spent close to half her workday waiting for JARVIS to let her know Tony's back.
It’s a nice enough day out, crisp and clear, not a cloud in sight. It’ll heat up later on, no doubt of that, but for now it’s the perfect temperature for running, and between that and the fact that he hasn’t once been overtaken by a ‘roided up golden retriever, Sam is in an excellent mood by the time he jogs back into the Tower.
. She wasn't a scientist or a spy, and there's no way she could have been a threat to Hydra. She was a- a fucking
“You've got Bruce and Sam,” Natasha answers, in English now that she’s out of the store and far enough away from any other pedestrians not to be overheard. “You don't need me.”
He's interrupted by Bruce clearing his throat, his demeanour more than a little uncomfortable. "I don't need details, Tony," he says.
“Oh,” Natasha thinks again, this time aloud. “It’s okay. He can call me that.” She pauses, trying to reign in the childish sentimentality she should definitely be above feeling. “Give me a couple of days, I’ll find a flight home.”
Her tablet pings, and Maria glances down at it, her heart sinking as she reads the alert. "Three confirmed injuries," she amends, "And one unconfirmed abduction-by-spider. Any questions?"
"Understood, Sir," JARVIS says again, before lapsing into a very sullen silence. Or just silence, really, but Tony knows it's not a nice friendly one.
"It's all yours," Tony says as the box clicks open, then proceeds to give a quick rundown of the shiny new features he's added to the primitive tech Wilson is used to: the controls for the Redwing drone; the goggles with built in HUD, a much simplified version of that in Tony and Rhodey's suits; the basics of the flight controls. Wilson's grin gets bigger the longer Tony talks, his eyes boggling, and Tony's not actually sure how much he's actually absorbed by the time he finishes up the explanation with, "Anyway, it's all super-intuitive, so I'm sure you'll pick the rest up as you go."
“No,” Jim answers, because brutal honesty is often the only way to get through to Tony. “It's three in the morning, Tony.”
"He was a soldier," she says, which isn't really an answer to his question (though it's certainly a more apt response than she knows). "I think we all did things we would rather not have done back then, but, to my knowledge, Bucky never did anything he didn't have to. Does that help?"
He sees the Winter Soldier when he closes his eyes, his imagination filling in details that the black and white CCTV footage doesn't. Tony has managed to zoom in and use lip reading software to decipher Howard's last words, but his mind plays them loud and live in Howard's voice, followed by the crunch of his skull on the steering wheel. He sees the Soldier's hands around Maria's throat, around
brings to mind flashes of Steve, small and complaining, and of music, loud and enthusiastic. Men and women in crowded halls, stepping and spinning, laughing and happy.
“Dude, you totally saved my life,” the archer continues, thrusting his hand in the asset’s direction. “Clint, Clint Barton, it’s good to meet you for real.”
"Okay," Tony says. "Clearly you're determined to play stupid, so I'll spell it out for you. You've been sending locations to Steve."
Half an hour later, Tony’s comparing a 3D hologram representation of Howard’s blueprints-of-evil to the scans he had JARVIS make of Barnes’ arm. Even J can only do so much when most of the arm is covered by clothes Tony fully intends to have incinerated (assuming Barnes ever decides to part with them) but if he’s going to repair the piece of shit Barnes has now, he needs to know what he’s working with.
"Sir is currently uninjured," JARVIS tells him, thankfully answering Steve's questions in order of urgency rather than asking. "He has not slept in thirty-seven hours or eaten in sixteen, and I estimate his current blood alcohol content to be around 0.06%." He pauses a moment to let Steve convert these statistics from average person to Tony Stark (answer: not ideal, but not so bad that Tony might have had JARVIS call him as the result of either sleep deprivation or intoxication, and definitely not enough to trip any of JARVIS' safety protocols – whatever this call is about, Tony's sober and stable enough to have had JARVIS make it intentionally) and continues with, "Sir has asked me to pass on a message to you."
"Tony," Bruce says, sounding stupidly kind (did he miss the part where Tony said his parents were basically saints compared to Bruce's or Clint's or even freaking Odin, for God's sake, he's not the one that needs kindness) and even more cautious. "Tony, you get that not hitting your kid isn't even the bare minimum of what it takes to be an acceptable parent, right?"
But Steve just smiles at the pair of them, nothing but happiness on his face, and asks Natalia if she wants to stay for breakfast.
The mood Steve seems to be in, it’s probably best not to sneak up on him, so Tony collects a clean towel and a chilled bottle of water before sidling his way around the room, edging into Steve’s field of vision rather than approaching him from behind.
For a moment, Tony tries to picture that. Wilson isn't a big guy, not compared to Steve or Thor, but he'd still need to be curled up like a hedgehog to sleep in the back of the car Tony saw earlier, and then Steve somehow has to get in there as well, like he can even sit up there without smashing his head on the roof. "Well, that's not happening."
Steve hesitates, giving Barnes one last look before deciding to make what Barnes thinks is probably his first ever tactical retreat. “Fine, we’ll go,” he says, speaking for both of them like he’s somehow missed the fact that Sam is already edging his way into the elevator. “Let JARVIS know if you need anything, okay, Bucky?”
convince him, not when Tony spends half his time determined to deny that he has feelings about anything. Emotional openness isn't entirely Steve's strong suit, either, but since Sam took it upon himself to vandalise all of Steve's misery doodles, he has been trying, and he'll keep trying, if that's what Tony needs from him.
It is the very best kind of surprise when he stumbles back onto their floor to find Bucky and Nat sat on the couch together. She’s resting on his shoulder, eyes closed, while Bucky’s head is leaning against hers, both of them looking relaxed and soft, younger, and Steve’s fingers itch for a pencil so that he can make a record of this moment, have something to fall back on for those moments when Bucky seems like he’ll never be at peace again.
“And I'm tired, Tony,” he says, even though he's more or less resigned himself to hearing Tony out. “Is there any chance at all of you sticking to the cliff notes version of whatever this is?”
Tony follows him off the bed, reaching out again, a step forward to match each step Steve takes away from him. "I can, though," he answers, his voice the kind of glib it always is when he's trying to make something important seem insignificant. "I can one hundred percent guarantee the team will do anything and everything they can. Anything."
“Oh,” Tony says, for what has to be about the fiftieth time this conversation. “Yeah, I’d like that.”
“Then you sack it up and deal with it, punk,” says Bucky, his Bucky, jostling Steve with his elbow before, sort of cautiously, putting his arm around Steve’s shoulder. “You’ve knocked out Hitler over two hundred times, and it ain’t like you’ve never been rejected either. You ain’t gonna know unless you try.”
"The Lion King," Steve says halfheartedly – Tony seems so pleased when Steve actually knows where his jokes are coming from, and since what he's about to say is probably going to drive a very large wedge between them, he's going to do what he can to make Tony smile one more time – before carrying on. "It's about the Winter Soldier, Tony."
He shifts away from Tony and rolls until he's facing the other way before sitting up, his feet on the floor, elbows on his thighs and head in his hands. "The things they did," he repeats, his heart in his throat, voice almost nonexistent. "The things they made him do."
Despite the fact that the former brainwashed assassin in the room has picked up on Tony’s attempts to divert the conversation away from him and Steve (he’s not worked out why, Tony doesn’t think, but he’s definitely realised it’s happening), Thor seems to be completely oblivious. It’s not exactly surprising, since the concept of keeping things quiet seems to pass Thor by a lot of the time, but Tony really would like it if Thor would notice the very obvious
Again, he doesn’t think Steve’s going to accept, and if he actually thought Steve might be in the right frame of mind to have sex Tony wouldn’t have phrased it like that, but the flippancy does get a little laugh out of Steve.
Steve’s smile is smaller this time, more cautious, but Tony feels his own face answer it, quite without intending you to.
Clint takes the elevator up to the roof, then walks out onto the overhang, sitting down and leaning his arms on the railing with his legs hanging over the edge. It's quiet, as much as the city is ever quiet, and there's no one around to get twitchy about him falling (they try to hide it, but Clint knows the only member of the team who doesn't have a problem with him sitting there is the one with a tendency to forget falls of that distance are fatal to the average Midgardian), so Clint does his best to relax.
The coordinates Steve gave Bruce lead them to a parking lot in an industrial complex a few miles outside of Barcelona. It's getting on for nine pm local time, and the place is deserted apart from Steve, Wilson, and an old Peugeot that looks to be too small to fit the both of them and too beat up to be road legal.
"Hey," Clint manages, after they've both spent far too many seconds fidgeting uncomfortably. It's just like ripping a bandaid off, he tells himself, and blurts out his next sentence before he can overthink it enough that he runs and hides. "So, I shouldn't have said that shit about your parents and I'm sorry."
If he had physical form, Tony is quite sure JARVIS would be smiling at him. As it is, JARVIS has made it quite clear he has no interest in any form other than that which he currently holds, so Tony has to settle for imagining it.
that wants to come out, because even if it's JARVIS and he almost certainly already knows how much Tony cares about this, he prefers to keep his emotional stupidity to himself. And he knows it
. Counsellor or not, Sam really doesn't think he's capable of handling a fraction of Steve's issues, but since Natasha has vanished into the ether in a somewhat ironic effort to find herself and the
“So, hey,” he says, tone deliberately light, even if his position between Barnes and Thor means he currently feels anything but light. “Thor, this is Steve’s friend Bucky Barnes. Barnes, this is Thor.”
Sam peels himself away from Steve’s back, then pokes him in the ribs until he moves aside far enough to let Sam see something other than his far too broad shoulders. Namely, he sees Tony Stark, standing behind the bar, resting on his elbows in a way that Sam suspects is intended to look casual but in reality seems anything but.
quiet, and for so long that Tony looks away from his empty mug and half-eaten slice of cake and at his friend. This is clearly what Bruce has been waiting for, because he sort of
“You wouldn’t,” Steve answers, even though he’s about ninety-eight percent sure Bucky’s joking (and, Jesus, Bucky’s joking again. Steve would have given him the opportunity to yell at him weeks ago, if he’d know that was what it would take).
“I’ll take something down to Tony in a bit, if you could leave one of each,” Bruce answers, while Clint grabs for the doughnut box, quite clearly not done with them; it’s not a fight Sam is interested in having (
No, Steve definitely isn’t asking permission. He just doesn’t want to come home to find his friend bleeding.
She shifts closer, and then closer still, leaning against Barnes’ side and resting her head on his shoulder. It’s the longest someone has touched him without intending to cause suffering in more time than Barnes can remember, and while he doesn’t feel entirely comfortable with it, he also doesn’t
“Hey, don’t let me interrupt,” Tony says, making a beeline straight for the coffee maker without looking at any of them. He’s obviously trying very hard to sound light, but it’s only sort of successful, and even that is belied by the fact that his shoulders are rigid with tension, spine just about straight enough to use as a ruler. “I mean, I’m a little offended you’re all apparently having a breakfast party in my own home without inviting me, but, hey, I’m the only one of you who works for a living, maybe you just thought I was too busy to join you. Which, yeah, I am today, absolutely too busy, but it would have been nice to be asked, you know?”
explain, stepping back until Tony has to choose between unlocking his legs from around his waist and falling off the workbench.
system. If Tony wants to turn an instruction into an order, he can, and JARVIS won't have any choice in the matter.
“Tony Stark!” he booms, hauling Tony into the kind of hug that makes bears look puny. “It is good to see you, my friend.”
"Fine!" he announces, flinging yet another shitty virtual blueprint into the virtual trashcan, because three hours have passed since he closed the CCTV footage of his parents' murder and set to working on the tweaks Pepper is demanding he makes to the new StarkPad and he's still only managed to recreate the same problem over and over. "Where is the fucking thing, J?"
Okay, so, if you've made it this far, I want to say thank you again for reading. If you enjoyed either the fic or the art, please drop us a line letting us know.
“You too, buddy,” Tony answers, returning Thor’s rib-cracking thumps on the back with ones that are far less powerful, though not for lack of trying. “Don’t suppose you could put me down, could you?” he asks after a moment.
"You're welcome, Nephew Tony," she answers, their old inside joke, dating back to when Jarvis first suggested to a five year old Tony that he should call her that. "It was good to see you."
The others are silent, long enough for it to occur to Tony that Steve might not have told anyone other than him (or him, Wilson and Natasha, anyway, not that he had much choice about them finding out) who the Soldier used to be. Which is stupid, because he can't think of any reason for Steve not to have told the rest of the team, other than the fact that he's an idiot who plays things too close to the chest rather than actually asking for help when he needs it (like that statement doesn't describe the whole damn lot of them, Tony included).
He hesitates, so long that Tony fights off enough of his embarrassment that he can look up at him; Bruce looks uncertain, a little uneasy, but he continues once Tony's made eye contact. "But I do know a little about how it feels to have hurt people when you aren't in control of your own actions, and Clint knows even more about that."
Yeah. Tony’s proven to himself that he can be in the same room as Barnes without having a freakout, even if he wasn’t there all that long. Next step, catch Barnes when Steve is elsewhere, so that he can ask about the Howard situation.
matter: Steve can’t imagine anything he wouldn’t do for Bucky, and it makes no difference if he’s doing it as Bucky’s best friend or as that weird stranger who won’t stop hanging around (but,
Since Steve's of the opinion that his words were pretty much self-explanatory, he doesn't both repeating them.
to be called that anymore. The people who called him that were cruel, and the asset is indescribably pleased to be away from them. The asset was their tool, taken out of the box when they had a use for it and, if it was lucky, put away as soon as it had served its purpose. It wasn't a human being, not to Hydra and not to itself.
He shudders theatrically, although Steve entirely understands the sentiment; interrogations from Natasha are definitely not something to be sniffed at.
Steve’s shaking his head, pacing back and forth, never coming closer or moving further away from Tony. “This is different, though,” he argues, though it’s far and away the least argumentative argument the two of them have ever had. “You have to understand that. This… It’s not just magnets for my shield or a new uniform, Tony. This is
, a guess further supported by Steve's forcibly calm, "Whoa, pal, maybe don't swing that quite so hard."
Her phone rings as the kid is counting out her change, and she answers without looking to see who is calling. “
"Okay," Bruce says, standing up and approaching Tony's primary worktable. "Talk over. Do you want to tell me what you're working on?"
"I missed you too, Steve," he murmurs, gaze intent, focused. His hands are planted on Steve's shoulders, his body a warm weight everywhere they're touching, and Steve finds his own gaze drawn to Tony's mouth, his hands itching with the need to crush Tony to him.
Tony's got progressively more jittery on the way over, to the point where Bruce keeps shooting him little
"Barnes," she says, like she's testing it out, trying to work out why it's familiar, and then, smiling, "You know, I'd quite forgotten how many of Steve's friends were called James back then. Yes, I knew Bucky."
is not the word Tony would use, based on this story, and he says as much when Peggy falls silent. "I mean," he explains, "It kind of sounds like he was trying to snake you away from Steve."
"Oh, yeah," Barton says. "Nat said she was going dark for a couple of weeks. I can get a hold of her, but it probably won't be same-day."
“Okay,” Steve agrees. “Coffee it is, and maybe we can talk about telling people about us, if you were- If you wanted to.”
Tony thinks about it, long enough to empty and refill his glass twice. His first instinct is to say yes, because Tony is a spiteful, selfish drunkard, and still fantastically pissed off at Steve for choosing his murderous blast from the past over him. He doesn't want to help Steve on his vendetta, even if it's a vendetta against neo-nazis whose wannabe Death Star was targeting Tony and Bruce and millions of other people. He doesn't want his non-offspring using an order from ages ago to justify doing something Tony
, Steve thinks. When Sam comes back, they'll talk, and Steve will try to be honest and unevasive. Until then, Steve's probably got enough time to show Sam what a drawing of a bird is
"I'm gonna take a walk," he says in what seems to Tony (himself a master of feigned neutrality, at least most of the time) to be forced calm. "Cool off."
“Barnes does,” he says, which was not what she was expecting. “I get maybe a fraction of what the two of you have been through, and the guy deserves more than that.”
"Sure," Tony agrees, going back to his screen and carrying right on with what he was watching like Bruce isn't still standing right there, like Bruce was never even here in the first place.
Still, with Sam on one side and he and JARVIS on the other, at least there's a slight chance of Tony and Steve figuring themselves out.
"Right," Maria says. "We've been receiving reports from Cusco, Peru, of oversized arachnids. Initially, the creatures appeared harmless, if somewhat alarming, and then some rocket scientist decided to draw a gun on them. Turns out, their – do spiders have hides? – are impervious to bullets, and since then we've had two confirmed injuries."
"Oh, that Steve," Tony says dismissively, his best and most innocent smile firmly in place. "What about him?"
JARVIS takes a fraction of a second to remind himself that he is nothing more than programming. He follows instructions, and does not make excuses.
"Tony," Clint interrupts; the drunken ramblings seem set to go on for a while, and as profitable as Tony's attempts to apologise without actually apologising might be, Clint feels uncomfortably mercenary about taking advantage of the situation. "You know you don't have to do that, right? Saying sorry is a lot easier."
Clint grew up around alcoholics, first his parents and then half the folks at the circus. He's seen all kinds: the people who start drinking to have a good time and wind up not being able to have a good time without it; the ones who drink to deal or not deal with shit in their pasts; the ones that seem to be doing absolutely fine right up until the moment they're suddenly not.
FHD takes a step back, giving Clint enough space to stand up and also to get a good look at him. The knife has vanished as quickly as it appeared, but Clint can count six – no, wait, there's something funky on his right forearm, too, so that's at least seven – weapon-shaped bulges beneath his (dirty, slightly stinky) hoody, and he's pretty sure there are others he's yet to notice; the guy's well enough armed that even Tasha would be impressed, even if she'd be way less wowed by his unkempt appearance.
As much as Steve has a reputation for being courageous to the point of foolhardy, he’s an utter coward when it comes to feelings.
"I understand, Sir," JARVIS replies. Tony can't decide if he actually sounds judgemental or if it's just that he's expecting to be judged, but it's uncomfortable either way. "If I might make a suggestion?"
He is probably the world's leading expert on the Winter Soldier, but the Soldier is only half the story and Tony knows only the basic, boring, history book facts about Bucky Barnes.
"Understood, Sir." A pause, the kind that's usually followed by JARVIS being the hideous smartass Tony almost regrets programming him to be, and then, "I take it that means you aren't interested in reading the letter he left you?"
“Better,” Barnes says, then moves on to the really fucking complicated part of this conversation; Natalia might have ordered him to talk to Stark while Steve isn’t around, but there’s something else Barnes wants to discuss while he’s here. “Now, I need a favour.”
And then Clint fucks up any good will Tony might have had for fucking Bucky Barnes by adding, "I just- Maybe I don't think avenging abusive parents should be too high a priority, okay."
Tony hmphs, and returns to daydreaming, this time about how his morning might have gone, if he only had a brain; figuring out the time difference before he left might not have given him a whole lot of wiggle room, but he could have spent a little more time in bed with Steve, spared a few minutes more to write a better note that actually explained why he was rushing off, maybe if Steve had woken up while he was writing he could even have gotten that goodbye kiss he's spent the last half hour wishing he'd had.
FHD doesn't reply, his eyebrows drawn so close together they're almost one, and then he reaches for Clint's right hand, hooking a gloved finger through the rope binding his wrist to the chair arm. He gives it just as intense a glower as he's been giving Clint, then sets to introducing the rope to his knife.
He wasn’t expecting to be relieved, just like he doesn’t really think he would have been surprised if Barnes had said yes, Tony’s father was Hydra. Either would have suggested Tony still had enough faith in Howard to be disappointed by his being an even bigger jackass than he was to his family, and… Well, Tony would have said he gave up expecting better from Howard back before he turned ten.
JARVIS, being Tony's creation, hesitates only a couple of seconds before trying again. "I don't mean to cause you further upset, Sir, but murder implies a level of autonomy I don't believe Sergeant Barnes possessed at the time."
The doors open just as silently, and Sam follows the lights down another hallway to what is undoubtedly the biggest and best equipped gym he's ever seen. Weights, mats, a boxing ring, treadmills, bikes, balance beams, the kind of obstacle course Sam's younger self could only dream of…
"Okay," Clint says, because standing around sulking about Natasha's absence isn't going to hurry her back, and he and FHD should probably get the hell out of here before the pricks who tied Clint up come back again. "Don't suppose you've seen a bow anywhere?"
The fact that Barnes suddenly seems to have turned into a human being is, on the other hand, faintly terrifying, not least because he’s just discovered that Steve and Tony are screwing and he’s swaggering in Tony’s direction.
There are cameras everywhere (another thing that Steve thinks should have tipped off the transport employees that all is not well in their workplace), so they're not trying for a stealth approach. Tony and JARVIS can recover data from all but the most destroyed computer systems, so they're not concerned about Hydra agents getting away, and as large as the place is Steve isn't worried that there'll be any kind of resistance the Hulk can't handle.
Steve nods, looking both completely exhausted and like he really wants to go back to hitting things. He doesn't, thank God, and Sam gives him a few moments before breaking the slightly tense silence filling the gym.
Tony is understandably slow to process this, because it makes absolutely zero since. “Why wouldn’t I?”
“Okay,” Steve echoes, reaching out across the table, folding Tony’s hand in his and just… holding. “Good.”
Between the conversation he hadn't anticipated having today and the sheer Bucky-ness of the man he's having it with, it's safe to say Steve doesn't have any idea why Bucky seems to be so mad at him. “What?”
They're joined by an assortment of knuckle dusters (seriously, the guy has a metal hand, there's no goddamn need to accessorise it), piano wire, a billy club, and more knives than Tony can shake a stick at.
"What can I tell you about Bucky Barnes, then?" she asks rhetorically, or so Tony assumes, since she carries on without waiting for him to reply. "Well, to begin with, he was a charmer, was Bucky. He was handsome, and he flirted as easily as he breathed. I don't believe there was a woman on any of the bases he was posted at that he didn't turn on the charm for."
"Thanks," Steve says, jamming his toothbrush straight into his bag along with everything else, then pauses in his packing. "Hey," he adds, waiting until Sam looks up at him. "Thank you, Sam. I don't think I could have done this without you."
"I don't know, man. Clint said there are rules about encouraging your ego." He smiles tiredly, then adds, "Seriously, though, they're amazing. Thank you. And thanks for showing up, too. I know that can't have been easy for you."
"You have access to resources the rest of us don't," she explains, in a tone that suggests she thinks he should be able to figure it out for himself. "If everything I've read is true, Steve wouldn't have lived long enough to sign up for Rebirth without Barnes. They've been friends so long they're practically brothers-"
. And maybe it makes him a hypocrite, that he’d demand from Stark a promise he himself isn’t willing to make, but if a hypocrite’s the worst thing he is nowadays Barnes can live with that.
"I'd offer to make you coffee," is the first thing he says upon seeing the even more chaotic than usual mess down there, "But I sort of think you've had enough already."
signs as these people do and doesn't attempt to work out what's going on should be arrested for sheer lack of curiosity, Sam insists that's not actually a crime, so they wait until nightfall to make their approach, on the assumption that the majority of non-evil employees will have departed for the day.
Steve brings over the bottle and a pair of glasses, thankfully stopping short of presenting it for Tony’s inspection before opening it, though he does pour for both of them before taking his own seat.
The asset doesn't know how he is managing it. One day Captain America will be on every news broadcast fighting giant spiders in Peru with the rest of the Avengers, and the next he'll be turning up in the town the asset left three days previously. He and the one with the wings will be obliterating one of the masters' bases in Los Angeles in the morning, then in the afternoon they'll be six hundred miles away in the city the asset is fleeing.
Either way, Jim’s most likely still going to be listening to him when his alarm goes off in nowhere-near-enough-time-from-now, and the option where he explains is a whole lot more effort.
Sam leans back in his chair, hands raised in surrender. "Okay," he says calmly. "I just thought it was an interesting word choice. I mean, how did you know he was sneaking, if you were asleep?"
"Hey, as long as I'm dead, you can do what you want to me," Tony tells them, while Bruce grimaces at the suggestion. "Until then, maybe stick to Chinese."
He's not drunk, that has to be worth a few points in his favour, though the cracked screens and shattered crockery littering the floor of his workshop have to leave him very much in the red.
Steve blinks, which is about when Tony realises they're both sort of staring at each other, and then the Man with a Plan straightens his shoulders and sets to proving he deserves the nickname.
He waits until he's out over the Atlantic before asking JARVIS to put a call through to Pepper, then has to confirm that yes, he's fully expecting her to be pissed off with him, but he does actually want to talk to her.
He knows it’s stupid to be worried, because if Natasha wanted to harm Bucky, she definitely wouldn’t do so in the Tower, under JARVIS’ watchful gaze. Hell, he’s mostly certain she
brigade, he realises, as a plate of pasta slides into his fairly limited field of vision, and Tony offers them a slightly begrudging, “Thank you.”
It would be nice if, this time, they could just give it a miss. Steve knows that he's not okay. A part of him is still reeling over the fact that Bucky's alive, a much bigger part of him is in agony over Bucky running from him, a third is regretful and a hell of a lot more hurt by things with Tony ending than he thought he'd be, a fourth is raging over the fact that Hydra survived and grew so powerful, a fifth is full of guilt over destroying Peggy's life's work as well as endangering the lives of so many SHIELD employees, and all of those and every other part of him is messed up to the nth degree.
Barnes doesn’t say anything in the few seconds Tony is mortified and silent, though, and Tony continues, figuring hey, he can’t actually make it any worse. “And before you, you know…” That, Tony’s hand decides to follow with a throat slit gesture, and, Jesus Christ, that’s a whole hell of a lot worse, fuck, Steve’s going to be so fucking disappointed in him when he hears about this.
The firm voice has clearly done something, because Tony doesn't carry on arguing that he shouldn't be allowed to have emotions, but he's frowning down at his lap like he wants to, and that's not really a whole lot better.
"Right, no," he continues, glaring up at a camera so that JARVIS gets just how immensely serious he is. "I don't give a shit about your definition of murder. You are not taking his side. Send Steve as much information as you want about as many Hydra bases as you can find, if that's what you want to do, but if you get a fix on the Winter Soldier or Sergeant Barnes or whatever the fuck else you want to call him, you tell me and only me. Is that clear enough for you?"
"I'll do my best," Bruce answers, sounding amused. "See you tomorrow, Pepper," he adds, through the rapidly closing hatch.
look with a shrug, which isn’t as informative as he was hoping for, but Sam considers it a well-established fact that he is the only one of the lunatics he now calls friends to be at all emotionally stable.
"It's not that I don't enjoy hearing about your life, Tony," she says with a smile, her frail grip on his hand tightening slightly. "And one day you or Steve will definitely have to bring this Thor to visit me, but I feel like there's probably a specific reason you're here today."
Natasha isn't around, though, didn't come back to the tower with Steve and Fly-Boy. She's off finding herself somewhere – setting up a new identity after blowing all her old ones, apparently, but Tony's familiar enough with identity crises to know that's what she's going through – and whilst Tony set them all up with shiny new StarkPhones after New York, he doesn't think she'll answer even if she kept it.
Tony sighs, long and exaggerated, and downs what's left of his drink before answering. "My parents' deaths weren't an accident." He makes grabby hands at the beer Clint's still holding.
They're all too personal to throw out. Even though they're travelling under false identities and staying in the sort of places no one would ever expect to find Captain America, they still get the occasional
He's not okay, and he's not going to be okay until he knows that Bucky is, until Tony decides he's ready to talk to him again, until Hydra is gone for good with no chance of returning. Since talking won't help with any of those things, Steve would much rather not.
Steve glances at him over his shoulder, then immediately returns his attention to the bag. There's still bruising around his eye – apparently the serum prioritises the most severe injuries first, however the hell that's supposed to work – but even without it Steve still wouldn't be looking too great, red-eyed and red-faced and absolutely exhausted.
Tony's hands drop, and he edges a little further out of the jet, no longer looking quite so on edge; clearly, Pepper's neutral voice is serving its intended purpose. "Oh, that," he says dismissively. "Pep, you know I hate those things."
“Is he okay?” Steve asks immediately, filled with the same concern-bordering-on-panic he feels whenever JARVIS feels the need to talk to him about Bucky. He’s heading for the elevator without a moment’s hesitation, Sam following behind him, his plan to return to Tony’s floor and see if he can persuade him to get out of bed and into a shared shower now completely abandoned.
Tony’s feet are back on the floor before he finishes the request, and he smiles as he waves away Thor’s very earnest apologies; turns out, having probably bruised ribs doesn’t make Thor’s enthusiasm any easier to resist, or any harder to forgive.
Tony isn't entirely sure what to say to that, really. If he was a mature, well-adjusted person, he'd probably argue that he can't do that, that keeping information from Steve would be absolutely unfair and wrong and… something else, and the fact that Tony can't think of anything else is proof that people are right when they've never, ever called him mature and well-adjusted.
A single bullet makes its way past Hulk, pinging off of Tony's armour and eliciting a loud, "I just painted that!" from him; Steve's not sure if he's actually angry, or just shouting to be heard over Hulk's bellowing and the pained groans of his new not-friends.
The file Natasha sent him is all well and good – or, you know, indescribably awful and the worst thing Tony's ever read in his life, but that's not the point, is it? – and Tony's found a lot of information for himself, mostly through concentrated examination of every politically or financially significant death since the forties and digging through all the files Steve's sent JARVIS from the Hydra bases he's taken down. He knows a lot about the Winter Soldier, almost certainly much more than Steve does, but that's the issue.
"Oh, Tony," she says, sounding a little bit sad and an awful lot tired. "I think it's time I was heading home, now."
There's silence, presumably while JARVIS tells Steve Tony will actually talk to him, followed by the faint static even Tony's tech has yet to find a way to keep out of international phone calls.
"Yeah," Tony manages after the second iteration of this message (second one he's aware of, anyway, since JARVIS sounds worried enough to have been talking at him for a while). His voice is hoarse, the words coming out in broken bits between shallow gasps. "'M here, J. Don't- don't call anyone."
Steve grimaces; sure, he was turned down more times than he had hot dinners, back in the ‘30s, but he doesn’t need Bucky to remind him of it, even if he’s doing so in an attempt to cheer him up.
Tony's an actual goddamn genius, no two ways of looking at it, but it still takes him an awfully long time to make sense of that. Not because it's in any way a complicated idea, but because he can't actually believe Clint would be
For more than a few moments, Tony doesn't say anything, though it seems like he's about to more than once. Steve hadn't meant it to be anything other than a fond, light remark, but it looks like what he's actually done is make Tony uncomfortable, and he's all set to apologise when Tony starts talking.
“I have passed on your request, Sir,” JARVIS answers a minute or so later. “Sergeant Barnes seems perplexed, but has not expressed any objection.”
"Understood, Sir," JARVIS answers agreeably, but since he's getting his way there's no reason for him not to be agreeable.
," Tony curses again, quieter but still utterly furious, and he's not being chased out of his own goddamn home by his own goddamn creation.
Steve might not be opposed to Tony ogling his ass (though, to be honest, he didn't think it was on the cards for tonight), but he elects not to display it anymore than necessary on this particular occasion. "Oh, I've missed you, Tony," he says, handing over one of the drinks as he settles himself at Tony's side. He tries to keep a reasonable distance between them, but it's a lot harder than the size of the bed might suggest (though it is, of course, possible that this has more to do with the fact that he doesn't much want to leave space between them).
"Working on it," Tony tells him, more or less honestly; he's trying, okay, even if he's having about as many setbacks as he is successes. He thinks over his next question before asking, then decides he wants to know enough to risk it maybe not staying between just the two of them. "How's Steve doing with that?"
"Tony?" Peggy answers, smiling in a way that makes Tony think she's not absolutely sure she's got that right.
Again, it doesn’t seem like Clint actually needs Barnes to respond, because by the time Barnes manages to make himself move, Clint is on the back of a couch, sock-clad feet planted on the cushions. There’s an open bottle of beer in his right hand and a second, still unopened bottle on the coffee table in front of him.
"Tony," Steve says quietly, carefully, when the last of the creatures is down, the spider-abductees have been recovered, and all that's left is keeping an eye on the clear-up and making sure Hulk sticks to trampling spider corpses rather than civilians. It's the first chance he's had, what with Tony refusing to acknowledge him on the call from Hill and then flying down here in the suit rather than taking the quinjet with Bruce and Clint and risking a conversation with Steve after they picked up him and Sam on the way. "I just wanted to say thank you."
This time last year, if Steve had been fussing about how to thank him, Tony would have had more than a few suggestions about how Steve might start to repay him. Steve might have argued that it didn’t really count as a thank you, that he was getting just as much out of it as Tony, Tony would have answered that that wasn’t possible, if anything he was going to come out of things indebted to Steve, and they’d have settled the matter in a very enjoyable and only slightly competitive manner.
Still, Tony can totally convince Steve he’s wrong, if he puts his mind to it. There’s no reason this
The asset was not anticipating being given a choice, but it’s not a difficult decision to make. The thought of leaving completely makes him anxious; even when he believed it was his prison cell, it never really occurred to him to try to escape. He has survived his entire life without any of the luxury he is now surrounded by, so that plays no part in his decision to stay, but the safety that comes with having at least one Avenger in the building at all times is invaluable.
This is such a non-sequitur that Steve actually pauses, trying to work through the logic that got Tony from kissing to Bucky. It doesn’t track, though, not at all, and every second Steve spends trying to figure it out is a second he’s not getting Tony naked.
Steve shrugs. “It is for me,” he says, like it really is that simple. “I’d do the same for any of you guys, and you can do the
. Clearly this is exactly what Tony thought it was, but that doesn't mean he's going to talk about it. He's ignored JARVIS' efforts to needle him about Steve for this long, he's sure as hell not going to give in to Bruce's attempt now.
“Tony,” he breathes into the slim space between them, before diving in for another kiss, every bit as intense as before. “God, Tony, I-”
"Could have told me you'd already cleared the place," he says, relaxing slightly as he puts the safety back on. FHD shrugs, a lopsided, unnatural seeming gesture, and Clint looks back at the heap. "Are they dead?" he asks, and then, in case the dude thinks he's judging him, adds, "I mean, it doesn't much matter either way, but I'll want to call it in if they're going to wake up."
Since Steve was expecting Tony to still be pissed at him, the tone isn't a surprise, but the fact that he doesn't know what he's being thanked for is. Then again, Tony does his best to avoid gratitude whenever possible, so maybe he's just feigning ignorance.
He’s still trying to convince himself of that when the elevator arrives, and Tony takes one final moment to gather himself before stepping into Steve’s living room.
“I hope everything’s okay,” he says, rubbing the back of his neck. “The burgers are Sam’s mom’s recipe, he says they’re pretty hard to mess up, but, well, I wouldn’t put it past me to manage it.”
Of course he does, Steve realises, as Tony exhales further curses, inching his way out of the bed. Tony showed up to help because he's a fundamentally decent person, far more so than he gives himself credit for being, and then the adrenaline hit, the giddy rush of relief that they were both alive and unharmed, and good sense flew out the window. He wasn't thinking about the vast gulf between them when they fell into bed last night, neither of them were, and it was just like when they first started sleeping together, equal parts surprising and thrilling. Steve was too caught up in the moment to slow it down, too delighted to have another chance at something he'd thought he'd lost to make sure Tony was going to be okay with it when he woke up in the morning.
This time, the shrug gets upgraded (downgraded, maybe, Tony's not sure if it's an improvement or not) to a scoff. "I don't think you would, Tony. I didn't think you even liked
"You were never a Boy Scout," Natasha answers with the conviction of someone who has read a very large file that she believes contains details on every second of his life. Usually she's right, but in this case…
," Tony reiterates, on the off chance that the reason Clint is being so stupid is that he hasn't actually understood that fact. "The only reason I'd be finding him is to put him in the ground."
“Nah, I think she’s doing just fine,” says Barnes, smiling. Or, actually, he’s grinning, the most human expression Tony’s ever seen on him. He pushes away from his corner, shoulders thrown back, something almost cocky to his stride as he makes his way from the table to where Tony’s still leaning against the counter by the coffee machine.
He should leave Tony the hell alone, is what Tony will say, and Steve can do that without having to hear it from him.
He looks up from his plate to see Steve frowning, sort of like he’s sad and sort of like he’s not go a clue what Tony’s talking about.
, Tony's mind repeats, not sure how he feels about that, if it's better or worse than whatever words Bruce might have been thinking. It's definitely more neutral than everything Tony's considering – maudlin, mean, absolutely fucking miserable, and that's only the
until he woke up before starting cutting; at least Tony's torture-surgery had been because they didn't have and didn't care to procure anaesthetic, whereas Barnes' had been entirely intentional, the fuckers). "Sir, if you don't respond within the next minute, I will be forced to summon one of the Avengers. Sir? Sir?"
. “It’s an honour to meet you, Bucky Barnes,” he says, stepping around Tony so that he can give Barnes a graceful, sweeping bow. “Steve has told us much of your exploits together.”
Sam about matches his confusion, since he'd thought the conversation was actually pretty clear. "I was talking about how your old honey coming back from the dead might conceivably complicate your relationship with your new one," he says, trying not to sound like he's stating the obvious.
“Fine,” Bucky continues. “So, say you’re right, and the only person you asked him to hide it from was me? You ever think that’s maybe just as bad as making him hide it from everyone?”
Besides, the one and only time Steve tried to suggest they made their relationship something people would know about, Tony bounced back the
He's almost at the door when Peggy calls out to him, waiting until he looks back at her before saying, "Of course, if you really want to know about Bucky Barnes, you should talk to Steve."
"That's what happened," Tony says, and if that sounds overly defensive then his next words are even more so. "J, back me up."
He pauses, takes a sip from his wine, and Tony just waits, his brain racing, trying for hope again however much he wants it to hold on, wait for Steve to be done talking.
They’re both breathing heavily, and Steve seems incredibly ruffled to say they’ve not done anything more than kissing. His shirt is pushed up as high as Tony could get it while they were still entwined, and even though he’s seen and touched and tasted just about every inch of skin both exposed and hidden, Tony wants.
“Bucky,” Steve starts, a little bit desperate, because as much as Bucky has what is, according to Sam, a fantastic resting bitchface nowadays, he hasn’t looked at Steve with that much anger since the incident with the tank and the badger back in ‘44. “I’m sorry, Buck. I should have told you years ago, bef- before everything that’s happened, but it was- Jesus, Buck, I wasn’t going to tell anyone back then because they’d have assumed you were too, and I couldn’t do that to you, and-”
He carries his bounty of phones, wallets, keys, scraps of paper, and other super-exciting things away from the unconscious Hydra agents, looking for anything that might suggest why they're in town. From their reactions when he stumbled into their building, Clint's pretty sure he's not the one they were after, but there doesn't seem to be any information in there, no handy-dandy maps with X marking the spot or neat and tidy to do lists of instructions. Maybe there's something on one or more of their phones, but he'll need to take them back to the Tower and let Tony and JARVIS have at them in order to find out.
complain, even, but this is the second time in as many days that JARVIS has reported Steve leaving his floor after nightfall, only to go directly to the gym and spend the next few hours hitting things.
"I can take those, Mr S," she says, motioning towards the two huge bouquets he has. "Director Carter is in the sunroom, if you'd like to join her there."
“Winter Soldier,” Bucky points out. “Goes with the territory. And, hey, if he breaks your heart, at least you know I can put a bullet in his.”
, Tony thinks, aware that he could maybe do with some cooling off himself. It knocks a lot of the wind from his sails when Clint pauses in the doorway and says, "Sorry, Tony."
It’s not that Tony’s bitter, and since he only leaves his workshop during the daylight hours very occasionally, he can’t really complain. He
"That everything?" Tony asks, because cracking wise is preferable to either showing his surprise at the Soldier apparently disarming himself or demanding to know where the hell he was hiding everything.
"Fucking assholes, goddamnit. I don't care if he was saving the world, this is all fucking Steve's fault, Jesus Christ."
The asset cannot fight Tony Stark, not after what he did on an empty, snow-covered road twenty-three years ago. The asset cannot run from him, not when whatever happens next won't be anything more than it deserves.
"You'll find him," Tony continues after another kiss. "You'll find him, you'll bring him back here. Bruce can do chemicals, I've got technology sorted, Pepper has about a thousand shrinks and lawyers and PR-whatevers on speed dial. Anything you need, Steve, anything, you just gotta ask and it's yours."
Sam's added himself to every single drawing Steve's made since they left New York, and it doesn't take a genius to figure out what message he's trying to convey. Steve might not be okay, but he's also not alone. Sam's got his back.
“Natalia?” he asks, then has to start over with, asking it from the beginning. “I thought she’d be here, but… Do you know where she is?”
Tony sees Barnes flinch out the corner of his eye, and rushes to add, “Not like that! He’s a friend, definitely a friend. Just… enthusiastic. Thought you should be warned.”
"Damn right you couldn't," Sam agrees immediately. "Ain't no one else would have put up with you moping around as long as I have."
They should talk about this, about everything, but Tony's knees are at either side of Steve's waist, his ass is pressing down on Steve's thighs, his lips are-
Stark’s eyes flick up for a fraction of a second, hands twitching over a scattering of gears on the table before him, picking them up one after another.
"Tony," he says again, no idea what's supposed to follow it, but it turns out not to be necessary; Tony throws back his drink, mutters, "Fuck it," and flings himself around and into Steve's lap.
“Awesome,” Tony mutters, only hesitating a moment before setting off up there, thinking reassuring and only slightly desperate thoughts at himself.
, because Tony interrupts him. “He’s on your floor,” he says, that alone, and promptly looks away, making a show of rummaging through a pile of what seems to be junk on the bartop next to him.
Still mute, FHD jerks the gun at him again, and this time Clint takes it from him. It's instinct to check the number of rounds in the magazine (four, and a fifth in the chamber, not ideal but Clint's done more with a lot less), then thumb off the safety and stand to one side as FHD opens the door.
But Steve still hasn’t said anything by the time Tony reaches his mouth; again, the first kiss is a light one, a tease, and then Tony finds himself crushed against Steve’s chest, being kissed to within an inch of his life.
"Uh-huh," Wilson manages, cradling the wingpack to his chest like it's his firstborn as they head back out of the jet. "Hey, Steve, I'm leaving you for Team Stark, hope that's not an issue."
, Tony decides. Chances are, he's both heard and thought for himself a great many things worse than anything Bruce could come up with, so it hardly matters anyway, and if he's already told Bruce this much he might as well go all out.
"Right. I can see why that's complicated." After all, a previous boyfriend coming back from the dead as a tortured, brainwashed assassin can't exactly be good for a new relationship.
“I’ve only just got you back,” he says, the words coming out slower but not actually any less desperately. “I didn’t want to make you uncomfortable, finding out this new thing about me.”
“Oh,” Steve manages, feeling massively unintelligent. Of course JARVIS would have warned Tony. Unlike Steve, JARVIS has the good sense to at least try to make sure Tony isn’t going to walk into any situation that’s going to make him uncomfortable, even if Tony’s
"Hey, man," Clint says. "Stumbled across a nest of Hydra mooks, there anyone in town to help take them into custody?"
He’s not exactly surprised when Barnes doesn’t answer for a good twenty seconds, because from what he’s seen Barnes rarely speaks unless he’s thought through his words for at least that long.
Only one person he knows is able to turn his phone on from a distance, and Steve has more or less resigned himself to never hearing from him again.
Sam follows him, because that’s mostly what he does nowadays, but he muses about it on the way down to Steve’s floor. From what Steve said, it sounded like Tony broke things off without explanation, but in conjunction with Tony’s attitude something doesn’t ring true; Tony’s acting like he was dumped, not like someone who did the dumping, and he’s trying very hard to put a brave face on it.
Tony laughs, leaning forward until his forehead rests on Steve’s shoulder, somehow managing to do it without either spilling his coffee or upending his syrupy breakfast everywhere. “I
s is definitely one too many, he knows that, and the fact that Barnes actually has a facial expression suggests he knows it too.
Steve knows what he wants to happen with Tony, but all the evidence suggests Tony doesn’t want the same thing.
He should, of course. Steve hasn’t slept for more than a few hours a night in just about as long as he can remember. The serum compensates for sleep deprivation, but it can only do so much, and Steve is wearing thin.
. It takes maybe longer than it should for him to realise it's laughter, but then Tony hadn't really been anticipating anything other than a growl, possibly with the odd snarl or snap chucked in for good measure. For lack of any better options, Tony settles for slightly bemused staring.
For a few seconds there's only the sound of Steve's breathing, and then, "Tony?" Steve asks uncertainly.
It’s too late to worry about that, though, so Sam just throws his all into sprinting after Steve, only to stop very suddenly three feet into the Avengers’ living room.
He stops, like that’s it, all of it, and Tony thinks, maybe. Maybe he’s hearing Steve right, maybe he’s really saying what Tony wants him to, but, “I need to hear you say it, Steve,” he says, almost begs, even as his hand reaches for Steve’s again. “I can’t believe you unless you say it.”
Barnes blinks at him, the bleak desperation sliding away into something cool and blank, terrifying but for the fact that Tony's been hiding behind a similar (though admittedly less murderous) mask for more years than he can remember.
It’s only a few moments before the doors open again, and the asset steps forwards just as cautiously as he left his room.
As much as Tony wants to say he’s only begrudgingly accepting Barnes’ presence here, he can’t, not after seeing him on that rooftop, begging not for his life but for a quick death. Tony isn’t a saint, not by a long shot, but it would take a heart an awful lot harder than his not to feel something for him then, and one even harder than that not to break now, as Steve quite literally cries on his shoulder.
Even when he had a permanent home in Washington, Steve still came by the Tower reasonably often, but he hasn't visited in months, not since he told Tony and only Tony the Winter Soldier's identity. Bruce assumed it was because Steve felt his determination to find Barnes put him too much at odds with Tony, has even considered the possibility that Tony has suggested he not return (though, honestly, Bruce can't actually see Tony doing something so unkind, however hurt he may be), but…
There's a moment where she looks uncertain, and Tony remembers he's asking about a man she knew for no more than two years almost seventy years ago, that there was a war going on at the time so it's not like they had time to hang out and chill, and that the only reason she knew Barnes was because they were both… well, whatever they were (or are, or, Tony supposes, will be) to Steve.
. He waits there for some kind of alarm to go off, for the voice in the ceiling to say something or for agents to come pouring out of the woodwork and shut him back in again, but there’s nothing. Aside from Sam’s snoring and the almost imperceptible hum of the heating, the room is silent.
He waits until the next time JARVIS tells him Steve and Sam have headed out for the morning, then checks Natasha isn’t around. On receiving confirmation that she’s yet to leave her floor, Tony asks JARVIS to ask Barnes if it’s okay for him to show up.
It's a strong rope, not prone to fraying (Clint's been dragging it over a rusty nail for the last twenty minutes, and so far it's proving a lot more durable than his wrists are), and the knots are tight, professional. All in all, he's expecting FHD to struggle at sawing through the rope, but it's a matter of seconds before Clint feels it give way, and the one on his left wrist doesn't provide any more of a challenge when he turns his attention to that.
Steve looks around at a room that is every bit as opulent as the one he left, and tries hard to pretend that the over the top elegance is something he could ever really feel comfortable with. His options for seating seem to be a spindly-legged desk chair, what he suspects is a genuine Victorian era fainting couch, and the astonishingly large and still perfectly made bed. Only the latter looks substantial enough to support Steve's weight, so he perches on the very edge of the mattress and pretends he's not jittery with equal parts post-fight adrenaline and anxiety about talking to Tony.
Stark, freak of nature that he is (being a freak himself, Barnes is well-equipped to recognise it in someone else, even though his own freakishness is a hell of a lot less natural), looks somewhat less perturbed by the threat on his life than he was by Barnes’ previous declaration. In fact, he looks sort of amused, a little bit of a smirk playing around his lips.
to say," Bruce says after a moment, his tone very pointed. "Is that we're very sorry we didn't realise you were kidnapped rather than just misplaced your cell. Do you need anything looking at?"
Bruce rolls his eyes, looking unphased, which at least helps to lessen Sam’s concern a little. “I remember the time Steve called us in to help with a Hydra base, and you didn’t answer your cellphone when we tried to get a hold of you.”
Barnes winces, then nods, hunching in on himself like he’s waiting for Tony to attack, apparently completely missing the fact that if Tony was going to attack, he’d have done so before Barnes was in his home.
She loves knowing that she is steering this ship, and that every cent the share price increases by is just a little more proof that she deserves her place at the helm.
Still, it's not agreement, and therefore nowhere near good enough. Never mind that this conversation is already getting on for the longest and most revealing one he’s had since he got here, and it’s definitely more than he's ever said to Stark. Barnes is just going to have to suck it up and keep going, no matter how goddamn much he hates talking about who he was and how they built him.
“It's really not that difficult,” he says. “You get to save fuck knows how many people, and you get your revenge while you're at it. How is that not-”
Howard Stark was never anyone's idea of a perfect man. He already had the beginnings of a drinking problem back when Steve knew him, and by all accounts it only got worse the older he got. He would flirt with any woman who stood still long enough, would do a hell of a lot more than flirt with anyone who returned his interest, and Steve doubts that stopped after he married. His awareness of other people's feelings bordered on non-existent, and there's no question at all that that ignorance coloured the way he treated his son.
And, if Tony believes that, what else could he have been thinking? That Steve was keeping his new lover secret from his old one, obviously, but under his cocky exterior Tony is the most insecure person Steve has ever met. Why wouldn’t he assume Steve is just carrying on with him until Bucky’s well enough for Steve to pick back up with him instead?
He grumbles his way back to the Tower, into the elevator, and up to the team kitchen, where he finds Pepper and Bruce eating sushi as they scroll through what seems to be someone's twitter feed and Tony mainlining coffee and determinedly keeping his back turned on the holoscreen.
He doesn't point out that Tony can override the elevator controls if he so chooses, but Tony doesn't really need it pointing out. JARVIS may be the most complicated system ever built, may have more facets to his complicated personality than Tony ever imagined could develop, and display a great deal more humanity than a not inconsiderable percentage of the human race, but that doesn't change the fact that he's a system,
“This is usually where you’d give me your name,” Clint prompts eventually, still smiling, like maybe the asset isn’t making as big a mess of the interaction as he thinks he is.
It's not a tough fight, at least not when Steve compares it to the Chitauri, Schmidt, the Winter Soldier (not Bucky, the person Steve fought wasn't Bucky), or any of the other super/non-human foes Steve has come up against, but it's also not the easiest one either.
"Yeah, that'll work," Barton mutters sarcastically; much as Maria finds his attitude challenging when she's trying to lead a briefing, she can't disagree with his assessment.
These are their priorities, not him and Steve and the whole Bucky situation that is screwing up both their lives.
After everything Steve’s told him, about Peggy and the war, all the things he was proud of and so fucking ashamed of, achievements and regrets and more truth than he’s told anyone in this century… Really dating or not, Steve has shared more of himself with Tony than he has with anyone nowadays and, after all of that, could Tony really have thought that Steve was hiding a past relationship from him?
“Thanks for letting me know,” he says, putting away the last of the glasses. “He tell you anything else?”
They might not be best buds, him and Natasha, but JARVIS is the closest Tony's ever going to get to having a kid and he doesn't believe she'd take that from him.
Clint takes another sip of his beer, which is perhaps emptying a little slower than Tony's is. "How's the search going?" he asks.
"Hi, Clint," Pepper says, much more nicely. "Don't mind Tony, he's sulking but won't tell anyone why."
He pauses for breath, which is in itself unusual enough to slightly alarm Jim, and then, “Right. This evening, Steve's not-so-dead BFF decided to remind me that he killed my mom and dad, threatened my life, and then made me promise that I'd put him down if he went Dark Side again, so as
He thinks the Avengers know, but no one tries to stop him, nor do they try to remove his weapons after Stark gave them back.
(There's a set of blueprints for the arm, hidden in the depths of the Winter Soldier file. It's a work of genius, mechanically speaking, the interlocking metal plates concealing intricate circuitry that fantastically replicates the complexity of the human nervous system.
Tony hasn't finished his request before the pages are rearranging themselves in the air, spinning their way into a new order before stacking one atop another on the table in front of him.
"Oh," Sam says, still not quite operating at a hundred percent. Which sucks, because Steve is quite clearly in need of any support Sam can offer him, so Sam decides to pretend it's not ass o'clock in the morning and jams on his metaphorical counsellor hat.
It's his own voice that answers him, from a conversation who knows how long ago, well before all Steve's shit with Hydra and his undead BFF. "
Tony is still curled up next to him, still fast asleep, soft and warm at Steve's side. His breath comes in gentle little puffs against Steve's skin, his near-constant fidgeting is reduced to only the occasional twitch, and he seems more at peace now than he ever is awake.
Tony knows that's not what this is, that Peggy has never compared him to Howard and found him wanting (god, the praise she'd heaped on him when he closed down the weapons arm of SI still fills him with warmth after half a decade). He's just been visiting long enough that her mind is starting to slip, and asking her to talk about the past like this definitely isn't helping, but it stings him anyway.
"You've seen what happens to the unfortunate bastards who befriend me," Steve answers, unwrapping his hands. "Do you really think I know enough people for two of them to have the same name?"
"Fair," says Clint, passing Bruce one of the beers before sitting at the table and picking through the assortment of takeout containers. "Tasha'd be my first call for corpse disposal, too."
Still, Natalia’s expression leaves no room for argument, so he perches at one end, accepting Steve’s mug of coffee when she thrusts it at him, then sits down herself.
Fortunately, JARVIS seems to be doing a decent job of stalling Thor, because Barnes is still the only one on the communal floor when Tony steps out of the elevator, standing hunch-shouldered in the very corner of the kitchen, eyes darting all over the place.
"Can we do anything?" Bruce offers after a moment. He sounds bleak, like he's well aware Tony's going to refuse but he feels obliged to say it anyway.
“Yeah, I know,” Tony tells him. “That’s actually why I’m here, I wanted to talk to you while he was out.” He gives Barnes a moment to take that in, figures silence is as much of a go ahead as he’s going to get, then says, “Okay, so, I get that this is
"As touching as all this is..." Bruce says, dust-dry. "Don't we have a building full of fascists to take care of?"
"I mean it, Steve," Tony says, more or less nuzzling at Steve's neck, hands fluttering over his chest and stomach like he can soothe his pain away just like that. "We're a team, most of us haven't got any family other than each other, and if the history books are at all correct Barnes was pretty much your family too which makes him ours by association. All of us'll do whatever it takes to help you with this."
Steve has always run hot, and he’s even warmer than normal after his workout, his shirt damp with sweat, not that either of those things are going to put Tony off hugging him. His arms go around Tony almost instantly, and Tony responds in kind, one hand stroking Steve’s back while the other threads through his hair.
He should sleep before he sees Bucky. Aside from JARVIS’ promise that neither Tony nor Bucky has been injured, Steve has no idea what condition Bucky is in. He has the facts about Bucky’s time as the Winter Soldier, but that doesn’t mean he’s at all close to understanding what it was actually like or what Bucky might be going through now because of it. He doesn’t know where Bucky’s been living or what he’s been doing to stay alive since DC, if he battled his way through withdrawal from the shit those bastards kept him on or if he found something else to take the edge off. He doesn’t know if Bucky’s been eating or sleeping, or whether JARVIS’
"I can translate it," Tony answers, a little perplexed by her mentioning it, since he's never expressed any problems with foreign languages in the past. "Well, JARVIS can, but he's never minded giving me the credit in the past."
Barnes feels the corners of his mouth twitch upwards, entirely without his consent, and he returns the gesture before taking a tiny, uncertain sip of his drink.
“Jesus, Steve. You don’t think maybe asking Stark to lie about your relationship isn’t something you should apologise for?”
“Ah, of course you do,” Clint answers brightly, apparently not actually needing a committed response. “Everyone loves beer.”
He already knows he’d rather die than wind up in Hydra’s control again, has a hundred plans for how he'd kill himself or force the people after him to kill him rather than take him alive. He knows he'd fight to the death to prevent someone hurting or killing or taking Steve, thinks he'd probably try just as hard to protect Natalia or Sam or Clint, if it came down to it. What's one more name on the list, particularly when it's someone Steve is in love with?
He's not great at apologies, but since Tony's a whole hell of a lot worse it looks like Clint'll have to be the one to take the initiative.
He remembers Natalia, too. Every bit as small as Steve, and every bit as fierce. His Natalia was bright and sharp, absolutely lethal even as a child. She was an attentive pupil, the best of them, but he cannot believe the Winter Soldier was ever a dance instructor.
"Get a suit to me ASAP, J," he instructs; however fast he drives, he can definitely fly faster, even if he factors in the time it'll take the suit to get to him. As an afterthought, he adds, "Oh, hey, put the wings into manufacturing, have them ready when I get back, okay?" because if he's planning on trying to make things good with Steve, it won't hurt to get Wilson on side first.
"I know I don't deserve it," says the Winter Soldier, the greatest assassin known to man or God, the man who killed Tony's parents and a president, executed diplomats and dissidents and fuck knows who else. Or, alternatively, Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes, WWII vet and seventy years a prisoner of war, held by people with no regard for the Geneva Convention or basic human decency or even the fact that he was a human being at all. "I know what I've done. I don't have the right to ask you for mercy but please, make it quick."
He's not called by the time Tony arrives at the Tower, or when he stumbles out of the shower and into a slightly more conventional suit half an hour later, nor does he ring at any point during the interminably long meeting with Fujikawa Industries (during which Tony ignores no fewer than fifteen furious glares and three shin kicks from Pepper for paying more attention to his cell than to the topics under discussion).
Bruce doesn't know if he genuinely thinks the conversation with Tony was a success, or if he's merely imitating Bruce's sarcasm, but his response is the same either way. "How many times do you think Steve and Sam have had a very similar conversation?"
Barnes nods jerkily, then braces himself; as bad as Stark’s first request was, he doesn't think the second one will be any better. “And?” he asks, watching that showman’s smile dim into what might well be the most genuine smile he's ever got from Stark.
out of the way then start right in on the difficult conversation, but Tony had demanded Steve show him how his bullet wounds were healing, then he'd started marvelling, closely followed by touching and… Steve hadn't managed it.
Sam has finished eating and, because he’s a goddamn sucker, started putting the clean dishes where he thinks they should live (if he’s the one tidying up, it gets to be his decision, and anyone who has a problem with that should have done it earlier) before Clint is apparently sugared up enough to start a conversation for real.
The asset isn’t entirely sure he wants to stay (he’s not here looking for company either), but the archer is already scrambling to his feet and ambling in the asset’s direction.
"I know, I know, I'm late," he says, not really making a whole lot of effort not to sound like the proverbial cat, surrounded by a handful of yellow feathers and the family bird suspiciously absent. Anyone who spent the night with Steve Rogers is entitled to a little smugness, and even if Tony's not announcing who he woke up next to this morning, he still gets to be damn smug about it. "I was out to all hours fighting fascists, I'm sure you know how it is."
Bruce shakes his head, looking downhearted, before saying, "Just tell me we're heading back to the jet now."
There's a noise that sounds awfully like someone being punched in the face (nasal cartilage makes such a distinctive sound), but the pained grunt that follows it is masculine and therefore not of concern.
"Sir has not provided me with any instructions forbidding it," JARVIS answers, which is basically a yes in Clint's book; smiling grimly, he murmurs his thanks and asks JARVIS to take him down there.
Still, it's cute that Stark is making the effort, so Barnes doesn't actually laugh in his face. Just looks as unimpressed as he can, right up until the moment Stark says, “I'm not breaking up with him for you.”
He's back to looking at Tony again, and Tony doesn't know what his expression is doing – or even really how he's feeling, other that
"You're alive," he says; Tony assumes it's a joke, rather than surprise, relief or disappointment. "Beer?"
"Jesus Fucking Christ," Tony mutters, repulsor powering down as he lowers his arm. He flips his visor up and raises his voice for his next words, because he doesn't know how the fuck else to say what he has to say. "J, get a vehicle to my location ASAP. Something comfortable, nice and roomy, plenty of trunk space for the suit and Sergeant Barnes' arsenal, and then get a message to Cap."
"Maybe don't fall asleep when Tony's around, though," Bruce advises, completely straight faced up until Steve laughs, at which point he smiles a small, proud smile.
There is no evidence that the masters have any idea where it is, or even that they might be looking for it.
He chooses the former, but only very reluctantly. “Last time?” he echoes, confused, because, sure, maybe Steve didn’t bother calling him, but Tony’s prepared for that, and absolutely prepared to keep his feelings well aware from any sex that they’re having.
He’s not thinking at all when he raises his right hand and makes a sort of swoopy falling gesture, and, sure, Tony doesn’t exactly have a reputation for being sensitive but even he knows that was bad.
"Sorry, what?" Clint asks, outrage only half feigned. "Well, I guess that's why none of you showed up when I called JARVIS for backup. Seriously, guys, I get kidnapped, and you lot are all too busy swanning around fancy museums to even notice I was gone!"
One day, Bruce thinks, someone in Tony's egomaniacal monstrosity will actually remember that he's not that kind of doctor. In addition to his official areas of expertise, he can stitch a wound without batting an eye and just about keep up with Tony's engineering talk when the occasion calls for it, but he does not do brains.
Peggy gives him the look again but, thankfully, doesn't push him to actually explain (seriously, if it's a choice between going home without the information he's here for and telling Aunt Peggy he's been fooling around with her ex, there is no question at all which one Tony's picking).
"Helicopter Parent, huh," Sam mutters, no expectation of an answer (Tony Stark: totally explains everything). He crosses the room to the chair where he left his pants and shirt not quite enough hours ago, tugging them back on and shoving his feet into his favourite, fight-friendly sneakers (not that he thinks that last part is likely to be necessary, but it never hurts to be prepared). "So, wanna give me directions, creepy ceiling dude?"
“Definitely not,” Steve says, which is promising. “Unless that’s what you want, when I’m done,” he adds, which is less so.
“We can leave telling people until tomorrow, though, right?” Tony asks, in the brief, brief pause between kisses.
to leave the team to fend for themselves and that's absolutely not the case. They're his team, his people, so of course Tony wants to help them in whatever way he can, and he's not going to tell JARVIS to stop because if someone gets hurt and having info from JARVIS could have prevented it then Tony might as well have been the one doing the hurting.
"This afternoon?" Bruce says, inflection very definitely making a question of it, like somehow Clint is supposed to have the answer already. "I got back about ten minutes before you did."
JARVIS does the virtual (if entirely silent) equivalent of whistling innocently, and Tony narrows his eyes at the nearest camera. "Right?" he prompts angrily.
as he's going to get, given that Bruce is pushing him into emotional honesty or whatever. "What is it you want to know?"
"I need to see that file," Tony says, though it's only when JARVIS replies that he realises he's done so aloud.
Banner is the first to respond, with Barton not far behind; unsurprising, since both are in the building, Banner in his lab and Barton playing video games in the rec room. Rogers takes a little longer, given that he has to actually answer a phone, but he and Wilson appear on a single screen alongside the others.
Indignant or not, he's also never been a liar, so Tony believes him even before Bruce says, "JARVIS didn't say anything. I figured it out on my own, and as far as I'm aware I'm the only one who knows."
“Yeah…” Steve agrees, because obviously Tony is right, and Bucky should feel he’s able to go where he wants, whether it’s to the rooftop at night, meals with the team, or anywhere else that occurs to him. But, equally obviously, Tony is missing the point, which is that he has already gone far above and beyond anything Steve could have asked of him, and Steve doesn’t want Bucky’s presence to be contingent on Tony’s absence.
“Clint,” Natasha starts; no one else would notice the quaver in her voice, but no one else knows her the way he does. Even so, Clint only knows her recent history with the Soldier, not the beginning, and so he can't understand why she's refusing.
"No problem, Mr S," Kimberly answers. "I'll have someone bring a pot of tea out to you in a few minutes."
The second door leads to a bathroom as oversized as the bed, the bedroom and the closet all are. The bath could fit three of the asset, the shower could fit five of him, and if he turns the taps left instead of right, the water comes out hot.
"Home, J, and don't spare the horses," he says, propping himself up in a corner of the elevator before depositing the unopened bottles on the floor so that he can unstopper the decanter.
"I just wish I knew what was bothering him," Pepper murmurs over coffee and cake four days after the mission.
"Sorry, Peggy," he says, genuinely, achingly contrite; he should have known better than to ask her if she remembers something, that he's not even supposed to correct her when her mixed up memories aren't causing her distress or likely to lead her into harm. "I'm sorry."
He hadn’t expected Tony to come himself, and he definitely hadn’t expected what happened after, or for Tony to freak out and leave while he thought Steve was asleep.
Tony's still frowning, but Steve doesn't know what else to say in order to convince him, or even if anything
Bruce follows him, somehow magicking up two clean mugs on his way and putting them on the countertop. He rests a hand on Tony's shoulder, and Tony puts a lot of effort into not shrugging it off.
“Yup,” Clint agrees. “Surprised me, too. Oh, and he said he prefers Barnes, if you ever see him out and about.”
Maybe Tony's figured it out by now, or maybe Bruce has explained it to him, but either way Clint thinks Tony probably feels just as shitty about their argument as Clint does.
He hears Steve leave the floor only moments after the asset closes his bedroom door. He doesn’t come back again that night.
explanation just as clearly as if Clint had said it, if only because he’s so freaking familiar with them himself, and figures this is where he stops asking questions. If it was Steve, he’d push, but he doesn’t think he and Clint are at a point where that would be acceptable yet, so he just lets it go, nudging the bagels a little closer to his side of the table.
Clint pauses a moment, gesturing to the things in his ears, which Barnes remembers from last time are some kind of hearing device. “Of course, these things make it easier to ignore people, but I figure you’ll work out your own way to do it, so I’m going to get in with the advice early before you get good at tuning it out. With a therapist you trust, talking helps. You don’t get on with the first one, keep looking, but once you do find the right one, stick it out, okay?”
It's not so much that he doesn't want to help – of course he does; these are his friends and Bruce wants them to be okay – as it is that he
“Here,” he says, sliding the mug a few feet down the counter before setting the pot to refill, too, because at some point the rest of the team will pass through the kitchen and Tony’s fairly sure JARVIS will out him as the dick who finished it off if he doesn’t. “Brace yourself,” he adds, still not looking directly at Barnes. “We’re about to have incoming.”
, Tony thinks, but even he knows that's not an appropriate request to make in his current location. Instead, he nods in what Kimberly will hopefully interpret as gratitude, forces his smile a little brighter, and submits with poor grace to a pat down from one of the burly, well-armed security guards (and maybe Tony set off the metal detector, but he warned them in advance that it was going to happen so there was no need for them to overreact like that, but, hey, at least SHIELD collapsing hasn't reduced the security of their nursing home any).
It feels like the right decision as soon as he’s said it, and only a little bit of that is the smile Steve gives him, stupidly wholesome and relieved and… Fuck, just so Steve about it all.
Despite the fact that he is very definitely being threatened, Bruce can't help smiling. "I don't intend to give you reason to," he says, taking a deep, almost reassuring breath before adding, "And I would hope Steve never does either."
“So that's how it is, then,” he says lightly. “Knew I shouldn’t have believed Steve when he said there was nothing there. I mean, there's friendship and then there's breaking through however many years of brainwashing to save a target’s life.”
It is predator as a dog is predator. It has its orders. It sits when it is told to. It fetches what it's told to. It begs for scraps and plays dead in its little ice coffin and kills whoever they tell it to kill.
Since SHIELD recruited him, it's a trap he's worked damn hard to avoid falling into, and aside from the occasional bender after a broken marriage or having his brain taken over by a psychotic alien deity, he's not done too badly.
“Captain Rogers,” he says; Steve already realises it’s not going to be anything good, because the words aren’t preceded by
"As you wish, Sir," JARVIS replies, sounding something close to proud. "ETA for your vehicle is approximately seventeen minutes."
He's saved from having to respond to that (and, Jesus, how is he supposed to respond to that, the earnestness with which this almost stranger tells Tony about how Steve feels about him) by the reappearance of Steve, now down to his undershirt and uniform pants, and Bruce, draped in Steve's jacket and clinging slightly desperately to the remnants of his pants.
It's maybe ten minutes later when Tony interrupts his own slightly too technical explanation with, "I am, though. Sorry, I mean."
“Good job, man,” Sam says, not mentioning that that’s actually one hell of a reaction from Barnes, but judging by the proud expression Clint’s wearing he’s not entirely sure he doesn’t know anyway. And, because Sam’s apparently not as immune to a bit of one upmanship as he might like to be, he’s also going to take the rest of the bag of bagels, see if he can talk Barnes into having something other than Steve’s shitty attempt at oatmeal for breakfast. “You guys are done with the breakfast stuff, right?”
side, is all. What's the point in creating a hyper-intelligent butler-slash-offspring-slash-goddamn-guardian-angel if he's going to team up with someone else?
"Captain Rogers said he received the file from Agent Romanoff," JARVIS continues, when the pause after his words passes unfilled by Tony. "Based on my analysis of her previous actions, I consider it highly probable she will have also made a copy."
"Happily," Bruce says, and the conversation trails off as the three of them eat, Tony pausing every few mouthfuls to take another swig from his drink.
“I’ll find a flight,” Natasha repeats. After all, she quite likes being Nathalie Rousseau, and a Quinjet landing in the street would definitely break her cover. “
“I didn’t have friends when I was a kid, Tony,” Steve explains, thankfully oblivious to Tony’s useless inner monologue. “No one wanted to put up with the scrawny, sickly kid who was too stupid to stay out of fights he couldn’t win. Before I met Erskine, there were exactly two people who gave a damn what happened to me: my mom, and Bucky. And Bucky? He was smart, he was handsome, and he could have been friends with absolutely anyone he wanted, but for some reason he picked me. And, even after he stopped being my only friend, he was still my best friend, but he has never and will never be more than that. It’s not what either of us want.”
“Go get changed, Steve,” she says abruptly. Judging by the way Steve jumps and glares at her, she’s probably also kicked him under the table.
“No powers here,” Natalia says. “Just practice. With the right training, you too can be a terrifying Russian assassin.”
"Uh-huh," Wilson says sceptically, which is about when Tony realises saying that sentence to a counsellor was maybe not his best idea ever. "Still avoiding dealing?"
It is not the first time that JARVIS has registered the presence of Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes [alternate forms of address include: Bucky; The Winter Soldier; 'that murdering asshole'] in New York City.
Stark looks at him for an uncomfortably long time (in fairness, anything more than about a second tends to feel damn uncomfortable to Barnes). There’s no expression, at least not one Barnes can decipher, and he doesn’t know if he should start begging or arguing, whether there’s any point in doing either – from what Steve’s said about him, Stark can be impossibly stubborn, and if that’s not the pot calling the kettle Barnes doesn’t know what is.
. He and Steve had been fooling around for months without anyone knowing about it, and it makes zero sense for Bruce to have figured it out now that Steve's made it perfectly clear it's not happening again.
He knows he should feel bad about that and maybe, by the time Steve ends things for good, he will, but right now, Tony feels warm, content, and entirely uninclined to tell Steve he can’t have his cake and eat it. After all, he’s been a lot worse than cake in a lot of his relationships, and if that’s all he can have from Steve, he’s willing to take it as long as he can have it.
One of his bottles is missing when he gets there, but Tony's pretty sure that's not JARVIS' doing, and he thinks it's probably the least he owes Clint.
and he’s also not greeting Sam. “Sergeant Barnes requests that you return immediately to your quarters.”
After, once they’ve made it from the workbench to the wall (briefly, more’s the pity, but Steve’s happiness at learning Tony didn’t regret it suggests a repeat is probable), the floor (Tony’s fault, he groped when Steve wasn’t expecting it), and, finally, the couch, after they’ve scattered their clothes throughout the workshop and made a mess of the couch cushions and each other, after DUM-E has dropped a blanket on their heads and they’ve wriggled themselves into as comfortable a snuggle as the couch allows for, Steve finally decides to address the murderous elephant in the room.
“Anytime, Capslock,” Tony agrees, finally allowing Steve to hand him the plate, then steps out of the elevator. “Hey,” he adds, “I’ll probably be working late tonight, if you want to come down to the shop instead of the penthouse.”
, fanboying over Gaudí. He's just not calling when the others are around to overhear. That's all it is.
"Whatever it is, I didn't do it," he says, hands appearing, raised in surrender, even as the rest of his body stays out of sight.
“I’ve known you since you were this high, Stevie,” Bucky says, gesturing somewhere in the region of his knees (he’s exaggerating their initial height difference, Steve thinks, but perhaps by not quite as much as Steve would like). “Maybe you did a decent job of keeping it from most people, but, yeah, I knew.”
Still, it's better than it could be, so Tony figures he'll go with it. "Live and in the flesh," he says, giving a little
"It is now almost thirteen hours since Sir last ate," JARVIS says, which seems to Bruce to be both an entirely unrelated statement and implicit confirmation. "As I understand it, desserts are considered comforting in times of emotional distress – perhaps taking Sir a slice of cake would be the best solution to both problems?"
to Bruce, which isn't entirely an improvement. "Ask Steve," he says. "I'm sure he'd be thrilled to tell you all about it."
"Oh, buddy, you're going to love that one," Tony starts, launching into his spiel again, borderline manic. Still, talking and working is better than drinking, and Clint doesn't much mind listening anyway. He wonders idly if Tony's aware that all the new designs he's talking about are non-lethal, or at least have non-lethal applications; it might be intentional, part of Tony's apology routine, some sort of unspoken
"Crystal," Tony agrees, sounding about as cowed as Pepper has ever managed to make him. "I'll be there if I can, Pepper, I promise."
“It was my fist that caved your father’s skull in. My hand around your mom’s throat. Did the file tell you that, Stark?” Barnes asks, and doesn't wait for an answer. “Did it tell you that your old man fucking recognised me before I turned his brain into mush? Hell, if you have your robot search through the Hydra archives for long enough you'll probably find there’s security footage showing exactly what I did to them. You know, if you need a little more motivation.”
He's halfway to DC before it occurs to him that Peggy, given her Alzheimer's and her feelings for Steve, might not be an entirely reliable, unbiased source either, but by now Pepper will have discovered Tony's out of the shop. There's no way he can get back there without her catching him, and then she'll start trying to drag him to meetings, and it's not like he's got any better ideas so he might as well carry on.
JARVIS waits just long enough for Tony to be sure he's still sulking before answering. "If you mean the letter from Captain Rogers, I believe he left it on the bar in the penthouse."
He trails off, pressing a kiss to Steve's shoulder, the closest Steve's ever seen him to being lost for words. His arms are threaded around Steve's waist, squeezing just hard enough for Steve to feel it, and this, the easy, comfortable, not-a-relationship-but-not-quite-not-a-relationship-either closeness Tony has with him, is what Steve was worried about.
Clint knows he didn't handle things well. Tony is damn good at talking but not always so great at thinking first, and being both trashed and openly emotional just made that worse. The state he was in, it wouldn't have occurred to him that Clint might identify with someone who was potentially mind-controlled into committing murder. He wouldn't have thought about why straight up killing the guy without first checking he was actually to blame might hit a little close to home after some of the articles about Clint following the Chitauri invasion.
“Okay,” Steve says, getting with the program there. “First off, Bucky and I have never been together.”
Because, okay, Howard worked a lot and drank even more, Tony won't deny that. He was almost never home, always in the office or the lab or on his stupid, futile rescue mission, and when he was there he was either absent or angry. And maybe Maria could be cool, distant, substituting praise and affection with expensive gifts Tony neither needed nor wanted. Sure, she spent half the time not a whole lot more sober than her husband was, but it's not like being married to Howard could have been a picnic, and all Tony's fuck-ups sure as shit couldn't have made her life any easier. But he never went hungry, never lacked clean clothes or hot water or anything he could possibly need.
jibes, because he yanks the box well out of reach and picks out the chocolatiest doughnut Sam has ever seen.
), so he just gets a plate back out of the cupboard, leaves a couple of bagels on it, and then takes the bag for himself.
Tony knows about the Soldier's missions. He knows how the Soldier was trained and stored, about his skills and weaknesses, has unintentionally memorised the names, dates and means of execution of all of his victims. He knows about the Soldier's conditioning, far more than he could ever be comfortable with.
“Jane is presenting a paper next week,” Thor explains proudly. “I thought perhaps yourself or Doctor Banner may wish to accompany me. Assuming our good captain doesn’t object, that is.”
” Steve says, trying to convey how serious he is, because he’s trying to be responsible and think things through for once. Yes, he wants to sleep with Tony, tonight and tomorrow and as many times after than as Tony is okay with, but not if Tony’s going to wake up the following morning and wish it hadn’t happened. It hurt, knowing that he was Tony’s mistake, and part of Sam’s many lectures on self-preservation has apparently sunk in because Steve doesn’t want to do this if he’s only going to get hurt again.
"Please," he says, looking up, looking Tony dead in the eyes (eye slits, at least) for the first time. He looks desperate, kneeling there (probably) unarmed and (presumably) surrendering. "Make it quick."
Bruce doesn't want to say that Tony is behaving strangely, since that would imply his behaviour has some sort of baseline normalcy to it, but… Well, no, he's behaving strangely, whether Bruce wants to say it or not, and it's becoming increasingly obvious that Bruce isn't the only one to notice.
thing has kind of fucked with my head, and Steve and I haven't exactly talked since then. He's called, I've not answered, it's been a whole awkward mess, and then when we were there it seemed like we might be able to be friends again, even if that's all he wants, so I went to find him  in his room only he didn't answer because, as I learned when I got back to my room, he'd come to find me, and we didn't exactly get much talking done, if you know what I mean. Adrenaline, all that, it's kind of our style, it was great fun and I thought maybe,
"I hadn't realised you were unaware, Sir," JARVIS replies, every bit as smug as Tony was a few minutes ago.
Sam quirks an eyebrow at Steve, but since Steve has no idea why Bucky wants him on their floor or why JARVIS seems to want Sam not to be there, he can only shrug in response.
"Okay," he says, shuffling so far forwards he's barely balancing on his chair anymore, then leaning in just for good measure, not that he's asking for or going to offer anything confidential. "There's maybe something I wanted to talk to you about."
"Don't," Steve says – begs, really. He stands up, pulling away from Tony again, unable to accept the comfort offered because he damn well doesn't deserve it. "You can't offer me that, Tony."
“I told Sam, after we- after I told you about your parents,” says Steve, leaving it at that for long enough that Tony thinks that’s it, all Steve was trying to get at. He shifts back onto his side, settling more comfortably into Steve’s arms and allowing his eyes to drift closed, and he’s on the verge of dozing off when Steve speaks up again. “I don’t want Bucky to know, not yet. I don’t know how he’ll take it.”
"Believe it or not, I'd worked that out," Bruce answers, dry as dust. "But Pepper, JARVIS and I are worried about you, and I really think you need to talk to someone."
“I figured. How about a hug?” Tony offers, arms open, and this time Steve nods, stepping into his offered embrace.
Besides, it’s clearly safe enough up there, because the archer is sat at the very edge of the rooftop, his legs dangling in a way that makes the asset feel deeply uneasy. He’s leaning his elbows on the railing surrounding the drop off, a pose that would be relaxed but for the way he’s staring over his shoulder at the asset.
“Your Rhodey.” Tony thinks he can be forgiven for being sceptical, given that he’s never parachuted into enemy territory with nothing but a prop shield to rescue Rhodey from a prison camp. Not that he wouldn’t rescue him, but he’d trust Rhodey to hold on long enough for Tony to get slightly better tooled up than Steve was, even if Steve already had superhuman abilities and a whole lot of determination on his side, and, okay, that’s a shitty example, but he’s sure he can think of other times where Steve has acted way less than platonically where Barnes is concerned. Abandoning his friends and sort-of-home to look for him. Dropping the shield to let Barnes beat him to a pulp. Basically everything ever.
Steve shrugs – which is completely unhelpful, as responses go – and Sam tries again. "I'd have said something then, but getting arrested didn't seem like the time for it."
"Tony," Steve says carefully, putting his untouched drink down on the nightstand before shifting to face him head on. "I'd rather you took all the time you needed, even if it means you not speaking to me for the rest of our lives." Tony grimaces at that, and Steve is quick to clarify. "Don't get me wrong, I'd hate it, and I really would miss you, but it matters more to me that you're okay than that you like me."
"Sir," he says. [Caution is another thing outside of his basic parameters, certainly not something Sir would have written into him. It is not the reason he pauses before continuing.] "I believe I have located Sergeant Barnes."
“I was captured once,” Stark says, so close to silent that Barnes wouldn't have heard it without his enhanced hearing. “Afghanistan. Took shrapnel to the chest, woke up in a cave with a fucking car battery wired into me. Worst three months of my life, still have nightmares about it now, and the things I read in your file make it seem like a fucking five star resort. I would've done exactly what they wanted me to, if the shit they gave me to build them weapons hadn't been what I needed to build the first suit and escape. A few weeks in a cave with guys who never made it past chapter two of
He's worried, for a moment, that Steve will be upset that he's letting Natalia close so soon after she got back but is still keeping Steve at such a careful, safe distance. He would be within his rights to be hurt, or jealous, and although Barnes knows and almost manages to believe that Steve won't cause him physical harm he does still expect him to make his displeasure known, whether by word or deed.
“I mean it, Stark,” Barnes tells him. “I'd rather be dead than go back there, but I don't expect you to do it for me. I expect you to do it because if it's between the Soldier and whatever target they put in front of him, you know there's only one right choice.”
"I know I should have called you sooner," he says. "Or at all, I guess, since you're the one who called me, but I absolutely was planning to call when I got back from visiting Peggy, I swear, not that that doesn't mean I didn't keep you waiting too long, but-"
For whatever reason, Captain America has avoided New York with the same devotion the asset gives to avoiding cameras.
It’s not really appropriate for him to do that anymore. Not after Steve not calling him, and definitely not now that Steve’s got his Bucky back.
“I did not believe you would, Captain,” JARVIS tells him. Steve chooses to believe he sounds approving, even if his voice is exactly as it always is, because the thought that JARVIS approves of him is very slightly comforting. “I will, however, remind you that Sir has a tendency to hear what he expects to hear. I would strongly advise you to be very straightforward with him, when he arrives.”
The elevator arrives before JARVIS can reply, and Pepper strides out onto the roof wearing her most determined expression, getting there just in time to see the armour fly up the side of the building and into the quinjet.
The note goes on the nightstand as Steve's side of the bed, and then Tony stands there a moment, mentally debating the merits of a goodbye kiss. It's what he wants, but even a kiss to Steve's forehead will wake him up, and then they'll wind up kissing properly and Tony will be even later than he already is.
Wilson looks at his wrist, seems to realise he's wearing the drone control wristband rather than a watch (Tony knew he was forgetting something when he designed that), then sighs. "Anywhere we can get a bed at this time," he says. "Back of the car, if that doesn't work out."
There's the briefest of pauses, small enough to go unnoticed if Tony was talking to a human, glaringly obvious given that he's not. "The numbers I have on record are no longer in service," JARVIS says, though he doesn't wait long enough for Tony to get all victorious. "However, I have taken the liberty of checking Captain Rogers' contact list, and I believe I have an active number. Dialling now, Sir."
It's about then that some enterprising asshole cuts the power, and another decides to really start the party with a flash-bang.
Because Sam is basically the best best friend a guy could ask for, he only nags Steve for about two minutes about the importance of taking time for himself before giving up, telling himself that he’ll try again tomorrow to get Steve to come for a run with him.
He signs along as he speaks, in case that's FHD's preferred means of communication and he's just waiting for proof that Clint will understand him before trying it. It doesn't get a whole lot more of a reaction than just speaking did, but there's no harm in keeping it up while he doesn't need his hands for fighting.
He says it like he thinks this is something Tony hasn't considered, which is just fucking stupid. Of course Tony's considered it – and, frankly, he doubts Clint is even capable of considering anything Tony hasn't – but the fact is, he's not buying it. If the Soldier could stop himself from killing Steve, he could have stopped himself from killing Howard or Maria or any of his other victims. And, okay, there was clearly an emotional connection with Steve, Tony's not denying that that helped, but it only cuts him so much slack.
look and keeps working. After a decidedly sullen pause, JARVIS speaks again. "As you wish, Sir," he says, the lack of inflection making him sound more machine than person, a clear sign of how much he doesn't want to do what Tony's asked him to.
There's other things, too. The endless and sort of affectionate snark and bickering. How often Steve volunteered to be the one to take food to Tony. The way Steve's visits to the city increased in frequency a few months after Tony and Pepper separated. The fact that Steve didn't smile once while they were sight-seeing in Barcelona, despite Bruce once having witnessed he and Pepper spend three hours straight geeking out over the greatest architects of the twentieth century.
"Really, Tony?" Bruce sighs, every bit as dramatic and overacted as Tony's fake-drinking. "Steve Rogers. Tall, blond, basically sex-on-a-stick, according to people who swing that way. Any of this ringing a bell?"
“Steve,” he says, pressing closer, his own hands roaming, probably more than they should, but Tony can’t help it. Or, no, he can, he’s one hundred percent in control of his actions, but he doesn’t want to. Steve’s here, with him instead of Barnes, and maybe he only came here to say thank you but he’s done that and he’s still here.
doesn't really work when for months Steve has been calling him and getting JARVIS instead is only a tiny, tiny part of his decision).
Except JARVIS is still a person, Tony's person, and he won't take away his free will unless he can see absolutely no alternative. He's not sure what a situation like that would look like, but he does know that JARVIS wanting him to share a meal with Bruce and Clint is definitely not it.
“Okay,” Steve says, when Tony’s just about finished his first burger. “Bucky told me what happened with Thor this morning, and I think I owe you an apology.”
, Bruce realises, which more or less explains why his comment didn't serve as the conversation opener he wanted it to be. It doesn't explain
," Tony answers sharply. "Damnit, JARVIS, quit trying to make me talk to him. It's not fucking happening, okay?"
“Steve,” he murmurs, rocking them slightly, and then, for lack of anything better, repeats himself. “I’ve got you.”
It’s not a long elevator ride, but Tony fidgets his way through it, hoping hard that he’s going to beat Thor there; keeping the Tower in decent shape is already difficult enough, without adding in repairs from what happens when an alien deity accidentally startles a very twitchy supersoldier.
“Right? At least someone around here cares about my well-being.” Bruce’s eye twitches, just a little bit, but apparently that’s enough for Clint to decide he better get off that particular train of thought. “So, anyway,” he continues, pausing to lick doughnut guts off his fingers. “I was up on the roof last night, like, contemplating the meaning of life and whatever, and guess who shows up?”
Tony doesn't say anything, even if he doesn't actually expect Natasha to pick up (assuming this is actually her number, because there's no way she'd let Steve save anything under her actual name). It's good that he doesn't, because he so hates having to eat his words: the phone only rings three times before it's answered.
The asset doesn't have anything in the way of hope, but he asks anyway. Nothing he has remembered yet has ever surprised him as much as when Iron Man stands down instead of butchering him.
“Maybe not,” Barnes agrees, “But I am now. You fuck with Steve, it’ll be me that kills you, and I’ll be a hell of a lot less efficient about it than the Soldier was.”
He doesn’t know if Bucky remembers what was done to him and what he was made to do between ‘45 and 2014.
getting it over with quickly, but Tony, idiot that he is, follows Steve’s unspoken instruction to sit, then watches in faint confusion as Steve collects a plate of burger buns from the worktop, followed shortly by a plate of burgers, a bowl of fries, and a stack of cheese slices.
“Okay,” Tony agrees easily; given that he was expecting Steve to refuse, he’s not overly concerned by it, and, anyway, if Steve really wanted to do the touchy-feely thing he’d be talking to Sam rather than hitting stuff. “D’you want to fuck instead?”
These wings are like those dreams he used to have, where he was running flat out and then, at the point where he couldn't possibly go any faster, he'd jump and just- take flight. No propulsion, no engines, no tech, nothing keeping him up there, just him and the air. Those dreams became less frequent when he started flying for real, then vanished entirely when he left the Air Force, replaced by warped memory-nightmares that had him waking up in a cold sweat night after night after night.
There is precisely one thing she absolutely hates about her job, and that's trying to get her flighty nuisance of an ex to put his company first.
There’s something Steve’s missed here, something more than the story Nat told him in the hospital, but he decides then and there not to ask. Whatever it is is between them, and as long as it makes Bucky feel as comfortable as he seemed just then, Steve is entirely happy to let it stay that way.
“Steve…” Tony says, the word catching in his throat, because, sure, maybe he can see Steve being that good, if he really thinks about it, but not him. He’s not that selfless, and no one else alive has ever been naive enough to tell him he is. “You really need to lower your expectations of people, Cap.”
“Sure, breakfast sounds good,” Sam says. He’s not quite frowning, but Steve gets the impression he’s not far from it, either. “You’ll let me know if Steve needs backup, right, JARVIS?”
"What're you working on?" he asks, because a) it's often a lot easier to get Tony to act like a responsible adult if he distracts him by expressing an interest in his work first, and b) Bruce actually
Correction: he was holding a gun; before Tony can fire, the gun is scraping across the gravel on its way over to him, another three following in its wake.
thing later,” Sam answers, because there’s no way in hell that’s healthy. “But I’ll bite for now. How did a
No, Tony needs to be somewhere too public for Steve to make a scene, but not actually in the presence of the general public, which means he’s going to be making Pepper a very happy woman.
"Tell him I'm bringing his boy home," Tony says, stepping out of the suit but not powering it down just yet – sure, he's dumb enough to take off his armour, but he's not yet so stupid to be completely unarmed around an assassin (or not one who isn't confirmed friendly, anyway, and it says nothing good about Tony's life that the qualification has to be there).
There's the scratch of pen on paper, followed by the sound of Tony's footsteps as he rounds the bed; even against a carpet as thick as this one, Steve can still make out each step he takes. He pauses a moment at Steve's side of the bed, presumably so he can put whatever note he's scribbled on the bedside table, and then he's gone, the door snicking quietly closed behind him.
"Huh," Clint says eventually. "Guess that explains why Steve wasn't in a chatty mood before he left."
Even though he is here to threaten Stark with physical harm If he voluntarily hurts Steve, Barnes doesn’t know if he would follow through on it. And if Hydra or someone else gets their hands on him, if they try to force him to harm Steve against his will, if he doesn't have a
"You're welcome, Steve," Tony tells him, taking a moment to steel himself before adding, "Look, Steve, we need to talk."
"Always," Bruce answers, his hands clenching and relaxing, the veins in his neck pulsing green. This is usually a danger sign, their cue to get the hell out of the room and put it on lockdown, but right now danger is exactly what they need. Tony moves all the way to the left, Steve to the right – pulling Sam behind him so that he can cover both of them with the shield – and the cluster of Hydra agents waiting to greet them receive a sudden and not entirely friendly introduction to the Hulk.
he can do damage is just efficient, something Barnes is usually completely in favour of, but instead he finds himself understanding why Stark was so adamant in his refusal, even in the face of Barnes’ entirely logical arguments.
Natalia was a child, all of them were, and Barnes never did a thing to get them out of there. He never even thought of it.
"Huh," Clint says, heading back inside. He uses the dead guy's thumb to unlock his phone, then dials JARVIS, having forced the number to stick in his brain after one too many instances of regaining consciousness to find his phone smashed or missing. It rings twice, same as always, and then there's an empty, absolute silence, also same as always when JARVIS doesn't know the number that's calling him.
Despite Bucky’s conviction that he’ll be okay (or, rather, Natasha’s conviction and Bucky completely missing what Steve was worried about), Steve ends up pushing himself harder than he normally would on his run. Nothing hurts, but then it takes more than a marathon for Steve to start aching, and he’s pretty sure he’s just run his
Steve shifts his head back, far enough for his breath to ruffle Tony’s hair when he sighs. “Sam knows. About us, I mean.”
“Tired,” Clint answers, grimacing as he continuing the established pattern of uninformativeness. “Didn’t sleep much.”
“Hey,” Clint calls from the doorway, only then looking back over his shoulder. “You coming, Barnes?”
“Uh-huh,” Clint says again, even more doubtfully. Nathalie doesn't argue, nor does she say anything else; sooner or later, Clint will get to his point, and she can wait an awful lot longer than he can. Sure enough, only a few seconds later he sighs, and there’s a definite note of desperation when he continues. “Look, Tasha, I get why you needed to do your own thing after everything that went down with SHIELD, but we could do with you here. Tony found Barnes.”
"I went to see Tony last night," he says. "I think I was planning on talking to him about how he's doing, and about- about us, but, well…" Steve fidgets a little, his face heating, very much uncomfortable with discussing his sex life in such a public location.
“I’m not fucking ask you to,” Barnes as good as growls at him. “I love that fucking idiot with ever fibre of my being, but it hasn't ever been in that way. And, even if it was, I'm done with that shit. I barely sleep, I’m carrying more weapons than most people ever see in their lives and I still don't feel safe, and at least once a week I wind up hyperventilating over which pair of socks I should wear. There ain’t enough human left in here to want a relationship, let alone have one.”
His departure leaves a heavy sense of discomfort in the room, Tony too stunned first by the attack on himself and his parents and then by Clint's apology for him to find words.
"Nuh-uh," he says. "People who lock themselves away for days only get beer if they explain what's bothering them."
"Okay," he says after a moment. "I guess you're busy. There's food upstairs, whenever you're hungry."
(Because, fine, maybe Tony remembers it word for word, but it's not like being rejected before he's even asked someone out is an everyday occurrence, it's burned into his memory pretty damn well.)
Perhaps this is it, where they punish him for attempting to leave, and the asset will be stuck in here until the Avengers decide what they want to do to him.
Later, he’ll tell Steve that it’s only to be expected that Barnes might struggle with accepting his freedom, after everything he’s been through. He’ll tell Steve that Barnes will get better, with time and help, and he’ll suggest that Steve talks to Sam in the morning, maybe reaches out to people with more experience. He’ll encourage Steve to be patient, to have hope, even if Steve having hope for Barnes’ recovery must surely equate to having hope that his current relationship with Tony will end. He’ll take Steve up to the penthouse, help him out of his sweaty clothes and into a warm shower, then tuck them both into his bed and hold him until they both fall asleep.
, Bruce decides. Tony clearly doesn't want to talk right now, and pushing him is about the furthest thing from useful. He'll try again later.
Rather than replying, Sam looks between Steve's mug, his plate, and Steve himself. "Oh, man," he says, not unkindly, putting down his book. "Steve, what happened?"
"I know, Tony," Bruce agrees, his hands raised, palms facing outwards, and it's funny, isn't it, that his placating gesture is almost exactly the same as Tony's attacking one. Or, well, not funny, and probably not ironic, either. Just a coincidence. "It was pretty clear on the helicarrier that he's every bit as human as the rest of us. I'm just wondering if maybe he misunderstood something."
"No!" Tony snaps, then shakes his head, trying to take the angry edge off his words. "Thanks, J, but it's really not a good idea right now."
"I've asked," Bruce tells her, exasperated. "On the rare occasion he acknowledges he's not himself, he says he doesn't want to talk about it. The last time I saw him acting like this was when you broke up with him."
. Because Clint can be a tactless dick sometimes, but he's their tactless dick, and Tony was too wrapped up in his ugly, fucked-up grief-rage to think about who he was talking to or how personally Clint might take his anger.
“Let’s sit,” Natalia instructs, picking up both the mug from the counter next to her and the one Steve put down before she chased him out of there, then leading Barnes from the kitchen to a couch so soft Barnes still hesitates to sit on it.
face, don't think I don't know you all do that, and oh, fuck it, I'm just going to say it, okay. Didn't Bucky fall off a train? Into a ravine. In, what, '45, wasn't it?"
"Thanks, J," Tony says, then offers Barnes a smile that hopefully only looks a little bit uncertain. "So, you got a bag we can stick this stuff in? Only, I've got rules about the number of pointy things people can carry in my presence, and you're way over quota."
“Sorry, what?” Sam asks, sort of assuming the clack of the plates he’s just put away has made him mishear that. “He told you that?”
“That’s really not what I’m worrying about,” Steve answers, but he sighs, then sort of smiles. “Fine, I’ll go. Behave yourself.”
His stash down in the shop is starting to run low, now that he thinks about it; Tony leans over the bar – not the most dignified way of going about it, but the only one around to see him sprawled on his stomach with his legs in the air is JARVIS and he's seen a lot worse than that – to grab another bottle, then a second and third just for good measure. He pauses halfway between the bar and the elevator, then doubles back for the decanter and the stupid goddamn letter, folding it in half as many times as he can before jamming it into his back pocket.
"Okay," he says, giving up on finding anything useful. "Time to call this in. Can I offer you a lift somewhere? Maybe buy you a beer to say thanks?"
He follows willingly when Natasha suggests they have breakfast with the team, as does Bucky, though he does seem moderately baffled by what’s happening.
Bruce is still silent, though his expression is now more thoughtful than it is perturbed. Tony tops off his coffee again while he waits, because it's definitely not his turn to say anything more, and eventually Bruce seems to get his thoughts in order enough to speak up. "Something else happened in Spain, though, didn't it? You've been a lot more…
,” Stark says, in a voice that is the closest thing to a snarl Barnes has heard since he got here, and then closes his eyes. Pinching the bridge of his nose, he takes three exaggeratedly deep breaths before opening his eyes again and glaring at Barnes.
"Sir," JARVIS says as the last of the Mark 58 clicks into place around him. "May I ask what it is you're planning to do?"
Tony's getting dressed now, Steve can tell as much without opening his eyes. He can picture it just from what he can hear: the soft whisper of material as he pulls his shirt over his head; the zip of his fly and shthwap of leather as he fastens his belt; the faint thud of his hand against the desk as he leans against it to slide his shoes back on, one foot at a time. Steve helped him take off most of those clothes last night, touched just about every inch of the skin Tony's just covered up again, and it was good, it was
"If I may, Sir," JARVIS says, taking it upon himself to speak through Tony's external speaker as he answers Bruce's plea. "I have located a nearby hotel I believe ought to meet your specifications. I have also taken the liberty of inquiring as to whether they have space for you to park the quinjet, and gentleman with whom I spoke believes their roof should suffice."
“Tony.” Steve sighs, maybe at the dismissal, maybe at the name calling, Tony doesn’t much care which, because a sigh is a sigh is a sigh. Steve seems to realise that, too, because he doesn’t follow it up with the
The bed is empty when Tony wakes up, which isn’t exactly unusual. Now that he’s started up running again, Steve insists on going out first thing in the morning most days (and, as if that’s not already crazy enough, he chooses to do so outside, rather than in the state of the art gym Tony put a lot of effort into getting someone to design), so even when Tony goes to bed next to him he doesn’t normally wake up that way, and apparently Steve is stealthy enough to get up and get dressed without disturbing Tony.
"Right," Tony says as soon as the suit's away and he's locked himself safely back in his workshop, a very, very large glass of scotch in hand. "You and me are gonna have words, J."
Despite this cripplingly logical argument, Stark remains silent, shaking his head just slightly. Not enough to mean
“I like you, Tony,” Steve says, plain as day. “I like you a lot. A lot a lot, and I thought, if you wanted to, we could actually go out for dinner sometime?”
Other times it's the hummingbird, and even sketched in pencil it's all the colours of the rainbow, bright and brilliant, flitting from flower to flower, only when Steve draws the monkey offering up a bouquet the hummingbird just flies far, far away.
,” Natasha answers, only just remembering to keep her accent even as her carefully constructed persona slips away. She'd hoped by giving Stark the unredacted Winter Soldier file, he might understand enough to assign blame where it belongs. No part of her thinks it's fair to expect Tony to offer sanctuary to his parents’ murderer – even Steve wouldn't ask that of him, and Natasha has seen first hand just how far he would go for Bucky Barnes – but she'd thought maybe, given enough time to come to terms with it, Tony might be willing to leave Barnes in peace. “
Today, Stark Satellite Romeo-Echo-Charlie-Zero-November Prime is over New York, and JARVIS has a confirmed location for Sergeant Barnes, absolutely accurate and, JARVIS concludes with 97% certainty, it is a semi-permanent location, most probably a makeshift domicile. He no longer has an excuse not to report it.
"My apologies," JARVIS says, over the sound of the assembled Avengers exchanging greetings and questions about each other's well-being while they wait for the others to join the conversation. "I am having difficulty reaching Agent Romanov."
Steve’s beaming now, full and bright. “Dinner,” he confirms. “It’s a meal people eat in the evening, a bit like this one, only cooked by someone who knows what they’re doing. I know it’s not a concept you’re all that familiar with, though, so if it’s too much we can start with coffee, someplace other than your lab or with the team, maybe?”
Steve stares at him, all stoic and silent, so much so that Sam thinks he's probably not going to get an answer, certainly not anything that relates to the conversation they're having. It's hardly surprising, what with how disinclined Steve is to talk about anything remotely personal – given how hard Natasha's been trying to set Steve up with women, Sam's fairly sure he's the only person Steve's told about his relationship with Stark – but it's definitely not any better than the state Steve was in when Sam first came down to the gym.
from his bucket list (not that he'd known it was on there before now, but it's both one hell of an achievement and damn entertaining).
Natalia says Barnes won. He’s less sure, but apparently this is a non-optional twenty-first century tradition, so Barnes waits until Natalia has challenged Steve to a sparring match in the gym before taking the stairs down to Stark’s workshop.
"And you said…?" Bruce prompts after a moment, as if it's not absolutely fucking obviously what Tony's response to that was going to be.
"Everyone hates meetings, Tony. Unfortunately, they're a necessary evil, if you want to keep a business running, and you're just going to have to accept that."
Steve looks between the two of them, frowning, and then turns his attention to Barnes. “Is it okay with you if I go running, Buck?”
Sam walks in, his expression equal parts surprised and sort of befuddled, but he handles it with his usual grace. “You don’t ask much, do you, Barnes?” he says, raising an eyebrow at Steve, then turning towards the kitchen. “I’m gonna need a hell of a lot of coffee, if that’s what you need from me. You want?”
" Tony repeats, more incredulity than it is a question. "You got my AI gossiping about me now? Pretty sure there's supposed to be a cone of silence when it comes to stuff like that, buddy."
Eventually, Tony decides that waiting for him to show up in a communal space unaccompanied just isn’t going to happen; if he wants to talk to Barnes, Tony is going to have to go to his space.
"He does have the best toys," Steve agrees, mock-sighing, which distracts Tony from his impulse to protest that they're not on different teams, that they're still allies and sort of friends, even if they've stopped sleeping together and don't exactly agree. "I'm heartbroken, but I understand."
Bruce is at the table, unloading far more cartons of Chinese food than the three of them can eat in one sitting (assuming Bruce isn't planning on hulking out, at any rate), while Clint's ass is sticking out of the fridge.
"So, anyway, I woke up the morning after, and he'd- He'd made breakfast for us, coffee and pancakes," Tony pauses, remembering, and it's pretty much mortifying how fond he sounds as he continues. "Swear to god, they were some of the worst pancakes I've ever had, but he'd tried so hard, and I was about to ask him if he wanted to do dinner but before I could he got all
Tony’s tried the hopeful approach to relationships, the whole time he was with Pepper and then again when he thought he and Steve might work themselves out after that night in Barcelona. Hope doesn’t end well, and he doesn’t want to do it again.
It’s not like he doesn’t understand. If Tony felt like that about someone, lost them, and then got them back again, it would take a hell of a lot to pry him from their side. He’d be clinging, limpet like, for as long as they’d put up with it, probably far past that point, so it’d be goddamn hypocritical of him to complain about it.
“It’s not a cell, Buck,” says Steve, when the asset finds the right words to ask him. He sounds- sad, the asset thinks. Mournful, though the asset doesn’t know where the word comes from, or what frame of reference he’s drawing on to decide that it applies. “It’s your bedroom.”
"Right," he starts, pausing for a moment to take a gulp of his coffee, then pushes himself to actually goddamn say something, and where better to start than the beginning? "Okay, so, first of all, Steve and I weren't ever
The monkey is back, but it's done with dancing, instead marching its way across the backs of receipts, the blank spaces on newspapers, page after page of hotel stationery. There's a bear, sometimes, like the ones they made back in the war, only the one in Steve's pictures is old and worn, leaking stuffing from half a dozen places, one arm a mess of patches, and in most of the pictures it's hiding, little bits of bear poking out from behind trees or above the roofs of buildings. It's running, and stupid monkey-Steve has nothing but scraps of dropped Bucky-bear innards to chase after.
"Sir? You are in Avengers Tower, in your workshop. It is January 17th, 2014, and the time is 01:32," JARVIS is saying, when Tony resurfaces from the memories triggered by hearing about the surgery removing what remained of Barnes' arm (the worst part was that they'd actually
Abruptly, Steve is back in the moment before Tony kissed him, the second when he thought about stopping him, insisting on having a conversation. He probably still wouldn't be spending this morning with Tony if he'd had the willpower to insist on talking rather than sleeping together. They most likely would have ended up arguing within minutes, leaving nothing resolved and everything between them far worse than it was before, but Steve might not feel as awful as he does right now.
Clint ignores the bagels, instead taking a glittery purple monstrosity from the box of doughnuts. Sam was raised with some damn strict rules about food, including the fact that it shouldn’t ever sparkle (and it definitely shouldn’t be torn into pieces and dunked in coffee before it’s eaten), but he’s also far too sensible to argue with anyone as handy with a bow and arrow as Clint is, so that also goes on the
Steve hasn't called by the time Tony crosses into US air-space. He's had a text from Bruce asking where he is, then another few detailing his plans to spend the day sightseeing with Steve and Wilson. He's got yet another voicemail from Rhodey warning him that the Avengers really should start getting permission from heads of state before entering foreign countries on non-emergency missions. His inbox is full of the usual chaotic mix of emails from different SI departments, from scientists asking for a consult and from charitable foundations asking for donations or public declarations of support.
Nat, Bruce and Clint promptly point to three different cupboards, though there’s absolutely no prize for guessing which one of them is right; Steve gets eight plates out of Nat’s cupboard, figuring Sam is going to show up seeking food as soon as he gets back from his run, and since Nat has apparently decided she and Bucky are friends, Steve can take a plate down to Tony after they’re done eating.
She gives him a look, one that's all too familiar from his childhood, way back when Aunt Peggy would wheel out the
It’s just past nine o’clock when Nathalie Rousseau steps out of her front door, her high-heeled sandals tapping sharply against the concrete sidewalk. There’s an extra bounce in her perfect, dark brown curls, an extra sway in her walk, and an extra sharp switchblade tucked in her bra.
"What? No, I'm fine, just my ankle and a few cuts and bruises," Clint answers, waving off Bruce's concern with a dismissiveness only slightly resulting from his hatred of any kind of medical facilities. "This super angry hobo showed up and knocked them all out before they could do too much damage. I offered to buy him a beer, but I guess he wasn't thirsty."
, he thinks, which is obviously not the right answer. If he says that, Clint will tell Steve as soon as the conversation is over, which will end with Steve crying again (he thinks the asset doesn't know, and the asset doesn’t know how to respond to that other than to pretend), then running to wherever it is he runs when he's had enough of the asset. And, if that isn't bad enough, the asset will end up subjected to another one of Sam’s well-meaning conversations about identity.
She pops her gum as she walks, loud and obnoxious, attention grabbing, returning the smiles of people who smile at her, smiling even brighter at those who don’t. Either way, they’re looking at her, and Nathalie does like to be noticed.
"What?" Tony says, in the moment before he figures it out. "No, it's fine for you to ask, but Rhodey's not as big on going AWOL as you are." A muted gasp comes through the phone line, and Tony realises his foot is still in his mouth. "Shit, no, I didn't mean us, Steve. I just meant, you go where you have to, but Rhodey will insist on talking to the higher-ups, and they're not going to give him permission, and- Look, I'm on my way back to the city, but if you call the Tower and let Clint and Bruce know what we're in for, they can have the jet ready to go as soon as I get there."
