Tony watched him carefully, his heart feeling heavy when he noticed the distress in Steve’s voice, and let go of his hand, pulling him close to a tight hug instead.
“So, you’re the new suit huh? I wonder why Tony wanted me to look at you...” He said in a somewhat confused tone.
With his own helmet pulled back, Tony looked at him, always loving the sight of him with his messy, cowl hair and red cheeks. “Any time, Winghead, just say the word. So, did you find whatever you were looking for?”
Steve's felt dizzy, his mind felt uncoordinated, and he let his hand slide down Tony’s neck and across his shoulders. “I... I’m unsure...” he murmured as he hunched his shoulders a little, his meekness returning without Tony's mouth for distraction.
“Don’t try washing your hands from this blood, Captain. And I’ll be looking forward to our meeting soon enough.”
Steve’s eyes widened and he touched his lips with his own wet fingertips, eyes darting down in thought at how beautiful it felt. When their lips touched he could feel softness, a gentle innocence from the man who others saw as cruel. It felt indescribably sweet.
Steve patted the horses lightly, hearing them make a happy neighing sound as he jumped into the chariot. “They were gifts when I was younger,” Steve answered. “They’re quite old but they are the closest I’ve had to friends, without my mother intervening.”
And yet, Tony was proud for finally getting some acknowledgement from his father, who seemed pleased with how Tony was preparing their people.
Steve wasn’t sure how many days have passed since Tony and the rest of the Avengers managed to rescue him from that dark lab. His thoughts were untouched, he could still think in proper human words, but every time that he tried to say something, a howl or disoriented barking sounds would come out of his mouth. It was frustrating, to say the least, but at least he could use his body language to communicate with them.
“You know, sometimes I wish for that day to come sooner," Tony said with a hint of sadness in his voice, following Steve. His eyes widened as he saw all the weapons and armour, and he stood by Steve's side to admire the shield before him. “Is that, can I..?”
“Yes, but he can’t hear us, at least not now.”, Reed nodded.
It was raining.
“I honestly don’t know how to respond to that, thank you, Steve... I’m really glad that it’s you. For the project, I mean, we couldn't honestly get someone better for it, you are..perfect”
“Merry Christmas, Winghead...”
Steve shuffled back nervously at the touch, turning his head away from the Tony.
Tony looked at the hand on him and then at Steve, swallowing down. Why did he get the same tingling sensation that he did back when he first met Steve? It was strange, why now, why at that very moment?
“Oh shut up, will ya?”, Tony’s voice was heard from the door, holding what it seemed to look like a gun and shooting an energy beam towards the scientists. Zola shrieked, his controller falling on the ground and starting to scream orders to the armed soldiers.
Steve gently nudged Tony off him and moved, leaning over Tony the way Tony had done for him, to kiss him deeply, tangling their tongues together whilst his hands trailed down Tony’s body, hands gliding over the medallion and touching the dark haired man’s skin.
“Do you want a bath as well?” he asked after a while.
“That’s not even one of my code names, get it right!”, Steve said as he held his trusty shield close to his chest, calculating each and every move. As soon as they started to close in, he threw his shield, and before they could even realise what happened, the vibranium disk made a complete turn, knocking most of them out almost instantly, before returning into Steve’s hand.
Steve gently pulled back from Tony’s lips and looked at him as he spoke. “My life is short now, Tony,” he said. “Perhaps our meeting was only meant to be fleeting.”
“I’m here, I’m here with you don't worry," Tony kept repeating, knowing Steve needed the reassurance more than anything. He starting to scissor his way inside him, slowly at first but then settling with a nice pace, and he could feel Steve’s every movement under him - the way his muscles would tense, how his back would ache, feeling Steve's stomach concave where he was holding him. “Tell me when you’re ready.”
“Tony, it’s me, Steve… Calm down…”, the voice replied again, and this time the large man knelt down, the light coming through the corridor window making it clear that the person there was indeed Steve Rogers. His blue eyes were tired but filled with concern nevertheless. He was still wearing his uniform and had a bag on his back, most likely having just returned.
Despite all, Steve was indeed back. He came back from the land of the dead, but more technically, he had never been there. Tony and the team was trying so hard to defend their name, and to see rising Norman Osborn rising in power just before his eyes, claiming his and Steve’s titles, stealing his own team and ethics sure was a low blow. It seemed fine until he was forced to follow a protocol that he had been planning for a while now; to wipe off his memories so the identities of his friends wouldn’t be known to their enemies. It was the least he could do after the war he caused, and the ultimate solution, it had to be that way. Waking up after his ‘memory wipe’ and realising how much he actually forgot was a shock to him, especially when he found out exactly what he did during the war. He could see why, but the fact that everything got so far and so scary in such a little amount of time.. that was still terrifying to him. It took him a long time to piece everything together and to realise why Steve seemed to be distant, which lead him to have more heated arguments with him, trying to both apologise and defend himself. Steve remembered everything in detail when Tony was struggling to remember the looks, the words they exchanged, but he knew that he sought one thing; Steve’s forgiveness. He confessed to him that he couldn’t unsee his mistakes, that he was at his best when he was beside him, and Steve embraced him.
Tony but his lip, trying to think of what he actually wanted to say. “I don’t think that friends do what we’re doing right now.” Steve frowned but Tony shook his head. “No, misunderstand me, we are friends. But it seemed that right now we want something more? I don’t want to be just another friend of yours. I want to be someone to you.”
Maybe there was still hope to fix things up, and that’s when he started to see Steve again, have friendly conversations with, spend time together now that Steve wasn’t Cap anymore; Bucky still took over, and despite his protests, Steve insisted. Part of Tony could never see anyone as a replacement of his Captain, even though he learnt to work with Bucky well.
The bearded man shook his finger at him. “This is StarkTower. One of the first, and the most reliable one too. Runs on absolutely 100% clean energy, this was a small project of mine.. One of my goals is for every household to run on clean, renewable energy, just like this Tower.. until the end of this year. Starting from New York, of course, them move along. Oh, the Tower.. Countless floors, hundreds of rooms and facilities.. should be good for you to settle down in there, catch up.. all that”
“I want to show you something.”, he said as he helped Tony stand up from the floor.
“You have to trust me, I’m going to do something.. ambiguously stupid.”
Tony seemed as though he was keen to protect Steve's people, which Steve loved, and the man was determined, smart and charismatic, all magnetising qualities that drew Steve closer and closer each time he spoke.
Before he knew it, he was back at the facility; when the large doors were opened, all eyes were focused on him. His hands resting on his legs clenched into fists, taking a deep breath before relaxing and wheeling himself deeper inside.
It felt that time stopped, the only thing that mattered was the emotions and feeling he was pouring into that soft, gentle kiss. He could still taste the raspberry jam from the donut, but besides that, Tony tasted so refreshing, his rosy lips not parting away with his own until moments later. Tony was looking at him, eyelashes battering and cheeks slightly redder, and my God, was he just stunning. There was only one word to describe how he was feeling at that very moment, but he wasn’t sure if he dared to say it loud, until Tony did.
Steve blinked; the need for companionship was there, the choice between going home alone and spending the night with someone who seemed to understand him and show interest in him didn’t make it hard for him to decide. He nodded as he approached Tony, his arms stretching so he could fit him into his embrace.
“I had come to prevent such actions. Though one only gets respect that one earns. I had come to teach, to offer assistance to prevent war, though war seems to be the only way that you can prove your masculinity, as opposed to power. Knowledge is power, not strength, and yet you seem adamant to prove that it is the other way around. Not only that but you class my words as beautiful. That, to me, shows some form of admiration. Am I wrong, Spartan? Do you not admire the way Athenians speak? Do you not wish to possess such a way with words yourself? Can it not be strength, another weapon in your arsenal that you wish to possess?”
A couple of days later, Tony was staying in the Avengers Tower, exploring, trying to learn as much as he could about his counterpart. Not only he found out that Thor, Clint, Natasha and Bruce were so different from his friends back home, but he learnt that the Avengers were a much bigger team here than the one they had back home, it almost felt like a huge family. The Avengers, however, seemed to be wary of him, only one of them, a young superhero named Peter Parker seemed to be more willing and accepting, actually sitting down and chatting with him, listening to what he had to say.
Steve managed to sneak in the Tower and he silently took out a good number of guards, retrieving his shield from the room he had been using, but just like he expected, more guards were there to greet him as soon as he got into the main hall to step into the elevator.
Tony smiled at them both, but the smile was nothing close to being real. “See? Geez, capsicle, just relax”
The walls were painted in a beige colour, the wooden furniture blending just in, especially the large, king sized bed with red duvets. The new means of technology that were prominent in the rest of the building were present in the bedroom, like a big TV screen on the wall and a monitor on the mahogany desk.
“I'm… great…!”, Tony smiled, and he wondered why he even bothered reacting that way when his fear was so visible on the way he reacted to this shocking revelation.
And without a warning, he looped closer and kissed Steve’s cheek before waving at him and flying out of the window.
“Some values are worth keeping around”, the billionaire replied with a huff. “Now..this way”, he said, walking ahead and stopping by a door near the end of the corridor. The big room was decorated in a style that Steve honestly didn’t expect from the other man. He didn’t find it impossible for Tony to have arranged for the room to be changed in that way while they were flying back to make the adjustment easier for Steve.
He decided to take a taxi there instead; it wasn’t that he felt uncomfortable with people staring at him, but he wasn’t quite ready to walk around with those heavy looking “boots”.
Tony opened his eyes, blinking a couple of times, adjusting to the light. He looked up to Steve and smiled lazily, hugging him closer. “First day of teaching, huh?” he asked.
Steve caught a glimpse of Tony’s back, his eyes following the scars that crossed Tony's skin, probably old wounds, acquired at a young age by the colour of them. “I do not wish to be a burden.”
Steve nodded. “But if they see you with me they are most likely to become uneasy.”
“Yep, let’s try it”
He didn’t even blink when he felt the large, wet tongue against his cheek, Steve’s way of kissing him now, careful not to leave any slober on him. He smiled; he was cute, he would give him that, cute to see how much of an effort Steve was putting into still being that same boyfriend.
Steve waking up covered in sweat, his palm placed on his chest, panting for air wasn’t an unusual sight for Tony.
Tony slept soundly next to the man, drawing comfort from the warm body beside him. It was strange how right it felt, how the man seemed to fit right there, next to him, despite their first meeting.
“Oh?”, Steve asked, raising an eyebrow. “You love spending time with me, huh?”
Loving him wasn’t easy,no. It felt so hard, so difficult, yet there he was, constantly after him, despite how it hurt sometimes. Tony Stark was a needy man who required full attention, and even if he didn’t bluntly ask for it, he expected the other man to give it to him, his full attention and affection.
“Maybe,” Tony said, breathing against Steve's chest. “But no, I mean, you completely stunned me. And you made me try to be more, just for you.”
“We have the real deal right in front us, Tony, if there’s anyway to make that serum and inject it into-”
“A responsible one”, the other replied firmly. “Mr. Stark, I’ll expect to see you tomorrow morning, I have a couple of messages for you from Nick”, he added after a small pause, standing up and wearing his hat once again, lowering it so it covered his eyes.
“I don’t?” Tony replied, returning the glare. “Why is that? People have given that title to both of us, you know.”
“Do not compare me to your people,” Steve growled, digging the heels of his palms into Tony’s shoulders.
Steve shook his head.
“No, Tony, you don’t know what they are about”, he finally said.
Sighing and trying to push that out of the way, he opened the closet that Tony talked about, taking a clean towel and a pair of trousers who seemed that would fit him, getting rid of the clothes that the other man handed to him what it seemed ages ago in that tent, getting inside the shower. He looked at the shower head and then down to the buttons with the indication for the hot and cold water, pressing the button with the red circle on it and jumping away when boiling water sprayed him, making sure to let his body adjust to the temperature before moving under the steaming water. It felt so refreshing and he let out a soft huff of relief straight away, shutting his eyes and just letting the warmth take over him. Back in the day, he couldn’t really afford having a hot, steamy shower like that, not in the battlefield or when he was even back to his small Brooklyn apartment, so this felt so endearing, and for a moment there, he forgot where he was or what was even happening.
“I wouldn’t say it was without cause”, Tony said, one eyebrow rose. “I challenged you, didn’t I? You used your shield to defend yourself, that wasn’t fighting. If you weren’t an Athenian, you would be praised for shedding that blood, it would have been a sign of victory.”
“I wouldn’t.. after all, he was just a friend, you had something more..”
If he'd only managed to express his thoughts in a different way than the one he'd always known, maybe Steve would be there still, discussing all kinds of things while eating their black broth, Tony laughing as the Athenian grimaced at the smell.
“Did you consider that attempt failed?” Tony said as he followed Steve closely. “After all, you made me come up and talk to you here, it’s hardly a failure.”
Tony had been a little stiff up until that point but it’s like Steve’s words unlock something in him and he melts, arms coming up to wrap around Steve’s neck as he sags into Steve’s grip. “This is nice,” he mumbles, words muffled by the fabric of Steve’s shirt. “Little uncomfortable, pretty sure the gearshift is digging into my hip, but … thank you.”
“Tony,” Steve interrupts, placing his finger on Tony’s lips to shush him. The simple, innocuous touch sends a small thrill shooting through him, sparks dancing up his spine. He cand do this, he’s
Beside him, Tony has fallen out of his chair, laughing so hard he can barely breathe. Steve glowers at him as he sinks lower in his seat so that no one realizes they’re there. They haven’t been noticed for the whole show, but with his luck, someone would now.
“You wanna stick around for dinner?” he asks without thinking about it, glancing out the dark window because he isn’t sure he’ll be able to bear it if he looks at Tony and sees the same pitying expression on his face that he so often sees when he asks people out.
“I don’t mind,” Steve says truthfully. Everyone else on this ship seems to dance around his non-cybernetic enhancements—and around the fact that he’d been frozen in the ice caps, now stretching as far south as Florida, for three hundred years—but Tony never once seemed to care. He’s thrilled about Steve’s enhancements—no one else on the ship is quite as strong as Steve is, not since Thor joined the crew of the
“How about we don’t?” Steve says, pulling away from their hug much too soon. Tony grumbles wordlessly.
“Wanda,” Tony says, frown deepening. Something was wrong; something was wrong, and Steve couldn't manage to force himself to turn around to look, even though he was straining to move. “And Vision. They’re—they look—”
Tony was dead on his feet by the time he dragged himself through the front door, though he had no idea what he’d done that day. He must have accomplished
“I did my best to put you and Barnes in the ground. I think I share at least a little bit of the blame.”
“And I told you I wasn’t ready. You
“If you say so,” Steve said doubtfully. Tony rolled his eyes and walked away, heading for the garage.
Hugging Tony is … an experience, there’s no better way to put it. He smells nice, like magic and cinnamon rolls, and he’s warm and he fits just about perfectly into Steve’s arms. He wants to have this all the time, even though he knows Tony deserves better than someone who’s still trying to figure himself out, who took almost thirty years to figure out he’s gay.
Pierce gave him an indulgent look. “Sure, Tony, my boy. I’ll think about it if you find me another sponsor.” Steve could tell just from the look that he was lying. Tony knew it too, judging by the way he tensed.
Tony’s seatbelt isn’t even buckled but Steve obediently pulls out onto the road. He glances over a second later to see that Tony is already reaching for the seatbelt so, reassured, he turns his attention back to the empty road.
He changed into a pair of soft flannel pajamas as well, big enough that he was pretty sure they were Steve’s. Dummy was lounging on his pillow, blinking at him slowly. He eyed her, half wishing he could be a cat so the only things he had to worry about were eating and sleeping. But then again, if he were a cat, he wouldn’t have Steve, and Steve was the best thing to ever happen to him, so maybe it was a good thing he wasn’t a cat.
“See?” Tony says. “I need someone who can muscle that open for me.”
Tony’s nose scrunched adorably, but he slowly blinked his eyes open. “Good morning, darling.”
at him, terrified and disgusted and—
Tony’s eyes are starting to widen again, breath coming a little shallower, and that’s exactly what Steve doesn’t want, so he reaches across the counter and takes Tony’s hands in his. “It’s okay,” he says soothingly. “I already talked to Carol. If we run out, she’ll bring some platters.”
Tony went back upstairs eventually since Steve was clearly to busy and his costume was really uncomfortable. He hadn’t exactly chosen his softest lingerie for it. He took off the devil wings he was wearing and fold them away for another day. Maybe Steve would want to roleplay one of these days. Tony wasn’t sure what they could pull off with devil wings, but he was sure they could figure something out.
“The Registration Act,” Tony begins once they’re settled around the fire pit in the sunken living room, “is a compromise the same way…” He stops, clearly searching for an example. “Well, it’s not really a compromise at all. It’s a list, a list of every superhero that signed the Accords, what their powers and abilities are, and what their secret identity is, if they have one, so that they can be tracked, which obviously can still be abused by anyone smart enough to read between the lines.”
“Yeah, you too,” Bucky says. “You get into any trouble while I was gone?”
“That’s not a sample, just like everything else you’ve ‘sampled’ today,” Tony snaps. “I still have to sell all of this.”
Steve hums. “Well, the best part is, we never have to talk about it again because we’re officially open. Congratulations, Tony.”
Bucky looks first at Sam and then at Steve. There’s a calculating light in his eyes, one that Steve recognizes from when they were young and Bucky was trying to figure out the best way to get Steve to come along on a double date.
it a game, but Steve had always thought it to be more like training, since the object was to see who could successfully sneak up on Clint or Nat. He’s forgotten about that, over the last year and a half forgotten how much fun the original team had had with each other. He’d been so focused on the new team back then that he’d forgotten how much he had loved the old one.
Tony follows his gaze to the license and, to Steve’s surprise, laughs. It’s the first time he’s heard Tony laugh, and wow, but he thinks he could hear that every day and never grow tired of it. “Well, looks like I’ll be making all the creative decisions around here then, huh?”
“Not now, just—please, Steve. Come with me on the drive. I need to—please.”
“Sorry for asking,” he bit out. “Just thought maybe you weren’t feeling well. You’re not usually late.”
But he doesn’t know why else Steve would like to spend time down here.
Tony gasps dramatically. “You
and secondly, neither of them would ever do that to Aunt Peggy), but there’s something about him that keeps drawing Tony back.
Steve is nearly to the door before something else occurs to him. “Tony, who did you want to give the list of superheroes to? You said you didn’t trust it with the UN, but you must have trusted it with someone.”
Tony’s look of innocence can better be described as the cat who got the cream, the canary, and the whole tin of tuna. “Well, maybe someone pointed her in the right direction, but it clearly wasn’t me. I’ve been here for the last four days since the committee session broke. Anyway, King Kitty Cat has been calling for Ross’ arrest since Shuri made his files public. Looks like he put enough pressure on the committee to agree.”
“Worth a try though, right?”
“You know how everyone has that monster of an ex who uses people and leaves them for dead and then you end up dating for three months, four if you count the month he was seeing other people because ‘You can’t expect me to keep my love confined to one person, Tony.’”
“This happens all the time, Janet. You have to admit—"
And Steve agrees, but he doesn’t know if Bucky is ready to see anyone. Still, they shelve the discussion while he sends Shuri a message and waits for her reply. It takes two days for her to respond; Bucky evidently had asked for time to decide. But she does eventually reply, giving him an affirmative answer.
“Well, I’m honored,” Betty said. “So, what do you two have to ask me?”
“Thanks,” Steve says dryly.
“Made-up!”
There are a little under forty-five thousand Steve Rogerses currently alive in the United States (apparently a lot of them were born right after Captain America crashed into the ice and have since passed away), and thirty year-old Tony has crossed off all the ones that live in this country.
“Yeah, yeah.” He pulls his phone out to see a series of texts from his publicist. He groans as soon as he reads the first one. “Someone in the cast must have seen us. We’ve been asked to go backstage.”
She catches sight of Maria and smiles softly at her, carefully motioning her in with a wiggle of her fingers. Maria tiptoes in as quietly as she can, praying that she won’t wake her son. Tony sleeps so rarely. She’s never once gotten him to sleep through the night, and if Ana is managing it through a—a bedtime story, she thinks, though not one that she’s ever heard before, then she doesn’t want to disturb her. She settles down on the rocking chair in the corner, waving Ana off when she starts to hold Tony out to her. Tony looks half-asleep already, sleepily blinking, eyes taking longer and longer to open each time; she doesn’t want to wake him up again by trading him amongst them.
“I’m sorry, we’re not taking questions about past team members at this time,” Tony says, clearly annoyed by the interruption. “Any questions about
“Came to see me after he got turned away, complaining about some uppity jerk. Figured he meant you.”
Besides, even if winter didn’t do
“Of course not!” Steve says immediately, appalled by the suggestion. “They wanted to rejoin their families, I don’t fault them for that.”
Steve: And if you do sit down with them and talk it out, but they’re still getting mad at you, then it’s time to get out of there.
Tony frowns. “Why can’t you do it?”
The rest of the crew doesn’t know that they’ve been seeing each other for a month. After their first kiss, Steve had asked if it would be okay to keep it quiet a little longer. Steve’s brain is still firmly convinced at times that they’re in the forties, so the idea that he can date a man and have it be as accepted as dating a woman is still a little foreign to him. Tony had been more than accommodating though, which is only one of the reasons Steve loves him so much.
He’s still disappointed.
“Seriously? What did you think those invitations for dinner were if not dates? Do you honestly think I’d let just anyone stay the night? I don’t even let Pepper stay over and I’ve known her as long as I’ve known you. I—Steve, the very first night we did this, I told you I wanted to try again.”
“I was confused so I was hiding and I’m sorry about that. And, as for the clothes—” He turns that pretty shade of pink again. “—I wasn’t looking because I maybe wanted to look a little too much.”
“Yeah, I really gotta hand it to you. I had no idea you had so many family or friends.”
“I was just calling to maybe talk about my business plan a little more?” Tony continues. “If you’re free, which obviously you aren’t, or else you would have picked up. So feel free to call me back when you get the chance and I can walk you through it. Au revoir.” And then, right before Tony hangs up, he mutters, “Au revoir. That’s something I just said to that person.”
Steve lets that sink in before smiling softly and bumping shoulders with Tony. “That’s really sweet of you.”
“Yep,” Steve agrees shamelessly, leaning up to give him another kiss.
was, but for the most part, Ross designed it that way. He told me that he was communicating with you, and like an idiot, I believed him. He wanted to tear us apart, wanted to force you into a criminal life so he could hunt you down and—and take the serum. I didn’t see it at the time, but I do now. I’m trying to get him ousted.”
By the time Tony gets back, Steve’s already burrowed beneath the covers, Dummy sleeping on the pillow next to his face, which is definitely nerve-wracking. That cat still hasn’t warmed up to him. He’s not sure it won’t try to claw his face off in the middle of the night. Steve perks up when Tony walks in though. Dummy always behaves for Tony.
weird.” Not weird enough to keep thinking about it though. Probably one of the older kids had figured out a contraption to steal everything. “How about a movie?”
“Okay.”
“Okay,” he says quietly. “I won’t make you go.”
“We’ve been working on that,” Tony says. “The new guidelines put in place mean that we won’t just be sued when a building gets destroyed. We’ll have to help with cleanup, maybe shoulder a little bit of the financial burden—which, hey, we were doing all along—get people’s permissions when we want to go into a country, but we’re not going to be ganged up on for what’s really the fault of whoever we’re fighting that day.”
“It’s not that I didn’t trust him. Well, maybe a part of it was because of that. Tony feels a lot of guilt cause of what he’s done, and every time he messes up, he tries to find someone who can steer him back in the right direction. And when we couldn’t be that someone anymore, he went and found someone who could. Unfortunately for all of us, that happened to be an organization you and I couldn’t trust, so it was hard to trust
“He is?” he asks, hoping that maybe he just heard JARVIS wrong.
As he pulled away, he murmured into Steve’s ear, “Was that Tony I saw pulling away from here?”
“Really?”
Tony sighed and said quietly, “Sure. Have a nice night, Steve.”
Tony lowers his sunglasses to give the reporter such a quelling glare that Steve is surprised the man doesn’t hide. He would have if he’d been glared at like that. “Next,” Tony bites out, “question.”
DUM-E lets out a loud series of stressed-out beeps, and Tony sighs, cupping his cheek in his hand.
But he sounds very forlorn as they watch the jet take off and no one is surprised when Natasha offers him a hug before they both return inside. Steve stays longer than anyone else does, long after the jet has disappeared into the clear blue sky, long after Sam comes back out and asks him if he’ll be joining them for dinner. He doesn’t remember what he says to Sam, just that Sam disappears for a while and when Steve next looks down, there’s a plate on the railing beside his elbow.
thing? I like to cuddle. You wanna cuddle, that’s fine by me, Tony. It gets cold at this time of year. There’s nothin’ wrong with wantin’ to hold someone.”
Days pass without word from Tony, though Steve leaves him several messages on the flip phone. He’s worried, of course he is, but he also understands that he really angered Tony with his words in Wakanda. He can back off if that’s what Tony needs from him right now.
When asked later, Steve will say that the night passes in a blur. There’s Tony’s hand in his and there’s winning Tony that bear at the balloon dart game (Steve has always had near perfect aim and it plays to his favor now) and there’s Tony’s warmth pressed up against his side on the ferris wheel and it’s all wonderful. By the time they’re driving home late that night, Steve is hard-pressed to remember a more perfect night.
“Oh, you know, the usual: bumps in the night, scratching sounds at the window, that sort of noise.”
like this—is a good idea.”
And Steve does. He doesn’t get the chance to see Tony again before he’s left the country, but Tony’s stinging accusations don’t leave his mind. It’s hard for them to when he knows that preparations for Thanos’ war are going on without him and it’s his fault. T’Challa keeps him looped in on the preparations, so that he knows what plans are being made (he suspects it’s so that Steve doesn’t have to play catchup in the event that he decides to sign before the war arrives), but he’s limited on the suggestions he can make.
The wall reached their backyard.
Caller: Make them realize that I’m not the bad guy in this situation!
When he’s sure Luis is good with dinner, he heads into his bedroom, closing the door behind him. “Okay, what’s going on?” he asks.
“Mrs. Maximoff,” Tony began soothingly, only for Dottie to scoff.
“It’s always been popular,” Tony argued.
“Move, Rogers,” Brock Rumlow, one of the sound technicians, snapped, abruptly shaking him out of his thoughts. “Some of us have work to do.”
He turned back to the stove and accidentally brushed a glass bowl off the counter as he did. They both jumped back as the bowl shattered into a million shining pieces as it hit the floor. Tony stared at it for a moment—he’d never known Steve to be so clumsy before—then turned to Steve, opening his mouth to babble out something about grabbing the broom. But Steve just blinked at the glass and continued stirring the mashed potatoes on the stove.
“Pepper, we’re going to Europe.”
“So,” he begins awkwardly.
“Oh yeah?”
There’s a skeptical look in his husband’s eyes, but he doesn’t ask if Steve is sure, which he appreciates.
“You said you wanted to keep the team together.”
The sliver of ice finally melts completely, leaving a wet trail smeared across Tony’s nipple. Steve looks at it for a moment, thinking about if he wants to grab another cube. Before he can decide though, Tony steps out of his arms, takes Steve’s free hand in one of his own, and leads him down the hall to their bedroom.
Looking back on it, Steve honestly doesn’t know how he got through the evening. Luis is out for the night at a conference in Elm Grove, small favors really. He’s pretty sure he manages to cook dinner and he’s also pretty sure that they watch a sci-fi movie after dinner, but he couldn’t have said what it was about. Dummy had, of course, come with Tony. The cat spends most of the evening wandering around the living area,
Ana Jarvis is standing in the middle of the room, holding Tony in her arms. She bounces the boy up and down a little bit, pressing his head against her shoulder, as she murmurs, “The table were set beautifully. Great food was piled up high. ‘But wait—no one is eating!’ The rabbi wondered, ‘Why?’”
“They sure don’t sound peachy.” Tony doesn’t say anything to that, so Steve gently takes his elbow and steers him over to the couch, pushing him down onto the cushions when Tony just blinks at them. “Why don’t you tell me what’s going on?”
Tony stills, his back to Steve as he finishes putting the last of the Bruise Removal Serum on the shelf. “Not really,” he says, just as softly.
The scent of roses abruptly disappears and Steve realizes he’s standing a lot closer to Janet than he’d like to be. He backs up, nearly running into the counter. Something hisses behind him and he jumps.
Tony. Well that won’t do. He wiggles again, undulating his body in a way that’s guaranteed to get Steve’s attention. Steve glances at him before turning even pinker and turning around entirely.
“You sure?”
He ducks underneath one of the pipes and rounds a corner to find Tony sitting on a bench, carefully chipping at a speck of stardust on the benchtop in front of him. Tony once told him that it only takes a miniscule amount of stardust to power the ship for an entire week, which is good because stardust is difficult to mine. Tony’s goggles are perched on top of his nose, giving him an owlish appearance. Steve finds it adorable, but he waits until Tony is done with the chisel before walking over to drop a kiss on top of his hair.
Steve finds his words, blurting out, “Fuck, I hired a minor.”
Then with her brother gone and few of her friends the nurturing type, she’d never thought about children there either. Certainly she’d never thought that Howard would be the type to have children. And if she’s being honest with herself, she doesn’t think that Howard really thinks of Tony as a child, more as an eventual heir to his growing empire. She still thinks of that cover of
It’s the sort of unexpected genius that Tony is so good at. Steve doesn’t know that he would have ever thought about making sure that the UN couldn’t get that list. He would have been—and had been—so focused on stopping the Accords from happening at all that he would have forgotten about other ways to get around the system.
caught Steve’s attention. “What?” he asked, looking up from the stove. Tony moved aside so he could see the calendar, which read
love this person and you want to be with them. So now it’s time to ask yourself what does being with them look like? Does it mean you quit your job and move with them? Does it mean that they turn down their job offer and stay with you? Or what about a long-distance relationship?”
Steve imagines what it must have been like for Tony to be both so much younger and so much smarter than everyone else around him. He decides that yeah, Tony probably knows exactly what it’s like for Steve.
Tony’s smile faded, and he looked Steve straight in the eye. “Steve, I’m not that much of a glutton for punishment—”
It’s not even the glowing…thing (Luis hadn’t been sure what it is) that’s spilling soft light from under Stark’s shirt, or the sheer amount of
“I’ve heard from Thor,” Tony says without preamble.
“Well, thank you for your condescension.”
“I’ve never done that before,” he admits. “With a guy, I mean. And I was really getting scared I would let you leave without kissing you. I really didn’t want to let that happen.”
“Tony, we talked about this,” Steve says in a choked voice. Tony rolls over onto his back, cocking his head to the side as he looks at Steve, whose face is a very pretty shade of pink as he looks at everything
His strength gave out on him and he collapsed, managing to roll to the side at the last minute. Tony cuddled up beside him, sticky and warm. Steve panted, trying to get his breath back as he came down from his peak.
Steve thought about that for a second. “Yep.”
“What do you mean? We analyze data.”
Captain America’s eyes narrow. “Why?”
“You know I don’t have control over it. So I see a cute guy and I want him to think I’m cute too! Is that a crime now?”
“Mr. Rogers?” a high-pitched voice said from outside. It was definitely one of those kids. “Are you passing out candy this year?”
Square S4: Handle with Care
“And what about when they decide the damage was avoidable or that we did too much?”
“Exactly! I—” Tony stopped and looked over at Steve. He looked tired, Steve thought. “You want to go get a drink?”
Steve nods and heads for the kitchen when the elevator opens. “Thanks, JARVIS.” He keeps some chicken noodle soup frozen in the freezer for times like this, and it’s the work of a few minutes to heat it up and get it settled on a tray with another Gatorade bottle and a glass of water.
Tony bursts into laughter again. “And what are you going to say to them?”
The rumors didn’t go away over the following week. If anything, they just kept getting stronger and more specific. Steve was getting more and more worried that Pierce really was planning on cancelling their show, but every time either he or Tony had tried to corner him to ask about it, Pierce had brushed them off. It was unprofessional and rude and frustrating. Steve had done what he could to manage his frustration, including trying some meditation Youtube channel Bucky had recommended for him and going out to the bar on Saturday to find someone who could fuck the anger out of him (he’d found a very nice bear who’d done an admirable job of leaving him drooling), but it didn’t work. It only took a few pointed comments from Rumlow on Monday morning for his anger to reach a boiling point by the time their showtime rolled around that evening.
“…Other people.”
“Wanda would probably like nothing more than to be able to go home. I know her visits with Vision have been draining. She’s tired of having to keep them secret.”
“Yes, but who do we send it to?”
in person.”
There’s a very long line outside the store when he gets in the next day with his and Tony’s coffees. Tony himself is standing just behind the counter, frozenly staring at the line of eager people. Steve lets himself in, ignoring the people yelling behind him that he can’t just cut the line and that he needs to wait like everyone else. He’s not sure how they missed seeing him unlock the door, but he’s got bigger problems on his hands than them not realizing he’s an employee, like Tony’s impending panic attack.
“That’s a dumb rule,” Tony grumbles, but he’s already putting down his box of Invigoration Draughts and heading for the door. In Tony’s defense, Steve almost never enforces that rule. He doesn’t mind bringing coffee for Tony in the morning and usually, he can talk Tony into going out for lunch with him so they never have to worry about who’s going to make the meal run. But right now he wants to talk to Natasha and that means he needs Tony gone. “Tuna melt for Steve, cheeseburger for me, and Natasha, I assume you want whatever’s raw?”
Sometimes, he still feels self-conscious about his size. Spending most of his life looking and feeling one way only to change in only seconds had been disorienting, and he hadn’t had much of a chance to get used to his size before he’d been thrown into the war and then frozen in the ice. Tony’s always good to talk to though when he needs someone to remind him that this is okay, that he isn’t taking up too much room just by existing. Somehow, he always manages to get to the heart of Steve’s insecurities and allay them.
Tony may be only ten years old, but he can recognize a lie when he hears one.
“Ah yes!” Vision said. “I’m glad you mentioned that. What
“Okay,” Nat says, nodding. “So what’s holding you back?”
Tony: Now, hang on just a minute, Steve.
Cap Bear and Bucky Bear.”
“I bet you boys say that about everyone you have on the show,” Betty said, grinning conspiratorially at Tony.
“I’ll bet it’s the fightiest one too,” Tony teases warmly.
Steve: Okay, let’s take a few steps back. I think what we’re confused about here is that this is a friends with benefits situation. You’re not promised to each other. You’re not dating. Presumably, you’re friends, but even then, that doesn’t give you any say in what they do with their life.
“But—”
He winces. “You saw that?” He really hadn’t meant to get mixed up with Ty Stone again, but Ty was funny and tempting and Tony hadn’t never been able to say no to him.
It was harder than usual though. It was odd. Tony wasn’t normally late to their meetings. He was, in fact, one of the most professional people Steve had ever met, though he had an undeserved reputation for being extremely unprofessional that he’d gotten after quitting his first job post-college. Steve hated that reputation. He knew how hard Tony worked. It wasn’t fair that Hammer had managed to ruin his reputation so thoroughly over an unavoidable car accident. Anyway, Tony had never been late to a meeting before, not once in the five years they’d been working together. For him to be late that morning was extremely unusual.
“Yeah, why
“Sounds like a plan, ducky. In the meantime, why don’t you stay with me tonight?” She can see the boy hesitate, probably about to spout off another
have the X-gene, if the reason the serum only worked on him and, to a lesser extent, Schmidt is because it unlocked the genetic potential in a dormant gene. Or maybe biology doesn’t work like that at all and he’s only trying to come up with an explanation that answers a question he’s had since the forties. It makes about as much sense as every other theory he’s come up with has.
“…Yes?” Tony said, his voice lilting up at the end into a question, rather than a statement. “I mean—we don’t have to if you don’t want to, of course, but it’s not like this wasn’t a good couple of years, and now that I know the boundaries, it’s fine. I’m fine. And we know each other, right? We know what we like, what we want, so why should I have to go looking for someone else when I want to be fucked, you know? But, really, Stevie Bear, we really don’t have to if you’d rather just—”
It only makes Tony scowl harder. “You take that back,” he hisses.
It both surprises Steve and doesn’t surprise him at all. Tony really isn’t an early riser and Steve had gotten to the story very early this morning, too worried about Tony to sleep. But if things had gone the way he thinks they did last night, it’s not shocking at all to find Tony here. This store is their baby, but he thinks Tony in particular finds being here soothing, a calming oasis from the rest of the town.
“It’s going to be fine,” Tony repeats.
“You sure you don’t want to get them?”
His husband.
He’d apologized immediately after asking, said, “You don’t have to answer that.”
“Dottie runs it every year.”
“Right, but you’re still living with somebody who does have lice? So there’s nothing to stop you from getting it, say, tonight or maybe tomorrow or—”
,” Tony corrects immediately. “I leased it. I don’t have the money—” He stops, face flushing red in embarrassment.
Tony shrugs. “Spent a few years there, learned to pick up on the accents so the cabbies would stop yelling at me for mistaking their borough.”
Steve froze. “I—if you think that’s what we should—”
“We’re gonna get through this.”
Tony arrives a few hours before their scheduled meeting time, although Steve can’t tell if that’s because that’s the way the flights worked out or because Tony
“Ugh, you sound like my dad.”
Dottie ruled the neighborhood with an iron fist, Steve and Tony both knew that. There was no point in arguing openly with her when they could offer comfort in other smaller ways instead. Something about that rang false in Steve’s mind—he had the strangest feeling that he should be shouting her down about her tyranny—but as quickly as the thought appeared, it was gone again. He gently touched Wanda’s shoulder as she passed him, looking shamefaced and concerned all at the same time.
“You can’t promise that.”
Wanda smiled at him, warm if still a little too strained. “No, thank you,” she said, laying her own hand over his. “I’m sure he’ll show up soon.”
“Hmm,” Steve hums, agreeing with him. He’d hoped that Bucky would be the tiebreaker, but it doesn’t look the way.
“This is okay, right?” Tony asks without looking at him.
Steve all but dives for it, casting a furtive look at Sam asleep in the next bed. The team doesn’t know about the phone he sent Tony and Sam is the only one who knows about the letter. He’d said it was a bad idea, that Tony might use it to track them down. But Sam doesn’t know Tony like he does. Tony wouldn’t do something like that.
Tony tastes like salt, and Steve figures that he probably pushed all his engineers aside to try to fix the power problem on his own, taking on more than his fair share of the work as he complained about their incompetence. It wouldn’t be the first time he’s done that and it probably won’t be the last either. Steve would comment on Tony’s apparent arrogance and how he automatically assumes that he’s the smartest one except for the fact that, well, typically he’s right.
years, has Tony ever considered that his Steve Rogers might be the original.
“Too hot,” Tony says petulantly.
He’d never been good at being patient.
“No, it’s fine, I sleep better in my own bed anyway,” he said, parroting an old excuse he’d used a thousand times before, pretty much every time he and Tony ended up in the same bed together.
“Great,” he says. “Now, I know this isn’t a ‘real’ scene, but you said you’d done this before—” It occurs to him that Tony is only nineteen and he suddenly wonders who exactly Tony has done this with and if they’d known how young he is. He’s not sure he’ll like the answer. “Ah, you said you’d done this—”
after returning the Stones to their timelines. Steve stares in abject horror at all the people on their feet applauding the musical, which ends with character-Steve and character-Peggy sharing a dance together in this new timeline that character-Steve has apparently created.
“Well, I didn’t say it made much sense, now did I?” Jarvis says dryly. That, at least, manages to draw a laugh out of Tony. Tony flops back over onto his back and presses closer, shoving his head into Jarvis’ lap. Jarvis just shifts to make room for him and lifts his hand for Tony to push into like a particularly needy cat.
“Yes, thank you for pointing that out—”
“I know, but our version of help looks a lot like destruction. Look at what happened with Ultron. Or with SHIELD. Fuck, for that matter, look at what happened with Johannesburg. And it wasn’t like Wanda was an Avenger at that point. She let the Hulk loose on a city full of civilians, and I know that she regrets it, I know she’s reformed, but it still happened and she never even saw a trial.”
Rhodey inhales slowly. He’s not entirely surprised to find out that Tony’s attracted to men—that boy wouldn’t know the definition of subtle if it bit him on the ass—but this isn’t the time to talk about that. Time enough to reassure Tony that this doesn’t change anything later, not right now.
That’s another thing that’s so very new about this whole team-moving-in affair: Steve. Or, to be more specific, Steve spending most of his time in Tony’s new workshop. Steve says it feels very calming and that it’s a great place to relax while he’s drawing. Tony says that has to be bullshit because no one—not even Pepper and they dated for two years—has ever described Tony’s workshop, with its thumping bass music and holographs zooming around the room, as
He turns back to his breakfast, only to realize that the enchantment keeping the spoon stirring was way too high and now there’s egg splattered all across the kitchen.
“I know,” Bucky replies.
To his surprise, his husband turned over in the other bed to face him, leaning up just enough to turn on the lamp before slumping back into the pillows. Tony was up early indeed if Steve hadn’t even left for his run yet. He smiled fondly into Steve’s grey eyes, illuminated by the dim light of the lamp.
“It’s fine, just tell me what I should grab.”
“Maybe later, darling.”
“Hmph. I like it my way better.” He yawns, probably tuckered out from the long day. “Uncle Jarvis, will you tell me a bedtime story?”
“I did,” Steve says slowly. He needs to be careful about what he says here. He doesn’t want to sound like he’s attacking Tony or the Accords. “I—what is the Superhero Registration Act?”
falling into bed. At least Steve had managed to stay firm on just being casual. He’d sworn never to take a chance on Tony again. He’d learned his lesson, and no matter how many times Tony asked him out to dinner or invited him to stay after a night together, that wasn’t going to change. It might have gotten harder to refuse over the years, but he knew better now. Nothing had changed since college.
Steve: Life isn’t a movie, Tony. She’s not going to suddenly wake up and meet him at the airport to beg him not to leave.
“Probably not. People in power always think they can control everything. But what matters is that we are beholden to someone, instead of being able to do however much damage we feel like and leaving the financial burden of cleanup to the people we hurt the most.”
Tony smiled and moved closer, curling under Steve’s arm when he raised it. Steve laid his arm over Tony’s waist, trailing his hand down to Tony’s hip to pull his leg over Steve’s, just like it had been when he woke up earlier. Tony nosed under his chin to kiss the underside of his jaw as Steve kissed the top of his head. For a few minutes, they laid there, breathing the sleep-warm scent of the other in.
He texts Tony and sets up a meeting date and time at one of the safehouses he has and then he heads over there and waits. The team is more than capable of handling any problems without him while he’s gone, and he’s determined to beat Tony to the safehouse this time. If that means he has to wait there for four days until Tony arrives, then that’s what he’ll do. The world seems very quiet right now anyway, like it’s recovering after the Avengers’ split. He doubts that’s really the reason, doubts that the world could be so centered on his team, but that’s how it feels to him anyway.
“Well, you know me, I’m always bucking the trend.”
I know he’s done some strange things in the past, but nothing like this. This is way over the line.”
Once he was out of the building, he pulled his phone out of his pocket and checked to see if there were any Uber drivers in the area. He’d been lying to Tony earlier—Tony was the only one of his partners who lived in this area, but mentioning one of the others was the fastest way to get Tony to drop the issue of Steve staying the night. Unfortunately, it looked like he was stuck with the subway tonight. He shoved his hands into his pockets and set off down the street toward the nearest station. Sure, he’d have to deal with the odd people on the subway and sure, he’d need to keep a close eye on his belongings, but it still beat going back upstairs and asking Tony if he could stay.
“Still,” he says. “I shouldn’t have been rude. My Ma would wash my mouth out with soap.” Tony laughs and Steve grins back at him. “Anyway, yeah, I’m an experienced Dom, and what I was gonna say before we got sidetracked is that I know it’s not a ‘real’ scene but I drew up a modified contract for you anyway.”
Tony frowned, fingers drumming on the armrest of his chair. “The one whose coworker was claiming that she was cheating on her husband, but she refused to tell him that she
“What are you doing?” he hissed.
fine, why was he questioning it?).
“I knew he could be trusted.”
“You remember that woman from about a year ago who was dealing with that jealous coworker spreading rumors about her relationship?” Steve asked as they were sitting down for their next staff meeting. He cast a longing look at Tony’s coffee. Tony hadn’t brought him coffee in almost a month. Steve was slowly adjusting to the new normal—he could hardly complain now that he knew Tony had only been doing it because he was hoping to soften Steve up to dating him again—and usually he had enough time in the mornings to run down to the coffeeshop on his own to pick something up, but he’d been running late that morning. He was definitely feeling the lack of caffeine now, but not enough to brave the coffee from the staff breakroom. He wasn’t sure how, but he was pretty sure Sitwell was poisoning it.
Tony kisses him then, soft and sweet and a little hesitant, like he’s still not sure Steve is on the same page as him. But Steve is. He always has been. He slides his hands around Tony’s waist, fitting there perfectly as though Tony was made for him. And maybe he was. It’s always been the two of them, so maybe this was fated to happen.
,” Tony laughs, gasping for breath between each word. “Darling, you were two feet away from me and you just let me
But he couldn’t say any of that. He knew what Bucky would say and he didn’t want to hear it.
He crawls up next to Tony and carefully undoes the row of buttons, baring Tony to the navel. He pushes the straps down Tony’s shoulders and then guides his hands to either side of his head.
To his surprise, however, Tony shook his head and jerked his head toward the parking lot. “I’m back here.”
“You wouldn’t leave me with the company.”
“He’s not leaving Wakanda yet. Shuri says he doesn’t think he’s ready. She said he’s raising goats, named the smallest one Steve.”
And then, for the first time all day, Steve is left alone. He tilts his head back, massaging out the pain in his temples. When he’d moved to town, he’d taken this job because it’s what he’s familiar with and Luis was willing to offer him a room in exchange for the job, but he’s got to find something else to do. He just can’t get any work done like this.
“Right,” Tony says, snuggling closer to him. Jarvis smiles at the sweet sight he makes and cards his fingers through Tony’s soft curls. “And I got Cap Bear and Bucky Bear too.”
“Do you want to talk about it?” he asks quietly.
“I’m fine,” Tony assured him. He smiled wryly. “I think I just woke up on the wrong side of the bed.”
to do this. “I’m coming home.”
“There’s nothing convenient about what either of you are doing.”
“This isn’t right,” Tony says desperately, and Steve’s heart breaks cleanly in two. “This—none of this was real.”
“Hi, Tasha,” Steve laughs, dismounting smoothly. He shows no sign of being cold despite his feet left bare to the open air. He gives her a quick hug—Tony is
“Yeah. He needs to be a part of this.”
“What?” he asks, slightly defensively. Not everyone has understood his relationship with the bots after all.
She bends over the crib, far enough that she can kiss Tony’s head without disturbing him. Tony smells like sleep and that special scent that all babies have. He coos a little in his sleep, kicking out with his tiny feet. Maria freezes, worried that she’s woken him up again, but all Tony does is attempt to roll onto his stomach. She sighs—this isn’t the first time he’s tried this—and rolls him back onto his back. It’s better for him; all the doctors say so. But Tony is determined, and as soon as she lets go of him, he flops back over onto his stomach.
(See the end of the chapter for
Natasha nods. “I know,” she says, parroting Steve’s words. “And I don’t think Tony would love you nearly as much as he does if you weren’t.”
“Fuck, I’m gonna have to become a superhero, aren’t I?” he mutters to himself as he watches Captain America face down a god that Tony only knows from Norse mythology. He hadn’t been planning on attending this gala, but the museum he’s been donating to over the last year had insisted (he hasn’t had the heart to tell them yet that he’d only been donating to them because their curator is named Steve Rogers), so he’d shown up, not expecting that a crazy god was going to crash the party and rip out someone’s eye.
He smiles. “Course I will.”
legacy, and it had taken Tony most of his life to escape it.
Tony brightens, straightening up, and for a brief moment, Steve feels a flash of hope—right up until Tony opens his mouth. “Okay so it’s kind of inspired by the old apothecary that used to be there except it's a lot more general?” he says. “But it’s also a more specific than just general.”
Tony stops spraying down the flowers and looks at him with a slightly sad smile. “You don’t have to do that,” he says.
He’s on the verge of just returning the frame to the store when Luis looks at it and says, “Man, just tell him it comes with the license if he doesn’t like it.”
“You shut your mouth,” Tony growls.
“You’re not living with your father right now,” she says firmly, dropping a kiss on his forehead so he knows she’s not upset with him. She wishes she could take this sweet boy away from his father—not her friend, not anymore and not for a long time—but the life of a SHIELD agent is no life for a little boy, even one as precocious as Tony is. “You’re living with me, and if you want a Cap Bear, then we’ll go get you a Cap Bear.”
Well, if the rain really
In the
“Steve?” Tony asks again. “I’m sorry, I know you’re not—” He sighs. “I’ll see you in thirty minutes.”
“Definitely goes after a lot of goats three times his size. Reminds me of someone else I know. He sounds a little bit more endearing than the person I know though.”
He leans forward and breathes, “Please,” over Tony’s lips before kissing him deeply. Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Tony’s hands twitch like he wants to reach for Steve, but they obediently stay where Steve put them. He rewards his husband by licking his way into Tony’s mouth, letting him taste the orange cream frosting he had been preparing before the power went out. The frosting and cupcakes both are stored in the fridge now; hopefully, they won’t go bad before the power in the fridge turns back on.
“I don’t know why they get so confused,” Steve admits. “It’s not like I retired with Nat.”
Caller: Hi, I’m so glad I managed to reach y’all. You wouldn’t believe what I’m going through right now.
“I think I should warn you,” Tony says as Steve fishes pajamas out of his drawer to give to him. With the lice outbreak, Tony flat out refuses to return to the motel until both Janet and motel are declared lice-free, so Steve had offered to lend him some of his clothes (and if he’s aware that a big part of why he’s offering is because he wants to see Tony in his clothes… well, at least Tony hasn’t realized that). “I’ve been told I’m terrible to sleep with.”
She grimaces slightly. “That’s not really how the Accords work.” He glances at her questioningly. “It works more like an auditor, somewhat. We have a battle, we do a certain amount of damage, we then have to account for that damage to the Accords committee. They ask why the damage was unavoidable, what could have been done to mitigate the battle, and then we work out a way to repay what happened, whether that’s financially or helping with the cleanup or whatever else might be decided.”
That’s—Steve doesn’t know how he feels about that. Tony hadn’t mentioned it, but he can’t help but wonder if he
“Hi,” Tony replies calmly like there’s nothing strange about this. He passes first Sam and then Steve plates. Steve surreptitiously pokes his omelet, wondering if it’s actually edible. Tony isn’t exactly known for his stellar skills in the kitchen. But the omelet doesn’t look either burnt or undercooked, and Sam is shoveling his down like it’s his last meal, so Steve cautiously takes a bite of his. It’s surprisingly delicious. Tony must have learned how to cook over the last few years, since he and Pepper broke up and the rest of the team moved out of the tower.
But the lights that he wired just a couple days ago start flickering and Tony stills before pulling away.
“What do you need from me?” he asks instead, swallowing back all the questions he wants to ask.
He—he’d told himself that he wasn’t going to let himself get attached to Tony again. He’d told himself he wouldn’t let Tony hurt him the way he had fifteen years ago. He was sticking to that. Tony could leave. It wouldn’t be the first time and it probably wouldn’t be the last. Tony
Probably not.
have insisted on no marks.
“Pick up a new one,” Steve decided. “I don’t anyone to lose their job over a simple mistake. We’ll get it tomorrow when we go into town.”
“And it’s—I knew he was using me, okay? Justin’s a soul-sucking, bottom feeder, who befriends and dates and uses people to climb to the top and I knew he just wanted my connections with Howard so I thought it was okay but then. I don’t know—” Horrifyingly, Steve hears Tony let out a tiny sniffle. Oh gods, he doesn’t know how to handle this. He’s terrible at comfort, really he is. “He got those connections after a couple of weeks, it wasn’t like he had to keep dating me, so I guess I thought… Well, doesn’t matter what I thought.”
“Yeah it was weird too. One moment, I still had a full bowl and the next, it was all gone.”
Steve blinks at him. “Do you really think so little of me that you just assume I can’t stop by because I want to say hello?”
“It was Janet’s idea,” Tony says with a little shrug. “She pointed out that there are some tricky potions out there for people without formal training, which most of our vendors don’t have, so she suggested using their ingredients to make some of the potions and sell them.”
Steve turns to see Tony looking between the two of them flatly. “Hi,” he gasps out, still feeling a little choked by the nearly overwhelming scent of roses.
Steve has the most
Steve fled.
“Tony,” Steve says, surprised. Did something happen with Howard? “Everything okay?”
“Come on, let’s go ahead and turn you off,” he says. “That way all those sensors aren’t bothering you until you’re all fixed up.”
“Sorry to wake you,” he offered. “You can go back to sleep.”
This chapter isn't based off of any one particular episode. I just wanted to have a cute little interlude with them working to get the store up and running
“What, Nat’s not keeping you updated?” Tony asks with a light chuckle. Steve doesn’t know how to answer that. He hadn’t known Nat was still talking with either of them. Tony takes pity on him and says, “I’m pretty sure Clint’s still in contact with her, though he’s been staying pretty tight-lipped about it.”
“What do you want me to do?” Tony breathed against his neck.
“Oh,” Vision said faintly. “And what did
“Oh and you’re so sure that you’re that important, are you?”
“Yeah, I can understand that,” Steve says, thinking of all the nightmares he’s had since waking up from the ice. He still tries to avoid places too far north during the winter and it’s been years since he woke up. “It’ll be okay. Rhodey’s strong. He’ll figure out a way to get back up there.”
Somehow, without quite remembering it, he got to work. He had to have driven, the car was in the parking lot after all, but he had no recollection of the drive. Tony shuddered, thinking of the news program he and Steve had watched last night. The world was rapidly becoming a scarier place and he hated to think what could be happening to his brain right at that very moment.
“Got it,” Steve interrupts. So it’s exactly as he thought earlier: there’s a lot more going on between Tony and his father than what meets the eye. His phone buzzes again and this time, he pulls it out of his pocket to see that he’s missed two calls from the same unfamiliar number.
“Steve—”
“Let’s see, story, story, story,” he mutters once he has her settled in her bed. “Ah, here’s a good one! Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Maguna who went to bed and immediately fell asleep. The end!”
we have so little time?” Steve asks. “It’s bothered me. It doesn’t make any sense, we should have been involved in this process from the ground up.”
The shirt slips from Tony’s shoulders, falling to the ground to reveal the top half of a silk romper, the same bright red as the lipstick Tony likes to wear when he’s sucking Steve’s cock and edged in gold lace. A small row of gemstone buttons—Steve would be willing to bet they’re made from actual rubies because Tony does not compromise on the cost of his lingerie—splits the romper in half, leading down past the elastic band cinching tight around Tony’s waist and into his pants.
Steve, right? You put out the ad for a photography model?”
been building toward something, have been since Tony first reached out to him on that horrible flip phone that Steve sent because he couldn’t resist needling Tony like he used to.
“Someone wasn’t paying attention, probably,” Tony said, shrugging. “Do you want to send it back or just pick up a new one?”
“Mmhmm.” Steve kissed him again, just as slow as the first time, even though Tony’s strokes were getting faster. Tony’s breathing was speeding up too, telling Steve that he was close.
The door closed behind the girl and Steve whipped around, a smirk spreading across his face. Tony raised one eyebrow, waiting.
Before Steve left New York, Bucky would say that Steve has a hero complex. He would say that if a situation was going south, Steve was always going to be the one to step up and play the white knight. And that’s true. Steve has never been able to ignore a bad situation. He’s always been the one to stop the bullies beating up kids on the playground, the frat bros plying the girls with drinks at the tailgates, the guys harassing women at the bars. That’s who he is. That’ll
probably know, we all already know.”
And Steve—
Tony shoots him a wicked grin, licks the last little bit off of his fingers, and buttons the romper back up. “We’re going to have to throw this out,” he says idly.
“Hey,” he says softly when he steps inside, hoping not to startle Tony too badly, which would send not only the floating objects but Tony himself crashing to the floor.
“Wasn’t my fault we were so busy with your robot last year that we forgot to buy presents. Now shut up and listen to the story.”
“Maybe one of Clint’s words.”
Tony doesn’t take it. “I think I’m good, thanks.”
That’s why he isn’t surprised when Tony doesn’t say anything to him about the amendments passing. Instead, Tony—always one for a show—texts him one day to turn on the TV. When Steve sits down next to Sam and Wanda, Nat perched on the back of the couch behind them, he sees Tony standing beside T’Challa as the king announces the new changes to the Accords.
He hadn’t thought of it like that, not in the heat of the moment in Siberia and not afterwards. Steve had thought—well, Tony has often told him about how contentious his relationship with his parents, particularly Howard, had been. He supposes that he’d just figured that Tony has long since moved on from their deaths, that it wasn’t still affecting him almost thirty years later. He looks again at Tony and this time, he sees the dark bags under his eyes. It’s been a few weeks since the Avengers broke apart and it looks like Tony has barely slept since then.
“Don’ wanna,” Tony mumbles, but he doesn’t fight Steve when he crawls into bed behind Tony and props him up against his chest. Tony manages to eat a few bites and drinks the entire bottle of water before he pushes the bowl away, looking queasy. Steve doesn’t argue about it. It’s more than the toast he’d eaten earlier.
“You wouldn’t be Steve Rogers if you did,” she agrees. “Does Tony know that?”
He doesn’t know when Tony goes back to his potions but they settle into a comfortable silence, Steve drawing and Tony humming along to the music as he adds ingredients to the cauldrons. It’s nice, Steve thinks to himself. He can picture them doing this five—ten—fifty years into the future, him and Tony, business partners and friends for life.
“Yeah, but none of them were alive to protest it.”
you sure? You asked me out; I thought that meant you had feelings for me still?”
that,” he said. “’s way too soon. I’m not a teenager anymore.” Tony opened his mouth and Steve held a finger up to his lips. “Don’t.”
“Again, at this hour?”
“Don’t take it personally,” he said quietly. “Dottie just takes a while to warm up to people. Would you like me to go out and look for Vision?”
“What you want doesn’t matter,” Steve shouted, losing control over his temper. Tony reared back as though Steve had slapped him. How—how
Jumping down into the snow yet again, Tony made his way towards the cockpit that he was previously inspecting. With the tools that he grabbed from the other men, he started to clear the ice and gain more visibility on what was inside. The more he drilled and watched the melt ice falling on the snow and on his boots, the clearer the sight was getting.
“Like this?”, Tony asked as he got closer, forcing Steve to either look away or stare into his eyes.
“It’s working...it’s working..!”
He didn’t pull away. He didn’t feel the need to do so. It felt right, it felt nice, it felt like it was supposed to feel.
“I’m sure,” Steve added, folding his legs as he looked out again.
“You…what-”, Steve’s words were cut as Tony pulled him closer, palms on Steve’s cheeks.
“I’m sorry”, Steve apologised.
Tony nodded and ran inside, watching the fight through the glass door, trying to think of a way to help Steve. He was right there, fighting for him, to save him and for the first time in his life, he was seeing Captain America, the true Captain America in action. It was thrilling and exciting, but at the same time he was worrying himself to death, worried about Steve’s safety.
“It is not your people that need saving,” Steve said softly, closing his eyes against the pain as Tony stepped back, “it is mine, from yours. Your people will kill mine. I have spoken to the fates.” He pulled away himself, lowering his gaze as he stepped back to the window.
“Such a mind-set is bound to be able to change, over time. Patience my friend, which is a virtue.” Steve said, getting to his feet and lightly patting Falcon on the shoulder.
“Steve”, Tony said, his voice glimmering with hope as he turned around, hugging Steve’s waist tightly.
Tony took a deep breath and walked over to him, turning Steve around to looking straight into his eyes. The disappointment in them was overwhelming, but that didn't stop Tony.
Tony thought as he walked around, trying to spot the blonde hair and purple tunic that he had seen before. He was close to giving up hope when he reached the outskirts of the city to see a lonely figure standing out from the dark graves. He approached and stood by Steve, arms crossed.
him, how much he started to mean to him, how scary was to imagine a day away from him. Pepper was right, being in love was terrifying and hurtful.
“I don’t need your lies,” Steve said, gritting his teeth. “I know what happens now.”
“We’re pretty much the same person… so very similar designs and concepts, I need to make some alternations, and I'm not too keen on the black and yellow pattern… but I can pilot those suits, no problem. I've built about… 42 of them back home.”, Tony nodded as he turned to look at the blond.
“...Pepper?”, Steve asked as he turned back to him. Tony was dumping many things on him at once, and this name sure didn’t ring any bells.
Stane laughed as he made his way towards them, ignoring the loud noise and creaking from the ground as he slid his heavy feet across it.
what he taught Tony not to do.
“I’m Dr. Zola, this is my colleague, Dr. Tarleton”, he continued, offering his hand to Steve.
They spent the rest of their afternoon walking by the Seine, lost in the alleys and ending up facing the Notre Dame, which Steve absolutely adored and carried on talking about Victor Hugo’s novel, with Tony insisting that the Disney movie was much better and happier. The shape of croissants impressed Steve, and they had chocolate ice-cream as the walked down the street, holding hands, both of them enjoying the freedom and relaxation as much as they could.
“Merry Christmas, Shellhead...”
Steve narrowed his eyes. “I’m sure that you are...”, he replied, continuing to pin the man down as he turned on the light blindly, not taking his eyes off him.
Steve could feel his cheeks somewhat warmer and he couldn’t really explain why, taking a gulp of water from the bottle nearby, trying a sushi piece with a fork this time around, grimacing a bit. “The Japanese don’t cook their fish?!”, he asked Tony with a hint of surprise.
“Well, it’s not really a question, it’s more like an observation,” Tony said, his voice lower still. “I just want to say, thank you for staying for so long, and even if you leave, thank you for talking to me for so long and staying with me.”
Okay, apparently, he was.
“That’s not a ringing endorsement to skip. We have to go grocery shopping today. We’re out of fruit.”
He had always thought he hid his discomfort well, but Tony must have known about it. Why else would he have chosen this house for a meeting place, so soon after their fight in Siberia?
Caller: Well, no?
“A man can dream,” he said stubbornly.
“The frame.” Luis gestures at it with the plate he’s holding, only noticing at the last second that it’s about to drop the food on everything Steve’s working on. He quickly sets it down on the desk. “Oh shit. Forgot I was holding this. Made you some waffles.”
in person.”
their show on the cutting block. He nodded and, thinking that was the end of their conversation, reached over to turn his computer on, pulling up the website for their guest speaker for that day’s show. To his surprise however, Tony didn’t leave, only sat back in his borrowed chair, closing his eyes. He looked exhausted, Steve suddenly realized, and he wondered if Tony hadn’t been sleeping well or if the rumors had been bothering him more than he’d said.
“Janet, why am I smelling roses?” Tony shouts from the back, voice getting louder as he walks into the main room. “What are you—oh.”
, his lungs expanding against his now-broad chest easily, instead of coughing every time he takes a breath. He turns to Tony and has to look down because he’s easily six inches taller than him now instead of nearly a foot shorter. And Tony—
He pulls out his phone—not the flip phone, but one of the StarkPhones Steve is so familiar with—and taps a few times on it. “There, I sent you a copy of the Accords as they are right now. I know you didn’t really get a chance to read over them before we were asked to sign. You can read them, pass them off to Clint and Lang, send the two of them to T’Challa when they’re done. He’ll get them started on the appeals process.”
“Right. Ah—sort of,” he says, remembering that they were talking about U’s ability to feel pain. “It’s not—he doesn’t feel pain like we do—or at least, I assume you feel pain. Did the serum take that away too? Never mind, not important, we can talk about the serum later. Anyway, it doesn’t
“—colors,” Tony is saying. “We’ll put a card or something down next to the horses, or maybe we’ll include it with a purchase. Red for romance, blue for pirates, green for coziness.”
Steve shakes his head fondly. “You’re such a brat.”
“And the rest of it?” he asks after a moment.
“Howard said I couldn’t bring my Bucky Bear,” Tony mumbles. Peggy’s heart breaks all over again at hearing this little boy call his own father by his first name.
He was, and he knew that it was a risk, but he couldn’t just leave those two boys out there. That wasn’t who he was, and that wasn’t who Tony was either, though he was a little too shocked by what was going on with Agnes and Wanda to remember it.
“He’s as oblivious as a bag of rocks,” Natasha says. “At least when it comes to himself. Sorry, I thought it might be a date when he said it was just supposed to be the three of us. But then I saw your face and I knew.”
“When did we meet? That’s an easy one,” Steve laughed. Tony was visible in the background behind Steve, washing dishes. “We met… we met… well, you know, it’s been… I don’t know, I guess it feels like I’ve known Tony my entire life. I can’t really remember a time when I
Oh Tony. Steve sighed, more tired than he’d been in a long time. He should have seen it. He’d thought he should be expecting a grand gesture if Tony wanted to get back together, but he should have expected that Tony would try subtlety after all those years apart. If someone had called into their show and told them that they were doing the same thing Tony was, he would have known they were trying to get back together with their partner. But he’d been willfully blind, too hurt by everything that had happened fifteen years ago to see what Tony was trying to do.
with finding him. Jarvis says he wasn’t always like that. He was obsessed with the search for a few years after the war, but then he settled down once Aunt Peggy and Uncle Grant got married, only for that old obsession to come roaring back after Tony had been born. If Tony didn’t know any better, he’d say that his dad thought Captain America was Tony’s soulmate, but that’s impossible. Captain America couldn’t have possibly met Tony when he was a baby because Captain America is dead. The most Howard could possibly hope for is to bring his body home.
“Steve!” he called again when his husband didn’t answer. He didn’t think Steve had already gone outside to mow the lawn already (how could he be mowing the lawn, something whispered, when he barely had the strength to push it?), but maybe he was wrong. Of course, if Steve
Steve: But grand gestures don’t have to be a wrong move when you’re just asking someone out. They can be a wrong move at any time if you don’t know what you’re doing. Let’s say, for an entirely hypothetical example—
“You’re lucky,” he told her. “Your husband doesn’t abandon you in favor of feeding candy to small children. God, I don’t envy their parents. Bedtime’s going to be a nightmare.”
“And also it’s not really a store—”
“Sounds good,” he declared, clearly surprising Tony, judging by the way Tony’s eyes widened. “You were serious about that offer, right?”
“Fine. How does it taste then?”
“He had a bottle of Gatorade and a piece of toast this morning.”
Concerned, Steve silently slips toward the front door, grabbing a gun (Natasha’s insistence since he gave up the shield) from the coffee table as he goes. The knock comes again, followed by what sounds like a very weary Tony saying, “Steve, I know you’re in there. Just—just open the fucking door, would you?”
“Yeah.”
“Has he eaten?” he asks, getting in the elevator.
“No, you’re not,” Bucky said, gentler than he’d sounded for the entire conversation. “You haven’t been fine in fifteen years. And I get it. What Tony did back then was really, really shitty, but what you’re doing now is just as bad. And if you’re not careful, you’ll ruin the best show you’ve ever had, on top of whatever you’ve got with Tony.”
“So. Who are you supposed to be?”, he asked, flashing him a cheeky smile.
He trained as a warrior, standing side by side with the generals as they prepared themselves for the impending war. Tony had promised to keep Athens safe, and yet days after his return, Sparta had made it clear that they would attack Athens - with or without Tony.
“That’s not what people want, though. Yeah, you might consider yourself a bit outdated, but that’s exactly what it’s needed right now. A blast from the past, back when things were different, well Brooklyn was still standing, for example”
Tony swallowed hard as he leaned closer; hoping Steve wouldn't push him back, hoping he hadn't misinterpreted Steve’s affection. He stopped just inches away from Steve's lips, their noses almost touching, and flicked his gaze up to meet Steve's. “Do you trust me?” he whispered, breath short.
“Yes,” Steve said, looking down to meet Tony's dark blue eyes. “I wouldn’t have made a friend if you weren’t.”
“How come that you’re so interested in this project, Tony? I know that want to dive into new markets and industries, but I wanted to ask you, is it something..personal..?”
Tony watched as Steve lowered his weapons, clearly not intending to carry on the fight, his own words probably putting him off. The Spartan was a clever, intelligent man, he had just been raised in the way that all Spartans deemed appropriate; putting the city’s safety and honour above everything else, turning every man into a soldier, making each man a warrior who would be glad to die to save his comrades, his friend and family, his city.
Tony’s eyes widened; this was the first time that someone spoke so genuinely to him in response to his traumatic experience. It felt so soothing, to know that someone out there understood him and didn’t expect him to act like the society expected from him was such a huge relief.
“I will always love you, Steve Rogers.”
“Exactly. Getting hurt then coming back for more, not even knowing why. Steve.. there’s no happy ending, just the sole need to be there for each other, for being there in each other’s lives, whenever that means that we need to fall in each other’s personal Hell. Because trust me, Steve, my life is nothing but a rotting hell, soften by you and you only. Don’t leave me alone in there, Steve, just.. don’t..”, Tony said, looking up to Steve, his eyes still red. “And trust me, I was strong enough to do that alone before you showed up.. then you did something.. you changed all that.. I can’t do this alone, Steve, I need you there to fight by my side”
Tony Stark didn’t have many friends. He had Pepper and Rhodey, and that was it. He realised that Coulson was close to becoming one of them, and now he was gone. That silly smile on his face whenever they met, trying to be all business but they ended up laughing it off, was now gone. How could he tell that to Pepper? He didn’t remember Fury and Steve joining him around the table, his back turned at them.
“I can’t let my need for companionship clouds my duties,” Steve said softly.
Tony held on to Steve as he led the horses out, driving past the same sights they saw when they first arrived on foot. He leaned against Steve and rested his eyes, patient as he was, eager to go back and get close to Steve once again.
“I would, I know I would”, Bucky nodded sagely.
“Oh, you’ll be surprised more than just once during your stay," Tony chuckled as he sat up.
And then, there it was, that silver glimpse that almost caused Tony’s heart to stop. The shiny object was visible through the thick ice, and after spending almost his entire childhood worshipping the world’s first and last superhero, Tony knew exactly what was. Without any single doubt, what was hidden under the ice was his hero’s, Captain America, trusty shield, the weapon he used to take out their enemies and helped win the war. Sure, he knew that there was a museum dedicated to him with a collection of the Captain’s shields and costumes, but this..this was genuine. He read about his self sacrifice, how they were all saved because of him, how he died diving that plane into the ocean, but there it was, his original shield and the plane he.. Tony’s face went white; what if the Captain was actually there as well? He must have been dead, it had been years since the war had ended, but they never mentioned finding a body, did they? The thought made him stick his hands on the cold ice, desperately looking for any signs of a body, anything that would prove that the Captain was indeed there in some way.
“You heard the Captain, Stane. You’re not using him and you better get those money making schemes out of your head. We’re not breeding super soldiers, not now, not ever”, Tony concluded, properly facing Stane and standing side by side with Steve.
“You’re my responsibility, you’re here now and I’ll work this out.”
“Teaching me,” Tony pointed out with a nod, fixing his own tunic as he looked around.
Steve blushed shyly before nodding. “Can you,” he asked. “Please?”
! You hear me?! I'm not your Tony or whatever! I don’t know what happened and I don’t care, I'm not
Finding him alive in the ice was something he could never imagine of happening, but there he was, in flesh and bone, talking to him, walking in him when he was just coming out of a shower, his chest exposed. Tony wasn’t exactly the type of guy that would open up to people, but his secretive tendencies became even worse after he returned from Vietnam. Even his friends couldn’t take more words out of him, and the one man who knew exactly what happened died before they could both get released. Turned out he needed a bodyguard in first place, before he was kidnapped and forced to make weapons for the sole purpose of pure destruction, something that their world couldn’t afford anymore. It had barely been a year, but Tony would still clutch on his chest and stay awake at night, thinking of the sharp pain he felt when the explosion hit him miles away, waking up to find that metallic creation built on his chest and being told that the only way to survive was to keep it on for the rest of his life.
Tony nodded, making sure forgotten anything, and walked towards Steve. “To Athens then," he said with an excited nod.
“Huh…? Oh, nothing.”, Steve rushed to reply.
Tony stayed behind the shield, shaking his head in despair. “I did, I loved you! I still do, listen to me! I was trying to chase after you, to say it! I didn’t realise until you stepped away, and I was stupid to let you go! I love you, I don’t care what any god says or what even the fates want to do!” he screamed, hitting against the shield.
Steve took him through them, though it turned out that Tony was better at mathematics than he let on, so he moved from that to literature, showing Tony plays just like he wanted to learn and going through them with meanings and in depth analysis.
Steve sucked on Tony’s nipple, groaning softly at the familiar taste that he’d enjoyed. His other hand stroked Tony’s well defined stomach muscles, trailing along each small bump and dip.
“Now you’re just being sentimental”, Steve finally said as he pulled Tony close for a warm embrace. “I’m not saying that I know what this is.. but we can give it a show together, right, Shellhead?”, he said in a more cheerful tone, breathing out some of the constant worries inside his chest.
At his comment, the scientists and employees that were staring turned away, focusing on their screens, but Steve knew that they were doing anything in their power to catch a glimpse of him.
“Are those... some kind of gems?”
Tony kept asking questions, asking where the famous philosophers were talking at that very moment, but Steve seemed eager to lead him back to the temple.
Steve nodded, following him back inside, both of them dripping and giggling to themselves, still excited over the fact that Steve was now able to fly.
The journey was long, and the snow storm didn’t make it easier either; the wind was blowing into their faces and they had to stop more than once to repair some of the vehicles.
Steve leaned closer, the rippling of the water making a sound as he moved. He brushing his lips against Tony’s first, barely skimming them together, before he moved forward and pressed them together, shutting his eyes as he felt his heart rate suddenly quicken. He didn’t part his lips just yet, but he was mesmerized by how magnetic the feeling was, how their lips felt so warm and soft together.
“Do you want to watch it?”, Tony suggested. “I mean, watching a Cap film with THE Captain America sitting next to me doing the commentary is an experience I want to live”, he said, not even trying to hide his excitement at that point.
Steve pursed his lips before he spoke, always truthful and honest. “You’re protecting my people. You said that you would if you allowed me to learn from you and you learn from me,” he said, “I thought that was our deal?”
” she would reply before leaving the office and leaving Tony alone looking at the picture on his desk. It was him and Steve, dressed as Captain America and Iron Man in one of the first press conferences they held, after Steve was found in the ice. He took the framed pictured and trailed his fingers on it, before placing it down with a sigh. Yes, he loved him. He loved him very much, not
“Greetings, low rate human beings…”
Tony’s words surprised him, and he tilted his head in return. “I wouldn’t wish for you to stay where you don’t want to be. You look as though you want to go back, I can see it in your eyes,” Steve said, reaching over to place his hand under Tony’s chin, turning his head to see his face.
“I'm…”, Tony whispered. What was he supposed to say? That he was sorry? Did he honestly hoped that an apology would solve everything?
“Well one day we will both stand by our parents on that mountain,” Steve said, taking him to a small armoury where they kept his and the other soldiers’ armour, walking inside to be acquainted with his shield,  “once our duties here are done, and when the people no longer need us here.”
“Sir! Sir!”, a voice was heard close to him, and Tony opened his eyes wide, rubbing them and looking around.
The blond smirked as he swooped down, grabbing Tony by his waist and lifting him up with him. Tony gasped and wrapped his arms around Steve’s neck, looking down at the distance that separated them from the ground, then back at Steve who seemed to have been staring at him and looked away...bashfully? He didn’t think about it too much, instead he enjoyed the feeling of flying, holding on Steve and really loving how close he was to him for a change.
, he asked himself, not sure if he could even answer that. He just told his teenage hero that he wasn’t dead, that he woke up 70 years into the future and that he could take him back to New York.. Then what was in for the Captain? How could he deal with all the changes around him, and without a doubt, the mental consequences of those events?
Tony nodded in return, moving to settle himself on top of Steve, his long hair covering the side of his face.
“Why would you want to go there?”
The large blonde was however; only ready to listen to him after he was shot back when he attempted to hit Steve with his hammer. The friction between the shield and the hammer calmed down the heat.
“Of course, I was stuck in my ways and in my perceptions about Spartans until I met you. Of course, you are most unlike the man I had expected, and nothing like the man I said you were.”
The large blonde wolf wrapped his arms around him, chin perching on Tony’s shoulder as the man picked up his tablet. It was just like the times where they would relax, Steve coming in after his work out and cuddling Tony from behind as he would check whatever was going on around the world, Avenger emergencies, company business. Tony scratched him as he continued to read; this could become a routine but on the other hand, he also wanted his human boyfriend back for many reasons.
Steve lowered him down on the floor, not realising that he really did lift him up while he was forcing him to talk. “Very well. Go ahead.”, he nodded, fixing his uniform. Losing his calm was something that happened when he couldn't afford to wait or play nice, and to have the Illuminati lying to him again wasn't something that he would tolerate, when such matters of importance were on stake.
“Okay, now what?” He asked, “What’s going to happen now?”
“They do,” Steve answered, but he scratched the back of his head at the second question, “I am no artist, really.”
Steve chuckled, regaining his normal cheek colour.
“You know, I can’t thank you enough for all this.. for helping me so much, you literally gave me a purpose in this new world, Tony.. not to mention a home, I couldn’t ask for anything else.. you’ve been here for me more than anyone else did, no matter what... never left my side and I.. I really appreciate that..”, he started, seeing that Tony’s expression softened.
“Sorry about that. Yes, it has been hard. I’m skeptical about this project, Stark. Why me? Why now? If you had this technology under development, one would think that you would offer it to every soldier, no, not just the military, anyone who has to go through this, some of them since birth. It feels suspicious, selfish even.”
“Did I? Well I’m back now. I’ll make sure that you get tired of me, Stark.”
Not only that, but he saw how determined the son of Ares seemed, how he and the Spartans were one and the same. To Tony, the man that he had first approached with high hopes had tarnished and spat on them like some sort of monster. He was particularly more cautious with his words, no wonder the people of Athens had warned him.
“Do you really believe that?” Tony asked him, going quiet for a while. “Do you believe that someone can’t change for the best? That a demon can’t be saved?”
“I’m glad,” Tony sighed, rubbing his head against Steve's chest. “It wouldn't be nice if you did."
“Captain America… what will you have left? Nothing at all, everything that you love is taken away from you, you’re sealing your own fate!”
They belonged together in a way, two lost souls, lost boys who had been alone for so long and had finally found someone else to share everything with. Maybe Steve didn’t think of them as exactly that, but it was enough for Tony; he would hold on what he had and appreciate, the way he never had before.
“No, not really,” Steve said. “It takes time for others to master it, though.” He took another brush and made a quick mess of shapes, trying to form a structure from his mind to render Tony from the waist up.
“Not yet!”, Steve called.
“No, Steve. Thank you”
Tony nodded to him, pleased by Steve's words. “You can come to the baths with me and then I’ll show you where you can rest, what do you think?” he offered.
Tony smirked at his words, the guest’s bluntness merely entertaining him at this point, standing up and giving him a nod and an ironic bow, stepping down the stairs to approach him.
“What...?”
The future changed for the better, that was for sure.
Tony could feel his heart racing; it couldn’t be true, right? His feelings for Steve were taking over him, and to hear that the other man felt the same way made him panic, all in a good way. Nothing before seemed to be going well for Tony Stark, but that man showed up to change everything.
Steve was roughly at the spot where Tony wanted him, but he had to be careful and bring things slowly to him, not scare him off. However, he knew that in the back of the Captain’s head, a more curious, playful side of him was hiding, and he would use that to his advantage. He raised his fingers, turning on one of their functions, making the smaller and slimmer, suitable for what he had in mind. Watching Steve, he moved them behind the man’s body, resting by his seated bottom.
“My city is peaceful, and I intend to keep it that way.”
“Just relax, Captain Rogers”, he said, eyes fixed on the man’s body beneath him, the fingers moving close to his opening.
“It has a magnificent view though, I can give Pepper credit for that”, Tony commented, standing up and stopping against the large glass window. Steve joined him, pulling him in a hug from behind as he stared outside with a puzzled expression.
Steve was taken back to Athens and locked in one of the rooms of the temple to pray for forgiveness. On his hands and knees, he pleaded to her for her help again, but received nothing in return trying so desperately to repent but his efforts were fruitless.
“Where am I?”, the blonde asked again as he raised his eyes to meet up Tony’s. “Don’t sugar coat it and explain the details, what is going on here? Why am I not dead?”, he said in a growl.
“How do you know about that?”, the blonde snarled, his eyes narrowed. Little that he known, it was a secret government experiment, the public didn’t know about the details, let alone the super soldier serum. But this fella did mentioned that they came with the government, didn’t he? The real question was, could he be trusted? Probably not, there were guns aiming at him right now.
“Did I bore you already?” Tony asked with a smile, doing the same and just watching Steve.
Was that friendship really though? Tony had known Rhodey for years but he never felt like that when he saw Rhodey, he didn’t seek Rhodey's affection in the way that he searched for Steve’s. But if it wasn't friendship, then what was it?
There were two boys gifted with the powers of the gods – demigods therefore - one known as the son of Athena and the other deemed the son of Ares. They were also burdened with the responsibilities to uphold the duties of their parents, watching over their people with care and love in the names of their parents, just as they would if they were fully fledged gods. They were treated as such, taken care of within the temples of their parents and having others cater to their every need.
“We both know that it’s not as simple-“
“And what’s the point praying to the God of War, Athenian? My prayers won’t be heard, do you think that I didn’t try before?” Tony asked him, raising his voice this time around. Steve was plainly implying that he wasn’t either wise or pure.
“I don’t like goodbyes…”, Steve whispered as he hugged him close, and this time around, Tony didn't pull away or didn't react to it; he wrapped his own arms around Steve and smiled to him.
“For bringing me with you. And for.. showing me.. what love really is”, Steve replied with a confident tone, pulling back to look deep into the large, brown eyes with ever lasting adoration. “I love you, Tony Stark”
“Tony.. what exactly happened? Why do you have this..?”
Steve’s warm laugh, his casual words and friendly, understanding approach was exactly what Tony needed and he only responded by nodding quickly.
“I've met the Avengers there… speaking of the Avengers… I'm speeding up the work on the Tower, the top floor can be our… headquarters. Also, we’ll need a battle cry… how about Avengers Assemble?”
“Of course, Mr. Stark”, Steve said as he let go of him, turning his back to ride his motorcycle, a relieved and satisfied smile on his face.
Probably not what someone would is hanging for his life wants to hear, but he had to have faith in him, climbing back up was impossible.
Over the course of the next couple of days, he managed to get some electricity running in his apartment, using wires and every thing else he could salvage from the empty flats, feeling bad doing so. He couldn’t help but apologise to the non existing residents as he powered up his TV and radio, even though they weren’t very helpful and trusty. The radio however seemed easier to catch on the frequencies of the city, and that was exactly how he heard the news.
“I appreciate that offer, I’ll keep it in mind, thank you,” Tony replied with a chuckle. “What about you? What was your training? Did you go to Socrates’ school or something?”
Tony’s eyes widened; he didn’t know what was going on, if that was the both of them sort of confessing to each other in a way.
“That’s the Long IslandNationalCemetery”, Steve finished off, a heavy sigh coming out of his mouth as he sat back on the couch. “A graveyard..”
Tony couldn’t help but give Steve easier access to his neck, hand reaching back to wind into the blonde’s hair, not wanting Steve to part his lips from his skin. Nobody else was allowed that close to him, but Steve didn’t have to do anything more to have permission. Tony knew that he wanted Steve there to stay focused, to understand what was going on in his head and heart, how this simple man could change his way of thinking. And he found himself drawn to him, the man he pushed against a wall, the man who the fates wanted him to murder.
“How much do you know about the Infinity Gauntlet?”
“Is Captain America calling me beautiful, now?”, he asked with a smile, just to hide his blush.
“If you are implying that either of us knows who they are, you’re wrong,” Tony said. “You’re just like me, Steve. You’re lost; you don’t know what you really want or what your real purpose is. Brought down to Earth, but to do what? You are only suffering, I know, I’ve seen the way you look at others. I’m not trying to say that I know you, but I can feel what you are feeling too.”
Steve’s reply made Tony smile, and he was finally able to rest, eyes closing as he slowly drifted to sleep, still holding onto Steve.
Tony let out a quiet sigh as he admired the man’s beauty yet again, not managing to get over how handsome he looked in such a state. “Do you want me to, uh, lie next to you?”
He clenched his jaw tightly, lowering his shield even more and standing for a moment. “I came to offer help to you. Instead you violate my words and make me turn to this so that I can be heard. And yet you still don’t listen when I use your own methods of communication. What else am I to do?”
“I’m just enjoying watching you contradicting everything that you were preaching just a moment ago, Athenian. You speak of peace and justice when you barge into my house and attack me personally how is that even going to make you hear to what you’re saying?" Tony asked with a snort, moving around Steve. “You may still have time to run back home if you think fast.”
Tony held their faces together, kissing Steve deeply in return as his back tensed to keep him.  He really didn’t mind if Steve was unsure; this was far more than he had ever hoped for, and he was enjoying the man’s affection the way things were.
“I’ll try not to.” he said in an attempt to break the ice, after all, Tony wasn’t being hostile, he guessed that this was part of the man’s charm.
Tony’s eyes narrowed. Staged? His accident was staged? Confused, he carried on reading. What followed was a huge list of soldiers and their ranks, completed with their condition and when the ‘accident’ took place. He stared at the screen in horror as detailed reports of those ‘accidents’ were coming up, along with the names of the assets that staged them. It wasn’t hard at all to piece one and one together; that’s how the project got so many volunteers, they were selecting their victims, staging their accidents, ruining lives just so they could get this project running.
“What? No, not at all," he replied quickly. “I just wanted to say, you’re a great teacher." He felt his cheeks flushing at Steve being so intimate without even fully realising.
“But what if we create our own?” Tony murmured with a shake of his head. “Make our own customs, suited to an Athenian and Spartan demigod.”
“But you don’t have Ares as your father, it’s....different. He doesn’t follow logic, not when I try to reason with him," Tony tried to explain. “I’m not allowed to be myself around him, or any Spartan. And never mind, I thought that I could learn some things from you, and you from me. Teaching each other, just like you suggested. I don’t know about you, but I want to stick close to people, and they always seem to... disappear. I don’t know if it’s our blood, but they tend to vanish.”
Tony shook off his worries, focusing on the man’s face in front of him, this being the first time that he was him in a more submissive role, knowing that he never, ever done that for anyone else before, he would always be the one in charge, and yet he seemed to be actually wanting to be possessed, for once. He leaned forward, the delicate fingers gently rubbing him as they lowered the fabric, the metal that was between Tony’s fingers and the soft flesh preventing him from feeling its warmth, fixing his eyes on Steve’s face and expression instead.
“Can we do that?” Steve asked. “I thought only gods were allowed such privileges.”
Tony smiled when Steve took his hand, arriving at where the chariot was kept. It was truly fitting for him, and Tony patted the nearest horse’s mane, admiring how different they were from his own black ones. “Those are beautiful stallions, and the same goes for this chariot. The craftsmanship is remarkable," he noted.
Loving Steve Rogers could be classified as a Herculean labour. Sometimes Tony thought that fighting an army of Doombots or freeing the city from yet another villain attack was way easier than talking to the man he was in a relationship with.
Oh, how good it felt in his hands, finally!
Tony nodded; of course, being unconscious for so many decades would have its toll on Steve, and since he suffered from a selective case of insomnia, he could somewhat relate.
“I’m not claiming that I have changed,” Tony corrected, “I’m asking for a proper chance to prove myself. A real chance to change. You set the rules this time.”
“He’s dead.”, Steve cut Tony’s sentence. “Tony died… trying to save us… after I've told him what he did wrong.”
The argument around them carried on, and Steve stayed silent, looking deep inside the other man’s brown eyes. He was wrong; he was nothing like his father. Every moment that he spent living in this modern world only disappointed him more; people were nothing like the old days. They were selfish, only caring about their selves, and he honestly had no idea how this team could work out.
Tony gasped at how warm Steve was, slowly but steadily managing to move his finger deeper inside, feeling Steve's body draw him in. “Just listen to me, focus on me," he said again, giving Steve as soft kiss of encouragement before bringing a second finger close to his entrance, waiting until Steve stopped squirming to press it just below the first one to let Steve get used to the feeling.
“And what if I want to know you?” Tony rushed to ask. “You are an interesting person, that’s a fact.”
“Mr. Stark!”, one of the scientists, a short, ginger man yelled from behind the screens. “You have to see this!”
Tony looked at him once more; he seemed too calm, far too quiet but he preferred it over having to calm down a panicked man.
“You’ll pay for even daring to touch me!”
“Stark? Howard Stark’s son...?”
“I’m not asking you to tell me all his dark dirty secrets, just a few more words on the man who is funding a life changing project for me, that’s all.”
The moment when he heard his name being called, Tony couldn’t help but chuckle to himself; so Steve
Tony's heart sank as Steve denied their friendship.
“Take it as a social experiment of some sort,” Tony said. “We’re going to set our own rules. I say that you let your desires speak first, Athenian, then judge your actions.”
But there was something about this man that made him want to try. Tony seemed to actually want to help, but Steve’s paranoia wouldn’t allow him to listen. But that kiss, that gentle touch of Tony's lips against his skin, had been enough to change his mind somehow.
“Anything, what is it?”, Tony asked, turning his head at side to face him.
“Perhaps my friends had never liked me enough to let me,” Steve said, “or to kiss me like you have.” Steve felt younger again, he felt curious, his purpose to teach dissolving and his purpose to help Tony becoming higher on his list of priorities. But being the son of the Goddess of wisdom, he was eager to learn new things, to gain experience by first hand adventures. And kissing, to him, was a whole new concept - one that he liked and wanted to practice after years of watching others do the same.
Steve pulled him into his arms before Tony could even finish speaking, holding him so tightly, desperate to feel his warm body against his own. “I love you too..”
Steve frowned a little, enjoying the feeling a little too much. “Do you have to?”
Tony didn’t expect that kind of reaction, but he rubbed the back of his head, Jarvis already projecting the nearest route to the cemetery from the Tower. “Are you sure about that..?”
“Point proven, but you still want me around, right?” Tony asked.
“According to you, they are lost anyway. What I’m asking you is to trust me to try and offer my help,” Tony said, offering him his hand. “Can you do that?”
Tony couldn’t help but be surprised, but he smiled right away. Yes, he expected Steve to be ignorant when it came to the technology of those days, but he didn’t forget who he was, surely operating a coffee machine wasn’t rocket science.
That night, he was sitting near the bar, his chin resting on his hands as he was inspecting the regulars, making sure that his girls were doing their job and that everyone was pleased in general. Of course they were, the music was loud enough, the girls’ laugh was echoing, drinks were being served and the games of poker in the back seemed to go well. He sat up properly, fixing his dark red waistcoat and pushed his gelled hair back, casually walking over to the bar and getting a glass of whiskey for himself. He knew that people were talking about his alcoholism, but he thought that he damn deserved a break, and drinking did make him happy in the end of the day. He wasn’t really paying attention to the conversations, but something in particular raised his interest.
“Oh..wow..it’s hard to open my mouth”, he struggled to speak, swallowing down as soon as Steve brought the cup to his lips, letting him have a sip of the most chocolatey hot chocolate he ever tasted. His eyes widened to express his feelings towards it. “That’s..that’s definitely a fitting Christmas Eve hot chocolate - is this what you did today?”
“That’s funny! I’m bigger and stronger than you, Captain! You’re just a relic, you should make way for the new soldiers that this world needs! Go back into the pit where you belong!”, he growled in the same voice that made Tony shiver.
“Give credit to me?” He asked, leaning close to Tony. “For falling for your charms?”
“No, just helping my mother,” he said.
“And I’m sure that she would be proud of you..”, Tony added, not sure why he even said that.
Steve shook his head. “A man should not fear the judgement of his people, and his own freedom should prevail,” he recited, keeping his head turned away from Tony.
Tony hesitated for a moment before letting Steve pull him up and walk with him back in the huge bedroom. He noticed how Steve seemed to be scanning the room; it was the first time that the soldier found himself there, it sure must have made an impression. Laying back on the bed, he instinctively grabbed Steve’s hand when the blond turned away.
“Such as?” Tony asked with pure curiosity, turning to look at Steve while he talked.
“I'm not letting you go.”, Steve repeated himself.
Steve gazed, following Tony’s finger and piecing the constellations together. “I don’t see many but they are beautiful. One day I wish to touch one, just to capture their beauty,” he said. “You know, when you see something so beautiful you just need to hold it?”
“I didn’t think you believed in that love-dovey stuff-”, Tony started to protest, but Steve was gone already, returning shortly after with a light coloured padlock on his hand. He turned his back at him, taking out a couple of markers from his bag and started to draw something. Tony was the one who insisted for him to carry those around, in case he wanted to practice his drawing inspired by the scenery.
“Right, so I’ll fly by at..the same time tomorrow? Leave your window a bit open this time around.”
Tony smiled to him in return. “No need to thank me, I said it again.. I want to help you in every way I can, and the fact alone that you acknowledge it is good enough for me”
“If you want to pay back a debt you can send gold, goats, anything that you deem appropriate, but being intimate with me isn’t repaying that,” Tony said. “Is that why you’re staying? To save your people, after I told you that I’m going to do it anyway? Your teaching is more than enough; consider this my being a human.”
“Excuse my manners, I seem to forget how delicate you Athenians are most of the time," he replied with yet another smirk, setting the end of his spear on the floor. “And why are you here, oh son of Athena?”
“So… how is your Steve?”, he asked him, crossing his arms.
Steve stepped closer to him, rubbing Tony's chest lightly, just over the chain. “Then I am grateful for it.”
“I’m sure,” Steve said, balancing his scrolls in one arm. “Lead the way.”
“Now you see, that’s where you’re wrong, Rogers, don’t you get it?”, Tony snapped. “You tried to talk me into how important is that people talk about their problems when they are into a committed relationship, lectured me so much when I was hiding things from you and right now you think you can make me forget all about that. You’re not going anywhere, you’re going to talk to me about the nightmares. We’re supposed to help each other, how am I supposed to feel good when you’re not letting me pay you back for all the good you’ve done? You’re not a soldier when it’s just us, Steve. You don’t have to do all this alone, I’ll help”. He sat down, next to Steve, looking at him in a way that would force an answer out of him.
Steve pulled away, getting out of the bed to wrap his tunic around his waist clumsily before darting over to Falcon, grabbing his shield from the floor as he did. “This is was a misunderstanding,” he said in a flustered tone.
Tony broke the kiss to lick his lips, wanting to go further. But he decided to focus fully on Steve instead, rubbing his nose against Steve’s cheek. “We can either stay like this...or you’ll have to turn around," he said to him, with a shake of his head. “Around will be less painful. If you want this. Either way. I’m fine with whatever you choose.”
“Can you see this? This is because of you, Tony. You are giving those people hope, their lives back”, he said confidently.
Pepper seemed to notice the first name bases and raised an eyebrow, but didn’t really question it.
“You know..you see a few things over your life that make you reevaluate what you’ve been doing, what you’ve been offering to the world. With the weapons I was developing, I was doing more harm than good.. Sure, I could keep our country safe, but what about rebuilding what’s been broken, what about offering people second chances? I had a second chance offered to me, I wanted to do the same to others...”
“You’re spending the night here, right?”
“It would take time, money, organization...” Tony said with a sigh. “I’ll have to talk to someone about this, see if they really want it." His opinion regarding war, and the will of his Father, was always heard. But when it came to the ruling of the city, his involvement wasn’t really appreciated.
“That was..too easy”, he admitted. “It doesn’t usually go down like this, there’s gunfight, a pursuit-”
His thoughts were interrupted by Tony’s voice, who seemed to be eager to point outside the window at something. Steve slowly turned his eyes on the glass window, his expression changing into a confused one. This couldn’t be his home..it looked nothing like it, from the sky high skyscrapers to the fuming factories that seemed to tower the streets.
“Aren’t you celebrating with the rest?”, Steve asked as he gave him a look of acknowledgement.
Tony looked up at him, always looking for that kind of approval. He didn't want to hurt Steve, or scare him away when he'd been so expressive lately. “Steve?” he asked in a husky voice, his other hand moving up to rub those naked shoulders as he admired the man’s structure and pale skin. “Is everything all right?"
The car pulled on the side of the pavement next to the Eiffel  Tower, Tony putting on his dark sunglasses as the warm summer sun embraced them, with Steve staring into the giant metallic structure above them.
“I've seen enough, Reed.”, Steve replied as he turned his head away; that was exactly how Tony initially fell; he watched him falling from the sky, and by the time that he crashed on the ground, he was gone. To see his death replaying over and over again would do no good to him.
“I’m sorry that I doubted you. Should have figured out that were was no way that you would be behind this..”
“You’re right. They’re building weapons of mass destruction, I want to know why”, Steve demanded. “I ran off on my own, your computer was moving too slowly”, he added, dropping the gun with a large sound on the desk.
Some privacy would have been greatly appreciated, the day was emotional and so important to him, he just wanted to spend some time doing the simplest tasks with the use of his legs again. The unwanted attention wasn’t a thing he appreciated either, and he was relieved to see Happy coming through and clearing the way towards the exit of the building for him. He didn’t realise that Tony was following them until he slipped inside the car and the billionaire was sitting next to him.
“Why? I’m glad with what we’ve done already," Tony replied.
“If it’s funny, yes”, the billionaire chuckled.
“You feel nothing like I do,” Steve growled back. “Don’t ever try and tell me you understand.”
Tony smiled at him. “Thank you,” he said with a nod. “That means a lot coming from you. I hope I’m not going to disappoint you any further.”
Steve let out another huff and let go after a while, looking around the different papers on the desk. “Do I have to carry you downstairs, or are you going to come on your own free will, Stark? I’m cooking dinner”, he asked, with an expression that dared Tony to disagree.
“Steve..”, Tony groaned as he looked at the man approaching.
“Really? What happened?” Tony asked again, and then he saw how shy Steve seemed to be. “You know, dreams are mostly signs sent from the gods.”
The soldier nodded as he turned his back and walked close to the glass window, not really looking outside, but wanting to make Tony believe that he was indeed somewhat busy.
What he saw left him speechless. It was a complete blast from the past; the apartment seemed untouched to strangers like Tony, but Steve knew that someone else has been inside throughout the years. Maybe not to actually live here, but surely to steal things. Upon further inspection, he noticed that one of the drawers in his small living room was broken, where he kept his savings. Not that he cared at that moment; money was the least of his worries for once.
“Because they are nothing like your women, Athenian, or any other Greek women. They are proud, they wouldn’t allow anyone to uh, violate them without knowing what would come afterwards. And as you know, I’m not married yet.”
The stranger seemed to be eyeing Steve, almost like he recognised him, which did attract Steve’s interest more. Maybe they did know each other in whatever universe he came from, which would make their communication easier.
“I want a tour of the facilities first. And meet everyone involved. Then I can give you my final answer”, he decided, his arms crossed, his look stern and decisive.
“Acquaintances, slip of the tongue,” Tony fixed his words quickly, shaking his head and mentally slapping himself for jumping in conclusions.
“And who says that I haven’t, that mine aren't? You don’t know a thing about Spartan training, do you? I walked up snowy mountains every morning and then washed up myself in the show that I stepped on,” he replied with a proud smirk.
“Really? The only way for you to come into my room is for me to get a tooth removed?”
“I’m no common siren, Athenian. I’m trying to help you and you don’t want my help, you want to give up and die like a hero, but you know what? Knowing what is going to happen and not trying to change it doesn’t make you a hero. A hero is born when he defeats all odds and does his best to change what’s written in stone, and that’s what I’m going to go. You might choose to run back to Athens and mourn what’s not even lost, but I’m going to fight,” he said as he let go. “With or without you.”
Tony wrapped his arms around Steve and held him close, tilting his head to give Steve better access, his fingers later moving up to Steve's head and into his hair as he let out soft whimpers of satisfaction.
Steve held his shield over Tony, defending himself and the man from the arrows. “You... You don’t! You don’t love me! You would’ve said it in front of them if you did!” Steve yelled back.
Steve used a bit more force, swinging the shield at Tony to knock him back again,
The blonde didn’t seem to particularly react, maybe he was in shock and still processing the details, but he just stared at the billionaire.
“And...?”
“You may continue I will just... Find elsewhere,” Steve said, trying not to look at Tony and his well-toned body.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “Well, you better start those kicking exercises first, champ”
The bearded man was holding a glass in one hand, and by the smell of it, it must have been some good bourbon, and on the other hand he was holding firmly a small square device. He had to squint and take a better look at it, all by making sure that Tiny wasn’t aware of him staring. The little device seems to project numbers and images to Tony, and even though it was hard for him to tell what it was showing exactly, the other man seemed genuinely concerned about what he was viewing. He couldn’t help but question everything, but he knew he had to wait; the shock after seeing his city for so long would have been bigger than finding out about a strange little device that could project all kinds of things.
“I.. I guess I am..”, Steve whispered, hearing some noise coming from under the Tower. “What is happening..?”
“I’m sorry about that..”, Tony said slowly, facing Steve who seemed reluctant of wanting to talk. “If you need to talk, I’m here to-”
Tony shook his head, the bolt of thunder answering for him anyway. “The son of Zeus. Yet another son of the all-father," he said, even though he didn’t dare to add a snort to his sentence; threatening the gods was never admirable. “And the Cupid behind you? Who is that?” he said, pointing at the smaller man, wrapping an arm around Steve.
Tony chuckled, throwing Steve the device, who did what he did best - smashed it on the ground and placed his hands on his waist.
Oh, yeah.
“I’ve seen the footage. The only thing you really fight for is yourself”, the Captain continued.
“To replicate the serum,of course. We have our super soldier right here, we can start right away. Imagine a new breed of super soldiers, all thanks to you two! Tony, this is your greatest discovery, this will go down in history because you made it possible”, he said, lifting his hands up in the air in excitement. “Think of it, all the other countries buying the serum to build up super soldiers.. from us. Talk about a comeback at the weapon market!”
Steve swallowed down; there was no point struggling with words any longer, and leaning closer one last time, his lips met Tony’s.
Steve turned around to the source of that voice, facing exactly who he expected it to be.
Steve took a deep breath. “Because of…me… you and me… I mean, my Tony, we had a huge argument. He erased my memories so I couldn't stop him and the rest of his other team from destroying an Earth to save our own. The secret was out, I got angry, I yelled, we fought, I told him that I'm over him… He took it to himself to fix this, to prove me wrong and…”, he trailed off.
“So, Captain Rogers.. are you still the super soldier Howard helped you to be?”
“We can?” Steve asked, his interest piqued as he glanced up from the kisses.
Before he knew it, he was smothered in a different hug, kissed all over and carried to their shared bedroom, only to wake up the next morning to an empty bed.
And, atop Mount Olympus, The two gods opposed one another constantly, bickering, causing conflict amongst their people, and creating a grudge that they would carry for many centuries to come.
“Ah, you should be careful with what you’re saying, Herr Rogers. We are the ones who made you walk, again, remember? We can easily.. take that away”
“Is that it? You just saw a fairy, a real one, and you are just going to go back to sleep? Are you not interested in the slightest about me?”
Tony turned at him as he felt Steve’s warm hand against his own, their fingers lacing and steadily holding his hand. It felt warm, safe to be there. The people behind this were all behind bars now, and he came out of it victorious, with not only the dream that he dreamed, giving people a better life, but also with a unique partner who understood him like nobody else.
“Sheriff Rogers, reporting in”, the blonde man finally said, turning his gaze to Tony. He didn’t have a thick, strong accent, but Tony could still detect his Irish roots in it, especially when he pronounced his name. “And you are..?, he asked.
“Subtle doesn’t seem the Spartan way,” Steve muttered, noticing how Tony moved. “You may stay on your resting place; there is no need for you to join me here.”
“I’d rather be on the ground than walk again because of you!”, Steve spat out.
The smile on the scientists’ faces seemed fake, eerie, but the firm handshake and approval that he received from Tony looked genuine enough to him.
Tony had yelled for him, rushing closeby while making sure that he didn’t slip either, sighing in relief when he saw the blonde holding on a piece of vine.
His words were cut short as soon as he was pushed against the wall by Steve, a dark shadow tainting the soldier’s eyes.
Tony pulled a face. He was already feeling better; Steve’s presence worked miracles on him in a way he couldn’t explain. “Maybe.”
In the centre of the room, a mannequin with his first outfit he wore as Captain America was standing, next to his first shield, battered up but still in a relatively good state. Even though he spoke so harshly to Tony when he made reference to his Captain status, he couldn’t help but walk closer, admiring his old uniform. He could see everything, threads that were sticking out, some of the marks bullets and blood left on it, the stench of war still present, at least to the person who wore that uniform for years. His hands reached for the shield, caressing it and feeling just like the first time he picked it up; it felt like it belonged to him from day one, that he was a natural with it, as he proved later on.
“Oh, I know he does”, Tony nodded. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he tried to get rid of me to take over the company, hence the need for a bodyguard”
“Steve”, he said firmly. “Look at me, eyes on me”, he ordered.
Steve kept his eyes down on the scrolls. “Do you not want me to?” he asked.
Steve shook his head, falling quiet again as his fingertips strayed through his hair to push it back. “I suppose not. ‘A person cannot change, especially a Spartan,' ” he quoted.
“What? There’s nothing to worry about.”, Tony said calmly, walking around his desk.
The natural thing to do was to offer his help to him, he could only imagine how lost he felt at that moment, but somewhat acting friendly seemed both unprofessional and a bit intimidating, seeing that Steve’s behaviour so far didn’t make him exactly approachable. But the way he stood near the desk, jaw clenched and his fingers formed in a fist, made Tony feel compassion. He knew how it felt to be lost, but it sure wasn’t comparable of what the soldier was feeling at that moment.
Steve bit down hard on his lower lip, so hard that it turned white, and he looked over his shoulder to nod at Tony as he shifted on his knees in response to the pressure on his lower back. He wanted to signal that he was ready, but it was hard to keep his moans quiet as he felt Tony's fingers moving inside him, trying to fight the tightness of the muscle.
“You’re not getting out of here alive, Tony!”
Tony stared at his hands when Steve grabbed the scrolls away, not really wanting to show how that discouraged him. After all, he was trying to show a different side of himself now that he was away from his people. They expected him to be bloodthirsty, all day, every day, and that was probably the impression that Steve got of him. But it wasn't one he wanted to project now. “No, stay here if you want, I’m going now," he said quickly. “You were here first.”
He chuckled, and my God, was that the chuckle of an angel, if angels even did laugh like that. It certainly was contagious though, and managed to give him a bit more courage, leaning closer and pushing Tony’s hair away from his forehead.
He wasn't just facing one body, he was facing at least five of them, all resting on tables, all of them battered up and covered in dried blood. The nearest body of Tony Stark had a large bullet wound on the centre of his forehead, another one had red marks all around his neck.
Tony waking up covered in sweat and panting heavily seemed to be a common occurrence in the newly rebuilt Avengers Tower. At first, he was dealing with it alone, waking up in the middle of the night and trying to calm himself down, reminding himself that all those were memories that he was trying to repress, that he was safe from Iron Mongers, terrorists, aliens and Extremis enchanted soldiers that would spit fire.
Rather begrudgingly, he did end up removing his chest plate and then the rest of the armour. “If I had some music playing, maybe this would be more fun for both of us”, he half joked, earning a confused quick look from Steve, and he could have sworn that he did a double take once Tony was just in those white undies, before turning his attention to his shield once more.
Steve raised his hand from the water and gently rubbed Tony’s cheek, looking at him through the steam that rose from the bath. “I hope I see him more often, especially in front of your people,” he said. “He is no tyrant, not at all.”
“This is old.. really old, but I know how it works. In theory.. but it’s not hard at all, I’m a tech genius, after all”, he said confidently. It was true, he never saw a projector like that functioning before, they were all locked up in museums or gathered by collectors of antiques. He didn’t seem to get it to work though, despite trying out all its basic functions. “Gimme a minute or two..”
All alone left with his memores. All alone in an empty room with nobody else to be there for him. Alone.
“Come on, mine are non-existent,” Tony encouraged, nodding enthusiastically. “I won’t mock you, I promise.”
Tony chuckled softly. He couldn’t let Steve know how desperate he was for proper friends, someone other than Rhodey, or how fascinating he found the Athenian. “Well, you need to get to know us better,” he said with a shrug. “We’re not just interested in killing things. We can be quite friendly. Well, I can, and about that… I don’t think we should let them know.”
“I didn’t know.” Steve said shaking his head, his long blonde locks moving with the simple head movement. “I thought you have a different custom here, you said we were friends.”
“What? Stars are festive...”
“If I return to Athens, it will be with all of me intact, Spartan.” He bent his knees slightly, eyes focused on Tony, darting down and looking at the glowing medallion momentarily before moving up to meet his eyes again.
Steve stood up too, brushing the folds out of his tunic and picking up his scrolls, glancing over at Tony. “You did?” he asked with surprise, though he knew that Tony did from the way he'd been laughing.
“We’re here today at the Brooklyn Veteran Affairs Hospital where Tony Stark and Stark Industries are introducing what it seems to be a stepping stone for cybernetics and prosthetics for people of all ages in need.”
“Big man in a suit of armour, take that off, what are you?”, Steve asked, stopping in front of the other man, looking down at him, waiting for an answer.
Tony didn’t even know why he loved all this simplicity in a way so much, it made him feel safe. Steve wasn’t just there until he would find something better, he chose to be in a relationship with him because he wanted to. He liked it when they cuddled, when they would spend hours watching movies or when Steve would bake or draw and Tony would just look in silence, praising him from time to time. He loved it when he would rub Steve’s arm gently when he rest his head on his chest, or the way he would move closer to him once they were awake. Every little thing that he did was noticed and appreciated, and that’s when Tony realised; he was truly in love, Steve was the one.
“I just found out now, I swear, I had nothing to do this with-”
Better now than never, wasn’t that a saying? Or was it something else and he got it all mixed up, unable to think clearly when it felt like his head was on fire, like the helmet was pressing against his temples, acting like a wicked hot prison of sorts. With some struggle, he managed to free himself, and as soon as he took a deep breath of fresh air, the heat rays just stopped. No, it was too late to go back now, and he probably looked like a mess, not like the usual Tony Stark that Steve knew, mullet and beard well kept.
“I think the others might have figured something out. About your condition. Come on boy, let’s go”, he said, hitting his hip.
Steve walked back into the room, his hair neatly pushed back, allowing his chiselled facial features to be more the centre of focus.
“What happened… How did I…?”
Kang raised his hands in the air. “Not what you expected, Iron Man? Maybe I should persuade you even further.”
“So, no magical powers?”
Yet, he was still up there. The huge wave that was released pushed him back, falling down the void. The call to Pepper failed, and taking one last look at the alien ship being destroyed, he closed his brown eyes, dignified and ready to face the end.
Steve raised his head, looking over at the men before grabbing his tunic to cover his body and Tony’s.
Tony’s rubbed his chin in interest, it was about time that they sent someone down, and he was getting impatient. It was the local law, the Sherriff had to stop by the saloon for a welcoming drink, and all that Tony had to do was wait. He put on his jacket and fixed his shirt, wanting to look formal enough for the newcomer and nodded at Thor in his corner, whose hat hid his watchful eyes. Soon he was going to be offered a drink and he would ask for Tony’s permission to sit down and relax for a bit.
Tony listened to him intently, eyes widening at the large structure. People were already arriving and he was surprised when he was told that there was no entrance fee at all. “You know, I think my people could do with watching a play by Aristophanes, I heard they can be very enlightening. Oh, look! They're going to do the Birds! I heard that’s a good one," Tony said, unable to conceal his excitement any longer.
His boxers were being slipped off, revealing his protruding hip bones and even more, letting out a quick gasp as he felt the cold metal fingers touch his body. The movements seemed so real, and each moment he kept his eyes shut he imagined Tony doing this. He never had the strength to be the one on the bottom but he was curious, he was just scared of being judged, but this was a suit so he could do anything, it wasn’t real.
