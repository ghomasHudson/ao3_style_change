There was no sight of Bucky. He had vanished along with the remainder of Hydra agents. Steve and Tony had focused on the most important thing in their lives: Peter, and left the base unharmed.
Twenty minutes into E.T. Sam and Scott walked in, carrying five closed and one half opened bag of takeout. "You two order these?" Sam asked, through a mouthful of chicken, "A guy outside was ringing the buzzer for ages, before me and Scotty, here, turned up."
The cold, sharp point of a knife being dragged across his skin brought him back to reality. It didn't cut deeply, just enough to scar over. He moaned in pain: leaning back in his chair. He tried not to scream, to cry out in pain to the people who would do nothing but laugh at his current state. He couldn't show how scared he really was - it was a Stark trait; you have to put on an act around those you don't trust.
“Tell me, Bucky... you’ve seen a great deal, haven’t you?” He grinned, showing his perfectly-white teeth. His phone vibrated; a message popped up on its screen.
"The fact Captain America and Iron Man are going on a mission together," he replied nonchalantly. "It's hilarious, you should check it out."
Peter exhaled before replying to both his Dad and Ross. "I'm fine, Dad... honest. If this keeps us on the right side of the law, I'll do it."
"Go on," Tony said, whilst tapping his feet rhythmically against the floor. He started to click a pen, but was stopped by the glare his Captain sent towards him.
Bucky hastily finished his mouthful of slightly burnt toast, wiping the butter off of his face. "What like all the time, or a half an half agreement?"
Tony sat down, slightly embarrassed with himself. What if all of his frustration led to Steve getting custody of Peter, forever? That would tear at the brunet's chest - leaving an empty space, a theoretical one that could never be patched up, or filled in. He could hide it - just like he hid the real hole in his chest, the one that kept him alive. But it would be useless, the only way the man could hide his problems was with drinking: something he was trying to stop.
"117 countries want to sign this! 117, Sam, and you're just like," Rhodey made his voice raise an octave, "No, that's cool. We got it"?
The five headed down a walkway, the usually breathtaking view ruined by the atmosphere of what had happened. The crystal barrier between them and the outside world let in so much light that it would have been impossible to make the ten minute walk feel dark... yet it still felt like rain was crashing down as Steve set foot across it.
She was very pretty. Her eyes were a deep, emerald green and her was a mix of auburn and chestnut locks - which were tied up in a ponytail. However, Peter saw something beneath her freckled skin. Something secret... something bad.
Peter sunk into his seat. "Everything's really loud. I can barely concentrate on anything. Every little feeling feels magnified, and I don't know why."
Fury shook his head. "I can, and, I will. Hydra's still out there and I need to do something about it."
When he awoke, Peter was also beginning to stir: with the boy occasionally sitting upright and rubbing his eyes, before lying back down. "Morning, Pete," the billionaire said softly, pulling himself up from the seat.
"You okay, Stevie?" he whispered, willing to wrap his arms around the shaking soldier - the only thing stopping him being the formality of the event.
"This is nice," Pepper complimented as she began to cut up the steak on her plate. Peter smiled at her approval, nodding in agreement. His dad had apparently slaved away in the kitchen for the last two hours and it had paid off: the entire arrangement tasted divine. Ned seemed to be enjoying it too, as his eyes had quite literally widened with amazement when he saw what Tony had prepared.
Putting Tony on hold, Steve swiftly clicked onto Bucky's phone number. He waited for the dialling  tone to end but it didn't. Instead he was left with the generic voicemail.
"I mean," Steve paused and took a breath. "I mean that I don't want our son going 'round the country in a suit running headfirst into danger."
The Xbox... The Gameboy. The television. The headset. Ned! Okay, so now things that he could feel. He could feel his clothes, the headset in his hands and the floor beneath his socks. He could hear Ned's breathing, the sound of the headset powering down... and, was that the Imperial March?
Steve leant against the wall, trying to calm his now-heavy breathing with its icy chill. His phone was still in his hand, the case shattering in his firm grip. The message was still on the screen...
Peter tried to cry for help but his screams were muffled by Bucky - no, the Winter Soldier's, metal arm. He could barely breathe. Every step he was forced to take caused a burning pain to shoot throughout his chest. They walked down so many corridors, which all had the same grey walls and white lights, that Peter was beginning to think that Bucky was making him trek through an entire labyrinth just to get to this 'room'. To be honest, he was impressed that his lungs hadn't burst by the time they reached the Dark Room.
Peter sighed, picking at a few of the French fries from the plate on his bed. They were golden, lightly salted and seemed to have some sort of herbal marinate on them: nothing like the fries his Pops has ever made before.
"Are you sure about this, kiddo?" Tony asked, wishing he hadn't given the boy a chance to make his own decision. The Accords would be fine for him... but for a vigilante, who still had a life to live, was it really such a great idea?
Peter glanced over to his friend, watching as Ned's eyes lit up. His friend was a huge Iron Man fan so obviously this was going to be a huge deal for him. "Oh my god," Ned whispered to Peter, "Tony Stark said we're on a first name basis."
"Well, the people who think you did are coming here now. And they're not planning on taking you alive," Steve informed Bucky.
Peter let go a sigh of relief, when he was thrown into a small room. Sure, it wasn't much - just a two by two cell, with unnaturally white walls and lights that burnt his eyes, but it was better than his previous accommodations.
Peter didn't reply. He didn't have to, did he? There were no laws saying that a prisoner had to speak, had to comply. The fourteen year old was also rather hoping it had been rhetorical: the only comeback he had was sure to end up with him serving some sort of punishment.
"And you and Mr Metal Arm aren't also a rebound couple? Excuse me for thinking but I believe it's been over half a year since we broke up. This isn't rebound. Your's was rebound-"
That was Nat. She sounded slightly shaken, maybe even shocked, but other than that she seemed okay. "You alright?" Steve asked, his fingers crossed for good news.
The brunet walked over to the teen, and swiftly removed the cuffs. Then he held firmly onto Peter's collar, his grip barely allowing the teen to breathe.
Playfully irritated, Peter chanted in a tone that made it sound like Tony was forcing him to say it, "I loved it, it was really well-cooked."
Bucky shook his head. "I killed him, and his wife - Maria, I think. They were my mission. I never fail a mission..." he exclaimed, turning to face away from his boyfriend. He couldn't bring himself to look at the blond. He would feel too guilty. Too ashamed.
Glaring at him, Steve continued, "And despite him having many PhDs, none of them affect his abilities at parenting a child. In the past, I was always the parent who looked after Peter, cooked food and all that. Tony... well he just put him in dangerous situations."
The teen was cut short by the gunshot. He had just been taken down by one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s preferred  weapons. An Icer... or as the creator of them - Leo Fitz - liked to call them: Night Night Guns. They don't kill, they just knock you out. A better weapon for those who want to do right in the world, or for those who want to kidnap the son of two Avengers.
"Well sorry, it's not my fault that I haven't got much experience asking them. I can only remember today thanks to-"
Tony stormed into the lounge, throwing his briefcase onto the countertop. He ignored both Clint and Peter's greetings and headed towards the kitchen area. He picked up a bottle champagne, opening it in an instance, before taking a swig.
That would work. Peter could come live with him part of the time, and with Tony the rest of it. They'd be a happy family, eventually. Steve was sure it work, sure Tony would understand.
"I know but for some reason the government never seem to trust me. They always side with the patriotic Captain America over the reckless Iron Man..."
Stunned, the kid replied with, "Uh, sure." He has also seen how badly Peter was acting. He was a good friend and knew when to leave.
Peter heard both men laugh so hard it reverberated through the room, until they calmed down and took deep breaths.
Tony put his hands on his son's shoulders, "Pete... you've been moved from family before-" He never got to finish his words, he never got to say how it would be different this time because Steve was his Pops.
Steve didn't like the idea of an actual cell but the idea of being in a room with the order not to leave it still felt as much a prison as the real thing. His eyes wandered to T'Challa's, who was just about to speak.
Steve raised his hands in surrender, "I can play. I just like to plan out my strategy first... And Bucky likes to play speed chess."
"You alright, buddy?" the philanthropist asked Peter, stroking the boy's hair out of his eyes. He could see Steve sat down at the booth in the far corner, a glass of alcohol placed in front of him.
Peter nodded and started fiddling with his new shooters, as Tony picked up his phone. "Hey... Steve."
He might never see him again. And no one would ever no where he was, no one would ever be able to find him.
Steve put his cell in his pocket, exhaling as he did. Bucky looked at him, his face emotionless - like he couldn't decide on how to reassure his friend.
"You're lucky you are still technically injured, otherwise I might have had to come over there and tickled you, Mister," Tony replied. He raised his hands, miming the movements in jest.
Oh, Stark hated that laugh. He hated that man. However, sometimes the genius had to set an example of himself. A good example... He couldn't avoid the UN forever, he might as well listen now whilst he still had a chance of keeping the suits.
The silence left Tony anxious. Steve usually dealt with this kind of stuff; he was the fun parent - Steve was the parental one.
Steve nodded in understanding. "I see. That base they located a few weeks ago, is that still in operation or did we weed that out?"
and smiled when the photo of his Dad started to glow on the screen. It was of Tony and Peter from the premiere of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, back on the eight of August the year before. They had gone for Peter's birthday, which was two days later - and it was one of the best non-sci-fi movies he had seen. Peter had eaten a giant tub of Ben & Jerry's ice cream, the one named after his Dad: Stark Raving Hazelnut, And had felt a little queasy afterwards.
The other man was only a few cars behind, leaping at the same pace as the sergeant. He then leapt onto the car Steve was driving. The Captain swerved from side to side,  trying to throw him off but it was useless.
Steve sat down on the couch, a plate of avocado on toast in his hand. "Whatcha watching, Buck?" the blond asked, his eyes averting to the television in front of him.
"Yeah, maybe it was a good idea." Then, Steve added, "Well, I better be off. See you later. Love you!" He walked out of the room.
"Soldier," Zemo said, ignoring the boy's pleads and cries for help, "Secure the boy, make sure he doesn't escape before we return to the compound."
Stretching out her arms, the assassin got Ross' attention just as he began to exit the room. "And if we come to a decision you don't like?" she asked.
The man at the door smiled. He was clean shaven, his hair gelled to the right. "May I come in? It's about...," he looked over at the picture of Steve and a small child, "Peter."
"I didn't realise you liked her in that way," Steve continued, trying to piece together everything about Pepper and Tony that he could, in his mind. "But, I can kinda see it working. She's got a lot to work with."
Tony tiptoed into the room, leaving the door wide enough for a small ray of light to appear on the bed. Luckily, it wasn't in Peter's eyes as the young boy was sure to wake up at the first sign of a glimmer or a glow. The brunet let out a deep breath, which he didn't even know he was holding, as Peter rolled over onto his side. The teen had been asleep ever since they let him out of the medical ward. Despite his many months asleep, he was still extremely worn out.
"Pete, I have to go... Pepper will kill me if I don't get ready for my expo tomorrow," Tony admitted, as the two headed back to Steve's apartment.
"Do you think I'll be alright? You know, at the whole 'being an influence to a child' thing?" Bucky asked worriedly, and Steve chuckled.
"As long as you're not the one making them," teased Peter, regretting his sny comment almost instantly. Steve tugged the blanket off of the teen and started tickling the vulnerable child. "Pops! Stop! Please! Stop!" he protested, squirming away from the blond.
Steve sighed. He took another step towards his boyfriend, or at least towards the man, who resembled him. The thoughts were all gone. All those happy memories were yet to resurface from the depths of Bucky's mind. "You pulled me from the river... why?"
Tony blanked him and continued to run tests on a red liquid, which appeared to be blood. Whose blood: Steve didn't know, but it seemed to be important to Tony. What if it was Tony's blood? What if he was seriously ill? "Tones," Steve repeated, "What are you doing?"
Peter tried to ignore the comment, and hurried over to where the rest of the class were stood. Katie was showing them a contained, glass cage - that was filled with hundreds of blue and red spiders.
Peter glanced around the room, and was soon to realise that his old clothes were gone. The last bit of home he had been able to cling to was gone. Even his watch, the one his Dad had given him for his most recent birthday (a rolex, which had been tinkered with repeatedly) was gone. He probably wouldn't get them back; there was no point in trying to 'look on the bright side of things' because nobody even knew he was here. No one except the man that his Pops has trusted. That he had trusted. That had brought this fate upon him.
"Thanks, Dad," the boy whispered, leaning against his father's shoulder. "I don't blame you. It's not your fault. You didn't do anything. It was all Mister Criminal's fault."
What were Peter's favourite colours, he wondered, whilst working on the overall aesthetics of the suits appearance. Blue? Yes that was one. "Oh, and red", he said, aloud by accident.
It couldn't have been more than seven in the morning when Peter woke up, bleary-eyed with a knot in a muscle in his neck from the awkward angle he had been resting his head. He was positioned on the couch half-sitting, half laying down in a way that suggested he had been painstakingly moved into a comfortable position after falling asleep on someone's shoulder. All of these thoughts were floating about in the back of his head, however, as he couldn't bring himself to shake the sleepy fog from his mind. He was floating somewhere between consciousness and being dead asleep, hearing and feeling everything around him but not particularly caring either way. As long as what he was sleeping on was vaguely horizontal and not made of radioactive spiders, Peter Stark-Rogers could sleep just fine.
"And," the man continued, "I'm sure you've already met our most valued asset. He's been away from his home far too long."
Ross patted the kid firmly on the shoulder, causing Tony to shudder. "You've got yourself a smart kid, Stark. Maybe you should take some advice from him." The General laughed.
MJ moved over so that she was stood on the other side of Ned, but Peter carried on intensely watching the spiders. They mesmerised him; the small, colourful arachnids scuttling around their closed enclosure.
"I'm okay... I think I'm gonna sleep with all my old toys - in my room, if that's okay with you... but apart from that I'm fine."
"Yes they are!" Tony chuckled. He hadn't seen Peter this happy in what seemed like forever, but he knew this was only a cover up - or at least a temporary state of mind. Suddenly, and he didn't know how soon, the teen would remember about Steve and the walls of protection Tony had placed around him would crumble down.
"I felt like I got bitten. It was around the spider container in there. But I didn't, it was probably just because Katie, the tour guide, told us one was missing."
Eventually Steve gave in to the silence, bringing a plate of grilled chicken, fries and a side of salad into the room. "Kiddo, you're hungry. I can hear your stomach growling from the other room."
Kissing Steve quickly on the forehead, the brunet quickly pulled his arm away from his boyfriend, and glanced at the door: his hearing picking up on the incoming footsteps. Yet, they were too light to be Tony's, and he doubted that the man had sent Peter in alone.
Peter shoved Tony away, his super strength sending his Dad a few metres back. "It isn't, though. You're sending me away. You're not even putting up a fight. You're meant to be Iron Man but you can't even protect me."
For the next ten minutes of the ride home, Peter struggled against Tony, failing to escape from the painful torture being endured upon him. "Stop!" He exclaimed, after he could take no more. For some reason the tickles felt eleven times worse than usual - making it harder to stand the pain.
Steve shoved his boyfriend playfully... boyfriend. Did he just call Bucky his boyfriend? Take a deep breath, Rogers, you can do this. "Bucky..."
Peter glanced up at Bucky, his eyes wide in terror. Yet, they closed as soon as Zemo shot something into his skin -  a needle, perhaps - and he fell limp to the floor.
Peter looked down at his trembling hands, hurrying to hide them behind his back. "Fine. Maybe I do do that when I lie."
Again clickingkey-boards has helped out with this chapter. We all really owe it to her that I'm able to get this story out on time.
Tony raised an eyebrow at his son's nickname for Zemo. "Mister Criminal? You've got heart, kiddo. You really see the best in people. Even when they are insane psychopaths."
Recognising the sorrow in his Pops' ocean-like eyes, Peter decided it was probably best to reply. "Because... because you took me away from Dad. I wouldn't of minded living part time, but this... this isn't what I want."
Eventually, he forgot that people could be watching and picked up the bowl, drinking directly from it until he had drained it entirely. The water was lukewarm and quite disgusting, but Peter still drank all of it until the glass was empty, not even thinking about how he may have to save the food and make it last.
The force that had turned the ceiling into the floor suddenly weakened, causing Peter to plummet to the ground. "Oh great," he muttered to himself just before his head smashed against the floor.
Peter opened his eyes, his consciousness slowly returning to him. His wrists were being held by vibranium cuffs -  which were chained to the concrete ceiling. And, his ankles were fastened in the same way, however instead of being connected to the ceiling, they were attached to the wall.
"Am not!" Bucky protested, and Steve shushed him - jokingly pressing his hand against his boyfriend's mouth for a second.
The man laughed, "You see, Peter, he does indeed have to do this. It's in his programming to follow his master's orders."
Zemo grinned, placing his hand on Peter's mess of brown hair and combing his cold fingers through the curls. "Oh yes you are, актив/asset... oh yes you are."
"I know, it's okay. Bucky isn't here..." Tony mumbled, reassuring himself more than his son. He needn't make effort to calm him down because Steve had just walked into the room... alone.
Tony took one more hard stare at the computer screen; it displayed a diagram of a double helix structured DNA, however it had mutations all over it: making it theoretically stronger... before going upstairs to Peter's bedroom.
"You didn't?" Steve commented, embracing the fourteen year old, who was now clinging to his shoulders.
The voice's owner, a boy that looked roughly his height and age replied, "The name's Parker. Peter Parker." Then, after looking at the other's confused stares added, "Sorry, I've always wanted to do that. It's from a movie."
"Yeah, buddy?" Steve responded, in a manner that would have fooled anyone into thinking it had only been an hour since the two had last spoken.
The kid's eyes widened even more. "You mean you're actually gonna properly meet Ned?" Truth he told, Tony had never really, actually met his son's best friend. Usually, he was too busy or some emergency pulled him away from the Tower. Rhodey had met him, so had Clint and Happy, but the philanthropist still was yet to meet the boy.
Picking up another slice of toast, Bucky eyed his boyfriend - not completely sure what to say. So, instead of inputting more to the conversation, he decided to let Steve do all the talking, allowing him to destroy all evidence of the cooked bread.
Bucky's breathing calmed, his shouting seized. His eyes went empty, emotionless. He stood in ready position, looking at the man as if he was the only thing in the room."Ready to comply."
"Well, you've got these powers. Why don't we see what you can do and maybe - just maybe - create a suit to match your abilities."
Tony walked down the long hallways, searching for Steve, Peter by his side. The man had walked off, after their last talk. They were quick to find him in a glass office, which happened to overlook the control room.
"Yeah, kiddo," he pushed a few of Peter's curls away from his eyes, "I should've told you everything."
"You see old Spangles and the One-Armed-Wonder making out all the time, why can't I enjoy myself a little?" Tony said, teasing his kid. It was the moments like these, the happy ones, the ones where he could wind up his son, that he never wanted to forget. After everything they had all been through, Pete especially, even the smallest moments were special enough to be savoured.
Steve nodded faintly, "You keep telling yourself that, Tones." He placed the pen down. "Hate to break up the set." He walked out of the office, leaving Tony to himself.
Peter didn't reply; he wasn't too sure what to say to that. Sure, his Pops has mentioned his Mom prior to that moment... it was just awkward to get back to it right then.
Nodding, Steve replied, "I'm afraid so. I don't agree with it. I think we should be able to save whoever needs saving, not whoever the UN deem worthy."
As soon as they were out of the door, Tony pulled Pepper into a kiss. He knew it was something he probably shouldn't have done, especially in front of his kid, but it was well worth it. "Damn..." he mumbled, after taking a step away from her. "Pep, I-"
Steve pulled out his phone, one of the latest Stark Industries models. "What if he hates me?" he asked, distressed, as scrolled to find Peter's number. "What if he'd rather have stayed with Tony?"
Steve shook his head, and passed a plate filled with two fried eggs, three sausages, some bacon and an omelet to Peter: "Good thing he's a Stark-Rogers then..."
"Apparently some organisation - Hydra, I think - planned it. They thought that my parents knew too much to be alive."
Up ahead, Bucky reached a fork in the road and faced oncoming traffic. He blinked, his mind going over every possible scenario before he leaped over the barrier, just as Steve drove through it.
"Well, Buck, I don't think I can spend the rest of my life without you. I wanna stay with you till I'm at least a hundred years old..."
"He's also an alcoholic..." Steve continued, "Anyone who's spent a few minutes with him would know what. And he's had a few professions would would be deemed un-right for a father."
"I don't know, I just have this hunch." Peter spun around on the bed, so that he was facing the wall, and Tony stood up.
Peter was about to say something else- to ask what would happen to those who didn't sign, to those who didn't know they had to sign, when the door opened. There was a lady, dressed in a suit, with her red hair tied up neatly in a bun. "Mr Stark," she said politely, "You have a message regarding your son. I've been told it's urgent."
Steve forced himself to walk down the aisle, the wooden coffin light compared to the heavy pit in his stomach. It felt like a trek up a mountain just to get to the front of the hall. There were tears in the soldier's eyes, his hands shaking under the weight of death and guilt. If only he had been with her this entire time, maybe then she would have lived longer, maybe then she would have been okay.
"I didn't say not to wear them to breakfast, did I? Just that they will probably annoy your Pops... which isn't exactly a bad thing."
[Warnings from now: angst, creepy villains, sadness, torture, pain, hallucinations. Read at your own risk.]
Bucky didn’t answer. He didn’t even move a muscle. Something was off about the man and his foreign... Sokovian accent. He could tell that nothing good could come but he wasn’t going to try anything. He had to make a good impression on S.H.I.E.L.D. again, even if it was just to please Steve. Anyway, he could easily break out of the pod: he just didn’t want to.
Peter threw a quick glance at his father before smiling and saying, "KFC? I know you don't like that kind of food, but I was kidnapped... and tortured"
Knowing that was true, Steve calmly replied, "Fine..." Then, muttered to himself, "I knew it wasn't an accident but I never imagined it was you."
"I'm sorry, Steve," said Rhodey, "That is dangerously arrogant. This is the United Nations we are talking about." The Captain shook his head in disbelief, as the War Machine continued. "It's not the World Security Council, it's not Shield, it's not Hydra."
Peter started jumping up and down on the floor, a beam across his bright face, "Can I try it on? Can I? Can I, Dad, please?"
"Fury said there could be a Hydra base here," Tony continued, in the middle of a long run-on explanation of the bases Peter could have been taken to. He was tapping the screen of Steve's laptop with the end of the paintbrush, gesturing to a point seemingly in the middle of nowhere. "It's only a maybe but it's close by and the best place to start. There have been no sightings of The Winter Soldier - and we know this because of social media goes crazy every single time - so they can't have gone far."
Peter ran out of the lab. Wait, no it wasn't a run, it was a skip. Peter skipped out of the lab, the suit in his arms - and ran to the training rooms. He went in the changing in rooms in there and put on his new suit.
Tony glared at his son, trying not to panic. That other kid- Harley he swiftly remembered, the one who had helped him out when everyone thought he was dead: he had been great at bringing anxiety attacks upon him. Hell, that kid was probably the biggest stress inducer there was! His own son was nearly as bad. "Peter..."
Bucky stepped to the side, allowing the man to come into the room. "Come in... Is it serious?" He was worried. Worried for himself, for Steve, for Peter... What if it was to do with the court trials? What if it was to do with Spider-Man? It was probably just to do with school, he reassured himself, trying to regain his composure.
Bucky dropped the man and turned his attention to Steve, swift to push him down to the ground by his chest. He punched a hole into the floor with his metal arm. "I'm. Not. Gonna. Kill. Anyone!" He then pulled up a floorboard, grabbing the backpack that was hidden beneath it; he throws it out of the window. Bucky then gets behind Steve, using the man and his shield as a way to avoid getting hit by the oncoming storm of bullets.
"Morning, Pete," Tony said softly as he pulled his son's bedroom curtains open. He glanced across at the fourteen year old's waking form and smiled - he was lucky to have such a wonderful family. Too lucky, he often thought to himself.
Steve? His Pops? Is that what he called him. The tall, handsome and muscular man who forced him to eat his greens before having desert. And Tony?  His Dad? The brunet who was only a tiny bit taller than the boy himself. The one who always smelt like oil yet his designer clothes were always spotless.
Peter frowned, swirling his spoon around on his bowl of lucky charms. "What do you mean?" He asked it as more of a reality check than anything else. He knew exactly what it meant: he was only gonna be able to stay with one of his parents, if it ends up in the hand of a judge.
Peter searched through his memories: trying to remember what dish Vision was mentioning. "Oh... the one with toast, eggs, baked beans - which i remember finding odd - and some other stuff?"
His head was spinning. His heart beating faster then it ever had before. He tried to block the memories, the thoughts he had been locking away for so long. But, it was impossible.
"Just because it's the path of least resistance doesn't mean it's the wrong path. Staying together is more important than how we stay together."
"Yes. I do do that. And that's exactly why I don't want Peter doing it. I've seen what happens, when things go wrong. I couldn't let that happen to him."
The four clambered out of their seats, grabbing their bags, and joined the rest of the class outside of Oscorp.
Steve relaxed. The pressure of his boyfriend not wanting to meet his son lifted. "I'll call Tony. Make sure they'll be in."
Steve was on his boyfriend's tail, the other man still clinging on to the vehicle with his claws. They followed him through another underpass, to be joined by Sam, who had finally caught up with the action.
Six months... It had been roughly six months since Tony had last heard his precious baby speak. Six months since he had last watched him walk or run. Six months since they had last gone out patrolling as Spider-Man and Iron Man together.
The Captain sighed, "Yeah... He's all that, and more. He's intelligent, might be only fourteen but he's probably ready to graduate college."
"Nat!" Steve announced, standing up to greet the redhead, a smile across his face. The agent was holding a flask, which the blond guessed was not filled with hot cocoa or coffee, and had sat down on the couch opposite then, after shaking the Captain's hand. "What are you doing here? Well I mean other than the fact your live here," he added.
The billionaire continued to rub his head against his hands, hiding away from the growing conflict within the team. Natasha picked up on it, "Tony?" The man looked up see the assassin smiling at him. "You were being uncharacteristically non-hyperverbal.
"You're going to pay for this, y'know. He's an innocent kid, why'd you even think about laying a finger on him?"
"No! I don't care if you had feelings for him before the freaking war. You said you had feelings for me, too... Maybe you were wrong. Maybe we were both wrong." The brunet glanced down at his phone, which had just vibrated and had begun to glow. "Pep is here, kiddo. You know your way out, right?"
"Hello?" he called out, his voice rough and hoarse. He wasn't exactly expecting an answer, he just wanted to see if it still worked.
"W-hy? We lived through it... I was a freakin' mascot for our side... We know what happened," stammered Steve. The Captain was now turning pale, as if a faint coating of white paint had been brushed across him.
The man stood outside of the apartment door, his face twisted in an evil grin. His eyes were wide and beady - a manic laughter seeing out of them. A look that haunted nightmares... a man who caused them for fun. He lifted his fist to the red door:
"And now I've got genetically enhanced powers... just like Pops," he finished, slightly less enthusiastically.
Tony smirked. He found it adorable that after knowing Pepper for almost five years the kid still referred to her in such a formality. Peter had been raised right; he was always polite to everyone, even the bad guys. He shook away the thought- there was no need to bring up bad memories just after he had finally got himself a date with the most beautiful, perfect, wonderful, scariest woman on the planet. Pepper was the only one who could make the billionaire do anything. They were meant to be!
Peter eventually stopped hugging his Pops and sat down next to him - finally noticing Bucky. "Who the hell are you?" he asked, earning himself a disapproved glare from Steve.
"Peter!" Steve shouted, throwing the wreckage of furniture to the side, kneeling down beside the small frame of his son.
"Pops," Peter said as Steve stood up and headed towards the door, "Y'know I never actually said I wanted to be an Avenger like you and Dad."
Peter raised his hand, in the same manor a student would do to gain the teacher's attention. "Is Pepper gonna be here soon? You said she'd pick me up so I wasn't stuck here the entire time..."
Bucky grinned. "Well I'm pleased to finally meet you, Peter. Your... Pops has spoken a lot about you."
The man kept his hand there, his eyes glimmering as the boy tried to shake his head away. Zemo's nails were digging into his skin, scratching him whenever he tried to move. "I will never do as you say," Peter hissed, finally gaining enough strength to pull his head back.
Then he felt it. A sudden burn on the back of his neck. It left as soon as it came, but he now had a faint headache. "Ouch," he muttered, under his breath.
Darkness. Everywhere. The power was out and Tony Stark had no clue what had happened. However, he did enjoy the moment of watching Everett hiss in panic, when he realised that no power meant no security cameras... and then he realised it affected him too.
The door slid open, and the man - who had been talking to the boy before, walked in. "Stand up, актив/asset," the older man barked, coming closer towards the bed. As the boy's eyes trailed from the doorway back to where Peter had previously been standing, he noticed the teen had vanished. Disappeared. As quickly as he had arrived, he had gone.
Tony met his ex's eyes. The blue in Steve's was turning teal, going greener than Tony had ever seen. The billionaire's own eyes were wide and teary. "If we don't do this now, Steve, its gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty."
"Kid," Tony added, "I'm gonna take a sample of your blood. Afterwards, go to bed, get some rest. We'll see how you are tomorrow.
"That's interesting," Steve grunted, envisioning the smug grin on Tony's face as he flew directly above him, watching him struggle like a pensioner trying to figure out how google works. "Couldn't have fixed this up for me, could you?"
Tony laughed, "Of course I would, Petey. You're my star... my sun... my whole live will happily work around you."
Smirking, Peter said, "Sure! Thought you'd never ask. I'm heading out now, should I meet you by the Tower?"
Now dressed  and even more tired, Peter lay down on the bed: unable to sleep because of the harsh light glaring down at him. They - Hydra - were doing this for one of two reasons... a) they wanted him to suffer, or b) they were trying to make him sleep only when they wanted him to. As if on cue, the light switched off - submerging him in the
Tony smirked, his personality was rubbing off on the teen. That was probably not a good thing but he was going to let that slide. Who doesn't like Tony Stark? Exactly, nobody. He stood up.
"It's fine. I've done it loads - just don't mention it to your Pops, he's got a soft spot for the government."
"I wasn't in Vienna. I don't do that anymore." Bucky didn't lie, Steve remembered. He never had, even when lying could have saved their sorry asses from Mrs Barnes.
Peter snarked, "I know I am." In a manner very much similar to Tony's. It made the man laugh, as they continued patrolling the city.
"But also an extremely loyal friend, who everybody loves," Bucky added, before kissing Steve on the forehead.
When they finally returned to the Tower, it was gone midnight - meaning Peter had to go directly to bed. "Night, Spiderson," Tony mumbled, as he shut the door.
"The documents Pops showed you earlier?" Peter whispered. The genius nodded in reply to him, unwilling to answer verbally. Peter could remember how angry the superstar-soldier was about the Accords earlier but his Dad has seemed willing to signit. Why did he sound so unsure now? The words every enchanted individual continued to rattle in his thoughts. "Would I have to sign it?"
The only source of light throughout the cell was coming from a thin gap, which was under what Peter presumed to be the door. It was a dim yellow, barely enough to illuminate the claustrophobic room: but it was there. It was a slimmer of hope in all the darkness surrounding him.
Tony brought his left hand to his face, holding it firmly with his other. He was shaking. Steve was going to go against him. He was going to argue against this new law. But, he couldn't do that... could he? He was meant to be America's golden boy: the one and only Star Spangled Man. The genius exhaled quietly, crossing his fingers that Steve would make the right decision.
"Yeah," Tony lifted his right hand to scratch the back of his neck. "We've always had the chemistry, just didn't know we both had the feelings..." His smile faded, when he realised that Steve was still frowning at him. "What? What is it, Rogers?"
"Well, Pete," Steve began, whilst twiddling his thumbs, "There's a bit of news I have to share with you..."
The pair sat down and Steve put his arm around Bucky. "I hope you like him," he mumbled aloud by accident.
"Don't even think about crying, boy. You don't wanna know what'll happen if you do," the man said sharply, grabbing Peter's shirt collar - pulling him out of the room.
"Now, my актив/asset you will do as I tell you to. Otherwise there may be some... painful consequences."
Peter took a deep breath, before replying. "It's a Hydra... isn't it. It's from Greek mythology... it's a serpent-like monster, with many heads. If you cut off one of its heads-"
Clint slowly backed out of the room, not wanting to intrude on what could be one of their final hugs. He understood what Tony was going through: he knew what it felt like to have kids.
Peter lifted his head to see who had asked him... it was MJ. The rest of their class had gone through the door into the next room, leaving him and her alone with the interns and scientists there. "Yeah, I'm coming."
Peter shook his head, closing his eyes in frustration. He wanted to be fine. He wanted to be brave. He wanted to be like his Dad and Pops. But he wasn't anything like them: he was plain, old Peter. Might as well just be Peter, no Stark or Rogers fame. That's all he was... Just Peter. Yes, he thought to himself, that's how he should start referring to himself: Just Peter.
"So, so they do work! That's sick! Did you use my formula for the webbing? Is there multiple combinations? Is there a way to dissolve it, seeing as you sent me to bed before I could make the antiserum? So if there isn't, well then it's your fault, wait no, I didn't mean that. I'm sorry."
"Well I best be off," Tony announced - whilst ruffling Peter's hair, "Have fun with your Uncle Clint."
Peter squirmed in his sleep, pushing the mountain of plushies off from his bed. His old nightlight (one of Tony's previous arc reactors, which had had been recycled and repurposed into a gift for his son) was switched off for the first time in years. He usually couldn't sleep in the darkness, however after the incident with Hydra, the light was starting to make his night terrors worse.
"Right. Who's blood is it exactly?" asked Steve, no more reassured than he was when he saw his husband for the first time that evening.
"Since we first met. Couldn't mention it back then, of course. Probably would've been shot for it... Now, though, it's a common norm. A man can love a man without anyone hating on it."
"Yep..." The teenager hurried out of the room, glad to be free from the heat of the discussion between his parents.
He could still have picture her, not a day older than when he first got his shield. Her hair kept back in neat braids, whilst her uniform was completely spotless. The brown sparkle in her eyes was still there even to the last time he had visited her... but it had vanished now. Now it was only him, and Buck. They were alone in the world.
Shaking his head, Bucky smirked. "Have you gone deatf, Rogers, call him!" Steve did just that, pressing his son's number and waiting ten seconds for an answer.
Steve could hear voices. They were speaking in German. He wasn't sure what they were saying but knowing his luck it was unlikely to be good. Suddenly, the sound of the door being battered echoed through the room. They were trying to get in. They were trying to get to Bucky. He had to do something.
"You were the one that was insistent on leaving right this moment," he said, dipping slightly lower so he could get a good recording of Steve's problem. In the back of his mind, he planned to show it to Peter when they found him - he could probably get a good laugh out of it.
Peter rolled over, and would have fallen off the couch if it weren't for the super soldier knelt beside him. "Yeah..." he mumbled, his eyes flickering open whilst he shifted into a more comfortable position.
Steve kneeled down opposite Peter - who was sat on a twin bed, "What's up, Pete? You've never been shy with me before..."
Steve doesn't know who said it but the voice is coming out of the speakers of the vehicle, the blue lights on top of it flashing. So, he does the smartest thing possible, he jumped onto the vehicle, splintering the windshield. The car stopped. Steve pulled him out of the window, shoving him to the floor, before smashing his way into the car, once more after his boyfriend, who was currently running over over the top of a speeding car... outpacing it.
Tony looked up from his book, his conscience questioning whether or not he had imagined the faint voice. He glanced down at Peter, and smiled at the sight of his son's fluttering eyes. "Pete?" he said softly, his hand brushing across the boy's hair, "Bud... can you hear me?"
"Breach! Breach! Breach!" Sam yelled from over the comms. A grenade crashed through the window, settling beside Bucky. The glass was thrown everywhere, painting the floor in shattered, transparent fragments. The assassin kicked it towards his former friend and watched as the Captain smothered it with his shield.
Steve went red. "There's a meaning. Um. Well. Peggy said something about it back, back before I... found you... in the War. When Hydra first... I misunderstood her, thought she and Howard, did it..."
They mentioned Bucky's death... leaving both Steve and Bucky in tears. Bucky saw how much worse his pal was taking it and decided to comfort him. He placed him arms around the soldier.
"What?" the boy asked, stunned. He shifted on the spot, looking at Clint for the answer his father wasn't giving him. He got none.
"Yes, it is," Tony replied after finishing his mouthful. His day had bee good: the two boys had been left to their own devices to entertain themselves, which left almost the entirety of the penthouse to Pepper and Tony. To put it lightly, Tony wouldn't deny that they had had some fun.
Ross smiled. "Three days from now, the UN meets in Vienna to ratify the accords." Steve turned his head to face Tony, clearly outraged. The billionaire stayed staring at the ground, swivelling his shoes, until Steve coughed to get his attention. The two leaders made eye contact, before the General added, "To talk it over."
He got no response, which was expected, really, seeing as the boy had uttered no words the other eight hours he had been there.
"It's Ned and thanks, Dad," Peter exclaimed, throwing his arms around Tony. He was almost taller than him at this point, meaning Peter had to move his head to the side in order not to hit his father's. "We are so going to finish the new Lego set you got me!"
"Hey! I already did that. Well, I rediscovered one and created it, which may I just said is basically impossible..." Tony boasted, his annoyance clearly fake - the bright glint in his eye not once disappearing. " Howard thought it was Vibranium but as always he was wrong. Bassadium is what they decided to call it. But me? I call it Starkonium." He tapped his arc reactor proudly, and Pepper rolled her eyes.
"I know you're nervous," the Captain said, taking a step towards his boyfriend. "And you have plenty of reason to be. But you're lying." He prayed to God that Bucky was lying... if he wasn't, then they were all screwed.
The genius snorted. "You still don't look like you're protesting against this... You actually like me, don't you, Pep?" He smiled. "Please tell me there's nothing actually concerning Pete because I don't think I can just walk away from that."
Peter and Tony were sat in one of his labs, a large, pizza box open in front of them. "So, what's your great idea, Dad?" Peter asked, in between a bite of the cheese-covered food.
"Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center... instead of a Wakandan prison."
"You didn't cook these, did you?" he asked, trying to change the topic. He couldn't stand being mad this long - maybe he just had to get on with life like Dad had said.
"Bucky, you don't have to do this," choked Peter, trying to get hold of his Pop's boyfriend's attention. He fidgeted but his attempts only left his feeling weaker and even tireder.
"Thank you." Then, before the Soviet could close the door, a punch landed right on his face. He falls back against the hard, wooden floor- hitting his head badly.
"Pops!" Peter exclaimed, noticing his other father sat on one of the Tower's many sofas, "Dad never told me you were gonna be here!"
"Mr Stark, you've finally arrived," announced the judge - who's gelled hair and fake smile annoyed Tony, despite the fact he'd worn a similar expression many times before. The court session had begun fifteen minutes prior to his arrival yet the feeling of being late always seemed to give him a rush of adrenaline.
Peter shook his head in dismay; he knew that his dad could remember Ned's name but opted to forget it to be irritating. He sighed.
"I'm a philanthropist, Rogers. I freakin' look out for people's welfare. Why would I put my own son in danger?"
Peter looked across at his Dad, his eyes wide as he realised what was about to happen. "Dad, don't. Please, don't..." The teen was cut off by his own squeals of laugher, trying to squirm away from his Dad's tickles.
The Captain paused - causing the room to be flooded by a silence - or at least a silence with the faint sound of someone eating toast.
By the time he had finished upgrading every single thing he could on the spandex clothing, the sun had risen - and Peter had woken up.
He felt a slight ticklish sensation up his neck. It was because of all the talk on spiders, he guessed. Oscorp weren't that awful at security measures to have one of their experiments just waltzing around the compound. Were they?
"No, the kid's usually an early-bird," he said, sitting down on the couch beside Bucky. "By the way, he definitely won that chess game, you're just a sore loser."
"You didn't think the fool could have done it all himself, did you?" Zemo queried, his tone being way too light for the situation. "We prided ourselves with being close with many strong organisations such as the Rising Tide. It was a small price to pay for weapons such as that."
"Jus' got an incoming call. I'll be back in a sec, bud," Tony muttered, walking out of the lounge. "Hi, Steve," he said, calmly.
"I'll remind him to get it once we find him," Steve said, walking over to where his motorbike was. He barely made it two feet before catching his foot on a root and falling onto his knees.
Peter stood up, still angered by his father but less than before, and began to walk willingly towards the doors. "Fine, I'll do this. But... only because their apartment is more central to the city, I'll be able to patrol a bit easier."
"Come on, kid, you gotta get up," Tony tried again. This time whilst pulling the boy up off the mattress. However, instead of stiffening and standing upright, Peter clung to Tony's grasp: his body limply hanging from the man's arms.
Bucky broke free from his attacker, slinging his bag over his back as he ran and jumped another level. The other person- the man adorned all in black, slid down the wall, using his claws for traction. He landed at street level and the chase continued.
"Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony." He slammed his fist again the table, flinching when a glass fell and shattered. They both ignored it.
The attorney, who appeared to have been either drunk or was just had a spur of the moment idea ended the meeting by saying, "I now pronounce you single and single. You may now walk away..."
Steve was shocked at his ex's outbreak. "I haven't told them anything... not yet. But we won't have a choice soon. And it's not entirely my fault." The blond pushed a document across the table and towards Tony.
"I'm Bucky," the brunet replied, holding out his hand, "I have a feeling you might have heard of me?"
The call ended and Steve suddenly felt immensely worse. It was he who had started the custody battle, it was he who had split apart this family.
Steve watched in horror as the pod, which was holding his boyfriend prisoner, was carried away by a military level forklift. He tried to make eye contact with the brunet but Bucky made no signal that he had seen him. The soldier then turned away, trying to ignore everything that was happening...
Sam crossed his arms and leant forwards on his toes. "Aren't you the same woman who told the government to kiss her ass a few years ago?"
Natasha was next to speak. She had somehow materialised next to them, her training paying off in both missions for S.H.I.E.L.D. and the occasional prank war. "For the record, this is what making things worse looks like. Please don't do anything else, Steve. Peter might have Tony but he does need a responsible adult in his life to turn to... speaking of the devil."
Tony was stood up in the middle of an office, his neck craned in an effort to keep his phone in place as he noted something down. He tossed the paper to the side, before saying, "No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup."
"Doesn't matter, you should still tell me everything about him. You've probably gone and tested some of your crazy inventions on him - gone and got him injured..."
Backhanding Peter across the face, the blond scoffed, "Then don't." The fourteen-year-old brought his tied hands to his cheek. The hit had hurt: mostly from the shock of it, but the force stung too. He didn't cry, though; he didn't want to succumb to the weakness inside of him. He was Spider-Man... he had to be brave,
A few minutes later, the boy was greeted with a plate filled with delicious food, of which was only slightly burnt. "This looks amazing, thank you."
Steve pushed the boy gamingly, sitting down in the cramped space he had made on the sofa. "Me and Bucky gotta go fight some bad guys, Pete... You gonna be okay home alone till we're back?"
"Hey!" Clint retaliated, dropping from the vents, "He asked me to buy him some awesome pyjamas and they were all out on Hawkeye merch."
"Fine," Peter said, scowling. He sat down at the desk, which had been bought specifically for his new schooling, and began working on his Spanish assignment.
Peter nodded his head, "Yeah," he paused - catching his breath, "Throw something at me, anything, but wait until I'm facing the other way."
Steve nodded, taking a few steps across the room and crouching down beside the sofa Peter was sleeping on. "This is around the time he usually wakes up anyway, and Tony will kill me if I mess up his sleep schedule."
"Clint?" He queried, knowing how well the two former S.H.I.E.L.D. agents got along. Then again he hadn't seen the Hawk since before Peter's.... disappearance.
Steve took one hand off the bike to make a rude gesture into the air. "This is how much I care, tincan!"
Steve bowed his head, sighing. He didn't want to sign the damn accords. Heck! The United Nations were almost as bad as Hydra with some of their laws. It wouldn't surprise him if there were still Hydra agents who were high ranking government officials. If they managed to infiltrate S.H.I.E.L.D. the United Nations was probably just as Hydra-ified .
“You fear that… if you open your mouth, the horrors might never stop. Don't worry... We only have to talk about one.”
Steve took another long, hard stare at the the blurry photo of the man, who had been behind the bombing of the congress meeting in Vienna. “Why would the Task Force release this photo to begin with?”
Peter blushed, "Only good stuff, right?" And, after receiving no valid answer, he repeated: "Right?"
The pair strolled into the kitchen. "Hey, Pops," Peter said, sitting down on one of the chairs by the table.
“I... don’t... want... to... talk... ‘bout... it,” the soldier said through gritted teeth, trying his best not to lose his temper. He knew what happened when the other him got out: people usually ended up dead.
"Boy, you know me so well," Tony replied sarcastically. Of course Steve didn't want the team to know that they had already discussed it. He wanted it to seem like he was just good at reading people... which he was not, let's just clarify. He wanted to seem like the good guy in all this darkness.
"Hi..." Steve replied as he followed his ex into the  elevator. The man looked like shit. He had probably stayed up all night tinkering away in his lab - his consciousness sustained by a mix of caffeine and alcohol. The soldier was used to Tony looking like that: it was a habit of the genius to do that most nights he couldn't sleep.
"Hey, Peter, how are you?" Steve said, trying to start a conversation. After a few seconds of silence, Tony nudged the boy's shoulder, hoping to get his attention.
A motorbike sped towards Bucky, who was quick to realise and grabbed the handle, spinning the bike around. The rider was thrown off. Bucky's eyes widened. He hopped onto the bike and rode away, sending cars careering left and right.
This made Tony angrier than he could possibly imagine - if he were Bruce, he was pretty sure he would of already turned into Hulk and destroyed the entire building. "I'm not putting him in danger, Rogers," he spat, standing up hastily. "I have never, and will never, do anything to harm my son."
"Lovin' the jammies, kid." Sam pointed at the Iron Man pyjamas the teen was wearing and smirked. "Think I could pull them off?"
Tony rushed over in his suit but not to help Steve up. Instead, he went down on one knee and listened attentively.
"Well, I can't tell you where we are... What would be the point of a secret if we told it to everyone? But, who I am... well, I can answer who we are," the man replied, his voice flooding the entirety of the cell. "We are Hydra."
Peter looked at the book in horror. "It's... it's gotta have at least five hundred pages... I can't memorise that. I'm not going to." The red hydra symbol which was etched onto the cover seemed to glow as he spoke.
"They're on the roof... I'm compromised!" There goes the first line of defences. Steve guessed it was just him now.
Steve shuddered. How had he forgotten about the new laws that came with the Sokovia Accords? Now he couldn't act without governmental permission because he'd be breaking the freaking law. Excuse him for his language but he was really freaking done.
"Come on, Sir," Steve exclaimed, brushing his hand through his hair. "Peter's barely even settled  in with me and Bucky, you can't send us on a mission now."
Wordlessly, Tony helped himself to a drink from the fridge and filled a glass of water for Steve. "Drink it," he ordered.
A few hours had passed since the boy's conversation with the man. The brunet had been left alone inside the room... his room, and the plain canvas of a chamber had started to drive him insane. Why was everything so clean and white? Why couldn't there been a touch of colour? How hard would it be for this Hydra to do a paint job?
"What's best for me is being with Dad," Peter stated, holding in the urge to clench his fists. His face was definitely red by now; he could feel his blood raging.
"Dad... I - Me, but... they... I.... I'm sorry," he stammered, his body collapsing against the mattress as he tried to sit upright.
He fumbled around his room, looking for his phone, and grabbed it in a sigh of relief. His fingers searched for the contact labelled:
"But, it's up to you. It would be dangerous. The UN could... they could d-deploy you for whatever battles they want. Even if I, or you, said no. You wouldn't have a choice. You'd be signing your life away..."
"Woah! Easy, tiger...." Tony exclaimed sarcastically, "We don't want you getting even more injured - do we?" He pulled his hand away from the kid's hair, and added, "Fri, tell Steve to get up here now. Say Pete's awake."
"You guys know I'm right here, right?" Peter cut in, slowly eating the breakfast that had been put before him.
The billionaire spun on the spot. He hadn't seen the group come in. "Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something," he stated, shrugging.
"What is it?" Wanda piped, pointing to the screen showing documents and warfare plans, as she rested her head on Vision's shoulder, "We should be doing something better than this. We're not Hydra. We don't plan battles against others."
"The kid told me, while we were playing chess," he said, a satisfied grin on his features. "He said he heard it from an intern at SI."
There was silence. The two usually loudest people in the Tower had fallen quiet, the only sounds in the room being their heavy and hasty breathing.
Steve frowned, the skin on his forehead creasing as he looked around. “Yeah,” he muttered. Sharon‘s eyes narrowed as she watched the curly-haired man take another step towards Bucky’s pod.
Peter's wide, brown eyes met his father's - blinking every few seconds to keep away the tears. "That's because I've never, ever, been taken away from the people, or person, I loved."
Tony hauled himself off the ground, walking back over to his son. "I am protecting you, bud. If you want to be able to see me again you're just gonna have to along with this."
Just as he was considering allowing himself to fall back to sleep, he heard his pops call out, "Bucky, have you seen my sketchpad anywhere?"
"I have as much faith in your parenting skills as I have in you not dying via drinking paint water," he deadpanned.
"Finally, a good question. We need another asset. One far more young and impressionable. One like you."
Steve woke up to find Bucky curled up next to him, his breathing soft and calming. The blond pushed his best friend's hair off of his face, and sighed. This fuzzy feeling overcame him whenever he looked at - or even thought of - Bucky, every time. It wasn't like his love for Tony, which he was sure was slowly dissipating, it was stronger... more real. That worried him, he couldn't be dishonest to Tony, not whilst they were still married: so he'd have to sort it out legally.
Steve took a step back, taking in the sight that had just appeared out of nowhere. A man, clad entirely in sparkling charcoal, slammed into the side of Bucky, pushing the assassin onto the rough ground. If the newcomer was strong enough to best Bucky, it was probably bad news. Steve had always looked up to his pal in terms of strength, even after the serum changed his body. Bucky was mentally and physically strong... something Steve wished he knew how to be. His emotions always seemed to get the better of him. That's why he liked heading down to the boxing ring; it gave him a chance to take out his anger in a manageable way.
Sitting at the kitchen table was the man himself, rather haphazardly streaking his pencils across a piece of paper. Rolling his eyes and snorting, Tony picked up a discarded rubber and threw it at Steve's face. "Oi, Rogers? I'm here to find out where your crazy boyfriend has kidnapped my - sorry, our - son to."
"Stop! Peter, alright? I can't hear this stuff without... without feeling like this was all my fault. If it weren't for me having a go at Steve, we wouldn't have gone our own separate ways. You'd have never stayed there. Hydra would never have found you," the man choked, rubbing his eyes to hide the tears. "We can go to KFC... for you, buddy... okay?"
During his time laying low, making sure no Avengers would find him, Zemo decided to go about getting Hydra's golden boy another way. If he couldn't have the Stark-Rogers boy, he'd have to make do with original assassins: The Winter Soldiers.
"What? No. Leave. Go." Bucky stammered, flinching at the word. How could he have been so stupid? The man's Sokovian accent should of given it away - of course, he shouldn't assume... but in his case, he should always assume.
"You okay, Peter?" Ned asked, noticing his friend's pale face as they were led into a room, that was labelled Cross-Species Genetics.
The bedroom door swung open, revealing a shocked Bucky Barnes. He had had a bag of KFC in his metal hand, and had dropped in once he saw the clothing the boy was dressed in.
"I know," Tony exclaimed, "Let's get you to school, we don't want you to be late for your trip." The man almost spat the word, leaving Peter glad to head down to the car park and get into his Dad's favourite white Audi.
His ears were still ringing, when the Soldier hauled him out of the chair - minutes after the machine had been switched off. He had stood back and stared at Peter, as if admiring his handiwork, before removing the mouthpiece and dragging the boy to his feet.
Peter pulled his hand away from the boy, and when the boy looked back at the teen... he was gone. The words stuck, though. What would he remember? When?
"D-dad... m-morning," slurred the young boy, his eyes blinking rapidly. "What time is it?" he added, after he felt slightly more awake. His brown curls were sticking out all over the place, and his Star Wars: The Clone Wars pyjama shirt was drenched in sweat.
"Technicalities, technicalities," Tony dismissed. "I'll do you one better: now I'm picturing you trying to take down Loki by hitting him in the face with your shield."
"They hurt you. Real bad," Peter informed the boy, their eyes locked together. The boy was panicking: he had only known this reality for a small amount of time but it was slowly being torn apart... and he didn't like that. It may have been made up of lies but it was a comfort of knowledge - false knowledge, but knowledge all the same.
The blond and the teen looked over at Tony who was muttering, "Oscorp, Oscorp! Why would anyone in their right minds want to go to Oscorp?" under his breath.
The boy shook his head. All he could remember was everything that had happened after he had woken up. Nothing else. His mind was blank. And it was all Captain America and Iron Man's fault. "I'm sorry."
"Go ahead, Captain, but you're going to have to be leaving tonight. Agent Romanoff will be working alongside you... it's a pity Banner isn't here."
Bucky glanced over at the fidgeting kid, "I have an idea... why don't I make us some grub, whilst your Pops, here, tells you what's happening?"
"What in Satan's name have you done to him? If you hurt my kid-" started Tony, who began to walk over to Zemo, only to be held back by his ex-husband.
It felt like an eternity had gone by before he got his answer. "Yeah, I'm okay. Got lucky, I guess... Just... I know how much Barnes means to you. I really do. Stay home. You'll only make this worse. For all of us. Please."
"Come along," T'Challa said, his tone indicating that it was an order and not just a request. Despite his youthful looks, the soon to be king seemed to have years trapped behind his eyes- grief burrowing its way to the surface.
"There's no decision making process here." He moved over, so that he was stood in front of the whole team, and cross his arms. "We need to be put in check! Whatever form that takes, I'm game. If we can't accept limitations, if we're boundary-less, we're no better than the bad guys."
"Peggy said she has a spare apartment I can borrow... Actually, I think Howard gave it to her first..." Steve answered.
"Morning, punk," Bucky mumbled, startling Steve slightly seeing as the Captain hadn't noticed his pal's awakening.
As the father and son walked through the main hallway - the one that passed by the training room - Tony saw Clint peek his head out from one of the many doors. "Not the time, Barton," and when the man continued through the door, Tony raised his voice, "Did you hear me, Barton, or do you need me to go get the mind stone from Vision?"
"Well... 'Cause, I never had a chance to see how we won. I only saw Hydra's propaganda, nothing else, nothing more. Now I'm with Shield I might as well find out what I've missed."
Peter spent an hour doing his schoolwork, before he tugged his suit out of his bag. He threw his blue, plaid shirt, denim jeans, and grey tee, to the carpet - stepping inside and pulling on his suit.
The chair was cold and uncomfortable, and left close to no room between Peter and the desk. Blondie - the nickname Peter had given to the man who had brought him here, was now attaching the boy's handcuffs to the metal table, being sure to leave no space for him to attempt to escape. It wasn't like he was going to try... he'd never make it.
"Right..." Steve muttered, but never got a chance to finish his sentence because Tony had already got into his white Audi and started to drive off.
When Tony burst into Steve's house, it became apparent the man had been stress-painting. Not that Tony wasn't accustomed to this - he and Steve has been married for goodness sake, he knew all too well the abundance of paint that could find its way anywhere and everywhere when Steve went on a spree of anxiety-sketching. However, it was an excessive amount of art.
Tony shuffled around on his seat, rubbing his head. "Actually, I'm nursing an electromagnetic headache." He stood up, walking over to the small (Tony Stark's idea of small, anyway) kitchen area in the room. "That's what's going on, Cap." He began to make himself a cup of coffee. "It's just pain. It's discomfort." He then looked into the sink. "Who's putting coffee grounds in the disposal?" The genius turned around, the kettle in his grasp, as he walked back towards a table nearer the rest of the group. "Am I running a bed and breakfast for a biker gang?"
He awoke to the white walls of the a room. Yet, he couldn't remember if he had been here before - or where he had been previously. He didn't even know what he looked like. And, he couldn't remember his own name.
"I don't... I don't believe you," he stuttered, staring at the white wall in front of him. His tears were starting to water; he couldn't let Peter know he had gotten to him. "But, I recognise you."
"I've just got a bit of a headache. Gonna call my Dad, ask if he can pick me up," said Peter. "Tell Mr. Harrington for me, will you?"
"It hurts," the teenager whimpered, rubbing his hands against his head, "It's like a part of my brain has been torn out... Like a piece of the puzzle is missing."
Peter took a deep breath, inhaling the information his Dad had given him. He'd only just became Spider-Man, or at least it felt like that to him, and he wasn't sure if he was quite ready to take of the mask. But if it meant staying on the right side of the law- the law he was trying to keep, then he'd do it what.
The brunet sat on the edge of the bed, pulling the curled up teen towards him. "You've got school, buddy. You need to go learn, become almost as smart as me!"
Steve tilted his head to look up at Ross, the ocean in his eyes swirling as if a storm was about to brew. He made eye contact with the General, doing his upmost best not to stand up and let him have it. Yet, before he could reply to the question Ross added, "If I misplaced a couple of thirty megaton nukes, you can be sure there'd be consequences."
He couldn't say no now. If he did then he'd be a complete hypocrite - and it wasn't like anything would go wrong... nothing bad ever happens in New York.
"Now..." Everett continued, "You'll be provided with an office instead of a cell. Now, do me a favour, stay in it?"
The world began to spin round as the boy was thrown against the ceiling. What was happening? Was he going crazy? His head hurt badly - really badly, and now the spinning was turning into dizziness.
What was it that Dad had told him? Name five things you see that are you favourite colour, four things you can feel, three things you can hear, two things you can smell and one thing you can taste.
Steve faced the window, making sure he could still see his ex in the reflection. The man was quivering. He was a wreck. "We are if we're not taking responsibility for our actions. These documents just shift the blame."
Sitting down on the navy beanbag beside the boy's bed, Tony yawned. His sleeping schedule had never been great but Peter's accident had only made it worse. Now that he was out of the coma, the genius would finally be able to get a peaceful night of sleep. He leant his head back against the wall, careful not knock it against any of the shelves, and closed his eyes... drifting off into a dreamless sleep.
That made no sense to the boy, who couldn't understand how him being sad was better for him than being happy. Surely his father could see that... surely?
"Enough, Mr Stark! Allow Mr Rogers to finish his statement," the judge said coldly, his eyes fixed on the genius.
The two flew out of the building, and by flew out I mean Tony flew and Peter swung. Despite it being his first time, he was webbing around as if he'd been doing it for years.
He tried to put the thought behind him as they continued into the compound, but he couldn't. It was still there - a drifting feeling at the back of his mind.
"Just don't talk about it," Tony said, glaring at the soldier as he combed his fingers through Peter's hair. "If this is what you wanted to discuss then we're leaving."
"I'm just reading the terrain," she answered. "We have made some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back."
The next day came sooner than Tony expected, and by the time both Starks were up, dressed and had eaten breakfast - pancakes for Peter and coffee for Tony - Steve and Bucky had arrived.
Rhodey got out of his seat, standing opposite the Falcon. He shook his head in disbelief. "Secretary Ross has a Congressional Medal of Honour, which is one more than you have."
"Six months, kiddo, that's how long you were out..." Steve said slowly, unsure of how Peter was going to take it.
Peter stuck his arm out and looked the other way, wincing when his Dad pulled the needle out. "It's all done, kid, you can go to sleep now."
Steve had been looking for Bucky but they hadn't been successful, even with the help from Sam Wilson and Natasha Romanoff.
"Our son, Tony, our son." Steve looked across to the judge, who appeared to be scribbling something swiftly across his paperwork.
"You're fine with signing your life away," mumbled the boy, in defiance. He wasn't too sure if this was the route he really wanted to go down but if his Dad could do it, so could he.
Later that evening, Steve assembled the team. They were all there; Ross had said they had to be.  Well everyone was there except Clint. The archer had retired - something about needing to be with his family, and not constantly risking his life. "So some of you know why you are here, some of you don't," the General began. He was the only person not sat down.
Tony threw his blazer to the floor. "That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realised what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stopped manufacturing."
"I'm saying there may be a causality." Vision paused, not for breath- as he didn't actually need to take any, but for dramatic effect. "Our very strength invites challenge; challenge invites conflict. And conflict... breeds catastrophe. Oversight... Oversight is not an idea that can be dismissed out of hand."
"What?" muttered Peter, quietly. "Is it something bad? Is it deteriorating? Is it changing? Is it evolving?"
Steve's breathing relaxed, the waterworks slowed - and a new feeling crept inside of the blond. He quickly kissed Bucky... it was a spur of the moment action, it just felt right to him. They may have conceded their love, but they had never mentioned going further with it.
He was currently in Cleveland, in his car outside of Vasily Karpov's home. It was a small place, rather ran down. The blinds were slightly torn at the edges, bitten by moths and goodness knows that else. The outside walls were adorned in graffiti, and the front of the house's pavement seemed to be the single place on the block where weeds decided to gather. Altogether it was a disgusting place.
The agent picked up Peter's bowl and placed it on the kitchen counter. "I wasn't finished!" the young boy exclaimed.
Steve nodded his head. “Right. It's a good way to flush a guy out of hiding. Set off a bomb, get your picture taken. Get seven billion people looking for the Winter Soldier.”
Before Steve had the chance to ask who the clearly delightful man was, Sharon stepped in for him. She introduced him as: "Everett Ross, Deputy Task Force Commander..."
"He wanted to make a difference, I suppose. I mean, we won't know because we dropped a building on him while we were kicking ass." Steve felt a tear roll down his face, which he swiftly destroyed evidence of by rubbing it away as quickly as it came. Tony tried to regain his composure, so he did what helped him best- par from alcohol, and drunk a large gulp of his coffee.
The teenager shrugged whilst rubbing his eyes. Eleven wasn't late for him anymore, especially with the occasional late night/early morning crime-fighting with his Dad. "You said you'd tell me if anything important happened," he slurred, blinking rapidly then waited for a second. "Did... did anything happen?"
"A spider bite?" she questioned, her face emotionless, making it hard for Peter to tell if she was joking. "Relax, I'm kidding," she added: somehow reading his mind.
"What about our lawyer?" questioned Steve, his eyebrows still raised in disbelief of this 'Everett Ross'. He threw a quick glance at Sharon, realising that she too was waiting for an answer.
"This is sick!" exclaimed Ned, his hair sticking up in every direction as the headset sat on his face. His face had turned a shade of crimson, glistening slightly from the sweat he was producing in masses. It was probably a very good idea that he was wearing a black sweatshirt.
"There was so much personality in that sentence, I'm astounded," Tony replied sarcastically. "You should go on TV."
Steve eyed his boyfriend, edging him on towards the billionaire, almost physically shoving him."I'm Bucky," he finally announced, a small smile trying to break through from his expressionless face.
Tony sighed. "I couldn't... it's just too hard. He's most likely listening to everything we say, though."
"Have wanted to do that for a long time, Tony?" she suggested, her eyes wide in a mixture of both shock and admiration. She leant against the wall, throwing a quick look at Peter before turning her gaze back to the ground.
"You might as well stay here an' send Barnes home, Cap. We're discussing tactics in a bit, and I know you wouldn't like to miss out on that."
“Pepper... you gotta tell me what’s going on.” Peter whined, using the same tone Luke Skywalker did throughout the entirety of the originals. “If Pops did something, surely I deserve to know?”
Steve frowned, picking up one of the fountain pens. He began to pace, eagerly trying to come up with a plan, where everything ended on a good note. He turned to Tony, not yet noticing the multiple screens on the walls, which were in the control room beyond them. "I'm not saying it's impossible but there would have to be safeguards."
Tony and Steve were sat opposite the bed that Peter was laying in. He was asleep, but not just out of exhaustion. He had fallen into a coma. The doctor had said he'd wake up, eventually. That for some reason his injuries had healed extremely quickly, and that he'd probably be up in no time.
"Nothing's missing, актив/asset. But if you're scared, just remember Hydra is here for you. They will never let Captain America and Iron Man do anything to you ever again."
Steve and the other man drop down, following Bucky and chase after him. The blond is panicking. If the other man got to Bucky first, there might be consequences for both men out of time. He turned around, checking for Sam. But, it isn't Sam. "Shoot," he whispered to himself. It's a Special Forces Vehicle.
"Who told you about that? Was it Stark? Hill? Tell me, Buck... I need to know which direction to shoot in on the next mission," Steve insisted, pleading with his eyes.
"And I was in a coma for six months," Peter stated calmly. However the young boy wasn't feeling very calm, his mind was taking him back to his time with Hydra. The worst time of his life. Yet he really wanted to go to KFC, Tony never let them go there, the billionaire always made them eat out at fancy restaurants, or stay at home.
"Hey..." he looked over to his kid, who was mouthing 'N' towards him. Okay. Simple. That meant that the other nerd's name began with N. The billionaire could easily work that out, after all he was a genius. "Ned," he finished. "Nice to meet you. And, call me Tony."
"I feel... stronger. As if I could lift anything, like you can when you're int our suit, or like Pops can.  I can physically see the definitions in my legs and arms. They weren't there before. And I feel hungry, really hungry. And it's not like I haven't eaten in ages..."
As Steve got closer to his ex, he realised his son was also in the room. Peter was sat on the desk chair, casually spinning it side to side, in an act of boredom. Natasha broke him from his trance. "Try not to break anything while we fix this."
Steve followed, falling to the ground in a roll. The chopper shot at the ground, tearing up the sidewalk. It was as if concrete was being shot at the three as they sprinted along after each other. Bucky jumped, landing in an underpass. Instead of waiting, he decided to run through the traffic.
For the next five hours, Peter and Tony tested out every single possible power they thought the teen could have. And, once they were done, they started working on a suit. Peter designed the majority of it - leaving Tony to work on the engineering of  it.
"Ah, right," Steve said, trying to picture the event the two men had attended. That day was something he wouldn't forget - but not because of the Expo - all of that had happened on the same day he had become Captain America... or at least he had had the serum.
"I'll go get changed then," Peter stated sulkily, but he was stopped by his Dad's grasp on his shoulder: which was forcing him to stop in his tracks.
As in response to his question, Peter - and the many other things were swiftly flung to the ceiling. The gravity in the room. Gone. "It's remarkable what a reliable source of mining labour will get you, when you lend it out to a billionaire."
Natasha then said something she never thought she would be saying. "Maybe Tony's right..." Tony must have found it surprising too as he was fast to turn his head in her direction. "If we have one hand on the wheel, we can still steer. If we take it off-"
Sighing, Tony once again picked up his son: cradling him in his arms. "Kiddo... what am I going to do with you?"
Bucky placed his hand onto Steve's, making sure to gain his partner's attention. "No. He already hates me for just being your boyfriend. He'd kill me, Steve."
Steve threw the cop up onto the landing, making sure that his gun was far enough away to not be a danger. He then hurled an oncoming hostile over his shoulder, allowing the man to hit the concrete. He could hear the whimper escape the German's mouth, surprisingly he didn't feel as guilty as he thought he would.
He watched as the door began to open, but he couldn't keep his eyes open. Something was making them flicker shut, causing them to feel extremely heavy. His head was pounding, aching, it felt like his brain was shaking. He had to stay... he had to... he had... everything faded out of his vision.
"The man, who I once called a loving husband, is no more than a drunk and an addict - one who has access to a weaponised suit, and multiple laboratories. He has had many careers, which I - and I presume the court will too - believe are unsuitable for a single father. He has been a weapons manufacturer-"
"Anything happen back in there?" Tony asked, wondering if this all started because of something going wrong at Oscorp.
"You 'kay kid?" Clint asked, dropping down from the vents, where he had probably been hiding away in a for an unreasonably long period of time.
"Would you like me to make you something to eat, Peter?" asked Vision, who happened to be walking through one of the walls at that moment.
Steve stopped him, interjecting, "Shut up, Tony. We need to find Peter - if he's here, before they move him."
Peggy could have been alone when she passed... or as Steve would rather think, she had been surrounded by her carers: the people who had looked after her for the last few years. It was best not to think about it, though. Death and Steve Rogers didn't really get along.
"Dad?" Peter asked, pressing his head towards the right of Tony's arc reactor. "Why aren't I allowed to stay here... with you?"
"I think so... I wasn't really paying attention though, most of the stuff wasn't nearly as advanced as what you make."
"All the great elements named after people," Ned said, laughing. "Bohrium, Curium, Einsteinium, Lawrencium, Fermium, Rutherfordium and Peterium."
Slowly opening the door, Tony crept into Peter's room. What did he talk about first: the DNA results, or Steve? Both had turned into a swarm of butterflies, fluttering around his stomach. He felt nervous. Uneasy. Scared.
Tony rubbed his eye, crossing his fingers that none of his tears had shown. "I don't know, bud, I... I don't know."
Sam and Scott both grinned. Then the falcon crept a little closer to the pair on the sofa, "Actually, I think I'd rather help the metal man."
The man gently pushed the boy towards the bed, "Stay in here, актив/asset, you'll be safe." Then he headed out of the room - locking the door behind him.
Bucky let out a hearty chuckle, "So a scrawny kid from New York, who thinks he can save - and help - everybody."
"I don't wanna go!" the boy yelled, his sneakers scuffing against the marble floor. "You can't make me go!"
"Pepper?" Steve questioned. He knew the woman; she was a kind, intelligent, if somewhat stubborn person, who managed to get even Tony Stark to do as she said. Steve wouldn't be ashamed to say he admired her.
"Just call him," Bucky insisted, watching as Steve hesitated outside the Tower. They had been been stood there for fifteen minutes. Luckily the weather wasn't too bad, especially after the cold weather he was used too.
"Oh, we're not going to kill..." he pressed the gun against Peter's chest, "you. We're just going to kill Peter Stark-Rogers."
"It's the Imperial Star Destroyer... The Ultimate Collector's Series 10030 one! It's like the second biggest Star Wars Lego set you can get! It's crazy! It has three thousand pieces!" The boy sounded so excited. Only things like Lego could do this to him. And science.
Peter didn't know what to answer with. He could remember darkness. He could remember coldness. Lots of it. And it was never good.
"Cool..." Peter replied absentmindedly, trying to stay out of the headspace that overcame him every time he saw his Pops. It was nothing personal against the blond- well maybe it was, but it more to do with the tension that surrounded them that started whenever they were left alone together.
Peter sat down on his bed, shuffling over when Bucky came over to him, sitting next to him. "So you're Spider-Man...You got powers, Pete?"
"GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done... to stave off something worse." Tony didn't like all this blame, this guilt. It wasn't his fault. He was trying to do what was best for the team. There wasn't much to work with. He was doing his best.
Steve threw him a worried look, hurrying to follow after him. He watched as his boyfriend chucked a man over the railings and ran to catch him. He did. Why he did it.... he didn't know. Maybe it was his moral, maybe he just didn't want to see his friend kill more than he had to. He looked at Bucky wearily. "Come on man!"
"Finally done, are we, актив/asset? It's taken you long enough," Zemo stayed roughly, "In future I hope you complete orders quickly."
Tony gave him one of his signature the adults are talking looks, forcing the teen to return to his meal.
In a deadpan voice, Ned asked, "What was it like watching the fall of the Galactic Republic, Mr Stark?"
Steve snorted with laughter. "I had a sudden image of you trying to take down Loki by kicking him in the knees."
"What are you doing in here, bud?" Tony asked, walking into Peter's room - a few minutes after Steve and Bucky had left.
"What are you going to do, elbow me in the chest?" Steve asked with a chuckle in his voice, not particularly trying to get a rise out of the other man but trying to hide the nervousness that was slowly setting into his gut: his Bucky was gone, gone into the Winter Soldier, and had taken Peter. Peter, his and Tony's son - it was too terrifying to dwell on for too long.
Bucky raised his eyebrows, "What the hell does fondue mean? Please tell me there is a meaning and you weren't just trying to make it rhyme?"
"I'm your Pops, Peter, why the heck aren't you talking to me?" he asked, the anger in his question directed at himself and not his son.
"Wanda?" Steve asked, his eyes widening in panic. "What about Wanda?" The girl was too young to get mixed up in all this. She was practically a child compared to the rest of the team.
Anyway, even if they did take the ones they knew about away, they were so many more that they'd never find. Tony was an intelligent man, after all. No one would ever outsmart him. Ever. Except maybe Peter.
The redhead took a deep breath. “Peter, I can’t tell you because I don’t know. If I knew I’d say... I promise.”
"Right," Steve replied, still somewhat uncertainly. For the next thirty minutes of the film, the blond remained silent whilst it played. However when r cut to a section on his own team: The Howling Commandos, he couldn't hold it in anymore.
He couldn't bring himself to say anything else. It was too hard. The knot inside his stomach had grown tighter, tugging at him painfully. Had he felt feelings for Peggy, back then? Maybe... but it was only because feeling them for Bucky would have meant execution.
Multiple police cars were following after them, the chase getting bigger and more intense. Steve continues to swerve, trying to ignore his conscience. He hit another car but decided to keep on going. He was already in deep, there was no point backing out now.
"That is not what this meeting is about, Agent Romanoff," Ross declared, silencing the assassin. "As you all know, you - The Avengers, are the saviours of peace. You protect everyone."
A few moments later, the judge got the three men's attention. "Alright, we have come to an agreement," he paused, inhaling and exhaling once, before resuming, "We believe that Mr Rogers and Mr Barnes should take custody of Mr Stark-Rogers. However, we would like to keep an eye on how he settles in with you, before making it a permanent arrangement."
Pepper and Tony had come up with a getaway code for the man back when he first decided that meetings were boring and that ditching them for another hour in the workshop was way more fun. It generally got used once or twice a month but no one had noticed it so far, or if they had they just let the man run off to play with his robots.
"I will repeat myself, актив/asset, you will do as I say," said the man as he let the knife drop to the floor, ignoring the clang of metal against polished stone.
Bucky nodded, clearly impressed that flying cars were now a thing. The blond that was stood beside him, however, looked a little confused. "Why're you asking, Buck?"
Once dinner was finished, Peter and Ned decided to head back into the games room, deciding to venture into another reality....
Zemo smirked at Peter's remark as he took a few steps towards the boy. His footsteps were slow and silent, just like a predator before it pounced on its prey. He came closer, and closer, until he was near enough that the kid could feel the man's breath on him. The man then placed his hand below the boy's chin, tilting it upright so the teen was looking him right in the eye. "Oh, but you are our asset, whether you like it or not."
Sharon tossed a piece of paper towards Sam. “The receipt for your gear...” She smirked, when the Falcon read out what it said- tucking her hair behind her ears at the same time.
Laughing, Steve placed the wallet back in his jacket. "He does, doesn't he? We adopted him back after the Battle of New York, against Loki and the Chitauri..." Then, after noticing Bucky's confused expression, he added, "Thor, one of the Avengers - a celestial being - his brother tried to take over Earth. They were from outer space, Buck, and they were evil. It's how the Avengers was formed."
Eventually, when the clock read 3am, Tony shooed Peter off to bed - telling him that he needed to sleep. Despite Peter's protests, the billionaire won the argument.
Tony shook his head, placing his hands over his eyes, as Peter said, "What was Pops talking 'bout? I'm not an Avenger. How does it affect me?"
“Steve, we looked for the guy for almost two years and it took all of our resources to find him.” Sam rubbed his head and added in a whisper, “Man, I still have so much sleep to catch up on.”
He picked up the shirt, realising that they were going to want him to change - and that if he didn't, they wouldn't hesitate to force him. There were definitely cameras in the room, Peter knew that, and he was slightly embarrassed to get undressed in front of people (even if he couldn't actually see them). After all, he was a teenager. But the clothes were so soft compared to the sweaty, dirty and torn he was currently adorned in, so he decided to get it over and done with.
"Mornin', Dad," he mumbled through a piece of dry toast he was eating. It was clear he was still tired but Tony could see the excitement on his son's face, and decided against dragging him back to his bed.
"They did this to you. They're the reason you can't remember." The man looked like he was trying to regain his composure as he added: "Are you sure you can't remember anything?"
"Wake up, buddy, wake up." Tony's voice was straining; the billionaire was in pain. He couldn't watch his son hurt like this. They needed to get him back to the Tower. He needed private treatment, from a doctor who knew what they were doing. Not from some state hospital - that just wouldn't do for his kid.
Tony sighed, giving in to Steve's anger. He sat down on one of the spinning chairs - watching as Peter started to play with his gadget.
The young teen did as he was told, forcing himself up off of the ground. He was slightly grateful to see something, or someone, other than the white walls that made up the room, but he knew that his gratitude wouldn't last for long. His knees were shaking, causing the rest of his body to tremble alongside them. His face was pale, and he was certain that everything that had happened yesterday would be a walk in the park compared to whatever would happen today.
Peter finally made it to the kitchen at 10am, wearing one of: Tony's white tees, Clint's brown flannels and his own navy sweatpants.
Peter's head snapped up to stare at Zemo, realising the question was directed at him as there was nobody else in the room. "I'm not your asset so don't call me that," he replied angrily, before letting his head hang towards the floor.
"No, it's okay. You can talk about him, Pete. I don't mind. But, what exactly do you mean you're now like me and your Pops?"
"Well," said Tony, "It's about the spider bite. I did the tests, and all, and found out somethings happened to your DNA."
A few hours later, Steve received a call. He had been expecting it, waiting for it even. Ever since the modestly sized television in the corner of his and Bucky's bedroom lit up with a a news article about the Wakandan King T'Chaka's death, and how The Winter Soldier was supposedly behind it, he had been sat on his bed, clutching his phone.
"Are you sure you want to do this, Pete?" Tony asked from the other side of the room, watching as his son picked up the pen to sign the Accords. Ross was stood behind Peter's chair, watching the teen in a mixture of fear and morbid curiosity.
Ned nodded his head in agreement. "Yeah, you're probably right," he added, catching onto Flash's joke.
Tony at that point untucked his shirt and waltzed out of the room, ready to head home to Peter. However, one thought kept flashing through his mind: where would Steve be staying? Surely he and Bucky wouldn't be staying at The Hub forever.
Standing still in absolute silence, Rhodey blinked. He was blinking in a sign of recognition to what Spencer had gone. He felt bad, guilty. He knew why Tony wanted to go against the Accords, and he wanted to too. Wanda opened her mouth to speak but Stark beat her to it.
"Come on, Peter," Steve begged from the other side of the teen's bedroom door. "You need to eat." In truth, Peter knew that not eating wouldn't go down too well with his new abilities, yet he didn't want to sit out there with them.
"Tony, if you want to have this talk with me, we'll have it later. Fury called me earlier, found some leads on Bucky, told me to meet him today. Goodbye," Steve said sternly. He was in no mood to argue with his husband, especially over something that involved his son's safety. And anyway, he had more pressing matters on hand: he hadn't seen his old pal's face in forever.
"Will I still be able to see him... if things don't work out between you two?" Peter asked, in a more mature manner than Tony expected from him.
Peter shook his head, determined that he could remain in control of his actions. He couldn't become like Bucky, just another mindless soldier that did exactly as ordered too. The outside world already seemed a distance memory - like when you envision school during the summer break...
Where was he then? Hydra, those were the bad guys, right? The same people who had infiltrated the Nazis back in the war - the one his Pops had fought in. God, his Pops really was old. This must be one of their bunkers. He could recall the team, his family, going about destroying as many as possible in the last few years. They stopped after the Ultron and Sokovia incident. He had to get out. And soon.
Tony pulled away from Peter, when his phone started vibrating. "Just gonna take this call, why don't you test out the web shooters?"
"Did I say you could talk?" the man spat, glaring at the small boy in front of him. Peter shook his head, not sure if the question was rhetorical or not. Regardless of that, he didn't want to risk speaking again.
"Shield can take him, Steve. They won't kill him. I can promise you that but they'll be able to sedate him. Maybe after a few forensics and lie detector tests they'll let you see him."
"Steve won the case, he's picking Pete up from here tomorrow morning... it's a two week trial run: if the court like what they see... Rogers and Barnes have him for good," Tony explained, wiping away the tears that had began to flow.
Steve smiled, knowing that his kid was back to himself - or at least much closer to his original state than the day before. "You want some pancakes, kid?"
Tony grabbed at one of the blanket's creases, fiddling with it in his hands. He could see his son fighting to stay awake, the need to know being the only thing forcing his eyes to stay open. If he told Peter, the kid would be worried sick... but if he didn't tell him, the boy would know he was lying. "Kid... every enhanced individual has to sign this contract."
"That's not for- Oh... I don't know.... haven't really thought about it," Peter mumbled, realising that his birthday was a whole lot closer than it felt. This whole 'I've been asleep for half a year' thing was strange and unnerving to him. He couldn't imagine how waking up in the future - like his Pops, would have felt. "I guess whatever I said I wanted for Christmas..."
At that point, Peter peered his head out of his room, giving a scared nod. "Sorry," he whispered, "Couldn't help but overhear everything you just said."
"Be quiet!" Tony hissed, jabbing Steve in the gut with his elbow. "Or I'll be the one fighting you instead of a Hydra agent!"
Steve's phone went off. The Captain picked it up slowly and brought it close enough to read the notification. It was a text. "I gotta go," he mumbled.
"And how long will the temporary stay last, exactly?" Tony asked, trying his upmost best not to show his emotions. It was something he had mastered, not just from being famous but, from having Howard as his father. Howard had always told him to man up, prove that he was a Stark because: 'Stark men are made of iron.' Any show of weakness made his father mad at him, normally ending with him being punished; to be honest it was the only time Howard really interacted with him, even though it was in a negative way.
It still hurt, though. Even Spider-Man wasn't strong enough to dismiss pain. Yet, Peter knew this wouldn't break him - at least, it wouldn't break him for now.
A man, who had curly, black hair, which somehow avoided his empty, grey eyes, stood in front of where Bucky was being held. He looked at the soldier, taking in everything the man out of time did. He hid his smile, trying not to show how happy he was that he had managed to be the one allowed to evaluate Barnes. “Hello, Mr. Barnes. I've been sent by the United Nations to evaluate you. Do you mind if I sit? Your first name is James?”
"Steve..." Bucky mumbled, placing his pint of beer back down on the table. He stared at the  foaming liquid before continuing to speak. "I killed Howard."
"Whatever it takes," the young boy piped. If he had to do this to stay a law-abiding hero, he would do. "I'll... I'll do it. I'll sign. I will, Dad... I'll sign it. I'm Spider-Man; I can defend myself. And anyway, the Tower is well protected."
Peter suddenly stood up, his eyes wide. "I just remembered. I got some homework to do." The teen then ran out of the room, before anyone could question him on his choice of excuse.
The Captain nodded, "The final point I'd like to make is that Tony has been keeping stuff from me, stuff about Peter's well-being. I'm not sure what but I know he's hiding it. Even if it was just a bug, I'm pretty sure Tony should be informing me."
"Who else signed?" Steve asked, coldly. He didn't want to be the only one who didn't. Sam wasn't going to sign but he was only one person. One incredibly awesome person but one person all the same.
"Mister Wilson, if you would please listen for a minute... For the past 4 years, you operated with unlimited power and no supervision. That's an arrangement the governments of the world can no longer tolerate. But I think we have a solution. The Sokovia Accords. Approved by one hundred and seventeen countries. It states, that the Avengers shall no longer be a private organization. Instead, they'll operate under the supervision of a United Nations Panel, only when and if that Panel deems it necessary."
"Got him," Sam replies as he flew down and shoved the chopper off course. He grinned, the adrenaline of the battle really getting to him. It reminded him of Riley- the action they faced... He swooped down towards the street below.
Tony fell to his knees beside the blond, shaking his head in denial. "Pete, kiddo, this isn't your time to go. You've gotta wake up." His voice began to shake, his eyes watering as he stammered, "You've gotta wake up, right now."
"They've set the perimeter." That was Sam. He was talking about the German Special Forces that were rapidly approaching from the south. They didn't have long but Steve needed to get his Bucky back.
"You what?" laughed Steve, almost choking on his  drink. He glanced across at the brunet, surveying his expression. It was solemn, but sad, emotionless, yet guilty. He wasn't sure if he had heard right, though; Bucky couldn't have possibly killed the genius that both had grown to love (or maybe just tolerate) during the war.
"Tony!" Steve exclaimed, "You chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our rights to choose... What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go and they don't let us! We may not be perfect but the safest hands are still our own."
Asset? What were they talking about? They mustn't mean, they couldn't mean, did they? As a lightbulb formed in Peter's brain, Bucky Barnes walked in and stood beside the man.
Peter eyed his Dad, looking for a reassuring nod of his head, or any type of noticeable approval. Tony smiled back at him, a comforting smile - signalling the fourteen year old to continue.
He walked out of the lab, leaving Tony alone. He hated being this angry. He hated being this mad. But, why didn't Tony trust him enough with something as important as Peter's health? They had raised the kid since he was ten, since his only left relatives had passed. They were as much a family as any could be. Why did Tony have to go and ruin that?
"I know that, Pete," he said, rolling his eyes. "Come on, what do you think of it? I slaved in the kitchen for two hours for this so I'm not letting you go with just agreeing with other people's comments!"
"At the moment it's  fine, but back when I was feeling worse. When there were loads of people, when I was feeling stressed... I could barely see. It was like looking into a kaleidoscope: everything was refracted and reflected and I couldn't concentrate."
Their queries were halted, when they saw Tony Stark physically dragging Peter towards the glass doors. "Underoos, you gotta do this for me, you have to go with them," the brunet pleaded.
"It's just- it's just he's not capable of looking after a kid on his own. Sure, he's a great dad - the complete opposite to what his own father was to him... but he's too allowing! He lets Peter do whatever he wants. I bet the kid's been staying up all night - living off chocolate milk, since I've not been there. I remember, once, when Tony bought Peter a freakin' car because the kid asked for one. He was twelve... twelve!" rambled Steve, his face going red as he struggled to catch his breath.
Tony took another look at the results on his monitor, and gasped in surprise. "Oh, shit." A gap formed in his chest as he realised no one was going to yell language at him. No one was going to correct his profanity - not today, and if things didn't go well with Steve, not ever again.
"Buck," interjected Steve, "I had a family. Me and Tony... well we haven't exactly been getting on lately. My son, on the other hand, well I don't know what Tony has been telling him."
"He's... he's, we just need to get him out of here," Steve stuttered, picking up his son, and carrying him in a bridal hold. He stood up, indicating for his ex husband to follow.
"I didn't want you to be alone." The assassin pulled him into a hug, something they'd never done- at least never outside of missions. He could recall their kiss. Shake the thought, Steve, he screamed to himself. Shake the thought.
Bucky stood up, hearing the thuds against the wooden door, and walked over to it. He slid the golden chain off the lock and cautiously opening it. "Hello?" he asked, "Do I know you?"
Bucky smirked, "Only one of those things are true, and let me tell you, Stevie, we all know you're an idiot."
Peter never finished his sentence as Tony engulfed him in a Trojan horse hug, which was hiding a million tickles. "Save me, Sam, Scott... Save me!"
"So I can do this." Tony flicked a silver lever beneath the steering wheel. A red interface system appeared on the dashboard, similar to the one inside his suits. "Fri, turn on auto-drive mode; take us to the Tower."
Bucky grabbed a mattress, lifting it with such ease that it appeared to way nothing. He pushed it to his side, blocking an attack from the window. Then he pushed a table towards the door, delaying their pursuers by a fraction as they began to swing into the building on cables.
Peter finished the book a few hours later, his eyes stinging as the final words made their way into his mind. He knew he had a somewhat decent memory, but he wasn't sure he'd call it photographic. However at that instance, he hoped he was just being modest.
"You'll be safe because that's your folks coming to rescue you," Peter whispered, putting his hand on the boy's shoulder.
Tony didn't respond to the Captain. Instead, he stood up - Peter copying him, and they walked out of the restaurant before ordering anything. "Come on, Peter, we're going."
"Da-Dad?" Peter asked sheepishly from beneath the mountain of blankets he was hiding under. He had been there since eight, when Tony had been pulled into the meeting earlier that day.
Hydra used to call him James... back before they had fully wiped his memory. Back when he still screamed for Steve through the tortures the organisation had concocted.
Tony gave him a soft smile. "Fine, Pete. You know what you can do. You can invite that friend of yours over... Ted, isn't it?" This was probably an awful idea. The two fanboy geeks together in the Tower that held all of their heroes. Peter had adjusted to it rather quickly but his friend had never gotten over the fact that his best friend's fathers defend the Earth.
"There was a voice, in my head. She said 'are you alright, Master Peter, your heart rate is getting dangerously high,' and it scared me," Peter replied, through his breaths: as he climbed down from the wall.
"No. Tony. Listen to me. For once in your life, stop pretending you're the most important person in the world. Cos you're not, you aren't..."
Peter shrugged. It was perfectly plausible. Especially when you lived in a building, which is home to: an enhanced super soldier, a man with an arc reactor in place of his heart, a physical AI, a girl with awesome - and kind of weird - powers, a man who thinks he's a hawk, a man who thinks he's a falcon, a man who can grow real big - and real small, and an incredible assassin.
Flash and MJ joined them on the row behind them. "Hey, losers," MJ said jokingly, "Ready to die of boredom on this trip?"
"No. No, I haven't. They were... they were d-dead, that's different," he shouted, breaking down by the end of the sentence. He fell to the floor, head in his hands.
The brunet picked it up, quickly skimming through a few of the pages. "The Sokovia Accords? They want the team to sign it? All of us? They want us to work for them and them alone..?"
Fury snorted, "I see the way you look at each other, Cap, I bet you twenty dollars that you'll be wed to him in the next decade, and when have I ever lost a bet to you?"
It was a comfortable change. While they were by no means on good terms, it was almost nice to have a functioning conversation about their life together without any hard feelings.
"They always are," Sam added, who had just crept into the room without anyone noticing. "Morning y'all."
This triggered something in Peter's subconscious mind as he quickly muttered back the snarky reply of, "Don't need to go... already smarter."
"I totally agree with you, now. Sure, I wanted to choose a fight that included The Inquisitor but that was really fun." He pulled the headset off of his head, waiting patiently as his friend did the same.
"The kid's fine, Steven, let it go. You didn't need to know at the time, it's not important," Tony exclaimed, sure now that this was his final chance to keep his son's custody.
Tony pondered over that phrase: everything else. What else was Peter referring to? Did he mean the breakup between him and Steve? Or did he mean the spider bite and the powers he had received from it?
It was a decent question. If Bucky didn't remember him, why would the soldier save his life? Unfortunately, the brunet was reluctant to provide an answer- and Steve wasn't sure if this was due to Hydra's training or because the man actually had nothing else to say. "I don't know..." he provided, which gave Steve next to nothing.
"It's not on an Avengers pay role," Tony would say, before heading off into the distance: leaving the fourteen year old to catch up with him.
"Soldier, would you care to remove Peter's restraints?" the man asked, directing the order at Bucky.
"You ever gonna feel up to going back there? And if you don't think you will... Would you rather be homeschooled by me and anyone else who wants to help?" Tony asked, remembering the struggles of dealing with both Stark Industries and being a fully fledged hero. Sure, this was school and not work they were talking about but balancing two lives is quite hard.
"Lies probably," the brunet whispered, "I can't imagine you doing anything wrong, Rogers. You're too good a person."
Christmas. That had been so long ago for Tony, yet for Peter it had never came. It had been the worse holiday in the history of winters for the philanthropist. Not the first without family, just the first where he was missing the people he loved. "Right..." the man said quickly, trying to move on from the current topic: it was just a little too awkward to discuss right now, "What about what you want for lunch?"
The other man, who Steve has just began to realise resembled a wild cat of some sort, slashed at Bucky with his claws. The assassin dodged the attack. Just. He had held up a metal bar to protect himself.
Steve shook his head in annoyance, using all his willpower not to huff. "What are we giving up to do it.....? I'm sorry, Nat, I.... I can't sign it." He brought his hand to his face, leaning into it. Maybe it would make this Sokovia stuff disappear.
"Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way..." He craned his neck, looking up at the ceiling in disbelief, before forcing his eyes to make contact with the genius'.
Steve glanced at the bot from over the documents he was currently skimming through. "Are you saying it's our fault?" He sounded worried. Concerned. Guilty. The soldier didn't know whether it was their fault. What if it was their fault Hydra has resurfaced? What if it was their fault Loki had decided to come to Earth? He knew it was definitely someone's fault that a robot had tried to kill everyone.
Peter paused from his ranting, taking deep breaths. It wasn't working: he wasn't able to calm down. Then he jumped back in shock, landing on the wall behind him.
Steve raised his eyebrows. He then exhaled before saying, "So you... The Winter Soldier killed Tony's dad?"
"Morning, Dad," mumbled Peter whilst turning onto his side. He ended up going a little too far, and landed on the floor with a thud.
"You did fail one... you didn't kill me. You saved me." Steve blinked, holding back the tears. He could picture the moment. He could replay it through his mind. He was injured - in agony, even. Bucky was there, about to land the killing blow. But he hesitated. He didn't kill him. He just watched as the ground gave way and Steve plummeted. Steve could still remember the wave of memories that flooded his pal's face as he realised who he was fighting. As he realised who his mission was.
"How are you, актив/asset?" asked the man, who he had just realised was sat on the chair opposite the bed. The man wore a dark suit, with a red emblem sewn into the sleeve. His hair was gelled to the right at the parting and glistened under the LED lighting.
"Again, that is all in the past: people," he slammed his hands against the wooden desk, "This happened, before I got this," he points at his arc reactor, "This happened, before I even considered having a family."
"Bucky?" croaked Peter, who was yet to notice the man's empty eyes, and expressionless face. He got no answer: the man seemed to be in a daydream-like state.
The teen stopped. He didn't really have an answer. Maybe it was because Pepper was a woman. That kind of made sense- it wasn't like he had ever seen either of his parents in a heterosexual relationship before. He hadn't really seen his Dad flirt with anyone other than Pops... or, more likely, he had just never noticed him flirt with others.
"Ah, okay... Me and Buck better be off, then. And don't worry about walking us out, I know the way."
"What makes you think that you won't be there with us, kiddo? If Pep likes me, and she does, she's gonna get the whole package. Somehow she's gonna have to put up with you, Spiderling," said Tony. He walked over to the bar area, grabbing himself a whisky glass and a bottle.
"Hey, Peter," Bucky said calmly. He was watching the television; a show about penguins was on - one voiced by Sir David Attenborough.
Ross eventually left, leaving the room full of heroes- who happened to all have different ideas on whether it was right or wrong. Sam stood up, and exclaimed that, "That Ross guy's an idiot. How can the world be safe if the Avengers ain't here to save it?"
"Well, Stark, he doesn't really have a choice now... does he?" the General said, smiling at the man's lack of control over the situation. The powerful Tony Stark finally having to listen to the law because he wouldn't want his son hurt, would he now? "If he doesn't sign then I'll have to detain him."
Tony stared into space for a second, before replying with, "Shit. Pep, can you clear my schedule for the rest of the day... Pete, come on." The genius stood up, indicating for his son to follow. "See you later, Ross."
"Pops?" Peter whispered, trying to reach Steve, stretching his hand out as far as possible. Steve moves over to Peter's side.
The brunet walked over to his desk and picked up a stapler. He tossed it towards Peter's right side, staring in amazement as his son caught it without even looking at the flying stationary.
Natasha was there, though. At the conference. The one which has been bombed. He could only pray she was okay. What was he talking about? Of course she was okay. She's the Black Widow, nothing can beat her. Maybe nothing but the love that is directed to her friends. Her family.
"I have," Tony agreed, whilst sitting down and removing his sunglasses. He glared over to the two men sat a few metres away from him - the two men standing between him and his precious kid, his precious Peter.
Without opening his eyes, Peter shook his head. "Nuh Uh," he mumbled, rolling into a ball for warmth. Tony could see that the kid hadn't been sleeping, or at least he hadn't slept much. The man knew the signs - clear as a summer's day - after all he spent nearly all of the night awake. And by nearly all, he really meant 99.9%.
"Oh..." Bucky pondered for a second, knowing full well what Spider-Man did every night, normally alongside Iron Man. He had ended up on one of those websites, the first time he had gone on the internet, that was called The Spider-Fan Huh and had read all about him. Despite him being a fairly new hero, he seemed to have a huge fan base.
A man aimed at Bucky, his gun following the assassin's head. Steve knocked the man's gun out of his hands with his shield whilst Bucky leapt down the stairway once again. He caught onto the railing with his flesh hand. Then he climbed up onto the floor, ran down the corridor and threw himself off of the balcony. He tumbled onto the lower roof of the neighbouring building, where he found where his backpack had landed. He picked it up and ran.
Steve shook his head, laughing, "I thought we trusted each other. That when we married we would never keep secrets from each other. That's why I came down here to tell you that we found Bucky. However, if you can't trust me with something involving our son, Tony, I think I'm gonna go stay the night at The Hub... with him."
Steve stood up, placing his hand on Peter's shoulder. "Come on, kiddo. Come in the lounge with me and Bucky, ever since he found out you can play chess he's been bugging me to invite you over to play..."
"Coms are down in the main sector. Hyde says Zemo's dead," one of the agents stated, occasionally staring at the Soldier before throwing his glance to the other side of the room.
The boy buried his face in a pillow, trying to block out the outside world. His senses were dialled to eleven - giving him a super headache. "Nothing," he muffled through the cushion.
Steve smiled, recognising the words that came from his friend's mouth. "I know. And it's just... you being here is so surreal. And I mean you being here, not The Winter Soldier." He watched as Bucky beamed at him, a smile that he hadn't seen that frequently. "Bucky, I think I'm love with you."
"We'll have to run some tests on you, kiddo. See what the bite's done to you, treat it before your Pops finds out," Tony informed his son.
"Wanda?" Steve liked the kid. She was tough, able to stand up for herself. She had been through loads, everywhere she went was basically a trek through a sand dune.
"Dad was always the pain in the ass, you know. I'm following in his footsteps. But anyway, he and mom always managed to make it work," Tony stated. "Me and Pepper will be able to, too."
“Yeah, but that doesn't guarantee that whoever framed him would get him. It guarantees that we would,” Sharon cut in. Then, she turned her attention to the screen showing Bucky and the evaluator.
"Stand down, now," Rhodey ordered. His voice is stern, sterner than Steve has ever heard it to be before. He watched as Bucky remained still beside Steve, only turning his head slightly to watch as Steve placed his shield back on his back. "Congratulations, Cap. You're a criminal."
