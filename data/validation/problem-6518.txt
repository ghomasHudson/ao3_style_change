“Ma we haven’t even had dinner yet,” the Alpha scolded, knowing it’s a lost cause when it came to his Ma. Especially since Harley is technically his first grandbaby...and there is another on the way...
His husband, who was having surgery next week. Heart surgery. And had planned on telling Joey today, telling the blonde he hadn’t wanted to ruin her fun weekend. He was suddenly scrambling his brain trying to remember if he’d wanted Steve to sit in for that conversation…
“I got you something,” the blonde finally said. Presents always intrigued the genius, who instantly perked up at the prospect. Steve reached into his gym bag he had placed by his feet and pulled out a small plastic red and white ball, placing it on the table between the two. Tony simply stared at the toy, not sure entirely if Steve even knew what this was.
“I was going for dramatic effect, Dad,” Miles said as he sighed heavily, reminding him so much of Tony it made him laugh. “Also it should be noted I am technically the only queen. Meaning I have reigning superiority.”
“You wanna take a quick nap? JARVIS said the flight is only an hour and a half,” Steve offered as he put their luggage away, coming over to sit next to Tony. Before he could answer a yawn took him over, getting a chuckle from his husband. Plus it was just a perfect excuse to procrastinate having the dreaded talk. He woke up in his second favorite way, gentle kisses over his face and neck.
“Uh oh, I think he’s right,” her equally frustrating Pop added. She rolled her eyes at both of them until she heard May speak up.
“Oh honey, why not? You know this won’t change things between us, right? I know a lot has changed with you in the last few months...with me and Steve bonding, then us moving into this house and now I’m pregnant...but baby, It’s not like you're going anywhere,” Tony said as a joke, feeling bad when his pup shut his eyes and actually began crying. “Bambino,” the Omega murmured, reaching over to grab his boy and bring him into his lap.
“You can tell her that later,” Tony said after kissing his shoulder. “She might need a few minutes to cool off.” Steve considered his words, but still didn’t know how to tell a kid it’s okay that someone that was supposed to love them didn’t…
“Don’t look at me,” the older Omega said with a laugh and shrugged shoulders, taking his turn to hug Tony before the two turned to the pup.
The four waited as the music and lyrics played throughout the kitchen. Peter and Emerson started dancing on their stools to the beat. Tony held up a finger to his husband, indicating the reference would come soon. After some crude words the chorus started and Tony looked back into his husband’s eyes as it played.
“My pleasure, Miss. If you would, grab your smart phone from the bedside table and I will connect the call remotely.” She grabbed the phone Tony had given her long ago, ever amazed at technology, and placed it against her ear. She heard the line click and Steve’s voice in the phone.
“Night Romeo, night crazy pants. Let me know if you need any more asses kicked,” he called as he walked away.
“Woah,” she said with her hands out, smiling when he came to a gentle stop. “We can play if you want but we gotta go to the gym floor. It’s okay to break things down there.” The green giant actually pouted in response.
. Apparently Emerson lied yesterday at dinner when she told fake stories about how her day at school had been.
Peter put a tracker in the suit and made him check in every hour, while Wade was on standby should Spiderman need assistance from Deadpool.
“Well…” Em interrupted the silence, “sounds like you should go tell him that.” She gave him a small smile that warmed his heart. Up until this point, Steve had been very respectful of her personal space…knowing her history with men. Any doubts were squashed, however, when he brought her into his chest and wrapped his arms around her. He noticed the slight hesitation from her, only for a moment, before extracting her arms to wrap around his middle. The father selfishly relished hugging his daughter.
“You don’t know that, kiddo,” Tony piped in softly, “you still could’ve asked us or at least told us about it after.” She glared a little at the man, unable to stop the words from coming out.
“It’s Wade,” Emerson said quietly, “he died in combat. His friend said he saved thirteen civilians before…dying in an explosion.” She winced at her last words, when Peter’s cries increased.
“He’s lying, Xavier tattled because he wants to make sure you actually go through with it,” Pop answered quickly, but not before shoving his husband on the couch.
When the elevator doors dinged open, Tony once again took control and shoved Steve back into his entrance-way. They continued kissing as they also began taking off each other’s close, Steve only now realizing how badly he’d wanted this.
“Is yours as good as your Ma’s hot chocolate?” Bucky asked, getting a laugh out of the blonde as Steve began to pull the ingredients out of the cabinet and fridge.
“Just the one! No offense handsome,” Mr. Stark said to Sam, “I’ve just got a thing for blondes, Pepper can vouch for that.”
"Hey Em, want your Pop and I to stick around or would that not be helpful?" he asked as she eyed the two fathers for a moment, before her eyes settled on Steve's chest.
Kimberly had reached out to Tony to leave her contact info in case Emerson wanted to speak with her. One of Tony’s assistants had been the one to relay the message. He remembers showing Emerson – but she tore up the sheet with her contact info before he had a chance to say anything.
“Oh, well he knew he was going to have a tough day at work today. He wasn’t looking forward to it is all.”
“I’m not letting you go, Leo. Not until I know you won’t run again,” Pete said as calmly as possible, ignoring passing people who stared.
“Look, I love your family. But we’ve been spending all of our time with them. And I’ve really missed your cock,” Clint said blatantly with a shoulder shrug. His boyfriend playfully shoved his shoulder as Stark pulled up in his mustang. The two teens slid in the backseat as Steve nodded to them from the passenger seat.
But hanging with her pseudo aunt and uncle was always fun. The two always stocked up on junk food and took her out for fun grown up stuff.
He took Lucky to the park, sitting under his favorite tree as he watched his pup fetch a stick. Instead of bringing the stick back to him, he ran with it straight past him. Clint turned his head in confusion, before he saw James approaching him.
His anger surged him forward, taking the steps to join the others in their shared space. The group’s conversation died as they all turned to him in bewilderment.
“I guess Daddy Warbucks didn’t buy you any manners, huh?” the goons behind her laughed. “Well don’t worry, you won’t see that faggot ever again,” he snarled at her. “You took everything from me when you ratted me out. My business, my money, all GONE! FOUR YEARS I spent in jail thinking of this moment. Lucky for you I got connections, got out early for good behavior.” Again, the hyenas laughed.
“Baby, there is plenty of me for you to focus on, can it not be the reminder that I needed heart surgery before forty?” Steve found himself cocking his head to the side, glaring a little at the love of his life.
“If it wasn’t for me you wouldn’t have met him that night!” his brother loved reminding him. But Steve didn’t care, because he was head over heels for the Omega.
Tony sat there as he watched his husband stand up to apologize to her. She surprisingly walked into his embrace, the man hugging her tight as she released a few more cries. He whispered words of reassurance as Tony and the neurologist shared a knowing look of pain for this girl.
When he didn’t hear a verbal answer, he turned to Steve who had bent over and covered his eyes with one hand.
Clint’s eyes bulged as James stalked over to him before throwing the unsuspecting blonde over his shoulder. He shrieked in laughter as the much stronger teen easily carried him off to oblige the blonde’s request.
There was a little bit of tension in the air when the couple left, but then Clint fell out of his chair and everyone laughed at the silly man. Daci felt a yawn overtake her which caused her father to yawn as well.
Two days before his thirtieth birthday and his friends were still trying to convince him to do something special about it. He had explained, numerous times, that he didn’t want to celebrate it and would rather just work through the day. They had taken it upon themselves to try and plan a party and even tried to get someone to cover Steve’s 24 hour shift that day – but he still refused.
“Heck yes I did,” Tony said, all the while changing his background to the new wallpaper his husband sent him.
“Thirty years, come on baby, you can talk to me,” Steve said as he threw in some wiggly brows for good measure. Sure enough, his love chuckled, rubbing his hands over his handsome face before walking over to the blonde.
“Hey Wade, why don’t you tell them about your welding?” Emerson offered, bless her, “he’s working on some badass projects in school.”
“Oh Tony, leave it to you to not follow tradition. That’s right, pup. I’m your father,” Ty said as he turned back to the boy, leaving Tony to reach over to squeeze Steve’s hand as he noticed the Alpha’s scent change to one of offended.
“You’d need to be inside the restaurant to see her doing that…” Tony said accusingly, smiling when his boyfriend’s cheeks blushed harder. “But I appreciate the gesture,” he added as he also placed a hand on Steve’s inner thighs, making the blonde blush even harder as his cheeks turned red.
But her heart that had basically loved this girl from second grade let that slide for now. It wouldn’t hurt to text her dads…they’d probably say no anyway. She pulls out her phone as her excitement grew, doing her best to keep her poker face in front of Cara.
“Hey, I think I know something that’ll cheer you up,” Clint said as he grabbed a reluctant James and proceeded to walk the two inside. “Come on, hot stuff. It doesn’t even involve that lovely cock of yours,” he teased, letting out a yelp when the brunette smacked his ass.
She grabbed her father’s hand as she joined the others in the elevator, wondering when she'd get to hang out with Hulk again.
She rested her head on his shoulder as he hugged her close, glad to see she was actually exhausted from everything.
“Harley...do you know that woman?” he asked the pup who was frozen with fear. Steve stole a glance back at the group, anger spiking his scent when the woman touched Tony’s shoulder.
He got a notification from Karen that Peter wanted him back home to check in, which the teen considered an opportune time to ask about this cocky ‘hero.’
“Pretty sure I’m the lucky one,” he said quietly, smiling further at seeing her cheeks turn pink from that.
Then just more blinding pain, so much he couldn't think he could take anymore. And just when he thought he would die from it...comfort. Ease. It let him relax enough to feel sleepy.
“Pizza?!” Peter asked the room, getting laughter from the three. He pulled his phone out to order some pepperoni pizzas.
“He’s right in that it’s not fair for you two to see your parents so affectionate. So while you two are cleaning,” he explained, taking the coffee cup out of his offended husband’s hands to place on the counter. “We’ll be using one of the rooms you don’t occupy.”
“Emerson,” he called after she took a few steps towards the kitchen. “Your brain is betraying you, so you must trust your heart. You have a great one, little sister, trust it to tell you the answer. I love you and I know you will figure it out. And to answer your question, your Pop mentioned something about fresh salted caramel cookies?” She couldn’t help but laugh, rolling her eyes affectionately as she turned to walk to the kitchen.
The feeling in his gut only worsened when the tall youngish stranger and his two friends made their way over to them.
As Emerson quickly regained consciousness, Peter found himself hugging her tightly. The man in red long forgotten over the guilt of almost getting himself and his sister killed…which he guesses is irrelevant – since his dads will kill him anyway. He helped her walk to the med floor where their Uncle Bruce was waiting for them.
“You did use your power. Your power of wit. Which I think your Tati would agree is fair game,” Clint said with a bright smile and a chuckle, getting one out of Daci as well. “Well I’m glad to hear you only used your words this time. And of course you have two parents, kiddo. I’ve loved you for a long time.”
Bucky wasn’t stupid, he saw the way Clint looked at him. And even if maybe in the beginning he liked the guy, now he just associated him with hurting the love of his life. Vi had been right about Barton, and how his ‘crush’ was completely inappropriate and he wanted to tear them apart.. She had been right about all of them, really.
“Ms. Barnes, Ms. Sams, if you two could keep your personal lives private, that would be greatly appreciated,” Mrs. Jacobson said with a smile as Ms. Lang finished quieting down the rest of the teens. The bell rang a moment later, and they smiled as they heard Ms. Lang groan in protest about ‘just getting them quiet’ when the crowd collectively started talking and moving to exit the cafeteria.
He woke up one stupid school morning and rushed to the bathroom to make it to the toilet in time to throw up. The genius’ mind immediately went to pregnancy, because holy shit morning sickness and when was the last time he’d had his heat and HOLY SHIT WAS HE PREGNANT?
Steve had to keep himself from laughing when the six year old actually glared at the old man in response.
“No! You are just trying to weasel your way out of this and you know Pepper will kill me if I don’t go! Jo, what time does the luau end?”
,” he whispered the last words out, knowing it was violent but that it would also bring her closure. {
He owed Pepper liked ten raises, and reminded her of that as she helped him toddler-proof the place – with about an hour to spare before May and Peter arrived. Peter already had his own room and everything, but Tony was basically a toddler himself and also wanted to catch Pepper up on his latest
…which means he can’t exactly openly kick their asses. The other students in the hallway had already formed a circle around the three.
“Can...can I hug you?” she asked quietly, still feeling nervous even though they openly invited hugs. She startled for a moment when he only looked up at the ceiling before realizing he was blinking back tears. Arms were suddenly reaching out and pulling her into a hug as she couldn’t help but giggle in happiness as she returned it.
“Peter, with me. Emerson – I’m trusting you to wrangle the Avengers enough to not overtire your Dad. Who” he added a sharp finger point back at Tony without looking at him, “is to remain in bed until Dr. Chase says otherwise, clear?”
“And that young lady is his niece, Joey,” Tony explained pointing to the girl who looked like she had zoned out, staring at the bookshelf against the wall.
“Am I…am I spoiled?” Tony looked in the rearview mirror, surprised to see his boy was looking out the window with his question.
“Fine! OKAY! Papa PLEASE!” he laughed out. Both grateful as Steve gently put him down, who then moved to tussle the teen’s hair.
“Daci, Petey, come on. We’re going to eat at the restaurant here before seeing the other animals,” Steve said as he pushed a stroller still filled with Harley towards the restaurant. Peter and Daci followed the others, frowning at seeing Vivienne and her father already seated waiting for them.
Before he could ask her any investigating questions, they heard the elevator ding. Which was only unusual in a house full of super heroes because they normally told JARVIS to give the Stark family a heads up first.
"Thanks for the warning," Steve said with a shit-eating grin as he began to turn around and walk towards the showers attached to the gym. He turned around again to laugh at his husband, seeing him standing there pouting before moving to take his shirt off. He turned around and walked backwards again, starting to pull his sweatpants down as he winked at his husband.
“It’s nothing Dad,” his son obviously lied. He stole a look at Steve who frowned back at his husband.
“Steve! Daddy! I made a hundred on my math test!” Harley cried, running over to the two and giving each one a hug.
“No, I’m serious. You think I’m actually attracted to this?” he said, pulling away and pointing dramatically at Steve – who was now glaring at the man.
.” He took this opportunity to tuck some of the hair behind her ear as she looked down, finding the next words to come out more easily for the seasoned father.
They were alone in Harry’s lab in his father’s mansion, both on either side of the glass containing the colorful spider.
“Maybe she isn’t as itchy as you thought she was,” Steve pointed out with a smile as she again fell on her bottom. His brother glared at him before trying a third time. She definitely made it further, but still plopped down on her bottom before Steve grabbed her to pull her onto his lap.
But Steve and Bucky had each other, at least. And they only saw that shithead on the weekends until their mom realized what was going on.
“Thought you said this wasn’t a date?” the brunette asked innocently. Steve’s jaw snapped shut and panic began to set in. “I’m sorry, you’re just very easy to tease. Like you said, this isn’t a date. Just two friends getting to know each other. I’d apologize but honestly I’m not that sorry, you’re even cuter when you blush.”
“No, of course not Steve,” Tony said, voice thick and tears quickly filling at the implication. “I...I know I don’t have the best reputation, getting knocked up at sixteen, but -”
“So I don’t get a say in this? You really expect me to be able to handle four kids?” her Tati asked as Steve asked the ceiling robot to bring the boys back into the living room.
He was so incredibly glad for her timing. He who shall not be named had his publicist reach out to him for a possible ‘work collaboration’ earlier today, and though his best friend helped calm him down, his girl was the one who really helped him.
He needed to rid himself of a certain…item and also didn’t want to leave Steve alone right now. After dragging Steve into the big stall, he quickly discarded the expensive toy because he knew his own limits…and this seemed to be the beginning of a long night. Steve wordlessly nodded in understanding and offered a small smile to the brunette before following him out while he washed his hands.
“Uh, no sorry. What?” he asked, doing his best to ignore his phone ping loudly with a message in his hand.
“I’m sorry Emerson, really we just…didn’t know it was this bad,” Steve began “could you lie on your stomach? Some of those are fresh wounds and could easily get infected.” Her cheeks were still red when she made eye contact with him, searching his eyes for any hint of deception or other intentions.
“I want to show you something,” she said before gently reaching into her bag to pull out a blue folder. She handed it to Emerson who opened it carefully.
“It was supposed to be a fair fight…” she started, stopping herself quickly when she realized what she had said aloud. She didn’t look at either of them as the wheels clicked in Steve’s brain.
Wade was at the stove cooking something that smelled delicious while the rest of the family was seated around the dinner table. The kids were coloring while Peter had his laptop in front of him and smiled at his little brother when he joined the others.
“Sorry, right, not what we’re focusing on. I also obviously don’t care that you’re not blood,” he said, smiling as he heard her hum happily. He kissed her head before continuing.
He’d give them a little bit of donut later, but he knew better than to give them sugar this early in the morning.
She threw her hands up in disbelief, walking around her bed to lie on her stomach – laying a little away from him in protest as she glared at the man.
“Yes please,” Bucky answered for him, reaching both hands for the new cup with glee before taking a hefty gulp. “Oh, that is still taking some getting used to,” Bucky murmured as he clutched the mug with his metal hand.
The Omega wasn't worried, though, even as the Alpha shouted empty threats as he left. Tiberius used to have power over Tony, but that was a long time ago.
Steve looked back at his niece, laughing at seeing she had figured out how to open the package of cookies and was covered in chocolate and crumbs.
“I. Am. Cher,” he managed with a straight face, quickly breaking when he heard the teenager erupt in laughter behind him. Steve smiled fondly between the two, putting his hands up in surrender.
Tony knows her sperm donor used to get drunk before engaging in his favorite activities. Tony got drunk – Emerson would bet money on it ¬– due to his PTSD and being alone in this big tower and was now trembling from guilt. She counts herself lucky it didn’t work out with those cunts from school; he clearly needed her right now.
“Oh…um,”  Steve said with fake uncomfortable-ness. His son quickly stood up in disgust as Steve laughed at his joke. Peter was shaking his head with his hands over his ears before Steve got his attention again.
“No fucking clue,” the brunette replied honestly, smiling when his husband chuckled a little at that, “guess we start by waiting for the tyke to wake up…”
“What? Those are the most well behaved children I’ve ever seen! How dare you call them that,” Clint said in offense, having experienced first hand the different kinds of shitty ‘families’.
“That’s very sweet of you Tony, but I would like an actual paying job. And would probably like to wear clothes sometimes too…”
“Really?” Tony asked quietly, brain short circuiting a little until the blonde rolled his eyes fondly at the shorter teen.
She knew her Nana, Sarah Rogers, died when she was four, having one or two snippets of memory about her. This woman was not Sarah Rogers.
“He’s perfectly healthy, however. He’ll need to stay in the hospital for about a week for observation, but then you’ll be able to take your baby brother home after,” Dr. Strange supplied with a smile. “In the meantime maybe you two can come up with a name.”
"That's awesome! If you weren't going to I was prepared to take in my biggest fan," Peter teased at their dads. "No but seriously, having Miles as a little brother would be amazing. Good for you guys."
Her terrible two’s hit three weeks before her actual birthday, making Steve wish he had some estranged cousin or uncle he could stay with for the next year – she was that bad.
“No,” he admitted with a pout, even crossing his arms for good effect. He broke with a smile as she fondly rolled her eyes at him.
She was in the bathroom, brain registering the coolness of the counter top against her legs when he set her down. Her head rested against the mirror as she blinked and watched Steve grab her hand to run under the faucet in the sink. She felt Tony pull her against his chest to keep her steady, holding her arm out for Steve to tend to the wound.
“Your friend Nat asked me to keep an eye on you,” he replied, reaching an arm out to help the shorter teen steady himself.
“He won’t think differently of you,” Pepper the Fucking Mind Reader said, a small handle resting gently on Tony’s shoulder. He still scoffed, his insecurities always getting the better of him.
“So it’s just us?” Tony asked, moving to unbutton Steve’s shirt. The blonde rolled his eyes fondly at the man, knowing there was a chance that they couldn’t just jump into the tough conversation. A pretty big chance, actually…since his husband was a damn horn-dog.
“It’s fine Tony, the market is on the way here,” Steve said as he placed the bags on the counter, pulling Tony into his arms once they were free. “Plus I got to show off my arms when carrying the bags,” he teased, flexing his arms as he said it. The air momentarily changed to the sweet smell of Omega arousal before the brunette shook himself and blushed.
“It’s too late Peter,” she said standing, throwing her hands up to cover her eyes. “I’ve already been blinded!” She then waved her hands around with her eyes closed, reaching out for him. “Peter? Are you still there?”
“That’s so sweet of you, Petey-pie! I was excited to hear I got to pick you up too,” Steve said with a smile once he got seated in the driver’s seat. “How was school today?” he asked as he began driving them home.
"Your fathers are in the living room waiting for you, as is your sister," the AI responds with slight fondness in his voice. Peter rolls his eyes at that, knowing his sister had a six sense when it came to Peter getting in trouble and made sure she was present.
It was a beautiful day to have a picnic in the park - at Steve’s suggestion. Harley was even starting to warm up to Steve, holding the Alpha’s hand as well as Tony’s as they walked to the park. Steve was carrying the basket, but his full attention was on the pup who was telling Steve about his new favorite dinosaur.
“Come on, you can shower on our floor and grab Wolf,” Tati said with smile, holding his hand out for her to take. But the idea made her heart race in a good way, so she turned down his hand and turned to her uncle currently staring at the coffee pot and holding a clingy Harley.
“Bambino, come join us in the parlor while Jarvis finishes up lunch for everyone,” his Mom said as she grabbed his arm, squeezing it slightly as she led them to the other room. Harley played with his designated toys Howard had bought him while his mother pulled him along and sat the two down on the couch.
“Sweetheart, it’s fine. I can take care of this. SHIELD agent, remember? I’ll just need to head to the office now. We can try hanging out again on another day,” Vivienne said with her hand on her father’s shoulder, breathing into his ear. It seemed like she was being helpful, but Daci couldn’t help her glare towards the woman.
he had gotten these new powers and web shooters? Or because he had trapped an innocent kid in his web, mistaking him for a thief? Probably all three, he thought as he swung quickly home – after he had helped the panicked mother, of course. He changed before arriving back at the Tower, frowning to himself on the ride up to the elevator. The frown deepened when the door opened, revealing a voice he didn’t immediately recognize.
“Yes ma’am,” he whispered. “Please, I can call the cops, or your social worker, or whomever you feel safe with just …” he trailed off, not completely sure how to finish that thought.
“Can we help you gentlemen?” Helen asked as she suddenly appeared by Tony’s side, causing the genius to send a thank you to the man upstairs for the first time in his life.
Everyone called Peter a mini Tony. And in a lot of ways he was. He looked more like Tony than Steve and definitely had a lot of his Dad’s quirks, not to mention the love of science – but there was plenty of Steve in him as well. Steve saw it when he defended his right to be Spiderman. Whenever he offered a little one shrug response. And apparently when it came to falling in love with broken men.
“Thanks for teaching me, Clint,” she said before she pulled back, reaching for the bow before they were interrupted by the ceiling robot.
“Wait, what?” Tony began to ask, clearly not awake yet. In one quick move, Tony was thrown over the super soldier’s shoulder as he squawked out a “Steven!”
“This fucking sucks, Steve,” he said eliciting a laugh from the blonde. The brunette smiled warmly at the man, “I’m furious and confused and sad and so very upset…but I’m glad we’re in this together.”
"Well, she's always been a Saint, maybe that wasn't the best example," Buck teased as he got up to stretch out again. "But that little shit factory is by far the best thing that ever happened to me," he said before walking off towards the bathroom.
“- no we can’t James,” the Omega growled, possessively wrapping his arms around Bucky who only smiled in response.
“Well,” she began as she followed him to the kitchen. “I want to practice writing my name. I thought...maybe you could teach me?” The question startled the man a little, who nearly dropped the bowls before placing them in the sink.
"So...you and Pop used to date, huh?" Bucky's brow raised at the question, sending a smile to Tony at the familiar Stark sass.
“Hey sweetheart, we’re here,” Steve said with a smile, standing in front of the genius with their luggage in his hands. “Come on, I want to change and hit the beach.” That got Tony moving, helping Steve with the luggage to his private beach house. He changed into gold booty shorts, laughing when he saw his husband put on a blue speedo before the two raced each other to the waves.
“Clint. Is that...is that how you lost your hearing, you were in the car with them?” Bucky asked incredulously, losing the battle with restraint as he flipped to lay on his side and wrap his arms around Clint, burying his face in the smaller teen’s chest and not waiting for an answer.
As his Pappy counted to ten, Steve continued tickling the pup, keeping an eye on Harley in case he really wanted him off. But the pup just laughed, making no effort to wiggle away. The Alpha had never tried to tickle him before, but noted it was something he would do often in the future. The laugh and scent coming off the sweet pup was something he’d cherish forever.
Flour covered almost every inch of the living room while the TV ran some cartoons at high volume. Steve reached for the remote to mute the TV before he and his mom shared a look as they glanced around for the source of the screaming.
“We have this cream for um…such occasions,” he explained with a smile, before bursting out in laughter when she looked even more offended at the insinuation.
Both Tony and Jo knew how Steve felt about alcohol. Not only was his brother killed by a drunk driver, but both he and Buck had witnessed firsthand what alcoholism looks like. Bucky’s dad was a drunk, and a vicious and abusive one at that. He was technically his half-brother, as Steve’s dad died not long after Steve was born, both sharing the same amazing mom. But they also both got knocked around plenty enough to stay away from it. Or at least Steve did, remembering the few times he’d seen Bucky drink.
“Hey cub!” her Tati greeted with open arms, squatting down as she quickly ran into the hug. She giggled as he swung her around before sitting her on the counter next to her Dad. “So...something happen at school today?”
"Say it again, Peter. Who is this?" Steve asked the baby, finally taking him out of (a very reluctant) Clint's arms to bring him closer to Harley. Who, even though his back was to Tony, the Omega could tell was absolutely beaming at this turn of events.
Tony took off his suit jacket as they heard the elevators ding. A few seconds later, Joey joined them in the kitchen. She looked a little angry but softened her face when she saw Tony looking at her. He raised a brow at her, reaching an arm out to give her a hug in greeting. She easily melted into his embrace, the man smiling and planting a kiss on her head.
“I am sorry to interrupt ma’am, I just wanted to talk to Rhodey about Tony,” Steve said with a bashful smile.
It had happened to Tony once before when he was eight, but he had to suffer coming back to himself on his own cause his father was in a different country on business. Only your Prime Alpha - who was either your father or your bondmate - could snap you out of the zombie-like trance it put you in.
"Yeah, they said you'd never adopt me. That you'd show me off before throwing me to the streets," Miles finished his confession with a heart breaking wail. His hands moved to cover his face as he cried in agony. Her Pop instantly brought him back into his embrace as she felt her Dad shift one arm to rub his back in comfort.
After Steve left and Rhodey dropped off Harley, he spent the day helping his pup build legos and dreaming of what it would be like to raise Harley with someone.
“No,” Steve said with ferocity, growling a little as well. He put one arm around his pup and drew him close. “No
“Tony’s Steve?” the woman asked with a warm smile, extending her hand out to the blonde. “It’s nice to meet you young man, we’ve heard a lot about you. James why didn’t you let this boy inside?” she asked with a little ire to Rhodey.
Still didn’t feel great when she continued drinking her coffee and everyone else chuckled around her.
Going against his better judgement and taking two, though he needed it. Tuesday afternoon and he was still feeling completely broken. All of Monday he had taken his hearing aids out and shut off his phone, not wanting any human contact. He considered doing it Tuesday, but eventually decided he wanted to watch TV so reluctantly put them on.
“Instead of playing in the gym...maybe we can make some cookies?” Peter suggested after a moment of silence, which instantly got his two younger siblings to cheer in agreement.
"Do you get off on people not knowing just how dirty you are?" the brunette asked as he walked over to the beautiful bastard. The sexy beast shrugged his shoulder in fake innocence, smirking at his love as the smaller man leaned up to kiss him.
.  “Guess Peter and I should go get dressed for whatever fancy place you guys plan on taking us to this evening,” turning to Peter as they made their way out of the lab.
They were about to resume their conversation when they heard multiple footsteps approaching. Howard and Steve joined them, neither looking injured or particularly upset. He looked at his Alpha who offered Tony a smile.
“I know and I’m sorry Harley. Want me to see if he is on break and can call us?” the Alpha asked, smiling when the pup nodded adorably. Steve pulled his phone out, sending Tony a quick text and smiling when the Omega immediately called back. “Hey Tony, someone’s missing you,” Steve said as he put his phone on speaker.
"Hey! We missed you too, Papa!" Miles protested with a rather adorable pout. The sucking of each others faces finally stopped, as the taller father reached back over to pull the boy onto his lap.
“You...I...just stay out of my way when it comes to Kingpin. I’ve been following his crew for weeks now and I don’t need some wannabe Avenger getting in my way.” The other man had the audacity to laugh, which only infuriated Miles further.
After thanking the woman profusely, promising a million favors and an official apology from a sober teen, he dragged the quiet – but somehow fuming – daughter of his up their elevator.
“You’d let us eat in the living room?” she asked in surprise. On her floor, she and her dad ate anywhere but whenever she was on this floor, she could only eat at the table or in the kitchen.
“This is powerful shit you were exposed to Barnes, could’ve made me cheat on Steve,” Tony said, which did nothing for Bucky’s current shitstorm of emotions raging inside his chest.
Probably free babysitting for the rest of his life. Well, he already kind of offered that all the time; whatever he would babysit without complaining.
"So you came down here to warn me about double trouble and gawk at my ass?" he asked with a smile as he took a step closer to his husband. The shorter man had a wicked smile on his face that the blonde was tempted to kiss off, but thought of a better alternative. He leaned forward, smiling as his husband did the same, except he moved to kiss his forehead. The genius glared at him as the blonde walked backwards away from the man.
“Wait, Steve! I need another kiss. I can feel darkness approaching,” Tony said with a smile and his eyes closed. He opened on eye to see Steve look up at the ceiling before moving to accommodate his husband’s request.
“You can catch me up later, she seems okay for now…” Tony said tiredly, shifting the sleeping boy on his stomach a little.
After insensitively comparing her PTSD to that on the battlefield, she angrily reminded him that voluntarily signing up at eighteen is different than not even being old enough to offer consent.
,” the Omega whined as he felt himself harden as well and slick gushing between his thighs. The gland on his shoulder pulsed as Steve began licking the spot. He had never felt more sure about anything in his life. So after they went another round, the Alpha and Omega took turns biting the bonding gland on each other’s necks.
“Joey,” Peter said astonished. “That’s not very nice. Papa always calls you a good girl when you’re not around.” Her eyes sprung open at that, looking up at Steve who eyes were equally wide – though his cheeks were also blushed pink.
“Tony! You’re coming to our place?” the very drunk Alpha asked the Omega, who blushed and looked away in answer.
“Of course you can, Peter Pan!” Clint said as he let Daci back on the floor, where she pulled her backpack around to show him her test score. “Wow, you are so smart kiddo.” The compliment made her smile grow bigger on her face, jumping into his arms again when he offered her another hug. He walked the two over to the couch before plopping them down. “Anything else happen today?” She kept her face in his neck at the question, not liking his knowing tone.
“How’re you holding up, buttercup?” Wade asked as he pulled the shorter man into his arms, not even trying to cop a feel as he snuggled him close.
Steve rejoined them a minute or two later, sitting down in his original position before putting his arm around his husband’s shoulder to bring the pair closer.
“Nicely done, Daci,” Clint added with a matching smile, coming to stand next to the redhead. Daci blushed once more, feeling a little awkward and standing up off Bruce’s lap.
“Yeah, I wouldn’t recommend giving that to the kids. Even if it might actually calm Suzie down for once,” Bucky teased with a laugh as he played tug of war with Lucky. Clint couldn’t help staring at the brunette, thinking all this time that he hated the drug and would therefore hate Clint for smoking it.
He wore jeans and a hoodie, figuring if he was going to be sober he was at least going to be comfortable about it. His dad let him borrow his jeep - he was still saving up for his first car, if you had to know - and of course it needed gas.
“I would rather you be celibate,” he called to the two men exiting to the kitchen, “LESS SCARRING,” he added before turning to Emerson. “If you’re going to stay here, you may want to invest in some sunglasses, eye drops, bleach…you know whatever helps erase the image from your head.”
Hulk eventually nodded and stomped his way over to her, clearly trying to downplay his excitement. When he settled down with his back against the gym wall, she made a decision to climb into his lap with a couple of books in her arms.
“-Yeah but none of them were about you!” Tony snapped back, worry and anger battling it out in his stomach. Because of course Tony has had second thoughts about things, but Steve was never one of them. And knowing it wasn’t reciprocated…
Bruce got into Harvard, but declined to go to Oxford - which just so happens to reside in the same town Thor currently lives in.
“Peter, I understand. But either of you could’ve yelled for help. Instead of damaging property and exposing your powers to the world or anyone that has a camera phone,” Tati said directly to her. “Luckily it doesn’t really seem like anyone saw how it happened, and Vi is awesome enough to go back into work on her day off to cover for you. Dammit Daci this is the kind of thing that gets us kicked out and back on the run again!”
“Go take a nap with your Omega, Stevie. Nanny has this,” his Ma said from the couch, eyes not moving from watching the sleepy pup. Steve looked at his Ma before turning to his mate, who was smiling back at him. Silently he walked over to his Ma and pup, kissing the older Omega on the cheek before gently rubbing Peter’s cheek.
bust? Kid, this is Hell’s Kitchen. Which is my jurisdiction. The better question is why the hell you’re pretending to be Spiderman.”
His memory is interrupted as he sees a familiar pair of shiny brown Italian shoes enter his eye line, not even realizing his head was hanging down. He looked up at his Dad before quickly standing and hugging the man. “It’s okay Bambi,” he heard him whisper. He could hear his Pops talking to Wade and the couple who witnessed everything. “We’ll get her back.”
“Not right now, baby,” he whispered as he pulled her back into his embrace. “He’s in surgery right now. Still alive though…”
He didn’t get into the art school he applied for or his backup state college. His parents had reminded him that those schools were very selective, reminded him they were still proud of him and his hard work, and that there was nothing wrong with going to community college in the fall.
“She said they’re staying with us for a few days to help with Peter! And Nanny said he’d teach me how to make his chocolate chip cookies while they’re here!”
Tony quickly pulled her into a hug, ignoring the weak threats the wounded creature was shouting at them.
After two vigorous rounds, Tony lay panting while Steve left to get a towel to clean them up. He took his time coming back to himself, feeling loose limbed and fuzzy in the best way possible. Steve came back and gently wiped the remnants off his body.
” he said pointedly to his Pop who was failing at holding back a laugh, “doesn’t kill and or seriously injure Leo, who I should remind everyone, has been with us
“No of course not, just bring your headphones,” Peter snarked at the teen. “Now I think we should head back before more people check on us. Miles, you take care of JARVIS and we’ll go tell dads you’re having girl problems and wanted my advice.”
“I will accept that offer only because I will otherwise snap your son in half,” Sam said pointedly at Steve. He shook his head at his old friend before leaning down to his kids. He kissed Emerson’s temple before turning to do the same to Peter – but was stopped when Peter ducked his head out of the way. Steve glared a little at his son before grabbing his shoulders and forcing him to be still long enough to plant a fat kiss on his cheek; ignoring the groans coming from his teen…and the overdramatic face wiping that followed.
She found the way to them, but was stopped short by a locked double door. She looked around and saw a glass window that had people with badges behind it. She moved to the glass and froze a little at the two girls sitting behind the barrier, both wearing scrubs. She hadn’t spoken to her classmates – who apparently intern at this hospital together – since they tricked her into coming to their sleep over last year. Those same assholes looked up and laughed a little when they noticed her in her ragged state. She took another deep breath and steeled herself to ask them for help.
Beautiful mountains cascaded the landscape flourished with some of the tallest trees she's ever seen. There was an enormous waterfall lining the horizon as the sun set on the African county. Her fears were squashed by her excitement, momentarily forgetting about meeting the princess again. Her Pop tapped her shoulder, offering a smile as she got up to follow him off the plane.
“Hey” was all the blonde offered, suddenly nervous. Tony looked up at that, offering his own small, “hey.” “Did you sleep okay?” he asked, continuing to avoid any real conversation.
“Oh oh! Give him here!” Clint cried out, fumbling off his raft and swimming over to them. The Omega was having hardcore baby-fever, and honestly Tony couldn’t blame him. His puppy was the cutest puppy in the world since his big brother was a baby.
She hesitated at the door, second guessing sneaking out and showing up at Clint’s doorstep when said door suddenly flew open.
“Just start with your hand,” his voice interrupted her thoughts. She returned the smile he was giving her and took a deep breath before plunging her hand next to her father’s. Oh wow...the water did feel good. Excitement quickly began to replace her fear feeling safe here in the Tower, with her father, about to take a colorful, bubble filled bath. “How about you undress while I find the rubber duckies Tony told me about?”
“His name’s Lucky,” he heard his boyfriend explain, before the brunette walked over to the dog pile Clint still refused to extract himself from.
“Barton will be alright, he’s a lot tougher than he looks.” Bucky snapped his head towards Fury, wondering when he had gotten here. The older man offered him a small smile as Bucky actually gave him one in return. “I want to apologize about Vivienne and inform you we found a few other HYDRA moles after what she did. You did good work Barnes, you and your kid are officially under SHIELD protection and I hereby immediately promote you to official Avenger status. Welcome to the team.”
"My niece Kori is going to help you, sweetheart. Don't worry, I taught her everything she knows," he said with a wink as a young woman walked in to join them, scoffing a little at her uncle's antics. She couldn't have been more than a few years older than Peter, though it was impossible to tell with her skin and bone structure. She walked over to Emerson who smiled as she showed her the picture, turning back to her father to make sure he wasn't peaking. He threw his hands up in defeat as he walked around to sit on the other side of Miles, pulling his phone out to take a picture of the two.
“Buckle up, buttercup,” Tony interrupted, smiling as they both groaned in protest. She reached back to do as requested, finally turning to Tony in greeting as he began driving.
She let out a sob, remembering what she said to Steve. He wrapped his arms around the blanket burrito, bringing her close to his chest.
His husband smiled as he looked at some of the outfits in the bags as the genius pulled the man forward to kiss his cheek while he browsed. Their daughter groaned in complaint as the two ignored her and focused on the clothes. He saw her reach forward to grab Steve's mug, smiling at her as she gave Miles her cup and finished drinking Steve's.
He doesn’t seem any less angry than before, though he had taken about half an hour to work out and subsequently shower. She frowns as she looked away from his wet hair, still wondering to herself if it was possible to argue her way out of what was about to happen.
"So Miles found you? He told you where I was?" she asked as she rubbed her wrists in pain. Shuri looked at her a moment before helping her to her feet.
“Yes, okay? Obviously I told May, she’s sitting right here! And she’s family,” the genius said in his defense. Joey rolled her eyes fondly as her little brother suddenly piped in.
“Let’s put your shoes on, hot stuff,” the blonde said before grabbing his hand and dragging them back to the bedroom.
“Oh Steve,” Tony breathed out, “This is so fucking beautiful. Thank you,” he said before looking back at his love. Steve’s face was adorably pink, which it normally was when he showed him his artwork…
,” Clint whispered to himself, not ready to have this conversation. Lucky yipped and ran around Bucky in excitement, following his other owner as he went to stand in front of the blonde.
grampa!” she laughed as they broke apart and made their way outside to the parking lot. She was surprised when she was lifted off the ground, fingers digging into her ribs.
His eyes were still shut another moment, feeling tears spill down his cheeks freely and not caring anymore.
A chorus of ‘yeahs’ rang out from the other kids, including a cheer from Tony and Thor, which made Daci smile.
He kissed her head a few times before whispering, “I’m right here Jo. I’m not leaving you.” He assumes it was the right thing to say, feeling her tears continue to stain his shirt but her shaking sobs die out.
After everything they had been through, Steve counts himself lucky neither he nor his husband - nor his daughter, for that matter - ended up in jail for assaulting Stone. Word did get out, when the teens proved themselves smarter than Stone thought - providing evidence that he had arranged it all. Add that to the fact that none of the hospital workers were willing to provide backup to Stone's story...he was screwed.
When Peter had been bitten by the spider, he was at Oscorp Industries and made it so his tracks weren’t able to be followed. So no one could link what happened back to him.
And now, her fucking locker wouldn’t open. The noise of banging the accursed metal contraption meant she didn’t hear a crowd approach her – the flat-chested anorexic looking bitch at the forefront.
She hated seeing her brother like this. He didn’t leave his room for two days, barely dragging himself to school after their Uncle Thor had “insisted.” (
tell her it was something innocent like a food fight. You know, why you guys got a new couch. We can discuss the details over the dinner you two are treating us to; while we also discuss what presents you’ll get us.” She wiggled her eyebrows before she joined Peter’s extension of a fist-bump, all the while smiling at the two silent superheroes. After another moment of victorious silence, she continued.
“Sorry, it’s just…please don’t make me stay with her again,” she pleaded to the two. “I thought Pop was an old fashioned grandma, but she literally washed my mouth out with soap!” Tony tried holding back his laugh, covering his mouth with his hands. Steve, did not, and openly laughed at that.
James returned a moment later with bags upon bags of things; toys, food, more toys, treats, a bed, pee pads and even more toys.
“I see…” she heard him say, unable to focus her attention on anything else. She heard a yelp coming from her Dad, turning around to see her Pop had swatted him for also staring at the god.
“Thanks for staying with him, Ms. Lewis,” Steve said to the woman already walking away before turning to the pup who was still sitting on the concrete. “Hey bear, you okay?” Harley didn’t answer him, just stood up and began walking to Steve’s truck.
to fuck his daughter. I’m the other one,” the brunette quipped back, getting a laugh from the teen who tried her best to hide it.
“Nothing, actually. I have been behaving, I’ll have you know, sir. Anyway last night I had a bad dream, so I went to the kitchen, you know, to grabs me a snack,” she said, smiling as he nodded in agreement.
“My favorite is the pachycephalosaurs!” Harley said carefully, clearly having memorized the long word. Steve smiled watching the pup interact with his family.
“Yeah. That works. Love you kiddo,” he said in choked breaths, making Daci realize he was upset for a good reason. She hugged him tightly in return, loving this man so much.
He even broke down to his vice principal when she called about his absences, crying on the phone as he explained he needed a mental health day.
“–don’t say go back to sleep! Come on, help me make the kiddos a snack,” Buck said as he climbed off him and pulled the blanket back in one swift move. Steve blinked several times in response, contemplating just turning over before his brother grabbed his arm and dragged him to stand up and follow him into the kitchen.
“Yup, no, that’s...that’s fair kiddo. Sorry, just forget it. If anyone asks, it’s totally my fault I’m teaching a five year old how to shoot with a bow, okay? Let’s go shoot some arrows,” he said with a smile, standing up and pointing to the bows. She looked at him for another moment, trying to get used to his humor, before nodding her head in agreement.
“Do you know who I am?! Tell me where he is or you’ll lose your pathetic receptionist job.” Tony felt his blood boil as fury burned completely through him. He heard his husband off to the side speaking to him, but he ignored everything in favor of finally confronting that piece of shit.
, especially given your track record,” Steve said without looking at her, focusing on the oven that had just beeped.
“Uh, no I’m good,” she said with what she hoped was a convincing smile. It wasn’t, as the woman put her car in park and walked over to the teen.
The kitchen was the biggest kitchen Steve had ever seen. He gathered the nerve to ask before turning to Tony.
“Wounded! I’ve been wounded!” Tony cried out before collapsing to the floor, clearing pretending to be in real pain. It got another laugh from Daci as Morgan screeched in giggles from her father’s antics. “JARVIS, time of death. Tell my husband I loved him. And make sure Morgan is ripped out of my will,” Tony rasped out as he reached a hand out towards the ceiling.
“-you’re relying your secret identity on another stupid teenager you barely know?” Peter hissed out, gripping his fist as they heard a sudden knock on the door.
Her dad had a punching bag set up when they moved out of the garage and into their one bedroom apartment. He kept in shape even as he worked as a janitor during the day and a bartender at night. AND still found time to be her dad and teach her to defend herself. It included boxing, lots of boxing. But even when her dad would spar with her and let her get a punch in – she never fully punched a person.
When the woman grabbed his hand, Daci finally made her presence known. She rounded the corner and walked directly over to the suddenly surprised two. They separated from each other as Daci took her time to eye the woman up and down.
“You’re not going to greet your old friend?” Rhodey spoke up, getting a chuckle from the genius as Ty’s face flushed at seeing him again. “Or how about Tony’s husband? Steve? I believe you two have met?” the man said while gesturing to Steve.
if you think I’d let you go.” He laughed along with his daughter, helping her extract herself from the blankets.
ridiculous,” the man countered with wiggly eyebrows. And honestly? Fuck everything else right now, because this
“We didn’t exactly plan for that, in my defense,” Steve said with his one hand raised before finishing off his drink. He loved his babies to death, but he and Tony were still adjusting to being responsible for three small kids after only thirty days of gaining custody of them.
Leo woke up every night in screaming nightmares, only comforted by Wade - and that was only about half the time. When Peter tried, nearly breaking down at the sight of the terrified and crying boy, Leo made it clear he didn’t want him by screaming ‘don’t touch me!’ at the man.
“Wow…I’m sorry,” she said as Tony waved her off – long since over the deaths. “I can’t imagine losing both at the same time though. I never met my mom, officially I guess. But if I lost dad and Steve at the same time…I can’t even imagine.”
She grumbled in response, still conscious enough to complain. He chuckled before leaning down to kiss her cheek.
“Did you know they were one of the last dinosaurs ever? T-Rex’s weren’t even alive when Stegosaurus’ were! Cause the T-Rex is from the Cretaceous Period, not the Jurassic Period! Did you know that?” Harley asked, practically skipping and making Steve jog a little to catch up.
“Turn to page one hundred,” Tony said. “Gently,” he added with an outstretched hand, just as Steve was ready to rip the book open. He carefully opened the textbook, thumbing the pages until he got to one hundred.
Later was now as he handed her a brand new picture frame with the photo of her and Bucky. She gingerly took it from him, Tony unable to see her expression as her head hung in response, long hair covering her face. He could see her fingers gently trace over the picture before a tear drop splashed on the glass. She turned to him suddenly, tears in her eyes and a smile on her face.
“Join us, friend!” Thor bellowed, definitely tipsy by now. Tony stole a look at Steve, almost asking him permission to join their group, which had the blonde smiling and offering the shorter man his seat before leaving to grab another chair.
“No, Peter I need your help here. Daci...just, tell JARVIS if you need me, okay? And please be careful.”
“Oh, it’s my father’s lab. But I use it when he’s out of town,” Tony said as he held one of the doors open for Steve to walk through.
“This isn’t my home,” Tony answered quietly, one hand still gripping on the door like his life depended on it.
“Because I’m trying to give her a normal life. And yeah she’s five but she deserves her autonomy and her own bed in her own room. I can’t...I can’t keep relying on her. She deserves so much more than what I can give her…”
The super soldier let out a laugh when Harley face planted into the mat for his rendition of a somersault, glad to see his toddler just giggle and pull himself up again. Peter showed off his cartwheel, which got Daci trying to do one. Steve watched with a fond smile before deciding he wanted to do a handstand himself, craning his neck when he heard his daughter giggle in his direction.
“Damn right you will. Rogers’ always apologize and own up to their actions. They’re good people,” he said pointing his finger at his teen. Her eyes rolled as she smiled at him.
"Yeah I was...kind of thinking of chopping it all off?" she asked hesitantly. He smiled again at his girl who had long curly brown hair, unchanged since they first met.
Tony’s gland ached and reminded the genius why he’d rushed over to Steve in the first place. You know, besides the whole baby thing.
“So you knew there was going to be a fight, and ended up getting jumped?” he asked, hitting the nail on the head as she buried herself further into her chair.
He had about forty-five seconds to wallow until there was a knock on his door, growling at his bigass nosy family for caring.
He stood smugly, watching James’ face scrunch up in confusion before he glared back at Clint and slowly brought his hand up to sign ‘
Including Clint and Peter, who both lost focus, causing the five year old to fall on his face. Steve quickly rushed over to him as the boy began to sniffle. He picked him up and inspected his face, glad to see only a small red mark on his forehead.
He was not this bad as a teenager…but then again…Bucky was. He’d gotten into a fight at a party on behalf of his big brother starting one before. Over a girl, no less. So maybe he should count himself lucky whatever she was injured from, it couldn’t have been as bad as his big brother smashing a guy’s head with a beer bottle. Which was actually a 40…
“Pop and I can move your bed into the living room if you want,” Steve said as he unhelpfully started moving furniture around.
“Thor take Tony to the quinjet then you and Tasha find Strucker. We’ll get Daci," Steve said just as Daci’s attention turned toward the Captain before she charged at Steve.
Bucky watched in satisfaction the look of panic on Strucker’s face before he flew a few feet in the air, eyes bleeding quickly as the life was choked out of him. It was a quicker death than the man deserved, but he was more concerned about getting his kid back home than anything.
"Well for teachers, they're pretty stupid," Peter piped up, getting a laugh from everyone but the super soldier.
“Hey, I got something for you,” the brunette said as he used one hand to reach behind the couch on the back table.
“Hey!” Tony giggled out, playfully squeezing their hands together. “I seem to recall someone requesting to see me in yoga pants…” Steve yanked his hand away, though he was still smiling. “I’m kidding!” Tony said with that gorgeous laugh of his as he grabbed Steve’s hand once more. “How did it go with your bestie?”
She had observed the small family over the last week, how Peter’s parents weren’t shy about hugging their teenage son or showing each other physical signs of love. But they recognized that she wouldn’t be okay with that right now. And that was okay. It was okay because they weren’t doing this for themselves, maybe just maybe, Emerson hoped to herself, they don’t want anything from me. Maybe they genuinely care and want me to feel safe? The negative voice in head, always prepared to shoot down what little self-esteem she could conjure, was inexplicably quiet as she cried out everything she had, everything she was. She grew very tired very quickly, thankful for the hands currently anchoring her as her cries tapered from exhaustion. She felt her eyes growing heavy and this bed particularly comfortable.
“If you did your job and read my case file, you would note that both men and women have royally fucked me over.”
“Well, for one Tony dumped him and two because we’re eating dinner and that’s rude?” the teen said incredulously, hands up in confusion.
. You've saved this world millions of times and you don't think you can handle a black kid?" he asked with a smile. Tony laughed aloud at that before his friend continued.
“You will later,” the shorter man said with a wink. Steve found himself smiling and rolling his eyes at the man, but his gut was still unsteady.
. It took her another moment to recognize the figure was Spiderman, the masked vigilante who her parents had been talking about recently. He dropped from the ceiling walking to the touch-screen on the wall.
Leaning over to kiss his mate, Steve then followed the sound to see his mother-in-law rocking his crying son.
“Why would you be friends with someone who doesn’t love stuffed animals?” Cara said teasingly as the man in question walked up to them.
This ridiculous man, who was currently whining to their daughter about not wanting to participate at her eighteenth birthday.
“Well, he’s obviously got some kind of brain if he said yes to our Bambi, Steve,” earning an eye roll-smile-combo from said teenager and a not-too-entirely-convinced shrug from Steve. “Just maybe casually slip in that my newest Iron Man suit has deflective armor for stealth mode should he – “
“I’m sorry, I didn’t think I’d be out that long. I ran into May and she invited me over for some…tea,” she tried, hoping his mind reading didn’t work over the phone.
With everything going on…she just wanted a drink. She figured she could get away with a few hours after school, as long as she was back in time for dinner. May was chill, she’d understand if she was a little late. She just needed something to take the edge off of all of this and help her calm the fuck down.
“It’s okay Tony,” Steve answered as he shifted his son more comfortably on his lap, “some not nice girl at school insulted you, me
Steve followed his line of sight, rolling his eyes when he realized Emerson was about fifteen feet away and sitting with three lambs.
“Well…you’ll have time to think about it in your room while I go to the gym. Shower so you can sober up. I’ll go work out so I don’t…murder you,” he said quietly. Joey flinched at that, but quickly got up and walked to her room.
She crumbled the paper in her hands and tossed it in the trash - the ringing in her ears too loud to notice she had missed the shot. The crumbled paper lay next to the bin.
“I don’t know actually, guess he just knew you well enough. He did say he knew for a long time, though. And he gave me the whole ‘importance of coming out’ shpeal when I told him I liked girls in second grade,” she explained.
“No, Steve. I have it too. I noticed a weird mark on the back of her neck earlier. I just. I honestly don’t know what we should or can do in a situation like that?” Peter had made his way back to the kitchen at this point, adding to the conversation.
Currently, the family was walking along a dirt path to his old friend's home, taking pictures of the scenery and gawking at the wild life. Nothing carnivorous was nearby, they were assured, but beautiful herds of cattle roamed peacefully near them.
“What was your bad dream about, Petey-pie?” the brunette asked as he started swaying the two back and forth.
“But Daddy! We wanna build a fort,” he heard his niece complain, eyes still closed as he tucked himself further into the couch.
“No it is, you just shouldn’t believe all of them,” he offered matter-of-factly. He let her playfully shove him for the sarcasm.
“-no, no! You can call me that you just surprised me is all.” She felt her shoulders relax as he kept smiling at her. “Do you want to finish reading to me? Looks like you have one book left.” Too stunned and happy to do anything else, she grabbed the last book and turned to sit in his lap once more.
As he was holding her, still smiling minutes later after hearing her call him ‘dad’, he remembered something he wanted to show her.
"You brought me tulips, Bambi?" his Dad asked with a smile as Peter quickly handed him the bouquet. His Pop stayed a little weary, eyeing the flowers in his husband's hands.
"Em if you're not comfortable with Bruce doing it I'm sure we can schedule something with your doctor..." Steve offered as she shook her head no.
"Do you want to take a shower or just change your pj's?" he asked as he rubbed his son's back in comfort.
“That means both of us, especially if we’re down Hawkeye,” Steve said to Tony who nodded back at him before both men turned to the two men on the couch.
“Come on, love. Let’s go get massages,” Steve said, wrapping his hand around the Omega’s waist and placing a kiss against his temple. But Tony wasn’t satisfied with that after seeing his baby walk away, so he turned to his Alpha and pulled him into a heated kiss.
Tony huffed and pouted as Emerson laughed and nodded at that. Steve moved to exit but Tony spoke up again.
“You’re bonded?” Steve asked in disgust, feeling anger overtake him at the thought that he slept with a bonded Omega.
Steve had just dipped Tony, looking lovingly into his eyes while Tony’s face was detailed even with just the moonlight.
When he heard Steve’s footsteps fading is when he could also suddenly hear footsteps in front of him.
“Shhh, I’m sorry, baby girl, I promise it’ll feel better soon,” Steve whispered as he gently spread the ointment across the scars. She blushed, both from the endearment and from the cold gel-like substance gently slathered on her back. It was cold but acted immediately, she could feel her back numbing as the Captain’s insanely large hands soothingly rubbed her aching spine. She found herself in a tranquil peace, both from the comfort of the (men!) around her and from the pains from earlier that had begun to fade. She hadn’t even noticed the two men were still focused on the welts.
“-who’s at the door?” a young voice asked, grabbing the door to open more to see. Standing next to the teen was a small girl smiling at Steve.
Peter experienced a short moment of shock before he wrapped his arms tightly around the boy, resting his cheek on his mop of black hair. He gently shushed him, rocking the two and using one hand to rub the boy’s back. They stayed like that for a few minutes, Leo slowly calming down and breathing more evenly. When his crying eventually stopped, Peter expected some kind of scramble of embarrassment to occur or for his foster son to lash out in anger.
As selfish as he was, he had become increasingly selfless since marrying captain handsome and adopting his questionably not biological son – not to mention the six months he has been blessed and cursed with the most recent member of his family – he smiled as he thought to the person in question who abandoned him tonight.
"No, I promised I wouldn't be mad," he said through clenched teeth as he closed his eyes to take a few breaths. When he opened his eyes again, the anger was finally able to dissipate at the sight of the fear in his daughter. She had leaned away from him, unsure how he'd react to her confession.
“Holy shit,” she said to no one, hand slightly shaking from shock. She shook her head and put the drink down, using both hands to peel the envelope open. It was a single page that she flattened out, not even recognizing the handwriting since she’d never even seen Kimberly write anything. Emerson thought offhandedly that it was pretty before she began reading.
He had decided to momentarily drop the investigation in favor at gawking at his husband while they changed for dinner. Plus he trusted Steve...and Barnes was miraculously with Natasha now. Not to mention Steve seemed perfectly fine now, even shooting his husband a smirk as they finished getting dressed.
“Uncle Rhodey what’d you bring us?” Peter asked excitedly, jumping up and down in front of his favorite uncle. Harley was already rifling through the bags, pulling out a stuffed narwhal.
Steve laughed warmly at that, adding, “me too, shell head.” He gave his husband a quick peck on the cheek before moving to exit the vehicle. He smiled to see his husband follow, hands joining in the elevator. He squeezed the hand of his love one more time before they broke apart – walking along the medical wing to where their kids were.
“Aw, I haven’t seen you this flustered since Katie,” Wade cooed in a condescending tone, making his way to join the others at the table. “He was about your age, Leo, and had this crush on his classmate, Katie, who kicked his ass at everything.”
“I’m sure the god of thunder can handle two teens,” the blonde and brunette chuckled for a moment longer before they sat in comfortable silence.
“Do you think it’s that time of the year?” Nat blatantly asked, getting a snort from Sam and Steve while the cuddle birds were still wrapped in their own world. It was fairly obvious the Omega would start his heat soon, since Clint was dramatic but not like this. Only Natasha had the balls to say it out loud.
“You’ve never shown Harley the Wizard of Oz?” Steve asked the Omega, shooing him away when he tried to snag a piece of bread that Steve brought.
requires some assistance,” the boy said in a scary good impersonation of her father. Miles and her Pop froze in shock before bursting into laughter; while her Dad had the biggest grin on his face.
“I...um...maybe I’d be up for round three if you ate more chocolate. There’s a little on your finger, maybe you should lick that off…” And Tony watched in amazement as his husband put the finger in his mouth before pulling away at the last second.
And on cue, Emerson and a sleepy looking Peter walked in to join them. Emerson maneuvered the older brother to sit by her younger one, stepping back and choosing to remain standing by the pair.
Despite Steve’s offer (as well as Aunt Peggy’s, Sarah’s, Rhodey’s and Pepper’s offers), he decided he was going to see Obie alone. He was ready...he could do this.
“You remember that patient we had during our second week together? That gross old man that called me a “dirty n*****” and spit on me?” Steve frowned but nodded at the memory. “You defended me and put that ignorant shithead in a legal restraint that broke his thumb…you remember that?”
“Harley, talk to me. Why does this upset you bambino?” Tony said patiently, reaching out for his pup only for the boy to swat it away. “Hey, we do not hit Harlan James,” the Omega snapped at the boy, frowning when his son’s response was to burst into tears. He tried reaching for his son again when the boy turned around and high tailed it to his room.
When the doors dinged open, Clint grabbed his hand again and yanked the two down the hall, Bucky chuckling behind him. He let Clint shove him inside once he opened their door, settling down on the bed while the blonde kicked the door shut.
He looked up at the older man, partially wanting to tell him to fuck off and partially thinking he had a point. It helped that the man was being so lenient about his actions.
So, it seemed like they were on the same page. He hung out with Harry after school and in his lab. Miles had made copies of Peter’s notes, omitting any indicators that would reveal Pete’s identity.
So he got some cash from his bag and spent his nights at a hotel under an alias. He didn’t want to tell any of his friends what was going on and bother them with his baggage.
A text from Tony, asking if he was ready for the brunette to give him a ride. The genius needed to talk to Mr. Pym, his science teacher, after school which was why Steve was moping on a bench by the parking lot.
She sits in the cell with the other teens, head resting in her hands as she does her best to calm her racing thoughts.
“I suppose,” he groaned dramatically, wrapping an arm around her shoulder and pulled her into a hug. He kissed the top of her head for good measure, laughing as she over-dramatically voiced her embarrassment.
“I bought something…special for the occasion…” his love said as he nodded to their bedroom down the hall. Steve rolled his eyes fondly, leaving the clothes for now as the two walked out of the laundry room and down the hall.
He was still quiet as they arrived out of the elevator and walked silently together to the living room.
RDJ has individual tattoos for his wife and three kids - thought it was cute so I had Tony do it too <3
“Mhmm,” was all she offered as she continued hugging her dad. She heard papers rustle as he looked at the documents – too lost in happiness to care. “I love you, Daddy,” she whimpered into his shoulder.
With how teenage-angsty Joey has been, Steve prepared himself for the dramatic “you’re not my real parents” shtick he’d seen in so many movies and TV shows. He was surprised when she just threw sass back at Tony.
Steve closed his eyes tightly as his fists copied the action. He stopped when he felt his fingernails begin to draw blood, hands opening up as he tried to get a hold of his self. He quickly sat back in his chair when he felt his body begin to literally shake with rage.
that bullshit casting? She’s not even gay! And Batwoman is Jewish, for crying out loud where is the representation?” he asked dramatically.
“Tony,” the blonde whimpered just as his cell phone rang. “Get it, Bucky please.” Still curled in on himself, he watched as his brother took his phone from his pocket and answered the call.
“Every inch of you is beautiful,” he said in his best no-nonsense tone, glaring a little more when Tony simply rolled his eyes in response. “Fine,” Steve said, accepting the challenge. He quickly finagled his husband’s pants off, along with his underwear before Steve quickly shed his own clothing, triumphantly kicking off his undergarments before turning back to his man.
“Who is she?” she asked, eyes trained on the woman who was smiling down at the girl. The smile was real, but she could see a subtle shift in the woman’s blue eyes that kept her weary.
“He’s handsome like his Daddy,” Steve commented, finger swiping through the pictures and smiling at every one of them. “I’d ask why you didn’t tell me but then I’d be a hypocrite,” he said with a smile as he handed Tony his phone back. “Do you get to see him often?”
“Fury found out about me and Vi and fired her. Did you know?” he asked, anger beginning to brew again at the thought that maybe somehow
“Alright monkeys, off Uncle Tony,” the genius grumbled when Pietro had joined the two, holding onto the baby as the toddlers screamed and ran off, while the other hand delicately held the coffee.
“Why did you call me bear?” Harley asked, quiet and almost shyly. Steve thought about it for a moment, unaware the name had slipped out before answering the boy honestly.
“You know, for a genius you’re pretty dense sometimes,” the blonde quipped back, smiling when his husband scoffed out in offense.
"Really Tony?" the blonde asked as he walked forward to hug his old friend. Bucky pulled back and clapped him on the shoulder twice, just as happy to see him. Steve then turned to his husband with outstretched hands, knowing his son liked to be taller and therefore preferred Steve's hip. Tony only smiled fondly at the exchange, turning to find where there daughter had been hiding.
After thanking his host and updating them, he went somewhere he never thought he’d ever go voluntarily in his entire life.
"How stupid is he to pass up on the opportunity to raise such a wonderful pup? The best thing he ever did for you was sign his rights away. You won't have to worry about him anymore." Steve kissed the top of his pup's head, sitting in silence for a moment before a thought popped into his head.
Otherwise alone in the senior’s science lab, he was standing in front on his crush, Wade Wilson, who simply looked puzzled – and unbelievably adorable, be still…my beating heart – looking at the awkward junior not saying anything. Probably planning his escape route. Or the best way to kick my ass. He really, really hoped it was the former.
“This makes so much sense,” Stark said before he grabbed a nearby tablet and started typing furiously, leaving the room without another word.
Making Buck so incredibly happy he pushed the teen back to straddle him, deepening the kiss almost in challenge. He was getting between Clint and his food, which was always a dangerous venture. But before Clint could retaliate, Lucky had woken up and decided to join the game. When his tiny tongue slipped into their kiss, the brunette jerked back with a laugh, wiping his face as he watched Lucky continue his assault on the blonde.
Tried – as in before she could do so a certain super soldier lifted her off of the stool and proceeded to throw her over his shoulder.
Her Pop doesn’t say anything on the ride home. She kind of feels guilty, sure that Peter never put them through anything like this. No back-stabbing prostitute relatives from his past to show up out of the fucking blue. She momentarily remembers they were going to eat, then realized he must have left the food on the side walk by accident, dropping it when she grabbed his hand to exit.
“Thanks for the tip,” Tony groaned out, choosing to lie on the floor as Wanda walked over and gently climbed on his chest.
“I’m leaving now to go get him,” Pop said as she walked by the pair, grabbing her keys. “Stevie I know I raised a pair of stubborn mule-headed Alphas, but even your brother knows when to ask for help. No shame asking the grandparents to help, you know we’re happy to.”
“Harley, pup look who’s here.” Steve was caught a little off guard from that, fully expecting the pup to cling tighter to his grandfather. Instead, the Alpha watched with misty eyes as the pup’s eyes lit up when he saw him. He wasn’t harmed, which did ease a little from the ache in his chest.
After winning a gold medal in archery - yeah, apparently he had told the truth about the Olympics - the blonde went on to become a gymnastics teacher and foster parent with his husband.
“Do you think,” he began again, “do you guys think he’ll come looking for her?” He didn’t look up when he asked, eliciting the super soldier to wrap his arm around his teen in assurance.
“It’s cute! Your dad obviously loves you…Joey, right? I’m Helen, Helen Cho,” the brown eyed beauty said while extending her hand out in greeting. Joey returned the gesture, praying her palms weren’t as sweaty as she was imagining.
"I like this game," Bucky said smugly, immediately letting out a yelp when his boyfriend reached up and pinched both of his nipples. It caught the bigger teen off guard as Clint shoved him back and straddled him in one swift move. The bastard pinned him down as Lucky came fumbling over, traitorously attacking Buck. "Okay! I give," he chuckled out, wiggling one hand free to gently shove the pup away.
“I’m trying to say…I’ve been really selfish lately…” she began, again checking to gauge his response. When he only furrowed his brows, she continued.
“Yeah, of course I can help with that! That’ll be a sweet surprise for your Tati,” Steve said with a big grin as he rummaged through a drawer before bringing out a stack of paper and a box of crayons. He directed her back to the living room where they sat next to each other on the couch as the blonde pulled the coffee table closer to them.
“You don’t care about me! Just let me go so I can run away...it’s what you want!” Leo declared before he collapsed in on himself, crying his tiny eyes out. Peter finally released his wrist and sat on the ground next to him, hesitating a moment before wrapping one arm around the shaking boy’s shoulder.
“Hey, I gotta let you go, the most beautiful girl in the world just walked into my office,” he said with a wink to her as she sat across from him.
“Grow up, I was going to suggest - the possibility - of getting back in the dating pool. So you can have a partner to sleep with,” Steve said, his seriousness undercut by his mocking tone.
“Well, thanks Clint. Do you want to come in? There are three little monsters but there’s also cake in the kitchen.”
“Do you want to put cigarettes out on me? Kick me in the ribs? Whip me with a cane? Slap me across the face?”
’? Cause that I can handle. What I can’t handle is a goddamn purple glitter bomb going off in my office.”
She was frozen. Literally frozen in place as she watched them die, powerless to do anything about it. This is all your fault Steve’s limp and bloody body managed to say. We never should have taken you in came Tony’s remark, body contorted next to his husband. Above them stood the monster, the one who took everything from her. The monster’s fiery demon-like eyes found hers, snarling as he sprinted towards her –
“DADDY!” the boy cried in anguish as the two adults leapt off the couch; Tony following just behind Steve as they made their way to Peter’s room.
“Do you want some help getting to bed?” he asked softly after releasing her. She stumbled a little, cursing under her breath as she stabilized herself.
“You know, now that you mention it Peter, I’m suddenly painfully aware of this overwhelming feeling of…loss of innocence,” she said while clutching her hands to her heart dramatically.
"Well, then I am the house. He is arrested to me," Thor explained. Miles and Emerson both laughed at that, the fathers smiling at their kids.
Not many people in his circle got up as early as he did. He used to get up at four, but having three kids added a layer of exhaustion that required an additional hour of sleep. Then again, he was still the only super soldier on the team. Though that may change with Bucky back in his life.
The six month old was now standing in his crib, babbling to himself before noticing his Daddy and squealing in excitement.
“They’re...dead to me,” she said carefully as Bucky’s face scrunched up in confusion. “My mother and step-father are alive and live in Canada. I haven’t talked to them since I was eighteen and swore any child of mine would never meet them.” She clearly was beginning her story, Bucky curious where she was going with this but remaining quiet nonetheless.
“Tell Jarvis if you need us,” Steve said with a smile before carrying his chuckling husband in the direction of their bedroom.
,” he finished with a growl. “You’re so lucky Hill took pity on your sorry ass and you better pray no one got a picture of your little adventure.”
"One's in his lab and the other went to pick up the food." He looked back to his love, smiling as he saw him settle a giggling Miles on his shoulders. He then heard footsteps behind him, not bothering to turn around as he felt his Dad kiss the top of his head.
She ran past Sam when they got back to the floor to find her Dad’s room. Rhodey and Bruce were standing outside of it, smiling at her as she opened the door to enter. Peter was curled up on Tony’s  right side, arms snaked around him in an octopus hold as his face rested on his chest. Her Pop was sitting with his back to her on her Dad’s other side, laughing at something someone had just said. She quickly moved up to that side of the bed to see her Dad’s face.
After too many medical tests to count, the doctor told her and her dad she had epilepsy. A disorder with no known cure that made her helpless in her own body; something that she would literally be stuck with for her
“Sounds good Pop, I wanna see if I can make Sam cry,” Peter joked. They laughed at Sam’s expense, who only offered a glare in response.
“Come on Pop, I came out to both of you like a year ago, you know that’s not what this is about.” He took a deep breath, “I just, she’s my friend and I have this weird gut feeling she’s in trouble.” Tony and Steve exchanged glances before saying anything.
“You know I didn’t make it the whole three months, right?” he asked her as she looked confused back up at him. She was six at the time, so however long it took to see her uncle again was basically a lifetime…hearing he didn’t make it the three months was new.
So currently, he was driving home where the two of them would meet him. He glances at the clock in his car; it was nine thirty at night. Maria – bless that woman – agreed not to actually file any charges since she ‘drove about two blocks.’ She decided to cut Josephine some slack.
Didn’t he already shut you down at lunch the other day?” Tony’s eyes widened in amazement, unaware of that little fact as he sputtered a laugh.
“Hey now,” she heard Tony say as he scooted over to sit closer to her, gently placing his hand on her shoulder. When she accidentally leaned into it, she felt him shift further to wrap his arm around her shoulder – pulling the teen into a side hug as she stayed in a ball.
Tony laughed, heart filled with warmth at both her impressive memory as well as her wit. He selfishly hoped she’d say yes.
That’s when he spotted the hole almost big enough to fit through. He managed to push past the pain, getting to a sitting position as he tried to make the hole big enough for his body to squeeze through.
“Alright…Aunt May…” Jo said with a smile and looked down at her lap. She felt her Pop teasingly pinch her shoulder, but chose to ignore him in favor of focusing on joining her brother and coloring like the kid she still was.
She peaked once more out the curtain as the Dean started listing the graduates names to accept their diploma, spotting them a few people before her name would be called.
Tony scoffed, wondering who on Earth still used land lines. Steve, obviously. He was about to run the idea by Peter – as he knew his friend was just being polite at this point; Rhodey may have mentioned when he first got there that he couldn’t stay long but could never say no to Pete…which Tony of course took full advantage of to exact some revenge.
“It’s um,” Tony explained as he continued staring at the ceiling. “It’s how I got pregnant. Or at least that’s what Bruce hypothesized…”
He found himself humming in approval, smiling more as he heard Steve chuckle behind him – absolutely loving that sound. The blonde started kissing his neck, laughing more when Tony stretched out to give him more access.
“Fuck,” she said in pain, wiggling in her seat as she tried her best to regain control of her muscles and ignore the pain from her wrists. She looked out the window as they pulled up, frowning at seeing other students she recognized arrested for drinking at school.
Jo suddenly felt her cheeks blush furiously, wondering what embarrassing things he would have possibly told her. Or showed her…
“Stahp!” Clint laughed out when the brunette added his devilish hands to his ass, pinching in all the ways that made the blonde shriek. Lucky took that opportunity to continue his own assault, making Clint feel more loved and happy than he had in a while - even covered in slobber and unable to breathe.
Peter’s fingers clenched into tight fists, anger spreading through him. Emerson quickly stood her ground.
He felt his smile splitting his face when Steve snaked his free arm around his waist and pulled him close. Tony felt a rush of warmth flare in his chest and did nothing to hide his smug smile. He was actually starting to love the glares the bitch was sending his way.
“Nope, I wanna see you do it,” the brunette said with a mischievous smile. He quickly pecked the taller man on the lips before grabbing his hand and pulling them into the hallway. Steve allowed himself to be dragged along, not particularly loving this plan.
Spiderman, then we're cool," Tony said with a smile, which dropped a little at the weird stare the kid was giving him. Miles looked back up to his sister in awe.
"Jesus you two, if you're wanting grandchildren you're going to have to wait until Petey here knocks some girl up. I told you I don't want kids."
–” Hunter began before interrupted by Emerson’s fist colliding with his balls – completely knocking the air out of him.
“Happy birthday, baby,” Tony said to Steve, running his hands through his wet hair as the blonde turned around to face him. Using his strong arms, Steve hoisted himself up out of the water to kiss a giggling Tony.
“Tony!” Morgan interrupted them with a shout, causing Tony to freeze around her. A laugh escaped her chest, pulling away from the man and laughing harder at the betrayed expression on his face.
Fate was not on her side this afternoon when a familiar car pulled up in front of her. She felt her cheeks blush as May rolled down the window to her car and smiled at her.
And then shit hit the fan and now she’s going to have to endure Steve’s barbaric disciplinary methods, which he got from her Dad and Nana. She angrily thinks to herself if she ever had kids – which was looking less and less likely the older she got – she’d never hit them.
“Um, yeah,” the shorter blonde said before opening the door all the way, revealing Steve and Bucky sitting on the couch. “James! Put your shoes on, we're taking Lucky for a walk,” Clint added loudly with an obnoxious wink in Tony’s direction.
“Captain Rogers, actually. And it’s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Stark,” Steve said with a smile, not backing down from the posturing.
,” she gritted that last word out making Steve’s eyebrows shoot up as she confessed, “he threatened to rape me.” Tony looked back at Steve both looking panicked as they turned back to the girl still staring at the tombstone.
“Thank you my love,” Steve beamed after the kiss before lowering himself back down into the pool. “This has been the best birthday ever.”
“You’re right, Pop,” Peter said without looking at Wade. “Mr. Wilson here has better things to be doing, anyway.” He turned back and started walking to his room.
“So you see?” Tony continued with a choked smile, gently breaking up the hug to give her room to breathe and look at them. “You’re not going anywhere. You are stuck with two dads and a brother for the rest of your life,” he said tucking some hair behind her ear.
“Woah, Clint, she needs to breathe,” Daci said with a smile as the blonde stopped his attack. Clint reached on the ground for one of her toys, handing Morgan the thing so she could be distracted from slapping his face.
“You’re literally the worst,” Peter laughed, head resting in his hands. Okay, now this was really confusing. “I don’t recall Peter ever – “
“Yeah come on, Stevie. Let me tag you in,” Bucky said with a smile as he crawled over to where Steve was standing, tapping the blonde’s shoulder and slipping out of the ring. Steve was prepared to excuse himself, still not fully on Harley’s good side when the pup surprised him by speaking up.
“I will, don’t worry Tony,” Steve reassured his mate, kissing the top of his head and giving him a quick hug before gently pushing him in the direction of the wailing baby.
He'd also surprised Steve with a new watch, art supplies, canvases for his studio and some fun adult gifts they didn't open in front of their boys.
The genius only rolled his eyes at his AI’s response, not worried about anything other than perfecting this idea of nano-technology. So far he’s been able to make a pulsar glove out of a wristwatch, which he considered a successful start.
She felt his hand gently take hers, interlocking fingers before rubbing his thumb across her hand in comfort. She turned to smile at him, thanking him silently for the gesture, before resting her head against his shoulder. The second she felt him kiss the top of her head, the door opened and her name was being called back.
“What would Pepper say if you wore it to a meeting?” Steve asked curiously, pausing another moment to readjust the genius. He chuckled at that, wondering himself.
The only reason he was even drinking was because of stupid Steve – who is he kidding, even in his own head he regrets that. He had been on a mission for seventeen days. SEVENTEEN DAYS! Which has meant seventeen nights of little sleep worrying about his husband’s wellbeing. Let’s not forget to add the fact that his son was on day five of seven spending his time at a stupid science camp!
There was Harley, cooing softly in the arms of his father - who Tony wasn’t even aware was back yet. Howard was cradling the baby and standing near the mantle donned by family pictures.
Steve smiled and couldn’t help chuckle a little at the memory, remembering Sam had bought him coffee after that.
“Let’s finish eating first, bud,” Tony said as he helped Harley eat. They settled into silence that only lasted a few minutes before Peter suggested it again, making Daci wonder if this family was capable of actual silence. Since Morgan was technically babbling the whole time.
“Uh, yeah, that’d be awesome,” she said with a blush, looking like she genuinely loved that idea. He can’t remember the last time the two of them had done something fun together, noting that in his head for later as he pushed away that guilty thought.
“¿Porque no los dos?” It got the desired effect, the teen laughing in his embrace. He kissed the top of her head again before suddenly remembering…
Standing in the corner, looking pissed as hell, was Steve. Who, to his credit, did try to look less murderous when she entered.
"What?" he asked defensively to his best friend, moving his arms to cross them. A smile quickly spread across the vigilante's face.
Steve’s mind is brought back to the present when they heard an exasperated toddler join them once again.
“I...who the hell are you anyway?” the arachnid demanded, trying to keep his voice from squeaking in anger. The vigilante turned to him for a moment and just stared at the teen.
“Well,” Dr. Chase began, pausing to look at the kids playing a board game with their uncles, “I wouldn’t advise too much outside stimuli…if you would like to see him alone I think it should be fine. We’ll bring your kids in when Mr. Stark is feeling well enough. I’d be happy to escort you back to his room.”
He smiled against his lips when his husband moaned at that, loving how sensitive his perky little knobs were.
Clint’s husband trailed in last, newest addition to their household held delicately in his arms. One of which momentarily distracted Tony long enough to stop walking.
“Yeah, maybe you’re right,” Emerson said quietly, “but it felt right to a tortured six year old. Knowing death was better than a lifetime ripped away from her family and forced into sex slavery in a different country was –”
“Pees Seeb?” she asked, tiny hands grasping for the not-toy. Bucky let out a laugh, walking over to her to help her start by standing up, determined to have her walk again.
“Peter, ignore nosey-rosey over there. You don’t have to talk to us about it if you don’t want to,” the blonde said pointedly as he brought out plates for everyone. The arachnid shook his head fondly, long since aware of his darker-haired father’s antics.
“Rhodey deserves a plague of locusts on his house for this. I’m serious,” he continued when Steve started laughing, “I should send a mariachi band to follow him for a month, I’m seriously considering murdering my best friend.”
“My love,” Vivienne said with a shaky breath, playing as if she was somehow innocent in all of this. Bucky didn’t fall for it, instead reaching his flesh hand out to grip her neck before slamming her against the wall behind her.
“And for the record, I also wanted you there so you and your little brother could’ve used each other for comfort while both being spoiled by May. Did that thought not cross your mind?” he asked angrily. She shook her head in response, unable to think of anything to say to that.
“If it is your father’s wish, then another two years you must wait, my nephew.” Thor said before turning to Emerson. “I must be off now, it was a pleasure to meet you, my newest niece. I do hope upon my return I hear stories of you and young Peter here besting these so called superheroes, as I have many times before.”
“Here you are,” the blonde said, eyes only on Tony as he handed him one of the cups. The brunette realized later that he had taken it gratefully without even flinching...which was a first for him.
“Yes,” he answered automatically before James could take it back. The beautiful man below him smiled brightly, blinking away his own tears before standing up and fiercely kissing the blonde. “Are you...are you serious?” Clint asked when they pulled apart for air, pinching himself even as James slipped the ring on his finger.
“You guys, you’ve haven't been down here five minutes, how are you already dirty?” he whined as he looked around for some clean towels.
“What happened to her when she was 12?” she asked, familiar with this tale of her mother. The woman smiled at her before rolling her eyes fondly.
The blonde's response was just a bigger smile, which Bucky would spend the rest of his life keeping on that archer's handsome face.
“Yeah, but we’ve taught JoJo well, apparently she gave him a bit of an ass-whooping,” said the medic with “Barton” written on his uniform.
“I’m so sorry, baby,” the genius began, “I’m so sorry you’ve been carrying this guilt for so long. It wasn’t your fault. You were put in an impossible situation, baby girl. You had such a big heart that thought it was sparing her and in truth it was. None of this makes us love you any less…in fact I kind of feel like I love you more –”
“Is this the fuckface??” she demanded as she walked past Tony to stand directly in front of the unsuspecting man. “You sick son of a bitch. How
But his Mama raised him better than that, so Steve came to a stop as the beautiful Omega stood up to greet him.
“See, I was thinking before we go, you fuck me, then plug me up so I get to walk around all night with your cum inside me. Then, at some point tonight, we sneak off somewhere and you can just take me again. I’ll be all loose and ready for you,” he said as Steve gulped audibly thinking of the possibility.
“I wanted to be an artist,” he admitted before he lost the nerve. “I always loved drawing and painting as a kid…” his gaze drifted thinking back to that time. “Bucky used to call me “Picasney,” mix between Picasso and Disney.” He smiled at the memory, not realizing he had stopped talking until Tony brought him back.
“Now, Emerson, I realize that being new to this family, means you’re still learning the rules. But, as I said before, the only way out is to admit defeat by saying the two magic words. Observe,” he then dug his fingers along Peter’s ribs and under his arms to get the shriek of laughter he was looking for. Steve didn’t relent up on his torture until he heard Peter finally conceding.
“Hi bi…I’m…gay,” he said, finding himself smiling at the words finally spoken aloud…and then quickly joining in on her laughter. The door to the closet suddenly opened revealing Clint, who looked confused at the two laughing in a closet.
“Healed enough that I can’t get anymore sympathy favors, but not enough to actually return to active duty. Unless one of you wanted to be a true hero and piggy-back me…” Clint trailed off, frowning when Bruce simply walked away to the kitchen mid-sentence and Steve barked out another laugh. “Why must you laugh at my pain, Rogers?”
” They then heard the sounds of roars echoing throughout the tower as her Tati came rushing back into the living room with a crying Morgan in his arms.
“Fine.  I’ll see a therapist. But if I don’t like them then I’ll end up talking to you two. And if that happens, I will require a written and official ‘no takesies-backsies’ per my adoption paperwork. I’m not responsible for what you guys –”
“You’d be surprised how many powerful men in the world are actually pedophiles,” Tati answered for her before turning to address the girl. “Nu ai gresit cu nimic. De ce esti suparat?” {
"Come in!" Tony called, expecting it to be Pepper and frowning when he saw Ty walk in with his stupid smile. "Oh great it's you. Hey can you close the door on your way out."
He was interrupted from continuing his teasing when his husband threw a towel at his head, getting a laugh from the teens.
After the elevator doors open, he walks into the living room to find his dads cuddled up together on the couch, while a bored on her phone Emerson is on the other side curled up.
“Alright,” Steve said with a smile, gently untangling himself to turn the shorter man around to face him. “What did you want to tell me?”
When she was three, Steve remembers him and his mom going over to his brother’s apartment to bring them some dinner. Bucky had just moved out from their apartment to give him and his daughter their own space, but Steve would be lying if he said he didn’t miss them.
“Hulk! Buddy aren’t you tired yet?” Clint called out, laying across Natasha as she carded her fingers through his hair.
Bucky brushed off some debris, shaking his head in hopes of his vision clearing out. He heard Steve groan next to him but his attention quickly snapped to the image in front of him.
"I am calm. And I will now calmly ask you to leave my office. You are a horrible excuse for a father and I forbid you from speaking to my son. I will give him your contact information when he turns eighteen, should he choose to allow you to into his life. But as of now, I revoke the zero rights you have to see or speak to him. And if you push this any further, I'll have to enforce legal action. Now, get out of my office."
Too soon voices filled the mansion as Miles stayed by his friend’s side, feeling guilty enough to confess what had happened. He stood up, walking to the entrance with his hands raised in surrender.
The momentum knocked him back and flat on his ass, feeling blood come out as his nose was once again assaulted - by the cologne this time. He tried desperately to swing his arms to get rid of the smell, but the suit prevented him from moving.
Two chapters whaaaaaat? I honestly just hate Stone and want yall to meet Pappy. This fic is like 99% done so maybe I'll upload 2 more tomorrow >:D also thank you so much for the lovely comments - they always inspire me to write more! Xoxo
“Shout it from the roof tops, why don’tcha?” he harshly whispered back. There wasn’t even anyone within eye site. He waited to answer, enjoying her impatience.
He was second guessing his wardrobe for that evening for the eighth time when he heard his husband shout for him. Instincts taking over from the worried voice, he dropped the two suits he was comparing and ran into the living room. Steve had his phone in his hand as he paced around, eyes darting back and forth.
“Don’t worry,” the blonde said between attacking his face with kisses, “I’ll make it up to you,” he said as he squeezed Tony’s ass again.
“Maybe one day you’ll tell me,” his boyfriend said quietly as Clint felt himself cringe in response.
“Sorry, your place is more overwhelming than I thought it’d be,” she explained as she made her way to sit on the other side of Tony and Peter.
“Kimberly seems genuine. You are not obligated and she makes a point to let you know she isn’t pressuring you. That at least shows recognition of her actions. She could have attempted to guilt trip you with your half-sister...but you want to know what I think, Emerson? I think she’s happy and wants to know you’re happy. It is simple, my little sister, if you want to go, go. And if the thought makes you uncomfortable, don’t. This isn’t an all or nothing situation. If you don’t go to the wedding, you have her contact information, you can reach out to her should you change your mind about meeting your sister.”
Again looking mock-offended, Tony replied “you know what? Takesies-backsies. Neither of you are Starks. Betrayed by my own kind. If you need me, which apparently no one does, I’ll be in the screen room.” With that, he dramatically whirled around before stomping out of the room.
“Yes! Thank you Steve,” she said sincerely before giving the man a hug. He returned it before placing her on the counter to watch.
– Hairs on the back of his neck pricked up as he quickly dodged a small yellow object fly over his head – the
“Everything. I was about to walk into the kitchen when I heard him panicking. But then you came in and it felt like intruding…then it kinda felt like spying, hearing you guys…yell at each other.” Another day, he’d have a conversation with her about eavesdropping, but for now he just kept making the hot chocolate before placing a hot mug to the side of her.
“Yes, what do you think I meant by ‘long haul’?” the blonde asked with a shrug, unsure if Tony was actually offended or not. “I’ve told you countless times but apparently I need to up my game,” he said with a sigh as he pushed his husband back onto the bed, crawling on top of him. “You’re it for me, Stark,” he said in his Captain voice, claiming the man’s lips when he let out a laugh.
It earned a glare from the cheerleader, but before she could open her mouth Steve was back with two drinks in his hands.
Her thoughts wandered until her Dad pulled up in to his parking spot back at the Tower. She started to unbuckle and get out when she felt a hand on her shoulder.
“– using humor as a defense mechanism to hide from an awkward conversation. I swear those two completely obliterate the whole nature vs. nurture debate, they are absolutely my spawn, I mean…” Tony realized he was rambling and turned back to look at those beautiful big blues.
Instead of just an afternoon, he decided the three should spend the whole day together. His Pop packed them a picnic that they ate at a nearby park. Then they went shopping and got Harley some new books and toys, where the adorable pup also picked out some stuffed animals for his little brother.
“Alright bambino, sit up so we can talk about this,” Tony said as he pat his son on his little leg. The pup mumbled something but his voice was muffled by the blankets. “I didn’t hear you baby, come out and talk to me.” The Omega sat there, only waiting another moment before his son pulled the covers back enough to reveal his face. “There’s my handsome boy. Now tell me what all that was about.”
*there's a joke about Steve lying about being gay and secretly liking vaginas. That is in no way meant to disrespect transmen, and I apologize if it comes across that way. I just think vagina is a funnier word than ladies.
She looked back up at him, wondering how he would react to that and also wondering if she should’ve said those exact words.
“Pop, feel sorry for me, I’m basically a widow!” The blonde gave her his infamous unimpressed look before settling his hands on his hips. Her Dad kissed her head with a chuckle before he extracted himself from their hug in order to pour himself a cup of coffee.
.” They were interrupted by Joey making her presence known as she walked directly to smell the sauce. Steve stood in front of the pot and raised his brows at her.
wrong. Am I right?” The glare and shrug was the only response he got from the pup. “Well, I have no intention to hurt either of you. But like I said before, tell on me if I do. I like you and your Daddy too much to mess this up.”
“Thank you,” she said as she gently placed the picture aside to throw herself in his arms. He accepted gratefully, feeling his own eyes get misty when she emphasized, “
“People could take advantage of me,” she said remembering, feeling more tears cascade down her cheek.
“That’s not true. I like you. So does Peter, Harley and Morgan. And the Avengers. They’re your team and we’re your family. Now come on let’s go to the gym floor,” she said as she reached her hand out for him to hold expectantly, giving him another smile when he gently grabbed her hand and went with her to the gym floor.
“Well…Ty will be there…” his husband said quietly and Steve found his body going rigid at the thought.
Clint was a close second behind her father for who she liked the most. He always wanted to hang out with her, always made her laugh and never judged her. It’s too bad her father didn’t like guys, she could see Clint being a second parent to her.
He'd meant it with his whole heart about not trading them. Steve had known he was gay from a young age and never dreamed he'd be able to marry (since it was also illegal) as a frail sickly child, while he also resounded himself to never being able to have children. Yes it had kind of happened all at one, but he had waited long enough.
They stopped in front of the T-Rex skeleton as Steve continued listening to his pup. He’d been to this museum multiple times, mostly as a pup. But now, with Harley, it was like he was seeing it for the first time. And through his eyes.
She didn’t have to say anything, just gave him a look that was both sympathetic but also threatening. Kind of a -
She closed her eyes and loudly proclaimed ‘fuck!’ since she wouldn’t be able to again for the next few days.
“Shut the fuck up Brock,” Nat said exasperatedly. “Your fragile ego is literally suffocating the entire room.” She got up and grabbed her stuff to head out.
“Aren’t you two having enough sex for everyone else? Not every Alpha thinks with their knot,” he said in his defense, rolling his eyes at the two before getting up and heading to his room to change. He had no intention of meeting anyone, but didn’t think that should keep him from looking nice. If nothing else, Natasha might pay him a compliment and that always lifted his spirits. Plus Thor was probably going, which meant they could have a rematch in darts.
Steve turned back around before replying, “yeah? Well back then I got to be your fun uncle. Since your dad…since then I’ve had to be the responsible guardian.”
Tony smiled at him for a moment before leaning up to kiss him. Steve wrapped an arm around his slender waist to bring the man closer, deepening the kiss. Tony pulled away for a moment, looking around as if to expect their kids to walk in on them.
“Hey!” he heard Helen shout as Howard pushed Tony down the few steps to the ground. He grumbled on his back, trying to push himself to a sitting position as his father descended the steps towards him.
“Regardless, it’s not happening tonight, Tony,” the blonde suddenly said in reassurance. He was too tired after their long flight, and his pride was getting in the way…again. “But I also don’t think she should get off the hook for putting her life at risk…”
“Hey,” Bucky said with a smile, waiting until Clint looked at him to continue. “Thank you for telling me. You don't have to take any meds if you don't want to, doll. I promise I still love you lots.” When Clint rolled his eyes and laughed, Bucky took that opportunity to scoot forward to bring his love in for a passionate kiss.
“Yeah smartass. A dad and a stepmom, but everyone in the house and a three block radius suffers from bedtime at the Barnes’ house,” Bucky said with a smile as he also took a bite. There was one piece left on the plate and they were sharing it.
About an hour later the group heard footsteps, the three turning to see Joey walk in with Simba in her arms.
He pulled his tablet out, sure he wasn't going to sleep after just drinking that sweet nectar of the gods. Miles remained silent through Tony moving them to settle more comfortably, and remained silent even as the genius heard movement in the kitchen. He recognized his husband's footsteps instantly, reaching his cheek out to accept the kiss the super soldier had leaned down to give him.
He smiled before responding, “it’s good to be back, Jarvis. Where might my husband be?” What he expected was a snarky response from the AI with a possible lecture about his husband’s poor sleep schedule. But what he got, was refreshingly unexpected.
not soulmates,” Clint responded with a pout, even though he simply wrapped his arms around the larger man in his lap.
"Why are you trying to kill me? I am already clearly dying," the man coughed out before chugging half a bottle of water. Peter decided to ignore Meryl Streep in favor of treating his younger siblings, noting that the two were about as sick as their Dad though they were
Jerk had left Peter his key, along with printed out receipts of the bills being paid for the next five years. He didn’t actually know if he wanted his key back, so he had left it in Wade’s hiding spot, telling himself Wade clearly wanted it this way.
The woman turned to sit cross legged next to her on the couch, impressing the teen by chugging the rest of her drink before continuing.
“I wouldn’t call finding my soulmate ‘stuck,’ Tony. Nor would I call all of my dreams for a family coming true as that either. I think I’d call that
He had one eyebrow missing, burn scars along the side of his face and his neck. Still hair on his head and incredibly good looking, the bastard. Peter swallowed as he stopped in front of Wade, taking a moment to enjoy the flowers. He looked up at Wade, waiting for him.
“Joey, can you put that down for a second?” he asked, still standing near the door. She looked up at him skeptically, placing the paper down as she turned her attention to him.
“I thought you’d never ask!” immediately laughing after, giving Steve an excellent reason to shove his shoulder in reprimand and jest. Sam got off the couch first, offering Steve a hand as the blonde gratefully accepted.
“What’d she say about Buck, Jo?” he asked in a much gentler tone. She waited a beat before finally responding.
"My other present is you not finishing that sentence! And yes, early presents are a thing," she said after pulling her hand away quickly...knowing her immature father well enough to avoid the childish lick. She pulled away and started walking out of the kitchen.
Steve turned around, but didn’t see anything. Tony didn’t even look like he’d heard it, so Steve ignored the sound and looked back at what Tony was working on. But then the chirp sound happened again followed by a small ‘whirring’ noise.
His smile dropped as he looked deep in thought, not answering until he pulled into park in their garage.
“Yeah, just…I don’t know. His voice sounded familiar and he…he called you “crazy pants” when he was bringing you to Uncle Clint last night…”
“Tony why are we at your parent’s mansion?” Tony still didn’t answer, just driving the two until he parked in front of the front door.
“I skimmed it, just to make sure I wouldn’t say anything that might trigger or anger you… didn’t work did it?” she said with a smile. Emerson laughed at that, feeling a little more comfortable with her.
“¿Porque no los dos?” she suggested, smiling when May laughed in return. “Can we actually start with the girl? Maybe give me some suggestions on how to stop loving someone when they’re too scared to even stand up for you when you’re getting jumped by some basic bitches?”
“This is my friend, Clint. He brought me back my wallet and I was hoping to give him some cake…” Bucky trailed off as he finished cleaning her before putting her on the ground.
"What? No, it's my birthday, which makes me queen, which means it's cake time now!" she said with a smile, turning to her parents with an open-mouthed smile.
“Thank you for,” the blonde said suddenly shy, “being so amazing.” Tony felt his heart melt and his goddamn knees even weaken a little.
“My father beat me for letting her die, for making him lose all that money. And it’s the reason my mother planned for a year and a half to fake her own death to get away and…” she choked out a sob.
…” Peter growled out in anger, fists clenching and unclenching as he felt his spider senses go crazy.
Especially after an end to their perfect night, when Tony walked Steve up to his door to say goodnight.
The teen walked slowly back to the Tower, stopping for a few minutes outside the entranceway to stare at the stars. She was grateful she could still see them, even if not as vast and wondrous as she’d seen it in her previous life. Her thoughts drift to one of the last times she and her mother had spent time together – having had grown up in the south and was used to open night skies. It was a few nights before her fake overdose, they were sitting outside at night gazing up at the stars. Her mother, along with a few of her friends, were passing around a joint and gave it to her to try. She remembers the coughing and laughs from the adults, before her mother pulled her onto her lap. She reached over and had given her some water to drink. They leaned back together to gaze at the sky and Emerson remembers feeling like that’s what love was. It hurt you, but then it gave you stars.
“No no, I’m wearing it tonight, you just get to pick. I will say,” he added as he opened the box and put it on the bed next to Steve, “the purple one might be my favorite.”
Tony had always been straight forward with her, earning her trust very early on. Maybe he really meant that.
“I don’t mind, what does the drink do?” she asked as she watched her father drink from the tiny glass again. She smiled to herself as she watched his face change, scrunching up and licking his lips several times. “It looks like it tastes funny. Can I try some?”
“Then why was he at the hospital checking on you?” Steve asked, feeling his son’s anger dissipate in realization. He knew all too well the fear in loving another person wholly. And while he thought his son was too young to necessarily marry the vigilante – he saw how happy Wade made Peter. And how miserable he was without him; even with their new alter egos that now terrified the father.
“Hmm, well did he ever tell you he broke up with me once?” he asked. Peter sat up straighter at that, looking at Steve in disbelief. Steve smiled and nodded in confirmation before continuing.
The blonde went out to get his husband’s favorite junk food. He figured Tony would take his time getting home, and if there was something Steve has learned long ago with taking care of a small child – patience is a fucking virtue. It won him many an argument with a certain girl, whose name he won’t mention.
“Don’t mention it…she definitely has her moments,” he teased as they both suddenly cringed – she was practicing her high notes. And was not very good.
Pietro and Wanda had been a short but sweet visit, only dropping by before heading off for a side mission in Europe. Steve noted how she was a little wearier of them, but to be fair they weren’t exactly the most social people either.
“You’ve been drugged, Terminator. Lucky for you, I have a sorcerer friend who had an interesting proposal to counter the effects.”
“Yeah, definitely. Well, first, fuck those basic bitches. And just for…the record…how did your dads react when they found out about you getting jumped?”
When they made it to the bedroom, they were both left only in their underwear…and Steve’s nerves began to set in again.
“-Alright, shut up. Just stop talking,” Buck interrupted him, waving his hands and stepping over to the offended blonde. “Steve are you really apologizing for not paying attention to me...when you mother was in a coma?”
“I have never once believed that from you,” she said unimpressed, walking over to take Peter in her arms. “You’re going to be good for your Daddy, right Peter? Remember your manners, okay baby? I love you so much Petey,” she said, kissing him all over his face. He giggled in response and tried to say ‘I love you too’ between the onslaught.
"I don't know, what do you tell me?" the vigilante asked with a small smile, leaning forward to kiss the teen. Peter returned the kiss, heart burning at the amount of love he felt for this man. He pulled away, staring into beautiful chocolate eyes before confessing.
“Look Pete,” Steve began, “like I said before, there really isn’t anything we can do right now. But your father and I can talk more about it if it’ll make you feel better, okay?” He walked over to his son, placing a kiss on his temple, surprised by the quick hug his sixteen year old caught him in. “You’re doing a lot just by being her friend Peter,” his Dad added, “like your Pop said, we’ll talk more about it and keep an eye on her, okay?” Peter nodded, letting his Pops go and giving them both a small smile.
“I think I see someone I went to high school with,” Natasha said as Steve suddenly felt the need to pee. Excusing himself, he weaved his way through the crowd to the bathrooms. A couple was making out in front of the door, which annoyed him but not enough to say anything, just squeeze by the pair and ignore the envious feeling in his stomach.
“That’s going to be so much fun baby! I was thinking you, me and Steve could go to the dinosaur museum tomorrow, just the three of us. How does that sound?”
"Alright Miles, I think it's time to relinquish the litter," the brunette said as he offered a hand to the youngest. Miles pouted a little before carefully putting each kitten down. He made sure to do it slowly, sticking his bottom lip out as he looked at their Dad in hope. The genius raised a brow at him, getting a laugh from the others. The five year old rolled his eyes as he grabbed his dad's hand and joined the family making their way out.
“Don’t tell me how to parent you condescending prick! You think you’re a bigger man because you have a few stars on your hat? I’ve got friends in high places, fucker,” Howard spat out, going so far as to poke the taller man in his chest. Tony had his tongue caught in his mouth, wanting to ask Joe to go easy on the ass kicking...but also not wanting that.
“Enjoy the rest of your evening,” Sam said as Steve quickly followed him back to the elevator, blushing the entire way as he heard the man shout after them.
He hadn’t had another anger outburst - on the twins anyway. If the boy was extremely angry or upset, he lashed out at the pair. Mostly words, sometimes tiny fists. When Peter talked to his Pops about it on the phone, he said Leo was ‘testing him.’
“But he’s your pup,” Harley pointed out quietly and with an adorably confused expression, as if blood mattered when it came to family.
Steve honestly didn’t have a response for that, always using excuses to not put himself out there. Except now he really didn’t have one…and was currently sitting across from an incredibly attractive man who looked like he could see past Steve’s blue eyes and into his soul.
“Daddy!” Harley cried as he ran into the kitchen, the two adults separating and continuing unpacking the groceries.
“I…” the blonde started before turning to his husband, “I trust Nat…and Ruth. We can deal with our frustrating daughter when we get back home. For right now, I’d like to go…outside. Do something more vigorous than walking along the beach…” he said as he began pacing around the living room area. Tony watched him for a moment, noticing his husband’s sudden build up of adrenaline and calculating whether the risk was worth it.
“Wow...can not believe Steve finally found a mate. And with a beautiful Omega, no less,” his sister, also an Omega, said as she threw a wink Tony’s way. Steve stamped on his inner Alpha from growling at his sister, who had recently come out as only being attracted to other Omegas. “And what a cute pup! Hey Harley, wanna come play some XBox?” she asked the boy who looked like he was trying to resist the offer. Ever since they arrived, he’s been glued to Tony’s hip.
Peter’s mind slammed back to the present when he was jostled on the couch, a solid body colliding with his to sit next to him.
“I know you’re struggling with your identity, with knowing who you are. Your past and present collide and it fucks with your PTSD.” He sat back to look at her, wiping some of the tears from her cheeks with his thumb. “Everyone your age struggles with knowing who they are, but you have the added lifetime of trauma you’ve experienced in your first fifteen short years. I know… I know what it’s like struggling with accepting your past. Wanting to put it behind you with every fiber of your being. What it’s like to be hurt by those meant to love you most,” tucking some hair behind her ear.
“Tony, you are proving my point with your dramatics! Your father is getting treatment for his problems. And you are obviously too young to run SI and lord knows your godmother couldn’t handle such a responsibility. I am merely here to offer my assistance.”
“-your heartbeat is different. Not to mention your clear lack of training,” Daredevil said as he made his way out of the warehouse. Miles followed him, switching back and forth in his head between cursing this guy out and just leaving the situation entirely.
“She thinks you don’t want her, Steve!” he confessed, evident by the gasp and silent “Tony” that came from the passenger seat.
Since her Pop still had her phone, she used the school phone in the front office to let him know. He sounded frustrated but sympathetic, telling her he’d let May know.
"Hey," the blond one said, before the brunette lovingly replied, "hey stranger." Emerson looked away at their undying cuteness, grimacing when she could hear them kiss very loudly - despite her and Pete groaning even louder in protest. They ignored the oldest until the youngest spoke up.
at the forefront of his mind. “Someone ratted me and Vi out to Fury and she got fired. And I think I know exactly who fucking did it,” he answered before continuing on his journey. He normally tried not to cuss in front of her, but again, he was preoccupied.
“Yeah Daci, way to kick his grumpy butt,” Clint said as he offered her a high five, which she gratefully matched.
“I’m sorry Harley, I know you were looking forward to hanging out with your father. But on the bright side you get to come to work with me!” Steve said, trying and failing to make a joke. “I mean, I work part time at my Grandpa’s boxing gym. We’ll head there until your Daddy gets off work.” The rest of the short ride was silent before Steve parked his truck.
What…did you think that would make me sympathize with you? Oh, sorry, that and you’re dying from cancer and scrambling for some holy forgiveness
But here she was, smiling like a jackass as the most beautiful woman in the world actually liked her back. As they were driving, Shuri's bracelet alerted her they were being followed. She only laughed though, driving a little faster as they quickly made their way to the surface. She suddenly turned the car around, Emerson relieved to see her fathers had been the ones who had followed her. The two men stood in their defensive stance, which quickly crumbled as she made her way out of the car. Her Dad quickly stepped out of his suit as her Pop put his shield on his back, the two meeting her halfway as she ran to them.
“Oh I, I would love that. And...I...I love you too...Papa.” Hearing the name Tony had been telling Peter these last few weeks...coming out of his other pup’s mouth...got tears out of the Alpha. “Was that okay?” Harley asked shyly, probably noticing the change in Steve’s smell.
“Tiberius Stone?” Steve finally said, hand drawing back when Tony practically scrambled off of him in panic.
His love was suppressing a laugh watching him, not saying anything but clearly enjoying himself. He quickly climbed back over the brunette, determined to prove him wrong.
"Captain Rogers has arrived and is currently on the elevator riding up," the AI informed the group as her and her brothers immediately got up and raced each other to the door. She smiled at the familiar ding, joining her brothers in shouting their greetings to the unsuspecting super soldier. He laughed in surprise as they also tackled the man in a hug as his giant arms were able to wrap around all three of them.
“Her and her friends jumped you, didn’t they? Lord knows you could have handled that little cunt on your own…” Tony said, trailing off as he looked deep in thought; Steve threw a glare his way for the unpleasant word.
“Let us look into Vivienne, you go see Clint and Daci,” Steve added, as if reading his thoughts. That’s when he noticed Romanov standing up and leaving the room. He turned back to Steve, wondering what he did to deserve a friend like him - one who was still kind even after he’d been a completely idiotic asshole. But then that equally dumb blonde smiled back at him, the same smile he’d seen a hundred times after Buck had saved his ass and scolded him for fighting in the first place.
“How do you know I was being klutzy? Maybe I was saving a kitten from a tree?” Clint asked in offense as Daci and Steve both let out a laugh.
"Oh no! I wasn't supposed to tell you!" Miles confessed again with his hands ending up covering his mouth. Their Dad slowly leaned back into the couch, possibly trying to become one with the it, as the teens again laughed at their fathers expense. Their other father simply closed his eyes in frustration as Miles realized how upset his Pop must be if his Dad is essentially hiding into the cushion at this point.
"In fact," the usually-less-gross father added, "I think he and I need to have a quick word about that kind of behavior," clearly enjoying the loud groans coming from his two eldest.
They were alone in a secluded mansion, fifteen miles from the nearest town. Norman Osborn, Harry’s father, was always at his company. His mother died years ago and Harry had told him that ‘the help’ only came on the weekends.
She turned around and sure enough – Staci and her bitches were walking up to her. Cara was hanging in the back, looking like she didn’t want to be a part of this.
“It was a trick,” she began, quietly and without her recent confident vibrato. Both Tony and Steve leaned in towards her as she continued. “They only invited me over to find out stupid Avengers gossip. They didn’t actually want to be my friend.” She hung her head as she told them, focusing on a pattern on the table that she traced with her hands.
"You need to get dressed first, maybe take a shower cause you look nasty," she said as she confiscated his bowl of popcorn.
“Right, you’re the gentleman that tried to ambush Tony with his ex at lunch, while also plotting to take the very company you ripped in half,” Steve said smoothly before taking a drink of his water. It had Tony rethink the whole 'restrain himself from blowing Steve in public' thing.
It didn’t get a laugh from the pup, but he did look up wide eyed at the Alpha. Steve was tired of making excuses for that man. He was glad he was out of their lives for good.
Steve rolled his eye at his old friend, too exhausted to reprimand him for his not-endearment. Plus Emerson looked happy with her drink as she took his seat to enjoy it. Steve remained standing; opting to stretch his legs as he graciously accepted a donut from Rhodey.
“It’s an autopsy report,” Kimberly said. “I found it a few months ago. It’s how I finally had the balls to track you down. You didn’t kill her Emerson, you spared her.” Emerson’s eyes tried to read the medical jargon on the page, but her anxiety was in overdrive and she couldn’t focus. She looked wildly back up at the woman.
He pushed her math homework aggressively across the table, his anger dissipating when the papers fell onto the floor from the momentum. She threw her head back and laughed as he offered apologies before picking her papers up – stacking them neatly before gently placing them back on the table.
“And if you need heart surgery, we’ll get through that together too, okay?” he asked with a smile as he again leaned toward the genius. They were interrupted from performing any PDA by a loud audible gasp.
“Mr. Stark tell us when you need to scent again and I’ll bring him back,” she said with a reassuring smile. Tony smiled as he watched her go, feeling sad but content.
“Of course, JARVIS will let you know when the party starts back up again,” Steve replied before the two men leaned towards each other and kissed. Daci watched them for a moment, sitting quietly while Steve returned, left with Peter and returned again. “So, Daci what do you want to do now?”
“LeeAnn! That is QUITE ENOUGH!” Mr. Campbell snapped, obviously having had enough of this as well. Steve glared in disbelief of this so called “Christian” woman whose sons were attempting to shift their chairs as far away from their mother as possible. He took a moment to take a deep breath before turning back to the Principal who should be
There was a weird smell she couldn’t identify when she opened the door, calling to the two to see where they were. They called back to her from their balcony, welcoming her to join them and watch the sunset.
The genius still had heavy bedhead, dressed in his signature tank top and sweatpants and was glaring at the blonde as he approached him.
“Right. Well. I just...after everything…” He wasn't sure why...but he desperately needed Clint to forgive him. He couldn't ask him for that right now, but the thought of losing Clint as a friend hurt him in a way he didn't expect.
“Bye,” she said, not trying to be subtle as she stared at her ass. She only stopped when Xavier slapped her shoulder. She turned back to glare at the fucker, rubbing her arm as she shoved him forward to the store.
"Come on Jamie, I think Poppy made some cookies for us," Pete said as he hefted the toddler on his shoulders and carried him into the kitchen.
“Jesus Xavy, the only ‘Cane’ I’m concerned about, is Cassandra. Why are you yelling at me at seven in the morning?”
” Tony muttered just as Isaac momentarily stopped his attack to look offended at his blonde grandfather.
“Alright,” Steve confirmed, “then…it’s a date.” Tony’s smile grew as he nodded a goodbye and walked back to his car. He caught Steve staring, laughing a little before getting in.
He looked at the pictures again, wondering if Steve had some kind of stress aneurysm – cause she looked awfully drunk to Tony.
"Of course, Miles! Do you know how you want it cut?" Steve had asked as he returned the hug the boy had given him.
“Oh nonsense, Howard ordered Thai and it should be here any minute. And you aren’t to blame for anything dear, so don’t apologize,” Maria said as she sat back down on the couch. Just as Tony and Peter joined them, the doorbell rang. “And that would be lunch. Want me to take him so you can eat?”
,” he said, directly to his now calming brother. Everyone froze again at that, before the scents and air around them turned more relaxed.
“I think I’d rather be a Rogers. Not a fan of the whole “conditional love” thing; hasn’t worked for me in the past.” Steve immediately snorted and used the blankets to cover his face that was smiling and blushing from her words. She raised an eyebrow as a challenge to Tony, who could only smile back at her.
“I’m dead, Steve. I hope you know how much I loved you. Despite all of your many, many flaws-hey!” Tony squeaked out as Steve squatted down to tickle the man, who shrieked with laughter as he struggled to sit up. Which made Daci and Morgan quickly join in. “Okay! I give STOP IT!”
"Happy birthday Emerson!!" he shouted as he continued jumping on her bed, careful to avoid jumping on the lump. She threw her covers back, grabbed her brother and pulled the giggling kid under the blankets with her. She tickled him as he tried to escape, their laughter barely muffled by the blankets. She finally relented when he asked nicely, the two catching their breaths under the covers.
bullying is tolerated at my school. And I should point out, Mr. Rogers and his husband adopted Emerson several months ago. So you will do well to respect their family. And I’m also aware that one or both of your “Christian” boys shoved Miss Emerson here back, both of whom are at least twice her size.”
“He has a name, Buck,” Steve growled out, walking past his brother to grab a beer from the fridge. Bastard must’ve smelled it on him.
