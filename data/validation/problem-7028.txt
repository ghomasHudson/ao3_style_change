“Ten million says you’re right.” Tony sighed, “Sorry I have a few crazy exes that won’t let things go. They’ll continue being an issue when they want to be.”
Steve gently set Tony back down on the ground before he cupped his sweet omega’s face and kissed him. It felt so good, to kiss once more and not be afraid to lose each other to a war. Tony couldn’t help but keep crying, leaning heavily on Steve, as he was still rather weak from waking up.
Steve sighed. He felt it was unfair if he got to survive and live a young life if his omega had to grow old without him. He'd feel guilty if that was the case.
A meeting was called the next day to discuss plans with the Howling Commandos, Howard, and Colonel Phillips. New information was coming in left and right, and it wasn’t good information. From what Tony had heard so far, the whole world was in danger, and he was willing to help fight to keep it safe from the leader of Hydra himself. As he listened in on the meeting, Tony stood right behind the chair Steve was sitting in.
“If one smacks my ass, I’ll smack their face with my fist, simple as that.” Tony shrugged, then groaned as his father called his name again. “Don’t start that new job without me, soldier.” He smirked as he took a bite of his sandwich, then turned to leave with his father.
"Well, let's not try for all three at once, because I know that would be extremely uncomfortable," Steve said.
“Nope, not that time.” Tony said, “I took the battery out of the annoying thing. It’d go off when I was soldering next to an open window! Something I had to do a lot back then.”
One day, Tony told himself. They’d get married after the war and physically mark each other, Steve giving Tony the bite scar and Tony giving Steve a smaller version of the bite scar.
Steve didn’t let Tony adjust much, he just pushed his cock all the way inside and then started up a pace only a few seconds after. With as much slick as there was, Steve’s cock had no trouble being able to slide in and out easily without any resistance.
The alpha chuckled, taking off his helmet. “So, you want to move in with someone. Let me guess, Peggy.”
“I’ll say I want to speak with more high-up representatives of this Hydra group to make sure it’s not just sounding too good to be true. We omegas can’t be too careful, after all. Many like to take advantage of us.”
She gave him a look. “Tony, I know you. You’re always bursting to launch yourself into sharing that overwhelming passion you have for robotics and engineering. You’ll have a fresh set of ears to talk off once things get settled and the commission contract is drawn up. You most definitely will go into more detail than Mr. Rogers needs to create the mural, so it’s best to have him sign before you are set loose on him. Now, how about you start looking over his portfolio while I discuss business.”
Steve pressed his face into Tony’s neck and inhaled the sweet scent that belonged to his omega. “Oh, Tony, I’m so sorry I left you. I didn’t want to, I really didn’t. I had your picture in my compass the whole time I was going down, and I…”
“If you do get shot at Bucky and I will most likely get in front of you and shield you as you shoot back.”
“I finished the laundry while you two were out,” Jarvis said as he slipped into the car.  “You should find your beds freshly made, and there are extra sheets and blankets on your bed, Tony.”
“I’m sure. You’re working in a very competitive field that has just as much reliance on luck as it does on skill when it comes to the question of success.” She smiled, moving around to sit in her chair. She was about to add more when the door opened again with a bang.
Tony’s next appointment was set up for a month later, and he had to admit he was looking forward to it a little. He had spent most of the previous day trying to come to terms with actually being pregnant and what that meant for him. Mostly he dwelled on the fact that Steve’s child was growing inside of him, and that little fact kept him sane and a little bit happy.
“I tried not to let all the muscles and fame go to my head.” Steve smiled, then he looked down at the table, fidgeting with his hands. There was something he needed to talk about, but he wasn’t sure if it was the right time to do so.
“He got too close to an explosion and got blasted off his feet,” Peggy interrupted, looking around to make sure no more Hydra agents were around as the remaining soldiers pressed on through the hallways. “But he’s on his feet, and according to him, if he can stand on his feet, he can fight.”
Steve nodded in understanding. He’d suggest a make up date later on if Tony decided to forgive him. Hopefully before Christmas came around, but if Tony needed longer, Steve was willing to wait. He’d wait a hundred years if that was how long it took. He was going to prove that he wanted Tony still and was going to act like an adult.
“Ah yes, a real shame to lose another objectified omega. Our bodies are the only thing of value we bring to the world. Forget if we might also have a brilliant mind.” Tony huffed. “Won’t matter if I am killed, I’ll never be able to live the life I want, anyway. Either I open my legs for money, or I open my legs for one alpha’s rut so he or she can take care of me while running my family’s business.”
The sounds of a roaring motorcycle broke the silence in the forest, and Tony gripped his gun tighter, waiting even more. The motorcycle Steve was on soon came into view, and Tony’s heart leapt in his throat when he watched a tank come rolling through the first gate of the base. There was a flash and a lot of heat, and then the tank was in pieces, Tony just barely making out Steve vaulting over the first gate on the bike, and then the alpha was gone from his view once more. He swallowed the whine that built up in his throat.
Steve pulled back enough to look his omega in the eyes. “I don’t know exactly what you went through, but I can only imagine. I know you’re tough, but even tough people break down sometimes. Losing the baby is painful, yes. It’s going to be probably for the rest of our lives. But I’m here now, and I’m not leaving again. We’ll mourn the loss together, and I’ll love you as much as I can to show you how much I care.”
Tony sighed but gave in, moving to the closet and pulling out a simple stool that he pulled over to the desk. Apparently Tony dirtying up Miss Pott’s office had happened enough times for her to require such an option.
“None of that makes any sense to me.” Tony deadpanned as he double-checked the lock on his omega collar. He didn’t care if anything else we wore got ruined, but he needed the collar to stay protecting his neck.
Tony let out his own groan, barely getting the word “Alpha” out as he looked back at Steve. He felt his belly get full with the knot, which made him feel so warm and far beyond satisfied. If only Steve hadn’t asked about protection, he would have felt the alpha’s cum filling him as well. Tony settled for just the knot though, simply feeling happy that Steve had finally joined him for a heat. This wasn’t the only time they were going to fuck, Tony knew, but for a moment he could relax before his heat demanded he be filled again. For the time being, he could just relax his body, feel Steve deep inside him and be happy that he finally had a bonded alpha. He just needed that bite scar on his neck…
“Okay… maybe I can’t live without you now,” Tony admitted in a quiet voice. “But I’m still independent! I can at least survive if you’re not around.”
“I know you do. I wish he didn’t have to leave as suddenly as he did. It’s unfair to the both of you. You didn’t really have time to prepare and say goodbye properly.”
“Tony, the tent is ready.” Peggy said gently, putting a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Let’s get you moved over.”
Another long pause, Steve not wanting to talk, just to drink and wish he could get drunk on whatever bottle of stuff he had grabbed.
“Fuck...fine, but tell Stone he owes me a little something extra on my paycheck!” Tony said before kissing Clint as he pulled away and sashayed towards the steps, eyes scanning the crowd to find the best alphas to pay more attention to. Not too drunk. They had no respect at all when plastered. Got bitey, and he had no interest in being mated to some random knot.
Another whine came from the omega’s throat, but he did move closer and felt comfortable when his father continued to run fingers through his hair.  “You would have made me stay in London…”
Steve looked over pages of information, rage running through his veins as he sat there. He was angry, pissed off, enraged beyond belief. Johann Schmidt had taken things too far, and he had to be stopped, or the world would turn slave to the power-hungry man’s desires and plans. A small growl got past Steve’s lips as he read over the information, Tony putting a hand on the alpha’s shoulder.
Tony inhaled. “If he’s never found… the machine I’ll build to keep me frozen will eventually fail, and I’ll wake up and live in whatever age I wake up in, or I die. If he’s found dead, then pull the plug on me, so I can join my alpha in the next life. I don’t want to suffer alone without him any more.”
Tony flushed as he listened to his alpha. “So...your rut might happen at the beginning of the month?”
“It’s still a sexual harassment lawsuit in the making.” she groaned, “I’d put a leash on him but then the press would come up with some new inappropriate scandal as to why he’s being treated like omegas in the olden days…” she shook her head.
Between his legs and looking up at him with bright blue eyes was Steve, the omega’s cock in his mouth and tongue working expertly to make every little noise escape Tony’s mouth. Tony moaned again, a little louder as he rolled his head to the side and let his eyes close again. The thought had just crossed his mind that Steve might not have even bothered to put Tony back into any clothing after taking off his party outfit. Looking up again, Tony noticed the outfit hanging up in his closet. He moaned yet again and brought his legs up around Steve’s head, keeping the alpha in place.
Settled on a plan, the Howling commandos dispersed for lunch, eating their rations whilst talking amongst themselves always being on guard in case a surprise attack happened to sneak up on them. Tony of course stuck by Steve’s side, going around with him and making sure that everyone was happy and ready to fight later that day. After doing rounds, Tony and Steve settled down to eat their own lunch, which Tony had wished he had made sandwiches for everyone rather than eating the rations. Still, this was part of army life, and if he was to be a soldier like the Howling Commandos, he had to eat like one, no matter how tasteless the rations were.
Peggy was the first one to enter the building, searching one way while Tony went another. She stepped over fallen beams and burned furniture that might have caused her to fall if she didn’t watch where she was going. There was a light breeze blowing as a man over a loudspeaker gave out announcements to the citizens of London. She paid them no attention as she paused to look around. She was about to turn back to find Tony when she heard the slightest sound of glasses clinking together. She followed the sound, and to her relief, she found Steve. She sighed as she watched him turn to look at her.
"You mean like chores and such? I can handle doing those things myself. If my omega is loyal, then I'll reward then with all the best things I can offer, no strings attached."
“Yeah, I just… I’m a Stark, yeah, but I’m also an omega. I see mostly alphas in here, maybe some betas, but no omegas.”
More silence, but from their conversation, Steve didn’t sound like he was saying no, which made Tony hopeful. He knew they didn’t have a drill sergeant around, but maybe the Howling Commandos could train him, get him ready for battle in one month. Plus there was the travel time between London and the Hydra base. More time for training up until they were on the front steps of the base.
“Let the man in,” Howard said. “It’s cold outside and I don’t want to pay an extra large heating bill this month.”
Tony stood up from Steve’s lap and wiped his eyes, wiping his hands on his pants. “Well they wouldn’t be alive at this point, so I’m guessing this is info on where they’re buried.”
“He doesn’t need a good alpha, he needs a strict alpha who knows what’s best for him.” a new voice stated.
Steve groaned just as little as he sat up on the edge of the bed and gripped it tight. He focused on the radio now. The announcer’s words sounded familiar, like he had heard them before somewhere else…
If Tony could have blushed any harder, he would have. “Yeah, I guess those would be the next steps in our relationship…”
“You look hurt,” Steve said as he looked over Tony when he pulled back. “Are you sure you can keep fighting?”
There was a kind smile on the doctor’s face as he pulled up a chair and sat next to the bed. “So, I heard we’ve got a sick omega. What kind of symptoms are we having?”
At those words, Steve looked back down at Tony, eyes locking onto the omega’s. If only there was a bit of sunlight coming through the clouds, Tony’s eyes would light up such a beautiful golden color. Steve wanted to see that, to see Tony shining like the sun, happy and bright, eyes lit up and a smile on his face. Steve wanted to see that more than anything else, he realized. He also realized how close their faces actually were, and how easily he could just lean in and kiss Tony. They were away from prying eyes, the moment was right. He leaned in closer, and so did Tony, those bright brown eyes wide as he also realized what was happening. Then Tony’s eyes were closing, and so were Steve’s and they were almost touching, almost kissing.
“You need to heal up before you even think of tinkering again. Your rib won’t heal if you keep moving around like you normally do.”
“And I missed you.” Tony smiled up at Steve before pulling away. “Come on, I’m sure Dad wants to get home as soon as possible.”
Maria shook her head. “No worries, I’m just glad you’re back. I was so worried about your health the whole time. More worried over if your cycles were going to stay normal or not. I know you usually have heats every two or three months.”
“Oh, and what does he bring to the table? Assuming he isn’t just another gold digger looking to take advantage of a lonely, rich omega?”
The omega purred happily at that and only snuggled closer. “I can’t wait until you’re officially part of the family.”
“You’re missing your alpha suddenly, so I’m not surprised that you were too depressed to properly take care of yourself.”
Tony was quick to take Steve into his mouth, closing his eyes and taking in the alpha cock as far as he dared before he gagged a little. To be fair, Steve was huge, and Tony didn’t have the most experience with blowjobs. He did, however, know what made Steve feel good, and he started bobbing his head at a decent pace, which of course caused Steve to groan and tip his head back. The omega had to look up to see his alpha enjoying the attention he was getting. Tony smiled.
“Don’t say that until you know first-hand what I’m like when I’m drunk.” Tony tipped back the rest of his whiskey and set the glass on the bar, requesting another round. “Not that I plan on getting drunk tonight. My dad would kill me if I came home drunker than a pirate all day at sea.”
“I remember,” Tony said. “That was before I had an alpha to ward off any others who wanted to court me. Now I don’t have to worry so much about what I wear.”
Tony got in his way and used what little weight he had to push against Steve, grunting and cringing, his rib hurting more. He got what he wanted. Steve stopped and looked down at the brunet. His hard expression softened, shoulders drooping once again.
The base entrance came to view finally, and Tony smiled wide, eager to jump out and run inside. He had to admit he was so excited to see his alpha again, but he was curious to see if Steve would still keep a distance to be respectful until he knew if Tony had forgiven him or not. The omega couldn’t wait to see. Either way, if Steve came running to him, Tony would go running just as fast.
Sighing, the omega lifted up his shirt for Steve to see how the reactor was embedded in his chest. “My dad put it in me… he saved me by doing so. After we got back to London, I was taking off my uniform, and I realized I had been injured by an explosion… Shrapnel got stuck near my heart, and the arc reactor was keeping the metal from hurting me. The thing was barely hanging on when we got back, and when I took it off, I started going into cardiac arrest. The only reason I’m alive now is because my dad found me right as I passed out and he started working on putting this thing in my chest immediately.”
“There’s no way you need him for the whole day,” Tony said with a skeptical look as they exited the apartment building.
Tony smiled, squeezing his hand, “Remember, there’s going to be lots of cameras and shouting when we arrive. Just smile politely and I’ll get you through as quick as I can.”
Both Steve and Tony looked up at the colonel, eyes wide. It was such a short amount of time to get things done, it almost seemed impossible.
Peggy nodded her head towards the exit while taking off her heels to make her strides quieter. She kept her eyes on Howard until she was out of sight of the older man, motioning for Tony to follow quickly.
Hearing those words made Tony cry harder. Steve actually wanted him, and he wanted Steve. Their need for each other grew by the day, and with the war raging on, they needed each other more than they realized. Both had been underdogs, stuck in the shadows of others while they looked on in hope, wishing to do their part and help. Two underdogs coming together as alpha and omega, it was almost like the perfect love story. The realization struck Tony deep in his heart, and he seemed to melt into Steve’s hold on him. Finally, the crazy equation made sense. This made sense. Being with Steve and going where he went made so much sense.
“Now he’s got you,” Bucky said, looking at Steve. “So you can calm down and hug him again because it’s been months since you two last saw each other, and I’m sure there’s things going to happen in the bedroom later, so get the cuddling done now so I don’t have to see the other stuff.”
“We have time now,” Peggy said gently, putting a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “Are you sure you want to wait?”
Steve nodded, seeming to choose his next words carefully. “Yeah. I didn’t know if I wanted you to come with me or not. I’m still not sure, really. It’s going to be dangerous, even for me.”
“I could say the same, but I hardly went through the trauma that you did.” Steve reached forward and lightly touched the bruise at the side of Tony’s head where the gun had been.
Tony flushed as he was handed the top Peggy had been considering before. It looked like that night was the night to emphasize all his curves. The top buttoned up a bit like an overcoat, which Tony did like. The pants buttoned a similar way as well. Tony’s outfit was a bit like a suit with an omegan touch to it. Truthfully… Tony thought he looked fairly good in it. His watch made for a good accessory, but there still felt like there was something missing. Maybe he did need to put on some makeup…
“Well, if it isn’t the star spangled man with a plan,” the older man said, not looking too impressed that Steve, Peggy, and Tony had all come to his tent, let alone even be in Italy. “What is your plan today?”
Silence fell between the two, but Howard continued to run his fingers through his son’s hair. Tony eventually began purring softly, finding comfort in his father in the moment. It was Tony who broke the silence soon after.
“You’re impossible, Peggy.” Tony sighed as he finally went up the stairs himself, almost running up them as quickly as he could. “You better not have some frilly dress to put me in.”
“So? Just because I’m an omega, that doesn’t mean I don’t have the ability to take care of myself. And don’t use the day you went super soldier as an example. I was in pre-heat, I wasn’t at my full strength.”
“Sex is wonderful, sure, but there’s so much more to all of us than just how wet we get for alphas.”
Nevertheless, Tony didn’t regret any of his decisions. He was happy to finally be helping win the war, even if that meant having to go behind his father’s back. He wasn’t sitting on his butt all day waiting for something exciting to happen. Tony was going to the action rather than just hearing about it.
Tony leaned up against Steve, clasping his hands and batting his eyes, “But I’m just a little omega, what do I know?” he mocked in a way that made it clear he complained about this pretty often, probably to his closest friends.
, for christ’s sake!” Howard started pacing as he lectured his son. “You’re not a soldier, so you need to stop playing like one right now, or you will die. Hydra will not hesitate to kill you just because you’re an omega.”
Peggy helped Tony lay down on the cot he was provided with; all the blankets and pillows he had used piled around him. She wiped a cool cloth over his forehead. “I’m going to leave now, but your tent will be protected all night long, okay?”
"Why are we here?" Steve asked, though his mind was jumping to conclusions as to why exactly they were there.
Once the two had cleaned up and made themselves look presentable once more, Tony ventured out of the closet and to a more open area, halfway searching for his father while Steve waited a few minutes to leave. They couldn’t risk leaving at the same time and looking
"I saw the one about the puppet with the growing nose. Haven't seen any other of Disney's movies, but I agree, I think they're going to get really popular."
It took a few seconds, but Tony’s chest heaved upwards with a deep, shaking breath, and then the omega let it out slowly, opening his eyes for the first time in over 48 hours.
“I wouldn’t mind some bacon on some of those,” Tony added after shaking his thoughts away from Steve.
After the third day of being taken care of by his mother, Tony finally felt well enough to finally leave his room on his own and find some food. Maria was absolutely thrilled to discover her son in the kitchen before she was that morning.
Steve got into the driver’s seat and started up the car. “Want to pick the music we listen to?” he asked Tony once they got onto the road.
The two omegas climbed out the back of the car and hurried inside, each getting the breakfast they were craving. Clint boxing up four slices of pepperoni pizza and a soft drink, Tony grabbing a cheeseburger, a doughnut, and a juice. Then they returned to the car to eat on the way to Hydra’s base.
Nightmares filled Tony’s dreams that night, his body going into panic mode even while he slept. It was the final trigger that caused the disaster to finally rear its ugly head and spit its venom. It started with the cramps suddenly growing sharp and constant. The pain was so great that it woke Tony from his slumber, the omega’s eyes snapping open before he groaned and curled up into a ball. The last time he felt something as painful was in London, passing out on the floor after he had taken his uniform off and realized he needed the arc reactor to survive.
The omega pressed his lips together, flushing even more. “I swear if you don’t stop you’ll be paying to replace this suit and this chair.”
“There’s a good boy.” Howard smiled back while he stood up and retrieved the tray of soup and water. “I expect you to start eating again, okay? If anything, keep your strength and weight up for the baby.”
Silence fell amongst the four, the rain and distant shouting men the only sound reaching their ears. Tony felt the need to move closer to Steve and cling to his jacket, the tension in the air thick enough to almost make him whine. Didn’t help that his heat was due soon anyways.
“You did, I didn’t,” Peggy replied with a smile. “He wanted me to come tell Steve about the equipment. He didn’t tell me to take you with me.”
A medical jeep pulled up to the tent nearby, soldiers barking orders and hurrying to pull the wounded men out. Tony, Steve, and Peggy all looked in silence. Tony leaned into Steve, grabbing hold of his jacket. He’d not seen a man that badly wounded before that close.
“No, I…” Tony paused and focused on breathing as a sharp pain rippled through his side. “I want to talk to him. You said I’m on suppressants, right?”
The Howling Commandos cheered as they crowded around the omega soldier, congratulating him on completing a very basic version of basic training. All excitement aside, Tony was out for blood now, and it wouldn’t be long before he was in Czechoslovakia fighting beside his alpha and finally feeling useful.
Tony didn’t get to finish his sentence  before there was a knock on the front door to their apartment. Both Starks looked towards the door before Tony got up and went to open it, seeing as his father was arms deep in a meatloaf.
“The fifth one was here in Poland, near the Baltic,” Tony heard the blond say, having not paid any attention to the conversation before hand since he was told to sit aside and let the alphas and betas do their work. He hadn’t been too happy with that command given to him by a random agent.
“You can go in one if you want. You’re a grown man and a responsible omega, there’s no shame in going in stores like those.”
"You won't have to worry about a scandal," Steve reassured. "Painting is my entire life now. I'd rather be focused on it most of the time, though I do enjoy admiring cute omegas from time to time."
Steve scoffed. “I keep forgetting I’m an alpha now. I don’t really… feel different mostly. I mean there were some obvious changes, but other than those, I feel the same… Okay maybe not exactly the same. I was really sick before the serum. Now I’m as healthy as a horse.”
“I’ll consider myself lucky for seeing the real Tony Stark, then.” Steve smiled as Tony got the stool, and he looked back at Miss Potts.
Another sigh came from Tony as he dropped the hem of his shirt. “But the reactor’s failing. Running to keep me alive for nearly 70 years has really done a number on it. I need to make a new and improved version so I can keep living… and so I can stay with you.”
Loads of designs suddenly filled Steve's field of vision, each one unique and accompanied by pages of digital notes, most of it mathematical equations. As if Steve couldn't already be more impressed by the omega's work, he found himself nearly speechless at Tony's own creative works. Sharp lines and smooth curves littered the designs in ways that got Steve's artistic mind working overtime.
Nurses came in to check Tony’s heat rate and IV drip, along with a few other things concerning the arc reactor, and they offered coffee and blankets for the parents since it was nearly four in the morning. Maria and Howard were given the option to stay up if they wanted, but they were also allowed to sleep beside their son if they were still tired.
“Your mother told me, but it’s okay, Tony. I’m not upset at you.” Howard twitched his fingers to urge Tony closer again. “I promise I’m not upset.”
"You know… these aren't your only two options. Dancing money, lab rat, none of that is really you. You're called a super soldier for a reason, so I'm pretty sure that means you were made for more than this."
After a while, Steve pulled away, keeping his hands on Tony’s face. “I couldn’t leave you behind, Tony. Not in a million years. I wasn’t sure if I wanted to leave you or take you with me because I care about you a lot. I don’t want to see you get hurt, or worse, while in Europe.”
If there was any sort of silver lining for Tony to follow, it was that maybe, just maybe, Steve would be found and he would be alive.
“It seems you have me at a disadvantage, as Tony has spoken about me to you, but has not in turn spoken about you to me.” Obadiah said, returning the hand shake.
“My baby… I’m so sorry, I want to make this all better for you, but I know I can’t.” With the saddest look in her eyes that Tony had ever seen, Maria rested her hands on her son’s hips. “I wish I could just snap my fingers and cause your suffering to end.”
“I’m sorry, but you know I have to.” Steve hugged Tony again, the hug lasting longer than the last one did. He tried to wrap Tony in his scent as much as he could, nuzzling the omega’s head, then his neck a little at the scent gland there.
“That’s the sacrifice of war though, isn’t it? You give up your life for fighting what you believe in,” Tony responded, standing up to his father with a serious expression. “You can’t make me stay here anymore, Dad. I’m a soldier in this war as much as any of the other Howling Commandos are.”
Steve wasn't quite as fast to remove his suit, but he had to admit he was much more comfortable in the red pajama pants and plain white tank top that replaced the suit. Being away from the flashing lights and loud noises of the gala instantly made Steve feel more in his element.
Tony rolled his eyes, “You have been too busy to listen to me ‘babble about unimportant things that do not in any way affect the future of Stark Industries.’ as you have told me every time we have spoken over the last few weeks. If you had allowed it, you would have been informed that I have been dating again, and that Steve here is said boyfriend.”
Tony gripped the sheets on the bed and moaned out again, his back arching up and legs squeezing Steve’s head, which prevented the alpha from moving very much. He shivered when Steve pulled his head free and shifted his position to line his cock up with Tony’s hole. It was going to be a tight fit, but the more Tony expected his alpha to make the first move, the more excited he got, and the more slick he produced. He was only helping his alpha be more prepared, which made him smile a little.
Howard’s vision instantly blurred as he smiled and looked down at his son. “Tony…” It took all  his willpower not to just smother his son suddenly in a hug.
Steve was leaving Tony behind. Steve didn’t like Tony the way Tony liked Steve. Steve was just being a gentleman because if he didn’t he’d have the wrath of Howard Stark upon him. Steve didn’t want Tony.
"I have a sketchbook… however it seems I have forgotten a pencil." Steve smiled sheepishly at Tony. "Mind if I borrow one?"
Malibu seemed as dim and drab as it had ever been in Tony’s whole life. The rain was never ending, the cold downpour drowning out the sounds of the city and the light chatter being held on the plane Tony, Howard, and Peggy were on. Their landing in southern California signaled the end of the war for them. They wouldn’t need to fight any longer, so long as the troops fighting the Nazis won the war. They had to win soon. There was almost no other choice in the matter. With Schmidt finally gone from the world, Hydra would fall to pieces, and the Nazis would soon follow a similar fate.
Steve straightened up. “Right…” He went to retrieve his shield, which had been lodged between two automatic doors. He looked back at Tony briefly before pulling out his shield and jogging away, the doors closing behind him.
With Tony presented like he was, Steve felt his cock twitch in anticipation. He was excited, to say the least. After a long couple of days walking in the Italian sun and wondering if Tony was alright, Steve was more than ready for this. To spend part of a heat with his omega, tell Tony that he was safe once again, that’s what Steve wanted. He wanted to connect with Tony on a whole new level, move on from the courting phase of their relationship. That phase had probably ended already to be truthful, especially if they were naked on a cot going through a heat for the first time together. It was all so interesting how one day they were still courting, then the next they were sharing a heat together.
, Tony could feel himself getting wet just from the idea of being able to have that freedom. He never thought pillow talk that was so casual and not at all kinky could actually turn him on, but here he was.
“There’s absolutely nothing for you to be scared about, honey,” Maria said, pulling Tony closer to kiss his temple. “I went through most of what you’re going through, so if you have any questions, you just need to ask.”
. But you don’t care about that. You’re just worried your omega son is gonna get himself killed in a war he shouldn’t be fighting in. Well I’ve got news for you,
The brunet nodded, looking at the floor with a small growl, something that he was picking up a habit of. “It’s not fair. I had freedom with those pills, and he took it all away from me. I was able to get away from the normal omega life for once, and now I’m back to being my body’s slave.”
"I guess they do, don't they? Well, I'm sure they'd be willing to protect an omega like you as well."
“Tony, please.” Maria tried to calm her son as best as she could, but the omega was growing more desperate by the second, and she was struggling to hold Tony back. “You can’t go with him, you know that.”
"Only you would bring a limo to pick up your date." Steve smiled and grabbed Tony's hand while they walked.
Steve nodded. “Then tomorrow we’ll get you a prescription for suppression pills and have the meeting.”
"Yeah, makes it easier for us when we get new missions. If you two stay here with us, you'll get your own rooms. If you like of course."
The first couple presents were from Maria, being small trinkets and little tinkering things that she knew Tony would love. Jarvis received gifts from Maria as well, thanking the woman for the gifts and for allowing him to live with her for yet another year. Then it was Tony’s turn to give out his presents. For his mother he got a lovely pearl necklace and matching earrings to go with it. He also got her another dress which he knew matched the pearls perfectly. Needless to say, there were a lot of smiles exchanged between mother and son. When he was done giving his gifts to all but Steve, Tony announced that he was going to wait to give Steve’s gift until the end, which Steve thought was appropriate.
Nevertheless, he was sure that Steve would pick up on how pleased he was based on the uncontrollable purring he was letting out at the sensation of being trapped naked on a soft silk-covered bed by an alpha the size of a fucking truck.
“Oh, yes, hi! Just call me Tony.” Mr. Stark grinned, offering a handshake with his grease-stained hand.
"Then I'm glad to have you back. Having you around… it's been good for me. Ever since we started dating, I've gotten more dependent on you, and I don't see it as a bad thing anymore." Tony smiled, looking up at Steve. "I love you, Steve."
Finally, here is the last official chapter of this fic. There's a little bit of angst here, but it's mostly reunion fluff and the boys finally being back together.
"Very much so. Sorry, I didn't really mean to wake you up this way, but I was going to have to wake you up eventually anyways."
"Thank you." Steve bowed slightly before heading to the elevator he was directed to. He honestly didn't expect to be let deeper into the building without an escort, but maybe Stark was very trusting of his building security.
Tony whined again, feeling so happy to have pleased his alpha. This was what he had wanted, and he hadn’t known that until Steve called him omega and held him closer. He felt even better when Steve put a hand on his belly and gently caressed it. God that would feel so good later on down the road when they decided they wanted to have kids.
Steve didn't really take interest in very many omegas. Maybe he had a type, but that type didn't show up very often in his daily life. Being a hydra agent kept him on his toes anyways, so he didn't really have the time to search out an omega to even satisfy for just one night. However, every once in a while, an omega passed him by that he was attracted to, and he'd typically get his way with them, usually for a price. Thankfuly money wasn't an issue for him, especially since some omegas had a high price. He paid good money for just a few hours of fun that didn't leave a lasting impact on him.
The party lasted well into the night, presents being handed out when the clock struck midnight. Maria had her hands full for sure, but thankfully Jarvis was there to help her hand out the presents to friends, family, and coworkers. Of course, presents between Maria, Tony, Steve, and Jarvis were saved until the morning, so they would have a more private family time to be merry and love each other. Handing out presents took what seemed like forever, and Tony admitted he wished he could just go to bed already. He wasn’t feeling the greatest anyways. Too much champagne, probably…
"Oh, so you have hearing aids. I wondered what was on your ears." Steve smiled. "Must be helpful when you're playing with different weapons."
“I’m all for omega rights, Ms. Carter,” Howard spat. “But you don’t understand what it’s like to watch your own son decide he’s fit for battle when he’s an omega.”
“We’d better get out of here if we want to make it to our beds tonight then,” the blond alpha said, taking Tony’s arm in his and starting to walk towards the door, pausing so they could grab their coats.
Rhodey rolled his eyes and gave a sharp swat to the back of Tony’s head with his fingertips, earning a surprised “ow” from the omega.
Tony tumbled into the back of the limo and once Steve followed, he tugged Steve into a seat and slipped into his lap. “Sorry about how this date turned out.”
When the car did finally park, Tony was out and into the sunlight instantly, scanning over the people who were walking around. Still he didn’t see his father, friend, or alpha, which caused him to whine slightly. He finally gave his mother some attention when she put a gentle hand on his shoulder.
It didn’t take much longer for Tony to be grasping at the blankets and pillows, limbs spazzing about as his mind went fuzzy, his belly and groin heating up until he was shouting with his orgasm, his whole body shaking while at the mercy of the blond alpha still fucking him with what felt like his whole might. Tony tried to look back at Steve, because he knew those sharp blue eyes were staring at him, so focused on him with only one thought running through his mind because that was just how alphas got when they were close to their own orgasm.
Tony winced at Howards sharp words, every one of them true. Tony had put himself out on the line and willingly made himself a target of Hydra. It was a bad situation to be in, but Steve and Bucky had protected him the whole time. Surely that could mean that they would keep protecting him, and Howard would be okay with that.
When the lab had been cleaned, both Peggy and Steve came in, the alpha looking very upset and ashamed. Tony ignored them, opting instead to look over his designs angrily and consider tearing them up so they would never be used. He ignored a lot of the conversations that the three were having until Howard mentioned something about vibranium, which caught Tony's attention. One shield the older Stark had constructed was perfectly round, shiny, and was apparently made of the only vibranium that was available at the time. Tony was aware that Steve turned towards him with the shield in hand, and he lowered his eyebrows when Steve smiled.
“Shame. I had high hopes for you when I looked you up. I assumed a war hero would know better. Well, enjoy your time with our Anthony while you can. It won’t be lasting.” Justin smiled as if he were wishing the man a good evening and not low-key threatening him before he turned to walk off.
“Oh shit, grenade!” His feet slipped as he hurried away from the vehicles as fast as he could. Steve and Bucky were quicker than he was, and he was surprised when he felt his feet leave the ground as the two alphas picked him up.
“Yes, we just need to find Steve and we’ll be fine.” Peggy led the way towards the back of the bar, looking around with sharp eyes, discouraging any alphas from making a move. She moved her head suddenly towards a hallway that lead to another part of the bar.
"You'll get paid, don't worry about that." Steve stood close to Tony as he waited for the door to open. "Never heard of multiple lawyers for a stripper's family. Either you get a lot of lawsuits or your family is just overprotective."
When there were only Tony’s and Steve’s presents to each other left, Maria and Jarvis left to begin on lunch, leaving the couple to exchange gifts alone. Steve felt a bit relieved by that, and he felt more confident in giving Tony his gift.
Tony woke up feeling very good. It took him a minute to process how good he felt, letting out a soft moan before opening his eyes. Ah, yes, that was why he felt so good.
“God, you need to eat like cinnamon or something next time because that was disgusting.” Tony shuddered as he paused in stroking his own cock.
Peggy turned to look at him and smiled. “But they look damn fine on you. The high rise really suits your body. Now put this on.”
There was a beta man sitting behind a desk, looking bored. But he looked up at Steve, and then at his computer before nodding, “Mr. Rogers? Have a seat, Miss Potts will be right with you once she’s back from lunch.” he gestured to a row of comfortable looking chairs.
Thankfully, Steve wasn’t busy with anything other than talking to Bucky. Clutching his side where his rib was hurting once more, Tony marched right up to him and buried his face in his alpha’s chest. All conversation between Steve and Bucky ceased when Tony had come up, and it gave them an idea just how well the conversation between father and son had gone.
The car was fast, faster than any car that Tony had ever been in, and he honestly couldn’t help the smile that formed on his lips the faster the car went. It was probably wishful thinking to hope that one day he could drive a car like the one he was in, but he didn’t care. He was enjoying speeding after the plane that undoubtedly held Johann Schmidt in its pilot seat. Just the thought of Schmidt made Tony growl, and Steve growled along with him.
"If you want, then yes. And all that comes before that as well." Steve smiled slightly at the end of his sentence.
Phillips didn’t waste time to smash the button that Tony had pointed to. The car’s engine roared and it surged forward, once again gaining on the plane that was so close to leaving the runway.
Sighing and sitting back from his plate, Tony looked over at his mother. “Sorry, I just didn’t eat much during my heat…”
Tony took a bit to respond, panting to catch his breath and groaning every couple seconds in pain. “Let him make his comments. They won’t matter when I make my own inventions and surpass him in a few years. I’ll be the most talked about then.”
“And you know what? The suppressant pills I’m taking are working beautifully, and I’m going to continue to take them because they give me a sharp mind, they keep me focused, and I don’t have to worry about any more heats. They give me freedom, and I won’t let you take that away from me,” Tony added as an afterthought. He regretted it immediately.
“Oh, Tony… You don’t look like you feel very well.” Maria put her hand against her son’s forehead. “You don’t feel warm… Have you been eating the food I’ve brought you?”
“I would be doing a lot if you just let me do the things I want to do,” Tony snapped back. “Let me work on your projects with you, let me make designs for weapons you can make, let me do the calculations!”
“I’d like to go without it as much as possible,” the brunet said, walking into the apartment and closing the door behind him.
“I will, I promise.” The alpha pulled back, looking down at Tony with a sort of sadness in his eyes. He was going to miss Tony.
A short while later, another knock at the door caught James’s attention, and he went to open the door once more. This time was the boisterous fiance of Bruce at the door, a large, joyful smile on his face.
Shaking his head, Tony sighed. “I wish I knew when I would be seeing Steve again. Maybe Dad will let me come back to London on his next leave. Which will be in… August, I think. God, that’s such a long time to wait.”
“He just needs to get me as close as he can,” Steve said, turning to look at the map, an arm staying around Tony’s shoulders. “You know, you and Howard are going to be in a lot of trouble when you land.”
"Thank you," Steve said with a smile, rolling the chair to a position he had the most views of the projected designs. "Don't hesitate to ask me anything, of course. I want this mural to be perfect."
Tony got a few more visitors that day, the remaining Howling Commandos coming by to see how he was; shocked and pained to see their little friend in such a bad state. They all were hopeful, knowing that Tony was a tough omega and could survive anything if he put his mind to it. With their hopeful condolences, the Howling Commandos each left their wing patches with the omega, along with a little cash to help the family, because they knew more than anyone in the room, except for Tony, how hard it was to lose friends in war.
Steve smiled, closed the distance between them, and kissed Tony softly in the middle of the dance floor.
“I’ve got some toast and a couple eggs for us,” Howard said as he looked at his son. “Are you good with eating on the way? I’ve got to get to the base as soon as possible.”
“Does he have that intense alpha gaze when he’s focused on you?” the mother pressed, not really ever having a conversation like this with her son before.
Tony didn't know how long he had been standing at the mirror in the bathroom, nor did he remember when he even got there. But the next thing he knew, a large hand rested on his shoulder and startled him, making him jump forward and slam his face into the mirror with a yelp.
Fury had left rather quickly, not wanting to stick around for anything the reunited couple planned to do, but Tony and Steve had hardly recognized that he had left, the two being engrossed by a rather passionate kiss that was heavy on the heavy petting. Relationships between alphas and omegas who had been apart for a long time eventually got rather physical, despite the deep pain one or both might have gone through. It was just one way that mate sickness could have been cured, and though neither of them really were experiencing the sickness that most couples dreaded, they still were feeling small symptoms of it, and even the slightest amount of symptoms were never comfortable.
Howard sighed and shook his head. “I know our past hasn’t been the best… but I want to fix this. I want to fix our relationship.”
Steve nodded. “My new job could possibly get me to London eventually, so I’m willing to do it. I’ll get over seas, just not as fast as Peggy will.”
Tony rolled his eyes, but Bucky was technically right. It had been months since Steve and Tony had last seen each other, let alone even touched, and Tony had spent a heat alone; which had been miserable. It was high time the alpha and omega got to spend time alone again. Besides, Tony did have another heat due very soon. His nest at home was already prepared, for the most part. Of course, it would have to be adjusted to allow Steve to join.
“Dr. Erskine said that the serum wouldn’t just affect my muscles, it would affect my cells,” he started, his voice shaking. “Create a… protective system of regeneration and healing, which means, um… I can’t get drunk.”
Tony looked over at the cars and jogged over to one, jumping into the driver’s seat and then ducking his head down below the dashboard. “I can hotwire this car, just get in so we’re not wasting time!”
Tony inhaled unsteadily as Steve wiped away more of his tears. He grabbed his alpha’s wrist when Steve’s hand rested on his cheek. “I know… I was happy about the baby, but…”
In terms of what all the checkup included, Tony was physically examined and had a bunch of tests done, including one to make sure he was indeed pregnant, which he was, so the rest of the checkup proceeded. He was given prenatal vitamins and a rough estimate for a due date, which September felt like a long time away, but Tony suspected that the time would fly when he got to be with Steve again. The checkup in general was easy to go through and was hardly anxiety inducing. Tony was glad for that, but all he wanted to do was go back home and have a cheeseburger, even though he knew he’d get sick if he ate one.
Tony was then taken on an adventure through omegan fashion by the enthusiastic employee, trying on several items and deciding on a few to buy, much to his own surprise. The top he originally had looked at was added to the number of other tops and outfits he was getting. The employee was kind enough to apply a good discount to Tony’s total, as a thank you for letting him help pick out clothing. A few bonus items were also added into the bag, including a couple of colognes that were intended to help enhance Tony’s scent and some basic items to help make heats more comfortable. By the time Tony had left the store, he had a good sized bag full of clothes and bonus items, plus a coupon for the next time he visited the store.
When Tony entered the lab, he slammed his designs on the main table next to all the shields his father had been working on for Steve. That stupid alpha didn’t know when he was going too far, and he had very much crossed the line of respect for Tony. How dare he accuse Tony of cheating on him! Why the hell would he ever think that? Tony was loyal, had been for months now, and suddenly Steve kisses someone else once and blames it on the omega. Typical alpha behavior! Stupid alpha!
"Bucky's always been an alpha, but Hydra saved us both after too long being frozen. Unfortunately Bucky didn't make it out with both his arms."
“Sorry you got told that,” Steve said in a gentle voice, placing an equally gentle hand on Tony’s thigh. “I wanted you at the table the whole time, to be honest. You’re important enough to me to know what’s going on with all this Hydra business.”
Getting a playful smirk, Tony pulled away and shed his coat, tossing it haphazardly onto the coat rack nearby and grabbing Steve's hand. He pulled his alpha away from prying eyes, into a room where hardly anyone ever went, then into a storage closet that was mostly empty. Once they were inside the closet, Tony locked the door from the inside and pressed up against Steve with a lustful look in his eyes.
Steve did as he was told, opening the box and gazed upon the glistening black ring that was nestled inside. “Tony, this is gorgeous… where did you get it?”
Clenching his jaw, Tony pulled away and left the dancefloor, making his way over to the bar to grab something stronger than champagne.
“He got held up at work. His last client of the day needed extra breaks.” Bruce said before looking at Steve again with a smile, “Donald Blake, though most people who knows him just call him Thor. He’s a tattoo artist. Owns the shop Odinson’s tattoo and piercings with his siblings. As an artist yourself, I’m sure you can relate to projects taking longer than anticipated, even if your canvases don’t move around or need food and bathroom breaks.”
The two looked at each other with smiles and soft eyes before kissing gently, and then suddenly Tony pulled away and grabbed his present to Steve. “I knew what I wanted to give you before we started talking more seriously about getting married and at that stuff… But, I don’t know, maybe this will mean something more now.”
“I was. I still am, but it’s harder to search now, since my search is no longer funded by the army. They got what they wanted and backed out before I had time to even get a say in the matter.”
Searching for the alpha proved to be difficult. Wherever Steve was, he didn’t want to be found. They searched in the bar that held good memories with the Howling Commandos and other friends, they searched in shops and other bars, they searched almost anywhere they could think of. The last place they looked was in destroyed homes, torn down from attacks and fires caused by the war. Tony searched one part of the street while Peggy searched another. Their places of finding Steve were narrowing down, and Tony was steadily getting more and more upset. He even tried calling out for Steve, but he never got a response. Even attempting to tap on his ring and get a response proved to be useless. Steve wanted to be alone, or at least Tony was sure Steve
Tony smiled as he leaned against his alpha. “I love you too,” he said quietly, then reached for another kiss. “This is amazing, Steve, thank you.”
Tony nodded, hiding his face in Steve’s chest. “Sorry, you sounded like you were excited to move on with our relationship… but I’m too worried I’m going to lose you. I already worry about you when you go off on missions without me.”
Whining, Tony turned his back to Steve and strapped on his arc reactor, feeling its energy flow through him and put up an invisible shield around him. Though his hands were covered with gloves, he still tapped on his ring to send Steve a quick “I love you” through the vibrations the ring sent. He felt a little better when he got an almost immediate response back, but as he was handed a rifle, Tony didn’t feel that much better. Maybe his father had been right. Maybe he should have stayed at home and just waited for Steve to get back home.
“Little Bitsy. I like it.” Steve smiled and shifted Tony around until they were both facing the rain. Gently he put his arms around Tony’s waist and rested his chin on the omega’s shoulder.
Steve had a moment where he stared at the older man. “But if you know where they are, why not at least--”
Some rubbing alcohol and clean bandages cleaned up the wounds as best as Howard could do, and then he sat down with Tony cradled in his arms. The omega wasn’t able to wake up for a while, that much Howard knew, but at least he had stopped the major bleeding, and hopefully he had saved his son from death.
By the time the two were fully dressed, save for Tony’s arc reactor, which was in his hands wrapped up around its straps, the Howling Commandos were standing at the ready, waiting to be led by Steve into what was probably the most important battle of their lives. This battle demanded the attention of not just the commandos, but of the men under Colonel Phillips’s command. The headquarters of Hydra was a far more ambitious take down than any of the other Hyda bases. This was going to require all the wits and brawn they could come up with, and even then, it wasn’t going to be easy just to take down Johann Schmidt.
When things had settled down, Steve fell onto his side, taking Tony with him, and held the omega close. Tony had been so damn perfect for Steve that the alpha was in a daze when he came down from his orgasm high. He took in a deep breath and let it out slowly, looking down at the omega. “Are you alright,” he asked after a bit,  his voice rough and deep.
Steve smiled right back, then turned to face the plane once more as he fastened his shield onto his back. He climbed around to the front of the car with just barely enough time to duck, the spinning blades scraping against it with a terrible screech. Tony, Peggy, and Phillips also had to duck to avoid getting hit by the blades, and they had to remain ducked as the plane picked up speed once again, which scared Tony half to death. He felt like if he breathed wrong, the blades would take off his head, and that would be the end of him.
Tony took a deep breath before he stepped inside and turned to face his parents. Before the door closed on him and blasted him with an intense cold that would knock him out almost instantly, he let slip a few more tears and a few more precious words.
“Well, forgive me for being a bit skeptical over the claims that you two are old men that used to shoot Nazis back in the forties, but I need to see how the science on that checks out, first. Until then, you two are just two handsome alphas in your late twenties, maybe early thirties.” Tony said.
“Sounds like you’re talking about a number close to infinity,” Steve said gently, running his fingers through his omega’s soft hair. He loved how long it had gotten since he last saw it.
Steve groaned into the kiss while he moved his hand faster over Tony’s cock, his knee moving to one side of the omega’s hips, his other knee moving to the other side.
Finishing up in the bathroom, Tony groaned. Looking at himself in the mirror, he shook his head. “Why aren’t you fucking getting better,” he muttered. “Are you trying to kill me, body?”
Tony finally fell unconscious after a losing battle, and his life was suddenly in the hands of anyone who might have been lucky to pass by and notice just his arm peeking out from behind the screen set up in the corner of the locker room.
They finally arrived at Tony’s personal lab, the door sliding open automatically to admit them and the lights flickering on.
Tony shook his head in awe. “I can’t believe we’re eating here.” He took Steve’s arm and let himself be led inside, marveling at the shining chandeliers and soft classical music playing. He barely heard any of the conversation Steve had with the man at the front desk about their reservation, then he felt like he was floating on clouds as they entered the dining area, Tony catching sight of several notable persons. There was a moment where he felt like he didn’t deserve to eat there among such high class alphas.
"I think you'll like my work," Steve said while handing over the portfolio. "Feel free to make any comments. I love hearing feedback from people."
Tony made eye contact with his father and sighed. “Hopefully I get all of the lecture from him tonight. He’s got more important things to focus on for you tomorrow.”
Bucky rolled his eyes, grabbing Tony’s wrist and lifting it while also lightly punching the omega’s side. He sighed when Tony cried out in pain and jerked away his hand. “Sure, just bruised.”
Howard brought up a chair next to the bed and sat in it, not wanting to upset Tony’s stomach with the smell of food in case his stomach wasn’t well. Tony didn’t move when Howard reached his hand over to brush through his son’s hair long dark curls clumped together with sweat and tears.
Tony watched the buildings fly by as Steve drove the three of them to his apartment, the trunk of the car loaded up with Tony’s belongings. It was a silent drive, all three men knowing how difficult the situation was, especially for Tony. They would get everything set up for him so he would be comfortable in his heat, but even Bucky knew that there was the looming dread of Tony having to go back home alone.
“You know you could get killed while taking down a Hydra base,” Steve said in a warning tone after some time.
“You have no idea, Mom. He gave me his dog tags to bring back home so I could have something of his while we were apart.” Tony pulled out the dog tags and looked at the name on them with a fond smile. “But I did go to Europe with him… and I’m sorry I didn’t tell you until much later. I should have told you sooner.”
As soon as they entered, Tony slammed a picture frame down on its face, hiding a picture of the two of them smiling and hugging. Tony loathed that picture as he sat down at his desk, crossing his arms and staring at the blond alpha as he sat opposite of him on the bed. “I’m not going to forgive you any time soon, I hope you know.”
There was a long moment where Tony couldn’t decide if he was on the edge of passing out or not. Everything was suddenly so intense and Steve was thrusting about as hard as he had when in rut, which was saying something. Steve didn’t usually ever get that intense when he was out of rut, but perhaps it was Tony’s growling that had set the alpha off, and Tony didn’t regret a bit of it.
“My apartment. I’ve got some clothes that will be perfect for you to wear tonight.” Peggy opened up the door to the stairs that would lead them up above ground. She pushed Tony in front of her, making sure the door closed quietly before she hurried up the stairs.
“I’m glad you could spend Christmas with us, Steve,” Maria said as she took a break from cooking to grab a cup of coffee. “I know you’ve mentioned that you don’t really have any family left, but as far as I’m concerned, you’re basically family here already.”
“Not all night,” Tony said, though his cheeks flushed because he was up most of the night, just not all of it.
“I feel like I need to,” Tony grumbled as he pulled away, holding a hand against his rib. “A lot of things have happened, Mom…”
“I’m not sure he’ll be up for breakfast. He was still fast asleep when I got out of my shower, and I showered for a long time.”
Tony shivered. “I hope that won’t happen… but I know what I have to do, and I won’t hesitate to give my life up if it’s necessary.”
“Well, I was thinking… since I stay at our base here in London all the time… maybe I could do more this time.”
Tony couldn’t say that he felt absolutely terrible for just leaving his father a note that he was headed to Czechoslovakia, but he didn’t feel great about it. He was sure Howard was attempting to get ahold of Steve, but as far as Tony could tell, Steve wasn’t answering any calls he might be getting, which Tony appreciated greatly. Besides, it seemed like Howard hadn’t noticed any of the training Tony had been doing to get ready for the mission. That was a good thing, but Tony was sure that when he got back, he was getting a stern talking to.
“Tony, it’s okay,” Maria soothed, grabbing his hands to still them. “I should have suspected, because you have a lot of the symptoms I had when I was pregnant with you.”
“Your father won’t know about any of this until he gets back,” Maria reassured. “You have my word. Steve on the other hand should know as soon as possible. I recommend writing him, or even calling him if you can.”
Steve chuckled as he stood up fully, pulling Tony with him. “We still need to clean up a little. Can’t have any hint left over from this.”
Steve sighed. “What you saw was far from the truth. The private was talking with me about how I saved all those soldiers and she was getting uncomfortably close with me. I told her I was taken, but she refused to listen to me. Next thing I knew she was kissing me, and… yeah I kissed her back, but it was because I was thinking of you.”
.” Those being his last words, Tony stormed away into the lab, leaving Steve to think about what he had said and regret every word.
“Fuck!” No sooner than the alpha had spoken, the omega’s body shivered and he clenched even tighter around Steve’s knot, a fresh rush of slick trapped inside save the small dribble that had managed to escape and was slowly running down along the curve of his ass.
The omega’s body shook with his sobs. He wanted to speak, to object to Steve’s plan, but he physically couldn’t speak without wailing. He remained silent, listening to the last sentences his alpha was ever going to say to him. The new pain he felt was gut deep and heart aching, and there was no escaping or healing it. Tony knew he only had a short time left with his alpha, and he wanted to badly to hold Steve as tightly as he could.
"I'd blame my dad, but if rather no part of my life be all thanks to him. I think you can understand."
“No…” Tony tried to rush forward, intending on giving the visitor a piece of his mind for ruining the holidays, but Maria quickly grabbed him and held him close, knowing how her son would react.
Rubbing his tired eyes, Howard looked up at his wife and sighed. “Thank you… How is Tony today? Has he eaten anything yet?”
Tony groaned, feeling a wonderful mess as he lay on the silk sheets, half asleep, and half aware of Steve getting up and the sound of the bath water running. Fuck, this alpha even willingly did proper aftercare…
“You’ve been dancing with Tony for a long time. You’re a good looking alpha, I’m sure you wouldn’t have troubles finding a new dance partner.”
Steve looked up at her and pulled out his transponder. It had a hole blown in it. “Couldn’t call my ride.”
Steve put his hands on Tony’s shoulders to keep him in place while sliding the rest of his cock into the omega. When he was fully inside, he let Tony adjust and relax before he even dared to move. Steve knew he was large, all thanks to the serum, and he wasn’t some alpha who just took what he wanted without a care. No,he was respectful enough to give Tony time to get used to his size.
The brunet shook his head. “I won’t forgive you so easily. I’m still convinced you aren’t ready to settle with me, so give me some time to think…”
“Yeah, no, Ty and Justin both are a firm no. Anyone else I could politely dance with so long as it’s not so many people that I end up neglecting my actual date.” Tony said firmly. “I didn’t drag my boyfriend here so he can stand by the wall hoping for some time with me.”
"And I love you, Tony." The blond pulled Tony closer with a happy sigh. "I'm glad I got that serum. There was no way you were going to be interested in dating a sick stick of a beta."
Tony gave a weak smile. “Silly alpha… I’m fine, just exhausted. That’ll be a different story once I’m in heat though.”
Tony rolled his shoulders and moved to the front of the assault team, acting just as one of the commandos might. In the back of his mind, Tony wondered what rank he might be in the army if he had been an actual soldier. His mind didn’t linger on that thought for long, because his eyes caught sight of Steve pushing the motorcycle out of the plane and towards the woods. A quick tap of his ring got Steve to pause and look towards the assault group, and as soon as he spotted Tony at the front with Phillips and Peggy, he nodded, and Tony nodded back. Then everyone was heading out, moving into position for the attack on Hydra’s headquarters.
Tony snorted. “I don’t want to dance that bad. I’ll settle for keeping myself in the corner, thank you.”
The omega responded with a broken moan before clearing his throat and clinging tighter to the alpha, “Won’t know until I try to walk. If I can’t, then I’m more than alright, alpha.”
“Well yeah, I wouldn’t stick around if you did try to make e do that, but I’m pretty sure you won’t. You’re nothing like those jerks.”
"It's be nice if we could get some more alone time. I mean I know we just spend part of my last heat together… but I'd like to spend a whole one with you." Tony leaned in closer, lowering his voice as he spoke about the more private topic.
“Try not to think too hard on that. You know he wants to be with you, and he’ll come back if you’re not able to go to him.”
“I am amazing, thank you for noticing.” Tony grinned, “Do you need a pencil or something? I’m sure I have one somewhere around here. Paper, too if you didn’t bring any blank sheets or anything other than your portfolio.”
Tony closed his eyes. Such a violent way to die… Who knows how long they would have lived if the driver of that car hadn’t run off the road. “Thank you… that’s not really what I wanted to hear, but… it’s better than not knowing at all. I just hope that they were happy still after I left them. I’d feel really guilty if I knew they were unhappy.”
Tony had nothing more to say. He was losing his ability to think straight, and all he could do was just hold on to his alpha, try to collect his thoughts.
"If that would be alright," Steve said, moving to set the bottle of whiskey on the counter next to the sink.
A little growl built up in the back of Tony’s throat, which surprised him as much as it surprised his father. “I know, but I don’t care. I’m doing something that helps in the war instead of me sitting on my ass all day and just waiting for my alpha or my dad to come home to take care of me. I don’t want to live like an omega!”
Though he truly missed his best friend, Steve found himself happier than he had been in quite a while, and he caught himself thinking that he would be happy staying with Tony for the rest of his life. That thought put a smile on his face while he cuddled Tony closer and closed his eyes.
And then the noise calmed down and the heat grew cold. All that remained was the almost calming sound of everything on fire. Tony opened his eyes and looked around as best as he could, sitting up and grunting as his side gave him a fit of pain. It felt like the rib he had broken months before had cracked once more.
“Sounds like holidays are lonely for him. I bet that if he doesn’t have any missions planned, he’ll be here later this year to spend time with you.”
“Well, I programmed them to learn and develop, so the older they get, the more sentient they seem.” Tony said fondly.
“I’m going after Schmidt. I’m not going to stop until all of Hydra is dead or captured.” Steve pulled Tony closer as he spoke, acting protectively of him.
“Yeah, it can be a bit overwhelming to someone new to this type of thing. That’s why I told you to just stick close and smile while I get us through as fast as possible. Ready?”
“I will make you better ones eventually!” Tony vowed, “I’m sure Steve will make sure I’ll have access to tools and supplies!”
“Depends on how well I know the omega. I typically start off rough with a new omega, because from my experience, omegas are practically horny all the time. But you are different from others.” Steve smirked at Tony, eyes roaming over the small frame of the omega.
“I swear you’re more omega now than you’ve ever been,” the mother said gently, placing a hand on her son’s shoulder. “But I’m very glad to see you’re getting closer to your normal self again. I was worried you were getting sick.”
Tony nodded, though he whined again as they walked towards the hangar. There were so many people around and not one of them that he saw was Steve. Was it too much to ask for just a small sign that would point the omega in the direction of his alpha?
As soon as the door closed again, Tony finally collapsed to the floor, eyes wide with tears streaming down his face. This wasn’t how he imagined Steve being called back to duty would happen, but here it was slapping him in the face and telling him that he couldn’t follow. It hurt him deeply, to know that his alpha was leaving to go overseas once more and fight in the war they had nearly forgotten about completely. The day was ultimately ruined, and there was nothing that could have been done to fix it.
“Captain Bones, then?” Tony said, allowing himself to be stripped of his skimpy top, and catching a glimpse of a tattoo on Steve’s bicep; a skull with six tentacles, it looked like, though he wasn’t sure in the lighting and the angle he could glimpse it from.
Both parents sat back to look at their omega son, wondering what was going through his mind. “A bond left to rot often leads to a lifetime of illness, both physical and mental,” Howard said. “I know what’s happening to you, son, but there’s nothing we can really do for you. I mean, it’s not like time travel is possible and you can just go back to see Steve before he crashed in that plane.”
“I know. He will just have to learn to let Steve take care of you. You know your father doesn’t like anyone else but him to be labeled as your caretaker.”
Tony shrugged. “I don’t care. He took away my freedom that you gave me, and there’s no point in going back to the pharmacy to get my refill. That bottle was supposed to last me for months. If I go back now, they’ll assume I’m a drug addict or something.”
Tony’s hair had gotten significantly longer since the first time he had met Steve, but he maintained it about shoulder length in the back. He often just brushed it back so it wouldn’t be in his face when he worked on designs. In the five years since the end of the war, since Tony lost everything, he had also neglected to keep himself clean shaven all the time. As a male omega, facial hair wasn’t impossible, but it often grew very slow and patchy compared to male betas or alphas. That was roughly what his own facial hair looked like, but he had convinced himself that it looked good on him, and it made him look like he was off the market for any courting. Tony would only allow one alpha into his life, and that was Steve. Now that Steve was gone, he wasn’t interested in anyone else, and he was glad his parents didn’t push for him to start looking again.
“Suspended animation. Slowing down the body’s functions just enough to keep a person alive but asleep. It’s possible that if Steve survived, that he’s in a similar state right now, probably due to the serum or the high metabolism he had, due to the serum.”
“Not with your big alpha to protect us,” Peggy said with a smirk. That woman put Tony on edge sometimes.
Steve looked at Fury with a renewed interest, though his heart still ached for his lover. "Fiancé, actually."
“As nice as she is, there’s no way I could live with her. She’d be making me dress up like a pretty omega in a matter of weeks.”
There were a lot of nurses, and one man who looked like a doctor, who smiled at Steve before stepping out of his way. And then there, right in front of him being supported by a couple of nurses, was a little brunet omega with long dark curls and a hint of facial hair. Soft brown eyes, gentle hands gripping tightly onto the nurses, and a glowing blue disk in his chest. He was dressed in soft clothing, a loose t-shirt that had the bolded letters of ARMY across the chest, and a pair of jeans that seemed to barely stay on the man’s hips. He looked just a little older, but that was him. That was Steve’s omega.
Steve turned his head to the new visitor, yet again, and blinked. "Why would a strict alpha be better for him? Restricting him would only hinder his amazing talents."
Again, the omega nodded, carefully taking the bowl of soup he had been offered. He took a small spoonful into his mouth before he managed a slight chuckle. “You need to go to bed.”
“I do want to fight, and I’m going to,” Tony said, a hint of a growl underneath his voice. “I’m doing my duty to America. How can you tell me no after knowing what I’m fighting for?”
“I know, which is why I’ve been getting ideas for a suit of my own,” Tony said hurriedly, as if he had a short amount of time to convince Steve to let him go. “I’ve been watching my dad build this sort of reactor, or the beginnings of one that can harness a power similar to yours. I thought about incorporating that to the suit to protect me…”
"I care about you, Tony. I know I can't fix what happened in the past, but I want you to help you have a better future at least." Steve hugged Tony close, kissing the top of the omega's' head.
“It’s not that simple, unfortunately.” Peggy sighed as he brushed her bangs out of her face. “I’m afraid this assignment is a more permanent one, and it won’t be one to return from for a while.”
“No, no! I’m not leaving for London again yet. But this concerns your heat.” Steve sighed. “You know alphas typically go into rut around the same time their omega has a heat. They line up after the two have been around each other for a while.”
“Super soldier who wakes up in a strange time and gets bombarded with agents, wouldn’t you think I’d try something to escape?”
"Slow down, Cap. One new thing at a time. You've got all the time in the world right now, so just take a breather and relax."
“I’m more worried about what your dad is going to do to me. He told you to stay, and he’ll find out that you were with me, he’ll think this was all my plan. Not that I’m worried.”
“So when’s the next base attack planned for?” he asked, planning on bringing the plan up gently to Steve.
“R-right…” Wiping his mouth, Tony sighed and straightened his clothes. “If Mom and Dad are buried somewhere around Malibu,  I want to go visit them.”
“We don’t want that, now do we?” Tony rolled over, despite Steve’s whine of opposition, and kissed the alpha’s nose. “I’m gonna be right by your side until this war ends, no matter what.”
There was nothing more to be said from the brave alpha who had sacrificed himself for the safety of his country. Steve Rogers had said his last words to his omega, and they left burning marks on Tony’s broken heart as he sat in that chair and sobbed loudly. He mourned over his mate, the one he was to marry and the father of the child that grew inside him. He mourned over his best friend he had lost only days before. Tony mourned long and hard for the two people in his life who had loved and supported him and were the best friends he had ever had. They were both gone, and all Tony had was his parents and Peggy. Tony was suddenly lost in the large world that had so cruelly taken Bucky and Steve from his life.
Peggy aimed her gun and shot at the alpha, her face scrunched up in anger, but her shots didn’t help anything. The alpha grabbed Tony and hauled him back to his feet and pulled him flush against his body. “Shoot again and I’ll make sure you hit this omega,” the alpha shouted, his alpha tone coming through strong.
Sighing, Peggy stood up, ready to leave for the night, or the early morning rather. It was close to one in the morning, and though nurses and doctors kept checking on Tony, they never did anything new to help the omega feel like he needed to live. It saddened Peggy, but there was nothing she could do, and the doctors already had their hands full with injured and dying alpha soldiers, and because of that, unfortunately, omegas who were suffering injuries were often overlooked and ignored.
A few more soldiers were blasted out of existence as Tony rolled out from behind the crates and started shooting again. Peggy came up from behind him and fell into step as they charged forward again, shooting and pushing back Hydra agents until they looked like they were beginning to retreat. Finally, they were winning the battle a little, and if they kept pressing forward, Hydra would have no choice but to surrender.
"Wait until everyone finds out your eye candy is just a simple painter," Steve said while getting in the car, thanking Happy.
Once they had a wine picked out that both would enjoy drinking, they began looking over the menu, sitting in happy silence while they decided what they wanted. Before too long the waiter came back with the wine and glasses to put it in, plus some water glasses. He took the couple’s orders and went back to the kitchen to get their meals started.
The sudden voice startled Tony, and he jerked, causing him to cry out in pain. He took a moment to catch his breath before looking over at the person who had spoken. It was Peggy.
“Mr. Stark,” the blond greeted with a little rough undertone to his voice. “It’s wonderful to see you again.”
Stunned that Steve had actually let him go, Tony scoffed, then his face crumpled up into a sob and he buried it in his hands. He couldn’t believe Steve didn’t want him. Showing all his kindness and flirting every once in a while, taking him out on a date after one of his shows. How could Steve do all of this, and then break it to Tony that he didn’t want to take the omega with him to Italy? It just didn’t make sense in his mind. Tony ran over the information too many times to count in his head, and each time came with the same confusion and sadness. The math didn’t add up. Steve plus acting like a proper alpha towards Tony equals dumping him before going to Italy. In what universe did that math ever work out?
Steve cleared his throat, as if that would make the omega stop and give him attention. Steve just figured growling at him probably wasn't the best way to request a little attention.
“It’s fine, I just… need to tough out my heat and focus on healing.” The brunet looked over at Peggy. “Who was that guy… the one that took me hostage?”
Steve was confused by the last sentence. He knew about such machines that kept people alive who were diagnosed with polio. If Tony had some how contracted that disease, Steve was going to feel even worse. The idea of leaving his omega and letting him get sick was just about the worst thing Steve could have imagined.
“I do actually,” she said, turning to him with the same smirk. “I might even, when this is all over, go dancing.”
“I really hate that, you know,” Tony said. “The whole caretaker thing… I don’t like that I’m required to have one. Why can’t I just be a free person?”
When May came around, Tony started busying himself with preparing for a heat. He hoped he wouldn’t be spending his birthday in heat, which he had all month to have it. Still, he was searching his home for some of the softest things. Blankets, pillows, sheets, clothes, anything he could get his hands on, he would take and put into his nest in his bedroom. Of course the shirts he had that still faintly smelled like Steve were saved for last; Tony not wanting Steve’s scent to get drowned out by other scents that weren’t as comforting.
“Fuck it,” Tony muttered before he climbed on top of the alpha and straddled him. Another moan escaped when he felt Steve’s cock brush against his thigh. “Oh god… alpha…”
"That's a great start to an idea for this mural," Steve said. "I'll start working on sketches as soon as I get home today."
Tony sighed and stood up, struggling a little with a grunt. He looked back at Steve just in time to see him shake hands with a man. He caught the end of the conversation.
“Unless that’s moving too fast for you,” Steve said gently, stopping Tony and putting a hand on the back of his head, looking into his eyes with an expression so soft that the omega whined again.
Steve flushed as he looked at the woman. “Thank you, I… I love being here, to be honest. I think this is the happiest I’ve been in a while, especially for Christmas. Getting to spend it with a family again is a blessing.”
Closing his eyes, Tony enjoyed the feeling of the cool air rushing over his skin as he and his mother drove down the road in their convertible. The sun was shining and the day wasn’t too cold or too warm. It felt perfect, which only made Tony feel better the longer they were on the road.
“Yes, Sir,” Steve replied loudly and forcefully. “I do.” He turned and walked out of the tent, Tony close behind and still clinging to his coat.
Peggy narrowed her eyes a little. “Well, he’s here at the hospital. He wanted to see you as well, but I think that can wait until tomorrow.”
Steve’s head whipped around to Tony quicker than the agents could blink, and before they realized what was happening, Tony was smirking and preparing for Steve to come barreling towards them.
Phillips eyed Peggy as she approached, taking a sip before speaking to the soldier sitting at a typewriter.
“Maybe your stomach just didn’t like your lunch today.” Maria smoothed back some of Tony’s hair. “It happens sometimes.”
!” Tony woke up, humming out soft moans of pleasure that confused his sleep-fogy mind until it caught up to what his body already knew.
“Good to meet you, too.” Bruce nodded, shrugging out of his jacket and hanging it on the coat rack by the door before moving over to sit down in the recliner, “Welcome to the craziness of our little circle of friends. Tony’s not the only energetic one that livens things up, you’ll find. My fiancé is just as loud.”
“You don’t know how badly I want that to be true,” the brunet said as he grabbed Steve’s hand and held it tight.
Tony’s August heat was, in fact, the best heat he had experienced since he and Steve began sharing heats. Finally being able to let loose, mostly, and not give a damn about the noises he made or the pleas he voiced to Steve, Tony enjoyed his heat for once, which rarely happened, even with his alpha being present. Having Steve return, however, seemed to have a pleasing effect that completely exempted the normal discomfort of heats. Tony was glad he didn’t have to worry about feeling uncomfortable when his mate was around.
Taking a shaky breath, Tony splashed some water on his face, staring at the drain his pills had gone down. “Fuck you, Dad,” he spat out before leaving the bathroom. He needed to find Steve. Steve would make him feel better.
“Tony, this isn’t what it looks like,” Steve tried, only to be shut down very quickly by the brunet.
Tony was once again back to where he was before. Anxiety kept him awake at night and panic attacks bombarded him throughout the days as he lay in his bed. If he ate anything at all, it wasn’t enough to keep up his energy or to support his baby. It was no longer a question of if, but when. Eventually, as the days passed by, everything built up to one cold night that Tony would regret for the rest of his life because of his failure to take care of himself due to the most traumatic event in his life.
Tony sighed and got up, swaggering over to the table and sitting on the edge of it next to Steve. “I’d happily be doing anything but sitting to the side and be told that I should leave all the work to the alphas and betas.”
A whiff of Steve’s scent caught Tony’s attention as he and his mother walked into the hangar. He didn’t catch more than a hint of the familiar scent, but he savored that scent that only Steve possessed, and Tony knew that Steve was there somewhere, probably smelling his omega’s scent and also looking around.
“The last surveillance flight is back. No sign of activity.” He turned to the solder at the typewriter with a sigh. “Go get a cup of coffee, corporal.”
Tony was going to have the whole nest soaked if he didn’t wake Steve up right that moment, but he just couldn’t bring himself to do it yet. His stomach growled from hunger and need, and both feelings were equally as intense. Tony really needed to eat before he was ready to take on Steve once more, but…
“It was merely a suggestion, dear. Though maybe not a bad idea.” Maria chuckled as she went back to eating her dinner.
“Unfortunately I can’t tell you that, but they both died on the same day in 1991.Both doing surprisingly well for their old age, but they were being escorted back to their home one night when the driver ran off the road and hit a tree. They were going fast… the impact killed all three passengers.”
Steve had his arms wrapped tightly around his omega, eyes shut just as tight as he smiled into Tony’s shoulder. He held the brunet up for several minutes, just hugging and scenting as needed, until Steve finally felt like Tony was thoroughly covered with his alpha scent again, and he allowed the omega to stand on his own feet once more. Only then did they finally share a kiss with each other, Tony pressing in close to Steve and sighing happily.
“Oh… of course,” Maria said as she stood back up, her hand lingering on her son before she pulled away. “We will…
Tony felt scared, in all honesty. He was scared Steve wasn’t going to make it back to him. He was scared an alpha might barge in and take advantage of him. He was scared their camp might be attacked in the middle of the night and he would be taken hostage. There were so many things on his mind that he found it impossible to sleep until he exhausted his body to the point of passing out.
“You kidding? I love Tony, we’re close friends and all, but he’s so loud during his heats, I can barely sleep with all that moaning!”
“Yup! Oh, except this one. The initial idea was one of my employees, but I helped refine it. Anyway, feel free to make reference sketches or whatever you need to do. I’ll be right over there working on an upgrade. Oh, and this is all interactive. You can move things around, enlarge them, whatever. Like this.” Tony said, showing Steve how to interact with the projections.
“You can do this,” she encouraged after Phillips was done speaking. “You’re brave just like all the other soldiers. You fight just like them.”
Ultimately, he found a pair of blue pajamas with black trim that felt like a cloud—or, rather what people imagine clouds to feel like based purely on visual contact. It’d be off-putting if clothing felt like damp air.
The ride back to the Stark manor was a long one, and Tony sat away from his parents in the car as they rode back. He wanted so badly to curl up in his bed and wake up from the nightmare he was having, but he knew the reality of the situation was that Steve was gone for good. Nothing could fill the emptiness he felt inside, not even the baby that belonged to Steve inside his belly. The pain was constant, and Tony felt like he would never get over losing the alpha he had loved so dearly.
The brunet sat in silence, his anger rising once more. "Steve, we're at a point in our lives where alphas and omegas are settled down and not playing around anymore. We're both 25 years old. Others our age would already be married and have kids. If you want to behave like you're 16 again and play around with other partners, let me know, because I don't want to be in this relationship anymore if that's the case."
“Oh yeah? That’s great! I mean, not that your friend lost an arm, that’s horrible, but it’s great to have that confirmation that veterans in need are getting the Stark tech I donate to help make their lives a little better after all that stuff overseas beats them down. I still get a lot of backlash for closing Stark Industries' weapons department in order to open the medical tech department. I just want to help make the world a better place but so many people think I’m just too soft. Uncle Obie—uh, not my real uncle, he just was always like an uncle to me as a kid—he’s not happy with my changes to the company. I know he’s just worried but it wears me down when he keeps bringing up wanting to reopen the weapons department, you know? So it’s nice to hear that my changes are out there helping people.”
In one swift move, Bucky pulled Clint closer and picked him up, carrying the omega princess style all the way to his room. The door was locked behind him, the omega’s things completely forgotten in the hallway just in front of the elevator.
Steve held his breath. It had been so long, and he was afraid of what he’d see in that room. Tony barely alive and trapped in an iron lung that was keeping him alive? Tony as an old man hooked up to life support and as frail as a piece of paper? So many possibilities ran through his head, but not one of them was even close to  what Steve was about to see, the condition his lovely omega was in after over sixty years of being apart.
The omega nodded with a smile, opening the door further so his mother could enter. “I’m almost done getting ready.”
“Nope, I’m just a hopeless omega with a weak heart and a dead unborn baby, apparently.” Tony muttered into his mostly empty glass. He tipped it back, draining the rest before setting the glass down a little too hard on the counter, his knuckles white as they gripped the now empty glass. “Bastard never lets me forget that pain. Loves to remind me.”
Steve smiled and pulled back slightly, lifting Tony’s head. “Let’s get back to the hotel. You can take a shower and eat and rest. If your burgers aren’t soggy. Your stupid alpha would like to make up for the mistake he made today.”
When the nest was finished and Tony was in it, practically inviting Steve to get in, the alpha carefully stepped into the nest and settled down next to Tony, a smile on his face. "Now this is more what I'd call a date."
Turning her head, Peggy, raised an eyebrow. “Are you sure? It can’t wait until we get back to London?”
Tony shrugged. “We’ve made up now. We had a hell of a reunion when he came back from the mission that kept him over Christmas. I swear, we’re never going to get to spend the holidays together if the missions keep coming.”
It didn’t take long before the elevator opened again and the click of heels approached Steve. The CEO of the company smiled and held out a professional hand in greeting. “Mr. Rogers, so good of you to come all this way.”
Cautiously, and also speaking calmly to her son, Maria pulled back the ruined sheets, blankets, and shirts, gasping at how red everything was. “Oh, my poor baby… It’s bad, Howard.”
Oh, how Tony had come to loathe that voice. The voice of his father, fuming mad and face bright red to accompany the unnecessary volume that was only drawing more attention to the young omega. Honestly, Tony wished he could turn invisible and just not deal with his father’s wrath, but he was the one who had left only a note for the old man. He had made his decision, and now he had to live with the consequences. Tony felt very small in that moment, walking up to his father with his eyes trained on the floor. He halfway expected to get a slap across the face for what he did, and that would cause a confrontation between his father and all the Howling Commandos that would result in a lot of costly damages.
“These men more than most,” Peggy said, turning to look back at the two. “Schmidt sent out a force to Azzano. Two-hundred men went up against him, and less that fifty returned.”
“We’re getting out of here,” she replied with a sparkle in her eye. “And we’re getting dressed up to do it.”
“Yeah. most are just fun things for myself in this lab. I keep most of my Stark Industries work in the development lab where my employed engineers can do their part more easily. But I can bring up the files in here where it’s less likely that we’d end up in the way of hard workers.
"I suppose I could have one drink with you." The blond smiled as he wrapped an arm around Tony's waist and led him over to the bartender. "What are you feeling tonight?"
Tony sighed and nuzzled Steve's arm lightly. Since their A&W date, the two had explored their relationship a bit. Really they were still in their courting phase, but Tony felt like that was coming to a close, especially since his next heat was due so soon. Steve might be willing to join Tony for their first heat together. Sighing Tony turned his head and pressed a small kiss to Steve's shoulder, looking down at what the alpha had drawn.
“I doubt you’ll be telling me to stop any time soon.” Underneath the table, Steve pushed a leg forward and ran it up one of Tony’s.
“We won’t send any agents to watch over you either,” Fury added as they walked out of the room, slowly so Tony could walk on his own. “I think the captain can handle anything this city throws at him. He did throw some of our agents through a wall, after all.”
“Good boy.” Bucky smiled and pat Tony’s head. “And by the way, make sure you keep a neutral expression next time you fantasize about your alpha. It’s distracting otherwise.”
Pulling the alpha out of the room, Tony smiled wider. “Come on, let’s put up decorations today. We’ve got a lot of house to cover.”
“I… I f-found him on the floor… He was unconscious. I tried to help him as best I could… I don’t know if it worked.” Howard swallowed and closed his eyes, feeling a little woozy.
“Tony, do not go forgetting you’ve torn my TV apart and leave it like that.” James groaned. “God, you got wires spilling out the back like you gutted the thing!”
Bringing in the new year didn’t go exactly like the two had wanted, but they did manage to sneak out close to midnight and hear Big Ben strike midnight while they watched fireworks light up the sky. Both had stars in their eyes as they watched, smiles on their faces and light spirits as 1944 finally arrived and hopefully made a promise that the war would end soon.
“I guess I’ll be the only little guy again. That’s how it usually ends up. Have friends who are betas and are little guys, then they grow up and get big. Not as big as you… you got huge.” Tony cleared his throat and looked down at Steve’s hands. “What do you have?”
Tony’s eyes were wide as he averted his gaze, not wanting to see what he had dreaded. He was going to be sick if he saw even one drop of the blood that soaked through every bit of fabric around him. Thankfully, Maria and Howard did their best to comfort him and clean him up. There was no way Tony was going to feel comfortable for a long while, though. After everything he had gone through in such a short amount of time, it was a miracle he was still able to show any sign of emotion.
The skies seemed to only darken as rain rolled in and poured on the disappointing day. Tony hardly came out of his room, angry and upset at the room smelling so strongly of Steve, and yet the alpha was no longer there. The scent was comforting, of course, but it would never be as good as if the alpha were physically there to keep the scent strong. The day dragged on, and Tony only became more and more upset. He didn’t come out for meals, only leaving his room for water when he felt like he needed it, never wanting it.
Tony felt odd. Something wasn’t right, and he quickly discovered that something that didn’t feel right, that put a sour feeling in the pit of his stomach. As soon as he located the source of the woman’s voice, his heart sank. There in the corner of the office he had approached, a blonde private was kissing Steve right on the lips, and to Tony’s horror, Steve was kissing back. In a moment of panic, he suddenly felt his anger rise.
Steve acted quickly, knowing Tony was just as impatient as he was. Protection was important though, especially when the war was still raging and neither of them were currently home. Even accidentally having a baby wasn't an option for them. Maybe eventually when they could get a place together and Steve had a stable job, with Tony eventually helping his father at Stark Industries, they could have a family and live a normal life.
Pulling away from his mother, Tony wiped his eyes and looked over at Jarvis. “Help me get packed, and then take me to the military base. My alpha needs me.”
“I don’t need an alpha anyways, because I’m going to make my own way into the world as soon as I can get away from you and your restricting house rules!” Tony cried out as he tried to be intimidating, leaning forward aggressively at his father.
“You can cuddle up with him later, right now we need to get our asses in gear and head to the hangar!” The woman huffed as she kept pulling Tony along, just in case he got the idea to run to Steve without warning. “Hangar now, alpha later!”
Tony twirled around a pole, the spotlights of the stage catching the glitter on his bared skin, and then he gracefully placed himself back on the stage floor, stepping away from the pole to make some rounds close to the edge of the stage and give the drunken alphas a closer view of what they lusted for. However, out the corner of his eye he spotted his friend and fellow dancer making his way over to him from backstage, and he paused to meet the blond, hooking one leg over the other’s hip and pressing close as he slid his hands along his chest. Alphas loved omega on omega action, so it made for a good way to share information during a performance.
Tony’s heart continued to break as his alpha turned and walked over to him. He saw how Steve’s jaw was tense, and he immediately stopped struggling against his mother, waiting for Steve to come to him and tell him directly that he had to stay home.
Howard moved too fast for Tony to keep up. It was seconds before they ended up in the bathroom, Tony trying desperately to get his pills back. Howard shoved him away roughly, making him fall to the floor, and then Tony watched in horror as the pills went down the drain of the sink, his father washing them down quickly. Just like that, the brief bit of freedom he had experienced had been taken from him. He felt like his legs were going to collapse underneath him if he tried to stand up.
“Relax,” the omega said with a laugh. “I made sure to decline their offers, and besides, I never went out in public alone. I was either with my mom or Jarvis.”
Tony whined and reached his arms out, wanting to touch Steve and feel those muscles move. He wanted Steve to just crawl onto him and go to town more, but he would settle for touching, getting in a bit of foreplay before really getting things heated. This was, after all their first time together. It was a rather special and important time.
Moaning, the omega buried his face in the pillows he had been given. They didn’t smell like Steve, which he hated, but if he could just get one of the alpha’s shirts and put it over one of the pillows…
"You don't understand, he's the man I love the most, I can't bear to know if he never got to see me again. I… I don't even know how I got here. How am I still alive?"
“I’d love to, Captain.” Tony smiled as they headed inside the restaurant. He dared to lean in close to the alpha, sticking to his side to make it clear he was taken at least for the night.
The butler shook his head as they headed to the parlor, and he exchanged looks with Maria once they entered the room, the woman looking just as devastated as Jarvis did.
"I know, but I'm pretty sure neither of us are prepared for the consequences of not using protection. Do you have any with you?"
Another moan came from Tony’s lips, the brunet shifting to move his hips against his alpha’s. He’d be lying if he were to say he wasn’t ready for Steve to take him during his next heat already. It wasn’t too far off anyways, and his August heat had been such a rush that he was glad Steve had been smart enough to remember protection.
It pained Tony to see his alpha in such distress. Though his stomach churned with a mix of anxiousness and morning sickness, he wanted to be the strong rock that Steve could depend on in rough times, in times where it seemed too hard to keep on living, times where the whole world came crashing down in mere minutes. Tony hated seeing Steve this way, but he had to stay strong for his alpha.
Steve nodded with a hum. “I’m sure our boys over in Europe will do their job. I’ve got a friend over there right now, James Barnes. We’ve been best friends since we were kids basically. He went off to war before I even knew about the serum. I made him promise not to win the war before I got there…”
“Mom, did you not just hear the doctor?! I’m pregnant! How the hell am I supposed to handle being pregnant without Steve around?!” Tony, shuffled off his bed and clutched the shirt he was wearing. It was one of Steve’s but it no longer smelled like the alpha.
Steve chuckled as he stepped inside. “Sorry, I guess I’m not such a little guy anymore. If it makes you feel any better, I’m not sure I like this transformation quite yet.”
Steve chuckled. "Should you show them here? Or down in your lab? I want an authentic experience to get the most inspiration."
Tony inwardly screamed. Steve got him a fucking Christmas present. God, this alpha was getting on Tony’s nerves really fast.
At long last the sun began to rise on the third day of Steve being missing, the crisp morning air accompanied by fog surrounding the forest. Peggy was up and about by the time most other soldiers were grabbing breakfast. She headed to the main tent, where Colonel Phillips was busy sipping on a cup of coffee.
"I'm sorry to interrupt," Peggy's voice called from just outside the room. "But I've just contacted Howard Stark. He's meeting us at the landing strip soon. All three of us."
Steve nodded. “Sometimes, yeah. I find myself actually liking music from the 40’s and 50’s more than most modern stuff.”
“Well, when I own the building, it’s easy for me to make sure I have my own personal lab...and penthouse.” Tony grinned, walking around a table and patting a robotic arm with a claw that  opened and closed at him in a surprisingly affectionate way. “Yes, yes, Daddy’s back. He brought a friend.” he then turned to pet another robotic arm that had a fire extinguisher, “I know he’s hot but no douching Daddy’s friend unless he’s actually on fire.”
Tony looked skeptical, but he did as he was told, taking the pants and moving behind the changing screen in the opposite corner of the room. He wasn’t a huge fan of high rising pants, especially if they were tight in the groin area. It usually led to a general discomfort, for obvious reasons. These pants were comfortable, however, which surprised Tony. He figured it made sense, since Peggy was a bit taller than him. They seemed to emphasize his hips, which wasn’t how he usually dressed, but if he was going to visit Steve at the bar, he had to look his very best. Ditching his usual style and emphasizing his hips was a sacrifice he was willing to make.
Steve’s movements slowed a little as he remembered his promise to not bite yet, but as soon as that thought was in his mind, it was gone, and he was back to the intense pace he had set. No single thought was going to prevent him from making sure his omega felt needed and satisfied.
“I thought it was just my body reacting to my alpha leaving me!” Tony’s voice rose before his watery eyes leaking their tears down his face.
"Well there won't be any diet restrictions for both if you from now on," Steve said. "You can eat anything you like."
"Welcome to SHIELD, Captain," Fury announced. "We're still working out some things, but thanks to Margaret Carter, we're a lot further along than we would have been."
“I think the legs are a bit long,” Tony said as he came out from behind the screen, tossing his suspenders onto the bed.
Howard’s eyes got wider, and he turned on his heels and made a beeline for the bathroom. “You don’t deserve these if you really think these give you freedom.”
"We want to go to a clothing store or something similar," Steve said while getting in. "Wanted to get some pajamas to change into when we get back to Tony's place."
Once breakfast was finished, it was time for presents, and Steve for one couldn’t wait to give Tony his present. It wasn’t much in terms of what maybe the Starks could afford, but Steve thought it held a lot of meaning, so he was sure Tony was going to love it.
February first was a day that Tony hoped he didn’t have to see come so soon. It began like any other day; waking up, going to the bathroom, foraging for breakfast while deciding what to wear for the day. Tony was in the middle of his breakfast when the main phone line rang in the manor. He thought nothing of it until Jarvis came into the kitchen where Tony was eating.
When his name was called, Tony suddenly got a flood of nerves rush through him, making the other omegas in the room react at the change in his scent. He was amazed, actually amazed, at the positive support he received back. There wasn’t a single omega in that waiting room that reacted negatively to his nerves. They all understood what he was going through, to a point, and they knew he was nervous. Tony nearly cried when the room filled with a sweet, supportive scent as he walked to the back with his mother.
“Well, it’s a work in progress. Some members of the board just don’t want to let go of how things ran before I started making changes, and they fight me at every turn. It’s exhausting.”
“I’ve been waiting for two weeks to see you again, of course I’m eager.” Smirking, the omega sank to his knees and nuzzled Steve’s crotch teasingly.
"Doesn't feel like it some days." Steve set down his pencil, looking down at Tony. "At least I'm not back in a lab, sitting while scientists take samples of my blood all day long."
“Tony,” the doctor said in a gentle tone. “We’d have to take you in for a test to be one-hundred percent sure, but I’m pretty positive that you’re around two months pregnant.”
“Don’t worry, I’m leaving again,” the agent said after dropping Steve’s bags next to the cot. “I will let you know if Steve comes back before your heat is over, I promise.”
suspicious. Thankfully they weren’t caught, and no one questioned anything, even if they did know the truth. No one was going to spread gossip about Captain America, especially not in the middle of the war. There were more important things to focus on than if the captain was sleeping with an omega with the Stark name.
“We’ll keep watch over Tony here for a while, just so he strengthens up and can walk on his own again, then we’ll send you all back home,” the doctor said before leaving the family once more.
“If you acted as fast as you say you did, he has the chance. But it will take him time to wake up. We should get him to a hospital so he can be watched more carefully, just in case he takes a turn for the worst.”
The blond looked down at the box in his hands. “Oh, I just brought some candy. I figured Peggy was going to try to feed you right while you healed, so I smuggled this in for you.”
“They’re 30 miles behind the lines, through some of the most heavily fortified territory in Europe,” Phillips interrupted. “We’d lose more men than we’d save, but I don’t expect you to understand that because you’re a chorus girl.”
“Should have grabbed my coat before we left,” Tony grumbled, letting Peggy go ahead of him and lead him to her apartment. “I hope what you’re planning on having me wear is warm.”
The cramping only got worse as the minutes ticked by. Tony was screaming in pain and anguish, tears rolling down his face. He wanted to get up and get help, but he was so weak that he couldn’t move a muscle. He had to lay in his bed and suffer and hope someone could hear his screams. Otherwise, he would be found in the morning covered in blood and sobbing at yet another loss.
When they arrived back home, Tony took time to walk around the manor and take in his home one last time. The elegance of the whole manor was a lot to take in, but Tony knew every inch of it by heart. The carved railings on the grand staircase, the lovely piano in the parlor, the way the kitchen was always illuminated by natural light, it all held fond memories for the omega, and by the time he ended his walk in the parlor, he was nearly sobbing.
Tony cried a lot in his recovery. Nobody blamed him, especially after all he had gone through. Several times he kept blaming himself for everything that happened, and then he’d go right back to crying and apologizing to someone about all the hatred he had in his head while he recovered. It wasn’t like him to be so upset, but after losing the love of his life and losing the child that was the product of their love, he had every right to feel whatever emotion came his way.
Also also! We're only two chapters away from the end of this fic! Chapter 15 is officially the end, but there's a surprise chapter after that ;)
Long into talking of the future, Tony curled up against Steve with a smile and silently fell asleep, feeling like he was fitting into a role he never thought he’d ever want to fall into.
Another round of tears sent Tony nearly wailing for his alpha, having the thought that the baby was like Steve’s last Christmas gift to Tony, and that seemed to break the omega’s heart even more. How could he even go on living like this? Being without his alpha for the rest of his life just didn’t sound enjoyable at all. Sure, maybe he would get lucky and settle with another alpha in the future, but no one could replace Steve. That alpha had been one of a kind, the only one in the world to have ever been born a beta and be turned into the alpha he had so easily become. It was like Steve had been destined to be an alpha all along, and had he not been an alpha, Tony probably would have dated Steve a little, but he didn’t know if he would have gone as far as he had with alpha Steve.
The worried mother sighed, looking out the window behind Howard’s desk a moment, “...Tony’s pregnant, Howard. He didn’t just lose his alpha…”
Tony’s heart raced in his chest. No, there was no way Steve was actually suggesting this. Not after being so nice with him while on tour, not with him literally asking to go on a date while they were in the parking lot. Steve was saying he wanted to leave Tony in the United States while he went over to entertain other alphas that needed a pick-me-up. Not that there was anything wrong with the performing, but Steve was
“We didn’t take into account that the procedure would turn Steve into an alpha, or that it would have an affect on you to suddenly have a fresh alpha scent fill the air.”
Tony kicked off the boots he had thrown on and not tied. His stomach flipped in anticipation, flinching at the light touches Steve gave him. When the alpha pulled down his pants, he tipped his head back a moaned, the cooler air making him shiver. He swallowed and looked up at Steve with wide, eager eyes.
“Definitely not. Steve wasn’t the kind of alpha who would risk something so precious. Our son, however...he gets ideas in his head and doesn’t think it all through, sometimes. I wish Steve had known so he could have been that chime of reason in Tony’s head.”
“We would prefer not to have spoiled tiny Tony show up before Steve has a chance to get used to normal spoiled Tony,” Bruce said with a smile.
There was a knock on Tony’s bedroom door, and all he could manage to do in response was make a pitiful noise as he curled up on his side and waited for whoever was on the other side of the door to just go away or stop wasting time and enter. His mood instantly changed when he realized it was his mother who had stepped into his room, and he immediately burst into tears.
Tony nodded. “He also doesn’t like the fancy clothes all the time. I told him that Steve didn’t really get to see me dolled up that often, and the only thing he’s really seen me in that’s extravagant is the suit that Peggy gave me.”
“Yes Steve, please, Steve.” Tony shifted so that he rubbed up against Steve’s cock, “Let me feel you, you sexy beast.”
"I saw the truth behind Hydra's motives. They converted me from the false patriotism I acted under. Captain America is dead."
“Not what I’d do with it, but I respect your choice.” Steve wrapped an arm around Tony’s shoulders and leaned his head against the brunet’s.
“No, Tony! If you depend on these for your freedom, then you’ll just end up putting yourself into a downward spiral towards disappointment.”
They eventually pulled into the parking lot of the A&W, the music cutting off when Steve turned the car off. He hurried out and around the car before Tony had a chance to unbuckle his seatbelt, and Tony had to admit that he blushed a little when the alpha opened up the door for him.
“But what if I am?” Steve asked playfully with a smirk. “Maybe I’ll teach you not to say something so offensive next time.”
Howard sighed as he locked up the apartment the two of them were staying in. “Tonight you need to get some rest.”
“Oh, I expect your place to be cluttered with paint stuff. It’s fine.” Tony shrugged, “And eh, I use a little side room off my lab to sleep most of the time, so my penthouse isn’t as soaked in my scent as you’d think.”
“If this is a family matter, then it concerns me,” Steve said. “Tony wants to fight, so let him. He’s not a child anymore. He can make his own decisions, omega or not.”
“I think that might make things worse to be honest.” The omega shook his head. “I almost feel like I shouldn’t have left him a note, but that was probably better than letting him figure it out on his own where I went.”
Tony had relaxed slightly when Steve had slowed for all of ten seconds, so he cried out in surprise when the alpha picked up speed again, and in the depths of his belly he could feel his climax build up. He was close, dangerously close already, he realized, but he was trying to hold on as long as he could. Yeah, they had his whole heat to go for longer, but Tony wasn’t ready to stop yet. He wanted more of his alpha, wanted to feel just how far Steve was willing to go to satisfy his omega.
“I don’t do that often… I just like to look around, see what I can work with since my dad doesn’t really let me work on anything with him, even though I’ve asked him several times.”
Tony caught just the smallest hint of Steve’s scent as he walked in, and briefly he thought that the alpha might be home already, but the scent was dead and fading, and Tony sighed sadly. He hoped that soon he would be able to be with Steve again soon.
Phillips looked down at the paper he was signing, then sighed and picked it up, carrying it with him as he stepped away from his desk. “I signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count… but the name does sound familiar. I’m sorry.”
Whining, Tony gripped Peggy’s coat sleeve as tight as he could while looking up at his alpha, who stood up at the front of the car and balanced himself. It felt like a long moment before Steve bent his legs and launched himself at the plane with a grunt, and then the car was screeching to a halt as fast as Phillips could make it stop. The car spun to the side as the plane flew forward, taking Steve with it, which made Tony whine even more. He even cried out as the car’s tires squealed against the pavement, smoke flying away from the rubber as the end of the runway grew closer and closer. Tony didn’t know why he screamed. He had been strong up until that point, but for some reason, the fear of falling off a cliff and the fear of losing Steve for good were stronger than his will to keep fighting.
“Fuck you’re huge. Totally not overcompensating for anything with your giant arms…” he moaned and closed his eyes, “This size natural or was it that serum stuff you claimed to have been given? Because any omega would beg for a cock like this one...shit.”
“Oh fuck! Alpha!” Tony cried out with another rush of slick, gripping the sheets and shirts when he felt Steve push against his hole, and then slide the tip of his cock inside.
"Yes, because I don't think Captain Rogers will be safe around Tony for a while," Peggy commented, shaking her head.
“Sure, and I’m just another omega that got claimed by an alpha that doesn’t care. Sure as hell following the stereotype, aren’t I?” Tony huffed and turned to leave, heading towards his father’s lab.
“Everyone is staring at me…” Tony tried to make himself look smaller, though he kept his gaze on his alpha, who made him flush by complimenting him so much. The omega thought his heart might burst in his chest.
“So that should be the very last one. The last head to destroy? Or the body I guess. However that story of the hydra goes.”
They danced to the music through a few songs, simply enjoying their time together and ignoring everyone around them. It was nice, and the first event Tony’s had to go to that he wasn’t already a little more than buzzed. Maybe part of his drinking problem had more to do with boredom than he originally thought. He knew a good part of it was a way to cope with stress or to escape from emotions, but Steve was making it easier on him to not drink too much, just by being at his side.
Steve's intense blue eyes looked up from Tony's ass, and he lifted his head with a smile. "Good morning, doll."
“Why? Afraid the one who’s going to give you grandkids and continue the bloodline is gonna turn up dead one day and leave you without anyone to continue the family with?”
The grandfather clock in the parlor finally stuck midnight, and Maria finished her song with the beginning of the chimes.
Yawning, he stumbled out of bed and moved at a much slower pace, over to the bathroom to empty his bladder. He then cleaned himself up with a shower and put on fresh clothes before leaving his room. His stomach growled right as he went through the door, and briefly he panicked before realizing that he was just hungry and not about to throw up again.
Tony whined happily, “No takes-backsies. I get your knot for at least an hour now! It’s mine to sit on!” he said, wiggling so that it tugged at his overly sensitive entrance, successfully drawing a whine from himself.
“Don’t be sorry, Tony,” Steve said, his tone softer than before. “I know you don’t like being kept at the base here in London. But… I mean, you’ll need training in firearms and battle tactics. It’s a lot to go over in just over a month. Plus you need to make your suit too.”
When they arrived at Steve’s apartment, Tony took a deep breath, taking in the look and smell of the alpha’s temporary home. Everything about it felt safe, smelled safe, and Tony felt the best he had all day. He stood to the side as Steve and Bucky brought his things in, keeping the things that weren’t clothes, nesting supplies, or toiletries in the front room so they were ready to go when Tony would be leaving. Tony was relieved when Bucky bid farewell and left the couple alone in the apartment.
“Well, we don’t have time for me to sit on your knot this morning. You’re not a quick-releaser.” Tony rolled over onto his back and looked up at Steve, taking in how he looked with his lower face covered in slick, “You have a bill to pay and I have some packing to do.”
“The headquarters,” Tony said as he looked over the papers with his alpha. “We have the exact location of the headquarters.”
“Pretty sure he’s not starving. Pepper commissioned him for the mural in the main lobby of the tower. That’s how we first met, and I’ll have you know, I made the first move.” Tony huffed.
Most omegas found Steve very attractive, desirable even. He was the perfect alpha image. Tall, built, blond and blue eyed, Steve was a hell of an alpha specimen. Just walking by a group of omegas would reward him with sighs and moans and dreamy looks.
Tony’s vision got spotty as his breath started to catch in his throat, feeling lightheaded as his stomach twisted in anticipation. There was little warning when his orgasm suddenly hit him, a strangled sounding cry leaving his mouth as Steve thrust inside as deep as he could, growling loudly in the omega’s ear. There were only a few more thrusts before Steve’s knot caught on Tony’s entrance, locking them together while the alpha also suddenly hit his climax. Tony was caught off guard in the middle of his own orgasm by Steve reaching his, and that moment held too much intensity for the helpless omega, his vision going black as he passed out.
When the metal casing was sterilized and transferred to the hole in Tony’s chest, Howard took a few seconds to breathe and refocus, taking materials from the first aid kit Tony had carried as a soldier and doing his best to sew up the open skin around the casing until he was sure the casing wasn’t going to go anywhere. It was embedded almost as deep as the shrapnel was, and Howard hoped that was enough to hold the reactor in place.
“On top of my price you’ll have a charge on your bill for renting a room.” the omega added as he punched in a code to unlock a door.
In only a couple more days, the base was bustling with activity and the Howling Commandos roaming about until they weren’t needed and retired to the nearest bar, drinking to their heart’s content and putting it all on Steve’s tab. Typically Steve and Tony would have joined them for drinks, but instead they had a date planned, finally a date to make up for the one they lost when Steve had put a little roadblock in their relationship.
“Thanks for saving me at all. I… I thought I was done for, honestly. Especially when that guy tossed me into the water and I hit my head.” Tony shifted his head to the side a little. “How long was I out for?”
Steve nodded, sliding into the car. "Hydra wants to make omegas equal to alphas. Our new world order has this as one of our top priorities."
“Ah, see, he doesn’t need a dance with me for that, not to mention that my dear Pepper should be in on any such conversation as she handles a lot of that kind of thing for me. Why don’t you direct him her way and I can finish up my dance with Steve and not have to get close to the guy.”
Tony laughed, “You expect me to believe you were alive and fighting Nazis back in the forties? Never had an alpha boast he was nearing a hundred before in order to try and get in my pants. Come on, you’re obviously in your twenties—maybe early thirties.”
