Steve’s face softens again, and he replies back, “I love you too.”
“Don’t speak of these impossible things,” she says, just as lowly as she had that night.  “Do not talk about fantastical things like aliens and time travel. I’m going to throw out all those comics of yours.  I won’t stand for it. I won’t listen to it!”
"Hey," he says.
They had been the person they tried to stick spaghetti against when talking about idea.  They had had so many discussions on theoretical concepts like time travel, alternate seminarians.  The never ending rants about magic.  There had been discussion about the future they wanted to craft.  The lives they wanted to live.  Secrets, dreams, wishes poured out from their hearts.
"No," Tony bites out. It's rushed, a bit too quick, but Vision tilts his head in a manner that is so very him that Tony can finally breathe. "No," he adds. "Vision come back to the Tower. It's your birthplace after all."
Almost against his will, his eyes close, and the grip on his fingers stays with him until he opens them again.
Tony wonders about that for a long time.
Then the morphine hits again, and Tony goes fuzzy enough around the edges it’s hard to even think about what they are talking about.
He’s been hiding it.  Or maybe the sentient stone in his head has been hiding it from him, but there is something deeply wrong with him.  There has been for a long time. For years, if he thinks clearly about it
Tony’s lips twist but bites back the need to say,
"End this," he says to Strange. To Wanda.
“It’s okay, “ Peggy says, trying to calm everyone.  Maria looks ready to ask questions Tony won’t answer, and Tony looks at her, daring her to ask.  “We don’t need to know any more. We know enough to solve the problem.”
Tony scans the room for anything else. There is still a grocery list on a legal pad in Wanda's looping script that he has to pick up and wipe under. There are doodles in the margin that Tony skims over.
Steve tightens his grip on his arm to keep him going down memory lane, where Tony would sit in the lab in the tower and skim through designs lazily as Steve watched, just like this.  They were completely comfortable being in each’s other’s spaces, but now - they can’t be in the same room without this heavy tension eating between them and everyone else.
(Steve will say,
“Well duh,” Sam calls in the back. “We can see that beautiful mind. But care to explain to people who don’t speak spider webs?”
“No,” Tony says as he takes off the tie and suit jacket, throwing them over the table littered with tools.  “Give me five minutes to myself before those mother hens descend.”  He drops into a chair before the monitors.  FRIDAY pulls up CNN, Fox, and a few others.  They are all chatting about the UN meeting, but there is a sixth monitor that shows a live satellite feed from Wakanda.
“JARVIS?” Tony says aloud onto the echoing silence of the room.
solve.
It rings true.
They just exist in ever circling orbits that sometimes intersect, day in and day out.
"In a minute," Tony replies and trudges to the opening, shield in hand. The HUD's vision is slightly greyed out around the edges, and the battery percentage is down to 18%. "Whelp this is going to suck. Time to play catch baby girl." He just steps out.
They stay there on that couch, like they had for multiple afternoons before this moment and after. Quiet in each other’s presence. Steady.
“Chatter,” Steve reminds them, almost absent-mindedly, and Tony is struck with a sense of fondness instead of annoyance, memories of before bubbling up before he has to push them back down with a sharp,
Tony pulls back and slides his hand up until he reaches the soft hair on the back of Steve's head.  “You sentimental old fool," he whispers.
Steve paints, instead.
“Be a kept woman?” Tony laughs.  “What would the gossip blogs say?”
“I can’t drown it out,” Tony says, grasping at straws in his own mind, pain ridden and gone.  More than gone.  Rhodey is there beside him, he has to remind himself.  “What do you mean Tones?  What are you talking about?”
Something’s about to happen here.
“I know the feeling,” Tony says, ironically.  He fidgets and puts his hands in his pockets. “God it’s like I forgot how to be around you in the two years, even though I didn’t do that when I was sort of comatose and half dead for 300 years in ice.”
Tony shakes himself a little, before shrugging. "Can't make anything worse."
And Tony will look at him with a familiarity like he wonders the same thing sometimes before reaching out and reeling him in for a kiss.
“Tony,” Steve starts.  “I can’t -”
Of course.
Steve slumps until his face is against Tony’s chest, but Tony can’t keep from laughing, so he rattles them both.  “I love you,” Steve sighs.
"As I was saying," he continues. "The Avengers will be taking a step back as the UN continues to evaluate the current rules and regulations around the Accords after the incident in Germany and the whole Winter Soldier," he waves his hand, "situation."
Tony finishes the device one morning, too early. Steve's up though. He's up early often, contemplating the light and drinking a smoothie, while he shifts through images in his head.
Tony tenses, ready to shove the chair down to get across the room to the bars when his gaze snaps upwards to catch a glimpse of Rhodey waving his hand in his face. There is a wicked grin across his lips as Rhodey lets go of the bars. Tony, half sitting half standing, lands in the chair with an audible thump. Rhodey's steps are smooth as he moves. There is no hesitation during his move from the bars to the couch beside Tony's borrowed chair.
They both smile at each other before looking at out to the city.  It’s a clear night - a good night.  The world is safe.  They are all together in the same building for the first time in a while and no one is yelling about coffee grounds or Accords or anything.
“Yes boss.”
She thrives, even when her gaze goes distant for hours at a time. She offers to bring him in. That his face and his planning capabilities would be useful, good even, with this.
“He was dying?” Peter squeaks.  “Is this why rule number one exists?”
Steve hands over his sketchbook. Tony holds it carefully for a moment before he begins to look through it. Through the pencil drawings of Tony working in the lab, laughing with Natasha, arm wrapped around the kid. Through detailed sketches of oil stained hands, poised on keyboards. The ever shifting shape of the arc reactor. Through the lines he has accumulated. The way he looks at Pepper. The way he looks at Rhodey.
before he tries and begins to fight the stone, turning incrementally. Thanos’ eyes widen for a moment before they sharpen.  He tightens his fist, and Tony’s scream nearly covers the rolling thunder. “You’re going to die,” Thanos assures him. “And it will be painful.”
The second sheet comes off, and his mother looks like she’s asleep except for the dull bruise under her throat. The lines of her face look starker in the morgue’s light. She is still when he is so used to her in motion.
“You have the Time stone,” Strange smiles, ruefully, “Of course it wants to take its own opportunities to play with it’s nature.”
He looks back at Clint, who is looking at Natasha with a face of someone on the edge of something and grins quietly down to Tony’s face.
Tony’s used to being used and thrown away.
Not replying, Tony finds an open spot close and then goes downwards.  He moves his feet out of the way and sets the two down a little roughly before looking to Vision.  Wanda has her hands out, palms hovering above his head, and her eyes are glowing redder than he has seen before.  He opens his mouth, almost tells her it’s worthless, and he’s dead, and she needs to turn back to the battle before she’s dead too. But her mouth is moving, and Friday puts the text on the screen, carefully silent.
Daniel’s fierce in his response, “You’ve done nothing Tony.”  He sits down on the edge of the coffee table and leans in, until their foreheads almost touch.  “None of this has to do with you,” he says quietly. “We’re tired and fighting against the clock.  Maria doesn’t mean to take it out on you, but she’s frightened and scared and wants to make sure you’re safe.”
and a chasm of grief reopens in him, crashing over him and trying to pull him back into it’s whirlpool.  The watch beeps.
Tony knows this face too well.  The one from the days of the endless SHIELD missions.  The one from across an airport. Tony’s seen it too many times to not know it intimately.
"You sure?" Tony asks for the millionth time that night as they stand in the lab and Steve finishes a painting of the compound in the early days, one of Tony's outrageous cars out front.
It hurts to think about that, and he closes his eyes, hoping that will push the lump in his throat back down. He falls back asleep, blanket clutched tightly between his fists thinking,
Holy shit that looks 100%
Tony’s groggy when he comes to, and his right side doesn’t hurt - at all.  It’s a startling difference.  “You should have come to me,” he hears, and then groans.
“It’s really not,” Tony grunts as he dips in and grabs the shield, zig-zagging in the sky hard, trying to shake it off the shield.  When that doesn’t work, he goes up in a straight line, hoping the lack of oxygen does the Skrull in, but it clings onto it tightly. Tony continues to climb, watches as the display tells him he has less and less oxygen, feels himself go lightheaded, and misses the display telling him the power in the suit is failing.
Steve turns the door and the first person squawks before Steve can elbow him to the face and the second scientist runs at a table and clicks a button.
Don't think he has forgiven anyone babycakes.  No one is forgiven.  Tony just wants to be a human again and not a depressed lump.  (also everyone loves him but Tony is great at not seeing other people's positive emotions about himself.)
He takes in the shell shocked faces before adding on, "Oh look, there is my cue card to say time's up. It's been a pleasure, and any additional questions can go to my PA in the corner over there. Wave at the hungry mob of reporters Jonah. Don't break the poor guy people, he's new, and I would like him to last more than a few weeks."
Steve winces, but stays where he is, watching Tony. It’s all the confirmation Tony needs.
He stares up at the ceiling and wonders how much longer he has to be down here. Pretending before he heads down and works on Mark 17, the new tablet specs that R&D sent up that are clearly shit based on the prototype he was using, and there is some paperwork Pepper had expedited over, a team of lawyers he has a conference all with in a few hours to check on the Accords strategy, and maybe some tinkering on a few ideas Peter has sent him an email about.
Tony pauses, thinking about the red tinged vision Wanda had put in his head.  “What about…” He trails off, and the other smiles.
T’Challa’s smile is a dark and bloodthirsty thing. “It was the exact same thing.”
, he had laughed.
He grips the doorframe tightly like it’s the only thing holding him up.  “How?”
The projections of Central Park begin to take over the room, the fans kick up, and the group of white robots light up. Names display across their torsos. Bruce starts looking a little green.
She winks and adds, “People are filled with emotions and feelings.  They charge every interaction you have. But if you and I try, we can push past all of that and truly connect.”
“What are you reading?” Tony offers up, and that’s it, the end of that other conversation. Steve begins to talk about the history of Hersey’s chocolate and the corporate secrets, and Tony’s lips kick up while he shares rumors he’s heard in the industry or through the grapevine.
He tosses the tablet on the couch. Rhodey is leaning forward, empty bottle absently moving. His eyes are dark, gaze heavy. "What?" Tony says, a sharp edge in his tone. He swallows back anything else, because Rhodey doesn't deserve this. He won't hurt him any more than he already has.
“Tony,” Reed says, low and sincere. He’s a little wild eyed, but he’s been that way since he arrived in the Savage Lands - and Tony knows Reed enough to know this is a focused crazy, not grief ridden insanity.  “I need to get my family back. You’re the only one I know who can help me.”
But after Steve died on those steps?
“Yes boss.”
.  A jagged crack opens up and out of the screaming echoes of all of time, all of death, comes Death again. It swings it’s scythe and everyone on Thanos’ side falls, immediately, like gravity has suddenly become too much for them.
Tony has glassy eyes as he watches, boneless on the bed, as Steve presses down. His eyes shut so tightly as he sees stars. He bites his tongue against the pain because the quick job wasn't enough, and Steve only has a little lube on him, but there is no condom between them. It's just them, together, skin on skin and side by side like they have been for a while now.
before he closes his eyes again.
“No,” she had sworn, trying to find something to stop the bleeding. “I really don’t.”
"No kiddo," Tony responds darkly. "The Accords. I'll fight for those until my dying breath. We fuck up. We all do. It's what makes us human. But we have to have consequences or we'll become inhuman. And Ultron," he pauses. There are so many things that could be said, should be said, but won't be. "That was an attempt at trying to be more inhuman than I should have. But there is a parallel universe where that program worked. Where we achieved it, and I got to retire and tinker with things like prosthetics and internet chips in your brain, and we never had these issues."
He is pressed back under.  This time, his mouth is closed and he holds his breath as long as he can, struggling against the hand on his shoulder, his arms, the back of his head.
“End of the world, infinity gems, aliens.  You know,” Tony shrugs, thinking of hearing himself say,
"I do actually," Steve says.  Tony's brows furrow.
Until he doesn’t.
Steve’s leaning against the tower wall, watching out into the night when Tony comes to a stop beside him.  It’s startling to realize that he could reach out with his right hand and touch Tony’s left.  They haven’t been this close outside of a fight in nearly two and a half years.
"I'm not," he argues.  Pepper stares him down hard.  "I'm
It’s just
He stays there standing for a long moment before sitting down and flipping through his sketchbook, past pictures of Tony bent over the suit, studies of his oil covered hands, Tony’s feet against the table as he dictates corrections to an algorithm to JARVIS, and settles on a new page.  Steve catches Tony looking his way again, careful consideration of how Steve has settled in, the way his legs are crossed, and if he’s comfortable before smiling and turning back.
He does remember the long nights.  The ones where he would sit outside his father’s office long past his bedtime and listen to him mutter and tinker and try and be his best self, falling asleep there until someone probably Jarvis would pick him up and tuck him into bed.
Steve pausing, just for a moment, before slamming the shield down into his chest.  Tony feeling just one more thing shattering in him.  Tony thinking,
His mother stands and whispers something in Dad’s ear.  Dad’s frown deepens.  “Okay, okay you harpy,” Dad bites out as he stands.  “I’ll do it.”
It was, if he was frank with himself, not a new reaction to seeing Tony Stark.  Steve Rogers shouldn’t be any different than anyone else in the world.)
Steve shakes his head slowly before standing up.  “Tony, you didn’t.” He takes a few steps towards him, and Tony stays there, watching.  “You never showed any inclinations. You had Rumiko.”
"Hey," Bruce says.
"Wait, a crocodile?" Tony repeats, and he watches as Steve's brow furrows before looking at the kid, with his wide arms and explaining how he stumbled across this doctor turned human sort of crocodile in the sewers.
Okay quick recap.  Tony is trying to work on himself and forgive himself for a lot of things.  He's trying to get over the epic Avengers breakup.  He's trying to reconcile his now with what he wants.  This is how Tony (or my Tony) does stuff.  Faces it down, takes all that hurt and works through it.
Steve dreams Tony is there in the hospital by his side.  It's cut between faded memories of his mother hovering over him.  Bucky's worried eyes in his too young face.
Tony pats the wall.  “This is why you are my favorite daughter.”
(They are standing in the compound, filled with their friends, tentative alliances edging into true partnership.  Becoming a family, maybe, if they had had more time. Tony knows he will end up being the last person in the building when they leave.  He is the one who takes the last look around the building, hearing the echoes of friends long gone.
"Nothing," Pepper says, looking down to her phone.  When she meets his eyes a moment later, she insists, "Nothing.  I just asked how you were doing and he told me about the gym equipment projects.  I was only there for five minutes before you came in."
“It looks like decreased mental capacity every time you stay under longer once you come out of the simulation. Your brain seems stuck in the experiment and had a hard time adjusting all cognitive senses to the real world.  The brain is calibrating but after increasingly longer periods.”  She provides four screens of footage of him sitting around various locations, fast forwarded with time stamps until he stands and leaves the rooms.  Each one gets progressively longer.  Sometimes five seconds, others hours.
Then her grin twists, shooting a look at Clint.  "A lady never bites and tells," she informs them, and Tony starts laughing, while Clint chokes on a chip.  Thor just stares at her, eyes heavy with something he can only see as he studies her.  And Bruce, Bruce just watches them all very carefully.
Steve just takes a sip of his tea, and they sit there for a long moment before Tony starts talking him through his latest iteration on this chip that isn't pushing out enough processing power.  The hardware team is ready to run with it, but Tony's not convinced until he gets it perfect.
Tony launches himself into the air, checks the campaign below him, and sees that the others have it underhand.  They actually may be winning based on the quick number Friday pulls up.
The morning after, Steve traces the seam of the arm, high on Tony’s shoulder, and watches Tony’s face as he does so.  He doesn’t look away from the scars, doesn’t flinch, but he watches Steve more than he does the movement.  Like Tony’s waiting for the second it becomes too much for Steve.
Rhodey waves as he continues into the kitchen. "Your favorite asshole."
"Okay, let's get this show on the road then Cap," Tony says. He exits out of the windows he had been working in quickly before putting the computer in sleep mode.
"I'll have the lab cleared out this afternoon," he repeats, firm.
Tony shrugs.  “Doesn’t matter.  You still have about a million more of these things to go.”  He raises back up to the air, and is about to add a snarky,
Some times he looks up and catches Tony looking at him, with an expression across his face that feels familiar.  Like something he sees in the mirror sometimes.
"You've got three at least," Clint calls from where he's thrown across a chair, like a dame from the films Steve saw when he was young.  Natasha tilts her head to the side like it may be right or may be wrong, she won’t confirm or deny.
Tony’s smile goes rueful.  “You act like you knew me completely.”
in again.
I miss you Steve
“I won’t fail him,” Howard murmured as he dropped his hand.  “I can’t.”
“You mean, am I mainlining main meds or morphine to deal with the phantom limb issues I’ve got going?  Or does the fancy new fake arm hurt any more than I am used to?” Tony asks, and Steve knows this tone, the middle ground between serious and a joke, and Tony’s hoping you take the easier route so he doesn’t have to have this conversation.  But he wants you to ask.  Really ask, because it’s time for that conversation and he knows.
Tony laughs at the idea. “I think people would say that about me.” Steve grips his shoulders before slipping in his tongue, exploring the cavern of Tony’s mouth, inch by inch. When he pulls back, foreheads pressed together, they are both gasping for air.
Tony scoffs before opening his eyes to the blinding white of the blank world around him,  “It’s like you don’t even know me.”
Tony knows  Steve sleeps outside his room, in the living room in a chair ready to take action if necessary.  And if he didn’t feel so empty, he would feel guilty.
As long as he is loud
Tony restarts the one where he was in the only Jarvis residence.  He sits there, dazed as he stares around the dusty room.  It still hasn’t changed.  With a quick stretch of his fingers, his face is zoomed in.  There are tear tracks.  “Are we taking into consideration any variation that would be necessary with extreme emotions and recovery times.”
Spidey lifts his right hand up in a tiny wave.  “Hiiiiiiii,” he drawls out, and from the slump of his shoulders and hang of his head, it’s a little sheepish as well.
Still Steve sticks close for a little bit after that. Even when the Tonys yell,
Tony waves over the clammering press and heads out the same side exit Ross had taken earlier. The younger Ross is close on his heels. "You need to support the Accords publicly Stark," he tosses the second the doors close behind him.
Rhodey calls it his lack of socialization as a child with other children.  Tony calls it ‘hazards of being his friend’. Steve had called it ‘leaning on each other’.  He still doesn’t know who is really right.
“Sounds like this will get you that money to fund your drinking problem you keep threatening him with,” Rhodey replies.
“I don’t want to do,” he whispers, a lump in his his throat.  “I miss you all too much.”
Are you sure you want to do this?
And Tony just tenses at the sudden feeling. Just for a second. He’s hissing in pain hisses at the pain, biting back a scream for about five million different reasons. There are tears at the back of his eyes, burning, threatening to come out. Because it fucking hurts. The stretching burns his entire body. But everything with Steve always burns. White hot knives every second, so it's not much different from anything else in his life that is twisted around Steve Rogers.
and air tight
There is something about this this that makes something deep in him scream, and another piece of him is calmer in the knowledge that is where his path was always going.  That all of this, his entire life was an eventuality.
“Welcome back boss,” FRIDAY greets as the armor disperses.  Tony runs a hand over his face, through his hair before returning the greeting.  “Should I inform the others of your arrival?”
Steve smiles back, small and pleased.  "Good," he states.
," she counters.
Tony snorts as FRIDAY pulls the data up and sketches it into a line graph to show pain levels, movement speed, and exoskeleton adjustments made prior and post movement. She quietly adds historical data in another tab. "Thanks for that sweet pea. I'm good." He circles the top 3 pain spikes, and FRIDAY displays the video clips for each for him in a half screen.
Steve and Barnes are strategizing with Lang and Clint.  Lang’s hands fly wide as he tells something, and Barnes carefully nods along, following.  Natasha trails the group, and makes eye contact with Tony for a brief moment. She pats her wrists, the new Bites he, Shuri and Peter had argued about for weeks on end as they worked on, under her fingers before smiling at him.
Tony takes the escalators down, staring down at this phone where streams of data from the last test of the nanobots display.  His mind is curiously blank when he looks at the data, like they are foreign and don’t make any sense.
This time he opens his eyes to the too large sun under the Wakanda sky.  The world is whiting out at the edges and the everything is moving like it’s been slowed down.  There is a spark of green on his skin and he knows the gem’s power is dancing on the edge of skin.
“Michael is dead,” Peggy replies, short and furious, and hurting so deep that she still has to grab on the desk.  It’s been ten or so years, and it still hurts her this deep.
A message pops on his screen - FRIDAY already picking up on the thread of his conversation.
There is a moment where he thinks about closing his eyes, leaving now and not disrupting it.  But he thinks about his mother and her soft eyes, and the way it felt like she already knew.
When he pulls down the shield, the guys are already in the stairwell, moving downwards.
“Mr. Stark?” a voice warbles in his earpiece.
"I did the same with Peggy and it was a game of chicken with us.  Unspoken feelings and mistakes and I won't keep repeating the past.”
Tony pulls up the schematics, tugging them from behind five billion other windows that he really needs to clean up, but whatever.  "Okay, the lab is on the third floor.  You've got about five heat signatures between you and the stairwell, which is on your right by the way, third door.  If you wait about forty second and you can make the way in less than a minute, you'll slip in without anyone seeing  you."
The eye looks like a normal eye when Tony peers towards him.  There is no sheen of a contact lens or the giveaway glow of activated bio hardware.  So if it’s also not a transplanted eye since it matches the left one and there is no suspicious lumps for a chip or anything, or the concern of nanobots this is bio-organic extension of the doctor.
“No,” Steve chuckles a little wetly.  “You never really have been Tony.”
He starts pushes the thrusters in his feet forward and tilts until he is level, angling for the opening in the mouth as he presses forward.  The comms channel does fuzzy for a moment as Tony and Friday create and send out missiles in every which way. The insides of the whale explode on impact, the screaming of the animal muffled because, he’s, well, inside instead of outside.  Tony has to bob and weave around them, picking up speed as the countdown in the upper right tells him how much longer he has before he’s at the end of the whale.
He smells a little different, but the planes of his skin are the same.
[1] and this is the flower, of the partizan, who died for our freedom - Bella Ciao
“You think we don’t talk? With you dancing through time to visit us all?” She smiles, twisting her wedding ring before turning to him.  “Oh my baby, how tired you look.”
Tony’s still itching, still gearing for a fight, and his fingers jitter at his sides, just twitching up and down. “Go away Steve,” Tony says, quiet and dark.
Tony takes a moment to gather where he is.  He had gone under remembering the old hurt of missing Aunt Peggy.  It’s been a constant ache that has been with him for the last five years.
I have about five billion trust issues for various reasons.
Steve, eventually, feels his limbs thaw and Tony continues working until he cheers and asks if Steve wants to get celebratory burgers.
before reaching out.
Ah, a Stark backs the Avengers
It goes back to the shaken looking anchor, but FRIDAY mutes it.
That's the thing about faith, he’s learning. You carry it with you like a flickering candle, holding your breath so you don't accidentally blow it out.
"How many marks?" He asks, because he can't keep his mouth shut.
The wind stirs up into a tornado and Tony has to put a hand in front of his face before it suddenly stops, and there is a version of himself standing there.  Grey at the temples is more pronounced and his skin has a green tinge. But it looks like him, until the other version opens it’s mouth and it speaks. Then he knows it’s not.
“Yes boss,” she murmurs through the speakers in the ceiling.
Peter ducks his head and looks down at his tangled hands in front of him, until Tony reaches out and puts his hand on top of his.  “No one blames you for her death.”
“I remember being cold,” Steve continues, like he is forcing the words out of his throat.  “It was like back before the serum, and when we didn’t have heat in the deep winters in Brooklyn.”  He looks to Tony, wry smile on his lips. “I used to huddle with Ma when I was younger. After she passed, Buck would come and camp out in my room, and we would sleep in the same bed.”  His face darkens, and Steve turns back to the window. “I think I only made it out of those winters because of him.”
Steve keeps his gaze steady. "I trust you."
"People?"
Tony grins.  “At times. Not by the end.  I think Sam was more your speed most of the time.”
"Howard talked about me often?" Steve's tone is incredulous, but he holds out a hand to Tony. Tony, ever the gentleman, takes it and stands up.
"Large buildings with no one to fill them are uncomfortable," Vision adds in a soft tone.
“You do?” Bruce counters.  He reaches out with a piece of paper, and Spidey, with a sigh of someone who has done this a number of times before, reaches out and touches it with a single finger.  The paper sticks.  The costume clad teenage waves it with no enthusiasm as Bruce watches, enraptured.
Tony makes a noise of agreement, “I was always telling him to fix that.”  Bruce catches his eye with a familiar look of fond annoyance.
Tony stands from where he has been leaning over the table.  The lab is clean of clutter, orderly.  Bruce’s machines have migrated into his lab.  Tony still isn’t sure when that happened in the past couple of days.  Just that suddenly Bruce was in the lab with him all the time.
Steve smiles softly.  “I think I can still say you’re watching out for us.”
Others
Of course
(He’s nineteen again. Tony’s hungover on Dad’s good scotch, maybe even still a little drunk, but he’s stoic as he tells the officer, “Show me.”
“Less messy,” Jarvis counters.  Ana quietly smiles as she takes her next domino.
“Yes Mr. Ambassador.”
, she had said.
Natasha doesn’t correct him - just leaves a hand on his arm for a moment before walking towards Tony.
But before he had put everything back under lock and key, Tony had fiddled with the formula or the energy used to activate the serum.  Had laughed and refined it, and then put it away without thinking about it again after getting too drunk to mention.
“I’m alive,” Steve retorts.  “So I’m doing better than the other guy.”
Tony stands.  “I hope not me.”
“That’s not how it worked and you know that,” Bruce returns, voice even.  He’s watching as Tony moves, like he’s eyeing a caged animal.
Steve makes a noise that sounds like,
Steve is crossing the room steadily, getting closer to him as he talks, but Tony doesn’t care.  Can’t care. “I’m not your Tony. I stopped being him the second you died because I had to white knuckle my way though  everything after. I did that to you Steve, and the Tony who did that to you wasn’t someone I wanted to be.”
“I don’t like being in someone’s debt,” Clint tells her. She has to grin, because she feels the exact same way. “So if I punch him, I’m going to need you to cover me.”
He wonders when he'll just be a story Steve tells other people.
Her face says her thanks, even as she utters, "Now we have to go or we'll be late and before you ask, no you can not get into the suit and fly me across the city.  Never again."
“We had,” Steve gets flustered for a moment.  “It was private,” he says, finally. “What you did in your home was private and people speculated because we’ve always had busy bodies.”  He slides his eyes to Tony’s, exasperated, and Tony’s so taken by surprise he bites out a laugh before pushing it back down. “And in the war, anyone looking for some comfort could find someone else to give it.”
He remembers what it sounds like when his mother died.  He knows what he said to her last. Knowing he doesn’t prevent it can’t make his grief any worse.
Tony finishes his drink before hitting a button, “Pop Culture Therapy for Rogers, aka Movie Night in the living room in 10 minutes.”
Steve feels a similar grin begin to grace his face.
When they come the next morning, Tony tells his captors, with grim determination, “No.”
Steve has never been more sure of anything in his life. The knowledge that he loves Tony is something so deeply ingrained in his being that it feels like it’s a part of his bones, his very marrow. With every beat of his heart, he hears it sing
“Who presented it?” Natasha asks.
But that’s what he is, under the suit and the smile and the sunglasses.  Under the bravo and the quick grins. He’s just a man, trying to hide his broken pieces, the dents in his heart, the washed out color of his soul.  He’s just a man, trying to solve problems and make the world better. That’s why he’s Ironman, just a man in a suit. Nothing extra.
Others sway, like they want to get closer to Death.  Any not under the spell grab onto the wavering superheroes.  Keep them close, just in case. Steve actually takes a step forward before Barnes grabs onto him and pulls him back until Barnes can get both hands around Steve.
He rolls, and a glowing trident goes past his face mask.  Tony straightens and looks down and sees the feminine one of the group targeting.  She pulls her hand back and the trident goes zooming back to her, past him, and Tony grabs onto it, fingers wrapping around the staff.
“Did you ever tell anyone else?” he queries.
James Barnes, his mind has to continually chant the name to keep those other words at bay, stands in the glass container.  The frost has been carefully wiped away from his face.  He is momentarily struck by the peace on the man’s frozen face.
It’s Steve who moves first, reaches up and pulls Tony to him, bringing them crashing together with a bruising kiss that is fierce and punishing, and Tony doesn’t sink into it. They don’t - not this. He pushes back, fighting back just as hard, scrambling for a hold, digging his nails into the back of Steve’s shoulder blades, while Steve is creating an impression of his hand all the way to the bone on Tony’s hip.
For one heart stopping moment Steve sees a blast coming from Thanos just a second too late and thinks,
Tony waves the thought away with his left arm, and she stays silent - sullen and probably already reaching out to Rhodey.  Tony would smile if it didn’t feel like that would split him in two.
“But you will admit Dad has weird fascinations with mustaches though,” Tony groans as he stands up.  “Okay I know you’ve dealt with the weird Zero Point energy lady but seriously Howard Stark’s time traveling son is too much?”
Tony feels the truth he knows down to his bones beat with his frantic, shredded heart.  Anger bubbles up from the void of surviving.  “I’m not going to make any of this easy,” he says.
They stand out there for a while, watching the construction workers finish up for the day and take off until it’s just the two of them, leaning against Tony’s car, grinning like fools at the half built building.
“The initial injury or the actual new and improved arm?” Tony quieres, and Steve nods, so Tony adds, “The former was because of the Vienna fight.  Didn’t put enough stabilizers in the watch repulsor.  Fixed that next round, but it was too late.  And the latter happened about a year ago?  Maybe.  Shuri likes to heal people, fix problems.”  Tony grins, quicksilver sincerity, “She decided I was worth a go.”
Nothing seismic changes. He settles back into himself in ways, in steps. He stops existing, starts living. Back to that man who existed in the pocket of moments between missions and the fear for Bucky and guilt ate him alive
He starts sketching, which turns into painting. He can drift, not think about how he is just in a holding pattern. A gun waiting to be pointed. A monkey in a suit.
Slowly, with some level of dawning horror, everyone watches as Thanos takes the stone and brings it to the open spot in the gauntlet.  It snaps into place, and Tony begins to rush towards the purple giant, something screaming at him in the back of his head,
Tony what the hell happened
“Do you want us to mobilize?”
Tony stumbles to his feet and meets Death in the eye and chooses the harder path.  “Not today.”
It’s like all the air has gone out of the room, and Tony stands still, but doesn’t take it back, because it’s the truth.  And something Maria had tried to raise him to be, before the board meetings and learning at Obie’s side, was to be honest with family.
There is something, he knows, to see a man as mortal.  To see his fault lines and jagged edges instead of the smooth surface they present.  Most people don’t like the illusion, whether it be good or not. They don’t want people like him to be human.
“Okay,” Tony sighs, relieved.  “I was worried there for a second there kid.”
Steve grins.  “I’ll be back soon.”
Tony groans.  “Why are you always pointing guns at me Peg?”
The hologram flickers for a moment as she takes actively control of it, and Tony makes a note to fix that issue. Can't have a new tablet doing something like that before it hits the production cycle. "Got it. Standard notification procedures?" she queries.
Instead, he catches sight of the almost liquid metal slowly covering Tony’s body in an armor that he’s never seen before, even in Tony’s sketches or designs that he used to pontificate about in the lab.  It starts from his right side, and it only takes seconds to to engulf him. “Is that,” Bucky says loud enough that Tony catches - sightless eyes of the mask meeting his eyes before sliding to Bucky.
He can feel Steve’s wince behind him.
This isn’t heaven.  He doesn’t deserve that.
He looks to Steve, naturally waiting to hear the other man say the call.  Steve meets his gaze and starts with, “Avengers…” and looks at Tony expectantly.
how is the plan to fuel my alcoholism going?
“Jeeze,” Tony groans.  “You haven’t called me that in years.”
“He’s burning the world down,” she murmurs. “To protect us.”
Tony looks up from the floor, ignoring the fact that he is going to have to clean this up later, and sees Steve standing just outside the room, eyes dark as a storm as he watches Tony gaze back at him.
After Ultron, after JARVIS, Steve sits with Tony in the lab. He’s quiet, unobtrusive, and reads into the silence and Tony’s mutterings. A half conversation that used to be finished by JARVIS that just hangs now, like the grief and self loathing Tony wears as a coat. Steve doesn’t know what to do or say, so he just sits, coexists in the same space. Tony lets him, and over the weeks, he slowly begins to talk out loud, discussing something with Steve.
Steve mouths.  Tony mouths back,
He wakes up again, to Tony's fingers laced in his.  His chest aches, but his heart flutters.
When a developer finished a piece of code, they should completed automated testing that can be run against their application to make sure it is working correctly or if there has been another change the way this piece is working.
.  He’s used to the easy reach, the mere thought, and things being at his fingertips.  The suit doesn’t even respond to him. It’s cut off from him, slow to respond and he’s slow to trigger manual processes that he had forgotten were automated.
Tony inspects it, reading that it’s a Robot Creation Kit with AI capabilities.  It’s a punch to the gut, because the ages on it says 5-7. He has to take in a deep breath before he looks up and takes it. “Thank you Steve.”
Steve can't swallow and he stares, wide eyes at Tony across the lab.  Tony curses the project he is working on and continues on, like what he muttered didn't make Steve feel like he was hitting the ice again in the Valkyrie.
Tony beams back and turns back to the table where he was fiddling with what would eventually be a voice recording device.
You should have never asked me
(There are moments between, but they slip through his fingers like water.  All he can do is hold onto the more solid ones keep them close to his chest.  It’s hard in situations like the one he was in.
He turns back to her, “Tony knows he isn’t supposed to annoy me when I am working.”  Tony does know.  He also knows his board will work.
"I don't know if you could be more disappointed in me."
“He needs someone covering him.  Falcon is usually his back up, but this whole thing gives the vibe that they are just spread thin,” Rhodey notes.
"When are you going to tell him?" She asks.  "I know you like grand gestures, so it would be nice to know what to watch out for."
Barnes goes next, running at him and gets within a foot before he is sent flying. Thor, however, comes down on Thanos again, storm swirling above them as he walks towards him.  Thor raises his hand and already electricity is churning off him in blue arcs before he takes off running.
Be safe Tony
There is an arc reactor joke or a been there done that joke that Tony swallows down.
Tony clears the plates and cleans while the others filter into the living room. They are a soundtrack at his back, low words, then high pitched shouts from the youngest in the group and the murmur of the TV.  As Tony scrubs a dish, he half hears Natasha murmur from her usual place at the counter top.  Clint throwing out terrible ideas about TV shows they should watch.
Spidey twitches away before the pen gets there.  “Nooo.  Don’t do that,” he yelps when Tony goes for his mid back this time.
He lingers at the table before she urges him to “finish so I can see what you’re doing”.  Tony trots out, stolen towel under his arm as well.  He checks to make sure the towel isn’t one of Ana’s embroidered ones before placing down the glass and towel on the ground.  He grabs the tongs, using them to grab the board one handed while he uses his free hand to rinse the board off onto the towel.  The goop sloshes off from the board, which is clear of copper and now the sickly green color of his snot when he is ill, except for the complicated design on the front.
There is an uneasy silence after that for a long moment, before Wanda finally speaks. “He’s going to come after the stones.”  She looks from Vision to Strange to, eventually, Tony with a sort of heaviness that feels final. “Should we use ‘shell game’’ protocols?”
Strange weights his response heavily for a moment before replying, “Let’s.”
Something in him eases, and the singing in his ears silences.  It feels like there is a kiss on his brow, and the unnatural tightness in his skin begins to ease, inch by inch.
"Even the times the exoskeleton's response time was outside 1 second worst case. Adjustments needs to be made for switching direction and compensation for quick movements."
Tony learns about T’Challa’s sister who is so beyond them all at technology, who breathes it and chatters endlessly, but is still his younger sister who loves to mock her older brother.  How it makes some uncomfortable about how willing she is to shame the King.  How he has to exert his own influence with his counsel, people who have seen him grown up and age and know what he was like at three, thirteen, twenty three, and now.
"Wow that's a little personal!" Tony utters, shocked into action as he wheels around to look at Steve.  His eyes are wide and panicked so Steve clenches his jaw shut tight enough his teeth click.
We’ve got the prototype workinG!!!!!!
"FRIDAY, test feasibility, and make any necessary changes to the design before you start manufacturing. Add reminders about the notes for me. Also, take a look at the data the chip is getting. I think we're missing something, just don't know what," he calls.
Tony juts his chin out, asking her what he has everyone else, and in the back of his head he hears a quiet,
Steve can’t stop him.
Peter moves his head side to side, thinking about the response before saying, “Well some day I may not have the magical stark tech everywhere, so I should learn basics anyway.  But any way, I was thinking -”
Tony grins, and he can see the visual reaction Bruce has to it.  Knows he is using too much teeth, but can’t keep for the way he is baring them.  “Wakandians don’t like Starks.”
He takes a moment, turns back to the counter.  There is a glass ready, and DUMMY rolls over, hooting softly with an ice tray.  With a quick pat on the arm, Tony takes the large ice block from the tray.  Tony puts the glass down to pour the scotch with two hands before putting the decanter back.
Tony moves his head to the side so he stares out the wall and presses his hand against stitches again.  He presses and presses until he feel dizzy with the pain, then he hold on a moment longer before he lets go.  “Thought so,” he whispers into the darkness.
Rhodey finishes taking a swig of water. His face is covered with sweat, but not as much as usual. Tony's fingers itch to grab the tablet and see the data from the exoskeleton. They can't be done. Not yet. Not if Rhodey is still sweating from the effort of simply walking across a room. "I wanted to show you when it was finished and not a work in progress." He grins. "Just like you and your toys."
Steve, very carefully, doesn't take a breath in.
to need Steve for this. He’s been alone for so much in his life, he doesn’t have to have anyone.
Tony hopes he doesn't.
So he keeps working.
"You just talked to me yesterday Pepper. What the hell?" He protests, even as his hands grip the back of her blazer tight enough to wrinkle.  He knows she could complain if she wasn't doing exactly the same thing.
He waves a hand and creates an illusion of them both, glowing the strange orange power he had.  A soft glow of green pulses from Strange’s double’s chest, lazily floating down the orange glowing veins until it fades to orange.  Tony’s double, however, has the green infecting nearly every vein. He’s more green than orange.
Steve wonders how long he has been waiting.
"Tony has an idea, and he's coming in soon"
Tony breathes, just existing, until he can get his head on straight again.  He still feels like he is on the edge though, unable to stop staring down the edge of a cliff.
“What are you planning?” He murmurs, the humming in the back of his head rising in pitch.
Now, he just watches Barnes lean heavily into Steve’s space, a presence that seems to ground Steve in the moment.  Tony watches their space, or lack therefore of, with a moment of interest before dragging his gaze away. It’s similar to how he and Rhodey live in each other’s pocket.  Tony knows he forgets things sometimes, when he is comfortable.
, he mouths, grinning around his pizza.
Tony grins at that, and she can imagine it, bloody on a battlefield as he challenges the next villain to kill him instead of someone innocent. Instead of
The smile Steve gives him is blinding, and Tony is helpless to do anything but grin back.)
“Got a favorite piece?” he asks instead and watches as Steve’s eyes light up.  He points back to the one of Thanos, mid-snap and bodies underneath his wide legged stance.  He begins to go on about the subtle shading, and the metaphors of the bodies.
, Tony thinks bleakly.  And he remembers the gunshot ringing out, the blood staining his hands, Sharon blank eyed.  He remembers the funeral, too much, too soon, tears on his face. He remembers sitting with the body, withered and old like Steve should never have been.  He remembers saying,
He coughs, and blood wets the dirt underneath him.  The red is striking against the dirt, and his insides shudder.  Tony feels light headed as he straightens to look Death in the eye.  He wouldn’t do it any differently than he would before.
“No?” Steve responds.  Tony grins, wicked as he regains his footing.  “Leave in twenty minutes  and find me in the penthouse,” he mutters before standing up and leaving the couch.
“You can’t get any of them Mom,” he urges her.  “You can’t get in the middle of this. This isn’t your place.”
He doesn't have the right.
before they both attack him.
Doesn’t matter that the serum has made it impossible to forget things, Steve takes extra care to think,
They are moments untethered to time.  It feels like one after another, but he, later, finds out there were larger gaps between them in the beginning, but they started to get closer.
Rhodey's eyes crinkle a little bit. "Not any to report, like there weren't any issues with the last versions, all sixteen of them apparently."
Tony lost touch with reality a long time ago, he knows that.  Now it’s time to use that to do some actual good.
It’ll be fine.)
Steve avoids a lot of things.)
Steve then throws his eyes to Natasha who is watching all of them, up above on the catwalk. Her smile is small and soft, like the few times Steve had caught her unaware of him watching her back in DC. Right after the snap.
They are halfway to New York when Carol says, “We’ve discovered another contingent down in Antarctica.”
It takes more tests and more trials, and what Tony knew was true is said aloud.
Steve turns in the doorway, leaning in the door jam in such a painfully familiar way that Tony almost loses what little oxygen in his lungs.  “It’s going to be painful,” he finally gets out. “But most high risk things are,” he adds, rueful. “You’ll come out looking different, but you can’t forget who you are. Science doesn’t change that, just allows it to be augmented.  Make sure you don’t lose the good in all of it.”
Warning!  This will be super hard to read.  It's on purpose.  Wanda's a chaotic thinker and the magic made it worse.  So much worse.  Also she's a bit lost in her head.

“Saving the world stuff, huh?” Tony retorts as he sits at the table.  “You ever going to retire from that?”
"It's why we forget it the first time. Too traumatic," Tony counters, before he pauses and winces.
Her face is twisted into a wild grief when he turns.  “Tony.  I never meant it that way.”
Steve wishes he hadn’t stayed now.
He feels the ache down in his chest. Grainy footage fills his mind. Blood rushing down the side of his face, in his mouth.
He's taken to painting in the early afternoons, carefully missing Tony in his flurry of SI meetings and far too few naps. The lab is quiet, and the light is good. Steve loses himself in the process until the door opens and Tony comes in and settles into work, lightly playing music or talking to FRIDAY.
From 54985-466-8653
is doing research for SI at this time and has been communicating his location through his reports back to his research team. Okay, who is our next contestant?"
Out of the dust, Thanos stands.  He is bleeding sluggishly from his temple before the red spiderwebs begin to try and heal him again.  Tony feels winded, and there are power warning in the corner of his screen.
“I like him boss.”
The footage goes on for a while, switches angles or feeds.  It’s the compilation he had had FRIDAY put together, right after.  Tony still hasn’t watched it.
“He worked many long hours unlike now.  Many back to back mission.”
“This isn’t happy Tony,” Bruce says.
"I'll sleep when I'm dead," Tony waves the commend away as he stands. "Now what about you? What are you feeling like for breakfast?"
“What about-?”
The laughter from Rhodey at Tony’s face covers the sounds of the elevator opening, but Rhodey’s sudden sober expression clues in Tony.  He pulls his feet back and sits up to see Bruce standing just outside the elevator, bags in hand.  His hair is bigger, curls looser.  He definitely got a tan in India, but he’s clad in his favorite loose linen pants and untucked button down. He has a wary expression on his face as he takes in the scene and the room.
I am very neutral on this chapter.  There are a few moments I kind of hate, but character wise, I'm from a limited perspective.  Tony doesn't get the nuances from everyone.  He's only human.   One day I'll explain the titles of the chapters because they really do mean something, honest.  It's all coding jargon, basically steps on how to solve a problem.  I'll do it on tumblr one day.  Maybe.  Or not.  (You guys knowing my tumblr actively freaks me out.)
had that.  Why are you here?  The last time you hated my guts.”
Tony looks at him and nods, “Yeah.”  There is something there in his eyes, Steve can see, but he isn’t sure what it means.
Steve drops into the seat besides Tony one afternoon.  He keeps a careful space, but Tony lets himself fall over until he is leaning against Steve.  “How was your day?” he asks distractedly, working on editing some schematics real quick for Peter.  He has a few doodles in the corners that hopefully the kid will understand.  He typically does.
"Aren't you going to say it?"
He opens a new window and types in a query for JARVIS to check the drones he manufactured and to make sure the weapons arrays on each matches to those they are using in the simulation and to already start manufacturing on the back up ones. He has a feeling they aren't going to end up coming out of this session in one piece.
Tony. I'm sorry.
Humming Steve picks up his sketchbook again.  Tony leans closer to peer over his shoulder.  There is a rough pencil sketch of a campfire, men around it telling stories from the look on their faces, and the lines of their arms.  There is a woman in the middle of it, punching one of the men in the arm.  It’s Peggy, Tony realizes, and the familiar shading of the faces informs him that it’s the Howling Commandos.  His father is there too, Howard looks younger than he ever saw him growing up.  His arms are wide, eyes bright.
There is a hand on his thigh, Steve's, and it tightens.  He knows this isn't his place, but Steve is still bleeding a little too.
It just takes one story before Tony feels settled again, discussing the next steps and joking with Steve like he's right there.
It’s one of the quiet understanding they have always had.  Tony wouldn’t ask, no matter how much or how little time they spent with each other.
Tony looks over his shoulder at the cluster of people at the bar to their right, Natasha watching on in disgust, and probably lecturing them on their choices based on their faces.  “You know I never thought we would ever have another party like this after Ultron.”
Clint had laughed, low and bitter and Steve feels like he had the first time. Like he had cracked open Clint's chest and reached in and twisted his heart.
Steve puts his brush down, contemplates adding a little bit more blue sky to make the orange cast of the sunset a deeper contrast when he comes back tomorrow, but turns to Tony to see how he finishes the statement.
Steve remembers the fear in his mother's eyes even though he can't remember the rest of her face.  The way he had shaken, rattling apart as he struggled to stay alive, knowing that if he died, he would take her heart too.
She spun on her heels, but Howard had reached out for her and taken her wrist.  “Let me go,” she had said so quietly that Tony had almost missed it.
She had searched the crowd for him, just for a moment, but he had shrunk back.  He still doesn’t know if she ever knew he was there.  What she thought when she wouldn’t find him.
Tony waves to king.  “Let’s go have this discussion in the conference room.”  Both Vision and Bruce eye him at that, and Tony knows they will have FRIDAY tuning into the video feeds outside the room.
Then Lagos had happened, and everything had escalated beyond what he could control
"Last night," Rhodey shrugs as he reaches for the stack of water bottles on the coffee table. "Vision kept a close eye on me while I tried. Then he deemed me good enough to move without the cane or the wheelchair."
“You act like these stones are sentient,” Tony bites out, incredulous, even while something in the back of his mind sings
Steve waits a week before he asks, "You good?"
“Isn’t it?” Tony says.  “You wanted out.  You were out.  I had you away from the SHIELDS of the world who wanted you in a cage if you weren’t near a superhero, by the way.  I had you safe, and you came back.”
He leaves it out there, waiting for Tony to scoff or say something light hearted and move past the moment and never acknowledge it again. Steve carefully doesn’t look to the door, doesn’t look for an exit. Plants his feet and stays.
There is a lot more they need to say, discussion they need to have.  Apologies Tony needs to impart. He’s better now, got his footing. Not looking to hurt others, not looking to take anyone else down.
Nothing
Tony breaks it apart again and pinches the release down a hair.  He then rearranges the the pipe from the fluid container to the nozzle releasing the fluid until it’s flatter.  FRIDAY notes to the right that it’ll still release the same amount of fluid in the same time span.
He aches with regret as he opens his book and begins to draw.
Everyone is out and okay.  Thought you would want to know.
"I'm too conspicuous, but I was thinking you could use some of that Cap charm to either convince him to leave this to the professionals or at least gear him up."
The amulet twists until it is behind Strange’s throat.  It tugs, strangling him, and Tony tries to move forward, but the beaked general throw a few lines at him, capturing an arm.  Tony uses his free arm or shoot the line and then at the general. It ducks, but Thor neatly chops it’s head off.
Natasha doesn’t voice it, but she doesn’t think Tony was hoping for them to save him. He was hoping to disappear, leave them behind as whatever happened with the government went down.
also I have the feeling you could make me millions with some crazy super sticky glue invention
“It’s your place cucciolio,” she says, soft as she leans close.  “Is it not my place to try and protect you, even if you are older than me?”
he thinks.  Not giving in to this, not
Strange opens his necklace thing and shows the broken green stone.  He traces the jagged edge, and Tony knows the rest of that is somewhere in the back of his mind.  “When the stones were made at the beginning of the universe, thousands of beings were sacrificed to create this amount of power.  The creation of the stones meant peace, so the beings went willingly.”
After a little while, Tony rushes back inside, goggles still on and grabs his glass of water and the bag of baking soda he had asked Ana to give him a day earlier.
"Second door on the left," Tony states, fingers clicking on the keyboard as Steve's steps echo through the comms.  "And god, I have to work on this comm system.  How is this hardware being used in some division of my company, really."
(See the end of the chapter for
You both deserve it.
He glances at them for a second, but Thanos throws him across the battlefield. The being makes a fist and Steve waits for it. Waits for the power stone to pick him up like a rag doll, but nothing happens. Thanos roars and Strange is already moving, stones disintegrating before him.
“I love you,” Tony says, because he is being honest.
Draft reply to 54985-466-8653
It’s fair, but sometimes Steve wonders just when Tony will trust him again.
There is a wave of that too familiar yank on his stomach and the humming gets louder, so Tony focuses back on Thanos.  It hurts, but he gets out, “Here it comes.”
PR team is beginning on Phase 2 as we speak.
“Yes boss,” she repeats as she pulls up video from the last round of testing, notes from him during flights about things to fix.
“Ugh, you won’t promise.  I want nothing to do with this any more.”
“You act like I’m doing this on purpose to annoy you,” Tony replies.  “By the way, your ‘You are getting on my nerves face’ is exactly the same in twenty years.  Nice to see some things don’t ever change.”
“Even before,” Tony muses.  “I thought it would be something with fire to be honest.  Not a bullet or drowning, or even the ice. I always thought something was going to burn me.  It would be slow and I would feel it. I would go screaming into the abyss.” He looks at Steve - is able to see the minute horror in the other man’s face at the revelation of his thoughts.  Steve’s face is mostly bland, but Tony’s relearning his expression. The lines make it harder, the winkles pull his face in new and different ways, but it’s the eyes that are the same. Maybe easier to give now, let Tony catch things he used to not before.  “I’ve never been one to be simple,” he shrugs before stuffing his hand back in his jacket’s pocket.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You look worn down Tony," Rhodes says from his place at the beam when Tony comes into the complex, jacket already lost somewhere. Vision is standing near enough in case he needs to help Rhodey, but after a few iterations on the exoskeleton, he's steadier on his feet.
Tony groans, boneless, into the pillow. The buzzing in the back of his head has settled to a dull hum. It’ll come back to haunt him, he knows, but for now he feels settled in his skin. He feels like himself. “Yeah,” he finally replies.
I’m okay
I don’t want to help your friend
Bruce has a soft frown on his face.  The lines at his eyes are tight.  “SI isn’t,” Bruce loses steam to actually ask.
“Go for it Fry,” Tony says to the floor, massaging his temples and hoping his brain just stops hurting for five minutes.
Tony stands in the middle of an art gallery.  It’s one of the few things left that is still heavily done with paper and pen and by hand.  It makes him feel at home in the future.
Howard looks up sharply and pauses, taking him in.  “You always look the same,” he says instead. “It’s like you don’t age.”
Tony's eyes cut back to him, soft and vulnerable.  Bruce knows that if he wanted to, he could break Tony right here and now.  It would be easy.  A word here, a suggestion there.
He spends three months like that, existing. Painting. Stagnant and exhausted.
with the mental image of Rhodey arm wrestling Steve for adoption rights
Tony knows what a near death feels like, and know something about talking around your issues.  “Are
He’s familiar with the goggles death of a comrade gives you.  He’s a superhero and seen enough of his friends die and be resurrected.  He knows all about that sort of guilt that twists memories.
Ana smiles, and it’s beautiful, despite the sallowness of her skin.  “With all those adventures you went on with young Agent Carter, yes you should have gone a long time ago. But,” she pauses.  “The good Lord allowed us all of that time.  We should be grateful we had so much.”
“Boss,” FRIDAY interrupts.  “King T’Challa of Wakanda is coming up the elevator.”
He turns back to the facility.  “We can train the younger ones to take our places here.  I know you have been tracking those kids around town.  We can become more co-hensive and be less afraid of learning our limits and hurting someone out here.”
T’Challa’s face gives nothing when he gazes through the hologram.  “Are you going to report me?”
He starts moving forward into another room when he sees Steve, clad in a suit, across the room.  His bulk makes the people in the room look smaller. He’s near a glowing statue of Ms Marvel standing side by side with her Captain Marvel persona, at their back is Carol in her flight suit.
“Oh,” the voice says, and it sounds like it’s dancing.  Laughter echoes around him and it isn’t something the scares him. It’s like children giggling in the distance and something in him warms, like it remembers something.
in there - barely, but still there.
There is a chair with an open sketchpad on it.  Tony glimpses the familiar A symbol before he turns back to the room.  There is a steel table that he wanders towards, putting the briefcase down.  He looks back up to see the team gathered in the room still a good distance away.  T’Challa stands a few feet away, Steve at his side.
Tony dips his head, either in acknowledgement or trying to put a pause on the topic.  He’s not exactly sure. The ground underneath him is shifting, but it only seems to be him and his sense of balance is off.  The watch on his arm is screaming. He makes eye contact with a camera and shakes his head, short and quick. The watch silences a second later.
Steve knows that feeling, like he sometimes feels a chill in his bones
“So all I have,” he says, waving his arms around him.  “Is my usefulness as an Avenger, which only exists if I can use technology.  But I can’t. I don’t know how to build anything any more. I’m useless.”
“Oh,” he hears himself say. “Didn’t see that one coming to be honest.”
Rhodey sweating through his first work out of the day is the image that greets Tony when he slinks into the compound. He's faithfully upgraded to the latest exoskeleton that had been left on his dresser, just like he does every Monday these days. They have a silent communication happening here between them. FRIDAY watches and takes notes, Tony turns those notes into changes, and they fabricate a new exoskeleton to help Rhodey walk.
Howard rolls his eyes, “You’re four and we can already see you take to everything like a fish to water.  Don’t limit yourself kid.”
Tony wants to ask, but is suddenly scared to know.
Tony flexes his hand and the blade shifts back into the suit, nanobots returning back to their normal formation in the arc reactor on his chest.  He looks back across the field, and, accidentally, meets Thanos’ gaze. In the middle of the crowded battlefield, and he knows, knows that Thanos knows.  Knows he’s basically glowing with the green of the time gem he can feel under his skin ever since Death appeared.
The rest adjust to the comment with ease and change the discussion.
Tony levels him a measuring look, like he’s trying to read Steve from the inside out.  Steve tries not to bristle, keeps steady breaths and tries to look as open as he feels.  They are allies, have been for months.  They should be able to move past everything now.
"Some of the stupidests of shit piles," he replies. "I found Cap and his friend. We found the guy behind the bombings in Vienna. We split up and went our separate ways and I am coming home."
“Tony,” Steve says, but Tony doesn’t allow him to get any further.
Some days, Steve pulls out a worn sketchbook and settles into a familiar armchair and draws. He stays up on the main level, using the early morning light that filters in to see the details developing.
“You don’t,” Tony retorts, bitter and fighting the urge to go to his knees and blink.  “You can’t stop this. It’s not something you do.”
The sincerity in the statement pulls at the low vulnerable place in him that Obie boarded up all those years ago. "That's what I'm here for. The never ending supply of fun toys," he jokes.
(He comes back, he always comes back.
I’m so glad you pulled me into that fight
“No Dr. Banner,” FRIDAY assures swiftly. “I have begun some searches to find out who has been been submitting patents recently around arachnids research.”
Tony smiles and it feels like it’s pulled out of him.  “You know this reminds me of Dad and how he used to search for you.”
, he thinks furiously as he pushes down his fears, thoughts and emotions threatening to overtake him.
Tony echos the goodbye, watching as Steve leaves the room.  Every step is heavy, like the world is pushing down on him, crushing him with every little step.  Like Steve is growing smaller with every step.
("What about a scan of your brain so I can use it as a comparison?" Bruce had asked the first day.
Natasha understands, she always understands. "When I first came to SHIELD, he told me something," she says. She leans close and smiles, her soft sort of real smile, tiny and fond. "You gotta love yourself if you are gonna survive this game."
T’Challa is at his side for most of it, an advocate for all the options, a steady voice when his falters - the ally he gratefully welcomes.
Peter grins, “We’re also working on an exercise routine to put the system through the paces.  If anyone has any tips, we would love to hear them.”
He’s too careful sometimes, with Tony, who drags him in and kisses him until Steve can barely think straight.  Tony has been broken before and will be broken again and will solder himself together.  He is skilled at the process.
With sharp laugh, Tony runs a hand through his hair.  “Usually when I bring out the worst in someone, it makes them try to kill me.”
.  Tony killed him, Steve is
“You could have left me one,” Clint waves his sword at the bodies surrounding them.  Natasha twists her bites, and they charge down a bit before she socks him in the shoulder.
Sharon grins, teeth bared.  “Not the real ones.”
But Tony Stark isn’t a believer in destiny, and in some worlds, he didn’t play.  He knows himself well enough to know that. And then other’s glowing green eyes soften, like it knows what he’s thinking and nods, silently.
“Seriously,” Tony bites out, staring directly at him through the hologram.  “Radioactive spider?”
"Clint said I deserved better than what he had done to Nat," Tony states. "Do you know what that means?"
Tony follows as his dad leaves the cozy Jarvis home.  They do into the lab, gleaming metal everywhere, tools strung across every surface.  Dad makes quick work of drilling the holes, soldering the battery holder and five multicolored lights in place.  He hands it back to Tony to slide the quarter sized battery into place.
"Oh Tony", Ana whispers, as she brushes his tears away. "You will try your hardest to prove everyone wrong, won't you?"
“Like it?” Steve rears back.  His eyes are wide.  “I love it”
“I can’t listen to this Jarvis,” she bites back.  “Not this fantasy, not when we know -”. She cuts herself off and drains the entire glass.  Her shoulders are raised, nearly to her ears, and it takes a long moment before the glass in her hands clicks to be set down on the table, and she turns.
“Nope,” Tony says, popping the p. He studies Steve for a moment, and Steve feels a hot flush burn up his neck at the attention.  “What’s with all the covert looks tonight Captain?”
Before he knew differently)
Bruce is watching them, arms crossed.  His face is relaxed, and he’s leaning heavily on one of the tables.  There is a smile on his face that Tony catches, and it’s exasperated but inexplicably fond.  Like back when Thor would be explaining one of his large, majestic battles.  Or when Clint was trying to get Cap to believe every baby was microchipped at birth nowadays.  Tony tilts his head to the side. Bruce’s smile widens.
He continues on his way. There is a lovely Secretary of State at the end of the hall, red in the face. "Did you tell Steve Rogers where his friends were being held?"
He thinks about the rabbit, the way she had looked at him, aghast.  The way he had almost killed her.
Tony’s using him.  Using Steve to get to the lab, and he can’t help but feel the tinge of something in his throat, like he wants to swallow the words he’s just said.
Steve thinks about the times he existed in the moment with Tony and realized he hasn't really been alone in a long time.
Rhodey turns, sauce in hand, and spots the blue and red costume.  With a shout, he nearly drops the pot, but Vision catches it out of the air.  Spidey waves sheepishly.  Rhodey, without greeting him, starts yelling obscenities through the floor to Tony.
“How would you know?” Tony bites out, bitterness bleeding into every word.  “You’ve been MIA for a few months.”
Steve glances at him from time to time, brow still furrowed like he is trying to figure it out.
He bites his lip at the thought of adding more automation to the exoskeleton. But would people even want that? For their legs? Tony nods to himself silently, because he would, he does in the suit. He just needs to run the numbers. Check with Legal and see where they can reach out to get some focus groups.
The kid loves Steve, like Tony knew he would.  It's that Cap charm.  Tony rattles this off to Steve smugly when he comes back to tell Tony what happened.
There is a pause, and older Tony influences the scene with the barely a whisper of a thought. "Jarvis," he looks back up. "You're my friend, right?"
But he thinks about how Peggy and Howard had bent their heads together around the anniversary of Steve’s disappearance and clung to each other’s hands.  How Howard had looked and looked for Steve, and sometimes he wonders if this isn’t another similarity he has with his father.
first stage to loving me
It's something Tony's never had before, and he leans into wanting this new fragile, familiar routine more than he should.  But Steve says nothing, just smiles at him every time he sees Tony come in.
The warriors have been steadily working on the left flank.   Steve’s group on the right have spread out a bit more into the middle with his contingent. The Hulk is working steadily through the majority of the forces; Ant-Man tagging in and out when needed with him.
T’Challa nods to the swath of bandages on his right.  “This is because of that battle, isn’t it?”  Tony shrugs the best he can before wincing.    “Then you should have told me you were compromised before we went into battle together.”
Tony then dives into 3D printing plans, begins to break down holograms, trying to figure out how each layer is build on the next until he gives up, and tries to come at it from another angle.  Starts with a vase and tries to build it up into a viable 3D form.
Peggy rolls her eyes, “We are professionals at saving the world Tony.  We’ve been going it longer than you have been alive.”
Tony isn’t scared. He’s just...closed off.  Closing the doors down at the train station.  Other people can go by but no one can stop here.  It’s better this way, he reasons. Less people to disappoint.  Less people to be hurt by. It’s better, he thinks as he stares at Steve’s hopeful face.  It’s safer.
FRIDAY is kind enough to say, “Yes Boss,” and not comment on it any further.
Draft reply to 54985-466-8653
Wanda’s eyes flicker red and then brown on the screen as she waves a ball into the air, entertaining a group of children as she adds a second to the group.  The footage is grainy, but Tony catches glimpse of a smile on her lips.  Clint’s there too - in the background - too blurry to be recognizable by anyone other than those who know him.  He’s there, watching over the scene, arms clasped in front of him.
“It isn’t something new to me,” Steve finishes, smoothing his hands across his pants.  “I just didn’t know it was public now.”
It’s caught on
Tony stills and turns to her.  “I’m…” he pauses and can’t get the words,
“I have some news,” Steve says from his place. Tony carefully makes sure his expression doesn’t change.
[4] (Italian) Little sparrow.  Usually a term for someone learning to fly.
in the place of her words. The fight drains out of him in the second it takes him to remember
Steve comes off the wall, takes half a step before stopping, like he doesn’t know what to do. Tony can’t feel his fingers. “Hydra had them killed.”
“Interesting hair color,” he hears Tony say.  “I would say you’re a bit too pale for dyed platinum eyebrows, but I guess you made the choice knowing what it would look like.  Undercover job?  Make over?  Just trying for a fresh start?”
Okay but only if you mean it.
“I still don’t believe you.”
"I am with coworkers."
Because he imagined that Steve would show up and tell Howard how wrong he was. How good Tony could be if he took a moment to look past the skills and see the boy.
Thor had looked out at the dark sky, thunder rolling and lightening rippling across the sky in arcs.  Almost like the arc reactor in SI had, before he had thrown Obie through it. “That is the brighter outlook.  It will probably only end with a few of us left behind and no chance to stop what comes next.”)
Steve’s hand is on the glass before he even notices it, reaching out into the moment beyond him, and the second his hand brushes it - the glass is suddenly obscured, and he can’t see anything past the frosting.
Tony looks up then, and Steve avoids his eyes.
"You sure?" Steve asks after the silence hangs between him.
Steve’s eyes dilate, but he doesn’t move. “Tell me you’re okay with this.” His hand is on Tony’s jean clad knee, hot and heavy even through the fabric,
fault or if this is Tony.  The real Tony.  The one who isn't running a show, isn't holding everything together by sheer will.  The one who doesn't have to be "on" in every moment.
“Good idea?” Tony queries.  He watches as Spidey adjusts the fluid container size a little larger and then waves his hand to bring it all together again.  The image is too bulky.
“Nice of you to show up,” Tony says as he scrambled to pull out a secondary arc reactor out of his jeans pocket and pin it to his chest.  The bots stream out across his skin, suit rebuilding. Friday hums as she connects with the suit and brings the screen up.
Young Tony tilts his head, "Friendship seems to be something that either is or isn't. There is no passive state of friendship."
Breakpoints are moments in code where the debugger will pause, so a software developer can make sure the value the system is presenting is the one they expect in their test.
“Anything else,” he continues quieter, like it’s just something he only wants the two of them to hear.  No one else. Not even the walls. “It’ll happen if it’s supposed to.”
Steve just hopes.)
“I missed you Steve,” Tony admits finally, into the quiet.
Tony has many questions, and maybe even a few, after, for Steve.
He's working on one right now, from the view of Tony's lab at the Tower. From one of the many days where the sun sunk low and Tony ordered food and they stayed around and talked until the moon had been up for hours.
Peggy grabs his wrist this time.  Her bony hands hold onto him tight.  “Tony.  Look at me.”
“Colonel Rhodes of course,” Vision replies.  “He has the superior military training background that would easily allow him to win a skirmish like this.”
Tony rolls his eyes.  "We have issues with words.  You don't have issues with the kids."
.  What about In and Out?”
It actually looks like one of his boots but if the metal was skintight.  It’s even painted red and gold.  Tony’s lips quirk.  He know Peter catches it.
“Why do you take his compliment and not mine?” Tony shouts, faking outrage as he begins the trek upstairs.  The projection follows them, but is muted.  Spidey is waving fervently as he tells a story.  Vision is subconsciously leaning forwards as he listens. “Do you like him more?”
Tony wakes in stages until he meets Steve's eyes and starts.  He tries to pull his hand away and Steve tightens his grip.
“Are you keeping an eye on me now?” Tony asks darkly one day. It’s been a bad one, something going wrong with the project and he’s taken it apart and put it back together three or four times now. Steve’s watched, quietly over the top of his book, lips pressed together knowing anything he says will only make it worse.
Tony turns minutely and stares at him for a long moment before smiling and saying, “Hi Steve.  Been a minute, huh?”
“Michael is alive, kind of.  He has a daughter Sharon. There is also the whole clone thing.  You have them hidden away in the countryside in England right now.  I think,” Tony hedges, looking towards Fury and Coulson. Both seem confused, and Tony’s betting no one’s a deputy director just yet.  “Not 100 percent sure exactly when we are.”
Bruce finds the nearest camera and tips his head in greeting.  “The pleasure is all mine,” he responds.
He thinks about the wildness in Tony's eyes in Siberia, surrounded by the dead bodies of HYDRA's victims and seeing Tony realize that his parents had been casualties of it as well.
Tony whimpers, hips jerking upwards and meet Steve’s on his way back down. And Tony keeps his eyes trained on Steve, the way his skin glistens from the beading sweat. The way Steve bites his lips to keep from making any noise, a remnant from the past Tony thinks. The way he is always seeking Tony with his hands or mouth after he pulls his cock back before easing back in at the steady pace they are going. Steve’s always trying to find him again the moment they aren't together. Pressing whatever he can reach to him, curling into Tony.
“Do you get colder easier because of the arm?” he asks suddenly.  Tony doesn’t look surprised at the question, just amused.  “I mean Bucky runs warmer because of the serum, but I just wondered.”
, Natasha thinks, heart in her throat before settling it back down.
Tony doggedly holds onto him.  “Give it a minute,” he returns.
because he can be late.  He is always late.  He can take the suit and call Pepper and make it across town, and it won't be a problem.
“He always said you would deny that,” Steve replies faintly.  “Said you were too quick to discredit yourself when it came down to it.”  He smiles at Tony, “He bet me. I guess I lost.”
There is a crunch in the snow, and Tony stiffens before trying to find purchase and get upright.  There is a hand on his neck, and the Skrull lifts him up with one hand, a smirk on his lips. “No one is coming to save you Stark.”
“Isn’t it always?” Tony questions, and he can feel Steve shaking underneath him before a chuckle leaks out.
Tony rolls his shoulders as he quietly tells Friday to disassemble the suit into a second briefcase.  It slides off, leaving him in the hot summer sun in jeans and a t-shirt. “You must be a saint.”
Tony shakes his head.  Bruce is watching with a terrible heartbreak in his eyes.  This must be the first time he heard the numbers.  “I made you.  You didn't want to, and I manipulated you.”  He takes in a deep breath before continuing, “I still think about it.  What if we had done it right.  Waited a little longer.  Tested everything.  Stayed in the bounds of what we understood and knew.”
She is silent for long enough that Steve glances her way. "Be careful," she urges. "With both of you."
Now is time to move on from the past. From the memories that dog his every step.
Tony doesn’t need to hear anything else anyway.
A tall, dark skinned beauty stands briefly, "Yes, actually. What do you have to say about the rumors that you brought in more vigilantes who have not signed the Accords to Germany?"
The tug is strengthens as he tells her the story of the Infinity Gems.  Of where he knows they have been. The Time Stone in New York with the sorcerers.  The Mind Stone in a scepter used long after she is dead. The Reality Stone in Asgard.  The Soul Stone hidden on a planet in the middle of nowhere. The Space stone held in the Tesseract, hidden somewhere in the depths of SHIELD. The Power stone held with a collector in the middle of space.  She holds his hands in hers, grip tight in hands smoother than his.
Steve stops them when they are close but not too close into Tony's space. He's been careful about that since they began to share the lab. Tony looks at him sometimes, gaze heavy with something, but Steve won't make him uncomfortable. Won't take more than is freely given.
"Simulation beginning in two. Get suited up. JARVIS, prep."
that intern contract is pretty though
Vision had resumed looking out the window.  "I am not his friend", Vision said. "It is more complicated than that."
“Jarvis loved you very much,” Steve agrees.
"There's always something to fix," Tony replies, coming in closer to examine the tread.  "FRIDAY, we need to work on the belt.  We fucked something up."
Please don’t
Come to the Avengers Tower.
Tony looks up and realizes it’s been a week, and he isn’t sure the last time he had a real meal.  His face is an unshaven mess. He hasn’t slept in a while. “Welcome home?”
Tony still holds his breath when Cap sees the next group coming for him and looks around for a way out.  He sees the wall and starts running towards it, yelling something only the people on the other end of the communicators can hear.  He jumps, uses the wall as point to push off of, and lands behind the group, taking them out as he can.  He grabs a metal sign from a nearby abandoned food stand and tosses it. Cap takes down three more guys with that move.  He punches the fourth guy, and the group is down.  He straightens, saying something in the communicator again.
Tony wants to argue that point.  Wants to tell him that Steve is losing.  Has been losing for a while because Tony is useless and worthless.  Instead he pushes the thought away and just leans into Steve. Takes the moment like it’s the last one he’s got.
Tony knows the holes in his heart are in specific shapes.  There is Maria, Jarvis, Ana, Peggy, Daniel, and even Howard.  They are cauterized wounds, but they are still there.
Ana nods sincerely, while Maria drains her glass in the background.  “That is a good reason Tony,” Ana says. “What would save the world from?”
He puts his helmet on, sets up the systems before nodding to Reed who opens the bay door.  He looks back on the ramp, catches sight of Carol looking his way, arms crossed in front of herself, worried.  No one else is looking his way except Peter. Tony nods in his direction before looking forward. He drops out of the plane, free falling for a moment before the thrusters kick in, speeding off to Antarctica.
When Tony looks back at the scene from before, Thanos is yanking the Time stone out of the amulet before throwing it away.  Strange follows, the purple glow fading as he arcs in the air, limp. Vision plucks him out of the air, and Strange is bleeding at the temple, his eyes are red, but his mouth is moving as he waves his hands in small tight circles.  Then he flings something sharp and orange that flares out into a net. Thanos raises his hand, and the reality stone (and Tony knows this information intimately, somehow, even though no one has told him before) brightens before the orange net thing disappears.
Clint’s on the roof, observing it all.  He grips something tightly in his hand, and Tony watches them all for a few minutes, alive and moving.  Clint looks up, shading his eyes in the sun, before Tony shuts off the feed.
He also avoids looking at himself.
The fourth and final time, he wakes up to that same blue lights from before bathing the room in a soft glow.  He looks up to a wall of glass peering out into a world he doesn’t know of bright lights, unfamiliar buildings in different shapes.
Or, as Tony realizes now, a sentient stone filled with untapped power waking up and latching into the closest thing that it could find that it
"Yes Master Anthony?" Oh Jarvis. He had forgotten how Jarvis looked. Impossibly tall, kind eyes, grey and wrinkled, but like comfort, like home.
When he pulls back, Tony asks, “Are you being honest?”
Pepper’s hand brushes his, and Tony is too used to playing another person in public to jump.  His watch beeps softly to register the drastic change in his heart rate.
“The dreams,” Tony trails off, as images spring around them.  Him watching his own history in stills, waiting to be played. “They weren’t just dreams,” he says, faintly.
“How can you be so sure we still have gossip blogs these days?” Steve challenges.
He flexes his hand and knows Clint clocks it. Clint, as much as he likes dumpster pizza and is a sort of hopeless but loveable idiot like Natasha always says, sees the small things and tallies them up. The trees for the forest.
Wanda ensnares the second sniper in her red haze and brings them both to the ground.  She is speaking rapidly into the the communicator as she wraps the men in layers of metal railing to keep them penned to the ground, unable to move.
Hateyouhateyouhateyouhateyou
Tony picks up the tablet, fingers smudging the screen as he types. "I have a lot of things to do Rhodey. Just because I don't spend five billion hours in the same room as my baby android, doesn't mean I blame him."
“We tested water and it didn’t get through, and the suit monitors what air it takes in.  I think it can go to recycled air if it needs to, but for only like half an hour.  The undersuit kind of deals with all of this,” Spidey replies before he crouches and drops to the floor. Tony’s breath catches for a second with the ease the kid moves.  It’s fluid and natural, like Black Panther, but he had been training for years.
Tony thinks for a brief second, before focusing on what Steve is asking.
The couch dips, and Rhodey hisses. "Never thought learning to walk would suck this much."
Tony sighs, thoughts disappearing.  “Tell everyone I’m home,” he replies.
That’s everything I asked you to do, and I couldn’t do it for you.
Rhodey still looks exhausted using it, and his steps get clunkier. There has to be a way to auto adjust the support. But that requires motors similar to his boots. Or is this even something in the legs? Maybe this is something with the chip communicating with the exoskeleton.
He has some ideas in the back of his mind about it.  What he wants to focus on. “It’s just something to work through my grief,” he admits. “It’s not that great.”
Tony grunts as he sits up. "I think Ross swooped in while we were on our way out and grabbed them before the UN knew about it. I need to put some feelers out to figure out what exactly went down there."
He remembers not being a thing Howard Stark loved.
(She had been tired and worn, fragile almost when they went into her office, where she sat surrounded by papers and files and general work.  But when they sang her
He reminds himself of Howard, sitting back and watching all his favorite people interact.  Carefully held away and boxed into his work, only coming to join the festivities once his tumbler had been emptied three times or coaxed relentlessly by one of the others.  Tonu waves away the thought. There is no time for weepiness. He’s grieved for these people already, and is careful to make sure not to slide anyone else into their carefully curated boxes in his head.
"Rooms, landscapes, scenery," Steve offers.
“Hey,” Steve says, soft and careful.
Draft reply to 54985-466-8653
None of it sticks.  And that’s when Tony starts panicking.
Then, he notices that Thanos is no longer hanging back, he’s standing in the middle and there is a person on the ground, grayed out and someone hurtling towards the ground.  “Enhance,” he mutters to Friday, and she obliges, bringing the sight closer, closer, and then closer yet, and just at the image sharpens, Tony knows where he knows the sound from.
“I like my head,” Tony adds, when the gazes come to him.  “If it could stay were it is, that would be nice, but I won’t hold everyone to such high expectations.”
Steve does what he always did back then, breathes through it.
, she thinks in the direction of New York.
Tony can’t look down, can’t do it.  If he does, he’ll seen the metal sheen of the box.  The one he built last night when he should have been asleep.  The one he whispered things to that he hadn’t said to Steve. Couldn’t even bring himself to say to his body, even as withered and unfamiliar as it had been.
“Hey kid,” he says and looks up at her horrified face.  In the distance over her shoulder, he can see some blurry figures rushing towards them.  “I don’t feel so good.”
And he remember more than he should, holds it close to his chest.  The moments he uses to push the other guys' simmering rage under the surface as he counts his breaths.  The moments before a potential code green.  He's been without an incident in months.  Almost a year.  It's only because he has thing to hold onto, reasons to not that he's been able to handle it that long,
"Tony," he repeats, or tries to with all the iron taste filling up his mouth.
The suit reforms and he takes the blade and aims, following Friday’s projection of Hoodie’s fall, and throws.  It hits it’s target as Hoodie hits the ground, blade pinning him to the ground through the chest.
Steve starts laughing as he places a bookmark in his book before placing it on the bedside table. It's something that Tony loves, that he leaves pieces of himself around, trying to press the permanence of this relationship into Tony's life, like he isn't pressed into the very essence of his soul.
Jarvis’s shoulders shake and he hunches for a while.  Young Tony hovers in that doorway, watching and too scared to break the moment.
"People have left you before," Peter whispers.
there in black on white.)
Honesty, raw brutal honesty, always makes him want to drink. He goes back and opens the fridge and grabs a beer. It's Clint's brand. Tony only knows because it has a sticky note on it that screams "CLINT'S BEER. DO NOT TOUCH TONY." He's never been good at following directions, especially in the form of sticky notes.
“Maybe,” Tony hums, noncommittedly.  “But then that’s the same odds as before.”
“If it saves one life,” she says. “It’s worth it.”  She waits, and Tony looks at her, actually meets her eyes. “I’d do anything to save just one more person. Even if it costs me my life.”
His eyes flicker to Steve's painting, but Steve is careful not to fidget. He just waits Tony out.
“No no no,” Peter speeds out, lenses wide on his mask, and dilating even more.  “Of course not.”
“Already on it boss, Spiderman.”
in his head if he isn't thinking about something else. Carefully not pushing or pulling, just existing.
He crosses the room to where Dr, Perez is watching, eyes bright.  “You did good work,” Tony states beside him.  They watch as the two interns field questions for the last two minutes of their presentation.  Rihan is enthusiastically demonstrating bending her false leg.
He thinks where they could be now, maybe curled up, maybe laughing, maybe a million things. And his heart drops in the middle of a what if, because he will never have this, has raised the land these hopes grew on. Destroyed any chance.
He's a man ready for a fight, and Steve smiles at that, even as he feels akimbo.
He gets thrown under the weight, and Tony has to adjust, FRIDAY hitting the boosters as he tries to untangle his body from the loose armor that is trying to catch on him.  Fry takes control of the suit after he fails for a moment, and then another, and an alarm screams that another large object is hurtling towards him. She thins out the armor enough Tony can almost feel the sun on his skin as he pulls his arms out and then kicks off the whale head, flipping while the nanobots rush out from the arc reactor, rushing to cover him again, layering the suit thicker before rebuilding the boosters and hurtling him backwards.
“Boss?” FRIDAY asks hesitantly.  “Do you want me to get Colonel Rhodes?”
This was cut from chapter 9 once I realized I had two memories side by side and mergh.  Formatting.
And then he goes and says things like, "I'm not sure you are comfortable with me being in the same location as you after what happened to Colonel Rhodes." And Tony knows that isn't something he wrote. The empathy.
Tony pauses for a moment, measuring him, recalibrating his image of Steve, before replying, “Okay.”
Then, Howard crosses the room in a few short strides.  He grabs a hold of the back of Tony’s neck and pulls him into a hug that Tony stiffly takes.  “I’m crap at saying this, but you have always made me so proud. Always will.” Tony takes a moment to ease into the hug.
in slow, sleep drenched thoughts.
“Pepper huh,” Bruce notes.
"Takes one to know one," Steve murmurs before coming in for a kiss.
Tony rolls his eyes.  “Okay, I’m trying to make sure the kids don’t kill each other or go crazy in case alien armies decide to descend down from the skies.”
"You do good work Mr. Stank."
“More like four,” Steve replies, “but true”
"We'll deal with everything later then. Want me to tell you about the terrible food they are trying to poison me with here?"
Bucky laughs and says, “You’re just lucky I need another beer.”
- adds. "Ready Avengers?"
“I didn’t know Tony spoke about me,” Bruce returned, tone light.
The simulation needs to be finished before the team can take up in the new training room. He needs to make sure the drones are programed to get moving as soon as they start the simulation.
“Yeah,” Howard stands and goes for the scotch.  He turns back and inclines his head, but Tony shakes his no.  “Why?”
Got some company.  You’re going to like them
He turns and walks out of the apartment, down the hallway and takes the elevator.  He’s very careful not to look back, not to go back. Once he gets to the landing pad, he looks up to Steve’s floor and sees him staring down at Tony.  His hand is pressed to the glass.
There is something in the look in her eyes that Tony has never seen before.  No, he had.
He catches Bruce’s, looking for some accusation, some anger, something.  He catches sight of something worse - endless grief written in every line of his feature.  “I know you were working on those Accords longer than you would admit.  Politics never move fast.”
If it is a true dupe, my search re FPE four times today were a lie.
“Tony?” Rhodey voices, close to his ear.  They’ve known each other for decades, and Tony knows he’s being asked a myriad of questions here, something like,
Natasha mutters, “Rule number one?”
Barnes is missing his mechanical arm, Sam is diving in the air, trying to give him cover as he makes his way to Steve who is on the ground near Thanos.  Lang is large and giving cover before shrinking again
“Oh I always evolve,” Tony replies with a grin.  “You just have to keep adapting too.”
He uses the same device as Lang to neutralize the vest and handcuff the would be bomber to a railing.  Wilson takes to the sky, jabbering to the communicator, and poking the screen covering his forearm.
He takes in a few more breaths, the blooms of her garden filling his lungs, reminding him of springs at her side, quiet instructions and her patience as she taught him something he has long forgotten.  The way she had loved the flowers there with the same steadiness, and knows she never needed to hear the words. She said it in every touch, every smile.
Instead he carefully looks away from the camera feeds in the middle of the night.
He’s tense, ready to move if needed, but the pressure on his knee stays there for a moment, Steve just watching for a beat. Then two. Then three. Something bleeds out of him at the pressure Steve keeps there on his knee, and Tony knows something shows in his face because Steve finally moves, cupping Tony through the jeans.
Steve reaches out, and Tony flinches away.  “I killed you,” Tony admits. “I killed you and SHRA wasn’t worth it.  None of it was worth what it cost people.”
“Am I not?” Tony asks, and something complicated passes over Daniel’s face.  It’s too fast and Tony isn’t familiar enough with the emotions on Daniel’s face to follow it.
The other being nods before setting off, and Tony focuses in on Clint and Natasha, back to back, circling around, comms silent, as the the group around them rears back about to leap at them.  Natasha is tensed, ready to leap forward, while Clint presses something on his bow transforming into a sword.
“Please brother,” Shuri waves carelessly.  “If I was going to have Tony Stark address me by a title, I would go by Chief Innovator of the Wakandan Design Branch.”
But he’s vibrating, like this mad energy was unleashed when his insides broke into a million pieces. Tony can’t keep his hands from shaking, curls his fingers to hide it, to hide the fact the fact that he is losing his shit, completely out of control, spinning in a way that he has never descended to before - even back in the early days of taking on the billionaire playboy role.
“Wanda and I share a mindspace,” Vision says, steady, like it’s nothing, even though Tony hasn’t heard any of this before.  “Sharing powers is similar too.” He meets Tony’s eyes and the emotions are the same as the time like that one time in the Compound kitchen when Tony had said,
Tony shouts, “Pause it FRIDAY” as he covers his eyes and grasps for a chair. He can’t find one, so he slumps to the floor.  The open lab feels too small, like it is closing in on him and his throat
He has JARVIS walk him through the equations the next day, step by step by step.
Tony pulls away, and Steve feels the immediate loss.  “Don’t say things you don’t mean Steve.”
Steve steps forward, puts his hand on Tony’s and says, “Jarvis mourned you hard.  May woke up eventually and she provided him a shoulder, and he took it. She married him, proposed too.  He took the kids under his care. Make sure they had a bed, a place to live, a warm meal every day. He died at nearly 100, surrounded by all of us.  It was easy.”
“I heard a rumor there was some interesting work with the interns and the StarkTablet.”  Tony smiles at the sea of curious faces. “Also I should probably be here to encourage the masses, make them smarter by just existing near them.  Give them a story for when the call home and talk to mom and dad.”
(His fingers are shaking on the paper.  He can see his breath and his vision is blurry, so he has to keep blinking back tears.  “Your teammates. Your
“Mom?” Tony cries, voice raising.  “I like my comics!”
he hears between the lines and his eyes dart to Steve who is carefully not looking their ways, but Pepper catches it like she does everything else and her grin widens.
“I can not definitively say he has been happier since you have come here based on the last months,” JARVIS admits finally.  It’s soft, like it’s an admission the AI didn’t want to make.
He takes in a deep breath when he’s alone in the room and thinks about ice and cold for a moment before quickly heading to the whiskey.  Even the burn as it goes down feels cold.
“Mr. Stark, when I woke up in this era, I had no one, nothing.  You gave me a purpose, somewhere to belong. You gave me a
The being reaches out and touched his cheek, and there is a ripple of something through Tony’s body.  He calms, like he knows what is coming, even though he isn’t sure. “We’re bonded, you and I. We’ve known about you before the universe even began to put your conception on track.  I know your every atom. I wasn’t going to submerge you in the powers of the stone and burn you out.” It grins, sharp and filled with too many teeth. “I, we, all of us, like you Tony Stark.”
Tony thinks about the pain, the goop he drank, and how keeping the secret almost killed him faster than the palladium.  He thinks about pointing his repulsor at Rhodey, as fuzzy as it still is, and thinking,
Spidey huff a laugh behind him.  “Says the man whose mobile development group presented the glitchiest tablet known to man in an internal demo yesterday.  I think they handed it to the interns because they can’t fix it.”
Steve shrugs, quiet. “If we don’t keep watch, you might do something like make a break for it.”
smart has nothing to do with age and everything to do with ability
The video goes back to the reporter.  “There is has been footage of Falcon flying outside the camp, warding off Iranian troops from the air.”  The video cuts to Sam in the air from a distance and he swoops down, Red Wing ahead of him, as Iranian troops scatter without a shot fired.
"The latter," Steve mutters. He looks down at his hands for a moment. "I didn't want to burden you with this."
He smiles, a little helpless as he remembers Jarvis correcting him day after day as he tried to make the sauce.  “I was lost after they died, and one day, he pulls me into the kitchen and puts me to work.” Tony laughs. “I was terrible.  He knew it, I knew it, but we made something manageable to eat. It was only after that he told me it was my mother’s recipe.”
Peter pulls back, eventually, embarrassed, and looking at the exits again.  Tony gives him the reprieve.  "Anyways, I'm pretty sure Rhodey has adopted you so good luck getting rid of that limplet.  He's stuck through some crazy shit with me."
“Thanks FRIDAY,” Spidey cheers.  “You are the best.”
He is older than her in this moment, and that fills him with such fear.
His throat burns, and he feels raw putting it out there.
He moves in his seat, shifting side to side, nervous energy rattling around in him.  “Do you...do you want to grab a burger?”
Natasha is leaning heavily on Cap's chair, watching him. Sometimes he feels like she can split him open like a watermelon and can count all his thoughts and secrets like they are seeds in his pulpy flesh. He waves at the ceiling when it gets too much.
“What do we do now?” Tony asks.  “Thanos is trying to summon you, and I don’t think I can fight that very well.  I think ripping an infinity stone out of my head will kill me.”
Please refrain from sharing that tidbit with your houseguests.
“I’m a retired secretary,” Peggy responds, a gleam in her eyes.  “I couldn’t have an idea what you think I do.”
Strange pulls Tony aside as everyone rushes off to grab their armors.  His gaze meets Tony, eyes dark and serious, and he follows the doctor turned Harry Potter character without any words spoken into a shadowed alcove.
He takes off our the nearest window. He has FRIDAY send a payment to the building's owner before he pushes a bit harder, a bit faster, so all he can think about is making sure he doesn't crash and not his former teammates faces in the RAFT.
Steve’s hips shudder, and Tony’s do the same, but Tony doesn't blink. He just watches Steve watching him, gulping back as they both fall off the cliff they have been on the edge of for a while. Gripping on tight to each other, pressing so close that Tony doesn't even know where he ends and Steve begins. Because they've been that way for a long time. So entangled, so immersed in each other's lives that there isn’t any dividers any more.
Good.  Better.  He is walking on his own.
If there was anyone Steve knew could push forward on focus and drive, it’s Tony.
The Time Stone feels a little like both, Tony knows.  There are unintended consequences of what he has done, will do, has done - but they are his actions.  His wants. His choices, because at least he gets one, some way to influence the map instead of trying to desperately make a mark here.
He swallows hard, and Tony has to push the tears back as he smiles.  “He would have been an amazing father.”
He redirects and takes a seat on the couch in the corner. The old one he used to use in the tower that got moved here. For continuity's sake he had declared, back before Steve had tried to put his shield through Tony's chest.
in a voice that sings with something else, Steve just meets his eyes and grins.
They make their way across the field in groups.  People sometimes move from one to the other, but the clumps are pretty well defined.  Tony flies above them, silent, not able to deal with the heavy looks from everyone until Friday murmurs, “Boss?  Karen has mentioned that Peter is feeling apprehensive.”
Twenty seventh.
"Welcome back sir, Captain," JARVIS murmurs, a little wry. Tony stays hunched over the device left out on the table, but Steve can still see how he shudders for a moment, eyes closed, before he settles and goes back to work.
“JARVIS?” Tony asks as he looks at the minimalist furniture in shades of white.
Her grin is bright and eager, “You get that from both of us.  You never saw that in your father, because you are too similar I think, but he wanted to save as many people as he could.”
He’s always read Tony better than he should be able.
They stay there for a while.
It doesn't feel like breaking apart to admit he has too.  The world keeps spinning.  No supervillains pop up. It actually feels anticlimactic.
Wanda comes back to the Avengers.  She is careful in a way she wasn’t before, Tony can tell from the old videos from the battles.  Pietro sticks close to her, never leaving her orbit until his death fifteen years later. She doesn’t crumple this time at his death.  She falters but stays strong, keeps on target.
Rhodey opens his mouth, narrows his eyes, and then asks, "You going to pack anything?"
The doctors run test after test after test.
rings in his ears.
"I dunno," Steve says. "I can still feel the ones from 70 years ago."
(Vision had drifted into the living room while Tony and Rhodey had ate breakfast. He had perched on one of the chairs and watched them for a moment. Clad in slacks, a button down and a vest, he cuts an impressive figure. But Tony sees someone else in his posture, his mannerism, and turns his back to those with a wild grin.
“I think you’re hiding it from yourself,” Steve says carefully.  He watches as Tony minutely winces and knows he’s found something there.  “I think it scares you more than you want to admit, and I’m not sure if it’s because it makes you different, or if it’s because it’s not yours and you don’t know the limitations, but I know you’re not comfortable.”
She studies him for a moment before offering, "You don't have to-"
“Have you gone to see her?” Tony asks, when Steve nearly finishes the sketch.  He’s barely an arm length’s away from Steve, who noticed the closeness a while back but continued drawing.
Bruce still knows he is the intruder in this relationship.  He is the one who has settled into Tony's lab, Tony's projects, Tony's home.  He knows with every searching look from Rhodey, the casual way Tony doesn't make any assumptions on his opinion without asking, careful to have an answer before continuing.  He knows with the way Spiderman dances around the two of them, ready to jump in if needed, even as he peruses the nanobots projects.  He knows in the way Vision carefully explains things that has happened in the last two and half years, filling in the gaps and silences that linger in the Tower.
She grins, quicksilver, before she schools her face. "You two are too similar sometimes."
The second time, he opens his eyes to panic and lights that are too bright and familiar-yet-not voices shouting words he can’t recognize.  It’s like the words are spoken and he let’s them fall in one ear and out of the other. He closes his eyes against the light and ears against the noise and thinks,
“Just A Very Intelligent System,” Steve replies, avoiding the question he can see in Tony’s eyes.  “Peter did it to honor his memory.”
(She realizes in the middle of the battle with Ultron that Coulson is right, he was always right and just waiting for her to see it.
(He never wanted to kill Tony. Just wanted to stop him, beg him to pause.
“Fry, are you on this?” Tony blurts out.
The other man straightens up as his face clears. “Good.  I don’t need to deal with you shooting yourself up the second I walk away from you.”
He doesn't see any in Tony's eyes when he looks up later. Steve wonders what Tony sees before he looks away.
“I’ve heard you’ve been visiting,” Tony murmurs one night in the infirmary.
(Every once in a while, Steve will reach out and touch Tony’s face with a wonderment of
Peter laughs and then settles back on the coffee table, asking
“Natasha?” Steve voices, moving until he puts his hand on her shoulder. She twists away from him, a furious move as she swears a little loudly.
Thank you still. Rihan can’t stop giggling
He looks back to Wanda and sees her red glow still intact around her.  Vision’s redder now, imbued with her powers, but he looks at Tony with the same even expression he has since he activated.  Strange’s green glow has faded until it only a tinge, overwhelmed by the orange of his magic, or whatever it was.
Draft reply to 54985-466-8653
“I need to fix myself first,” Tony says.  “Anything that comes after that.” He pauses and looks at Steve who has his hands held together in front of him, falling into parade rest - ever the soldier.  Tony feels a surge of affection in himself that rattles around in his insides before fading. He sharply misses emotion.
"I love you Peter.  You are a part of my family.  You can try and throw it away, but I'll always love you and have a place for you."
Bucky eyes him like he's a liar. Like Nat had watched him earlier, or will watch him. Or never did.
Peter Parker
All of a sudden, he hears the whale echos as it slams into him.  Tony feels the breath knocked out him for a second, alarms blaring as Friday says “boss” in an increasingly stressed tone.
The silence between them is heavy. Tony has to swallow back the lump in his throat. "Dad wasn't drunk. Their tires was shot out. They crashed. He pulled dad out of the car and killed him and then went to mom's side and crushed her throat. Dad wasn't drunk."
“I should be the first to go,” Jarvis says, twined fingers brought close to his lips as he kisses her fingers.
It was fry
“I already knew,” she murmurs.  “You aren’t good at keeping secrets when you panic Anthony.”
“I,” he starts before grimacing and finishes the glass before standing up. He pours himself another finger or three of scotch, tasting it before starting up again. “I keep looking down the line at the next five years, ten years and beyond even, and wonder if it’s worth it. If any of this,” he gestures with his glass. “Is worth what I am going to have to do to make it okay.”
Really Tony?
Tony spends long days in the quiet house, taking apart the toaster Steve never uses.  He tries to put it back together but forgets how things go. Has to have JARVIS pull up images and instructions.
Steve's gone when he comes back.
Steve stays there watching for a while, before Natasha comes up besides him.
Tony's fingers begin to beat on the top of the chair. They've only tested with regular movement, but his mind races when he contemplates how would the prosthetic work under more intense situations. Like sprinting or a quick change of direction? He would have to check the calibrations they currently have on the motors. Maybe upgrade the chips. See if he can build some predictive programming into the chips. Or make the exoskeleton less manual and more AI related.
“I can do that.”
Tony lights up.  “Oooh it’s been forever since I have had a burger.  Don’t tell Pepper.  She’ll kick my ass five ways until Sunday and her heels
Steve keeps his mouth shut, lips in a thin line.
“I spent every summer looking for you in Antarctica, and I never found you.  Do you know how much that killed me, getting the call? 300 hundred years you missed because I couldn’t find you in the ice.”  Steve runs a hand through his hair until it’s all over the place. “You lost time with everyone because I couldn’t find you.”
He meets her gaze, “But you think I wouldn’t know Aunt Peggy who comes into town once every three months with a dozen stories and tucks me in before going off to talk shop with Dad and to make sure he isn’t trying to build anything too accidentally bad while borrowing Jarvis for one or two escapades?”
"To your left. I need you to walk out the opening right there, and I'll catch you."
They watch him move swiftly, and the second he’s out of sight, FRIDAY has a display projected in front of him as he slips into a seat at the table.  Vision observes with a small smile at the counter where he is putting the finishing touches on the brownie dough, and Rhodey continues cooking, loudly narrating how he is going to kill Tony if he doesn’t get his ass up here
Can we just not drive her to angrily haunt us and yell about our life choices?
He leaves them, leaves the embrace and the hurried whispers, because they deserve that moment. It’s not his to share in.
It’s getting worse.  They’re planning to put him under.
Tony looks up from a book he’s reading, hard cover because Steve likes the feel between his fingers and the smell of leather bound books.  He can see the way Steve is trying to hide his anxiety over the topic “Sure,” he replies, easy going about it.
Steve comes in late every day in some variation on a military uniform.  He doesn’t say much about what he does. Just asks Tony about his day, avoids questions about giving away too much, just reminisces about the times before the Civil War.  He remembers highlights. Not all the details.
“What’s your name?” Steve presses.
“So’k,” Steve replies.  “Can’t sleep, so,” he shrugs.
and Steve shakes his head with a smile.  It's not a contest, they both know it but still, Tony takes the joy where he can get it.
"Did he and Peggy ever..." Steve pauses at the top of the stairs.
:) nope
Tony shrugs.  “I’m in a loop right now, but I’ve been able to interact with you guys for about a year now.”  He nods to the notebook. “You working on a new element?”
“Later.” Tony echos, Afghanistan closer in his mind than it’s been in years.
"Yes sir. Mr. Rogers, if you take a look at the tablet, you will notice an icon for the Avengers. This file will include…"
Wanda’s screaming.
A hand curls around his shoulders, and they stay there for a while both staring into nothing. Vision drifts in and stands in the doorway, keeping watch even though there is no chance of interruptions in the silent building.
Rhodey’s hand is in his left.  Tony laces their fingers.  “I know Tony.  I know.”
There is dead silence in the room, and Fury’s mouth is hanging open.  Peggy’s lips are thinned and Coulson, well Coulson looks like he is about to kneel over of a heart attack a few decades too early.
The alarms in the room went off, “Unidentified ship in Wakandian air space.”
There is a dull ping as the stones fall from the gauntlet to the ground, one, two, three, four, five, and half.  All fading before falling to dust on the ground. Tony looks up at the sky, because there is a strange song in the air, and someone is singing,
(He hopes…
T’Challa’s face is open and honest, but Starks have been banned from entering Wakanda since 1943, and Tony remembers the conversations he had back when the palladium poison had blackened his veins. He remembers the denial and anger.  He remembers the cool anger of T’Challa’s father when they met last, right after Lagos.
“We don’t use words like that,” Peter counsels, very sincere.  “They are ageist and that is discriminatory.”
Don't get caught kid.
“Oh,” Ana gasps.  “You’re their son.”
"It's Starbucks level Tony.
? It sounds like him as an old man, grizzled with age and at end.
Tony waves the data away.  “Go through former data and video, take into account body language and average times for moods to disapparate.  Make sure to check for the alcohol variable.  You may need different data sets.  This is all normal.”
"FRIDAY end the simulation,” he says sharply.
You're in the biomedical group. Minchen is an idiot but he has decent ideas. Perez actually knows how to do good work, so he's your mentor.
I still miss those times.  All of us together.  The Avengers
"He's got some super strength, likes spiders and wears sweats, or maybe pajamas.  I'm not sure," Tony continues.  Steve watches him, intently, and Tony tries to think about that either.  "It's driving me nuts.  I made him a suit."
Tony scrubs the evidence, Steve knows, but he passes along the video to Natasha. He thinks Clint knows too.
Rhodey catches his eye, and Tony tilts his head side to side.  The other man nods before making eye contact with Bruce and indicating to Peter who is watching the war cries of the Wakandians.  Bruce nods his head once, and they all look to Vision who has been watching them. The corners of his lips incline, an agreement before he looks to Wanda.   She has been watching them silently, eyes steady.
Something in his face eases, lines erasing themselves as he unclenches himself.  "Yeah,"  he murmurs.  "That sounds good."
“Can we talk about the fact that you named my very sophisticated AI Karen like this is some 80’s teen movie.  Karen? You can’t have any originality?” Tony retorts while he raises his shoulders and the back of the suit fans out before shooting out some of the larger missiles towards a pack of the Chitauri on the flying vehicles.
Tony hovers, adjusting himself to the positioned flight path that Friday charts out.  “Uh, you don’t want to know honey bear.”
Steve finds out months, years, after the fact.
Widow appears under Falcon’s arm.  He’s bleeding from his temple, but he’s waving off Cap.  His goggles are firmly on, but Tony knows that face.  He’s annoyed and pissed he gotten taken by surprise like he was.
Tony’s face eases.  “Oh I remember exactly how much you hate choosing a side.”
Too much.
He thins his lips and looks into Steve’s eyes.  “It’s a good room,” he says. “I think I want to take a nap though.”
“She deserves some good things in her life,” Tony retorts.  “Him too.”
In the end, Steve is, has been, but he is also good at holding words in when they come to his feelings.
It takes a week, but there are amendments and the Accords version 2.0 are already being worked on by a select group of ambassadors and Avenger lawyers.
They are friends, he thinks, and knows it won't last much longer. Once he finds Bucky, Tony will find out.
Steve can't hide from it, but he pressed his lips together. "A long time," he says.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve hopes.
Even though there is a football field of distance between them, Tony can hear it clearly, like the words are being spoken right in his ear.  A shiver takes over his body, and Tony knows that isn’t him. It’s the stone.
"Love you too," Steve murmurs.
Howard blinks at him, hair greying at the temples in the beginning of his slow descent into white.  There is a model, half finished in the corner and plans for the Stark Expo strewn across a table. “We have a working model, but the scalability is problematic,” Howard looks towards his chest before glancing back up.  “But it looks like that gets fixed later.”
"You built a real holodeck," Clint accuses. "A real life holodeck."
Steve’s breath catches, and he stays carefully still. Tony rolls his eyes, and says, “Are you going to kiss me?”
Because once he could have turned to someone else and admitted he didn't know how to fix this. He could have turned to Fury and listened to the rant about fixing problems that didn't need fixing, Pepper's fond speeches about, Tony he just needs someone outside of all this, or St-
Tony tries to find the spot over Steve’s shoulder he tends to favor in tough conversations, right above his ear, but Steve lays a heavy hand on his keep that gently directs his attention back to the man’s face. “Why did you kiss me?” Tony asks instead.
Steve takes it slower, softer, this time, ghosting over Tony’s hipbone , twisting his tongue as he tattoos all his secrets into the skin there, soothing the spot where his hand is imprinted into Tony’s skin, stark against the pale skin. Steve works his fingers around the curve of Tony’s ass, pressing closer as he bends. His mouth edging closer to Tony’s dick.
Jarvis reaches for the tea kettle before she takes her head.  Instead he goes to the scotch and pours her a few fingers before handing the glass to her.  Ana pokes Tony and he turns back to her confused.
Jarvis had met them at the exit, fretfully wringing his hands until Tony took one, and told him about how brightly Peggy had smiled.  He had calmed after that.)
along with the pants protocol.
He doesn’t believe it will work, but he believes for Steve.
Cap had had his ridiculous suit on that Tony kept trying to rework - at least make a few upgrades, but Cap always dodged the offers - and had been reading a file or maybe perusing Facebook on a StarkTablet. His shield lay on the table top, and he had an intensity as he read whatever it was. Tony had wanted to make a joke, but there was something serene about his focus, that he didn't want to break.
Vision covering Black Panther. Tony and Falcon going after each other.  Rhodey, Spidey, Vision and Panther going after Lang.  Wanda going after Rhodey.  Cap and Winter Solider booking it across the tarmac.  Hawkeye engaging Panther.  Vision taking down the tower.  Rhodey hitting Wanda with the amplified sonic vibration.  Bruce pauses on the footage of Cap and Winter Soldier  disappearing under the crumbling tower.
Steve opens his mouth to push to argue but Tony breaks in with a  “thank you for your time” in a raspy voice. He stands up and Steve follows him as he leaves the room, still clinging to Tony’s hand.
Thor shrugs.  “It has been two years.  What has been up with you Captain?”
Steve’s face lightens.  Sam shifts at his side, but Tony is watching Steve.  “Thank you,” Steve utters, relief in every line of his body.
He puts the water bottle down and skims his fingers on the mat between him and T’Challa.  A hologram bursts to life between them that displays different pictures with a single slide of Tony’s finger on the heavy plastic.  There is first a picture of T’Challa in Siberia, watching him, Steve and the Winter Soldier behind his Black Panther mask.  Next is one of Panther getting Zemo in his plane, handcuffs gleaming on his wrists.  Another is helping a limping Steve and company onto his place.  The fourth is Zemo being dropped off to Everett Ross’ shocked face. Sharon Carter hovers in a corner. “That’s my favorite picture,” Tony adds before going to the fifth image.
Tony carefully puts the kit aside and doesn’t look at it as he advances on the food unit they both jokingly call a replicator with a wrench.
Steve looks at her instead, "I'm not." He stops again and turns his gaze to the ground.
Tony snickers for a moment, because there is a butt joke right there.  Steve stays there, seriously and intent, so Tony settles and places a hand on his face.  “Of course, Steve.  Of course.”
“Come home to me this Christmas,” she urges again.
Shuri bites back, “What makes you think I haven’t already gone on my first date?”  She then grins, “And I’m more worried about Okoye than any of you colonizers.”
"It's not you," he says. "It's me. I'm flawed. Hell, everyone knows that. I see the forest and not the trees sometimes, but you're the freaking Amazon to me and all I can see is what I wanted the Accords to be." For us.
"I'm scared of being vulnerable first," Steve does say.  "Sometimes it feels like you wear your heart out there, waiting for someone to target it."
Jarvis straightens, a smile on his lips. "You will perform admirably as always Master Anthony. Now, you should go finish working on your project while I finish the dishes. We wouldn't want Mrs. Jarvis to find me behind on my chores."
Tony laughs, clear and free before pulling Peter in close.  “When you hit a certain age, you stop having shame about talking about someone behind their back and just give them a warning before you start some rumor.”
They have entire timelines mapped out.  The stones are labels in his mother’s handwriting with photographs of the cube, readings and other things.  He follows the papertrail they have penned up, mapping out the beginnings of a plan to do something.
before following up with
Aunt Peg would have my head if something happened to you
Tony takes in a deep breath as the pain eases, like it’s been reset.  “Okay it’s a timer,” he mutters. “You could have been kinder sentient stone who swears it likes me but I think lies cheerfully.”  There is a laughter ringing in the back of his head as he opens his eyes to a garden, filled with flowers.
Steve just nods his head, all of his words used up.
"Yes," Vision had intoned.  "
Steve knows Tony as loud and dynamic and always moving, and he knows himself well enough now that he isn't like that. He's quiet, forceful to a point of rash and chasing what he thinks is right right off a cliff. He has never used words like Tony has, wishes he had.
The other man takes a seat across from Tony.  His face is open and the smile is as honest as Tony knows his is.  “What did you want to talk about today?” he asks finally.
But he does call.
Steve finally pulls back and stares at Tony for a long moment. He has a little bit of something at the corner of his mouth and Tony reaches up and swipes at it. Steve wraps a hand around Tony’s wrist and holds him there. They stare for a while, just breathing, and Tony finally says, "I should return the favor."
“Yes,” he replies, firm, because Tony deserves that. Deserves his honesty and insistence, and everything he can do to confirm it. Make him understand how sure Steve is.
"I know," he replies, sharp and short and to the point.
It’s like a sigh of relief, a burden off his shoulders to admit it, before the look in Tony’s eyes comes rushing back as he pounded the shield into his chest. The fading of his trust, his faith, anything he had held for Steve.
Steve’s fingers find his on the sheets, and they curl together, gripping so tightly that Tony thinks he may break a few fingers. But in the backdrop of all the pain, he can hear Steve whispering. Quietly, barely muttered words from someone so close to the edge that their voice is already shot. Tony, he says, barely able to get the word out. Oh Tony.
I heard he is walking.
“You’re always that weird,” Bucky replies.  “But you are being extra weird.  So do whatever you need to in order to stop it.”
“Don’t ask if I’m okay. I think we both know the answer to that one.” And Tony kind of grins, just a little hard around the edges, face not so friendly and expression not as welcoming. But Steve doesn’t leave, just stands there. Holding the line.
Then Tony will throw out a joke and Steve will smile and forget the face, forget the questions.  Just be happy to exist in the space with Tony.
Before
I’ll be there in a second.
That’s when four more beings beam down to the planet from the ship above.  One that looks like it always does chest day and is twice as tall as the rest, a chain resting in its hand.  Besides it, there is a thin no-nosed man, steepling it’s fingers against each other as it surveys them all, followed by a hunched hooded figure and a feminine looking alien with darker blue hair and skin above her lips and lighter blue below with a trident in hand.
Tony rages with, “You didn’t even tell me about my parents, and you may have known my Dad first, but he was a bastard.  My mother didn’t deserve that.  I didn’t deserve to have my inability to handle my alcohol haunt my days because I would probably kill my wife like my father did, driving drunk.  Why do you think I have a fucking chauffeur?  Because I can’t drive?”  He scoffs and drinks a little too heavily for the next hour.
“They couldn’t make Tony do anything,” Steve hisses. “He isn’t a war criminal.”
He puts his hands up and steps closer into the light.  Peggy takes the shot, and the bullet pings dully off his suit.  “Hey I just made this suit,” he yelps. “Can you not scratch it Peggy?”  With a tilt of his head, his helmet collapses down neatly, and Peggy is taken aback for a moment before her face hardens.  “Howard Stark is too dead and Tony is too young, so who the hell are you?”
They have these half conversations, something riding underneath the initial conversation. He seems to think this is the only way they can talk. She aches with the subtext, wants to just wrap her hands around him some days and say,
he thinks.
"Boss," FRIDAY whispers in his ear. "I've sent a helicopter to your location."
, he thinks as he watches her hands shake in the grainy footage.  That’s not strain, that’s something else.
“He never slept much,” Rhodey admits, and that’s about all they can get out of him.  Steve doesn’t try because he knows he’s being iced out.  He saw that one coming months ago.
"Jesus, you have to be kidding me. That's against the Accords. They should be in a cell in the Terrorism Centre in Vienna awaiting trial."
“We don’t have time to think about this,” he replies, finally, as he shakily stands.  “We need to get out there. Where is he, Shuri?”
Steve leans back for a moment, and Tony watches him carefully.  “No but,” Steve says.  “I love you
Her eyes soften.  “As much as it breaks mine to leave you.  You always make me proud dearest. And no matter what your father leaves unsaid, he loves you.  He just can’t put it into words, like most American men.”
“So you haven’t asked,” Bruce sighs.  “Tony.”
“I’m taking these upstairs and going to breathe fresh air. Let me know if you need anything,” he calls over his shoulder as he leaves.
"Steve?" Tony calls.
“Fuck you,” he says across the table where Steve stands there, mask on and judging him.  “If you knew how to open your mouth and say some real goddamn words instead of ‘oh you’re making decisions for us’, we wouldn't be in this goddamn mess.  If you had fucking said something we could have avoided the whole Germany fight.”
No stupid question.  Ignore me
"You want to go change?" He nods at the horribly creased suit.  The jacket was tossed on a counter hours ago, and the tie had been thrown on the floor from where DUM-E had rescued it, carefully draping it on the counter with the jacket on Friday's soft commands shortly after Bruce has arrived.
Steve held his silence, and in the end, it’s all he has.)
But he had seen the way his father had spent every summer looking for Captain America, like it was his personal crusade.  Like he loved the man more than he loved his wife or son. The way Peggy had held Howard’s hand on the anniversary, both too fragile for anyone else to be included - Maria and  Daniel hovering outside the door, Jarvis besides them, waiting to be included but knowing this was their grief that they couldn’t share all of, except with each other.
“You won’t win,” Tony bites out in between gasps for breath.
. The shield coming down again, and again; then raised above Steve’s head, eyes cold and dark and desperate.
“Okay, so I’ve been thinking about threading on a PCB and like, maybe I should do this manually, but - ”
“It’s nice,” Steve utters as he pushes himself off the couch.  “To have someone to talk to and not just think about everything.”
“What did you model it after?”
They fall through history and time. There is a second when the machine fails, and they are thrown out too far in the past.
"Okay," he lies.
They work in silence for hours, Tony going a mile a minute, manic and too tired but not.  He's in his suit, has probably been in the lab since he came back from the event Pepper had dragged him to last night.  The one he had grumbled about to Rhodey as the man made dinner.  Spiderman had squeaked something when the event name had been mentioned, but Bruce had missed it.  Tony had promised to bring them all back a swag bag.  They had had dinner, Tony disappeared to get dressed, Spidey jumped out a window and Vision did the dishes while Bruce rearranged everything in the fridge.
JARVIS doesn’t reply.
Steve leans into his space, and Tony doesn’t flinch, not exactly, but he pulls back.
It’s two days later when he starts hallucinating Steve.
“Palladium almost kills me,” he finally says, just enough to open a door to let Howard know it’s worth it.  It’s not enough to break all the future. Just enough to have him keep his eyes open.
Steve’s lips are pressed together tightly.  “Okay,” he nods. He is tense and serious. “When are you heading out?”
“Did you ever talk to Wanda about it?”
"I can't," he starts and then stops. Struggles to find a way to say, every big plan I've ever had has fallen apart on me.
"Love you," Tony whispers. It's been seven months since the hospital room, but hearing the words still make Steve's heart pound.
He keeps circling through scenarios until he can find one he can live with.  One that others will live in.
A lightning bolt comes from the sky and Thor directs it to Thanos who has the gauntlet outstretched, and the blue fades to nothing against him.  Thor throws another, and then another, and yet another, all the while, Thanos calmly neutralizes each one.
Ask kid
"Me?  Recommending someone use words.  Pot meet kettle."
“Tell me something I would only know,” she throws back as she crosses her arms, gun still held tightly in grip.
He keeps his mouth shut and the silence hangs between them for a long time.
She mouths something, he can’t hear it before the face shrinks until FRIDAY is standing there, a person.  The words “Stark Expo 2305 coming soon” appear beside her. Tony stills, thoughts completely missing in action as he stares out at the window.  FRIDAY cocks her hip and leans against the words and winks at him.
Steve ends up working on that secret smile for the next hour.)
“They’re different,” Steve says finally, carefully making sure not to say
Barnes and Steve work as they always have, playing off each other’s weak points, reckless with their own health but not with the other’s.  Tony’s absently sent a few missiles their way to cover them when necessary.
"Any one who has not signed the Accords is, at this point in time, in direct conflict with the Accords, as long as they are in a country aligned with the United Nations, and all citizens are charged with trying to help bring those persons to justice. No one more so than me, considering I was one of the first Avengers to sign. Did you know it was part of the Accords is that you are beholden to UN committee to try and apprehend anyone in a UN country?" He paused and took in his audience, "Oh, I see some confused faces. It's somewhere on page 497 on that novel. But as long as the persons are on a negotiating list with the UN, they're safe. Like Spiderman."
"I can ask Nat to replace me if that's what you want," Steve states, surprisingly steady.
Steve nods and waves, heading out the door.  Tony crashes down with the next wave of pain, eyes shutting as he goes to the ground until it dissolves and then reforms.
Tony lets Steve carve out some time for him to straighten himself up and put the book down to look Tony seriously in the eyes even though he’s carefully avoiding look in his direction and throws, “I’ve learned my lesson Cap. No more robots. You’re free to go.”
“What?” Tony asks.  “Too much information?  Not enough? I’m running out of time here?”
But yeah. Thanks for this. This is everything I have ever wanted to do.
lapsed Catholic things he does from time to time.  Tony puts a lid on the nervous energy he has rattling around him after the whole Peter thing as best he can.  Tony reaches out and laces his fingers with Steve's.
“Excuse me?” Tony says as T’Challa chuckles.  “Tony Stark, meet my sister Princess Shuri of Wakanda.”
and the splash of pasta sauce as it hits his face before he throws parm at Steve and Peter's helpless laughter as he asks,
"No," Tony's tone is tense. "
Rhodey starts laughing as Bruce turns to Tony and says, incredulous, “Are you calling me old?”
Steve pauses for a moment, still processing that Tony still, still loves him. That he said it aloud and just when Tony’s face begins to dim, Steve thinks
With time, the light eases and he begins to open his eyes.  Tony then blinks a few times before he can see something beyond the fluorescent bulbs in the room.  It looks like the Triskelion, the one he visited once, with his father when it was still being built.  The bulletproof windows see out to the New York Skyline, Stark Tower in the distance.
Steve sighs and looks upwards, the
It eases from the early Avengers in their costumes to a model of them all sitting the manor, laughing and throwing popcorn at each other.  Clint has a bandage over his nose, like he always did, Jan’s young and face soft as she leans in on Hank - both still have their rings. “It’s great Tony,” Steve says finally.
The first time, he opens his eyes to see ice, frozen and eons of cold.  He can’t breathe, but that doesn’t panic him. He feels like he is treading underwater, limbs anchored down and he’s slowly falling - even though he’s not moving.  The few thoughts he can string together in the darkness and steady blankless he is in in that moment is,
He had tinkered with it - once.  Pulled down the equations and the schematics that had been hidden in dust.  A single blood sample that was suspiciously never labeled but under various locks and key.  The DNA patterns didn’t match him or his family, but it had matched Michael’s in varied ways.
Rhodey turns on the engine.  “I feel like celebrating.  Where do we want to do lunch?”
, Tony thinks idly.
When his hands are empty and so is the stack, Tony picks up the phone again. He reads the text and replies. It buzzes back instantly. He responds a few more times, the vibrating sound ringing in his ears, louder with every texts. Then he stops and powers down the phone.
"You're right Vision," Rhodey says. "So the Tower?"
“Tomorrow,” Yinsen replies.  “Just do as they ask. It will make it easier.”
The girl watches him closely for a moment before tilting her chin and saying, “He’s here - outside of the forcefield, but his army is banging on it enough for the power to be dropping.  Rapidly.”
Tell me if you need me.
She rushes him, hands around his waist before he can think.  He’s stiff at first, and the watch beeps.  He takes in a few breathes before he relaxes and pats her arm hesitantly.  “You’re welcome.”  Rihan pulls back abruptly, blush turning into a sunburnt shade.  “Let me know if you need anything else,” he says to both of them.
We don’t owe each other anything.
“It’s about your parents,” Steve finally utters.
“I loved you,” Tony says.  He feels reckless when he says the words.  Like he’s cutting himself open and showing everything he has left.  The few secrets he has left open to the world. This is it. The last few things.
Steve laughs a little bit helplessly before he tries to explain exactly where everything has gone sideways or changed.  It’s been a long two years.
Tony likes those mornings best.
Tony bites back a grin.  “You kept bitching about the training room in the Tower, so I decided to build an entire training field.  You like it?”
Draft reply to 54985-466-8653
“Thank you Dr. Banner.”
Coulson tilts his head, studying her. “We don’t need to break him.”
The frenzied feeling from early is still there, but sated for the moment. Raises his arm when Steve pulls his shirt off, naked and fully bared to a dressed Steve, but isn’t he always?
(“It’s in a tattoo,” Steve tells him later.  “They use it to help interact with wearables.  About 100 years back they were doing patches but we evolved into tattoos once you are over the age of 16.  I don’t know all the details, but we can find you some literature if you want to learn more.
“Galaxy wide peace,” Steve returns cheekily.
“Tony?” Steve asks.
“I say used to because I don’t know you,” Tony shrugs, eyes going to the window.  He’s carefully avoiding eye contact. “Not any more. Sometimes I think everything I knew died the moment I went under the ice.”
He shrugs before taking a bite.  “Two men, two women, two non binary genders, two penguins.  Any mix of those, except the penguins because marrying animals are not okay,” Tony pauses.  “I know you guys had gay men in the 40’s, so what’s going on here.”
"Steve," he barely says, before Steve applies a little pressure, and Tony feels it all the way to his toes. "Oh God," he gasps out, half prayer, half curse as the fingers drift again, moving up, stroking in circles as they go. They got higher and higher until Steve’s fingers curl around the zipper and pull it down as Tony fumbled with the button of his jeans. Steve reaches in, stroking Tony’s cock through the thin cotton of his boxer briefs.
He hadn't been but still argues the point.  She lets him for a moment, remind him of all the dates and how it had hurt.  They've talked about this before, eons ago, a lifetime ago.  He's apologized but now it's just a story of their past.
Now all we have left is why Steve can't handle Tony ever speaking these days, Thantos, and the end of the world. :)
Tony straightens.  “I need to drill holes into my circuit board to see if it works.”
The TV is blaring as Tony and Bruce argue points about the nanobots.  Rhodey is sitting on the couch in jeans and a faded Air Force shirt, upping the volume every time Tony gets antagonistic about the testing phase.
There is a small smile on tiny Steve’s face.  “They say it’s low chance I make it.”
The other version of him, the one who hasn't lived through the snap and all those hours in the lab where he and Tony had relearned each other, meets his eyes for a second before they take off running.
He cleans the countertop for a moment before he looks back up to Steve.  “Did you know Jarvis taught me this recipe?” he says instead. Steve watches him before shaking his head. “It was my mother’s, and her grandmothers before it, but she taught it to Jarvis years before I was born.  I didn’t learn it until after she died.”
The gallows humor doesn’t play so well, especially when Rhodey sighs heavily and murmurs, “don’t” fiercely in his ear.
“Visit,” Spidey replies as he perches on the stainless steel table beside Tony.  “And it looks like you have version 2 specs.  I
The room is dark without the simulation up and running. Friday turns on the lights as he moves through the room. He's a ghost workshop. The little light from the moon illuminates the place on the table where the shield lays, half under some rag that Tony isn't sure he threw or if one of the slumbering robots tossed.
They stay there for a long moment before Tony pulls back.  He feels Steve’s lips, rough and chapped, against his hairline for second before dismissing the thought.
The entire scenario is familiar, like the battle of New York with a more evenly distributed force.  One down, another two in their place, and as long as you don’t get overrun, you’re okay. It’s easy, almost, after Ultron and fighting each other.  But Tony suspects that’s because Thanos has been holding at the back, watching, silent as they fight his foot soldiers.
Bruce makes a disapproving noise in his throat.  “I want a lot of things.  But right now, I want you to let me share the burden.  I’m here Tony.”
Tony rolls his eyes, “Of course the future still has gossip blogs.  What else would everyone be speculating about idly?”
And he can feel it in his belly, something beginning to tug on his navel.  It’s getting more painful as every minute passes. The humming rises in pitch, sounding more like angry bees than a song.
He gets Tony to the med bay in time.
, Steve thinks.
T’Challa smiles.  “You were honest with me, and I knew it cost you much to give me that much knowledge.  I want to be honest with you.”
Falcon drops in, missing a Black Widow and tackles the assailant.  He uses the love bite again, and the man passes out.  He wrestles the unconscious man into cuffs and leaves him face down in the dirt as he moves to Steve.  Wanda’s already there, energy holding pressure to the wound as she floats him.  Steve is smiling gratefully at her, and Sam grabs his arm.  Steve smiles at him, murmuring something.  The trio moves quickly down the street and the camera loses them again.
Again, thank you everyone for reading this so far. Comments, kudos and bookmarks are love.  (Also how do you guys keep finding this story?  The numbers for this thing get interesting upswings.)
, before the helicopter comes up, side open and he neatly falls into the open seat. It's jarring, don't get him wrong, but it at least gets him in something moving. He places the shield in the seat beside him, and presses the button on the center console to remove the suit. It melts away, and he has to take too cold breathes that nearly cause him to hyperventilate.
the one about no sex in the labs is totally my fault.
"Is that a Black Widow joke?  Oh my god, JARVIS tell me you have that recorded," Tony cries as he looks to the ceiling.
“I believe all your ‘children’ consider you their mother,” Vision retorts mildly.  “Dr. Banner is my father in this scenario.”
“Who did you bet for?” Tony asks, ignoring the memories rearing up at the pressure on his chest..
He blasts the Skrull who ducks behind it’s shield.  It crumples a little bit - not vibranium, Tony thinks with a dark grin.  At least they hadn’t gotten that detail right. “Tony!” the fake Cap calls out.  “Tony it’s me!”
The Hulk is covering the ground behind him, and when he roars, Tony can feel the earth shake underneath his feet.
“You’re on Red.”
“Coming out of the ice does something like that,” Steve comments blandly, like he knows Tony is on the precipice of something in this moment.
He spends the rest of the flight back listening to Rhodey tell him about his hospital adventures.
Peter sighs.  “Well, things change around here a lot, and I was just thinking there might be a day when I’m not welcome and I wanted to make sure I had some back up plans.”
Her gun comes down a little bit.  “What are you doing here?” She asks, testly.
Eventually, Steve paints Tony the way Tony looked at him. Fond and happy, across the lab. Back in the days before Steve could find words, with parts of the suit strung out around him, and if Steve closes his eyes, he can hear JARVIS and Tony arguing.
After about the 5th one, Thanos’ face twists.  The purple stone lights up on the gauntlet, and then Thor is outstretched, like Strange was.  Tony gets to actions and sets the pods backup and dives in like is is going for the gauntlet. Thanos dodges, but loses his grip on Thor, whose arm Tony grabs and pushes out as fast as he can.
Her eyes narrow, and she opens her mouth to ask
He gets that, then tries to move into the organic and inorganic matter mix that this century has decided to embrace wholeheartedly.  It’s the mixture of chemistry and biology with a side of engineering that gets him.
Tony puts down the tablet and drifts into the kitchen.
Steve pulls a shirt over his head before he responds, “Something like that.”
"You gonna ask?" Tony asks him, once.  The chip is handed off, the treadmill pieces are being built in the lab, and now he's poking around trying to find another project.  So instead he's hijacking Steve's comms during a low level "whatever this new division of SI, er, the Avengers thing because you know,
Steve steps into the hug and for a moment clings too tight to Tony, but he’s holding Steve just as tightly before he steps back.  Tony lets him fall back but keeps close into his space. They walk the empty rooms, looking at the artwork.
He cuts her off, and Nat doesn't deserve it, but Steve can't let her say the words out loud.
"Jarvis," he calls, voice young and breaking. Tony looks down at his younger self, and has a hard time looking at the kid.  He doesn't know what his life is going to be like, how he is going to disappoint everyone. How he is going to disappoint himself.  It’s hard to look at himself and see hope in his eyes.
Yes!!!  How about after work on Friday?
Tony is sitting in the open area in the Tower, in diffidence to Rhodey and his request that he keep Tony in his eye line since Tony (
“Yeah,” Tony nods.  “Nothing’s been changed.  If you down, your floor will be opened for you by FRIDAY. We had it sealed off when you went on vacation. Oh say hi FRIDAY.”
Tony shrugs, "Still. I want to make sure I can fulfill all the requirements."
Bucky had looked him in the eye, after, and said, “You need to make your peace in order to live.”  His eyes had gone darker, and his voice had become stilted, like it had been, before Tony had neutralized the threat of the Winter Soldier.  “This is going to eat you alive Steve.”
“But you’ve always been better at the science,” Tony shrugs.  “I’ve been better at the engineering.”
Tony takes hit after hit until he can’t see that smirk any more.
Tony feels like he is running on an empty tank, but that’s nothing new.  He flexes his right hand before balling it up in a fist a few times. Carol’s been eyeing him since before they got on the plane.  She knows him too well some days.
“I am not my silver tongued cousin,” Death sings, and something in Tony rattles.  It sings deep in him. The same pulsing ache that reached out when Wanda reached into him and gripped.  “I gave you an achievable task. Can you not feel the missing pieces here? You are still too blind Thanos, and I will not have someone so weak by my side.”
When he wakes again, he doesn’t remember anything he dreamed about at all.
But that’s all Steve hadn’t seen in that moment in Manhattan.  All he caught sight of was the similarities to Howard. Maybe it was a little smoother around the edges, but all Howard Stark.
Tony starts into a wakefulness. "Got it Fry," he groans. He pushes himself up and the armor adjusts to help him. The noise it makes is audible, which is never a good sign for the status of the suit,
100%?
"Have you made a friend?" Jarvis asks, hopeful. Older Tony, current Tony, feels his chest tighten at the expression. Jarvis had always has such a hopeful optimism when it came to Tony's future and what he would become one day. He wonders if Jarvis still has one, watching from up there.
There is a sixth shot that has Cap flinching and making himself smaller before the camera jerks.  Wanda floats down from a nearby building, sniper in tow.  Cap comes out from his spot and smiles at her, waving when the next gunshot rings out.
Bruce had been real, once.
"I haven't seen you in person in a while," she replies when she finally pulls back. Her eyes shine.  "You look good."
He sees Steve walking away on a snow covered mountain, thinking,
He tells Tony the stories he barely remembers.  His mother falling asleep at the edge of his bed, carefully holding his hand just so she could feel his pulse.  The way Bucky would wake him up in the middle of the night, afraid he had stopped breathing for a moment.
Maybe it was something more, and oh god, wouldn’t that be something.
“My prime directive is to provide any insight about your health, mental or physical when necessary,” she returns promptly.
“He’s just a child, and they are only stories Maria,” Ana replies, evenly. “And if you can’t think of him as a child, then -”
“It’s eating me alive.” He tells instead.  “It’s worse than the palladium because I can’t fix this.  This is just me.  Broken.”
“Not if I get there first.” She retorts.
He sees Steve and Natasha and his desperate hope.  Maybe he could get everything.
"It's better than what SHIELD had," Steve mutters and Tony mock gasps.
They get into an argument in the middle of a strategy session.  It’s loud and angry, and Tony finally throws out a jagged, “At least you’re honest with how much you hate me now.  It’s nice to see that out in the open.”  Bucky has to hold him back from reaching out to Tony.  Rhodey stands in the middle, firm when he utters, “We should take a break.”
Tony jerks when Bruce reaches out to his stiff form.  “Today we have seen a fleet of suicide bombers in the country,” she continues.  Tony and Bruce migrate to the couch.  He perches on the seat beside Peter, bookmarking the kid with Rhodey.  Bruce curls up in an oversized arm chair, his old favorite from the days of old.  “But it looks like the Secret Avengers are on the scene here today.”  Her face gets serious.  “Be advised, this is life footage and will most likely have footage that young children should not view.”
So he haunts the hallways, wandering around the maze of the building until it’s familiar again.  It’s during one of these walk abouts, he finds the new lab.  There is a hologram of a prosthetic arm, similar to Bucky’s, floating between Shuri and Tony, both poking it and a list of notes being added besides it.
But, it hangs there between them, and Steve knows it's too late.
Tony.
“Why Ross though?” Bruce finally asks.  “You could have gone with anyone else.”
It was Bucky
“Yeah,” Tony said faintly. “It depends on the day.”
,” he reads aloud.  “They are all, one way, lost to us…”
“We have to work under the assumption Thanos can sense the powers of the stones somehow,” Strange returns.  “If he has come to Earth, to Wakanda, he can detect them on some level. And while I could pass off the stone, I don’t know if the others can say they can.”
“Yeah,” Steve replies.
They shake hands, and Tony nods before walking away.  “You should come visit Wakanda,” T’Challa calls.  Tony stops and turns.  “I believe you would love my country with the same fierceness I do.”
Tony hums.  “There were others.”
"Tony, Tones. Stay with me buddy."
The sputtering in his boots jars him, and it’s barely half a second after he realizes what is happening that he goes down.  The Skrull grapples with him, grabbing onto him and throwing a punch. It’s skin has turned green, so he doesn’t have to look Steve in the eye as he punches it.  They roll, Tony struggling to disarm the skull as it wraps it’s legs around Tony’s waist and brings the shield down on his mask.
“Okay,” Steve echoes. They both smile, and for the first time in a long time, it feels like they are on the same page
"Stop talking," Tony bites at him, meeting his eyes for the first time since Steve went down.  "The medics are going to be here in a second."
“Always,” Tony replies and takes hold of the greener version of his hand.
"Tony? Dear what is wrong?" She crosses the room in a heartbeat and folds herself beside him against the window seat. Shadows play across her face, making her cheeks look gaunt and older than she is in this moment.
“Me too,” he says, and it’s like he’s softened while she has been lost in her memories. “I think you’re all going to be what kills me.” He says it like it’s a new realization, like he gets it as he speaks the words. It’s a newborn thought, one shared between the two of them but it’s out in the world, and it’ll gain speed one day. It’ll be sentient and used against the both of them. But here, in this moment before that. It’s everything. It’s real honesty between them.
[6] (Hausa) Literal translation of the phrase: For the news of the heart one should ask the face. (Hausa is what the official linguist said to use for now.  Sounds like they may use similar phrases or put twists on them for official Wakanda dialect.)
“The only one good enough for Ana Jarvis is standing over there,” Peggy responds firmly.  She grabs the flask out of his hands and takes another sip for herself.  She winces.  “That’s too cheap for your usual.”
He settles into the lab quietly, and is gratified when Tony doesn't look up.  He continues muttering, fingers flying, as he speaks to FRIDAY.  Bruce starts on his own work, mapping the neuro-passages of the example brain Tony had given him.  There is something wrong about this, and Bruce has a feeling about that too.  He can bring it to the forefront of his brain, can't let himself think about it too hard.  Doesn't want to know it.  Doesn't want to acknowledge it, have to figure out what this means.
“Michael?” She gasps, and Tony hasn’t seen her this wrecked before.  “Michael is alive?”
in her voice.  He narrows his eyes, noticing there isn’t a bit of the familiar red glow on her person.  It’s familiar almost, the presence there, and if he thinks to hard, he can feel the sea of memories in the back of his mind begin to swell up, churning and trying to drag him in.
The other man is pursuing footage from the fight on one of the monitors twenty feet away from Tony.   They both stay silent as Scott Lang burst onto the scene, larger than life on the tarmac of the German airport.  Spiderman rears back in the background, as Lang grabs onto Rhodey's leg.  There is a pause as Vision comes into view before Lang tosses Rhodey.  Spiderman scrambles to catch Rhodey, a truck goes flying, but they miss the plane before redirecting.
Tony pauses for a moment.  He remembers what it was like in the early days.  Just trying to keep everything under control.  One mission to the next. “We can do this tomorrow too.  Unless something is broken.”
He turns back, because Steve should have to hear this, have to face him.  “I could have bought another plane!  But no, I had to fix a goddamn airport because you wouldn’t say any actual words!”
“The DOL is leveling a lawsuit around overtime infraction against Stark Industries, and the chairman has been having more one on one meetings with Tony than the actual CEO of SI, Pepper. The adviser is working with a Senator Hurt who is still looking into the Ultron incident since it started in a facility in the United States. They’ve already levied fines against Tony, but they are looking into ways to do jail time."
"Oh," Tiny Tony hums, turning the thought over in his head. "That makes sense."
“Yes sir.”
As Steve watches Tony argue math with FRIDAY, he hopes so.
“Tony, even mind control couldn't stop you once you were on a mission.”
They circle, waving at him as he slowly descends.  It takes a moment, but he sees all the former weaknesses they’ve worked out over the years in the gym and through simulations.  He meets their eyes and sees the sincere belief they are who they are. That he’s there to help them.
"Please do," Steve hisses as a blow hits his shield.
“I think there are many stories we never shared with you dearest.  You know I was a spy during the war, correct?” She smiles softly at the shake of his head.  “Ah, of course your father would never want to tell you that. I was a spy, but for the wrong side.  He and the SSR caught me and gave me the option to turn on my country or go to jail.”
Tony leans in close to Peter right before the barrier goes down.  “Remember kid,” he quickfire says. “This makes you a 100% genuine article Avenger now.”
“Is the glove thing new?” she asks.  He pauses before noticing the two black gloves Tony has covering his hands as he sketches something out before Shuri breaks out in helpless laughter.
(See the end of the chapter for
Strange tightens his jaw.  “The stones burn too brightly.  Any host or user burns with it until they are a husk.  Or dead. Whichever comes first.”
It had been Howard Stark’s most memorable moment in the war.  Not the bombs, or the guns, or the planes. He has been remembered for the man he had made into Captain America for those in the know, and for years, decades, he had been asked if he could replicate the process.  If Tony could create his own generation of super soldier for his country.
Tony looks in their direction with an incredulous,
Steve looks different than the silent one that followed him around for months, bearded, blonder - but just as silent.  Just as observant as the other one.
,” he says after the burn clears his throat.  His sun glasses are perched firmly on his face, but when Peggy turns, it’s like she can see straight through them to his red and wild eyes.
