“Going to come, h-honey, you there?” Tony speaks against his lips, breathes the words into his mouth, they're so close together, as close as they can possibly be, Tony's chest sweating against his, his knees pressed up against Steve's ribs, nails digging perfect half moon crescents into his ass. He wonders if there will be scratches there he can look at later, signs that he pleased Tony, that he made this feel good enough that Tony clutched at him that tightly.
“He's been working too hard, I can tell.” Steve says against the top of his head, and Tony's too sleepy to really grouse about that right now.
“My butler, but he’s family, so what do you think, should I tell him it’s a success?”  Iron Man asked, rocking a little bit on his heels in a movement that asked for approval.  Steve wondered how the guy could be uncertain when He’d just offered Steve the nicest place he’d ever stayed in.  Two weeks ago he had been sleeping in a tent in the woods, and Steve told him so.  He just brushed it off, saying it was not a big deal, and showed him the door to his bathroom, his own private bathroom.
“Yeah, that would definitely hold up in court.”  He answers, after a long pause, he's looking at Steve curiously, or maybe a little like a kindred spirit.
“Gonna make a mess, that's not regulation.” Steve mutters, only to cut off in a moan when both of Tony's hands wrap around his cock.
“Is Steve awake?” Tony all but croaks, giving up on the state of his clothes and going over to grab a spare set out of his lab closet. Technically he could live down here for weeks and never emerge, but he's trying something new.
“That's amazing Mister Stark, the guys with Polio back in my day-they sure would have appreciated you, I know I sure woulda.” Steve wishes he was a little more smooth.  God knows Bucky had tried to teach him a thing or two, but at least his fumbling seems to give Tony pause.  He purses his lips, stacking his tablets together and regarding Steve with a slow searching look.
“Sorry Hap, come get Steve's motorcycle, sending you the location now, can't talk, gotta go.” He fires off rapidly, power walking over to an empty alley, waiting for his own ride. JARVIS does not disappoint. Within moments the armor lands, metal peeling back to let him in, and then closing up in a snug embrace. The armor's built in powercells dim on the screen as the Arc takes over all the heavy lifting.
Awareness comes back to him in waves. Sound eddies around him as though he's still underwater. There is a cushion beneath his back, bright lights above him paint the insides of his lids with warm rosy colors. Strange, he doesn't remember descriptions of the afterlife including the smell of disinfectant. His body feels heavy, blood pooling in his limbs as if he's been still for far too long. There should be grittiness to his eyelids, but they feel smooth and clean, as if someone had dabbed at them with a cloth. A steady beeping sound sings along with what he knows to be his own heartbeat somewhere to the left. His fingers tingle, and it hits him with sudden crystal clarity that he is not dead at all. As if to drive that point home the muffled sound of voices trickles into his range of hearing.
“Oh. Should I
“Widow, we need that information.” Steve says, all business, but his eyes are locked with Tony's.
“I like that it's heavier Tony. Feels substantial.” He says, undeterred by Tony's continued besmirching of his old uniform.  Tony cuts off mid rant, finger half jabbed into the air for effectiveness in delivering his tirade against the horrors of last century superhero attire.  “Thank you. You're wonderful.” He says, and he means it.  Tony looks away, hands drumming along the lab table nervously. Steve stares at his hands, and suddenly everything makes perfect sense.  It's a nervous gesture so like Iron Man's that first day Steve woke up in this strange new world. An empty suit. Bruises with an explanation that just seems phoned in. Tony exhausted and aching but still working, funding the Avengers through his own pockets. Tony keeping untold secrets close, brown eyes wide and filled with something unspeakable in the hallway, leaning away from Steve's arms instead of into them. If it's true then Steve's in more trouble than he already thought he was.
“J-Jurvisss” He slurs, dragging his hand out from beneath warm layers of sweatshirt and gingerly rolling himself over. A bad decision, if the pain it knocks through his bruised ribs is anything to go by.
“This is the last marshmallow, you want it?” Steve asks, gingerly pulling the slightly charred confection from his wire hanger-it's nice to see some things don't change.
“What you said back there. About me. About-” Tony stutters slightly, eyes darting around. Steve just takes his hand, giving it an encouraging squeeze. “loving me. I know those stories make you uncomfortable, and I don't blame you. I wouldn't want to be linked to me either-gossip rags have always made stuff up about me, I'm sorry they're telling lies about you too now. Price for being around me I guess.” Tony looks so down on himself that Steve just lets it slip out without thinking twice.
“Hey.” Tony says, poking Steve in the chest. “Even if you didn't know how to uh 'smooch', that's okay too, nothing wrong with inexperience.” He's just about to go off on a rant about toxic hypermasculinity and the notion that men have to be ready and raring to go; when Steve starts walking them backwards.
his sternum,
“You're such a dork, I swear, fucked my soul out of socket and then you say shit like that.” Tony grumbles against Steve's lips.
“C'mon Tony, what's this about? Did something happen? Did that Hammer asshole call you or something?” Steve is getting a frankly murderous glint in his eyes. Tony can't help but laugh, it seems the name 'Hammer' is perpetually attached to asshole in Steve's mind.
“That a yes sweetheart, gonna make an honest man out of me?” He whispers, kissing all over Tony's face, laughing when Tony bats at him and kicks his legs to be put down. Steve just holds him, kissing his cheek until he answers.
“I'm sorry I didn't mean to upset you.” Steve says hurriedly. He never could handle it when women cried, when anyone cried, truth be told, and he doubts he could handle it now. With the way he's feeling it might set him off too, and that would just be embarrassing.
“I'm fine, I can get past this.”  He knows it’s not the forties anymore-that people won’t look down at him for speaking with a therapist, but the forties weren’t that long ago for him.  It’s difficult to shake the notion that someone like him ought to lock everything up tighter than a bank vault.
“If I might say sir, you are always quite fancy, have we exceeded a particular baseline?” JARVIS snarks, and Tony just points at the flowers pinned to his lapel with an expansive gesture.
“Booyah.”  He said, holding his fist out for Steve to bump.
“Alright, you alright?” Steve asks, stilling his fingers, and slipping them out. Tony shivers all over, sliding his hands over Steve's chest, his shoulders, and then back up to comb through his hair. He's smiling though, flushed and just as aroused as Steve.
Tony's heart is pounding away, Steve can hear it, can hear the steady beating of it, the way sounds rumble up through his chest. Tony gasps, groans, the hand in his hair gentling, stroking there almost reverently, and Steve presses his face more firmly against Tony's skin, feeling out of his body almost, and so hot, and melting, and gone with the praise spilling from Tony's lips.
The new punching bag seems to taunt him with its wholeness, and Steve would feel kind of sheepish about how many of them he's destroyed, but Tony just seems impressed by the carnage. Steve slumps over to his water bottle where it sits on a long bench and taking a long swig. After emptying and refilling the bottle he goes to stand in front of the heavy bag again, fists raised in preparation. Before he can land his first punch however, the distant sound of music gives him pause. Steve cocks his head, listening as the first hesitant strains become more confident.
“Don't worry, I'll keep them from harassing him too much. Only I get his guns now.” Rhodes says with a wide smile. Tony finally removes his coffee cup from his mouth and takes the Colonel's hand with a dramatic flourish.
“It doesn’t, really, I can take it.”  He said, determined to show her he was alright, that she didn’t need to worry.  If anything his answer only seemed to put that look on her face she got when he told her he wanted a hot dog instead of his vegetables.
He blazes bright in the darkness always, but there is something in his eyes today, something raw and hopeless, and terrible. Steve watches his soulmate sink down into that swirling frigid water. He wants to drag him out, to hold him and plead with him, but he can only call to him, desperation clogging up his throat and making his voice hoarse.
That seems to have stunned Tony into momentary speechlessness. He throws his arms around Steve's neck, kissing him even as they stumble from the building into their waiting limo. Steve ends up half carrying, half dragging him into the vehicle as Tony does his concerted best to scale him like a tree. He lands on his back on the plush leather with a soft 'oof', finally parting from Steve to stare up at him with wide dilated eyes.
sign around his neck. Probably.
smelled like, close to the skin. God that was inappropriate, Steve winced, shoving that thought away with grim determination.  He was supposed to go shopping with the team, that was not the time to begin one of his guilty fantasy marathons about his friend and teammate.
“We have had this discussion before Shellhead, like I said-” Steve reaches up, curling his hand around the back of Tony's neck to bring their foreheads together. “Anytime.” He lets his voice drop an octave, and Tony licks his lips, pressing all along his body in a way that makes Steve almost forget that they're currently in public. That reality reasserts itself with the high pitched sound of what sounds like a child doing her level best so scream her tiny lungs out. Tony jerks back, head twisting around to seek the source of the noise-coming to a stop when he spots a little girl sitting in the snow next to the kicked over remains of a snowman.
One of Steve's big hands comes up to cradle the back of his head, and then Tony's world shifts as Steve flips them so that Tony's pressed against the back of the couch. Their legs tangle together, Tony throwing an arm around Steve's neck to try and get as close as possible. It's similar to that night sleeping in front of the fireplace, the closeness, the warmth-it burns hotter though, makes the swoop of arousal vibrant and real until Tony is panting into the kiss. Steve is half leaning over him, covering Tony's body with his, kissing him as if it's the only thing that matters. Their mouths part for a moment, Steve leaning their foreheads together and breathing into the space between them.
“You said.” Steve forces out. “You said you had them too.” He says, feeling terrible and ashamed of his own reactions to something as innocuous as cold mountain air.  Iron Man stills, dropping down into a crouch next to Steve with a mechanical whirring of servos.
“Call me Fido.” He said seriously. Tony frowned, then sat forward, leaning closer to Steve, blue eyes searching.
He doesn't know how long Tony writhes atop him and kisses him, whispering sweet things and moaning while he opens himself up. Steve's concept of time is usually so accurate, each minute ticking by in Steve's awareness. Time hardly seems to matter now though, Steve lets it spin out without notice, loses it to the way Tony is moving atop him, the sounds he makes, the scent of him, the wet heat of Tony's mouth when he kisses him, the way it feels to have Tony blanketing him here on the bed. Distantly he realizes he's moaning near continuously, kissing any skin Tony offers to him, he can't find it in himself to be self conscious though; everything feels too good, and he wants Tony to hear him, hear how much he wants him always.
“Don't go ask Stephen Strange to strip me naked with magic.” Steve tries to make himself sound as commanding as possible. Tony's glance darts to the side, and he bites his bottom lip.
Happy knows the drill.
? Skintight black fabric clings to Tony's body like a second skin. Little nodes of light dance and blink over the whole thing. Beautiful, he's so beautiful. Steve is struck with the sudden burning desire to march over there, pick Tony up, and bite his thighs. It's a visceral reaction, arousal hitting him like a virtual punch to the gut.
Louder and louder, until he's standing in the doorway of a room he's visited a few times before-a smaller sitting room in dreamy pale tones. It's dark in the room, save for where the curtains have been thrown back to spill moonlight in long icy slats across a white grand piano and the figure sitting there. Tony is playing the piano. Of course he is. His eyes are closed, a dent between his brows as if he's concentrating intensely. Moonlight casts watery shadows over his features, catching on his lashes and making them glow.
“Hey!  I’m not a bug, stop that”  The voice sounded from somewhere by his left temple, then a shocked gasp, and the sound of metal against metal.  “He’s waking up, he really is alive, everyone, come quick!”
“Keen. I can't believe he said keen.” Iron man mutters under his breath, Steve ignores that too.
“Guess we better sleep.” Tony says from beside him, turning to lay his head fully on his pillow.
“Uh. When was our first one?” Tony asks, feeling a little slow on the uptake despite all evidence of being a genius.  Steve's eyes are twinkling at him in amusement. Wow, yeah Tony feels like he's definitely missing a puzzle piece here.
“Tony.”
Tony opens his mouth to say something probably crass, but then Steve's leaning in, mouthing over his jaw,
It's chaos, but it's organized chaos-and when Iron man flies down to stand at his back like a wall of metal and provide cover-well, Steve just breathes deep and lets himself feel alive. It turns out that joining the Avengers may be the only thing he's certain of in this world he's found himself in. That and that with all luck he will never have cause for Thor to smack him with that hammer. It looks terrifically painful.
Tony had emerged from the icebox with one of his horrible green smoothies, and was busily slurping away at it while sitting at the counter behind Steve.  He smiled around his straw when he noted Steve looking, but it seemed like he was in a hurry.  It looked like he was trying to do up the French cuffs on his shirt, and not having a whole lot of success.  Tony frowned, and then swore under his breath, as something tiny and round hit the floor and rolled.
He’s standing in a church. Bare feet cold on old, old wooden flooring. Somewhere a soaring choir sings, voices raised in a language he doesn’t know.  Tony can’t see them.  Hazy light filters in, casting long shadows across a figure bent over a coffin. Outside the water waits, swirling along the windows as if it wants to get in, but Tony pays it no mind. The statue of a woman dominates the room. Robed in white, she points to her heart, seven swords refract light, but her face is serene. Tony looks away from her-steps closer to the figure near the coffin, beneath his feet wood creaks, loud like a thunderclap.
Steve knew what he had to do, and he was nineteen now, there was no way the war effort would turn him away.  Except of course, they did.  One rejection turned into two, and two into three, until his list of rejections became almost as long as the lists his doctors furrowed their brows over when they thought he couldn’t see.  Steve didn’t quit though, he kept going back, kept striving.  If anything was an alpha’s purpose, then helping to stop the evil going on in Germany certainly had to be it.  It seemed like everyone was signing up, lines snaked around recruitment offices in long teeming ribbons of alphas and betas alike.  He was sure there were probably a few omegas in there too, although they were unlikely to be put on the front lines.  Omegas were too valuable, too rare, and their abilities were pivotal to keep their alpha and beta counterparts from losing themselves.  He’d heard of some omega soldiers in the past, but war was hard on them, their empathy and ability to both affect and be affected by emotion made them fearsome warriors if they so chose, but it also almost always destroyed them.
“Wait, wait.” Steve gasps, Tony's hand stills, eyes clenching shut. Steve doesn't make him wait long. Tony feels another drizzle of lube over his hole. Steve shifts behind him, sighing as he strokes himself slick, and then he's right
rude to even think of so he pushes that away.
"What is it Hawkeye?"  Steve sighs out.
“You have a bit of that look, yes, but I’m sure we can find something nice for your intended.” She seemed real sure about that.  Steve wished he had her certainty.
“Do you really think I need to go see a shrink?” Steve asks, watching the play of Tony's hair over his gloves as he strokes through the inky black strands.
“I want to stay right here, I want breakfast.  You. This, all of this.” Steve gets out, almost too forcefully in his haste to bring that soft smile back.  He takes one of Tony's hands, brings it back to press his face into Tony's palm. Nerves fizzle up in his stomach, fluttering there uselessly, hoping Tony won't laugh at him for how much he wants this, how much he's dreamed of having something like this.  No, this is better, this is real. When he opens his eyes, Tony is looking a little red in the face, gaze cast down, but that soft, warm, private smile is back on his face.
"A strong heart will take you further than any physical strength. A strong heart means you'll never quit, you always stand up, you remember that.”  She said, her hand rubbing slow and soothing circles over his back.
Tony looked good as ever, in fine trousers and a waistcoat so fitted, Steve was not surprised to see it laced up the back when he went to get breakfast from the icebox.  It was a pretty daring choice for an alpha to wear, but Steve liked it, hell, he loved it.  The way it hugged his body, the way the trousers emphasized his lush rear and thighs.  Steve swallowed, hurriedly looking down, it was rude to stare, and ruder still to be sitting there panting after his friend while he was just trying to get himself breakfast.
“I-If that were to happen. The pheromones or that kinda thing.” Steve looks away now, but Tony can't look anywhere
“Oh well, if it's a bet then.” Steve says, tucking himself down and launching out of the garage with a screech of tires on polished concrete. Tony whoops with laughter, warm and snug behind him as the bike eats up pavement and they cut through traffic at a speed just shy of reckless. Or it would be reckless without Steve's reflexes. Tony just urges him on, gleeful and more carefree than he usually ever is. Steve doesn't stop grinning until they make it out of the city limits, and the road stretches out in front of them in a long ribbon of pavement.
Hammer is in an orange SHIELD issue jumpsuit, looking far too chipper for a man whose company is coming apart at the seams. He watches their progress with a sly little smile, but Tony's eyes are sharp enough to catch the tiny tremor right at the corner of his lips when he catches sight of the armor.
“Hi,”  He said, turning to Steve, holding out his arm for Steve to clasp if he so chose, “we’re the Avengers, and someway, somehow, you must be Captain America.”
“Right. Of course. Okay, let's do this.” He taps on the window twice, stepping out into the blinding flash of cameras when Happy opens the door. Steve is right behind him, looking vaguely uncomfortable but still ready to throw a punch if anyone gets too close. The flashes start going off with even more intensity when JARVIS lands the armor behind them.
“What if I wanted to get a good look at your
“I can get you one.” Tony said, already wiggling his phone out of his pocket.
“Transformers,”  Jan said, she was tucked against Tony’s side, with Clint laying across them both.  She had a bowl of popcorn, and was resting it on Clint, occasionally throwing kernels into his mouth, which he caught surprisingly well.  Marksman, he thought fondly.
When they get to the compound Bucky is there, standing between them and the entrance to the building. Another ghost Steve can't forget, but at least he's alive. Still, Steve feels the breath freeze in his chest painfully when Bucky steps close.
in Clint's direction, and gets a very rude hand gesture accompanied by Clint signing out '
Not even five minutes later Steve answers back not with a text-but by striding into the lab looking like a man on a mission. Tony sits up on the cot to greet him, realizing belatedly that he's only in his short half shirt and a pair of leggings. Steve definitely notices too, but the look on his face is anything but displeased by what he sees. Tony freezes, the desire to cover himself with the blanket warring with the urge to say '
“Going to be okay Shellhead, you're alright, just a fancy pacemaker, you're okay, stay with me.” Tall blond and handsome says, stepping back but not away to allow the medical personnel to wheel him into the private room and start shining lights into his eyes and poking at his veins. Tony ignores that in favor of staring at his companions. All three of them look more than a little agitated, Tony feels the inexplicable urge to comfort them.
me, still not fair though.” He grouches, extricating himself from Steve's arms and pointing accusingly. “Help me put up the tent though, I refuse to do this alone.”
” The way he says magic is something akin to the tone of voice his mother had once taken when a neighborhood cat left a dead rat on the stoop of the building they lived in.
All of their work becomes needless when Hulk makes it to the scene; taking one look at The Gravitron and jumping up into the air to wrestle him to the ground. Gravity maps ripple, the focus of the distortion focusing on the Hulk, weighting he and the villain down, pavement cracks, but it's all over when Cap jumps into the fray-slogging through high gravity to knock Gravitron out with a painful looking shield strike to the head.
“Old! I'll show you
“I thought you were just like that with your friends, thought you were kidding when you...oh that's nice, touch me more mmm...” He all but purrs, pressing up into Steve's touches.  Steve chuckles, rubbing his knuckles over Tony's throat, his clavicles and the smooth scarring around the arc reactor. “when you flirted back.” He finishes, voice cracking when Steve rocks against him.
“Captain Rogers-” JARVIS says hesitantly.  “Sir was asking after you earlier, he heard of your predicament and was deeply concerned. It would seem you are not currently asleep so I thought it acceptable to bring to your attention.” JARVIS hasn't finished speaking before Steve is sitting up, swinging his legs over the side of the bed and rising to his feet.
“Yes, the game is tomorrow, I thought we would fly in to PVA, check into our hotel in Foxborough, you know, make sure we make it there on time.”  That was awfully luxurious, flying out someplace just to see a football game, even if it was in Massachusetts.
Tony’s jaw dropped, he sputtered a little.  “I slept!  I put the armor on auto-pilot and had a nice nap, I’ll have you know.”
“Oh, you're serious.” Tony whispers when Steve lets him up.
“Ooh I just bet he does.” Clint coos.
As if summoned by his train of thought they turn a corner and a man is waiting for them in the entryway to a smaller more comfortable looking sitting room than some of the others they have already passed.
“It almost got the arc, you would have been stuck then.” Steve says, patting over the armor as if somehow it will help him feel for injuries on the man within it.  Iron Man doesn't say anything, letting Steve pull him to his feet silently.
“Mhmm, yeah..hi there darling-” Tony says distractedly against Steve's lips, before what he said registers “wait, really?”
It's still a close thing however when Steve leans down, trails kisses over his neck, and whispers dirty praise in his ear. “You feel so good, so tight, god the way you're squeezing me, c'mon wanna feel you come-show me what I'm doing to you, let me feel how much you love it-” Usually it takes Tony longer to come than Steve, but today that is not going to happen.
Steve would like to know that
“I'm just along for the ride today, ask Cap when he gets here.”
He went and found the closet though, feeling more than a little furtive about it. He met no one else in the hallway however, carrying his new sheets back to his room, feeling a bit like he was on an espionage mission. Maybe it was silly, he was sure none of the others would judge him, or even make the connection as to why he was walking around in the middle of the day holding new sheets, but it was easier to not say anything embarrassing when there was no one around to talk to him.
“Like a cat.” Widow finishes, her smile looks fond from where he's sitting.
” Tony might give Steve's stubbornness a run for its money, and that's really saying something.
“Never thought I could have this, have you.” Steve speaks against Tony's lips like a secret. Tony shivers, pressing closer, pulling him into more kisses. He's so eager, so warm and genuine, and Steve is gone on the moment, lost in everything he never thought he could have. He's so awed, so grateful, he wishes he was as good with words as Tony is, so he could tell him exactly how much this means to him; how much
The drive takes over a day, but no driver means they can sleep in the car. Or rather, Tony and Rhodey sleep, the other two don't seem to rest at all. When they take breaks at rest stops there's always someone at his side. Tony avoids looking at the magazine racks and televisions, sinking into his hoodie when people look at him just shy of too long.
They stay like that, wrapped up in eachother, kissing as if they have all the time in the world.  Steve expects more to come of it, for Tony to lead him off to the bedroom, but that doesn’t happen.  Instead Tony stays where he is, draped over him, face turned toward the window while Steve strokes through the soft tangle of his hair.  He’s dozing now, soft breaths puffing out, his body utterly relaxed against Steve’s. Outside it’s still sleeting, the cold icy rain splashing down.  The city is alive down at street level, and blinking neon signs light up the night and the room they’re in. Steve knows if he were to go walking through the streets right now that it would be loud, but it’s quiet here, as if they’ve created their own little bubble of peace.  He knows in a few days they will have to return, that he will have to hide his soft edges, and Tony will slip back behind the mask everyone thinks they know so well; but until then they have this.
“Hey you!”  He called, and the two men’s faces snapped towards him,  “Yeah you, you ugly schmucks, I’m talking to you!”  Peripherally, Steve was aware that maybe riling two big alphas up wasn’t the best idea, and they were definitely alphas, the scent of ozone and wind and something wild and spicy overlain by a heavy dose of the tobacco they must have favored hit his nose.  Yeah they were definitely alphas.  Steve swallowed and raised his fists.
“Can I get that in writing.”
After dinner, he excuses himself down to the lab. Steve sees him off with a lingering kiss that puts a spring in Tony's step. He rubs at the tag beneath his shirt as he works, almost unable to believe it really happened. That Steve wants him that much. He contemplates calling Rhodey, but it's late, and he has a life of his own. Instead he focuses on repulsor upgrades, letting the familiar process calm the noise in his head as it always does.
Tony doubts it. He's seen the reels-Steve underestimates the power of his smile and his ridiculous eyelashes.  “I Would have bought war-bonds from you babe.” He blows kisses at Steve and winks as he backs up towards the stage. The sight of Steve's cheeks going a little pink buoys him even as he flits around the stage and sells himself and his vision with words that use just enough guilt and self aggrandizement to get these people to open their wallets. It makes him feel slimy, but it gets the job done.  It's a little poetic too, when he thinks about it.  Howard drilled all these skills into him in, taught him how to be ruthless, how to press the right buttons, he doubts he would have appreciated how he was employing those skills now.  He'll never be the son Howard wanted, but he can do things for people who need it that Howard never would have dreamed of.  When he steps off the stage donations are still coming in, and that makes the whole performance worth it in Tony's book.
Music begins filtering into the room, something slow and jazzy.  Tony gets an arm around his neck, and they dance. The first few motions are a little jerky, but Tony guides them into smoother steps, and soon they’re pressed together moving along to the music easily.  Tony hums along to the song, sighing as Steve leans his head on his shoulder and lets him lead.
“Just my hands, my bad circulation, it happens.” Tony tries for levity, but Steve's brow furrows with concern, and before he knows it they're both standing again.
“You know, if you hadn't wrung me out like a towel earlier we could explore that-” Tony purrs between kisses, humming when Steve rolls them over and settles atop him. “In detail even.”
When they make it to their honeymoon suite, and Tony gives him an extremely talented striptease that ends in a Captain America themed garter belt getting stuck on the ceiling fan. “We’ll worry about that later.” Steve says, spinning Tony down to pin him to the bed, grinning at the sound of Tony's delighted laughter in his ears. “I'm gonna peel that underwear off you with my teeth.” He says seriously.
“Stark. Thought you'd be long gone by now.” Despite his best efforts, he still sounds a little hopeful. Sure enough Tony catches it, lips turning upward as he moves his arm from around his shoulder to give his waist a quick squeeze, before letting it drop away so they can walk down the hallway side by side.
“Oh-oh, Tony-” It punches out of him roughly, all jagged syllables. He feels himself pull for a moment against his bindings, the silk pressing into his wrist in reminder, and he sinks back against the pillows, chest heaving as if he's running a marathon.
“Mister Stark, he must be a real genius. I don't think even his old man could have dreamed this up.” He says, awestruck by the sheer brilliance of the technology surrounding them.  Iron man has gone stock still in the hall. Steve turns to look back at him. Are his hands shaking? Before Steve can apologize or ask if something is wrong, Iron man starts laughing.
“Look who's talkin about being good looking.”  Steve says, panting and shuddery all over, and hard in his soft pajama pants. Tony pauses to kiss over his chin and the corners of his lips, his eyes flicker over Steve's face taking in his kiss swollen lips and the way his breath is coming out in rapid gusts.
“Steve.” He says softly, and his eyes close, dark lashes trembling over slightly sunburned cheeks. Steve wonders how long he has been searching. “Steve-” He whispers again, reverent as any prayer at Sunday mass. He steps closer, presses his palm against that cold windburned cheek, and it's so real, so much he shakes with it.
“Right so.” Rhodes says, completely ignoring him, grabbing a fruit cup from the fridge and gesturing at Steve with it.  “The question I have for you is simple. What are you trying to do, what are you after?” Gone is the look of casual friendliness on Rhodes' face. He looks every bit the hardened military man his chest full of medals implies. Steve feels like he should be saluting and shaking in his nonexistent boots right now.
“So I guess that’s a no on another date.”  Roy said.  Tony turned to regard him incredulously.  The undersuit slid back into wherever he was keeping it.  Tony sighed, and stripped off his gloves, lowered his gaze and rolled the leather up into his hand.
Married life is really not that different at all from how they lived before. They sleep in Tony's room almost exclusively now though. It's much less likely to be host to middle of the night Avengers shenanigans. Tony has his own floor after all. It's also perfectly acceptable to christen every feasible surface of said penthouse. Steve's never been in better shape, and Tony looks like the cat that got the cream most days. Both of them are deliriously happy, and once not too long ago Steve would probably have stepped back and waited for the other shoe to drop, but his joy at finally having what he's always wanted makes him optimistic.
“Well, you
They didn’t speak about it however, that Steve was looking worse and worse, even though his performance on the field never suffered, and he still spoke to the press with the smile he’d worn in the old film reels.
“Thank you Chirpy Number One, it's nice to know my assets are appreciated for the work of art they are.” Tony demurs, resolutely not meeting Steve's eyes. Clint shoots him a thumbs up and then resumes flailing in Carol's iron grip.
Steve cut him off before he could mount into a full panic, “No, no, Tony, it’s not too much, it’s good,” he gasped out, turning on the bed to grab Tony's shoulders. He wanted to pull him close, kiss him, show him how much it meant to him, but Tony didn’t feel that way about him, and that was okay too. Tony clearly cared about him, and he cared for Tony too, He had given him so much. A home, a team, his incredible friendship, and now a part of his past he never thought he would get back. There was no way he could look at all that and think it was not enough. It had to be enough. He pulled him close, and Tony sighed, his arms wrapping around Steve tightly as he pillowed his cheek on Steve’s shoulder. “It’s good, it’s,” he dared to raise his hand, cup it over the back of Tony’s neck, where the collar of his shirt met the soft curling edges of his hair, “thank you, thank you Tony.” Against him, Tony gave a full body shiver, and Steve heard his breathing go ragged.
“You need not ask us.” Thor says, walking over to clasp a hand on first Tony's, then Steve's shoulder. “We are Avengers, and you are just as much an Avenger as one of us. You protect many of us with your science, and we fight battles for those who are unable to do so, be they a shieldbrother or not. You are courageous Anthony, but I will gladly swing my hammer in your defense, and I do not believe myself to be alone in that sentiment.”
“Yes, I would, I'd um. I'd like that.” He might feel embarrassed by how stammered and unsteady it comes out, but Tony just smiles and gives him another kiss that leaves his toes curling. He finds he doesn't mind waiting for the tub to fill at all, not with Tony here radiating heat against his chest.  This is good, this is
.” Tony says, as if somehow getting Steve's dick in his mouth is a gift to
“Don't even, we were going to fly to Malibu today, I promised to show you the superiority of a burger from In n' Out.”
quantities you'd like to share with the class?”
He spent the following few hours organizing his things. There wasn’t a whole lot, but he got it all sorted and set up to his satisfaction. The room seemed warmer, less empty after he was done. For years during the war, there was no home, and after Sarah passed, even his drafty lower east side apartment felt far too empty. This was his chance, here with Tony, the team, the mansion, he could build a life there, in the present.
“How's your arm?” Iron Man asks just moments later when they touch down on soft earth once more.
“Different parameters, throw out the whole framework.” He mutters to himself. Tony has been with a lot of people, but he's never been with someone who wants something like this. Giving lavish gifts and taking his lovers out to expensive restaurants is expected. That Steve wants to show Tony around and treat him like he's
“I am so ready for this.” Tony says immediately, having apparently been waiting for Steve just outside the elevator.
“Ma’,”  He said only half reproachfully, laughing despite himself.
As if sensing his impending fit of embarrassed pique the Jag rolls around the corner before he can pick up any steam. Happy hops out to open the door, and Tony doesn't even pretend to be surprised when Steve practically carts him into the backseat. He
Inside the room, the little red box from the cuff-links was sitting on his dresser where he’d left it in the morning.  It was empty, empty because Tony accepted his gift.  Maybe not directly, and maybe Steve’s intentions weren’t clear, but Tony kept them all the same.  Tony looked so sweet, so sweet the way he’d held the cuff-links, the way he almost seemed to treasure them.  It felt as if there was a hand around Steve’s heart, when he held them out, Steve was well prepared to have his heart broken.  The way it had been in the past, when he’d held out a gift, or poured his intentions into a letter.  But Tony, he hadn’t done that.  He could have dashed Steve’s hopes so easily, but here Steve was, with an empty box instead.
The second time they share a bed it's more an act of strategy on Steve's part than a happy accident. Maybe he might take advantage of the fact that Tony seems willing to follow him on most wild-hairs, maybe it's just simple desperation. Either way he talks Tony into another camping trip-citing the disaster that was their last time in the Savage Land as reason for his sudden desire to go be outdoorsy. Tony huffs and complains duly, but eventually agrees to his demands once it becomes evident that it's something of a nostalgia trip for Steve.
His ma’, Sarah Rogers looked back at him, the way she had so many years ago. Her white nurse’s dress wasn’t the bright white it once had been, but it was still her, held suspended in glass, as safe as she could be. He couldn’t speak, the emotion rose in his throat, his eyes felt hot, tears slipped down his face to wet his cheeks. He’d given everything from his old life up for lost, but here was Tony handing a piece back to him without him even having to ask. Slowly he placed the painting down on the bed, and then reached out to take Tony’s hands in his, Tony was trembling, his eyes wide and incredibly blue, he looked a little pale. Steve pulled him to sit on the bed beside him, and he went without complaint.
“I don’t know, I’ve missed out on a lot, I might ask you for history lessons.”  He tried for levity, he really did, but it still came out more than a little shaky.  Iron Man just squeezed his shoulder again.
“Missed you all. Dropped the cup, sorry Bucko” He gasps out. The mug rolls away, and Tony has a brief moment of relief when it doesn't shatter, but then he's just in agony
“There's a lot you don't know about me.” Tony licks his lips, still refusing to meet his eyes. “I'm not. This is...you can't want this. I'm not for you, you don't know what you're asking Steve.” Paper crinkles as Tony hugs the flowers more tightly against his chest. A few petals shake off onto the floor, red by his feet like new blood. “There are parts of me that are ugly, things I've done, things out there that you will find. Things people will say about me, things I
“Don't,” He says, “To me, come to me instead.” He doesn't know if he has been heard, and what good is a ghost's comfort anyway, but then his soulmate is crumpling down, folding into himself, the heels of his hands pressing into the hollows beneath his eyes. The drink spills, pooling on the ground, glimmering liquid and malicious in the low light of the room. “I'm here, Here with you-” He calls out into the echoing space between them, but the ocean is there soon, tearing him away no matter how he fights it. A ship cannot fight the ocean, and neither can he, but his soulmate's pain echoes down with him into the dark.
“What a mouth on you, Commandos would have been proud.” Steve says, unable to resist needling his friend despite the situation. “C'mere, help me fix this. You got a splint stowed away in that roomy behind of yours?”
at all what he was expecting.  Tony nearly chokes on his next bite of dessert. Steve is
That sense of rightness is back. The word settling somewhere just behind his heart with warm familiarity.
“What is it, Tony?  You alright?”  Steve blinked over at him.
he thinks. Tony Stark is drenched in technology, maybe that's why he can't hear his heart.
“Thanks sour patch, you're the best.”
“Going to shower and head to the lab, or you want to come eat?” Steve asks. It's obvious which answer he prefers-he still doesn't seem to think Tony's shakes are food.
“I thought well, it would be easier to bring it all to you, there’s one thing I um, I had, in a vault because it seemed really important, and I want to, no I need to give it back to you.” Tony stood then, taking all his warmth with him, and walking over to the door. He called to Jarvis down the hall, disappearing for a moment, and returning with a big square of glass, with a yellowed canvas held within it. “She’s beautiful, by the way.” He said quietly, passing the glass into Steve’s shaking hands.
With a great amount of effort Steve finally cracks his eyes open. The sight that greets him makes about as much sense as it had with his eyes closed. There's a robot standing directly across from him. Red and gold metal plates shift and whir seamlessly as it takes a short step towards him. A bright blue light gleams in its chest and eye sockets. Behind the robot a tiny woman with fluttering wings is smiling at him brightly. At her side a blond woman all in blue and red watches him closely; her heart as steady as her gaze. The light in the room reflects strangely across the gold star on her chest. She holds her arm out, stopping the steps of a man in black and purple. Excitable; he thinks, listening to the man's heartbeat rabbit around with his obvious energy.
“I love it, loved all of it, but right now, I want this.” Tony pauses, reaching back between their bodies, wiggling his hips down to get more space between them so he can wrap his hand around Steve's cock and give it a long, slow pull. He can't see it, head down on the pillow as it is, but he feels the hot, silky skin pulse against his hand, hears the way Steve groans as he tilts his hips up, and pushes back to try and work Steve into himself.
“Guys, can I
Hours later he stands in a bombed out street and hurls the nearly empty bottle in a fit of frustration and rage. It shatters on the wall of an abandoned building, useless across the brick as it is in his stomach. Anger festers in his heart, anger at himself, anger so strong and breathtaking it brings Steve to his knees. All this strength and still Bucky slipped through his fingers. What a way to repay the guy that always had your back. It takes Steve a moment to realize he's crying, and then it's impossible to stop. Great heaving sobs that wrack his body. Peggy finds him there-curled into himself and shaking. She doesn't berate him or mock him, merely helps him to his feet. Sleep does not find him that night.
And Steve would have gotten over it, I don't know where you're getting that he loves m-” The elbow jabbing into his side momentarily knocks the wind out of him. Before he can get his wheezing under control, the door to his office is sliding open to reveal all of the Avengers currently in the tower in fresh gear. Ah, so that's what the elbowing was about, they have company.  “Um.” He says, rate of blinking increasing when Nat passes him off to Steve. “Hello? Are we having family night and no one told me? I didn't think it was my turn to pick the movie?”
“Yeah I did. You know for such a smart guy, you can be pretty hard to get through to.” Steve says bemusedly.
That more than anything, seems to do the trick. Tony arches, nails digging into Steve's back, tension and pleasure ratcheting higher until he's clenching around Steve's cock, slick, hot, and delicious right on the edge of orgasm. Steve groans, pushing his thigh higher, angling for that spot that made Tony react so intensely before and grinding there, laying his hand over Tony's belly to hold him down into the short hard thrusts. Tony's hands fall from his shoulders, one dropping to wrap around his flushed cock, the other clawing at the sheets.
“Keep talking, even if I fall asleep okay, keep talking to me until you sleep too.” Steve is gratified by the soft sigh of relief from the other end of the speakers.
“Oh I'm not falling for that Tony, banana innuendos were around in my day too.” Steve looks a little red around the ears. Tony rolls his eyes, his heart squeezing troublingly with how much he loves this man.
“Dammit, I’m going to be late at this rate.”  Tony grouched, letting the cuff he’d been working on hang open.  He was holding a cufflink in his hand, it was obviously missing a stone.  Steve felt his heart jump up into his throat.  He wondered if the universe was trying to give him a sign.  He thought of the cufflinks, his hopeless courting gift to Tony sitting in his bedside drawer.  It was silly of course, he was sure Tony had plenty of cufflinks.  Drawers and drawers of them even.
Steve hopes whatever villain is at the root of this has something to say for themselves.
“Close, I'm, I'm-” Tony gasps out, the breaths leaving him are short and staccato. Steve just growls, a low rumbling sound that vibrates against Tony's back. His hand wraps around Tony's cock, fingers forming a tight sleeve for Tony to thrust into while he fucks Tony like he's aiming for a prize. Tony would like to give him a gold star, he really would, but all he can do is bury his face in the pillows, and bite down so he doesn't wake everyone in the compound.
feeling this way, flayed open and exposed, and wanting.  Maybe he can create a robot to feel all his feelings for him. That can only end in tears. Scratch that.
That was where Tony found him, sitting at the kitchen table with a mouthful of Jarvis’ delicious spaghetti and an entire plate of garlic breadsticks.
“That's a good picture of him. Cute.” Tony's eyes narrow, JARVIS helpfully focusing on Steve's phone to enlarge and rotate the picture on Steve's background. Once he gets a good look it's all he can do to contain himself. It's a picture of him sleeping on Steve's chest. He's definitely right on the verge of drooling. Steve just smiles wider, sweeping his thumb over the image on his screen.
“Colonel Rhodes, if I might suggest you speak with Anthony first, he can apprise you of the situation.”
“You did say that, and after all, your wish is my command, anything you want, anything for my fella.”  Tony says with a little wink, and hearing Tony say things like that, using Steve's own turns of phrase; it makes him feel his request wasn't a bad one.  That thought is further reinforced when Tony pulls back the covers and urges Steve to lay down on his side. Tony is there a moment later, settling in behind him and slipping a hand beneath the soft flannel of Steve's shirt.  “There now. How is this? Is this what you wanted, sugar?”
going to kidnap Tony. That is the absolute last thing of all things I would do to Tony Stark-don't you
The alley seemed a lot longer than it had when he first ran into it, but Steve gamely walked towards the entrance, only to stop short when a shiny green and grey Packard 160 rolled over to block his path, and a man in a long white greatcoat stepped out.  Steve took a step back, wary suddenly that the two alphas hadn’t so much left as gone to get another friend.  Steve thought this was sure a lot of fuss for one little old lady’s purse.  The guy didn’t seem interested in the bag at all though, he was carrying a thick file, and he smelled like a beta, a neutral clean scent that reminded Steve a little of green grass and fresh laundry.  He fixed Steve with a piercing gaze, and smiled, a far kinder smile than Steve had seen from most people who wanted to punch his lights out.
rejection apparently.” Tony answers immediately, knocking his drink back and pouring himself another. “Ty's an arrogant bastard, makes me look practically demure by comparison-”
“Where am I, who are you people?” Steve finally grits out. His voice sounds rusty and he coughs to clear it, startling when the robot makes his way over with surprisingly smooth steps and presses a cup of water into his hand. The cup is made out of a material so strange that Steve takes long moments to process it before hesitantly taking a sip.
“I just dealt with it.” Steve shrugged, other alphas dealt with it fine, he didn’t see what was so special about that, why he should be any different.
“Want your hands all over me, god your fingers are just-” Tony cuts himself off, opening his mouth and
“I tried to, but he just wouldn’t let up, and I had places to be, so I took the ticket.  I don’t plan on going.”  Tony frowned, so did Steve.  He sure hated it when some lousy cad couldn’t take a hint.  Maybe the guy was just socially inept and couldn’t tell Tony didn’t want to be friendly outside of work.  “Wait!”  Tony said, his eyes lit up, he looked as if some brilliant idea had occurred to him.  “Come with me!”  A wide smile was spreading across his face.  He leaned forward, set his hands on the table like a man making some kind of business proposal.
“Really, Tony Stark sleeping, what a novel concept.” Steve grins at Tony's affronted little grunt.
“Bells, Hulk like bells, sound pretty, don't want to smash them.”
friend no less, but he's not a lover, and he doesn't want to be a lover. Silently cursing himself and his rampant libido, Tony pulls back, arms going out to put distance between himself and the very blissed out looking supersoldier above him.
Their wedding is on a Saturday because Tony says it's the party day-and one more rowdy group of revelers won't be noticed among the throngs of nighttime party goers. He's right, and their little ceremony goes completely unnoticed. Their friends' all attend, but it's a small affair, intimate and secret. Something that the public can't touch. Of course it doesn't hurt that the public seems to think they're already married, so no one bats an eye when they show up at a ritzy joint with matching rings.
“Your lung capacity is shot, you shouldn't be flying.” Natasha says, taking advantage of Tony's distraction to finish wrapping him in the knitted shawl.
“There was another alpha, one other, a man named Johann Schmidt, the serum destroyed him.”  Dr.  Erskine shook his head, his lips twisting into a semi grimace, “what there was to destroy.  He was already cruel, evil, working for Hydra, a crushing arm of the Nazis.  The serum, it made him stronger, madder, it took the alpha’s desire to protect and twisted it into a mad desire to subjugate, to rule.”  It was a horrifying story, and a terrifying thought, that something could taint the drives an alpha had, he could not imagine wishing to hold a power of that kind.
“I'm pretty gone on you too sweetheart.” Steve continues petting him, drawing him into warm kisses that make his entire body tingle. “I'll praise you as much as you like, got a lot to say.”
“I tried to convince him a skirt would be stylish, but I was sabotaged.”  Clint muttered.  Tony blinked, rate of blinking increasing as Steve came over to sit on the ground in front of the group and leaned against their legs.  On the screen a pair of gigantic robots were engaged in a brawl of epic proportions.
. Captain America!!!!! Exclamation points
"Roger that.”  Giant man said, shrinking down to avoid a volley of shots from Black Knight.
“Yeah.” He pants, breaths coming in little hitching gasps. “You ever heard the expression 'hurts so good?' Steve, because it
“Wow you're...” Tony shifts away, visibly pulling himself together. Steve feels his mood take a sharp nosedive.
“Little bit, don't sweat it Steve, I've slept in much worse, I'll just have JARVIS turn on the heat. Or okay-okay yeah we can do that too.” Tony cuts off when Steve pulls him in close, winding his arms around Tony's body.
Steve ignores him, plowing on as if he hasn't spoken.  “I love you.”
“That’s what we were about to ask you!”  Iron Man said, then tilted his head, Steve felt the strangest impression that he was being measured up.  “We won the war alright, if it’s the one I think you’re asking about, but, you can’t be Captain America, can you?”  Iron Man’s voice was metallic, but Steve realized suddenly that there might be a person in there.  There had to be.  His bearing, the hesitation in his voice, Steve didn’t think it was possible for a robot to do all that.  Maybe it was just wishful thinking, a vain hope things were not so alien, that there was a man beneath all that sleek metal, that Iron Man wasn’t a robot at all.  Just as that hope took root, the room tilted, alarms blared, a mechanical sounding voice declaring the presence of hostiles.
” One of the trio says, but he can't tell who over the pounding of his pulse in his ears. Probably Cayenne, something about her screams competence, but what is her
They keep walking after that, eventually making it to the observation deck. There he is treated to the unique experience that is Thor; the apparent Norse god of Thunder. His heart belies his name, it pounds out a rhythm so strong Steve wonders if even the others can hear it. Strange though, there are other sounds around him, like Iron Man Thor seems to bleed technology. The hammer in his hand resonates like an open sky, strange and so alien that Steve has difficulty looking at it too long.
Time passes just as slowly as Steve predicted. He keeps his hands off of himself by sheer force of will. Tony is true to his word however, and at just a few minutes over the hour, he's back in the room, crawling up onto the bed, all dark eyes and wicked intent. It's definitely a good look on him, and Steve feels his arousal come back full force when Tony perches his warm naked form on his lap, and leans in for a scorching kiss.
ets.” Iron Man sounds a little miffed, but Steve doesn't doubt the truth of the statement. If it is Tony in the armor Steve is lucky it's not completely anatomically accurate. Steve might be a gentleman but he's got eyes. It doesn't escape his notice that Iron Man is keeping the conversation carefully light, as if he's afraid for Steve but trying not to show it. Steve appreciates the levity, it helps him push thoughts of the train even further down, helps him smile through the agony racing up his arm and poke back at his friend just a little bit.
“A warehouse?” Steve prompted. Tony’s eyes went even more round, and then he shook his head, coming fully into the room.
He thinks fiercely, grabbing for those flickering images, but the water draws back, and he is just a man. The tide can't be held in his arms.
“Gonna make a lot of people who make a lot of money off this kind of thing real angry.” Steve loves to make assholes angry, Tony seems to be much the same.
“Van Halen then.”  Clint fired back, firing an arrow at Radioactive Man in the same breath.
“Let's go kick some ass Jay, I have a bone to pick with whoever interrupted my date.” It's a good thing he's had his coffee at least. Woe betide the villain that interrupts his morning coffee.
“Sir, Captain Rogers came across you in the sitting room and became concerned for your comfort.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“If he gets along with you, I’m sure I would.”  He said sincerely, and Tony seemed pleased to hear it too, if his sweet little smile was anything to go by.  He was so handsome, so beautiful just sitting there across from Steve as if he had nowhere better to be.  Steve swallowed, finding his tongue to speak again.  “How was it anyway?  The shareholder meeting that is?”  At that Tony sat back, staring into his cards with great attention, giving a great blustering sigh.
“Steve! Oh my god, who taught you that?” Tony says on a gasp, working his hips back. “Oh wait, mmmm, it was me, go me.” Tony groans, laughing breathily, but breaking off into whimper when that earns him another swat on the behind, just over the fullest part of the muscle.  "Just so you know, you're only encouraging me with that."  Tony snickers, wiggling his hips enticingly.
“I'm...sorry man. You look like you need this. Thor sent it over, some kind of Asgardian thing, he said it might work for you.” Steve takes the drink, downing it in one swallow. It tastes oddly like bubblegum, but burns on the way down satisfyingly. Steve could care less right this moment.
Tony hears the whir of servos, and then he's being pushed behind gleaming red metal. He stumbles back slightly, and the armor reaches back to steady him. Glowing eye slits stare into his for just a moment before JARVIS turns his gaze to Hammer-and wow. It's easier to appreciate how extremely intimidating the armor is when he's not encased in it.
“Coordinates!” Tony repeats, and then he’s sinking down, head in his hands as he sobs, tears spilling through his fingers to leave specks of moisture on damp sand. Rhodey holds him until the tremors stop, until his grief simmers into something quiet and barren-a sucking wound where his heart should be. Tony will find him, it’s the least he can do. His soulmate has left him a map, in stars, in numbers, in the shifting shadows of a sunken plane.
“Ask me again sometime when you're not about to pass out.” Steve hopes he will, a guy can dream anyway.  Tony nods slowly, and then he's out, fast asleep between one blink and the next.
“Marry me.” He says dazedly. “You're already on your knees, you should just propose.” He clarifies, hazy brown eyes dropping to stare down at Steve.
.” Tony says, and really he needs to have a talk with himself, because he
“And I have won the bet, as I knew I would, It's almost worth it to see that mad skull if only to collect.” Steve crosses his arms over his chest, glaring down at Doom.
“He-we were friends. I thought that's all we were, but he had other thoughts, other plans. Didn't really stop to consult me on that though.” The way Tony says it, the dismissiveness makes rage boil in Steve's gut.
“You have tried to serve your country, what is it now,”  Dr. Erskine opened the file, his brow rising nearly to his hairline, “no less than fifteen times, if we do not count the occasions you attempted to forge your age.”  The tone of his voice was something in between amusement and respect.  Steve licked his lips, staring at that thick folder.  He’d had no idea someone had been keeping tabs on him.
“Is that,”  Steve’s voice cracked, “New York City?”
Steve's gaze is hot, his eyes dark as he pops the button of his slacks open and slips his hand inside. Tony can't help the gasp he lets out when Steve finally,
Steve doesn't know what to say to that.  Part of him wants to buck against it, to tell Tony he's being ridiculous, but another larger part wants to melt into that praise.  It feels so good to have Tony warm against his back, whispering honey sweet words into his ear, so good that he turns his face into the pillow in a futile attempt to hide the blush that must be everywhere by now.  Tony shifts down, pressing kisses against the back of his neck, his hand slips back beneath Steve's shirt to splay over his stomach, and Steve sighs out when deft, clever fingers rub there in circles.
The barracks themselves were a whole new experience as well.  The beds were wide enough for two to three cadets to squeeze into them at the same time, he often saw a pair of betas, or alpha and beta cadets curled up together at night after a particularly difficult day.  When first settling in, Steve asked out of curiosity, if anyone was worried about getting a bun in their oven,  all betas could carry a child, or get another beta in the family way, and that seemed just a little like a bad idea, omegas could carry children too, but it was a little more complicated and there were just so few of them anyway.  But he’d seen some roaming hands at night, heard people taking comfort in each other.  He’d become a damn deep sleeper lately, and it wasn’t his business anyway, he’d just been curious. One of the cadets had assured him there was no danger of that, suppressants and birth control were passed out to any beta that wanted them, and encouraged for any beta-or even potentially omega- wanting to use the extra space in their or another’s bed.  Alphas of course were not really encouraged to take suppressants, while it made civilian life much easier for an unbonded alpha, it made a soldier more vulnerable, and vulnerable was the opposite of what was needed on the battlefield.
compare him to his dad whatever you do. Just don't do it.” Wasp says with such finality that Steve adds several red underlines to the observation on his mental checklist.
much better than good, being held close to Steve like this.  Steve sags with relief against the couch though as if somehow he had doubts over how receptive Tony would be to all this. Maybe Tony should kick up more of a fuss about being snuggled up to, maybe he should guard his heart more closely. Maybe he shouldn't allow himself to be so needy, but Steve seems to want it just as badly as he does.  From the night in the music room, to his frequent hugs, snuggling him in the kitchen, and that terrible night in the limo when they clung to each other like the last pieces of floating debris in a shipwreck. Tony has treated
"Count your chickens right, and he'll give you anything you want, boytoy,"  he sneers at Steve, "just ask Sunset Bain.  I hear he gave her a real nice severance package."  If Tony didn't know any better he would almost think Hammer is jealous.
“Steve were you out jogging in that?” He sounded a little breathless. Steve looked down at himself, he wondered if he’d gotten pretzel cheese on himself somehow and not noticed, but everything still looked clean and unstained.
Opening the door out into the hallway, there was a thick envelope made of an odd crinkly white material resting in front of his door.  Steve picked it up and tore open the package along the perforated line.  A ticket to the football game he and Tony discussed the night prior fell out, along with a cottony wristband emblazoned with a hawk, and a note with one of Tony’s little Iron Man stick figures.  He was giving a thumbs up, and a little speech bubble above him said
obscene. He just doesn't understand what everyone in this century seems to have against men's thighs.
This chapter is in Tony's POV
“As you say.” JARVIS allows, but he doesn't sound happy about it at all.
“Let's take care of this and I'll take you to that place you like with the espresso and the spumoni, what do you think?” The clang of his shield slamming through another wave of bugs rings through his ears, but he ignores it in favor of looking up at Tony-catching his shield without looking when it spins back on the rebound
“I'm here.” He says, kissing Tony between words. “I'm staying, I'm here.”
“Can't, I'm never patient when it comes to your dick.” Tony laughs out shakily when Steve pinches his hip lightly.
“Hey.” Steve says, looking completely unembarrassed by their having been going at it in the back of a car like a pair of horny teenagers.“Those are mine.”
He thinks somewhat faintly.
AT LAAAAST the chapter is out!  Thank you to all of you for being so patient, and to everyone on discord (Ana, Palindrome, Aeniala, Seti, Rowantree, Bee your patience is mind boggling as always)
“Yes.” Tony murmurs. “I'm showing it to you. I thought we might take some time away from it all. I think we could both use it. There's already story circulating that I've flown off to Fiji.” Tony keeps talking as the elevator doors open, and he keys in a code to let them into a spacious penthouse. It's smaller than some of the other places Tony has brought him to. Floor to ceiling windows dominate a sunken sitting room, and a gleaming chef's kitchen takes up the rest of what his eyes can see. There's a staircase winding up just along the far wall, with a pillow filled king size bed all done up in scarlet just visible over glassed in loft railing.
