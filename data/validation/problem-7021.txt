good, Tony,” Steve said, looking down at the man before him. Tony preened at the praise, smirking at the way it made Steve's breath hitch. He reached up to take hold of the base of Steve's cock, pulling back to run his tongue along the shaft. He gave a small kiss to the head, that being his only warning before swallowing the man into his throat.
Once they were on the road, it dawned on Steve that they’d have to find a way to fill this silence for an hour and a half. He’d never found it hard to talk to Tony, about anything really, but now it seemed like an impossible feat.
“Apple juice for the birthday girl, Sprite for me, and Coke for the boyfriend over there,” Steve ordered. “We’re ready to order, too.”
Steve's way of 'figuring it out' was to just ignore Tony completely, but it only took half a day to realize that that definitely wasn't going to work. It was after that, that Steve settled on the 'kill him with kindness' approach. Being overly nice to Tony seemed to work well enough, so it stuck. Though being as nice as possible seemingly made work easier, it pained Steve to bite his tongue at some of the brunet's comments. So he found himself here, where he started work every day, trying to breathe evenly while reminding himself that he wasn't allowed to murder Tony, no matter how desperately he wanted to.
Steve smiled to himself at the story, feeling a sense of relief at having told Bucky about his feelings, and happiness at the fact that his friends approved of Tony.
Tony Stark,” Steve whispered, pulling Sam and Bucky closer to him. “He’s a physics teacher at my school and I’ll be working with him as an assistant coach for the robotics team.”
“I just don’t know that you are. I feel like I’ve had to practically twist your arm to get you to do anything SI related, and that was when you still worked here!”
The two men sat there, quietly racking their brains for ideas when Natasha walked into the living room with a bottle of beer.
He felt bad for going off on his friends, but as the only omega in his close group of friends it sometimes felt like they were giving him special treatment due to his gender. He was fully aware that his friends considered him an equal but sometimes his insecurities got the better of him.
out. Sure, he’d been pretty calm that first day, but it hadn’t really sunk in. The guy he had a soul-crushing crush on had a kid. Tony’d done the math. Seventeen. Steve had been
Steve cast a look at Fury, seeing the long suffering man pinch the bridge of his nose as he shook his head, before turning to follow Barton. They walked together in silence for several minutes before Steve spoke. “So uhm...nice to meet you, I’m Steve Rogers,” he said somewhat awkwardly.
"Well you did practically just drop her off at my doorstep with no real explanation, so yeah, kinda," Steve answered, fully aware of how immature his attitude made him seem. Peggy just gave a tired laugh and shook her head.
Once the other man had left his room, Tony fell to his side with a plop. How had he let things get this bad? He ran his hand over his face, giving a long sigh before resolving to get out of bed. Today was going to be a long and probably miserable day, so he might as well just jump right into it head first.
“Steve, you’re awake. You’re awake!” Tony said over and over again, as he peppered the blond’s face with kisses.
Tony felt a sense of panic creep in at Ty’s words. He tried his best to school his expression to not give too much of himself away, but it seemed to be too late.
“You’re lying,” Steve said, shifting to sit up, “your voice always does this high pitched thing when you lie.”
Tony moved to quickly jump in front of Steve before he had a chance to do something he might regret.
“I’ve learned a lot of things in all my years of being...me,” Tony stated, looking down at their fingers intertwined. “Unfortunately one of the biggest lessons I’ve learned is to question anything decent that comes into my life. I’ve been burned by a lot of people in the past, and I get that you weren’t any of those people, but all of them left lasting scars that manifested as me assuming anyone as funny, and smart and…
. It’s just...I’m not...you don’t want to do this, not with me. Mason, she’s a gift, a literal gift, but you getting pregnant wasn’t some act of divine intervention bringing us together.  It’s just something that happened, and as happy as I am that it did, it doesn’t meant that we should be bond mates.”
It was only a minute before Steve came to, feeling Tony continuing to thrust into his fist. Steve wrapped his free hand around the back of Tony’s head, pulling it closer to worry the skin in his neck. He kissed and sucked the area, nuzzling it with his beard, before he moved to whisper “Tony.” The moan that earned him encouraged Steve to do it again. “Tony, come for me, please.
“This is perfect,” Pepper affirmed, looking down at the bottle momentarily. “So, I’m sure you know who I am, but I’m not so sure you know why I’m here.”
“I’m looking for the last check that I had tonight...found it!” the blond exclaimed, holding it up in the air.
It wasn’t long before the game started, and that’s when Steve came into his own. While watching the bots maneuver around the makeshift field, pushing around the little ball, Tony found himself explaining less and less as he just listened to Steve dissect every movement that was made. By the time the meet up had come to an end, Steve was buzzing with excitement as he went to talk with the people who operated the bots in the game. On the way to dinner, Steve barely stopped to take a breath as he told Tony about all of the things he’d learned. He tried to keep up, asking about one bot in particular that Steve had mentioned, not really remembering what had been said that made that one stand out in particular.
Steve cringed at the assessment. He and Tony had been together a little over a year and shared quite a few heats together, but they hadn’t yet bonded. Tony had wanted to wait until they were a little older, saying that he didn’t want the idea of settling down to change things between them. Steve had agreed but if he was honest, he felt more than ready. Having this brute make note of his lack of a bond mark stung in a way that somehow made Steve feel ashamed.
As he continued to cart Cora around the room, Tony couldn’t help but feel like someone was watching him. He turned to see Steve sitting at the kitchen table with the most fond smile plastered on his face.
Steve thought as he was on his run. It seemed like every relationship he’d been in was nothing but him getting ahead of himself and ending up tripping into heartache. He wanted to think this time would be different, but every other time had been different...until they all ended up exactly the same way. It was just so hard for Steve to rein it in when it came to having someone to love, and having someone to love
“You’re kidding me, right?” Tony laughed, “I haven’t touched the money you sent me in over five years. The house that I have, I bought with my own money, everything I’ve used to furnish said house, I bought with
“Oh uh...I thought we were supposed to start getting admin stuff done,” Steve asked more than stated.
The elevator ride up to the roof was silent, Tony trying to focus more on the weight of the champagne bottle in the gift bag he held and less on the fact that Steve stood so close behind him that he could feel the heat radiating off of him. Once on the roof, they stepped out to see cafe lights strewn about overhead, with small clusters of people all around. This was by no means anything like most of the events Tony attended, and yet, he found himself wishing that every gala, every ball, every party he was forced to show up to had the same warmth and excitement that this small Brooklyn rooftop had.
“Nothing, if you’re going there for the food as opposed to going there just to see your ex-boyfriend.”
“Yeah, I understand. We’ll figure something out,” Tony spoke, a little sad about not getting to see Cora. Steve pulled him in for one last kiss, resting their foreheads together once he pulled away.
He could hear a lot of different things, but mainly, he could hear people practically screaming around him.
Steve took another look at the couch, deflating a bit at the realization. Tony gave a soft chuckle at that and smiled. “Just share the bed with me, Steve, it’s fine.”
Steve moved to stand by the couch, and reached out a hand to run through Tony’s hair. The brunet hummed as he leaned into the touch. “So, how was everything?” Steve finally asked. He noticed Tony tense slightly at the question, before moving to make more room beside him.
“Peter’s got a point. It might take some grand gesture for the two of you to get past this,” Bruce reasoned.
As much as Tony loved slowly unraveling his boyfriend, he was ready to make good on his promise. He gave two more slow strokes of his fingers while fumbling for the lube. As he grabbed the small bottle, Tony withdrew his fingers, causing Steve to whine in protest. Once his cock was covered in lube, Tony lined himself up with Steve's hole. Taking hold of the blond's hip, he softly ran his thumb back and forth, silently asking for the go ahead. Steve just smiled, giving a small nod.
“So...what you’re saying is I should have gone with four bottles of vodka per guest, and dipped into New Jersey’s supply of alcohol as well?”
“Hey everyone,” Steve started, “as Mr. Stark said, I’m Mr. Rogers. Let me know if you need anything today. Otherwise, I’m excited to get to know you all and to do what I can for the team this year.” He ended with a sincere smile, giving a barely noticeable sigh of relief once the students started welcoming him.
“Okay.” Tony experimentally rolled his hips and holy hell that was good. He fought to stay in control, to take care of Steve, but it was hard. Tony wasn’t used to having to hold back. For one, he was used to either bottoming or being with a woman. This was his second time topping, the first having gone horribly,
“She’s moving back to London? As in London, England?” Tony asked. Steve had kept his conversation with Peggy bottled up until Cora had her inevitable sugar crash from the birthday cake and they’d put her to bed. As soon as he’d closed the door, everything had come spilling out.
Steve finally let out the breath he had been holding in the form of a laugh mixed with a sob. He continued to laugh as tears fell from his eyes, overjoyed by getting to see this, getting to see the little life that was growing inside of him was there on a screen for all the world to see. He couldn’t help but reach a hand out to touch the mass on screen that was his baby just to make sure it was all real.
“Anthony. I’m calling because I need you to tell me what you intend to do for the Thanksgiving holiday break. Should I have someone prepare your room?”
“Glad to hear that, Stark. We’ve looked into some of the things you’ve produced lately, and decided that you’d be a much better fit for the web dev team. So, with that being said, we’re promoting you to the Web Development Manager. Congratulations, Tony.”
“Hmm,” Sam said, rubbing his chin in thought, “you’ve known this guy for what...a week? How do you already have a crush on him?”
“Which is something only rich people say.” Steve pulled back when Tony reached for his hands. He regretted it immediately because, going by the look on Tony’s face, he’d really hurt him by that simple movement.
“Steve you’re the best man for this job. I know you two didn’t quite get along in the beginning, but you’re friends now. I know how much you care about him and you’re the only one who won’t run when he tries to push you away.”
“Well his friend Carol was coming over, but he said he had to bribe her with dinner to get her to come over and talk, so I made mention of the fact that I have yet to get dinner and I talk to him constantly. He brought up his questionable cooking skills so I threw it out there that maybe I should do the cooking then he responded with ‘it’s a date’.”
“Hey Cora, look, your daddy’s over there! Should we ride over to him and show him how great you are at riding ponies?” Tony asked.
“What did I do? I haven’t seen you in, like, two days, I couldn’t have fucked up badly enough to warrant that greeting!” Tony whined, flopping onto Pepper’s bed.
“You invited me here so you could blab my ear off, I figured it’d be perfectly fine if I just barged right in.”
“School’s going well, honestly. The kids are great and they’re really enjoying the activities that Clint and I are coming up with. I mean, clearly a lot of the things that we have to make a record of, like the mile and shit like that, kids kind of hate. But otherwise they’re having fun.”
“Steve, how do you expect to ‘get out of my hair’ during a blizzard?!” Tony gestured toward the window showcasing the heavy snowfall for emphasis. “We're snowed in together, sweetheart. And besides, I was hoping for this to not be a one off.”
Though only Pepper had been around to witness it, they were both fully aware of how bad Tony’s ‘old ways’ were.
That was, until she picked out the most hideous neon colored boots known to man. Steve couldn’t even believe that someone had thought they were a good idea to put on the market. Well, he supposed it worked, considering his daughter was standing at his feet, the boot in her hands, whining.
“She wanted to make an ornament for you so you’d have something to decorate your tree with. She’s very concerned that Santa won’t be able to find you while you’re gone, so she thought this would help.”
“Come on, Buck. Really? That’s not what this is at all. I’m not whoring my friendship out for cash. Plus if that’s what he’d been after, I’m sure he would have made some kind of proposition, but he’s done nothing of the sort. He’s just a guy who happens to be rich who enjoys my friendship.”
Tony stood there and looked from Pepper to Rhodey, silently asking his friend for confirmation on the accusation. Rhodey just gave a slightly apologetic smile and shrugged his shoulders. At that, Tony slumped down into a chair at his kitchen table.
“But...why didn’t you just buy yourself a scarf so you can stop borrowing his?” Clint asked, scratching his head.
“Definitely not. I don't want to scare him away if this isn't something he wants or if he's not ready," Steve answered truthfully.
He heard the falter in Bucky’s typing, which caused him to look at the brunet, to see a look of worry on the man’s face.
“I really liked that version, it’s a nice cover,” Tony determined. The beginning sounds of ‘Mr. Blue Sky’ began playing, coaxing a massive grin out of Tony. “That’s an interesting shift between songs,” he said with a small laugh.
“I need to talk to you today, around noon about something in my office” the man said, giving Steve a strange look.
“Yeah well you’re stuck with us, so deal,” Pepper said, moving towards the brunet to give him a tight hug, “thanks for tonight.”
“Hey there baby,” the omega spoke in a hushed voice, “you’re causing a lot of fuss already even though you’re still so small. But no matter what, you’re worth it.”
There was a visible change in Tony’s posture and attitude at the question. Immediately, Steve began to regret asking anything about the subject at all.
“Really, Tony? I’m the one who taught you how to perfect that fake smile for media interviews. Do you really want to use that on me too?”
“I never drink on an empty stomach,” Sam answered before sitting at the edge of the bed, “plus I only stuck to beer while you and Buck tried to empty your apartment of every single drop of alcohol available.”
At that he took his phone out, and smiled to see that he had a text from Tony. It was a list of a few exhibits and pop-up restaurants that were coming to town that he wanted to check out together. Steve couldn’t help the smile that spread across his face as he read all that Tony had planned for them over the next few weeks. He quickly responded to let the brunet know that he couldn’t talk now but he was excited for their plans, then put his phone away. When he looked up, he saw a soft smile on his mother’s face.
Steve stood there, looking like a deer in headlights. It took a moment for his brain to seemingly reboot, before he said anything. “Hey, Tony. I was just about to—”
Since the Halloween party, Tony had taken to calling Steve ‘Cap’, in honor of his costume. Prior to that party, Steve would have found the nickname annoying at the least, but now, he found it oddly endearing.
Steve shuddered, nodding wordlessly at the alpha’s promise for later. As the song ended, Tony stepped away, probably to remind the bartender that everything for their group was to be charged to his tab. Steve moved to the edge of the dance floor, pulling out his phone to order an Uber, when he felt a hand skate across his lower back to rest on his hip.
Though Steve was fully aware he was only offering his help because of the burgeoning crush he had, he still saw Tony’s assessment as a challenge. He wanted to offer his time out of the goodness of his heart, and because it was an excuse to spend more time with the brunet, but now he had something to prove.
“Oh, Tony,” she said, moving to stand in front of the brunet, “is that what you really think? That I just threw you away because I didn’t want to
“Oh, no not like that! He came in a while back after a rough day and I served him. We got to talking and have become pretty fast friends. He’s been coming in regularly, mainly to just talk. He only ever has a drink or two, nothing crazy.”
kidding about speaking to us in Python so we need to get straight to the point, and fast,” Rhodey said, clearly trying to convey just how dire the situation was.
The brunet thought day in and day out. He’d never actually taken the time to digest any of these thoughts and feelings (because who really has the time for
“I’ve dealt with it for this long, so what’s five more months of pretending to be asleep while eavesdropping on your conversations?!”
“I genuinely don’t know why I continue talking to you. Every time I come to you for anything, this is what happens and yet I keep coming back hoping you’ll have dialed down the crazy just a little bit,” Tony replied, draping his arm over his eyes as he sat back on the couch.
“Do you even understand how love or relationships work? I feel like if you did, we wouldn’t be having this conversation.”
It took a few days, but by Saturday Tony felt that his plan (which Peter so lovingly named Operation Robot Hearts) had come together. To say he was nervous for the dance was an understatement, but if the nerves didn’t kill him, the slight embarrassment at his life turning into a 90s rom-com would. Tony really didn’t know how he’d ended up at this point; leaning on one of his former students and a few of his friends to help him sort out his relationship, but he was here now and despite everything, he felt hopeful.
Steve gave a small smile. He initially thought he was making a mistake coming to Natasha for advice, but luckily he was wrong. She not only gave him good advice, but she made him feel that wanting to be with Tony was acceptable.
“I...no,” Tony answered, unconvincingly. “Though I can see how one might think that. I really was spending that entire time dealing with Ty. Thanks again for your help with that.” Tony picked up a few papers from his desk just to have something to shuffle through, hoping that he could delay this conversation.
It had been a full 24 hours since Tony learned that he was going to be a father, and he still couldn’t wrap his head around it. In the back of his mind somewhere he knew he should be more terrified of this than he was, but all he could think of was how he was going to protect what was his. Classifying Steve as ‘his’ was hard enough to come to terms with, and yet still, there was no other way for the alpha to put it. Steve was carrying his child so Tony would have to keep both of them safe, no matter what. Oddly enough, it was that thought, being tasked with looking after two people other than himself that scared the living shit out of the brunet.
Sam and Bucky mumbled their apologies, as they went back to throwing axes. They tried to salvage what was left of their outing and by the end of it, they were all laughing hysterically.
They had a lot of work ahead of them, but thankfully most of their research was already out of the way. All they really had to do was put something useful together that the group could use in their presentation. After working in silence for an hour and a half straight, Tony decided to take a break. He stood to stretch and check up on Cora. Once he returned, he noticed the new email he had. His heart sank as he read the flight itinerary for his Christmas trip to Florence. Part of him had sincerely hoped his father was kidding about the trip to Italy, but Tony knew better. Howard was a lot of things, but a jokester wasn’t one of them.
“As long as this isn’t a hand out, and as long as you don’t take it easier on me than you would any other bartender, then I’m in.”
“It’s not, and you know it,” Steve responded, looking up at him with some sort of determination hiding behind his blue eyes.
Natasha sat silently, letting those words sink in, but Steve could tell there was something she wanted to ask him.
Steve’s face turned beet red in the moment as he gave a small wave. “Hello Peter,” he said, giving a small cough before turning to Tony. “I should probably head back to the gym. So, uh, I guess I’ll see you at the meeting this afternoon.” Steve moved to leave but stopped once he realized he was still holding Sprocket. “I’ll just uh...leave this here...with you,” he said practically running away after leaving the bot on Tony’s desk.
“Alright well, I’ll talk to you later. Thanks again,” he said before squeezing the hand Tony had placed on his arm before turning to leave.
Tony polished off the last bit of his sandwich before grabbing a screwdriver from his desk and extending it in Steve’s direction. He was met with a look of confusion.
“I wish Tony was that excited to see me,” he whispered. Pepper tried her best to stifle a laugh, but promptly lost it when Tony just turned around and hissed before sticking his tongue out at his friend.
Steve had gone through the day practically floating on a cloud after the text he’d received from Tony the night before. He didn’t know when, specifically, but they had a dinner date planned. Since December, Steve hadn’t stopped thinking about their time together. He’d be lying if he said he hadn’t spent a few evenings chasing his orgasms with the thought of Tony inside of him. So to think that maybe the alpha had Steve on his mind too was exciting to say the least.
“Nice to see you haven’t mucked this one up yet, Steve.” Peggy pulled the stroller holding Cora through the door before shutting it behind her. “Must be nice to be horizontal again. Hello, Tony.”
Steve felt something tug at his heart at the thought of Tony being excited to spend any amount of time with him. “Yeah uh...I’ll be there,” he answered, hoping his face wasn’t as red as it felt.
home? After all, you did you my money to buy it, didn’t you? When are you ever going to learn, Tony, that I’m only ever trying to look out for you. Once you take over the company you--”
Tony retreated to his workshop after the little confrontation he had with Steve. He tried so hard to avoid everyone; so of course he’d run into the one person he was running from. He didn’t know what to think of Steve’s actions, he also had no idea what to think of his words either. Never in a million years would he have imagined that Steve would want to be with him. Granted, Tony was well aware why Steve would be attracted to him (Tony is the definition of narcissistic after all), he just couldn’t understand why he’d want to be in a relationship. All relationships were good for was making things messy and complicated, and if Tony had learned anything from the failure that was he and Pepper, it was that he had no business being in a relationship. Tony racked his brain for any sign he may have missed; anything in the past three weeks that gave away Steve’s real feelings. He sighed when he realized that he couldn’t even figure out when his own feelings surfaced, so he’d never be able to figure out Steve. Tony’s mind was hazy with thoughts of the previous night combined with the confrontation that happened minutes ago. It felt more than amazing to have Steve’s soft lips pressed to his, and Tony would be lying if he said he hadn’t been thinking about how great it felt to straddle Steve while they were both so hard. Tony’s eyes snapped shut as he remembered the feeling of Steve palming him. His own hand traveled down to his lap, just to mimic the gesture. He gasped at the touch, and groaned, as his hands seemed to work his pants opened without any thought. His mind wandered to the events last night as he took hold of his cock. He imaged what would have happened if he hadn’t run away: Steve grabbing his ass, deepening the kiss and moaning. He imagined himself sliding out of Steve’s lap, freeing his cock and swallowing him whole. The thought of how good Steve would taste mixed with a mental picture of how wrecked he looked after their make out was enough to push Tony over the edge. He shuddered as he came with Steve’s name on his lips. It took a moment for his brain to reboot, and when it did he sighed, heavily. He hadn’t gotten off on the thought of Captain America since he was a teenager, and now that he had their make out session on his mind, he’d never need anything else to get him off again. As he cleaned himself up, Tony ran a hand through his hair. He knew that turning Steve down wasn’t going to be easy, but with all the fantasies floating around his head, he’d be lucky to make it out of this alive.
Tony leaned in to give Steve a kiss on the forehead, resting one hand on the omega’s shoulder and the other on his belly before leaving. Once he’d left the apartment building, he looked at his phone to see that it was still a little early for him to turn in. Without giving it much thought, he dialed Carol’s number, then waited as it rang.
This wasn’t the first incident, either. After Tony left, she’d refused to continue potty training. However, she didn’t outright say so, so he ended up cleaning up a lot of accidents before he realized he should probably put her back in Pull-ups. She’d started screaming about how she was a big girl and didn’t need diapers.
“While I admit, it’s not something I would do, something made you quit your job and according to Natasha it’s my fault so unless there’s something else I don’t know that I’ve done…”
“Why not? I thought things were...I thought things were going well between us,” Steve stated, in a small voice.
“That’s doubtful but if you’re lucky, you might catch a full smile as opposed to that thing he does that just looks like a muscle spasm at one corner of his mouth,” Steve joked. Both men laughed at the thought when Peter interjected.
Eventually, he got the balls to get out of the car and to the front of Steve’s building. Steve buzzed him in and he made his way up the three flights of stairs. Stairs took longer than the elevator. Stairs gave him time to think.
Steve immediately caught on to what Natasha was trying to ask, and felt himself blush at the question.
“My mom,” Steve answered, Tony noticed the sad smile that crept it’s way onto the blond’s face almost immediately. They’d never really discussed Steve’s parents or family, but Tony knew that something had happened to them. He’d heard that Steve spent some time living with Bucky and his family before Coraline came along. Tony didn’t want to force this conversation, but it seemed that Steve was eager to share his story. He squeezed Steve’s hand to let him know that it was okay to continue.
it’s up there! Someone say it. NIPPLES!” Tony yelled, then retracted, hoping he hadn’t woken up Cora.
“I definitely wouldn’t be mad about that,” Steve said, brain finally working again. He took notice of the fact that Tony seemed a little surprised by the set up he’d put together.
Steve smiled brightly at the request. “Of course I can,” he said, making his way around the desk, and leaning in on Tony’s side to get a good look at the computer screen.
“Listen, I...I know the last time we spoke, I said a lot of really awful stuff. I can’t even begin to say how sorry I truly am for everything. This massive asshole Tiberius Stone was behind my code being stolen and if it weren’t for the help we got from you and Natasha, Pepper and I would still be trying to figure out who the mole at SI was. I shouldn’t have said any of the things I said about you, I
Steve ran the pad of his thumb across it, causing a shiver to run down Tony’s spine. “Is there a significance?”
“Well of course we have to give her a name, but I’m saying...maybe we don’t need a different one other than the one you initially suggested.”
Sam sighed just as Bucky slowly dragged himself into the room. “Are we having the talk with him?” Bucky asked, holding his head.
“Well, thanks. I decided to make one of your favorites: Beef Wellington with risotto and green beans almondine. I'm sure it won't be anything like what your cooks used to make, but I’d say this turned out pretty well.”
Almost immediately, Bucky began to laugh at Darcy’s nickname. Within seconds, the entire room had erupted in laughter, and with that the party got underway. Steve could barely go five minutes without someone asking him about his costume or wanting to take a picture. While he did enjoy all of the praise and excitement over his costume, after a few hours, Steve found the attention draining. Once he found a moment, Steve decided to look for a quiet place he could possibly sit for a while.
That thought, paired with the fact that Steve had dropped all the way down and was grinding himself against Tony, pushed Tony over the edge and he came with a gasp, his whole body stilling as he let the post orgasmic calm course through his veins.
It was with that statement that Steve decided he was going to give this costume 100%. If he was going to be forced to go to this party he at least wanted to be the best looking Captain Planet anyone had ever seen.
. Once the carousel began to move, Steve chanced a look at Tony, who looked back at him with an earnest smile. As their horses glided up and down, the music seemed to give way to the sound of genuine laugher bubbling out of Tony. He didn’t want to be rude, he didn’t want to stare, but Steve couldn’t look away from the unbridled joy and excitement on the brunet’s face. Seeing the man like this was breathtaking in a way that Steve never knew possible, and he found himself praying that the ride would never end.
“You know Steve,” Tony started as he pulled himself off of the floor. These pants were made to make his ass look good, not made for floor sitting. “I’ve been trying to get you to go out with me for far too long to just run away now. Plus, wouldn’t you know it, turns out I’ve got a thing for tall, blond, blue eyed college hotties with super adorable year and a half old daughters.”
He sat in his apartment, making some popcorn and grabbing a bottle of beer before turning on Netflix. He searched through movies, settling on
Tony laughed at that and lifted his cup up in cheers. The two of them continued to talk as they finished their drinks, then went their separate ways. As he walked towards his office, Tony felt a sense of fear and excitement for what was to come.
Steve sat there, in a chair in the middle of Pepper and Happy’s living room, as some of his closest friends and co-workers doted on him. Today was the day of his shower, and though he was beside himself with excitement to be surrounded by those who cared about him and Bug most, he still wished that Tony could have been there.
“I’m so sorry! I didn’t intend for things to happen this way. I…I just knew that I wouldn’t be able to carry on with you while this other man was looming over our relationship.”
“Like what?” Steve asked, nervously. It only took a moment for Steve to realize that they were completely alone. “Where is everyone?” he asked, looking around. When his eyes landed on Tony, he was met with a large smile.
“Oh gosh, don't even worry about it. I uh...I should probably head home,” Steve spoke, looking for his keys.
Before Tony had a chance to regain his wits about him, Steve had pulled away and was moving towards the door.
“Alright, I’ll be right back with your drinks,” Steve spoke before practically running off. The second he got to the servers’ station he let out a breath he had unintentionally been holding.
Tony narrowed his eyes at the man in front of him. It was obvious that he wouldn't be leaving here without having to explain himself completely. He had been trying to run from this for a while, but he knew he'd eventually have to tell Steve who he really was. Once he finally got the courage to speak up, Steve moved to defend him.
Tony came from an extremely wealthy family, one that currently owned a huge government contracting corporation. The alpha didn’t like to talk about his background, mainly because of his volatile relationship with his father, but also because he didn’t want to become a target. He knew there were people in the world who would see him as nothing more than a bank roll if they knew where he came from. For that reason, Tony only let a select few know about his family.
“Was it really worth it, though? Stealing the code, sabotaging the robotics competition, making me fall for Steve, all of that just to stick it to an ex that you allegedly don’t care about at all?”
Steve had been worrying about Tony's finances ever since Valentine's day. He wanted to trust his boyfriend, but something didn't seem right.
The alpha continued taking quick shallow breaths, realizing that he was in the midst of an anxiety attack.
Steve stepped into the elevator, looking around for the man that Tony said would escort him, but didn’t see anyone.
Steve stopped dead in his tracks and turned to his friends. “Why are either of you even here?” he asked, willing away the slight heat he felt in his cheeks at what they were implying.
Later that night, Steve sat in bed reading The Great Gatsby. With every sentence he read, his mind would drift to his previous conversation with Clint. He wished that he could call Pepper, and ask her for help, but as he remembered her last few words, he looked up towards the ceiling.
Steve silently followed as Fury took him around the school, pointing out areas like the cafeteria and the auditorium, making a stop at the teacher’s lounge. “This is where our laziest employees hide to avoid doing any real work,” Fury said, standing in the open doorway.
“Check the first place you both met and go from there,” Natasha offered, giving Tony a reassuring pat on the arm before turning to address a few rowdy students.
Natasha took the scrap of paper, glancing over it before looking up at the blond. “This is great Steve, more than enough for us to find something helpful. Do you want me to let you know what I’m able to find?”
“I guess...I can try to have a good time...or whatever,” Steve finally gritted out. He rolled his eyes at the look of faux excitement on Bucky’s face.
“Well,” Clint started, “on top of Nat telling us that you’re sick, she also mentioned that you’re going to Stark’s holiday party...thing. Care to explain how you failed to mention this in the last week since you got invited?”
He’d been working at Slice Magazine for a few years now, happily creating illustrations that helped give the lifestyle magazine some excitement and personality. Steve was beyond grateful to have a job where he not only got to do what he loved, but also got to work alongside his best friend, Bucky. He was more than happy with what he did for a living, but somewhere along the way, as his mother’s health began to decline, the bills started piling up. He thought that taking a few freelance jobs here and there would be enough, but Steve quickly learned that wasn’t the case.
“Oh my god, I’m so sorry!” Steve shouted, surging forward and running his thumb along Tony’s blossoming injury. Steve placed a chaste kiss to Tony’s lips.
“I’m sure you’ll be able to think of something,” Pepper placed a reassuring hand on Steve’s arm, smiling at him all the while. “Well, I should probably get going, but thank you for listening and for the water.” Pepper said, standing to put on her heels again.
Tony managed to sit there for the rest of the night, not even realizing that he’d sat there and talked to Steve until midnight.
“I refuse to give this a shot because I can tell you exactly how it will end. We become attached, I do or say something that hurts you, we call the whole thing off and end up ruining our friendship and the team.”
“What time is it?” Tony asked, quickly snapping out of his thoughts. Bruce finished off the last of his sandwich before checking his watch.
“I…” Steve took a long breath. “I think you should leave. If you fall asleep then Cora might see you and--”
Steve had been running around like a chicken with its head cut off all afternoon, as he tried to get the apartment ready. On top of having his first real date night with Tony, Peggy had called to tell Steve that he'd need to take Cora again for the weekend.
It only took a moment for him to realize that the man now sitting beside him was Tony Stark. For some reason, this fact sent a strange feeling through the blond. He just shook it off before turning to face his neighbor.
“Listen, I think you’re allowed to want whoever makes you happy. If that’s Steve then that’s perfectly fine.”
Natasha narrowed her eyes at him, and Tony felt a chill run down his spine. The last thing he ever wanted was to be on Natasha’s bad side and it seemed he was working towards getting there.
“You want to sit here and pretend that you’re absolutely perfect? Fine, Steve, we’ll play that game. Tell me, then, what do I need to do to be enough for you, hmm? How much of myself do I have to give before I’m finally fucking worthy enough to have you?”
“Steve? What are you doing here, it’s not Sunday,” Sarah stated, moving out of the way to let her son in.
“I’m sorry,” Steve repeated. “I’m so sorry for everything that I have done to you over the past few months.”
The next thing Tony knew, he was in a crushing hug with the little girl. “Tank you, Ony,” she whispered. “Tank you fer comin’ back.”
“Oh, really,” the omega challenged, “you’d sue me, even though you’re the one rubbing all over my belly while I’m unconscious?”
“Hi there, baby,” Tony whispered, “since I got to see you for the first time tonight, I figured I should introduce myself.”
“I just...really wish my mom were here to see this. I know she’s always watching over me...us, but I wish she could meet Bug, y’know? Be here with me through all of this. There are some days when I worry over little things, wondering about this or that and I know if she were here she’d tell me to quit fussin’ and just enjoy this time while I have it.”
“No matter how badly I’d like for Iron Man to offset all the wrong I’ve done, I know he doesn’t. Things like this are just the world’s way of making things right.”
“Is… is that okay?” Steve asked, obviously not wanting to ask too much of his boyfriend. Tony quickly ran his free hand through his hair, giving a silent sigh.
“Miss Potts has been trying her best to keep rumors regarding your whereabouts from gaining any traction…”
No one...except for Steve, apparently. Steve who, despite filling out the sweater with his broad chest and shoulders, still had the sleeves fall just shy of the tips of his thumbs. Steve, who assumed the sweater was some kind of getaway gift, and wore it proudly as such. Steve, who was unknowingly lighting a fire under a kink that Tony really hadn't known existed prior to this very moment.
“Only a little,” Steve said, helping Tony pull his shirt the rest of the way off. “But I like it. It’s you.”
Once the initial shock wore off, he slowly stalked over to the bar, and poured himself a drink. From then on, he spent twenty-one solid days between various stages of sulking, drinking, and sleeping. He was perfectly content to live out the rest of his life like that too, but unfortunately someone else had other plans.
“Oh...alright well...follow me to my office?” Steve asked, beginning to feel nervous about whatever was coming.
Steve couldn't help the smile he cracked as he shook his head at  how ridiculous the brunet was. As if remembering that it wasn’t just the two of them on the sidewalk, Tony turned to look at his friend. “Oh, this is Lt. James Rhodes, but you can just call him Rhodey. He’s the peanut to my butter, the apple to my sauce, the mac to my cheese—”
Tony waved his hand to stop the impending congratulations he knew was coming from his friend after that.
“I bet it was a text from Stevie’s new crush,” Bucky whispered loudly to Sam, making sure Steve heard him.
Tony looked at his phone, finally, to notice that not only did he not have any new messages but it was already 8 pm. Standing there with all of his friends watching him closely, looking down at that gift box that held a brand new bottle of his shampoo for Steve, Tony gave a slightly defeated sigh then smiled weakly.
“You guys are too fucking much,” was all he could get out before a short string of poorly hidden giggles fell out of his mouth.
“Surprisingly, no,” Steve said, taking a bite of his lobster roll, trying not to acknowledge the look of surprise on the brunet’s face.
“Hey, how was coffee?” Natasha asked, pushing one of the keys on Cora’s toy piano. Steve met Bucky’s eyes, before he turned away to answer.
?” Rumlow laughed, looking at Steve. “Listen, sweet thing, why don’t you come home with me so I can show you what being with a
“So you’re going to notice something a little off about the aquarium today…” Tony started as they walked in.
Tony had tried to convince Steve to pick their date--he wanted to avoid the whole ‘picking a place that was too expensive’ thing--but Steve was insistent on their date being Tony’s choice. He wanted the brunet to set the pace, and for him to feel as comfortable as possible wherever they went. The list of places that Tony truly wanted to go where Steve wouldn’t be worried about money, was short, though it was almost a no brainer for him.
Ever since finding out that they were having a girl, Steve had been on cloud nine. Everything in the world seemed a little better and a little brighter, knowing that in a few months, he’d be bringing a little life into existence. Day in and day out, it seemed as though he and Tony continued to get closer,  without even trying. Days would go by where they would stay at each other’s apartments, sleeping side by side, fingers intertwined and resting atop of their little girl. Though at times it seemed that they were far from bonding, Steve truly felt as though they were becoming a real family.
“I’m sorry, nugget, but you can’t help with this one,” Cora’s face transformed immediately and her lip started to tremble as her eyes welled up with tears. Steve scrambled to find a way to fix what he’d done. “Uh… how about this, we’ll make Tony’s birthday cake, and you I’ll let you decorate it.”
“I never expected this to last. I mean let’s be honest, no one knows better than I do that everything I love gets ripped right out of my hands. But this…I never expected this from you. If you wanted to go you could have told me. I’m fully aware that I don’t deserve you…”
And… that should not have sounded as sexy as it did, but he was happy to oblige. Steve sucked in a rushed breath through his teeth when Tony added the third and final finger. Steve started to thrust down onto Tony’s fingers and, okay, Tony was losing his resolve. He had been determined to make this all about Steve, but he had needs, too. He used his free hand to gently stroke his own cock.
“Absolutely! I haven’t really gotten much of a chance to spend any time with Bucky outside of the holiday parties the teachers have, so I wouldn’t exactly pass up an opportunity to see what he’s like when he lets loose. I might get to hear his laugh for the first time ever.”
“Oh it was...it went well, nothing big. What’s in the bag?” Steve asked, trying to change the subject.
Tony rolled his eyes and grumbled as he got back to grading the papers on his desk. Who gave that little twerp the right to be so perceptive about Tony’s feelings anyway?
Steve was standing at the corner in front of his apartment building, waiting. He’d received a text from Natasha not long ago telling him to meet her outside. He asked why, but wasn’t given any kind of explanation. When he finally spotted the redhead coming towards him, he waved.
Tony was laughing so hard that his sides hurt. He had tears coming out of his eyes, and he was gasping for breath. He wanted to stop laughing, he really truly did, but every time he thought he had himself under control, he’d catch a glimpse of Steve and lose it all over again. This went on for a good ten minutes before the brunet was truly able to compose himself. When he did, he took a deep breath, with a smile on his face.
“Well Cap, this is how far I got before I realized that I’ve got a perfectly good collection of booze right here.”
something like that?!” Steve asked, completely taken aback. “I’m surprised you haven’t integrated JARVIS into the school.”
“How are we going to put this together? Are you sure this is what she wants to be for Halloween?” Tony asked, looking for something that might help them.
“You don’t have to forgive me right now. I wasn’t expecting you to. But please… please don’t let this be goodbye.” It was instinct that had him crashing his lips against Steve’s, only pulling away to whisper ‘please’ every few moments.
We originally said that we would be posting every Saturday, but to give ourselves a little more time to hold onto our sanity, we're going to be posting every OTHER Saturday.
Not much else needed to be said to convince Tony. He grabbed hold of his cock, gasping at the feel of his own hand. He lined himself up, noticing the fresh slick leaking out of Steve and thrust in. Both men moaned as Tony fully seated himself. He had to take a second to savor the feeling of the omega but once he wrapped his mind around what was happening, he lost himself completely in the moment.
“Corporal Steve Rogers,” he said, taking Rhodey’s hand to shake it. “Pleasure to meet you, Lieutenant.”
The fact that Tony was interested in Steve’s work was enough to stun him into silence for the following half hour as they continued their drive, listening to the rest of the playlist. Once the music stopped, Tony glanced at Steve. “So, how was your week, how’s school going?”
“Well, the way this relationship has been going, you’ve got a lot more of that to look forward to,” Tony said around a laugh of his own.
Steve had felt the weight of everything crashing down on him for a while now, but this was the first time that he’d admitted it, out loud, that he didn’t think he could do this. Bucky looked at him, sympathetically, before sighing.
Tony’s lips crashed onto Steve’s, excitedly. It was several moments before they parted, but once they did, Steve let out a small laugh.
“You, my friend, need to stay focused on your homework. Remember, people who think I’m just ‘alright’ don’t get to have fun with me and Mr. Harvey.”
“No need to thank me, I’m just doing my job as his best friend. Oh and don’t worry, you look great.”
“It was a mistake,” Steve answered, trying to keep calm, “I never meant for any of this to happen, but it did. Tony and I are doing the adult thing here and accepting the consequences of our actions.”
“So I guess that’s it then,” Tony said, pushing away any fears that he had about what the future held for them, “ we’re going to be parents.”
“Fuck if I know! Seems like trying to get in my pants was the easiest way to get the info you all needed. Tell me, how much did he have to pay you just to get me to fall halfway in love with you before pulling the rug out from under my feet?” Tony asked with a sneer.
Tony sat in stunned silence as Pepper’s words sank in. He could have smacked himself for never thinking to do so before, but Tony resolved to ask Steve out the very next time he saw him.
Hogan looked at Steve with a critical eye, before giving a single nod. “Alright. Elevators are straight ahead,” he said, pressing a button under the desk that seemed to open up the elevator doors.
With that, Pepper launched into a complete rundown of all the Stark Industries work and travel she’d been up to. Tony tried his best to give his full attention to the conversation at hand, but he couldn’t shake his concerns. The way those bots at the meetup operated seemed innocuous, but if one of them was self learning and operating on its own, it’d be a much bigger problem for Tony and Stark Industries than anyone realized.
“Because, being on your back isn’t nearly as fun alone,” Steve whispered, before planting a kiss on the Tony’s lips. A shiver went down his spine, though he wasn’t sure if it was from the cold or from the look in Steve’s eyes.
“I’d love some, thank you. And it’s pouring outside. I...ran half of the way here because I really needed to talk to you.”
and felt some weird kind of pleased possessiveness, hoping that they never play  for anyone else on that ride again. That song belonged to him and Tony...or at least it belonged to the Steve and Tony that existed before this whole mess.
anyone? Sam or Clint would have helped if you had asked! Wait...is this why you had been so sick beforehand? Did you know you were going into heat?”
Steve looked down at the little ball of adorable chubby baby in his arms and wondered over to their brand new rocking chair.
“No one’s asking you to trust it, just show up and have fun. Quit being such a stick in the mud and just enjoy yourself for once.”
Steve sat at his desk, concentrating, fully, on the illustrations he was creating for Bucky’s next piece on a new ramen bar.
“Wouldn’t I, dear old dad? All I’m really good for is disappointing you. I don’t see why I should stop doing that once you’re dead. I think I’ll just sell the company, probably to one of our foreign partners and just be done with it.”
“I’m so sorry this happened, Steve. If you’d like, I can see what I can dig up on this Tiberius guy.”
Tony wanted to believe that Steve wasn’t that kind of guy, but he’d thought the same about so many other, that at this point he wasn’t sure what to think. The only people he had ever trusted in life were Rhodey and Pepper and Bruce, but he was new. They truly saw him for who he was, but every attempt to let someone else in always blew up in Tony’s face. As these thoughts ran through his head, hot tears started to roll down his face.
“Well, I won’t be taking you up on that offer, seeing as how I have to be at work, again, tomorrow, but for what it’s worth, it probably wouldn’t take very much of these -- what did you call this? A Moscow Mule?-- It wouldn’t take many of these to pry the truth out of me.”
The shy smile that Steve gave in response was enough to take Tony’s breath away. It was several minutes before either of them moved their hand, but after that they returned to the same comfortable silence they had started with, as they finished their food.
Tony moved to stand at Steve’s side, looping his arm with the blond’s. “Listen, I know there’s more in that pretty little head of yours than just strategy and information about bodybuilding. You’re more capable of this type of engineering than you think. Plus, I can’t really let you take Sprocket home with you unless you know how to turn him off and on, so…” Tony trailed off as he lifted the screwdriver again.
“I don’t know…” Tony began, now feeling somewhat shy, “I was over at his place on Saturday night watching movies with Steve when he fell asleep on me. I ended up falling asleep as well. The next morning he tried to apologize while I was half asleep, and I accidentally told him it was ok because I thought he was cute.”
“I cannot believe how irresponsibly foolish you’ve been,” Bucky started, looking his friend in the eyes, “you think that because you’re carrying Stark’s baby, he’s suddenly going to want a relationship with you? Is that what this is about? Did you just lie to all of us, and set all of this up so you could get your crush to bed you?”
Tony felt the blood drain from his face at that. He hadn’t told a single person in the office, save for Pepper and Rhodey about the side work that he did, for fear that he might get in trouble. He had no idea how Coulson had managed to find out about it.
And with that Steve exploded, coming, untouched. It took some time for him to begin breathing normally again, but when he did all he could utter was an exhausted fuck. It looked like this was shaping up to possibly be the worst heat of Steve’s life.
As the meetup began to pick up, Tony found that he was truly enjoying himself. Even more so, he enjoyed watching Steve light up with excitement and fascination during all of the discussions and demonstrations. It was truly something to behold, watching Steve forming a love of robotics right before his eyes. Steve was already enough trouble when he was just tall, blond and handsome. Adding an interest in coding and engineering into the mix was sure to make him
“If that’s what you have to tell yourself to get through all of this then by all means, keep telling yourself that.”
Tony couldn’t help but smile wide at that. All he’d wanted was to give Steve and Coraline the absolute best. He may not have been able to spoil them as much as he would have liked, but at least he was able to put a roof over their heads.
“I know you know I do, but… I just wanted to say I love you and thank you for sharing this with me.” Steve looked down at him, a confused smile on his face, but gave one small nod.
“How could you think for a fucking second that you are a bank account to me? All I’ve ever done is love you and--”
“Yes, you do. And I love you very much Coraline, but that does not excuse you from throwing food at your daddy. Now, you and I are going to wait in the car while daddy pays the bill and gets the leftovers wrapped up, okay?”
“Yeah, I’m okay. I’m sad to hear you won’t be around for Christmas, Coraline and I will miss you, but I’m sure you’ll find a way to make the most of your trip.”
Steve stood in the middle of Natasha and Bucky’s living room, bobbing his head along to the beat of the song playing. He looked up to see Natasha moving along to the same beat. She gave him one small nod that he returned before they both hit a pose.
“Of course, I’d never forget your little guy, especially on your first big day with the team!” Tony said, jumping up, sandwich in hand, as he moved to the closet at the side of the classroom to get the box of materials for the robotics team meeting. Sitting right at the top of the box was Steve’s little bot, and the blond smiled upon seeing it.
Some part of Tony wanted to fight her on this. He wasn’t sure why, but he didn’t like the thought of his friend not supporting the relationship he most definitely wasn’t aiming for with Steve. However, he knew that Pepper was only looking out for his best interest and he couldn’t fault her for that.
“Well, as compelling as this movie is, I’d be willing to miss a little of it, for the right distraction…” Tony offered, moving to be as close to Steve as possible without actually sitting on him.
“Oh,” Steve responded, half surprised he got a reply “well I'm sorry to hear about Jarvis but I'm glad to have run into you.”
“That’s what Luke’s saying. It seems like everyone just took on their parts separately and tomorrow’s when we’ll meet to make everything more cohesive.” Steve answered, silently cursing himself for letting this assignment slip his mind.
Tony quickly turned to look at Steve beside him, eyes slightly wide in surprise. “Really?” he asked, a mix of shock and hope on his face.
“Let’s get you some breakfast, okay? How do pancakes sound?” Cora clapped her hands excitedly in lieu of a verbal answer. Steve just laughed, moving to get all the the materials and ingredients together.
“We’ve been through this, Howard. The deal was that I would come out here for Spring Break but I never agreed to actually talking to you,” Tony said, not even looking up as he tinkered with a switch board. In an instant, Howard crossed the room and snatched the items out of Tony’s hands.
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. “I need your help, Bruce, because since mentioning him, Nat won’t stop smiling like a weirdo, and Clint…” Tony paused, casting a glance at the blond, “well, he’s just useless.”
Tony rolled his eyes and practically sulked his way to his desk. He could feel Natasha’s eyes on him the entire time and once he sat in his chair, he was met with her calculating glare.
Tony sat outside of his favorite bistro waiting for his friends to arrive for breakfast. As he waited, he sat on his phone, texting Steve, a much more regular occurrence as of late. Since running into each other at the museum, Tony and Steve have become somewhat inseparable. At least as inseparable as their schedules would allow. If they weren’t spending time together, they were texting or talking on the phone. At this point their friends knew if they had their phone in hand, they were talking to one another.
There wasn't a single person who knew Tony that wasn't aware of how much he hated Christmas. Most thought Tony was a Scrooge just for the sake of it, but those close to him knew how awful the day was for him growing up. More often than not, Christmas was spent opening presents in a room alone while his parents and their house staff fussed over getting the manor ready for the annual Stark Christmas party. When that wasn't the case, Tony spent the day being looked after by Jarvis as his parents traveled the world, attending to everyone under the sun except for their only child.
“Hi, I’m here for an interview at two,” Steve said to the hostess at the front. She nodded, giving him a warm smile.
“Everything is a joke to you, Anthony!” Howard yelled. Tony actually jumped at the boom of his father’s voice. “You need to buckle down and get ready for once the company is yours, and that isn’t going to happen when you’ve got some low-life and his illegitimate daughter mooching off of you for support.”
Steve looked down into his glass with a sad smile. He wasn’t sure if now was the time to tell Tony about his family or not. Deciding that was a conversation best saved for another day, Steve looked up to direct his smile at the alpha in front of him.
Tony didn’t even have a chance to open his mouth, once they got to the table, before Natasha practically skipped over to throw her arms around Steve’s neck in a hug. She turned to the rest of the group, and clapped her hands together. “Group, this is Steve, my fiance’s best friend. Since you’re all adults you can introduce yourselves.”
“You okay babe?” He asked, eyes glued to the man in front of him. Steve just picked at a loose thread in his sweater before looking up with a weak smile.
“I did this for us,” Tony replied, proud of his cheesy banter. “And I didn’t tell you that you were allowed to take off the blindf—”
Tony sat there across from Steve, watching the omega struggle to choose exactly what he wanted to eat. Once they had decided to go out for food, Steve almost immediately suggested going for breakfast food. Tony was more than happy to oblige thinking the blond knew exactly what he wanted. However, 20 minutes into their stay at IHOP, and after the fifth time of Steve looking through the menu front to back, Tony just smiled to himself.
While he went through his third outfit change, Steve heard a knock at the door. His heart skipped a beat at the thought that Tony had just showed up super early. He quickly made his way to the door, surprised to see Pepper on the other end.
They walked into the dimly lit gym, and Steve took stock of his surroundings. It looked like any other run of the mill high school gymnasium, with the bleachers folded into the wall, basketball court marked out on the floor tiles, and doors towards the back leading to what looked to be offices. Despite all of this, though, for some reason, Steve found himself feeling an unwavering sense of joy, excitement, and gratefulness looking at the room where he’d be spending most of his time over the next several months.
“So… what was it that you wanted to talk about?” It was obvious that Steve had been itching to ask about this. With a sigh, Tony finally decided it was time to stop avoiding the subject.
Steve smiled down at Tony, wracking his hands through his hair. “Is Naked Christmas the only way it’ll take to make you start loving this holiday?”
He looked at the item for a moment before registering the redhead’s words. He moved to go after Steve, not really sure where he had gone or how to track him down. Thankfully, after twenty minutes of walking, Tony found Steve standing on an overpass. He walked over, covering the man with his umbrella. They stood there in silence, looking out at the city around them.
They sat quietly for most of their ride, although at some point, Steve reached over hesitantly to take Tony’s hand. They both smiled at each other, Steve letting out a sigh of relief when Tony didn’t take his hand away.
“You see this little black mass right here? That would be your baby.” Dr. Banner spoke with a smile.
Tony wanted desperately to ask what was wrong, but it was obvious Steve didn’t want to share. Every so often, he’d glance at Steve. Eventually Tony gave in and attempted to make small talk.
“I uh….nothing…” Tony answered, hoping his voice didn’t sound nearly as high pitched as he thought it did.
Steve sighed heavily, taking in the hopeful looks they gave him. He really didn’t want to agree with them, but they were right. Eventually he would have to face Tony; better to do it sooner rather than later.
“You’re amazing, Steve,” Tony said, resting his hand on Steve’s cheek. He was about to lean in for a kiss before he felt little pieces of cereal hit his face. Tony turned to see Coraline snickering.
“Babe, I’ll have my cell phone, you can call or text me any time,” Tony offered, seemingly confused by the conversation at hand. Steve just sighed before he continued.
“So, if I check your bank statement am I going to find that you’ve thrown away all your money at a certain bar named after a spider?”
“Tony, if you know what’s good for you, you’ll just let them work. We’ve got no clue how to make a costume, let alone one that looks like a chicken nugget,” Steve said, hauling their purchases up to his apartment. Once inside, everyone spread out to work on their own projects. Though Steve and Tony had found costumes, they’d decided to add some flare to them.
“Just… this. Driving with you, holding your hand, enjoying being here next to you. I’ve just really missed being happy with you.”
“Hey, nugget. Would you mind talking to me one on one for a minute? Would you mind if I kicked daddy out of the room for a bit?”
“They are. You’ll love them once you meet them,” the words came out of his mouth before Tony had the time to actually register the implications.
“Yes. If we were alone and he wanted to know, I would tell him. It’s just not information that I need to share with the rest of the class.”
Tony felt himself tense up at the pat on the shoulder Ty gave him before leaving. He had to mentally work through getting his muscles to relax, and yet he still felt some measure of tightness in his chest. Any other day, this feeling may have made Tony think there was something wrong with the arc reactor, but in this instance, he knew this was dread.
“I guess I probably should have made you sign some kind of NDA before bringing you here, but you seem like a pretty trustworthy fella,” Tony smiled over his shoulder as he waved his phone in front of the door handle.
Steve considered the question. He thought back over the last few months, remembering how difficult and horrible everything seemed without Tony by his side.
Steve had usually appreciated this side of Natasha, but today, he genuinely wished she’d just let him be. He knew what was ahead of him back at his apartment and he didn’t want any part of it. Having to explain himself, what happened back in December, the feelings he’d been having for his friend...it was all too much right now. But some very small part of him wanted to reach out and ask Natasha to never leave his side. He’d been holding on to the secret of what had happened between him and Tony and he felt as though it had been eating him alive. Little did he know that feeling was just evidence of what had transpired between the two, growing for all the world to see.
Steve reached down to gently take hold of Tony’s face before kissing him softly. “You’re amazing,” he whispered, resting his forehead on the brunet’s.
As tired as he was, Steve stood and walked to the bathroom to turn on the shower. Watching Tony leave after what had happened between them was hard. Steve wanted to feel the alpha’s arms around him again, and to kiss him again. But for now, he’d just have to settle for smelling like him.
“Yeah, he recently started working there and he’s great! He’s got a dry sense of humor, similar to my own, and just...life doesn't seem so complicated there. I walk in, have a drink or two, get to know Steve, then come home.”
Tony couldn’t breathe. Sure, he inhaled and exhaled the proper amount of times for a human being, but that was just to keep him alive. An involuntary reflex that his body required him to do. If he were to stop, he’d pass out and then start again in his sleep.
“Tony?” Steve asked, completely taken by surprise by the sight of the brunet. Tony walked into the apartment, not saying a single word, and just stood there.
“If that's the case, then why am I seeing all these stories from trash magazines saying you’ve been spending every day there for the last couple of weeks?” Rhodey asked, concern lacing his voice.
By the time Friday night, rolled around, Steve was buzzing with excitement and anticipation. He couldn’t wait for his dearest friends to finally get to spend time with Tony, but even more so, he couldn’t wait to finally see the man again. As he rode with Natasha, Bucky, Sam and Clint, Steve could barely contain himself.
Tony saw the way Steve’s eyes softened at the invitation. “Yeah I...I think I’d like that,” the blond replied, softly. The three of them left the classroom, heading for the parking lot.
In that moment, the alpha realized that if this was going to work he was going to have to be harsh to get his point across.
Steve pulled his scarf up, covering his bearded cheeks and mouth from what he could hear was a strong and likely bitter wind. He followed Tony in silence as they made their way outside to slowly but surely navigate through the worsening blizzard across the street. It took a bit longer than Tony initially predicted, but the second they entered the warm lobby of his building, both men let out a sigh of relief.
“Just...how nice it would be for Tony, Bug and I to be a real family. I mean we both love  this baby with everything we have, but…” Steve trailed off.
“Alright, fine,” Tony said, wiping at his eyes as he made his way to the door. He stood in the doorway for a moment, before turning to look at Steve one last time. “You know, while you’re sitting here trying to figure out how to tell Cora that I won’t be around anymore, you might also want to work out how to tell her that it’s your fault I left.”
Tony wasn't exactly sure of the time when he left work, but it looked like it had just become dark out so it wasn't too late. He walked down the street a ways from SI to find a sultry looking bar. The building was black, with a red logo in the center of a seductive looking name. Tony figured this bar would be as good as any, and walked inside. Thankfully, it wasn’t very busy, so he took a seat at the counter. He quickly placed his head in his hands, and closed his eyes as he tried to gather his thoughts.
“I can smell the carbonara, which means you messed up and you need our help,” the blonde said, stepping into the house.
“Oh, I uh…” Tony began, “I’m not doing too much of anything really. My family is kind of...all over the place so we’re not really able to get together during holidays.”
