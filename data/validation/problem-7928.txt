miss him now.
Steve turned the key in the ignition. “Ready for home?”
Rhodey scoffed. “Never,” he agreed.
Well, that much was true, but it didn’t make Tony feel any better. He took a deep breath, tried to calm down, to think rationally. He couldn’t stop the sinking feeling from settling in his chest though, or the wave of nausea that was threatening to surge up. He really didn’t need this. He was due to go into labor in two weeks, and had just started to properly speak to Steve again. He relied on that contact now, for health reasons, and also, he…he was starting to
He felt awful. He felt angry, and embarrassed, and hurt.
“So chivalrous,” Tony teased.
was crying. He could feel the hot tears running down his cheeks, but didn’t move to wipe them. He didn’t have a hand to spare at the moment.
“I love you,” Tony breathed. He turned, wrapped his arms around the soldier in a tight embrace. “God, I fucking love you. How are you even real?”
Steve followed his direction without hesitation, spread his legs so Tony could fit between them. Tony crawled forward a little, and got to work, kissing and teasing his way down from the blond’s chest, tweaking his nipples, laving his tongue over the planes of muscle, slow and steady. He knew what he was doing, knew which spots to touch, how to touch. It hardly took any time for Steve to lose himself to it.
“Ah…!”
“That’s good,” Steve sighed, took a second to collect himself. “So good.” He rolled his hips forward experimentally, and when Tony relaxed around him, he started fucking his mouth. His pace wasn’t slow, but wasn’t all that fast either. He took his time, savored the wet heat around his cock, the way Tony made room for it.
Steve’s apartment was on the 6
afterwards, and how affectionate Steve was when it was all over. It was always intense, sometimes almost too intense, but Tony loved a challenge, and he loved the idea that only he could handle Steve, that no one else had the privilege to.
He leaned forward a little further, nuzzled Tony’s neck, let out a pleased little whine as he kept cumming, coasting on the pleasure of having Tony below him, being inside him, being together. He’d never get enough of it, was so lucky to have it.
Ultron. Fucking Ultron. Why did Tony think he could do something good? Why did he think he could get one step ahead of whatever was coming? Why did he ever think he would be that lucky? And the way the damn thing
Tony took his words to heart. He took a deep breath, tried to get more comfortable, tried to forget about the ceaseless pain rattling around in his head. It wasn’t easy, by any means, but knowing that he had Steve here with him made it a fraction easier to bear.
individuals, Tony stood out like a flashlight in the dark. Steve had been drawn to him like a moth to the flame, and although it was all initially quite innocent, with him simply being curious about Tony and wanting to get to know him, somewhere during the following parties and dinners and visits to Howard’s mansion Steve was getting his heartstrings tugged by those deft (and pampered) little fingers.
“God, you feel good,” Steve groaned between thrusts, his fingers flexing around Tony’s thighs a little, holding him closer, tighter, relishing in his presence, the little moans his fucking drew out of the brunet. Tony was saying his name, breathless and desperate, and it had pleasure rolling so deep through Steve he felt a little lightheaded with it.
That led to the third reason he was nervous. Tony was so quiet right now. He was so damn quiet. Tony was a talker; he had a lot to say, and liked to say it, went on and on with jokes or lectures or flirtatious suggestions for the most part, so to see him sitting here, looking weary and a little dazed and keeping his mouth firmly shut was well out of the ordinary. It made Steve feel young and stupid and scared, and he wasn’t sure how he was holding it all together.
The rest of the world was unimportant, hardly existed in their minds. All that mattered was the two of them, and the little baby cradled in Tony’s arms, and the renewed promise they were making to each other.
He braced his front paws on the bed, on either side of Tony’s shoulders, and fucked into him.
“Yours,” Tony agreed. “All yours. I’m all open, ready just for you, for my big, good boy,” he purred, partly breathless, and it was worth it for way Steve’s cock pulsed inside him, pleased with the praise.
Steve had a hand wrapped around his leg, lifting it up to spread him wider. The other hand was curled down by his cock, wrapped around the dildo beside it so he could fuck Tony two ways, fuck him good and well.
He could be idle today though. He
Steve’s body was warm against his, so warm, and he could feel the blond’s heartbeat against his shoulder, a steady rhythm, kind and firm, unlike the cacophonous pulse of the bass at the party, invasive,
“Oh fuck, Steve, fuck me already,” Tony said, exhaled softly. He wiped Steve’s saliva off of his face with his arm.
For a second, he got the urge to kiss Steve. He wanted to, wanted to pretend that nothing bad had ever happened at all, that he’d been here the whole time, that they were happy and at peace, but…he couldn’t. Not yet. He knew if he kissed Steve now, his heart would well and truly be lost again, and he wouldn’t be in control anymore. He needed the control. There was a lot more to say, to do. Tony wasn’t going to lose himself so easily again, wasn’t going to fall entirely until he knew for sure things were okay.
Steve spun him around, gave him a little shove (careful of his strength of course) towards the bed. “Get on the bed,” he ordered.
Tony looked at his husband and child fondly, lining up the camera properly to get a good shot. His sunglasses were resting on his head, and he had to make sure they didn’t slip, but managed just fine, kept his attention on the task at hand.
“Pushed me into the desk,” Tony explained quietly, as if he was ashamed to even admit it.
Tony snorted at that. “I wish it was that easy,” he replied morosely. “I wish I was some doe-eyed, easily swayed bitch. I wish I could just roll over and give myself to him on a silver platter.”
“Have I learned my lesson?” he asked, voice rough, huskier, from the delicious abuse his throat had suffered. “Gee, I don’t know Steve! I was kind of too busy trying not to pass out to absorb anything,” he said dramatically. “If you wanted to choke me to death, you should’ve done it immediately, instead of leaving me with a year-long hard on.”
Tony blinked at him, sobering up rather quickly at the question.
She was out of her chair and in the hall before Tony could properly protest, and he laid there, holding his child, confused,
“I want that,” Tony replied, groaning a little. He put his hands on Steve’s shoulders, ground down against the bulge growing in the blond’s jeans, huge and familiar, and hell, he wanted it. He wanted it bad. He wanted to feel it spread him open, fill him up. He wanted to hear Steve moaning in his ear, telling him how good he was, how good he felt, fucking him long and hard, or slow and gentle, or both, every which way, however Steve wanted it, whatever he would give. “Fuck, I want that,” he sighed.
sure that looked good in this thing.
Steve pulled back, brows pinched. “Buck, I—I don’t regret saving you, I could never—“
“If Ross had something against you, he’d be here already. You know he’s been dying to fuck things up ever since you threatened him,” Rhodey replied.
He loved helping Steve through his ruts, even though they were
each other, as they have been. Soon, they’d be back to routine, with projects and appearances and the occasional mission taking up their time.
Steve couldn’t help but chase Tony’s lips, capture them in a kiss. His fingers settled on the brunet’s hips again, and god, kissing him felt like Heaven, like it always did, and honestly? He didn’t really want to fight this anymore. Tony was offering himself—hell, he’d been sitting
“Okay, baby, come sit on my lap,” Steve said softly. He was sitting on his bed, back to the headboard. His white cotton shirt was already half unbuttoned—it was hot today—and his jeans were rolled up past his ankles. He looked horribly attractive, as usual, and Tony had no problem following his direction.
They’d been
“I’m sure you’ve suffered worse.”
“No promises,” Ross replied, and straightened his jacket. He didn’t look any happier than when he came, but by the look on his face, this impromptu meeting was, thankfully, drawing to a close.
The ring on his left hand felt like a tether now, keeping him grounded, connected, as it so often did. He loved its subtle weight, the promise that it carried.
He set his brush down, wiped his hands on his cloth.
. What had he gotten himself into? Why was he like this? Why couldn’t anything just go right for him?
Steve hit his prostate just there, made sure to press against it all the way in and out, and it sent pleasure right up Tony’s spine, had him arching up off the bed. Steve really got into it then, braced his hands on the bed on either side of the brunet’s head, bent low over him so he could thrust in deep, and soon he got a rhythm going, not too fast but not too slow, a little more relaxed than they usually took it. Time was often of the essence, or sometimes they were just impatient, liked it hard, a little rough, like all the times Tony got Steve worked up, got him heated, because he knew it’d make the blond fuck him harder, really make him feel it.
(See the end of the chapter for
he told himself when his eyes finally welled up with tears.
his son, his kind, and intelligent, and beautiful son, who Steve loved more than anything in the world. It drove Steve nuts that he couldn’t protect Tony, that Tony wouldn’t
She is not allowed to dwell on mischief too long, the conversation turns to brightness, and the evening is mostly pleasant aside Mrs. Hammers remarks here and there that dug like little burrs into Antonia’s sides. It wasn’t too long before her dinner even featured some very exciting news, courtesy of Mr. Marvel.
“Ah no,” the words come out hoarse, he lets a cough rattle in order to clear it out again, “No I will make my way home. The fire is a little too warm for me tonight I think.” He paces a couple steps further, letting space yawn between him and Antonia. He doesn’t think he can stand to be close enough to count the eyelashes at this moment. He bows shortly, neck bent, before letting a smile rip fleetingly across his features and leaving through the glass bay doors.
“You’re right, it isn’t any of my business.” Maria’s voice is so sad it’s
Steve stands soaking under the downpour, arms full of the man he loves, and begins to heal.
It’s no difference to many other Thanksgivings they have had. And yet.
“Yeah that’s true. I’ve known some great women, and men, earning their living through their body. Just surprised they thought you were one, Mr Apple Pie. Where am I picking up someone as gorgeous as you?” Tony jokes.
The whole party had just reassembled in the drawing room after dinner when Mr. Marvel made his appearance among them. He had been unable to be a fixture for the dinner, but he made up for it by walking to Hartfield as soon as it was over. Mr. Banner was in astonishment, - that a man who might have spent his evening quietly at home after a day of business, should set off again, and walk half a mile to another man’s house, for the sake of being in mixed company until bed time, of finishing off his day in efforts of being civil and noise. Could he have been clicked his fingers and been back to his dear wife and other children he would have done so. For introverted as he was – long evenings forced to be social were not his speed.
“Not at all, Mrs. Stark. I found the walk quite refreshing, and the weather so mild I cannot bear to be too close to your great fire. Besides, I was sure Antonia would be up to no good without someone here to put a damper on her matchmaking. Who cried most when I wrote of extending my stay in London?” Steve asked, eyes glittering with humour.
” Antonia seems unable to do much but repeat herself. “It appeared to me to relate to a different person, for I thought you meant the service Mr. Clint Barton rendered you, in protecting you from the gypsies. I could swear it was even named. I said I did not wonder at your attachment – mentioning even what your sensations must have been in seeing him come forward to your rescue. I remember uttering those exact words.”
to refuse him. Although, of course I do not want to influence you. But understand that. In doing so, if you were to accept this proposal you doubt so clearly, I would lose you forever as a friend. For I could never visit a Mrs. James Rhodes of Abbey Mill Farm for fear of ridicule and being outcast by high society. No, no if you don’t accept we can remain firm friends forever.”
He idly noted, with a faint blush across his face, that she looked magnificent like this.
She could not enter the house again, could not be in the same room to which she had with such vain artifice retreated three months ago, without
“The awkward flirting is what got you? Man you must be smitten, I find watching it worse than pulling teeth.” Sam interjects, and Steve whirls on him with betrayal in his eyes.
Why he chose to associate with Antonia, the town (and Antonia herself) had no idea.
The weather affected Mrs. Stark and Antonia both. It made Antonia stew further, and Mrs. Stark could not bring her out of it regardless of what she tried. If Captain Rogers had attended this evening, he would have been sure of a long evening and kept them both entertained with quick, acerbic wit and fleecing them at a game of cards. The fact he wasn’t present, the fact he was hundreds of miles away in London, only served to further ache Antonia’s heart. And the knowledge that this might be a consistency she would have to get used to, that Steven might no longer come for his evening comfort, no longer walk in at all hours, lost to them either for their disintegrating friendship, or for Pepper’s sake. Antonia’s wretchedness would only increase if Pepper was to be the chosen, the first, the dearest, the friend, the wife to whom he looked for. The mistress of Donwell who wrote the invitations that Antonia was likely to have to accept on behalf of Hartfield, and attend gatherings with her wished happiness like a glass reflection, never far or distant enough to stop her torture.
, sweetheart—shit, Tony, Tony—“
Steve knew Tony was a brat when they started dating. He knew Tony was a brat the day they met, actually, when Howard dragged his then 19 year old son to Steve’s retirement party after his ice-induced coma. After almost dying and waking up in a completely new world, Steve kind of had enough of fighting, and wanted to do something else with his time. He was offered a position at SHIELD, but that didn’t seem right either. He would lend his aid should an emergency arise, of course, but had no desire to return to the daily drills and strict rules of the military.
Tony tried to believe it. He had to. He squeezed Rhodey’s hand, first in thanks, but then the ceaseless pain crested again, and then he squeezed to retain his sanity, to stay grounded as the pressure intensified, and the urge to push overcame him.
“Fuck, oh god…!”
Everything coming out of the brunet’s mouth was
“You’re delusional,” Tony replied, and the hand near Steve’s ass slid immediately back up towards his shoulders. “I’m talking to
He couldn’t stay in bed any longer. Tony brushed a hand over his face, rubbed his tired eyes, and blinked, looked around the room. Steve was nowhere to be found, which was a little disappointing, but not all that surprising. He didn’t really expect Steve to be next to him when he woke up. Hell, he didn’t expect to be in his
him to keep his hands off, took any and every opportunity to get a little frisky, would gladly drown in the sensation of the soldier’s hands on her, his voice in her ear, his lips on her lips.

“That so, Mr. Stark-Rogers?” Steve asked, shifting his position a little where he was straddling the brunet. The fabric of his swim shorts was a little rough, kind of starchy no doubt from stray grains of sand, but neither were particularly worried about making a mess in the bed. They never were.
Sam did his best piloting. He tried to keep them out of the line of fire as long as possible, bobbed and weaved and used all the maneuvers he’d learned over the years, but it hadn’t been enough. He barely had enough time to warn the others to brace for impact with how fast they dropped out of the sky. Honestly, they should consider themselves lucky they didn’t go down in the ocean; the forest they landed in offered enough cover and chaos to flee the crash site, to try and find safety.
with Steve. At least, Steve hoped he did. Or was he really just speaking to Steve out of necessity now, for the baby? Would he ever look fondly upon or
He was sort of in the middle at the moment, torn between taking a little more control, fucking Tony’s mouth properly, or letting himself sink further into the bed, letting the brunet’s sucking and teasing carry him over the peak. Tony’s tongue swirled across the head of his cock again and again, slow but insistent, and Steve couldn’t help but let out a whimper, felt that pit in his gut tug at his senses. There were goosebumps rolling up his arms and his nipples were hard, his breath coming out in little gasps at how good it was. He wouldn’t last much longer.
Although Tony knew it was impossible, the fantasy, one of many, honestly, was charming enough to have him leaking a little from the head.
It was a gorgeous dark blue, smarter than big bold red white and blue, because Steve would be going on stealth missions now, and it wouldn’t do him any good to stick out like a firecracker on the 4
Pepper came back with Rhodey seconds later, with the doctor on their heels. Rhodey gave Tony a reassuring smile as he entered, came to stand at his side. Pepper started wringing her hands though, and Tony didn’t feel very reassured.
Tony interrupted.
“I think so too,” Steve replied. He took a few steps forward. “I thought I knew what I was doing. After everything with SHIELD, it just…it seemed impossible to put my trust in another organization. And then with Bucky involved, it just kept escalating. I’m sorry I got us all into this mess, I really am, and I know saying all of this doesn’t change anything, but…I really hope we can still be teammates. I hope we can still be
Then again, Jarvis had always been able to see through his lies, so he might have just had to tell the truth regardless, and prayed that the man wouldn’t share the news with his father. He was dreading that more than anything, right now. Howard didn’t approve of his partying. Well, what
“What did you do?” Tony asked, equal parts mortified and honored, gripping his jacket in his lap.
They’d had a good long rest, honestly, first with living at the lake house and now on this amazing trip, but, there was always room for a little more rest, like now, sprawled out on the bed and feeling happy and sun-baked.
Tony shook his head. “Not yet. I—I’ve been kind of scared to,” he admitted. The longer he stayed away from the hard data, the more he could convince himself that everything was fine. If he saw the truth though, and it was something terrible, there’d be no taking that knowledge back.
Rhodey wished it was over now. He wished he could make it over, for his friend’s sake. He took in the exhaustion on Tony’s face, the way it was flushed and clammy, and how he trembled slightly. He’d spent hours listening to Tony struggling, his strained babbling. All Rhodey could offer to fix it were words.
Tony wiggled his hips back into Steve’s hands, pressed his forehead against the bed. “I’d prefer yours, but I’ll find another one to do the job if you won’t,” he threatened. It was an empty threat, and they both knew it, but it was still enough to get Steve’s jealousy going, to dig in under his skin.
They could hear the music blaring from a few houses away, saw the bright party lights filtering through the blinds. It was for all intents and purposes, a college party, not too far away from the campus of Brooklyn College. Tony didn’t really go out to clubs or anything like that too often, because they were too public. Half of the people at college parties couldn’t legally drink, so they were a little better at keeping their mouths shut when someone with a name like his came around.
They’d had quite a talk in the shower earlier, but hadn’t said much to each other in private since. Clint’s wife had been kind enough to provide them with some dinner, but Tony could hardly eat. The team was exhausted, ate in near silence, and then everyone retreated to their appropriate guest rooms intent on getting rest.
he thought to himself, but kept quiet instead.
His eyes caught sight of the marks decorating Tony’s arm now. They weren’t there yesterday. Steve’s fingers brushed over them ever so slightly, but Tony still flinched.
If she was reaching out like that, Steve could indulge her. He was thankful for it, actually. Wanda never seemed to really judge him, or blame him, even with all that had happened. But then again, being orphaned and losing her brother probably made her more aware of the importance of sticking together, gave her an extra supply of patience the others didn’t have.
Peter shook his head at the accusation, muttered a “Nuh uh!” but he was clearly just trying to save face.
because you-you’re—“
to fight it anymore.
Steve took a step forward, and then another, his breathing harsh, shaky, just like Tony’s was a minute ago. His face, still so handsome, still the face of Tony’s mate, was filled with such desperation that Tony could feel it in his own heart, could feel it through the ache in his neck, which seemed to increase
Tony was in a similar boat. He was still exhausted and irritable, and sometimes he didn’t have the energy to do much but sit there, which annoyed the brunet to no end. He wanted to feel entirely better, wanted to feel normal again, but he wouldn’t have that chance for a long time. He was excited for the baby of course, but couldn’t help but feel a little bitterness settle in him, directed at Steve naturally, because he was the reason Tony was carrying in the first place.
When he was gone for good, Tony let out a sigh, practically deflated in his seat. He closed his eyes, massaged his temple—this entire situation was giving him a headache. He wanted to feel relieved, wanted to be reassured by the fact that they hadn’t been arrested, but it only served to make him more tense.
It took Tony longer to fall asleep. He couldn’t help but think about the recent events, about the future too. He couldn’t help but think about the vision he’d been given, how broken and weak Steve was, how hurt he sounded, asking Tony why he hadn’t done more to save them all. He never wanted to relive it, and never wanted to see it come to fruition.
true. He was the most earnest guy Tony had ever met, was always honest and kind, and saw Tony for what he was, for who he was. God, he loved the man.
The point was, it was better to keep it all to themselves, lest his father managed to take a closer look at them and realize what had been going on under his nose all this time.
Rhodey put a full plate of food in front of him, and a bottle of maple syrup too. “Eat up,” he said, and turned to the fridge, to get him something to drink.
“Peter it is,” the midwife agreed, at the side of his bed. “Come on, Peter needs to get cleaned up, and you need to push again.” She leaned down and began to pull the baby from his arms.
When he got to the kitchen and living room, Steve was nowhere to be found, which was more than a little disappointing, but Tony suspected he had a routine to follow, and just because Tony was knocked out in his bed didn’t mean he couldn’t follow it. Tony thought about snooping around to find some pain killers for his headache, but settled for downing half of the water bottle he’d left on the coffee table the night before, cringing just a little because it was warm now. It’d be rude to make himself at home though, to go looking through Steve’s things, even if he was left alone here. He of all people understood the subject of crossing boundaries.
“Fuck you,” Tony muttered to himself, dragged a hand through his mussed-up hair.
him, and the high of chasing his next orgasm. He’d reached that point 20 minutes ago.
to get better. He wasn’t going to let things stay as they were.
“Could’ve gone better too,” Rhodey countered, still frowning. He brushed a protective hand through Tony’s hair; it was as much for the brunet’s comfort as his.
. Where was he supposed to go from here? Where could he lead them?
“Hold on,” he said, drawing away from Steve’s lips, even as it pained him to do so. The blond’s bangs were a little disheveled, and his cheeks were flushed a little, eyes piercing, and oh yeah, it was better to stop now, before Tony let those eyes swallow him up entirely.
he thought.
Thanks so much for reading!! Please leave your thoughts in a comment!!
Natasha’s voice cut through his thoughts, through the haze of despair. He couldn’t despair, couldn’t give up—not yet. He had to try, had to try and fix this all one last time.
Steve pitched forward a few inches without warning, slid against his prostate and Tony took in a sharp breath. “W-wait!
more or less that Tony ask him out and holy shit—
“Left it,” Tony muttered. “At the party.”
“Yes, daddy dearest,” Tony said bitterly, and left the room as quick as he could before Howard could say, or do, anything else to him.
A pause. [Call you.]
First off, there was the material. It was vaguely spandex-y, with little to no padding. From what Tony remembered of the suit his dad had made Steve in WW2, there were pockets upon pockets, reinforced but flexible boning and heavy duty materials to at least stifle, if not prevent, bullets from penetrating the suit.
Maybe they were an odd pair, with their differing life experiences, but they were perfectly matched because of them. They could relate to each other in ways not many people could, and Tony was thankful for that. He was thankful for Steve, and he didn’t intend to ever let him go.
When Steve drew back, Tony let out a shaky little breath. “I fucking love you, Steve,” he said, resting his head on the blond’s shoulder. He pulled their joined hands up to his face, smiled a little as the soldier’s fingertips brushed against his cheek. Steve followed the motion, cradled the brunet’s face in his hand. “Love you so much. I always have.”
Tony drew back then, sat up straight once more, a little more serious in his tone. “But right now I’d kinda like to take a shower. Is it okay if I use yours? I probably smell, and my hair feels gross, and it’s bad enough I left my germs all over your bed.”
Silence.
Tony looked up at Rhodey. Rhodey looked back down at him expectantly, his shoulders squared, ready to listen.
“Turn around, and lay down.”
It took about fifteen minutes for Tony to realize that Steve was drawing him. The blond had been staring intensely at his face for a while, trying to capture every detail. He’d drawn Tony so many times, but he was never quite satisfied with the outcome.
“…As long as you’re doing something, it should be fine. Though I do think you’ll feel better faster if you’re hearing each other’s voices,” Rhodey said.
“We wouldn’t be here at all right now if it weren’t an emergency,” Steve agreed, his eyes flitting to Sam, and then back to T’challa. “We’d never want to give the UN reason to be suspicious, but I—we—don’t have anywhere else to turn.”
It was just sweet enough, with the cinnamon sprinkled over the top standing out but not being too overpowering. The vanilla ice cream was already melting a little, which made for the best gooey, warm bite of pie imaginable. There were few better simple pleasures in life, honestly. The scientist had helped peel the apples for the filling, but other than that, it was all thanks to Steve that he had this wonderful dessert. Steve didn’t bake
“This is humiliating,” Tony sighed as Steve took a few steps, got him closer to the tree. He pulled off another apple, leaned over a little to let it fall in the basket.
He wished he’d been caught, when the jet crashed. Even if he were in prison now, he’d be close enough for Tony to visit, be able to see him, talk to him, even if Tony stood on the opposite side of the cell and cursed him, yelled at him, threw every harsh and biting word he could think of in Steve’s face, alongside the list of his failures. At this point, he’d welcome the punishment, welcome the prospect of Tony damning his name, if only he could
The brunet kind of drowned in it, and under better circumstances Steve would have thought it was cute.
Steve let out a little grunt, and his elbow dropped slightly, and the line he was painting came out jagged.
Steve said.
Fury had a habit of intruding on his life for the past few years, and it didn’t seem that was changing anytime soon. Wasn’t he legally dead right now anyway? Then why was he pulling a stunt like this? Didn’t he have enough lackeys to get the job done? What right did he have to order them around? Especially today of all days. Tony knew he should have blocked any incoming calls today. He lamented the fact that he didn’t.
Tony let out a breathy little moan. God, it felt so good, whenever Steve said nice things about him. It made him burn with embarrassment, with delight, and Steve knew it. He didn’t do it often, saved his praises for days like today, when Tony had been brought low. Normally they were more playful, always pushing each other, challenging each other, but occasionally Steve went soft like this, sensual and attentive, and that always hit Tony so much harder. Tony knew he was doing it on purpose now, was trying to make Tony feel better, and boy, was it going to work, like it always worked. Steve made it so easy to fall into it, to let the blond’s voice overcome the harsh, critical one in Tony’s brain. Steve made it easy to be owned, to forget about everything except the two of them, here and now, and to be entirely content with it.
erratic. Rhodey recognized the maneuvers, of course, after flying so many missions himself. The team was definitely pursued, and the pilot, most likely Sam, tried to get the enemy off their tail. They probably got hit, and went down. What happened next, only time would tell.
“Am I an idiot?” the brunet wondered out loud.
“You needed stitches,” Pepper confirmed, watching him intently. “You were bleeding a lot. It took a long time to stabilize you. They worried you wouldn’t wake up again for a while; your vitals were all over the place, but you pulled through. You won’t be able to move too much for a while. The birth was very hard on your body. It’ll take a long time to heal.”
“Isn’t there anything we can do?” he asked, gently rubbing Tony’s shoulder, trying to ease even a fraction of the pain he felt right now. He wasn’t sure he could.
Still, he felt bad about it all, and certainly felt bad about leaving his own jacket behind in his hurry to get out of the party house.
Steve had warned him a few times already, but every time, those gorgeous, dark eyes would simply fill with defiance, with an invitation, and Steve had to shut his mouth and swallow hard to keep from taking it. He knew Tony was doing this on purpose. He knew the brat was going to get what he wanted, as he always did.
Steve tried to talk, but all that came out was a choked sob.
he approve of? But Tony didn’t want to make him angry, didn’t want to end up with another nasty bruise like he’d gotten a few weeks ago. Anything but that.
He really hated conversations like these.
Natasha laughed, gave him a smile, and nodded a little. “Ain’t that the damn truth. Alright honey, how do you want it?” the brunette asked, let her deft fingers travel down his shoulders, cup his pecs. He had a hickey or two on his skin, near his collarbone, just as her own neck was marked up, and the sight of it sent heat pooling between her legs.
The other Alpha smiled a little. “Well, hate to break it to you, but they suck.”
age, and knew him…back then.”
“I love mentioning him specifically for the look on your face when I do it,” Tony said, grinning.
He pulled shit like this quite often, actually. He didn’t like to be told no, and although he’d never
“Before we know it, he’ll be moving out,” he muttered sourly.
So he curled up on the couch, waited for Steve to come back from wherever the hell he was, fiddling with the thin, gold chain around his neck. The clock on the wall told him it was already 10, and he wondered how long Steve had been gone, and when he’d be coming back. He wondered what Steve did every morning, if he’d already eaten breakfast for himself, gone on a run or something. He wondered if Steve was a quick riser or if he lingered in bed like Tony did, unless driven to action by one project or another. He wondered a lot, and although he knew Steve pretty well, he wanted to know more, wanted to know the things he kept to himself, that he didn’t share with others. Tony wanted to know it all.
Steve rolled his eyes a little. “Ha ha,” he replied. “Just trying to get your eyes right. It’s so hard.”
“Relax? How can I relax? They could be dead, or captured! Shit, if they’re caught, if Ross gets them to talk, we’re
[Looking like a blimp.]
Tony had another quip lined up, but then Steve was feeding him his cock, and his mouth got kind of busy. It slid in, inch by inch, taking him, filling him,
He lifted their intertwined hands, looked at Steve with his pretty eyes, dark and full of emotion. Tony had never been that great at talking about his feelings, except with a handful of people. Rhodey could read him really well, always could, but even he took a little bit of coaxing for Tony to open up when something was bothering him. With Steve it felt easier, less painful, to admit what he was feeling, what he was thinking. That was equal parts thrilling and terrifying.
Steve scoffed at that. He turned and braced his hands on either side of Tony’s face, leaned down low. “You can clean yourself up, princess.”
part of him, wanted for it all to end. He was nervous, honestly, to hop into the fray again, for maybe the first time in his life. He was nervous of screwing it up again, and that someone else would get hurt, or something terrible would happen because of him. His team didn’t feel like a team at the moment anymore either. Sam was still angry with him, he knew, and being in close proximity seemed to do nothing to dampen the flames of his anger.
“I… I guess that’s true,” Steve replied with a sigh, but he didn’t seem happy about it. He knew Tony’s situation with Howard wasn’t exactly ideal, in any capacity. Steve didn’t know the extent of the strain on their relationship, but there was always something a little wrong in Tony’s eyes when they were in the same room, and he wasn’t surprised Tony wanted to avoid any kind of altercation tonight.
of you. I know you’re going to yell at me, damn me, and if you could, you would send me away, and I’m
“Well, we better go pay for these and get those gifts you promised me.”
“Then I guess I’ll be the only one eating pie tonight,” Steve replied without missing a beat. He was just teasing, but his tone was serious enough.
His cock dragged in and out of those smooth, wet walls with force, pressed against Tony’s prostate on each thrust. Steve savored the heat, how tight he was, despite how well they’d stretched him. He was
His body was bouncing back quicker than the doctors anticipated, so at least he had that going for him. Another day or two and he’d probably be able to walk, be able to start properly taking care of his baby. At least evolution had granted him that one boon. Carriers were made for child-bearing, after all. Although it wasn’t without difficulty, he had survived it, and with time, he’d recover.
There was no sense in staying apart, making everyone miserable and trying and failing to get a handle of things when everyone was on different continents, when everyone was split apart. They were a
“You look like hell,” were the first words out of Bucky’s mouth, and Steve scoffed a little. At least he hadn’t changed too much.
“I know you’re uncomfortable, baby. You’ll feel better soon, I promise,” Tony said.
Hopefully, all of this would be sorted out sooner rather than later. He wanted nothing more than to be back in their king, curled up in the soft sheets, with no plans and no worries, like their last date night. That was three weeks ago though, and something told Tony he wouldn’t be getting another one anytime soon.
Steve sat up, brushed a hand through his hair. “You could never disappoint,” he replied, pulling Tony forward by the arms a little.
, it was extremely hard. Steve used his tongue well, always did, got him sloppy and wet and shuddering. More than once Tony’s hips dropped to the bed when his knees gave out, and he tried to chase the friction of the mattress to relieve his aching cock, but Steve would just pull him back up, hold him there, and Tony had no choice but to take it, to take his teasing licks and pointed thrusts inward.
Steve felt out of place, standing in the luxurious palace again, after so many months. He felt out of place in Wakanda in general; it was a different world, a better world, which didn’t belong to him. It was big and beautiful and filled with wonder. Wakanda was a beacon, an example for the future. The Alpha was a relic of the past, which, he now thought, he should have been lost to.
“I wanted to,” Steve replied with a shrug, and brushed a hand through his hair, seemingly unaware of the profound effect he tended to have on the brunet. He sat down next to Tony, looked him over.
He also liked being a handful: a handful which fit perfectly in the breadth of Steve’s huge and warm grasp.
than it really was. Tony knew that for a fact, because when Steve was out of the uniform, in his civilian clothes, his ass was just. The best sight in the world. You could bounce a quarter off of that thing, and Tony regularly had to stop himself from trying it out. If he walked behind the soldier on their way to conference rooms in SHIELD HQ, or strategically placed himself so that he had a view of Steve’s ass at the thank you banquet the mayor of NYC threw after the battle, simply to drink his fill of that impressive, round,
The blond let out a groan as he came, let the bulk of it flood Tony’s mouth, which the brunet dutifully swallowed, but pulled back at the last second, let the last drops of cum land on his face.
Rhodey was in the kitchen making breakfast the day Tony decided to break the wall he’d built up between them. He padded into the kitchen, stomach already rumbling. He hadn’t forgotten the doctor’s insistence on him eating more, and he did his best to adhere to that rule.
“It’s a deal. I’ll grab you a towel so you can take your shower.” Steve moved to get off the couch, straightened his clothes. They
Steve’s eyes drifted around the beautiful, quiet office room he was standing in. Bucky and the rest of his team were waiting outside the door, he knew, but they felt miles, light-years away.
been?
“You shouldn’t have done it, Tony! You shouldn’t have made a deal with them for me, for us. It’s not fair to you. It goes against everything you’ve worked for! You shouldn’t have done it. We’re not worth it. I’m not worth it,” Steve protested, because he thought it was true. He didn’t deserve to come home, didn’t deserve to be at Tony’s side after everything.
“But you were big already, I’m betting,” Tony said, shifting just a fraction, torn between telling Steve to move or keep still. He didn’t think it’d take long to cum today, after being so thoroughly worked up, and he was itching to touch his cock, to stroke himself, but he was usually pretty sensitive after cumming, and there was something so satisfying about being able to cum from Steve’s cock only, from it rubbing up against his prostate. It gave Tony a sense of pride, made him feel like he belonged to Steve, and Steve always praised him for it, like it was a miracle, instead of a simple body function.
“It’s not fine,” the blond insisted, pulling Tony close by the elbow. The brunet resisted at first, but then melted against him. Steve held him tightly, pressed a kiss to the top of his head. “I’m so, so sorry. I never would’ve said yes if I knew how late I’d be.”
“Please,” Tony sighed, tilting his neck, pushing up into Steve’s grasp. “Please touch me.” He needed the distraction, needed to feel good, to forget about the morning’s unpleasant events.
Tony sighed, a real, heavy sigh, and looked around his lab. He walked to his desk, tried to decide between which products to work on next, or if he wanted to make something brand new. He did have a pile of paperwork in his office that needed taking care of, but that would just ruin his day that much more. It had been all but three minutes, and he already missed Steve.
Tony let out a little whimper at the heat, and Steve’s face was tucked against his shoulder, letting out little grunts as they slid against each other, fucked into the channel of their combined hands. There’d have to be clean-up later, which he wasn’t looking forward to, but he couldn’t bring himself to care when Tony started talking again.
“You’re right,” Steve said finally, dropping more apples in their basket. “I guess it can be kind of hard.”
Then the marked path became erratic, looping and sweeping back and forth, and then it abruptly ended in a forest near the coast of Tunisia. The timestamp indicated the Quinjet landed there a few hours ago, about the time Tony made his first phone call, and hadn’t moved since. According to the jet’s diagnostic report, it was badly damaged, with a cracked fuel line, shot electrical system, and extensive damage to the cabin. At this point, all of its systems were down, excluding the tracker.
He’d missed the sound of the door opening, hadn’t seen it open either, and the moment he’d been waiting for, whether he liked it or not, for so
Steve caught his hand. “
“What the fuck are you laughing at?” Steve demanded, and crossed his arms.
“Shoulda grabbed it,” he lamented when Steve settled in the driver’s seat. “Really liked that one. Bought it in Malibu.”
Tony nodded a little, his eyes roaming over Steve’s face fondly, drinking in every detail, committing the scene to memory. “It’s enough for me too,” he replied. “I’ll take it, take everything I can get.”
Steve laughed a little, pleased with the reaction. He hugged Tony back, closed his eyes and smiled. He’d been worried that he ruined their day, that the gift wouldn’t be enough to make up for it, but evidently it was. “I love you too,” he said. “I’m sorry for being late,” he said again.
“There are children present,” Tony remarked, grinning as he felt Steve shift behind him to get off the bed. He only felt a little bad at leaving the work for Steve. The blond had avoided the ordeal of shopping, after all. Neither of them were particularly fond of the chore. Besides, Steve had the pleasure of having Peter to himself most of the morning. Tony deserved a little cuddle time with their baby.
“The United Nations has been monitoring communication lines,” T’challa finished for him, nodding a little.
Tony bit his lip to stifle a groan, tried to shift his hips back to get more, but Steve kept control, tightened his grip until it was just barely painful, and Tony stilled beneath him, let out a harsh breath, a little whine.
Tony didn’t know if he believed that. He shook his head, his throat feeling tight.
Tony took a deep breath, loosened his tie and looked over the table again. Maybe he should just put it away, forget the whole thing. Maybe Steve didn’t want any of this in the first place. Maybe he’d
“You did it! Jesus, Tony, you did it!” Rhodey laughed, breathless and filled with excitement, and Celene congratulated him. There was a lot of chatter going on he couldn’t quite understand at the moment, but shit. He’d actually done it.
Every touch, every little encouragement from her had him rising up that peak, the pleasure ebbing and flowing, until he needed more, couldn’t stand this pace anymore.
Reality rushed in on him all at once. He’d done it. He’d had a baby. After sixteen hours of labor, he’d brought Peter into the world, had overcome one of the greatest hurdles in his life, and damn did that feel good. It was a relief, after all this time, to know he’d gotten through it. No matter how difficult it was, he’d done it.
First off I adore the song Daddy Issues by The Neighborhood. It inspired the title.
“What are you laughing at?” Steve muttered, squeezing his hands where they were joined.
He’d often dreamt about getting his dance with Peggy in the past, finding his way back to her, but that was a long time ago, and he’d made his peace with it. He was glad to hear about the life she’d made for herself, and he had started to build a life for himself now too. It wasn’t perfect, and it was crazy and weird, and he could never have anticipated any of it, but he liked it.
It was usually in public, unfortunately, that Tony’s brattiness made an appearance, and although Steve would never comment on it out loud, he was almost certain it was a cry for attention, something he’d picked up during childhood. After all, screaming children were hard to ignore, and Tony was so often ignored.
“Let’s fool around?” he asked.
“You asked for it,” Steve replied, and Tony could feel the way he shrugged his shoulders with it. “I wanted to take it slow, but you said you could handle it.”
“I want Steve!” he sobbed, and hated himself for even wishing it, but god did he want him here. It’d be so much easier, he was sure, with Steve at his side, like he was supposed to be. It would all be over by now, if Steve was here, holding him, encouraging him. He could almost imagine it, could imagine the blond’s voice, praising him, supporting him, if he tried hard enough, but it wasn’t good enough, wasn’t the real thing.
Steve swallowed hard. There was a lump forming in his throat, and his eyes stung. He knew exactly what Sam was saying. If Tony was stressed, worried about him, and they weren’t in contact, his sickness, both of theirs, could take a turn for the worst. This really couldn’t have been worse timing.
He lifted a hand, brushed Tony’s bangs back from his face. “You’re smart, quick-witted, and can talk just about anybody under the table. It’s impressive, intimidating, and a little sexy, but you didn’t hear it from me,” Steve said, and he couldn’t hide his happy little smile if he tried.
Every declaration of love from Tony left Steve’s heart fluttering, something warm and sweet settling in his chest. It did so now too. He found himself smiling a little at the brunet’s words, leaned down between thrusts to press a kiss to the brunet’s lips.
The three of them had a great time splashing around in the water, even allowing Peter to swim himself a little back and forth about a foot between them. He was pretty good at it. Tony had been a natural too when he was little. He supposed it was in the blood.
“Don’t mind if I do,” Tony said smugly, and snuggled a little further into the bed.
Steve understood thankfully, and never considered forcing Tony to breach the topic. It made him a little nervous too, not for himself, but for Tony. If his parents decided to cut him off, to punish him somehow for the way they felt about each other, Steve had very little to offer him. He worried about it, sometimes. He would do his best to take care of Tony, naturally, but was concerned that he wouldn’t be able to make him happy, that he would have to settle, to live without the beautiful, expensive things he was so used to. Steve thought Tony deserved the world, and never wanted him to go without.
The brunet finally managed to regain control of his limbs and slowly turned over, rested his head on Steve’s shoulder, ignorant of the mess between them, and swung a leg over Steve’s. “I’m so fucking good,” he said, the words slow and drawn out.
“I could ask you the same thing,” Steve replied, crossing the room. He grabbed the bottle of lube, climbed on the bed, and leaned low over Tony, grazed his teeth against the brunet’s collarbone.
Their vacation was well deserved. It’d been a tough financial quarter for SI, and a string of missions that required them to step in alongside the rest of the team was cause for plenty of stress and strife. There’d been a stint in the hospital 2 months ago too, which neither wanted to repeat. It was nice to get away for a little bit, to take some time to breathe.
. They had to be presentable at another one of his father’s stupid parties, surrounded by people that Tony couldn’t give two fucks about, and that he never wanted to see again. Jarvis was on vacation, and had been for the last two weeks, and Rhodey was away with the Air Force, so Steve was honestly the only person Tony could bear to spend more than five seconds around. Could he be blamed for wanting a slice of gorgeous, All-American pie?
suffered enough. Sam didn’t want to suffer anymore. He didn’t want Steve to suffer anymore either, especially now knowing that the man had a kid on the way, a kid which he most likely wouldn’t get to meet. That was punishment enough for everything, Sam decided.
Sure, he sometimes had get togethers with Peggy and the old Howlies that were still alive, and they were nice, made him happy. He got to see their kids, share stories, learn about them all over again, but he’d missed too much. They’d changed, had grown in his absence, had
“Okay.” Tony's gaze flickered between Steve’s mouth and his eyes. “Okay, Steve,” he said again. “Truth time. It’s about seventy percent you, thirty percent that I’m, ah … restrained.”
“Nothing,” Tony said. “It was nothing at all, Cap, don’t worry your pretty little head over it. You know me, absolutely no brain to mouth filter at all. I remember this one time -”
“I want to suck you off,” Steve muttered into Tony’s mouth. One of his hands found the waistband of Tony’s pants and slipped inside, under his boxer briefs, smoothing over Tony’s flank.
“I can’t stop you,” Tony said. His hips jerked as Steve’s fingers slid over the crack of his ass, teasing.
Tony jerked to a stop on the penthouse platform of the tower as his body tried to keep going but his feet, still in the boots of the Iron Man suit, were suddenly locked into place. His right foot was hovering a few inches off the ground, caught mid-stride, while his arms, hands still in the gauntlets, were awkwardly stretched out, the left above his head, the other straight out to the side. “Jarvis,” he said, “what the hell?”
Steve worked his mouth along the line of Tony’s jaw, back to his lips. His kiss was more forceful this time, and Tony matched him, their tongues clashing, the sharp press of Steve’s teeth against his bottom lip setting off sparks behind his eyelids. Steve's hands slid down Tony’s back to grip his ass, pulling their hips flush. Tony finally tore his mouth away, panting for air.
“I’m afraid so, sir,” Jarvis said, not in the least bit contrite. “Perhaps it would be best if we recruited manual backup?”
Brushing his lips over Tony’s temple, Steve chuckled, a dark, quiet laugh Tony had never heard before. “You can’t,” he said. His lips drifted to Tony’s neck, sending a shiver down his spine as he said, “Must be hard for you. Can’t imagine the great Tony Stark doesn’t get his way very often.”
“Sorry to disturb your post-assemble routine, Cap,” Tony said. “I mean, normally I would call Pepper for these sorts of things, or Rhodey, but Pep’s in Malibu this week and Rhodey, well I don’t know where Rhodey is these days, probably off on some top secret mission with that suit I gave him out of the genuine goodness of my heart and anyway Pepper would probably kill me if she had to rescue me again from something mechanical after the last time, I mean it’s not the same as the arc reactor thing, but I think she has trauma or something she was really mad -”
“Yes, sir?”
and Steve was
And then he couldn’t think at all. Steve’s lips were soft but insistent, a little chapped on one side where he had caught a fist to the face earlier. Tony was intensely aware of all the places they were touching - his inner thigh, Steve’s hand hot against the side of his neck. Steve’s mouth tasted like the faint iron tang of blood overlaid with orange juice. Tony chased the taste, tipping his chin up and pressing his tongue into Steve’s mouth. Steve inhaled, a sharp breath through his nose, and then he crowded up against Tony, chest to chest, deepening the kiss. His hand was still soft on Tony’s neck, his thumb brushing against his jaw, but his other hand gripped Tony’s hip hard enough to bruise. Tony distantly registered the clatter of the screwdriver on the floor and jerked his hands in the gauntlets, forgetting he was trapped in his desire to touch Steve, feel his skin.
“The mechanism seems to have malfunctioned, sir,” Jarvis said, as calm as ever. “I’m running a diagnostic now.”
“Okay,” Tony said. “There’s a toolbox over there.” He jerked his chin in the vague direction of the couch. “You’re going to need that.”
“Steve, that’s two hundred percent,” Tony said. Making a joke, yes, great. Even he, emotionally stunted Tony Stark, could see that Steve was nervous about admitting that he was attracted to men. Or maybe it was admitting that he had a thing for bondage.
A fine tremor started in his muscles, balancing on one leg, pulling in his wrists and shoulders. He flexed his bicep to take some of the pressure off his shoulder and swayed back, off balance. Steve's hands immediately slid up his thighs and gripped his hips, keeping him steady, his fingers hard points of pressure that only wound Tony up further. He leaned into Steve's hold, wishing that his hands were free so he could bury his fingers in Steve's hair, wishing his wrists were bound with rope so he could feel the fine burn of it against his skin. He dimly realized he was begging, babbling, a filthy litany of prayers spilling out of his mouth unbidden.
“Ms. Potts, as you know, is in Malibu this week,” Jarvis said. “Agents Romanoff and Barton are still at SHIELD. Dr. Banner is away,” he continued, “and Captain Rogers is in his suite.”
Steve shouldered open the door and grinned, dumping Tony unceremoniously on the bed. “Oh, I think you did,” he said. “I’d love to see what it takes to make Tony Stark at a loss for words.” He crawled up the bed toward Tony, bracketing him with his arms and straddling his hips. “Wanna find out?”
Oh shit, Tony was so screwed. He wanted nothing more than to see how far down that blush really went, to lick Steve’s neck where it met his collarbone, to set his teeth on Steve’s earlobe and feel him shiver. His cock hadn’t flagged at all, despite his embarrassment, and at Steve’s words it twitched. “Well,” he said, “this is not a conversation I expected to have with Captain America. But have you looked in a mirror lately?” He was still trying to distract Steve, to salvage the situation with some of his dignity intact.
The tips of Steve’s ears were pink and his cheeks were flushed. He pulled back just enough to open his eyes and look at Tony’s face, tongue curling around the head of his cock. The moment their eyes met, Tony came, surprised and silenced, finally, by the tidal wave of his orgasm crashing over him. His whole body sagged as his knees wobbled, held up for a brief second only by the remnants of his suit. His left shoulder twinged.
that happened, and you just want to go back to your room and take a shower and pretend that
Steve pulled back a bare inch so he could see Tony’s face. There was a flush of color high on his cheekbones and his eyes were an even more intense blue than usual, his pupils blown wide. He looked fucking edible and Tony’s mouth watered. He didn’t say anything, and Tony realized he was waiting for something.
“Good,” Steve said, and kissed him until he forgot how to say his own name, let alone anything else.
Tony wrapped his legs around Steve’s hips and his arms around Steve’s neck as Steve started walking, carrying him unerringly toward the bedroom. “Good,” he said. “Because I actually don’t think I could stop talking, even if my life depended on it. In fact, my life
Steve grinned, a full on
Tony blinked the sunspots away. “Steve, god, if you don’t get me out of these things and fuck me right now I think I actually might cry.”
“Great,” Tony muttered. He wriggled his fingers, but there was no give. He sighed. “Jarvis.”
“Great,” Tony said. Of course it had to be Steve. “Call Steve, would you? I think I can talk him through getting me out of this thing.”
“Wait, what?” Tony said. He leaned back a little to look at Steve’s face. “No challenge! I never issued a challenge.”
, his bottom lip caught between his teeth as he poked the boot with the screwdriver. God, this was a dirty fantasy come to life, and just like that his heart rate kicked up a notch and he was half hard already.
“All thumbs present and accounted for.” Steve held up his hands and wiggled his fingers. “What do you need me to do?”
Tony looked down and immediately had to shut his eyes against the sight of Steve’s mouth stretching over the head of his cock. It was almost worse, though, not to see, to only be able to feel the slide of Steve’s tongue against the sensitive underside of the head, the barest sharp brush of his canines as he took Tony in further until his mouth met his fingers.
“Yes, Tony, I know what a socket wrench is,” Steve said, heavy with sarcasm, raising an eyebrow.
“Yeah. No one’s ever accused me of being good at math.” Steve’s smile turned up a little at the corners. He was still holding the screwdriver, and he tapped it thoughtfully against Tony’s chest. “May I kiss you?” he asked.
“As you wish, sir.”
He then proceeded to give Tony one of the slowest, most thorough blow jobs he’d ever had in his entire life. Steve's eyes had slid shut at some point, the lashes a dark smudge against his cheeks. Tony had lost track of time by the end, lost himself in the hot hollow of Steve’s mouth, the slick slide of his tongue, the tight press of his mouth around the base of Tony’s cock as he swallowed him down.
Steve knelt down and opened the toolbox, unfolding the drawers until he found the tools he was looking for. He twisted around and squinted at the boot currently holding Tony’s right leg off the floor.
Steve still wasn’t looking at him, and his fingers had stilled on his shirt. Tony still couldn’t decipher his expression.
“What would you have done if I hadn’t been here?” Steve asked, sounding genuinely curious, as he walked over to the couch and hefted the toolbox in one hand. He was wearing sweatpants and a white t-shirt, but his hair wasn’t damp, which meant Jarvis had interrupted him before he’d had a chance to get in the shower.
Steve was still looking at him. A tiny wrinkle had appeared between his eyebrows and Tony could see the tips of his ears and his cheeks were flushed pink. “What did you mean?” he asked.
“Shit,” Tony said, and immediately regretted it as Steve’s head came up automatically.
“I didn’t mean this,” Tony said, gesturing between the two of them. He took a deep breath and plunged in, feet first without looking, like always. “I’d very much like that to happen again. Preferably in a bedroom with less suit and more skin.”
“Right,” Steve said, and dropped the toolbox at Tony’s feet with a loud clang, effectively cutting him off. “Now what?”
“Half an hour?” Tony shook his head. “Are you serious?”
Tony reached up, pulling Steve down until he was pressing Tony into the mattress, hot and heavy and perfect. He waited until Steve was looking at him, then slowly, deliberately, nodded once.
Tony grimaced. “Jarvis is running a diagnostic,” he said. “In the meantime, we thought it was best to get someone up here who had opposable thumbs. Guess you fit that description, huh, Cap?”
“Was I not clear when I told you I would cry if you didn’t fuck me?” Tony asked after he had gotten his brain back online. “Don’t think I won’t. I might even beg if you ask nicely. Although that would be difficult if you want me to stop talking. I suppose I could. Stop talking. Anything is possible, right? I’m sure I could figure it out. I am a genius after all.”
Steve laughed, that low chuckle that did interesting things to Tony’s insides. “I like it,” he said. He dropped his hands to the backs of Tony’s thighs, bending his knees and lifting him off the ground.
Steve laughed and opened his mouth to say something, but Jarvis interrupted with a polite cough.
Tony’s breath caught. Steve Rogers, paragon of American virtue and in possession of a criminally hot body, was kneeling in front of him. If he looked up, Tony’s crotch would be right in Steve’s face. Now was not exactly the time to remember his inappropriate crush on Captain America, Tony reminded his libido. He could feel sweat prickling his lower back before his undershirt wicked the moisture away as he breathed out slowly. He could do this. It was just - he couldn’t
Steve’s eyes flicked to Tony’s face and then away again. His expression was strange, shuttered. It felt a bit like the sun had gone out.
“How long is this going to take?” It hadn’t been a difficult mission, but he was tired. He had been looking forward to a stiff drink and the jacuzzi in his suite, maybe some tinkering in his lab …
Steve cleared his throat. “Tony.” His voice was quiet, and Tony knew it was just his imagination, but he could swear he could feel the hot caress of air.
“I want to touch you,” Tony said, a little petulantly. He flexed his fingers.
He opened his eyes and looked down.
Steve stood suddenly, right up in Tony’s space. The inside of his knee pressed into Steve’s thigh, and Tony could feel the heat radiating off Steve’s body, smell the mineral scent of his sweat. “I’m not Captain America right now,” Steve said. His lips twisted sardonically. “I’m just Steve Rogers.” He was still blushing, his eyes an intense blue.
