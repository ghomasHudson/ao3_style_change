Steve moved closer to Tony's back, hand hovering for just a second, before gently resting on Tony's back. He moved his head closer to Tony's ear as his hand moved in circles. "Tony, can you hear me?" The smaller man was still coughing, almost violently, his body desperate to get air back. "Tony, it's Steve, I'm right here. You're in New York," Steve started up the mantra to try and ground Tony. "You're in the mansion, it's just after Peter's party. Peter is in his bedroom with Wade, they're both safe. You're safe." Tony was wheezing now, but he was pulling in some air now, the coughing not nearly as bad. "You're safe, Tony."
The past two chapters were a trip, weren't they? Well, here we've got some comfort going on, and, one of the most sappiest scenes in this story. Diabetes inducing, tooth rotting, sweetness. I am not paying for the medical bills that you'll all incur because it was so sweet.
Mary got down on her knees and they both looked up at ceiling. "Alright, what's that one right there?" Mary asked as she pointed up to a spot. Steve crouched down a little to get a better idea of what was happening.
I did see Civil War, it as amazing. The movie will influence me to a point, but only in the fact that it reinforced ideas I already had, so still, no spoilers happening in this story! (Be sure to check out the end notes as well.)
"Aww, that is super sweet!" She was right, spirited was not the words that Steve should have used. Enthusiastic, theatrical, exuberant, vivacious even. "I'm touched, really, to be approved by a personal friend of the good Captain. Alright, I can sense that she wants to talk to you about serious matters of the heart, so I'll let you go. Corporal Wingman will continue her mission."
Breakfast had been thoroughly demolished once everyone had come to eat. Steve could see why Bruce had decided to make more than just pancakes. He also resolved to wake up a little earlier tomorrow to make breakfast so Bruce didn't have to keep cooking. Maybe he could make dinner tonight, and ask Peter to help. He wanted to keep things as normal as possible for the boy, like Tony was trying to do.
"Rachel and William are cooking," Steve told him, taking one step to the side when Tony tried to sidle past him. "Tony. Why did you have to go see Loki this morning?" And now Steve was giving him the eyes, the eyes that said he really hoped that he didn't have another mind-controlled teammate.
"And land it where?" Tony could hear the crunch of snow as Steve was walking outside. "They've closed the airports because they can't keep the runways clear fast enough. I'm in the middle of the city, so there's no place to land safely."
As the nurse finished with the last piece, Steve came in the room with Meg behind him. He had insisted that she get checked over too, and Tony waved him off to keep an eye on her. Steve closed the door as the nurse left, and Tony leaned back closing his eyes a little, feeling the pain killers start to kick in. Tony could feel the waves of 'Captain America' radiating from the blonde.
"And I'm in Michigan in the winter, I think I'm winning right now because I can't leave my driveway. Plus, it's not like Stark doesn't have heat in that place." Steve bobbed his head a bit, enjoying the warmer temperature that he kept his rooms at. "Stay dress casual, throw on black vest with matching slacks, but don't put on the jacket. And roll the sleeves up a bit, show off your arms, they're gorgeous."
“Peter and Wade are studying with Jarvis and Bruce today, and Rachel and William are watching Jamie,” Steve shot down all of Tony’s excuses. “I’ve told them that if anything were to happen to call me first. Jarvis will get a hold of me, and you know he can, since you made my phone.” Steve kissed Tony’s knuckles. “The first few meetings are the most nerve wrecking ones, I know this.”
The article went on, but what caught Steve was the picture they had caught of Stark. It was dated today, just an hour ago, when the article was posted. He had been caught coming out tailor's shop, a suit bag over his arm, his driver ahead of him to get the door for his boss. What drew his eye was the haircut that looked familiar now, that was obviously new, and the sunglasses that Stark wore. He had seen those sunglasses, many times.
"At three in the morning?" Steve asked, walking over. He easily lifted the punching bag up with one arm, walked back over to take down the old one that was covered in duct tape, and hooked up the new one. Tony walked over, leaning down to examine the old one. It was literally being held together by many pieces of duct tape, and even that was starting to fray. Steve had been here for less than three days, how had he worn through even the duct tape this much?
Tony lifted his head a bit when he saw William walking over, leaning over the couch a bit. "I think there's something on my stomach, but I can't tell. Does it look serious?"
Bucky snapped his arm out, flesh hand catching Wade’s arm and pulled him back a little. He narrowed his eyes at the kid a little. “You’re one of those kids that’ll do it anyway, aren’t you? Cause it’s something you think is right.” Wade nodded and Bucky let out a sound that was half groan, half sigh. “I thought I lost that damn kid back in Brooklyn,” he muttered under his breath. “Alright, fine. But I’m only teaching you self-defense, and nothing that’ll get me in trouble from your mom, Peter’s mom, or Steve and Tony. I ain’t putting my neck on the line for this, I got bigger things that’ll get me in trouble.” He pulled Wade a little closer, metal finger pointing in his face. “They tell me to stop, I’m stopping, you got me? And I’m telling them that you wanted it.”
Tony started to shake his head, pushing himself up. “Nope, not going to happen.” Mary grabbed the side of his shirt to stop him. “I can’t sleep, not here, Mary. I’ll end up making your injuries worse, and I’m sure you don’t want to be stuck in this bed.”
"But, Luke doesn't get his green one until Ep VI," Tony pointed out to his son. "I don't think Steve is at that level of Luke, yet."
"He's doing surprisingly well," she told him. "Tony told me that after, the Incident in the summer, he talked with Peter several times. He has implicit trust in Iron Man and the rest of the Avengers, and if it keeps nightmares away from my baby, then I'm okay with that for now." Steve nodded a couple times. "Alright, what did Tony do?"
"So, it's completely getting late, and I will let you two have fun," Tony said, grabbing his hat and getting up. "We'll be back in the morning." He gave them a wave and left the room, closing the door once again, and making his way to the elevators. Tony waited impatiently for the numbers to light up, tapping his foot a little. He just wanted to get back to Peter.
“You were given an option.” Tony tried to squirm, needing to pull away, to get away from the familiar voice. He could feel The Other behind him, then felt the grip of its hand closing around the side of his neck. “Now, we will take what we want.” His arms were pushed down on whatever he was lying on, palms facing up. He frowned when he felt something sharp just pressing against his skin, at the base of his palms. “You should be so lucky,” the voice hissed down by his ear. “He’s going to enhance you, again.”
"Buck, he lost a set in Italy," Steve said quietly. He turned over one of the tags and saw a red scratch on it. "He tested it on my shield, after the first paint job, and there was forever a red mark on the back of it." Steve bit his bottom lip, biting back tears. "How did you find these?"
"Aren't you supposed to be sleeping," Tony said, taking the gauntlet off, placing it down on the table. One of the robots would grab it, putting it back with the rest of the suit.
"He's a celebrity, and someone I never thought I would meet in my life," she told him. "Much less be friends with his boyfriend."
“Seems that we weren’t the only ones to get unexpected visits through portals,” Natasha had said when Steve came back up to the floor where everyone still was. “Coulson got a call from his team. Apparently Thor was having his own problems over in London, and there were reports of random portals there, as well.”
"Yeah, go ahead," Tony said, nodding. His eyes were closed and he was rubbed between his eyes. He needed to get to the workshop first. He forced his eyes open, keeping close to the wall and headed down the hall. The workshop was close tot he garage, so he had been heading in the right direction.
“Ouch,” Tony feigned a wince, putting a hand over his chest. “Right there, Steven, right there.” Steve hummed a little with a smirk. “You had better like the glasses, because do you know how long I spent picking these out?” Steve silently stared at him, silently chewing his food. “Okay, too long, specially for just a pair of black plastic frames, but-“
"Is that so?" Tony laughed as he tried to keep the wiggling boy in his lap. "Is it time to wake up now?"
"Large foam things that are used in pools. They're supposed to help float in the water, but human ingenuity turned them into so many other things," Tony chuckled. "I'm sure you'll see them in all their glory in the pool."
"No, no, of course not," Tony shook his head, holding the door open for her as Steve helped her put her winter jacket on. "You're a voluntary test subject."
"Are you meeting someone for lunch?" Steve asked suddenly. This was something that he usually would never do, something that Tony would do honestly, but he was tired of eating all his meals by himself. After nearly two weeks traveling, he had found all the good spots to eat, and for once he'd like some company. He never had to worry about eating alone, or even in silence, back in at Tony's Manor.
"It's not going to replace any of your pencils, just pens, but also markers." Tony moved to stand next to him, pointing at the pen as he went. "The tip is retractable, but it also has several different settings. Ball-point, fine-tip, broad, flat, round, even a calligraphy setting. There are over five-hundred different colors programmed into it, so you can get everything just right. Really, it pretty much works off of an advanced color wheel. But, for those rare moments when you just can find the right color, you can make your own."
“It was no dream, that was all his idea,” Tony assured him, kissing him again. “The kid really knows how to surprise us, huh?”
Steve looked at Pepper when Tony rattled off words to her. "Non-executive employees fall under an eight step pay grade," Pepper told him quietly, inputting information into her tablet. "Eight is the lowest, and working all the way up to one." Steve blinked. Tony was going to set someone up starting at three steps up?
"Only when you're being serious," Rhodey said, and Tony nodded. "Let's get this contract out of the way." Tony smiled at the change of subject, and moved back towards his desk. One step closer to Peter.
"We're still more than a decade from that eventuality," Jarvis said as Tony took his tablet and moved some furniture around on the generated layout. "I believe that it is natural for children to change their rooms several times during their adolescents with their parents."
"It's not a problem, I had already grabbed my bags, and thought I would finish cleaning out the car," Steve said, putting Wade's bag on a chair, and Peter's on the bed. After picking Wade up from the hospital, his Mom had given them a key to their apartment and they picked up some extra clothes and stuff for him as well.
“I don’t need to hear anything that could possibly allude to what goes on in their bedroom,” Meg whined. “I’d rather keep my appetite, thank you very much.”
"Paperwork," Tony muttered. "I get enough paperwork with Pepper and SI, I don't need his paperwork as well."
"You wouldn't have let get as close to Peter as you have if you didn't think that he was going to stick around." Mary kept his eye contact, both knowing that she was right. "Tony, it's alright if you've got feelings that are less than stellar about the marriage things. Specially now that we're all living under the same roof."
"A boy and a girl," she responded, leaning back against the counter. The alpha marks her territory, letting him know that he's in unfamiliar lands.
Tony went to all four corners, checking that the transmitters were working and hooked up to the system. There was the chip sitting in the leather cuff on the cot, and Tony thought that he would be able to slip it underneath the shackles on Loki's wrist, where the man wouldn't be able to get to it if Thor tightened them enough.
"I'll let you know when its time to be concerned," Tony told her. "But, I think the most important question is; Where is Peter?"
“They wouldn’t open for me for years,” Howard said. Evelyn almost growled at him, her little body giving a full body shake once, like a bad shiver.
"Well, there wouldn't be, if he had filled up the phone with other music as well," Tony said, and looked over at his friend. "He has Nineties Boy Bands on here!"
“I’m okay, I got a suit here.” He reached out an arm and Wade pushed Peter and Jamie towards him first. Jamie wasn’t crying, at least not out loud anymore, and she had her face pushed against Peter’s shirt, sniffling. Tony dropped a kiss on both their heads before handing them over to Clint first. He reached back for Wade, giving him a little squeeze, before Natasha took him. “Give us just a couple minutes.”
Tony’s eyes fluttered a little. He was exhausted, but most of the pain had stopped, just pulses of leftover pain lingered. Whoever, or whatever, had him had worked to try and block the pain that he was becoming familiar with. He was sure that it was trying to block The Other from finding him.
"You'll find me." Tony nodded, kissing him one more time before pulling away to head down to his workshop. Steve ran a hand through his hair, taking a minute to just breathe.
The car pulled into the garage, and Peter was bolting out the door almost before the engine was shut off. “Peter!” The younger boy nearly slammed into Wade and the two were instantly talking and hugging.
Tony grinned then made himself comfortable, sitting next to Mary on the bed. Bruce took a couple more readings from the equipment around her, made sure she was comfortable, then left them, shutting the door. Tony reached over, taking Mary's hand and lacing his fingers with her. "I won’t tell Agent about this if you won't," Tony said with a little smile. Mary lifted their hands and planted a soft kiss on his knuckles.
"Yeah, good luck with that," Tony said, circling around the counter, trying for casual, and not running away. He had turned his back to her, confident that she actually wouldn't kill him. "I'm not a team player, I don't work well with others, well, there's a whole file about it." Tony turned around and bit the inside of his lip when he saw how close she was then. Her eyes rimmed in red and she brought her hands up towards his head, wisps of red energy trailing after her fingers.
"Put your hand out," Tony told the little boy. "Palm up." Peter followed his word, putting the hand that passed through the ornament out and open. Tony moved the ornament over and let it settle in Peter's hand, looking like he was holding it now. Whenever Peter moved his hand, the ornament moved with it. Jarvis had already scanned him into the system, to recognize him for any hologram action, tracking his movements.
"Because someone else told me, and don't I feel like the fool now." Tony blew out some breath. "You swear you didn't assign her to me?"
“This is payback for trying to use guilt to make you dress up, isn’t it?” Steve didn’t say anything to Tony, but just kept smiling. “I’ve sent most of these pictures to Mary and Pepper. There will be framed ones around the Penthouse when we get back.”
“I just want to try so hard for her,” he whispered. “I never thought I’d get anywhere close to what I have now, a family like this. I was too small, always sick. No one thought I’d live as long as I did before I met Dr Erskine.” He gave Tony a sad little smile. “I’m sure I wouldn’t have survived to see the end of the War if I hadn’t. Medicine was already so hard to get, and I’m sure it would have only gotten harder later on.” He shook his head. “Point is, the plans I had for getting older, they didn’t include having a family. Not that I didn’t want one, nah, I always wanted to give Ma some grandkids to dote on. But, that wasn’t going to happen. I was gonna work on my art, get a job maybe at a newspaper, and probably be Bucky’s neighbor until he couldn’t stand me anymore. I didn’t expect to live long enough to see having a family, if anyone even wanted to be with me.”
Tony raised both his eyebrows. "Okay, yes, I'm totally down for this game." Tony grinned then motioned with his free hand for Steve to turn in a circle. "Come on, Mr America, turn for me. I need to get a good look before I make my final judgement. And don't spin too fast, I need a good look."
"Didn't help that most of the tourist sights had been hit by bombs or gun-fire," Steve added. "I was pretty noticeable in my uniform back then anyway."
“So, almost two decades of taking fighting classes,” Bucky commented and Meg wrinkled her nose a little.
Tony felt utterly exhausted, in every single way. He wished that he could just ignore everything, bury himself in his workshop until he passed out from exhaustion and got some sleep, let others deal with everything on their plate. But he couldn't, he knew he couldn't. This was rapidly becoming an Avengers problem, and they needed to put a stop to all of this before it got even more out of hand. It wouldn't be long until the government was knocking on their door, and Tony knew that a lot of the blame would be coming his way. He was the government’s favorite scapegoat.
“Why do you get the big bed??” Steve chuckled as Peter cried out, the two obviously getting into a pillow fight.
Seriously you guys, the feedback I'm getting, the comments, it's all so beautiful. I have one-two chapters coming up that will be pure fluff/sappy trash. Just for you guys. I'll let you know when that comes.
“When they all hatch, you’re going to be in charge of them.” Vee chirped a little and Tony smiled. “I’m going to spend more time at home, but when I have to go back into work, you’re going to be the head honcho around here. My sweet girl.” He pressed his nose into her fur, smiling. It was something new he was doing, and Vee loved it.
"They're good, thanks for asking Mr Stark." He always called Tony that when he was working. "Spending the night with their grandparents, tonight."
"Did Mary tell you that she's moving," Mrs Fitzpatrick said suddenly. Mary almost facepalmed, but Tony was used to this.
"Watch out, Cap, someone might think that you were worried about me." Tony smiled a little, patting Steve's arm. Tony felt Steve smile through his hair. "Um, hey, follow me?" Tony asked as he got up off the bed. Steve tilted his head, Tony thinking not unlike a golden retriever, or maybe a labrador. "Just, come on." Tony headed for the elevator, Jarvis bringing it back down for him. Inside Tony hit a button before Steve got on.
"They're kind of like stress bracelets," Steve told him. He held up his other hand, and Tony could see that he was wearing a blue one and a yellow one. "When you're starting to feel stress, from memories, or a flashback, or just too many thoughts, you just snap these against your wrist." He flipped the bracelets, which looked to be made of some kind of rubber, to show that on a few spots there was a patch of hard plastic. "The sharp snap is supposed to bring you back to the present."
Tony squeaked his protest a little when Peter just kept on talking to Steve, casually mentioning Tony's sexuality. He couldn't blame the boy, it wasn't something that he would actually understand at the age of five, but Steve would.
"Are we sure that that's what we're going with?" Steve stopped and looked at the back of Tony's head. "Wilson wanted his ex-wife murdered?"
"No," Tony warbled out. Things were drifting in his vision, like he was on a boat in the middle of the storm. "I feel too light."
Tony curled around Vee on the couch as soon as he got home from the press conference. He threaded his fingers through her fur, careful of her sprained leg that Stane had injured when he kicked her. For that alone he felt little remorse for killing the man. She purred lightly, reveling in the attention of Tony, happy that he was there and safe now.
"I wish I could have spent more time with you," Tony said, looking down a little. "Wish I would have thought more about it when I announced I was Iron Man, but who knows if it would have made a difference. Every time I did something though, I drew attention to myself, and I ended up hurting you. I couldn't come and see you, had to wait for everything to die down, and I hated that. "You lived with your Mama, and she did all the hard work. Go easy on her as you grow up, she's an amazing person, one of the best friends that I've ever known, and the best mother I've ever seen. "Wish I could have taught your more, held you more, told you I loved you more. I'm still a selfish man, and sometimes I still think of myself. I'm really not a good role model, but I tried to change enough."
Tony shrugged a little, still not looking away from Loki. He wanted his eyes alone to make the alien burn. "Still, you are pretty spry, for an older fellow." He cast a side glance towards the hero. "What your thing? Pilates?" Confusion. "It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle." Tony couldn't help it, and now he could practically feel the disapproval just rolling off of the man.
"You think that she's going to mature faster than other babies?" Tony asked as he leaned forward and placed on finger under Jamie's chin. She watched him again. "Because of the serum?"
"There's no question that I will be able to compensate you with a near limitless source of wealth, correct?" She had to nod at that. "Alright, so I'll commission you, you get some sketches together, and I'll show you what I'm thinking for payment." And then his eyes were back to the phone, thoughts moving a mile a second. "Have to get Pepper to draw up the contract, she's much better at the wording than I am. Or at least tell her what I want and she'll draft it with legal, then I'll probably have to give her a raise after this, too."
"She needed help," Steve was starting to explain, pulling Tony back from his thoughts a little. "And your Daddy found her, and saved her from some bad people."
Steve watched him for a second. He was starting to piece together the enigma that was Tony Stark, starting to put together the same person that was Peter's father, and the billionaire.
"Sorry, I just, Peter," Tony breathed before letting go of Steve and running for the exit. He was aware that Steve was following behind him, and a little bit of warmth lit up in his chest. Tony opened the door and saw that Wade was sitting up in the bed, arms wrapped around Peter, who was lightly crying into the older boys shirt. Big brown eyes looked up at Tony as he and Steve slid into Peter's room and Tony was already moving to sit on the edge of the bed.
"Stop calling me that." They both stopped moving when a cart went past the room, but it didn't stop. "You've forced them further underground, now I can't find them." He pressed against Steve with his body. "You almost got her killed." Steve's hand flew up to grip the metal wrist, trying to pull it back, even just enough to pull in a single breath. "What were you thinking dumping that information?"
"Officially? There is no more SHIELD," Steve told him gravely. "It had been infected by Hydra, by Zola. Alexander Pierce, he was leading the charade." Tony grabbed his mug so he didn't give away his thoughts. He wasn't sure how to tell Steve about Howard being part of Hydra, not while he was still trying to process it. "We put all of SHIELD and Hydra on the internet." Tony's eyes widened. "Jarvis and Bruce grabbed a lot of stuff about you and your work, and other dangerous information. But, it's all out there."
“It was a slip up,” Steve retaliated, then turned around to face Tony. “I’ll never call her that name again.”
Steve hummed a little, a little smirk. "He probably will. Good thing you've already got Phil in his own room."
Once inside, Tony looked around the room, not turning his sunglasses off. He thought that maybe this woman was another secretary, or PA to this Cavanaugh. It wasn’t until the brunette sat down in the chair in front of the official looking desk. There were a couple of chairs and a couch in the room, and Tony took the single seat that was nearly the furthest away from the desk. The woman pulled out some papers and Tony nodded to himself a little.
"No, no, threatening." Tony put the glass down, and started to walk towards Loki now, towards Peter. "I don't need a team with me. See, what you don't understand is that you've made me more dangerous than you could have ever thought." Tony stopped, barely a foot away from Loki. "You touched my son."
“Alright, alright,” Howard lamented. “He can keep the pokemon.” Tony smiled down at Vee, pressing a kiss to her head. She shook her head happily, licking his cheek again.
There was a pause, as if the AI was considering on whether or not to tell the Captain. "Sir suffered from palladium poisoning from the previous reactor," Jarvis said finally. "He needed to create a new one, and Dr Banner had been helping him. Had he not finished it aboard the Hellicarrier, I am afraid that Sir would not have survived long enough to stop the missile that threatened the island of Manhattan."
Wade nodded, and Steve brought him for another hug, and this time the little arms that wrapped around him were stronger. They stayed in the hall for a while, until Wade eventually yawned, and was more lounging against Steve as he tried to fight off sleep. The door to the apartment opened a bit wider and Todd stepped out before catching sight of them, Julie right behind him. He gave them a small smile, and shifted Wade into his arms to pick him up as he pushed himself from the floor.
"To be fair, he stills likes the stars," Tony pointed at him. Steve held the door to the main floor open so they could leave first.
“When did you start taking self-defense classes?” Tony asked next. He had an idea, and wanted to see if it checked out.
“Miss Potts approached me last week,” Mary started to explain to Tony. “She had put the pieces together, and well, there really was no point in hiding anything anymore, and we could always use more allies after your Profound four word statement.” Tony was never going to live down coming out as Iron Man. And he had indeed stuck with the name; it was better than Gold Titanium Alloy Man. Although….
“Alright, I won’t tell you that.” Tony groaned and dropped his head back against the headboard of the bed. “You were both out for blood in there.”
Mary let out a loud snort with a laugh before she was able to cover her mouth. Steve shot her a look, and her grin widened underneath her hand. “It’s not polite to have your elbows on the table, Tony,” she managed to get out without laughing too much.
Tony moved the tablet when little arms started to slide down from the bed, and down Tony's chest. He looked up, raising an eyebrow. Peter smiled at him, half off the bed, upside down. "What are you doing? You're like a spider."
"We got this," Steve said, adding a little bit of modern slang into his accent, and Mary raised an amused eyebrow before leave the apartment. He heard her lock the door from the outside, and he turned back to his laptop, watching Peter out of the corner of his eyes do his homework.
Tony froze. Peter was having an allergic reaction, it was looking to be a bad one with the swelling happening. It had happened so quickly. Mary hadn't said he was allergic, but neither had Jarvis. They must not have known. Panic raced through Tony's brain, watching his son have trouble breathing, in his arms. He couldn't take care of a child, he wasn't meant to be a father, he couldn't take care of his own son-
"I'll be back with the little tyke. You're gonna love him," Tony said, the thought of Peter enough to make him start grinning.
"We'll have to check her over," Tony continued, changing the subject, feeling a panic attack buzzing at the edge of his eyes. Steve didn't saying about it, but the concern written in his eyes was plain to see. "They only had me working on their Serum, and I've given all that Bruce. Right before you attacked the base, that was the first time I saw her, so I don't know if they've done anything else. Also, cloning is still a fairly vague scientific field, with not one accepted way of handling it, not that AIM or Hydra would follow those guidelines anyway."
"Save it. Listen up, you're gonna unlock the door, and let them open the door." She squeaked quietly in indignation. "Stick close to the door, and when I tell you, slam the door forward and then get the hell out of there, okay?"
"She'll be doing that pretty quick, won't she?" He moved her carefully onto her back, taking the stuff that Tony gave him to help with the diaper change.
Steve ran his fingers gently along the hood of the car. “You got this for me?” Tony rubbed the back of his head a little, a shy smile on his lips. “I wanna ride in this one.”
"Sounds like you're going to have your hands full," Tony said, taking another sip of coffee. The visiting alpha shows that the previous offer is appreciated. He has no want to take over her claim. Steve shook his head a little. Perhaps he should stop falling asleep with the animal channel on.
"Word is you can find the cube." He wanted nothing more than to find the cube, catch Loki, and if he got a few punches in, or hits with the shield while he was at it, well it might of a little ways to relieving his stress at the moment.
The whir of Dummy's arm brought his attention, the arc reactor there, in his grasp. Dummy sounded so hopeful. Tony was going to upgrade the shit of this stupid little robot after this. "Good boy." He used the momentum of his arm and smashed the glass of the casing, freeing the arc reactor. He'd have to make do with this model until he could get the other one back from Stane, or make another one. But first he had to get Peter.
"And where would you put them?" She said crossing her arms. They all knew that they only art that Tony willingly put up in his homes were those done by Peter or Steve.
Tony drummed his fingers on the table. He didn't like it. Pulling out his phone, he checked his messages, and Jarvis brought up the orders to show that they were moving Meg to a hospital in New York, and would likely be there for another day of observation before being discharged.
“I thought seasoning was our friend?” Tony asked with a little smirk. “Isn’t that what they were saying on one of those cooking shows you watch?”
"Same drill," he said easily. "They've been dealing under the table, and I'm going to stop them." He stood up. "I'm going to find my weapons, and destroy them."
"That would be preferable. If you do that, then I'll actually get close to your again," the blonde said, pulling a pout from Tony. "That's a no go, Tony. That's gross, no matter what way you spin it, and I'm staying here, playing the dutiful Uncle."
Peter shook his head in the negative this time as Mary let go to let Coulson pick him up. "No, brave like Daddy."
Tony had made a quick scan over the music that the DJ was going to play, and was very happy to see that Coulson had indeed not managed to sneak in the Captain America theme song. That had been a very legitimate fear for Tony, Mary, and Steve. They compromised that whoever Steve married in the future would have to have their first dance to the 'Star Spangled Man'. (Steve had no intention of actually remembering that if he got married.) But Mary and Phil's first dance, (Everything by crooner Michael Buble, even Tony could agree to that), went off without a hitch. Agent had some moves that could admire. Just for a second.
Tony picked up the backpack and headed back out and saw Rogers waiting for him outside. "Traitor, AI," he muttered under his breath. "What can I do for you, Cap? J said you wanted to talk to me?"
"And for any hidden ones that might be in Meg's?" Steve asked, tilting his head to look back towards Tony. Tony only nodded.
"But it had been bugging you for a while to not talk about Howard." They had fought about that when Steve first learned that Howard had a surviving family member.
Bruce leaned over to look at the screen as a fourth and fifth song appeared. "They're being added kind of quickly," he commented. "Not even enough time to listen to the full song."
“Tony.” He ignored Steve’s voice as he slipped into Peter’s room to help him getting dressed, the little boy giggling. “Tony.”
Tony hummed a little as he nodded. “That’s right. We don’t know when we’re going to get back, it might be really late. They’ll make sure that you get fed and watered-“
"I promised Mary that I would never drink in front of him," Tony told her. "And I wouldn't be around him if I've had more than two drinks."
"I'm sure I will," Bruce said chuckling. "Go on, don't be late to get your kid." Tony gave Bruce a mock salute and hurried out of the workshop.
Steve went back up the Penthouse floor and saw that Clint and Natasha were already there, looking at the mess that was there. Steve picked up the shield that he had left by the couch when he had gotten there, seeing Tony and Peter on the floor. There was one thing that Tony had said as he walked away from the gym that Steve was taking to heart; There had been an attempt on his life, and Steve needed to figure out who would do that.
Jamie babbled, like she was trying to reply to Tony. Steve pulled on a t-shirt and walked over to her, crouching down. She tapped her hands on the edge of the playpen and smiled at him. “Yeah, and by that he means the biggest banana split with way too much whip cream, chocolate, caramel, and strawberry sauce. And way too many cherries that he keeps trying to get Miss Meg to eat.” He reached over and pulled her up, balancing on her on his hip. “I’ve been able to derail that, so far. But, your Daddy likes to do crazy things, and one day I’m going to walk into his workshop, and there’s going to be half a dozen empty cherry jars around.” Jamie pat his arm with one hand, like she was trying to comfort him.
Steve couldn't help but get up and start washing the dishes as she was gone with Peter, but he kept thinking about the enigma that was Peter's father. He wondered if he'd ever meet the man. The picture from Peter's birthday had been taken on the couch that was in Mary's living room, he could tell, but he wondered if that had just been because of the occasion. A small part of Steve was glad for the distraction, it kept him from thinking too much on how much had changed, and how much was going to continue to change in his life.
"Peter is trapped with Wade because of the snow here, which he was spending the rest of Winter Break over there anyway, and Mary and Coulson are still on their own mission, and her parents are the only smart ones, still in California riding out the snow storm in warm weather."
The jet landed and Tony slowly leaned up, trying not to groan when his back and hips protested. "I'm going to redesign these chairs," he grumbled, stretching a little. "I shouldn't be more sore when I'm getting up, no new places of hurt." A much more rested Bruce approached him and he shook his head a little. "I'm alright." He grabbed the little bag he had made from a piece of fabric from the baby and handed it to his friend. "Present for you, though." Bruce looked with a question in his eyes, but Tony just waved a hand before looping his arm with Steve's, following him off the jet.
"Get her assigned to Pepper if you can't get her reassigned, but tell them I no longer need a PA." Tony walked away from the computer station, over to where Bruce was inspecting the different Iron Man armors on display. He punched in a code and the glass lifted up from all the spots to let him get closer. "speaking of missions, is your Neighbor taking more missions now? Haven't seen him in a while."
"Just saying it how it is," Tony grinned. "What do you think he's going to call you? Papa? Pa? Da? He could always go Italian with it-"
Steve hummed and nodded and opened the door for the stairs instead of heading to the elevator. It would be good exercise, a way to tire him out more when he eventually got to his floor, and it would give Wade the time he needed to get his thoughts off of his chest.
"Oh." Tony slowly lowered the baby in his arms, and Steve took her back. He grabbed the towel from Tony's shoulder, that somehow missed getting ruined, and wiped her face. "There's baby barf on my shirt."
Steve munched on a fry, his phone on the table between him and Meg, her showing him how to discover new artists that were similar to what he was already listening, too. "Usually, the top songs will be first here, so you can get a vague idea if you'll like them or not. That's not always true for every case, because sometimes artists decide to change their sound completely in the same album, without warning." Steve chuckled as she glared at the phone.
"Let me know if there's anything I can do to help," Steve told him, and Tony just nodded, walking down the hall a little, towards one of the windows. The sun was starting to set and Steve sighed internally. He went over to the door next to what Tony had said was his room, and slowly opened the door. He could automatically hear the soft sounds of hospital equipment, a heart monitor, and stepped inside.
He scrambled up, turning and throwing himself forward. Unfortunately, one of the mans' weapons caught his leg, throwing him forward into an overturned car. He grunted, then shouted when his head connected with the underside of the car, and he flopped back onto the ground. Tony must have been imagining it, but he sword he heard two shouts when he landed on the ground. Two different names, but both for him. There was no way that Mary or Peter would have down here, not with this happening.
"My apologies, Sir, but I'm afraid that my systems were compromised by an electromagnetic pulse of some foreign origin."
He knew that Coulson would know already, and that he would be there in no time at all, so Tony escaped to the only other place he would feel comfortable. "Black out protocol, subset B," Tony said quietly as soon as he entered his workshop. The windows frosted up, the lights dimming closest to the door and windows, and music started playing, albeit a lot quieter than usual. Usually he would blast the music, make the whole room shake and putting those earthquake sensors into test mode, but this was different. He still needed to know if his attention was needed, if anything happened, but he didn't want to be brought back to reality without a reason. Jarvis knew what to look for.
"It's why we make our own now," he replied easily. Most of his family now weren't blood related, and he wouldn't have it any other way. Those around him were people that he trusted implicitly. Rhodey and Bruce, Pepper and Happy, some of his oldest friends, and he'd never have to worry about them turning on him. Mary and Peter, even her parents, and Phil, and now Jamie. Steve had been the biggest surprise of all of them, and he would still have days where he would doubt why Steve was with him, but he found that he trusted the man, with his life, and with Peter's.
“No need to worry, bud,” Tony said, taking care not to slur his words. “Pops is out there, so we’ll be safe.” Tony could hear the tell tale clang of the shield outside the car. Jarvis would have alerted the others in the Tower by now, and he thought they could use the backup when he saw the crowd of yellow AIM suits gathering outside the SUV. He was out for the count as Iron Man.
Tony didn't bother going to sleep when he got home, going straight down to his workshop. He immediately found any report about Gulmira, needed to see what was happening. That was Yinsen's home, and it was his name that was destroying it. When he saw the face of the man that had held him captive, still alive, he checked out, turning the Mark III gauntlet into a weapon.
Peter and Wade looked at each other, having a silent conversation, before they both nodded and spoke as one. "Uncle Rhodey." Tony started to cackle and leaned back in his chair, tipping it back a little. Jamie looked pleased as she watched Tony's face.
“Steve!” Tony shouted as he ran. He could hear the cold, dark, laugh in his ears. He was suddenly jerked off of his feet, the hand reaching around in front of him to grip one side of his face, pulling him back against a chest.
“He said that he gave her special permission to join them. Because it was your birthday, and not because he likes her.” Every time Mary and Tony talked about Peter and Jamie, and when they would interact, (which was more often than Peter, or Wade, would admit too), Tony always saw a little smirk hidden on Mary’s face. She was enjoying that Tony had to deal with a jealous Peter, and not her. Mary and Phil had no intention of having any more kids.
"Probably, it's something Pepper picked out. Oh! Petey!" Tony picked up Peter suddenly and jumped up from the couch. "You gotta see what Mr Steve made!" Mary glanced at Steve, a smirk on her face, when Tony willingly used his first name. "Actually, everyone's gotta see this, come on! It's the reason that a multi-million dollar painting is on the floor. I should probably pick that up before Pepper sees it." He used his foot to at least prop it up to lean against the wall. "Look!"
Tony had politely declined all invitations, and Steve hadn’t felt comfortable going in the Captain America uniform, rather preferring his Army uniform if anything. They decided to release a joint statement, saying that they would not be attending any public events, so as not to draw attention away from the others that gave their lives in the battle, to those that were lost, and to those that were still rebuilding. Tony was funding the memorial that the City wanted to erect. He wasn’t under any illusion though that the media would be sure to criticize them for not showing up for any events, even though Tony was adamant about not taking away from the focus on the victims of the city that were affected, and the city itself.
"Daddy," Peter cried out weakly. Tony tore his eyes away and ran over to Peter, falling to his knees in front of the boy. He took Peter's hands away from his chest. There in the middle of his chest was a blue glow. Tony felt numb. "It hurts, Daddy. I'm scared."
But, Steve could see that Stark wasn't the only one being affected by the events of Monaco. Peter was a little more morose as well, and Steve figured that with all the trouble going on, it must be negatively affecting his Dad's work as well. Steve hadn't seen Tony come to the building since the mess started, and if Steve tried to spend a little more time with Peter to help him try and forget about it, then it was worth it if it worked.
Tony grinned and pat Steve’s chest a couple times. “Now go out there and gain your dignity back, because you just saw your daughter take her first steps.” Coulson threw the ball to Bucky and Steve ran over, kissing Jamie’s head, then Peter’s, and ruffling Wade’s hair before going back to the court.
"Looking at your closet," Tony said, leaning his head inside the room. There was a twin bed against the wall, and a crib on the parallel wall. "Only one crib?"
She clapped her hands and cooed, then crawled the foot between them, trying to crawl into his lap. His brows creased as he lifted her up a bit. She batted at his hands, then settled down in his lap. Bucky studied her as she pulled on his pants, trying to get to his socks. Jamie made a little whine then turned her head to look up at him, tugging on his pant leg again.
Natasha had done all the talking, and Clint looked about as ready to murder someone as Tony was feeling. They had no idea that the man was still alive, either. They would go with the excuse of picking up Loki and Thor, not wanting to transport them in a mere vehicle, in case someone got a little too curious, and the people of New York decided to take justice into their own hands. It was true though, a riot was not needed in the still rebuilding streets of New York.
Tony was hugging Peter back tightly, rubbing his back, but hadn’t looked away from Steve. “What’s going on, Steve? I only just got Jarvis back-“
"Mute your- What?? You're just gonna pick up on my line??" The woman shouted, voice getting higher pitched. "I'm being chased, and you're just gonna-"
Swinging his legs around, Tony pushed himself off the cot then yelped, pulling his feet back up as he splashed water. The ground was full of water, several feet deep, and rapidly rising. Tony grabbed the battery quickly and stood up on the cot before the water crested over the top of it. As he stood up straight his head suddenly slammed against the rock ceiling, and he was pushed down to a hunch. The water was getting higher and he had a battery attached to him, and this time there would be no stopping the water from touching it.
"And I've got a backup that I know Tony will get," Meg continued, trying to wipe her laughter. Another song started that they all knew, thanks to Peter. "
“In order to test if something would work, we would try to contaminate the sample,” Bruce explained, taking the focus away from Tony for a second. “The plan was to take a clean sample of Tony’s blood, contaminate it with the formula that the scientists were working on, then start testing to see what could counter act it, if something could counter act it.” Tony was trying to take deep breaths to calm down, thankful that Steve never let go of his hands. “I found, traces, of my original formula already in Tony’s blood.”
A couple notes to go over. Good news, Bad news, really on this first one. This story is coming to an end. It's either going to the be next chapter, or the chapter after that, but then, that's it. *sniff sniff* That's the Bad news. Good news! The sequel will come out within the week of it ending! Like, seriously, I have years planned for our boys. All the way up to Peter's High School years. (And a couple more Marvel movies to put in here. Not. Civil War. My emotions can't handle the trailers, or any interviews, so nope. All aboard the Nopetrain to Nopeville in the heart of Nope City!) The next chapter will have the title of the new fic, so you'll know what to look for.
"They-" Steve stopped. They what? They tried to remake him? They created life? How did any of that sound good? When the truth was that they had tried to make another Super Soldier, and they were going to use an innocent life for experiments. As he looked down at her though, the bright blue eyes, blonde hair, strong jaw line, he couldn't deny that she looked like him. In that moment, Steve knew what he was going to do. "She's mine."
Steve had been thinking about Bruce's words from breakfast, and it was something that Mary had said months ago as well. He needed to talk to Tony, and it would have been better if he had done it before the battle, before the Hellicarrier even, but he hadn't. Now, Steve had to try and talk to him before the aftermath of the battle happened, before debriefs and the press, and hope that it wouldn't be extremely awkward.
The door to the workshop slid open as Steve walked in. He walked over to Tony, clearing his throat a little before putting his hands gently on Tony’s shoulders. “Tony, it’s time to come to bed.” Tony hummed as he started to type again, fixing something that he saw before running the calculations again.
Captain Rogers what happened to his other Pokemon,” Tony said as he braided Morgan’s ribbons. “I, of course, then kidnapped Vee for my own.”
"Bye, Meg." He shook his head a little as they hung up and slipped the phone in his pocket. It had only been two days since the wedding, but Natasha had called Steve with a mission, and he was eager to jump in. He'd been self-confined to the Tower, trying to stay away from the people that were still trying to figure out who Captain America was, but he had been getting antsy. He still hadn't managed to figure out how to stay in one place with nothing to do. Left over habit from the War.
“Oh, so the kids won’t be too much for next year then, got it,” Tony said with a nod, slipping on his sunglasses. “We’ll have to start planning earlier next year.”
“Yeah, but I’ll give you a break tonight,” Bucky told him, clapping a hand on his shoulder. “Get the kids to sleep tonight, get Tony to rest. I’ve got things handled here, and Jarvis has emergency shut-down if a worst-case scenario happens.”
Everyone was pulled back to the sky, the grand finale bursting in the sky. The sound was loud, the pops vibrating through the air. Steve clenched his fist a little, and startled a little when Tony knocked his shoulder with his own.
“These are some heavy topics.” Steve sat down on the top step, and pat the spot next to him. The gangly twelve-year-old plopped down next to him, never taking his eyes off of him. “There are,” Steve paused, not sure how he wanted to word things, “differences. Circumstances as well. The ones, the people, who kill just because they can, or for fun, there’s no measure of goodness in those people. I believe that there are a set of morals, and you must follow what you feel in your heart, but you also have to know the difference between right and wrong, and if the convictions you feel strongly about are enough of a reason to commit a horrible act like that.”
Tony pulled away, gasping for breath, and fell back to the floor, stumbling. His hands were shaking and he shot a glare at the woman, then too Loki when he saw her walking over to him. Tony wrapped his arms around his knees, shaking his head minutely at Steve. Being touched was the last thing he wanted right now. His skin tingled and crawled, and he needed to try and shake it off again.
“You taught this to yourself?” Steve asked, a bit of surprised leaking into his tone. Tony just smirked a little, and nodded.
"I have a truck," Tony said. Steve had a point about the transporting part, he hadn't thought that part through. "If we can get a stretcher, I'm sure we can make it work." Steve nodded and put a hand on Tony's back as they headed up for the stairs. They were going to get the man back. Tony would put a second bed in Mary's room if he had, too, if it meant that they would heal better, being together. But Coulson was a tying factor to all of the Avengers, to everyone that was in Tony's house.
"Well, thanks." Tony opened Peter's bag, stealing glances every so often at Steve. The man looked tired, and he knew it was because he couldn't have had more than four hours sleep. Tony himself had been awake all night as well, so he knew exactly when Steve woke up. "Told the boys that they had to help with dishes tonight if I put their clothes away, so that's one less chore for me. But, I think that Peter's going to ask Agent to live with us, as well."
Steve let out a laugh. "Us? I'm pretty sure you Long Island-Italians got into more trouble than us! All your ego and flirtatious ways."
"I can try to prescribe him sleeping aids," Bruce said, knowing that it wasn't what Mary wanted to hear. "I can't make him seek help, none of us can."
"Doom trying a new look for his bots? Because really, he should just stick to all silver." The bot tilted his head a little. "If you're going to try and create something life-like, why stop half way through?" The man turned and Tony saw the red star on the shoulder. Something cold curled in his gut. "You're not a Doom-bot," he said quietly. He needed to get Peter out of there. A hand gripped a gun in his flesh hand, aiming at Tony now.
"You need to get some sleep, Tony, and you've got a sleeping toddler on you, so it's the perfect excuse to go to bed." Mary tried to get him up from the couch. "It's late, and he's going to wake you up at the time that you will sometimes go to bed." Tony wrinkled his nose a little, letting her push him up to his feet. "It's a natural fact, children and Christmas, and waking up too early."
"Probably a little easier for her when she's not off saving the world." Steve smiled at him from the screen of the tablet. "There's a handsome face."
"Fury didn't tell me he was calling you in." The man just did what he wanted, whenever he wanted. And he left Peter alone. Did Peter even know about Mary yet?
“Good, because I already have a bag packed for you, and there’s a car waiting, and the jet is all ready to take off.” Steve grinned at Tony’s slightly impressed look. “I’m learning quickly how to utilize what’s available. I happen to be dating this guy who has a private jet, and more than one house. Seems to me that there is no use in ignoring it, so I’ll use it.”
“Technically, two floors with a loft area,” Tony corrected. “Most of the ceilings are vaulted and opened, to accommodate the glass windows.” Tony turned on a little pout. “We need all the room we can get, it’s almost like buying a very large house, of which we would need if we lived anywhere else. There’s four of us, two under the age of ten, and we both need offices to work out of, and places for our non-avenging, and non-company-owning jobs.” Tony made an aborted motion with one hand, behind Jamie’s back. “I need space, lots of space.”
Mary was waiting in front of the door to the private room in the back of the jet, and looked at Tony, stepping forward to hug him tightly. "Are you insane??" She whispered shouted at him as Tony hugged her back.
"And I'm Scared!" Steve shouted. "I'm freaking out, Tony! This is so much different than just babysitting Peter, or holding a newborn for a couple of hours. This is- I'm her Father, and I'm responsible for her. And I can't find you to talk to you when I start thinking that it's getting too hard!"
Tony watched Steve pull part of the blanket over Wade, adjusting him so that he was comfortable, but careful not to wake him up. A little part of Tony said that Steve was good with kids, but he had always known that. Steve would make a good dad, and that thought was the one that worried Tony a little.
"You dig through my head, you bet your ass you're waking her up!" Tony felt his nails dig into his palms a little. Could he trust him to actually wake up Mary though? It could just be another of Loki's tricks, Tony wouldn't take the small chance of putting Peter at risk by letting Loki perform magic in the mansion.
"I didn't get her daughter pregnant," Coulson said, a smile on his face, looking a little smug in Tony's direction. "I don't think I'm going to have the same problems as you."
"I needed to stretch my legs." She handed another mug to Mary and took a sip from her own. Tony wrinkled his nose at her when he noted that it was tea and not coffee.
Tony knew that he wasn't the only one that suffered from nightmares, but it was almost surreal to watch Captain America go through one, to be affected too much. He still had to separate that Steve Rogers, this Captain America, and the Captain America from his childhood, were very much the same man, and yet human all the same. And because of that, Tony knew that he was playing a very dangerous game right now. Falling for Steve Rogers right now, it wasn't right, and he couldn't promise himself that it was happening for all the right reasons, and not just some delayed reaction of hero worship. What person didn't hope that some famous person secretly met them and instantly fell in love?
"That is a horrible nickname," she breathed out, catching her breath as she pushed through the crowd. "I have had worse though, so it can't be as bad as-" She was cut off by screams, and the sound of two pops. Gunshots.
“Jarvis is already screening all my calls, texts, and emails,” Steve admitted. “And Pepper is making good on that promise to get us our own PR team.”
“You said you didn’t want to dress up as Hercules,” Tony pointed out with a smile. “There is an optional sword and shield, but I figured you’d have a baby with you, or you could just wear the red, white, and blue classic on your back.”
"We read it, but we didn't think that you'd fall for it!" Clint shouted at him. "It's Hydra, Steve!"
Tony didn't think that he had gained this much upwards motion on the hill he was currently climbing to excuse the amount he had just fallen back with all this news.
"We still have to tell Granma and Granpa," Mary told Peter, pulling the boy up on to the couch when he came back over to her. "Let's not ruin the surprise yet."
"Yeah, I wouldn't know about that," Tony muttered, moving the bed. "Although, does it count if I changed rooms with different boarding schools?"
“What do you think, Vee?” He asked her one day, resting his chin on his arms as they watched the eggs. “which one do you think will be the first to hatch?” Vee cooed a little, swishing her tail in the general direction of the one closet to her. “You think that one?” Tony moved a little, pulling Vee over to cuddle her in his arms. “Well, I think you’re right.”
"I've seen him before," she said a little more hesitantly. "Last week when I was at the grocery store."
Steve was able to get one sock on, but she kept trying to grab the other sock from his hand, liking to have bare feet apparently. "Not going to lie, I'm actually pretty scared. Maybe scared isn't the right word, but I'm a little freaked out. Felt like just the other day I was watching Tony with Peter, and I thought to myself that it would be nice, to have someone to come back too at the end of the day. Now, here you are, and I'm kind of afraid that I'm going to do the wrong things, or that I won't be able to keep you safe enough. You didn't exactly come from a safe place, and I'm sure they're not happy you're gone."
Unbeta'd, and Marvel owns more of this than I do. Also, all music/movies/tv shows belongs to those that wrote/performed/produced/etc them. I use them for humor and good times.
“Tony?” Steve called, trying to draw his attention back up. Tony could hear Jamie crying in the back. “Tony are you alright?” Steve asked more urgently.
"Mr Stark!" The shouts started up again. "How old is he?" "Why can't we have his name?" "Can you release any official photos?" "Was it the mothers ideas to keep it secret?" "Does he have your last name?"
"Because he's apparently a fan?" Steve remembered the picture he just saw, with the little boy wearing his shield.
Steve had shooed Peter and Wade over to the other bench, keeping the cotton candy away from Jamie, much to her pouting displeasure. “My first word was Stark?” Peter asked, a skeptical look in his eyes.
Mary tilted her head a little, looking over at him, catching her breath. "Tony? Did he do something? I mean, yeah, he can be an ass some times." Steve stared evenly at her. "Okay, so most of the time. But you help with Peter, and he loves Peter, possibly more than himself. Which is a major improvement from like, three years ago."
He heard the shout from Thor, and turned just in time to have the hammer slam into his chest. He gasped, the suit actually giving way a little under it, the chest plate touching the arc reactor. The HUD flickered a bit, becoming an all too familiar thing now, and Tony glared, cocking his head a little to the side.
"Not thinking about it Bruce," Tony said, putting his hands on Steve's shoulders and directing him back towards the dance floor. "Doing it!" Steve looked vaguely scared, not sure what was going on. "Alright, Spangles, just listen to the song, and watch everybody else. I have faith in you."
“It’s good to be back, J,” Tony said, then slid down on the couch, slouching down to let Jamie lean against his stomach. “Hey, Petey, why don’t you show Papa the bedrooms and bathrooms right away?”
The blonde walked down the hall towards the room that had been set up for Jamie, and saw Mary inside trying to get the girl dressed. He could hear her whining, and then saw her squirming on the changing table. “Now, Jamie,” Mary said to her. “You can’t see your Papa with no clothes on.”
"How many does she already have?" Tony asked, raised an eyebrow at the little girl. She seemed to have a devious glint in her eye.
"Get dressed, killer," Steve said as he headed back for the bedroom. Tony hopped down to the floor to follow him. "We've still gotta make breakfast for the boys before the others get here."
"Daddy?" Tony closed his eyes briefly, a little smile on his face. "Are you done fighting bad guys?"
Tony shook his head. "No, I made the limit rule. It's a personal thing." Natasha looked like she was about to say something, but Tony cut her off. "No more personal questions, we are so not a level of friends where you can ask about all that stuff."
Steve Rogers seething with anger was not even close to what she had expected. "Were you ever going to tell me who Peter's father was? That all this time Howard Stark's son has been coming around??" Steve knew that he was probably overreacting a little, but he'd been awake for almost a year now. After getting what he could from his own searches, and from Howard's file, he had gone to SHIELD, and had gotten some unexpected help from Natasha Romanoff. She was undercover as Tony Stark's PA Steve had found out then, and it was obvious that she knew about Peter. It wasn't Mary that had told her either though.
“What if that is what I’m aiming for?” Tony asked, watching the numbers of the floors steadily flash by.
"Then he probably would have finished Howard's plan," Tony said under his breath. "Think of all the things that Hydra could do if they were able to control me, which they were, and if I was their own little Soldier." A thought hit Tony, and he turned in the chair to look at Coulson. "Where is Loki's scepter?" That had Bruce's attention, too.
Jamie scooted on her butt a little, then carefully turned over to her knees so she could face Steve's feet now. He kept his feet still as she arranged herself, and started to pull off one of his socks. "Is this the exploring appendages stage? Or is it just all part of the curious stage?" Tony had told him to just trust his gut with Jamie. Jarvis was loaded with thousands of parenting books so he could help give advice, but when it came down to what her personality would be like, Steve had to decide how to work with that on his own.
"Fine," Tony bit out. "Tell him I'll be there in five." Tony dried his face, double checking his lines and edges, before deeming it suitable. He pulled on his tee, squinting a little in the mirror. "Jarvis, retinal scan." He kept his eyes open for a few seconds without blinking, before turning and walking out of the bathroom.
“Mom tells me that he stood up to your black-mailing ex,” she said with a smirk. “Went all righteous Captain America on him.”
"The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium." Tony grinned and pushed on Bruce's arm in excitement. "Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesize."
The Agent grabbed his phone, tapped out a few things before a frown crossed his features. "I don't like that look, Agent."
“Don’t think, I can,” Tony gasped out. He closed his eyes briefly at a sudden lance of pain. Whatever was trying to get into the arc reactor didn’t like it. He felt something moving around it, getting underneath it, probing his chest, exploring what its purpose was inside of his body. When he was able to open his eyes again, he saw Thor approaching with some kind of golden box in his hands.
"I think I understand," Steve said with a little nod. "If things for some reason don't work out, you don't want Peter to know."
Tony's phone buzzed on the table with an alert. Had anyone been paying attention to the groom, they would have seen the wink and nod to the hidden camera Steve had set up a few seconds earlier. A new song had been added to Steve's playlist. '
"You're looking a hell of a lot better than I imagined," he replied, helping her stand, then hugging her with one arm. "Kind of a sight for sore eyes."
"Bunk down," he barked out. "Go over reports, better this time. Jarvis will fill you in, and he'll help with what you need. And you're both to avoid this floor like it's filled with the plague."
Bucky threw a towel to Steve over the bar of the shower curtain when the water shut off. “Don’t want to make Tony jealous?” Steve asked with a bit of a laugh in his voice when the towel came sailing over.
“You’ve been housing a universal criminal?” Rhodey asked, a little bewildered. He was still taking his cues from Steve and Tony though.
"Yes, Sir, of course." Tony huffed out a breath. They walked through the empty lobby, the business side of the Tower closed for the night, and Tony and Mary offered a greeting to the night guard. Although the Tower could go into lockdown mode, and offer more than enough security measures through Jarvis alone, the others working in the building felt better with security around, and Tony didn't mind the extra bit of precaution.
"He's a giant puppy, let Steve go." The head of the bed was starting to move up, and Bucky slowly, almost painfully, brought his hand back down. "We figured out that he likes to be called James, if you have to call him anything at all."
"I'm actually kind of wishing that I had brought that drink over here with me," Tony mumbled, then turned to face Mary. She slipped from sitting on the arm of the couch to sitting on the other end of the couch from him. Tony didn't like that.
"If your Captain manages to stay alive." Tony arched an eyebrow. "You have missed all the fun while we were transporting you. Captain America is facing off against the entirety of SHIELD, excuse me," he smirked a bit, "Hydra."
"Sir," Jarvis interrupted Tony and Bruce's conversation. "There's activity on Captain Roger's playlist."
They had approximately five minutes before Nick Fury walked into the lab. "What are you doing, Mr Stark?"
Tony bit his bottom lip a little and nodded. "Yeah, I mean," Tony sighed. "Yeah." He lifted up his t-shirt to show Bruce what was going on on his chest. Bruce entered Scientist mode and leaned in, pushing his glasses further up his nose. "These didn't start until last spring, and I've been able to hold off some the spread-"
"I don't understand what the Disney song has to do with anything, though," Tony confessed. And did the Shield song have to do with Steve's actual shield, or the organization? "Jarvis, can you get Mary down here?"
Tony though, Tony was a different matter entirely. After the first week of not being able to sleep, of Mary staying up with Steve, he had been able to admit that perhaps he needed help. Even with the Super Soldier Serum, he still needed to sleep. Tony was the opposite. Unless it came to Peter, he would rather take a firing squad of rocket launchers outside of the suit than admit that something was wrong or that he needed help. To Tony, there was nothing that he couldn't fix, nothing that he couldn't handle on his own. Mary suspected that had more to do with how he was raised as a child, and then his parents death at Fourteen, but it didn't change what was happening now.
Little arms reached up for Bucky, pulling both men’s attention down to her. Her bright blue eyes were staring straight at the assassin, letting her intentions be clear that she wanted him to pick her up. Tony glanced over at Steve, watching Jamie carefully, but it didn’t look like he would move to stop the interaction if it happened.
"And I don't think my job would appreciate the attention we would get." Tony nodded at Mary. He knew that she worked for the government, for the FBI, and they probably didn't want that spotlight.
This worked differently though, as Jarvis informed him that system power was now at Four Hundred percent capacity. Tony smirked a little. "How 'bout that." Tony powered everything up, shooting both hand repulsors at the man, and a unibeam shot. It threw him back and Tony didn't waste any time in following him, slamming him through the tree completely.
Steve chuckled lightly and nodded. “Yeah, I’ll be sticking around. It’s kind of horrid traveling in July in the southern US anyway,” he said to her. “It’s very hot and humid.” Mary laughed, just nodding.
Mary looked at the circuits and blinked, both impressed and overwhelmed at what she saw. She started to pull on the main power levers before heading over to the center console. There was a faint clink and she looked up to see Tony slide over onto the glass. She bit her lip, sparks in the air. "It's ready Tony, get off the roof!"
"You're not in custody at all," Mary told him. "You were working with both the Army and the SSR at the time, and the SSR is now known as SHIELD. You technically still work for SHIELD, and we're using that technicality to keep you out of custody from anyone." Steve glanced over at her. "They've named me your Handler, but basically I'm going to help you understand all the changes that have happened, and help you make a decision on what's going to happen now."
"Stark, we need a plan of attack!" Steve couldn't believe that Stark was just going to jump after this guy, with no plans for anything! How was this man a good father for Peter?
Steve glanced up and saw an iron Man helmet sitting on the desk with wires attached to the inside. He frowned a little when he saw that it looked different than the helmets that he had seen before. This one still had the same slitted eyes that lit up, and it still opened the same way, but the gold of the helm extended well up and over the head. The sides were white, but something seemed off. It reminded him of some of the space suits in the modern Sci-Fi movies that Tony was introducing him too. What was important, was that it was not the same helmet that he had seen Tony working on last week.
Tony nodded. "Because I can trust them." Steve caught the small wiggle in Tony's spine, the slight show of discomfort. "Peter is still a child, and kids are full of innocence, for the most part. And Pepper has just been with me for so long."
Watching Tony grab the bags, cut the holes, and work with an amount of focus he hadn't seen before, Steve was impressed with the work that Tony was doing, even with the sunglasses still on. He put down a base of blue frosting, then started to put down two red circles with a white circle between them, and put down a perfect start in the middle. He did that two more times, three Captain America cupcakes sitting there, looking nearly perfect. Tony grabbed the red and black frosting, placing them together, before making a swirled cupcake.
Tony adjusted his sunglasses a little, waiting on the tarmac by the car as the jet landed. It had been a while since he had seen Mary's parents, and her mother still gave him the evil eyes, but he could not appear to be nervous in front of them. Only the Fitzpatrick's could make him forget that he was the great Tony Stark. To them, he was just the man that had made their daughter pregnant, and had a hand in Peter's life. Mary's Dad kind of liked him though.
“The Tower doesn’t have the space, or security, that I’m looking for. I’ve already been shipping the complete suits to Malibu.”
"Loki." Tony heard Thor's tone with just a pinch of disapproval. Tony took a breath, his head feeling a little light, and there was a hand on his upper arm.
"You'll be okay here with the trouble maker?" Tony asked as he watched Jamie take the empty bowl from Steve, swiping her fingers around to get any that he missed.
“You’ve taken the only available bathroom! Whatever shall I do!” Tony lamented, rolling his eyes with a smile and turning to go into Peter’s room. He grabbed a change of clothes for the boy and dropped them by the door. “Alright, Stinky Pete, there’s some clothes out here for you. Don’t get all pruny!”
He managed to get Peter to wake up enough to change into his pajamas and then tucked him under the blankets, slipping a stuffed animals into his arms. Tony took a quiet pleasure in acting like what he thought a normal parent would do, one who hadn't grown up in the spotlight of cameras and privilege. It was also another reason why he was generally alright with Peter living full time with Mary, because he wanted Peter to have a somewhat normal upbringing. He wanted Peter to be able to understand how everyone lived, to be able to connect on some level with people who did weekly grocery shopping on their own, those that lived on a budget and didn't shop exclusively at designer stores, and where eating out was a luxury event, not an option that could happen if you were bored.
"I think Loki's trying to wind us up," Steve said, looking back to Bruce, too. "This is a man who means to start a war, and if we don't stay focused," Steve leveled a pointed look over at the other arc reactor, "he'll succeed. We have orders, we should follow them."
"Tony, where are you?" he said quietly to the ceiling. Steve wanted to put on his suit, grab a quinjet, and just start searching, everywhere. He'd kick down the door of every location that Tony had found in those file, and gets answer one way or another, but he knew it'd be useless. Steve had given the list of coordinates that had been on the thumb drive to Meg, to give to Bucky, since it was obvious that he was making himself scarce whenever Steve was about to show up. The response he had gotten back was that most of them weren't Hydra locations, but that they'd probably be cleared out by now anyway. He had hinted that they should be looking overseas, though.
"Dammit!" Tony shouted, but they were already flying away. Of course SHIELD would try something like replacing Captain America. Tony was going to have words with Coulson and Mary, very soon. "Jarvis, tell Coulson I'm on way to get Peter. Connect me to Bruce."
“What’s that?” Mary leaned up a little to try and look at the papers in the file he was holding. Steve felt like he should leave the room, lest Phil rope him into paperwork himself.
"That tech can work on something that small?" Bruce asked. The noise was dying down in the background, and Tony assumed that he was heading inside. "Does it charge like a battery?"
“I actually thought you would have said less,” Tony hummed as they walked out of the room, following behind Peter.
"That's not a bad idea." Tony nodded, stealing a piece of bacon when Steve turned his head back to the stove. He pointed at Steve, sliding out of the kitchen. "That's actually a really good idea. I like it. Okay, I need to-"
"This is better than the pool room at SHIELD," Steve said as he stood back up, looking back over at Tony.
"I do!" Steve said with a little more enthusiasm then he should have. He had just watched The Wizard of Oz with Peter last week. "I understood that reference."
He knew that Afghanistan changed Tony, not just physically, but mentally, too. But he could see bits of Tony still peeking out. Pepper had called him when Tony insisted on having a party at the Dubai house the other day. Rhodey would probably be more worried that maybe Tony had changed too much, but as he saw Peter hugging Tony, and Tony's truly genuine smile, he wasn't as worried. Maybe this kid would be good for Tony.
"You haven't forgotten Friday night, have you?" She asked. Jarvis brought up a small calendar in front of Tony, but he swiped it away before Bruce could look at it.
Tony narrowed his eyes at Meg, then looked back to Peter. He could get the boy to crack. He'd never get Wade to crack. Tony leaned in closer to Peter, who didn't move, but was trying not to giggle. He made a big show by taking an exaggerated sniff around Peter.
"He wanted me to turn back to grab it," Tony said with a smirk. "He thinks he's going on camera." Pepper and Tony both shared a laugh and Steve frowned a little. Tony watched Pepper walk over to Steve putting out her hand to shake.
"Yes, yes I am," Tony nodded. "In fact, I'm at the old Manor, so you already know that there's plenty of room for you here. J's got this place on lock down. So what do you say?"
"Mary and I made a list for him," Steve confessed. "A list of words that he's already heard, and not too repeat. We're hoping he shared it with Wade."
This wouldn't be the first time that one of his one-night conquests had made their way to his office; he was Tony Stark, everyone knew who he was by now. No, the surprise had been in the way of the small infant in the car seat that she had brought with her. Before Tony said anything, Pepper had called for a DNA test kit, (and he was glad that those were held on retainer in the building), and now they were waiting. The woman, Mary, hadn't argued about letting the lab downstairs process the DNA, saying they had better equipment than any other hospital or lab. The office was nearly silent, except for the occasional sound from the one month old. It seemed that he had been about to take a nap, and Tony was grateful. He was trying to will away the pounding in his head, and he's pretty sure that if there had been a wailing baby, he might have done something that even he would have regretted.
"I don't like to be handed things because when I would try to show my Dad stuff he would slap it from my hands," Tony confessed, speaking quickly, and if Steve hadn't of been looking at Tony he might have missed it. "When hands come towards me I think that I've done something wrong, and that I'm going to be punished for it, because for as much as I'm adult I can't help but to revert to a child being demeaned by their father."
"Nazi sympathizer, Baron Strucker. Yeah, that sounds like a douchey name." Tony slid his finger along the screen, scrolling through the information. "There's no affiliations listed, but this guy is definitely the one who's funding these guys."
"Shall I store this on the Stark Industries Central Database?" Jarvis asked, the default place to save most projects.
“-against a Jedi,” Tony continued. Peter turned, tucking himself a little more against Steve. “Fortunately, and unfortunately, Cap here has the ability to adapt to nearly anything he can use as a weapon.”
"No!" Tony kicked up and rolled. He opened his eyes and saw that he was on the floor now, breathing heavily, his room empty. He took a deep breath, hand going to rest over his arc reactor, feeling the buzz, and feeling his heart hammering in his chest. There was no way that he was going to get to sleep tonight.
The little girl looked around surprised, eyes big, and Steve leaned in to kiss her head. "Papa's gotta go somewhere, I'll be back!" He called out, running for the already open elevator as he spoke. He thought about grabbing his shield, but he didn't want to waste anymore time. It wasn't the first time he had fought without his shield, and it probably wouldn't be the last.
"I can't ignore a distress call." Steve announced in his best Captain America voice. "Mr Stark, I must command you to stop your evil water ways."
“Something like that,” Tony said quietly. “I, uh, found something today. I think she’s working with Colonel Wilson.” Steve sat up a little and stared at Tony. “Yeah, I know. I’m not exactly inspired with confidence.”
He was exhausted, had been for several days. He never usually complained about it, being used to it for most of his life. At first it had been constant exhaustion from being sick all the time, from taking all the meds that his Ma had been able to get for him from the hospital, then from his time in the war and hunting down Hydra. Now, it seemed that it still didn’t stop. Tony was there to help, and he would never be able to thank the man enough for that. He had allowed Steve to be a part of his son’s life, and then there was Jamie. Steve loved the kids, and would do anything for them, of that he was certain, but he was tired. Jamie was nearly a year old, but still needed constant attention, and then there were the art lessons and Peter, and the self defense classes with both Peter and Wade. He wasn’t complaining, really he wasn’t, but sometimes he just needed a little break.
"Yeah, hey," Tony nodded a little, looking around a bit, not letting Steve's eyes settle on anything. "Fancy seeing you around here, getting out of your apartment and all that. Have a meeting or something?"
“Just got word that Strange is back at his place,” Tony told him. Steve stood up walking over towards him. “Thought I’d check and see if there’s anything else we need for Peter’s birthday while I was out.”
“Mr Steve will having a workout afterwards,” Steve told him. “And I should be dragging you down with me,” he poked Tony’s side. Tony nearly jumped and shifted to get away from his finger.
"Sorry, no more tortures devices to attach to my face," Tony growled out with a glare. "I'm sure that I can find your old friend tho-" His words were cut off with a gurgle and a gasp when Loki moved, a hand to Tony's throat, slamming him against the wall of the room.
"Sir, the drones are rigged to explode," Jarvis told him urgently in a broken voice. "Colonel Rhodes has regained control."
"Sometimes you can sleep when doom and destruction are in the same room with us, and times when we've actually lessened our list of worries, you're up all night." Tony pressed a kiss to the side of Steve's head. "What's on your mind?"
"You have to save me from your friend!" Meg squawked and Tony pushed her leg with his foot. "She's making me watch this show, and the first episode is really questionable."
“Is here to observe,” Steve said, turning his gaze to the two SHIELD agents. “One day he’ll be out there with us and I don’t want him trying to play catch up.” The two scowled a little, but didn’t talk against the Captain. “When we’re training I want us to try and stick to code names, so we keep it up out in the field.”
"Sir," Jarvis spoke up. "There is a potentially fatal buildup of ice occurring." Jarvis threw up the warnings, letting him know.
“I’m sorry that you have such delicate sensibilities,” Tony retorted. “I would have thought after the Army, and babysitting all these kids, that you’d have an iron stomach.”
"We're family, like it or not, and I'm realizing that I could have been liking it for a hell of a lot longer." They both shared a laugh and Tony smiled.
Tony watched him closely, letting out a breath when he stopped coughing, pulling him into his chest, arms around him. His own heart was beating so fast that he was sure it would override the arc reactor, and bring the shrapnel into his his heart from the fear and adrenaline alone. Peter sniffed and Tony felt some of his tears on his neck. His heart broke a little at the sound and the tears.
"You're allowed to call him Bruce all the time now," Tony told him, watching Steve's form. "You don't have to switch back and forth, I think you've earned the right to a first name basis."
"Because of Jamie?" Tony raised an eyebrow when Peter seemed to curl up a little more on top of Tony, tilting his head down. "Cause she's gonna need so much attention now?" Peter was not warming up to the newest addition.
"Well, she isn't joking with the names." Steve let out a breath as he wrapped his arms around Tony, dropping his head onto Tony's shoulder. "I missed this, too."
“You made it happen,” Tony breathed as he lifted his leg to hook around Steve’s knee. “Just that one time so far.” He swallowed and closed his eyes as his fingers moved against Steve’s skin. “But, I think we’re gearing up for a repeat.” Tony spread his hands out, feeling the warmth of his skin, feeling his skin start to bead with sweat.
"That's not how the world works anymore, Captain," George said to him, taking a step back. "You have to do whatever it takes to get ahead in this world."
In the end, all Tony had to do was talk Pepper in circles until he sprung it on her that he wanted to make her CEO. She was shocked, he knew she would be, but had accepted. She also managed to get out of him that he had wanted to spend more time with Peter, and she could almost forgive him for selling off their private art collection.
"I'm told that I can't kill you." But I want to, isn't said. "But that they need you to do something."
"She wants to talk to you, Daddy." Peter ran back over to them, and Tony wrapped his arm around his waist to stop him from sliding across the floor. Tony took the phone back from Peter, and Peter bounced back over to Steve's laptop, Steve turning to watch him briefly. Tony eyed the motion, completely not jealous though.
The elevator let off a soft ping and Steve and Bruce walked into the living room, Bucky behind them already looking a little broody. Tony sat on the couch opposite of Loki, not looking at anyone, but aware of where everyone was. He became intensely aware when there were a few more sets of feet stepping in as well. Barton, and Romanoff, (who hadn’t showed up until nearly the end of the scheduled party time, thus ensuring that Bucky and Meg stayed away,) and the surprising sounds of Rhodey’s boots. Any other time Tony would have jumped up at the prospect of his best showing up, but something had been grating on his senses, and by extensions, his nerves, all day long.
"Yeah!" Peter exclaimed, he and Wade running for the door. Tony followed them, Steve stepping up next to him.
"I'm afraid not, Sir," Jarvis answered, sounding like he was sorry. "I'm finishing the link-up with the SI satellites." Tony sighed a little, but nodded. The elevator opened on the med bay level and the three walked out. "Shall I place a call to Dr Duff?"
"She has cleared the Expo, Sir." Tony let out a breath of relief as he flew for the highest roof he could get to.
"Still dealing with my own Daddy issues, thanks Howard," Tony muttered and rubbed circles on Peter's back. "But, I'm trying, and I gotta think, that maybe, that counts for something. Right?" Tony looked back at Mary, the question in the air, the question in his eyes, lingering inside of him.
"Okay," Peter nodded. "How much longer does Wade get to stay with us?" He asked, setting his bag by Steve's in the living room.
"Yeah! They got me a book to draw in!" He unzipped his bag and pulled out a sketchbook. "It's all blank paper, and they say it's just like adult artists use!"
“If you don’t go and protect my kids, I’m gonna blast you with the unibeam,” Tony told her quietly as he carefully stepped back over to the suit. He unlocked it and lifted it, closing his eyes as it formed around him, trying to ground himself.
"Where do you think you're going?" He pointed a hand towards her and Peter, Peter starting to cry louder, his grip tighter on Mary. "You just had to intervene. I would have let you and your son live, but now, your services are no longer required." Mary's eyes widened when the machine gun in the arm started to whir to life.
“What the hell is he talking about?” Barton demanded. Tony closed his eyes tightly. “Why the hell is that monster here? Why is he with someone who’s supposed to be one of the good guys, at least in our files? And what does it sound like you’ve known where he was all this time?!”
"This, this is inhumane!" Tony shouted, closing his eyes after a second, everything spinning. "It's against my rights, or some kind of bullshit! I've been violated!"
Clint flipped, forcing Tony down to the ground. As he got to his feet, the armor had abandoned Steve and was there, pinning Clint to the couch with an outstretched hand. The repulsor in the palm started to glow, not firing, but enough to make Clint freeze. Steve moved, not thinking before reaching for Tony’s arm. He was about to pull away, but Tony was already turning, his arms moving. Palms slapped at Steve’s wrist and hand, forcing them down. He knew that Tony’s motive was to keep his attacker’s hands and arms close together, keep them from being able to move them, that way they couldn’t grab him to incapacitate him. It was one of his fears, after the AIM attack in the summer, being unable to get to the kids.
"I see him, a few times a month." And as Tony said it, he knew it sounded pathetic now. What kind of father only sees his child a handful of times a month? "I try for once a week." His voice was weaker than he wanted.
“I’ve learned very quickly,” Steve told him. “I also know that Tony had work to do with Stark Industries while we were gone, and he’s still on this kick to make you babysit. Mary and Coulson are enjoying it because it means they can catch up on work as well.” Steve tapped in a code, and let Jarvis run a scan before the doors opened and Bucky followed Steve towards his ‘area’. “I also know that Peter is his father’s son, and Wade is intense, and you are fresh meat for them.”
"He's still just a baby, Bruce," Tony whined a little. "He went into the war at drinking age, for fucks sake, and then he never really, left the war. He fell in the ship, and he came out here, and I'm sure Mary did what she could, and then he was suddenly Captain America again when Loki came, and he's never been able to grow up."
He wasn't sure how long he stood there, looking at all the tags, but his eyes only focusing on one set.
“Did you have to kill any of them?” Steve’s eyes widened a little. He hadn’t been expecting that question to come from the young man.
Steve was sitting with the two boys in the living room while Tony was making the hot cocoa. He claimed that Steve couldn't be in the kitchen because he was making his secret hot cocoa, and it was a family recipe that no one else could know. Peter claimed that it would be worth it. Steve let Peter and Wade pick a spot on the couch, and then go through the movie list. Steve had told Wade that he had done a good job with helping Peter in the bedroom while Tony was comforting the younger boy. Wade seemed to have done this before, and Steve was curious about why a young boy knew how to comfort night terrors.
“Har har, very funny, Parker.” Tony poked her side and she tried to scoot away from his finger. “Is it my first choice? No, but Steve made comments to our baby boy, and now he’s learning the consequences of said actions, and a vacation with my son is something that really should have happened a while ago.” He caught her eyes. “I mean, when was the last time it happened?” Mary looked at him, blinking, and Tony made a noise. “See, if you have to think about it that long, the answer is either ‘Not at all’, or ‘Too long ago.’”
Tony took a deep steadying breath, before clenching his jaw, anger burning through his body more than the palladium did. "Jarvis," Tony growled a little, heading over to his computer. "Get Mary on the phone, now." Bruce put his bags down by the door, deciding to walk around Tony's workshop while he talked to whoever he had to.
"So, I assume that he fessed up?" Tony asked, and took a drink of coffee. The caffeine was a welcome addition to his system. "Did he say why?"
Tony smiled when he saw Rachel's apple cake sitting on the table. "You spoil us, Rachel, another apple cake."
"Could be good for you," Rhodey said, pulling out some frozen chicken. "Might help you come to terms with it?" Tony leveled an irritated gaze at him, one that he reserved for people who thoguht he should go to therapy, or rehab. "You can't tell me that everything is normal, now, Tony."
"You're still a little wobbly, like newborn calf," she giggled at his face at the comparison. "I can't believe you even managed to get Phil to help with this," she said as they went back to simple moves.
Bruce's eyes hardened, then softened after a second. "Tony is a very bright individual." Steve nodded his agreement. "And he was still young when Howard approached me. I'm still not really sure how he had heard of my research, but that's of little importance anymore. I didn't know of what he had intended until much later."
"He's actually pretty serious about this," Steve said to her, noting her shocked expression. He helped her up from the chair to get her moving.
He turned his head, stumbling in the sand, the sound of blades in the air coming closer. Helicopters! Tony started to wave his arm, shouting, something welling up in his chest. They had been looking for him, they had come, they had actually come!
"Jarvis, lights at 70% please," Tony said quietly, the lights dimming in the room. "I thought you two would staying at your parents place." They both headed over to the couch, Tony gently sitting down, careful not to disturb Peter. "And how did you get in here without Jarvis telling me?"
Tony let out a little hum and nodded, turning back to the tablet. He heard her get in the elevator before he slumped on the couch, putting a hand over his face. He hadn't gotten a good night’s sleep since Steve left again, and Pepper was taking advantage of him not being able to leave the building. He had attended more meetings in the past week then he had in all of January.
Tony turned, stalking over to the boundaries he made. It wouldn't hurt him if he crossed over, only Loki, but they had all agreed to stay out of arms reach of the madman. "No, you said you could wake her. Which is it?"
"A few things, actually," Tony said, both hands around the mug. "We're having a big family dinner when the boys get back, so I'm extending a formal invitation to you as well, because I'm told that's polite. We both know you're always invited, anyway"
"What's up, Cap?" Tony called from somewhere in the workshop. Steve looked around, then saw a pile of metal shift.
Steve almost sobbed when he saw Arc and Brave, and he practically fell into them. He pressed his body into Arc’s, his arms wrapping around the giant dog, and he let out a soft, happy, cry when Brave’s wing wrapped around them. They were back, they were alright. Then it happened.
"Still a no, there, Rudolph," Tony said, pointing at Loki. Loki raised an eyebrow at him. "And you know you did more last night."
"Hey, come on," Obie interrupted him. "In public, the press. This was a board of directors meeting."
"Bye, Peter," Steve said, rubbing his back a little. "You know where I am, any time." Peter nodded and took Tony's hand. "It was nice to meet you, Tony." Steve also didn't like that he didn't know Tony's last name, but Mary had said that he didn't want others to know, to keep Peter unknown from big buisness, or any cameras that might show up. Steve could see the sense in that as he learned about how bothersome cameras could be for anyone with any kind of importance in this new time. Tony was respecting both Mary and Peter's privacy, even if he was keeping them a secret from everyone else. Steve really just wanted to have a heart to heart with this man, to clear things up.
“I’m going to experiment, Vee, Jay.” Tony said one day as they walked over to the corner that held the Eevee incubation center. The only other living person who knew about the corner was Pepper. If anyone else came close to the workshop, Jarvis would activate the mobile wall to hide them. Tony was paranoid after his kidnapping, and he wanted to keep his companions, his family, safe.
Tony sat at the edge of the bed, trying to pull back the covers, but Steve moved first, having two free arms to do it. The comforter and sheets were pulled back, and Tony gently put Peter down, not worrying about putting him pajamas at the moment, and tucked one of the stuffed animals on the bed between his arms. Peter snuggled into the pillows, gripping the stuffed animal, and Tony covered him back up. He motioned to Steve to leave the room, dimming the lights at the door, but not fully shutting the door.
"She's an absolute handful," Tony said as he hung up. "Bit of a smartass, too, I can sense it lingering under the surface."
“Don’t be mean,” Tony pouted a little. Steve rolled his eyes watching the boys devour the food. “Now put that super metabolism to work and help me finish this food.”
"I can get it in front of the Director," Coulson nodded. He took his PDA back from Mary when she offered it. "Shall we go get a table from the restaurant before Tony and Peter get there first?"
"I heard him moving on the bed," Wade said and Tony looked over towards him. "And then I thought I heard him talking, and I knew that he was having a dream."
Steve stopped, panting again and looked at Tony. "You are an amazing father," Steve said with such heat that Tony had to blink, a little startled. "You are the best father that Peter could ever ask for, and he's a lucky little boy, and no one else can say otherwise." Tony was about to open his mouth, to calm Steve down, but the bigger man continued. "I was wrong to think what I did about you, when I first woke up, before even meeting you, and after meeting you. I thought that you were a deadbeat dad, but you weren't, you were just working with the deck stacked against you. And you went and proved everyone wrong!"
"No, something else is going on with them," Bruce told him. He took off his glasses to rub between his eyes. "Tony, how do they have so much of your Dad's stuff?"
“Tony?” Tony shot back up at the voice, trying to collect himself. Steve was standing just outside the kitchen, looking a little wide eyed at his brood. “I uh, I wanted to come here to apologize….” He was distracted then by the way the Gems all gathered in front of Tony, creating a barrier. Vee sat on the ground between Steve and the pokemon. “It becomes clear to me that I didn’t have the whole story before, and I jumped to conclusions. This is a little unnerving, but this isn’t going to be private, is it?” He said with a slight motion towards the staring pokemon. Tony just shook his head, not saying anything, and Steve just nodded. “Fair enough. I was upset after hearing about Sandy and Katy…. But that’s not an excuse for what I said to you.” Steve looked down at Vee to see her staring back up at him. “I didn’t notice it before, and I should have, but Vee missed you. I thought it was because of how it had been…. You took care of her.” He looked back up at Tony. “You loved her like I did, and I’ll never be able to thank enough for that. I’m sorry, Tony, and I hope you can forgive me. And I hope that it’ll be okay if Vee spends her time between the two of us?”
"You're back!" Tony grinned. He had to put Peter back on the ground, still feeling a bit of the bruises left over by the tazers from the original attack, but he knelt down to keep hugging Peter. He spotted Wade jumping out, hugging Mary, and Rachel and William more calming getting out as well. "I missed you soooooo much."
“Rogers must have been the cutest baby ever,” he heard Sam murmur to someone from behind him. “If he was anything like her.”
Tony put the food on his desk, no longer feeling hungry. His feet were taking him over to the couch, sitting next to Steve. "This nightmare never goes away. Sometimes I jump out after him, but I lose him in the snow. Sometimes I save him, I'm just in time, and the train is falling, slipping off the tracks. And sometimes, luckily not tonight, sometimes I'm the one falling off the train. The snow swallows me up and it's the plane all over again." Steve started rubbing his hands together, like he was trying to get warm.
Bruce was humming, getting up from his seat and going over to the sink. "If you'll excuse me, I'm going to check on the two little troublemakers, then go out to the gardens." He left with a small smile on his face, empty tea cup washed out, humming softly. Steve blinked a little. He wanted to talk to Tony.
"What happened?" Tony demanded after finding his voice. What had SHIELD done? How was he supposed to tell Peter about this? What was going to happen?
“See, there you go again!” Tony pushed against Steve’s side, but the man didn’t deviate from as he walked. “Such a sap! Maybe I was wrong, maybe you’re gonna be the woman in the relationship.” Steve wrinkled his nose up and looked at Tony as they crossed a crosswalk with a small crowd. “I know, technically no one needs to, but you’re just so undeniably sappy, and romantic-“
"Bruce," he said quietly, then looks at the other scientist. It's exactly what he thinks it is. "There's no way they have their hands on this, I made sure this was locked up, destroyed to anyone but you or me."
"Experimenting with Jarvis to get some kind of gauge of old she might be?" Steve nodded. "Did you figure out what name you're putting on the birth certificate?"
“Hey, kiddo.” Steve smiled and walked over to give him a hug, the boy never moving from his piggy-back ride from Tony.
"So, tell me more about Wade," Tony said, pulling Peter back up into his lap as he moved to lay on the couch. Peter moved so that he was sitting on Tony's stomach, facing him, smiling. Peter loved to be close to Tony, and to cuddle in any way. Surprisingly, Tony didn't mind as much as he thought he would. Pepper, and sometimes Peter, was still the only one who could actually hand stuff to Tony without a very visible reaction.
“Oh no! Steve and I get the big bed!” Steve laughed as Tony caught up to Peter, and he turned to look out the window again.
Wade burrowed his head down, looking at the ground, but didn’t leave her protective arms. “Miss Sarah came to the school, but I didn’t know it was her until I got to the office. She was already taking me out before I could say anything to anyone in the office, and she said that if I didn’t get in the car, then someone would be there to hurt Peter.” Steve saw Tony’s hand clench a little. “So I got in the car, cause I didn’t want anyone to get hurt. I thought, as soon as I got out though, I’d be able to kick her, in a way that Uncle Bucky showed us. Then I’d make a run for it, get to the nearest adult, the nearest house, and then call someone.”
"Oh my goodness," Yinsen murmured before coming back over to Tony, finishing getting Tony in the suit. "It worked all right."
Bucky shifted his leg, his foot sticking out now, and Jamie let out a delighted squeal, instantly leaning forward to grab at his sock. “This is really weird, kid,” he said when she managed to pull it off. Jamie put her foot next to his, then started pointing at the different toes, babbling, like she was teaching Bucky something. He tilted his head a little. “You don’t say? Yeah, okay, go ahead and tell me more.” If anything, she seemed to get louder, more excited.
"Who do you think got my foot into the FBI?" Mary asked with a smirk. The two women were too much alike.
"Ugh, that makes me sound so, domestic." Tony moved his mouth, sticking his tongue out like there was something on it. "that's such an ugly word."
Tony rolled his eyes, then set Jamie back down on the floor by the twins. They all seemed to squeal at each other, in a hidden baby language, and started to play together. “Who was on the phone?” Tony asked, leaning against the back of a chair so he could keep an eye the kids.”
Tony pulled out his phone, tapping the screen. "J, send the data over to Mary's phone please." Mary's phone beeped on the tray table and she tapped the screen to bring up the info.
Phil ran a hand through Peter's hair, Tony distantly thinking, again, that Peter needed a trim, and the boy stopped before he could start rambling. Just like a Stark.
"Of course, Sir," Jarvis' voice echoed from his watch as he took the stairs two at a time. At the fifth floor he was informed that the elevator would be waiting for him up on Seven.
"I know, buddy, but that'll stop soon," Tony said quietly. The rest of the house dissolved, and it was just Tony and his son, safe in his arms. Safe this time. He promised he would keep Peter safe, decided that not telling the press, not making him, or Mary, a face to any of his enemies, business or otherwise. But this had happened in his own home. He had been holding onto Peter, and he had frozen, he couldn't do anything. Tony vowed that would never happen again, he would never freeze, never be the reason he couldn't help Peter. If he had too, he would put Peter in a suit of-
"Ms Parker," Coulson said quietly, and she looked over at him. Someone was already moving Pepper to the backseat of the car, and Coulson was handing her the bluetooth device Pepper had been using to talk to Tony. "Hello, Peter." Coulson had met Peter a couple of times, at home, right after she had started her new job. "Would you like to sit with me in the car? That way your Mom can help your Dad stop the bad guy?"
Steve was at the front of the table in the meeting room they sometimes used when they needed to debrief after a mission. Tony was casually sprawled in a chair at the other end, Clint and Natasha on the other side. They had handed Steve a folder with some information to look through, and they were just waiting on Bruce. Coulson sat with a chair between him and Tony, watching Steve. No doubt he had already seen this information, being both Barton and Romanoff's Handler.
"It used to," Tony told him. Of course it hurt him, it was huge compared to his chest, and it had a strange energy running through it that a human body wasn't meant to handle. The latter he had gotten used to though. But the weight of his sitting on his ribs, on his chest? That he didn't think he would ever get used to. Jarvis would have specs for a thinner, more efficient, model ready by now. But he wasn't about to tell his two year old son that it hurt, or how he had gotten it.
"So, he really intended to make Tony into another Super Soldier?" Steve asked quietly. He had volunteered for it, had volunteered for the experiment. Steve had known exactly what he was getting into when he signed up, Dr Erskine had made Steve completely aware of everything that could happen and gave him every chance to back down. Tony would have been a child, and would have done it just to get his parents to notice him. If he had been given a choice.
"Let them in Tasha," she told the spy. Natasha glanced down the hall, looking to see if there was anyone else, before opening the door for them. When Tony and Steve walked in last, Natasha shut the door again. Mary was sitting down at a vanity, Rachel behind her, finishing her hair.
“That’s the voice,” Tony whispered to him. “It’s what I heard....” He sighed as he tried to relax against Steve, but the pain was still feeling too real. “I actually kind of wish that Loki was still around, or alive, so I could try and grill him about this.”
Mary frowned and pulled out what looked like a camera battery, noting that two slots were already empty. "Tony, what is this?" She looked over and saw him looking at the glowing reactor, something brown, and smoking, sliding up out of it. "That was inside of you??" She exclaimed quietly as Tony took the disfigured item out, dropping it in a red container on the floor.
Steve frowned but held up his phone again, pressing Tony’s phone between his ear and his shoulder. He opened up the first app in the social media folder that Tony showed him. It was also set up to show any alerts regarding the Avengers, Tony, and himself.
Bruce was indeed in the kitchen, standing by the stove, a tea kettle hissing, but not screaming yet. There was a tea cup sitting there, with a round metal ball attached to a little chain sitting inside the empty cup. Steve cleared his throat a little, trying not to startle the Doctor. Bruce turned around and gave him a little smile. "Captain." Steve nodded his greeting and Bruce really looked at him. "Would you like some tea?"
"I trust you," Tony told him, trying not to look down at Steve's hand. He trusted Steve, with his life. And that meant not looking down, not letting the paranoia of being betrayed by those he loved infect his relationship with Steve. Steve wasn't like any of them, wasn't like Howard, or Stane, or anyone else. He wasn't the dead man telling him that he had failed Peter.
Wade shook his head. “No, and he won’t, not again. He got too close to me, didn’t even have me tied up.” He now looked up, looking at someone for the first time, expression surprisingly determined. “He hit me his gun, but he didn’t think that I would actually fight back, and I surprised him and he dropped the gun. I grabbed it to keep it away from him, then he was running at me, and I had to stop him.” He paused. “So I did.”
Mary would have to push the button. Tony hung from the edge of the framework, Obidiah trying to still hit him with his missiles. "Time to push the button!"
"How did everything go last night?" Mary asked as she pulled together all the ingredients that Tony already had sitting out. Tony helped her find some more mixing bowls, and Mary washed out ones he had already used.
“Neither are you when you wrap around me like an octopus before you’ve even fallen asleep.” Tony grumbled a little, and Steve moved his fingers to rub circles on the back of his neck.
"It doesn't change the fact that you went out of your way to keep it from me," Steve said to her. He recalled Mary's words every time Peter had spouted out some random fact about his Dad. "you would say that he worked for Stark, that he was doing projects with him. You tried to mislead me from him."
"You need to focus on the problem, Mr Stark," Steve said in a clipped tone. Tony stood up straight, and looked at Steve dead on.
"Yeah, I figured." Tony slid the chair out, walking around the desk, Rhodey following him. "So, I've been thinking about it." He could practically feel Rhodey's eye brow raising. "Tomorrow, I want to start working on my new project. Stark Expo is already underway, nothing else I can do about that until more of the construction comes along, and people start sending me their ideas for presentations. And," Tony turned around to face Rhodey, stopping in front of the display cases of the Iron Man suits, "I want to see my son again."
Steve had taken him on a tour of the Avengers floors last month, after one of the training sessions, so Bucky knew where to go to grab a spare set of sweat pants, socks, and a tee for Steve. He dropped them on a bench, then took a seat. Old memories came back to him every so often, and lately a lot of them were of Steve, before the serum. He and Meg had managed to find a system where he was able to almost meditate, without actually meditating, and unlock his old memories. As he did that though, he was remembering things from the Winter Soldier, and now they needed to work on a system where he could start to come to terms with what he did, what he was forced to do. Bucky needed to work on starting to forgive himself as well.
“I don’t think she’ll be saying Stark,” Steve told him, grabbing a fork from the utensils pile. Tony was already cutting up pieces, knowing Steve couldn’t with one arm around Jamie. She was trying to find the cotton candy.
"If you don't get me to a bed right now, this is gonna be a short show," Tony forced out. He could hear the buzzing of equipment in his workshop, the movement of gears, and the release of pressure from valves from inside the walls. The only thing he wanted to hear was their breath, their words, the movement that they made. Tony was already lost in everything about Steve Rogers at that moment, and he was sure to look into it later, but right now, that's all he wanted, that was all he needed.
Steve frowned, feeling that he was doing too much of that in this room, and moved out Natasha's touch. "I've gotta go talk to him."
"Told you," Tony mumbled under his breath. "I'm hoping that Peter hasn't inherited my wicked skills of not coping with things."
"Daddy!!" Tony froze and looked down. There was Loki, standing outside on his balcony, his hand holding onto Peter's arm tightly. Loki smirked and turned, heading back inside, dragging a stumbling Peter with him. Peter tried to pull back, tried to pull away, but Tony could tell that he was too scared.
Wade raised an eyebrow at him. “Mr Steve’s not our Dad. You know who my Dad really is.” Bucky watched him carefully. “And you know that he’s dangerous. You’d be doing me a disservice by not teaching me how to protect myself.”
"All the stuff from the past," Peter told him, watching all the people walking into the doors of the museum. "Everything that already happened, that we want to remember."
“Don’t worry Stark, I’ll try not to hurt your boy,” Bucky said with a shit-eating grin. Tony let out a bark of laughter, startling Jamie a little, but her attention was drawn back to Peter and Wade.
Steve snorted a little as he took a seat in front of the computer keyboard, and the paperwork he was filling out by hand. “It would probably be better if you just went to one of those little corner markets, instead of a large grocery store.”
"Steve Rogers is a little shit," Tony said as he leaned in to kiss him again. "And I have taken on the burden of keeping you from corrupting the rest of the world. I really should be given an award, I'm thinking the Silver Star, or the Purple Heart."
Coulson nodded, and turned quietly, disappearing from the Tower. Tony closed the tablet, slipping it under his arm. He'd take Peter to the Master bedroom, queue up a couple of movies, tell Peter about Mary, and pray that he could get Peter to sleep. There was no way that Tony would be sleeping, and he was pretty sure that Peter wouldn't be sleeping, knowing that his Mama was hurt.
“He had a Flareon, and I believe he had more.” Steve vaguely thought that he was sounding like a child.
“They’re a little higher on my list,” Steve said softly before pulling his hand back. “It’s got you on bedrest for at least three days, and constant monitoring for a week. They got too close to them,” he said with a motion to the three kids. “They go too close to doing what they wanted for my comfort.”
"You're just short, Mr Tony," Wade said with a cheeky grin. Tony looked down at the boy, then back up with narrowed eyes at the delighted laugh of Wade's mother, Julie, just in front of him.
Tony reached out to touch the piece of marble, feeling the beginnings of texture on the tentacles and near the eyes. He had gained a bit more of an appreciation for art through Steve and Peter, but he found he was most fascinated when he could see it being worked on.
"An ant has no quarrel with a boot." Looking up she could see the ceiling starting to chip, no, it was more than that, but the structural integrity was being compromised.
Peter being excited to see his grandparents was probably an understatement. When Mary and Coulson came over with Peter, the little boys eyes had widened, and he was over to where the couple were in a second, jumping up into his Granpa's arms. This would be the first time that Mary's parents were meeting Coulson as well, and Tony was staring at him, a little wide eyed himself.
"That'll keep him calm," she nodded. She came over and put a cup of coffee in front of him, and held onto one as she sat across from him at the table. "To what do I owe the pleasure of a morning visit?" Julie smiled at him.
"I figured, it's alright Jarvis." The elevator doors opened, and Tony gratefully stepped on with Steve and Peter. "Do you happen to have a location on Brucie-bear?"
“Now would be the time to sneak away,” Phil told them, Jamie’s attention still on her brother. “We’ll see you in the morning.” Steve grabbed Tony’s hand, smiling, and dragged him to the elevator, waving to the kids, Mary, and Phil.
"Nope." Tony shook his head back and forth. "Because, those bad people would have used that bad thing to hurt lots of other people. They might have hurt you, and so I had to make sure that that didn't happen." Tony carded his fingers through Peter's hair. "But you want to know what's more important?" Little hazel eyes looked up at him. "That today is your birthday!" Peter suddenly grinned and jumped up, hands and knees knocking into Tony, making him grunt and chuckle.
"We'll give it some time, maybe she'll grow on you." Peter stuck out his tongue and Tony smiled. He could deal with a slightly jealous son for now.
"Probably because he couldn't at the time," Tony said. "I looked through the package your lawyers had set up, there was a restraining order in there. Smart thinking on their part in my opinion."
Tony gave him a two finger salute, touching the brim of the cap, and followed Peter out of the apartment, closing the door. Steve went over and watched through the peep hole as they went into Mary's apartment. Tony never took the hat off until he was out of view, and Steve blew out a breath.
"I don't know if I quite agree to bringing someone here," Tony said, looking between the two Asgardians. "I know nothing about this, and it's feeling a little invasive if it has to do with my memories."
“I like the way you think!” Tony grinned as they walked across the lobby to the elevator. With so many people around they had been able to keep a relatively low profile since everyone was focused on their own vacation, also Tony kept his sunglasses on, and Steve was working on wearing some scruff that was turning into a beard. Tony had already let him know that he thought it made the blonde look very roguish, and very handsome.
"Tony," Steve put a hand on Tony's shoulder, but didn't pull him back. It wasn't that Loki didn't deserve it. Thor took the gag back, placing it back over Loki's mouth, for a few minutes not feeling so bad about it, and Tony took a couple steps back. Steve saw Tony glance at his watch and blinked. Tony had been buying them time. He probably hadn't planned on Loki's reaction, but he had tried to start an argument to buy them more time.
“So far, just some pictures floating around Twitter mostly,” Pepper told him. He pulled away the phone, putting it on speaker as he stepped into a corner, out of the way of other shoppers, but still able to see his family. His chest warmed at the thought. Jarvis pulled up several social media sights, bring Twitter up front. “Random people snapping pictures, not sure if it’s really you or not.”
"I need to hear those reasons," she prompted. There was a bit of silence, but she could hear things being moved around in the workshop. She knew when Tony was in his workshop when they talked on the phone. "What did I tell you last week, Tony?"
"Jarvis? Where's Tony?" Steve asked, really hoping that he wasn't going to say where he thought he would.
"I had three, Three, vans from the post office here to deliver all the stuff." While she sounded frustrated, she didn't sound mad. "I live in what is generously called a two bedroom house, the size of a postage stamp. My laundry room, second bedroom slash storage room, and most of my kitchen is full of boxes and bags."
“I’ll be fine,” Tony told him. “Jarvis pick up the readings, so I’m not going to accidentally fly into one.” The ‘Again’ is left unsaid. “I still need to know what exactly it is we’re up against. They seemed to be getting bigger and bigger, and if it gets too much, then it will actually break into the Tower.”
"I'm on my way to you, Cap," Tony said, watching Jarvis re-set his flight path. "And who the hell is Sam?"
“I know, kiddo,” Steve said with a nod. He stood, Wade taking the hint to stand with him. “Yeah, I know.”
"Shut up!" She had pulled the phone away, trying to mute the sounds of sniffling. "It's a very grand gesture, and I cry at anything!" She let out fond huff, and Steve could hear her smiling. "Thank you, Steve, really."
"Sounds like a plan. Now, go do Agent-y things, with Agent, and get SHIELD off my back. Bye." He made a motion and Jarvis cut the call. Bruce was smiling at him, the fact that SHIELD probably knew where he was now mostly forgotten.
"So you're going to take her out of here?" Pietro looked him up and down, clearly judging him. "And do what?"
"Agent Mary Parker," Barton responded immediately. He was firmly in Loki's grasp. "SHIELD Handler for one Steven Grant Rogers, aka Captain America. She has a son with billionaire Tony Stark, aka Iron Man."
Tony took a silent breath and grabbed the frosting bags. He felt nothing when that happened. It definitely didn't feel like there might have been actually sparks when their arms had touched. It was just static, static generated by the completely hidden arc reactor. That was it.
Steve lifted his head slowly, and Tony swallowed a little. His movements were sluggish, his eyes seemed glazed and unable to focus, and his lips looked to be turning blue. He had wrapped his arms around himself as he tried to curl up, a violent shiver running through his body. “C-cold,” Steve forced out before his body slumped forward, knees hitting the ground. Tony dropped down next to him to catch him, hands wrapping around his upper arms. Even his shirt felt cold. “Too cold.”
Steve stopped immediately, tossing the whip off the side of the bed, and moved in close, left hand on the small of Tony's back, right hand stroking softly across his welts. “It's ok, pet, it's gone, thank you for telling me, shh, shh, you're ok...” Tony took a deep, if shaky, breath, and let out his tension with a shiver. “There you go, good pet, just relax...” He kept soothing until Tony lifted his head and started to turn toward him, then pulled back.
Tony nuzzled closer, then lifted his head from Steve's shoulder to peer at his face. “Hey, you have any plans for today?”
The Internet was... instructional. He'd already had the 'the Internet is full of porn' talk from Tony. And Clint. And Nat, but she'd been more helpful, helping him figure out how to tell which Google links were blue videos, or written smut, instead of what he was actually looking for. (Clint had mentioned Safe Search, but Nat dismissed it as a crutch.) Granted, that was a bit harder to discern when your search was 'want to kiss my male friend', and he'd stumbled across some
JARVIS chuckled. “There is no evidence to suggest that he plans either thing, Ms Potts. Shall I inform you if that changes?”
Tony shifted his angle, and cried out, the most beautiful noise Steve had ever heard. He rocked again, and turned to look at Steve in gorgeous desperation. Steve slid a hand over to grab hold of Tony's jock (for the first time? How had that happened?) and stroke it, which sent Tony screaming over the edge. Between the sound, the ragged clench of inner muscles, and the sight of Tony, head thrown back and drops of milky liquid spurting from his jock, Steve hurtled headlong into his own orgasm.
Fortunately, distraction came quickly, in the form of Tony storming into the room. “OK, so I’m pretty sure there’s something freaky going on here, but maybe I’m just hallucinating, which, call me crazy, but that might actually be better-” He was dressed only in a t-shirt and flannel pants, his hair wild, suggesting he had actually slept in a bed, and had just now woken up.
Tony was peppier than usual in the elevator on his way down several floors to his official public Stark Industries office and lab. Heck, he was almost singing and dancing, and that was no good. The lab rats would never again fear him if they saw him at anything less than high dudgeon (he might be able to get away with low dudgeon, just for today. What the heck
has been getting lately.” He stepped into Tony's personal bubble and Tony automatically turned his face up. Steve grinned (No. 202, Genuinely Happy) and leaned in to kiss him. “I think the team will figure things out pretty quickly as soon as I kiss you at breakfast.”
Tony laughed back. “Excellent strategizing, Rogers. See, this is why I-” Woah, hey mouth, this is brain, we are so not going there, thank you very much. “I keep you around. Because you plan ahead. But maybe save cooking the bacon for last?” He immediately busied himself with getting out more coffee mugs, and the sugar and cream and whatnot.
As they got into the bedroom, Steve broke the kiss just long enough to pull Tony's shirt over his head. When he found the bed with his shins, Steve shifted from kissing Tony's mouth to kissing his jaw, his neck, his collarbone... Almost drunk on the sense of power he was feeling, Steve
Steve smiled gratefully. “That would be most welcome, milady. Thank you.” He let her tuck her hand into the crook of his elbow, and they headed out of the Great Hall and up the stairs. The suite she led him into was fairly pleasant, open and airy with a balcony, the hanging on the bed and tapestries on the walls clean and bright. He looked around and smiled. “This is lovely. I feel certain I will be treated well here.”
Tony wisely stepped out of his way, but followed after him. “Well, that just won't do. First of all, if we're going to be seen in public together, you're going to have to do better than off the rack slacks and the same t-shirt as every damn SHIELD grunt. I'll take you to my tailor, he'll be ecstatic to work with your proportions.” He snagged a couple of white cardboard containers and a pair of chopsticks, and flopped down onto the couch. “Second, I have preposterous amounts of money, you should help me spend it. Seriously, I could probably afford to buy two or three small nations. JARVIS, get Steve set up with a debit card and a Black AmEx, both linked to my personal account.” Steve, clutching egg rolls and chopsticks in one hand and more white cardboard in the other, sat hesitantly on the couch, and opened his mouth to object. Tony pointed the chopsticks at him. “Believe me, I will never notice your withdrawals. I hardly pay attention to mine until we get up to medium-sized vehicles. JARVIS?”
much reason to wait... “Alright, pet, now just stay nice and relaxed...” He dribbled some lube on his jock just to be sure, then got a good hold on Tony's hips and brought him up and back. When Tony realized what Steve was trying to do, he tensed, his head lifting and turning to look at Steve, but Steve smiled and kissed along his jaw, his neck, his shoulder... “Shh, shh, I got you, this is going to be good...” Tony uncoiled, and let his head fall back again. Steve purred and lowered Tony until the head of his jock breached the ring of muscle. Tony yelped, then shuddered, every muscle going completely limp. The rest of his slide down Steve's jock was more the inevitability of gravity than any action on either of their parts.
“Hush, pet.” Steve smiled as Tony obediently fell silent. “There you go. Now, I get you're partly a Dom, I'm not arguing that, but...” He suddenly latched his hands onto Tony's hips, making the bruises flare with bright, sweet pain, and Tony felt himself go limp... except where he was trying to get hard again. “You clearly like getting bruises. And, oh do I ever want to give you more of them...” Tony's breath hitched as he thought of it, of being dominated by
And the Hell of it was, he knew that, at least for now, they couldn't really be any more public than they would have been in the 30s and 40s. Steve knew he was going to want to kiss Tony, there among the art, but there would be plenty of other people there, with video cameras on their phones, and, well, that just didn't bear thinking about. So it would still have to have the mask of
He came back to himself lying sideways on the couch, Steve still kneeling on the floor, but now with his cheek on Tony's hip, as another black and white movie was starting. “Ug, JARVIS, I cannot deal with any more of this. I need explosions and hokum. Give me
Tony could have stayed there for hours, getting all sorts of new ideas, but he wanted to show Steve things that were of interest to
Thor, when he was there, was good at lightening the mood (pun totally intended, it wasn't like Tony was made of stone), getting the rest of the team talking and laughing and explaining some bit of pop culture to him and Steve. He also encouraged movie nights and video game competitions and karaoke. Oh, God, the karaoke. Tony was glad a hundred times over that he'd set JARVIS up with a karaoke program so they didn't have to go out to a bar and expose the poor innocent public to the way-more-enthusiastic-than-skilled Avengers. Clint and Thor were all volume and no pitch, Nat made up her own words, Bruce wouldn't even have gone, and Steve, for all he tried, didn't actually know the words to anything. If they'd gone to a karaoke bar more than the once, Tony would have drunk the place dry that night, and bankrupted Stark Industries the next day trying to keep the madness out of the media (a losing battle, what with the existence of YouTube and all). But here at the Tower they could have a couple beers, a LOT of pizzas, and whatever lyrics they wanted to come up with. They could also pause between songs to explain things to Thor and Steve if they needed to, and sometimes Tony found himself choosing the most obscure tracks he knew, just so he could show off his knowledge and watch Steve's face light up with understanding.
Tony closed his eyes and focused on just breathing. He had to remind himself that if his body tried to orgasm again this quickly, it was probably going to
In a related note, yes, there will be a press conference. And you know the reporters will have stupid questions for one or all of them. In fact, if you know a stupid question they might ask, please leave it in a comment, or send me a message. If I like it, and/or can think of a funny answer, I might use it when that bit comes around.
always talking, but Thor was much louder. Steve's first real clue was one night, when he was making dinner, and he realized that he was hoping awful hard that Bruce would drag Tony out of the labs tonight. Somehow, it had become the highlight of his day, that moment when Tony showed up in the kitchen doorway.
He didn't even have to think. “Breath play. Nothing where I'm drowning, or suffocating, or...” He pulled in on himself, wrapping his arms around his ribs. Steve sat up a bit more, hugging him gently, and he took a deep breath just to know he could. “Umm... Humiliation? I grew up being teased, bullied, it's very much not a turn-on.” He thought for a minute. “Nothing else is coming up now, but I, ah, I'm pretty sure I'll be thinking about this a lot, so there will probably be a list at some point. Oh, no, wait, one more definite no. No piss or shit.”
The next thing he knew, he was propped up against Tony's headboard, and Tony was gasping something against his mouth. “I want... oh, God, I want you inside me, but you're huge, you're going to have to prep me a bit first, please, I want you to...” What did he mean-? Oh, that was lubricant he'd dropped- Oh, and now he was kissing again, and Steve had to fumble with the tube of lubricant, which at least distracted his libido a little. He broke the kiss to try to get a look at what he was doing, and accidentally squeezed the tube. Well, at least it landed in nearly the right place... He scooped some of it up, trailing it along the crack until he found a different texture. He explored around it a little, getting a sense of it, then slid one finger inside.
