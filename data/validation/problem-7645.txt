“In their final battle against the elephant seals, Theodore became separated from the group. He'd been tossed into a powerful current by a powerful hit from an elephant seal's fin. Days later he washed up on shore, missing a wing and his memory. And his friends believed he was lost for good."
“I can confirm that all clocks are set to the proper time,” said Jarvis.
“Someone snuck Sir a cyanide pill.”
Steve nodded.
"Something is wrong with me, Tony. I'm so screwed up."
“I overheard your conversation with Rune.”
“Get out of bed.”
“Dada.”
“How did you escape the memories? You need an outlet you can refocus that energy both mentally and physically. You’re busying your mind, but you're failing to consider your body. You’re using all that extra energy to mental, trying a physical activity. It will help you sleep a bit better.”
“What about your children?” asked Steve.
“You have no faith in your physical abilities. You must trust your body.”
“I’d start with that stick of his. It may be magical, but it works a lot like a Hydra weapon,” said Steve.
"I got some much-needed perspective."
“Come on man, this isn’t a good look. Open up.”
The next morning a medical team rushed into his room, performing yet another physical on him.
The alpha took off. Moments later there was a sound of gunfire. It drew the guards from the entrance along with a flood of other men. They propelled down the side of the cliff and ran in with Steve at the lead. The two easily took care of the remaining men. The worked their way through the maze of paths at the back there was Rumlow. He was strapped to a chair and bloodied, but alive. There was duck tape across his mouth an improvement in Natasha’s opinion. She ripped off the tape.
Steve wanted to argue, but Natasha’s expression told him not to. He nodded, following her to jet. Steve took a seat in front of her.
Eventually, they managed to find some sort of balance between work and family. It wasn't perfect: he'd missed Piper's first steps while on a mission; Tony missed Piper reading her first book. But they did their best.
“You did.”
“Okay, I’ll see you tomorrow then.”
He took the alpha's hand before he could get the idea of leaving. Steve slowly rested his head on Tony's chest. The touch of the alpha's skin against his was soothing. Tony's hand traveled through his hair.
“That’s a risk you’ll have to accept.”
"All you've told me was you played chess. Why?” he said.
"I'll have to perform a physical exam on you, Steve."
“Dada! Dada!”
July 28, 2012
The alpha smiled, enjoying the fact he provided something the omega took such great joy in.
“Either way, its good for you to get out in the world,” said Barny.
“Not often, but he’s meant to be a blunt tool. We don’t need him to speak,” said Lena.
“Okay.” Piper shrugged; it was an annoyance, but it was tolerable. “So can I go now?”
"I've heard of her. She's written several hypotheses on the structure of super-soldier genetics," said Tony cautiously. She’d come scarily close to the makeup.
Steve woke up, panicking when he didn't feel Piper's presence by his side.
Tony checked his watch a few more hours that's all.
"Happy, he tells me everything," she said.
“You’re not going alone!” said Steve, grabbing Tony’s arm.
“Your husband will be okay. Our doctors are some of the best.”
They didn’t even glance back.
“I’m still here,” he said.
“Are you going completely mental? I can stop. Do you want me to stop?”
“What’s on your mind, Steve?” asked Clint.
“Three in the morning.”
Piper couldn’t look away. She’d never seen Papa like this.
“I have no pups running around,” said Tony.
“Who does that building belong to?” asked Steve.
“A little longer.” He gave the pup a little longer.
Piper yawned, stretching out. Theodore was silently watching over her. Her stomach growled. Normally, when she woke up breakfast was already there. But soon, a man in came in with their meal. That scent! He was the one who hit her. She went to the slot.
“We need to go over the plans for the arc reactor,” said Pepper, as they went back to the living room.
Tony took a breath. “I love you."
Lena’s phone vibrated, disturbing her sleep. She pulled it from under her pillow, groaning when the lab's number blinked on the screen. This couldn't be good. She snuck out of bed, going into the bathroom, and locked the door behind her.
“A beachy place, airplanes crashing into a shipyard."
August 1, 2013
“It isn’t important,” said Tony.
"Happy."
"I will always be here for you," he said. Tony leaned into the powerful embrace, waiting for Steve to relax.
Piper was comfortable with Theodore. He was her only comfort. At first, she found his watching-over-her-so-intensely to be creepy, but she had gotten used to it. It was his way of offering comfort. He didn't seem to know any other way.
“When did you become an expert in thermonuclear astrophysics?” asked Hill.
"Piper, I'm exhausted, and I need time to prepare a course for you."
Tony woke an hour later. Steve’s side of the bed was empty. He got up and saw the studio door was open. Steve was working on a new painting. He could smell the stress and anxiety but was easing as Steve painted. Tony watched from the doorway not wanting to disturb the moment.
“It’s different for every child. Shall we get started?”
Tony roamed the muscular planes of Steve's chest.
“Nice work guys. Excellent good team effort all around.”
“Must be a slow news day,” said Tony with a shrug.
“Meet you in five,” said Clint.
Steve smiled, shaking his head. An expression he thought was lost on Matt.
“Is that really what your asking? Are you really willing to risk that?”
“In case we lose it. I don't want to be crowded with things that remind me of what I lost.”
“I believe Steve had a minor episode when he saw this." Jarvis pulled up the image. “Shit.”
“You gave up a full ride to Columbia,” said Tony.
“Is there anything I can do to make you more comfortable?” asked Jarvis.
“That’s what friends do for each other.”
"These may be of some help," said Tony, taking out Howard's notebooks.
“They must be paying legal interns more they were in my day. This is great compared to the closet I lived in Brooklyn. Even with the billboard,” said Steve.
“They are.”
"I'll watch her, Steve. Try and get some sleep."
When Bruce returned to the lab, Tony was on the couch with Piper asleep on his chest. Even with his beta nose, he could pick up on fading distress in the room.
“Do you want to discuss the whole name thing?”
Steve nodded. There was no getting out of this. He had to do this for the sake of his family.
“As sure as I can be.”
“I don’t know what I’d do without you. Not many are willing to jump off ninety-three story building to prove a point to me,” he said.
“I thought you dead,” he said.
“And where have you been? When have you been here for me, through this?” Tony’s voice was angry, yes, but hurt too.
“Nope this surprise,” said Tony.
"Anything else?" asked Tony.
*****
“No.”
"Pressuring me to pee isn't going to make it happen any sooner," said Steve. Them being just outside the door wasn't helping with his stress level. He finally managed to pee. Steve washed his hands, splashing some water on his face. He set the test on the kitchen counter. They watched as came up positive again.
“Done?”
Lena peered at the monitor and was met by Piper’s piercing glare. It was an open challenge to her authority She heard their entire conversation. Lena laughed.
January 2, 2013
Aunt Nat stood at the center of the large room, balanced perfectly on her toes. There no quiver of the legs. Classical music echoed through the room. Piper soon became entranced in the elegant movements. It wasn’t only the fluency of her motions, but the physics and math behind them. The sheer amount of pressure balanced on her toes was amazing. It wasn’t some dainty thing, but something that would require both intense mental and physical strength. She hadn’t realized how much she’d really longed for that till now. Piper was brought from her trance when the music stopped playing.
“I would have made breakfast, but I don’t know how to work the stove,” said Steve.
“And in how many times was he right?” asked Steve.
“Yes-
"Have you ever seen a metal armed man wandering around?"
“Listen to him, doc,” said Fury.
“Jarvis,” Steve whispered.
Tony hit a button on his keys. A holographic driver appeared in the front seat.
“Why aren’t you-
“He’s an ape.”
“I fully intend to enjoy the moment, with you,” said Tony.
He instantly relaxed, his breathing heavy.
“How did that feel?”
"I don't owe you that story."
"That's wonderful!” Turner gasped. “How is she?"
“I may have over exaggerated a bit,” she said.
“Why would they buy the cow if they get the milk for free?” said Steve.
"You look tired," said Steve.
“We’re fine here,” said Tony.
She pouted, but whatever they decided couldn’t be worse than what she’d already gone through. Piper knew their limits. Even if she pushed them to the brink, they’d never get physical with her. They could only take something away.
“On what?”
“You can say that,” said Tony.
"Why should that matter?!" yelled Steve.
“They accept Uncle Bruce…?” Since Papa and Daddy wouldn’t want her, maybe Bruce would. He’d understand. There was still someone who would accept her as she was.
“An intelligence organization that fears intelligence historically not awesome,” said Tony.
“Can he still be wiped?”
“To the family plot,” said Tony.
“You could have given me some warning,” he said.
“Aunt Peggy is having trouble with her stairlift. Told her I would take a look,” he said.
“What did you do to piss her off?” he asked.
“There is some good news,” said Tony.
“To be expected.”
Tony smirks as Steve falls back into the moment, before continuing. His mate whimpering and thrusting his hips down against his tongue. His finger joined his tongue, which was enough to coax out a release for his omega. He gentle pet Steve's stomach as he worked through the aftershocks. He could see Steve processing trying ration away how little they needed.
“La.”
"Next time you, go tell me you’re leaving. Don't leave without saying goodbye."
Steve collapsed. The figment of the memory bringing him down. Steve just laid there, unwilling to get up, but somehow mustering enough mental strength to stand. Slowly he dressed. He didn't want to go up to the penthouse. His chest was irritatingly tender. He had to go. The elevator stopped on their floor. Tony was running around with Piper above his head. She giggled when he tossed her into the air. Steve smiled. The brief happiness was replaced by guilt. He looked away.
Piper hesitantly followed Lena out of the room, waving goodbye to Winter. The alpha went to the window, watching her disappear down the hall. All he could do was wait.
“What about closure?” said Fury.
She whimpered. He went to the couch and pulled up the footage from the master bedroom. Steve was unconscious. Piper reached out for the image and whined. Piper eventually calmed enough to sleep. He put her into the playpen.
Tony came up to the penthouse and was caught up in the image of his mate.
He stopped by one of the drawers, pulling it open. Lingering on the lingerie tucked into the corner. He promised. It excited him. Maybe it would serve as a temporary distraction for Tony. He tucked a random set into his bag. When he went to the kitchen was struck by the smell of bacon. Steve hurled barely making it to the sink. Now he had to brush his teeth again.
“Done,” said Steve.
“Bruce will be here tomorrow to have a look at them,” said Tony.
“Let’s me decide what I need,” said Steve.
"You make me unsure. That bothers me in a way which might be fear. I don't know what it is to be scared. It's not something I'm allowed." Winter had had many handlers, but none of them affected him as she did. "Don't cry, that's not what I set out to do."
"I want to see her every month to document her progress," said Bruce.
“Who is she?” asked Tony.
“What is it?” asked Tony.
“Two hours,” repeated Steve.
"Steve?"
“PIPER!!” he screamed, slamming fists against the glass.
Steve got up from the floor, knuckles dusted with a dried spattering of blood. He hadn’t bothered with wrapping his hands. The faint sting was welcomed distraction. He went to showers and kept the water cold. He changed into clean clothes. Steve sighed. He would have to try to pull his husband away from the computer and get him to rest for at least an hour.
Piper woke up in a foreign space themed bedroom. She was in a space shuttle bed with Rune still asleep beside her. A solar system lighting feature spun around the room. It even had all seventy-nine of Jupiter's moons. Nodding off in chair was Daddy. He looks so tired. There were bags underneath his eyes.
“Tony."
“Has she now?”
“Eat.” He offered her the entire plate.
“I love you, sweetheart.”
That was all Rumlow wanted to know. He returned to his quarters to get some shuteye. A knock on his door hours later disrupted his rest.
“Thank you,” said Steve.
He nosed against Tony’s throat for support.
"Of course they did," he said with a roll of his eyes.
“I miss you. I wish you were." It was an impossible wish. “I’m sorry I couldn’t save you."
He'd screwed up. The threat had gone too far. He put in danger the security of his den and those that lived there. Tony went to the garage; he didn't try to get in through there. He took off his suit. It creaked and groaned as it tried transforming into a suitcase before it finally gave up. He grabbed a random set of keys and sped out the driveway. Steve needed to cool down. He drove into town, going to Steve’s favorite bakery, The CinnaMan. It was packed.
Piper and Rune heard them fighting outside. Maria and Pepper were doing the best to distract them. Piper crawled into one of the underground tubes beneath the playground, hoping it would help block them out.
“Mm, I somewhat. Each part has its purpose, however complicated it is. It's all rather exact. There’s nothing out of reason, compared to the life sciences.”
“Yes, sir,” repeated the suits.
“Sit down,” encouraged Edith.
The flight home was hellish. Steve locked himself away in the bathroom. Tony didn’t dare disturb him. That bathroom belonged to Steve. He took out his phone and pulled up the most recent stories. All the gossip magazines and several newspapers had his and Steve's wedding photos on the cover or front page. Steve came out of the bathroom. Tony showed him his phone. It earned him a tired smile.
“Mind telling me what that means?” he asked.
“What?”
“Really?”
Now that she thought about it, Papa did have some gray in his hair. How was that possible?
“We’ll get another chance,” said Tony, as if reading his mind.
“Ba."
Jeff tossed the child's clothing into a bag. Together they put on Winter’s multiple restraints.
"You've got her," said Tony. Steve nodded. "Hoping she'd be in a more conscious state of mind when she woke up."
“Unintentional, yes, but that doesn’t make it any less enjoyed,” said Tony.
“I hate this,” she said.
“I never thought of you that way. Howard was lust you are so much more,” said Steve.
“That can’t be right," said Tony
“Why Pepper has the business handled?” asked Happy.
Tony got out of bed and wheeled in the cart. The smell of food woke Steve up. It didn’t take long for him to finish off the order. Once done, he settled down by his mate. After that heavy meal, Steve would be out the rest of the day. He hoped that morning sickness wouldn’t ruin the day. Tony ran his hand over Steve’s stomach. The touch drew purr from the sleeping being.
“Fuck.”
“Of course, it is. I was directly involved,” said Tony.
"And the baby?" asked Steve.
That voice wasn't his mate's but it was safe. He whined.
"You'll have your hands full with her. She'll be beautiful. You'll have to swat the alphas off of her with a stick. Of course, I'll teach her some tricks to dealing with those silly alphas."
“I can find something!”
Their fingers entwined.
“How’s Piper?” A mention of Steve’s daughter was always a conversation starter.
“Why didn’t you throw it away?” he asked.
“I want to take a DNA sample from her,” said Bruce.
“Stay,” he said.
He paid for the toy and shoved it into his bag. In the garage, a motorcycle was waiting. The attached saddlebags were packed with everything he needed to complete his assignment. It was only nine miles to the target’s location. He put on his helmet.
“Have you started to slick?” she asked.
"Alright, boss."
“Fuck.” He forced back a growl. Fury wanted to question her. They could hardly get anything out of her, and they were her parents. Rune was willing to reveal parts of his experience but was tight-lipped about Piper.
“You’re asking if we had sex?”
“What was?” asked Steve. His mind was getting fuzzy.
“I don’t need them!”
"I would be happy to host Captain America a few more days." After heat, it took a few days for an omega’s hormones to calm. It was easier for them to work through it with the alpha they shared their heat with.
Steve woke hours later but wasn't ready to get out of bed. He reached out searching for his mate, but he wasn't there. Steve stretched out before getting out of bed. It was 10:30 pm. He went to his bag, taking out Tony's surprise. Steve put it on, enjoying how the feel of the lace against his skin. He got dressed.
“Piper has entered the muted stage of her and is now asleep. Sir is afraid of waking her,” said Jarvis.
He shook his head, not wanting to break the comfort of the moment.
He hadn’t slept this well for weeks. It was only due to his heat, but he would enjoy it while he could. Steve went to the large stainless steel fridge. It was filled with fruits, vegetables, meat, and eggs. He didn’t want to cook, but he popped a few blueberries in his mouth. Steve took out an apple. He lingered by the fridge, enjoying the feel of the cool air against his skin.
He wanted this tonight. They’d waited long enough for this. He wanted to be with his boyfriend but didn’t know how to start it. Steve bit his lip. Tony took something from under the tree.
“I told you not to cry.”
They were going to John Hopkins Hospital. Dr. Wu was mentoring there for a term. Jarvis already made a hotel reservation for them.
"Sorry, sir, sometimes it's impossible to tell with you," said Jarvis.
Steve blushed deeply.
Another set of explosions went off around them as Red Snapper crashed into a nearby structure.
"How?" asked Steve.
“Okay,” said Steve looking longingly at the bed.
They got out of the bed.
“No.”
He loosened his grip. “Sorry.”
“Most of my experiments don’t end in explosions. I’m better than that,” said Tony.
“I didn’t give permission. Where are they?” said Piper.
The dark didn’t hamper his vision in the least.
"My jet will take him wherever he wants. He can handle himself from there," said Tony.
“I’ll be needing my keys back, Piper,” said Fury. She scowled.
“I’m so sorry, Tony,” he whispered.
“It won’t.”
*****
"From what we can tell, this area can only be opened from the inside. Stark, could you crack it?"
“Mm.”
“How is searching for something that could lead to us finding Piper not good enough?!”
Piper ate quickly.
"It was a shower, and Jarvis was controlling the temp. I wasn't going to drown," said Piper.
“Lucky him. And you should shower before we get there you stink of him,” said Pepper.
Tony woke around 8:30. Steve’s side of the bed was empty. He probably went for a morning run. The smell of coffee lured him out of bed. He poured himself a mug. Tony went through fridge taking out last night leftovers. He took several bites before putting it back in the fridge. Steve came back an hour later. He seemed relaxed.
“I don’t know. There’s no logical reasoning behind it.”
"Sure."
“Look at me!”
“Are you hurt?” Winter enquired.
“What?”
She’d struggled to build an uneasy feeling of safety in the cell. That was all torn away in a moment by a simple nightmare. Winter brought her back to bed. Instead of returning to his corner, he remained next to her. She closed her eyes.
“Time to go to sleep little one.”
*****
“No, not if you’re going to hurt him.”
He followed Fury to a jet parked on the roof of the hotel. They took off.
Tony ran out the door. He called upon his nearest suit. It wrapped around him.
“You have Piper. And friends that love you deeply.”
His heart raced.
Edith took a breath she’d stopped the bleeding. This proved to be the most stressful procedure she'd performed. It wasn’t only the looming threat of what Stark would do to her if she failed. Keeping Steve under was a difficult. Every five minutes he started coming to, but they got him back under. If he’d woken up it would be the death of them. Steve full healing capabilities returned. He was recovering and showing signs of regaining consciousness. They had to get him back to his family before he woke up completely.
“Maybe it was me?” said Steve.
Piper looked between the two and pointed to the parrots, then smiled. It was a small distraction. Eventually, she would figure out that Steve was gone.
“My Aunt Peggy."
“What’s an Iron Man?” asked Steve.
“Steve and pup will be fine,” said Rhodes. He had no idea if that were true. But Steve survived worse.
"It was fascinating before we get to the pup. We should discuss what I discovered about Steve," said Bruce.
“Thanks.”
“Protecting your alpha,” said Clint.
“What will happen to Rune if I go?”
There couldn’t be a leak on his side. Otherwise, there’d be far worse consequences. He called Joseph. The bastard had the nerve not pick on the first ring.
Tony took Mark 5 from the passenger seat. Going into this unarmed was dangerous. He
He sat at the foot of their bed. Steve's arms wrapped around his waist. The omega's chin rested on his shoulder.
“How was it?” asked Natasha.
"I know where a copy might be. Well, half," said Steve.
The alpha rolled his eyes but Piper just stared back. She couldn’t prove her intelligence to him unless he opened up a little. The alpha shook his head moving to his corner. She wanted to help. When she entered his space he bared his teeth and growled. She backed away whimpering.
“Not until recently. There have been glitches with my programming.”
"Scent blockers?"
*****
"You aren't my omega! I loved you."
“We’ll figure it out,” said Tony.
Tony's hands clenched. “You’re going to come at me like that?”
“It’s fine,” he said.
Tony gritted his teeth. Hating the idea of waiting further. There had to be a good reason. Not dragging another family through the mud wasn’t enough for him. He didn't share as a strict moral compass of Steve. That’s exactly why he had to agree. He wanted to be able to look back at this moment a not feel ashamed when he told his daughter how they’d found. That it wasn’t at the possible at the expense of another. He wasn’t sure how long he would be able to follow that same path.
“He should be ninety-eight. Papa was stuck in a block of ice for seventy years. That's why he looks so young," said Piper.
"Thank you for saving us from the aliens," he said
“Can’t I at least try?”
January 21, 2016
“Tony.”
Steve hands fisted. They had to be okay. Thor was a god and Banner must have survived. The Hulk must have protected him. It had to. He looked at Tony.
Near the front door was a large oak tree with a tire swing. It was easy to imagine a life here. Is this where he would have lived if he survived? For the first time, the image of who he wanted to spend it with changed. He cut the bike’s engine and went to the large front door. Steve took a deep breath before knocking. It opened. He was caught in a tight hug. The power in those frail arms caught him off guard.
"Please take a seat, Steve."
Steve was battling the same issue. He wanted his pound of flesh. Control felt impossible in a situation like this. Their daughter had been stolen.
to read A few pages in and the pups were asleep. He closed the curtains to make sure the sun wouldn't come up and wake them.
“Already taking after you, Tony,” said Rhodes.
“Not here! You give up the Tesseract! You give up this poisonous dream! You come home,” Thor neared begged.
“Are you prepared, as you follow the path of marriage, to love and honor each other for as long as you both shall live?”
“No.”
“Jarvis placed the order.”
He looked down at his feet. How did Matt know he wasn’t wearing shoes?
“What the hell, Tony?!”
*****
“I should talk to her,” said Steve.
“If allowed,” agreed Winter.
The sorrow was real, but it didn't seem to be over this. "Can you tell me how you're feeling?"
"For the average omega 500, but you it's 2,000."
The guard threw some clothes for him.
“Then what happened?” echoed Steve.
"I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this," he said.
The idea was unappealing but he needed to store up calories so he could be ready for his alpha. He made several peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. From the fridge, he took two water bottles. Being this lethargic was so new to him. Before the serum, he was always on high alert and found it impossible to sleep. He managed to eat half of what he made before finally decided he was done. Then put the rest in the fridge. He went to their bedroom, crawling into his nest. He nuzzled Tony’s pillow, deeply breathing in the alpha's scent.  He hugged the pillow close to his chest. It wasn’t the same as holding his alpha, but it was the closest thing he had. He closed his eyes.
“If it's only an old storage unit why are we needed?” asked Steve.
“We can stay longer if you want, but another wave will hit,” said Tony.
“We pinky promise,” said Tony. Piper tentatively allowed them to wrap their pinkies with hers. Papa and Daddy had never broken a promise to her. She hoped it was a pattern she could rely on.
"I'm still angry with you."
“Love is for children. I owe the man a debt,” she said.
“Does this have anything to with you?” she asked.
“How old is he?” asked Steve.
"Pepper," said Steve. He'd never been so happy to see her. He wanted to know the plan. It would help him settle down.
She looked at him, expecting him to know. "Jarvis?"
*****
There was something unspoken between the two of them. It was too late now. He took the envelope from his pocket. Now was as good as any time. He took a breath before reading.
“I bet you could,” he said.
“Not worried, Piper. Only aware of your violent creativity. It would be foolish for me to underestimate it.”
“Everyone clear out!”
“Did something happen to Winter?”
“You were around when the mob was at its height,” said Tony.
"Sorry about that."
“Already in the making.”
“I will.”
“You need less sleep to function than the average human,” he said.
“Dr. Banner is in examination room three,” said Jarvis.
“I want to,” he said.
“That’s different. It isn’t his choice. You do it by choice.”
"So confident there will be a next time?"
The pups watched him leave.
There was a knock at the door. “Tony, are they awake.”
“You know that means nothing,” said Piper.
“Steve-
“Fine,” said Fury. He went to the elevator and was taken to the penthouse floor. The doors didn’t open.
“You didn’t have to do that,” said Steve.
*****
“Relatively little in the grand scheme of things. Several undercover operatives and a birth control diffuser,” she said.
“I’d be happy for you to try."
“Perfect,” said Tony.
“Enjoy your run?”
“They wouldn’t bring in people that would intentionally hurt us,” she said.
"It's difficult for me to go an hour without needing to fiddle with something. There hundreds of ideas going through my head. I have to act on it," said Tony.
His calculations were never wrong why hadn’t it exploded yet. Two hours later Steve came up the elevator to his lab. He wore a sweater, dark jeans, and winter boats. A black jacket was folded in his arms. His cheeks were pink from the cold.
"Piper, Rune, this wasn’t how I was planning on meeting you. I am Dr. Wong, but you can call me George if you want. I hope you allow me to meet you in person," he said.
“Why should I trust you with what’s in our head?” she asked.
Tony rubbed the sleep from his eyes. He needed a shower. Hopefully, the green giant wouldn’t mind babysitting for a little while longer. When he got to the penthouse he found Bruce laying on the floor running an intelligence test on Piper. She thought it was a game.
“It was good. What do you want to do now?"
Tony returned with Piper, placing her in his arms.
They didn’t want to leave their daughter’s side.
“Daddy, wake up!”
“What can you do?” What did he possess that could cause this level of damage to her when she was in such an overpowered state.
“How did they discover their location?” asked Becker.
“Papa will be okay."
"Tony."
"It was a good match," said Steve.
The AI unit hadn’t stopped pestering him on this. Every day Jarvis asked him the same question, multiple times.
"Please, Tony."
“The last time I was in Germany and saw a man standing above everybody else we ended up disagreeing,” he said.
“You’ll have to let go of me first.”
"Another contributing factor is your scent," said Barny.
, Tony’s fingers didn't
"Your company? Last time I checked, it's still called Stark Industries."
“Would you carry me to bed?” she asked.
“Seems like it,” said Steve.
He had to find Steve! That was all that mattered. If he’d taken the bike he could track him down.
“How bad is that?” asked Steve.
“Perfectly fine.”
An older alpha held a deadman’s switch in his hand. That clicking sound was the switch being activated. She growled at the alpha. His nose was straight and his graying hair was cut in a military-style. A thick perfectly trimmed mustache hung under his nose. Thought lines were carved deeply into his stern expression. He was dressed in military gear. Not a single hair seemed out of place. The only element of his appearance that broke with uniformity of his appearance were web-like burn clawing up his neck and side of his face. His dark brown eyes scanned over her. At first glance, they seemed almost kind but there was something cruel and calculating hidden behind them.
"No, Little Miss. It's still quite early. He won't be up for a few hours," said Jarvis.
He was shaking. Steve’s tight wet heat clenched around him. He was barely maintaining control. Instinct screamed for him to pound Steve into the mattress. He ran his fingers through hair. Slowly those muscles relaxed, allowing him to move forward. His thrusts were shallow. Steve’s soft whimpers transformed into pleasured purrs and gasps. Those long sturdy legs wrapped around him, pulling him deeper.
“It hurts here,” she said, putting her hand over her heart.
“How’s your hand?” asked Clint.
Piper woke a few hours later. She had no idea what time was. Her body clock was completely thrown off after so long in the cell. She slept at random hours or whenever the urge hit her. Piper yawned and stretched out. Her eyes widen when she saw the scratched out image of Papa’s shield. She whimpered running fingers over what was left of it.
The alpha stalked toward him. His posture straightened making him seem larger. The man held his head high. The powerful dominance of his scent made Steve shiver. A low snarl echoed from the alpha’s throat. He forced himself to keep the alpha gaze. His inner omega screamed at him to bare his neck. Tony wanted to set him off by using alpha male tactics. His back hit the wall Tony’s form framed him in. It pissed him off how much he wanted to give in. He hated this barbaric alpha posturing!
It had always been the plan for Tony to go ahead.
He picked them up, balancing one on each hip. Steve carried them upstairs, tucking them into Piper's bed. He took a random book from the shelf
“What is it?” she asked.
"Is that a good or a bad thing?" asked Winter. Something as petty as the girl winning could mean trouble.
“What do you want to drink?”
“And your combat skills?”
The secretary nearly spilled her coffee when she saw them. “Dr. Wu will be you shortly. He’s currently with a student.”
"Room service."
“Where?”

“Well, it’s silly,” she said.
“And you’re the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen.” Vigilantes kept popping up after Battle of New York. The Devil of Hell’s Kitchen had lasted the longest.
Gunfire clinked off his armor. He was forced to manually engage the weapon system. Throwing the weaponized capsule, setting it off with a blast. “That’s two.”
Steve caught the scent of another alpha in the room.

“Yes, all in moderation. Even with proportion, you have to consume it will be fine,” said Jarvis.
It was an impossible dream that she’d given up years ago. That kind of domestic life wasn’t available. She could experience it through Clint. That was enough.
Steve nodded.
“Four in the afternoon."
"No, sir. I'll start searching camera feeds."
"Bedroom," gasped Steve.
“It’s not much, but it was enough for me,” said Steve.
“I’m turning into an old man," muttered Tony.
Tony blasted at the device. His attack was sent back at him.

“I wasn’t expecting to see you so soon after our last visit."
“We are going to the Andes Mountain Range. Our target area is Colca Canyon. That’s all the information in an insecure area,” she said.
“Our weddings last a week on average. A celebration of new bonds, love, family, and drinking. My parents' wedding lasted two the whole kingdom was invited,” said Thor.
"Then what's the issue?"
“How can you say that?”
“Don’t roll your eyes at us, young lady,” said warned Tony.
Steve was too tired to argue. He went into the kitchen and grabbed a water bottle.
A dazzling blue light broke through the endless strike of his torture. The pup was glowing.
“Who was she?” asked Pepper.
He brought Piper to his lab. Dum-E and U came rolling over to them. The two bots study her with fascination. She squirmed in his hold trying to reach the mechanical arms.
“Sir, Steve does not take kindly to me scanning him without permission," said Jarvis.
“Lead the way, Director Fury.”
"A few weeks after she went missing. I knew we would find her and that we’d need somewhere private for her to recover. We'll be safe there," assured Tony.
Compsognathus - is a genus of small, bipedal, carnivorous theropod dinosaur. Members of its single species Compsognathus could grow to around the size of a turkey. They lived about 150 million years ago, during the Tithonian age of the late Jurassic period.

June 10, 2016
Winter was on him in an instant, pressing a knife to his throat.
“He was out of his league. He should have waited for a way out,” said Tony.
Steve's posture straightened as Nat’s team entered. Hill opened a folder and spread out thermal pictures of an underground facility. It was a maze of halls, dead ends, and easy ambush zones. A logistical nightmare. They were at a disadvantage. The enemy’s numbers were unknown.
“I have a call to make,” he said.
“You trust me to do that?” asked Piper.
“Steve?”
War wasn’t what needed to be on his mind.
“Today is the big day.”
“And I understand, but it-
“Give them 150 million,” said Tony.
"You can sleep, Steve. I will wake you up when they get there," said Happy.
“Two actually,” said Steve.
“Amazing, he didn’t even question you,” said Pepper.
“You aren’t the only one."
“Stressed but fine,” said Pepper.
“Sorry to keep you waiting,” said Steve.
Whining broke Tony from his sleep hours later. Steve had thrown off the blankets and was completely bare. The shirt he once wore was tossed on the floor. A sheen of sweat covered his pale skin. He was panting heavily. His scent was even more enticing. Tony licked his lips.
He nodded. Tony slowly pulled his hand away.
“I thought we could leave it at his grave,” he said.
"In a day? You think I can
"Breakfast first."
"I do."
“You won’t tell me your name, so I’ll have to give you one. What about Fluffy?”
"I was distracted. My mind should have been with you."
“Give it a try.”
"I loved hearing how deeply you were enjoying yourself." Everyone in their vicinity would know Steve was his.
"No, why would I?"
Steve took her. He tensed when she nuzzled against him. Steve shook his head as his feral side threatened to take over. He was too tired to fight it.
"Hey, what is it, baby girl?"
Her vision cleared after a few blinks. Daddy and Papa were staring at her. They looked happy but really tired. Their eyes were watery.
“That long do you know what the press will think?” said Pepper.
At five they put on the Andy Griffith Show.
She hugged the little girl tightly. “I missed you so much.”
She growled and bared her teeth. Steve’s heart broke. She’d never growled, let alone bared her teeth at him. Piper was protecting the soldier.
“How is it?” asked Piper.
He needed a distraction. Steve searched the ship, seeing if there was anything to Tony's suspicions.
Breakfast sounded good. He always had room to eat. He went to the café, filled a tray with food. The only other thing he had to do today was meet with Dr. Turner. When he finished, he went to Turner’s office. The beta was in his always-relaxed state. He took a seat on the cushy leather couch.
She nodded. Tony read, gently swaying back forth in the chair. As he did, she silently mouthed the words but stopped in favor of sucking her thumb. Her eyes were dropping at the end of
Piper went to Winter. "You okay?"
“Do you need to do anything?”
The marbled cracked under Steve's strength. He took a breath, trying to remember Rhodes' warning.
Carl looked away from her pizza. “I don’t know I’ll ask my mommy when she gets home.”
“I didn’t say anything about weapons,” he said.
"It was cute," said Rhodes.
He returned to his room packing the few things he had. Steve hid Howard’s letter. It would be wrong to take it. He locked the door of his apartment.
“Probably to talk about me,” said Piper.
"How about this? If you go, you can choose any car you like and we’ll rebuild it together?" said Daddy.
“Go to your mate. I’ll take care of her.”
"Think of Steve."
Steve scowled. They had ten days until his heat.  Since his last heat was cut short it would be intense.
“If you’re having cold feet I can plan an escape route,” said Natasha.
“Can you still see straight?”
“There’s no convincing you to let him go,” said Happy.
“Are you alone?”
Winter woke up, feral state dominating his mind. The entire room had been scrubbed clean. It smelled heavily of bleach. The symbols on the ground were gone. The pup was curled up in the corner. He sniffed her. The drug was still coursing through her system. Since she was so small, its effects would last longer.
“Could you talk with her? I’m sure Piper would love to see you.”
“I was wondering if you could do me a favor?
“It was a lot on my senses. I’m fine now,” said Steve.
“Who are you, Tony Stark?”
Emergency services came rushing to the destruction. Reporters would be there soon. Paramedics hurried around him and Maya. He wasn't letting the woman out of his sight. He was currently being looked over in the back of an ambulance.
Steve nodded and went to grab the beta. Tony could do this. The alpha disappeared. Steve helped the woman up, heading toward the door. They crashed through the glass door, tumbling onto the ground. The rest of the structure began to collapse.
Fury left quietly, closing the door behind him, and smiled to himself.
“Remember, you can’t have raw fish, deli meat, high mercury fish, or unpasteurized dairy products, and absolutely no alcohol,” said Edith. Steve nodded. “Oh, and you should know, it’s perfectly safe to have sex while pregnant,” she said.
“What about Rune?” asked Maria.
“I did promise to watch the Wizard of Oz with you. Now seems as good as any time,” said Steve.
"She'll be fine," said Bruce.
"If it were my kid, nothing could stop me. It would be impossible to stop them," said Clint.
“You don’t remember?”
"I have to make breakfast," said Steve.
“Tony.”
“Even that state, I recognized that symbol. You didn't make much of an attempt to hide it from me."
“You have an assignment.”
Walter Cronkite – was actually a radio reporter in WWII that focused on battles in Europe and North Africa. This served as the foundation of a long career as a reporter.
“The kid that bullies you at school. What his name?”
“Hey, what is it?” The omega’s kind expression was tense in deep thought. There was such stress in his form.
He gave a small nod of acknowledgment. She couldn't say good morning. It wasn't. “Good morning” would be waking up at home to the smell of her parents making breakfast. She wanted to cry but she had no more tears left.
“He won’t be happy you left without saying goodbye in person, but I’ll pass along the message.”
“Does he speak?”
Steve looked at his watch. Five, he’d hit rush hour traffic.
“Night, night, Papa.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The pup apologized too much. It was a bothersome trait, but it was better than the crying. He hated it when she cried. It left him helpless on how to deal with it.
He meant her gaze.
Sir left the class returning with a tray of food. He placed it on her desk. She’d never eaten in the classroom before. Normally she shared her meals with Winter. Sir ate his lunch at his desk. Her nose crinkled at the smell of banana and Fig Newtons. If he wanted cookies actually eat a cookie.
“You’re a monster,” she said, her voice quivering.
"Last night, what happened?" asked Steve. He thought back to the night, but nothing came forward.
A powerful blast sent Steve’s cage slamming into the wall. The glass door cracked. He slammed his feet against it, shattering it completely. He crawled out. His shield skidded next to him.
At least the agent hoped his hero would. The captain currently seemed to be in a deep trance-like state of thought. Coulson didn’t dare to disturb him. He would have to report this to Dr. Turner. Phil left Steve in his room.
“No,” said Steve.
“Are you going to call that nurse?” asked Natasha, spotting the number on his hand.
Tony got up from his place beside Steve. Steve sighed, frustrated with himself. Maybe Tony could have found this sooner if he hadn’t been so caught up in his own grief.
“What?” asked Rune.
There had to be more reason than that. She wouldn’t have fought unless she had to. Rune was innocent in all this. He was another pawn in the game.
Even once the blood was cleaned away, he smelled it on her. It stained the pup's gentle lavender honey scent. He dressed her with clothes he found in the bureau and set her in bed, pulling the blankets over her. Winter went to the bathroom, checking his reflection. The image staring back at him was nothing new. He got into the shower. The water badly stung his battered body, but he needed to get clean.
“Yes, that’s me my name is Iris Oblonsky," she said.
“I don’t wanna talk to you.”
“The house party protocol, sir?”
“Papa, hungry.”
The scent of fresh slick made Tony licked his lips. He sniffed Steve’s neck. The omega wasn’t there yet. Steve whined, clearly unsatisfied at the level of attention he was receiving. Tony pulled a blanket over them. Those azure were focused on him, staring at him with such admiration. This was his omega no other would do. They shared gentle kisses and nuzzles. He purred, easing the omega into sleep.
"Steve, we need you to go over mission plans."
“You’re giving me a choice.”
“That’s very cynical,” said Bloom.
Steve didn’t pry. There were very good reasons for Natasha wanting to keep her private life a secret.
“It was soft,” he said.
"No, thank you," she said.
“More than,” huffed Steve. He was itching for it.
territory. Winter pushed the pup into the corner where it was safer.
“Another rough night?” asked Tony.
Commitment wasn't an easy topic to approach with Tony, at least of this magnitude. This wasn’t something as simple as moving in.
“Hurry,” whimpered Steve.
“Being angry doesn’t mean you can hurt people,” said Steve.
"He should be," said Maria.
Steve blushed. “You owe me ten bucks.”
“A birthday present from Thor.”
Steve's pupils retracted to normal size. He bit down on a pillow, trying to hide his agony. His form quaked with deep pain. He writhed. Never in his life had he felt anything like. His muscles contorted angrily against him.
“Thor please take Loki back to jet where you can continue to keep an eye over your brother while we make our way to the helicarrier, so together we can figure out to handle him. Tony and I will be following behind, so we’ll know if you stray. Is that agreeable to you?” asked Steve.
“He’s a bit testy. It's normal for omegas to be defensive. We've each gotten our share black eyes and unintentional kicks from omegas in labor, with Steve, it poses a bit more of a threat," said Edith.
“Can’t tell you."
Steve followed the doctor into a private patient room. Tony was asleep. He went to his mate’s side and ran his fingers through Tony’s hair. Tony’s deep brown eyes slowly opened.
"That's when he was working." Rumlow “Why would she come here?”
Tony led him inside and up the grand staircase. They stopped in front of the first guest bedroom. Steve circled the checking for anything that could pose a risk.
“We’re taking a walk.”
It faded from her lips.
“Humor me.”
“Jarvis, calculate his heat,” said Tony.
"Yeah, they thought I'd be too weak."
She nodded, taking a seat beside him on his side of the bed.
“Hello?” Steve kept his voice a whisper, not wanting to further disturb Tony.
Rune stared at the omega. He was even taller, standing up.
“I’m one of the top ER doctors in the U.S. your boyfriend is lucky to have me,” said Blackwell.
“I promise you I never thought of you as a replacement for him. Do you believe me?” he asked. The silence between them seemed to last forever.
He pushed a small box wrapped in red and white paper toward his husband. Steve carefully unwrapped it. Tony twitched. It was a present it was meant to be ripped open. Finally, he took off the lid.
“You always have the best stories.”
, what if he was having an episode or had gone feral! He had to find him! Tony got into his suit. Steve would likely go to Brooklyn. He took to the air.
The spring was a bit rusty, but everything else would make due. He quickly unwrapped the sandwich.
“Yes.”
Piper sat at her desk, waiting for permission to leave. Lena took Piper's notebook, flipping through the pages. The girl's doodles weren't doodles at all. They were blueprints. She was trying to figure out the mechanics of Winter's arms. So far, Lena hadn't gone into the subjects of mechanics or engineering. It wasn't something she was interested in. They were the carpentry of the sciences. She found it rather dull.
“JARVIS!”
"According to my information, he's alive. I wouldn't provide you with false intel," said Jarvis.
“Show to me,” said Fury.
“What happens to you? What happens if you go too hot?” she said, backing up the stairs toward the exit.
Alpha was pulling away! He grabbed the alpha's jacket, keeping him close. A growl, almost leaving his throat. His eyes widened. Tony was smirking playfully. He pulled his hands away.
“Find a comfortable position or you’re sleeping on the couch."
“Yeah, divide and concur it’s great. He knows he has to take us out to win right? That’s what he wants. He wants to beat us and he wants to be seen doing it. He wants an audience,” said Tony.
“Give me, Jarvis.”
“Contact Banner, tell him to come to New York. And make the necessary arrangements.”
“Sadly, yes,” said Steve.
Steve was at loss for words.
“I play next.”
Steve nodded.
“It’s nothing really,” said Steve. He quickly cleaned up the mess.
“Nervous,” he said.
“What’s wrong?” He wanted to help, do good by the pup.
"How can I be sure of this? What if my omega is acting up?" said Steve.
Tony would have enjoyed hearing that more if it didn't involve something as important as his family.
"I've seen men lost to the bottle."
“You think yourself above them,” said Thor.
Steve laughed.
He was tackled to the ground by ten of the men. Steve fought against them. Their glowing bodies struggled to keep him pinned. Contact with their skin burned. His arms were pinned behind.
“There's nothing wrong with wanting more; you have to be realistic. Stark isn’t the easiest person to build a connection with, but unlike so many who share your crush. You stand a chance. It’s clearly not one-sided,” she said.
She also did not share the same enthusiasm over the results of Rune and Piper's fight. While fighting, Piper hadn't shown the indifferent nature Lena had wanted. Too much of the girl's personality came through. That would have to be dealt with before it became a larger problem.
“If you can’t, I’ll take him from you,” said Fury.
Tony pulled away to kiss across Steve’s jaw, tugging the omega’s hair lightly. He ran his teeth against that perfect neck, so willingly exposed to him. His arousal throbbed when Steve arched from the as he mercilessly stroked the omega’s sweet spot.
Later in the morning, Lena forced herself from the comfort of her husband’s arms. She went to the kitchen to start breakfast. That's where she broke the news that she had to leave. Carl went into tears. She held him for an hour until he got it out of his system. He slowly pulled away from her shirt.
"Harder," panted Steve.
“Eat.”
"What's wrong?"
*****
“Was he good to you?” he asked.
"And you had Peggy."
“He’s on assignment.”
“Yes, sir,” said the suit of armor.
“No.”
"You'll have to open it and find out,"
“I already memorized all the stuff in them,” said Piper.
When he entered the bedroom, he saw Steve was huddled under the blankets. Tony pulled down the covers slightly, placing a gentle kiss on Steve’s forehead, before laying down on top the duvet and wrapping his arms around the omega. Steve had bad days that extend could into a bad week. All he had to do was wait it out. He couldn’t fall back to sleep even with the omega in his arms. Tony carefully carded his fingers through Steve’s hair earning a sleepy purr. An hour later, Steve woke up.
“It was Tony!” Steve pushed away from the comforting embrace and stood, instantly stepping on one of the Legos hidden in the carpet.
“She has to.” There was no way she couldn’t know how much they missed her. How much they loved her. Tony had been sure not to withhold his emotions as Howard had done. He told Piper every day that he loved her.
“Back off!”
Tony pulled away from him. Steve sat up. He rested his head against Tony’s chest. Steve sighed as Tony’s fingers carded through his hair. Blush still burned at his cheeks.
The air grew cooler. Steve yawned. He fell asleep on the couch, watching Blue Planet.
*****
“He’s all you expect from Captain America. I remember your dad telling us stories about him. Never thought I'd meet the man. The photos don’t do him justice,” said Rhodes.
“I like an omega with an appetite. It’s healthy,” said Thor.
“We have at least an hour before it hits again," said Tony.
“I want my alpha,” said Steve before fading into unconsciousness.
“Shouldn’t he be doing something?” asked Rune.
“Of course, Sir."
“I may be old, but I still have my sources,” said Peggy.
“Was he married?” asked Steve. He felt guilty for having to ask. With all the time he spent with Phil he never truly got to know much about him.
Thor nodded. He sparred a glance of blue-eyed omega. A fierce warrior indeed, there were too few omegas that were brave enough to stand against two alphas in mid-fight.
The only period of silence he was granted was when Piper ate. He could stay up for days at a time with ease working on a project, but that was different. He didn't have a crying pup breaking his concentration.
“No one is okay here,” said Rune.
“So you’re saying that the Hulk, the other guy, saved my life? That’s nice. It’s a nice sentiment. Save it for what?” asked Bruce. In the beginning, he'd died, instead of cursing him with the green beast. Those dark thoughts decreased but they were still present.
"Hey, sweetheart. Are you hungry?"
“What were you doing to make you smile like that?” asked Tony.
“Yes,” said Tony.
“I’ll take him to S.H.I.E.L.D. custody and then met you for shawarma. Whatever delicacy maybe,” he said before flying out the window with Loki.
The pup crawled out of bed dragging the blankets with her. She climbed into his lap, huddling closely to him. The pup hid her face in his chest. He wrapped her in the blankets, cradling her in his functioning arm.
"How would dying do that?"
“Oh.”
"I’ll get started on that right away,” said Pepper. She laughed to herself as she left. Steve was having a good influence on Tony. She usually had to beg for him to give to museums. Even then, the amount never reached the multimillions.
"Hey, Nat."
“How long was I asleep?” asked Steve, rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
“What if she disappears?” asked Rune.
“Any car?”
“He’s seen me in worst states of undress,” said Tony.
“Not every attack is about you!”
“Wherever you and Tony go, a flock of press follows. I don’t want to scare her off,” said Natasha.
Piper watched as Winter shook. Lena had some kind of control over him, and he was straining against it.
“Not wrong different,” he said.
“You’re still as beautiful as the day I first saw you,” he said.
It was an understatement. His inner omega was verging on haywire. He had to get out of here. An agent came running through the doors.
“I know,” said Tony.
“I believe she was scared," said Jarvis.
“I think that my boss is working for the Mandarin,” she said.
"I would have remembered that." Piper believed him. Rune would gain nothing from lying. He seemed equally curious about her.
“Easy.”
“It isn’t you,” said Tony.
Tony smiled. “You said home.”
“Are you ready to talk yet?” asked Tony.
"Are they any child phycologists you'd recommend?"
Tears were streaming down his face. His muscles were tensed, and his fists were clenched. He had a white-knuckle grip on the bedsheets. Tony couldn’t let Steve suffer.
“I don’t know. Whoever’s left,” said Natasha.
. It couldn’t be. She slowed and lowered her stance when the sounds of struggle became clear. There was Papa’s scent again. He was fighting Winter. She didn’t know what to do. Her gaze locked onto one of Sir’s men. He had a gun aimed at Winter.
"It's that simple," said Steve. He tried to smother his jealousy. Their lives were isolating enough and he refused to begrudge his mate and his child the kinship born of mutual understanding. He had his own unique bond with Piper, he reminded himself.
“Refused to sleep with her,” said Steve.
"We're safe together," said Steve.
Tony cringed as the red-headed omega appeared in the elevator. She stormed toward him, her heels clanking angrily against the floor.
“Piper, you are very special, but you aren’t the only special subject here. Compared to some here, you’re actually rather regular.”
“I won’t.” Piper promised herself. “Can I go?”
“Of course Mr. Stark,” she said.
“We have to call in a science team to clean up this mess,” said Clint.
“I assure you nothing inappropriate has occurred,” said Jarvis.
. She made the last cut flinching. Nothing happened. They were safe. Her hands shook as she went for the clasp and unsnapped it.
Rune jumped from bed when the door of his room suddenly opened. He took a defensive stance. Baring his teeth.
“It won’t help.”
“Where are your parents?”
Steve nodded. They pulled up to the tower. He took the bag from the back seat. Steve took a breath before leaving the car. He stared up at the tower. It wasn’t too late to turn back. No, he would regret not talking with Tony. Steve went to the elevator and hit the button for the penthouse floor.
“Shh, it’s alright beautiful.”
"We found a partial print on remains from the explosives and ran it through our data banks. There wasn't much hope for finding a match since it was so small."
"Does he look like he's in any state to handle this. He’s a pregnant omega in shock.”
Steve gave a curt nod.
“Jarvis put an order for four large pizzas,” he said.
"It would have been better if you were there," said Steve.
“And you’re all about style aren’t you?” he said.
"Why?" asked Harley.
“832 miles,” he said.
“He’s here,” said Phil.
Steve smiled before walking away. He went to the elevator, turning red when memories of their time there came back. Heat warmed his cheeks. Would he ever be able to enter this elevator without thinking of that moment? He went into the master bathroom and got in the shower. Jarvis set it to the perfect temp. Opening the lavender-scented body wash, he soaped up. Tony only bought lavender soaps. The alpha loved how it complimented Steve’s natural scent. Steve soaked under the hot spray, running his hand lovingly over his stomach, and purred. It was only blood family he had. He prayed his pup's family would include Tony.
“Piper, get away from him.”
Steve nodded.
“Rhodey.”
“Five minutes and I call this,” he said.
“Piper, this is your Uncle Rhodey.”
Piper bit her lip, trying not to let her fear reach overwhelming levels. It was impossible to push it away. Winter was out there and likely contributing to the carnage. She shifted closer to Rune, trying to gain some comfort from his closeness.
Tony groaned. The last time he watched Dora the Explorer that damn theme song was stuck in his head for days. “Please anything else? Like Sesame Street or Bob the Builder?”
Steve blushed. His heart raced. He wanted that. That was baser part of him. It was something he couldn't have. He tried before. But what was the harm in fantasing? Tony kept him tucked protectively close. For hours they remained. He whined when Tony pulled away.
The radio breached the silence between them. It was the only element of Steve’s attention.
Tensing was all she could do. She was at his mercy. Her heart drummed in her ears when the blade pressed against the delicate skin of her neck. Piper took a breath. He couldn't kill her. This was nothing more than a scare tactic. She did what she thought would annoy him most: she smiled.
"He'll land in the Tokyo airport in ten hours and fifteen minutes," said Jarvis.
Tears started forming in those clear blue eyes.
The alpha’s mind was a haze. A powerful instinct to place his claim mark on the omega was overwhelming, but something stopped him from following through. He deeply inhaled the omega’s intoxicating scent.
"Not on my ship," said Fury.
Steve desperately clutched the alpha. The catch of Tony’s knot had him seeing white. All words beyond alpha disappeared from his vocabulary. He needed the alpha’s teeth in his neck, creating their bond. Steve hadn’t needed anything like this in life.
“Do you want to talk about it?” asked Tony.
“Is everything ready?” asked Peggy.
Steve handed her over. The lack of hesitation caught Bruce off guard. Omegas were extremely protective over their pups, even more so in the first few weeks of life. So Steve giving over Piper, knowing full well what he was it came as a shocker. She stared up at him. There was something to those eyes. They were insightful like she was studying him. She smiled and tried reaching out to him.
Tony went to the media room. Steve paused the movie explaining something to Thor. The possessive instinct wasn’t as powerful he thought. His bond gave him full trust in his mate, which dulled the urge.
Killian walked past Maya without even a second glance. Tony was left with the dying beta. He thrashed against his restraints. She didn't deserve this. Her skin became a sickly pale as the blood puddle around her grew.
Steve showered and dressed. He waited by the entrance for Tony. As always he came speeding into the driveway. Steve smiled, getting into the car. He kissed Tony as got into the car. They raced off in the direction of home. Steve had finally gotten used to Tony’s driving.
"No, thanks for notifying us," said Phil.
“Our bond, when it was made some of the side effects of the serum must have been passed on. Well, that’s the theory. This isn’t my field of expertise. I’ll ask Banner about it,” said Tony.
“I'm flattered and all, but why the hell did you choose me? Besides the obvious reasons, of course. I’m sure alphas are lining up to have a chance with you,” said Tony.
"I know, I know, no sugar in the morning."
“Jarvis.”
He forced it open. The door groaned and creaked under his strength. The room was filled with large stainless steel crates. He jumped onto the catwalk above.
“I thought you were sleeping,” he said.
“This must be difficult for you,” said Phil.
"Ten minutes."
He turned red, forgetting the alpha behind that earned the reaction. Steve pulled away. Wincing at the separation.
She nodded.
“Want me to massage your back?” he asked.
Tony wrapped his arm around Steve’s waist bringing him into a deep kiss. The crowd went into a cheer. They went down the archway of swords. The new couple took shelter inside the mansion. They didn't get much peace. While their guests were enjoying the cocktail hour they were doing wedding photos with the rest of the wedding party. When the photos were done they had a few minutes left before they had to go back out.
“My name is Piper Sarah Margret Stark. My friends call me, Pipes. You can call me that if you want.”
“That’s what I meant, Piper,” she said.
“And I thought Papa’s sense of humor was dry,” Piper scoffed, good-naturedly.
“What?” asked Steve.
"Battle, I don't know where or when but I knew that much. It was dark. All I could hear was shell fire," he said.
Steve went into the kitchen where Piper was waiting at the counter. He made toast and cheesy scrambled eggs. Steve handed her a plate.
“No, Steve. What we had has been over for some time now. It’s difficult seeing him move on. Reminds me how lonely I am,” she said.
“I promise.”
"We've done all we can for it," said Tony. It must be such a shock to Steve. He only knew the young Peggy, while Tony was there to watch the steady decline. Tony gave into his alpha instinct to comfort, hugging Steve. The omega was quick to react, accepting the comfort. They stayed like that for a while. “So what did Aunt Peg tell you?”
*****
“Told you I could do it,” she said closing up his arm.
"Hey, Pepper. What do you want?"
“Steve, ready to go?” asked Tony.
"You'll see soon enough."
“Yeah.”
"Get the phone."
"Healing their wounds were easy, but their minds proved to be a more difficult task. Many came back, different people. I hope I’ll be able to help you like I have so many others,” said Barny.
Winter sighed in relief. Her expression had changed. This was the happiest she'd been in days. She’d been quiet, hardly moving. It was unusual. Normally, she’d pace, fiddle with something, play with her fingers. The stillness was her adapting to her new settings. As much as he disliked the change, it was needed for her to survive.
“You won’t think it’s fun when you have to explain it to me,” said Steve.
“You’re not getting rid of me that easily!” hissed Pepper.
“Steve." The omega paused briefly, not looking back at him briefly before going to the showers.
A few hours ticked by. Conversation broke the comfortable silence every now and then.
“Where have you been? It's been a week.”
“TONY!”
Steve quickly kissed him.
“Ready?” asked Tony.
“Jarvis, get the bath ready."
"Shut up!"
“I can’t.”
“Can you at least pretend to be nice?” said Steve.
“Why do you got to do that?” asked Rune.
They went into a training room. A beautiful woman stood on a blue mat in the center of the room. She had short red hair and blue-green eyes. When he came closer, he realized she was an omega. She emitted an aura of power.
Steve stared at the screen in utter disbelief.
“We’ll have to start wedding planning,” said Tony.
“Tony,” he sighed. He began purring, nuzzling into his pillow. A small smile graced his lips. She would let him enjoy himself. Natasha left for the café.
"You were trying to assert your dominance over him," she said.
“My omega."
An extremely cute image of a five-year-old caught his focus. He had a button nose and deep brown eyes. His hair was light honey brown hair. He had a clever familiar smile.
“What about Piper?”
“What’s the history between you and Rumlow?” asked Tony.
"Tap it twice."
"Open your eyes."
Grasp Reflex - A baby will grasp a finger or object when it is placed in the palm of her hand. This reflex is strongest during the first 2 months and usually fades by 5-6 months.
“I’m not sure if I want to know the answer, but I need to,” said Steve.
“I wish you would take a moment to rest,” said Jarvis.
“Steve we can’t. I can’t. I’m not saying this guilt trip you, but my heart can’t take it. That’s not me being romantic. Literally, the strain of not being together through will damage my heart beyond repair.”
“Make sure you come to bed sometime tonight,” said Steve.
“What if she doesn’t get along with the next one or the one after that?” said Steve.
"I'm here for both of you. I always will be," said Tony raising Steve's chin. He wouldn't run for this responsibility. Tony wanted it.
"Amazing huh? It's nothing compare the man that brought you into the world. He's already done so much for you."
“Do you really want me to shut up?”
“If you hurry, I may let you join me,” he said before leaving.
“Stay in here as long as you’d like, sweetie.” She watched as Daddy struggled to crawl out of the tube.
“He’s fine, sir. He’s currently eating ice cream on the couch,” said Jarvis.
Three bottles of wine later, they were almost done but managed to pick one. A choice made of obligation more than anything. He wasn't sure what he was meant to be feeling as they looked through the photos. Steve managed to relax on his military stance slightly.
“Yes, that poor, girl. I can’t imagine what her parents are going through,” said Lena.
"You are pregnant, according to my scanners. I assure they are correct."
Piper shrugged, not pressing.
Steve relaxed. His body was working with him to protect his baby. It was probably the reason the pup survived the Battle of New York.
“Why do you think that is?” asked Barny.
"How do we use it?" asked Rune, having the same dilemma.
“I asked one thing, Tony! Don't drag us into this. And that's exactly what you did!"
“I went feral,” said Steve.
“Gentlemen, you might want to step inside in a minute. It’s going to get a little hard to breathe,” said Natasha.
The doorbell rang, breaking the conversation. “Go to the media room, Piper.”
Everything about Tony was so sincere. He couldn’t find judgment in those dark brown eyes. Steve hugged him. Tony’s arms wrapped firmly around his waist. He melted into the embrace, realizing how much he missed the alpha's touch. They were slow to separate. An awkward silence built between the two of them neither of them knowing what to do next. Thankfully, Tony broke it.
“Piper.” Lena wanted the pup’s acknowledgment – she already had the pup’s attention.
“You have to deal with this. I will not say I understand what you’re going through-”
“You have no idea what you are dealing with,” said Thor.
“I hope.”
Raised voices woke Steve. He broke from the warmth of his bed. The scent of another omega touched his senses. It was floral and sweet. He was growling. Unlike other omegas, his snarl was low, resembling that of an alpha’s. Steve covered his mouth. This possessive urge was only due to his heat. It wasn’t his place to interfere. Tony wasn't his alpha, no matter how much his omega wanted him to be.
Steve whined. He pressed his back against the wall. Closing his eyes in shame as slick leaked from between his legs. It didn't help that there was a virile aroused alpha so close.
“You couldn’t have known.”
“Hmm.”
"Where is the prisoner now?" asked Steve.
“Go ahead open it,” he said.
“Hungry.”
She shook her head.
He couldn’t be dependent on another just to sleep. Maybe Barny would have a solution. He knocked on the door of the doctor’s office.
“I believe the sooner, the better, but I can understand if you have reservations. Mr. Stark and I have already informed the S.H.I.E.L.D agents that will be keeping watch.”
“There’s nothing like an Asgardian wedding.”
“I thought the same thing once. But it only hurt myself and the people I loved."
“You have?” he said.
Their lips met in a slow undemanding kiss that eased them in them into the passion awaiting them. Soon he goes pliant in his arms, opening for more gentle kisses. Letting Steve return or break the kiss as needed.
“You’ll need something better than that,” said Tony to Clint.
“Hopefully, your confidence is well placed, Zemo. For your sake and theirs,” said Pierce.
“Monster?”
“Your performance? Where people died.”
“Don’t tell me how to speak. You can’t take that away from me, too.”
“Feeling better, beautiful.”
“How?” asked Happy.
They met with the others to the designated area. Loki was in chains and muzzled. Steve watched as Banner transferred the cube into Thor’s possession. If he never saw the cube again it would be too soon. Thor nodded goodbye, before disappearing into a blue light. They said their goodbyes to each other.
“So this isn’t a waste.”
“It’s an improvement over War Machine,” said Steve.
Their room was beautiful.
“Tony?”
“Sleep!” he ordered.
Steve got the idea that ruthless wasn’t only describing Neema’s work ethic.
“In a way,” she said with a smirk.
Steve went for his shield.
“Tony Stark is in my van.”
“Ready to go, Cap,” said Natasha.
"It was damaged during a mission."
Tony pulled Steve into a deep kiss, stealing the omega’s breath. He slowly pulled away, touching their foreheads.
"Only water," he said, then tested the water, making sure it wasn't too hot. He took her hand in his putting it under the running water.
“We’ll both enjoy when it happens”
"How wrapped around your finger he is," she said.
He looked to Natasha. She nodded. The ground shook under their feet. A massive building erupted from the sand. How many places like this did S.H.I.E.L.D. have? A stern, middle-aged woman stepped out. She seemed irritated. Her curly chestnut hair was tied in a ponytail. Her olive skin weathered from years of working in such terrain. She was dressed in lightweight clothes with her arms crossed. Her brown eyes only softening slightly when she spotted Natasha.
“Take all the time you need,” said Phil.
“Captain America,” said Tony.
The parents nodded. At this moment, that little boy knew their daughter better than they did. It was a painful realization, but it was true. They had to put their faith in Rune.
"I won't always look like this, Winter. I'll grow up."
*****
“Is there anyone you want to call?” asked Matt.
Tony took a breath steadying himself. "It was her scent on you. If it was just that I'd been fine. But that mixed with your eyes. I ... couldn't take it. It was too much."
Hey, sweet cheeks."
“Does anything feel out place?”
“Dr. Ballentine, what do you have for us?” asked Hill.
The day passed smoothly; around ten, Steve fell asleep in his nest. Tony managed to doze off about an hour later. He woke with a start, only hours later. His heart raced in his chest. He couldn't breathe! A pair of hands gently cupped his face, touching their foreheads together. He focused on a pair of blue eyes. It took a few seconds for him to focus in on their bond. It brought him back. His heart rate calmed.
"I'm caring for my mate who seems incapable of doing it himself."
"I'll start with the changes we've found in Tony. The bond the two of you share has somehow transferred a fraction of the effects of the serum. We're trying to figure out why and how long the effects will last," said Bruce.
Steve leaned against him.
“That will keep her busy,” said Steve.
At five in the morning and Tony hadn't gotten any news of Steve's progress.
"Wow, so you're guilt-tripping me into signing this?"
“No, give me it,” he said. Steve took a breath before answering. “Hey, Tony.”
“Yes, we believe whatever they injected you was ineffective,” said the scientist.
“Yes.”
"WHY?!"
“We need to get him sedated before it causes further damage,” said the nurse.
“Check the heart. Check the heart. Is it the brain?” Something was wrong. He had to be healthy. He needed to be there for his family.
“What about you?” asked Steve.
He didn’t know how to process Stark. The man was genius in his fields and he respected, but he didn’t know what to think of the person. What was gossip and what was the truth? There was so much conflicting information surrounding him.
“NO!”
"You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favorite of many sayings, the early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese," he said.
“A tantrum will get you nowhere. Don’t you want to know why I’m,” said Lena.
Winter grunted slightly at a twinge at his side. She smiled. “I got you.”
“I’m tired, and my feet hurt,” said Steve.
“How old is your dad?”
“What?”
"I am." She tucked him into bed, laying down with him until he fell asleep.
*****
*****
The omega growled being woken up.
“Where do we start?”
“Steve-
The alpha groaned.
“Anyone I should call back?” he asked.
She kicked against him and whined. He put her in a fresh diaper. She relaxed. Piper tugged his shirt.
“Now isn’t the time.”
“And I do love your spangly outfit,” he said walking away.
“Amazing!”
“Did this occur naturally?”
"I don't want to behave like this," he said.
“You’re eating. What happened?”
“Why are we here?” asked Piper.
“You wear my mark. That’s enough for me. You want to hyphenate the kid’s name?” said Tony.
“It isn’t forever.”
"We'll be moving him out today," said Tony.
being let back in.
"Sure," said Steve.
“Is that really the time?” asked Piper.
"It's a bit tight," he said.
“Did you-
“Kate, why are here, Mr. Stark?” she asked.
“She’s the closest thing I have to my own. I’d do the same for yours,” Nat said.
Steve smiled.
“I’m not pregnant,” he said.
"If not that, then what?" asked Tony.
The longer she stayed under their control the more she’d likely change. That pup was the only thing keeping him going. He growled at himself. He’d become so dependent on someone else. He put on the TV again trying to escape the thoughts.
“Don’t waste your tears on me.” Winter brushed her tears away with the pad of his thumb. “You shouldn’t cry. It shows weakness.”
“It would crush him,” said Edith.
“Just because I live here doesn’t make it home,” said Piper.
“That’s nice.” His alpha was cutely protective over him and jealous of another alpha. Steve turned around bringing Tony into a kiss. It was a brief almost meaningless moment of happiness that was already gone.
“Why’d you do that?”
*****
“Do you have anything to report on Dr. Zemo?”
The rest of the day went by smoothly. Steve went to his room. It didn’t feel cozy. He got his isle ready he would likely use it later tonight. Steve took a book from the shelf in his room. He turned on the TV to fill the silence. The nature channel was on. Steve settled on the couch. At twelve he tried sleeping, only to wake up an hour later, drenched in cold sweat. The room stunk of his distress. He cracked the window, letting in a cool breeze. His fingers twitched ready to paint anything to try and get the images out of his mind. He squeezed the colors onto his pallet. A rough image of birdlike cages came into inside them were living skeletons. The conditions he found soldiers in he was incapable of describing. It was lucky he’d found Bucky and the other so quickly. At least Bucky was strong enough to walk on his own. And the smell was horrible. It was stentch that lingered in his memory. His phone ringing brought him out of his gruesome thoughts.
“This building doesn’t have any keys, but the meaning is still the same. We've been together for almost three months and you spend so much time here anyway-
*****
“You asked him for permission."
“I need to see it,” she said.
“That shield is impressive. Can I give it a try?” asked Clint.
Edith had already left for S.H.I.E.L.D.
“Nat?”
When he got over his momentary shock, he hurried to her side.
“Should I prepare the shower?” he asked.
And was it making her cry! He was alarmed. They'd take it, her –his
“I’m not afraid to hit an old man,” warned Tony
“Did I hit a nerve?” chuckled Rumlow.
“Says the alpha who left me alone while I’m in heat!”
Tony locked the door of the master bedroom behind him.
This was only an awakening phrase. It could be changed easily enough. That was a benefit to working with a child. Their brains were flexible to train. Lena had engrained several phrases and words to trigger different responses from the girl. She'd implanted an erase phrase that would set in place new activations codes only known to her and erase all previous memories as insurance. One could never be too safe while working with Hydra.
“Yes."
“Thor, you got to try and bottleneck that portal. Slow them down. You got the lighting light the bastards up,” said Steve.
“Can I come in?” asked Tony.
He went through the aisle. Feeding a pregnant super soldier was a constant task. Food was delivered two to three times a week when they were at Malibu. He would have to set it up here. The omega always made sure he was well fed. He crammed the groceries into his sports car. Tony pulled into the back garage. There was always someone at the front of the tower. He grabbed as many bags as could before going up the elevator and put the bags on the counter.
Winter pulled into a parking space and entered the bar. It smelled of fish and chips and stale beer. A crowd of alphas and betas stood around several flat screens, watching a soccer match. Winter took a seat in the corner of the bar, sinking into the darkness. He ordered a beer to help him look less out of place.
“Normal.”
Steve leaned against the bar. Tony stood next to him, his hand gently massaging his lower back. He nuzzled against Steve's neck, breathing in his scent. The earthy, metallic, clove scent relaxed him. It helped soothe his anxiety. Edith and the nurses gave them space.
He took a breath, realizing he had to handle this as if she were an adult. Treating as a child right would be an insult to her intelligence.
Winter pressed the edge of the blade into Smith's neck, sinking it in just enough to pierce the skin.
“I’ll get us out of here if it’s the last thing I do.”
She returned it to him. He carefully tucked it into his back pocket.
? It used to be so constant. And now it was almost nonexistent.
“I can’t talk to you all night."
“He’s staying with me.” Steve almost growled, bringing the alpha close.
“I wanna learn.”
“You’re not ready for those.” Winter smiled. Almost every trainee instantly went to the weapons, first. But a weapon meant nothing if there was no understanding of the basics.
Piper handed him two hair ties, each with a purple bunny on it.
"Seeing you will be enough." Lena hung up.
He got to his feet only to be caught in Loki’s grasp again.
Tony rushed out of the bedroom before Steve decided to him his next target.
“I only stood in the doorway. Is that what caused this?” asked Steve.
“I am not,” said Lena, calm and unconcerned. She unfolded her chair, taking a seat in front of them.
"Its blood drawn from the umbilical cord after birth."
Steve and Piper settled down. Tony left the nest. He kissed his pup and mate before leaving.
"Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes. They are using the Iron Patriot as a Trojan Horse. They are going to take out the president somehow. We have to immediately alert that plane.”
Alpha tone. After all these years Thor should have learned that it only annoyed him further.
“I’m meeting with a friend,” said Steve.
They never talked about children. It was a vague possible idea for the future. He clenched and unclenched his hands trying to regain his previous calm. He rushed to sink throwing up whatever remained in his stomach. Natasha rubbed his back. He slowly raised his head. Nat offered him a paper towel.
“Makes for great eye candy, though,” said Edith.
“Oh, I had thought the beast had wandered off,” said Loki.
“I am interrupting?” she asked.
“We’ll have to announce her birth,” said Tony.
“So you take the world I love as recompenses for your imagined slight. No, the earth is under my protection,” said Thor.
"Christina Rosenthal."
“Why does it matter? It was before the serum.”
“Phil?”
Thor laughed. “You people are so petty and tiny,” he said.
“Sir, he won’t be happy.”
Rune shrugged. “Always seemed normal to me.”
Steve nodded. Finally, the session was over. Only ten minutes until his date. He went to his room, grabbing his shield. Steve forced himself not to run to the entrance. He smiling when Tony’s car pulled up. His heart raced. He took a breath, calming himself. It did nothing to ease the butterflies in his stomach. He was only getting his shield repaired. There was nothing more to it. The car door opened. Tony was dressed in a white blazer, purple shirt, and dark jeans.
“This is none of my business but do you two have history?” he asked.
“I don’t believe you.”
“Yes, they do the bidding of the wicked witch of the west. Once we’ve survived this I’ll watch with you,” said Steve.
“How can you be so sure?”
“Yes, in a rather irritating way,” said Natasha.
“You have a point,” he said.
“Do you want to open it?” asked Tony, offering it to his mate.
“Jarvis, get the bath ready," said Tony.
“That was beautiful."
"Thanks, Thor," said Steve. He grew uncomfortable at Thor’s focus on his stomach. Tony moved in front of him.
Winter dried the pup's eyes, but it didn't stop her crying. If guilt were the only thing wrong the pup it wasn't as bad he thought. It would fade in time.
February 12, 2013
“Why rebuild the engine? I’m sure it won’t be strong enough power what you’re making.”
"Your what? You aren't his husband or mate, Stark. I'm breaking all the rules coming here, but you are the only solution there may be to the current issue we are facing," said Fury.
“I’m a big girl. I can handle myself.”
"Run your hands down your chest slowly."
“I don’t think we should be focusing on, Loki. That’s guy’s brain is a bag full of cats. You can smell crazy on him,” said Bruce.
"Steve, I won't hurt you," she said.
“And you’ll come back as soon as you can?”
“Steve!”
“You have to get your appetite up.”
"I don't want to talk about this. No one on earth has gone through what I have."
He couldn’t protect her here, he could barely do it before, in their cell. His hands fisted. It was the only physical act of rebellion he could manage, and even that was a struggle.
“It was poorly handled,” said Tony.
He nodded. She was on the verge of crying again. There were no words he could say to make her feel better, so he rubbed her back.
That was a sore spot; best not to touch on it for the moment. “I sure he is.”
A blonde female alpha stood in the doorway. They were rare. Female alphas possessed all the strength of males but couldn’t produce or bare children. They always smelled terrific and had immense control over their alpha strength, which made them the ideal alpha to spend a heat with. The woman smelled of ginger and jasmine. She had mid-length blonde hair and blue eyes. She was dressed in pink scrubs. Her smile was warm and gentle.
“This isn’t funny!”
He watched the girls run out of the room. When he turned his attention back the Mandarin was crawling on the floor. This ragged bearded beta wasn't the Mandarin. This guy had to be double. Tony set off a warning shot. He'd wasted his time on this! The beta crawled back to the seat.
He tried soothing her. Steve raised his shirt, trying to get her nurse to preoccupy her. She pushed away from his chest, whining. They switched off, walking her up and down the aisle of the plane. They landed around 9:15 pm. A car was waiting for them. Piper was still crying.
“Already want to leave?” asked Natasha.
Both the pups undressed, used to the process. Once they were poked and prodded to whatever scientist’s satisfaction, they could put their clothes back on.
“It's a pitiful replace from what I’ve become used to."
“Me too.”
Matt was surprised. Foggy hadn’t been to his apartment for days. Even then he was only there an hour. Most omegas wouldn’t be able to pick that up. Who was Steve?
“The mechanic, Tony.”
She screamed directly in his ear.
"There something wrong with me mentally. I most likely have a version of PTSD like Papa and Daddy. So, why do I need you telling me what’s wrong with me? It seems you gain more from me than I do from you.”
kidnapping. They never really discussed how he became Ironman. She seemed more interested in the tech than the story, not that he could blame her; the tech was amazing.
“I am well aware of the danger your children pose. They’d be my most high-risk patients in that sense. But their cases aren't as unique as you think," said George.
“And?”
“Apparently sir, it’s in Miami.”
“Just a jam,” said Tony.

“In an hour or two.”
He sighed. Tony wouldn’t drop it.
“You gave her sugar and still managed to get her to sleep,” said Steve.
He took off the helmet and went into the kitchen.
Tony glanced in the rearview mirror, smiling when he saw Piper asleep.
July 30, 2012
“We know,” said Steve.
Steve twitched. Edith and her nurses left. His fingers tore into the mattress as he suffered through another contraction. He screamed into the pillow. Tony got into bed with him. The alpha was wearing his gauntlets. Those cool metal fingers were wonderful against his heated skin. He purred, pressing against their touch.
Blue eyes locked on his. They held such deep relief. He thought he'd never see them again. Tony touched Steve’s cheek, making sure it was real. Steve leaned into the touch, tears streaming down his face. He was real. Steve brought him into his arms, kissing him. The omega's tears wet his face.
The prisoner would rather have an innocent child die than let them have him. She had barely caught him in time. The boy clung to her. He hadn't spoken a word but still refused to let go.
Rhodes tapped against his helmet.
Tony paused in the hall when he heard the shatter of glass. Howard's office door was cracked open and Piper was standing in glass, a broken frame by her feet. Her lost expression perfectly mimicked Steve’s when he had an episode.
“It was scrapped,” said Tony, walking away. The alpha’s mood was changing swiftly. “Hey, I thought I didn’t even qualify.” Tony pointed out.
"You'll have to be kept under observation."
The room wasn’t completely sterile of scent. It belonged to someone new. A mixture of cedar, somehow summery, and the smell of electricity combined. It was alpha in nature but muted in intensity, meaning the alpha was still young. Some aspects of his scent were extremely familiar.
"As I said, Ms. Pott is Sir's ex. Their relationship is strictly platonic. They stay in communication since Ms. Pott is the current CEO of Stark Industries."
“Why?” he asked.
"How wrapped around your finger he is."
“Yes.”
“I don’t see why she can’t come to us. I'll cover her travel expenses," said Tony.
“He’s O-.”
Steve lost interest in his cereal.
“You speak Italian."
“I’ll make sure he reports to you.”
“Dada.”
She was broken from the haze of comfort when Theodore's cold metal hand clamped down on the back of her neck, scruffing her. Piper whined. She instantly went limp dropping the stuffed bunny.
George grabbed his suitcase, hurrying out. Jumping slightly, the car locked behind him. She opened storage unit 437, taking a key from her pocket.
An angered inhuman roar answered her cry.
“What’s the situation upstairs?” asked Steve.
Lena just rolled her eyes. She may not have superhuman hearing, but she wasn’t deaf.
“No!” said Steve.
Beta read by AbsolutShenanigans
“How did they snap him out of it?”
“I was curious. There’s nothing like it here. And he wouldn’t say yes.”
She tackled him. They slid into the hall, gaining the attention of the two opposing forces. Piper rapidly slammed her small fists into his face until he stopped moving.
"Are you going to stand guard or join me?"
Tony flinched uncomfortably as the scent of burnt sugar and bleach filled his senses. He knew the trance-like state. Tony forced himself to purr. It was a deep raspy unused sound.
“Who is he visiting?"
"Normally, I would recommend a week. Don't be concerned if there's some spotting in the next few days. When he wakes up he may be out of it,” said Edith.
Finally, they were able to leave. They hated how they were forced to stay there longer than necessary.
“I can’t give you an accurate timeline. There’s no baseline for this,” said Edith.
The alpha was asking him to bare his neck, not forcing him. He would have naturally done it, but the question snapped him from the instinct.
“Check your phone, Rogers."
“No one here will ever hurt you or her,” Tony explained firmly. Then he gently tilted Piper’s head up and wiped the single tear dripping down her cheek. "If we find him, you'll be the first to know."
She spent the next few hours stewing on that thought. Had they really beaten her down so much? What had happened to her? When was she ever one to give up? The idea of escape had just seemed to fade from importance as she became preoccupied with Sir’s new routines and her new friend. Piper fell from her chair as an electric rod jabbed into her. A punishment is unjust for default in attention. She growled.
“How does it make sense?! I get caught in an explosion and it cancels out my heat. But when our daughter goes missing, it decides to make an appearance!" growled Steve.
"Jarvis, show him to his lab," said Tony.
“So what’s really going on with Mandarin?” he asked.
“Were you close,” said Phil.
“We’re safe got my birth control before the mission,” he said.
“So, they’ve been watching the whole time,” said Steve.
“Steve, we’re home."
“Losing a friend is impossible,” said Steve.
Steve was pleasurably hazy. The smell of alpha thoroughly relaxing him, but the lingering scent of Tony's arousal made him desire the alpha. He blushed. He hadn't meant to reach release so fast. It was all so much.
“He turns,” said Hill.
“Come here, alpha.”
Steve shook his head. It was inappropriate for him to ask that.
“Harley Davidson CVO. How does it feel?” asked Phil.
“We stay together!” Piper clung to Rune, holding his hand tightly. There was little she could do to mend to promise she’d broken to Winter. She would find him again, no matter how long it took. But Rune was a promise she could keep.
“Yes, as in plural. I've always wanted a big family," said Steve.
Tony’s hands fisted. “She made it clear that she wants nothing to do with me!”
“I heard it,”
Tony nodded. He could easily use an alpha command to get an answer, but Steve was entitled to his privacy. Steve had something he wanted to keep secret, so did he. Everyone was entitled to their secrets. By the time the movie was over, Steve was asleep, using his lap as a pillow.
Steve almost bared his teeth and snarled. “Wasn’t the purpose of this to speed things along.”
“Your father,”
He wrapped his arm around Tony’s waist and gave him a real kiss.
“She’s scared,” said Winter.
She nodded. For the first time since she arrived her, Piper left the outer chamber, where her cell was held, on her own two feet. The polished tile floor was cold against her soles. She heard people moving about, but they were out of sight. In front of her was a maze of halls. There were no signs on any of the door. She grabbed Winter’s hand as they walked through the halls.
"We aren't sure. It could go either way at this point."
She cuddled against his chest. He wrapped a protective arm around her. Sleep followed swiftly.
“Piper, I’ll be the last person to underestimate you. I’m well aware of how intelligent you are. Yes, this is legally useless, but shows your merit as a person that you’re willing to go through with your word,” said George.
Tony went to the gym. Steve was on the weight bench lifting an inhuman amount.
“There, done.”
Matt led him to a bathroom.
“What are you doing?” she asked.
“We’ll figure it out."
Another fractured whimper left the omega. Distress saturated the layers of their nest, destroying its comfort. Fear contorted Steve's handsome expression.
"Do you know why history is important?"
"Cuddling on the couch and see where it leads," said Steve.
*****
"Thanks for keeping your best man speech civil," he said.
Steve took Tony’s hand in his. “We’ll figure this out together."
Steve nodded. He called Rhodes.
“I should be the one warning you. This man is as close to feral as anyone gets. Why do you want him?”
“I don’t like it here. I want to go back.”
“It could have been anyone’s weapons,” he said.
Getting Steve to eat the last few days proved difficult with his constant morning sickness. Unlike betas, omegas didn't get a break from morning sickness when they were further along; it lasted the entire pregnancy. They went to the kitchen. Steve kept slowly ate, while he watched over him. The elevator doors opened.
"I'm not permitted," said Winter. A protocol he appreciated. It was a burden he did not want. Life was easier that way. He wished the child wasn't weighed down by having this feeling. At least, in this circumstance. "Don't waste your tears on them."
Steve hobbled to his feet, limping toward the end of the alley.
Piper hissed as she burned her finger with soldering iron. With the amount of wealth they had, they should have been able to afford custom tools that fit in her hands, instead of her constantly injuring her hands using the adult size ones. She grabbed a Band-Aid from the box next to her, wrapping it around her finger.
“Why?”
Next to him, Tony slept deeply. How did Tony keep up? He kissed Tony's temple.
"Do we really need him? It's been quiet. What is so pressing that you need to use, Captain Rogers?" asked Barny.
“I forgot,” he said. He’d never been much for jewelry, but it felt so natural around his neck.
Steve got out of the tub when clean. He wrapped a towel around his waist. Steve kneeled next to Tony. He squirted shampoo in his hand and started working it gently into his thick brown locks. Steve washed the suds from Tony’s hair, careful not to get any his eyes. He turned away as Tony got out. Steve wanted nothing more than to sleep. He settled in bed. Tony’s warmth was pressed against his back. He turned to face him.
“We need them alive. How do I know they won’t kill someone we can use to get useful information?” Hill asked.
“Oh, I see you were trying to save, Stark when he threatened us?”
Steve’s heat coiled form relaxed at the feeling of the alpha's chest behind him. Purring as those tender lips sucked, kissed, and nipped at his skin. Tony’s hand traveled past his stomach. His back arched, panting desperately at the touch. He thrust frantically into the alpha’s hand, trying to get more friction. The alpha's hands were working him so perfectly. He fisted the sheets as he came yet again. The release did nothing to relieve the consuming need. Tony gently turned him on his back.
Natasha sighed, before getting in her car heading to Play Mart as well. She pulled into the back park lot, spotting the employee entrance. Natasha turned the dial on her watch. The signal would loop the footage. She easily picked the locked and snagged a spare uniform. Natasha went into a stall. It was a simple black uniform and an orange vest.
“I didn’t say anything.”
"An ultrasound. It uses high frequency to form an image so I can see inside you. It won't hurt your baby. You won't be able to see anything since it so early in development but I want to check your womb. So can you lay back down?"
“I promised I would come back for him. I won’t leave my friend behind. I don’t care how long it takes,” said Piper.
“I have to meet with my therapist,” he said.
“My name is Trevor, Trevor Slattery.”
Steve patted on him on the shoulder. "Tony, it's alright."
“Congratulations!”
“Tony,” said Steve. The lack of hesitation even caught him off guard. Heat rose in his cheeks. Who else would he spend it with? He didn’t want to be passed along from alpha to alpha. Couldn’t he stay with Tony?
“Can we go?” he asked.
his pup was missing and his omega said it was his fault. So, now wasn’t the time for that submissive side.
"Where's the rest?"
Steve laughed when he caught Tony ogling him.  Even when he carried his baby weight, Tony looked at him lustfully. Intimacy proved difficult when they shared a bed with an infant. Piper had a habit of interrupting them whenever they had gotten close.
Thor smiled. “I’m glad it met his approval."
He texted Tony that he was leaving. Happy pulled the car up to the front of the hotel and opened the door for him.
Tony turned on the news. Arm and Hammer kept going back and forth between the bedroom and laundry room. Steve yawned.
“Ten,” said Jarvis.
“To examine your and Rune’s DNA.”
“Tell me what happened,” said Tony.
Tony kissed Steve on the temple.
June 17, 2016
"I ate too much."
"Tony?" he asks uncertainly.
“No, I’m glad you called,” said Tony.
Winter’s hands fisted. He wanted to break the alpha’s neck, along with several other things.
“I’m fine; I just needed you. You’re the only that can get me down from the state.”
His rescue from the question came when his shirt grew wet. Turner handed him a tissue box.
“Don’t worry, Arm and Hammer will handle it,” said Tony.
“They aren’t so bad. Pepper and Maria want us to start cooking healthier things. I guess that means raisins. So who you waiting for?”
“He managed it before for you, Piper. I’m sure he’ll be able to do it without you.”
“Thank you.” Steve smiled.
Steve shrugged it off, not giving Loki the reaction he craved.
“We weren’t.”
“Stark secure server rental scan verified.”
It was more than a simple shock collar. If she ever got out it, would probably activate a tracking system. She didn’t have the tools available to break it off.
“I enjoy it,” he said.
"I haven't been there for more than twenty years. There is no excuse for me not to go now. We'll go tomorrow," said Tony.
"I'll show you out," said Steve. He sent a glare back at his mate before showing her out.
Piper forgot that fact a lot. She'd interacted with alpha kids before they always had some level of entitlement to them, but Rune wasn't like that.
“Hello, sir.”
“For wha-” Tony pushed a finger into him, mercilessly massaging against his sweet spot. Steve mewled his back arching off the bed.
“You don’t want to interact with them,” Winter said, finally.
“Oh, I’m disrupting-
Steve was first to get to the entranceway. “Piper, why don’t you go play.”
“He will be. I want to see how the interaction plays out.”
*****
“What’s the matter scared of a little lighting?” asked Steve.
“Tony calm down. What’s going on?” asked Rhodes.
“Phil, I have to go in get some paperwork done,” said Steve.
“It’s in our job description to worry. We’re parents.“
"Read these. If you follow them, everything should go smoothly," said Pepper.
“You don't that problem,” he said.
"She still the woman I remember. Age hasn't changed her," said Steve.
“No.”
The words hit like a break. It was a heavy title. He swallowed the lump in his throat. "You don't think I realize that? How unfit I am to father?"
Neither of them could sleep. The night was spent watching their child's heartbeat on the monitor. Every now and then their pup would kick against their hands, somehow knowing it was a comfort to them.
Blushed warmed his already heated skin.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to stare,” she said.
“No.”
“What about Winter?”
“Glasgow, Scotland. When will you leave?” said Natasha.
"How will you do it?"
“I’ve decided our kid is never getting bunk beds,” said Tony, rubbing his forehead.
“Now you do.”
He wrapped his arm around her. She screamed, ready to battle him with the same fury, but swiftly relaxed when she recognized his scent, letting the knife dropped from her hand.
Its failure was inevitable, but she had gained valuable information on the response action. She would have to find a way to defuse the system. The walls that emerged the floor could be with effort. It was slowly any route of escape. But such defenses were likely limited to junctions. If she found a relatively straight path and avoid cross-section it could limit the encounter with such barriers.
Steve took the position. Tony’s breath caught in his throat. He deeply took in the omega's scent. Tony could almost taste the tart-sweet scent. He ran his fingers over those smooth round cheeks. Tony ran his tongue over the wet leaking slit.
“Do you want me there?” he said.
Rune smiled. “You’re a good alpha.”
“He’s checking up on me,” said Steve.
Tony went to check out and bought a cloth bag since it would likely hold up better during flight. A crowd of costumers watched as he suited up. He slung the bag over his shoulder and took off. Steve was asleep on the couch. Tony didn't risk waking the omega. He put the ice cream in the freezer and left the other things out, so Steve could easily find them. Tony pulled a blanket over Steve. He wanted to check on Bruce's progress.
“400 feet.”
"The why has nothing to do with you.”
“It’s fine, Steve. While on the topic, have you had any discomfort nursing?”
“Nice to meet you. I’m Helmut Zemo,” he said shaking her hand.
“If you could, would you?”
The moment faded when Steve saw that smile. It so matched that of their daughter’s. Tony sighed, his expression becoming heavy once again.
Where was his alpha?! He wanted his alpha! Steve fought the urge to give in to the alpha’s physical command. He shook off Rumlow’s hold. The alpha pulled a gun. Before he could disarm the alpha a shot went off, hitting him in the leg. It wasn’t the searing pain he expected, but dull grogginess.
"I brought a gift to celebrate your union and one for the child since I may not be there to celebrate its birth," said Thor. He handed Steve the deep red blanket rolled and neatly tied with a black ribbon. Steve unraveled it revealing the large emblem woven into the fabric. “It’s a shield knot in the colors of your alpha's armor. A symbol of protection in my culture."
“I know. She’s smart. Too smart for her own good. But I can’t see her doing this unless she was forced,” said Steve.
“Is that necessary?” asked Edith.
“Alpha,” said Happy.
That was inevitable. Only a matter of time. As soon as they deemed their training done he'd be erased. They wouldn't want to risk someone catching him and using his info on her.
Winter could see the chaos within the pup. These were her parents. They'd come for her. That's where she belonged. She needed permission to be free of the promise she'd made to him. His own orders were to slow them down, not to prevent them from taking her. Protecting the asset meant doing what was best for her. What was best for her was to be with them. He came closer to her.
Steve got up from the kitchen island and started gathering pillows. He had to build his nest. Steve wanted it to be ready. Tony watched him from the door as he worked. Only when Steve had built the to his highs standard did Tony join him. Steve purred as Tony’s fingers ran through his hair.
“All we did was search for you. That’s all we could do.” She didn't seem to believe him. "Honey, we love you. If Papa could fit in this tube, I am sure he'd say the same thing."
On the screen was an image of him and Tony kissing, moments after the battle.
"Don't say that," said Steve. He already had enough worries without that very real possibility of Piper refusing therapy.
“Mrs. Davis your son didn’t kill himself. I grantee you that he didn’t kill anyone. Someone used him,” said Tony.
"Sorry, I don't know what brought that on." Steve cracked his knuckles, trying to return to their previous calm. But couldn't. It took longer to recover any perceived panic, while in or nearing heat. He was vaguely aware of Tony inching closer to him. First, the alpha's hand was running up and down his arm, slowly moving further upward. He slumped into the alpha when he started stroking under his chin.
"What about you?" she asked.
“It’s fine, sweetheart. I can get a new tub." Tony nuzzled the bite mark he left. Steve went weak in the knees, bracing himself in the counter.
He watched as Steve took a Twinkie from a cabinet and dunked it in ranch dressing. “And that does?”
His face yielded nothing as she sewed close the wound on his forehead. He looked so tired. Anyone would after taking a beating like that. She examined his metal arm. Piper inserted the needle into the small keyhole in Winter's arm. The panel opened. She reactivated the arm. Winter flexed it, moving his fingers. His knuckles were scuffed. That hadn't happened during the attack. Winter hadn't fought back.
From outside, he heard Natasha honk her car.
He huffed, putting down his mate. His arms crossed in slight frustration.
“No, sir.”
“I think so. You didn’t see the notes she was working on. And even if it's only for a few months, at least she willing to try. Maybe we should take her to the New York Ballet when she’s ready.”
“It will fit."
"He's with your Aunt Pepper and Aunt Maria," said Jarvis.
“Agent Romanoff will you escort Dr. Banner back to his-
Steve stretched out and purred.
She whined, hiding her face in the pillows. Shame washed over her when she felt a wet spot underneath her. She whined. The last time she wet the bed, she was two.
“Yes, I must bring Loki to face justice for his crimes,” said Thor.
“Mr. Stark,”
“Boxer braids it is.”
He took Piper to his chest. She latched. He winced when accidentally bit him.
“He’s an expert in biochemistry, nuclear physics, and gamma radiation,” said Phil.
“12:05 pm to be exact,” said Jarvis.
Fury arrived at Stark Tower. His team hadn’t responded quickly enough to the threat. The doors of the building automatically opened. That was first normally had to force his way through.
Only one more.
*****
Tony nodded. There gentle kick against his hand. He kneeled down and kissed Steve’s stomach.
Rhodes didn't react to Steve's anger. It was rightly placed. He wasn't able to pull away from work.
“No one thinks any less of you, Steve. They'd probably think more of you,” said Barny. He waited for the tension to relax in Steve's. The omega rolled his shoulders. “We haven’t discussed what happened at the graveyard."
He took a seat on the steps beside her. “Nice hat.”
“They’ve been irregular in their spacing so far, but they've each lasted a minute,” said Jarvis.
“The eighteenth,” said Steve.
She leaned against the padded wall tensing when the door opened. Sir marched in. He placed an iPad in front of her.
Sir waited for dinner to arrive. A tray was pushed through the slot of his door. He opened his sandwich. There hidden under a layer of cheese was a white capsule pill. So it really came to this. Fury’s lie detector was that much of a threat. He took it without hesitation, swallowing it with a gulp of water. Convulsing as it took effect.
Steve hadn't fought the motion. It felt so natural. As he breathed Tony's intoxicating smell, the fog clouding his memory of last night cleared. He pulled away from Tony's neck.
*****
“You wanted to talk. I want to make sure I made the right decision,” said Steve.
Tony watched as Steve fell asleep against his chest. He'd never said those were so frequently. Every time he said them he meant it. Telling Steve he loves him was natural. He caught a few nurses pausing in front of the window of their room. Their eyes widened at his open affection. This one of the few places he could be so open with his affection. Steve purred as he ran his finger through his hair, not caring that his golden brown locks were dirtied with ash. He was about to close his eyes when Dr. Blackwell strode lowly in.
He shook his head. “All battles blend together.”
“Thank you.”
“You’ve exhausted me thoroughly, but that doesn’t mean I can’t pamper you,” said Tony.
“What?” said Steve.
“Already have,” said Jarvis.
“Thank you so much,” said Fleur.
“It wasn’t easy," said Steve.
He took a deep breath, forcing down the panic. “Why am I back? How’d you get him out?”
"Turn on the news," said Pepper.
"See ya, Steve."
The alpha gave a tired smile. "I hope so."
“I’m sorry, Tony. I forgot about that.” He helped him to a chair.
“Come on let’s finish the rest of the drill,” said Steve.
“What?”
“Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have arrived and the southern doors are being cleared as we speak,” said Jarvis.
It had to be the pregnancy. Alphas were hardwired not harm one in such a condition. Instincts weren't allowed to play a part in his life.
“Are you sure? I wouldn’t want to take away from something important,” said Steve.
"Silly girl what are you talking about? You
“Fine let’s go,” he said.
Steve settled beside him. Tony was drawn from his work by Steve’s incessant purring. He took the bowl from Steve. The omega’s growl was soothed with a kiss. The taste of mango lingered on his lips. He ran his hands down Steve’s body. They fell back onto the couch.
A chuckle broke his focus. A very old alpha stepped forth. The boy had caught glimpses of him before, but not so close. The old man always kept to the background. People moved out of the old guy's way wherever he went. Why though? He didn’t smell special. The older alpha approached him, slowly circling around him. The boy kept his gaze low, unchallenging.
"I want to," said Tony.
“You okay?"
"Caught in a thought," he said.
Tony was wearing a brace. Steve got into the wheelchair. He was only wearing boxers. It felt as if he was wearing a diaper with all the padding.
“You brought, Clint,” said Steve.
He straightened, awaiting a
“We were attacked most likely by associates of the Mandarin,” said Steve.
Lena came in. She spared a quick glance at the perfectly rendered world map decorating the wall.
“What would you call them?” he asked.
“No.”
“I can do more,” she slurred tiredly.
“Who?”
“Jarvis.”
Jarvis had already started a fresh pot off coffee. It had become the majority of their diet. He'd lost his appetite. Steve glared at the fruit bowl on the counter. He took an apple, managing only a small bite before abandoning it on the counter in favor of checking on his mate.
Steve nodded.
“Don’t try anything. I’m sexed out,” said Steve.
“Did he chose Stark on his own?” asked Fury.
She tried lifting with all her strength. The glass was bulletproof, strong and durable, impossible for the average person to break. She stepped back, slamming her body full speed against the glass. It cracked. On her third attempt, a small panel shattered. She helped the others get outside and down the ledge.
Tony’s heart sank. His poor sweet omega. He should have been safely tucked away in their den. Tony should have been there for his omega while he was in heat. If he was Steve wouldn't have gotten hurt.
“I’ll start working on lunch for them,” said Steve.
“No.” Piper extended her arm closing her eyes.
If only she had gotten a chance to take a sample before Piper escaped. She planned on introducing her to Winter, though not in the way it happened. But it couldn't have happened more perfectly. Winter killing that beta cemented Piper's trust in him as a protector. It would have taken weeks for that connection to form otherwise.
*****
"And here you are thirteen years later in a dungeon," said Tony.
“Don’t say stuff like that, Rune. You’re smart too. Especially compared to other five-year-olds I’ve met. Back me up?”
“Tony?” Did he actually say that? Tony teased him so much it was only fair that he got a turn.
“Give it my best shot,” said Matt.
"You know what this crater reminds me of?"
Piper charged at the image only to collide with air.
"Okay, but when you get that bad feeling, that is what it's like to miss someone." Winter nodded, brows narrowing. "It's a good thing."
“It can’t be that easy,” said Tony.
“He made quite a display dropping you off,” said Barny.
“I’m small, fast, and flexible.”
"Is that okay with you?" asked Tony.
“Call her later,” said Tony, pulling Steve closer.
Tony went to his side. Steve pressed against him, trying to hide. The omega tensed, snarling deeply when Edith and her nurses came into the room. Tony struggled to keep control over his inner alpha.
“You’re trespassing leave!" demanded Steve.
“By this stage in my career, I’d hoped to be doing more than babysitting a mental patient and a kid genius,” said Kevin.
“I just got off a red-eye flight from New York, and you want me to leave again,” said Rhodes.
Steve stared blankly at the canvas in front of him, unable to pick up a paintbrush. Five days, 120 hours without his daughter. Their home was no longer a home. The warm comfort gifting it that title had drained from its walls. All that remained was an imprisoning husk, crowded with reminders of who was missing. Steve and Tony were incapable of fixing it.
“Technically, I am."
She settled inside it. Sighing happily. She yanked Rune in beside her.
“It doesn’t matter,” Winter gruffed.
for his lab. His mate needed him and that gave him purpose. It was more useful than he'd been in days. Steve's muscles jumped. A wounded noise tore from his throat, loud and desperate.
“Why?”
“Why not?”
Winter watched the carnage, unable to join. There was no finesse to her actions. It was pure animalistic rage. It continued long after all the threats were eliminated. He got up, finally, limping toward the girl.
“What can I do for you, Captain Rogers?”
She walked with the doctor out of the room and out of his reach.
“You denying it makes it all the more true.”
Tony came upstairs moments later.
Piper flinched at the word ‘sir.' It was something they could address later. For the moment, Steve had his pup back; he had to focus on that. As they walked home, the sky started to clear; Rune must have calmed down. When they got to the front door, Steve put Piper down.
“I was um uh-
If Papa wanted to do it that was better. She didn't want to, but Sir should die. Piper realized that these weren't the thoughts of a normal girl.
It was unusual seeing him there. He'd become used to waking up alone. Steve would be in the gym or pacing around the tower in search of distraction. Seeing his mate so peaceful after such stress almost made him smile. He leaned over pressing a gentle kiss on his forehead, carding his fingers through the omega's hair.
"You need to sleep," said Steve.
March 22, 2016
“I don’t want to fight. I know what you’re trying to do,” said Steve.
“Protect,” whispered Tony.
They grabbed another.
“Hello?”
A surgical tech approached them.
“We’ll set up a meeting between you and Natasha.”
"You don't want to hurt me. And you can't scare me. Prove me wrong. Hit me, like, that other one did."
“Is anyone else awake?” he asked.
“If you were my pup I’d still want you,” said Winter. “No matter what.”
"When I came out of the machine, it felt like I didn't belong in my own body. I had to adjust and made mistakes along the way. I was treated like a freak," he said.
His friends left. He sighed. The company was nice. It went better than he thought. Hopefully, one of the two would do for him. If not, he'd been going through his heat alone. Steve cleaned up. He couldn’t resist opening up to Tony’s slide. The alpha was handsome and oozed confidence.
“None of my inventions have unintentionally exploded since I was ten,” said Tony.
They finished packing up his room. Happy left in the van.
“You fought back.”
“We’ll get him,” she soothed.
There was something so satisfying about seeing Rumlow put in his place.
“I'll try. Will you stay close?"
“I’m only taking an interest in modern art. What’s the biggest donation given?” asked Tony.
"I'll be fine."
Tony nodded. He’d hired a nurse and some of the best doctors to watch over his aunt. After this, he would check in on her progress with the doctors. After all, the woman had done for him, paying for her expenses was the least he could do. Tony leaned against the counter, waiting for the kettle to come to a boil.
Barny was a pleasant beta. A beta he wouldn't have second thoughts about being around if it weren't for his profession. "I'm sure of that, but you're not my friend. I'm your patient that changes the dynamic. Physically, you can't beat me, but you have the power to ruin me."
“This is-
Steve ignored him. It was disturbing that the alpha enjoyed his scent. Steve broke the restraints. As soon as Rumlow left the seat it triggered something. A blaring alarm and counted down started. They didn’t have much time. He grabbed Natasha and Rumlow, throwing them over his shoulder, running through the maze. There was a thunderous explosion that shook the ground. The entrance was within sight. Fire and shrapnel were following behind them. Steve threw two of them before him. He was blow out of the cave just before it collapsed. The stench of blood clouded his sense. He grew light-headed. So tired so cold. He closed his eyes.
“Are you sure about this?” he asked.
Tony rolled his eyes. “You worry too much. Piper is only three, Steve. She has plenty of time to make friends."
“Good luck,” she said.
Tony hated having company in his lab, but the blue eyes pried at his willpower.
Tony went upstairs to get Piper’s hairbrush, still hoping Steve would follow through in seeking help for himself. That was the problem with being selfless. It left little room for yourself. He picked up the brush he'd used on Piper. There were a few short strands of hair caught in its teeth. Then he went to the backyard where was Rune was playing with Pepper and Maria. As soon as Rune noticed him, his gaze focused on the ground.
Steve smiled. "You're going to change her?"
“Tony?”
“Sorry about that,” said Steve.
“It will be fine,” said Tony.
"It wasn't a dream," he said.
“Thank you.”
“Not my most creative names, but they serve a purpose,” said Tony.
“Right.”
Steve was the first to wake from their passionate week. He lay in a large nest on the floor. At some point, he’d dragged the mattress from the bed frame onto the floor. He checked his neck for a claim mark. There was none. He was relieved but also disappointed not to have one.
“Nice necklace, Steve,” he said with a knowing smirk.
"That you were once the top in your field retired because-
“Thanks, but the last time I was in New York I kinda broke Harlem,” said Bruce.
“Who are you?” she asked.
“Just?” said Natasha.
“I’ve been sitting on my hands for more than a month. How is that doing all I can?!”
“I’ve got a job for you.”
“There’s a lot she isn’t telling us. She’s bottling it up. A habit I know she learned from us.”
“He’s a strong man he’ll wake up from this.” Steve squeezed the alpha's hand. Words weren't the comfort his alpha needed. He yawned. His body urged him to sleep. The closer he grew to his due the more exhausted him became.
“It’s a-
“Spread your legs a bit more." His voice heavy with desperation. Steve gradually spread his legs, releasing more of his alluring scent. A scent that beckoned his inner alpha to break free. He forced the urge down. With his free hand, he ran his fingers through the slick running plentifully down Steve’s inner thighs.
“Thanks be to God,” said the audience.
“No, no threatening. No, drink you sure. I’m having one,” he said.
"Like I said there's no one for me to call. I lost parents when I was young," said Steve. He was alone.
“I won’t tell,” she said.
By the twentieth verse, Piper fell asleep, so Tony put her to bed again. Hopefully, there wouldn't be any more disruptions. At six in the morning wailing resumed. So much for sleep. He went through Piper’s morning routine. Even after being fed and changed she wouldn’t stop crying. Maybe it was the teeth. He took her teething ring from the freezer offering it to her. She threw it and screeched.
"Do you need me to get you?"
“You’ve done more than enough.”
“Sure, sweetheart. We can go right after your appointment tomorrow if you want.”
He whined. His body was heavy he didn’t want to move. Steve nuzzled closer to Tony’s chest.
“I know what it’s like to grow up without a father. I don’t want that for her. I don’t think I’ll be able to do it alone.”
“It isn’t.”
She instantly came to him. It was odd having someone take orders from him. Winter charged at the glass, snarling. The beta fell backward, chest rising and falling rapidly. The pup giggled. Winter liked the sound. It was something he didn't hear often.
“You still haven’t told me why.”
“I broke the crayon.”
“I’ve heard enough. You’re not him, the Mandarin. The real guy. WHERE?!” This had to be some kind of look alike. “WHERE?! WHERE’S THE MANDARIN!”
That's what he hoped. Then he could start a family with Peggy. It was a dream he so wanted at the time. His hand subconsciously traveled his stomach.
“Five in the morning at the airstrip."
“The idiot is worried about you. He’s too stubborn to admit it,” she said.
“Good,” she said.
He flinched at the painting of the Tesseract.
“What is she saying?” asked Steve.
“A free massage before a long flight. We should do it again."
“He created you.”
His inner omega screamed at him to return; to make sure that woman didn’t go anywhere near the sire of his pup.
"Romania, that's all I can't tell you until you're approved by medical," said Natasha.
She turned away. Killian’s voice echoed down the hall.
“She has you to teach her. I’m sure she’ll be a fast learner,” said Bruce.
"That's an eternity to her,"
“I’ll hang up now if you continue with that!” he snarled.
“It doesn’t matter if I am or not. Your word means everything. If you say there’s something wrong with me, they put in an omega asylum,” said Steve.
Steve whimpered.
“It will take time for her to adjust,” Lena hedged.
“Zemo?!”
“Give me a guestimate of how many times you reached completion,” said Edith.
“It’s unlikely.”
“Braids.”
"Do the Starks know we've captured someone?"
“I wish I could get through to her better. Tony and Piper have their intelligence and engineering. I can’t bond with her like that. She seems to trust him more now that Tony’s opened up to her about his kidnapping,” said Steve.
"Our talk can wait. I don't want to wake her," whispered Steve.
“He always answers for me. Something is wrong,” said Steve.
“Steve?”
"They'd be would. God, they'd give me such an earful over this."
The kids ran, charging toward it. For the first time, the pups actually acted like children, exploring to their hearts’ content. Both Steve and Tony smiled when they heard them laughing.
Lena lead her back to room she shared with Winter. She was shoved inside.
“Nothing is more important than you."
“The beta woman, Lena Zemo. What about her?” asked Tony.
"Let's say you get out of here somehow. Do you think people will accept you now, Piper? You said it yourself, you're a monster."
“It’s not addressed to me,” said Fury.
“Bucky and I fought,” said Steve.
"Of course. I'll even put Dora the Explorer on." That got a small smile out of him.
"She's hungry, can I-
"I have to go to the bathroom. I don't think I can get up."
They walked toward the edge.
"How’d I do?"
“I can’t answer that without sounding cheesy,” he said.
The demigod finally took notice of Rhodes.
Hours later Steve came out of it. His head rested in Tony's lap, the alpha's fingers brushing through his hair. Steve's throat was dry and his eyes stung. He sat up. Tony was pale and looked drained. He couldn't imagine the sounds he must have been making for the alpha to look like that.
Steve nodded. Flinching when she squirted a cool gel on his stomach. She moved the wand over his stomach.
“No one has seen you for seventy-two hours,” said Rhodes.
“I know.”
"Alright."
"I have to catch up on some projects," he said.
Steve didn’t think he’d be missing them so soon.
He licked his lips.
“You need to sleep."
*****
“Jarvis?” said Steve.
He studied the map before tapping his fingers against Denmark. She didn’t know much about the country maybe that’s a good thing. She went to one of the large stacks of books. They’d accumulated over time. Lena kept giving them to her and bother with taking them back. She pulled a geography book from the bottom of a stack.
“Really?”
“If I research and find proof that broccoli is gross will stop trying to make me eat it?”
“Yes, it’s preferable to have my subjects close at hand. But I still have a higher level of control over them than a mindless ape like you will never possess. All it takes is a single word, and they'll be at my beck and call. Why not let them gather information for the time being."
"Frozen," said Piper.
“We’re getting married.”
"You need it more than me. You're feeding a super powdered embryo," said Tony. It was easier to think about it that way. A pup was terrifying. A grouping of cells that didn't even amount to the size of a poppy seed was nothing to worry about.
Piper slid down from the chair. No one would want her. They all wanted the little girl that was gone, not her.
"I have to go, sweetheart. You'll be able to call you whenever you wish very soon."
He’d spent less than a day with Tony, and he was already thinking of him in that way. It was only his heat making him see things in such a way. He had to find the alpha.
"We need a big pot," said Steve.
“Do you know why Winter escaped?”
“Winter!”
“Mmm?”
“The Stark girl,” replied Henry.
“What’s the assignment?” he asked eagerly.
“I love you,” promised Helmut, reassuringly.
"What are you doing?" asked Tony.
“I’m sorry that I interrupted. It looked like it would have been a wonderful night,” said Phil.
“Morning Tony,” said Steve.
“Dr. Star is on her way up,” said Jarvis.
“Piper, we are kids. I want to be a kid,” said Rune softly. He wasn’t sure what they were treated like before, but he was sure that wasn’t how it was supposed to be for people their age.
“It was there.”
“They are this organization’s most powerful weapons. Their location should be known at all times.”
“In the closet, there should be something he wore in the hamper.”
“Three times now you’ve scared me.”
"Did it hurt? When I was given the serum, it felt like flesh was being ripped from my bones," said Papa.
“I’ll take lead,” said Steve.
On the third try, she accepted the bottle. He went to the couch. Tony chuckled. Fourteen years ago he never imagined he would be doing this and be happy about it. Top Gear played as he fed her. She finished the bottle. He grabbed a clean dishtowel, throwing it over his shoulder, then burped her. He chuckled at his daughter's eyes widen at the vroom of cars on the TV. She yawned. He laid her on the couch and changed her. Piper soon fell asleep in his arms.
Steve traced the outline of his arc reactor. “It’s hard to think of you without this."
“How else do you explain it?” asked Steve.
He wanted to hurt the alpha. And they seemed to hit their mark.
"It was a quiet night, but she'll be waking up soon enough." On cue, she jabbed against him. "Morning little one."
“Put on the suit lets find out,” said Steve. He needed Tony safe. If that meant by force so be it. He wasn’t going to lose him.
“You’re only saying that to annoy me. Jarvis."
“Yes, how did you know?” asked Thor.
“Neema,” greeted Natasha.
“I’m also the god of fertility. Blessed several a maiden with child in my youth,” said Thor proudly.
“This is my first time away from her,” said Winter, imitating a Scottish accent perfectly.
“He isn’t."
Steve bit his lip as a hard blunt pressure pushed into him. He moaned as the alpha sunk deeper.
“What makes you think that?” he asked.
“I won’t be sure until I meet him,” said Steve.
He hadn’t heard Tony return to their room.
Steve nodded. He let her take his arm.
“The sooner Tony and you claim each other as mates, the better. It’s been proven that a healthy mate bond leads to healthier newborn pups,” continued Edith.
Fury took a large stack of files from a suitcase. “These should tell you all you need to know on your team. Tomorrow you’ll meet Agent Coulson. If you need anything, ask one of the agents."
"That's Natasha. Come in."
She shook her head so Steve joined her on the floor. Piper offered him Plats, the platypus lovey Peggy gave her. Piper only offered up her treasured toy when she thought someone was having a bad day.
'Why didn't you step in sooner?"
“Yes, but Barton can handle himself.” Natasha thought of Piper as her own. Even more so than Clint’s pups. She could fit herself into a mothering role without overstepping.
Tony cringed at the idea. They went to his office, taking a seat in the small waiting room.
He burped her. Her brow furrowed slightly before a look of relief spread through her, followed by a stink. He laid her on the towel and changed her.
“He won’t faint,” defended Steve. Besides, he was nowhere near ready to tell Tony.
Piper pressed even closer into Theodore’s leg, relaxing only slightly as Theodore’s hand went through her hair. Quietly saying I’ll protect you. At least that’s the intention she picked up on.
Steve hated the waiting. He paced the room with Piper in his arms. He didn’t want to put her down. She’d long since fallen asleep. Strapped to his back was his shield. This was the first time he’d taken up since Piper was born. This was a worthy reason, protecting his mate and their child.
“Yeah, a bit of a shocker for me,” said Steve, running his fingers nervously through his hair.
He took Steve’s hand. A car was waiting for them. It was about the two-hour drive into Rio. Steve had no idea what Tony had planned. He was exhausted he might not have the active symptom of heat, but he was lethargic symptoms. He'd perfectly happy sitting by the pool or beach. While here he should take the chance to explore the country, but he was just so damn tired.
"Do you want it? I won't make you keep it. I'll go with whatever you want."
“Is today one of those days?” he asked.
He wanted a three-year-old to learn how to use firearms? Even to her, that seemed beyond idiotic. Even in these circumstances.
They were lead to a room with two massage tables. Steve turned away as Natasha disrobed and wrapped a towel around herself before laying on the table.
Their hour crawled by slowly.
“I’m not sure what to think of you, Piper. With your guard up, I can’t deem whether it’s reasonable or not. I know only the very basics of your situation. But I know you’re in mourning. It seems that you haven’t given yourself time to mourn.”
“You won’t tell,” said Steve.
Steve was spending the winter holiday with Tony. He enjoyed all the quality time. Their fight was a distant memory. They were currently enjoying a late breakfast.
“Oh, yeah hi. They told me you would be coming,” he said, shaking Steve’s hand.
Tony searched for signs.
“What an unsuspecting package for something so powerful to come in. No one will see you coming.”
The two bots happily entertained her. Every time she tossed a toy they'd go rushing after it. Sometimes Tony had to break up fights between bots over who returned the toy to her.
“I’ll get them something,” said Steve.
“Tony, what was that about?” asked Steve.
Steve frowned he didn’t want to leave, but he had to go back.
"There are two. Dr. Caroline Bloom and Dr. George Wong. I believe they'd be the best equipped to handle whatever trauma Piper endured. I can call them if you like," said Turner.
*****
“What would?”
The alpha woke up. Before he had a chance to speak Tony’s lips were on his. He relaxed into the kiss, leaving his worries behind. Tony broke the kiss, letting their foreheads touch.
“Have you figured out what you wanted to do?” asked Tony. Steve was quiet. “Then what’s there to talk about?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Steve, can I borrow your phone my battery is dead?” she asked.
“Sorry, Natasha."
“I accept this part of you. This isn’t a step backward," reassured Steve.
"How bad was the attack? It must have been relatively minor if he's already back on his feet. But it won't hurt to keep an eye on him. From a medical standpoint you have no reason to worry about him," said Edith.
He sighed in relief. “Thank you, Jarvis."
Piper nodded taking it without hesitation.
“Shame, I would have caught him.”
"For you, I'll make an exception."
“You punched a crater in a cement wall,” said Clint.
“I’ve done many things, but I’ve never lied to you.”
“You okay?” she asked.
“Even at full speed it's an eighteen-hour flight,” said Fury.
“He’s hiding something from me,” said Tony.
*****
Natasha smirked he was cute sleeping.
“Stand down.” Fury strode into the room. "This is the boy you saved?"
“Mr. Stark.”
“Your fault. You spazzed me out.”
“Pipes.”
"I never said he wasn't," said Steve.
"Tony, let's just get her out of here." Steve knew they would have to discuss it, but now all he wanted was to enjoy the fact that they had their daughter back. He took off his coat wrapping it around Piper, making sure to cover her face in case she woke up. There was no need for her to see this. They hurried back to the entrance.
Steve was about to cry. Tony couldn't take the crying. "I'll go get some pickles is there anything else you want?"
“You were sleeping.”
(July 21, 2013)
“You.”
"Please, be careful."
“Genius, billionaire, philanthropist, oh and your alpha,” he said.
The doctor took her leave. Tony went up to the penthouse where his mate was waiting. Steve was statute still waiting on the couch.
“Be still.”
“What does that matter?! You only see me as a replacement for my father,” he yelled.
“How old was he?” he asked.
She screamed.
“Why do you think that?”
“Are you going to throw him away?”
She sniffled but then smiled. “Would your drones be able to find his body?”
They got out. Steve nervously touched one of the many bruises decorating Tony.
“I’M COMING!”
Piper glared at the woman. She implied her friend was an idiot. He was much smarter than the few normal children she'd spent time with.
“I’ll leave you be,” she said.
“Papa!”
The suits hovered around them, awaiting commands.
“Talk therapy is the best treatment option,” said Barny.
“Huh?”
“Bullshit! You’ve been going back and forth. Letting me close only to shove me away for days,” said Tony.
“To see what it’s all about, but I can’t allow you to stay while the appointment is in session,” he said.
The demigod burst into the room without hesitation.
"And you'll have it," said Tony.
“No.”
"Give me a few years with you and this one, then we can discuss having more," said Tony.
“Daddy is coming home today.”
She called for her parents several times, before realizing they couldn't possibly hear her. And even if they did, would they answer?
May 14, 2012
"You wanted to be with your pregnant fiancé instead of your bachelor party.”
“I’ve got her,” said Steve, turning off the TV.
“But.”
It had been a week since Lena's arrival. The beta’s behavior since her arrival was normal. Lena seemed to be a mother simply enjoying her time home. Yet, something made Nat maintain her ruse, and she still drove to Playmart a few days a week. She hadn’t had the opportunity to speak with Carl yet. After this mission, she would never go to such a place again. Children were a menace. Clint's kids and Piper were the exceptions to the rule.
“That we spent your heat together,” said Tony.
“It’s rare seeing him like that,” said Natasha.
“It doesn’t matter. I mean it does, but not in this sense. You’re still the man for the job,” he said.
"Ready to get."
“Easy," warned Tony.
“Of course you didn’t!”
“No, I just got back from a late shift,” said Kate.
Steve let himself in. Barny was in the middle of paperwork.
“Sir, the Mark 7 isn’t ready for deployment yet,” said Jarvis.
“Yes, he was considered a genius of the field.”
"Good to know," said Steve.
Her eyes began closing again after she finished off half the bottle. He walked back to the bedroom.
“I hope so.”
“You’re not sorry.” Steve narrowed his eyes.
"Next time we get together I'll bring beer. What brand do you like?" she asked.
Rune stared at the man. That's all he wanted? And he was asking instead of just taking what he wanted. It was weird but a good weird.
“What do you want for breakfast?” asked Tony.
“The Maldives,” said Tony.
“You’re missing the point. There’s no throne. There’s no version of this where you come out on top. And maybe your army comes and maybe it’s too much for us, but it’s all on you. Because if we can’t protect the Earth, but you can be damn well sure that we’ll avenge it,” said Tony.
Tony stared at the beautiful picture below him. Those powerful legs were spread, for him, neck bared in submission. Omega began whimpering for him. He moved atop of the beautiful creature. Tony ran lapped at his omega’s neck slowly traveling down the omega’s stomach. He licked Steve arousal.
“Don’t make anything has the possibility to explode.”
“I did.”
*****
“This is your choice, Piper.”
“Is this Tony Stark?”
He was tired of biologists. With Bruce and Edith, he was out of his element, with Steve it was easy. They settled on the couch. Jarvis put on the nature channel. Tony hadn't watched the news for days. He didn't want to be reminded of the portal. It already ate away his nights. Tony got out the nesting couch when it got late. He needed to sleep in an actual bed. His back as killing him from all those nights on the ground.
“Yes, that’s a no,” he said.
“On your way home?” asked Tony.
“I’m not a child. I’m capable of reading,” he said.
Steve continued to tug against the fabric.
“Huh?"
“STEVE!” Natasha ran to him. His eyes were closed but he was breathing. Bits of shrapnel of varying sizes were embedded in his abdomen. Third-degree burn covered his arms. Clint joined her.
*****
“Shh, you’ll wake her.” He lowered her into the playpen. The two bots surrounded the pen, staring at her. Tony dove into his most recent project. Only pausing to tend to Piper.
"Thank you I'll eat it later."
“Winter, you gotta fight back! I can't...I can't help you!"
"They are with me. They've all been thoroughly vetted by S.H.I.E.L.D. and approved by Natasha. Introduce yourselves, ladies," said Edith.
"For being here."
“I’ll get you a better latter for you, Piper.”
“Back to Oprah, when does this happen?” asked Steve.
“Is this guy bothering you?”
He stopped, not sure why he was doing this. Winter shook his head again, avoiding the thought. More questions kept popping up. Who was she? ‘Piper’ rung in his head; that was her name. What was she doing here? Why was she with him? Why did he want to protect her? He watched her sleep.
“But she’s Dr. Zemo’s most prized subject. Zemo’ll kill us if the kid is damaged,” said Jeff.
“Why can’t he stay with you?” asked Pepper.
“As much as I’d love to no,” said Steve.
“ALPHA!” His muscles tensed as pleasure washed over him. Steve whimpered hiding his face.
“How was the kiss?” she asked.
Steve went to the front of the jet, watching Tony speed ahead of them before his armor turned invisible.
“Stress isn’t good for your heart, Happy. I’ll be good,” said Tony.
“Is that so shocking?” asked Steve.
“Hydra,” said Steve.
“That’s far enough. You’re not the Mandarin, are you?” He flipped open his facemask.
“The attention this world shows into other’s lives is odd. I don’t understand why reality TV is so popular,” said Thor.
“You don’t have to. I’m your alpha. It’s part of the job!”
“No, Tony is making breakfast,” said Steve.
He brushed away the useless bits of information.
“What does Captain America do in his spare time?” asked Tony.
“Nat?”
“You’ll have to lose an arm to be separate from your shield. Release your hand and it will separate. I also wired in a return function in case you’re unable to reach it. To change the color turn the dial,” said Tony.
“When did you do that?” Steve was surprised.
“Really, Steve?”
“What? Look at you watching them? Flip the screen. Then we can get started.”
Steve relaxed when he saw his mate. “Piper?!”
Tony struggled to connect two wires intricately enmeshed into a suit. His hands wouldn't stop shaking. And he’d become so used to Piper reaching over to do this type of delicate work … but, he couldn’t think about that. After the tenth failed try, he threw the project from his desk. It crashed to the ground, the harsh sound reverberating throughout the room.
"Do you think Killian knew this would happen?" asked Steve.
“I know, but my hands are tied. She claims they were threatening her family. We can't disprove that. If I had an ID from the Stark girl, I could proceed. I trust you'll be able to get that."
“It is."
"You have previous experience with this sort of thing. You were a star in your time," said Bruce.
“You sure?”
Piper nodded.
“He was an idiot,” he said.
“No, he’s just another alpha ass hole. Would you go back for them?” asked Rory.
Tony's suspicion of Edith would only grow worse as he got further along; it was the protective alpha instinct.
He wanted to go public but on their terms. Some idiot exposed them with a smartphone. He pressed against Tony.
Steve nodded. Tony had to be fine. He took a deep breath. He wouldn’t get worked up. Tony needed him, breaking down couldn’t be option now.
“Anything to help him.”
“I’ll be down as soon as she’s out,” said Steve.
"Anyway, kid what do you want you like for Christmas?"
Rhodes was quick to get out of the car and regain his breath. “Knowing you has taken years off my life,” he said.
Of course, alphas like that still existed. It was too much to hope they were gone. Alphas like that were no fan of him.
The kid shot off a potato shattering a jar behind him.“And now you’re out of ammo."
“Tomorrow, you’ll start training Piper,” Lena told Winter.
“He’s alive,” said Fury.
He failed in protecting his best friend. Would he fail in protecting his pup as well if he were to have one? It wasn’t a risk worth discovering.
“Then all this was just a precaution. If not well, you’ll find out.”
"What else is there?" asked Pepper.
The timbre of his voice sent a shiver down Steve's back. He hit back a moan. "Slick drenched shorts."
“Then what? You can tell me,” said Steve.
“So it's been a while,” he said.
“I will be filling in for Lena while she’s gone. Go about your training session as normal.”
“Jarvis.”
“Your heat,” he said.
Breakfast was always oatmeal with blueberries, whole grain toast with butter and jam, fruit, bacon, scrambled eggs, and a glass of water. Lunch was several peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, with smooth peanut butter and grape jam, apple slices, chicken nuggets, and milk. This was dinner. Dinner was mash potatoes, green beans, meatloaf, broccoli, and a glass of milk. Everything here was always the same. There was no change. It was a pattern. A stupid pattern that helped her keep her sanity. It only meant something to her. Piper started crying.
“Do you want me to come with you?” asked Happy.
He went rigid but followed the command.
Steve shoved it in his back pocket.
"Rune?" said Piper.
“It must have been difficult for him,” said Steve. He couldn’t imagine being separated from his mother at that age.
"How did this happen?" asked Tony.
Steve pulled away. Hand in hand, they explored the exhibits. Tony tolerated his curiosity. So much had been added, since he was last there. There was so much to see. The hours ticked by quickly. Happy honked impatiently.
"I might not have experienced what you did in there, but I know what it feels to be alone," said Steve.
“You aren’t listening, Tony. He
Lena returned to the room. Observing the changes taking place with her subjects. This was a shift in their dynamics. This was a big step in cementing Winter’s trust in the pup.
"Alright, what are you planning, sir?"
“One of the techs at S.H.I.E.L.D. can fix that, or you could use it as an excuse to see Stark,” said Natasha.
“Welcome back to the land of the living.”
“Don’t change on my account,” she said.
“Listen, the Pentagon is scared. After New York aliens come on, you need to look strong. Stopping the Mandarin is priority but it's not-
The drive home was quiet. Steve watched Piper sleep. There was something so calming to watching her.
“No problem. Jarvis will put the address in the bike’s GPS,” said Tony.
“Morning, Phil."
“Hello? Who is this?” said a groggy voice.
“He shouldn’t. I assessed the situation, determined it was safe enough for me to handle. I can defend myself. Winter taught me well.”
"She'll report it. When she does S.H.I.E.L.D will too."
“It’s a stabilizing agent. Means the portal won’t collapse on itself like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.,"
*****
“I’ll give it a try,” said Tony.
*****
Tony turned in his chair. He didn’t have time for this.
“Waking up to this more than makes up for the early morning,” said Tony.
Steve took Tony’s hand, following him to the elevator. His face heated. Tony laughed.
“You can’t avoid him forever,” said Jarvis.
“Rune?” She touched his hand. He twitched as if he expected her to hurt. Piper pulled her hand away.
The mixed scent of their arousal lay heavy in the air. He rolled his hips to meet the rhythm set by the alpha. Their skin glistened with sweat. Ever so often their lips met. This was his alpha. His legs wrapped around Tony's waist bring him closer. Moaning as Tony pulled his hair, tilting his head back to further deepen their kiss. The pace changed becoming animalistic, their need for each other outweighing everything else.
"Still nice, though," said Piper.
Tony yanked him into a kiss that made him go weak in the knees.
"I've discovered something interesting on S.H.I.E.L.D's database," said Jarvis.
“That’s his MO, isn’t it? What are we a team? No, no we’re a chemical mixture that makes chaos. We’re a time bomb,” said Bruce.
Tony watched the footage. When reached the part discussion on drawers he smirked at the possessiveness Steve displayed. It was perfect. He tensed when he reached the subject brought upon by Natasha of Steve taking him off the market permanently. Was he ready to give up the playboy life? It had lost its thrill. Before Steve, he always thought if he were to settle down it would be with Pepper, but that was before Steve. He'd always had difficulty picturing that life with her. Pepper was getting old for pups and couldn’t produce an heir for him. A terrible shitty thought even by his standards but it was true. Steve, on the other hand, would be forever fertile due to his cellular build. Tony shook his head it far to early for him to be even thinking about pups. Shit, when did he ever think about having pups? He needed an heir. That was half the reason Howard had him. If he turned out omega or female he may have had siblings. Before now a child seemed so vague, but now a deep part of him craved it. It was all hypothetical. He’d hadn’t even said those three words yet. They weren’t easy for him. If Steve said them it would make them easier. He truly did care for the omega more than he could ever admit.
Tony could handle himself against whatever that thing was. Steve joined up with Clint and Natasha, taking cover by a cab.
Lena emptied her pockets. She dropped several pens, some crumpled pieces of paper and a pack gum to the floor. From this distance, Piper couldn't see the language the ingredients were written in. She had to get closer if she wanted to get any idea of where she was. Piper took a breath before stepping out from behind Theodore. The alpha tried tucking her behind him again.
“Carla Reyes.”
Tony woke alone, on the loveseat. “Steve?”
"I don't know yet. Do you think I can do it?" She needed someone to believe in her.
"I've glowing green eyes before," said Clint.
“A stunning woman with dazzling blue eyes and long blond hair. He seemed to form a type after meeting you. She was one of the few people who could handle Howard’s bullshit on a daily basis,” said Peggy.
“Sir, I’m afraid he’s insisting,” warned Jarvis.
Tony kissed him. “I thought I lost the two you."
“More than worth it. Remind me to buy you some proper lingerie," he said.
She left Daddy, believing he’d be okay, going to Papa’s studio. Turning the knob door only to find it was locked. She pressed her ear to the door, hearing nothing worrying. She took a pen from her overall pocket, unscrewing it and quickly using it to pick the lock. She quietly opened the door. Papa was asleep on the couch.
“May I flip one?” she asked.
“There’s no crime in looking,” he said.
Tony shook his head. He doubted the kid believed in that, for now, he could along with the story, instead of telling the true reasoning behind the shadows.
“Want company?”
“Sure is.” He put down his glass and took the seat beside her. “Alright, where’d you like to start?”
“It’s isn’t always that simple.”
“You're my mate. How can I not be happy?” said Tony.
She whined burrowing under the covers. Steve gently shook her awake.
"Don't worry, I can't control it. It responds to your hormone and pheromones levels and those around you. Protects from undesired bonding. Stark Industries has made thousands of them. But yours is unique. Hopefully, you'll never have the opportunity to discover them."
“Who?”
“Let’s get back to Horton,”
“We’ll see you tomorrow, Doc.”
Steve finally calmed down enough to come out of the shower. He wrapped a towel around his waist. Steve toweled dried his hair. He smiled when saw his toothbrush next to Tony’s. Why did the simple sight cause him such joy? He went to the closet to look over the clothes Tony got him. There was enough clothing for him to stay for another week if he wanted. He ran his fingers over the fabric. It was softer than anything in his wardrobe. All the underwear was colorful, including one with an American flag print.
Steve nervously ran his hand nervously through his hair. With all, he was feeling why was guilt among them. What Tony said was true. Even with all his power, he failed to save his best friend. Tony only pointed out what he already knew, but that didn’t stop it from hurting. He hadn’t even looked back. There was such deep regret in his voice, but at the moment he didn’t care. What was he thinking? Tony didn’t care! Steve realized he was shirtless.
“No.”
It may be but they should enjoy while they had the chance.
“Why?”
"That must be, Edith."
Steve paused in his pacing only to punch a large hole in the wall. The turmoil of his anger could be clearly seen in eyes. Along with the deep sadness. He wiped the drywall from his knuckles. His form thrumming with emotion.
"Because that's private between your papa and me. You'll have a similar relationship with your doctor," he said.
“You and Rhodes reminded me of Bucky,” said Steve.
“Don’t close your eyes!” cried Pepper.
"In his workshop."
Tony didn't see the problem. But it was better not to bring it up.
"You need to eat."
"You didn't have a choice, Piper. I'm sure they understood that."
“He’s not here,”
Tony nodded. The alpha wasn't fully there. Christina didn't let her nerves get to her. Edith warned her that Mr. Stark was a difficult man to work with. To her, he seemed a man lost to worry. She needed to get his attention. A single touch to his shoulder was enough to earn that.
“Alphas only say that when they have a disagreeable omega. Who told you that?” she asked.
“Its Zemo’s doing.”
, he was Captain America, the great hero he should have been able to save him.
“True."
“If you need anything, knock,” she said.
“Smaller bites,” said Papa.
"Tony and I need an expert in prenatal studies-
“Howard Stark’s grave,” he said.
“Expert.”
Steve waved. The parents looked stunned. One of the pups came running up Tony.
“Gangster.”
She wished she knew what Daddy did to calm Papa down. Did he have the same problem as Papa? As quietly as possible she left the covers. She sat at a safe distance from the alpha. He growled. She kept her head down and started humming a lullaby. Piper counted down thirty minutes in her head before edging ten inches closer.
“It’s almost over,” hushed Edith in a gentle voice.
“Jarvis, it can wait!” growled Tony.
Large metal parts moved, aggravating the water.
"Nice to meet you too," he said, still not quite sure how to process the woman.
“PIPER!” Steve tensed when he saw Piper with her foot on Bloom’s throat.
“Friend?”
He left and went to the private room given to him by the hospital to wait in. Rhodes was there too.
“A little longer.”
“Papa.” Her voice was groggy.
Steve shook with anger.
They fell asleep on the bathroom floor.
“A romantic weekend in Italy or France,” offered Tony.
“I doubt it, but I’ve recently had some interest in the subject.”
“He has an army called the Chituari. They are not of Asgard or of any world known. He means to lead them against your people. They will win him the Earth. In return I expect for the Tesseract,” said Thor.
She left him to change into the clothes set aside for him. They stayed site for a while, before going to the Romanian division base. They had a staff of twenty people. Ten researchers and ten agents. Luckily, a majority of them spoke English, so Steve had a bit more sense of what was going on. He should have taken another langue in school. Steve and Natasha were given a room to share.
The mug shattered in Steve’s hand. Rhodes wrapped a clean dishtowel around his hand.
"Unless you find a way to control it."
“Ow, that hurts. I get it. I get it. I don't know about any Steve or Pepper. But I do know about the plan," he said.
Steve sat outside the shower listening to the sound of the water. Tony couldn’t spy on him here. He ran his fingers through his hair. His chest was uncomfortably tight. He managed to collect his breath. The water stung his skin. He wasn't sure how long he stayed there. A jolt went through when the water went cold.
Steve woke up first, glaring at the clock on the table. It was four in the morning. He moved his head from his pillow, wiping the drool from his chin. He could go for a run, shower and start on breakfast. He changed into gym shorts. A few laps around the estate would be enough.
The omega shook out of the trance but was distant. Steve took a shaky breath.
“I’ve done terrible things, and I’m not foolish enough to believe there’s no blood on my hands. Part of my reason for joining S.H.I.E.L.D. is to make up for what I’ve done,” said Natasha.
“Yes,” said Steve.
“Jarvis, find me a soft spot,” said Tony.
"Take care of all Happy’s medical arrangement. I want him given the best care possible.”
He glanced at the pup.
Tony flopped onto his back when his knot released. Steve moved to his side and huddled close to him, hiding his face in the alpha's neck.
“You aren’t used to compliments are you?”
Lena replayed the footage of Piper’s episode.
“Where's he going?” asked Rhodes.
Tony laid a soft blanket on the floor and spread a few toys out on it. He took Piper setting her down on the blanket. She tried crawling toward a plaything of interest. Piper was figuring out crawling, so she didn't get too far.
He came closer.
"You choose what path you take, Tony. It may have the same begin, but that doesn't mean it's the same. You can decide where this goes or how fast you take it. Tony, you know what's important. You won't get lost. And if by some chance you do I'll find you."
The loneliness settled as the realization his alpha was gone hit him. Steve groaned flopping back into the pillows. He wasn't used to being needy. It was crippling. He was an independent man tried to be even before the serum. His biology was a set limitation he fought successfully as much as possible most of his life, but those years of built-up control faltered in front of his chosen alpha, Tony Stark.
“Not yet.”
Tony sighed when he saw Rhodes waiting in the kitchen. He made himself a cup of tea.
“You’re sure,” he said.
“Can’t smell your heat,” she said.
“What your plan, Steve. To ignore it?”
“What’s her history with Rumlow?”
“LOKI!”
"You'll find a way to connect with her," reassured Tony.
“What do you want for lunch?”
“The odd thing is, sir, before now, your blood pressure hadn’t been an issue. Not since 2008.”
“And I’ll wake you up then.”
“I know you’re sorry, but you don’t regret your actions fully,” said Steve.
“Ready to go?” asked Tony.
“It’s fine,” said Tony with a shrug.
“Be good,” said Lena as she left the room, door locking behind her.
Steve came out of the bedroom shirtless. His hair damp. “What were you talking about?”
“You don’t know what it means.”
“How would I know that?” said Matt.
“I thought no sugar before bed,” she said.
“Honey, that wasn't a challenge,” said Tony.
“I wish I could. I’ll call you as soon as I get back,” said Steve.
“Sir returned to bed at 3:00 am.”
“Why am I here, and not looking for my daughter?”
“How much longer?” he asked.
He dressed and kiss Tony goodbye. Steve went to the garage. He grabbed the keys for Barb. He didn’t want to risk Vivien’s trackers reporting where he went. Steve needed privacy. There was a Walgreens on the way to S.H.I.E.L.D. Steve was in the aisle in the convenient store completely overwhelmed at the moment. He took a random box from the shelf and went register.
Steve took Tony’s hand, leading him to his nesting couch. He coiled the blankets around them. “I love you, Tony.”
“Tony sent me art supplies. He wanted to give me a chance to continue my art career,” said Steve.
"If that's what you like," said Thor.
“Not even you will get that out of me,” said Steve.
