Loki nodded and followed after the smaller man. Loki wanted to see the Temptress of Jane and Jane herself he liked Jane. That’s why he had tried to split her up from Thor. Thor the fool loved dearly, but a human woman would not have been able to survive him if Odin had turned Thor into what he had dreamed.
Loki relaxed slowly and in an act that showed how touch starved he was he whined softly closing his eyes. Natasha’s eyes glinted with rage, but her tone let none of that show.
The news came on just as Steve was finishing. “In other news last night in New York, it has been confirmed that Spiderman prevented villain named Tomes from stealing a stash of alien technology from Tony Stark."
Tony,
Loki returns the kiss before slipping back into the car. “Let’s stop at the McDonalds drive-through,” Wanda suggested to Sam, “I’ve been telling Loki about iced coffee for ages now.”
Sam hesitated and then jogged off with a wave. Natasha dropped back against the couch with a dramatic sigh. “I should make Tony get me a fainting couch so I can collapse whenever I deal with fools.”
Sam bopped his nose. “You didn't, you know exactly what I said and you’re using subversion tactics to start a conversation.”
The rest of the Avengers jumped out of their seats all yelling congratulations at once. They ignored the interviewer who turned to the camera. “Thank you for tuning in today I’m Daniel Fox from CNN I’d say god bless, but I think he already has.”
“Nah the best was Jake, and his husband made a pretty good Bucky too,” Steve argued.
“You’ll know as soon as you see him,” Steve answered staring up at the roof, “and if it helps it’s not you he’s scared of. He’s scared of failure and of losing you, and the rest of us again. He wants us to succeed as much as we do.”
“You talk on the phone every day,” Bucky pointed out, “it's not like you haven’t talked in a month.”
Loki climbed in beside him and winced. “My magic has a mind of its own. If it feels neglected it will entertain itself.”
“We are giving you hell tomorrow,” Bucky corrected pulling the blankets over all three of them and wrapping them both up in his arms.
“It was a date,” Steve asked.
“Brooklyn,” Steve smiled and then ran off before he could say something more embarrassing.
“It made me happy to spend time with him,” Loki admitted.
Clint threw his empathy coffee cup at them. “Shut up already. Geez. I thought the European trip would have gotten you out of this.”
Loki jerked at the female-sounding voice that came through the room. “She’s installed through the house, and talks and see through cameras in the room.”
You didn’t listen to me when I told you how much he means to me. You didn’t listen to me when I chose to retire rather than sign the accords. That was my right and you decided to try and take that anyways. I tried to warn you of a bigger problem than the accords and you didn’t care. You didn’t want to listen.
“Why are they framed like this,” Peter pressed.
Tony gulped this time. “Not anymore,” he yelled back.
“Not the best idea,” Sam answered as Loki sat at the edge of the bed, “do you want to do anything tomorrow?”
Wanda stood up her eyes wide. “Tony,” she muttered reaching for his shoulder.
“Of course you did. What should we know about him.”
Tony sighed and shut the door Loki had left open. Sam’s internal reaction was to tell him to leave the door how Loki left it, but he didn’t. “I’m going to go check on Bucky,” Sam announced.
“What kind of name is Lo,” Alex asked, “and Sam eggplant means dick.”
The three men. Three giants smiled. Sam and Bucky both threw their arms around Cap’s shoulders. “You hear that Punk,” Bucky snorted, “I think he likes you.”
She nodded. “Hello Sam,” she greeted.
“Again,” F.R.I.D.A.Y sighed and it started playing.
“I suppose I am,” Steve agreed, “just with a hint of melancholy.”
She kept pulling, Not hard just enough to make Loki follow her. “You kind of look like an elf, but the Lord of The Rings kind,” Darcy continued,
Peter made an O gesture. Loki didn’t get a chance to explain himself before Mj and Furry walked in. They were silent. The Barton children squealed and jumped at Fury. Furry knelt down to wrap Cooper and Lillia into his arms. He kissed their cheeks before balancing one on each hip and standing up. Jesus the man did not act his age. Mj sat on the sofa next to Peter. “You could look a little happier to see me,” Nick pointed out.
Sam looked up at the ceiling. “I’ll need to ask him about his dietary needs,” he pondered.
“So Steve’s said,” Tony stated.
“You’re giving the suit back,” Happy exclaimed.
Then Sam arrived. Peter got to join Tony out to greet the newly arrived superhero this time. Sam had already been back in the states for a week. He had to go see his family before he came home. So Peter was bouncing up and down asking Wanda questions about what Sam was like because he was the Falcon and how cool was that?
Tony: Yeah sure, I’ll have Happy bring something up to you. Any request?
Tony’s eyes widened with surprise. “Of course I want you around,” he announced unsure of what he was saying.
“Of course,” Rhodey agreed, “and if you need help with any of this or anything I’m always here.”
“I guess I can’t really argue with that,” he agreed.
For his part, the man in his lap shook his head and chuckled. Steve reached down to line himself up and pressed the head of his cock to the Omega’s entrance.
“We have multiple rooms of Omegas ready and waiting. I will warn you that some of the rooms have Omegas that are in heat,” the man said, stepping back out in the hallway with Steve just behind him. “I could narrow it down for you?”
"Naw, it's fine, look."  Tony walked over and grabbed the chain cage to pull it apart before Sam could stop him, then immediately dropped to the ground, convulsing.
"Great, sounds like a party," said Tony, taking a swig from his bottle.  Pepper's lips tightened a little and she set a glass on the counter in front of him a little harder than necessary.
A hand in the audience flew up.  "...does conversion actually--"
, I thought-- Christ...."  Tony grabbed the edge of a table to stabilize himself, reaching up to press a hand to his arc reactor, panting.
Jesus Christ, if Natasha could read his internal thoughts right now...
"Steve?" whispered Bucky.
Donner's fragile confidence had wilted and he sat curled on the edge of the couch, arms over his bulging stomach, watching silent and wide-eyed.
"...Sam's a good guy.  Anyways, he's into other Alphas," said Tony.
And now they were all dead. Steve swallowed down the lump in his throat, eyes flitting to Bucky. There didn't look anything wrong with them. He looked fine. Was Natasha right in saying he was sick after Zola?  That the experiments performed on him in the POW camp had messed him up somehow, ruined their bond?  Or had Steve managed to save him in time?
"MAY!  SHIELD!" he yelled, throwing out his hands.
He tossed the cigarette to the ground and put it out with the toe of his shoe, suddenly aware he was gasping shallowly.
"Absolutely not," said Tony immediately.  He hated hospitals.  Hated the idea of being poked and prodded, his arc reactor stared at.  Pepper knew it and she didn't push it; Tony certainly had head trauma but he was conscious and seemed, for the most part, lucid; it would do more harm than good to forcibly drag him to the doctor.
Across the room, one of the robots whirred and clicked a few times with excitement at the recognition of its name.
sweet. He dressed in running gear, knowing Tony would still be in the lab. Then he went up to the gym. Steve didn't fancy risking going outside, even parts of the beach would be probably deserted. The conference had gone well, technically, but had still been a very harrowing experience. Sex and work might be Tony's outlet, but Steve's was definitely exercise.
looking for you, Erica is here from Natick Labs and has some interesting ideas on synth fibers for your newest project.  ...oh, Ms. Everhart, how do you do?  ...please excuse us for just a moment..."
It was calming, hearing his own words read out by the AI.  "
"Yes."  The soldier felt confused.  "Yes. I..." He couldn't remember.  Suddenly he felt worried. Was he allowed to be having this conversation?  "You're not authorized to be here."
One hand up to shade his eyes from the sun, he opened his hand, waiting for Steve to throw him sunglasses and a bottle.  If there was one thing Tony's house had an abundance of, it was alcohol, prescription sunglasses, and, now, orchids.
Friend?  What the hell did that mean?  Did that mean they needed him to kill someone?
Steve looked up. Was Tony saying something? Had he been? He wasn't listening. He realised he wasn't breathing properly, his eyes red rimmed around the edges.
"I mean, probably. But if I enjoy something I'm not going to question it Tony," Steve said, trying to ignore how his cheeks were still pink.
That was something Steve couldn't get over...pictures. How easy they were take now and how accessible. How a person could carry around over a thousand of them just on their phone. It was amazing how easy it was to preserve memories nowadays, Steve thought. Back in the forties photographs had been precious and certainly not readily available. They'd made the soldiers feel like movie stars when they turned up with cameras and made them pose and line up in rows. But then they would go out into battle and that feeling would quickly fade away.
"My pleasure, sir.  I've placed your order," said JARVIS.
Sam was trying not to feel irritated.
"What do you want, horseshoe?" he demanded rudely.  His head felt like it was splitting down the middle and he didn't sit up, worried he might be sick with the pain.
"I don't want to talk about it!"
"Steve," said Tony quietly.  "I know they feel really real.  But they're not. I have them, too.  You're okay."  He pulled Steve to him and hugged him.
"It's on the fourth floor!" called Donner.
Natasha held a hand up to her ear.  "Tony? Tony, come in."
Steve sat down and the tension in the room evaporated.
Tiberius frowned. "You really think so?"
He was.  His hands were like ice.  Pepper rubbed his hand between hers,trying to warm him up.  "I'll get you another blanket," she said, rising. Tony was already under two comforters but he was shivering noticeably.  He'd been acting weird (well, weird

"What'd you mean not yours? I didn't-" began Tony.
treatment."  Tiberius was unable to keep the bitterness out of his voice.
with my bosses, Mr. Stark,” he replied coolly, eyes narrowing a fraction to try and ensure that Tony would, in fact, drop the issue.  “...and Virginia would really like you to try and sleep… sir,” he added.
Phil swabbing down there was
"But this is my lucky horseshoe pin," said Tony.  "It's got nothing to do with omegas."
"Do Alphas go into heat?"
Tony had never heard Pepper use the word "widdle" and he was stunned into silence.
couldn't get drunk anymore, himself.
"Our admiring fans have noticed us," said Tony.  "...you wanna make someone's night and play pool with 'em?  There's a group of four kids over there about your age... we could cut in.  Make teams."
He just wanted to get Tony home, then call Rhodey. Then they'd fix this.
"Yeah." Steve sipped at his own wine. Banksy sniffed loudly next to him. "I think they can too. Boswell was a good guy."
"Isn't he friends with Dennis?" asked Trey.
Blessedly, Pepper was on the phone, yelling at someone from the Department of Defense, which meant Tony didn't have to answer any questions about his limp; he pushed Steve off and leaned on Happy instead, feeling slightly better about having a beta help him than an omega.
"...what is it?" asked Mackenzie after a moment of everyone staring at it.
The small group left the office and took pizza orders from the others as they left. They grabbed coats and then an awkward amount of them pressed into the elevator. Kerry glared at George as he murmured something in her ear as they stepped out of the lift.
"Do you think you can help?" Pepper asked and Steve just shrugged. He tried for a smile and it was broken, his eyes glossing over with a sadness that wasn't entirely his. His voice was small when he spoke up again.
"No exercise?  But Steve
Lying in bed was only appealing because it involved contact with Steve, but that was enough to win Tony over.  He could do some of his work from a tablet anyway.
"Guys."
"There's no useful intel in it," Sam said quietly. "And it doesn't make for nice watching." He'd pulled it from the director's computer, but after taking time to watch it on the jet ride back to base, he wished he hadn't. There was no solid information in it and the only significant part is when Bucky tries to mount Steve.  Something no one had a right to see.
She pulled Steve into a tight hug. He laughed softly.
"Why didn't you say you were dying?" He asked, voice so gentle the morning breeze almost stole the words.
, Steve thought dryly.
He was having trouble forming coherent words, or thoughts.  Steve was so sinfully good at this. And this was all for him.  This was something only they shared; Steve and Bucky had never gotten past first base, as far as Tony was aware.
Steve usually had rules, to help tackle the drinking.  Like no drinking in the bed, for example.  Steve refused to sleep with Tony if it seemed like he was drunk; he didn't like enabling what was clearly a problem, and also, it didn't feel fair, watching Tony get sloshed when
"Let's hope it's an omega, then," said Tony.  "Name the kid after an ancestor, why don't you?  You said Steve's dad was your great-uncle... how 'bout that?  Joseph?
Tony dipped down and ran his tongue over Steve's entrance.  Steve was still slick, and his wetness tasted not at all dissimilar to a woman's; Tony tugged Steve a little closer and began lapping at his hole, closing his eyes contentedly as he ate Steve out.
"No."  Tony considered.  "Not on purpose, anyway.  Two male Alphas creeps me out, yeah.  But that's my problem. Not yours."
"That's weird.  He and Boswell seem to have one of those overly perfect, really conventional couples.  How old's Boswell, anyway? Must be well into his seventies by now," said Marcus.
Tony wanted to find the guy and exhume the corpse and kill him all over again.
"It's math, Pepper.  In a ratio of two numbers, as one number approaches infinity, the other functionally becomes zero."
"He didn't," Steve assured with her with a wry smile, watching Tony clutch at the pillow with a fond sense of amusement. "And yes, much better. My head doesn't feel like it's going to fall off anymore."
"полковник Карпов," he mumbled.  He opened his eyes but everything was blurry.  He tried to reach, weakly, for his Alpha, but his arms were pinned.  He couldn't feel his left one at all, but the right one was tingling with the pain of being tied down too tightly.  "полковник Карпов," he repeated weakly.  He couldn't remember anything but he knew that he could trust Karpov.  Knew that Karpov would take care of him, tell him what to do.
"Get your head in the game, Stark!" hissed Natasha.
Steve swallowed down a lump in his throat. "Well, even if I can beat up Nazis good, apparently I'm not good at relationships."
"Happy anniversary, Steve."
"Nat, hey," Steve said, running a hand through his hair. His voice was a little rough. "I just need to shower. I can be ready in ten."
He slammed a few shots the moment he was in the shop.  He needed them to steady his hands, calm his nerves. He had 7UMM-E make him a cup of espresso to counter-act that effect, all the while aware that Steve would probably give him one of those disapproving looks if he knew Tony was drinking before a mission.  Granted, maybe Tony was the tiniest bit dependent, but hey, he never claimed to be perfect.
Joey shoved the case into his arms. "Director Fury wants it. I just came to help out."
at him. People glanced twice at post-serum Steve Rogers, sometimes even three times. People hit on him. People tried to kiss him- some of them
"What the hell is this?" One of the medics lifted up the chain that was still attached to his foot with wide eyes.
"Stop fighting it, Stark," commanded Natasha.
Ultimately Tony just hated not being Iron Man.  He was not truly Iron Man; he wasn't a robot, which he felt would be a lot better than being a person.
Steve slithered under the sheets next to him and studied his face.  Tony studied his back, trying not to ogle his body.  Steve's physique was so ridiculously flawless it was almost criminal.  His pecs.  His abs.  God, it was like they'd crossed a beefalo with a linebacker.  Tony was by no means scrawny; he worked out, he boxed with Happy, he dragged heavy equipment all over the lab... he was actually pretty proud of his body.  But next to Steve's, it was nothing.
"Well I don't know what's going to happen, do I? Some of them look...scary," he finished, staring out at the Alphas practically leering in. Seven looked very out of his depth. The paternal part of Steve wanted to pick him right up and carry him out of here already.
March and April passed peacefully, with Steve still working on his omega rights campaigns to abolish conversion camps, and Tony throwing himself into Stark Industries' R&D.  Things were shockingly stable; one night, Tony found himself and Steve in bed, side by side, Tony wearing glasses, the two of them reading quietly together.  He paused to set down his magazine and look over at Steve fondly. "It's like everything just sorta... worked out, huh?" he said. He smiled a little and reached over to put a hand on the back of Steve's neck.  "I'm glad I found you, Steve. You star-spangled son-of-a-bitch." He pushed his glasses up and went back to reading, well aware of the light that glinted off the band on his left hand.
Bizarrely, he thought of the squirrel suit.  It was in coat check. He wasn't wearing pants, but there was nothing they could do about that.
"One for Stark, too!" called Eric after her.  He turned back. "--so, anyway, my issue with adamantium is that the melting point is so damned high that--"
"Thanks.  Means a lot coming from a guy who builds entire suits of armor," said Eric with a smile.  "Oh, excuse me..." The man at the desk had left and Eric walked up, with Piper trailing him.
Tony managed to squirm out of Steve's arms.  "I will in just a second!" he said. A moment later he was going outside to the pool deck and there was a loud splash.
"I have allergies?" asked Tony in amazement, plucking a flute of champagne off a tray from a passing waiter.
"...did you said they want Steve to model?" asked Tony, with a laugh.  "That's ridiculous."
"...the big deal is that he's an omega."
"Bucky.  The Winter Soldier.  I gave Steve up so now he'd going back to his other mate.  All that bullshit about how I'm the only one... yeah. No. He's with Bucky right now.  Bucky's
"Tommy, I really can't--"
"You should come too," Steve said quietly as the doctor pulled back, his leg properly bandaged again like the medic had done on the jet. He offered Pepper a small but grateful smile before they headed up the stairs. She really was a life saver.

"Oh, God..."

Then the face plate came down.

"You don't usually

Tony gritted his teeth and squeezed his eyes shut.  "Shit. What did Steve say to tell you...? Emily, you are beautiful. You were born exactly the way you were supposed to be and that you can do whatever you goddamn want to and anyone who says otherwise can go to hell."
"Yeah," Steve said, a smile tugging at his lips as they all walked out of the learning annex together. The 'Alpha' looked positively mortified. "He is."
"Huh?"  Tony looked down.  He'd begun shredding the nearest thing he could get his hands on: a sweater Pepper had draped over the back of a chair.  He was surprised to see how easily it had torn.  "...the hell?"
Donner looked desperately around the room.  Unused to having a lot of attention on him, and unused to making decisions, he looked like a deer in the headlights of an oncoming car.
"Once we've got lunch," Steve murmured, pressing a kiss underneath Tony's ear. He squeezed his hand lightly as they headed back into their suite.
"I'm not a
Tony wobbled to his feet uncertainly and peered over at the sink.  His stomach flopped. "Ew," he said without meaning to.
Mackenzie winced and got into the car.  "Okay, so... where am I going?"
He got up and crossed the room to grab a bottle of Jack from the bar before settling back down to keep pawing through the materials.  He eventually fell asleep, curled up with the bottle and picture of his mother and Ana trying to get him to hold a tennis racket properly.  In the background, a collared omega was chasing a rogue tennis ball, and all four of them were laughing.
Tony began arranging the tiny pieces of shredded Styrofoam onto the grid on his thigh.  "...you mind if I stay here?" he asked, voice low.
He rose unsteadily, looking around the dim, empty lab.  The technicians were gone.  Tony reached a shaky hand up to run through his hair. No more electrodes, either.
Tony was grinning.  "Yeah, I did. I totally did.  You can charge me, I don't care, I'm rich, it was worth it," he said happily.
"Discipline! It's a talk by Maggie Frond. She's very famous. Got a book and everything, my copy of it's signed."
, Pepper? Did you see how great I looked?"
"SHIELD?" repeated Pepper.  The name had rung a bell when Steve had said it earlier; it suddenly clicked where she'd heard that before.  "Ah.  One of Coulson's people.  I always did like him.  Wait, did you say
Tony kicked the limp body aside and went back to the circuit board hanging out of the wall.
!"  Donner twisted around in his seat, looking terrified.  "No. Please. C-cousin Steve, I want you to stay with me, p-please.  I'm sorry, I'm-- I'm scared. Please stay."
"Oh, sweet Sagan, my head... fuck..."  He squinted at Steve, running a hand through his hair, aware that it was sticking up and he probably looked like hell.  He looked down at the food in front of him.  He felt like he had woken up to another dream.  Everything felt surreal.
Dr. Martin frowned.  "The effects of getting injured over and over again in that suit can be cumulative.  You may feel fine in a week, but you have to consider the long-term consequences on your body.  Frankly, humans aren't designed to sustain the kind of trauma you put yourself through."
"This is insane," he breathed. Steve took the flowers off of Tony and went to set them down on the table. If their honeymoon period was nearly over that meant Steve's first interview was...what? A few days? He suddenly felt nervous. After the expo and his Tony's reveal there would be so many more questions. He hoped he could hold his cool. It was time for him to really make a stand, after all. Steve wouldn't be timid about his civil rights agenda. He was anything but timid.
But Steve had given an order.  And Tony was encased in armor. He was Iron Man, not Tony, not an Alpha, not a human.  Just Iron Man.
It must have been Karpov.
"Hey mate.  It's Union Jack when I'm in the uniform.  Secret identity and all that."
"All read-outs indicate full functioning," said JARVIS.
Tony grunted weakly.
T'Challa let out an irritated huff, the closest thing to a word he had uttered the entire meal.  Tony's gaze flickered over to him. So he
Tony turned, absolutely lost, his dispute completely forgotten.
"Captain?" Fury's voice was calling over the intercom.
"NO!" she yelled from the living room.  "I CAN GET AVICII OR PITBULL."
"Yeah."
?" prompted Pepper.  "Are you such it wasn't
.  But I don't.  Am I making sense?"
"I-I..." It was weird, hearing his own voice again. "I was in the chair," he finally managed to get out. "It hurt. They hurt me. They hurt...him." Steve frowned in thought, struggling to work out the difference himself.
Donner stood up.  "No. No, Steve doesn't go feral in heat.  There's been a mistake." Donner looked petrified to be speaking up.
Steve tapped Tony's thigh playfully. "Oh. Oh my God. Fuck. Sorry. I just... I started thinking about Bucky and Pepper--" And then he was off, laughing again, tears in his eyes. "She would eat him alive.
"You're avoiding the question," accused Tony, accepting the mug from Jarvis and sipping it.  Bitter as fuck.  He winced, wondering how Stane could stand it.  "Are you and Dad bonded?"
The minute they were inside Tony's house, Steve picked him up without waiting for permission. It made his ribs twinge a little but it was only a short walk upstairs to the bedroom.
"Don't be ridiculous.  It's not the Winter Soldier, it's just Tony.  Tony doesn't like people touching his hands or wrists," said Pepper dismissively to Sitwell.
"...Steve?  I didn't wrap your presents, either.  They're down in the lab," said Tony. He paused, then quickly reassured Steve, "Don't worry, it's nothing alive this time.  Well, I mean, it's probably not alive
repeated Tony firmly, confidently.  He wiggled his hips, pressing Steve harder into the couch, seeking more of him.  Steve's body protested at the intrusion of the knot; Tony ignored it, gripping Steve's wrists and biting slightly harder, pressing harder; he could feel Steve's legs shaking, and he heard Steve make a noise when he finally managed to shove the knot into him.
"No, absolutely not," he said gruffly.  Tony watched, fascinated. Seeing Boswell Mackabee in a Santa hat was of more interest to him than speaking to Mariah Carey, who was having a meltdown across the studio because Jeanette had made some last-minute lighting changes to one of the stages.  (The other performer was The Barenaked Ladies. "
For Tony, sex was as much about stress release as it was about actual pleasure.  Steve had figured it out pretty quickly after moving in; if Tony had a hard day in the shop, if his codes weren't working right or he was having trouble building a suit or working on one of the cars, he'd often get grouchy, then quickly redirect his energy into rough sex.  It worked out well for them because Steve, being Steve, could take it. And actually seemed to like it. They happily broke furniture and countertops and knocked over orchids and it was fantastic.
Inside his den, Phil was blasting
him?" Steve hissed and then threw Hammer to the floor before promptly turning to the reporter, kicking the glass of her camera, and shattering it. The woman shrieked in upset.  "Send me the bill." Steve said, dropping Tony onto the ground.  Tony crumpled; Steve offered him a hand up.
"But what do I tell Bucky?" he asked, knuckles white where he held the hotel phone in his hand.
There was no torture they could throw at him that would make him help them.  None.  He was a defense contractor and he was going to defend his plans until his dying breath.  He had set out to make the world a better place, to protect American soldiers, and he'd watched them gunned down like helpless little lambs.
"Now let's get you in the shower..." Steve ushered Tony into the bathroom and then began stripping off himself. He felt bad... he always left his running gear in the bathroom and by the next day it was washed and back in his wardrobe. And if it wasn't, it was the day after that.
"It hurts because, first and foremost, it's infected.  The bonding gland is sensitive and infections of this magnitude are very serious indeed.  Aside from that... your body is trying to reject the bond. Excessive serum production is the body's attempt to, you might say... wash out the gland."
"Okay. Very impressive and all...but your lab safety is terrible." Steve told him fondly; then, before Tony could protest, he picked him up. There was no one else to see it. And sometimes Steve couldn't help but mother him.
"You're so beautiful," mumbled Tony against Steve's lips, his fingertips running over Steve's skin.  His hand ran down's Steve's arm to his waistband; he pushed up Steve's shirt to press a hand against his abs.
you. You've changed my life," she said and Steve really didn't know what to say then. She looked so young and happy. It was weird to think he could be a role model for someone like her. Taylor grabbed the microphone and grinned. "So, can Captain America sing?"
right
"You spent an entire night in that suit, only making the poisoning worse. We really don't have time for chitchat, Mr. Stark," Phil said, polite smile curled onto his lips as always. The guy seemed so sweet but Steve had sparred with him once or twice-- not so sweet.
and started playing soft, soothing music.
before," said Pepper, turning.  Her back to them, she addressed Steve.  "I spoke with Aria yesterday about that gala you two wanted to host for your charity.  We've got six different catering options lined up. As long as you two choose before the end of the year, we could have it off the ground by February."
After a moment, the blond said, "It's a present for you."
thought I'd have a normal holiday... I'm going to miss my flight... ugh... I'm not blaming you, Steve... here, eat this sandwich."  She shoved another bottle of water and a peanut butter sandwich at him. "Gleason says he's on his way, too.  Okay? So this is all under control."
"Tony doesn't like doctors," said Pepper succinctly.  "He's dislocated his right shoulder about six times, and every time, he insists on popping it back in himself."
"...hm."
"...you... you want to come home when you're all healed?"
"He's with the Winter Soldier?" repeated Natasha.
Fury had clearly planned all this out.  Tony and Steve had both been naive for thinking that Fury had given then clearance to go to England to visit Peggy... as usual, he had another agenda.  The meeting with Wisdom had obviously been more as well.
Tony leaned it to nuzzled Steve's throat.  "There's at least one thing I wanna do today," he purred.  Suddenly he paused. "I mean
He laughed. "Sorry." It was a happy sound. "That's a lot to lay onto someone, isn't it? I don't mean to put pressure on you or anything. I'm just grateful...that you've made me think I can find a home here."
"Where's Stark?" demanded Pietro.
"And even if we did breed him, the effect would probably be diluted," added the woman.
"I'm just asking!"
Tony didn't hear her.  He was stared toward the back of the plane.  His arms had broken out in goosebumps.  He felt like he was under some sort of mind control.  He was practically panting; he reached up to loosen his tie.  He felt hot.
"Speaking of plates, where are the stuffed mushrooms?" asked Pepper, snagging one of the caterers.  Steve understood that meant the conversation was over.
"We're going to go to New York, or maybe Los Angeles, or maybe Washington.  Those are the best places to find Stark and Rogers."
"Oh.  Right," said Tony sheepishly.  He'd asked JARVIS for privacy.
"Sure.  Flashbacks, sometimes," said Tony uncomfortable, drawing away a little, his hands still on Steve's waist.  Steve looked confused and unsettled.  Tony hadn't yet seen Steve like this but he wasn't surprised; the guy was a WWII vet, after all.
"Please, Steve, please, I miss you, I love you, you're my omega, let me make you feel good?" begged Tony.  He bounced back onto his feet. "...we're in a drought, it's important to conserve water, come in with me, it's environmentally logical!  Or we can go to the bed! Yeah! I'm done!"
the American flag," Aria said, rolling her eyes as he neatened out Steve's tie for him. She had him in a midnight blue suit and a crisp white shirt underneath with a black tie that was a little on the thin side. He looked well put together; his hair had been re-combed.  It looked no different to Steve but Aria insisted it was "better."
"Is everything a fucking joke to you?" demanded Sam.
Tony grunted again in response, waving a hand weakly at Tiberius.  It was unclear if he was shooing him away or thanking him. Tony's breathing was heavy; Steve was thrusting up slowly, occasionally.  Tony had learned from the last heat that after about 24 hours he was nothing but a dildo for Steve's insatiable appetite. Normally he'd be okay with that idea, except that it was literally physically taxing on him.  And the reminder of their age difference was somewhat unsettling, too.
"Fuuck..." Steve whispered; he slumped against a wall, his vision going hazy.  He watched blearily as Tony's suit ot hit, went flying, and then slammed into the HYDRA agent.  Who was he?  A senior agent?  A colonel or general?  A lead scientist?  He looked important; he wore important clothes, but Steve couldn't concentrate.  If asked to describe him Steve couldn't, except that he was an Alpha; Steve's brain had been hijacked and all he could think of was Alphas.
"You saved our lives," said Pepper, looking over at him.
chest," replied Joey breezily.  He loped over to the car; Steve had his back pressed against the side of it, holding a pistol aloft.  "Oy, Steve! I took care of the snipers."
"I'm going to go now," said Tony, very, very softly.
"...only Alphas can distance bonds," said Tony quietly.  "...did Bucky do that? Or are you two still...?"
Steve groaned as he blinked awake. The room was cold and his chest felt heavy. He could hear voices around him even though his vision was blurry. There were heavy, cold weights around his wrists and ankles like he was tied down and something strapped his head to a cold plate behind him. His eyes darted around wildly, unseeing for now.
"Whatever you want." He rocked his hips forward. Steve's tone dropped to something lower. "I wanna be good for you."
The shield was bulky.
Steve whipped around to see Justin on the stage, his left cheek slowly turning purple. His eyes narrowed and he stalked towards him. The crowd was running past Steve and, thankfully, slowly thinning out.
"...do I wish I could stop thinking?  Yeah. Every day. That's why I drink.  That's why I have sex. It turns my brain off.  Every day, constantly, there's just... so many thoughts.  It's overwhelming. And when I get drunk, I feel... normal, I guess.  I feel like I relate to people better. There's less noise in there."
"I really hope you don't have anymore plans for this evening, Captain."
"My girlfriend got it for me."
"I don't want to think about him anymore," Steve sighed and leaned into Tony's touch, blue eyes flitting to his crotch. "Are you...very sore there? Because if you are we don't have to..."
He remembered Howard joining them once. He had destroyed them, and made one or two comments about Steve at the time. Dum-Dum always used to be about as terrible as Steve was, so it had been fun. Flasworth always insisted that he 'had' to get drunk in order to play at their level.  Steve remembered feeling special, being the only omega in the bar, getting served drinks and being allowed to play parlor games as if he were a normal person.
A week.  Tony turned it over in his mind.  Yeah, he could probably find out a way to fool SHIELD into thinking his brain was safe in a week.
"We didn't have internet," said one of the kids, who clearly thought this was a violation of his basic human rights.
"Where do we meet?" he asked finally.  He felt his misunderstanding of orders was forgivable; if Steve meant for them to be separated then he should give the soldier a rendezvous point.  Furthermore, he wasn't sure how Steve expected to strike out on his own. He was limping, shaking with hunger and exhaustion... he was in no condition to do anything.
"Minor panic attack.  Nothing new," said Tony, face still buried in Steve's chest.  Before Pepper could ask, he added, "Not about the anniversary.  'Bout bonding stuff. I'm okay."
). He left Pepper and Happy backstage, and dared the drone-filled arena outside. The crowd was manic. The main entrance had been blocked off by two tactical blasts to pillars. Steve rolled out of the way of a drone blast on stage and then slipped down, pushing through the panicking crowds towards one of the fallen pillars. Ugh, it looked heavy.
Tony ripped his face plate off suddenly and vomited on the floor.
Pepper blinked. "Like what?"
. That kind of praise made Steve feel hot all over and squirm in Tony's lap, whimpering as those fingers still inside of him teased at his sensitive insides in consequence. He was panting as he came down, his chest rising and falling a little quickly with each breath as if he was still catching up from those two minutes stretched around Tony's knot.
He pricked his finger and looked down at the digital monitor.
?" asked Tony, looking the kid up and down.  He was dressed... weird.  In slacks and a button-up shirt and suspenders, like he was going to a costume party as sort of Dickens character.  He looked a few years older than Tony, maybe by two or three, but they were the same height and Tony could tell at a glance that this guy probably couldn't win a wrestling match with a well-fed kitten.
"Not really, w--" began Tony; she plunged a needle into the brook of his arm.  "God
"...yeah.  I don't know.  ...tulips, maybe.  It looks like tulips."
"Not real," repeated Tony, dragging a hand across his face.  "It's not real.  It's not real.  It's not real..."
Clint probably had more to say about living a life of normality, but Cooper and Lila tore out of the house in hats and scarves and mittens, being chased by Laura.  All three were laughing. Lila made a beeline for Clint and Natasha, hitting them full-force, bowling Clint over.
Gideon hesitated, then growled out, "...yes."
"Tony, calm down.  It's okay.  It's the twenty-ninth, you're okay--"
Tony had nearly forgotten about the guy but the mere sight of the smug little jerk put Tony's guard up.
Justin turned to Vanko in an instant.  "You heard him.  Let him go.  Shut them down."
," said Tony.  "...you downloaded like half a hard drive."
Steve's heart was racing a little slower in his chest now. He slid down against the tree, slowly, until his bottom was on the floor. He swallowed, letting the question hang in the air. He had to play this right. He had one goddamn chance to do this. In a weird way, after Gideon mentioned Natasha, it made it easier for Steve to think of her. She was bright and goddamn manipulate when she wanted to be. She'd once joked, in training, that Steve should learn to use omega wiles. Whatever the hell that had meant, he hadn't been sure at the time...
He answered it with irritation.  "Listen, Pepper, if this is about the Expo, then I told you, tomorrow--"
He realized DeSoto had said something.
"Did she... their bond... was it...?"
, buzzed his brain excitedly.  Tony took a moment to rue the fact that neither he nor Steve had ever seen sat down and explained any of this stuff.  Maybe things wouldn't be so terribly complicated if they knew what to expect.  But both of their educations had jumped over Alpha-omega relations and they were flying blind.
"...you guys are fucking, aren't you?"
"W-where's my arm?" he asked suddenly, panic rising in his voice, and for the first time since the forties, he realized his left arm was missing.
"Speaking of interviews and the press...my agent sent me a text."
Fortunately the conversation was already turning again.  More harmless, polite banter.  Malick came back to the table and gave Pierce a tight smile and a nod.  Tony was guessing he hadn't been talking to a mechanic; some top-secret SHIELD thing.  Heck, maybe he'd been talking with a doctor, getting updates on Fury.
Tesseract was, but based on context, it was probably some sort of top-secret facility or some type of top-secret equipment.  Tony was idly sketching a tesseract on a spare sticky note while he watched the screen.  He thought hypercubes were pretty cool; tesseracts tessellated Euclidean space, and in the same way a person could fold out a cube into squares, a four-dimensional hypercube could be folded out into eight squares.  Tony was already scribbling the proof out, just for fun.  Eight hyperplanes, with four of the cubes meeting at each vertex... Tony wondered if whoever had named "Tesseract" had appreciated what an awesome mathematical principle they were referencing, or whether the code name had just been pulled out of a hat.
"Donner will probably be okay to go home tomorrow evening. He's been fantastic," Richard said, even sounding a little tired himself as he put a clip over the umbilical cord.
Coulson nicer.  Clearly, they cared about Steve.  Anyone who cared about Steve was all right in Tony's books.
"Virginia's going to be in by eleven and wants to speak with him privately before the event," said Aria succinctly.
"...yes.  It's been a very big day for both of you.  But you're both fine now. Steve, Pepper and Aria are going to reschedule for a post-heat interview."
"That's a lovely orchid," offered David, nodding to the little plant on the bedside stand.  "Quite a few lovely ones on the stairs, as well."
on a private jet, and meanwhile, Steve was getting shot at.  And
Tony slipped his arms around Steve's waist and nuzzled into his shoulder.  "But where ever my omega goes, I go," he added softly.  "Wanna take the bike?"
Tony snapped awake in an instant and for a split second felt confused, defensive, on edge.  Then he realized where he was.  A five-star hotel room.  Not a cave.  He relaxed with a sigh, dragging his fingers through his messy hair.  “Okay.  Okay, okay, I’m awake.  So help me Tesla, that better be an espresso and not an Americano, Sparky… oh.”  He blinked, eyeing Steve.  He was in a blue waistcoat Tony hadn’t seen before, one that brought out his eyes magnificently.  His mouth was watering.  “Stan.  I need you to do me a favor.  Put out your hand,” commanded Tony.
Steve had always been sick. His mother had always been concerned with his health, not his status. She'd spent most of Steve's childhood worrying far too much about hospital bills and the way Steve would struggle to breathe at night...he'd always been free-spirited though. Even on the playground as a child Steve was getting into scraps and fighting with the boys who picked on the littler kids, despite the fact that he was one of them. A part of Steve had known, he thought, that he was an omega. He'd always felt... different to the other boys, almost all of who turned out to be betas. Just like he always knew Bucky would turn out to be an Alpha, the only person who could ever reign him in.  And, certainly, everyone had always treated him as an omega, before puberty.  It must have been obvious.
Tony lunged, and the two Alphas fell to the ground, snarling, limbs flailing.  Later, Tony would have realized he should have just clocked Justin in the face; they'd been close enough that a single punch would have been perfectly effective.  But the moment Justin had insulted Steve, he'd lost whatever semblance of control he'd had.  This wasn't a fight between men; it was a fight between Alphas.  Neither was throwing punches; they were clawing and biting and tearing and their only goal was to inflict as much damage as possible to the other until one was dead.  There was no strategy to their fight, no thinking; Tony was snapping and growling and going for Justin's eyes, his throat, any vulnerable part of him.  If Tony was getting hurt, he was unaware of it; he was trying to strangle Justin with his tie and Justin was kneeing him in the groin and Pepper and Jack were both screaming at them but the two were deaf to the world around him, too bloodlusted to react to anything other than each other.
have to say?  There was a very unflattering piece in the
"Hey, Tones, I brought-- oh my God, is that you guys naked?"
If anyone else in the world had pinned him, he would have been losing his mind.  But Steve was different.  Tony didn't know why or how.  He just was.  Everything Steve did seemed fun, playful, personal, special.  The pressure on Tony's hand felt wonderful.  Tony was practically melting against the fridge.  Steve was so strong, so ridiculously strong.
it sounds crazy, but..." The wound on her stomach made it all the more real. It was a shot that could have killed her. The fact that Natasha had seen the Winter Soldier and hadn't mentioned it before was troubling though.  What else wasn't she telling him? Steve frowned.  "I
"I just..." Steve looked up. "What situation was Bucky in, when you...left? It's been bugging me. That I didn't know that."
Tony rolled onto his side to throw his other arm around Steve, to hold him.  He closed his eyes and tried to remind himself that mood swings were normal right now, that he was exhausted and over-emotional and that's why this was coming up again.  He was shaking a little.
"Oh.  Well, glad to have you here, buddy," said Tony, giving his upper arm a friendly slap.  "Let's get some chow afterwards, okay?  ...excuse me, I gotta go address my loving fans."
"...it's beautiful, isn't it?" said Clint, staring out at the fields.  "My own persona Eden. Peaceful. Off the grid. No politics here. No danger.  Just my family." He took a sip from his mug.
"I want to see the inside."
Steve dropped to his knees like some invisible hand had pushed him down. His voice trembled with a strange kind of reverence. "I want to be good for you. I want to give you what you want. All of it. And then I want you to come back for more."
Tony felt nothing but relief when they walked into their suite.  Gideon had spared no expense; there was an expansive living room and kitchenette, and in the bedroom, a bed large enough for several people.  There was no doubt a Jacuzzi in the bathroom. A vase of white roses sat on the table in the entryway and Tony touched one of the petals; they were indeed real.
A lazy smile graced Steve's lips and he pressed their foreheads together before nudging their noses together too. "I love you, Tony Stark."
"I want to be on Natasha's team.  She's ruthless; I'm never letting her throw a snowball at me again," said Laura, rising and stretching her back.  "Besides, it'll make Cooper happy to be on a team alone with Steve." She winked.
you're going to stand up for your omega," said Justin softly.  "You're not the first Alpha to act like a fool after bonding.  But you're only proving my point. Alphas protect.  Omegas serve.  That's just nature, Tony."
Tony lathered himself up with soap while he talked, doing it all awkwardly with his left hand.  "Anyway, he didn't take a new mate. The prince is still single. Don't know if he's an Alpha or a beta, but he's single.  Guess he hasn't found the right one yet. The only reason I know I've ever been in the same room as the king is because of the bodyguards.  They're all fucking
, can I ask you a couple really quick--"
"Open it," demanded Tony, hugging Steve to him.
He paused to take a breath and finished his drink.  He walked back over to Pepper and reached for the decanter; she pulled it away a little.
Tony took his time undressing, watching Steve hunched up on the bed, tense, refusing to budge.  Tony wondered, idly, how long he'd stay like that if Tony just walked away. An hour? Two hours?  Longer?
together."
They finished their coffees.  Steve insisted on washing the mugs and putting them in a drying rack before they left; Natasha rolled her eyes at him.  But he refused to leave the cabin messy.
and the tone of the entire room changed.
So he walked out. He stood between Tony and he TV. "You said you wanted me. You sat by that bed and said you still wanted me so if you do them-- then fucking take me, Tony. Because I'm sick of you treating me like I'm made of glass. I wanna see the worst of you. I want you to give it to me."
He felt so bad. Tony was making such an effort to prove to Steve that he wasn't put off by his neck and Steve wasn't even appearing grateful. He sighed and stared over the table and the mess of orchids.
"Aria would like to know if it would be possible to visit this afternoon," JARVIS sounded out. Steve worried on his bottom lip.
"Tony.
They stepped into the pizza place and stepped up to the counter. Ian started reeling off a loud of orders. Steve hung back, still holding Tony's hand.
"Rogers, make me some breakfast?  I'm starving over here."  He paused, and then added, "
Bucky was about to reply when his phone chirped. He slid his knife away and answered it. The halo projection came up and he could see Shuri sitting at her desk. “Hey,” she greeted not looking away from her computer, “when did you beat my level?”
She had shown Bucky her version of Minecraft which was some even more futuristic roleplay virtual reality thing that Steve planned on not going near, but he watched from the screen as Bucky played.
So he put on smooth jazz if Natasha came over and they would dance quietly in the kitchen swaying to the music. New pop songs and old lindy hop if Steve and Bucky stopped by, so Bucky could dance or sing along if he wanted to.
Loki pressed against Sam’s side and Momma came in. “I got a garden in the roof if you want to see it, Lo,” she announced.
“I already signed it, but at this point, my signature doesn’t matter,” Tony answered.
They all got in and Tony started to drive. “Thank you, Tony,” Steve stated.
Peter’s eyes softened and he pulled Pepper into another hug. Tony put a hand on Pepper’s shoulder as they separated. Peter looked at him and screamed. “I called you Dad! I called Tony Stark Dad! What is my life!”
“Kid, Loki doesn’t really need to go to school,” Tony stated, “kind of above the legal age.”
“He thinks Thor-” Jane gasped, “But Thor. Thor’s not like that.”
“That’s definitely not all,” Bucky agreed.
Sam guided Loki into the kitchen. Gideon was glaring at a pot giving directions to his brother in law. “Need help,” Sam asked.
Steve laughed and slid to the floor. He pulled Tony down for another kiss sliding his tongue against Tony’s lips. Tony eagerly accepted. After Steve had kissed him senses he let Tony go and Tony felt like a noodle.
Chase nodded and they kept talking for a while. Steve thanked Chase and told him he’d let him know about the apartment. He wouldn’t actually but it was good to keep up pretenses.
Her stare intensified. “Ok Nat,” he agreed and suddenly furry welded up in his chest because Rylie would have hated this.
He glanced down at the plate Sam had gotten. It looked a lot more appetizing. “Wanda helped Bruce make the vegetarian dishes,” Natasha noted.
Lo nodded. Sam smiled. “You’re doing good,” he praised, “need anything?”
Pepper blushed and looked down at her ring. “I always told him I wouldn’t marry him until he got his life together. I didn’t ever expect him to really,” Pepper laughed, “but he did, and he did it for Peter. Maybe I should be jaded that he would change for a child and not for me, but parenthood looks good on him.”
The three men laughed. Sam rubbed his face. “We can talk about that later. Thor has his hands full with his people right now or whatever, it would do Loki a lot better to experience being around people who aren’t going to hurt, belittle, or distrust him. He obviously doesn’t trust Thor. Here might be the best place for him.”
Loki didn’t answer. Sam left the door half open half closed. Loki let his body relax and slipped down so he was laying down. He returned to the book in front of him. Later when his stomach shot with hunger pains he looked at the sandwich at the table. Loki was no stranger to starvation and malnourishment. Living on Asgard as a frost giant caused Loki to grow small, weak, and reliant on magic and his silver tongue that Odin had beaten into him.
Steve grumbled again. How had he missed this? He was the worst. Bucky kissed the top of his head. “This makes sense why I had to explain to him why you weren’t trying to kiss him and ignoring and brushing off the signs that he wanted to kiss you.”
“Inflation,” Sam answered.
Steve snorted. “Despite popular opinion I do understand technology. I might not be as intuitive as Bucky but I work my way there. I’m even taking a few computer classes at the college.”
“Get him to leave it,” Sarah sighed dramatically, “the only thing harder to get him away from is the Church.”
By the time everything settled down again from the chaos Wanda had accidentally created, it was time for Steve and Bucky to come home. Tony, like always was a well put together mess. Sadly no one was fooled like they use to be. Peter texted him all morning before he got caught up in school. Laura invited him over to her house in the morning to hang out with the kids. Despite his nerves, Tony couldn't say no to that offer. So he spent the morning with little Nathaniel on his lap trying to divide his attention between Cooper and Lila who both wanted attention from their Uncle Tony. While it warmed his heart he was glad he only had one kid at the moment. How were you suppose to give them equal attention? After lunch, Tony headed out to the airfield and tried not to panic as he waited.
Wanda sighed and rubbed her wrist. “My brother he would despise what I am doing,” she laughed, “but he would be happy I found people who would care for me. In truth, Pietro was the extremist. I was the strategist the one who made sure we didn’t get caught. We only needed each other, but I think I would have convinced him to follow you if he had lived.”
“I don’t think that’s all that happened either,” Sam admitted.
Real smooth Peter. But a kind smile spread across her face. “My pleasure,” she answered ruffling his hair, “Sam is just pulling out a cherry pie. Let’s go join him?”
“If he was trying to manipulate us he would be telling sob stories. Not exhibiting selective mutism,” Rhodey argued.
Missing you
It was awful because he was supposed to be charming and suave, but he just didn’t have it in him anymore. Why would he? All his work to make sure Thor wouldn’t turn out like Odin had failed. Sam ruffled his hair, and for some reason, Loki felt better.
whose
“I have a small spider child,” Tony deadpanned.
Loki could use this nervous energy Sam had against him. Act like a wounded bird and let Sam fix him. He had done that countless times. But with the Grandmaster that has backfired on him. Loki shuddered to think of how badly that had failed. No, he couldn’t do that now. He couldn’t.
Bucky was already out of his seat looking over Steve’s eye with a soft growl. Maybe he wasn’t 100% sane like Tony had been starting to believe. “Yeah that,” Steve agreed a little nervously setting down a book bag, “I was walking straight home, but then I found a dog running out by himself so I returned him home, and then when I was walking back I found this dude harassing these two Muslim girls and well he just wouldn’t back off Buck.”
Daniel hit a few call buttons. Bucky and Steve leaned over his shoulder. A beautiful man in a blue sweater popped up on the screen with a husky in his lap. His eyes were red and cheeks splotched and turned his head into the husky's fur. “You saw it Baby,” Daniel asked softly.
Sam relaxed into his friend’s arms. An hour later Bucky nudged Sam awake. “We’re home,” he announced.
Sam stopped before his brother and Rylie’s mother in front of the courtroom. She didn’t like the attention, but she knew what her son would have wanted. Sam leaned down and kissed her cheek. She took the spot on his arm where Natasha had been, tears leaking down her cheek and a folded flag tucked under her arm.
“Wanda this is May Parker and Laura Barton,” Pepper announced, “Ladies Wanda Maximoff. I thought she might enjoy joining our girl's group.”
Loki was shaking. It was the most he had spoken without prompting since he had arrived, and apparently, the idea was distressing as well.
Tony waved her off. “Nah. Underoos has his first sleepover at my house so I’m heading back immediately.”
“Who said I don’t know everything,” Loki asked.
“No!”
“I’ll show you the rest of the house,” Chase told him.
“Lo?” Alex exclaimed, “Sam why in fuck are you dating a child? Is he even legal?”
“Not really,” Peter said absentmindedly.
“Girls group,” Wanda asked raising her eyebrows.
Sam stormed into the room. Loki looked back at him. “It’s alright,” Loki answered, “Wanda’s magic is only seeking out the fragments of the mind stone in my head.”
Sam sighed. “He’s a gardener.”
“Blasphemy,” Clint yelled, “go back to space if you are going to talk like that!”
Sam kicked his legs out of bed. “I asked her to help me out with Lo when he arrived, and they’ve grown attached.”
Sam wasn’t surprised by that one. “Except the foals, loves wolves and snakes although Loki never told Thor why.”
“You two are gross.”
Natasha laughed. “She doesn’t smell like a witch,” Loki added his point clearly not being made.
“Did you just say bae,” Steve demanded.
Sam shrugged. “We’ll have to ask him later.”
“What am I chopped liver,” Sam complained.
Odin smiled pleased. “But I’d rather be Asgard’s Whore than Asgard’s Coward,” Loki spat.
Spiderman started doing backflips at the request of someone below. Steve chuckled. “He’s very excitable isn’t he?”
“Oh my gosh, first of all I love you so much, I made you cookies, and my school made a banner for you and I think like half the girls in school dressed up like you for Superhero day and I can’t really blame them because I did as well, and Wow that’s really awkward and I shouldn’t have said that and I sound like a total fanboy, which I am, but you know you never want to sound like one because I know I get flustered whenever people start gawking about Spider-Man, which is weird to say out loud but apparently all the Avengers already know my secret identity which is cool I guess.”
Peter woke up at ten fourteen and quickly got dressed. He grabbed his advanced chemistry book and headed down the stairs to the couch by the window. He pulled his Captain America blanket across his lap and started reading. When he first brought the blanket over Tony had screamed.
The door clicked open and Peter squeaked. Tony walked in. “Whoops,” Peter said as Tony’s eyes drifted over to the letters.
Sam was in the lounge the next morning listening to Clint and Tony talk about disturbing Tweets, going so far as to read them out loud. “Can we just hang the people who won’t stand for the flag?” Tony read, “that one is really bad.”
“It’s been reported that Steve Rodgers, also known as Captain America, and his lifetime best friend James Buchanan Barnes, the former Winter Soldier,” the man in the tv announced, “ have made their official return to American soil sometime yesterday. Mr. Barnes has opened an official Twitter account with several postings on it and Captain Rogers first tweet is on there as well."
“I can eat dairy,” Loki answered, “but I prefer not to eat a lot.”
After that the approved version of the accords was passed there was a lot more video calling. Tony didn’t like Peter seeing it and Tony said he was working on a new home for them because apparently, everything else was full of bad memories and not homely enough but whatever. Peter wasn’t allowed to know what it looked like or any of the plans. Which wasn’t fair at all, by the way.
“Jarvis call Tony,” Bucky growled.
Tony groaned. “God bless America,” he exclaimed, “Do you kiss babies on the weekend? You know if you ran for mayor you’d probably win.”
“Loki where did you get that idea,” Sam asked.
Steve laughed leaning forward until his forehead was pressed against Bucky’s. “I promise I won’t kill Sam until you get back.”
“I didn’t realize being an asshole have you a permit to assault teenage girls,” Tony snapped back at the man, “and before you think about saying one more thing to my Niece I want you to think about how you are going to explain attempted assault and battery to a courtroom, because you can bet your ass I have that on film.”
After dinner is finished and they were washing dishes F.R.I.D.A.Y alerted them to unexpected visitors.
Clint smiled over at him. Oče, huh. It worked. It really did. Over the next few weeks Wanda was tentative and a little jittery, but it slowly faded. “Your Oče is looking for you Wanda,” Laura announced as Wanda walked into the kitchen, “and I need you to bring down your laundry.”
Mj bit the side of her cheek. “Your kids are cute,” she noted.
Loki’s sobs increased, but his head slowly lifted up. Natasha stroked his face. “It’s ok,” she cooed, “come here. I’m not going to let anyone hurt you.”
“How about we just go into his room,” Sam suggested.
Que instant panic because she didn’t know what she was saying and they had no idea which one they were looking for. And it wasn’t like they could just ask. Wanda was extremely skittish and if anyone told her they would freak. So no one ever giving Wanda a straight answer until they knew who she wanted. That left Clint and Rhodey arguing about co-parenting.
Peter almost laughed at the way the two men tensed up and shot each other twin looks of excitement and confusions. Ah so they caught that but Wanda didn’t. And while they were both confused they let it roll.
Wanda almost didn’t hear what Tony had said because she was overwhelmed by the love in the room and the purity that radiated off of Peter Parker.
She left. Rhodey sat up. Tony smiled at him shaking slightly. He let out a short laugh. “She says all that like it’s nothing. Like two hundred doctors didn’t tell me that it was impossible and god himself would have to handle it. She delivers a miracle and all she wants in return is to hang out with my kid?”
“Yeah get me every document or video you can get your hands on about Steve Rodgers.”
Tony nodded as walked out, “see you later Lo.”
“Yeah,” he admitted pulling them out of his shirt.
“That’s Thor Babe.”
Sam shrugged. “They were angry over what happened with New York, but if that was not of your own free will, well perception happens to change things.”
Tony sighed. “As in a sense that it’s an accident that suck, yeah it’s the niece thing. I guess Rhodey and Barton are really good at picking up strays.”
Peter’s eyes watered. “I gave her to the sub shop down the street!”
“And added twenty,” Steve hummed.
“I’m sure she already has your number and if I didn’t she would be angry with me,” Bucky answered.
She looked between the three men in annoyance. “I only get old white guys to visit me.”
Bucky’s lips pursed, “Jesus. F.R.I.D.A.Y remind me to buy Natasha and Sam some fruit baskets or some shit.”
Tony clapped his hands. “Ok, Rhodey Bear let's look at those legs I made.”
“Ouch, you sure do know how to hurt an old man,” he faked offense watching her kick out her legs from where she sat on the counter.
Loki looked down at the blanket. Sam continued anyways. “Bucky has been in a lot of pain. He’s the guy I told you about who was the tortured assassin. A group called Hydra stole him and brainwashed him in order to use him as a killing machine. When you arrived it triggered some bad memories, so he’s been staying at his home for a while.”
“His stomach can’t process meat so he’s a vegetarian,” Sam said instead, “and make sure you don’t touch him without asking first. He’s had...a real rough time with a lot of men.”
Steve and Tony started to share tentative kisses and Steve started to get more flirty, more open to Tony. It drove him crazy. Neither of them were sure where the relationship was going and they were keeping it on the down low while they were, but for them, it was enough.
“Is that a Onesie,” Tony demanded.
“Why,” Loki asked.
Fifty-eight minutes later Steve flipped the last page over and finished the last of his coffee. He looks at Tony. “You agree to this,” he asked no emotion in his voice.
Bucky threw a fourth rock. “Steve doesn’t know you moron,” he called back.
Tony sat down. All they had gotten was one bad diagnose after another and now she was telling him that everything was going to be ok. Don’t think Tony didn’t have a shit ton of guilt over Rhodey condition. “I’ll call her,” he croaked out.
Steve and Loki sat in the sunroom. Steve drew and Loki read. Not a big surprise. Steve wasn’t entirely gung-ho, but he trusted Sam and Bucky. Besides he was starting to warm up to the other man and was catching on to what Sam had been seeing. Bucky still wasn’t leaving their house. Some things about guilt and what not.
“Moving,” Peter exclaimed, “where? I know that as the plan, but you won’t tell me anything!”
“NoPe” Peter agreed, “my Dad is going to kill me, but Mj kidnapped me and brought me here and told me to come here so I figure she’ll kill me worse and she said ‘no, to the questions you have when you get there’ so I figure New York wasn’t actually you and you are not evil.”
He sat with Steve as Steve painted and they talked about everything but the broken boy in Bucky’s garden. The painting when it was finished was of a garden with two dark blurry silhouettes walking through it, one large and bulky and the other tall and lanky. Steve titled it “Brokenness Takes A Walk Towards Healing.” Steve flicked some paint at Sam who protested a bit too loudly.
Tony was overwhelmed, Peter brought him so much joy and confusion, but there was also an empty part in his heart. Steve should be here and not running some bar. But that was their fault and here were the consequences.
Tony sat at the bar. “Well, it appears that Bucky is very passionate and Sam is inclined to try and lessen the damages,” Tony answered.
To Bucky's pleasure, the kitchen was stocked. The freezer had like fifteen brands of popsicles which freaked Bucky out a little, but at least Tony had a sense of humor. He got a glass of milk picked up the shield and brought it into the bedroom. “Buck,” Steve muttered his eyes starting to flutter open.
“You know things about this guy,” Rhodey asked.
It wasn’t that big of a stretch. Steve had wondered when he first meet the twins if they could mentor them, and while Pietro did die, which Steve would always feel guilty over Wanda was still with them. Though Clint was more like her father than anyone else. Maybe Steve could count himself like an Uncle, maybe.
Steve grinned and arm still wrapped around Sam's shoulder. Bucky tossed Sam something “I got you a thing.”
Steve turned as Bucky walked into the room. He stopped. “Who are they and how did they get in here,” Bucky demanded his hands going for one of his guns.
Tony swore colorfully. “Who lets a fucking fifteen year old go out and fight as guys,” he demanded.
Loki seemed to appreciate bluntness over word games in regular conversation, so Sam didn't dodge around the question. Sam sat down next to him and Loki closed his book softly blinking.
“Friends? I thought there was just Ned” Steve questioned.
He was sitting on the bed now. “I’m fine kiddo,” he answered, “just really impressed with R5.”
Clint did like some country, but Sam played techno music for him because of the loud bass. Clint had great hearing aids, but he didn’t always wear them.
“I’m not alone Stevie,” Bucky answered, “you’re going to go out bar hopping with the numskulls over there so you can all decide what you want our bar to look like. Natalia and Wanda are ready for renovations. So the designer that’s You has to get his butt in gear and show everyone what he wants.”
Tony,
Peter giggled. Training with the Black Widow was intense. Kind of more intense when Hawkeye and The Falcon we’re watching as well. Peter had a great time and he couldn’t remember falling asleep so easily in such a long time.
More clanging and yelling and suddenly Loki was on the ground and hands were on him. “Get the hell out Strange!”
“We are aware of the book, and the spell,” Fury answered.
Peter squeaked. Aunt May didn’t react right away. Then she nodded slowly. “Thank you, Natasha.”
“Is that not a wedding ring,” Loki questioned
“Peggy was Peggy though,” Tony protested, “I’m just a millionaire genius.”
Sam felt a shot of excitement go up his spine. Despite the frown, Loki looked entertained and curious. Sam had Friday pull up dance videos to watch while they ate. Natasha and Sam answered Loki’s questions as best as they could. Natasha knew a lot about dance from her ballet background, but Loki apparently knew more. So they spent the morning in front of Sam’s tv watching dance shows and documentaries while Loki swayed across the living room his long and graceful limbs picking up the moves.
For a few minutes Bucky sat silently watching the man work. God only knew where he’d pulled the old boats from. If memory served they’d belonged to Peggy’s family, old when they’d been dragged up here, and now likely full of leaks after years of neglect.
Something tugged on his arm and pulled him up short. He growled and twisted to yank free of its grip, before he recognized that it was his name being called, and that the person who held him was Tony. He relaxed.
“Stefen!” She said again and there was a wobble in her voice that turned Natacha’s stomach into knots.
“Prost” Bucky toasted the man and the barkeep seemed to relax further. Bucky tucked into his plate of warm bread rolls, nearly moaning at the delicious yeasty taste after days of dried meat. While it was true any moment could be his last, he wasn’t dead yet and he’d be damned if he didn’t enjoy his food when he could have it.
Steve paled a little at that. "If I hadn't had my friends looking out for me I wouldn't be here today," he said simply and he chilled a little inside when he realised it was the truth. "I was poor and not very well most of the time. I didn't have a means of defending myself and I shouldn't have had to."
Steve swallowed and looked down. "I had a bad dream. That's all. Wasn't fun," he whispered and slid his hand down to Tony's hip. He squeezed in reassurance and looked back up into Tony's dark eyes which were currently gleaming with concern. "I'm fine. Honestly."
There was a slam and Karpov stormed back in, a thin red book under his arm.
"Whatever you want," Phil told him and stood. "It's your heat Steve," he said as he offered him a hand to pull him up. Steve stood a little shakily. "Just be careful. Don't blow cover."
"So is that him then?" asked Joey, opening the car door and dragging out the limp form of one of the bed, his wrist shackled to the metal attache case.  "Great. I've got shears."
Pepper swept a bunch of papers and an old take-out container off one of Tony's desk chairs and sat.  "Yes," she said, once she was seated.
But... he couldn't. Tony couldn't join the Avengers then. How could Steve lead a man, order him around, if he'd let said man have his wicked way with him? No. No way. Steve could hear the sound of a scuffle outside but backed away to the other side of his cabin, making his scent as weak as possible as he pressed against the opposite wall.
"Use sheets!" Steve said, despairing as he turned on his feel and headed to Trickshot's room. He swallowed.
"I'm going into an elevator, the call's probably gonna drop."
oh, shit, I just crushed them, they're all over the floor--
have a significant other?" he demanded, rounding on Pepper.
like him?" demanded Sam.
isn't it?" sneered Phil.
"Price is no issue.  If you could please give me a referral I would be most grateful.  And of course, if she ends up as a beta, I can't say I'd be upset!"  George laughed politely and so did Francine.
"You've been bonded for seven months.  Anything like this ever hit you?"
"Tony--"
The morning of the White House event Steve got up early to jog off his frustrations, finding a sleepy Tony in bed next to him. He kissed his cheek and got a grunt in response and smiled. "I'll see you at breakfast," he breathed softly against his cheek before rolling out of bed.
"T-T-Tony!" The name spilled out shakily. Steve didn't know where it came from. But it felt right to shout for him, whoever he was. "Tony! You've got to-" Thick, metal fingers closed around his throat.
"Swing me," she demanded, sitting on Clint's chest.
"No, look, it'll be great, Steve's never stuck his dick into anything--"
"You're twins," he realized.  The story they'd told was clearly one that had been told over and over to each other, solidifying it, trying to make sense of it.  But the way they bounced back and forth. The way the boy seemed so unbothered by the girl. Their solidarity with each other.
Pietro held up a lighter with a grin.  Bucky grinned back and got up. He felt stiff from sleeping on the floor; he stretched, the gears in his left arm whirring and clicking.
"Aaaaand here's my favorite mate!  Boys, the
"I had my first heat just over a month ago. I never cycled properly before the serum, so...I don't know what's normal for me," Steve admitted.  "So is my thing dilated?  Is it bad?"
Tony looked at Gene.  Gene seemed unfazed by Tony's unusual outfit.  When Gene offered his hand, Tony shook it, and his handshake was perfectly firm but not overly aggressive.
"Easy, Stark.  I meant as a soldier.  Not as an omega."
"...he got Steve drunk," said Pepper grouchily, shoving bottles of water into Tony's and Steve's hands.  "Drink," she commanded. She had no idea what Steve was on, if he was on anything, aside from alcohol, but whatever it was, he needed to flush it out quickly.  After all, he was supposed to be meeting with Clint tomorrow. As for Tony, she knew exactly what was going on with him.  Tony had very particular tastes when it came to alcohol and "party drugs," and she could spot ecstasy a mile away. Tony was sweaty and flushed and kept clenching his teeth.  The remedy was ridiculous amount of water and serotonin supplements.
"Yessir."
“What do you think they’re talking about in there?” asked Tony suspiciously, looking toward the direction of the living room.  “What a crap Alpha I am?”
"Hmm," said Tony, who would love to pick the brain of a renowned nuclear physicist regardless of if they had a perchance for destructive bouts of rage.  If anything, that was sort of a bonus. "...well, the thing is, I've been trying to lay low, too. You know, let Steve do his thing."
Steve's phone started ringing on the bedside table. He reached over. He picked it up. And then he promptly threw it against the wall and the ringing stopped. Steve didn't say a word, he just curled up back against Tony's side contently.
"How about we go get some pizzas?" Steve suggested, squeezing Tony's hand lightly. He wanted to steal a moment alone with him to find out what he really thought.
Tony reached out to grab the collar; Steve was whining and whimpering and wiggling under him, fingers clenched on the sheets, his eyes following Tony with a sort of dumbstruck reverence.
Tony wondered if Steve appreciated how good he looked.
probably be easier if you did that.  But that's not you. You don't do things the easy way," said Tony.  "It would've been easier not to join the army, not to volunteer for the serum experiments, not to go to war, not to save the world and sacrifice yourself to do so... nothing you've ever done has been easy.  But it's been...
capacity, after the injected you with the serum," repeated Natasha.
"Oh." Carefully, Steve bent down and laid Trickshot out over it. He saw the other wince a little and felt bad.
Dr. Gleason had almost finished cleaning off Steve's neck ("I don't think this needs stitches," he reported) when there was a bang from the other room, the bang of a door slamming, and a moment later, Tony skidded in.  He'd thrown on a pair of jeans from the shop and was holding a robe for Steve. He offered it to him, looking anxious about what he'd missed.
Tony's eyes narrowed at it.  "Who's that? Is that Natasha?" he demanded, hair prickling at the potential threat.
"What?"
Tony considered running after him.  Taking control by making a big, hysterical mess of things.  But he didn't, because Tony wasn't an emotional person.  Instead, he sat there, shell-shocked.  Watching Steve leave was like watching part of his own soul leave his body.
Steve sighed almost whimsically. "And people say I'm too modest… call traced yet?"
Before he could ponder any further his phone started ringing. After some searching Steve found it in his back jean pocket. It was Nat. He hesitated, then answered. Steve sighed. "Hey."
about that? I'm goddamn furious. However angry you think it makes you I feel it tenfold Tony. He's already ruined my life once, I'm not going to let him do it to me again.  And do you think I'm happy that I nearly killed you? Really? Because I'm not. I'm fucking terrified. I didn't want this. I didn't ask for this and you're acting like...like I'm going it on purpose. I don't know why you'd think that. I don't know why you'd think that I'd ever want to do this to you. And it kills me that I can't stop it!" Steve exclaimed.
Steve wondered how long it took to make this spiel seem polite and proper given the situations and circumstances they were talking about. He imagined it could turn crass rather quickly given the subject. “Is this position comfortable for the Omegas?”
“I did, actually,” the Omega replied cheekily. The ego on the man was astounding but also amusing. He wasn’t sure why it put him at ease so much. “Now. I’m going to turn around so I can slide down on this nice big cock of yours and you’re going to sit there patiently while I have some fun with you.”
“As you are a new client, shall I explain our procedure here?” the other man asked, smoothly interrupting his train of thought and making him focus on his host again.
“Yeah, better not,” the Omega agreed and there was a warning in his voice but Steve wasn’t stupid. This wasn’t the first time he knotted an Omega. It helped considerably that he wasn’t in heat but he didn’t want the man to worry he might suddenly find himself claimed as a mate. It was always a risk with strangers. Of course, the other man probably knew that clients here were heavily vetted.
“I’ll give you plenty ideas,” the Omega grinned. “So long as you’re using them on me.”
“I have this room set up for you, Captain,” Harrison said, opening the door and gesturing him inside. “There are robes for both you in here and again, all the supplies are provided.”
“Maybe next time,” the man beneath him said, wiggling slightly and clenching hard enough to make Steve groan, then tip over the edge again. It pulled a moan out of the Omega as his muscles flexed around the Alpha to draw the warm fluid out of him. “That’s the way.”
He took the right cheek of the man’s ass in hand and he massaged it with his fingers, kneading the muscles with slow, smooth movements. He alternated the massaging with squeezing and long rolls of his palm against the bare white canvas in front of him. The Alpha spent several minutes on this routine before dropped his right hand to grab the left side and do the same thing. Who didn’t enjoy a nice butt massage?
“Yep,” the man said. “You had your fun already. Now it’s my turn. When I’m done, I’ll let you fuck me into the mattress and knot me like a proper Omega but right now, this--” he squeezed Steve’s erection pointedly. “Is just asking to be ridden and I’m just the guy to do it. Besides, it’ll give you a great view of the ass you’re so fond of. It’s win-win really.”
“Next time, plan on all night,” the Alpha ordered and he usually tried not to curse but god if this man didn’t bring his instincts out of him. “I want to fuck you while you’re full.”
He laughed in response and it cut off in a groan when the Omega wrapped his hand around his erection without any warning. Steve grunted and leaned up far enough to grab the man’s ass to pull him forward. It made the other man grin but he didn’t protest being pulled forward and he didn’t let go of Steve either.
“No, due to your status and reputation, you were granted one of our private visitation windows,” Harrison replied. “We typically serve clients by appointment only and we do try to limit their interactions for privacy but occasionally we throw galas and celebrations that draw quite the crowd.”
“Yes--god yes,” the other man groaned. Steve was impressed that he could understand him around all the moaning that the man was doing. He groaned against his ear as he pumped his hips and the Alpha grinned when the Omega beneath him stiffened, spilling himself on the sheets beneath them. He stroked and squeezed his cock until the man was empty, then focused on himself.
“If you wish to purchase an Omega for the evening, simply come to the intercom and let us know,” the man continued. “We have rooms upstairs we can arrange for you so you are more comfortable. Of course, the Omega will have to approve you before they will join you, as the decision is ultimately theirs, but I don’t think this will be a problem for you.”
“Anything else?” he asked and it was a little impatient but he already dragged this out once.
“Yes. Yes… yesss,” the Omega groaned beneath him, going boneless as the Alpha knotted him and twisting his head from side to side as he was stretched to the brim. Steve groaned and slumped over the man’s back, trying to support himself on his elbows on either side as the pressure mounted. So tight. So very tight.  His chest heaved as he tried to catch his breath. The other man was mumbling random words and still moaning if he shifted even a little bit but Steve hardly registered them. He nuzzled the Omega’s hair and pressed a kiss to the side of his head but it certainly didn’t seem like the man needed any reassurance from him.
Steady, quick fingers undid the tie of the red silk robe and the man shimmied out of it, discarding it to the floor with little concern. Steve inhaled in appreciation. He wasn’t wrong about the man taking care of himself and working out. He looked good and his cock was still hard against his stomach which made the Alpha rather proud of himself. He shifted on the couch to undo his own and found himself with a lap full of Omega instead, nudging him to lean back with one hand and knocking his hands away from the tie.
soon,” the Omega replied.
“First time,” Steve replied with a chuckle against the man’s back. “I should have come sooner.”
“Our selection process is unique. If you turn your attention to this wall,” he pointed and Steve followed his hand to a wall with ten empty circles cut out of it. “There are rooms down the hall where these holes are not empty. An Omega will be presenting themselves in each hole. You are welcome to touch, feel, tease, whatever you desire, to pick an Omega. You then may choose to claim them here or pay for them for the evening.”
“We try to be as accommodating as possible,” Harrison replied with a small, friendly chuckle. He wondered how many times the man went through this spiel. It was clearly mostly rehearsed but Harrison was charismatic enough he barely noticed. They stopped outside what seemed to Steve to be a random door in the hallway.
“Would you would prefer a male or female Omega this evening?” the other man asked and he recalled checking the box that stated he didn’t have an immediate preference. “You may, of course, change your mind if you don’t find any that suit you.”
“Do you have any other questions?” the man asked him and Steve shook his head. “Your invitation gives you unrestricted access to the Omega room of your choosing for as long as you would like. No one will interrupt you.”
“Good, I’d be happy to go again,” the Omega stood up and claimed his robe from where it was discarded on the floor. “Wall and all.”
He gave the Omega a light slap with his left hand and stepped back to admire the ass in front of him again. There were so many things he wanted to do with it. He didn’t know how he was going to fit them all in one night. He could the whine of protest and the moan from the Omega. He wondered if the man was taking himself in hand on the other side of the wall. He imagined they were more than allowed to touch themselves and were probably more than happy to do so since the Alpha on the other side of the wall couldn’t reach them.
He released his grip entirely to pull back for the supplies mentioned before and he could actually hear the man’s sound of protest from the other side of the wall. Sometimes, it was nice to be blessed with super soldier hearing. He patted the man’s ass lightly in reassurance that he would be back and rummaged around in one of the baskets. He pocketed a couple of condoms even though the sign by the man’s number said he didn’t require them and also grabbed a bottle of lube. Omegas could certainly get slick enough on their own and he didn’t think it would be a problem for this one, but it never hurt to have anyway. He just wanted it on hand before he was too enamored in what he was doing to pull away.
“Thank you,” he repeated and was relieved when the man finally closed the door so he could strip down. He tugged the robe off the holder and tied it loosely around himself. He inspected the blue mask before sliding it on over his eyes and he found it to be fairly comfortable. It fit well and didn’t move far even with his experimental jostling. All there was to do now was wait.
“Nor should you,” the Omega replied and he stood up to fetch a bottle of lube. If Steve’s lap was anything to go by, he was plenty wet, but he wasn’t going to argue with more lube being involved. “Oh, I forgot the pesky details-- do you want to wear a condom? I don’t care one way or another. This place makes sure we’re all clean before we get going.”
“Am I?” he asked, quirking one eyebrow upward and he paired it with the most innocent face he could muster. “Why do you say that?”
“The comfort of our Omegas is incredibly important to us. They are our clients just the same as Alphas. The other side of the building works in reverse. Sometimes Alphas prefer to just be serviced, without any expectations on their part and there are Omegas who are more than happy to provide that experience for them,” Harrison shut the door and gave him a warm smile. Steve took it as an invitation to try that out in the future and who knows? He just might. Tonight, however, he was perfectly happy to be in charge.
“I don’t know if you know this,” Steve said, squeezing the cheeks in his hand. “But you have an amazing ass.”
Steve hummed in appreciation at the sight. He was happy to find the Omega’s hole was wet already thanks to the massaging and he dragged one thumb along the man’s crack but stopped before he touched anything that might be more sensitive. The other man pushed back against him again but there wasn’t much space for the movement. He was pretty much at the Alpha’s mercy and whatever pace that
Above him, the Omega shifted one last time and picked up the pace, rolling his hips to impale himself again and again on Steve’s erection. He groaned watching himself disappear in the other man, inch by inch and the Omega didn’t even hesitate to lift up again and again. He was wonderfully tight around the Alpha and Steve was happy to watch the man’s back and ass muscles flex as he slid up and down. The moans coming out of the other man were delicious and he was essentially doing it to himself, which made them even better.
There were plenty of lengthy discussions at SHIELD about how he might be interested in working out some tension but he really didn’t want it to be with anyone he worked with regularly or might work with in the future. There was no need to make things awkward in the field if it went poorly. He needed his coworkers to trust him and be comfortable. So, someone managed to secure him a private invitation to what they called a ‘gentleman’s club’. It likely wasn’t the strangest job that someone was assigned either, probably just another day in the life at SHIELD, but he was grateful anyway.
“Wouldn’t have wanted the ride to be over
“You made me wait,” the man complained as he settled across his lap.
His hand slid around the curve of one globe and found it sat comfortably in his hand. The Omega pressed back into his hand invitingly and he squeezed again, taking hold of both sides to feel the weight of the man’s ass in his hand. The man’s skin was soft and smooth when he rubbed his thumbs over it. He released his grip just to poke at the smooth ass, watching it as it bounced back with appreciation and he smiled in amusement as the Omega gave what he could only consider an annoyed wiggle. Impatient, this one.
