“No, just very drunk.” she smiled, “Also, wouldn’t want to wake up Tony right now with noise, do we?”
“She’s pregnant.  About 7 months along with a little boy.” he smiled.
Bucky stayed where he was while Steve took Tony’s spot on the couch.  It was obvious Steve was trying not to cry.  He looked as if he was in pain as he stared at the floor.
“You couldn’t have.” said Bucky, “I didn’t tell Natasha.”
Tony got in the car with Pepper and Happy started to drive them to her place to drop her off.  He was feeling pretty gross about taking money from people who fucked his man over and gave him such bad personal issues that he needed to seek therapy.
Bucky turned to Steve on the couch and scooted a little closer, “You know what?  Maybe I should move to Brooklyn.  I love hanging out with you again and eating this amazing food around here.”
He managed to give Tony a gentle sponge bath and dry him off before re-doing his bandage and tying the robes on both of them.  Pepper showed up with their duffle bags not long after.  They joined her in the living room.  She’d gotten both of their medications as well.
Quietly, Steve made his way in the bathroom and listened to his boyfriend sing, “...just a beast under your bed.  In your closet in your-”
“Yes, of course.” Steve said pleasantly.
“I’m all packed up, I was just about to get on the road.” Bucky told him.
“Thanks again for cooking.  This is a great brunch.” Bucky complimented, trying to get him to feel better.
Slowly, he started to rock his hips into Bucky, lolling his head back and whining.  That man’s mouth felt incredible.  He felt drunk on it.
The brunette man took the glasses over to the sink and grabbed them two new ones, heading over to the liquor shelf.
“What about your own therapist?  I know a ton here in the city.  I could even take care of the appointments for you.  How’s that sound?”
“Alright then,” said Tony, his body losing it’s rigidity and his eyes going back to the television.
“Wine?  Red Meat?” said Steve curiously, “You sure you’ll be okay?”
“Are you sure?  Even with the alcohol around you all the time?  That’s not even a little tempting?”
“Just...earlier...I keep thinking about it.” Steve sighed.
It was 8 in the morning.  Bucky woke up from a nightmare, shirtless in a cold sweat.  He’d only gone to sleep 3 hours before.
Bucky cleared his throat to get his attention and asked, “So, is uh...does Madison know you are here?”
The blonde got off of him and grabbed his phone off the coffee table to see that Tony was calling him.  It was about lunch time on his usual work day.
Steve finished his meal in silence, cleaned up, and got dressed.  The whole time he cried silently.  He didn’t want Bucky to be upset with him.  He didn’t want what they had to be over.  It felt too good, too necessary for the both of them.
Tony told him “His name is Frank.  Were you the person to lay him off or mishandle his case or something?”  Still Steve shook his head in response.  He moved toward the cuffed, unconscious man for a second to examine his Army uniform.  Seeing the last name sewed into it still didn’t give Steve any clues.  “I don’t remember Frank Montago.”
“Not really, you just did some things.” he replied, not looking up until he sent what he was writing.
“So shit is getting real.” he said casually.
“Don’t.” said Tony, looking up at his boyfriend with his tears falling down his cheeks.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Thanks but I am still nervous.  I will be speaking for about 2,000 people.”
When Tony was cleaned off, he slowly turned to the mirror to fix his hair with his products.
He didn’t say anything, trying to hype himself up about all the good going on in his life.  Steve didn’t have time to worry about bullshit like this anymore.  It wasn’t wise to let himself go back to that shitty mindset that Bucky belonged to him.
Rolling his eyes, Bucky replied, “Yes, I’ve been sleeping.  I’m fine.”  He gently took Marco’s hands down from his cheeks.  “It was nice to see you.  Good luck on that interview.”
Steve smiled at the concern in his voice.  That was Tony’s natural state, always trying to be the most helpful person in existence.
Steve’s eyes wandered down his tight T-shirt to where the seemingly leather prosthetic started at the joint of his elbow.  He seemed to have been working out frequently and taking care of himself.
----------------------------------
“I am not-”
Steve managed to lean all the way back against the wall of the shower. The glass was nice and cold on his neck.
“I threw up.” she said in a small weak voice.
Sinking low into the couch, Steve said “Oh, that...I mean, we were drinking.  That’s why we got the hotel.  I don’t really remember it that much.”
Bucky paused at the front door and simply said “Out.” before slamming it behind him.
The brunette man grabs his wallet and heavy jacket, gives him one last hurt look, and leaves out the front door.  Steve backs away, dropping onto the couch and sobbing into his hands.
“Fuck Steve,” she huffed, “I barely even knew who that guy was.  He was so quiet.  Now he’s all over the news.  I didn’t even realize I was friends with him on Facebook.  He probably got to know about you from my posts.  I’m so sorry.  I’ll stop posting and tagging so much.”
Wait, did that mean he WANTED to marry Tony?
Steve was in and out of consciousness on the way home.  He would probably have no knowledge of what happened at the club.
She gives him a weird look and nods before sitting in the area chair and focusing on the game.
Steve returned the contagious grin, “Honestly Bucky...”
It was too difficult for Steve to make eye contact as he stared out the giant bedroom windows.  He noticed the city lights that were starting to come on in the dusk.  “So...as you know, therapy has been really helping me out.” Steve told him, “I should have kept doing this after I got back from my tour, not just because I was at war but because...I needed to reflect on some things inside myself.  That’s all because of you, and I can’t thank you enough for that, Honey.”
“Doesn’t matter if you did.  It was none of my business.”
tell each other everything.  We always agreed on one thing since day one and that was transparency.”
Bucky shrugged, “You weren’t really walking on your own.  In the cab you were fading in and out.  Kept asking for sub sandwiches like I had them in my back pocket.”
Bucky swallowed a lump in his throat.  “Uh...not really.  Just some brunette white guy.  It was really dark in there.  You probably even thought he was Tony.”
Tony wiped his face, composed himself, and cleared his throat, "Get your stuff together. I'm not arguing with you anymore."
“It’s okay, she told me,” Bucky said, sitting back in his seat.
“She was how I got this.” Bucky flenched, pointing at his black eye.
Steve leaned in to get his attention, “Were you ever diagnosed with something?”
“You’re right!” said Wanda, spilling mustard from her sandwich on her camo uniform, “I believe he hasn’t had a break in like...8 years or something.  He’s a bitter old man.  He needs to let loose.”
“I want your attention because when I get it, it feels like a reward.  But Stevie, I...can’t break up another relationship.” Bucky said with a cracking voice.
The whole club had poor ventilation anyway since it was just a remodeled warehouse.
Tony sighed happily, “Well then, there ya go.”
“Are you disappointed?” asked Sam.
“That’s like 7 months.” he gasped.
The two of them had been spending most of their free time together.  They had meals together and chatted about their daily lives and coworkers frequently.  It really was a nice routine they fell into, sharing everything and leaning on each other.
“Nah, he’s got to work tonight.” he replied immediately, feeling his stomach quiver again before taking off in a hired car.
A new wave of pain seemed to hit Steve and it showed in his forehead.  “I know, honey.  I am trying to now and I know it’s too late.  I know I waited too long and I shouldn’t have.”  Fresh, fat tears started to fall down his face yet again.  Steve was flinching and waiting to be yelled at or finally told he needs to get the fuck out.
“Why?  Why do you need to move away?”
All the working out he’d been doing gave him the upper body strength to hold Tony’s weight on his back while he met his thrusts.  “Fuck,” Tony groaned into his ear from behind, kissing his neck and shoulder, “you feel so fucking tight.  I love you, love being inside you.”
Steve buries his face in his hands but jumps at the loud crash echoing in their bedroom.  Abruptly he uncovered his eyes to see a broken vase shattered on the floor and the pedestal it once sat on still rocking back and forth.
“Me either honey.  Just talk to me, calmly.” said Steve, rubbing the soft skin on his back with one hand.
“Hey.” Bucky said, returning the smile to wear he stood next to the front door.
Steve left a few kisses across the smaller man’s shoulders.  “Yeah, in a minute.”
“Well how do you know?  If that was true, that you two are ‘best friends’,  I wouldn’t have been able to date you for 2 years without meeting him.  Maybe you aren’t as close as you thought if he ignores you.”
The blonde man looked over at Sam, making eye contact and looking panicked.  Sam motioned with his hands to tell him to calm down.  Bucky also caught his eye, looking confused, then shocked when he realized what was happening.
“Honestly if you were ever torn in half like that,” Bucky typed, “I would just leave.”  He hit send and had to tell himself to breathe.
Steve shook his head, “I know, I just...don’t think I want to be in the Army anymore.  Now I feel more unwanted than ever.  I would rather do something I LIKE to do.”
Steve was organizing the home office while they chatted.  Natasha was sitting at his desk chair and swaying around when she realized his playlist of songs currently playing on his computer were all sad Sia songs.
Steve shook his head, “Why did you think you couldn’t tell me that?”
During Bucky’s trip, they didn’t really talk much except for a few texts.
With a concerned look, Steve said “Tony, I don’t think you should-”
“It was a few years ago.”
Mentally, Steve said goodbye to that expression on his man’s face.  It might be a while before he sees it again.
Steve shrugged sadly, “I will stop receiving my leave pay they’ve been giving me at the end of the month.  I guess I need to start setting up interviews and getting that whole process started.”
“Yeah?  Like Painting and Pinot or something?” laughed Natasha.
“Damn.” pouted Steve.
kiss the hell out of him earlier without so much as a questioning look.
He was afraid she would fall, so Bucky leaned back and said playfully, “Wait, wait!  Hold on!  Stay there.”  He ran around the bar to the other side and swiveled her around on her stool to hug her properly.
Tony did keep a panic button hidden in the office and kitchen.  Fuck, why didn’t he spring for the one by the front door?  “What exactly
Steve stood by his area chair, watching his friend re-dress himself.
The intoxicated scent of whisky breezed around the two of them.
“You could go to the club with all those people drinking around you?”
“He’s an old friend.” shrugged Tony, “I have a few old friends I drop in on when I have problems.  That’s totally normal.  It was just taken too far.”
“So, I didn’t tell you earlier,” Bucky said, “but I talked to Becca.”
“Fuck.” groaned Bucky with bleary eyes when they gasped for air.  He cupped Steve’s face with his skin hand to look at him, “I...I don’t want to share you.  I’m sure Tony doesn’t either.”
“Well,” started Steve, fixing his hair, “what if I told you that you didn’t need to find your own place right away and you could stay right here?”
He nodded, “Want me to make us some breakfast?”
“That’s nice.” Marco nodded in encouragement, “Have you been seeing anyone?”
This was the first time Steve had seen genuine happiness on Bucky’s face.
“Gonna...propose?” he exclaimed.
Steve nodded with worried brows.  “You just…” Tony continued, “I’m sad because of the level of...betrayal.  It’s not like you at all.”  He got up to sit next to Steve on the edge.  “I mean, I still love you enough to...work on it.” sighed Tony.
“Not yet,” he replied softly.
He waved them off and continued to talk about engineering with the random coworker.
“I didn’t think you were judging!  I was just saying I know I wasn’t ever...dating men before and I didn’t know I would ever pursue something like this.”
“I know.  I used to hear her talking to her friends all the time about it.  My family has never been good to me.  I’ve been planning my escape for a while, luckily.”
“I’m fine.  Like you said, I didn’t know what I was doing.”
“They can trust me.  I don’t slip up because that would be too embarrassing and they’d probably fire me for drinking on the job.  Keeps me on my best behaviour.  Also I enjoy hanging out and talking to people.  I meet a lot of interesting strangers that way.  I love that.”  Bucky smiled fondly, sipping his tea and sitting it on the coffee table.
"Please," smiled Steve, pressing his lips against his ear to breathlessly address him as "Mister Stark."
“Oh yeah?” Steve chuckled, “What’re you thinking?”
Immediately, the burly man put his hands up defensively and smiled.  Mouthing “Sorry.”, he got up and walked off.
“Yes, you will.” he assured his friend.
Bucky cocked his head, "You know that's not all."
“He will.” Tony said, surprised.
That being said,
“I’m not.” chuckled Steve, still facing the task at hand.
It was obvious Tony had just been wracking his brain all night about the possible reasons Steve betrayed him.
Steve started to stretch too, “Yeah.  He already way too excited about it and wants to start nesting.”
“You can probably keep my two TVs.” finished Steve, “Tony has a trove of monitors everywhere.  I’ll be living in a robot home essentially.  I doubt I’ll need them.”
“You still love me?” sniffed Bucky.
“Perfect.” Steve told him.
Steve told him softly, “Don’t be.  Shh. It’s okay.”
He noticed his hands were in a more relaxed position around Steve’s neck.  The bigger man’s hands were resting on Bucky’s hips.
A soft gasp escaped Steve as a tear ran down his cheek.
“I’m good!  Just finished my second spritzer.” Natasha giggled.
“I want to really play tonight and take my time.” whispered Tony.
Tony turned off the music and looked up at him with fake annoyance, “Kill me, you mean.”
“So, they think that’s because of you.  Like what if SI does a good job so you guys are happy with it?  Shit.” scoffed Bucky, “That’s not your fault, Steve.  Sounds like someone is in your business.  You got a rat on your hands.”
“You know the original intention was to stay here temporarily.  It seems like I’d be better off starting fresh somewhere.”
“Oh, it’s fine.  How’s the convention?” he asked, making eye contact with Bucky.
“I can see that.”  Steve nodded, pondering how easily Bucky made friends even when they were children.
He scooted over until the two men’s sides were touching and put his arm around his friend.
When he rejoined his friends upstairs, Bucky seemed to be talking to a few more of his friends from work besides Natasha.  Steve mingled a little more on his own.
“Sure did.  Can I join you?” asked Bucky.
“Hey.” he smiled.
“You must be Bucky?” she said.
He slipped it on, handing the blazer to Steve. The blonde put the jacket on for him.
A few minutes later, Steve agreed and asked when he was available to come to their hotel.
Bucky rolled his eyes and flipped him off.  Laughing, Steve sat down beside him.
With a bitter laugh, the blonde asked him “How could you tell?”
Bucky coming back into the living room naked verified that.
“I already ordered Thai food.  Just taking a minute to get here.”
“Last job was as a bartender, but I’ve done everything.”
“Again, all valid concerns.” said Natasha, “But if Tony is helping you, then it seems like you can take your time finding a job.  Also, he can probably help you get good legal representation if you need it.”
Steve looks uneasily between them, “I uh, can go turn the TV on in the other room.  Call for me.”  He stood and left.  As soon the bedroom door was heard clicking, a rush of heat and nausea ran through Bucky’s body.
“Hey,” he smiled, “calm down.  It’s alright.  You got confused and accidentally kissed someone.  You didn’t cheat, you didn’t do anything knowingly.  It’s a miracle that memory came back to you at all.  Don’t even worry about it.”
“Not really.”
Tony looked pissed.
“You’ll have to fill out surveys once a week.” smirked Steve.
Bucky reached down to slip his finger tips in the waistband of Steve’s now tented boxer briefs.  “Do you want to?”
"What do you really want, Buck?" Asked Steve, gently cupping his neck.
Bucky shuffled grumpily under him, since he himself started to fall asleep too.
“That is possible.” said Tony, sounding kind of high strung, “Do you have any idea who that might be?  Anyone at all?”
The sensation forced Steve tighter around Tony, making him thrust harder.  “Oh baby, are you trying to make me cum already?”  he asked with a breathy, heavy voice.  “Mmm,” hummed Steve happily, “want to feel you burst in me.”  He smirked as he looked over his shoulder.  Tony was giving him an astounded yet dark look, like Steve was going to punch the orgasm out of him by just using his words.
“What do you want from me, Steve?”
Tony watching the man pace frantically now, muttering to himself while constantly checking his watch.
Obviously the man had only woken up to eat the entire medium pie and pass out again.  Bucky still had a few hours to rest.
"The trip was fine. Pretty painless.  Visiting with my family had its ups and downs."
Bucky laughed nervously and offered his hand, “Yes, nice to meet you.”
“I mean, this is it, who are you looking-...” Tony smiled, “Wait, I know you.  We met before at uh...Natasha’s party right?”
“What’s wrong?” Bucky asked with a scratchy voice, stepping closer to him.
Bucky looked at the drink curiously then took a sip.  He cocked his head at Tony, “Did you just make me a Shirley Temple?”
Tony crawled over him to rub their dicks together but Steve overpowered him and rolled them around so he was on top.
“Yeah?” nodded Bucky.
Bucky nodded, “I’m sorry again, Steve.”
“I...I guess.” murmured Steve.
Steve’s arms went limp and his hands fell from his hips, “I have been trying to split my time!  I’ve been asking for your approval with everything I do!  You said you were fine.”
Steve crossed his arms and stared down at his own lap, “I just...like I said I don’t understand why we didn’t talk about this.  I know it’s your life and I don’t tell you what to do, but a new relationship is definitely something you talk to your friend about.  Just felt like you intentionally kept it from me.”  A few silent tears fell down his cheeks.
“It’s in an hour.  That’s what Pepper said.”
One night when Rhodey invited him over, the man basically gave Tony an entire speech about how he needs to respect himself and not put up with “bullshit like this”.
“Why can’t you sleep?” she asked.
“Alright, alright.” smirked Steve, dismounting him.  Tony pouted and resisted a little, making them both laugh.
Steve went into the humid bathroom to find his boyfriend drying off.  “Hey.” he smiled.  Tony looked him over, noticing he was wearing all his clothes including his coat and socks, “Going somewhere?”
They got up and got changed.  Steve loaned Bucky a button down black shirt of his that fit him a little bit tighter than it did on his own body.
The noise from sitting on a stool got Steve’s attention and he smiled at his friend.  “G’morning.”
“Can’t you love two people at one time?” breathed Steve, almost sounding like he didn’t believe what was coming out of his own mouth.
“I have to be wherever is best for me.” Bucky replied, “It may not be here.  I’m going to need to eventually apologize personally to Tony, but after that, I probably will start looking for somewhere to live.”
Huffing and puffing about his best friend’s pep talk, Tony said “I am definitely letting him know this shit won’t fly with me.  I just...we are serious, I can’t give up at the first red flag.”
Of course he’d go for her.
“You know how it goes.  The honeymoon phase,  you become obsessed with each other, it’s unavoidable.”
Steve made sure Bucky’s coworkers weren’t within earshot, then glanced over at Bucky mixing drinks a few steps away.  “Basically, he cheated on someone.”
Bucky just kept eating across from him.
“A sober bartender?” she laughed.
He still noticed an apology text from Steve the next morning.
Nodding, Bucky smirked and stuck 2 fingers into him, starting to pump immediately.
Tony tilted his head at him and squinted his eyes, “Alright, look...I know this is awkward, but you got to get it over with at some point.  Talking it through was your idea.”
“Feels natural, doesn’t it?” sighed Steve, shaking his head in disbelief.
With a sigh, Bucky admitted, “I think we need to talk.”
“You’re the only one that noticed.” said Marco, getting his eyes back up to meet his, “I’ve missed you.”
“But I’m not.” he laughed.
“That’s really,” Tony paused, putting his good arm around Steve’s neck, “sweet, actually.”  Steve shrugged, “I just wanted to put my art degree to use.  Plus kids listen better than drunk adults.”
“Bring Tony.”  Natasha said, “Oh, and Bucky if you want!  I’m dying to meet him.”  walking backwards until they exited.
He kept his original account and phone number, so his data was all still there.
Tony shushed him and snuggled in closer to look back up into his eyes, “Let’s not think about that.  Not right now.  Okay?”  “Okay.” he nodded, letting out a deep breath.
“We didn’t ask you to do that!” Steve groaned.
Steve pouted, “I DON’T feel guilty right now.  This finally feels right.”
“Koy must have just got in my head.” he thought to himself, changing into real pants.  “I was just...being too affectionate...I WAS the one leaning in, I think.  Got caught up in the moment."
That night, Bucky and Steve met Tony outside Natasha’s place for her party.
“That smells good.”
Steve continued to cry and shook his head.  The brunette man scooted forward and hugged him tightly until his friend hugged back.
“At work.  His company he works for has a contract with the base.”
“No, it’s fine.  I’ll pretend like it never happened.  We’re both good at that...pretending.”
Their visit only lasted a few hours, then Marco had to head out to his interview.
“Bucky, you just need to have boundaries.  You don’t need to stay away from him anymore unless you honestly can’t trust yourself.”
“I...saw you...in the bathroom.  It was right before you left for Indiana.”
Steve’s eyebrows shot up in surprise.
Bucky turned in toward him and extended his arm over Steve’s hip.  He buried his face in Steve’s collar and cried once more.
“This has been nice but I meant it.  I’m not going to keep an affair going with you.”
When Bucky looked over, he was slipping a long sleeve shirt over his head.  “What’s that?”
“You gonna be okay alone with your thoughts?” asked Bucky, cocking his head.
Steve pauses and gives her a look again, “Why do you think I’m lying?”
Steve kissed his chest here and there before laying his head on the man once more.  They sat there listening to the city outside for a few hours, just enjoying each other’s embrace.
Besides her, Natasha visited.  She was super emotional when she came.  As soon as Steve opened the door, Natasha held onto him for 5 minutes straight.
Steve sent Bucky a text and asked if they could talk.  He didn’t expect him to be awake, so his stomach muscles clenched at the sight of the three dots on his screen.  Bucky replied with “I’m at home.”  “Do you want me to head over?” Steve asked.  “Up to you.” Bucky wrote.
“Fuck yes.” the man hissed behind him, teasing Steve’s entrance with a fingertip.  “Nice and tight just like I remember.”
"You were blacking out. I honestly thought the memory would come back to you."
A puff of smoke erupted from Bucky’s mouth as he said, “What do you know about ‘Daddies’?”
“I just...I don’t know.” sighed Bucky, putting his bottle back on the table.
They had sex for hours the night before.
“We’ve both been having bad dreams and are both in therapy." Tony said, "Don’t you think moving back in here is going to make it worse?”
“I think this ordeal with the crazy stalker has made them see things differently.  Just give it a shot to talk to them.”
“You alright?” asked Bucky.  His chin was propped on top of the blonde’s head and he rubbed his back gently.
As he exited the building, he sent a text to Natasha asking her to call and check in on Steve.
The good news was, he had gotten the job at Painting and Pinot with a schedule of 4 evenings a week.  It was shitty part-time pay but he was kind of living his dream as an art teacher and he would get tipped by drunk ladies from time to time.  They would comment on how he was so handsome and slip him cash to “buy himself something nice”.
“It’s okay.  I understand.”  Steve replied happily.
“Oh come on,” laughed Scott, “she was all over Bucky the whole night.”
When Marco had originally sent him a message, he found out Bucky was in Brooklyn because Wanda and Natasha had tagged him at different restaurants in the area on Facebook.  Bucky had to tell them to stop doing that and take down the tags already in place.
“I don’t think we have been here since 6 years ago, remember?” asked Bucky, “It was Halloween and there was that horror drag queen pageant.”
A soft smile played on Bucky’s lips.  “I think it’s been long enough, ya know?”
“I just don’t want to drop the ball with either of you, ya know?” Steve writes.
“We got slow and I was...distracted.”
Bucky arrived at home and saw Steve was sitting on the balcony, covered in a blanket and sitting on the outdoor couch.
Bucky sighed and rolled his eyes, “I suggested we HAVE this conversation.  I’m not afraid to say it.”
He shushed him, “Just go back to sleep.”
“So we’ll pick your clothes up on the way back to my place.” suggested Tony, “This is a beautiful night for us and I want to celebrate on my big bed by worshipping you.”
“Yeah...since you’re back, I was thinking I could get the truck back over to my place and move the rest of my stuff.” Steve told him since there was only a truck load left.  The boxes he had brought over already were upstairs in Tony’s lab, waiting to be unpacked.
“So, what brought you into town?” asked Steve as they sat in a booth at the diner.
Steve giggled to himself and shook his head as he signed his check.
Deciding to take his chances and be daring, Steve said “Seriously though Buck, I’m not scrutinizing you or anything but, why DID you start hooking up with that guy?”
Steve examined his face carefully, “Yeah, I’d say so.  He uh...asked me to move in with him.”
Tony felt his heart crack at the edges.
“Oh, stoppit.” smiled Steve, hugging him from behind and kissing his cheek.
Steve grabbed the two plates to place them on the bar so they could sit there.
Wanda suddenly came outside and squealed happily when she saw her friend.  She was pretty drunk.  When the two attempted to hug, she lost her balance and laughed out loud.  Steve caught her.
“Sure thing.” he replied, helping Natasha off the stool and grabbing her things for her.  They went outside and got an uber.
They said goodbye and hung up.
That got him a smile out of the long haired man, “Okay, I think that could be arranged.”
Tony didn’t exactly tell Happy the details, but he had to tell Rhodey.  Those piercing eyes his oldest friend would give him made Tony unable to hide anything from him.  Of course Rhodey went off about Steve and how fucked up he was.  He suggested Tony kick him out and dump him.
Tony put his arm around him to cuddle Steve a little, “I love you.  I want my baby taken care of.”  “I love you too.” said Steve, smiling when he got a kiss placed on his own cheek.  “I appreciate that.  You know I just don’t like to impose. I...I don’t deserve you.”
At home, he could tell Steve wanted to talk more, but also was smart enough to try and not push too hard.  It was feeling like they were only roommates.  Steve continued to be pleasant to his boyfriend and try to have some conversation here and there, he wasn’t giving up.
The question made Bucky pause before he reached the shoe rack against the front door.  Turning to him and looking at the phone in his hand, he seemed scared.
By the time Steve sat back down alone on the couch with his beer, Wanda wandered back in the apartment to join him.
“I don’t know what to tell you.”
Steve whimpered and looked up at him. He was starting to sober up a little and contemplated going against Natasha's suggestion.  He tries to say he has something to tell Tony, but the words came out as slurred nonsense.
Bucky pulled back to look at him, “Alright, let’s get out of-”  He was interrupted by a man shoving him from behind.
Marco picked up after one ring.  “James?!  Hey James?!”
Steve crossed his arms defensively.  “It has.”
The typing dots started to pop up then disappear then pop up again.  She finally sent, “I mean, I know you guys had a fight right before you took over his place.”
"Why didn't you tell me I kissed you that night?"
Bucky shrugged, “I wanted to take you to breakfast, I was in town.  If you don’t have time, I understand.”  He stood up, making his camo-clad friend stand with him.
“Alright then.  Besides, you said the last time we went to a sports bar that ‘the straights have terrible taste in music’.” laughed Steve, washing his hands.
“Look at you.” smirked Steve.  The men came in holding boxes and unloaded them into the office.  When they left, the two men had some down time.
Steve poured the bottle of wine he was holding into the pitcher, “I have been talking to people.  Are you drunk?”  “Just tipsy, my love.” smiled Tony, stepping closer to him behind the counter, “I was just about to grab some water, but seriously you’ve done enough.  I’ll be in charge of the refreshments from now on.”  Steve recycled the empty bottle and took a step back, “Are you sure you got this?”
“Rhodey had just been cheated on and we were there to cheer him up.” Tony said calmly, still giving him a disappointed expression, “We talked about cheating, how it’s stupid and not worth it.  We made a pact to call and talk to each other if an opportunity presented itself.  Ring a bell?”
A few drinks into the night, Natasha was watching Bucky take care of a patron when she leaned in to Steve’s ear, “Hey.”
Tony actually laughed at that and leaned his now dry naked ass against his man’s thick pants.  (They were surprisingly soft on the outside.)
“Yeah,” laughed Bucky bitterly, “of course I knew.  This was fun while it lasted I guess.”
“You don’t have a problem with the fact that it’s your friend I’ve decided to see,” he squinted, “right?”
“You might have a point,” said Steve looking back at him lovingly, “It wouldn’t hurt to look.”
“Is the new place really that different?” asked Bucky.
“What?” Steve asked with humor in his voice, “You started talking to him again?”
“Still collecting family artifacts?” laughed Tony.
I love and appreciate any readers if they want to give their opinion. Just relax, it's all fictitious.
A few people came by to say hi to Steve or Tony since almost his entire staff was at the party.  Steve would introduce each person to Bucky every time and watch him get nervous and quiet.
Stifling a smile, he answered “Got some interviews set up.”
Steve’s chest clenched.  His stomach hurt.  He mentally said goodbye to that loving expression Tony was giving him.
Marco looked up at him through his lashes, “I don’t want to impose.”
“I know that.  You must have been tired of him asking.” he mused.
Steve followed her gaze and sighed, “Not great.”
“Sure, we’ll hit up a bodega.  Let’s go.”
Other than working and taking care of the penthouse, Steve would spend quiet nights at home with Tony.  He would rub the older man’s shoulders every afternoon when he came home from the office.  Sometimes he would pour him a drink.  Tony would vent about whatever was frustrating him and Steve would just listen and be attentive and affectionate before he went to his short class.
“These things happen.” said Steve, shaking his head with more tears appearing, “No one is out to get me.  I keep to myself.”
Steve slipped off his camo jacket to reveal a tight white cotton undershirt.  He nodded and sat at the bar to remove his house key, “Yeah, so I needed to give you this.”
"Fine. We'll go shopping."
The party had thinned out quite a lot and Steve went over to Bucky to ask if they could go home.  He was talking to Natasha and Clint at the dining table.
Steve looked like he was going to be sick.  “What?”
She always wore pencil skirt business suits, even on beautiful chilly weekends such as this one.
Immediately, Steve reached over to see the clock and sighed.
"No you didn't." Steve told him. The statement wasn't accusatory.  It was more of an observation.  He licked his lips.
“You’ve been through hard times.”
“Sir?  Hello?” Said the coffee stand attendant.
This was only the second time they had sex since they got out of living in the hotel suite.  It was so overwhelming and amazing, reminiscent of their very first time.  Tony stood a little taller and pumped in him faster, gently slapping the beautiful ass in front of him with his left hand.  He noticed Steve had slipped a hand down to start stroking himself.
They were sleeping in the same bed on occasion, but definitely were not having sex.  They weren’t being playful nor physically affectionate.
“I mean,” Bucky said a little bewildered by his comment, “I’m not really handsome with this.”  He held back his hair to expose his black eye completely.
“I lost both of my parents to cancer within a year of each other.  I was raised by my grandmother.” said Natasha.
Steve peeked in the office doorway down the hall, “Hey.”  Tony’s scowl turned to a soft smile as he turned his attention to the man.  “Hey!  I know I said I was done with work for the day, but I got this one email to finish.  I hope that’s okay.”
“Well, get used to it, babe.” Tony told him, “You got a lifetime of pleasant surprises coming.”
Both of Steve’s hands held the gun once more and stepped closer to Frank.  “Alright, you fucking prick.  Why’d you come here?  To kill me?”
Tony’s left hand started to creep across Steve’s thigh to cup his dick.
Steve smirked and nodded, “Yeah that’s what that means.  We can spend all the time in the world together.”  “Like we’ll be officially living in the same place?  Sounds like we need to celebrate,” said Tony in a sultry voice, “since we don’t have work tomorrow.”
excuse, it was the only reason he could come up with for his unusual behavior.
“$300, final offer.”
“I just...want him to at least talk to me.  Can you tell’im that for me?” he slurred.
“Tomorrow?”
“I think most people that go through something like us move out.  Seems reasonable.”
With a soft chuckle, Steve said, “Uh, I miss him?”
Once he dumped the clothes in the washer, he went into his office to start assembling moving boxes.
The harsh light of morning shone through the apartment.
With a laugh, Bucky was finally able to let go and step back.  “Thank you, so do you.”
It was  immediately obvious to Steve that he was crying.  “Let it out.” he whispered.
Steve couldn’t hide how disgusted he felt hearing that.  It was written all over his face.
“Yeah.” Bucky said, still staring at the picture, “I thought you said you had work though.”
Steve gave him a peck on the lips, “Thanks.  Just pour some more seafood dip, crackers, and put out the rest of the cheese platter.”  He started to back away to the door, watching his lover wave him away and start peering into the fridge.
The next morning, after his run with Sam, Steve went home to shower then packed up office boxes to bring to Tony's place.
“I can be late, I’m the boss.” said Tony, pulling him closer.
The couple situated themselves so that Tony was leaning against the arm rest and Steve was sort of laying on him.
Steve didn’t even notice it was there until it moved.  The car started down the street and the back window rolled up.
Steve nodded at him with an embarrassed laugh, “Yeah, that’s Tony.  Is my plan alright with you?”
After a while of uncomfortable silence, Steve said “I don’t want to pretend like it never happened.”  He kept eating.
The tall thin man turned to him and said he was looking for an address, then listed theirs down to the unit number.  Only 2 other tenants lived in the building.
When she walked away, Steve continued to eat his kimchi bean sprouts.  “So...maybe we should have that talk now.”
A desperate whimper came out of Tony’s throat while he closed his eyes.  A few tears fell down his cheeks as Frank told him “I know you aren’t used to being told what to do.  I have the fucking gun, and I’m in charge here.  Shut.  Up.”
Steve nodded and subtly got up to make his way down the hall and into Tony's bedroom.
"You want to spend Christmas in the hotel?" Asked Tony playfully.
---------------------------------------------
“I’m Tony Fucking Stark,” said Tony in a sing song tone, “I can make anything happen.  If I call Pepper right now she can have us 5 homes to view by tomorrow."
“Yeah, you’ve made that perfectly clear.”
“Yes.”
They dropped down opposite sides of the sofa.
Pausing for a second, Steve's eyes darkened. He looked scared and excited at the same time.
Steve shook his head "I don't care where we are for Christmas. I just want to cover our bases before we just move somewhere.  I know you've always kind of had money and lived this lifestyle but our cost of living has gotten steeper.  I haven't even gone back to work yet and you had to take care of all those medical bills and our suite."
Steve still occasionally was going to see Tony at his place, but it was only for meals and short visits.  Their sleepovers had stopped completely and Steve could tell his boyfriend was getting antsy.
That earned him a playful scowl.
“When’s the last time you saw them?”
“I know.” Steve said, not breaking his stare at Bucky, “He’s the best man I know, he didn’t deserve how he was treated.”  He realized he wasn’t telling her the whole story and fought with himself about revealing that much information to her.
Smirking, Bucky replied “Not even a little.”
“Why don’t I leave a little early for work and go get one made for me?” Bucky suggested as he took the key from him.
“I’ll see you at home in about 2 hours or so.” said Bucky, walking backwards to get back behind the bar.
When they were about to have their post-workout meal all freshly showered, Steve got a call from Tony.  He answered and kept eating, “Hey, you’re on speaker.”
Steve shook his head slowly, "Let's just go to bed, hun. I said I was sorry.  I didn't mean it the way I said it. You know I didn't."
“Afternoon?  One-ish.” Bucky replied.
“Did you love Madison?” he asked daringly.
Bucky took off his jacket and hung it on the rack by the door.  He kicked off his boots and looked around the apartment, like he was trying to decide.
Steve took a deep breath and wiped his tears while staring at the front door, “I wanna tell Tony.  I need to.”  He had a drunken mumble to his voice and most of his words were slurred together.
Steve made his way over to his own bed to sit on the edge, “We just argued a little bit.  It was nothing.  I have some good news though.”
Steve typed “It just sounds like you don’t want me to contact you anymore and you are just telling me your plans before you block me.”
“I need to look at those messages.” remembered Bucky, staring ahead at nothing and looking grim.
Bucky couldn’t help but check him out rather obviously.  “Hey.  Uh...come in.”
Steve spoke with a mouth full of food, “Bucky here can sell ice to a polar bear.  Always been a smooth talker.”
“You here with me?” asked Steve softly, staring into his eyes.
“What about you?  What’ve you been up to?” he asked.
“I just have a feeling I am going to need something to hold onto.” he moaned, pulling Bucky into more smoldering kisses.
Sometimes Steve couldn’t sleep and had to go to the couch on his own.  He would put music on in his headphones to zone out, listening to Sia and his sad emo ballads from the early 2000’s.  He no longer could go to bed with silence at all anymore.  A distraction was necessary for him to shut up his brain long enough and get any rest.
Bucky came over to join him on the couch and pushed back Steve’s hair, “I’m about to get cleaned up for bed.”  He waited timidly after that statement to see if Steve still was okay with them sharing a bed.
Tony was staring in horror and urging his boyfriend on silently, flinching every time a hit connected.  A few more punches landed around Steve’s eye.  The two men on the floor rolled over completely as Frank would not let go of the gun.  In the struggle, a shot went off.
It was good that Steve did acknowledge that his friend was intentionally being short with him and that was okay if it was helpful to setting new boundaries between them.  However, Steve eventually let him know that he decided to go to therapy for their situation because he could barely sleep anymore.
Bucky stood at the register as he tried not to laugh and show he was listening.
“Apologize?” asked Steve incredulously, “Why do YOU need to apologize?”
Bucky even hugged Steve and Tony before he left that night, texting Natasha immediately to tell her the good news.  She expressed her happiness for them.
Bucky glanced back at him and saw in his face that Tony wasn’t annoyed or angry.  There was only sincerity there.  “No, you’re right.  I uh…,” he cleared his throat, “I’ve never been good at this kind of thing.  Usually I just flee.”
He obviously was being too needy.
Bucky immediately sent “I know you know.”
Before he could stop it, Bucky felt hot tears rolling down his face.  He tried not to show it.
It was like he knew he was being lied to years ago but now it was being confirmed.  Of course Steve understood he was coming out of a medically induced coma after being bombed.
Scott, Bucky’s bartender friend, came over from time to time to watch football games.  He had partial custody over his daughter and he was an ex-con therefore Scott never went out anywhere crowded anymore.  (Leftover claustrophobia from prison.)  The two men both welcomed the distraction once a week.
“Stop feeling sorry for me.  You know I hate that.” it was obvious Bucky was holding back a sob as he said that.
“Oh really?” she said in a monotone, making eye contact with the green coat guy.
“Like, thanks for telling me that right now,” said Steve sarcastically.
Steve nodded, “Yeah, absolutely, go be hostess.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Pleasantly agreeing, Steve announced to him that he was almost completely finished packing and soon he could officially change his address.  He told him he had a day off so as not to rouse questions.
“Just wanted to let you know, I’m going to hang out at Bucky’s tomorrow.”
"This is not up for debate.  You and I should give each other space.  We can't be trusted together anymore.” said Bucky sternly.
Tony re-emerges with bottled water and gets down to sit on the rug next to his boyfriend. He rubbed Steve's back slowly as he drank it.  "Small sips, baby."
“Are you tired?”
Steve kissed him passionately, then took the 40 minute trip home.
Steve smiled, “So you forgive me?”
“But you’re always an emotional disaster.” Steve said seriously, then smirked at him.
“Um, how are you feeling?” asked Bucky, trying to keep their eyes locked.  “Better, just not my best.” answered Tony, “Doing what I need to.  The doctors say my arm looks good, given the circumstances.”
Steve kept on his t-shirt but changed into his tight, black “fuck me” jeans that hugged his ass sinfully.
Steve rolled his eyes, “Bastards.”  A few minutes of comfortable silence passed.
The sound of Marco sniffing and sobbing lightly was pulling Bucky apart at the seams.
“Yeah, me too.” replied Bucky.  He could tell Natasha was holding back on pressing the problem between him and Steve.  “What do you think I should do?” he asked.
Steve glanced over at Natasha who was getting up to go to the bathroom.  He instinctively slid her belongings closer to him on the bar.
“He does…Bucky just-”
“Tony.” said Steve firmly, “Before we have make up sex, we need to talk.”
“I love you too.  Happy Anniversary.” smiled Steve.  His hand was lifted to the brunette man’s lips and a kiss was placed on his knuckles.
“D’you think you should go back to group with Sam?” Tony asked.
“Not feeling spontaneous today?” Bucky asked, putting the lid on his bottle.
“Why did you think you could live with me?” asked Steve, sounding genuinely curious.
“Keep making noises for me.” whimpered Bucky in his ear, “I love to hear it.”
Steve grabbed the gun and ran into the kitchen, “I’m coming...I got you.”  He grabbed a towel and banged the panic button under the kitchen counter a few times.  In a flash, Steve was over next to Frank searching his pockets for the handcuff keys.  When he found them, Steve rushed behind Tony to get off his restraints.
The three of them walked into the living room where Tony was sitting on the sofa.  “Hey there honey bear.” he smiled.
“Shit…” Bucky groaned at the sight of his wet hole in the sunlight.  “Condoms?”
The angle hurt Steve’s neck, so he moved them to stand and face each other and kiss deeply.  Tony shook his head and looked him over, “You’re so fucking sexy.  I can’t even take it.”  Steve smiled and kissed him again, “You’re the sexy one.”
The next message that came in simply asked “Can I call you?”
Steve opened the door in a fancy grey cashmere sweater and matching pants.
“How was work last night?” asked Steve, trying to start the conversation somehow.
Steve’s therapist had been trying to work on a plan of action with him to break the news to his boyfriend.  Dr. Banner had told him that what he was currently doing would seem as if he’d been buttering Tony up this whole time.  Steve didn’t see it that way, he just wanted his boyfriend to see that he was putting in effort in their relationship.
Later that week, Bucky dominated all of his interviews.  He decided to work at the most upscale place which was a whiskey bar in the middle of Manhattan.
He could hear Tony turning off the shower and getting out to start drying off.
“Since you came back from battle?” asked Natasha.
Steve laughed, “I mean...I don’t know.  This is the first real relationship with a man I have ever been in.  I don’t really know how all that is supposed to work.  Also I’ve never been with someone long enough to even consider marriage.  I guess...I haven’t thought about it at all...”
A small smile appeared on Steve’s lips when he looked to his left at the man, “You need a play by play?”
Pepper was walking with him through the long lobby to his car out front.
The palms of Steve's hands made a slap noise when they hit the surface. On instinct, he was arching his back perfectly like a feline. "That gorgeous body." groaned Tony, lightly grabbing the man's throat with his right arm.  "Can I get you ready for me?  I need you right now."
The hope was that this new exposure would attract more foreign business.
“Sure.” said Steve happily, “Sounds nice.”
“Right now?  That’s what we need to do?” Tony huffed.  “Who?” Steve asked, looking back and forth between the two of them.
Bucky holds his arms open, “Stop.”
Was it all just too good to be true?
Steve showered and practiced his reactions in the mirror so he was prepared.  He settled on a simple black tailored suit.  His tie was a red and gold pattern, Tony’s favorite tie he had bought for him.
Bucky snorted to himself as he leaned against the railing to sip his coffee and avoid eye contact.
“That’s why I put that there.” Bucky said, nodding at the water bottle next to him.
“Nothing…Tony’s coming home this afternoon.”
“Tony’s okay?” she asked.
Bucky had hung out with Wanda on occasion but didn’t know her that well.  He saw no harm so he said “Why not?  See what she’s up to.”  It was nice and refreshing for him, and kept his mind off darker things.
Steve’s stomach felt tight, like he was guilty of something.
“How was work last night?” he asked happily, taking off his undershirt too.
Steve pouted up at her and shook his head.  “Alright,” she said, standing up, “let’s get you up these steps.  Do you think you can take ‘em one at a time?”
“We have to get rid of them anyways.  They creep me out now.” said Steve, squinting at them.  He had to see his boyfriend tied up in one chair and contained Frank in another.  Tony put his good arm around his boyfriend’s waist, “Looks like we will be furniture shopping again soon then.”
“You took jobs from me ever since you started at that base.  Those jobs belonged to me.  I applied for them right beside you and you kept snatching them over and over.  Then you got your cushy desk job and I ended up an IT bitch.  All because you saw more combat than me!  They felt sorry for you.”
“Kay.”  came Bucky’s bitter voice as he dropped in the grounds and water to start the pot to brew.  He walked quickly into the adjacent laundry room to put on pants from the dryer.
“Okay, so I am a little sadder than I’m used to right now, okay?  I’ll get over it.  I had to go to therapy for it.”
Steve joined them in the living room, looking nervous.  Tony took his leave and the bedroom door shut behind him.
"Hey sweet pea!" Tony's voice boomed happily in his ear.
They arrived at the restaurant and were seated in a dim booth in the corner.  There weren’t that many people in there that night since it was a Thursday.
"Indiana." She repeated.  "Did you see your sister?"
Glancing down at his phone, Steve noticed a text from Tony that said “Hope you’re having fun, baby!  I love you.”
The comment was so sweet, Steve couldn’t help but smile as he continued eating.
“Sorry.” commented Tony as he sat back in his seat.
The long haired man had a tight black Jack Daniels t-shirt under his denim jacket and his eyes looked like he didn’t sleep much the night before.
“No you did NOT!” Steve yelled.  Both of them broke into cackles.  It was just like old times.  Steve shoved his friend’s shoulder playfully, making the brunette man fall backward a little.
As Steve went in there to turn it off, his boyfriend followed him, the blanket wrapped around his shoulders like a cape.
"He bugged me about why I wasn't married yet, then asked if I was 'still a faggot' in front of everyone."
Bucky went up to Tony, “Hey man, I just want to thank you for all you are doing for me.  I honestly can’t describe how much I appreciate it.”
They talked more about Tony’s trip until the food came, followed by their friends.  It was a nice little gathering.  Everyone left full of food and alcohol.
“Hey.” smiled Steve, “Did you make good money tonight?”
They loaded the truck and Steve followed behind in his hired car.
“I know we’ve been through hell today.” began Steve, speaking carefully and watching the side of his boyfriend’s face, “And I know I technically saved you, but...you know, you don’t have to feel obligated to forgive me just because I did a good deed.”
That got a small side smile out of Steve as he fussed with his tea bag.  “Totally!  I’m actually...kind of bummed to be moving out of this neighborhood.”
“Sure.” he said, heading into the master suite.
After Steve had sat down and started eating, Bucky shuffled in the kitchen to grab his plate.
“What about Tony?” insisted Bucky.
“They probably miss you.  You should go.”
“Look, you just have to calm down and step back and figure how to fight this.  Wait to see what Tony says.” Bucky said with a small smile, “Alright?”
“Too tired.  Already falling aslee...” Tony trailed off.
For the first time in a while, Tony sat down next to him to have breakfast.
Managing to avert his gaze, Bucky could only make it down to Steve’s pouty lips.  He wondered if he licked into his mouth right now if he could still catch the familiar flavor of the whisky…
Steve grabbed Bucky's drink for him and nudged Tony to show him where they were going.
As they faced each other in the middle of the dance floor, quite a few lustful eyes were scanning over them.
“Dad’s got cancer and it’s causing him to have other health problems.  My mom passed from cancer a while ago.  If something happens to him, I’ll only have my sister, really.  We didn’t associate with our distant family much growing up.”
“It’s okay, Stevie.  I know where I am.”
“Sam this is Bucky, my oldest friend in the world.”
Tony turned around and leaned up to kiss his man, "You are so good to me, my love."
The man had his head down and his knees curled up to his chest, therefore Steve couldn’t tell if he was sleeping or not.  He lived in a building with a buzzer door, but it was busted sometimes and his older more senile neighbors were trusting enough to let people in from time to time.
“You told me to leave.” mentioned Steve with an amused tone.
“Am I pushing you away right now?  I’m replying, aren’t I?”
The breath caught in Steve’s throat.  The brunette man was being very frisky.
Natasha stepped closer to hold his hand, “Not gonna give me details?”
There was an obvious stiffness to Steve’s shoulders.
Steve turned off the TV and stretched, “How was your night?” he whispered. He was shirtless in pajama pants, his voice raspy.
That boy was still in there even though Steve was almost taller and way more muscular than him.
Steve had given him the closet space in his office and made him as comfortable as possible.  They got a nice air mattress for Bucky and put it in the bedroom.
Bucky blinked at him for a second then sat up and stretched, "Sounds good. I'm coming." He rasped.
Laughing, Tony sat back, “Sorry, I just love you in a suit.”
“You just acted weird before you left yesterday.”
Bucky shrugged and leaned against the fridge on the other side of the kitchen, “I’m fine.  Just waiting for my coffee.”
Marco kept his hands on the other man’s face, he seemed to be examining him closely.  “We have been chatting this whole time and you never mentioned you’ve been stressed about something.  I can see it in your forehead.  You got worry lines.  Have you been sleeping?”
How do you like it?  Please feed me comments, give my life meaning.  It will get more scandalous.
“I mean, would that be alright for you?”
“If he is not there for you to entertain, you should bring that cute ass over to my place tonight and stay over.”
“I’m still sorry...for a lot of things, but especially if I caused your family to disown you.” Bucky told him.  They held eye contact firmly.
Bucky had just set up his Xbox in the living room of his place.
Bucky looked up from his menu sheepishly, “I mean...didn’t want to stay in Buffalo, that’s for sure.”
His redness finally started to clear up on his face but his eyes were a little puffy.  He held an icy glass of water up to his face to attempt to not be so obviously upset when he got back to Tony.
“Yes.  Steve and I did a tour together in Pakistan.”
“I can’t right now!  I’ll ruin his focus for his presentation.” said Steve, “I mean, eventually they will probably call him in for an interview.”
“He knew you’d be jealous, like you are right now.” she said.
"Tony!  It’s about that time." Pepper's voice carried through the door.
Shaking his head, Steve scooped the items up in his arms.  “Tony.” he called softly.
“What’d you tell them?” asked Steve.
“That sounds fucking delicious.” groaned Tony pleasantly, looking up at his boyfriend, “You have to make that for me later.”
Eventually, they had to go back to their penthouse to check on the repairs.  The walls were fixed and in the process of being repainted.  One evening when they stopped by,  Tony, still in his sling, walked over to the pile of dining furniture shoved in a corner.  He leaned in further to examine the chairs as Steve watched him from across the room.
“How…” Tony pondered the word he was looking for, “sentimental.  Sounds perfect, love.”
“Um,” Tony cleared his throat to tell her, “I was the one that was shot.”
Steve’s arms went around the other man’s torso and he hugged him close.  “I love you too, Tony.” he whimpered, “I’m sorry.  I’m so fucking sorry.”  They started to cry together in their tight embrace.
“C’mere.” said Bucky softly, opening his arms.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Long as you want, punk.” he replied.
The hand pinching his forehead dropped, “It’s not just because of you, your sister had something to do with it.  She wants me dead.  We BOTH fucked up.  I’m sure your whole family knows about us and hates me by now.”
Hope you liked it.
“Alright psycho,” said Steve, “why would you need to bring this?”  He gestured to the gun he was holding.
“Why?” laughed Steve, finally putting one of his beers on the short table in front of them.
The brunette drank the rest of his coffee and perked up to listen.
Steve shrugged, “That’s nice and all but I was hoping we could spend some private time together.”
There was a tickle on the side of Tony’s neck as he felt his boyfriend inhale his scent.  He told him happily, “I missed hanging out with you..”
“Maybe that’s best.” agreed Bucky, “I’m trying to get someone to hire me.  I can’t do that if they think I’m an emotional disaster.”
Bucky dropped the phone on the coffee table to decide how to respond.  He wants to make sure Steve isn’t delusional but doesn’t want him to feel like he is being berated.  There was still a need to be bluntly honest.
Steve ate his food quietly before admiring his suit, “You look nice.  I love that red tie on you.”
“Yeah, definitely.” said Bucky over his shoulder, “Let's get you a drink before we park on the floor.”
“Still human resources and job placement.”
Steve looked down at that comment but he nodded as Bucky let go of him.  He swiftly walked around the kitchen wall to join Bucky at the bar.
Keeping his mouth by Steve’s ear, Tony said “Hey babe, got your drink.”  He looked up at him with a questioning look, but got up to stand behind his chair.  Their friends on the sofa started to talk amongst themselves once again.
Soon there was a knock at the front door.  Promptly, as the door opened, Marco emerged with a big smile on his face and connected their lips eagerly.
Bucky started to go to the table but Tony stopped him and held out his hand to shake.  “Good to meet you, Bucky.”
While they were half-watching a show and saving different therapists’ websites, Tony kept staring at the sadness still very prominent in Steve’s eyes.  “Other than fronting the bill, is there anything else I can do?” he asked.
“The problem was,” Steve said apprehensively, “he made some poor decisions, but his old partner um...overreacted.”
Taking his remaining sandwiches, Tony sat on the chair on the opposite side of the room to eat them.  They chewed in silence for a while until Steve finished the first biscuit and thanked him.  In return, Tony only gave a nod without looking his way.
“I wonder WHY you got demoted.” said Tony sarcastically.
“I’m fine.” lied Steve.
The two men started to sway their hips and get a feel for the techno remix of Adele.
“Why should I?”
Bucky thought to himself for a second.  She totally was playing dumb about this whole thing.  “I’m guessing since you’re his best friend, Steve told you what happened.” said his text.
“Then let me go.” sighs Bucky, looking right into his friend’s face and looking like his walls were breaking down.  He looked tired, like he didn’t know how much fight he had left in him.
“Just me.” Steve wrote, feeling his stomach quiver as he saw the dots indicating Bucky typing.
“Oh please,” interjected Sam, “Have you ever come to the Bronx?  Yes they can.”
“What way?” asked Bucky, following her as she cleaned.
Steve sipped his beer and looked over the rail of the balcony at the city below.
“I thought you’d be mad at me since you were forced to quit.”
When Tony was free, he kept his arms stiff from the pain.  Steve sat down the gun to carefully and quickly take off the jacket and shirt to his suit.  Tony was left in a bloody white t-shirt, hissing and whimpering.  “It was a through and through, I think.” said Steve as he examined the wound.  He ripped the towel in his hand to tie it around Tony’s arm.  “Here, put pressure.”
Sighing, Bucky shook his head, “Why does everybody think I want Natasha?”
“But you were jerking off to her!” cried Steve before snapping his mouth shut from the embarrassing admission.
“Cheated on someone...with their brother.”
Pain killers were necessary to get the man through the day so that meant he couldn’t drink during one of the most stressful times of his life.
With a laugh, Steve said "I'm telling her you said that."
After a minute, Tony sauntered out wearing a pair of jeans and holding two t-shirts and a blazer.  "Which one, babe?"
Steve scoffed, “How?”
“Was I too mean to him?” Bucky asked in a small voice between sobs.
A few minutes went by before she responded “Okay, yeah.  He told me, but only because he was miserable and I pressed for information.  I knew he was sad.”
Upon arrival at Steve’s, the two men plopped down on the sofa together.
Steve wrote back that he would be going to the store soon and asked if he had any preferences for dinner.  “Not really.  They did end up keeping my contract, by the way.” wrote Tony.
“Yep, they will be over around 5.  I already got a food delivery put in.”
“What!” scoffed Steve, “I barely just got moved in.”
Sitting back on his heels, Steve waited for him to start breathing normally.
Realizing that wasn’t a
“Understandable.  You don’t need to be scared of me though.” said Tony, “Of Course I was angry for a while and I still am but I have definitely evened out.  I was betrayed, sure, but I can be an adult and know when to move on.”
“I’ll go get a phone and go job hunting tomorrow.  Are you cool with me listing this place as my address for now?”  asked Bucky, combing his fingers through his hair mindlessly.
“Oh yeah.”
“Like, let him take over the lease?  That could be okay.” nodded Steve, seeming pleasantly surprised.
Bucky smiled at his joke and pocketed the new phone.
As he slid the two full plates across the counter, Bucky put his hand over one of Steve’s.
“I love you.” came Tony’s defeated sigh.
They hear footsteps and yelling of police officers coming up the stairs to burst through the front door.  Steve immediately disarmed and handed over the weapon as they swarmed Frank.  “He needs a medic!” Steve told the cops as he rushed over to his boyfriend.  2 officers walked them to the elevator to ride down to a waiting ambulance outside.
When he was finished, Bucky crumpled up the paper bag and grabbed his coffee.  The brunette man already had his shoes on and he was heading to the door, “Just lock up when you leave.”
“Hi.” said Bucky casually, sitting on the seat next to the sofa.
Bucky looked confused for a second then scratched the back of his head, “Look, I’m going to make coffee, but keep talking.  I’m listening.”
"Still on for tomorrow. Lunch time right?"
Brows pinching together, Bucky said “No, I know spending my free time with Wanda has definitely been the reason you and I haven’t seen each other lately.  I’m already doing it, and that wasn’t intentional, by the way.  I’ll try and make sure that doesn’t happen.”
With a shake of his head, Steve said softly, “Tony, I didn’t mean that.  We’re too angry, we’re saying things-”
The two of them sat down to breakfast at the bar.
Steve joined him on the sofa, “Yeah, today was pretty bittersweet, huh?”
“In a way, I guess.”
---------------
“You’re still a good person.” Bucky assured him.  “You’re not a piece of shit like me.”
“I think if I keep my contract, Rogers keeps his job.” Tony said to the Army officer.
“Hey.” smiled Steve, undoing his camo jacket.
“I would say so.  Very upscale and like, modern.  It’s like 4 stories.  Tony owns his place.”
Steve rubbed his back in large circles.
“Do whatever you feel like we need to.  I just have thought about quitting the army for a while now.”
Steve pulled back to smile at the man in his arms.  They were embracing and swaying.  “Surprised?” Tony laughed.
“Bucky?” said Steve with concern,  “Did I?”
Bucky wasn’t one to know how to take compliments.  He just laughed uncomfortably and let his hair fall back over his eye.  “Well thanks.”
------------------
Bucky admitted to Steve after the 3rd night of them sharing a bed that he’d never felt so rested in his life.
“Is Bucky working tonight?” Tony blurted out.
"Yeah." Bucky took out his phone, showing her a photo of him and a very pregnant Becca.
“Oh, I know first hand.”
Steve had started drinking water for the past hour so he was in a nice mellow middle ground where he would be completely sober soon.
When he felt it was enough, Tony started to thrust two fingers into his tight opening.  He then started to pulse them in a medium rhythm.  “God dammit!” groaned Steve when his boyfriend hit his prostate.  After a few minutes of stretching him, Tony finally began to get ready to push himself in.
The two men shook hands.  Bucky put his hair up in a bun, “Nice to meet you.”
Slowly he helped Tony make his way to the couch.  Tony hissed as he sat down, continuing to press on his wound and trying to control his breathing.  Steve still pointed the gun at Frank.
Slowly, Steve moves off the door and stands aside.  He doesn’t know what else to do.  “I understand.  I’ll leave you alone for as long as you want.  Just...hug me before you go.”
Steve pulled back, “You gotta go?”
After a few months of casually going out together, Tony finally asked to make them official.
The elevator left then dinged again, this time his boyfriend emerged.  He didn’t look pleased or excited and he was fiddling with his smartwatch.
Steve started to drink one of his beers when he noticed a handsome guy sitting a few feet away checking out his friend.
She came over one evening after her shift in her camo outfit.
Tony said in a low voice, “I want to cum with you again before you leave.”
Steve laid down under the covers first, “We just hung out and talked.”  He let himself sink into his plush pillows that matched the deep red duvet.  The bed shifted as Tony climbed in next to him and propped up on his side to face him.  “What did you guys talk about?”  He was really pressing for more details.
Eventually they got hungry and Natasha suggested they order Korean food for delivery.  Bucky is enthused and calls up his favorite place right away.
She asked why, but he told her it would be better if Steve explained himself.
The whole week Steve did keep in touch with Tony, but only through text messages.  The businessman was far too preoccupied to even get to facetime his boyfriend once.
“What else do you remember?  Do you feel okay?” he pressed casually, staring at his phone.
“What were you diagnosed with?” he asked in a generally interested tone.
That made Tony smile lightly.  With Steve’s help they carefully got Tony’s top off.
"You got it." Steve said, kissing his hand.
Tell me what you think.
Bucky got himself a bottle of water and the two of them went over to the benches behind a wall so the music wasn’t so loud.  It was dark back there with Rainbow lights in facing every direction.
“Steve?” asked Natasha softly.
Bucky is at home on his day off, cleaning the apartment and hanging black out curtains.  A text comes through on his phone from Marco that says “I’m close by.  Be there soon!”
“So, I’m guessing you know about this?” asked Pepper, turning on the TV to the news about them.
Steve said innocently “Well, yeah.  Just for a little while.  You got that thing with Rhodey tomorrow and I’ll keep in contact with you.”
The box opened to reveal a little golden key.
A single tear fell down Steve’s cheek as Bucky got up from the bar to clean his plate in the sink.  He finished his food silently, watching Bucky go to the front door wordlessly and put on his shoes.
Chapter 8: A Chance to Even Up the Score
He forced a laugh, “Yeah, we’ll see.”
When he walked out in his long sleeve shirt and pajama pants, he was surprised to find the man still sleeping on the couch.  His blanket had been kicked off below his thighs and tight calvin klein boxer briefs exposed.  (As well as his perfect apple shaped ass.)
“Tony…?” Steve asks softly.  Tony whips around to face him angrily and roughly wipes his tears away with the back of his hand.  The older man calmed his breath and stomped (around the broken glass) back over to the bed.  He stood next to it so as to tower over Steve.
It was a normal occurrence lately for the two of them to have discussions about all the lifestyle changes that were going to have to happen when they live together.  This was only another one added to the list.
As soon as Steve applied his cologne, he got the message that his boyfriend was outside.
“You know what’s happening.” laughed Steve bitterly, wiping his face again, daring to look back at him.
“I'd like some…” Steve’s email notification on his phone interrupted him.  He reached over to the nightstand on his side and grabbed it.  “Oh yeah, I was expecting an important package.  It’s already been delivered.  I have to run to my place to get it before work.  Sorry babe, I don’t think I have time.”
Bucky was saving his paychecks for a place of his own, therefore Steve was pleased with letting him do chores as rent payment.  He honestly never wanted to ask money from Bucky anyway.  What kind of friend would he be?
Steve quickly grabbed the remote near the bed and turned the local news on tv, but muted.  Sure enough there was footage of Frank being arrested playing on a loop.
It was too dark in the living room for Steve to see clearly but he didn't move as the outline of Tony’s head laid on his chest.  Tony covered the two of them in a large blanket.
Bucky showed up to their suite in a full (depression) beard with his hair partially pulled up and his heavy winter coat on.
The look on Steve’s face turned to anger, “He’s not fucking doing that.  We’ve always been there for each other.”
Before he could react, Tony was staring at a gun in Frank’s right hand, pointed at Tony’s stomach.  Frank calmly told him, “We’re going to go inside now, Mr.Stark.  We’re going to wait for your boyfriend.”
They had already been there a few hours and some people had left already.
Bucky looked down at the drowsy giant man on top of him.  “You’re not falling asleep on me, right?”
“Sure.” snickered the blonde man bitterly.
As they finished eating, Steve readied his credit card to pay the check.
Steve was leaning toward him listening intensely.  He bit his lip and felt his chest ache for his friend.
Steve was given a friendly pat on the shoulder from his friend.
Tony started to unlock his front door, asking casually “What is this about?”
Natasha was texting him about finally coming clean.  Steve asked her if he should tell Bucky, she said he should.  Nervously, he sent Bucky a “you still awake?” text.
“The world stopped turning when I realized he shot you.” said the taller man, sounding like he was choking back tears.
Bucky nodded once.  “And the money?”
“Aw, d’you want me to have a personal chef drop by?” Tony asked, seeming a little excited.
Bucky laughed, “I told you that you might as well give up while you’re ahead, Scott.”
"Are you trying to make me into a housewife?" asked Steve.
“This must have devastated you.  I should have been here.”
Steve timidly put an arm around his shoulders.  “I get that.”
“We’ll see how it goes.” Bucky laughed.
Tony’s face was calm and content.  When he realized Steve was staring, he looked over at him amused “What?”
Finally the brunette man was wandering naked over to his closet for clothes.
“What?  He has co-workers right?  At that job that I provided a new wardrobe for?” demanded Tony.
“I mean, I trust that is all you guys did.” said Tony pleasantly, “Honest, I’m just curious.”
“Well, I guess the other thing that’s bothering me is…” he paused, fighting back more tears, “I just got you back as my friend, Buck.  I went for so long without even a text from you.  It would suck if I lost you again to a new girlfriend.”  Steve succumbed to the tears even though he wiped them constantly against his jacket sleeve.
Why acknowledge it?  Nothing actually happened.
“Chellya later.” Steve mumbled.
“Pakistan.  The explosion.  Always is.”
“Gotcha.” said Steve casually.  Bucky grabbed his duffel bag and went back into the dining room to ask Steve for a hug.
Steve put his own mug on the coffee table, “No, not at all.”
Natasha suddenly looked bubbly and happy, “You know who could help us eat it?  Wanda!  Would you mind if she came over?”
He wiped his tears then explained the whole situation to her from the very beginning.
“No, he kind of asked me some questions about her.  She has been busy lately, I guess they’ve been hanging out.”
“Yeah, pretty much.” he shrugged.
“How was you guys' night?” asked Bucky, averting his eyes back to his book.
It was nearly 7:30pm when he decided to wake up his friend.  Going in the bedroom quietly, Steve snuck over to where Bucky was laying on his side snoring, mouth wide open.
“Love you.” said Steve with a mouthful of spinach.
"Depends, would you like that?" Tony said, ducking his head to catch his lips.
Bucky pinched his forehead anxiously.
When they pulled apart, and he saw any and all emotion vanish from Steve, he told him “I don’t want to ruin what other people have for my own selfish reasons.  I came here to run away from the last time I did that.  I don’t want you to feel guilty either.”
Bucky sighed, “I’m sorry.  I was wrong for not saying anything.  You are right.”
“So...could I come by say 6 or 7?  I’ll bring dinner.” asked Tony.
"Thank you." murmured Bucky, leaning his head on Steve's shoulder.
Tony managed to pause and ask “So, you don’t want the chicken anymore?  You’re about to go to the point of no return here.”
“I can’t do that anymore.” Bucky told him. “Causes more trouble than it’s worth.”
“I mean, he knows I got an extension.  He’s trying, Tony.  Bucky only just got a job.  You said you understood that you can’t rush these things.” said Steve, turning to him with his brows furrowed.  He was standing only in his white shirt and boxers.
"How was it, anyway?" Steve asked.
Rolling his eyes, Steve got his things together and hurried over to Tony still sitting on the bed.  They shared a short kiss and said I love you.  The blonde man hurried out the door in his army uniform, overnight bag slung over his shoulder.
“Wanda has been single for a while too.  It’s good for her to get back out there again.” she assured him.
“Cuddle up to me and give him a dirty look.” huffed Bucky, sitting closer and situating the ashtray between them.
"Aw, that's okay. I'll take care of you."
Giving a shrug, Steve said “If by laugh you mean cry like a fucking teenager.”  He sniffled for emphasis.  Bucky pouted, “Want me to suck you off or something to make you feel better?”
The two women frowned at him then looked down at their own lunches in thought.
Strong hands cupped Steve’s red face, “No, you aren’t.”  The older man’s face looked hurt but still concerned with his boyfriend’s feelings.
“No, but that’s how it sounded.”
“You didn’t have to wait up for me.” Bucky told him, huffing a laugh.
Tony nodded and said “Alright.  See you later.”  Unsure of himself, he kissed Steve’s cheek before leaving.
“Nice.” groaned Tony happily, scrunching his face up with enthusiasm.
“You look really nice.” said Bucky.
“I’m just being honest.” said Tony, rolling his eyes.
Steve put one of his out feet behind him to steady them both and moved his hands, interlocking his fingers behind Bucky’s neck.
The brunette man was still breathing heavy.  Looking around the room, he nodded.  “I-I think so.”
They were brushing their teeth at the double sink.
“You don’t have to tell me.  I’m proud of you.  You did what was best.”
Shakily, the other man admitted he was terrified.  “We are just starting the next step in our relationship.  In therapy, I figured out that I probably did it because of the bomb dropped on me about work and he was there to comfort me.  I know that’s not the greatest reason, I mean, there was obvious tension there from before.”  Steve’s voice cracked as he said “It will never happen again.”
Was that just a promise of what was to come?  Bucky freshened up just in case.
That made Bucky feel a mix of emotions.  Should he make it clear that he doesn’t want to restart what they had?  Should he not say anything and try to have a good time?  Was this visit supposed to be strictly friendly?
Steve was able to get back on a work out schedule with Sam again since he moved back closer to him.  Sam had helped his friend find community centers that needed art teachers and he volunteered for every one of them, filling up most of his week.
“See you then.”
“I know I just…” said Steve in a tiny voice, “Are you okay?”
When he finally did open his eyes, his skin and prosthetic hands both fought against the ones holding Bucky’s face.  Tears were falling down his cheeks as he finally focused on the man hovering over him.
“Yeah, so I’ll probably be over there for the day.  Spending the night most likely.”
“Is that hypothetical?” asked Steve, “Where would you go?”
Tony and Steve were happier, laughing together and attempting to go out a bit more.  Their story wasn’t so popular anymore but the paps were still following them around.  It was still so bad that Tony had to “buy out” a rooftop beer garden for a few hours just so they could have dinner...in the blistering cold.
“What if I get hungry?” asked Steve playfully, putting his phone on silent and dropping it on the coffee table.
Bucky looked over at him in disbelief, “Really?”
“Oh yeah?  Is Bucko listening then?”
Shuddering pleasantly from his words, he said “Hun, I’d love that but I need to get going.”
Bucky had been going out with the couple for dinner and having them over to watch random sports.  He was joining Steve, Wanda, and Natasha every week at karaoke, never once offering to actually sing.
“For...life?” Tony asked.
He wasn’t sure if he believed him, but Steve nodded anyway.
“Didn’t have to.” huffed Tony, running a hand up over his face and through the front of his hair.
Did that really just happen?  Of course it did.
“We can wait until we get back to deal with them if you want.”
“Interrogations are kind of her thing.”
“No way!” Bucky said with an appreciative whine.  He was touched.
“Now I kinda feel like a dick.” Natasha said to Steve.
“Start making payments next month.  $500 a month.  Cool?"  ''Sure,” said Bucky.
One day, Steve was walking home in the fresh spring air and decided to grab himself a coffee from a stand.  While he waited in line, he was mindlessly scrolling through Facebook.  A specific post caught his attention, making him gasp out loud and get glares from the people near him.
Bucky spread his cheeks with both hands and began a deep rhythm.  Steve cried out with each thrust against his ass.
Bucky snickered, “Madison called me when she found me and Marco.  I was trying to turn the ringer off and get dressed at the same time and I’m...ya know, one fucking handed.  She busted the office door open and I dropped it right into Marco’s fish tank.  Then all hell broke loose, so I said ‘fuck it, I’ll get a new phone’.”
They hung up and Bucky stood, taking his hand, “How about for the rest of the day, we don’t think too much about this and just...enjoy it?”
“No, not at all.  She wasn’t that bad.”
With closed eyes, Steve let his mind drift to his future decorating projects in the apartment he was itching to start on.  The sound of Tony’s voice drifting over the rushing water sounds.  “Baby face,” he called in adoration.
“I’ll be fine.  I just don’t want anyone stealing my package.  It’s a one of a kind.”
“Right.”
They pulled back and said goodbye to Happy as left.
“I’m sorry all that happened, Buck.  I didn’t know.”
“I don’t care about them.” groaned Marco, “They labeled me the black sheep for being queer a long time ago.”
“Are you going to mention Madison or Marco to them?”
Tony ordered them pasta from room service and they ate in bed on a meal tray while watching an HBO drama series.  They wanted to avoid commercials and the chance of running into stories about them.  After their meal was finished, Steve sat up against the headboard with Tony cuddled up on his left side.
Natasha straightened her posture when she saw the two men approach them.
"How's work?"
They smiled at each other softly as a piano player in the center of the dining room began to play a soft jazz song.
“Why not?  Sometimes people are just jealous, it doesn't have to be something you did.  Someone had to have deliberately reported this so you would look bad.  How else would you guys have flown under the radar for 2 years?”
“I mean...I was trying not to think about it too much.”
Tony’s favorite Pixies album played on their little speaker in the kitchen.  This used to be their ritual for mornings of days when Tony was about to do something that made him nervous like a meeting or presentation.  Since they’d barely spoken, it was surprising to Tony that Steve had even remembered about the meeting at all.
Abruptly, Tony’s head shot up to give him a dirty glare.  “So, you’re trying to tell ME what I should do right now?”
That was it.  They would talk about it.  He’d have to tell Tony that he was going over there too.  With a sigh, he took off the rest of his clothes and stepped under the hot water.  Steve closed his eyes and just breathed, letting the tension roll out of his shoulders.  The stiffness was from being hunched over the kids' short art tables all day.
“It’s gonna be alright.”
“What is it?” asked Steve, concerned.
“I just...I feel like you’re mad at me or something.” shrugged Bucky.
Tony cleared his throat to say “Yes, I do.  I think it’s reasonable that you not hang out with Bucky for a while and keep this distance between you.  Ultimately, you had to go to therapy and had chest pains.  This situation has obviously been ripping you apart.  Even though that could have been avoided, it happened...and you have been different lately, probably from organizing your thoughts, right?  The longer you waited, the more it seems to have worn you down.”
Knowing Bucky had to leave for work in about 4 hours, Steve decided to help him out.  He changed out of his work clothes and quietly went out to grab the duffel bag full of clothes.
Tony glanced around the apartment approvingly, “This is a beautiful place you got here.”  He gently let go of her hand.
“You’ve already asked me that tonight.  He’s fine, showing signs of socializing more and it seems to be good for him.  He’s even been talking to his family more.”
When Steve noticed, he grumbled “You ordered me a car?”
Bucky felt safe for the first time in a long time.
Tony shifted so the slight pain in his arm wasn’t so bad, “No you aren’t.”
Bucky snubbed his smoke.
Tony tossed the towel on the counter and looked up at his boyfriend a little irritated, “No, I think I’ve been very supportive.  Even though you spend every spare moment with him so he doesn’t have to be alone.”
Steve glanced down at where his spit landed then back at him, “I lost my job there now.  Why does any of this still matter?”
The two men arrived at the nightclub and there was a small line out the front door.  They walked up confidently to the bouncer and he surprisingly ushered them closer to put paper bracelets on their wrists and take their cash for the door cover.
The penthouse was now a crime scene for the next couple days, so they would have to get a hotel room until all evidence was collected.  That included Steve’s knife, which he would never get back.
Bucky scoffed and shook his head, "That’s exactly why we SHOULD drift apart right now, because we love each other."
Thank you! Much love!
“I know…”
"Did you ever make a decision? About…" Rhodey gestured toward where Steve was.
“Listen, Frank, you haven’t done anything wrong yet.” tried Tony, “The only thing you have done is scare an entitled rich man.  Judging from our conversation we had at the party, you’re a smart guy.  I would be willing to forget all about this and erase my camera footage if you want to just leave right now.”
Steve mumbled, “That’s what you used to say.”
“No.  The whole thing’s just strange, unexpected.  That’s what Bucky and I talked about.” shrugged Steve.  Tony’s eyes continued to scan over his man’s face, “Were you upset?”
Steve’s lips curled into a half smile, “Okay okay...I’ll run up and grab my work clothes.”
“Look, the DA seems to be making an example of him.” said Tony, pointing at the TV, “They are already talking about pushing for better background checks in the military.”
Bucky continued to cry.  Steve pulled him back against his chest, rubbing his back in circles.  “It’s going to be okay,” said Steve.  “It’s fine, Buck.  I’m sorry too.”
Tony was crying and groaning in pain.  “Tony!” Steve cried, getting to his feet as fast as he could.  “Help me.” groaned Tony.
The next morning was Saturday, meaning it was Steve’s day off.  He still woke up at 6 and took Bucky with him to the football field to jog.
“You too, man.” agreed Sam.
Immediately, Tony screamed in pain, getting their attention.  Steve looked up at him, panicking and seeing the blood start to form on Tony’s sleeve near his left bicep.  Keeping his eyes on his boyfriend, Steve retaliated and jumped Frank to put him in a chokehold.  They struggled violently until finally, Frank was unconscious.
“Yeah, she offered.  We have just been getting to know each other.  She’s been chatting with me through stuff with my dad.”
“A little.” Tony answered, still not looking at him.
When there was no movement, Steve shuffled into the living room and got comfy on the sofa.  He stared at the ceiling, sniffling to himself and overanalyzing their fight.
Steve shrugged, “I mean...not really.  He asked me to move in instead.”
“You know I care about you.  We’ve been friends forever, that’s not for no reason.”  typed Bucky, “I know I shouldn’t have confessed my feelings when I did.  I know I should have said something a long time ago.  However, you can’t put me somewhere I don’t belong.”  He hated the feeling of tears stinging his eyes.
The mechanic engineer had a 3 story apartment with 5 bedrooms and 2.5 baths, the top floor was open and also Tony’s home lab/gym.
“Sounds great, honey.” he smiled, kissing his cheek down to his neck, “Who were you thinking about inviting?”
The older man was staring blankly ahead.  It was taking him a minute to absorb all the information he was given.  Mostly Tony started to feel the betrayal, and hurt but mostly stupid for not noticing anything before.
Tony wasn’t moving, he wasn’t talking, he just stared furiously at him.  His thoughts were too chaotic to put them into words.
Bucky had made the wise decision of putting a towel nearby for the amount of times they were grabbing at each other.
Steve didn’t press.
“Yeah?  How do you know if I’m actually happy and not just telling you I am?” teased Tony.
Bucky exhaled a puff of smoke, “Was she okay getting home?”
"What did he say to that?" Asked Steve.
He nodded and stared down at his lap.
Steve flinched, “It feels icky, like I should be doing it myself.”
“You a veteran too?”
He was sleeping on his stomach in his clothes from the night before.  Forcing his head off the pillow to look up, he saw Steve in a black tank top cooking and making coffee.
"We had a heart to heart.” He replied with a full mouth, “We talked about Mom and Pakistan and how he really was scared to lose his family. Dad decided he'd been too hard on me. He even apologized."
A sigh erupted from Bucky as he put down his coffee and ran a hand through his hair, “Yeah, you did...for only like a minute.”
Nat sighed,“You're ready to go?”
“Yeah, why wouldn’t I be?” asked Bucky as if that was a stupid question.  He slipped on a shirt of his with the name of a metal band across it.
“Sorry, I’ve never been around openly gay Steve before.”
“Oh yeah?  Like what?”
And they lived happily ever after!
“Yeah, but he couldn’t possibly afford all the bills at that place.” said Tony, “So I guess, I’ll have to just take over the lease and let him pay utilities.”
With a chuckle, the brunette man finished off his burger. "I came out as bisexual to him when I went home after the war."  He spoke so casually as if that wasn’t a big deal.
Steve’s face dropped.  “It’s not that I’m jealous of how you spend your time, Buck.  I’m not trying to tell you who to hang out with.  I just feel like the timing here is...odd.  Or, I’m being selfish.”
Bucky sat up as straight as he could on the blow up mattress, “You have my attention.”
“What’s wrong with him?  He’s hot.  He’s a Daddy for sure.”
“I thought you were interested in your guy friend, honestly.” Okoye said to Bucky.
“I don’t even know what time I will wake up, let alone when I’ll leave.  I’ll probably drive through the night.  It’s what I’m good at.”
“Bits and pieces.  After the third round, things got hazy.” laughed Steve,  taking two coffee mugs out of the cabinet.  “I could feel worse, but my hangover is definitely there.  It serves me right by mixing beer and liquor.”
“You've been too busy with me, you mean?”
Bucky’s eyes wandered to the window to watch the beginning of a snow flurry falling outside.  The sound of Tony’s throat clearing regained his attention.  “So,” he boasted, “how do we do this?”
He nodded, “You remember Tony.”
The words brought warmth to Steve's chest.  "I'll always be here, Buck."
‐-‐---
Biting his lip in thought for a minute, Bucky said, “Okay, but for real though I will pay for the two flat screens.”
Steve kept up appearances through the evening, but as soon as his friends were gone he locked himself in the master bath to cry.  He stared at his phone, at pictures of him and Bucky, at their past text messages.
“Is he scared of commitment or just doesn’t believe in it?”
“She GOT me HIT but didn’t hit me directly.  I said I was too tired to talk about this.”
Biting his lip a little, Bucky asked “Are you sure?”
Steve chuckled a little, “You already want to get furniture together?  Tony, there is nothing wrong with your bed.”
“Yep.” said Tony as he sat with his boyfriend to his right on the couch.
“Morning.” Steve nodded, putting down the bag of bagels and two coffees on the area table.  He offered Bucky’s black coffee to him wordlessly and sat down.  When Bucky grabbed it, he opened the top to blow on the hot liquid.
