I had slept in a room with Scott. Well 'slept'. I sat down at the massive table and put my head down in my arms.
I grunted as Steve's tongue flicked up and down in my ass, "Fuck! Cap if you keep that up I'm going to cum". With that, his tongue was gone and a moist finger was pressed against my entrance. He stood up and rested his chin on my shoulder "just say the word and I'll stop..." there was a small silence before his finger pushed through my ring. He breathed hot air on my ear as he moaned. It didn't take long for him to add a second, and unlike last night he spread his fingers open inside me. I whimper as my hole stretched but it needed to be done.
She took Steve's hand and led him to a room. Now it was just us and Peggy. She pulled a gun and clicked the barrel "Do you love me Steve?" he placed both his hands on her arms "Of course I do Peggy!" A tear rolled down from her brown eyes to her red lips, she placed a gun in his hand "You have to choose then, you have to chose who you love it's me or Anthony".
Tony returns to Wakanda after the snap to meet up with the rest of his team, even Captian Steve Rogers.
"The beatings were usually every night, started when I was ten, I spilled orange juice over some important business files, and by the time I reached fourteen they didn't bother me anymore, so he stepped it up". He told me about his teenage years, both sides, the side people seen, the partying, drinking, getting high, taking tests hungover and acing them, and the side no one seen, the lonely nights in a massive house, the being kicked out on the street, the fear of going home, even his suicide attempt.
Wanda came in with some clothes, I stood up and took them off her. "Seriously Wanda, I told you there is no need for you to do all this". I put the pile onto my bed, she smiled "I like helping out around here" I smiled back at her and turned my eyes back to the pages "If that's the case, could you fix me up a coffee?" "Of course". She went over to the coffee machine and pressed the buttons.
I watched, sweating and starting to think this was all a dream, as Tony hoped back onto the bed and spread his legs out "C'mon Cap I'm tired of waiting, I'm not going to fuck myself, well not tonight" I moved in between his legs, looking him over, I could see the desire in his eyes but my thoughts got the best of me. I ran my hands up his legs and stopped them at his tighs. I looked at how beautiful he was like this but that stupid fear got to me and I froze.
Thor couldn't just stand back and watch his people get slaughtered, it was his worst nightmare. We began fighting with the army, I threw my shield to protect Thor and he gave me a smile, it faded quickly when we heard a load shot, his father fell to the ground "No!".
I started to clean up some of my wounds but I got frustrated and gave up. I lay down on the seats "What have I gotten us into". I glanced over to the corner of the ship where all the pods were "Friday open door 001 please". The panels opened and I sat up to look at the shield, I picked up the outdated phone "Please be here".
Shots went all over the place, I could barely see what I was doing. Laura's screams stooped, I looked up, she was dead. Clint started crying, but he still couldn't move.
"Just making sure Tony was awake", Tony discarded him "Kid, it's a wedding, wear a suit" he laughed "Well I knew that! But do I wear it tonight or tomorrow?" Tony rolled his eyes, but I knew he was only acting like he was annoyed, he really loved helping Peter "You wear one suit tonight, without a tie or waistcoat, then tomorrow you wear a three-piece suit, with a tie" "I thought as much, but you see, I only own the one suit, unless you count the spiderman suit, but I don't think Ms Potts would like that-" "There are like at least ten suits in your wardrobe".
I ran towards the lift and he didn't try and stop me, he didn't even move. The lift doors closed but I attached one of my handy little gadgets to stop it from moving. I sat down on the ground and hit my hand to my head. The sun was setting by the time I stopped crying and got myself together. When I stepped out of the lift Okoye was in the hallway "Mr Stark, you are needed in the meeting room to discuss tomorrow's mission" "Thank you".
Pepper and Rhodey got engaged, they're as happy as ever, and I'm happy for them, but I didn't see them. I sponsored my news feeds, so I never read storys about them, even though I was happy, I had very mixed emotions towards them.
The whole flight home we talked, about nothing in particular, but it made me feel human again. The jet landed at our compound and we lined up to get off. Waiting for us was General Ross and a whole load of other people, and cameras. I was the first one to get off, when I stepped onto the ground Pepper wrapped her arms around me and whispered "I'm sorry...we need to talk, please just go along with this".
I woke up still in Steve's arms, but he was awake and staring at me "So how long have you been watching me sleep?" He glanced over at the clock "About twenty minutes". "That's pretty creepy Steve" he smiled again, those my eyes went straight to his perfect teeth and lips, "How long did you watch me sleep Stark?" "I guess you have a point.
I still smirked "You won, you get Steve" "I know, but you lose, because you never had him". Something evil came across her face "Are you ready for the whole world to know your gay Tony?". I had prepared for this "Not yet, and they're not going to find out because if they do, thanks to Pepper and Natasha, I have all the proof I need that you have been manipulating innocent Captian America". She stopped off down the hall and out the fire exit.
Steve asked "Nat, what is this?" Her expression didn't change "Let's just get the stone". The creppy woman pulled a gun and placed it against Natasha's short brown hair. "We're just going to have to strike fast" Clint suggested. Bruce mumbled "Someone has to die" "What did you say Dr Banner?" Steve was puzzled.
Tony moved his hand into a T "timeout Steve". I stopped moving and slowly pulled out, he whimpered "Are you okay Doll?". He nodded but he was out of breath and sweat was dripping off him. "Yeah I'm okay, just give me one minute".
I was dressed but didn't move off the bed, Tony was putting on his jacket and still trying to defend himself "I told you I didn't want to take your virginity, I warned you". There was a knock on the door.
Tony wiggled in my grip, and spat at Rhodes, he got a reaction, Rhodey swung a punch at him and got him in the nose. Clint and Banner grabbed him to restrain him while Thor stood between the two of them. "He has been screwing my Fiance for two years!". I let my guard down and Tony got out of my arms and launched at Rhodey. They were attacking each other on the floor and no of us could separate them.
I had to drag myself out of bed, I blinked for a second but never opened my eyes, I almost tumbled down the stairs. Breakfast was being made for us, as there was a chance that it would be our last breakfast ever.
Steve began to treat me differntly, he was being nice and caring, but I didn't like it. He let me take a shower first, then went for one himself. I made myself a cup of coffee and sat down on the bed. I pulled up a screen for myself to work on. I started doing some research into the magic Wong had told us about, the one that would link us all together.
"Could I have some privacy with the Captian". Tony. He sounded broken, hurt and defeated but it was so good to hear his voice. I couldn't turn around, I stood up straight but I was paralysed looking out the window with a grip on my belt. I could hear everyone shuffling out the door.. I couldn't believe he was alive, here, now it was just me and him.
I went up to my room and rooted through the drawers until finally I found it. I only owned one blue suit, but thankfully it would match Steve's. I spend a little bit too much time fixing myself up before going downstairs, Clint's kids were relaxing in the common area with the babysitter, my whistling got their attention, I threw a credit card at them "Go order whatever yous want". "Thank you Mr Stark!". I hoped into the Audi R8, Steve's favourite and drove down the road.
Steve's sketch pad cought my attension, it was on the locker on the other side of the bed. I could hear him humming in the bathroom. I streched over and took a look at it, couple of boring building, trees and birds. I was closing it over when a sheet fell onto my lap, it was of me. It melted my heart how much he paid attension to detail.
I laid eyes on her. Peggy Carter. She was young though. Steve ran over and wrapped his arms around her. I looked away with a weird feeling growing in my stomach.
"So tell me Tony, what did Sharon have on you?". I threw my head back in a moan "Sh-she's my half sister- fuck - she wanted to take control of -oh god- half everything Howard left me in his will". I came in his fist and with a grunt "But after I did some real research turned out she was Maria's daughter, so she wasn't entitled to what Howard left me". Natsha knocked on the door "That's seven minutes!"I stood up and kissed Steve, I mumbled "So maybe we can be more than just friend, he grabbed my ass and squeezed as I opened the door "I was counting on it".
"He's gone, Tony". Tony's face was always kind of clenched, I noticed it very early on in our friendship, I think it's because he always has some sharp snarky remark to make but once I said that the tension in his face was gone. I sat down on the floor, he swung his legs off the sofa and rested a hand on my shoulder "I'm really sorry Cap, but you know we're going to get them back, all of them, Peter, Strange, Sam, Wanda, T'Challa, that little tree guy Thor was telling me about, and Bucky". I stood up, wiping his blood off my hands and into his shirt.
"Tony, are you in there?". Bruce. Tony opened the door with a smile "Hey Brucy boy, what's going on?". He was as awkward as ever, rubbing his hand through his hair "We're all waiting upstairs for you and Cap". I started to panic but Tony spit out a lie as if his life depended on it "Sorry, Cap slept on the floor, the old man's back was killing him so he was hogging the shower". I waved "Morning Doctor Banner" "Good morning Captian Rogers, just come on up to the meeting room whenever you two are ready". Tony looked back at me for a second, it was obvious he was thinking but he quickly looked away "Hold up Bruce, I'll come up with you now, give Cap some privacy to clean up, maybe even shave".
I couldn't think of anything else I just needed to get back to earth. Once I did, with the help of Nebula, I got straight into a ship and made a flight plan to bring me to Bruce. He was in Wakanda.
My erection wasn't noticeable anymore so I joined them and sat on the sofa next to Steve. "Why are you guys walking around half naked at two in the morning?". I smirked, knowing full well Peter had no idea what was going on "Kid do you ever read any news?" He shook his head innocently "Why?". I looked at Steve who had a smile and back to Peter "Oh nothing, and we were just going for a swim".
I whispered dirty thoughts into his ear, and when I pulled away his whole face was pink "T-tony..." I rolled my hips "Yes Captian" "you are so damn hot". He placed his lips over mine and began to pull off my t-shirt, then his. We had a little roll so I landed on my back and he hovered on top of me kissing my face and neck. At some stage I lost my pants and it was just me and him. He looked into my eyes "Tony you are so beautiful, and smart and...I love you". He went back to kissing my chest.
Steve yelled from the bathroom "Hey Tony, I think your shower is broken, you might want to come and hop in with me" he opened the door with a towel wrapped around his waist, but he couldn't see Wanda, I tried to get him to stop but he didn't pick up on my signal "Come on Doll, are you really going to turn down a shower with me?".
Half the universe, gone, just one snap, that's all it took to take us down. I was left sitting in the dust of my best friend, Bucky, for I don't know how long. No one wanted to disturb me, I had just gotten him back, I gave up everything to keep him, and now he was gone again.
Sharon was gone quite a long time, I was washing my hands in the bathroom when she came in and locked the door behind her. "Steve we really need to talk" I smiled as I dried my hands "Yeah we do" "I'm so worried about Tony, I have something to tell you". I couldn't have listened more intently if I tried "I went to talk to him about something really important, and I accidentally walked in on him and Pepper...you know". This isn't right, they couldn't have been doing anything, he wouldn't.
Scott's eyes shot up from his coffe cup "You can mute the room!". I was still hung up "Hold on, if it wasn't you two then who was it?". Two sets of foot steps echoed and over came Tony and Steve, sitting down together. Natasha's eyes opened wide with shock but I didn't understand, I raised an eyebrow.
"Man, is that Natasha texting you, your phone was going mad". I looked curiously at the phone because really I still wasn't fully caught up to date, I mean I knew the basics. I picked it up and pressed the on button.
Natasha snapped "I hate that bitch" I laughed "You're the one that set them up!" She mumbled, "Yeah I guess I did". She cleared off the food "what are you going to do about it?" "Nothing, she won". "And you checked her DNA?".
Sam sat next to me with two plates of pancakes, I stared at them, and then at him "Oh I'm sorry did you want some of these?". I grumbled and stood up, opened the fridge and took out a little carton of juice, when I sat back down one of the plates of pancakes was in my place "Thank you Sam".
Clint ruined the silence "I still can't believe you two fucked". I walked away, but I heard Tony "Three times actually" and then he walked out of the freezer and joined me by the wall.
Later that night I was watching a football game with Sam. Tony came over and looked at the screen before just walking away. I watched him look at the shelf "Do you need help Tony?" He didn't turn around "No it's okay". He stretched up trying to reach something. I looked at Sam and shrugged, we both turned to see how he was doing.
Clint and Natasha were making jokes about Tony's teenage form while I looked around the room. We all stood against the wall until the door swung open. Howard Stark stormed in.
Natasha and Bruce weren't talking to each other, but not officially broken up, at the party her and Bucky spent seven minutes in the clostet and it made Bruce crazy.
Happy sped off down the road, I took out my phone and tried to call Steve, no answer, next I tried Natasha, she didn't pick up, I hit redial "oh hey Ton-" "Please tell me you haven't let yet!" She sighed "Oh Tony Sweetie I'm sorry, we're already outside Philadelphia". I took the phone away from my face and sighed "Okay I'll see you guys tomorrow".
Steve shouted "I can a quick announcement, I didn't intend to do it this way, but I'm all about being honest. Truthfully, YES I am Captian America, but I am also Steven Rogers, and I'm gay". There was small moment of gasps and people taking out their phones "When I went into the ice being gay was extremely dangerous, but when I woke up, a lot had changed, something for the better, like the fact that being gay was accepted by most." He turned to the man "But it's men like you who are holding us back". The man got closer to Steve's face "That was really touching, for a fagg-" Steve punch him.
I almost laughed at the idea "No" "was it one of those warriors?" "No pepper it wasn't!" "I can't believe you would do this to me, Tony, after everything, does our engagement mean anything to you?" I stood up and planted my fist on the table "of course it does Pepper". She aggressively moved her chair back from the table and stood up "Bullshit, your a worthless, lying, cheating pig!". I snapped "Don't you dare talk to me about cheating!" "And what is that suppose to mean?" She looked shocked.
"Why the hell did yous need so many rooms?" Natasha asked rhetorically. Steve walked closely to Tony while I hung a little behind with Natasha. Tony stopped outside a room door and took a deep breath.
I was smiling, but it didn't feel real "Congratulations, how is it going?" he withdrew into himself a little "She's running the business like usual, travelling all over the place so, that's good for her". Was it possible Tony Stark was unhappy being engaged to Pepper, no way, everyone knew they were a perfect couple?. Blood started to come down his chest again, I pressed my hand against his toned body. I could feel his stare close to my face and when I looked up to give him a smile his lips touched mine.
He dropped the gun "No, I'm not doing that!". Clint butted in "Steve if we don't get this stone Thor and Bruce die, right now". I picked the gun up off the floor and placed it in his hand "it's okay Steve, just shoot me, it's not real, I'll be waiting when yous get the last stone".
He looked down at his lap again, but not with a smile, he mumbled "I don't know how to". I took his hand and pulled him up, but if he wanted to sit back down he could have "I'll teach you". I had taken Steve's hand in mine and had my other one resting on his shoulder. His other hand restated on my waist, touching the small of my back.
I get on my private jet and sit down staring blankly out the window, it's just me on the whole jet, I twiddle my fingers and regret not bringing Happy with me. The plane takes off and once we're stabilised I stand up and pace up and down, I try to focus on the business material but my mind keeps bringing up Steve.
"Hey Steve?", I mumbled "Yeah Tony" he sighed "You don't sound like your from Brooklyn", I laughed "How so?" "I don't know I just pictured everyone from Brooklyn talking...well like Brooklyn people are meant to talk". I laughed again "oh I'm sorry Doll". He shivered a little and lifted his head off my chest, he caught his lip between his teeth and started to unbutton my shirt.
He went back to my tights, getting me worked up, then thankfully he shoved three fingers into my mouth, I covered them in my spit as fast as I could, he blew on my hole, causing shivers to run through my body, he let a pleased sigh out and pressed two fingers past my rim "Ahhhh Steve!" I pulled up a little, away from his fingers but he moved them back up "Fuck" I couldn't process anything anymore, just the plessure of him working me open.
He readjusted so he was supported by his elbows and his seven-inch rock hard dick was up against his stomach. I leaned in to kiss his neck, travelling slowly to his stomach them stopping to pull off my own boxers "So that serum really did work everywhere" I blushed "God Rogers you're gorgeous". He slid off the edge of the bed and onto his knees. I looked up at the ceiling "Steve look at me, talk to me". I glanced down at him. The way his eyes looked up at me melted my heart, then he grabbed my dick and put it in his mouth. I moaned loudly as he took the whole nine inches into his mouth. I pressed my arm against the wall, almost punching it as Tony's head bobbed up and down, his spit coating my shaft. I could feel his tongue swirl around me and then a pop.
A short time later I was under Steve's arm trying to open the room door. He laughed "If we're in the honeymoon suite, where are Rhodey and Pepper sleeping tomorrow?" I smirked, "well the hotel offered me the best room in the hotel, the presidential suite, but I thought they should have the best for their wedding night, so I asked they set up the presidential suite as if the president was here for his honeymoon". The door opened and straight away I started to push down his jacket and pull off his tie. We twirled and struggled with each other until I shoved him onto the bed. He was looking up at me with a stupid grin. I climbed onto his lap as he propped himself up with his elbows "Tony-" "shhh don't talk Rogers" I kissed him slowly and started to unbutton his shirt.
We got inside and I sat down on the coach "Cap, stay there, I'll be back in a few minutes, just don't go anywhere". I watched him get into the lift, wearing a smug smirk.
I remembered reading about his mother death, she fell off the balcony, it was never found to be murder, suicide or accidental it was just a death. Bruce couldn't let it happen. When his mothers body went over the railing he ran out and began fighting his step dad. "Steve what's going on?" Tony shouted from the door. I glanced at away and back to the fight.
The fire was lit, there were fairy lights everywhere hanging down from the ceiling, two glasses of champagne and chocolate dipped strawberries on the table. I smiled, Steve appeared from behind the wall, in just a pair of loose boxers, "I'm sorry that I pushed you into coming out that wasn't fair" he came closer to me and placed his hand on my cheek, I whispered, "I'm sorry I didn't come out earlier".
Wanda was wearing a red strapless beaded dress, the heavy material stopped at the top of her tight, but it was lace from her waist to the floor. Vision, in his human skin, had his arms around her waist, he was wearing a black suit and red tie.
He had a big smile across his face "Mr Stark it is fantastic to see you're recovering so well, we have set you up with a jet, so whenver you're ready you can all go home". Steve got up and walked out with T'challa, thanking him on behalf of the team. My eyes lingered as they exited. Natasha giggled "What are we going to do about you two back in New York?". It was an innocent joke that sent me into a spiral of thoughts.
Michelle was next in the circle, I breathed a sigh of relief when she picked out a little fake spider. Peter's face turned totally pink, and his hands were shaking as he closed over the door. We just sat around talking, not about anything in particular, my wrist buzzed and I got up to get Peter.
I was suited up, with new gear thanks to Stark, and ready to take on whatever was coming. The team of six were motionless, we had no idea what was happening, if they were winning or losing or even dying.
Steve's whole face was now red "We're not doing it!" I couldn't help myself "Yeah, what was I thinking, Steve's a precious little virgin" I set my trap, Tony mumbled "Well he was when he met me". Steve turned around to him "Tony!" "Sorry, sorry".
I didn't take notice after that, I assume the rest of the team were appreciated but I couldn't wait, I whispered to Pepper "What the hell is going on?". She clapped and smiled, mumbling to me "Sharon knows about you and Steve" my chest went tight "How do you even know about me and Steve!".
The group of men laughed for a pretty long time. He strolled over with it "Got anything you want to say to me, Steve?" I laughed "Yeah I do actually" he looked almost scared "You have a stain on your tie". He playfully hit me with the flower and grabbed a couple of drinks from the bar.
We had finally come up with a plan, but it was going to take a lot. As Thor explained, with the help of Wong, we needed to retrieve the stones and destroy them. Surprisingly enough destroying them was going to be the easy part with Shuri's latest developments but retrieving them, that was complicated.
We strolled through the first trail, it was calm, the only sound was the birds and our footsteps on the concrete path. Steve stopped once we got to a beautiful clearing, there was an arch of flowers he mumbled: "they do weddings out here sometimes". I strolled underneath the arch and looked up at the sky.
His smile was comforting "Well I'm waiting?" Of course he would say that "Tony, I would very much like it if you would go on a date with me sometime?". He rolled back into the cuddle "Of course I will, now go to sleep before your dick realises how close my ass is to you, I wouldn't want you to break a hip during round two". I had a smug smile and kissed his ear "You underestimate that serum, I'm already ready for round two". "Oh god, you're going to kill me aren't you". He kissed the scar on the back of my neck "Goodnight Tony" he whispered.
I opened the door and smiled "What's wrong kid?". He looked kind of frightened, probably because I sounded mad "Oh, Mr Stark, did I wake you, I'm so sorry if I did" "You didn't" "oh okay, I was wondering if I could maybe, I don't know, crash here for the night? And I know everyone else is gone to Washington tonight, so I really just didn't want you to be alone, and, and- please?". "Come on in kid".
Tony led me to a small room used for keeping coats. I pinned him against the wall and wasted no time in unbuckling his belt, I slipped his trousers down and ran my hands under his chest, stopping to twist his nipple. Tony moaned "C'mon Steve, don't leave any time for interruptions". He removed my belt and tourers and dipped his hand into my boxers. I looked up at the ceiling and let out a groan as he worked on me with his hand, while he sucked my neck. I was shocked when he took out a pocket-sized bottle of lube, I laughed "you're always prepared aren't you?". He squirted lube over my erection and turned around, bracing himself against the wall with his two hands. I took his two cheeks in my hands and spread them open, lining my hard up with his little hole. I pushed in, Tony buckled over "Holy fuck" I bent over and wrapped my arms around him, trying to relax him "You're so tight". I hadn't moved yet, he was still breathing heavily. I had to exhale sharply, I kissed his ear and whispered "I love you Tony Stark, I'm going to marry you someday" he smiled with all his teeth "I'll say yes when you ask". I stood up straight "okay you can mo-".
I got up to kiss him but he moved away "We need to talk about this, Steve, last night, it was..." I smiled as wide as I could "It was fantastic Tony!" I couldn't put into words how it made made me feel but his face was stern "It was a teenage fantasy and I was drunk, it didn't mean anything". My heart shattered "I'm sorry what? It didn't mean anything?". He smirked like I was being overdramatic "C'mon Steve, I'm engaged to Pepper, and your straight" I rolled my eyes at him "That didn't bother you last night".
He pulled the pillow off the bed and placed it on the sofa. Before he lay down I scoffed "Oh come on Cap, I'm not going to make a man as old as yourself sleep on the caoch". He sat up and looked at me "It's okay Tony, it's still comfier than those army bed!" "Shut up and get your perfect ass over here!".
They had collected the space, power and reality stone, then Dr Banner fell out of the circle. I panicked as no stone apperaed. Rocket clutched my leg "They are all going to die!". The soul stone appeared and joined the collection. Rocket let go of my leg and took a big step away, trying to clear the awkwardness.
Hours passed, Tony talked to me more that night than he ever had, and then asked me a question "What about you Cap, what were your rebellious teenage years like in the 30s?" I smiled at him, as if it would make it less sad "Well Tony, there's not alot I can say, my dad died before I was born, my mom died by the time I was sixteen, spent most my time working in a bar".
I reached down to touch myself only for my hand to be slapped away. After the third time that happened, he huffed, and pinned my wrists above my head with one of his hands "That's what you get for disobeying orders Stark". I tried to pull them away a little "You are such a tease, just fuck me" he laughed "What's the magic word Tony" "please Steve, I need you, I need all of you". He shuttered and finally placed his hand on my cock, slowly stroking me.
"Before we start Mr Strak has a special announcement!" I stood up and took the mix "Thank you. As many of you and your readers have been wondering about myself and Pepper's engagement I would like to share the following news on behalf of the two of us. Myself and Pepper have discussed this at length and we've decided that the best thing to do is just be honest, Ms Potts and I are no longer together-" cameras flashed, reports shouted and gasped, I waited and then continued "I'll keep it to the point, we've been lying to ourselves for a really long time, but neither of us could go through with this, she has happily found love, something I could never give her, I have too much respect  for Ms Potts. We will not be taking questions at this time."
The same could not be said about his position as CEO, he went back and forward for six whole months and had not reached any sort of decision. Not even the night before he was leaving.
Natasha's body landed next to me and I looked deep into Steve's eyes as we heard Laura's scarems "Clint please help me!" Clint didn't move, "Guys I literally can't move!". This was his worse nightmare, not being able to protect his family.
The lift started moving upwards "What the hell Tony?". He ran his hand up my shoulder and up to my neck, "May I?" He started to loosen my tie and when he got it off he wrapped it around my eye. I lift stopped and opened. "Just trust me for a second Steve". His hand grazed over my wrist and then it tightened around my hand.
"Sharon you can tell everyone that I'm gay, I don't care, I want to be with him". She giggled "I knew you would, that's not why I came to talk to you, I just needed something to keep you and Pepper together for now". She went over to my desk and started messed up my papers "Then tell me what you have on me". She smiled "Oh not on you Tony, on Howard", she took a seat and crossed her legs "You see, before Peggy died, she told me to look into my family history, and that's what I did, so I spit into one of those tube things and sent it off..." I knew where this was going, I looked away "you're my half-brother, Tony".
I sat down on the sofa and looked at the DVD 'might as well just watch it until Tony gets back'. I turned on the TV and pressed play to see what Buck and Sam were talking about.
Clearly the coffee had heen there a lot longer than I thought. I spit it back out into the mug. Steve corrected me "Hey! Don't spit! If it's in your mouth just swallow it!". He realised what he had said once he noticed my smirk "stop being so flirtatious Steve!".
I got back to the room about three hours later. The light was still on, I opened the door and seen Steve on the sofa. I was a little tipsy and my shirt was still hanging open, I stood behind him and ran my hand around Steve's neck and down to his abs and down to his trousers.
I backed out of the room and text him again 'you have like 100 bathrooms in the place'. I saw Sharon talking to Pepper by the bar, I avoided them and grabbed Sam. "Hey, buddy what's going on?" "Buddy? Really I thought my buddy would tell me he has a girlfriend, man when did it even happen?". My phone buzzed 'The one beside the kitchen'. I laughed "Trust me, Sam, if I had a girlfriend I would tell you" I winked and left him standing with a puzzled look.
It only took him a second to cross the room and crouch down next to me, he can take much bigger steps than me. I wasn't too phased by the bleeding but he was. He just let his hands hover over my abdomen, I smirked and took off my t-shirt. He took the bottle from my hand and poured some of it onto my balled up t-shirt before pressing it to the cut "Outch" he smimed "Sorry, I probably should have told you that it would sting" "Well you probably should have told me a lot of things...".
Bruce mumbled "The stone is going to be in my room..." he pointed "that one, it will be in something sciency okay?" Tony pulled him back by his shoulder "And what are you going to do Bruce?". I shoved the team into the small room and let Bruce and Tony talk.
"Tony I grew up when this was literally illegal! But I still came out and I've never felt happier" he turned on his heels sharply "it's not about coming out". The pain in my heart struck me, I headed for the door "Steve" "it's fine Tony, you're ashamed of me" "Friday close the door" the door swung shut "I'm not ashamed of you, I want to protect you!".
He slipped down my body, breathing on my sensitive nipple, he got in between my legs but still neglected my painful erection, he nipped my inner tighs with his teeth, causing me to shake my hands against the headboard "Fucking hell Steve stop teasing!" He kissed my lips again "what was that Tony?" I whined "I'm sorry Cap, please, just, please..." "that's what I thought". Smug son of a bitch.
It was awkward for a while after that but eventually, we got a conversation going. The four-hour drive flew by and before we knew it we were pulling up at the venue. It was a massive farmhouse, looked very luxurious, not to mention romantic.
We went to the front desk to check in "Mr Stark, Ms Potts asked to see you when you arrived". Tony shifted a little "Anything to keep the bride happy". He kissed me on the cheek "I'll catch up with you later, and keep an eye on them". I turned around and the two teenagers were gone.
They listened to me and went towards the kitchen, but of course, Tony didn't "Steve about what I said-" "I'm sorry that I made you say that" he looked down at his lap with a little smile "You didn't make me, and I don't regret telling you". Natasha came in "Are you boys done making googly eyes at each other, we're heading to bed".
"Why did you do that?" I muttured, still really close to his face "Because it's incredibly difficult for me to be around you without kissing you" I closed my eyes and took a breathe "Rogers, if I don't make it back tomorrow..." "Stop it Stark, nothing is going to happen to you, I'll make sure of it". I climbed onto his lap, he sat up and held me around the waist, while I wrapped my arms around his neck "If this is my last night, I want to spend it having fun" he smiled up at me "And what do you want to do with me" "I want to..."
There was a bit of aggression in his voice "Stark we all know about that list of women's names, but I'm willing to bet there is another one, just as long, full of men's names". He started to piss me off a little bit "Rogers if your going to integrate me every time we have sex, well, your dick is good, but not worth that". I went back over to the bar for a drink, but he followed me.
His face was buried in my neck, he was bitting me, causing screams "Keep it quiet Stark, or I'll make you". I nodded, the whole team were a lot of floors below us, but I could scream pretty loudly. He ripped, literally tore, my shirt off me. My wrists were free from his hand but he snapped at me "Keep them there" "Yes Sir". He got down on his knees and looked at my abdomen, he started to run his tongue down to my bellybutton "Mmm fuck", he squeezed my ass, hard, "language!" I smirked down at him.
I went up with Natasha to see everyone, literally everyone, the team got a lot bigger, so a few more of them took up residence in the compound. Clint even brought the kids to stay for a while. Natasha went to Bruce's side, he slipped his hand around her waist and she softly placed her hand and his chest. He was in a navy suit, white shirt and navy tie, perfectly matched to Natasha's dress.
Out of no where he jumped onto my front and attacked my lips, as soon as he kissed me I couldn't control myself, I melted into it, wrapped my arms around him and we stumbled over to the bed.
When I woke up Tony wasn't there, as he promised. I sighed, and began to  wonder was it even real. Then the door of the bathroom opened, a steam cloud floated out and I could just about make out Tony's body. He had a towel tucked around his waist and was drying his hair with another towel. He mumbled "Morning Cap". I sat up to take in the view and smiled "You should have woken me up I would have hopped in the shower with you".
I had been held up in my workshop for a while when Steve came down on late night number three "Tony why are you still down here?" I pretended not to hear him over my load music, hoping he would just leave me be.
"So I was sorting out some business documents on his desk that shield needed and I saw plans". She started to cry, my immediate response was to hug her "Steve he is turning Stark industries back into a weapons manufacturer, he has awful plans! When I asked him about it he was heartless and cold, like he wants innocent people to die for profit". That's not Tony anymore.
Tony was on my bed, only in his boxers and a hard bulge popping out of them. I hadn't felt this breathless since my last asthma attack back in the 30s. I hooked my fingers into his boxer waistband and looked him in the eye. Those beautiful big brown eyes stared back at me and his sweet nod reassured me, he wanted this as much as I did. I pulled them off his ankles in one swift movement.
She only opened the door a little "Come on fellas, it's time for the fight of our life". Her smile was kind of sad but I smiled back. I took Tony's hand and we got into the lift. Natasha went off to round up everyone else. Just as the lift doors closed I grabbed him and kissed him.
After a minute I let go of her "Are you sure that's what it was?" She sniffled and nodded "I'll show you, come on". She lightly guided my hand and kept it tight behind her. As she pulled me up the stairs a camera flash went off, I'm sure that picture definitely looked like Sharon was my girlfriend. She creaked open the door of Tony's apartment. I felt guilty about this but I had to know if Sharon was telling the truth.
We got in and went to go pick of MJ, Tony pulled out a bunch of red roses "Give her these, tell her she looks beautiful and kiss her on the cheek". He began to sweat as he got out of the limo. Tony mumbled, "For the record, the flowers were originally for you". I smiled "I don't need flowers, Tony". "You look beautiful Steve", his lips gently touched off my cheek.
"I can't believe this Sam! Steve has a boyfriend!" He cocked his head "maybe not a boyfriend, maybe just a fun friend". Steve walked in, I turned off the phone and went back to eating my pancakes "Oh Bucky, I think we mixed up our phone, sorry about that!" "Oh did we? I didn't even notice, here you go". I handed him his phone and took mine off him.
I sat up on the stool at the bar next to Rhodey. He was nervous about something, I had known him for long enough to tell. He smiled "Look, Tony, I know things between us have been bad between us for the last while, but you are still my closest friend" "just spit it out Rhodey" "will you be my best man?". I shook my head a little in shock "No" he looked a little crushed "James I'm not going to be your best man, your brother is your best man, but I will be your groomsman". He smiled and patted my shoulder "Thanks man" "so bachelor party?".
I picked up my clothes, ready to make a run for it. "Don't leave Tony" "Steve the rest of the team can't know about this". I was still going to marry Pepper "Tony can you not just stay with me, please". That damn beard and those eyes. I crawled back onto the bed "Don't be surprised if I'm gone in the morning" "Well I'm honoured to be on Tony Stark's list" I sighed, it was a really really long list, too long. "Honour is all mine, I'm the man that took Captain America's virginity, that's a one night stand I'll remember".
"Well you see it all goes back to May 29th 1970, the day I was born" his laugh made me smile "Ah yes, the day you blessed the world with your birth" I dabbed his cut "yeah and fouty eight years later Thanos threw a moon at me, but that didn't do much, so he stabbed me" I didn't believe I had heard him right "I'm sorry...what!" "Yeah pretty crazy". We spent a few hours talking, it was getting really late, the city was silent and it was just me and a kind of tipsy Tony, but not drunk. He placed the empty bottle next to the chair and stretched out.
"We got the first stone after Thor watched Loki die, the second one after Sarah died, we need to see the person die before the stone is visible". Steve gulped "Natasha...do you...?". She just walked away.
"Don't worry Tasha we're going to bed now", Tony raised an eyebrow "We are?" "Yeah didn't you hear, we all needed to buddy up in rooms" "This is a freakin catsle, and they don't have enough room like eight people?". I rolled my eyes "More people from the villiage are staying here while they wait for Shuri to treat them, and come on it will be fun!".
Once the door was closed over I sighed "I know that what happened to all of us, it was hard, and I'm sorry if I've ever been insensitive to any of you, but I think we're stronger now, we know things about each other we probably never would have, but that's okay". Bruce laughed "Yeah like how Steve is in love with you!". Everyone laughed, even Steve, "Yeah, I'll have to have a conversation with him about that, it was probably just the magic of sleeping with me". We were having a laugh when T'challa joined us.
As soon as I landed in Wakanda the Kingsguard came to greet me. They brought me up to a packed meeting room. Thor was sitting talkint to a Racoon, I assume he was the missing member from Quill's team, Bruce was bugging Natasha, and Rhodes was lookinh down at his phone, but Steve wasn't there. Surrounded by all these people, and I had never felt so alone.
I didn't give him much of a choice, I dragged him to our room, not the same room we slept in last night. This one was bigger and nicer but I would have slept anywhere as long as I knew Tony was safe.
After a great speech by General Ross, there was drinks and food in the common area. Sharon wouldn't let go of my arm the whole time. Every time a journalist came over she insisted on talking about our 'relationship'. I didn't want to cause I scene so I just stayed quiet until I figured things out. While Sharon babbled on about our love I spotted Tony guiding Pepper up to his apartment, it did not make me feel good. I knew we had to keep it a secret, but I wasn't okay with leading Sharon on.
The pressure that was on my gash faded, I looked up and was faced with the saddest face I had ever seen on Steve, the beard pulled on my heartstrings. "Sorry...I didn't mean that. Where is he anyway..." I couldn't bring myself to say his name but Steve just looked away from me "Steve, where's Bucky?".
Something about the way she smiled irritated me "And what's your theory?" "You are in love with someone". I finish off my glass of whiskey and open the room door "Great theory go get yourself a noble prize". She rolled her eyes, but didn't get up so I swung the door shut "I think you messed it up and that's why you've been so miserable in the meetings, and why you haven't made up your mind about being CEO".
We spent a bit of time socialising, but then it was time for dinner. It was a rustic style dining area, there wasn't a top table, just a small table for Pepper and Rhodey, so Tony sat next to me at a table for the team, Thor, Bruce, Clint, Laura, Natasha and Bucky. The rest of the superheroes were scattered around on different tables. The dinner was served and there was a relaxing atmosphere well established by the time they got up for their first dance. Once the rest of guests joined them on the dancefloor Tony leaned over, moving his hand onto my thigh "How about we sneak away" his hand slipped onto my crotch. I smirked and let him lead me away from the empty table.
Pepper dragged me out one morning and made me look presentable. We got into a limo with Natasha's and Bruce. They were going through a rough patch from what Natasha had been telling me. We pulled up at the hotel, there were massive crowds. Before getting out Natasha grabbed my wrist and pulled me back into the car
"I'll keep this as short as I can, I know there have been rumours that maybe I will just retire from Stark industries, and you all know the cliche, when someone who doesn't really want to retire is made retire they say it's because they want to spend more time with their family. I have a massive family at the Avengers facility back home, but when I wake up in the mornings I feel totally and utterly alone because I don't have my own family. Because of who I am, and the status I have, I haven't been able to live my life the way I want, I haven't been able to be who I am... I just came here to say, I am in love with Steve Rogers".
He rolled onto his back "I can read that in your damn museum, come on tell me something juicy", I didn't know what he wanted "like what?". He rolled back onto his saide and supported his head with his hand "Well you worked in a bar, what was that like?" "I got bet up a lot by guys trying to mess with women who rejected them" he laughed "So you never knew when to quite?" "If you belive in something you never give up". He ran his hand through his hair "and how did you meet Barnes?" .
"Nat did we not just pass the meeting room?", she smiled "Well Tony we have a surprise". "Where are we going?" she turned around and walked smoothly backwards "If I told you then it wouldn't be a surprise" I raised my hand "I feel unconformable last time I didn't know where I was going I ended up in a cave in the middle east of three months" she turned back around not tolerating my jock "Shut it Stark.".
It was pale pink and my name was elegantly written on the front. I went back to my room and wripped it open. It was exactly what was on the screen, but the RSVP date was blanked out. I shoved the invite in my bedside locker and went for a shower.
He left and Tony started to dress while I brushed my hair. He looked perfect, I was actually stunned when I saw him, I just watched him for a while, then he reached in his pocket and offered me "jellybean?" I laughed, of course, only Tony would store a pack of jelly beans in a wedding tux. He chewed on the sugar and started to move "Let's go get Rhodey".
I blushed a little, before I pushed his face away "Come on Captian, I'm all yours for tonight". He ran his tongue along the shell of my left ear, making me shiver. He pecked my lips before moving to my right ear and running his hot tongue along it "Don't you get it Tony, your all mine, every night". He didn't give me a chance to respond he kissed me again in the lips.
I took my seat at the table of older people in suits and business skirts. I raised my hand gently to my lip "Does anyone have any objection to me being the active CEO of Stark industries again?". Three people raised their hands, one of the older men mumbled to the man next to him "Howard wouldn't want a faggot running his company".
We started kissing in short but passionate bursts, he took off my jacket and loosened the tie around my neck before kissing the skin he was revealing. I moaned "God Steve, four days is too long without you" he slowly guided his hand over my trouser covered hard "did you get off without me?". I caught my lip between my teeth and shook my head.
Jane dipped her hand into the bag first, she pulled out a toy bird, Sam smiled and Natasha moved them into the closet. Seven minutes flew by and I opened the door, Jane was blushing and Sam had a smile on his face "Times up". Jane went back and sat next to Thor, who didn't look very impressed.
"Pepper did you give birth already!?". She bit her lip and whispered, "No, Tony, I lost the baby". My jaw fell open a little "God Pep, I'm so sorry, I didn't hear, are you okay?". She sat down "Yeah, it's okay, we're moving on". I sat down and wrapped my arm around her shoulder "you'll get your chance, and when you do, James is the best guy you could have done it with". She took my hand "I am sorry, the way things turned out between us, I wish it was different". I sighed "It's okay, I should have been honest with you". She smiled "Let's not get into who was the worst, how are things between you and Steve?". I smirked and looked down at my feet "Really, really good". "I'm glad your happy Tony" she rested her hand on mine, I leaned in and pressed my lips to her cheek "You are going to make a beautiful bride".
He sat on the island stool and looked at his phone. Me and Sam watched for his reaction, his smile was as real as I had seen in a long time, "whatcha smiling at Cap?" Sam asked slyly. He put away the phone "nothing, just Maria briefing me for my mission tonight". I smiled "Wow, another lone mission? Do you want me to go with you?". His face dropped, I knew he was lying "No Buck, it's okay, I don't mind doing these little things for Nick, keeps me busy".
Scott and his girlfriend were mid-laugh. She had on a yellow jumpsuit, with a velvet look, that came off her shoulders. Scott looked like a bumble bee with his black suit and yellow tie but they were really happy.
The dinner was really nice, over time I had forgotten what It was like to just sit and chat with a group of friends. Most of the older people and younger kids had gone to bed by the time Bruce brought the third round to our table.
I thought it would be hard to hide our relationship with so many people living with us, but it wasn't, it was actually easy.
He sat up but I moved my body so I was comfortably on his crotch. I swayed back and forward "Are you sure you want me to stop". I didn't budge, his blue eyes seemed different, they were darker and his pupils were bigger. I lowered my head and pressed my tongue to his exposed neck. I had earned a moan from him, I started to feel his dick harden under me, he growled "You're engaged Tony" I rolled my eyes "And you are the straightest man in America Steve" I got close to his ear to whisper "I want you, Rogers, I'm all yours ". That did it, he was now fully hard under me. He grabbed my ass and picked me up, carrying me to a room, hopefully, one with a bed in it, but I'm not picky.
Things were really quite for a while, I took the opportunity to get a romantic weekend away with Steve for his birthday. I told everyone I was going to my beach house, and Steve told them he had a mission, which Natasha helped sell the idea. It was a great weekend, we spend the whole time doing real couple things, we went to my cabin, just in case someone did come looking for me at the beach house.
Before we even went through the door we could hear shouting. I looked at Tony, he put his hand over Bruce's shoulder as he pushed open the door. There were beer bottles all over the place and take away boxes. I looked around, my jaw fell open a little, there were needles just lying out on the coffee table.
Bruce wandered over to the door and pulled it open "This is my step dad's restraunt, we lived upstairs". He glanced around and walked away with his hands in his pocket. "Just give me a second with him" Natahsa smiled with worry in her eyes.
Natasha smiled at me "What are you talking about Clint?" I rolled my eyes "I'm talking about you two fucking all night!" Banner jumped in "woah woah woah, that was not us!". Natasha agreed "We heard it too, but we just muted the room".
He sat me up on the workspace, I wrapped my legs around his waits and let him take control. His large hands pulled the hem of my t-shirt over my head and pushed me back onto the table, he ran his mouth from my neck to my arc reactor.
It was 3am, the only sounds in the whole compound was Tony's muffled grunts. I lay over him and took his hand, picking up the pace, he was gripping the sheets with his other hand. I was trying to get a grip "Don't cum yet Doll" he whined through the fabric. I re adjusted and he changed tone, I found his prostate, I hit it a few more times "Okay, you can cum".
He put his other hand up to my mouth "Suck", "Are you sure you are a virgin", he bent down so his head was close to my ear "Just because I haven't done anything, doesn't mean I haven't thought about this, now suck Stark.". I did what I was told and covered his fingers in spit "Are you sure about this Tony" "I've never been so sure about anything more, now put in one finger, then another when I say". He jabbed the first finger in fast "Ahhhh" "oh my god did I hurt you?, I'm sorry " I exhaled sharply "No it's okay, keep going". He pushed his finger in and out of my ass for a while before adding the second and started working me open.
"Friday, turn off the lights". I climbed up the stairs and lay down on my bed, Steve came out of the bathroom in pyjamas and wrapped his warm arms around me, I let a sigh of content escape my lips "I love you, Stevie". He pulled me tighter into the cuddle "I love you".
Bruce hadn't moved form the stairs of the workshop "Go on Tony, tell him". I sighed "Bruce has caught me before, in bed, with men, while I was engaged to Pepper, when we first hooked up I told him it was just like that, meaningless, but now I want him to see that, I'm in love with you...". Steve's eyes widened "You're...in love with me?". I nodded.
Clint picked up the phone "I'll take a message, yeah, okay, and who is this?, right okay, yeah I'll tell him, that should be fine, thank you". He hung up the phond and went back to the bow "Stark, that was your house keeper, she said you left your sketchpad in the cabin at the weekend, she's going to post it out". I looked at Steve who was looking at me "Thanks Barton".
The glass was blacked out, something was off. I inputted my pin and walked through the door. I scanned the room, all my workspace was fine, it was a mess, but I could tell everything was where it was meant to be, then I turned to look at the break area.
He pulled away quickly and folded his lips inwards "Sorry, I didn't mean for that happen". I took his waist in between my hands "Well is it so bad?" He turned his back to me and took a few steps "Steve, I think it's best that we are just friends". I exhaled roughly "Okay, fine Tony, we'll just be friends". He was definitely shocked by my acceptance, little did he know I was already planning on his to get him back.
"Thank you!". I read through the results and scooted back in my chair "Go tell Steve!". I smiled "Friday where's Captian Rogers?" "He's getting ready for the gala Sir, the team is leaving in five minutes, I believe they told you sixte-" "Mute" I laughed at Natasha "Can I still come?". She nodded "Of course you can".
I couldn't help the laugh that came out, but he was embarrassed. I ran my hand over his face and smiled "Steve, trust me, you don't need any help". He was still blushing "But Tony...do you...Emm...do you want to do...stuff like that?".  "Steve Fifty shades of grey is extreme BDSM, I'm not into all the whips and kneeling, I just like someone to take control, some light bondage, and a little name calling, but if you ever want to try anything just talk to me, babe". He thought for a minute "But your happy the way things are?" I smiled "of course I am, I have you". His smile melted my heart, I kissed him softly but he pulled away and sighed "We should probably get to sleep" "yeah...but I'm not going another day without some love" he kissed my forehead and carried me over to the bed.
I smiled and looked up at the sky "What are you doing Tony?" "It's just really hot" I laughed "So why are you unbuttoning my shirt". He looked into my eyes, dragging his fingers up my bare chest, before leaning in to kiss me.
Natasha sat me down in a circle for a game of seven minutes in heaven. I grumbled "Oh I'm sorry I forgot we were all twelve years old". Natasha was leading it "I'll go put items in the bag to represent everyone and then everyone will pull an item out of the bag".
Tony told us about what happened, but the seriousness didn't last long, even Thor joined in on the jokes "So Steve, how much for you to tie me up?" His expression saddened "How did you know about that!" Everyone laughed, Tony rubbed his back comforting him.
I lay a hand on his shoulder but he swatted it away "How could I possibly expect you to understand anyway, I can't wait to see what you have in store for us, what's your worst memory? Huh? Too many girls throwing themselves at you, or too much money for a 17 year old to spend? I wonder how many cars your had going to high school! Stark you have no idea what home means". I didn't respond to him I just walked away, the guy just watched his wife die and he couldn't do anything about it.
"Ehh guys, do you see that?" his nervous tone made me uneasy, I jumped up and stridded over to where he was standing. There was a small ship in the sky, I watched as it landed right next to the open barrier. I wouldn't let Thanos hurt anyone else. While Nat and Bruce stood looking in shook I ran off through the fields, ready to take lives and willing to give up mine.
I didn't even notice that he disappeared, and came back with a warm towel, he wiped up and threw the towel into the wash basket before snuggling up next to me "Well you did it Cap", he pulled my body into a spooning position "Did what?" "I'm gay". He laughed "I know Tony".
I got over to the ship with my new shields at the ready. The door was open, I slowly walked in and took a look around, it was deserted. I got a horrible feeling in my stomach, it felt like my insides were being pulled apart. Printed on the wall, in clear white writing 'Stark Industries'.
He was able to run his fingers over the top shelf but still couldn't quite reach. "Tony are you sure-" "it's fine I have it!". He placed his leg up on thr table, I looked at him again, his trousers fell down a little bit and I jumped up out of my seat, I hit Sam, and pointed. He gasped, sticking out above his waistband  were a pair of of deep red, skimpy lace boxers.
A fleet of cars were coming near the compound "That's a lot more cars than what left here" Tony walked towards the lift "Did no one tell you? That's the after party".
I woke up feeling great, the sun was shining in on us, I studied Steve for a second, his skin was beautiful in the light, a smile came across his lips "Stop staring". He opened his eyes and kissed my lips. He moved his hand down my hips "Well what's little Tony doing up this early?". I rolled my eyes "Dreaming about you". I guided my hand up his thigh and felt his morning wood. I smirked and sat onto his stomach.
She was in a tight black dress and carrying a pair of silver shoes "So what are you doing here if you're not a reporter anymore?"  She invited herself to sit on the bed "Well I was down at the bar looking for some meaningless sex but once I heard you were here I just knew where to go". I knew she was being sarcastic but just to be sure I snorted "not happening". "Oh I know Tony, I'm just testing my theory".
We searched in silence, listening to the fight still going on. Then Tony burst through the door with Bruce, they were arguing "Cap can you please tell him that he needs to stay out of this and remember it's not real!" I automatically agreed "Bruce it's okay, I know it's hard to watch, but Tony's right, we need you with us". Bruce blinked at me and shook his hear "You have no idea what is about to happen Steve, and therefore you don't get a say in the matter".
It was dark, but my arc reactor still gave off some light. He looked satisfied with himself, "What's your plan Steve?". He got closer to me and ran his tongue over my ear "I'm just playing a game Tony". I couldn't resist him, "Fuck it" I took his head and pressed my lips to his.
There was no doubt in my mind he loved Peggy more than me. She was his soul mate, they would have been the perfect match.
I was tightly pressed behind Tony, I took his hand and slowly intertwined our fingers "Hey Tony? Remember you said just because I had sex with you doesn't mean I have to marry you?" He rolled out of the cuddle so he could look at me, but he still played with my fingers.
He sat up, kind of annoyed "You keep saying that. Steve, I'm sorry, I should have believed you, I should have talked to you" "I wish I could have done things differently, I really do". His face dropped but he was smiling. I turned around, he was looking in disgust at his cut "Could you put that back on here please?". I got back onto my knees and pressed the shirt to his cut "What happened to you Stark?".
It's a three-hour flight from New York to Orlando, I spend the whole three hours going back and forward from business to Steve. Eventually, the jet lands smoothly and I step off.
I turned around and placed my fist against the wall he was standing in front of, next to his head, trapping him "I don't need you're protection Stark" I moved away and picked up my jumped "and don't expect me to be here when you get back".
He licked my ear again "all mine". My gasp couldn't eascpe because his tongue was pushing against mine in my mouth. Something changed in my mind, Steve was a lot more than a hot fuck, I was just as love struck as him.
He stepped back onto the floor, pulled out a suit case and began sorting through clothes. "So you finally have the business sorted out, when can we tell everyone about us?". He kept his back to me and stopped for just a second "Em... I don't know... soon".
King of Wakanda even managed to join us, the orange tie stood out but his sister Shuri looked fantastic in her orange, off the shoulder dress, it had Roses along the strap and fell nicely. In the photo she had just flicked her brother in the ear.
"Cap would you take the boxes out to the bin?", he took the boxes and disappeared, "okay tell me what's wrong?". He looked down, and had a gloomy look "I got into a fight with May" "over what?" He swallowed the little bit of crust he had in his hand "Harold". I raised my eyebrows "Happy?" He nodded "Why?" "He's dating May, so I told her if she didn't send him home I was leaving" "Jesus kid did you tell her where you were?" "No". I pinched my nose and took out my phone 'the kid is at the compound with me and Steve, don't worry he'll be fine with us tonight'.
The bathroom door opened, I quickly put the drawing back and threw the journal onto the bed. Steve came out in grey tacksuit bottoms and a blue t-shirt, and no beard. I tilted my head "You shaved" "You said you didn't like the beard" his smile, his perfect teeth and eyes, they all pulled on my heart strings "I guess it wasn't that bad".
I put my head back down and dazed off, Scott nudge me. I looked up to see Natasha and Banner, I clapped my hands slowly "Well there they are! Thank you so much for keeping me awake the night before the most important mission of my life!". They both just sat down in front of me.
He followed me and sat down in the common area while I went to the door, I looked at the monitor by the door and sighed. He rang the doorbell again "Eh, Mr Stark, Are you home?". I looked back at Steve and then to the monitor "Friday? Hello? Anyone? It's Peter, Peter Parker".
He looked extremely confused "Mr Stark, I didn't want to offend your design skills, but there isn't a wardrobe in my room". I didn't believe that at all for the reason Tony spend many sleepless nights making sure Peter had the perfect room. Tony rolled his eyes and walked out, followed by Peter and I tagged along.
Steve pulled away from me, lowering the gun "My biggest fear is losing the love of my life and being responsible for it..." He was looking deep into Peggy's eyes. He placed his finger around the trigger. He pointed it up and looked me in the eye "I don't love you". I closed my eyes "I understand".
Next we provoked Steve "Come on Steve!". He just sat with a stirn look on his face "I'll be honest, after Pepper left, I was pretty down, and things happened". Tony pulled the t-shirt off Steve's body and turned him around so we could all see the deep red lines on his back "Happy now? Cap and I fucked, one time, it doesn't mean anything, it's just one of those things, like how Clint and Natasha hooked up" I stood up "Before I was with Laura!" He rolled his eyes "but seriously guys, this is a secrete, it stays between us, and if any of you leek it I will shut you down".
He ran his hands through my hair while I bobbed up and down, slowly taking more everytime, until eventually he hit the back of my throat. I resisted the urge to gag, but then I felt his warm and sweet cum slide down my throat. I pulled off him and sat onto the floor. He was putting his trousers back on, while I pulled my own down, I was about to start jerking off, but he got down onto the floor and took my hard into his fist.
He hesitated "...Yeah, I do, but I just don't think we need everyone else's opinion". I shook my head "I couldn't care less about everyone else's thoughts on us, it's not about that, I want to be able to go out to romantic restaurants with you, hold your hand while we walk in the park, go to the cinema without bringing Bucky or Bruce, I want to be your boyfriend Tony". He threw the clothes he had into the case "I want to be your boyfriend too, but I can't tell anyone, I can't do it Steve, why don't you understand that?".
"Actually I said just because you fucked me, but yeah" I smiled because I knew I was blushing "What if, someday, maybe, I possibly might want to?" He looked into my eyes "What are you talking about Steve?". I looked away from his beautiful big brown eyes "I'm trying to ask you out".
I got up early to take a shower and get into a suit, Tony was awake when I stepped out. He sat up and pulled the covers up to his neck, "You look, super sexy". I blushed a little, he wiggled his finger of me to come close. I crawled up on the bed and kissed him softly on the lips. I could feel a smile on his face "That suit looks great on you, but I think it would look better on the floor" I made a small attempt to pull away "Tony-". He already had me trapped under him.
I pulled the screen away from him and placed it on the nightstand "I think we could be doing something a little more fun". I started to kiss him slowly, his arm wrapped around me and moved up and down my back. Then the door opened "Hey Tony I know you're-". Natasha was standing in the doorway holding a tablet and staring blankly at us.
"Sharon, can we talk?" She smiled "Of course, just give me one minute, talk to Bucky and I'll find you when I get back from the lady's room". She kissed my cheek before running off. I turned to Bucky "What's going on Buck?" his laugh brought back memories "I see you have a girlfriend" I just shrugged "Apparently I do, I think there's just a misunderstanding somewhere" "Well I don't think it matters she's very fine, just go with it". I looked down "she's not for me, but if you want I can set you two up?". Something about the way he looked at me told me he knew "Nah I'm not looking to date right now". I threw my arm around him "If you ever decide to start, get a haircut first".
I heard footsteps, and looked up, it was Scott and Thor. "What's wrong Clint?" Thor asked, sitting down next to me. Scott answered "We didn't get a lot of sleep last night" "That goes for the two of us so" Wong walked in and took a seat.
Peggy was now standing next to me, her voice was colder "If you lie to yourself and shoot the wrong person, you will not get the stone and your friends die". I tried to provoke him "Come on Steve, shoot me already, it's okay".
Eventually the music changed tone, it was slow, Tony wrapped his arm around my waist and took my hand, his head rested on my shoulders and we swayed. It was the most peaceful moment I had had in a really long time, I closed my eyes to take it in.
Bruce wasn't with us in the hall. It was just four of us now. The setting wasn't familiar to me so it was Steve's. Music was playing and people were dancing. "Leave it to Steve to fear social interaction" Clint was the only one who laughed with me.
The woman pulled the brown sack off the man's head, he mumbled and cried through the ducktape. Nat whispered "Their is only one place the stone could be, and it's in that necklace around my neck". Young Natsha began to shout "No, no, no".
There was an unbelievable crowd at this thing, I wasn't even sure what it was for. The man at the entrance took my keys and gave me a slip. All the cameras turned to me, questions being shouted, flashes, and screams. I ignored it all and walked straight up the red carpet. The security guard held the door open for me without even checking for my name.Straight away I spotted the table with my friends at it, and Sharon.
The sunset on a kingless Wakanda, the warriors that were left started a mourning ritual for their king. I could see the city was dimly lit from where I was sitting in the forest. It was freezing, I could see every breath I took. I heard voices coming towards me.
"I don't know MJ it's not opening" I folded my lips in and closed my eyes, hoping that they would go away. "Peter I need my case". I looked over and seen their bags and mumbled "Sorry babe" I planted a kiss on his cheek and opened the door. "Sorry kids". We stepped out of the limo and walked off without any explanation.
We made out for a while, he moved his hand gently down my body and giggled "Do you even have a refractory period?" I looked down at my dick, erect again, "I guess it comes with the super serum". We went back to soft kisses while Tony began to get aroused again.
A few hours later Friday informed me all our guests were either in bed or gone home. I tip toed barefoot down the hallway, pushing open Steve's door. He put down his book and smiled "Are you okay Tony?" I nodded "Yeah I was just wondering if maybe you'd want to, I don't know, I mean you don't have to but-" his eyes made me soft, I sighed "Could you come sleep in my bed with me... it makes it easier to sleep" he chuckled, turned off his light, stood up and took my hand.
Steve asked to take a shower in my bathroom because he let Clint's parents stay in his room, not because we had a shortage, but because it was a whole lot nicer than the extra rooms.
We had a romantic long kiss as I slowly moved my body down onto his dick, mumbling as I did. He was looking me right in the eye with a cheesy smile. Friday alerted me to a priority line call, it played straight away "Stark get your ass out of bed and get down here, we don't have all day to wait for your jet to take off from our training ground". I tried not to move and cause a moan "That's the great thing about having a private jet Nick, I get to leave when I want".
He came back a little later, "what's going on Tony?". I stood up and he still had that troublesome look. "Follow me" he took my hand and dragged me into the lift "Where are we going?" He didn't answer, he just crouched down by the buttons and pressed his thumb firmly down, but there was no button there.
We got up to the roof where the rest of the team were, slightly less gloomy than yesterday but they all still had sadness in their eyes. They were lined up, Steve closet to me, glaring at me, Thor wearing a stupid smile, his newest pet sitting next to him, playing arcade defenders, Shuri standing at full attention long side Okoye, but no Rhody. "Nat, what's going on?" "You'll see".
I sat back on my legs and looked away "Sorry" "no, don't be, I'm okay". He moved down the bed and glided his fingers up and down my dick before wrapping them around it and twisting. I moaned and whispered his name until I came.
Tony was fed up, he brought us all back into the main bedroom and pointed "Wardrobe, bathroom, and your very own chill room for when you have friends over, but you don't really bring friends over that often".
Tony was putting on his new suit, I wrapped my arms around his waist and hugged him. "Steve, I'm sorry about earlier, I shouldn't have done that". I smiled "I didn't mind, I want everyone to you that your mine" he moaned a little bit "I am, I want to be yours...but we can't tell the world, at least not yet" my smile faded "As long as I have you, I don't care". There was a knock "Yous two going at it?" Tony laughed "You can come in Tasha".
"I don't hate you, Cap. I really don't" I pulled myself off the floor and onto the seat  next to him, he threw his feet across my lap "I don't hate you either Stark". He pressed both hands to his face "Stark, a cursed name" "What's so bad about it" I laughed but he was being very serious "People hear Stark they think Howard, war and death" "Tony that's not true" I tried to reassure him that his name was mainly associated with good. "It's what I think of when I hear it" his voice was dull and sad. "When I hear Stark I think of a brave, intelligent and caring man". He rolled his eyes "Wow take it easy Rogers, I'm engaged".
There was a knock on the door, I yelled "Don't come in" "As you wish Mr Stark" it was Thor "What's going on point break?" "I have been sent to tell you and Captian Rogers that breakfast is being prepared" "Thanks Thor, we'll be up in a few".
He crawled under the covers with me, obviously he was tired "I mean it, you have come a really long way with modern sex, well thanks to me, you would probably be having boring straight people sex with Sharon if it wasn't for me, so you're welcome.'". I held him close to my chest, strocking his hair slowly.
Dr Stephen Strange, a temporary guest, was wearing a maroon suit, matching with Wongs. Neither of them had dates for the night, and they would be heading back to their own home pretty soon.
Pepper kissed me again once I sat down, some of the kingsgaurd were floating about, she pressed her lips close to my ear "Come on, let's go to the meeting room for a bit of privacy". She pulled my hand and we ended up in an abandoned meeting room.
I looked back "Are you okay?". He hadn't moved "...Laura...I didn't save her" "It wasn't real Clint!" He looked at me with the coldest expression I had ever seen "But isn't it real!, Thor, his family is really dead, and Laura, and the kids, their gone". I looked away from him because I knew he was right "Come on Barton, the sooner we get this done the sooner we get to go home.".
I joined the so-called after party, there were a few randome people I didn't know. I politely made conversation with everyone until I found the mastermind, Natasha. She stood up on a chair and yelled "How about we all sit down and play a game of seven minutes I'm heaven!". The whole room cheered at the idea, Tony just stood in the corner and swirled his drink around, as everyone took a seat on the floor Natasha dragged him over and sat him in the circle.
He came out with whipped cream on both his nipples topped with cherries. My jaw hung down a little, he made his way over to the bed, I stood up and kissed him, starting at his neck before licking the cream from his chest. He laughed a little when I looked up at him, he bent down and licked the sides of my mouth where excess cream landed. He shoved me onto the bed, my feet planted on the ground firmly, he shook the can and sprayed it along my hard. I groaned because it was cold but I didn't complain because seconds later Tony's hot mouth was around me "Mmm, holy God Tony, you've got a very talented mouth".
We both started to get dressed and continued to argue "I'm not gay Cap" "Well Tony you had some pretty gay sex with me last night". I was being a bit to load, he whispered: "And that's all it was, sex, meaningless sex".
"Why aren't and Steve together?". I sighed "Not this again Nat" "Please, you two are perfect together" "We just can't be together". She crooked her head to the side "why not? You're out now, there have only been positive reactions, I doubt it would be any different for Cap." I took a long sip from the coffee cup next to me, but it was stone cold. I winced but swallowed it anyway.
I was shocked, the people were going crazy around him, everyone stared at me but I kept my eyes on the screen. I think Natasha was trying to talk to me but I was tunned into the TV, he was smiling "Any questions, but be cool guys because I can still kick your ass" he took one "So does this mean you are retiring?" He smirked, "Oh yeah that, no, I will remain as acting CEO of Stark Industries.". Eventually, Bucky broke me out of the trance "Steve we have to hit the road" I looked at the TV and back to him, and stood up "Yeah okay...".
When I opened my eyes again we were in another dark and dull room, brown creeky floors and faded pinky wall paper. Clint was curled up in a ball, still crying. I crouched down next to him "Clint, it wasn't real". He stopped crying and stood up but didn't say anything.
I found myself trapped between Steve's massive erection and a door, I made the best choice I could and kissed him. We ended up back on the bed. He started at my neck, sucking and biting, cause me to moan "ohhh Steve" he ran his tongue around my right nipped then bit it "Fuck!" He moved to the left nipple and did the same, getting the same reaction. He carried on, marking my whole body lightly with bites and kisses. He moved a bit down the bed to in between my legs, my cock was aching for attention but he sucked at my thighs, marking them too.
He rolled his eyes "At this point, I don't think you'll ever be ready". I was just about to walk out the door "If you walk about that door without telling me when you're going to come out we are done Tony, I can't wait around in hiding anymore, I've been hiding for all my life". I stopped and looked down at the door handle, I took it and pulled the door opened, walking out, leaving Steve, literally.
Her jaw slipped open "Oh my God, there's something else, what is it?". "It's Sharon" "what about Sharon?". I sighed "Two weeks ago when we came home..."
I got out of the bed and threw on a dressing gown, slipped his boxers off and threw them at him. Natasha finally got up "I won't tell anyone, but you might want to lock your door". Steve put on his boxers and got out of bed trying to put on his clothes. He was a little too quite for my liking "Steve they had to find out eventually". He was buttoning up his shirt.
I climbed onto the bed and spread his legs apart, a hand on each of his knees. He was hard again and was chewing on his lip "Come on Captian I know your not done with me yet".
I pulled the car into the drive way and we got out I handed him the key "Your just going to leave it there?" He smiled at me "Park". The car pulled up the garage and the door lifted opened. I looked at him in amazement, "Did I even need to drive that thing?" He laughed "Nope, it would have brought me right home".
We walked out of the common area and stayed silent but we heard Tony "Steve!". His footsteps were heavy on the stairs "What's wrong, where are Sam and Bucky gone?". Tony's voice was full of love "They're gone to the shop, I thought we could sit by the fire for a bit". Steve was now in the room, I took a peek, he had his arms wrapped tightly around Tony's waist.
We were all gathered in the common room eating take away. Tony and Bucky were sitting across from me, it warmed my heart to see them being almost friends. They were chatting about the food when I heard Tony "Honey?", my head shot up "Yeah Doll?".
After a while I was out of breath and ready to come, I impaled myself one more time he only had to stroke me once before I came. I let my head fall onto his chest. He lay me down softly but continued to thrust into me. He got faster faster, I kept my hands around his neck and started to claw into his back as I felt his tip hit my prostate. I couldn't make scene of my words, just a lot of moans. He came with a shout and let the cum leak out of my ass.
We lasted a whole seven weeks without any more people finding out, no one brought it up they just let us go on with our secret relationship. I was reading over some business forms, teachinally Stark Industries did not have a CEO after Pepper stepped done the board of directors just took it over until I was ready to go back .
I was sipping a glass of whiskey when Clint and Laura came over, they wanted to thank me and told me they were turning in for the night. I winked at Barton as he lead Laura away.
She blushed just the slightest and playfully shoved me "Go on, get out of here, you better not be late to dinner" "When have I ever been late?" I raised an eyebrow, she giggled and I swiftly moved out of the room, gently closing the door behind me.
He turned away from us "No, I'm not doing it, Tony I love you!". I smiled at him "I know you do, but you love her more, and that's okay". We didn't have time for this. I grabbed his two hands with the gun between them and placed the barrel in between my eyes "If you love me now Cap, you'll pull this trigger and bring everyone back home".
Pepper ran in and screamed, "Stop it!". Both men got off the ground and looked at her. She was crying and struggling to speak "I-i'm pregnant". Tony's face dropped she looked away from everyone "It's James's". Tony snapped again and went for his neck. Natasha shouted, "Steve get him out of here".
After the starters, I could literally see a thought pop into Natasha's head. "Tony did here Clint's life was put at risk yesterday", Clint puffed out "Oh my God Nat, stop!" She started giggling with everyone else but I didn't understand, "yeah, it was really scary!", "what happened?" Steve asked, but no one could stop laughing to answer, so Clint did "I almost choked last night" I sighed "Don't worry about it Clint, just make sure next time you take a breath before taking more" I realized what I was saying and stopped myself. "You know I'm talking about chocking on food, what are you talking about?" I moved out "chocking on stuff in general" Natasha laughed "Aww what a cute nickname for Steve, hey stuff, in general, can you assume a spoon".
Just before we got into the circle I whispered "I love you too Tony". Orange sparks flew from everywhere. Strings went about and went through the six of us. My body began to go numb I seen Scott along side Rocket salute me before I turned to Tony and gave him one last smile then everything went black.
Steve got up and took out a couple of the guys, I was helping Bruce look when I noticed a glow, Sarah's wedding ring. I took it off her finger and crushed the diamond that was glowing purple. Everything went white.
The ceremony was short and by the time I knew it they were kissing as man and wife. They ran out of the barn holding hands and headed back to the main hotel while everyone else hung around in the barn for drinks and quick snacks. I found Tony and pecked his cheek and stayed close to his ear "I know all attention is meant to be on the bride but I couldn't take my eyes off of you". He smiled and intertwined our fingers.
They all drew there weapons and opened fire, Steve's arms wrapped around me and bullets hit off his shiled. Barton ran over to the kids while Natasha blocked Laura and Bruce began searching for the stone "Check the box under the bed Bruce!" He shouted as he shot arrows.
Natasha placed both hands on my shoulders "Tony, focus on me, listen to me, there has to be something, when you were child, something that made you feel safe". I shook my head "Oh for God sake, I know where it is". I opened the wardrobe door, Natasha joined me and smiled as her eyes fell on what I was looking at. Steve was still watching the paramedics treat me.
He bit my nipple harshly, it caught me off guard and I yelled, he snapped at me "I told you to keep it down!" "You're the one that bit me!" He stood up so he towered over me "Do I need to make you be quiet?" I smirked "Maybe you do". He pressed down on my shoulder till I was on my knees and undid his belt. I was surprised he wasn't wearing any underwear but I didn't have long to think about it because he pressed my lips to his hard.
When I walked out I put on my pissed off face "I'm going to bed, thank you all for coming, I hope you enjoyed your time". Natasha chased after me "What happened Tony?" I grumbled "I don't love him Natasha, I don't want to be with him, that was the worst seven minutes of my life". I was speaking load enough for the whole party to hear me, then I stormed off to my room.
"What are you talking about Bruce?" I smiled but sweat started to form on my forehead "I went looking for you last night to share an idea and I stumbled upon you two-" I pulled him into a passage by his shirt collar "Listen, Bru-" "No Tony! you listen to me I kept your secrete last time but if your going to start fucking your teammates I can-" I yelled "I'm not! it was just one time".
Clint looked around "Are we in a walk in freezer?". Tony laughed, and patted my shoulder "Yeah, don't freak out Cap, we won't let you freeze again". I couldn't help but smile.
She was only gone a couple of minutes and returned with a bag "Remember ladies and gents, seven minutes everything goes, use it to ask questions you've been terrfied to ask or maybe something a little more scandalous, depending on what happens".
He took my wrist and pinned them above my head he used the other hand to line himself up. He went all in at once "Holy fu-" his hand wrapped around my mouth. After a minute he took it away and let it travel to my hard dick, looking for attention. He thrust in and out and whispered in my ear "oh Tony, you are the only one that can make me feel this way" "Shut up *pant* and talk dirty to me" his face turned pink and he went quiet but sped up. He stroked me at the same pace causing me to cum over his hand. I turned around to watch him lick his hands clean.
"Stark, back into the meeting room we're waiting". Steve Rogers standing in the doorway in disgust. Pepper pulled her hands out of my trousers and blushed as Steve turned his back and strutted away. She pressed her lips to my ear "We'll finish this later".
She brought me over to the table and opened up a leather bond Stark Industries book.  I scanned over the pages, they were plans to sell high tech weapons to countries in middle east. Tony's signatures were all over the documents. My heart was pounding extremely hard.
Pepper jumped up off the bed "So? Who cares about that, no one is going to be surprised Howard had a child". She gave Pepper a real bitch face and turned her attention back to me "That's true, no one will bat an eyelash if the story breaks that Howard had a daughter who he sent to England for Peggy to raise, but I think you know what this means".
I pushed Sharon off me and went after him. I looked around but I couldn't see him. Peter was laughing with Wanda "Hey kid, have you seen Tony?". He smiled "Oh-yeah- Mr Stark, he went that way". "Thanks, Peter". I clapped him on the back. I searched the whole crowd for him, eventually, I just texted him, I texted him a few times.
"I'm not just going to get you off so you can run away when we're done", I rolled my eyes "it's not the 50s anymore, just cause you fucked me doesn't mean you have to marry me". He stood with a dominant stance looking at me, I knew he wouldn't budge unless I provoked him "Fine, whatever, there are plenty of other men out there who would love to fuck me, I'll go find one of them and meet you back here for the mission in the morning". He got angry, exactly what I wanted.
"Come on guys let's clear out and let Tony put on some clothes" Bruce got rid of everyone. I didn't want to deal with these thoughts but they wouldn't go away. 'If you and Steve went public everyone will be invested in your relationship, maybe it could be a secret, no, that would just be more scandalous, being in the public eye is fine for you, you've been doing it your whole life but Steve...no it will be okay, we'll figure something out'.
Steve took my hands in his and rested his forehead against mine "I love you, Tony". I titled my head up a little "I love you too" he smiled "you're the best thing that has ever happened to me", I laughed "Well now I just feel sorry for you if I'm the best thing to ever happen to you". His lips got closer to mine "Oh shut up". When he kissed me he wrapped his arms around my waist.
Two weeks had past since Natasha found us in bed, but she was keeping up her end of the bargain. Her and Bruce broke up, but they ended things on good enough terms, she did admit that she may have had a small crush on Bucky, Thor and Jane also broke up, he was never here enough for her, but he was trying to rebuild his home so I don't know what she expected. According to my sources she was spending more and more time with a certain wizard surgeon.
I was making a smoothie to drink on my way to lecture at MIT. Steve was sketching with some paper on the sofa and Clint was fixing a bow he had gotten his daughter for her birthday. Laura had taken the kids out for something to eat for her birthday, and they had no idea Clint would be home when they got back. The phone rang, I yelled "Cappy can you get that, all you have to do his press the green button", I teased him alot, if people thought we didn't get along they wouldn't suspect anything. Steve rolled his eyes "You know I hate your nicknames for me!". Really he loved them.
I stood against the wall as Tony knocked on the door, no answer, he knocked again, no answer. Before knocking a third-time Rhodey's brother showed up with Bruce, both in matching suits to Tony, followed by Clint and Thor. His brother pressed the card into the key and everyone poured into the room, but Rhodey was nowhere to be found.  Spencer ran his hands over his face "This is really bad" Clint commented "Worse then really bad", Bruce tired to Tony "I thought you put him back here last night!" "I did, I swear!". They all started arguing among each other, I got into the middle of them "everyone needs to relax, yes this is a bad situation, but you all need to focus and find Rhodes, we've got to do something". Tong mumbled, "have sex?" I looked at him "what? No, stop suggesting that, this is serious Tony" Clint turned to Tony "Yeah, and we're all here to" Tony rolled his eyes "fine whatever".
We went into a deserted hallway "You are going to walk out that door, and I'm never going to see your conniving little bitch face ever again, you're going to leave Steve the hell alone, and the rest of my team for that matter!" She pouted "is that how you talk to your family Tony?". I grinded my teeth "We are half siblings Sharon, but you're not entitled to anything I have because you're not Howard's daughter". The smirkness in her face was gone, I smiled "You're Maria's daughter, she sent you to live with Peggy because she was scared of what Howard might do to you, sweet of mom to do that, but Howard's will specifically states-" she snapped "Alright!".
The room was neat, as far as teenagers standards go, but Peter was right, I didn't see any wardrobe, not even a bathroom, which surprised me. Tony walked over to the wall and pushed against a panel, it was a door. Peter was in absolute shock "Wait, what!". It was a walk in wardrobe.
Wong went throug the procedure one more time "Please get into a cirlce, and I'll make the bond, remember get the stone and don't die". I looked at Tony, he was scared, I could tell, I took his hand and pressed it aginst my lips "Don't forgot the promise I made to you" he looked down "Steve I lo-" he stopped and took his hand out of mine.
I opened the door, trying to scare them "Times up!". MJ had her legs wrapped around his waist and her arms around his neck as they were making out. I was stunned. Natasha pulled me away when Peter shouted. I didn't say anything, she laughed "I can tell you're just a little bit proud of him". I looked back to the closet door and then to Natasha "Was his hands on her butt?". She nodded and walked away, leaving me speechless.
He gasped for breath "So you just want to be friends?" "Shut up Steve". I pushed him against the wall and crouched down. I pulled down his pants and breathed hot air on his boxers. I worked fast, being aware of the short time we had. I pulled down his boxers and freed his erection. He gasped again as I took the tip in between my lips.
Sam and Bucky were in black suits with matching silver ties, Sam had made some joke about it matching Bucky's arm. They were in the front of the photo, down on their knee like a football team next to Stephen and Wong. Basically all the boys that didn't bring a plus one.
"I just want to know if you're claiming that you never slept with another guy while with Pepper". He took the bottle out of my hand and held it above my head "Give it back Steve!" "Tell me!" I jumped up but he just held it higher "this isn't funny Rogers!" "Just tell me and you can have it!". I was sick of this "You really want to know about that list Rogers, fine!, how about I tell you the first name on it, Howard Stark when I was a fourteen-year-old kid!". The bottle slipped out of hand and smashed against the floor.
I stood with my arm around Pepper's hip and her head resting on my shoulder, waving at the crowd and smiling for the camera. Clint ran off the jet after me, his whole family waiting for him. Three little children screamed "Dad!" and Sarah closely behind them hugged him. They stood next to the two of us and we watched as Natasha and Bruce stepped off holding hands, then Thor, with a smile, stepped off, everyone cheered him but his face totally changed and he ran towards someone. I couldn't believe it, I yelled "Wait a minute! No way! You were dead!". Loki turned around and smiled "Not the first time this has happened Mr Stark!". Thor grabbed him and hugged him tightly, I would need a better explanation later. Steve emerged after Thor, once again the crowd went wild, I looked away for just a second, and when I focused on him again he was kissing a woman. Sharon Carter.
We got onto the ship and Tony sat down in the pilot seat "Where are we going Wong?" "The centre of the earth". His laugh made me smile "Got an address for that?".
He curled up into the featul position next to me and watched me work. I got board in half an hour and turned to him, he was sketching in his jornal "Whatcha drawing Cap?" The top of his cheeks turned bright pink and he closed over the book "Oh nothing".
I opened my eyes to a bright light, I looked around and seen Steve, Natasha, Clint, Bruce and Thor. We all got to our feet. I looked around "Any of you guys know where we are?". Thor picked up his new axe "It's Asgard". Natasha's voice had a hint of fear in it, something I had never heard before "Thor what are we about to face?". "I don't know my frieneds but we must start looking for the stone".
He stood up and turned around "I'm going to go take a shower" I cocked my head "now?" "Eh yeah," he swiftly moved across the room and into the bathroom. "Okay then" I mumbled to myself, it was two in the morning, and we had to be awake by nine. I sighed and got into one of Steve's hoodies. I sat down on the couch with a cup of coffee. I glanced over at the table and picked up the DVD case, Steve came out of the bathroom, I turned around "Cap, where did you get this?" He turned kind of pink "oh uh Sam gave it to me..." "why?" He sighed and sat down next to me "...because... apparently the whole team thinks I need help in that area...with you".
We were still kissing when I heard Peter knocking at the door "Hey Mr Stark are you up?". Tony sighed and whispered, "I forgot he was here". I got off the bed and sat down on the chair. Tony scooted across the room, pulling one of my hoodies over himself as he went.
Out of the sky, six army helicopters landed around us and a very important looking man stepped out. Wong explained things while I kept an eye on the stones.
The whole place was filling with laughter. Tony smiled, placed his food on the table and stood up "Okay okay, the cat is officially out of the bag on that one". He came over to me and kissed me sweetly, everyone cheered. Vision was looking around "Am I the only one unaware of this arrangement?".
We landed in the middle of a green field god knows where. The team got off and we waited for instructions, Thor spoke up "This is what we identify as the centre of your earth, it has unimaginable power, more than the infinity stones".
All of a sudden my chair was pulled backwards and he turned me around to face him "Come on Tony, you have to go to bed, or at least put something into your body other than coffee". I picked up my coffee mug "I'm looking at something I could put into my body". I winked and went to take a sip of my coffee "stop being so flirtatious, this isn't healthy".
"How about a 10-minute break to clear our heads" Pepper suggested. She took my hand in hers and dragged me out the door. I caught a glimpse of Steve's angry face on my way out.
Sliding up and down on his dick he started to squeeze my ass hard "Cum inside me Steve" he did just that. He didn't stop there. As cum dripped out of my ass Steve's hand wrapped around my shaft and he pumped me.
Steve locked the door and turned around to face me, he had a perfect smile. I placed both my hands on his neck and kissed him. I climbed onto his lap, catching his lip between my teeth I pulled my jacket off and began to push his trousers down. I ran my hands over every bit of his shirt while we kissed.
I open my mouth as wide as I could and took all of him in, his moans were sweet music to my ears "Good Tony, so-o-oo good". With no warning, he shot a load down my throat with a satisfying moan. I looked up at him and he used his finger to wipe a bit of cum from my lip, I grabbed his hand, placing it in my mouth, sucking and swirling my tongue around his fingers.
Tony was prancing around with Pepper attached to his side all morning. I couldn't believe how he had mastered all the lies, and that he was actually going to marry her. We were sitting in the living area discussing tactic when the two of them came in. Tony sat across from me "So what's the deal? Fight some nightmares, get some stones, blow them to bit?", I couldn't help but roll my eyes.
When I came I bit his shoulder hard. I climbed off his lap and lay down next to him. I was totally out of breath but he seemed fine "That was a whole lot of fun Stark" "Easy for you to say you're not the one covered in these!" He had gone a bit overboard, I had hickeys and bite marks all over my body from ears to tighs. "Sorry..." "It's okay big guy".
We weren't standing there long before something happened. The space stone came out of the circle and fell perfectly into place on Shuris creation. I smiled, it only lasted a second because then Thor's body fell to the ground and blood pooled from his nose. I turned to Wong "What does this mean?".
General Ross gave a painfully long speech but finally let us get a bit of a party started. A few reports tried to talk to me but I took Pepper's hand and led her to my apartment in the compound "What the hell is going on?" She sat down on my bed "When James and I-" my jaw clenched "got back to New York we came here to meet with the Shield agents. I don't know how the hell she found out, but she did, she knows I'm pregnant with his baby, and she knew about you and Steve, when I didn't even know about you and Steve, she threatened to tell the media everything if we didn't keep our engagement going, she wants Steve".
I had waited a really long time to kiss Steve Rogers. I had a major crush on Captian America since I was 15. All those photos of him that Howard had were free porn to my teenage self. After I kissed him I was shocked he hadn't punched me, so I tried my luck again before I knew it we were making out. His tongue ran along my lips, but I wouldn't open up.
Now we were just lying, facing each other, "Tony, you don't have to do it with us tomorrow, Scott can do it insted" I didn't look him in the eye, I ran my finger around in a circle on the sheet "and why wouldn't I do it Steve?" He sighed "because the team don't need to know everything" "Do you want to know?" It startled him "Tony-I- whatever- it's really none-" he exhaled heavily and moved his hand to my knee "I'm here to listen to you talk about whatever you need to". It was the first time in my whole life that someone said that and I felt they actually meant it.
The door opened and I panicked, Sharon wrapped her arms around my neck and kissed me, I stumbled and fell onto the bed. Now Sharon was on top of me, she pulled away from my lips and we both looked to the door. It was Tony. "Sorry to interrupt, how could I forget my room is the local make-out spot". I called after him but he slammed the door and ran off.
Clint disappeared, I shouted "Fuck! We are running out of time!". My mom knocked on the bedroom door, it was nice to heat her voice, sweet and soft "Anthony sweetie?". She opened the door and screamed at the top of her lungs "Jarvis! Jarvis! Call 911!". I watched as she took my small body in her arms and rocked me back and forward "Come on sweetie, just hold on, please hold on Tony".
Thor had made a quick stop back home, they were rebuilding Asgard, but he came back for this. His grey suit was accompanied with a golend tie to match his date, Jane Foster. They reconnected recently and seemed pretty happy he had her in between his arms, hands linked together. Her dress was golend and sparkly, with a plunge neckline dress and a slit up the side.
"He seen me getting beat up by one of those guys in the back alley, saved my ass. After that he took me boxing everyday for like six month". I laughed thinking about those days. When I looked up at Tony he was staring at me. I closed the space between us, and glaced at his lips. The tiny movement I made caused our lips to brush off each other in a sweet kiss.
I pushed through the crowds and climbed into the car, straight to the jet. It felt like hours before I finally landed, I ran down the stairs, Happy had the door open of the car "Leave the bags, just please get me home".
I closed down the screen "Nothing, but I have to get going, I forgot I had to give this eh, talk, so I better get ready". I ran out leaving her standing in my workshop "Okay? I'll see you later I guess". I sat down on my bed and looked at the screen again 'please help us celebrate our wedding, James + Virgina'. I couldn't believe it. I went down to the main door and picked up the physical envelope.
I smiled "you ever tell anyone about this I'll kill you, here I'll give you a boost". She went to place her foot in my locked hands but when I looked up she was gone, just like Barton. I yelled "Steve!". He ran in "what, what happened, where's Natasha?" "Shut it, we don't have time, give me a boost".
"Nice beard Capiscle" he laughed. I pulled out a bottle of whiskey from the bar, kicked off my shoes and sat down on the sofa. He watched me closely, I could see he wanted to say something "Steve, don't, we don't need to do this". He looked down and shook his head, his head tilted back up but his soft smile faded "God Tony, you're bleeding" I took a long sip from the bottle "Well would you look at that, I am".
I dusted off my hands "Are we done here?" No one objected, I signed the documents and put on my sunglasses "I hope you all enjoy the dinner I arranged for you and your family, I won't be joining you, I have someone I need to get home to".
I took out the reference book and then my cheque book. I strutted down to the end of the table and put three cheques on the table, "That's for your share", I slip the cheque to the woman "that's for yours" to the man "and this is for yours" I leaned over and placed the cheque into the older mans pocket, the one who had called me a faggot.
That just left Steve standing at the end in his light blue suit. Sharon told him she'd meet him there.
She walked out the door, I stood looking down the hallway "Thank you Ms Everheart, and congratulations" "No problem Mr Stark".  My food arrived at last and I picked up the business folder I had been ignoring for almost six whole months.
I rubbed my hands down my face "None, but I have new gear for the team" "All the team?" I laughed "Yes even Steve" he jabbed his head away from me "I was talking about me but whatever, I guess your newest interest is more important." I was kind of shocked and stopped in my tracks but he kept walking "Jesus Bruce, your dick belongs in your pants, not in your personality". He turned around with a hint of anger, "And you know what Tony, Steve's dick belongs in his pants, not in your ass!" he was whispering but in a very aggressive tone.
Three fingers in I was getting impatient and listening to Steve moan was making my dick hurt. He took his fingers out "Tony, I don't have condoms" "so, not like you can catch anything" he smiled. He positioned himself at my entrance, both legs on his shoulders so my back didn't touch the bed. The suspensive was building, he took his hand away from my wrists and took one of my hands in his.
The room went silent when I walked in and just for a second, they all smiled. A crowd formed around me, Bruce hugged me "Oh my god Tony, you're alive, where's the wizard and Peter, where's the kid?". The whole room focused on me, I shook my head "They're gone". Bruce stepped back "Oh Tony, oh no". Everyone got a chance to greet me, Rhody was last he hugged me and patted my back "Where you back in New York? Did you see Pepper? I know she's alive but is she okay?". I didn't even know she was alive "No, I didn't see her".
I woke up in a hospital room, there was an IV coming out of my hand and beeping machines. My eyes were adjusting to the light, I was alone "Friday, where am I?" my AI responded "You are in a Wakandan hospital Sir". The door opened and I almost fell out of the bed. Peter walked in chewing on a chocolate bar, he dropped it when he seen me awake "Mr Stark!". I didn't get a chance to respond, he was by my side and hugging me. I smiled and patted the back of his head "It's so good to see you kid".
I got a reply 'I'm in the bathroom' I knocked on the bathroom door and pushed it open. Natasha and Bruce were in the middle of an argument. I went red from embarrassing "Sorry...I was just looking for Tony". Natasha snapped "Well he's not in here!".
Rocket cleared his throat "is he...?". Wong reassured us both "he is not dead, he will only die if they fail to retrieve a stone.".
I was so confused when Sharon kissed me when I got off the jet. I hadn't seen her in over two years, this was only our second kiss, I had kissed Natasha more than that.
He went back to his chair and stretched out, Steve rubbed my shoulders "I'm going to get ready for bed, I suggest you do the same". I stood up and walked away from Peter lightly holding Steve's hand, I whispered: "I'm sorry, I couldn't just send him away". Steve kissed my forehead "I know, it doesn't matter, we have a gorgeous suite booked for tomorrow night".
"So Pepper?" "Things are over she cheated on me". I bite into my bread "Yeah, but so did you Tony" I swallowed "It was with you, that doesn't count" "Why?" I shrugged my shoulders "Cause we're straight" he sniggered "so you're still going with that?" I tore into my sandwich and chewed slowly, staring at him.
We talked for hours, about everything, at the start he told me about Howrd, about how after I went into the ice things changed. He turned into a horrible monster, and no one but Tony and Maria knew. He told me a bit about his childhood, how Peggy would look after him, and talk about me. Then his body langue changed, he was defensive "Peggy went back to London when I was nine, it was like losing my only friend".
"Don't bite you lip sweetie, let them moans out" he pulled my lips apart with his, making me release the moan I tried to hold onto. He focused on my lips as his hands ran up and down my body, twisting a nipple every so often, but never my dick. "Your so sexy Tony, I can't beleive how gorgeous you look, stark naked, begging me to take you" I liked this side of Steve, but I was still Tony Stark "I definitely have not begged".
For a minute I let him have control, he was the one who kissed me. So I let him be the one to pull away. I was expecting him to get up and run away, never speak to me again but he didn't. He pulled me by the neck so our faces were only an inch apart "Tony...what are you...em..." "Did you not like it?" his damn smirk, his perfect teeth and soft lips, I couldn't answer his mouth was back on mine.
They sat down on the sofa, I looked at the two of them "What do you want?". Sam laughed "well Steve, you are dating Tony Stark" I smiled "Yeah, I know". "So we thought you might need a little bit of extra education in a certain area" I rolled my eyes, Bucky took out a DVD and handed it to me, I read it "Fifty shades of grey?". They chuckled, Bucky got up and smacked my bare back "It's not a secret that Tony is into this stuff". They both got up to leave but Sam giggled "I'll need that back though, just in case Bucky ever starts dating Natasha". His face dropped but Sam dragged him away.
We walked out the door together and looked in horror as we seen people running and screaming, children being snatched from mother's arms, people being shot as they tried to run. At the centre of it all, a big purple man with gold armour.
She smiled "Sorry for disturbing you...I just brought you a sandwich, I was hoping we could talk". I pushed all my bits and bobs to the side "What's up". She sat across from me and slid the sandwich across the table.
He finally stopped looking at me and turned his attention to Scott, Rhodey, Wong and Rocket "I have something for you boys too, go on out to the ship and suit up and get down to the lab". They thanked him and left, now it was just me, Tony and Pepper. I grabbed my case and made a move for the door "Cap" his voice made my heart skip a beat "Don't forget this" I turned around to see my old shield in his hand "I only made small changes, I know how much it means to you" I took it "Thank you, Mr Stark, I appreciate it".
I was sitting at the table in the kitchen while Sam was making breakfast. "Sam that smells great, what is it?" "Pancakes" I took a big whiff of air "Seriously they smell great". Natasha walked straight by the table "Morning boys". Sam mumbled while I froze up "Mor-morning Natasha". I face palmed when she was out of sight.
Regardless of my personal life and issues the universe still needed the Avengers help, we still had people we needed back.
I rooted in my pocket and press a couple of buttons. Then ringing filled the silent room. He didn't turn around but he answered the phone. I sighed "I need you Cap" he turned around with a soft smile, walked across the room and wrapped his arms around me "I-I need you too Tony".
He giggled "Friday, music please" music started playing, music I recognized from the 40s. "We didn't get to finish our dance". The music was up best and fast, "Tony I don't know how to", he moved his feet and arms with the music "Just act like you know what your doing".
I got him into some pjs and then got into mine. We snuggled up closely in bed and he started to drift off almost straight away, I whispered "Tony?" "Mmmmhmm?" "What happened to Pepper's dad?" He just mumbled "alcoholic" I didn't say anything more, it was just his snores that filled the room.
I stayed cooped up in my workshop for a few days with a bottle of whiskey and the door locked. I hadn't talked to Steve, but the media was blowing up with all the photos of him and Sharon.
How embarrassing, "Yeah...I mean..." "Holy fuck am I going to hell for this" I laughed but I didn't know how to handle this situation there was nothing in any leadership book about sleeping with your teammate. "I'm really sorry" he took his trousers off the ground "Tony where are you going?" "I'm sure there is another empty bedroom somewhere here"I stood up "Don't go". He turned around and waved a hand in the air "Fucking me is one thing, taking Captian America's virginity, that's a sin" he went to open the door but I slammed it shut with my fist, he turned around and realised he was trapped "You love to sin, Tony,".
While he caught me up on how everyone was doing Clint kocked on the door. Steve left us alone for a minute "What's up bird face", he smiled and smacked his hand off mine "I just wanted to say, I'm so sorry for anything I've ever said about your privileged childhood, I never would have guessed you were..." I gave him a soft look "Don't worry about it Barton, shit happens we have to move on".
I went for a shower and came back to see Steve making sandwiches. He handed me a sandwich without looking up. I smiled because it was my favourite, tuna, "You're getting better at this" he finally looked up "T-tony, did I do that?" I looked at my shoulder where there was an intense bite mark "Cap you have to understand, that's the way I like it!". He joined me on the couch with his sandwich, ham and cheese.
I could hear the team talking, they were all exhausted, I couldn't face them, I continue past the meeting room door and into the empty living area. I sunk into the chair and gazed out the window. The sky was black, right now the half of the universe that survived are devastated and I couldn't do anything about it.
It was a nice romantic moment, a loving and caring kiss. I stepped away from him "how about we go up to our room?" He scowled a little "It won't be ready for another hour, and we can't be late to dinner". I pouted in thought "Well the limo is still here, unattended?" He grabbed my hand and tugged "let's go!".
We didn't have enough time, I couldn't think of anything that my teenager self held importance in. Orange sparks grew around Clint's wrists "Cap, we're running out of time" "It's fine Clint, just keep looking". He was getting just as frustrated as me.
I turned away from her and smashed the glass of water "Two fucking years, right, I'm going to kill him" "Tony-". I was gone out of the meeting room and was on my way to the lab. Pepper stood at the meeting room door, shouting down the hall "At least I had the balls to tell you who I was sleeping with!". I got into the lift and headed for the lab.
I couldn't watch, I squeezed my eyes shut and heard the bang before a white glow hit me in the face. I only had a minute to think about how Steve, Natasha and I were meant to find Tony's stone, without Tony.
"Let's go home Tony". I wripped the head off the teddy and lying in the stuffing was the stone. I placed it in my palm, Steve put his hand over mine and pressed them together until the stone crushed and everything went white.
Sharon pranced in with a devilish look on her face "Oh Mr Stark I think we have some things to talk about".
"I know Tony, it's fine, I'm okay with the whole world knowing that you are mine, I want everyone to know, so can we please get this out in the open?" "Steve I have so much going on with the business, as soon as I get it sorted out we can talk about it". He took his jacket off the chair and opened the door, looking left and right "I'll talk to you later sweetie".
I sat down next to Steve at the table with a cute smile. He looked down at his lap as if I had done something stupid "Natasha told me some things". I scooted in closer to him "Good, I have more things to tell you as well". The band started playing something soft, all the couples at our table got up to dance, even Stephen, Wong, Sam and Bucky had found girls to dance with. I stood up and straightened my jacket, I stuck my hand out for Steve to take "Care to dance?".
"So everyone else is going down to the wedding the day I get home, but we can spend that night together and drive down the next morning, -" Steve interrupted "Tony I told you, I'm not going to be here when you get home unless you're  honest with me about where we are going". I put on my glasses "and I already told you I'm not ready, what happened to I'll wait forever, Rogers?".
He pressed down on my shoulders until I was comfortably sat down on his bed. He climbed onto my lap and kissed me, we stayed like that for a few minutes before I mumbled "Tony, you've packed, right" "No". I sighed and pulled away from his lips giving him a look that probably resembled my mom.
There was a massive fight going on, I didn't know between who or why but it was intence. As we searched the desk the little microscope began to glow, I picked it up, there was a little card "Happy Birthday Bruce ~Love Mom". His mom died on his birthday.
He smirked a little "Four days without a release must be torture for a slut like you". I moaned deeply, I was loving every second of it, "I'll have to cancel all my business trips if it means being away from you". He was undoing my belt "Or you could just bring me with you". I threw my head back in a moan, but be got off the sofa and smiled "You don't look very comfy, why don't you talk them off, and I'll be back in just a second, I just need to run up to the bedroom".
I had to call a meeting to brief everyone on the mission, but all I could think about was Tony. I didn't want to force him to tell me about that, I felt awful. He didn't turn up for the meeting but I didn't send someone to go get him. James and Pepper had left to go back to New York.
I started to unbutton his shirt, "God, I want you so bad", we grinned at each other as the two of us knew how much the other was craving this. The car door was pulled. We both looked up, I pressed my finger to my lip. Neither of us made a noise.
A mistake, it hit me hard. "A mistake? Tony we've been through this before, you know it wasn't a mistake" I grabbed his hands but he pulled them away "Steve, I was just feeling down, dealing with stuff, I just needed to feel better about myself". I sighed and pressed both my hands against the sink "Tony you're just lying to yourself again, are you just going to marry Pepper?". Pinched the bridge of his nose "No, I'm going to marry Pepper, I'm gay" "So why can't we be together?". He snapped and started to shout "Because I'm not in love with you, I just wanted you to fuck me, so why don't you run off back to your girlfriend and leave me alone!".
