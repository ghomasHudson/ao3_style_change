“How sure about this are you?” Bucky grunted, obstinate as ever, but Tony saw the shift in his eyes, the there and gone again flash of something young, bare, and vulnerable.
Right. Tony’s eyes stung and he blinked away the sensation. Leave it to Stefen’s children, to show him what bravery was.
“Stand back.” He instructed as he stabbed at the window viciously, the end of the broom cracking the glass in spider fragments that tinkled as they fell to the floor. That sound was going to haunt his dreams.
"I'm sorry. It's just a terrible ache in my back." She admitted after a moment, and Deiter's frown deepened. It would be a few hours more before they reached their destination but they weren't on a strict time schedule. Their route should be taking them past the town of Kitzbuhel within the next half hour.
Steve realized with a sinking heart that she was selling her clothing as he watched her slide the basket over the counter and Susann examined its contents. A thick fur coat, and a stately men’s suit, joined a neatly folded pile of shimmery blouses on the countertop.
“What on earth is going on here?” Tony asked, walking into the room to find nearly the entire household gathered around an alarming number of packages of various shapes and sizes.
Steve crumpled the letter in his fist. He was going to be sick. It must have shown on his face because before he knew it Virginia was pushing gently on his shoulder and guiding him into his chair.
Ian out of all of them probably had it best in the Young Folk. It was the second tier in the boy's programs, where boys from ages ten to thirteen started making the transition from young boys playing at war to young men training for it.
“Of course not. You always think that only you are responsible for taking the risks.” She replied with a sardonic lilt and Stefen didn’t bother trying to argue against that point either.
"I don't know. It's a big project." Deiter answered, glancing at her and taking note of the uncomfortable twist to her mouth. Traveling by car was not easy in these country provinces, and the consistent bumping and jolting was not kind on the body after long periods. "Personally, I think funds are direly needed elsewhere." The baroness turned her head slightly to look at him, a hint of curiosity in her blue gaze.
"What do you want Tacha? Just spit it out." He finally snapped nudging her with the toe of one socked foot and she glared down at it with an expression of disgust.
“The air any clearer out here?” he grunted in Romany and Steve tensed. Even here alone in the cramped stairwell he was aware of all the ears above and below them. Bucky shouldn’t take such risks, but that was Bucky. After what they’d just been forced to stomach back in the apartment with Zimmerman and the others, Steve knew that this sort of defiance was what Bucky needed. It was this or start throwing punches.
"Go away? But I only just found you." He tutted, sitting down on his heels until he was eye level with them and his nose almost touched the toe of the shoe Artur held out like a sword. She hoped he didn't decide to hit Tony. It wasn't nice or fair. They just wanted him to stay. Maybe he would if they asked.
Taking a good look around was the first order of business he determined, after he got something thrown together for the children to eat.
The river water was chillingly cold, but Tony just gritted his teeth against the icy chill and pushed with all his might, doing his best not to slip and fall face forward into the icy flow.
“Anyhow,” he rushed on before Stefen could figure out what to say (Good. Good, good, good). “The war broke out and when Rhodey, the only friend I had, enlisted I got the crazy idea in my head that I was going to enlist too, win back Pola for the Italians and make my mother smile. Which is funny, because it would have broken her heart. What mother wants her child ground through the gears of war because he has some stupid point to prove to his father?
Natacha was the first of them to abandon their frozen cluster in the doorway venturing inside with determined steps, her eyes sweeping over everything as if she were already making plans – the bed was big, but some of them would have to sleep on the rug, or make use of the loft. Tony made to follow her but a hand grasped Tony's shoulder and he turned, only to have something shoved into his hands. It was an envelope, cool, heavy, and papery.
After Vienna Tony hadn't been at all sure Stefen would continue his, for lack of better word, extension of friendship. Neither of them were dull men. What was brewing between them was plain, and he was well aware that Stefan could easily pull back the tentative olive branch he'd extended at any time, which would leave Tony where exactly.
“I’d give my life three times over for you. For all of you.” he said with finality. “Promise me you’ll stay here and don’t do anything rash. Promise me.”
“Then by all means, get yourself to safety Your Eminence.” Bruce growled, green eyes flashing at him with a resolution filled to the brim with rage. “But I’m not leaving. Not until I’ve done what I can!”
Nothing? The word blasted through him like a shot. Did that mean they hadn't heard from Tony at all? They would have! Steve's frantic mind insisted. If any of the monks had made it to Engzell, word would have been sent to Farkas. But Coulson said there was nothing.
She hesitated at the question, holding the ball close to her as if it were a shield. Tony’s heart squeezed.
She hadn’t had she? It suddenly occurred to Steve that he had no idea whether Natacha had started her cycles or not, and no strong conviction that she would tell her father such a thing even if she had. He didn’t think she’d tell Tony either. No matter how fond she was of the man, he was still a man and she’d be mortified to discuss something like that with him. She might have told Virginia. Steve hoped that was the case. It made him sick to his stomach, realizing that his daughter had no one to help her when it came to womanhood and the things that came with it.
His head felt clearer though. Clear enough to remember with agonizing detail the way he'd knocked her father around the morning before and the things he’d told Charlotte that night. He suddenly didn't doubt that Natacha had emptied the entire pepper pot into his drink. It would be just like her.
Tony had never been more grateful for the forgiving hearts of youth as he scooped the girl up and pressed her close.
Péter’s mouth fell open again as he watched Tony shout at the terrifying monk with the one eye, screaming curses at the top of his lungs, heedless of who he woke or the fact that they were supposedly on holy ground. It should have been terrifying, because Tony didn’t lose his head over little things, and it was just proof of how scared he was, but actually it helped him feel more confident – because he believed Tony wouldn’t stop until they had the cure. He wouldn’t let anything get in the way, and neither would Péter.
The world was tilting dangerously, his ears filled with the sound of shouts and the popping of gunfire.
“Tonight,” Bucky answered throwing the shredded pieces of the letter into the waste bin. “Where else but the ball?”
, but then I realized that even if he answered me, that there wasn’t anything for James to come back to.” When she answered her voice was low and poignant with meaning, her gaze locked on where her feet stepped in the snow. “Father can never be that boy he saved again, and the little girl who needed a hero is gone now too. I can’t bring her back.”
"But you still doubt that I would take care of you," he stated as a matter of fact and Tony huffed a self-depreciating little laugh.
They traveled father over the water than Steve would have liked. Stark had worked up a sweat rowing three of them so far all by himself but he’d shook his head when Steve had offered to take his place. No sense in both of them getting sweaty he'd said. But his eyes which had flickered over Sara - who was slapping the arm Steve had around her waist happily - were rather telling.
“It’s real hope Stefen!” Tony insisted, beginning to lose patience. It was clear that Stefen was dismissing the idea, without even really considering it. “Certainly, more than he’ll find in the damn Reich. They’re going to break him. You can’t just –”
.” Natacha said, her eyes narrowing on the mannequins that lined glass windows as their carriage pulled up alongside the little boutique. She spoke with such vehemence that Steve doubted the universe had any choice but to comply.
“Time for bed” he announced to several groans of protests. In Tony’s arms Maria just blinked with a tired yawn, watching to see what events might play out and he smiled, standing with some difficulty.
Rabbi Benaiello’s chapter was responsible for all of Pola and reported to the office in Triestie. Tony’s aunt, uncle and cousins were kept very busy. Along with setting up temporary clinics, shelters, and schools for emigrants and their children, the delegation had the rather daunting task of counting and documenting all of the Jews residing within the city and organizing their departure to foreign lands willing to take them.
“Your family arrived but a moment ago. They’ve been escorted up to your suite. As requested you’ve been given the Presidential with a connecting room. Also, a message was left for you from Oxford. Will you be needing to make any travel arrangements?” the smartly dressed concierge inquired as he handed Steve a small thick card with writing on it.
Tony may have asked it, or maybe Steve just asked himself. Maybe Tony was in the middle of cursing his name, Steve didn’t know. He saw his mouth moving but he couldn’t hear anything over the roaring in his ears. That pressure inside kept swelling. The dark tangled web of emotion growing larger and larger within his chest, constricting his lungs and making it harder and harder to breathe.
It became almost immediately apparent that Catherine Bonnaire was no ordinary foot soldier. The car she had waiting for them outside of the church was military-grade, and brand new by the looks of that paint. A two bencher, with tires that looked like they could handle just about any terrain, she was a thing of beauty. Laffly S15R, Tony filed the inscription on the front bumper away as his eyes roved over the beautiful machine.
They were mostly correspondence between Stefen and the professor Xavier, about the disappearance of a mutual friend and German research into superior genetics. Some sort of rescue attempt was underway, but the letters were scarce on details. They were being careful.
The Führer was blaming the Jews for the riot and commending the boys in the HJ for their quick response. The best among the troops were going to be roped into the Streifendenst as a reward. Ian chanced a glance down the line until he spotted Harry Osborne, staring hard at the black armband that the older boy now wore as part of his uniform, declaring him a member of the HJ patrol force. The new official first step on the ladder of SS.
"He didn't even ask, he just killed him Tony! And he's going to cook him!" Maria sniffled into Tony's neck, glaring balefully in Bucky's direction. The man had a pair of mountain hares slung over one shoulder, but he at least had the sense to hang back until Tony had carried the girl away from the fire before he began the process of skinning them.
He’d followed the men who had pursued Steve away from the crash, fearing with every step that Steve would be shot before Bucky could catch up to them, or recaptured and bound toward Berlin at a pace too quick for Bucky to follow. But Steve, lucky bastard that he was, kept to the thickest parts of the wood avoiding their bullets, eventually forcing his pursuers to abandon their vehicles altogether.
Steve’s heart pounded in his chest cataloguing the numerous places someone could hide in those shadows. He tugged the cap he wore lower on his head and proceeded, keeping alert for even the slightest change in his surroundings. Nothing did, and he made it to the door unaccosted. He knocked twice before he heard the sound of slow footsteps approaching the door.
” Tony beckoned, mouth turning a grave line as Artur reluctantly left his prize and came to stand before him.
"Apologies, Herr doctor, but my orders are to provide the cardinal an audience with the chaplain. I was told he is here." Wolfe replied and the head doctor bristled up.
That afternoon he’d decided to take Pepper’s strong hints about indulging in a hot bath and had been headed to the kitchen to put the kettle on when he’d passed the sitting room and stopped in surprise when he found it occupied.
After a long sip of his drink Stanislov lowered his glass, holding it in his lap and considering Tony with leisure.
He saw Stark move inside the car, yammering with that big mouth of his, and for half a second Bucky entertained the thought that things might go off without a hitch. He should have known better really. The brass didn’t seem to like whatever Stark was suggesting because that look of suspicion turned to one of deeply set hostility as the soldier barked something back at Stark and reached for his radio.
“Like what?” Stefen asked curiously and from where she was trailing along beside Natacha Sara began to sing, effectively ending the debate.
The girls were being given a bath by Julia or one of the other maids and with all the passion of a sibling abandoned Artur had hurled himself at Steve and had barely paused for breath since.
Churches could be great friends to exiled kings and other men grasping for political power. Their walls kept public eyes out and whispers in.
“Unfortunately, this is not the half of it. Carlo says a man came by the office. He was asking about you cousin.” Beside him Tony tensed, and Steve’s head snapped up.
“I know what I have to do Bucky,” he assured his friend, laying a firm hand on his shoulder. He was grateful for Bucky, even if his honesty sometimes came with its own kind of pain, he’d always rather hear the truth from him than not.
“And a plate of Vati’s schnitzel. I know what you like James.” Leaning close to his ear while she plucked the menu out of his hand, the curve of one breast brushing against his shoulder, she said on a low breath, “And I’m just fine with it.”
Since the children had to leave their winter coats behind during their escape, Tony and Natacha had done their best to engineer warm coverings for any outdoor excursions. A bit of deconstructed burlap made for great thread. The old wool blankets with a bit of fur made good material for thick vests and arm and leg coverings. Artur had taken a sort of fiendish delight in the primitive garments, declaring that they had become Vikings.
Everything had a flinty quality to it, like the sun was too bright, his pupil s unable to dilate and accommodate. He licked his lips and nodded “Yes, I am a gypsy and so was your Baka."
“When Stefen, have you ever done anything you disagreed with without digging your heels in?” Charlotte scoffed with disgust of her own. “You’re a soldier, obeying is what you’re meant to do!” She hissed the words, the fire in her voice laced with bitterness.
“For dogs. And possibly cats” Tony refuted and they stared at one another, the Captain's fingers slowly twisting the whistle again. The way his fingers turned over the silver piece, it might as well have been a knife.
No, the kind of salacious frivolity that fed the underbelly of society and had once thrived so brightly in the kabarett halls that Hitler had scourged when he came to power, had surely never touched Stefen and Margrit Rogers and their cozy little home in the country.
Steve sat quietly listening as Sam unwrapped his childhood. Most of the time he seemed aware that Steve was listening, other times Steve might as well have been part of the scenery.
“Major, you forget yourself.” He heard Göring’s immediate reprimand, but Steve didn’t take his eyes off of Vonkov long enough to gage the mood of their host. Göring wasn’t the threat here, Vonkov was. He wanted to hurt Tony and Steve wasn’t going to let him.
A wrong inhale of breath reminded him it might be more than a week. If Schmidt felt his message hadn't gotten across Steve might very well be gone for much longer as it would take longer to be rid of the letter safely. But no, the General’s reach had not yet extended as far as snatching people off the streets.
But Bucky, still chaffing from the conversation of the night before, froze, his face thunderous for a moment as he narrowed his eyes in warning, but Steve carried on.
The man swiped at the air again, accelerating the automobile forward. This time Steve could hear the strained call from inside. “Move, get out of the way –”
Amidst the usual signage for 'no service for jews' and a couple of posters of bright smiling homemakers declaring that a happy home was one with a woman at home, was a wanted poster. It wasn't the pictures that caught his eye at first. No, he was nearly about to X out the images when the words: WANTED GYPSIES jumped out at him.
Releasing his frustration in a mostly silent huff of breath Tony shifted in his chair to ease the soreness in his back and wondered not for the first time in as many minutes, when they could get the hell out of there and back to their rented home. The only good news was that Bucky had plans to be away for the night (if the way he was staring down the dress on that brunette woman who’d been clinging on his arm all night was any indication) and Tony could steal his single room.
The trouble with Schmidt was his love of grandstanding. Instead of killing his enemy swiftly, he craved the opportunity to make an example out of anyone who dared shed any doubt on his power. He and the Führer were too alike in that way, feeding into each other’s fears and neurosis. There was a damn photographer with them when they arrived at the camp, and a group of prisoners playing wind instruments of all things as Rogers was led out surrounded by soldiers on all sides.
Access to everything. Everything. Tony didn’t pretend to misunderstand him as his eyes raked over Stefen's form.
“Mean what?” Steve asked distractedly, not even looking up, as he flipped through the file in his hands.
"Erskine is who he trusts, so Erskine is who I'm gonna fetch Charlotte." Bucky shot back, he paused momentarily in the door because he felt like a cad for snapping. He wasn't the only one who cared about Steve. Sometimes it was hard to remember because he'd been doing it longest.
(gypsy) that seemed to be their worst offense. After all, a little petty theft and a public brawl was just a wild night down at the pub for one man and a criminal offense for another.
A helpful little voice that sounded an awful lot like brother Fil whispered that it would look like a one-way ticket to a prison cell, if he were lucky. But Stefen wasn’t pulling away or showing any signs of uncertainty. He’d just asked Tony to go to Germany, simply because he’d enjoy the company.
Not the so-called femininity (hang it) but the freedom of it. The freedom of not having to fight for every scrap of food or bit of comfort. The freedom of not having to fight at all, left alone to love and be loved.
There was a knock at the door and a moment later it opened, the platoons only decent lieutenant stepping inside. Second Lieutenant Becker saluted limply, barley in the door and already trailing dirt behind him. Rogers had been working the men on the training field again, poor bastard.
Dvořák sighed and stood, saluting Ssgt. Zimmerman as he did so and holding out his hand for one of the trays.
Khalmmer stepped suddenly away from his back and headed towards the bar. Steve shifted until his back was no longer vulnerable and followed the man’s every movement with his eyes. He watched as Khalmmer poured a healthy amount of schnapps into a glass and then dropped five chips of ice from the tin jar next to the decanter into the glass with a clink. The sound echoed loudly in the silent room.
“He cursed himself, marrying Peggy. He goes and splits himself in half for Peg, cuss he loves her, and buries the other half, the stupid punk. I told him ya know? Warned him. What good comes from killing yourself for love? You’re just...dead. Poof, no one, you just...” he mimed hanging himself and Charlotte made a low sound of disgust, averting her gaze. Bucky pressed on, uncaring.
But it wasn’t right leaving Natacha alone to take care of the others. She’d told him it was a good thing he was going, but she was just being brave about it. He could tell she didn’t really want him to.
To their captain's credit he didn't pause to question the lieutenant before he was blowing on his own whistle, gesturing for the men to follow as he waved and hollered in a vain attempt to get the conductors attention and halt the train. Unfortunately, it was too late to stop the locomotive, and the sound of its roaring engine and squealing wheels drowned out everything else as it began to pull away.
Because Stefen was looking at him again, like he really cared about the answer (like knowing Tony was something worth doing) and he’d already come to terms with how weak he was when it came to that look.
“When do they play?” Tony asked again and Captain Rogers blinked at him mulling it over like he’d never heard the words before.
“Rogue is stationed at the weapons factory and has been of great assistance to me. I trust her with my life. She’ll be your eyes and ears and assist you with getting in and out of the barracks.” Vis explained. The girl nodded in agreement adding quietly, “at half day on Saturday, workers start their leave time. Many of them go to church or go home to see their families.  There’s a trolley that picks us up and drops us off at the factory in the city. “
“I thought I heard a cry. I was just checking on the Major.” Jürgen explained with what he hoped was an easy smile. Bakhuizen did not return it.
When the boy didn’t speak Tony turned his head, laboring for breath to demand of James who had rushed to the boy’s side when Tony had dumped him into the grass “What the
Stefen was very good at keeping his expression unreadable but watching as closely as he was, Tony thought he knew what the tightening of his shoulders meant.
“Father.” He was almost glad when James, who had sat up in his sleeping bag to stare intently at his father, who finally broke gaze with Bakhuizen and grunted in acknowledgment.
"Papers?" Péter blinked guilelessly at the officer as if the concept were new before smacking himself lightly on the forehead and digging around in his pockets for his identification. Anamarie handed hers over silently and watched Péter as he pretended to struggle to find his. "Oh yes of course.  Here you go."
A sane man knowing that Werner had just come from an interview with someone who had likely ratted him out as a rebel, and that Werner was directly tied to the authorities, would have kept his head down.
"Willamina isn't going to remember her own name in the morning, and if we’re lucky neither will we”, he reassured her with a wink as he pulled her close. She grabbed the hem of her dull blue skirts and nervously followed his lead, gaining confidence with each step.
He sought after it, his feet carrying him unconsciously forward as he hunted it out under the layers of sound in the market square. How far he had gone from the camp this time. He should go home. Ma would worry.
There was a little gold leaf sticking out of James’ hair, guilty expressions on all of their faces, and Steve did not see Natacha with them.
Tony cracked one eye open to peer across the little round table and found Herr Bakhuizen sneering at him but Tony didn’t rise to the bait. Bakhuizen could shove his head up his ass and walk backwards with two hail Marys for good measure, for all that Tony cared. Good coffee should be appreciated.
“While I'm gone I’ll require you to send me a daily update on the children either by mail or phone. I’ll need to know of all their comings and goings and the progress of their lessons. The more detailed, the better. Is that understood Herr Stark?”
“We’ll have Maria send our reply to SIS and alert them to our early departure. Until then it’s best we stay here out of sight. If Stanislov decides to spring his trap sooner – ”
“If you don’t shut your traps I’ll snap em shut for ya.” Bucky snarled unexpectedly from their spot by the window, heat lacing his voice. Steve eyed him, but Bucky had already gone back to his watch. He wasn’t sure how he felt about Bucky knowing what he’d been up to. He’d spent so long trying to hide his unclean thoughts from his prala, that it was a hard habit to break.
The party was starting, and Charlotte had already corralled father down into the hall to greet their guests. But James was pretending he didn't know how to get dressed on his own again, Sara refused to let Tony put her down and Maria had found a hole to hide in somewhere that Artur refused to tell anyone. Charlotte seemed very annoyed that Ian and his siblings weren't ready yet, even though she’d kept smiling at them when she asked Ian and his older siblings to be dears and help get the little ones together.
The show had nearly been canceled altogether, after another local man had been murdered. There was a strict curfew in effect, but people were so keen on it that the show had been pushed up, and curfew extended an hour to accommodate the performance. Tony was uncertain how Natacha would react to his plans, so he elected to just surprise her. He taught music that afternoon, but not her section. He made sure to wrap up early in order to make his way to the Rivera district to catch her on her way out of class. The children had mathematics that afternoon with Professor Golding, who was teaching out of a donated conference room at the hotel.
“Maria will cry!” The boy insisted heatedly, balling his tiny fists like he was about to sock the person responsible. “And I don’t want to miss anybody!”
Agent Neuman perked up, the gleeful light of interest flashing in his eyes as he turned to the captain with a triumphant smile.
Natacha watched their captive butterfly almost the entire time she spoke, but at the very end she raised sharp blue eyes to his and pinned him with such a stare that Tony could not doubt for an instant what she meant by it. It was suddenly hard to swallow, the air feeling so constricted that Tony might as well have traded places with the damned butterfly; but he took a breath and met that stare because he’d be damned if he showed her fear.
“And what about me? Will your wife have any say in how you wreck yourself? You asked me to help you, and I’m trying-”
He clenched his jaw, suddenly irritated with himself and unfolded his napkin, snapping it with more force than was strictly necessary.
That practice had served him well after the Great War, through the Austrian Civil war that had followed, and on past losing his wife.
“You can do this. It’s not different than Péter’s birthday.” Tony whispered encouragingly, and Steve gave him a very unimpressed look.
! You asked me to protect them but nothing is going to protect them from the damage these walls will cause if you keep them locked up. They are
Tony'd warned them, hating the fearful way James and Artur had looked at each other and the way that Maria's lip began to tremble. He’d made them promise to never leave the cabin without his permission and had promised to take them out with him in equal turns.
Jerold Mueller had appeared at his side, matching his steps with Steve’s but his head nodded back toward the older children.  He was talking about that blond boy, Steve realized.
Steve screamed inside his head. The words pinged around his skull like sharp darts, but for all their sharpness they could not penetrate the barrier between his brain and his mouth. His mind was just filling up with water, the thoughts sloshing about up there as the world threatened to wash him away.
Hammer gave him a disdainful look and refused to meet his eye, but that was just fine with Tony. The less he had to do with the much too uppity butler the better. A shame that, he’d known some fantastic butlers in his day. Hammer should be fired simply for giving butlers everywhere a bad name.
The train ride was not at all like the one they'd taken on their trip to Vienna. It was stuffy and hot within the carriage car and the seats were not padded. James and his siblings had claimed an open booth in the very back of the car but they'd quickly found themselves crammed in like sardines as the other children flooded in behind them. There was so much sniffling and shuffling all around them. A little girl that he couldn’t see a few booths up kept crying for her mother and she wouldn’t stop.
The sun had come out again for the third day in a row. The snow had melted off the trees and become a thin layer of slush on the ground. There was a sweetness to the crisp air now with every breath, the breeze bringing that subtle hint of growing things. Winter was giving steadily away to the advance of spring, and with its retreat the mountain was coming to life around them.
have them. Tony was clever and he would continue to outmaneuver them all. That was what they’d all agreed on. Tony and Bucky would keep the children safe and Steve would stay the hell alive, long enough to see them again.
“Thor, and I’ll hear no more of it.” Thor brought up a hand to halt the protest on Steve’s lips. “And you and your lovely companion must sit with us at dinner. I would hear more of your service.”
He watched Bucky’s progress down the hall and waited for the door to close and the light to go out, before he opened his door. There was always the possibility that Bucky, knowing Steve, had just turned out the light and continued drinking in the dark, but he was a grown man. He could choose his own mistakes.
Steve looked up when he heard the sound of feet on the stairwell, though he knew the sound of Bucky’s tread well enough that he didn’t bother to lift his weapon. He kept his finger resting close to the trigger, but that was just par for the course.
“Good catch James. Can you tell what kind it is?” Tony asked and James grinned up at him proudly, clutching the jar.
Tony stood there, too shocked to do anything else. Bucky jerked as if someone had jabbed him with a fork, his expression stricken. He snapped something sharply in the gypsy tongue and Stefen pulled away, but his eyes stayed locked with Tony’s for a moment that seemed to linger for a lifetime in Tony’s mind.
Stefen turning out to be not much of a Nazi was all well and good, but deviant was still deviant. You didn’t have to agree with the Reich to despise that sort of thing. There were others in the world out there who shared his perversions but to hope that a man like Captain Rogers was one of them was laughable. <I>Captain Rogers</i>, lion of Austria, a pillow biter? Tony didn't know when he'd gotten so pathetically desperate.
“I shouldn’t have come.” He snapped, turning suddenly to go and Tony’s heart twisted painfully in his chest.
Meanwhile, Maria had knelt down to pull up the corner of the dingy rug that covered the stone floor, pulling it back to reveal an old cellar door. Steve’s heart jumped into his throat. Without prompting he threw the latch and grabbed ahold of the heavy iron ring to swing the cellar door open.
Bakhuizen snorted as if he found something funny about that. Tony watched the captain, both of them aware of the sharp inhale of breath coming from James, as if he’d forgotten how to breathe.
“Well it’s all I know how to make so it’s all we have. Eat up.” Tony reprimanded him. “Why can’t the cook come back?” James continued to whine, poking petulantly at the gray mush in his bowl.
“As you know I'm leaving for Vienna in the morning,” he reminded the man and Stark nodded, his eyes flicking behind Steve, most likely to Frau Hogan.
She led them all the way downstairs, past the ballroom and into the back near the kitchens. As they approached the kitchen doors Péter thought he heard movement from within, the shuffling of feet and the sound of whispered voices.
He nearly jumped out of his skin when Bucky slammed his hand against the wheel, cursing, “Damn it, Stark!”
A door opened, and a second pair of boots confidently thudded against the pavement and then the back door was lifted, light from the street lamps spilling in revealing Lt. Becker standing at the mouth of the door. He gestured sharply for the men to begin unloading and they snapped to work, with the single-minded routine of a squad, ignoring the presence of the policeman. Steve jumped out with the others, doing his best to stay lost in the group while keeping an eye pinned on the policeman who was on his radio, no doubt validating their story with his superiors.
Steve had seen the reports. Talked to other officers. He'd heard about the injuries that sent one and every five boys home to their parents with broken spirits to go with their broken bodies. He'd heard of deaths, quieted and swept under the rug.
Tony raised a brow, not sure if Ian was capable of playing at innocence or if his usual forthrightness could be relied upon. Judging by the rolled up trousers ungracefully hidden under his night stand (one wet leg poking out, rolled and wet where the knees might be, as if someone had tried to rub out dirt stains and then hide them) Tony was willing to hedge a guess on it being the former.
Brother Simone arranged for a village man with a truck to give him and Bruce a ride to the train station and he arrived bright and early on a crisp morning in early December.  Restless and eager to return home, Tony was out of bed, shaved and dressed in the oversized travel clothes the Brothers had scrounged up for him in record time, to meet Bruce and their escort in the drive and gratefully accept the flask of schnapps Brother Simone foisted on them, wishing them good health and safe travels.
There was a brief pause and then a moment where Tony could hear shuffling coming from behind the closed door. He thought he heard the scrape of a drawer opening and then closing before soft footfalls.
The slate closed again, this time with finality and Steve staggered away from the abbey door. He didn’t make it very far before his legs gave out, and he landed hard on his ass in the snow.
Janneke squeezed his arm companionably and laughed away the cloud of tension that had settled over them both.
“The truth? I’ve given it to you. Yes, alright. I was asked to spy on you and I did for a while." Tony’s laugh was humorless. He waved his hand expressively as he spoke. "But I stopped reporting anything of real value early on. Disgustingly early on. Anything I put in my letters to Farkas was about as useless as the reporting I did for you, and I’ll tell you Farkas was far less amused than you were."
Tony shivered. He knew somehow, that Wanda and Pietro were the subjects he was talking about. The ones who had survived whatever Frankenstein experiment the Nazis had subjected them to, who had done things that made them believe that men could become something more than human.
“I entered the children into the winter music festival.” He answered, because he wasn’t about to give away his true thoughts.
They were gone in a whiff of sweet perfume and musky cologne, just a single part of one of the many people walking off their dinners on their way to the evening’s entertainment.
"They're here," Harrison confirmed once Bahkuizen had looked up from the map he and the others had been arguing over for the last hour.
Irritation simmered low in his gut, a feeling that he realized had been growing since the night of their arrival. His fingers twitched with restless energy. He longed for something to do with his hands besides curl them into fists he was tempted to throw at the falsely smiling man at Charlotte Schrader’s side.
“Are you suggesting a traitor ought to be kept from justice because you want to study his bowels? Pick another subject Herr Doctor!”
Stefen held the banner within his hands, red fabric spilling over his arm and onto the floor as he stared at the black lines of the swastika dispassionately, as if he’d picked up one of Artur’s toys to wonder what chest it might go in.
“Are you alright?” the man asked, only he asked it in a way that implied he’d already come to the conclusion that there must be something wrong with Tony’s head.
Steve waved him away, stepping back and putting some much needed distance between them, afraid he might do something he’d regret. His skin was practically crawling off him as he struggled to rein his temper back in.
Péter, he knew, was still blaming himself for telling Harry of their plans – and yes, Tony couldn’t say he hadn’t had his moments of wanting to lay blame at his feet. But what good would it do? Péter was still so young. He still believed in the inherent goodness of others. He’d believed, wrongly, that his friendship with Harry Osborne was impenetrable to betrayal.
of them. She hardly knew what they would do with themselves most the evening and did not fancy playing nursemaid when the younger ones undoubtedly got tired and cranky, and did not relish ending their evening together early to cater to children’s bedtimes.
Péter was nearly sure he knew the answer - it was the old man - but knowing it had his stomach seized in knots.
Péter had declined to go on the outing into town to everyone’s surprise but Tony’s, choosing to hide in his room until Tony could excuse himself from the stifling interview with Frauline Werner.
She’d never be a mother herself, she realized as she ground the pestle against the mortar, the sweet scent of crushed almonds filling her nose. She wouldn’t live that long. Her father’s health was precarious and even if he made it to a full recovery, he was changed now. He wouldn’t pretend, and he was too weak to fight, so the only choice left was running; but it was already too late for that. He’d never admit it aloud to them, but their window for escape was fraught with peril and every day that passed that window just got smaller and smaller. They had to leave as soon as possible but Father was too weak to travel and that was her fault.
Tony could see the slow dawning of awe as Rogers realized that Tony was talking about him followed by a sort of wonder filled bewilderment as if he couldn’t comprehend himself as a hero to anyone, especially a young boy grappling with the harsh realities of war and the terrible loss of his parents.
The senior SS officer turned as Steve entered. Someone had set out refreshments for their illustrious guest: stout, Tilsit cheese, black bread and the good coffee. Or so he was told, Steve never touched it, preferring to partake in whatever the NCO’s drank. Schmidt had a glass of stout next to him on the desk half full of the amber liquid, though to Steve’s eyes it was clear Schmidt hadn't touched it.
Dvorak stared at her for a moment, replaying her words over in his mind. Rogers wasn’t allergic to morphine. But only someone who had served with him or someone who had looked at his medical file would know that with certainty, and it was increasingly apparent that Fischer had done neither.
Steve jerked and blinked at Bucky as if his words had taken him by surprise, and that only made Bucky more worried. He was scared, he realized.
Tony had a hand rubbing at his throat, soothing, helping him swallow. Steve fought to keep his eyes open – he had to see, had to know if it was real - but his eyelids might as well have been weighed down with stones. He closed his eyes and let the darkness take him once more.
And that was exactly it wasn’t it? Because Charlotte and the gossipy ladies of her social circle couldn’t know the full extent of it. How could they without the full picture?
Péter could not explain it, but a foreboding prickle went down his spine as Wanda turned away from them both, and got to her feet, not bothering to brush the dirt off her skirts as she began to walk back towards the house.
“Peter. Let your father and I worry about your siblings.” Tony gently squeezed his arm, drawing Peter out of his thoughts. His smile was small but encouraging as he continued softly in the quiet of the car, “You’re not wrong. You are blessed in a way that many others aren’t. But that’s a privilege Peter and not a character flaw. It’s enough that you know and don’t take it for granted.”
“You did?” Stefen asked slowly, face deceptively blank. Tony could read the mounting anger in every stiff line of his body.
"What's the matter?" Péter asked warily, pausing with the rope when he noticed the odd stillness that had taken over Tony. "Do you hear something?"
Steve watched as the monk broke off a piece of bread and dipped it in his soup. Tiny flecks pooled on his plate slowly edging toward the table cloth.
3. Remember how I mentioned we couldn't talk about this without talking about Natasha? While Peggy's life and influence is most talked about in Steve's memories of her, it's also something we wanted you to be able to observe in her family, whether the characters appear to consciously realize it or not. And the character this is most obvious in is her oldest daughter. Not because Peter can't be a lot like his mother (because he is) but because we felt it was important to Natasha's character arch and overall journey. One of the first things we had to consider when we decided to make Natasha one of the children was just who Natasha is.
“I suppose,” Péter grumbled, face setting with disappointment and Tony clapped a consoling hand upon his shoulder.
Bucky's befuddled expressions and subsequent blink of shock was almost comical.  But Tony ignored it in favor of imploring Stefen, whose mouth was twitching now in amusement, "But I can build you a boat. The river Danube runs close to Dachau, doesn't it?"
“We've promised our aide to several suffering families. How are we to see to them if this is allowed to continue?” Tiberius demanded full of rancor and Nik held up a hand, commanding the young monk to silence.
“Shut. Up.” Steve murmured in reply. He didn’t look over at the couch. Couldn’t bear to find it empty. Couldn’t stomach to see it occupied. “Shut up and stay alive.”
"He's the only one who can –" she began just as Baroness Schrader's voice began to drift up the stairs, calling the girls name, and she rushed to finish, “- fix vati. He’s the only one!”
"Yes, Tony and uncle Bucky are looking after him now. They asked me to make soup," he replied jerking his head toward the pot on the stove.
“Te aves yertime mander tai te yertil tut o Del.” Bucky murmured, circling the cooling body once in the old way before hitching his pack more comfortably on his back and turning toward the trail left by Steve and his pursuers.
The woman was a force to be reckoned with, a solider in her own right. The war had not spoiled her as it had them. She’d been so full of all the things Steve had forgotten laughter, love, and music, that it had not surprised Bucky in the least when Steve had lost his heart to her.
play?” Tony asked, but the captain didn’t seem to believe in moving or holding up conversation (ever) so Tony charged on. “I used to play.
He was shaking his head and chuckling, the sound lazy and warm as he fell back into his seat. His arm pressed against Steve’s doing something to sooth the buzz of irritation in Steve’s skull.
Herr Klein ran a small masonry business that serviced mainly the local villages and a few larger contracts within the city. He and his family had immigrated from Poland when he was a young boy, but they’d lived in Salzburg for most his life. They’d been friends and neighbors of the Rogers family ever since Stefen had employed him to help build the villa. Tony had yet to meet him, but Pepper assured him he wouldn’t find better company or better-quality work.
was so many beautiful things, but not all things beautiful. It was the discrimination and subjugation of Slavic peoples. The fight for and colonization of land in the name of nationalism. But
Bucky smacked his cheek and thankfully the urge disappeared and that strange overwhelming hunger for touch he’d felt coiled back up into his chest.
“To plan my lesson for the day. I think the children could use a brush up on the history of Bohemia and Moravia” he tossed irritably over his shoulder as he exited the cramped feeling kitchen.
“Captain, don’t you think you’re overreacting over a skirt?” Tony asked, frowning and Steve clenched his fists, shaking with fury and indecision. It wasn’t about the damn skit. She was up to something. Wasn’t she? He knew his own daughter! Except for when he didn’t. Except for when his mind played tricks on him and he mistook total strangers. What if he was wrong?
Steve flew down the stairs toward the staff kitchens heart, sinking when he pushed the door open only to discover an empty room. It was mostly untouched here save for the ankle-deep water and ransacked cupboards. He didn’t think this was the work of the worst of the mob. The city’s poor and starving were out in full force, taking advantage of the chaos to find food for themselves and their families.
“Did Father tell you that they’re making me a group leader?” She asked, after a long moment of quiet and Bucky tensed, throat going tight.
Lt. Steven's chest swelled with pride, though he stayed silent as his captain glared the agent down. The tense silence was finally broken by a rapid knock on the door.
“Do you have medical power?” Ian dared to asked, and when they both turned to look at him questioningly, he hastily following up with, “I heard my mother mention it. She was telling da, if only we had some, my brother might get better.”
“Natacha...” he tried to warn as the train finished rolling to a stop with a painful shrieking of wheels and he flinched.
“Truthfully?” Grig paused with a sympathetic grimace. “I don’t know that he does. He needs someone to blame and they are an easy target.”
“What is that? What’s going on?!” Tony demanded, clutching dramatically at his chest like a frightened woman grasping her pearls as the Warden twisted sharply to get a look out the window and cursed.
Of course, her parents would be cold to them, but if luck stayed on her side it would be out of their hands before they even realized what she was up to.
Tony's mouth tightened but he kept silent on that particular subject because he knew the battle would not be won with words. Not with how heavily emphasized a woman's role was in the BDM. Natacha was too smart not to know the consequences of rebellion. Maria on the other hand was still just five and still primarily concerned with dreams. Tony wouldn't have had it any other way.
“Yes. He is cruel to us. That day, on his way in the pub he struck a boy who had set up outside and refused to move. The boy was so small, I tried to stop him, and he struck me too.”
Tony followed Bruce’s notes on how to administer the binding agent to the letter. Rapid doses the first day, and then tapering off the next. There was no way to tell besides testing Stefen’s blood to know whether or not the solution was working. Stefen’s temperature still spiked off and on, his lungs were still weak and full of fluid, and he still could not keep much food or water down. It was a good sign that he was urinating more, as hopefully it meant the solution had properly bound to the ions in the metal in his blood and his body was getting rid of it all.
He winked cheekily in Tony’s direction and Tony found himself laughing, relieved that for the moment Natacha seemed to accept this answer as part of Clinton’s overall strangeness. He’d never been happier that Clinton was such a queer little imp. Given that Natacha had discovered them and seemed content to watch their every move the boy was invited inside and forced to play out the charade of paying Tony a visit, right on time for afternoon coffee.
Her intentions clear, relief and reluctant admiration trickled through him as he took the slip Susann handed him with a grim nod. He’d known there was a reason he’d always liked her.
The night wore on, and Steve did his best in it to keep a hold of himself, but it was hard not to feel marooned in the sea of guests all decked in their very best attire, rich browns and subtle green. While the women were all in tasteful but expensive clothes, nearly all the men were in some uniform or other. Shades of glittering black and silver, splashes of red on their arms. All swirling around room like a pack of flies.
Tony looked at Grig and said nothing. The other man’s expression remained affable, no hint of displeasure or suspicion about it. Tony relaxed a fraction, unable to do so completely because he did not know Grig or his expressions half as well as he’d like. They had not been allowed to grow up together as they should have. Hughard Stark had made sure of that, but it looked as if Tony’s efforts to embarrass his father and shame the name of Stark had not been half as effective as he’d hoped they’d be. He was under no illusions as to what his cousin’s reaction would have been, had Grig suspicions of his proclivities.
Tony swallowed tightly, gathering breath to speak.  He meant to say thank you. Thank you for making me peel potatoes and clean up sick. Thank you for teaching me how to dress wounds and for arguing with me about the virtues of natural medicine. Thank you for sitting up with a crying child in the dark when no one else would and thank you for not ignoring me and treating me like I was hopeless. Thank you for whatever made that gun jam after you lost your patient, because even if you couldn’t save her you saved me.
"We've got the uniforms as well, though you'll have to do your best with sizing." The young woman Vis had brought announced, setting her basket down at his feet and Bucky knelt down to lift up the top of the basket and examine the shirts and bands inside, before looking the woman up and down.
“My superiors have sent me, as German law mandates Abraham Erskine is no longer suited for practice. He may even be responsible for the Major’s current condition. The Führer is most concerned. I’m sure you are as well. Erskine is being held for questioning.” Fischer was explaining to the woman and Dvorak’s eyebrows inched upwards in surprise. Erskine? Rogers had kept a Jewish doctor on as the family physician. Was he mad?
"Baroness Schrader is a beautiful woman. Spirited." Mueller grunted beside Steve. "She'll be just a good a breeder like your last one. So, will your girl."
“And there you have it Major.” The countess cut him off, pinning Stefen with cold eyes. “Even common men are schooled how to dance.”
“Your father insulted him in his own home!” Péter insisted, though his eyes remained on the small white box in Harry’s hand. He was not the only boy their age to take up the habit but Péter’s father would have his head if he were to even think it.
"Stop pretending you don't understand what I'm trying to tell you. I'm not here to save my own skin, Stefen!" Tony practically shouted at his back, standing abruptly from the piano bench. His hands were twitching as if he wanted to ball them into fists, or slam them against the piano. Steve wished he would, wished Tony would give him any reason to put his hands on him. Anything was better than the wounded expression that Tony was pinning him down with. As if he was the one with any right to be hurt.
"Do you think it's your duty to follow your father into the army?" Tony asked, ignoring the disparaging sound.
A minute or so later his Major jogged up next to him, looking energized and fresh for all the world as if he’d only been having a brisk walk as his eyes continued peeling over their soldiers. Frank snorted, it was fucking unfair was what that was.
“It is no secret that the Führer has promised a return of German peoples to German lands. This started with what was formerly Austria and will continue with others. The Führer expects opposition on the Baltic sea from the French, but the greater threat is Great Britain.”
Tony stared at him, the silence stretching in a long undefinable moment before he leaned back in the creaking chair and opened his arms in mock invitation.
Péter looked up from his kodak to find that his brother James was staring at Cameron who hadn’t moved from where he was curled on the couch by the fireplace under a blanket for some hours now. James’ voice had that whiney quality he always got when he was frustrated.  He must have gotten bored with drawing. Artur who was laying upon the rug with his zoology book spread open in front of him, sat up, ruining the perfectly good shot that Péter was trying to capture of him and he sighed.
It was some stubbornly embedded instinct that kept him weakly twisting and pulling on the manacles around his wrists, long after the skin was raw and bloodied. Even though the armed men who sat guard with him in the back of the truck sneered at his effort.
He desperately moved his legs while trying to maintain his hold on James, struggling to push them closer toward the bank and get his feet under him. James didn’t make it easy in his panic but Tony managed it, relief washing through him when the water became shallow enough for him to stand on his own two feet again.
“Fuck you!” The man coughed and wheezed, the sound warbling as more laughter fought its way out of his chest. Bucky tightened his finger on the trigger and took a threatening step forward and the laughter died.
“Are you cold?” Stefen asked beside him, one hand already reaching to unbutton the jacket he wore. Tony stayed his hand with a shake of his head and a reproachful frown.
of buinokishti. Like the one his mother had been buried in. Like the one his sister would never wear. And in the middle of all that noise, there was Stevie standing there reaching.
“What is ridiculous, is you not eating and sleeping for days on end.” Stefen grunted in reply, grappling to maintain his hold on Tony, and was that amusement Tony heard in his voice? Did he think this was
“Bronze if you have four children. Silver if you have six and gold if you have more than eight.” Natacha recited in a very controlled tone. She was staring out the window at the rain that had not let up, looking very small and girlish still in Steve’s eyes, in her coat and stockings. He didn’t understand how anyone could look at her and see anything but a child.
“H-how...?” Tony asked, looking to Nonna who smiled tearfully at him, but it was Nonno who explained, an arm wrapped around her shoulder.
“Load him up.” Dvorak barked in command and the men complied, the photographer dancing around them filling the air with bright flashes. The clicking of the camera’s shutter was drowned out over the sudden rise of shouts coming from the other side of the fence.
“They put everyone on a truck and took them to the festival hall. They’re being held there.” Stefen filled in. Cameron nodded shakily.
In retrospect he supposed it had been easier to travel without such a difficult child in tow. He should not have to wonder why he was so often left on his own while his parents travelled between their home in Pola and Hughard’s estate in Germany.
Sure, he looked enough like Hughard that no one was going to spot him immediately as a Jew; but Tony had never even tried to deny his Italian heritage. Who wanted to be Aryan anyway?
Well. Bucky grinned as she departed, contemplating an evening that was suddenly looking more interesting by the minute. He was still watching the sway of her hips when Kirk plopped down in the seat across from him, emitting a low chuckle.
Canonically her "self" was something stolen from her and she was molded into a weapon. The Natasha we know now is a product of her breaking free and stitching herself into something of her own making. We definitely wanted to pay honor to that with her character arch: tangled up in a dangerous web of lies, being conditioned by the Nazi machine. It gave us a lot of room to develop some of her canonical trust issues and dubious code of ethics, but more importantly bring gravitas to what is at stake for the whole family. The war changes them all, threatens everything they have and everything they are.
Frau Hogan put a gentile hand on the girl’s head and bent down to speak to her lowly. Now that she was closer and still he could see better that she was very young, not more than five or six years of age. She must be a serving girl, he thought observing her very dark hair. Though he didn’t think they were employed that young, so perhaps she was Frau Hogan’s own child. The father certainly wasn’t German with hair that dark. Perhaps a Sicilian or a Czech tradesmen?
“It’s important, Tony. Klaus Stolz fainted during a march once because he stayed up too late the night before.” Ian told him.
“I’ve had a look at your assets Mr. Stark. There was a bit of pushback from Stanislov but we expected that.”
“Be quiet.” Natacha whispered, briefly lighting the torch she held in her hands just long enough to illuminate her face as she slowly releasing his mouth.  She flicked it off a moment later and plunged the room back into darkness. It was too dark in the room for her to see the glare he threw at her as her dark silhouette moved away from the side of his bed, but Péter wouldn’t put it past Natacha to have discovered some way to see in the dark like a cat. She certainly moved as quietly as one. In the seconds Péter had wasted calming his racing heart she’d already made it to his bedroom door.
“You mean after we stage a coup and hold Germany’s leader as a political prisoner?” Steve cocked his head. “Maybe.”
Margrit Rogers, the one and only. The only person according to...well everyone, that Captain Rogers had ever loved.  And yet, there was no trace of her anywhere save a few trinkets and a pistol because Stefen couldn’t even bear to think of her, let alone say her name.
“No!” Stefen snapped quickly and Tony jumped. Curiously the captain’s neck flushed pink. “I wanted to give you this in private, cause you need to understand. I don’t know if you’ll like it. Please don’t get mad before you let me expl-”
“Yes, I know.” Tony interjected with a tired smile. “The better not to have it tortured out of me if the police come back.”
Tony stood, so fast he toppled the chair he’d been sitting in. It was a small amount over a short period of time, which meant his symptoms had manifested due to chronic exposure. That was – fuck that was still critical, but there had been successful treatments. Case studies with survivors. Too few, but they existed!
“No it’s me, Artur!” the boy laughed at Bucky’s teasing and began to wriggle desperately in Bucky’s arms as Bucky began to mercilessly tickle his side, the boy dangerously tipping back and forth.
“Still, it is a terrible thing for a wife to lose her husband.” Pepper growled through the prick of tears. “Willaminia we’ll have to make something to bring over –”
This year, when they opened their envelopes, they’d find the checks were much heftier than they’d ever been. Peggy’s trust at the State Bank had taken a staggering hit – an occurrence Steve did not expect to go unignored by the heads of the Reich.
Tony yanked out the bits of cloth he’d stuffed in them and pulled down the kerchief protecting his face and grinned at Stefen, adrenaline from the unexpected reunion and the urge to
“They’re not making it public of course, but we expect France to fall to the damned Germans before summer is out.” She was still talking, about important things he realized and Tony rallied himself together to actually listen. “Ground troops have already moved to safer ground. Special Operations is scrambling to plant agents all over France to assist with future sabotage.”
“You say that like you think my teasing is the greater sin.” Tony said, and when Stefen just gave him a frank look Tony laughed, the sound ringing out bright and clear in the sunlit room and his chest full with it.
Steve stared after her. It had only been a brief flash of color, there for a moment and then quickly covered, but Steve knew that he had not imagined seeing the yellow Star of David stitched onto her sleeve.
With their visitors forgotten in the drama and sitting up with Péter and his brothers to do further damage control, it wasn’t until morning that Tony thought of their visitors again.
"Your father isn't a rat Pete. The margin for error here is so wide, it could be considered cruel to even try. Bruce thought it was." Tony replied, holding the young man's gaze to make sure that he understood. He had to know that what they were about to do wasn't even close to proven or safe. But it was the only chance Stefen had. As if he'd heard the thought aloud Péter nodded.
But in any mood, it was nice having Tony around. With him around they made eight instead of seven. Well, not always because Da was home far more than before but still. Peter usually banded with Tacha, Maria and Artur practically came glued together and made a little triangle with Sara. Ian normally got stuck with James who-
“N-nothing. Nowhere. That is, Magda went to the station. Father hired workers from the Labor Force to help with the pre-season. She w-went to fetch them and was delayed coming home. The gestapo know all this, please!”
It was as good as confirmation on both accounts, first Czechoslovakia and then Poland, but Striker was good. Good enough not to say anything too inciteful or politically damaging. Steve gritted his teeth.
His injured arm had been wrapped tightly in fresh medical bandages and no blood looked to be seeping through. He probably needed stiches, but needle and thread hadn't been among their supplies.
“They’re called rom, and they’re good people too.” Ian’s unexpected announcement drew all eyes to him. Freshly turned thirteen, he had acquired that unfortunate pinched look that boys got at that age when their bodies grew too fast. A gangly creature with overgrown hair, he should have looked ridiculous trying to stare down a man five times his age, but no one laughed. The seriousness of his conviction was plain, the pain in each word beyond something someone of his years should even know how to carry. It kept them all hushed.
Breakfast that morning was quiet, which was just as well because Charlotte thought if she opened her mouth she was liable to scream. Instead Charlotte carefully sipped her morning coffee, allowing the rich smelling steam to fill her nose and sooth her senses. Remaining calm and decisive was paramount. There was too much at stake to allow herself to descend into so called feminine hysterics. Her mouth quirked upward in a scathing grin. Charlotte had shared tables with Marianne Hainisch, God rest her soul, and had been an active member in the Austrian Women’s Society from the first day Peggy had lied to their parents and dragged Charlotte to a luncheon a few days after her thirteenth birthday.
“You weren’t slacking, you were helping.” Ian insisted firmly. “I’m sorry James theatrics pulled you away from your work.”
Steve stumbled, the setting sun stinging his eyes as his legs twisted underneath him and threatened to buckle. He fell into the man coming up behind him, his teeth stinging from the jarring collision. Hands pushed against his back shoving him upright and he rebalanced quickly, stepping right back into their steady march.
Tony stared into eyes, black as his own in the dark, and it was tempting to bite out that he’d been hiding for twenty years now, and a little mountain air wasn't going to make him forget.
He knew who Stefen was, the realization dawned as the captain straightened once more. The anger and the anguish that had simmered under his skin only moments before buried under ice, as he turned toward Tony once more with militant professionalism.
“They are to march the grounds every morning for a half hour, breathing deeply. Then quickly to their studies, sciences and maths until noon followed by supper, then German literature, Frau Hogan has a list of approved material, choose whatever you like. History, economy and the rest is to be carried out in the evening.” The long list of instructions finished, the captain slipped his hand into his pocket producing a silver whistle. He slipped it back and forth between his fingers, absently.
To busy his hands, Tony reached for an empty cup and saucer from the tray and ignored the scrutiny of Stefen and his strange friend as they watched him prepare his drink.
Stubborn. That was the man’s problem. Stubborn enough to drive a man to either drink or violence, and at this moment Tony wasn’t sure which one he’d prefer.
The soldiers were the worst, their feet drumming loudly as they marched boldly through the streets, proud as peacocks of their smart uniforms and flashy guns. And Tony walked among them not just a plain clothed monk on his way to assignment but a Jew, unmarked and falsely documented: a lamb hiding amongst the wolves. He put on a smile and a confident swagger because experience had taught him he had no better shield.
“They’re sure to love you as fiercely as the captain does.” Agneta reassured and Charlotte’s lips twisted into a dry little grin.
It was designed like the tower buildings Tony had only heard about in America. Bruce thought the idea of them was gaudy and strange, but Tony understood the appeal and the potential of such a design.
“They were waiting when they got back to the house…” Cameron’s voice was hoarse, as if he’d worn it out screaming though he’d not made a sound before that. “They said all Jewish Poles had to leave Austria.”
Christ. Just thinking it left him breathless, the fear clawing at his throat and the adrenaline spiking through his veins. It was a suicide mission. If this went tits up (oh and there were a hundred different ways) they’d be better off dead than being taken in by the police.
"I don't think Tony's aunt is sick at all." James announced, pausing theatrically until he was sure he'd gained all their attention. "I think he just got sick of us and left, like all our other tutors."
Below deck was cramped, the cabin only just large enough to fit all of them and the five other strangers they found there. There were two young men who might have been brothers who sat close to one another, their heads down as they whispered in the dark. Opposite them was an older woman who sat upon the only bed, her thin hair graying at the roots, holding herself as far apart from the others as their small quarters would allow.  A middle-aged man with a small boy on his lap sat against the bed frame, and Tony caught the way his arms tightened around the boy as the light from Luzzato’s torch shone down on their faces.
The city of Pula (ne:Pola) stretches on and beneath seven lush green hills. It is known for its crystal beaches and abundant flora, including olive trees and wine vinyards.
He was imagining things he berated himself. It was the fear talking. Schmidt couldn't know fully what Steve had planned. Perhaps he thought Steve meant to defect and this would keep the eagle eye on him.
He didn’t have to think about Weiss as he cracked away at gears, the click and clank of metal singing in his ears, or the way the Captain had looked at him with such resignation and sadness, even as Tony had been promising the children that this was not the last they’d see of their beloved gardener. He didn’t have to think on how a man like Samuel became ‘beloved’ to a man like Rogers.
Tony thought about it the entire journey back to the motel, and by thought, he meant stewed. His good mood had soured. Stefen had promised not to keep him in the dark and to allow Tony to help when he could but it was obvious he had not meant it. Had those just been lies, lover’s words to placate him? Was Stefen under the impression that Tony was his
Péter was a child, he kept reminding himself, and like all children his understanding of the world was narrow and self-focused. Licking dry lips Bucky took a deep calming breath and gestured for Péter to come to him. The boy wisely complied without complaint, shoulders hunched and eyes downcast.
Over Bakhuizen’s shoulder Stefan's eyes had turned glassy but the recognition in them was clear as they focused on Tony. If it were possible Stefen stiffened more.
The prayers were as familiar as his own skin but they provided little comfort as he turned the iron key within the lock and pushed the creaking door open. Even if he was wrong and God existed, Tony knew for a fact he was not the sort of fellow God would deem worthy enough to answer. But he was powerless now and so at the mercy of chance as the young officer stepped into the attic, his eyes sweeping critically over the clutter of trunks and old furnishings. Hammer made a sound of disappointment, like air punching out of a tire as he took in the empty room, his eyes darting about franticly before they landed on Tony once more with hot accusation behind them. The man’s thin lips pressed tight.
The words Stefen had uttered felt like a ritual and there was something intensely private about the way that he and Bakhuizen looked at one another when their eyes met.
All except Péter, Steve immediately noticed. He was old enough to keep his own hours but Steve did not like the thought of him making his way home after dark right now. The snow had finally let up, but it was bitterly cold out now that the sun had gone down.
“Natacha Rogers. I’m twelve.” And just to prove she was an obstinate little thing she looked directly at him and drolly told him that the most important fact about herself was that she was a girl. Only a simpleton could look at a young woman like Natacha and see only a girl, but then again Tony was a man of extreme intelligence who had run across more than his fair share of dullards and he was sure she’d grown used to them.
injured or otherwise, weren’t the priority anymore. Steve watched the clock and the trickle of activity on the floor below. From the rail, Steve had a good view of the main hall, including the doors that lead out to the receiving platform.
The night that Stefen had been arrested and the house placed under armed guard Tony had lain on the floor of his room after the children had finally fallen back into exhausted sleep with Pepper in his bed. If the soldier who’d been stationed on the floor thought it was strange behavior, he kept his thoughts to himself and Tony wouldn’t have cared either way. He’d lain there in the dark, his thoughts racing with frantic thoughts and fingers twitching with panicked urges. Harold had sat across from him, back propped up against the door like a guardian gargoyle, and Tony could feel his eyes boring into him. Prompting. Expectant. Waiting for Tony to pop up with some plan. But all he’d been able to think about were the sounds outside the door, as the police and army intelligence combed through the house, collecting the evidence with which to condemn Stefen.
He was about to turn and leave when he caught sight of a small door in the corner. It could be the door to a panty he thought, heart kicking up in his chest, or even a cellar. His heart pounded all the harder as he approached it, breathing harshly as he took the two small steps leading down to it and reached for the knob.
just made that dark pit inside of him open up all the wider. Bucky surged forward, snarling, swinging, trying to pound the pain in his heart into his Steve’s ribs. Steve fell back, grunting in pain and clutching at his side and Bucky was on him in an instant, swinging at him again with a ragged cry.
"Child. Move aside." The officer snapped in a way that made Tony sure that he wouldn't hesitate to use force if the boy did not comply. Tony ran to grab him and pull him back, but Artur resisted, his face screwed up tight with fury, terrified tears brimming in his eyes. He struggled until Stefen took ahold of his shoulders and helped Tony pull him back. The moment he realized the new hands belonged to his father he turned into them, throwing himself into Stefen's waiting arms with a muffled sob and clinging tight.
“That’s a bet you’d lose. But I’m prepared to give you what you really want right now, no struggle.”
It was always crowded in Müttermilch this time of night, and Bucky was happy to see that this evening was no exception. Milch, as the locals called it, wasn’t the only pub house along the river but it was right on the dock and Etta (the mother in mother’s milk) made the best sausage in town, making it a popular choice for the sailors coming in off the Danube.
But Tony couldn’t help but feel a sense of wonder at it, bitter sweet as it was. Over and over again the thought circulated in his mind that Stefen had seen and had done nothing.
“You did what?” He demanded, and the bite in his tone was so strong it took everything she had not to flinch.
Her hand was warm in his, calloused from farm work but supple and nearly as big as Steve’s own. He had a fleeting thought, that if he were to draw their hands clasped together, he might not be able to tell whose was male and whose was female. They were the same.
He didn’t know what stopped him. That was the terrifying thing about it. One moment he was focused on the mission and the next, his vision was hazing and the room tilting around Péter’s face, a voice in his head screaming his child’s name.
“We all have bad in-clin-ations sometimes Vati,” he said, slowly over the unfamiliar word, and Steve wanted to chuckle (because that had Tony written all over it) but Ian had called him daddy, which he had not done in what was dangerously close to half his life now and he was struck by a fierce burning in his eyes and the urge to sob.
Tony’s brow furrowed in confusion. It was true, the country was on the brink of war but he hardly understood what the Rogers children needed protecting from. They were Austrian (German now), wealthy, and as Aryan as it came. He could not help the surge of anger he felt and barely resisted the urge to bite out that the Rogers children were not the ones with something to fear (not the ones slowly watching the value of their lives deplete as the wolves sharpened their knives for the hunt). Frau Hogan must have seen something of his feeling in his eyes because she stepped away from him, something cold between them now.
“Likewise, I’ll be staying at the Kaiserhof for the next few days if you need anything.” Tony replied taking the young woman’s hand and shaking it gently. He released her, and with a fond smile Bethany McCabe turned away and then she was off, rushing to meet the waiting arms of her young man. Tony watched the reunion for a moment with gladness, but the intimacy in their embrace and the sight of their happiness reminded him of his own longing, deepening it until it ached tenderly like a bruise within his chest.
When he and Bucky pulled up to the garage it was to find Stark and the children not in the schoolroom as he’d expected but outside with the garage doors open wide engaged in what at first glance appeared to be some form of carpentry.
The shopkeeper held himself still, just out of sight behind his open window as he watched the woman hurry back the way she’d come, guiding the children and whispering to them as they scurried.
Clenching his fists, Ian turned away from them both in order to hide the tears he was wasn’t successful at biting back. And then a sudden knock came, causing Ian to jerk and wince violently at the unexpected sound.
“They should have killed him,” Steve stated confidently. He’d have killed anyone who hurt one of his children in such a way without an ounce of regret. “What sort of man beats a child until he bleeds?”
Steve shook his head clear, turning quickly around to peer at his daughter once more, noticing now that she was indeed wearing one of the skirts she’d packed for their journey over the mountains, rather than one of the newer ones that had been donated to her by Tony’s aunt. Tony was right about her having outgrown it. Sitting down, it rode up over her knees.
Tony turned to look at Péter, shocked to hear him speak but not at all surprised to find that he was also looking back at the disbanding group of boys, his face expressionless.
“He’s gone Stefen. To look for Péter.” She said when he continued to struggle and Steve froze. Bucky had started the search without him? Well good, he decided a moment later. They’d already lost so many hours, he was glad Bucky hadn’t wasted more because Steve had lost control of himself.
So we've only gotten Tony's first impressions of them here but we'll meet the Rogers children in earnest next chapter. As this story centers as much on the family as it does the war time elements (if not more) each child has been lovingly crafted for it. James Rogers is not James "Bucky" Barnes but James Rogers of the Next Avengers (Earth 555326). Uncle Bucky will be coming along next chapter as well, so if you've been minding the tags and got a bit of a jolt, I wanted to clarify that there is no incest in this story. Peter and Natacha are of course Peter Parker and Natasha Romanov, Ian is Ian Zola of dimension Z, while Maria and Sara are the names of Tony and Steve's mothers. Last but not least Artur is a loving homage to Arto from sara_holmes wonderful fic Counterpart. I demand you run not walk over there and read it if you haven't already.
It was true. Ian had stayed on the bank hovering around his father like a moth to flame as the captain had gone about his work, mostly ignoring the boy’s presence. Only once had Ian ventured away from him to have a look at some interesting rocks that Péter and Artur had dragged up out of the lake.
“She’s family Buck!” Stefen insisted stubbornly. “We’ll move the wedding up. We can send the children ahead, say they’re going to their grandparents while we’re on our honeymoon just as we planned.”
“My oldest son has a heart condition and will be home this school year. I have a private doctor to see to him, so you needn’t concern yourself. I expect him to be, if not ahead of his peers, keeping up with the rest of the school children. There is no exception in this, Herr Stark. Do you understand? They are not to waste their summer away day dreaming. Frau Hogan will give you the paperwork for the new school year.”
"You want us to scrub the floor?" James had gaped incredulously at the buckets and rags as if they were three headed chickens.
Through the window, behind the doctors bent head, Steve could see the garden. Sam was hard at work clearing out the flower beds. Spring had come back to the villa.
Péter found Pietro first, but the other boy was caught up in a game of catch the chicken with Ian and the younger boys. Pietro was the prized chicken giving the other boys the slip.
"Thorson asked to be received in Vienna rather than Berlin and they are accommodating his request. He'll be here long enough that he must be entertained and received with all manner of pomp and circumstance."
It was one of the many things about the goings on in the Rogers household that sparked lingering questions in Tony’s mind, but until Bruce wrote back they were questions that would go unanswered
“Can I really take it, Mama?” the girl, whose name must have been Becca, whispered back and Péter nodded with a smile. Becca took the little soldier from him shyly and mumbled her thanks, tucking it in close to her chest with a grin just as the whistle blew one last time and the ticket collector announced it was the last call for boarders.
The white stones no longer gleamed, and the paint had faded. His mother’s gardens were in disarray, the pathways nearly lost amidst grass and bramble and the hedges overgrown. There were few lights on inside. The windows closed with the drapes pulled tight. For a moment Tony stood at the bottom of the steps staring up at the front doors and let his memory sweep away the dust. Bright summer sun shone down upon his head, vibrant yellow blossoms danced on the branches of cherry shrubs. The scent of polish and baked bread permuted from the windows, opened wide to welcome in the scented breeze.
A woman like her should never have to be alone, Deiter thought as beside him, the baroness shifted again on her seat, the lines around her mouth tightening once more in discomfort.
Haushügel. Tony’s father had bought the estate (including the surrounding groves and the private stretch of beach at the bottom of the limestone cliff upon which the house perched) from a poor Austrian noble who had fallen upon hard times. Pola had been the home of quite a few nobles, and the ideal summer retreat for all the rest during the height of the Austro-Hungarian empire. It had meant a great deal to Hughard - a self-made man born in the waning light of the Prussians and the bright burst of the German industrial empire - to acquire such a feather in his cap.
“I was there, I ate and drank with them, so I know it to be true.” Stefen murmured the words so quietly that Tony doubted anyone but himself and Bakhuizen could have heard him. He frowned, wanting to insist that a story fanciful enough to include dragons could not possibly be true, but he bit his tongue.
“Your broadcasts have been intercepted,” Coulson informed them as Stefen began to nod and a chill came over the room as they all stopped and stared at him.
He’d expected Stefen's office to mirror what little he'd seen of the bedroom: richly furnished but sparsely decorated, bare of the typical assortments and clutter that marked personal spaces.
“You’ll be with me to finish out the tour. Charlotte and I will marry, and then all of you will go to Switzerland.”
As he worked his eyes kept drifting back toward the captain standing aways off with Maria. He seemed to grow more comfortable the longer he held her. One broad hand stroked her back with betraying tenderness as he spoke quietly to her, the words unintelligible from Tony's seat by the fire.
Ian's head whipped back around to meet Tony’s eyes with a startled expression. He blushed a humiliated red, ducking his head and trying to appear as small as possible.
Dr. Fischer turned back to the window, his shoulders hacking slightly. It looked uncomfortable the way his long frame was hunched in the limited space, but he didn’t comment on it as he leaned toward the window, taking in the scenery with a keen eye.
“You’re the runner?”  Tony guessed with a frown of worry. Clinton was still a child, but the Nazis wouldn’t hesitate to harm him.
Begrudgingly Bucky had to give the man credit where credit was due. He’d brought music back to the house after all these years. Not only that, the children were not an easy bunch. And to corral them together and somehow get them to produce a sound like
"You're right, Da would want us to stay alive, but I think there are more ways to die than just one."
The pencil scratched against the paper as the children’s voices floated out through the open balcony doors. Bucky’s violin accompanied their voices in sweet haunting melody as lines filled the blank page of the sketchbook propped open in his lap, as Stefen attempted to capture the intense focus Tony brought to the music lesson (the gentleness of his hands as he straightened backs, placed palms on bellies to guide deep breaths) and the gleam of accomplishment in the children’s eyes with every soaring note.
“I believe we’re finished here, doctor?” he asked, and Fischer nodded shortly, already moving to join him as Dvorak all but fled from the room.
Prince Loki didn’t say anything but Steve felt a prickle go up his spine and looked up to find the dark haired prince staring coldly at him. Thor might think highly of him but Steve got the feeling the brother was going to be a harder sell.
“You have her look; we can be thankful for that. The Von Trapps are an old, noble, family. How are your grandparents my dear?”
Stefen's mouth split into a fleeting grin as mirth passed through his eyes almost in a flash before it bled away to a grim sort of dread that Tony understood all too well. He felt it himself all too keenly.
Tony was still drinking in all there was to see of the camp, the squat buildings that made up the barracks – both those meant for officers and those meant for prisoners – and the administrative building perched at the top of the pile like a king upon a throne. Throughout the yard there were dozens of prisoners in striped prison uniforms, watched closely by armed Gestapo. They appeared to be on their way to work assignments or either just returning - their faces streaked with dirt and heavy with misery.
Steve swung him up into his arms and leveled with Artur's very serious expression. His little body was warm against Steve's chilled skin and he shifted hoping the rough canvas of his uniform didn’t scratch Artur's newly clean skin. The thought of blundering around in the dark looking for whatever the hell a crustacean was after everything else that had happened that day seemed impossible. But Artur was so hopeful, blinking at him and wiggling in anticipation.
“It’s just I worry.” She cut him off, eyes flicking up to him, razor sharp. “There are certain things people expect, and those who do not live up to public expectation can find themselves dangerously scrutinized. I wish it wasn’t that way. But we must take the world as it is.”
"What other reason could you have?" Steve cut in, but Tony held up a hand to stop him and Steve snapped his mouth shut with a painful click.
“No, Tony didn’t ask.  And I’m sure it’s not your cooking. I think he’s been worried about whether or not there will be a war.” Ian insisted and Willamina heaved a put-upon sigh, but she was looking at him with a considering expressions which was a favorable sign.
He hoped - god how he hoped - that Bucky would figure out a way to get himself and Stefen back to them, but that might not happen. It looked less and less likely every day that went by without news.
"Is Tony with him?" She asked, unsurprised by the surprise that flashed through his eyes before he replied that the less she knew the better. He always assumed she was stupid. Like she didn't know what it meant when they all met in secret and Bucky and Tony disappeared at the same time.
Steve chanced a glance in the rearview mirror and saw that Tony, although he was sandwiched between the children with Sara asleep in his lap and Artur using his shoulder as a pillow, was listening. His gaze met Steve’s in the mirror and though he didn’t say a word, Steve got the feeling that he knew exactly what Steve had been thinking about.
“No wonder Father Farkas is so fond of me.” he quipped, thinking that he clearly had not raised enough hell during his stay at the abbey. Had he known how handsomely Farkas was being paid to put up with him he’d have shown up to vespers in his knickers more than the once.
"It'll be okay." he murmured, glad she couldn't see the tears in his eyes. But he should have known Tacha would know they were there anyway.
the animals,” James pointed out with a worldly air for someone who minutes ago insisted they didn’t know how to pack their own clothes in a trunk. “What about the ones that haven't been discovered yet?"
Steve looked up through his swollen eyes, not quite able to process the sight of Henrick Dvorak standing over him, his uniform splattered with blood, his rifle held to his chest, standing amidst a heap of fallen comrades while the sounds of battle raged in the distance. Even injured, Steve recognized that the sounds were full of reverb as if coming from somewhere a way off. Whoever had attacked the motorcade was far behind them. Bucky. He knew it down in his bones. Bucky had come for him, that brave beautiful
here. I’ve left family behind before and I don’t got it in me to do it again.” The words constricted in Bucky’s chest, like a sob, but he pushed them out anyway. Charlotte shifted, a piteous look crossing her beautiful face.
“It is when you climb over the gate and try to sneak in through the window,” Natacha returned hotly, ignoring Clinton’s muttered grumbling as she turned to pin her glare on Tony and demand, “who is he?”
When it had become clear that folks preferred his work over just about anybody’s and his boss wasn’t keen on paying him accordingly, he’d used everything he had to open up his own shop not two doors down. The shopkeeper had been rivals with his former employer for years, up until recently when the old man had been forced to close shop and move his entire family to the ghetto they’d set up for the Jews.
He'd thought about grabbing him, wondered what it would feel like to press against him, push him down some. Gently. That way the water would caress his face and Steve could fit himself to him without harming him. The water would hold them together.
Ian stared at him for a long while, chewing on the words thoughtfully as he slowly relaxed against him.
He felt drugged. Slow and sluggish as he looked back down at his son who had opened his eyes to stare back at him, saying nothing, trusting.
He shouldn’t make Maria do it, she thought with a sudden swell of anger. She knew Maria wanted to, that she believed Tony when he said they had to sing so that people remembered; but Natacha knew that people would only remember what they wanted to. Worse, when they did remember her sister it would be with shallow regret and wistful sighs.
“Because, because I’m me! I’m not supposed to go to university. I’m supposed to train to be an officer and … bring glory to Germany!” he stammered. “They're not just going to let me leave.”
“Yes. They’re very excited. I hope you have your evening cleared because they have a list of demands already.”
“Frankly it’s unhealthy keeping them locked up here as if you feared they might catch the plague just by walking into town-”
The man laughed with surprising gusto for someone so thin, and the movement caused the gold cross he wore on a chain to slide out from beneath his shirt. He tucked it back in like he’d made the motion a million times before.
"Why would Herr Stark still be with us?" Charlotte pressed, and there was something in her tone that Steve did not like.
Indeed, Natacha was the first to step into the room, guiding Ian along with her and Péter followed with Sara.
That might not be enough a fearful voice needled at him, but he pushed it down, because if he gave into the fear, then he’d never have the strength to take aim and pull the trigger again.
Bucky looked at him now like he didn’t quite know him and that was far more painful than any sort of disgust he could have mustered up. He’d said once that he’d always known about Steve, or at least that he’d suspected… but, Steve supposed looking the proof in the face that your brother was a cocksucker was different. It felt different to Steve.
“We’re in the middle of a lesson. Herr Stark-” she tried but luck was on his side because for whatever reason, Stark threw his lot in with Bucky’s.
“Have you met my children?” he rattled through their names one by one and then to Charlotte’s shock, instead of turning to her as was the only proper thing to do (she could understand falling second to his children after all) he turned to Herr Stark and said, “And this is Herr Stark. A good friend. Oh and of course, the lovely woman on my arm is Baroness Shrader.”
Steve was drowning. He could recognize that. The rage that surged through him in waves was only superseded by the panic sucking at his insides. It was too
“All inventors start small Péter. Let’s focus on something small, like the identification of acids. Something we can show your father and warm him up to the idea of having a scientist for a son.”
Her hand stilled in his but she didn't let go. Her shoulders rose and fell with deliberately calm breaths, then she slowly pulled away.
“For all that they despised one another, Isiah and my father were the same. To them I am the consequence of my mother’s choices. I am both her rejection of you, your teachings, and your way of life; as well as the uncomfortable reminder that such things can never truly be discarded.
"He looks more Italian than either me or Lang, that’s for sure," was all he said but Stefen shot him a deadly glare.
He’d been sheltered in that way, and now there was a shallow thrill to having as many choices of news as he did. He'd already leafed through a copy of Der Stürmer that one of the maids had left in the staff quarters but the endless ramblings about ethnic Germans in Poland and their plight of persecution had inevitable bored him. He'd gone searching for more of the magazines but had found only the daily paper and the local HJ magazine that held the youth programs schedule for the week.
. Nonno had said the first Christmas Tony’s mother had taken him to see them. Nonno had asked Tony if he’d wanted to help light the candle. Mama had worried about it getting back to his father.
As war looms, Captain Rogers is called away and Tony finds himself in the entirely unforeseeable predicament of raising seven children he didn't even have the pleasure of making. Okay, not
Tony's heart was pounding as Stefen closed the door of the music room behind them. He'd been mildly surprised that Stefen had chosen the room until he remembered that he'd seen Bakhuizen heading for Stefen's study after he’d dropped the bombshell on them.
He did however glance down once more at the stack of sketches Steve had finished with an appraising eye, before fixing Steve with a pointed stare that made him want to fidget like Artur caught sneaking sweets. Thankfully he was better than that.
“What’s wrong?” Steve asked, and he was suddenly right there. Right in front of Bu0cky, taking up his vision and blocking out everything else. Bucky grinned, a nervous animal showing all his teeth.
Fondly he ran his hands through the boy’s soft hair, allowing himself to think about his mother. He’d never sat Shiva for his parents or Yinsen. At the time their deaths had been too sudden, too horrific, for him to contemplate anything but drinking himself into numbness and by the time he’d sobered it had seemed too late. He’d been running from their memories ever since.
"Just because some of us know a thing or two about how to treat a woman doesn't make us hopeless or romantics. Your Da's just jealous because he was all thumbs and left feet when he was wooing your mother. It was
“That was why I joined the army. It was about gaining a little power for myself as much as anything else. A name. A place in the world, even if it cost so much I wanted to be a citizen. Especially if it meant keeping myself and the people I loved alive and giving them a better life. It’s responsibility that gives power to a man. You can do great things, when you do them for others."
"Yes?" Stefen asked, somewhat impatient, after the silence had drawn on long enough to call Tony's mental health into question.
Frauline Werner didn’t jump when he opened the door and cleared his throat, though she did go completely still for the barest of seconds, her hand still tucked into Stefen’s desk drawer.
Glassy unfocused eyes stared back at him. Fiedor’s face was lax except around his mouth, lips parted, jaw stiff and gapping.
Charlotte was right. They had to think practically. Act in the best interest of the family. A Christmas wedding. Perhaps a spring funeral before they got the children off to the house in Geneva.
“I didn’t think I’d ever love someone like that again. You know how it is I’m sure.” Kroger nodded at him in commissary. “You’re quite the lucky man. Baroness Schrader is a very competent woman.”
And Steve didn’t mention it, but he was increasingly aware that even if the current minds behind Stark industries weren’t as brilliant as Hughard Stark had been, he knew someone that was. He’d never been more grateful for whatever on earth it was that had driven Tony to decide to forgo ships and weapons and pursue the faith. The thought of what the Reich could do with a mind like his at their disposal was frightening.
He’d been startled to hear that Oster was spearheading the coup. Their mission however perilous was not without fire power. He had the General and Major Groscurth to thank for his shared position with Rogers. They’d had a hand in putting together their command so that now they were all in one place nearly ready to strike when the timing was right.
He knew why Stefen would feel the need to seek him out. The math was simple. By now Tony had witnessed enough to do the man serious harm if he wanted, never mind his suspicions about his activities. Stefen had injured him in an episode that any doctor would have classified as mentally imbalanced and he’d just outright called the actions of the HJ and the Reich senseless and cruel.
His hands gripped the wheel tightly as he drove along the track back toward the station, following the well-worn ruts in the snow. The back of the luggage car drew closer and closer, and it was sheer luck that he hadn’t turned to cross the track and head into the station yet when the rear door opened, a slight figure leaping out and landing in a tumble. Another body followed quickly after and if the strange sight hadn’t already been enough reason to stop, the flash of brilliant red hair on top of the second person’s head would have done it.
“Did you look in on them?” Steve asked, concerned. Cameron and Daniel had been through a lot over the past few days. They didn’t need to be ill on top of things.
“Forgive me Father, Sub-prior,” Tiberius nodded shortly to he and Filip in turn before rounding on Nik with every last drop of his pent up frustration and demanding, “something must be done about Antony! I know that you’re fond of him Father. Perhaps you find his antics amusing, but he isn’t a child anymore and I insist he be held accountable this time. The man is a menace!”
He checked their quarters first. Breezing past Pepper and, sure enough, the maids she'd been instructing.
“I think Tony’s happy enough with the way things are.” Steve bit out, the lie tasting sour on his tongue. “And I have seven children. Not a dozen.”
“Major?” Parodi had held up the little bottle, questioning, but Steve had shaken his head. He knew the drug did wonders at boosting alertness and morale, but he did not relish trading his downed spirits with a racing heart, paranoia and terrifying dreams – the way it had the first time. He didn’t begrudge Bucky the opportunity to forget for a while. Some men could handle it better, but he’d rather burn his legs to stay awake than to ever take the salt again.
Frau Hogan (and Tony was really going to have to call her something else besides her married name if he was going to flirt with her properly) wrinkled her nose at the mention of the woman (Pepper, he was going to call her Pepper for the freckles) but the corner of her mouth twitched in merriment. She hadn’t liked Frauline Glass either it seemed.
“I’m sorry boys, if you’ve felt I was keeping you from your grandmother’s memory all these years. It wasn’t my intent.” Steve began, the words coming with difficulty each one harder than the last. “Your Baka was an amazing woman; you should know that. I’m very proud to be her son.”
“Stefen...” Tony began, but when Steve looked back at him, he did not need words to express his rage, and Tony fell quiet. For now. It was always for now with Tony.
"Perhaps it will give the Major comfort to have a familiar voice near." Dvorak filled in, unspoken command behind each word. Fischer's eyes met his and held. The man might have private orders, but Dvorak was still the senior officer in the room.
He finally turned his head and looked at his godfather once more. Looked at him in his pressed slacks and matching jacket, the salt and pepper beard he always sported trimmed neatly upon his face, his blue eyes staring back at Tony hiding so much scrutiny.
Tony did not judge him for that fear. How could he? To lose one’s wife was bad enough. But then to face the possibility of losing your children on top of it? It would have driven Tony mad. He didn’t quite know how Stefen could be standing there as straight backed and outwardly put together as he was when he was so clearly at his wits end because were Tony in his shoes he certainly wouldn’t be.
The morning had dawned clear and bright, the kind of early spring morning that men longed for. Winter had a few weeks left in it yet, but the promise of spring felt like a mockery to Henrick Dvorak. His world had collapsed inward, and yet the sun still rose and bathed him in warmth as if to remind him of the many long days still left to him. Without his child. Without his woman.
He’d never been so relieved when it happened, not wanting to imagine what might have eventually become of his friend had Steve continued to go on as he had been: pouring all that he had into the rebuild of Austria and forgetting how to live.
“Oh this is amazing! But these are yours. I can’t –” Ned waved away the objection before Péter could even really get started, shifting the strap of his bag higher up on his shoulder as he edged toward the line of boarders.
Fists tightening with fury Steve slowed his heart beat, aware of the danger they were all in and knowing he had to act quickly.
“Please be frank with me Niky, are you trying to arrange my death? Because it sounds to me as if you would like me to walk into the house of a Nazi officer and ask to play with his children, hoping of course that he never realizes that the embodiment of everything our beloved Führer so detests is standing right in front of him!”
“You want me, to be some sort of… governess?!” He asked incredulously and Nik scowled at him. It was official. Niklas Farkas had lost whatever good sense he was born with. He wanted to place this man’s poor children in
“This is a contingency plan, for when the poor fools you’ve convinced to use themselves as a diversion are all dead.”
“But I’ve got lots of work to finish. I better get back to it before Herr Hammer catches me slacking.”
And Because monasteries are segregated by gender we set our favorite monk in St. Peter's Abbey, across the way. Pictures below.
“I imagined being a doctor and restoring my patients to glory for Germany and countless other daydreams children have. I didn't quite imagine this…” For a moment the doctor looked horribly wistful as if he might start sniveling, but the strange moment passed as quickly as it came. The man blinked rapidly and straightened his spine as if were coming awake and cleared his throat.
Bucky sat the cup down with a clipped thunk and met Steve's gaze head on, oblivious to where Steve’s thoughts had gone.
“I’ve got to get home.” Grimm grunted from beside him. “I’m sorry but you’re on your own from here Captain. It’s too dangerous for me to involve my family any further.”
"Where were you Tacha?" He hadn't meant it to sound accusatory, but it must have, because she flinched, and then her eyes were cutting into him sharply with censure.
“You won’t – you won’t let –“ he tried to get out over a thick tongue and Tony just watched him with sympathy, pity thankfully nowhere in sight.
Sure enough as soon as the sleek black town car pulled up beside the curb the Duchess turned to him and boldly squeezed his hand.
Deciding the way forward is an impossible choice for Tony and Steve, but the escalating fight in Europe won't let them sit with it for long.
Steve looked to the merchant manning the stall and noted her general aura of annoyance and shrugged, taking Tony by the elbow and pulling him toward the next vendor.
"But you did report on me. On my family." Saying the words didn’t lessen the sting, but they helped Steve find his ground and keep his focus. He wasn’t going to allow Tony to slither out of this.
And then he’d screamed, uncaring of who might hear or what the household might think if they did. Damn them all. Damn the whole house and damn Captain Rogers most of all. Rogers should be here. He should be there to clean up this
She was listening. Tony didn’t think she’d ever looked at him quite that way, like a child who had lost their adult, beseeching a stranger for help.
’ expectedly subdued given the shadow of dread that hung over the conversation. But Natacha was in his arms, and Péter was teaching his younger brother how to play the board game with patience, and James was sleeping off the biscuits and jam that he’d gorged himself on that morning made by his sister's hands. It was far from perfect, Steve thought with a pang – he didn’t dare look over the boy’s heads and see Bucky standing there – too many missing faces... It was all that it could be.
"They were sweet on you Stefen." Bakhuizen winked at him roguishly explaining to their eager audience, "Only reason they let us stay at the inn with no money and fed us up is because they thought your Da was cuter than a button."
Steve had contacted Parodi months ago. The last he’d heard, Lucan had gone back to his father’s home in Dagal earlier in the year, only to find that even as far south as Liechtenstein the Germans were forcing the Jews from their homes and into the ghettos. Three cousins on his father’s side were now in a segregated quarter of the city. His wife’s entire family had been transplanted out of the city entirely due to overcrowding.
Oster had secured the promise of the Army Chief that more units would be sent in order to hold the capital while they held their hostage and the generals encouraged the Führer to sign a letter of resignation as head of the Abwehr and as Germany’s fearless leader.
He’d gone straight to Willamina’s supply of schnapps and retreated into the solitary of his room. He’d been half way through the bottle before the rage bubbling inside of him had become overwhelming, not in the least numbed by the spirits. He’d thrown the bottle against the wall and watched it break with a crash, bits of glass tinkling as the walls dripped, the room filled with the pungent scent of alcohol.
“Don’t worry Stefen. Together, we’ll figure something out.” Tony encouraged, daring once more to brush his lips against Steve’s. Steve hummed thoughtfully as Tony pulled back.
Even at war in the mountains, when no one knew who would wake in the morning, they could still cheer one another with the old songs. And after the war - when silence had almost broken Bucky and the Uncles had spit on the ground they both walked on - music had saved him, given him some purpose that wasn’t sending bullets into other men’s bodies and made him feel at home.
“Herr Hammer and I will both be staying in the house on a permanent basis until the captain returns. Julia we’ll need the rooms freshly turned over.” Frau Hogan announced to the servants before her gaze landed on Julia who nodded somberly to show that she’d heard.
Steve didn’t wait to watch him disobey the order. The hall outside the bedroom was still dark and empty but Steve could hear faint sounds floating up the stairs at the end of the short hall. He was the earliest habitual riser, but sometimes Tony’s grandmother’s back gave her trouble sleeping. She liked to make a drink and read her bible in the kitchen. Steve found her there, and to his immense relief Natacha was there too, drinking from a steaming mug and nibbling on a plate of the morning bread Antonia had baked the night before.
Studying the woman’s face, Tony recognized her. He understood better now why the man had been so unwilling to stop, even if it meant striking Stefen right there in the road. It was one thing for a history professor with a love of music to be with seen with a musician who happened to be a Jew. It was another thing altogether to be seen by an officer rescuing her.
“No!” his voice cracked, broken and raw in his throat as he tried to thrash free of Schmidt’s hold. He had to get to his children before Schmidt did.
“-Not for me, for the children.” He interrupted because the faster he got permission the quicker the conversation would be over.
“Hitler has just implemented a new naval plan as well. He anticipates clashing with British forces in the Baltic sea and wishes to build a fleet massive enough to crush them and cross the Atlantic to reach British shores. If these plans are completed the German navy will consist of twelve battlecruisers, ten new battleships, over two-hundred-fifty submarines, one hundred-fifty-eight destroyers and torpedo boats, and fifty light cruisers. Not to mention additional armored ships and aircrafts.
They finally headed ashore what felt to Steve like hours later, dragging the boats up onto a small grassy stretch of bank and tying them to a pair of thick nails that Bucky helped him drive into the ground. Steve was glad to hand Sara off to Natacha in favor of unloading boxes of supplies and shouldering sacks and back packs on his back, as Tony led them into the trees in search of a proper place to make camp, lecturing the entire way about the local wildlife and what kinds of plants could be found in these mountains.
Stefen was loath to let Tony go, nearly changing his mind and insisting they call the whole thing off several times the night before he was to set out. In truth, Tony was loath to be let go. He was no less determined and no less sure that the mission was his duty, and he the best one to see it through - but he could not say he wasn’t frightened of death.
“Tony!” the harsh cry was immediately followed by hands gripping his shoulders and tugging. Tony moved with them, rolling off of Péter and Ian’s curled bodies and sitting up, blinking blearily at Stefen’s face, pressed close to his. The captain’s wild eyes were jarringly incongruent with the stillness of his features. The outward appearance of control shattered by the raw terror in their whites as his hands flew over Tony’s extremities feeling for injuries. Tony reached for him, clutching the sleeves of his jacket. I’m fine, he meant to say, but he couldn’t press the words out through the tight clenching in his chest. Stefen’s hands discovered that fact for themselves, and set Tony aside almost briskly as he moved to check on to the two boys.
He could hear the James teeth chattering, which did not bode well, but he wasn’t so frozen apparently that he couldn’t muster the will to speak because Tony saw his face scrunch up with the familiar signs of temper. Franticly Tony made a silencing motion as James opened his mouth to scream no doubt, and Péter hastily clamped his hand over the younger boy’s mouth, making a frantic motion of his own.
Tony wiped away what he’d not been able to swallow, watching with a smug expression as Stefen leaned against the door fighting for breath. If it had been Tony’s intention to completely shatter his world, then mission successful. Stefen looked as if he might faint.
“I’ll come back-” She began but got no further as Steve slumped, crumpling like a rag doll onto the old blanket covered in musty hay not far from the edge of the pen. It was dirty and sharp with the smell of goat piss but it was warm beneath him. So warm he could cry. The tears were still wet on his cheeks long after he was sucked down into exhausted sleep.
He knew what he wanted out of the future… yes. But Tony knew better than most how many ways a future could divide.
"Truck never made it to the check point. I found it and another still smoking in a crater. No bodies left at the site."
As Stefen continued to grill their escort, Tony smiled to reassure them that everything would work out, though he had no real certainty of that fact himself.
“Hugo is dead, the Germans got him!” He declared, nearly out of breath from his run. Tony noticed for the first time that his coat was blood stained, his expression panicked as he slogged through the water collecting on the floor snapping, “We’re too far out to swim. We must radio for help. ”
They'd been on the water for about four hours to Tony's estimation. It was colder now than it had been walking through the fields, but maybe that was just because his robes were half soaked. Tony kept the boat steady as she traveled up the Amper towards the Isar, a mostly steady journey through quiet hills and barren German fields. It was good in some respects that they were making this journey in the early part of winter, as there were few farmers, fisherman or any of the like still wandering about to spot them. Still, those first few hours he stayed on edge, expecting to spot a patrol on one of the roads they passed. But after a while Tony began to notice himself preoccupied by other things, mainly the cold in his hands and the hunger beginning too twist through his belly.
"There you go.” The captain’s chest rose and fell in a sigh of frustration. “I don't understand you Tony. If you want this as much as I do, why talk about cages?"
As she sat there, facing off with the woman who had given her life but denied her so many other things, Tony had felt something for the first time other than resentment for Baroness Schrader.
“Doesn’t it? You have a hard time trusting my family. Let’s not pretend that you find drifters and exiles easier to trust.” Tony was the one to take the captain by the elbow this time, guiding him toward the north end of the square, the opposite direction from the one the girls had taken. Maria Santiago had sent word the day before that another letter had come and they needed to collect it.
So she needed a starting point. Because she's not a super spy who has been through the Red Room. Before death touches the family and her childhood is stripped away she's a twelve-year-old girl and not just any, she's Steve and Peggy's twelve-year-old girl, so what does that look like?
It was the sharp stinging in his mouth and the dull ache in his tongue that grounded him. He’d bitten it, his mind put together too slowly, even as it tried to bring the details of the room he’d woken in into greater focus. A bedroom. Still dark, though the shadows had lifted. It was an early winter morning. There a lump in the bed, and lumps spread out on the floor under heavy blankets. It was a blanket that had twisted around him while he slept.
Tony paused with a scowl, thinking back to dinner. The miserable air that surrounded the table, the children flinching away from their father with fear of rebuke at every turn. It reminded him too much of his own childhood, leaving a sour taste in his mouth. Perhaps it had led him to be more snappish with the captain than was wise. But they were only children and they only wanted their father’s attention. Tony could handle spiders in his bed (he was thankful to have avoided a headless chicken) and any number of petty tricks or pranks, because he understood that it was just their way of pleading for notice. Or perhaps he was projecting. That was possible and even likely given his bad track record. Still he could not help but feel in this instance he was right. The children did not even have play clothes! When he’d asked Pepper (who did not seem to like at all that he’d taken to calling her such) about it while she’d overseen the final touches to the room before leaving him for the night she’d laughed and told him that the Rogers children did not play. They marched! Oh if Tony had a schilling for every time he’d heard what Stark men were supposed to do in lieu of childish things…
Of course when he said it, he had no idea just how true those words were. At that very moment two things were happening. Harold who was taking his lunch on the steps outside the garage hearing the sound of an approaching motor car sat up suddenly, and recognizing the old family car ran to ring the house bell and alert the staff to make ready for the captain’s return.
“They’ve their Sunday clothes. If that doesn’t work, well, I did promise Natacha there would be shopping.”
Tony shared with Stefen stories from his own school days, including the time when he’d snuck to a club one night and ran into one of his professors there, and Stefen listened avidly, laughing and despairing at Tony’s youthful antics. When they were full and had soaked up about as much of the sun as they could bear they began making their way back toward the hotel, via a less crowded avenue because Stefen declared he had one final stop to make.
"All but Maria. They have declared her illegitimate. Father has arranged to send her to the workhouse quietly, to avoid public scandal." Charlotte recounted tonelessly.
He was close enough to see the storm brewing in Stefen’s eyes, the way the blue deepened at the word friend. Close enough to see, that even if he couldn’t say that other word aloud, friend was understood. Not exactly just as good, and not exactly better either. Just good, on its own. He hoped they’d always be friends, and he fully anticipated Stefen protecting his friends the best way he knew how.
That rest of the day Tony taught them how to harvest the cones for their seeds, to make syrup from sap, and how to collect tar and make pitch for the soap from the branches. They ground together some of the harvested nuts and mixed it with flour and fat to make a cake that they cooked in a pan on the grate in the fireplace. He called it pinolata, which he said his mother had taught him to make with pine nuts and almond flour. Only theirs was different because they had no eggs, no butter, and no sugar to make sticky caramel with. Instead they smothered it in the pungent sticky syrup they made from the sap and sprinkled it with roasted nuts. It was supposed to be good anyway because it was theirs.
“Of course. You’re a young woman now, and heaven knows that’s not a soldier’s expertise.” Frauline Werner reached out to cover Natacha’s hand with her own, the way mama used to.
She pulled back and looked up at him. The tears he thought he’d seen in her eyes earlier were gone. If they’d ever been there at all. Maybe that was just his brain showing him things he wanted to see. He didn’t care. Right now, she just looked like his little girl, his
