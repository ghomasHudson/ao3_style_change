"Anyway," he continued, "that's kind of the long and short of it. Got turned into a woman, got knocked— er,
again. The whole penetration thing? Yeah, no matter what fantasies were cooking up in Steve's perverted old brain, probably would want to wait on that until they could secure about five different reliable forms of birth control. He was definitely
"I know, but…" She gave his hand a squeeze. "If you need anything — anything — don't even hesitate to ask me, you understand me?"
"You really need a 'trial run' to see if you like laying around in bed and stuffing your face all morning?"
, don't misunderstand me, but also kind of inconsequential. Basically it's whatever you prefer. As long as I have
So, they showered again, this time less luxuriating and more just to get cleaned up, and changed back into the clothes they'd thrown off before their lovemaking. Steve thought about stripping the bed and changing the sheets, but that seemed like too much effort, and he was fucking tired now and just wanted to sleep, so he led Tony back out into the living room and pulled him down on top of him on the couch, shoving the clean laundry to the one end and plopping his feet onto the pile, Tony sprawled out over top of him.
Esmeralda — evidently not-dead Esmeralda — frowned when she sensed that Tony was on-guard about something. "I'm not going to hurt her. I just want to see."
Tony noisily sucked down the remainder of the liquid in his cup, and he set it on the tray Steve had grabbed then grabbed his bag from the chair and stood up. He checked his phone again as Steve went to deposit the garbage, and he rolled his eyes when he saw Barton had sent him another text yet again.
"I suppose I can, but then we'll just be right back where we started. I can turn him back, but he'll still be with child."
Tony's mother had attempted to rear him in Catholic teachings as well, as it turned out, she being, at the least, part-Italian, but Steve was pretty sure those teachings had fallen by the wayside before Tony could even vote (which was now eighteen and not twenty-one as it had been in his day; oddly, the drinking age had gone from eighteen up to twenty-one), and Tony seemingly felt no guilt for indulging in beef and poultry products on a day when religion told them they should abstain.
But strangest and most frightening of all was the odd, short man with the messy, dark hair. He was a bit older than Steve would have imagined for himself, but, and he shut his eyes tight as he let this next thought wash over him. He was everything he'd always fantasized about, if only for a brief moment before he was able to tap those emotions back down to the deep, dark part of his soul where they came from. Steve had a thing for brunettes. This man was a brunette. He had a thing for slender bodies. This man was much more lithe and slender than Steve ever would be again. He had a thing for smartassed motor-mouths. Yeah, Steve was pretty sure this Tony fit that bill, too.
…has been gone a couple days, right?" At her vigorous nod, her blonde ponytail bouncing, he added, "Well, a few weeks is lots of those 'couple days' put back-to-back." When she frowned and titled her head in some confusion, he continued, "It's a couple days, and then a couple more days, and then a couple more days, and then a couple more days after that," and at each instance of 'a couple days,' her brown eyes went wider and wider, her mouth falling open in shock and sadness.
He turned back to finish prepping the bottle, and Steve let out a breath and said, "I just have a feeling, Tony. That's all. I just... I don't think you should entirely get your hopes up about Olivia being the third Stark to attend MIT." He shrugged a little and added, "I mean, she's not even technically a Stark."
He almost jumped out of his skin at Steve's sleep-strained question, and unwilling to admit to being caught out, he swallowed and pulled his hand away from his mouth and said a shaky, "Nothing, babe. Go back to sleep."
And by the time all that was said and done, JARVIS was announcing the arrival of the 'jet, and Tony said, "Have the Iron Man armor escort Steve to the penthouse, please, J."
Pepper and Natasha nodded their agreement, the three of them turning their eyes on Tony, not to judge but to make him understand…something.
Tony kissed back but still had the temerity to say, "You were gone for, like, five minutes. You didn't just return from the war."
"The hell you went to all this trouble for boiled potatoes and corned beef. And don't give me any of that shit about it being the food of your people. You're from Brooklyn. The food of your people is egg creams and hotdogs. And you bullshit you meant 'food'—"
Steve's eyes about bugged out of his head, and he leaned down and pressed a hard and sloppy kiss against Tony's mouth then pulled back and said, "No, I'm fine with it. I'm up for it. What do you need? Do you want me on the bed? Do you want me to stand? Should I sit on the chair over there? Do you want me to kneel? What do you want me to—?"
want this baby), but it was what had to be. Steve had made his choice, and he'd chosen his old pal over his own fucking husband— wife— whatever the fuck Tony technically was. Tony didn't think he could do this alone, and, to be honest, he didn't want Barnes knowing
"Steve," Hill said, gentle, but with a knowing edge, and when Steve glanced up to meet her gaze, she looked just a shade remorseful as she continued, "you have to get ahead of this. You have to tell them the truth. Not just for yours and Tony's sakes but for the team's. Being fodder for the gossips is going to affect how well we're able to do our jobs."
Natasha pursed her lips at Bucky, her eyes flat, and Steve knew that wasn't the end of the conversation, but she turned back to Sam and continued, "Anyway, Pepper's looking for wedding venues, and I was telling her about this one. She was intrigued, so I told her to stop by and I'd show her around."
Tony just shrugged, not agreeing but not fighting it, either, and Steve changed the channel again and said, "If I went on-record with how much I hate that song, you think I could get it banished from existence?"
He went into the kitchen, the lights coming on immediately upon entry, and he went over and set Olivia in her highchair then said, "Let's see about that coffee."
He stopped, something sharp and painful hitting him in the chest. He turned to Steve and met his tired anguish and said, "I'm your…" He frowned and motioned over himself, unsure of the word he should use. 'Husband' in spirit but 'wife' in body?
Olivia squealed in joy and clapped her hands together, and Rhodey clapped him on the shoulder and said, "You know there's no coming back from this, right?"
He blinked to clear his thoughts, and Wilson directed his attention to him and said, "I wasn't sure if you'd show after Nat said you weren't piling into the limo with us."
He wouldn't go so far as to say he loved everything about being a dad (diapers and spit-up, though he accepted as a natural fact of life, were still both god-awful in their own right), but he loved being a dad. He loved taking care of his daughter and feeding her and bathing her and playing with her. He loved watching her grow — watching as she discovered new things about the world around her. He loved her giggles, and he'd soon come to see his daughter's laughter as the best sound in the world. Her cries, especially if it was a cry where she'd hurt herself somehow, broke his heart.
"Yeah, about that," he said as the nurse stopped beside a scale. He stopped as well, and he looked at it and said, "What's this?"
"You know, the 'fossil' that you're married to doesn't exactly appreciate all the age jokes at his expense."
Tony seemed to find what he was looking for, and he set some controller-like thing down on the table and turned his attention back to the toddler that was busy pulling bows off of elegantly- wrapped packages beneath a large evergreen festooned in tiny white lights (what in the world kind of lights were they?), ornaments, and garland that was either silver or gold depending on how the light hit it.
Sam scoffed. "Get off your high horse. I remember some pretty fierce competitions in college, and I distinctly remember you throwing the controller so hard that it cracked the picture tube."
Tony let go finally, and Rhodey patted his back once more as he sat back. He blinked away the remnants of tears that had collected at the corners of his eyes then turned to Bruce, who was fucking
,' and Steve took that to mean that Howard was indeed dead — but he didn't think 'Howard' was a subject he wanted to stay on any longer than he had to, and so he reached out and took hold of Tony's left hand and grasped hold of Tony's ring between his thumb and forefinger. "So, then, your last name is 'Stark.'"
He was stopped from saying anything more by Natasha's mouth on his again, but this time, she'd leaned over and grabbed his face with both hands, crushing their mouths together and using his surprise to slip her tongue into his mouth. She moved her hands from his face down his neck and then over his breasts, and he squeezed his eyes shut and tried to look as into it as he possibly could as Natasha groped his breasts, pushing herself against him as she plundered his mouth with her tongue. Before he knew it, Natasha had crawled onto his lap and was straddling him, and she broke the kiss and grinned down at him, her hands moving from his breasts down over his abdomen and toward his pelvis.
Tony watched as Steve stared down at the objects in his hand like he couldn't fathom what he was seeing. He didn't linger too much on the portrait of his father — understandably; he'd never known the man — and the photo of himself and Bucky at what looked like Steve's high school graduation seemed to make him just the slightest bit uncomfortable, but he spent an awful long time staring at the portrait of his mother. Tony started to think that he'd been had and these weren't even Steve's old photos at all, and he went to apologize for even attempting to pass off clear forgeries as the real thing when Steve turned to him, eyes wet and awe written over his face.
"Well, I suppose I could have been more direct and said I wouldn't see your bonded for some time. You, on the other hand... No, this was always fated."
"Haven't turned it down yet," Tony replied and kissed back then turned his attention back to the container of formula. "You know, I have a feeling this stuff sucks compared to the homemade stuff."
didn't. But Steve Rogers?" He seemed a little abashed but a little amused as well as he added, "Once or twice."
Sam heaved out a sigh. "Look, man, all I know is what happened afterward. He showed up on the doorstep at three o'clock in the morning looking like a drowned rat because it was pouring raining, and all he wanted to know was what he did wrong. And a head's up that you were going to do this might have been nice, you know? Buck and I were as confused as he was. Thankfully, he did most of the talking. I don't even think he realized neither Buck or I ever gave him an answer."
, but I don't want that to be the only thing we talk about." He snorted a laugh. "Jesus, talk about..."
"Exactly! We don't know! For all we know, she comes from a world of war and pestilence, and alternate universe me sent her here because he knew—"
Tony hopped off the chair and moved over to him, pressing against him, the difference in their heights noticeable again now that he'd taken his shoes off because, again, fuck heels.
They strolled down the sidewalk in relative silence, the slosh of wet snow beneath their feet and the scarce amount of traffic on the street beside them. They were closer to the square now, festively lit up for the season, and as Steve stopped at the corner and waited for the traffic to pass, he said, "Is Hydra really still around?"
"What, why?" Tony snapped, not in the mood for Steve's fucking rationality at the moment, and it wasn't until Steve rolled his eyes that Tony remembered they had an audience—
"Doesn't have to have been," Tony said breezily. "Could've been an ex or maybe a boyfriend no one knew about."
Tony just swallowed. "Steve?" he reiterated, and he met Steve's gaze and saw nothing in those beautiful blue irises but absolute anguish.
"She was a kid! She didn't know any— She thought I had amnesia again or something! Look, it doesn't matter—"
Tony blinked, his doe-eyes somehow even more pronounced beneath the sweep of finely-shaped dark eyebrows, and he shook his head ever so slightly and said, "I don't..."
walking anyway. "Sorry, kiddo. Can't sit this one out. I mean I should, I but I really, really can't."
"Oh!" She pulled more cheese off the slice. "Nah. Mr. Ant-Man has a daughter named Cassie. She's older 'n me."
He finished cleaning up, straightened his uniform out, and left the restroom with much more aplomb than he'd entered it.
He looked between the three of them, who were all staring back at him rather expectantly — well, Bruce and Natasha were; Barnes was making a face like he'd just realized what kind of exam Bruce was going to have to perform and would really have been happier not knowing — and then murmured, "Yeah, I know," then went over to the storage cabinet for another sheet. He grabbed one and went back over to the table then motioned to the others. "Turn around! I'm not doing a striptease."
for sure was about that that 'B' is impossible, so try to avoid hitting on 'A.' I'm sure those names aren't even in that book. Hell, 'Edna' was an old-lady name in my day."
"Nope! Don't want to hear it! Captain Rogers can fall in a ditch for all I care. And you can tell him that. Tell him those exact words, and make sure he knows this is not me being 'sensitive.' This is me done with his bullshit. This is me done feeling like I'm not good enough for him. This is me letting him chase after his precious
"How can you people eat this crap?" he muttered then took a large bite of the plain, toasted bread anyway.
"Yeah, well," he shrugged, deciding to play off Thor's words rather than allow himself any introspection through them, "work with what you got."
but circumstances had changed quite a bit in the past thirty-six hours, and so without a word, he accepted the call and said a breezy, "Hey, Cap! What's got you up at this hour?"
"Within reason," Tony replied with a shrug. "I know you're not much for the java, my science brother from another mother, so how about some of that herbal tea shit—
"You want to retire," Steve said, trying to save Tony the misery of having to say the words himself.
"I don't know," he said quickly, cutting off Steve mid-ask. "I really don't—" He reached out and brushed his hand over the top of Olivia's bald little head. "Being stuck in this body hasn't exactly been the
Even though Barnes had said he was gone to meet Hill, he honestly expected Hill to put in an appearance right after Barnes left, and he sat there for several quiet minutes and waited for her to barge into his penthouse like the others had, but she never showed. No one did. Midday sun had given way to clouds, and so he sat there in his living room, the gloomy, late afternoon showing through the broad floor-to-ceiling windows surrounding him. As the last of the adrenaline — and sedative — began to leave his system, a darker and sadder feeling began to overtake him, one that actively worked to counteract all the goodness and positivity he'd been able to convince himself of from the moment Bruce had walked into his lab looking baleful and ashen-faced.
Tony closed his eyes, his arms out at his sides, and he took a deep inhale of breath as he felt Esmeralda's finger touch his lips. The feeling was almost familiar now, a wave of shock of and heat flooding his body, and he felt himself go weightless before, next thing he knew, he was on his back looking up at the ceiling, Esmeralda and Steve standing above him looking down.
"OK," he said with an appraising nod. "Good. Look, anything ever bothers you — even in the slightest — don't even hesitate to tell me. You need an upgrade?"
"Indeed!" Thor said, chiming in to the conversation. "Anthony is quite talented in the culinary arts. Steven and Olivia Louise are both very lucky indeed."
"Somewhere, Clint's head just exploded from being unable to make a 'size of the boat' crack," Natasha mused, and while Jim snorted a laugh and Tony shot her a
He turned to Happy again, and he leaned forward and lightly punched him in the shoulder and said, "Congratulations, Hap, my man. She's a great gal, isn't she?"
Steve didn't know what to say to that, so he just kept his mouth shut and waited for Tony to finish what he was doing, and he totally did
"And I'm not the only one that thinks so," he said, and Steve frowned at him in confusion before Tony took his hand and put it against his belly. "Feel?"
The outfit was actually pretty tasteful and chic, he thought. Stylish — not like those garish outfits he'd seen in movies or TV shows. Understated. Sophisticated. He had to admit, he wasn't actually embarrassed to be seen in public looking like this, and what's more, he'd even picked it out himself. Natasha and Hill and Pepper would be proud. Steve, though…
"What was that?" Hill asked, cloyingly innocent like she knew exactly what he'd said but wanted him to repeat it for the rest of the class.
Bruce sighed a little and shook his head, but he shot Tony a pointed look and said, "You're not that ignorant of anatomy."
Tony reached down and pulled the blanket up some to more fully cover them. "Yeah, but you're so fucking determined to take the world on your shoulders to keep everyone else safe and protected. You've gotta let me help you shoulder the burden more often. Contrary to all the whining I do, I don't actually mind it. There's no one else I'd rather do it for."
he looked attractive, belly and all. Because he knew he looked like a goddamned goddess. And he kind of liked that. Because it was empowering. Because it was invigorating. Because he'd had sex and enjoyed sex many, many,
Steve rubbed his hands lightly over Tony's hips and thighs, kneading the tips of his fingers into the lace-covered flesh. "You can't just keep asking JARVIS to run scans for you, and you can't keep bothering Bruce. You need to go to someone that has experience with this sort of thing."
Yeah, Tony was going to have to figure out what this Iron Cap was pretty soon. A toy of some kind, he figured. Captain America in an Iron Man costume, maybe? Which was fucking stupid. "Yeah," he said, sidestepping the Iron Cap thing for the moment, "but you're sleepy."
with him, which was just— I'm so glad these aren't my clothes, because if they were, I'd have incinerated them by now. So, anyway, he's doing that gross grinding thing against my thigh, which, ha! He's a legend in his own mind. Fucking pencil dick."
"Because that would mean they got their hands on you," he said in a quiet voice, "and I would die before I let that happen to you."
. Something about avenging. It sounded like a strange fairytale, and while Steve had never minded fairytales, per se, he also hadn't believed in them. Cute stories, but nothing beyond that.
Though there was still an element of playfulness there, a sliver of something hard and dark and maybe even a touch domineering slipped into the guy's gaze. "Maybe you're just a troublemaker," he said.
"Yep, heard it, got it, on my way, J," he said then turned to Barnes and said, "Uh, you hanging out down here or—?"
One other sleepless night, he found Steve down in the living room, Olivia cradled against his chest as he swayed with her to what sounded like 'Easy to Be Hard' playing quietly from the room's speakers. Tony thought it an odd choice but didn't say anything because the sight of Steve set against the moonlight streaming in from the floor-to-ceiling windows with their daughter cradled so lovingly against him warmed his heart like he couldn't explain and, quietly, he made his way over to the pair, Steve glancing up and watching him make his way over.
"Fine," he muttered, then said, "See you later," and Steve heard the departing clack of three sets of expensive shoes against linoleum. He kept quiet and tucked into himself for a few more minutes, until both Bucky and Sam wheeled back from the desk and shot pointed looks at him. "Way to be strong, man," Sam said.
Steve chuckled a little and squeezed him one more time, and he kissed his forehead and said, "I'm sorry, honey. You know, maybe that's what Esmeralda was? Some manifestation of that?"
He stopped short a moment, mouth dropped open and eyes blinking beneath furrowed brow. He had taken it for an absolute truth that Esmeralda was dead and he would never again be faced with the
"You're never going to be able to top this," Steve said and winced a little as a couple of sparks hit him.
"You, too," he finally said because he suddenly remembered the Cap had been orphaned at a young age as well.
Esmeralda merely directed her attention down to the baby cradled in Tony's arms. "She is quite beautiful, isn't she? Just like her mother."
"Steve runs ten miles every morning before breakfast," Pepper reminded him. "I really think that's where that was probably coming from."
Steve just dropped his head at Tony's rather blunt explanation, but he picked himself back up and met Tony's gaze again.
He motioned over himself like the rest required no explanation, and Barnes stared at him and frowned a moment then pointed to him and said, "So,
"Fucking sap," Tony muttered, but Steve just stayed quiet as he rubbed his cheek against the top of Tony's head. "You know, any of the others catch us like this, they'll never let us live it down."
But Wilson just grinned as his purchase evidently completed, and he glanced up at Steve and said, "Yeah, I get to learn all these really neat things about you."
He tilted his head back and forth a bit and said, "Eh, maybe a little. Really hope this doesn't keep up the whole time. I don't think I could handle it."
Without Tony or Olivia there to distract him, it now meant he was better able to listen to the Christmas music playing in the background — well, if he could even call it 'music.' He'd maybe recognized a handful of the songs he'd heard since the car this morning, and even then, it was only because the lyrics rang a bell to him and not the tunes themselves.
"Tony," Natasha said, her frown morphing into a knowing look, "just let Bruce look at you. If you won't do it for yourself, do it for Steve. You know Steve would want you to."
He dropped his hand away once he determined that Steve wasn't going to argue with him, and Steve exhaled a breath and said, "I just want him to… I just want him to be OK."
But here— Here was one that did not just have the potential for Steve's strength but Tony's intelligence. OK, not that Steve was an idiot, but with Tony's genes in the mix, there was an even greater potential for a little super-human super-genius for Hydra to get their hands on, to train, to soldier for them and design weapons the world could not possibly yet imagine.
He found her sprawled on the couch with the TV remote in her hand, and with what he knew was the elevator fast approaching, he scooped her up over her protests and ran over to the fire staircase. He pushed through the door and into the stairwell just as he heard the elevator ding its arrival, and he let out a breath of relief and carried Olivia down two flights of stairs then stopped on the landing and waited, her protests chirping in his ear. He let her whine for a few, long minutes then said, "I know, kid, but, uh— Hey! Want to, ah, head down to my floor for a little while?"
"Uh, maybe because my old girlfriend doesn't act like a ten-year-old fighting to be king of the playground on a daily basis?"
Natasha shrugged and said, "Why can't it be both?" before she popped the door to the driver's side and slid in behind the wheel.
Barnes eyes lit up like a child's on Christmas morning, and he turned to Wilson and said, "Oh, you don't say?"
She made a face like she wasn't quite sure what to say, and Tony said, "How 'bout just 'Tony,' seeing as that's still my name? I know that's not the name I booked it under, but, whatever."
"Yeah," Barton said, "and now that you're married, I can call you 'Stony' and not feel stupid about it. I mean, I didn't feel stupid before, but now it's legally true."
Thor chuckled, loud and hearty. "My friend, there truly is so much about the universe you have yet to learn."
think you could do a lot worse than Captain America. And besides, you're not getting any younger, Tony. Clock's ticking, man."
"You really want to do this?" Steve asked, arms folded on the table as he looked at the bottle like an obstacle to be overcome.
But the man just said, "Don't look like much of a 'Spare Parts Man,'" and turned to the woman beside him, who picked up an oversized purse from the floor and unzipped it, pulling out a thin box that would have fit a stack of 8x10s.
Steve shook his head to clear his thoughts, and he glanced over at Tony just as Tony glanced up at him. Their eyes met for only the briefest of moments — Tony really did have such beautiful, expressive eyes — before Tony turned his attention back to his work and said, "You don't have to hang around here if you don't want to, you know."
"Look, Tony, I don't know what your Steve would say in this situation. I only know what I can say and how I'd feel about… Look, I don't have much experience with this sort of thing. I'm guessing if you really know me like you think you do then you already know that. But I'm not the kind of guy to waste my time. I wouldn't be with someone, I wouldn't marry them and have a family with them purely out of pity. I'd do all that because I loved them and I wanted to be with them. I'd do it because I'd realized I'd finally found the right partner, no matter how much older than me he was or appeared to be. I don't know how you and I met. I don't know how I can be ninety-seven and still look like this. But I do know that if I married you, I was planning on sticking with you the rest of my life, for better or worse. By the way, is it legal?"
"Hopefully not too long," the doctor said, smiling as she stood at Bruce's free elbow and directed him where to focus the image. "Are you two going to want to know the sex of the baby?"
It was stupid to cry about. He knew it was stupid to cry about. There were worse things to cry over in life, and he could still hear his fucking father's voice in his head lambasting him,
Tony winced away from him as if burned by his proximity, and a mask washed over his face. Steve hadn't even realized Tony hadn't been wearing one until the moment it reappeared. "Yeah, no, wouldn't want him to—" He coughed and went back over to his computer console. "I'm sure he didn't. I mean why would he? I just showed you—" He began to tap and swipe at screens, and Steve noticed he was very badly giving a nonchalant impression of trying not to look at him. "You good? You got what you needed?"
Steve just settled Olivia into the crook of his arm and wiped her mouth and chin off with her bib. "Honey, I don't think she did it on purpose."
"Steve, are you feeling OK?" And now there was concern written over the man's — Tony, it seemed — face. "You've been acting kind of odd ever since I woke up." He smiled a little. "Even for you."
Out of the corner of his eye, Steve caught Jim nodding his head in agreement before he said, "On one hand, it's weird, but on the other hand, it's sort of nice knowing Tones got his own kind of sugar daddy that isn't just looking for a way to, you know, steal his inventions from him or kill him in his sleep. Or both."
Tony just paused, mid-sip of coffee, and said, "Yeah, sure, whatever. Just tell me how many tickets you need, Mad Max."
"Hey!" Steve said, his face going serious. "I won't have you talking about the mother of my child that way."
Some more really, really, really bad porn in this one. No, I mean it. It's really bad. My previous attempts were eloquent works of poetry compared to this. It's also gets into a bit of the Dom/sub stuff, though nothing as hardcore as I've seen in some other fics.
"It's public sex for them!" Barton called out, evidently not as removed from the conversation as he'd made himself out to be. "All that bickering is just a way for them to fuck in front of the rest of us."
How are you stuck carrying boxes while the one with the bionic arm gets to sit in the car and laugh at you?"
Hands still enjoined, Tony finally allowed Steve to meet his gaze, and Steve saw then years of hurt and pain clouding those gorgeous brown irises. Tony had always marveled at the beauty of Steve's eyes, but Steve had never seen it. No, to him, Tony's eyes were the most beautiful things he'd ever seen: dark, mesmerizing, soft and warm when he was happy and hard and piercing when he'd been crossed, and lined with inky black lashes that looked like they had been done up with five coats of mascara but were just naturally that way. Steve had gladly stared at those eyes for hours, memorized their every curve and crinkle, sketched them, painted them, and dreamt about them. Tony was a gorgeous man inside and out, but for Steve, it was the eyes that did it every time.
, he realized as Steve returned, slurping down his own glass of punch as he handed one over to Tony. Tony took it and nodded his thanks, and after Steve had drained half his glass, he smiled a little sheepishly and said, "You're not mad at me, are you?"
"He sees you as the fair maiden that you are and understands you to be thick with his child," Thor said.
He stumbled off, gasping once more for a breath he just couldn't seem to get, and he fumbled over to a worktable and grabbed onto it, bracing himself against it, holding fast to it, his fingers turning white from the pressure as he gripped the edge.
"Trust me, Barton's torment will definitely be. I may end up with an arrow in the ass for it, but it'll be worth it."
He pushed his chair back and struggled to his feet, but Steve snagged his wrist and pulled him back before he could get two steps away from the table.
"Wait, do we ever let you out of our sights?" he asked, a weird constricting feeling settling in his chest. Good god, if this had been his daughter, he wasn't sure he'd ever be able to let her get more than three feet away from him at any time.
Bruce squeezed his eyes shut and shook his head, and Hill frowned and pushed closer to him, gingerly sitting down on the bed beside him. "Tony, I know it's difficult, but—"
The little girl still babbling in his arms, he adjusted her so he was holding her with only one arm then reached out a free hand to the bookcase.
"Two 'signs' that are scientifically unproven," he replied, pulling the glass away from his lips and setting it back down on the table.
"You have a ridiculously high libido that, let's be honest, I'm going to have a very hard time keeping up with when I get older."
Pepper just sipped her drink. "Are we talking actual kill counts or those video game competitions I hear so much about?"
The broad smile had let to leave her face. "The King prefers to be taken by his Chancellor. Normally, the man cannot conceive. Give this to him, and he will."
She smiled, a small, coy, and yet somehow honored sort that revealed more than she'd intended it to. "Well, I guess I'll wear that badge with pride."
"Yeah, all right," he muttered, and Steve patted his arm and then was off. "And a swizzle stick!" he called out as Steve made for the bar, raising his hand and giving him a thumb's up to signify that he heard him.
"I don't know," he said and tilted his head as he looked at a sketch for Natasha's Widow's bites. That didn't look right, did it? Was
Bruce just smiled at them, a soft, knowing sort of smile that Steve took particular notice of. "No, it's fine. I, uh, forgot what I needed to bring, anyway. I'll be back in an hour or so."
"The beaches of Midgard are a most glorious thing, though—" His beatific face clouded over some. "It is such a shame how few of your Midgardian brethren are able to tread water and must so often be rescued from its deadly clutches."
Steve didn't want to say he looked hopeful — he hated what that said about himself — but he did look like he was hoping Steve would take him up on the offer. His mouth was a little hard, but there was something shining in his eyes, and Steve didn't think it was merely the streetlight bouncing off of them.
Tony startled a little at the sincerity of Steve’s words. “Uh…” he said, blinking, like he wasn’t sure how to take what Steve had said.
He nestled back into that crook of the couch between the back and the arm and motioned for Steve to cuddle up against him. Steve raised an eyebrow and said, "You sure?"
He nodded again and turned back to his breakfast, and when he glanced up to look in Barnes's direction, he saw an eclectic combination of emotions crossing his face: old-school pride that his pal had scored himself a catch—
Steve summed up the courage to meet Tony's gaze again and said, "My best friend's dead because of me," and rather than the shock or disgust that he figured would be Tony's reaction, instead, he got understanding.
"Not particularly," Steve said before he began to pull the main bulk of the highchair out of the box.
He leaned down and rubbed his shin where Natasha had slammed her foot into it, and the guy put his hand on Tony's back and said, "Hey, you know what's good for that?"
"Look, Tony," Bruce said, and Tony pulled his hands away from his eyes at the note of unease and hesitance he heard in Bruce's voice.
Steve glanced around the room again and began noting entrances and any structural weaknesses that could be—
Natasha just shot a look at Bruce, but Bruce didn't shrink away and instead held his ground as he said, "You know it would be."
"Yeah, don't think so, Atlas," Tony said and pushed him back down by his shoulders. "You stay on that fucking bed until you're ready to come to your senses."
He stopped and looked at Tony like he was trying to figure if Tony understood what he was trying to say. When Tony just stared right back at him, he sighed a little and continued.
Steve could only shake his head, still evidently of the belief that Tony was flat-out lying to him about how painful nursing was.
"Be good," Steve murmured then turned to DUM-E, who was still trying to hide behind Steve for protection. "And that goes for you, too."
So, he made a 'hmm' sound but said nothing to that, and he went back to relaxing in his seat as Steve zipped them up what had turned into the Henry Hudson Parkway, enjoying the comfortable silence the drive afforded them.
Tony shook his head. "No need. I believe you. Now, go out there and reminisce about all the good old days."
But the doctor didn't waver in her sunny attitude. She merely said, "Well, how about we just go over some of the usual stuff? I see you…" She frowned at whatever she saw on her tablet. "I see you filled out
"Nothing could be further from the truth," Steve said, more flashes going off around them. "Tony Stark and I are in a committed relationship with one another and have vowed to stand by each other through thick and thin, for better or worse, forever and ever."
"What?" she asked again, and Tony realized then that they were alone, that Bruce and Barnes had gone somewhere else in the time he'd been dealing with the contraction.
"You're honestly not the least bit concerned about us being out here, in the woods, in the dark, by ourselves?"
He smiled down at the baby that was staring up at him with her big, dark eyes. "Daddy didn't carry you for nine months, now did he?"
"You stupid son-of-a-bitch!" he cried as Steve enveloped him in a bear hug. "You scared me— I thought you were dead!"
," Steve practically hissed at him, and Tony winced back a little at his rather harsh tone. Steve seemed to understand that he'd gone a little overboard, and he said, "Sorry, I just— I'm not letting Hydra or anyone else get you. They want you, they gotta go through me, and I'm a stubborn son-of-a-bitch. I don't like people taking what's mine any more than you do, and you're mine. I don't care if you don't think you are. You're mine to protect and defend and love and honor and cherish, and that's that. Hydra or any of them can take what's mine over my dead body, and based on the fact that there were at least half-a-dozen failed programs in the last seventy years designed to replicate the super soldier program, I have a feeling for their aims, they'd very much want me alive."
Bruce heaved out a breath then said in a quiet voice, "Tony, you were literally blessed by a fertility goddess from space that is under the impression that you and Steve are soul mates, and as soul mates, this is what you need to complete your bond. You're not going to hemorrhage, and you're not going to die, but you probably have at least a day of this left — if not longer. So, please, just go and design a new suit or something for Steve and let nature take its course. I promise the second I get a moment, I'll come check on you. I've already asked JARVIS to monitor your vitals and alert me once he determines that you've probably moved onto the active stage, which, I'm sure you've read, you will definitely be aware of. OK?"
Barnes nodded then said, "Well, you're Steve's, and for all intents and purposes, that makes us family."
"When I was a woman, Steve knocked me up. He didn't do it intentionally. Neither one of us thought about that. We were idiots, I know that now, all right? I already got enough shit from the peanut gallery over that. Anyway, Steve knocked me up, and you know that crazy cosmic lady I was telling you about? She's fucking nuts. She's some sort of goddess of fertility or something like that. Anyway, she turned me back into a woman so I could carry the fetus to term without it causing too many problems, because, let's face it, my other body?
Tony pulled the mug out of the microwave. "She just thinks Friday is better. It's what she's used to."
you are, but trust me, that body is completely female, and I'd just like to make sure it's as perfect as it appears to be."
Steve nodded. "They are, and I…" He met Tony's eyes. "I already asked Nat, and she hesitated a bit on the answer, so I already know the answer to it, but did you… Did you know you were in labor before I left for that mission?"
Tony just snorted a slight laugh. "Look, Cap, if there's one person on this planet that's allowed to dick around for an unspecified amount of time to 'find himself,' I think it's the poor schmuck that got pulled out of the ice that was his tomb for seventy years. Fuck, you think I'd be adjusting any better if someone threw me seventy years into the future? Or worse — seventy years into the past? I know I like to tout myself as a futurist, but I'm pretty much useless without Pep or Rhodey there to kick my ass. If I lost them…"
to build weapons. Thought maybe Uncle Sam was secretly trying to kill us all. Steve told me he married Stark's kid, I thought, all right, whatever. Not my business what he does behind closed doors. But then he says Stark's kid is gonna work on my arm?" He laughed in disbelief. "Fuck, I almost started running again. Figured if Stark's kid was as bad with this shit as his old man was, I'd probably blow up like something out of a cartoon."
"No," Tony said with a contemplative sigh. "Just an observation. I guess I can live with it until you leave me for someone younger and more attractive."
Steve stole a glance over at him as he snapped the box shut. "Well, my date kinda looks like a knockout. Don't want to embarrass him in front of the guests."
Tony groaned and rubbed his hands over his face. "Sure, sure," he said finally. "Yeah, no, I totally get it. Magic lady thinks Steve and I need a kid to 'complete' us or something like that." He turned to Thor. "Hey, didn't she see you there? How come you and Jane aren't dealing with something like this right now instead of me and Steve?"
"Yeah," Tony said and flipped through a few more pages of provocative drawings. "I don't think they're as nice as these—" he added before stopping short at what was probably the first drawing Steve had done of 'Antonia,' and he frowned at the image of himself sitting at his computer, hair pulled up into a ponytail and wearing a tank top, breasts clearly unsupported by a bra (Steve really had a thing for his tits), one arm hugged around his waist while his other hand was fisted and pressed against his mouth. His brows were drawn, his eyes, even in pencil, giving the impression of being swollen and red, his face splotchy and tear-stained.
Steve stormed off the elevator and into the Tower’s basement garage, the sounds of that God awful racket people insisted was called ‘music’ thumping mildly in the vast expanse of the enclave.
"Don't suddenly turn modest on me now," Tony said as he stood away from the desk and held his arms out so JARVIS could get a good read on his body. "I need you to take a look-see and see if you find anything funny."
He shot a glance at where Olivia sat enraptured by some kid's cartoon, and he took hold of Rhodey by his elbow and led him over to the kitchen to allow for some more privacy.
"Oh," Tony said, "is she telling you all about her plans to be the third Stark to attend MIT? Legacy, Steve. She'll be a legacy enrollee — but the good kind that actually deserves to be there and not some idiot that's only there because Daddy has a lot of money."
"Not bad," Steve said with a shrug. "Haven't seen him in a while. There was some talk about him buying a farm —
He bowed his head and kissed Steve again, searing, hot, and he leaned his weight into Steve and pushed him back against the bed.
Steve went to ask what 'Dummy' or his (its?) chassis was, but Tony continued as they made their way back into the living room.
Welch shrugged, but he pushed himself to his feet. "I would just…be careful if I were you. The craziest ones weren't Hydra at all."
She left with a smile and closed the door behind her, and Tony stared after the door for a good, long minute before he said, "
"I guess not," she said with a laugh. "Not much here about any genetic predispositions." She glanced up at Steve. "Would you mind if I asked a little about your history? Your, ah,
God, this didn't make any sense. Visitors from other realms, dead super soldiers coming back to life, unassuming scientists that could turn into giant, green rage monsters, portals to other worlds. He could accept that. He could deal with that. He could work his mind around those things. He could figure them out. This? This he couldn't figure out for the life of him. It didn't make sense. It was wrong.
Tony waved him off and chewed his own bite of food. "No biggie," he said through his mouthful. He swallowed and took another bite, and Steve went over to the fridge and grabbed the container of orange juice. In the light afforded by the opened fridge, Tony watched as he opened it and drank straight from the carton, and he swallowed his bite and said, "I hope you didn't offer your pal any of that."
He shrugged. "Mostly think I wouldn't ever want to be in your shoes. I still don't know about this whole her being your daughter thing, but if you believe it, then that's good enough for me."
Tony shrugged some, but he squeezed Steve's hands as he did it. "A little, I guess. And that was corny as fuck, by the way. Yeah, go ahead and laugh. That was probably the corniest thing ever to come out of your mouth."
Still, Tony forgot about the whole endeavor until Steve showed up that afternoon while he was sketching ideas for some sort of stretchy pants that Bruce could wear that would grow and shrink with him as needed. They exchanged pleasantries with each other, and DUM-E zoomed over to Steve once Steve produced the little bouncy ball he had hidden behind his back, and Steve said 'hello' to him, patted his arm, and then threw the ball in the opposite direction of anything valuable. DUM-E zoomed after it, beeping and whirring with delight, and Tony twitched his mouth and pursed his lips and said, "You're just giving him exactly what he wants."
"Not good," Hill said as she looked at her tablet again. "They can't predict when they'll get the power back on." She looked up at Steve and then Tony. "Could be days."
Tony propped his leg up on Steve's thigh and pulled his pant leg up. "I take it I should shave, too?" he said, revealing a leg that had clearly not seen a razor in months.
Tony stared at him, blinking, feeling like he'd actually gone and blown a fuse in his head. Here was Steve — beautiful, beat-up,
He listened to the sounds of Tony thumping around upstairs before he heard the telltale sounds of Tony dashing back down the steps, but as soon as he hit the doorway to the living room, his slowed his motions and made like he was coolly and casually strolling back into the room, that little black device in his hand.
"Oh, I'm sorry," Steve said like he was humoring him, the bastard. "Also because you can't bear to let yourself admit that Clint could be right about something."
"Really know how to stoke a man's ego," he muttered and got up to dig some glasses out of the cabinet.
That seemed to bring Steve back, and he scowled and said, "Yeah, my ailments and your taste for alcohol."
that Steve was alive. He thought he did, anyway. Maybe it was hormones. Maybe it was his body's way of keeping calm and focused while he was trying to shove a person out of it. But even now, he still
He stood straight and facing the mirror, and he watched as Steve bowed his head and brushed the tip of his nose against Tony's shoulder before he kissed the spot and added, "When you were...in your other form, you were beautiful. I mean you were absolutely stunning. But what made you feel like you were still
"You're nesting, Stark," Barton said and flopped down on the couch. He frowned as he considered its new position then said, "Actually, I think this is better."
Steve felt the bottom fall out of his stomach, and the pointer on the mouse shook as he tried to maneuver it over the link to click. He didn't know why it should bother him. It had been years since he'd last seen Tony, and he wouldn't exactly say their breakup had been amicable, but some stupid little voice in the back of his head had urged him time and again not to let his torch burn out. They were young and dumb and things could change for the better.
"We're never going to live down that 'cutest couple' thing. I mean, the rest of the world's already forgotten about it, but not those assholes. Nope, we'll be the 'cutest couple' until the day we die."
He shrugged but said nothing, and Steve leaned back some and turned him gently to face him in the dim light of the room.
And then, in a flash, he was through the portal and gone, and the strange hum of energy and vibration was gone along with the delightful little chirps of the unconditional love Tony had quickly grown accustomed to over the last forty-eight hours. He stood, staring, at where the portal had been just moments before, waiting for it to open back up again, waiting for Olivia to come dashing  through—
Bucky, Steve noticed, stayed oddly quiet throughout the conversation, staring at his plate and pushing his food around without eating any of it.
"I understand that, Tony," he said, though he felt himself weaken just the slightest at the mere thought of his daughter and the fact that he had always promised himself that, if he we were ever lucky enough to have children, he would provide to them everything he had never had himself, college included.
"And it was very thoughtful of you. You're still more of a bother than a help in the kitchen though."
"Yeah, it sucks. I have to…squirt water on myself. Yeah, that really does as good a job. You know what's been coming
Steve nodded and, without a word of protest, pushed away from the table and got out of his seat. He dropped his napkin to the side of his plate then helped Tony out of his chair. Then, instead of leading Tony quietly and discreetly out of the ballroom, he instead went over to Natasha and said, "Did you get it?"
"Jesus," he muttered with an exhaled breath. "Wait— Eighteen hours?" He looked down at the clock on his computer. "How the hell long have I been down here?"
, and honestly, that was OK. He felt used by Steve but in the best kind of way, the kind that was empowering, the kind that said, yes,
Steve merely nodded, and Esmeralda stepped back and said, "Until we meet again, Captain," and, in a flash of lavender and amber, was gone.
"Of course you do," Tony said, though it sounded like he was humoring him. "Look, we're not going to have the same exact kind of relationship with her. I mean, we share in the responsibilities. I feed her but you're the one that gives her a bath. Believe it or not, you have better luck diaper- changing than I do, but I have an easier time getting her dressed. We both put her to bed or get her up in the morning. But I'm just— We don't have a nanny because you don't trust anyone outside of the other Avengers or ourselves with her. We tried to hire one once, and you found so many flaws with the applications that I just gave up. I don't even think Mary fuckin' Poppins would have passed muster with you."
Steve just shrugged at him. "You never know. And what do you mean bring me back to life? What, like Frankenstein's monster?"
They couldn't even be bothered with the illusion of humoring him, and instead, Natasha spread some jelly on a slice of toast and said, "So, what are you planning on wearing for your big day?"
Bruce looked between them, almost like he wasn't sure which one to listen to, and Tony turned to Steve and said, "
"Of course!" the woman said, smiling like it was obvious. "Eldorado's gold and the fountain of youth rolled into one. The attempts to recreate it have left…something to be desired. Nothing can ever compare to the original formula."
But Steve ignored him and continued, "—and I think it might be a good idea for both of us. If we're really doing this thing." He went quiet a moment and turned to look at him. "Are we really doing this thing?"
The most annoying sound in the world pulled him from his memories, and he sat at attention and shook his head, and he looked down at his phone to see the alarm he'd set for himself. Shit. Good thing he'd set it. He'd hate to be late for work at the museum. Again.
"Yeah, it kind of is," Tony countered then shrugged. "Oh, well. What are you going to do? So!" He looked at Bruce. "Doctor Banner, seeing as my husband is a fucking killjoy pain-in-the-ass — and, at this moment, not in the
Thor glanced between the two and said, "I am sorry, my friend," he said, the words coming out quiet and a touch humbled. "I see no way around it. The Goddess Esmeralda will not remove the spell that binds one life to the other."
Tony snorted a laugh. "Life? Creation? Yeah, I think I've got more blood on my hands than Steve ever will."
He shrugged some but said nothing, and Pepper frowned again and said, "But why? I mean, why is she forcing you to do this?"
He thought about that a moment, thought about growing old — actually growing old — with Tony, both of them wrinkled and gray-haired and shuffling along and spoiling their grandchildren. He smiled a little at this — some dumb fantasy of him and Tony rattling around a small house away from the city, grandchildren running around and asking earnest and wide-eyed questions about the superheroics of their younger days.
He turned to him, taking in the sight of Tony's brow-knitted concern and...embarrassment? Unease? Fear? Clearly, Tony thought he'd done something wrong.
"We thought this place would be safe from Hydra's grasp. We thought even they wouldn't bother with anything here. We thought this could be a place where we could be just 'Steve and Tony' and not 'Captain America and Iron Man.' And with this one," he again motioned to the toddler on his lap, who was whining and struggling to get over to the bevy of gifts, "we thought it could be someplace we could… If things ever got bad enough, at least there would be this."
Tony jumped back and said, "Shit, Steve!" then got up and disappeared from the room. Steve just stared down at the remnants of his drink and tried to slow his pulse and his breathing from their heightened alert.
"Just going upstairs to slip into something less sweat-on by douche-bros. Pep and Hill probably wouldn't want me burning their clothes, right?"
," Steve said in that stupid, soft voice that he used when Tony was being unreasonable about things, "they like hanging out here with us."
"Yeah? Sometimes, you're as bad a liar as you claim I am. Why are you mad at me? Is it because of Bucky?"
The radio, he realized when he'd finally been able to swallow his heart back down to his chest. They were on the radio. He sat up just the slightest, hand still on the back of his neck, and stared in awed confusion at the radio. Awed confusion turned to horror when the guns gave way to a choir of voices singing a verse of 'O Tannenbaum.' He gasped out several breaths as he realized this was it. This was the signal. This was the sign. They'd got him. It had taken them the whole day, but they'd got him right where they wanted him. It had been a trick. The whole thing, the whole crazy thing — Tony, Olivia, the Avengers — had been nothing but a slow-burning trick, and he'd fallen for it, taken the bait hook, line, and sinker.
"Shit!" he yelled and just cleared the steel as it came down beside him, and that was enough to turn Steve's attention away from Barnes and toward him. Tony looked up just in time to see panic come into Barnes's eyes as he looked between Steve and Tony, and Steve glanced to Tony then back to Barnes, and in that split second, another girder came crashing down, trapping Tony flat on his back beneath it.
The term of endearment gave Rhodey pause, but only for a moment before he became even more resolute than before.
And that, maybe more than anything, warmed his heart in ways he wasn't sure he could describe. He took a breath and tried to right this ship before it completely sailed off-course.
As Tony relaxed against him, he looked out to the glittering city before them, and he said a little prayer of 'thanks' to the fates that had allowed him to meet this man, to marry this man, to have a family with this man.
Tony arched and eyebrow at him. "Really starting to get the feeling my robots and AI like you better than they like me."
Rhodey shot a glance at an oblivious Olivia then said, "I'm not sure we should discuss that in front of your kid."
"It's your own fault," Bruce said. "You and Steve are too lenient with her. You let her walk all over you."
you," Bruce replied with a slight roll of his eyes. "Somehow, I don't think he'd want us discussing this."
"Nothing like that," he assured with a laugh. "Just...did some thinking. Realized how lucky I am. How much I love you and appreciate everything that you do."
Steve sucked in a breath then nodded. "You're right," he agreed. "I probably wouldn't be able to handle it as well as you. In fact, I know I wouldn't."
He stopped short, and Steve snorted out an obnoxious laugh and hugged tight arms around him, pressing his face into Tony's shoulder.
"Hmm...you say 'blessing,' I say 'Steve, the poor bastard, is stuck with me until the end of time,'" Tony said without turning away from the pile again.
just ridiculously hormonal. He didn't really know, but what he did know was that he just… He just wanted his friends to care that it was his birthday, that's all.
Tony sat back against the hard vinyl back of the booth but wouldn't look at him. "You know, maybe this was a bad idea?" He pulled out his wallet and began to dig through it. "Look, I'll pay for whatever, just—"
"Yeah," Tony agreed, "except in this guy's case. I mean— Is he old enough? Did Steve run over his cat or something before the war?"
Jesus, they marketed the shit out of the Avengers wherever this kid came from, didn't they? He hoped someone was making decent money off the stuff.
He shot a quick glance over at Tony as though to drive home the sincerity and gravity of his words. Tony met his eyes and held them a moment before Steve turned his attention back to the road.
After, Bruce put a diaper on her, and Hill provided a soft pastel pink blanket to swaddle her up in. He watched as Hill lay the blanket flat at the foot of the bed, and Bruce lay the baby down on it and then swaddled her up like he was a pro before he handed her back over to Tony, who stared up in amazement at him.
(Never mind that the pioneer women of old would probably laugh at the soft, pampered city slicker they would have considered him to be.)
They went into a small room with a table and a machine similar to the one Bruce had borrowed earlier in the year when he'd first informed Tony of this crazy impossibility, and after the doctor and Bruce settled on what exactly they were doing, the doctor smiled at him and said, "OK, Tony, if you would get up on the table."
He picked up his glass. "What does Barnes think about it? I mean, he claims to remember some of what happened before the whole, uh…Soviet Assassin Era."
"Don't mention it," he said and picked up his tablet again to go back to working on… You know what? It didn't fucking matter. JARVIS would know which suit it was, and he'd ask him later when he actually gave a shit.
And then, he breathed out the one word that Tony, deep down, could have gone the rest of his life without hearing.
"Of course he will," Romanoff — Natasha — replied. "Steve's a martyr with a hero complex and an ego the size of Texas. Of course he'll lay all the blame on himself." She tweaked a smile and ran light fingers through Tony's hair, brushing it away from his forehead. "Tony can do no wrong," she mused.
Tony dropped his hand in surprise and sucked in an audible breath. "You know we haven't done that since—"
"At you. Which brings me back to my point. The way Steve looks at you versus the way Steve looks at everything else."
Steve shrugged. "Well, you could always go down there and try to convince the clerk you're really Tony Stark.
Steve just nodded and watched Tony carry Olivia up the stairs. Halfway up, it seemed her giggles had turned into slight whines, and by the time they got upstairs, Steve was certain he heard a full-on cry.
to through stylish leather gloves, "— like that. You're not in a hurry to go back to the house, are you? We could walk around town and look at the lights like the disgustingly domestic couple that we are."
The three exchanged glances again, and Natasha looked knowingly at the other two and said, "Hormones."
Tony returned her smile before he turned to Steve, who stood there stony-faced with his arms still folded. He swallowed and nodded, and he cleared his throat some and said a quiet, "Excuse me," before he turned and made his way up the steps, taking them two at a time as he dashed up, and Tony frowned and watched after him until he'd gotten to the top, and he turned to Pepper and said, "You know, I really don't think he finds me attractive this way."
Honestly, Steve didn't know why not, but he said, "Because… We must have…known each other for longer than that. Right? I mean, we're both old enough to have known each other twenty years — maybe more than that."
"Hey, I don't mean it as a bad thing," Tony said, seeming to know that his words hadn't exactly brought comfort to Steve. "I just mean it as a... You weren't...bothered...by that sort of mundane stuff. But — hey — I only knew the myth, not the man himself. The 'myth' was fun when I was a kid. The 'man's a lot more fun now that I'm an adult."
He stepped on and hit the button for the floor the Cap used when he was in town, and he expected some sort of question from Olivia when they stepped off onto the floor — so far as she knew, the Cap lived in the penthouse with them — but what he didn't expect was exactly what
Bruce shrugged. "The usual," he replied, and Tony figured he'd ask Natasha later what 'the usual' was because she probably knew better than any of them.
Steve shut the tablet off and set it on the nightstand again, and he reached out and snagged an arm around Tony's waist to pull him against him. Tony went with it, cuddling up against Steve, and Steve brushed light fingertips over his body as he said, "Please. Just…go to an obstetrician? I've been talking about it with Bruce, and he agrees with me—"
He jerked a thumb at Steve to emphasize his point, and Sam turned to Steve and contemplated this a moment before he said, "Maybe off an overpass and onto a passing truck or something. Or maybe a burning ship or whatever."
He blew out a breath and said, "Uh, yeah, I, uh— I said you had a family in that other universe, right?"
"Uh, no, that's all shit you're expected to do if you don't want us to jump ship." He pointed his fork between Steve and Tony and added, "Might be a good idea to get us to sign a non-compete clause. You know, just in case."
Bruce just shrugged some and turned his attention to his drink, and Natasha said, "You don't even have anything picked out just for fun?"
He stopped short and clamped his mouth shut, but even in the dim light of early morning, Tony could see a slight flush creeping over his ears and the apples of his cheeks.
Steve glanced up and tried to hide what he'd been looking at, but Tony sighed and said, "I know, Steve."
Tony just hummed at that — Steve took it as an acknowledgement of what he'd said — and determining that Tony was OK for the moment, he stumbled off to the adjoining bathroom and grabbed a clean and unused towel from the rack there. He wiped himself off before he went back out into the shop, his legs much more cooperative now, and he went over to the table and was about to reach down to clean Tony off when he remembered that Tony...didn't quite look like himself, and he stopped just as he was about to touch Tony and said, "Uh, I, uh, I have a towel here if you want to clean yourself off."
Again, Tony filed that away for future reference then said to Barton, "I don't think someone whose resting face looks like they're contemplating murder is in any position to talk about being miserable."
"Yeah, anyway," Barnes aid and turned his attention to Tony. "Is he blaming himself? Yeah, but that's the kind of guy Steve is. Does he think this is all his fault? Yeah. Does he think all of your pain and misery can be traced back to him? Sure."
For all the progress that Bucky had made, and for as close as he'd seemingly become with Nat and Clint and Sam in the months since he'd stopped running and had come to live at the tower with them, Steve was all too well aware that there was still a long way to go before Buck was anything close to, well, normal again. He knew and he understood that the James Buchanan Barnes that now stood in his living room was not quite the same Bucky that he'd known all those years ago — and if he didn't 'know' it for absolute certain, he was getting there day-by-day — but Bucky had spent decades as someone else's pawn and puppet. The freedom he'd enjoyed during his run after SHIELD had, for all intents and purposes, been burned to the ground had been the first real independence he'd had since before the war, and Steve didn't want to give him any reason to think he'd traded one group of owners for another.
in time, which…doesn't say a lot for us, but again, not something we've ever had to worry about. New experience. New sensations and all that jazz.
Tony glanced at him then slowed the car and made another turn. "You said it yourself. I look a hell of a lot older than you. I kind of am a hell of a lot older than you."
"Wait," Wilson said and turned to him. "You know 'Klaatu barada nikto,' but you don't know 'Hogwarts'?"
Bucky hummed in thought, shrugging his agreement before he said with a flicker of mischief in his eye, "Or your goddaughter."
, Tony," Bruce said, and Tony flipped him off before he got to the top of the steps and went over to his bedroom. He lay down on the bed, curling up on his side, Steve's pillow tucked between his legs, and closed his eyes.
Tony set his own helmet down, and he went over to Steve and reached up to put his gauntleted fingers to Steve's face and said, "Honey, it's OK. You'll get him next time."
Tony winced and pulled the phone away from his ear to look at it. The screen turned back on, and Pepper's smiling face stared back at him, a static photograph of a happier time, evidently, and he frowned and tucked the phone back against his ear. "Sorry," he murmured. "I just thought—"
Tony yawned, exhaustion suddenly hitting him like a ton of bricks, but he brushed it off and said, "Uh, don't you have a company to run?"
But Tony just shrugged himself out of his own overcoat and hung it up on the hook next to where he'd hung Olivia's. "Eh, shit happens," he said. "Happens to us more than most, but I'm learning to live with it."
"You already did know. Don't pretend like I never got drunk and overshared my deepest, darkest teenage fantasies with you."
Tony watched him a moment then frowned a little and said, "This isn't about what Asshole Welch said last night, is it?"
"Sedative," was all he said, and Tony, knowing he was in horrible pain but not seeming to care at the moment, frowned up at him and slurred out something that was supposed to be, "Did you save me?"
. Except for the time that you did, and Unca Bucky had to help you get it uncaught, and you told Unca Bucky not to say anything to Daddy, and Unca Bucky said,
"All right, Tony," Bruce said, the unit already set up as he wheeled it over to the bed in the medical lab. "Let's get this over with."
"Well?" he said, his tone light and innocent. "It is." When Tony still didn't budge, he sighed, and he squeezed Tony's hands and said, "All right. Fine. When we get back, I'll give you a full-body massage, and maybe we can see if there's someplace around here to get ice cream. How's that sound?"
Tony hummed in thought a moment then said, "If you're asking if I fantasize about Captain America on his knees with his mouth stretched over my cock—"
It was in Steve's nature to bristle and fight against that accusation — to pull away and look Tony in the eye and make him understand under no uncertain terms that that wasn't in any way true and he was never going to leave Tony because he got too 'old' for him.
So, instead, he put his hands to Tony’s shoulders and kissed his forehead. “Don’t go anywhere. I’ll be right back.”
Steve just grunted a bit, none too amused by Tony's musing. "And they're the most dangerous ones. People like that don't give up after one catastrophic setback. They keep going—"
Jim had a flat look on his face that said he didn't buy a word of what Thor was saying, but Natasha was the one to say a low and cool, "He knew what he was doing."
Tony turned and smiled in greeting at the lovely and charming Doctor Jane Foster, who stood there looking up at him, a glass of punch in her hand and a smile quirking her lips.
"It's not important," he said, the manner all 'Captain America.' "Tony has to show me some improvements he wants to make to our communications system out in the field—"
Steve exhaled a breath and looked at Tony. "And what better place to do something like that than in a secluded supermax prison," he said then turned to Welch. "Is that why you've been beating that drum?"
He expected some sort of face and comment about that not being a visual he needed, but Barnes just sat there, seemingly nonplussed by Tony's comment. Which…wasn't any fun. Jesus, what was the point of making these comments if no one was going to react to them in any meaningful way? Jeez, where were Barton and Bruce when he needed them? They would have whined over that comment.
"That's Ma's handwriting," he said then turned to look at Tony. His eyes had gone a little red in addition to being watery, stubborn droplets clinging to his long eyelashes, and he choked out a laugh as he looked at Tony and said, "You really— You found these for me?"
Bruce took a deep breath and repeated, "She's your daughter," like he was trying to follow Tony's train of thought and wasn't quite following.
Bruce sighed out a breath and stood in front of him. "Tony, it's natural. It happens every day. There's nothing to be embarrassed about."
"You sold us out," Barnes said, sounding almost brokenhearted, the hard lines of his face going soft in his hurt — or his pretend hurt, at any rate.
"Jesus, Stark," he said with a loud groan and dropped it with a 'thud.' "How the fuck heavy is this thing?"
"He's not in this country, as far as we can tell," Natasha said as she smeared a thin layer of cream cheese over her bagel. "Outside of that, we're running into a dead end. He's dropped off the radar—"
"We're not disgusted," she reiterated. "We just like picking on you for it. It's actually kind of sweet."
He motioned over Tony like it explained the whole thing, and Tony went a little petulant at that, pursing his lips and folding his arms. "They're called 'lifts,' all right? A lot of guys use them."
"But I'm just saying," Bruce continued in his normal logical and even way. "Doctors like to encourage vaginal deliveries. They really only like to do cesareans if they absolutely have to."
Bruce sighed like Tony was asking him to commit highway robbery. "Tony, I'm not that kind of doctor. How many times have I told you that?"
They followed the nurse back not to an examining room, but to the doctor's personal office. Tony had a feeling this wasn't standard procedure, but he kept his mouth shut about it and went along with it.
Tony clicked the button to begin the online application. "Yeah, keep it up there, chuckles. You may be marrying Natasha Carbonell just yet."
— was what Steve was going to see? Going to live with? Going to sleep with the rest of his life? This broken down old bag of bones?
Tony pulled his hand from behind his back to reveal the black, bejeweled collar he hadn't donned in months, and Steve took in an audible breath as his eyes went from Tony's face down to the small band of leather in his hand.
, holding each other's gazes, giving each other cute and coy little smiles before Other Tony said, "You're not funny."
“Helluva mouth for someone tied up and bent over a table with a plug sticking out of what I take it is a nicely-prepped ass.”
," Steve murmured, but Tony smiled a little plaintively at Rhodey and nodded, and Rhodey nodded back and gave his shoulders a little squeeze then said, "Wow, that is— I'm still not used to this being your—"
Steve didn't even acknowledge him. He just tried another route, a more placating tone in his voice as he said, "Can we talk to your supervisor?"
— but just for this, I want to… I want to try it. I want you to be my Antonia. It won't— If you're worried that I'll want you to
Steve looked from the open door down to his bare feet and then to Tony leaning over the seat and looking at him through the open window. He took one last look at his surroundings before he swallowed his pride and went over to the car.
Steve's hand went firm, his fingers digging in slightly to the covered flesh as he rubbed his hand against Tony's abdomen, and Tony knew then that Steve felt something, too.
Bruce and Rhodey continued to exchange wary looks, but Tony just slapped his hand atop Steve's hand on his knee, and he squeezed it and turned to the others.
"Bear a child? Yeah, unless Thor's full of shit and her hexes aren't that powerful. The fact that I'm currently sitting here with tits and a vagina, however, seems to say otherwise."
Steve made a face. "Well, that's tougher to figure. Ma was always about wanting me to be happy, but Ma was also, you know, old-fashioned—"
taking a birth class! I'm putting my foot down. I went along with that stupid doctor's appointment when I
But Steve just grabbed his tuxedo pants from the bed, and as he shook them out and went to step into them, he went a little serious and said, "You know, there's really no going back after this. Everyone's going to know. Not just people at an art gallery or Twitter. They're going to have camera crews there and everything."
He watched the doors close before he turned back to Esmeralda, who was eyeing her surroundings with interest, and she threw a glance at Steve and said, "A gift from your bonded?"
Tony rolled his eyes. "You're missing my— The point is, yes, the serum gave you that rockin' bod, but the Steve Rogers that's underneath that rockin' bod is still the same, and he is a giant pain in the ass."
Holy shit, what if— What if Esmeralda wasn't an agent of Hydra? What if she was an agent of something even worse?
Tony made a contemplative 'hmm' sound, and he cleaned the excess sugar off the sheet — or actually the paper he'd lined it with — wiping it into the sink, and said, "Good to know you're not sick of us yet."
"What if I wanted to do it?" Rhodey asked, though Tony knew it was simply for conversation's sake and not because he actively wanted to walk Pepper down the aisle at her wedding.
Honestly, though, Steve might have issues with the way others held or dealt with Olivia, but — and maybe owning to the whole him being the one to carry her for nine-and-a-half months and give birth to her — he always deferred to Tony's expertise when it was the two of them. When it came down to it, Tony had to admit that Olivia had definitely been a positive addition to their relationship. They had always gotten along in some way — even when they were measuring dicks on the Helicarrier, Tony couldn't deny there'd been
"Isn't that right, baby girl?" he added, and the little girl said a quiet, "Yeah," as she held fast to the two little plush dolls in her hands and kicked her legs out in front of her.
are going to do your husbandly duty that is expected of every groom on the wedding night and fuck me silly, understand?"
Other Tony stopped abruptly and exchanged a look with Tracy before he turned to Tony. "Uh, well, like I said—"
"I'm not saying they're in love with each other. I'm just saying they want to fuck each other. There's a difference."
was why he loved this man more than anything. Because he always came home bearing gifts from this travels.
"No offense, Tony," Bruce said, "but you seem to have put an awful lot of thought into the Cap's sexual preferences."
"Because! Because I— Because I wanted to go back, but I wanted to stay, all right? Because I wanted it both ways. Because I thought I was supposed to want to turn back. But clearly, our daughter is absolutely miserable at the prospect of living on formula for the next year of her life, and—"
He stopped, pausing in mid-action as he shook the bottle to mix the contents, and decided those were some pretty dark thoughts best left for another day. It was Christmas, after all.
with Howard during the war. Howard made him what he is. He's the real McCoy. I'm the cheap knock-off."
"I don't have 'hotrod red,'" she said as she looked through the line of colors. She selected one small bottle and held it up for his approval. "I hope this will do."
The few droplets that had previously been falling from the sky opened up to a downpour of rain, and Steve couldn't help but burst into laughter at the situation, especially as Tony looked up at the sky and yelled, "Are you fucking kidding me?"
"Yeah, you know how he looks at anything that's not all sunshine and roses as some sort of wartime battle plan to be figured out? His whole thing now is keeping me in perfect health. He didn't even want me going out in the suit until I reminded him that not only am I safer in that tin can than he is in his flimsy little polymer but that I
"I like this song," Steve offered as explanation and used the steering wheel controls to turn the volume up.
Steve just sat there and blinked, and he tilted his head in slight amusement and said, "You never want me to eat breadsticks again."
"OK," she murmured, almost like she was humoring them. But she sobered a little and directed her attention at Tony and said, "Tomorrow, why don't I show you a few things you can do to protect yourself? I know you know how to fight in your other body, but this one's a little different. I don't know if you've got the hang of certain things yet." She shrugged a little. "Might be good to know."
And failing. Miserably. God, when was this going to be over? And when was Steve going to be home? Steve couldn't make it better, but at least he could whine to Steve about it.
Bruce and Thor exchanged glances, and Tony rolled his eyes at their lack of subtlety. "Good job hiding it from me, guys. I take it they've gone to track down my wayward husband."
Tony rolled his eyes. "Hell of a coincidence, babe. What happened to you, what happened to me, her name, when she was born — I'm certain she said she was born at the end of August — it all matches. It all makes sense. It all lines up. It's her. I know it is. I know it."
"Uh, J, that's not exactly the sort of thing you say when you're congratulating someone on their upcoming nuptials."
"It was the Audi, I know it was," Steve said like he was more talking to himself again rather than Tony. "The car we took to…Starbucks, I think it was. And then to the Chinese restaurant later that evening — Spring Palace, I think it was called."
So, they sat and chatted amiably about a host of topics as they stuffed their faces with greasy-but-delectable chow, and Tony wiped his mouth off with a paper napkin then threw it on the table and said, "So, how's the future coming along for you?"
Luckily, his uterus chose to contract at that exact moment, taking his mind off of anything that wasn't the awful pain wracking his body.
"Yeah, no. I like Cap. He's a great guy. Totally trust him with everything I got. Don't think of him
Steve raised an eyebrow. "I know Hydra's in the business of making weapons and trying to find new and interesting ways to take me and the other Commandos out, but whatever they've got going on here seems a little excessive and odd even by their standards."
"Seriously," Steve said after the staff had left them alone again, "you didn't have to do this. We didn't need—"
, no, not a little super soldier. I don't… We're not raising him that way. He's going to have free will and choice and he's not going to have to keep looking over his shoulder because someone somewhere might want to take him and use him for their own gain. Maybe he'll take after the way I am now. Maybe he'll take after the way I was then. I don't know. But he's not just a little super soldier. He's a baby. He's our baby, and that's the way we're going to raise him."
"Full of shit," Tony said in the same matter-of-fact tone Steve had used and pulled the slices of cooked toast off the griddle. Steve snatched the plate away from him before he even had a chance to set it down, and Tony watched as he went back over to the chair he'd been sitting in and settled back in with another plate of French toast and half a container of orange juice. A few thumps hit against the inside of his abdomen, and he looked down and said, "Oh, great. What do you want?"
He took off in a confident stride, and Barnes glanced back at Wilson and said, "This is all your fault," before he got up and followed after Steve, but not before he pulled Wilson off the couch to drag him along with him, Wilson groaning the whole way and saying something about 'his show' coming on soon.
'his' Tony; if 'his' Tony even existed, it was somewhere else in time and space) — had said to him just as he was falling asleep.
He just hugged her, tight, squeezing his eyes shut and letting the tears slide down, and she hummed a tune and rocked him back and forth then patted his back and said, "OK, come on. Lay down on that bed and take a nap. You need one."
He went back to mixing the child-approved concoction, and Rhodey said, "Which you have done nothing to dissuade from the moment she arrived here. And if
"Uh," Other Tony said and furrowed his brow, glancing up to the ceiling in thought, for some reason not thinking Tony's question was in any way not any of his business. "Sixty-seven? I think," he said, turning back to Tony. "Sixty-eight at the end of the year."
"I'm sorry," Steve said as Tony took another sip of his juice. "I used to envy kids that still had their dads. Never thought that having one could be worse than not having one."
"I don't—" he started to say, but Tony stepped onto the elevator and said, "It's not really that interesting."
Tony nodded and went to say something, but the thought flew out of his mind when one particular name on that list finally caught his attention.
Welch, that bastard, just sat down in the seat Pepper had previously vacated. "Oh, but I actually enjoy
He shrugged and scratched off 'spandex' as well. That…was not a sight he wanted to see on either the Hulk or Bruce.
, she decided she'd help us along with that and poof—" He motioned over himself. "Suddenly, I have a fully-functioning set of female reproductive parts just made for the receipt and processing of super soldier semen."
Again, Barnes rolled his eyes so hard that if he hadn't been presumably juiced up with Zola's off-brand serum, he would have done some serious damage to himself.
But Steve just shrugged, and the woman continued, "— are sitting at my desk and trying to convince me that this 'mystery woman' is Tony Stark?"
Pepper just shook her head, and Natasha checked her watch and said, "We better get a move on if we're going to get down there by two-thirty."
You literally ran out of the room this morning right as it came time to start cleaning up the mess that
Steve just shook his head a little. "You looked too peaceful, and I know how hard it's been for you trying to get decent sleep lately. It's fine. Jim says if we ever desperately need an armored division, he's right there for us."
Tony sat down at the table and snapped out his napkin, and he set it on his lap as he looked over the spread of food before him.
"Hey, kid! Smaller sips!" he said and grabbed a towel to mop up the mess with. "Jesus," he muttered and pulled the cup away from her mouth as he wiped her face and neck.
"Denise Ganford," Bruce said and reached up to pinch the bridge of his nose. "You just saw her, like, a week ago."
hummed a little at the contact and pressed Steve's hand harder into his abdomen, the satiating feel of possessiveness thrumming through his veins and doing something to him he couldn't explain. God, he loved this man. He drove him crazy sometimes, but he loved him so, so much. He trusted him. He trusted that if he ever fell, Steve would be there to catch him. He trusted him to make this whole crazy thing bearable for him. Granted, if Space Crazy was to be believed, he wouldn't even
Barnes made a face. "I know they say it's natural, but it still is pretty disgusting." Tony arched an eyebrow at him, and Barnes cracked a slow-spreading grin. "Well, you gotta admit," he said, "it is."
"You do that," he said softly and soon found himself gently swaying with Tony to the easy rhythm of whatever song was now playing quietly in the background. They stayed that way for a few minutes before Tony murmured a sleepy, "Merry Christmas, Steve."
It wasn't as chaste as the last kiss, Tony seemingly feeling much more confident now that they'd both brushed their teeth, and though knowing he was falling right into Hydra's trap, he opened his mouth, allowing Tony's tongue to slip in. Steve hadn't done much kissing in his life. There was that dame —
Steve didn't wait to see what happened next. He turned his head away and closed his eyes, and he twitched at the high 'snickt' sound the clippers made as Tony trimmed the nail.
He glanced down at himself to take stock of the most prominent parts of himself that would be with him for the rest of his life before Steve tugged on his arm a little and led him off the elevator and into the hallway. He glanced at the doors surrounding them to get his bearings then led Tony down the hall and stopped in front of the requisite door. He slid the card in to unlock the door then pushed it open to reveal the vestibule of the small suite, the lights already burning.
Steve, dressed rather enticingly in a deep blue dress shirt and a pair of black slacks that made Tony, in his comfortable gray and black pajamas, feel like a fucking vagrant, took a few slow, hesitant steps in his direction, never taking his eyes off Tony, and sounding like he'd suddenly realized this hadn't been his best idea after all, he said, "I, uh, I wanted to surprise you."
But Barnes, though, oddly enough, fit into the gang of idiots with much more ease than Tony had thought he might enjoy. In fact, Tony had presumed that Barnes would spend most of his time in the penthouse with him and Steve, but he was barely there except for when the others were, seeming to prefer to spend his time with Barton or Natasha or even his
"Then what are we supposed to do?" Tony asked, and Thor's head dropped to his chest as though in defeat.
Tony rolled his eyes and fired off a repulsor blast at another goon that was trying to make a break for it. "Yeah, yeah, we're good."
But Barnes, to his credit, didn't run — just stood there and stared right back, his gaze now focused on Steve instead of Tony. Perhaps feeling emboldened, Steve took one cautious step toward his old friend. When Barnes still didn't turn to run, Steve took another step, and Barnes began to return the favor, taking cautious steps towards Steve as well, his gaze darting around like a nervous and easily-spooked animal on the lookout for any kind of threat.
"Yes, really," she replied, taking Olivia into her arms. "Oh, my god! Look at that face!" she said as she cradled the baby. "I think she's actually disappointed about something."
Steve stopped petting his hair, and he reached down and took a gentle hold of Tony's chin again. He reached up with his thumb and brushed the pad of it against Tony's lower lip, gently, back and forth, almost like he was contemplating something.
It was like all the air had been sucked out of the room at that, and Steve just stared at him, sad- eyed.
Tony raised an eyebrow at him. "Are you kidding me? I've actually embedded sensors into my body for my flying armored suit."
"Take. It. Back," Tony finally said. "I can be Iron Man. You know I can be Iron Man. There's nothing to stop me. Put me back on the team. Say you're sorry. Say you were wrong about kicking me off the team or get the hell out of my sight."
"Barely," Steve said with a scoff. "Bucky was barely in it, the Commandos were barely in it, Peggy wasn't in it at all—"
"OK," Steve said with a chuckle and pressed a kiss to the top of his head. "I get it. I owe you big time for this." And then because Steve Rogers was a shit, added, "...
"It's a movie," Tony explained and grumbled as he tried to figure out some way of carrying the plate of bagels, the cookies, and the mugs without putting everything on a tray. "Actually, a series of movies," he amended and held the container of cookies out to Steve. "Here. Take this."
Tony shrugged as Steve set the box on the desk, and Tony didn't even wait for him to get himself settled before he pulled it open and eyed over the contents.
"I was stuck in a hippy's wet dream learning how to 'breathe' like I haven't been fucking doing it for forty-four years, and they went to the
Steve nodded and did as he was asked, and Tony looked at her and said, "Uh, there a chance people might try to come in or—?"
Tony heard a note of hope in his voice, and he reached over and patted Steve's leg. "I know how much you hate these things, but no, Captain. The people want to meet Captain America. They spent good, hard-earned— All right, they spent money on it. We've got to give them their money's worth."
Tony sighed and put the glass back to his lips again. "OK, got it. Don't die unless Steve goes first. You know, that is a
"I just mean he's a sanctimonious pain the ass. Like, he always thinks he's right about things, and he always thinks his way is the right way, and he's always walking around with that stupid hair of his and those stupid perfect teeth of his and, I don't know, would it kill the guy
Steve stared at him, flat, like he knew exactly what Tony was doing, but he still closed his eyes and exhaled a breath through his nose then opened his eyes again and looked at Bruce.
"I mean, does it suck being kicked out of my own home? Yeah, kinda," he said and reached in, grabbing a large slice of pie. He pulled it out, the mozzarella stringy where it had melted back together after being cut, and he held the slice high to break the cheese, resorting to using his fingers when yanking on the slice just gave him long, thin strands.
But Steve ignored him and said, "Here, doll baby, watch," and began to pull on the phone to tug it around. Olivia watched for all of three seconds before she decided she had to tug it around, too, but either her coordination needed help or she didn't know her own strength, as she tugged it too hard and sent it flipping upside down.
Steve sat quietly for a very long moment, like he was giving the matter serious consideration, before he finally said, "I don't know. Sometimes, I feel like…that's where I belong. I don't belong here. I'm not… I'm not from this time. I understand it, and I can get through it, but it's not… I don't belong here. I don't have the same experiences as the rest of you. I see things differently. I remember things — I
around for miles. No one to hear us scream. No one to help us. No one to call for help. If anything happened to us—"
"I think," Bruce said, and Tony broke contact with Steve to look at him, "that we might have to get in contact with someone at former SHIELD. They're the only ones that would even begin to be able to have any way of dealing with something like this."
Olivia cooed and babbled to herself as Steve pulled the beans out of the cupboard. He closed the door and reached out for the grinder, and he dumped enough beans in to make a strong-enough pot and then ground them up to be relatively fine, taking a glance back at his daughter to see if the loud noise was bothering her. She was staring at the grinder, a confused and somewhat untrustworthy look on her face, and at that moment, the only thing Steve could be bothered to think was, At least she's not deaf.
"He's not here, kiddo. Believe me. Just you and me and Uncle Rhodey. He's not going to get you. I'm not going to let him get you."
"The coffee," Steve said. "Most of the articles agree on no more than twelve ounces a day." He pointed to Tony's coffee. "Pretty sure that's a twelve-ounce cup."
it, but I had to— Look, he didn't want to hurt my feelings. He wanted to be the nice guy, so he let me break up with him. He looked almost
Barnes followed her out of the lab, and Bruce smiled sheepishly at him and said, "You sure you don't need me to stay here with you?"
Steve sighed and turned away from his magazine to look at the sheet. He was quiet only a moment before he said, "Roger Stevens. July four, nineteen seventy-six."
His daughter. His fucking daughter. Not that he'd ever believed — all right not since he was a kid — in a god (OK,
Steve shot him an unhappy look at Tony's characterization of him, but Doctor Ganford just shook her head a little and said, "I'm not asking if you
"No, I won't hold that against him. I'll hold against him that he was a perverted creep with a weird bondage fetish."
But Steve frowned some and said, "Are you sure you wouldn't be happier staying home? You know how tired you've been getting lately."
"Well, at least there's that," Steve said, and Tony pointed a firm finger at the chair. "What? What's that for?"
"I loved Captain America when I was a kid, even when I knew he was this ideal I could never live up to—"
Tony nodded before the end of Barnes's statement caught his attention. "OK, the 'Siberia' thing would have counted for when I asked you earlier if you knew where it was. And second, what do you mean 'the others'?"
"You won't let me install Friday here, so I guess I have to go check on our wee little one the old- fashioned way."
"Hmm?" Tony said, seeming to consider his chest area before he looked up at Steve. "Oh!" he said like he was suddenly remembering something. "Now we have some fun with this."
"I know," he said and half-considered telling Steve to get out of the line and take them anywhere but there, especially since little James Anthony was not in the mood to relax that evening. But they'd already agreed to do this, and they'd agreed to do it
He forced out a laugh. "Yeah, how long have we been saying that? I had him. I fucking had him. I had him, and—"
Because I gotta tell you, there's a part of me that thinks one of you ran over his dog or something."
with!" he said quickly, lest Tony suspect anything tawdry or untoward about what he'd done in the past. "But you're not the first fella I ever…
"Sass-bot," he muttered and picked up the iron again, forgetting that he'd even stopped to question why he had the iron to begin with.
"But you don't." Her eyes went wide and a little soft. "Didja get hurt? Are you hurt, Papa? D'ya need Daddy to come home and kiss it better?"
"Recognized her from some modeling pics she did— I thought that was some bullshit planted by Fury. I didn't think she really modeled."
"You look fantastic," Steve said, cutting off what could have become Tony's directionless defense of his eating habits.
"Liv— Olivia, wait!" Tony yelled and followed after, but he stopped short when he came upon the sight of a semi-bloodied, scuffed-up, and uniformed Steve Rogers scooping Olivia up into his arms, relief emanating from every pore in his body. He clutched tight to her and kissed her cheek before he pulled back and asked her, "Are you all right? You're not hurt, are you?" as he ran a hand over her to search for bumps and bruises. Tony noticed the gloves he wore were brown and fingerless, which seemed an odd choice. At least the colors of his uniform, though still patriotic red, white, and blue, were more subdued and less garish than the fanboy number Agent had stuck him with.
you, Steve. I know your tells. I know how hard you're fighting right now to keep from giving anything away to me. I know you're wondering how I knew that, and I know you're wondering how Hydra knew your deepest, darkest fantasies — and thank you
"Is this really worse than being held captive in a cave in Afghanistan?" Natasha asked, and Tony knew it was her way of trying to give him some kind of perspective on what was happening to him, but no, just—
He grumbled but still took it from her and cracked the cap after she'd taken the empty bottle from him.
Her eyes went wide, and she gasped and put her hand to her mouth. "Uh oh," she said from behind her hand. "I wasn't s'pposed t' tell you. She said you'd get mad and you wouldn't let me stay there no more."
"Don't tell me," he said as she frowned and held the bottle out to him. "Daddy puts ketchup on his eggs."
"Oh, god, he makes a good point," Bruce murmured, but Steve just continued to give Tony that flat look as he said, "Sam's not into fellas, either. Just because two fellas bicker with each other doesn't mean they secretly want to make love to each other."
"Thanks," he muttered, and Tony knew Barnes's comment about the age gap was still sticking in his craw.
She laughed and shook her head a little. "No, my dove, it is not. It took you many years, but you finally found your purpose with your Avengers — and with your Steven, your bonded. He is protector and defender, but you are creator and nurturer. You have forged life from nothing so often you see nothing notable about it. It is second-nature to you. That—
"Oh, great," he muttered and flexed his hand a few times. Steve was right. His hands were smaller, more delicate. "Where the hell did they go?"
Steve exhaled a breath. "Yes, Tony," he murmured after a moment. "I can live with you being like this the rest of our lives. I love you. Whatever shape or size or sex or gender you come in, I love you. Clint said maybe I'm more 'Tony-sexual' than bisexual." He shrugged. "I don't know. I just know that I love
"You know," Steve said, casual, off-handed, as he stuck the fob in the ignition and shut his own door. "I suppose we don't
Tony was the one to break the kiss — Steve usually would keep on kissing Tony as long as Tony would let him — but he pecked a few kisses against Steve's mouth in parting and Steve leaned in and nuzzled his face into Tony's neck.
The King was being obstinate as he was wont to do. He did not see it as a priority to produce an heir to the throne. This may be all well and good now when the King was still relatively young and in good health, but he would not always be so. He also had a bad habit of running off with Sir Steven and his
He followed Steve into the bedroom, and that was where he saw two suitcases set by the foot of the king-size bed.
"I'm sorry, Tony," Steve said, though he wasn't sure it was his smartest move. "I never meant to hurt you."
"Probably doesn't taste the same, either," Tony said and sat down and began to serve himself with the fork and spoon Steve had dropped. A fucking billionaire, and he was eating off a paper plate with plastic flatware all because his husband couldn't be bothered to wash a goddamned dish.

Steve scratched at the back of his head. "They, ah— Any of them around? I mean, any chance we might bump into any of them?"
"Seriously? What the hell's with the sex on the brain all of a sudden? Last night wasn't enough for you?"
"Fingerprints? What? No, no fingerprints!" Tony said. "And you don't even know that they would match! Very little of me matches what came before."
He shook his head, and Tony nodded a little and pulled his jacket tighter as the bus pulled away, splashing some water from the curb up in their direction.
He sighed and relayed the question over the comm, and Tony waited until Barton nodded and said, "Uh huh," before he yelled out, his voice going screechy the way he hated it, "
Still, he was thankful that they had been there for him, but it wasn't… It just wasn't the same as having
Steve just grabbed him by the arms and pulled him so they were facing one another. Tony wouldn't meet his gaze, and he folded his arms and made sure to pout extra noticeably so that Steve would get the drift that he didn't want to fucking talk about this.
"He'll also think you've lost your damned mind bringing Stark along," Barton said. Steve just scoffed and rolled his eyes. "No, he won't."
"Ugh, attacked in my own home," he muttered and shoved half of the remaining half of doughnut into his mouth. It was only then that he realized the others were…packing up to leave?
She just slid one hand from his shoulder down to his back and began to rub it in soft, soothing circles as she led him over to the elevator. "Hormones," she replied simply.
The pain having subsided, he was able to soap up and clean himself off (he never did shower after his water had broken), washing his hair and scrubbing his body and watching as the soap suds swirled down the drain, taking the time to pamper himself and luxuriate in the water (content, of course, that access to the water was under his control and he could shut it off any time he wanted; showers were much easier on his psyche than tub baths were). He didn't know how long he stayed in the shower for, though it was long enough for his fingertips to begin to prune, and after he figured he'd wasted enough time in there, he stepped out and toweled himself off. He wrapped his hair up in a towel and made a face at the hospital gown that sat folded on the sink. It wasn't all that comfortable, and he really didn't want to put it back on, but a quick check of the linen closet showed nothing except towels and other cloths, and with a disgruntled sigh, he slipped the gown back on, fumbling with the ties in the back but getting them eventually, then towel-dried his hair before he pulled the damp tresses up into a high ponytail. Easier than having it frizz and flop around his shoulders, he supposed. He hung his used towels up because he wasn't
"Well, I need something other than 'Nat' or 'Tasha' to call you." He reached out and took hold of Tony's hand and pulled him close, and as awful a picture Steve made at the moment, Tony still put his arms around Steve's waist as Steve put his arms around him. "Makes it sound like I'm talking about our other Natasha. Nata? Natalie?"
"Fine. We'll go get your time machine, and we'll hop on back to 1940 and grab ice cream at the soda fountain."
"That's something I should probably know," Tony said, which earned him rolled eyes from Bruce and a pat on the arm from Romanoff.
"As you wish," she said and touched her finger to her lips. Steve had only a second to think that this could be a mistake — that she could be pulling some other trick on him — and he was about to back away and say maybe he'd take a night or two to think about it when he felt her fingertip press against his lips, and something warm and slightly electric coursed through his body. He sucked in a quiet breath, expecting to find himself flat on his back in the next moment — like what had happened to Tony each time she'd turned him — but instead, the tingle of warm electricity filled him from his head down to his toes and then dissipated.
The doctor just chuckled and said, "Again, I'm sure he was very thorough about it, but I do need to do one for the record."
He liked kids. There was a time when he thought maybe he'd have one or two of his own. But those days were gone, and he was content with the life he had now. Or he told himself he was, anyway. Because science was his first love, would always be his first love, and would always come first. The philanthropy went hand-in-hand with that. He was a doctor. He wanted nothing more to help people. He could help them with his science expertise.
"And sweetheart, don't forget that you…" He frowned some but rubbed soothing hands over Tony's back and shoulders. "You're not turning back."
The Council was silent for a moment, not one man daring to speak, until the second man to speak that night said rather diplomatically, "The King needs an heir. There is no question about that. Were the King to, Heaven forbid, die tomorrow, there would be no God-anointed heir to take his place. It is quite possible and more likely than that
Bruce straightened up and folded his arms some, sighing out a breath. "It's… It's messy," he said like he wasn't quite sure how to describe it. "And it's painful."
"Well, the numbers are supposed to be a date, I'm guessing—" Not that he believed this, but he didn't feel in a position to counter Tony just yet. If he kept him talking, surely he would slip up. "But I don't get the thing that's engraved alongside—"
, honey-bunny! We're both clean and in a committed, monogamous relationship. We never had any use for them. I mean, yeah, sure, maybe to keep the mess down, but to be honest, sometimes, that's—"
it. I don't know what that says about me. Maybe I don't want to know. But I'm enjoying the hell out of this. I know men joke about getting in touch with their feminine side, but I have to say, it's fantastic. Seriously. I know there's a lot of shitty things women go through that I don't really have to worry about — sexism, glass ceiling, that sort of stuff — but the other stuff? Makeup is
that could in the very least put the slightest amount of pressure on my bladder. Yeah, sorry. Didn't mean to ruin the mystery for you."
"You know," he said as he cleaned her off, her eyes closed and her head turned to the side, "you're going to be doing this for me someday. Me and Papa, actually. I promise I'll try to make it easy for you. I make no promises about him."
"Ah," she said and nodded. "I believe your kind has an issue with...er, handouts, I believe you call them?"
Olivia provided no answers, instead choosing to remain quiet as Steve carried her back downstairs, and he made to go into the living room but decided he'd scope out the rest of the downstairs just to see if…
was what he did for her. It wasn't odd to her. It wasn't the sort of amazed elation he felt whenever Howard had deigned to acknowledge him. This was comfort in knowing she was loved and was wanted, in knowing and accepting that her Papa would always be there for her.
So a pump-and-grind on a hot, sweaty, poorly-lit dance floor to music that was making his ears bleed was not exactly the sort of thing he'd call 'fun.' Not anymore. But he still grit his teeth and tried to pretend he was into it as his 'dance partner' pushed close to him, grinding their bodies together as he pushed his dick into Tony's hip. Clearly the guy was trying to entice him, show off to him, make him want to take that in him any way he could get it, but he'd had a semi-erect dick pushed into his hip not all that long ago, and this one, through the fabric of the man's denim jeans…was not anything to write home about.
This was…not something he was willing to accept, but it was something he was willing to work with. Sort of. OK, he was willing to piss and moan about it.
Tony frowned and watched as Steve yawned and went to grab his running clothes. "Uh, what did I just say about you
"I'm not really sure sometimes," Tony said and reached out to grab a cup of coffee. "Which one had which one in a headlock?"
He turned his attention to Olivia, and he frowned when he saw she'd gotten sauce on the front of her mostly-white dress. "Oh, baby girl," he said with a sigh and dipped a napkin in his water glass to try and dab some of the sauce off the pale front of the dress. "Yeah, that's my fault. I didn't have your bib snapped the right way. At least we already got the pictures."
Steve shrugged, a little glum. "Well, there was never any threat of that eventuality ever happening — not until I got all this, anyway," he muttered and motioned down at himself.
," she told him over the phone not long after he and Steve had made their appearance at the gallery. "
Sam just shook his head. "Point is, we get it. You feel more comfortable leaving the care of your only child — your own flesh and blood — to people that have met her, like, once and live all the way on the other side of the country instead of, you know, people that have, like, played with her and taken care of her and watched her while you and your little princess do your...weird sex games."
Thor frowned at them, quirking his head as though to show that they hadn't answered his question at all, and Bruce said, "No, no, it was— It was an anti-pollution commercial from the '70s."
He sniffed one more time and wiped the remnants of stray tears from his face before he swallowed and signaled to pull back onto the road, waiting until the sparse amount of traffic passed before he pulled back onto the roadway. He drove in silence for what was probably a couple miles before he snuffled, wiped under his nose, swallowed, and said, "Look, not that you can hear me — and even if you could, not that you could understand me, but...did I ever tell you about your grandmother...?"
"But Midgard can rest assured knowing its champion will be around to defend it for many years to come."
"Dude, not enough brain bleach in the world to get rid of that image," Wilson replied, looking at Steve like his mere existence was now somehow offensive to him.
Which, for some god forsaken reason, had just triggered the waterworks in Tony, and Steve had spent five minutes rubbing his back and letting him cry against his shoulder because he
— stop Steve from going into that building. He'd stop him from making him a widower. Widow? A 'widower' was a man, but a 'widow' was a woman, and really, since he wasn't sure how exactly he identified anymore…
He quirked his head a little in bemusement, and when he went over to look at Rhodey's phone, he was greeted with the grinning faces of Pepper and Happy, both smooshed into the frame and what he took to be some part of Pepper's office just barely visible in what little could be seen of the background.
"Nah," Steve said but directed his gaze back at the baby feeding in his arms. "It'll work out for us until the end."
Tony and Steve blinked and frowned at each other then turned to the side where Bruce stood, granola bar shoved into a shirt pocket, hand at the back of his neck, and grimace twisting his face.
with the son-of-a-bitch's child — he reached over to his plate with his fork and attempted to scoop up whatever he could get before he got caught.
"I was trying to be noble and selfless. I thought the world needed you more than I did. I also thought you'd have everything wrapped up before I gave birth. I wanted you there, though. Ask any of them that were in the room. I think I cried more about it than I remember."
"Hmm?" he asked then slid his arms around Steve's waist and hugged him, pressing as close to him as he could. "Put your arms around me. Make it look like we're actually in love."
"You know, I think you're better at that than I am. We should play to our strengths. I'll feed her. You can change the diapers."
Steve just sighed out a breath. "Please don't buy off a presidential election just to prove a point to me."
Steve shrugged. "Whichever. I'm just saying it's not as…foreign a concept as you think it might be. I almost think it's kind of fitting. Out of all of us here, you're the creator. You're the one that makes things, that creates and builds and breathes life into things." He pulled a hand from behind his head and reached out to rub Tony's small belly. "Why shouldn't this be part of it?"
Steve opened his mouth to say something when the kitchen door slammed into the back of his chair again, jolting him, making him hit his abdomen against the table, which rattled the dishware and cutlery atop it. He took another deep breath and let it out, shooting a glare in the direction of the waiter that had slammed the door into his chair.
"I can't believe I'm about to utter these words," Steve said as he looked between them, "but Clint's more mature than you two."
She met his eyes again and smiled at him, and he nodded his understanding of her words and slowly, ever-so-slowly, let go of the hand he clutched like a lifeline.
"Steve, come on, you're not a stupid guy. Even you know the risks and challenges something like this would pose."
Steve just nodded, and Tony suspected he was already figuring out a game plan for how they were even going to go about that.
Steve dropped his hand from Tony's arm and shook his head some, resolute. "I don't want you to feel like you're stuck with me, Tony," he said, and Tony rolled his eyes.
"Not particularly," he said with a shrug and swiped at a few more screens. "Cap's good with kids. When's he supposed to be getting back?"
"Yeah, probably nothing compared to Asgard's pomp and circumstance, and sorry, pal, I don't think that's what they're going for," Barton said. "Especially considering Stark's, uh,
that man? Was this Hydra's doing? Had the Red Skull somehow found out about…? No, no one knew that about him. Bucky had, but he'd assured Bucky the serum had fixed him, much to Bucky's relief. Then what was this? And why did Steve so desperately want to put his hands all over that lithe body? Why did he want to kiss every inch of that tawny skin? Why did he want to listen to that strangely familiar voice ramble at ninety miles an hour over things he could only half-understand?
"Sure. Now, go stick that one sheet in the oven. J, start the timer as soon as the old man does what he's told."
"I know," Steve said and kissed his forehead. "But that's how I rationalize it to myself. It's not for the baby. It's for you."
Thor laughed and said, "Fear not, my friend, your Captain is most anxious to see you and complete the vows of marriage you have sworn to take for each other." He then looked Tony over and said, "Though I understand you still feel yourself to be the invincible Man of Iron that we have come to know and trust, may I say you make quite a stunning vision of female beauty."
Tony's blood chilled, and he met Bruce's now nervous gaze and asked a very even and totally not terrified, "Who's 'Maddie'?"
Wilson took it in stride — or as much as he could. They were keeping the whole Winter-Soldier- gone-on-the-straight-and-narrow thing quiet while Tony had Pepper have the lawyers work out the details absolving James Buchanan Barnes of the crimes committed while under the thumb of Hydra — even if Barnes himself wasn't fully comfortable with it because, in his words, "I still did it."
That theory was shot to hell a few hours later when JARVIS finished his analysis and the results — those horrible, horrible results — flashed on his screen.
Steve nodded and got up, and he grabbed the pillow and, instead of just handing it to Tony, worked to adjust the pillow under his arm to give him the most support he could.
Barnes glowered at him, or he thought he was glowering. It was hard to make him out, and Tony was so tired all of a sudden and all he wanted to do was sleep.
Steve just blinked and thought about asking Tony what that was, but Tony was gone into the foyer by that point and making headway up the stairs, so Steve just pushed himself to his feet and gazed around at the clutter of paper and toys.
Barton shrugged. "Mostly so Stark gets laid. He's much easier to deal with when he's sexually satisfied. More inclined to make cool things for us, too."
Steve just stared at him like he was considering his words before he nodded just a little but didn't meet Tony's gaze.
Steve noticed there were a few droplets falling from the sky as they went over to Tony's car, parked beneath a streetlamp no doubt as a means of deterring anyone that might be looking to steal it under the cover of dark. Steve stood on the passenger side and watched as Tony frowned and felt over his pockets then bent down over the driver's side window and peered in.
This one statement earned a thirty-second exchange from Wilson and Barton about the 'Judean People's Front' and the 'People's Front of Judea' and ended with them both yelling, "Splitter!" at Bruce.
He snorted a laugh. "Of course I haven't. Haven't even looked at the menu. I've been talking to you the entire time."
Where hopefully none of the others were and, hopefully, this spell or whatever it was that had been cast over Tony would reverse before Tony could use it against any of the others for his own childish amusement. He'd meant it when he'd said the others wouldn't take it well if they thought Steve was cheating on Tony in some way, and obviously Tony wouldn't be the one to suffer for it. Steve would. And he was pretty sure Natasha would have no qualms against castrating him if he ever were to actually do something like that.
There was something almost new-age-y playing from unseen speakers, and a handful of assorted people were already standing around pointing at photographs and making quiet conversation to one another. There was a thin woman with a dancer's body standing with one pair of guests, her flaxen hair pulled back into a tight bun, and she turned when she sensed more people had arrived and smiled when she spotted Bruce by the entrance to the show. She excused herself from the conversation then made her way over, her clothing sleek but somehow flowy — was she wearing a poncho? No, it wasn't called a 'poncho' in women's fashion. Was it? — and she held her hands out and said, "Bruce! I'm so glad you could make it!"
Maybe thinking Tony would play dumb, Steve didn't even hesitate to catch the nurse's attention so that she knew she'd been heard, and Tony grumbled to himself and clutched his bag as he stood up. He went over to meet up with the nurse, and when he caught her gaze, he motioned back toward Steve and said, "Uh, is it OK if my—"
"Now, I've been having a hell of a time keeping my emotions in check since, oh, last December, really, so what do
"Whatever," he said with a roll of his eyes, but stupid, fucking emotion was beginning to well up from somewhere deep within once more. Maybe it wasn't
Steve just nodded at him to begin, and Tony shook the bottle, unscrewed the top, and poured a splash in each glass. Steve unfolded one arm and picked the glass up with his hand, sloshing the liquid around to coat the inside lower part of the glass.
OK, maybe he just wanted to see how red and squeamish Steve could turn before he finally got the words out.
Tony's eyes crinkled in delight, and his mouth twitched from side-to-side before he said, "Oh, babe. Why? Why do you have to give me ammunition like that?"
Steve could do nothing but blink at him, completely confused by the last bit of his sentence, and Tony, evidently sensing he'd again gone over Steve's head, just waved off his concern.
He looked over and met Natasha's curious and unsure gaze, and he tweaked a small smile at her and shook his head. "Nothing."
And then, to prove his point, he stabbed a couple of bits of scrambled egg onto a fork and then ever-so-lightly touched them at the large, ugly puddle of red glop, taking only the tiniest portion of ketchup onto his eggs.
He awoke to cold and an eerie wind and hard, solid earth beneath him. He opened his eyes, slowly, to be greeted by a campsite and a crick in his neck from where he'd slept on his helmet, and Dugan was sitting there with a pan of cold water as he trimmed his beard and offered Steve a, "Merry Christmas, Cap. Slept well, I take it?"
Steve gave him a pointed look, and Tony huffed and rolled his eyes. "OK, look, it's— I'm used to it, OK? I have lifts—"
Because — going out in public, letting people see him — that would be tantamount to accepting what had been done to him, and if he accepted what had been done to him, and he accepted that he was a woman and that he was pregnant, then what did that say for who he really was?
"Don't you?" the woman asked, and Tony realized she was recording him. "Isn't that the name you gave the restaurant when you were seen dining with Captain Rogers several weeks ago? The same Captain Rogers you were seen with at the marriage bureau after that? The same Captain Rogers you were seen with leaving an obstetrician's office on Madison Avenue just the other day?"
Stark scoffed and tossed the towel aside. “Yeah, what was that thing I’ve told you time and again? Oh, right, following’s not really my style.”
Tony groaned a little and rolled his eyes. "Steve, you're not in the Depression anymore. I mean, maybe technically it's still a recession, but not only are you loaded from what the government gave you for leaving you in the iceberg — Don't give me that look! They gave you a shit-ton of money, and I know you squirreled it all away — but you're married to a fucking billionaire."
He finally passed her over to a smirking Bucky, and Jim watched them before he said, a thoroughly unimpressed tone in his voice, "Yeah, you guys aren't toddlers at all."
She shook her head again and said, "You're deliberately misunderstanding me, and you're evading my question. You
Tony was in the kitchen, cursing to himself in his attempt to master the art of baking Christmas cookies. Because clearly if he could build an armored suit in a cave and give birth under less than ideal circumstances, surely he should be able to produce a batch of Christmas cutouts.
Wilson's eyes went wide. "No shit," he murmured then looked between Tony and Steve. "Damn, so he's—"
"Your father is a goddamned slob. We live with a real-life Oscar Madison. Oh, god, does that make me Felix?"
"Eh," Tony said with a shrug. "Probably understands more than he lets on, but we're talking the mental capacity of an eight-year-old here, not some genius Nobel prize winner."
But he just hummed a little, reaching up to pull the bastard's hands away, and said, "Well, you get what you pay for. And clearly, I shelled out the
He clutched the box with the photographs a little closer and said, "Nothing," to Barton's — was it him, or was it always Barton? — query.
Tony just shot a bemused little smile at the person that had shouted that to him. "I want to say none of your business, but you'll take that to mean there's trouble in paradise, which there could be nothing further from the truth. Has it changed my relationship with Steve? Yeah. I mean, I'd be lying if I said everything between us was exactly the same as it was before. I'm
"Yeah, I get that, and I understand that in theory, but it's a little different when you're the whale lying on your back with your vagina on display for everyone to see. Trust me."
Steve swallowed and tried very hard not to imagine that. After his less-than-consensual experience with Johann, hadn't really thought himself to be into that kind of play. He knew Bucky and Natasha were (and he kind of suspected that Bucky wasn't the 'dominant' in the relationship, either, or, at the very least, they switched back-and-forth), but he had never thought he would be. Not that he was
Steve was attempting to pull him out of the kitchen. "It really would be better…if we…went into the bed— ah,
"If we just get rid of the Chancellor—" the third man muttered to the others, but the witch turned to him.
He loved them. He could honestly say he loved them and could truly, honestly, not imagine having to go back to a time when he didn't know them, when he didn't realize what he was actually missing from life. A time when, as a very wise man had once said, he had everything and nothing. He didn't want to go back to that. He didn't ever want to lose this.
think that's a problem anyone's going to have with you," Pepper said, and Tony arched his eyebrow a little higher.
He was going to find some study that showed coffee drinking was A-OK, and he'd shove it in Steve's face and never let him hear the end of it.
Tony hummed a little and nodded. "Steve said they took his blood but they didn't take anything else and he didn't offer it, either."
Tony gauged him a moment, looking him over and judging whether or not it was worth keeping him out in the field — yeah, his tower had turned into a 'field' whether he liked it or not — where some asshole Hydra agent might try something to bring out the Winter Soldier, but satisfied in knowing that the easiest means of doing that was, as far as they knew, last seen in Siberia was good enough for him.
There were no messages after that, and Steve rolled his eyes and went into the bedroom. He didn't really have time to check, but he logged into his computer situated on the desk in the corner then went about getting into his uniform as his desktop and icons loaded. He'd probably have to look into getting a new computer one of these days, but given a choice between eating and faster internet access, he'd have to say he'd choose the eating every time.
"It's not that," he said as he moved from gazing over a poster of a cross-section of the female breast to one showing the placement of various parts of the female reproductive system in relation to a full-term fetus. "It's just how…
Tony just hummed and shrugged, grabbing some flour to rub over the rolling pin, his eyes still on his tablet. "She has your appetite and probably your metabolism. I wouldn't be surprised."
He blew out a breath. "Uh," he said and tightened his arms some, "I don't, um… I didn't actually know — she didn't let me know — until it had gotten so bad she couldn't hide it from me any longer. She didn't, um…"
And, to prove his point, after he'd stripped away all the excess scraps of dough, he carefully began to pry off a candy cane shaped cookie, sliding the flat part of the spatula beneath and trying not to either tear or scrunch up the cookie. Steve watched, bemused, as Tony...not so much struggled as put more time and effort than necessary into getting the piece of raw dough off the tabletop, and after prying it free, he carefully set it onto a baking sheet lined with some kind of white paper, sliding it off and arranging it to make room for more.
They squared off against each other, gazes locked, postures rigid and ready to pounce, until Steve shook his head some and broke the contact, and without a word, he stormed off to the door and let himself out.
"Why not?" Bruce asked, and she turned to him, her eyes flashing like she'd just realized someone else was in the room. She focused on him a moment then frowned and reached out to touch a hand to his cheek.
She tsked and shook her head. "Such a vulgarism," she muttered then paused a moment. "Although…not entirely untrue."
Steve winced away from him, and Tony realized he'd probably cried out a little louder than he'd meant. "Why not?" Steve asked.
"Is it in the ceiling?" Barnes asked and pointed, and Tony just shook his head a little and turned his attention to Steve.
He tweaked a brief, challenging smile at Tony and said, "You really expect me to believe I fell asleep in 1944 and woke up in the year 2015?"
He waited at the bottom of the stairs for Steve's response, but instead of words, Steve made his way out of the kitchen, and as he crossed through the living area, he said, "Well, unless it's a date with Hedy Lamarr, I'm just not interested."
"Max capacity," Tony said with an exhale of breath as he rubbed his back some more, "the reactor should be able to power the building for five years. Installed the current one last year, so, we should be OK on that front. Really about finding space to put beds and equipment, neither of which we have. How bad is it out there?"
Look, he trusted Steve, and he knew Steve's relationship with Barnes was more like that of brothers — like the way his relationship with Rhodey was. He knew Steve's search for Barnes was more about doing right by his friend and not because he was mourning the loss of the one that got away.
"Hey," he said, and there was concern and a little bit of anger on his face, "you know that, right?"
Oh, and also wanted by Hydra because this was the child of a super soldier and a goddamned living legend.
He'd bought it, on a lark, a few weeks ago, thinking that maybe if he had it, it would give him an excuse to get back out there and finally put his past behind him once and for all.
"Yeah," Tony said and set the items down on the table. "She's thoughtful like that." He moved over to Steve and said to the little girl in his arms, "What'cha got there, baby girl? You got a cookie? You wanna share your cookie with Daddy?" Tony stopped cold and blinked. "In a different context, that's absolutely filthy, and I should be completely ashamed to even put any thought like that in context with my child."
"I mean, she's clearly Steve's," Tony said as the baby nursed from him. "I've never once seen either one of them put up a fight over eating."
"The married-people flirting," Rhodey explained, still happily cradling Olivia in his arms. "It's…really annoying. Like super annoying. Like I'm-going-to-have-to-stop-hanging-out-with-you- because-it's-giving-me-diabetes annoying."
The lights came on, the hum of computers and other electronics warming up for use, and DUM-E beeped and whirred and rolled on over, shoving the unfinished Widow's bites at him.
He came unannounced, emptying his spend into Tony, pumping through the aftershocks, and teasing out the last of his orgasm, the squelch of lube and come sounding downright depraved to his ear. He hovered above Tony a moment, and he was about to collapse on top of him when he realized Tony hadn't come yet, his cock still hard and curving against his belly. He swallowed and tried to see through the stars in his eyes, and he reached down and grasped hold of Tony's cock, and Tony grunted at the friction, but it didn't take him long to come to his own orgasm, and Steve worked him through it as Tony shot come all over his own chest and belly, and after they'd calmed, and after they'd both come back to their heads, Tony looked down at himself and said, "I forgot how messy you are."
The casual and sporty look that he'd grown accustomed to the past two months had been thrown by the wayside. He looked…gorgeous. He choked out a laugh. He looked downright gorgeous, with a dress that hugged his figure, dark hair pulled back to show off his face, and a face that looked like it had come off the pages of a magazine — a fashion magazine, not something like
"Look, all you gotta do is dress up real nice, show up for five minutes, shake hands, get your picture taken, mingle a little, have a drink, couple hors d'oeuvres—"
coming here for a hookup," Natasha explained as they arrived at the top. "Just a girls' night to talk about stuff like boys and work and kill counts."
"Steve, I'm not made of glass. I'll be OK if you go out looking for your buddy for a few days. And the Avengers aren't
He clamped his mouth shut and thinned his lips into a flat line, and Tony kept his focus on Steve's eyes and saw the makings of tears there that he was too proud to shed.
"Yeah, how did you agree on that so quickly?" Wilson asked. "Because I'm pretty sure arguing for you two is like sex you can have in public, and I know how much you two like sex, so…"
Tony hummed a little and patted his back and said, "I'm sure Brucie has all their greatest hits if you ever want to take a listen."
"Captain America drinks from the carton?" Bruce said, an amused smile on his face as he looked between Steve and Tony.
has the ear of the God-anointed ruler of the realm. I know you have come to me hoping for an easy way to fix this problem you appear to have. The King and his chancellor have been good to me. I will not lift one finger to hurt either of them."
Bruce merely closed his eyes and shook his head, and Hill frowned at him and put a hand to his shoulder and gave it a squeeze but said nothing beyond that.
"Yeah, that's sweet, J. But I'm pretty sure there's a gigantic paw print on my wrist right now, and I didn't want to say anything, but it hurts like a bitch."
Rhodey turned from where he was talking with Natasha and Pepper, and Wilson beckoned him over. He made his excuses to the girls then joined them and said, "Yeah? What?"
Tony nodded his understanding. He set his fork down and put his hands on the edge of the table to push himself away, and he got up and went over to Steve, and he put a gentle hand to Steve's face and turned it to him.
"Look, I get it. It's more conventional, and as open-minded and progressive a man as you are, there's got to be some of that old-school pre-Vatican II thinking stuffed into your brain, and while I get that you were OK with falling for me when I was a man, I guess I'm just afraid—"
But Natasha merely shrugged. "All sorts," she said rather simply — and cryptically, now that he thought about it.
Steve glanced back at him and grinned. "'cause we're soul mates." He nudged him with his elbow and added, "It's you and me until the end of time, from what it sounds like."
"Whatever," he said then picked Olivia up out of her highchair and cradled her in his arms. He looked around for the pacifier and frowned when he saw it had somehow fallen on the floor, and he shrugged and said, "I'll find another one," then carried her out into the living room with the intention of putting her down for her morning nap upstairs.
"You both still fail to understand the strength and power of your bond to one another. It is sacred and something few of your kind can ever experience. You know yourselves to be bond mates. You should embrace the blessing the universe has bestowed upon you."
Steve still looked less-than-pleased by this characterization, so Tony reached out and pecked a kiss against his lips.
He 'hmphed' a bit in thought and coasted through the tollbooth then made for the center tube. "I'm not overreacting here, am I, J?" he asked as he cut in front of a bus and gunned it into the tunnel. "I mean, he clearly picks
Seriously, though, contrary to what Tony thought would happen, the world didn't stop spinning or explode or die out simply because some pregnant woman had come out on live television insisting she was really Tony Stark.
Steve went to counter what Esmeralda had said, but Tony said, "Technically, I am her mother. I mean, I am a
"Olivia, use your fork," Tony said, and she scowled and picked up her fork and began to use it to poke at what was left of her waffle.
He felt himself being pulled from his slumber, a hand brushing the hair away from his forehead, and knowing it was Natasha watching over him, he snorted a laugh, his eyes closed, and murmured, "I'm not made of glass, Nat. I won't break if you leave me by myself."
Steve walked over and stood beside Tony, and he put a gentle hand to Tony's side and rubbed it then bent down a little and kissed Tony's forehead. Tony closed his eyes at the feel of Steve's soft, warm lips against his forehead, Steve's hand firm and possessive on his side. He hummed a little, this time in contentment, and Steve chuckled and turned his head some to rub his cheek against Tony's forehead.
"Pretty much," Barnes said, his tone resigned. "But, uh," he continued, scratching at his jaw with his thumbnail, "those times we did talk about things going on now — his life now — you came up a lot."
"You know, you're heavier than you look," he told her, and she just babbled and turned her head in the direction of the door. "Oh, you want to go back downstairs, do you? See what your…other dad is up to. Are we both 'Daddy'? How does that work?"
"OK, Tony," Bruce was saying, pulling Tony out of his quiet thoughts, "when I give the word, I'm gonna need you to push again."
But Steve just ignored whatever the implications from that comment might have been and instead said, "What are you doing here?"
"I wouldn't have known it was you unless you told me," Pepper said from his other side, and Hill glanced back at him from where she sat in the front seat and nodded her head at him.
Tony turned to look at Larry and Curly and said, "I hope you two are proud of yourselves. People look at you now, they immediately think about having to get a babysitter for you."
Olivia didn't acknowledge him, preferring to turn her attention elsewhere, and Steve brushed his fingers against her cheek again then turned back to the bottle warmer.
Tony shot a glance in Happy's direction then said, "Is this something you really want to discuss in front of—"
Tony settled in to let the baby nurse, and Steve sat and watched, his face curious and contemplative, and after a moment of comfortable silence, he said, "So…where did all this stuff come from?"
Tony grinned and made his way over to him. "Genius. Billionaire. Playboy. Philanthropist. Any of that ring a bell? I was perfectly content living a lonely, shallow existence with everything I could ever want and no one to share it with me until you came along. Now, look at me. I'm fucking Mr. Mom. I mean I
"Papa, you OK?" she asked in a small and worried voice, and Tony swallowed and slowly relaxed his defensive position before he was able to stumble his way back to the bed. He sat down on the edge, and Olivia — he finally recognized her as his alternate universe daughter — went to cuddle up beside him, but he caught hold of her and pulled her onto his lap and cradled her tight against his chest, wincing only a little from the push and tug of the arc reactor.
"Not a hassle or a problem whatsoever," he finished before Steve could suck the fun out of it. "It's one day, Steve! Could you just try to enjoy it? Look!"
He shook his head as though to stop himself from talking. He reached out and put his hands on Steve's arms as though to anchor him, and he tilted his head to look up and said, "Merry Christmas," as he captured Steve's lips with his own.
"It doesn't matter, Pep. Me? Steve? The mission statement stays the same. There's a trust set up so that no one can touch the funding for the Avengers. I know some of them have been dying to have my ass on a platter from the moment I came back from Afghanistan, but they're not going to. They're not getting the company."
Tony nodded a moment, mentally parsing his words, and he finally said, "So…we're so annoying we're the only two people that could put up with each other?"
"Ignoring the problem isn't going to make it go away," Hill said. "Not if you keep doing stuff like this. If you're going to keep being seen in public together, I'm sorry, Steve, but I think you're going to have to bite the bullet here."
He looked up at where Steve stood above and to the side of him and watched as he shook his head and closed his eyes.
"Why choose? How 'bout 'Natasha Antonia'? Ugh, that's a mouthful. 'Antonia Natasha'? That sounds better. Rolls off the tongue better. Antonia Natasha Stark-Rogers. Or, I guess in this case, it's Antonia Natasha Carbonell."
Steve shrugged. "I don't know. I just… I know how uncomfortable you've been and that's sort of something you have to be comfortable in your skin for—"
Tony whined, completely sidestepping Bruce's last comments. "Come on, just a quick checkup. Turn your head and cough. Let me check your reflexes. Bend over so I can check your prostate. You know, the usual."
Well, more giggled, and once Steve was able to get a hold of himself after riding the crest of his own orgasm, he rubbed his hands gently over Tony's belly and said, "What?"
He burst out laughing, hugging his arms around himself, and once he'd gotten a hold of himself, he reached out, snagged an arm around Tony's shoulders, and pressed a kiss to his forehead.
Tony nodded, finding himself a little humbled by Hill's words and the implication of what they really meant, and, under the table, he reached for Steve's hand and clasped hold of it, Steve squeezing in response before Tony even could. Evidently, Steve understood the gravity of those words as well.
is what I'm talking about! I know you kinda get off on it, but you've got to stop this bullshit — this heading headlong into disaster bullshit. People are going to start to think you're suicidal, Steve."
Tony shook his head and waved him off. "Don't worry about it. Gotta do what you gotta do. I'll be fine."
Tony pulled himself away from the wall and made sure to stand so that he had an escape route if need be, and he put his hands to his hips and looked at the creep that he was about five seconds away from kicking in the balls. Literally. He was really about to do it, and he was sure it wouldn't be to a more deserving fellow.
And people said Tony could talk his way into and out of things. Clearly these people had never really stopped to think about the shit Steve Rogers could and had gotten away with just by virtue of exploiting some technicality.
She turned her attention to him, her eyebrows raised in slight surprise. "You do not know?" she asked like his question confused her.
"She usually takes a nap after lunch, so I put her down on the couch in the penthouse. She, uh, she lives here, obviously. With you and her Daddy. She likes to draw and color and paint and play with dolls and play games. Evidently computer games. She's gone on about Natasha, Clint, and even Thor. She said something about a 'Mad Eye,' which is definitely something she picked up from you. There were a whole bunch of other people she mentioned, too. A Sam and a Wanda and even a Hank Pym—"
Steve gave him another squeeze and rubbed his hands over his belly. "I'll stick by you no matter what."
"Oh, I knew that," he said and maneuvered the car into the furthest left lane, using his turn signal for a fraction of a second. "Sometimes, when I was able to find my way out of the workhouse, I'd see the bright, shining lights of the city off in the distance — like the gleaming towers of Oz — and I'd think about how swell it would be to grab a couple of nickels and make my way over there."
"Thanks," he said, unsure if Barton was being sincere of if it was a setup of some kind. Barton just shrugged and took another sip of his drink. Huh, evidently, he was being sincere.
There were none. Bruce came and checked him again a little while after that. Tony was still at eight centimeters. Tony almost cried.
but everything he'd always wanted but assured himself he could never have. Aside from the tingle of electricity that had gone through him when Tony's lips had touched his, he'd been hit with the overwhelming sense of familiarity and belonging. He didn't know how whoever had set this up had managed it, but they'd dug into the deepest, darkest parts of Steve's soul and had given him everything he'd ever wanted but told himself he could never have.
"Pepper has an ulcer?" Steve asked, pausing his polishing as genuine concern leeched into his voice.
going to be marching in here and claiming you issued a license in his name under false pretenses. You want to know why? Because
"Oh, my god, you're doing it! What—? No! Stop that— Look, sometimes when you get all righteous and sanctimonious, you get this look on your face that makes all of us feel like we somehow have failed at life in general. We call it the Stare of Disapproval or the Stare of Disappointment."
But he came to his senses rather quickly and went over to the bathroom door. "Babe?" he asked and knocked on it. "Uh… You OK in there?"
Tony just shook his head and sighed a little, but Steve got up from the bed, and he knelt beside the rocker and folded his arms atop the arm of the rocker and looked up at Tony.
"I should make you go and find that yourself. It's a matter of public record. But April. Do I remember the date? No, of course not. That's why I got married. Steve remembers that stuff, not me." He pointed to one in the middle toward the far wall. "You."
When I was making my fourteen thousand dollar bet with that asshole—" he motioned to Barton, who winced and looked around at the group as though to ask, 'What the hell did I do?' then continued, "—did you
"Look, we've been sleeping in the same bed as each other for a year-and-a-half now. We're all adults here. I don't think there's any reason to—"
As Natasha went over to the 'jet to explain her change of plans to the crew, Bruce joined him in- step, and as they left the hangar and went over to the elevator, Bruce said, "Look, Tony, I know how little you want to listen to advice about this sort of thing, but get some rest now while you can."
"Yeah, yeah," Bucky said before Sam added, "Say 'hi' to your boyfriend for us." Steve, mature fellow that he was, flipped them off.
He got into the driver's seat and slammed the door. He started the engine, and as Steve tried to plead with him, he threw it into gear and checked his mirrors before he gunned it and took off down the shoulder then merged back onto the highway, leaving Steve and his son-of-a-bitch pal in the dust.
Steve laughed again and reached out to pull Tony back into a warm, safe embrace, and Tony went with it, sighing contentedly and relaxing against Steve's strong, if bruised, form.
Tony opened his mouth to answer, but no sound came out, and Steve said, "No, actually, we're waiting to be surprised."
"It's possible," Thor admitted, "but I have been alive for many hundreds of years, and in my youth, there was never any talk of these Infinity stones and what havoc they may wreak on our world. Oh, there was talk of them, of course — as a myth or a legend — but it is only recently that they have begun to make themselves known. I fear for what that may portend."
This seemed to pique Steve's interest or concern, and he frowned a little before he said, "JARVIS, mute the TV," and turned his full attention on Tony, the sound on the TV cutting off as he did so. He raked his gaze all over Tony's face before he said, "You want to stay like this?"
And at that, he enveloped Tony in his arms and pulled him against his chest, relaxing with the feel of Tony's warm, sturdy weight in his embrace.
Tony pursed his lips a little before he chugged the remainder of his coffee and set the mug back on the table. "So, she came here all the way from her…seashell or wherever the hell she lives because she thinks I'm bonded to Steve?"
Steve exhaled a breath, and he reached over and rubbed a gentle hand over Tony's belly and said, "You know, we should probably start thinking about names."
In fact, he did, commissioning a trusted acquaintance (all right, someone Pepper recommended to him) to take what amounted to a family portrait of Steve, Tony, and Olivia with Steve reclining on the couch, Tony tucked into his side, and Olivia resting tummy-down on Steve's chest. One of Steve's hands rested protectively over Olivia's small back while his other arm was wrapped tightly around Tony. Tony had one hand supporting Olivia's bottom as he leaned into Steve, and Steve's head was turned, his lips pressing a soft, gentle kiss to Tony's forehead.
— he's in love with that's carrying his child, and that terrifies him because Steve has it in him to protect the people he loves, and if anything were to happen to you..."
"OK, well, this was fun. Glad we spent this time together. Babe? If you could get my clothes for me, that would be fantastic."
He turned and saw Steve sleeping beside him, tucked onto his side and facing Tony, and Tony went to lay back down and cuddle up against him when he realized he was wet. Like really wet. And aching to have Steve inside of him.
of a difference in their heights now that Steve was in socks and Tony was wearing a small heel. He watched as Steve pulled a small box from his sock drawer and cracked it open to reveal the sterling cufflinks Tony had bought him for an anniversary.
Tony nudged him. "Anyway, look, it's been forty goddamned weeks, Steve. Forty. I love you. I have enjoyed this experience more than I ever thought I possibly could. But I am fucking ready for this to be over already. Now—" He reached over and set his tablet back down on the table. "If you would be so kind as to get your pants down and the Lieutenant up at attention."
"And it's like, no matter how many times you tell the kid to settle down, he doesn't listen." He glanced back at Steve. "He really does take after you, doesn't he?"
He shrugged and moved his hand over the swell of Tony's abdomen, Tony's hand resting atop his. "Yeah, but…I was an only kid. It got lonely. I always wanted at least two if I ever had any of my own. To be honest, I think I'd sorta kinda like a half-a-dozen."
The next morning, Steve was up and gone by the time he woke up, and he frowned at Steve's cold, empty, but rumpled side of the bed and muttered, "I didn't think the honeymoon was supposed to be over
"What?" Tony asked him with a grumble. "What are you apologizing for? Unless you think I'm loud and annoying, too."
Steve just gave him a slightly apologetic smile, and he leaned in and captured Tony's lips with his. It was chaste, not much heat, more sweet than anything, and Steve was the one to break it, sitting back and shoving the remainder of the toast in his mouth while the talking heads on TV continued to chatter in the background.
he was because you love him. Because you don't want him to change because you love him the way he is. You want the world to think Tony Stark is some cold, uncaring bastard that's only in it for himself because to not be might leave you vulnerable, and the thought of being vulnerable terrifies you. Because Howard Stark was a poor excuse for a father that didn't deserve such a brilliant and selfless and caring son as you.
"A few bottles," Tony said with a shrug. "But I rather have that stuff in reserve just in case the whole formula thing doesn't work out."
the one with the little green dwarf that talks funny and the guy in the all-black suit that talks funny?"
Was he still a 'fella'? Did he still consider himself a 'fella'? He still used masculine pronouns to refer to himself, but forty-four years of conditioning would do that to a person no matter the fact his current body was
"Of course," rang out an accented voice different from the witch's, and the Council caught their first glimpse of the being it was said that the witch herself brought to life from straw and some old rags. He was tall, fair-haired and with fine features. He gave a sort of smile to the Council before he produced a bottle of mead and began to fill their goblets. There were rumors in the town that his skin was of a purplish tinge, but upon close inspection, it appeared to be only mottled with dirt and use, and the Council could only figure that the stories of the witch bringing the man called 'Viz' to life had been greatly exaggerated.
Knowing that alerting Tony to the fact that he was not falling for this ruse would be suicide, he slipped into the pair of decidedly comfortable pants — pajama pants, he determined. Tony was going back into the kitchen, chattering away at ninety miles an hour about… Oh, who the hell knew? The man talked. A lot. Eventually, Steve decided, he would slip up and the game would be over. Until then…
"Look, I'm not saying she's anything other than the awesomeness that she is. I'm just saying for someone that you would spend the rest of your life with—"
Steve just laughed and said, "What?" as he looked down at himself. "You don't think it's good enough? I picked it out myself."
"The serum?" he asked, hoping they might reveal their entire evil plan to him because why the hell not?
Steve was quiet a moment before he said, "Maybe," and as Tony nodded his understanding, he continued, "But he was a little…shy, I guess is the word I want to use? Like he wasn't sure what to make of her and he wasn't sure if he should even be anywhere near her. You didn't yell at him, did you?"
