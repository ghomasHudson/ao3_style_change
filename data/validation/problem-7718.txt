“And you
“Just… my heats usually last longer than - than this,” he admitted.
Tony pulled the coat away from his face and played with the sleeves, bringing one close to smell. “Are you going to join?” he repeated the earlier question.
“Clint,” Steve hissed as he instinctively turned Tony when he felt Tony press himself against his chest in a belated attempt to hide. Tony himself felt mortification when he eventually realized Clint was smelling the aftermath of their coupling, the aftermath that came directly from
Tony got closer. “Is that it? You want to fuck me, Rogers?” He taunted.
He returned to the conversation on hand just in time to hear Pepper say “-training us to guard the den, then?”
“B-Bruce, Brucie, there’s a snake. There’s a giant snake,” Tony pawed at Bruce blindly as he backed away. His heart stopped for a second when he felt Jarvis curl up and hide behind his neck.
Steve pulled himself to sit upright. His eyes were soft and his voice calm. “How long did your heats used to last?”
His Brucie was the first one to reach them and the stern glare he gave Tony was every bit as comforting as Steve’s hug.
By the time the sun decided to set in to make way for the night they had made a fair amount of distance through the forest, considering they were walking on two legs. The trees were lessened around the edges of the road they marched upon and grassy plains were slowly lengthening with visible hills left and right.
Tony hesitated. If it already hurt with Hammer’s… and Steve proved to be far larger than him… would Tony survive the experience without adding new sets of scars to himself?
Useless - just as he was currently. Unable to move from his spot. Unable to say a single word or defend Pepper from the many surrounding betas that have them cornered against the waters that had been so important to him.
he didn’t learn that from
“Yes, but
“Steve not on the couch, damn it!”
“I have to go.”
Tony allowed himself to be examined and took up the offer of Bruce hunting the last rabbit as Tony rested his injured paw. Jarvis joined Bruce on the hunt after making sure Tony would be fine, leaving the breathless omega to curl up next to the rabbits with a little machine beeping and fussing over him.
Perhaps along the way of trying to bring Tony down she gained genuine interest for Bruce. The mystery behind him had her watching intently and before she realized it attraction set in. If that were the case Tony wished his omega buddy all the luck in the world. He deserved it.
Steve grunted next to his ear with every push, never releasing his neck. His pace shifted back and forth from the slow angle that allowed him to feel it all to a quick burst of speed that nearly hit every nerve in sudden succession before going back steady. It was overwhelming no matter what the alpha did and Tony felt how his walls latched onto Steve every time he pulled out, wanting him to stay put.
being part of the Avengers pack. They were visitor after all and their visitation had come to an end after nearly reaching a week stay.
Tony grunted with each thrust. His legs were wrapped around Rogers’ hips and his hands clung on the other man’s shoulders, holding on for dear life. Every thrust knocked the air out of him. It felt difficult to breathe but he couldn’t pull away from Rogers. Like his body just couldn’t let go.
The second in command ignored the beta and trotted around to stand next to Tony’s head and pawed at Steve’s. “Time to wake up.”
mate. He could look. Steve hadn’t forbidden it, or forced him not to, nor quite the opposite and forced him
After all that, here Tony was, who entered his heat cycle without meaning to, rubbing it in their faces with no consideration. All because he didn’t take his suppressants. He never imagined himself to feel guilty for having a heat when for the past decade he didn’t believe he could ever have one again, but here he was, guilt in his heart for Jan and Hank.
While the betas began their back and forth Tony maneuvered his way to sit with the other omega. Vision gave him a beep in greeting and Jarvis was quick to jump from Bruce’s shoulder to his own and nipped his ear gently.
Hands pressing on his back made him still for a moment, if only because he was curious as to what Steve was planning. He made a curious sound when those hands circled over his shoulders and down his lower back.
He does remember a brief moment after where all goes quiet. It terrified him. He remembers trying to call out, but the sounds he created were not human. He remembers searching the room, looking for his mate. Stepping over many faceless shadows until finally,
Rhodey didn’t even bother to play along. This was hurting him as much as Tony. “You know I’m not. It kills me to leave you again.”
The beta seemed taken back by the now angered bird and gave a worried glance to Tony, who only shrugged and raised his one good hand in peace, wanting no part in it.
“Not if I catch him first,” Clint challenged.
“We’re already getting along. Great! So let’s unpack those bags of yours and give you permanent rooms.”
“Sweetheart?”
The beta went limp and leaned against Sam as if injured. “I've been shot twice. Sam, go on without me.”
The same one that spoke first leaned in, causing Tony to quickly act and avoid colliding with it, “It was not the dragon that decided to arrive. The dragon has no control. It was you, was it not, human?”
Tony now understood why Bruce was so hesitant. He had every right to be because not only was his shifted form something never before seen he also didn’t even have any control of it. Bruce shared his body with someone else. Someone powerful and unnatural looking that could attack anyone they wanted and Bruce could do nothing to stop him.
Steve came jogging over, appearing flushed for some reason and with his pack following after him in a more sedated pace. A bit stunned and confused as to why Steve and his pack came after him and Bruce, Tony leaned to the side to see the table they were sitting on minutes ago for an explanation. All he found was the betas and omegas sitting and standing with heartbroken faces and the beta, Prior, standing on his two feet with his mouth wide open, face bright red with rejection and humiliation painted all over it. Tony wondered what had happened or what Steve had said for him to look that way.
He felt a little overwhelmed. Jarvis had never once talked to him like that before. The cockatoo must have been holding that in for a long time now based on the intensity he managed to include in his voice while still whispering. Tony refused to admit to the very unattractive sob he released or that he wiped away tears that were not there.
Then the fighting happened again. Steve charged, teeth bared and snarling. Bucky was right behind him, ready to grab hold of any body part to latch onto and never let go. Tony’s heart stopped at the sight. Rhodey could fight, he knew this, but fighting against two alphas who were part of the Avengers pack? No matter how determined, Rhodey was going to lose and end up badly injured.
The arm around his shoulder moved. Steve’s hand was quick to cover his neck and his thumb carefully pulled his chin back down. Because they had been so close, Tony could clearly hear the growl Steve emitted towards the other alpha. From the front of the lineup, he could barely make out the female alpha’s own growls in retaliation to Steve’s. The exchange between them not only stopping Tony in his tracks but also the entire pack.
“We’ve been working on your stamina with these drills,” Natasha revealed. “Easier to escape if you have the endurance to run for hours. On your own you’re not ready to try and fight back, but with these techniques you’ll have just enough for self-defence until you find an opening to escape.”
Vision turned his head from Steve to Tony and back to Steve, made a long note that could only be defined as the machine’s version of an ‘ooooh, is that it?’ before he released a series of beeps and whistles that had Tony jumping to try and cover up and caused him to turn bright red.
“Then let's go,” Tony answered as he got up and took both his and Steves disposable items, they walked towards the car after he through the items in the bin.
“Its… it's doing it job… keeping me alive and that’s all that counts.”
and dad and I only went to go and visit mom and anyway, and yes, we would travel as a family, but its always different travelling with family compared to your boss or friends. Plus mom and dad would always want to go to the same places, Ireland then some other European country for a week then back home. You forced me into travelling to South Africa, China, South Korea, Australia and many other countries and for all of those things, I'm truly indebted towards you so… allow me to introduce you to my guilt pleasure… Oh wait I forgot to get more wine and our dessert!” Steve shouted as he stood up, grabbed the takeaway cartons and bolted towards the kitchen and not even a minute later came back with a bottle of red wine and a pint of the Ben & Jerrys Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough that was in the freezer, two tablespoons and their fortune cookies.”
“Yet you stayed,” he whispered as he stared into Steve's eyes.
“Yet I stayed,” Steve returned as he stared back at Tony before breaking contact.
“Oh… Like the
“But what if we trade? you take my place and I take yours. I think those board-members will love seeing you there instead of me with all that tiny sassiness,” he said with faux enthusiasm.
Both Steve and Tony left the car as they made their way towards the oceans calm waters, they both sat down about 6 ft from the water on the sand, with their frozen yoghurt in their hands.
**************
“Really?"
***************
With a smile, Tony looked at Steve before handing him his glass. Steve thanked him as he placed the pint of ice cream between him and Tony then looked at Tony with a smirk, he took a sip of wine, placed it on the floor and told Tony, “Welcome to the world of painfully good but utter trash... reality tv. J.A.R.V.I.S. please play the video.”
Grinning, Tony asked, “What… no dessert?”
“How about a week off after we finish up our business in New York, and then I’ll also buy you all the Christian Louboutins your heart desires and maybe add in a piece of art as a bonus.”
Tony sat his wine glass down as he asked, “What did you get us?”
Ignoring him, Steve asked, “So will it also take place in Flushing Meadows? Or are you planning on changing the venue to bring in more attractions?"
“Mmm... I see there is a new flavour so I think I’m going to try it,” Steve declared to no-one before he looked over the counter at the shop assistant, “yes I would like the Dulce de Leche, medium cup with brownie bits, roasted almonds and chocolate-covered waffle pieces... yes I’ll have that and oooh,” he voiced as he looked at tony with wide eyes, “water to I’ll have a bottle of water too, thanks.”
“What flavour do you want?” Tony asked as he looked at Steve as they entered ‘Yogen Früz’ and made their way towards the counter.
"I think today I’ll go for the chocolate truffle explosion flavour chocolate covered waffle pieces, mini peanut butter cups and m&m minis in a large cup, thanks,” Tony said to the assistant before turning his attention to Steve, “when we leave the beach I think we can go to some off the wall coffee shop? I’ll defiantly be in need of a double espresso.”
“Aw, aren’t you just the cutest little cock blocker ever?” Tony cooed in his baby voice, his lips puckering slightly to add to the over all affect.
Tony managed a small laugh before responding.
Tony looked around and realized they were the last pair left on the dance floor.
Steve delicately took his daughter from King T’Challa before clutching her tightly to his strong chest, his face the very definition of paternal anxiety.
“My father took many other wives when he was with my mother. She was his primary wife and none of them lasted long, but he still married others. One of his unions was particularly devastating to my mother. It was a seventh degree marriage, a one night union for a soldier, but a child came out of it. My half brother, Bucky, was born and his mother died bringing him into this world.” Steve explained.
Tony beamed, “Perfect.”
She and Rhodey both rose out of their bow making the tension that was visibly building in his future-husband start to fade.
“Thank you for telling me, Tony.” Steve murmured, his words coming out muffled in Tony’s hair.
Steve reached up and pulled on Tony’s loosened tie, dragging the younger man in for a much deeper kiss. The genius quickly gave up on the idea of getting up and instead leaned further into the kiss, his arm reaching out to balance his weight.
“Papa.” She whimpered miserably.
“Papa, I don’t wike him.” Sarah whined dejectedly.
“Yes, I do.” Tony said. “Too many people are depending on me.”
Fortunately for Tony there was plenty to do in the Rogers-Stark household. It was nearly a full time job keeping an eye on the now two year old Peter, who's favorite pass time had become running around the house on the walls and ceiling and seeing how much he could smash before his parents got fed up and put him in his specially designed playpen with his toys.
Steve made quick work of Tony’s belt with one hand while the other kept him thoroughly preoccupied. Once the younger man’s belt was finally off, Steve removed both his hands from Tony’s body eliciting a whimper from the man above him.
The baby started quietly complaining again and Steve, who had plenty of experience from when Peter was young, quickly realized that the little baby had only been crying because it needed a new diaper.
An uncomfortable warmth flooded Tony’s chest at those words, but he pushed it down. This affection… this was dangerous. Tony needed to be more sure of this man and his own circumstances here before he could be sure if he should indulge in it or bury it.
Steve’s chest rumbled in a low growl beneath Tony’s hands before he slowly, hesitantly pulled back. Steve’s hands released Tony’s ass and drew back up to the small of his back, seemingly unwilling to part from Tony completely.
Tony thought about it for a moment. Clearly something was wrong, but Steve wasn’t going to come out and say it without some sort of push.
Peter nodded slightly. “I promise, daddy.”
Their eyes met in a challenge, brown and green burning in recognition of the other person’s ability to hurt the other. They both took a half step back, making them face opposite directions with one of their hands still pressed together. They slowly began to turn in a circle, their hands forming the center point.
"Why don't we just use both of them so that we can get her birth certificate made up before we land?" Steve implored.
“Of which thing?” Tony asked, blinking harshly to try and clear the lust from his brain.
Tony stood, not looking at Steve, and walked quickly from the throne room.
Tony turned just as he pulled open the door and called out “Goodnight, Peter. I love you.”
“Of course I do.” Tony replied.
“Shh. Whats the matter baby girl?” Steve asked soothingly already gently rocking his daughter on an attempt to calm her and reassure himself that his daughter was not physically harmed.
Steve frowned and gave Tony a look that made it plain that Steve was not happy with Tony at the moment, before shaking his head at his exasperating lover.
Tony was startled from his thought by Steven rising our of his seat. A hush fell over the crowd gathered before them, but the music didn’t stop. Steven gestured for Bucky to come towards them. Bucky reached down and pulled a sturdy bag from the ground. Tony supposed this was the exchanging of gifts they were supposed to do. Tony looked over at Rhodey. They held eye contact for a moment and then Rhodey was moving, bringing the silver goblet over to Tony without a word. Tony watched his best friend make his way over to the head table, spine straight and shoulders back. Rhodey was every inch the proud warrior he had always been. Tony smiled softly up at Rhodey once stood in front of him. Rhodey reached into his own satchel and pulled out the goblet, placing it gently on the table. He nodded to Tony, a small smile on his own face, before retreating back to his seat next to Pepper and Bruce.
“Hewe Dawdy. Elie will hewp.” Peter said seriously as he placed his bear in his father’s arms.
“And thats not even the worst part.” Tony continued, though it was difficult for Steve to even begin to imagine something worse than the images that were permeating his mind and slowly invading his subconscious like molasses oozing through the cracks in his defenses.
“Come. I want to get the know my future husband and that is rather difficult with all this noise.” Steven said loudly so as to be heard over the laughter of the partiers.
“I am sorry, I don’t have a goblet as fine as the one you have given me for you to use.” Steven said, genuine regret coloring his voice and filling his eyes. “But, I promise you, I will give you a goblet more befitting of you on our true wedding night.”
Tony chuckled. “Yes, your Uncle Rhodey and I used to run around the tunnels all day scaring the maids when we were just a few years older than you.”
“Kitty!” she screamed before making a beeline for King T’Challa.
He quickly turned and began slowly making his way towards the noise, his shield held protectively in front of Peter. The sound came again and this time Steve recognized what it was, a baby. Steve swiftly made his way towards the sound while still remaining aware of potential places for an enemy to hide in. He finally traced the now constant noise to a small dank room. There was a large hole in the far wall that let in an abundance of light and with it the chill of the outdoors. Squeezed into a small space, in what would have been a rather hidden corner of the room, was a small crib where the source of the wailing was coming from.
Peter had stopped his fascination with the cheerios and had instead focused on the small squishy looking thing that his father was currently focused on. He reached up and grabbed a portion of the blanket that was covering one of the babies feet. The baby jerked and made a slight noise that startled Peter. He let go quickly and reared back as far as he could to get away from the strange thing.
“I shall. Sleep well, my King.” Jarvis murmured.
“Eat.” The red headed woman said in a tone that left no argument and made it very clear that her order would be enforced, one way or another.
When the chapter was done Tony surreptitiously checked to see how close to sleep Peter was. He took in the slowing rise and fall of his son’s little chest and carefully slid off the bed. He placed the book on the night stand and was just turning to leave when a little voice stopped him in his tracts.
“So that’s what it takes to make you blush.” Tony teased, breaking the heaviness
“Well I guess I should start with how my father wasn’t a very good king. He cared little of the wellbeing of his citizenry so long as they were well enough provided for to pay taxes to him. Because of that, he expanded the city’s mercantile class and made it the trading capital of the Etruscan empire. But the people who suffered because of it…”
Clint’s blush was worth totally worth it. The “I’m extremely disappointed in you and slightly turned on” sex he and Steve had after they had finished their meal was merely icing on the cake.
Tony, who was still standing where Steve had left him, slumped slightly and sighed. He slowly made his was over to Steve who was still clutching Peter tightly.
“Anthony, I offer this blade so that you made guard yourself and our future with it when I cannot.” Steven said, the solemn words juxtaposed with the small smile still hovering on his lips.
Tony continued his assault on his partner’s neck until Steve had finally managed to undo the very last button of the billionaire’s shirt and triumphantly tore the material from his body. Tony chuckled slightly at Steve’s exuberance, clearly he wasn't the only one who’s control was starting to waiver. His smirking mouth slowly made its way up to Steve’s ear. His hot breath made the super soldier shiver underneath him, which only caused Tony’s smirk to grow.
“May I?” Steve asked, gesturing to the torc.
“Looks like I'm not the only one.” The Captain countered huskily. His hand reaching boldly down between their half naked bodies and cupping Tony’s ever growing arousal.
Tony nodded and the pair or siblings slowly made their way out of the great room and into one of the many halls that appeared to be carved into the mountain side. Tony’s curiosity peaked.
“Table flip? Why are you searching for a table flip?”
“But you will still have the happiness of eating a cookie.”
Steve got up from his seat he took the takeout cartons and placed it on the table as he grabbed both his and Tony’s glasses of wine before giving the latter his glass of wine. He sat back down, criss-cross style, on the sofa as he looked into tony’s eyes and inquired, “ Enough about New York… how are you doing… coping? Ya know? With the whole ‘I am Iron Man mess?”
"You liked me,” Tony said with a knowing grin.
“Honestly you know that I typically don’t like frozen yoghurt... but if I drown it in toppings then it should be able to drown the chalky flavour.” Steve replied with a face filled with disgust.”
“These Ben & Jerrys in the freezer plus a fortune cookie each, so there, desserts sorted,” Steve answered as he made his way toward the couch he looked back at Tony, who still sat in the kitchen, and requested, “Hey, can you also bring the bottle of wine and the chopsticks that are in the draw? Oh and also a bottle of water please?”
“Honestly Stevie, I don’t know. He’s probably some guy who wants all his cards laid out in front of him.”
Rolling his eyes Steve said, “It’s to culture you, and no… I don’t mean your version of culturing in the form of Star Trek or Wars or something like that.”
“First of all, you were already well-travelled since your mom would always travel to other countries for her work.”
Steve sighed as he looked at Tony then back to the screen then back to Tony again and replied,” This my dear sir, is the only guilty pleasure in life that one needs, and no sex does not fall into that category.”
?” Steve said as he placed his yoghurt cup on his lap and replaced it with the water they had bought, he opened it up before he took a sip.
Steve placed the goods on the coffee table, took the fortune cookies in his hand and gave one to Tony before opening his and he read it aloud, “It’s about time I got out of that cookie.”
“You know,” Steve said as he ate a spoon full of his yoghurt before continuing, “for some weird reason this view… this sound, especially at this time is the best therapy that no money can buy.”
Glaring at Tony Steve finished with a sigh, “As I was saying it's to introduce you to something that is of interest to individuals, such as myself, who have a huge love of reality tv. You’ve been asking me about my obsession with the Real Housewives franchise and this is where it truly all started... watching The Real Housewives of O.C, then New York came out and I knew then that it officially became my new obsession, then Atlanta and my all-time favourite franchise, obviously after New York, New Jersey came out.”
“Foods here,” Steve said as his phone ‘pinged’ the notification that the delivery man was outside, he got up and left the kitchen making his way towards the entryway he turned halfway to look back at Tony as he asked, “Hey Tony? Did you ask J.A.R.V.I.S to open up the driveway gate once the delivery guy gets here.”
“But what if- ”
“Orange County. Is the original but as I said my favourite has to be New York then New Jersey. No question there.”
“O.C?” Tony asked with confusion in his voice.
“Humanitarian my ass”, Steve whispered with a grin as he noticed Tony glare at him before giving out a chuckled ‘sorry’
“I wouldn’t say that it was a rough session but it did take its toll out on me, but it was needed. Speaking of therapy, when are you starting?”
“As I was saying before you rudely interrupted me, life's good and the humanitarian in me is enjoying helping people out who are in danger by doing something good. It just brings more meaning to life that’s all.”
“Its Star Wars and you know it,” Tony cut him off.
“I was craving some Chinese, so I just ordered a bunch of food from P.F. CHANG’S. I ordered one of each of the lettuce wraps, BBQ spare ribs, some pork dumplings for us to share and then for our main I got you Chang’s Spicy Chicken, with fried rice and extra chicken, and for me the Korean Bulgogi steak, with a side of white rice,” he replied as he walked into the kitchen to grab both his and Tony's glasses of wine.
“Yes, my King.” Rhodey said, his thick accent adding a melodic twist to the language.
Steve was silent for a long time. Tony thought he was going to drop the subject, let in sink into the ocean that was between them and be buried at the bottom.
Steven’s bright smile seemed like a good enough marker for Tony to say he had done fine. Then again that may also have something to do with the omega call to his alpha’s vows, but Tony preferred his own interpretation.
Tony instead turned to keep on ogling his soon-to-be-husband. He caught those mesmerizing blue eyes again. They were so beautiful Tony thought he might drown in them. He was so focused he didn’t even realize Bruce was moving on to the next part of the ceremony until his hand hit his betrothed’s forearm. Tony blinked and grasped it like he was supposed to. His intended did the same.
“Yes?” Tony called.
Everyone in the room looked down slightly, knowing full well that the “people” that Steve was talking about were in fact Hydra. Steve knew first hand how Hydra treated people who possessed abilities they wanted. After all, his best friend had been their longest and most consistent victim.
“You are mine.” Steve growled. “Only I get to hear you, see you, smell you like this from now on. They are not allowed to have you like this.” Steve’s grip tightened slightly, pulling Tony even more firmly against his body.
“Goodnight, Tony.”
“Gifts?” Tony asked, shaking himself out of the hypnotic effects his husband’s voice was having on him already.
“It is.” Steve replied morosely.
When the man reached the steps below the throne, he knelt, those blue eyes breaking away from the King’s gaze for the first time as the man bowed his head. The King gripped the arms of his seat so tightly he thought they might break as the feelings of hurt, betrayal, and sorrow attempted to consume him.
"So, whats her name going to be?" Natasha asked the couple.
“I’m sorry about this.” Steve addressed Tony once the man was out of earshot. “My mother is a bit overzealous sometimes. She’s just excited to meet you and see us married.”
Seamus approached and offered his arm to his sister. Sarah took it gratefully.
Tony smiled softly down at the woman.
Steven squeezed Tony’s hand before dropping it and taking his seat. Tony followed his lead. Once they were seated others began to find spots at the various tables and started to eat the array of food laid out before them. Tony ate a little bit of everything to try and get a feel for the food of his new home. It was all in the same genre of food he was familiar with; cheese, bread, meed, meats of various kinds, but they were different all the same.
“That's my boy. Now,” Tony turned to the bedside table and picked up the book they had been reading before bed. Tony shifted on the bed so he could curl an arm around his son and still support the book. “lets pick up where we left off last night, shall we? What could The Men of the X get up to next?”
Tony turned back to his last trunk. He kneeled down and unlatched it. Inside was his blazing red and gold armor. Tony checked it over to ensure that it was none the worse for wear after the long voyage here. Thankfully, it was in the same perfect condition it had been when he had forged it on the mainland. Tony reached in and pulled out his sword. He unsheathed it and took a moment to admire the obsidian colored blade before replacing it in its scabbard. The glowing blue jewels sparked up at him from their places on the hilt as Tony replaced in at the top of the trunk.
Baby Sarah was in a similar state of near waking as her new brother had been. Steve smoothly moved his arms so that he could reach down and pick up the little baby before clutching her lovingly the his chest. She yawned widely in Steve's arms before nestling slightly into his warmth. Steve started swaying slightly to sooth both kids and hopefully get one or the other of them back to sleep.
Tony’s hands reached out and he lifted the goblet. He turned back to Steven and offered it to his husband.
The CEO came home every day exhausted and complaining about how the Board was nagging him as usual. So, in an attempt to keep from adding any extra stress to Tony’s already heavy load, Steve had kept this insecurity to himself. However, Tony could tell that there was something bothering his lover, even if Steve wouldn't say anything to him about it.
He felt rather than heard the metal thing land right behind him. In an instant a comforting metal clad hand was on Steve's back and the warm and decidedly guilty voice of his lover was in his ear.
Tony gazed down at the length or woven rope he held in his hand. It was the colors of his house woven together in a twisting pattern. Thor and his family had accompanied Tony on the voyage from the continent to the “green isle” as Thor had called it and had given Tony the rope he’d had crafted then. Thor and King Steven, who Tony was engaged to marry, were cousins and Thor had insisted that as his self proclaimed “Celtic brother” he must accompany Tony beyond the sea and ensure Tony’s honor was maintained by the engagement turning into a marriage. It was just the sort of thing that Tony had come to expect from the Nordic Celts. Tony loved them dearly, but sometimes their culture still confused him. Much like this rope thing confused him.
Tony had an equally relieved look and visibly slumped at having found his wayward children, however, he was much quicker to notice his daughter’s position and evident distress.
“I missed you to.” Tony whispered. “But,” He cleared his throat. “There are so many things we need to talk about before we can move forward.”
Steve smiled down at Tony.
There was a fierce layer of protective fury inlaid in her words that clearly told Steve if he hurt Tony he would regret it. Tony shivered. Pepper was scary when she wanted to be. Steve merely nodded, apparently having sensed that Pepper was not to be trifled with. Probably for the best he figured that out now as opposed to later. Thor’s brother had made that mistake early on and it had taken three of Thor’s fiercest warriors to keep Pepper from killing him when he inevitably pissed her off.
"Well, you should." Thor replied helpfully.
“Bucky understands that you are my one and only. That is one of the many reasons why he is my Tanist, my right hand. He will honor you and our vows even if I should die tomorrow.” Steve said solemnly.
“Kitty!” came a very loud and high pitched scream.
Steven was starting to look distinctly uneasy now. Tony knew that the Celts didn’t follow the same types of customs the Etruscan’s did and had probably never seen anyone greet their leaders in such a way.
Steve and Tony shared a momentary look that clearly held an entire conversation between the two partners, but gave away nothing to T’Challa. When the couple broke eye contact, Steve turned to his comrade and nodded.
Tony took a moment to replace his mask, which he had removed after landing, and look over the embroidery. After a minute or so, Tony reached up and removed his mask again.
Tony heard what was distinctly a growl from behind him. Apparently his new alpha was the possessive type. Thor squeezed Tony one last time before putting him down. He slapped a hand down on Steven’s shoulder.
“She couldn’t…” Wanda started, looking at her twin brother hesitantly before continuing. “…she couldn't be developing a power could she?” Wanda asked worriedly.
Tony sighed and crossed his arms. “We need to talk.”
“I was born on this isle, my King. My father sold me and I was taken to King Anthony’s homelands. There he freed me. I am more loyal to him than to any other person alive or dead.” Pepper said.
Tony had met Bruce when the man who bought him had tried to beat Bruce to death in the market for saying something in the druid language. Tony had stopped it, had the man imprisoned, and nursed Bruce back to health before setting him free. To Tony’s surprise, Bruce had decided to stay with him just like Pepper and Rhodey had. The three of them had stayed with Tony through everything and had even come here with him. Tony didn’t think he deserved it for merely trying to right the wrongs right in front of him, but he couldn’t say he wasn’t grateful for they company. The there of them had been the ones who saved his life when Pierce had sacked their city and killed his parents. They meant everything to Tony.
Bruce’s eyes raked over Tony’s face before nodding. “Alright then.”
Tony hesitantly handed it over. This had to be too good to be true. He expected Steve to do something. Taught him. Make him work for this “gift”, but instead Steve gestured for him to turn around. After a moment’s hesitation, Tony did. Steve’s large hands pulled the thinest part of the metal necklace past Tony’s neck and gently reformed it so the circular ends just hit his collar bone. Tony’s hand reached up again to feel the smooth edges out of curiosity, brushing Steve’s in the process. Sparks flew up Tony’s fingers again and they only intensified when he felt Steve gently kiss the skin just above where the metal rested before pulling away from him entirely. Tony slowly turned back to face his betrothed, heat resting high on his cheeks.
This action only resulted in Tony crying harder, but for a completely different reason. One that he was perfectly ok crying over.
“No, I don’t think it does.” Steven agreed solemnly.
As soon as the little girl spotted the King, she released another ecstatic cry.
Tony slowly stood and reached for the pitcher of meed. He filled the goblet most of the way and set the pitcher aside. He looked up to see that Steven had taken the bag from Bucky and was patiently waiting for Tony to face him. Their eyes met once more. Steven smiled down at him before looking down again. He reached into the bag and pulled out a long dagger.
“Not here.” King T’Challa said in a whisper. “We should go meet up with the others.” He suggested.
Steve shot him a put upon look.
It was this scene that a triumphant looking Tony charged in on, newly printed birth certificate in hand. Tony paused for an instant as he took in the sight before him. His lover stood tall with their two children clutched in his arms, a happy and contented look on his face face. Their son, one thumb in his mouth and the other arm still clutching his teddy bear, balanced on Steve's hip. Their new baby girl sleeping curled against Steve's strong chest. It was a sight to behold and Tony could feel his heart melting into a giant puddle of mush at how wonderful it all was.
Tony’s shock must have shown in his face because Steve chuckled lightly.
"Thanks Thor. We shouldn't be back too late. See you latter" With this Tony started trying to lead his partner to the door.
“I know you have.” Tony replied, but a slightly guilty look overcame his face.
“We are going to dance now.” She stated decisively, half dragging Tony out onto the floor.
“Of corse she does. She loves you too.” He replied softly.
Silence almost seemed to echo in the space between them. Tony looked away. In truth he had missed Steve like a lost limb, but he was still furious with the man for keeping the truth from him. From fighting him to let Barnes get away. Tony knew the moment the fight was over that the man couldn’t be held accountable for something he was forced to do, but the shock and pain had blinded him to that. If only Steve had told him sooner than it never would have happened, but his husband hadn’t trusted him. And then he had fought him, hurt him physically as well as emotionally. There was so much pain and mistrust and hurt between them that Tony wondered how they would ever get past it.
Little Sarah, who was almost a year old now, enjoyed watching her brother’s antics and seemed to especially enjoy the desperate attempts her parents made to try and get Peter off the walls and into the cage like playpen.
"Well?" Steve questioned.
“You said something about bed, Steven.” Tony murmured.
“Tony?” Steve asked.
Steve reached down and took Tony’s hand again. “I’ll show you to our quarters and then give you a tour.”
“Rest assured, I will be thoroughly looking into him.” He declared, eyeing Steve and Tony in particular at this statement.
“You.” Tony said softly. Almost as if he was afraid speaking it aloud would make it true. “You and our kids. You obviously tried to protect them, but they’re still covered in….” Tony sucked in a sharp breath. Unable to bring himself to finish his sentence, but it wasn't necessary. Steve had gotten the message loud and clear. His blood froze at the mere thought of his children, his babies, dead. Dead on some unknown battlefield somewhere where Steve himself is unable to protect them.
Steve and Tony walked through the doors of the building hand in hand. They entered what appears to be the great hall. The high ceiling was curves inward in a mockery of the mountain behind it and tall metal stands lined the walls fires burning brightly to light the space. In the center of the room was a small cluster of impressively large chairs facing the doorway. There were a series of five chairs all lighted up together. In the center of the pack was a large and intricately carved chair that Tony assumed was meant for the king. To the right of the King’s chair sat a slightly smaller version of it. The rest of the chairs were all noticeably smaller and less intricate than those other two chairs. In one of these chairs sat a petite blonde woman with the same glowing blue eyes Tony had been mesmerized by since he first saw them. Around the woman stood several old men and behind her stood a tall man with the same graying blond hair.
Tony fluttered his eyelashes even as Steve rolled his eyes.
Tony’s eyes roamed over the country side they were riding through. It really was beautiful. The colors were so different from his own home. They were darker, richer. The forest was alive in ways Tony had never experienced before. It was also like it was a living, breathing, entity.
Tony crumpled to the floor in a heap of despair, he must have spent a good twenty minutes curled up on the floor trying to pull himself together when Peter cautiously came up to him.
"I got it." Tony said, waving the still warm piece of paper in the air. "Sarah Taelyn Adeline Rogers-Stark. Born on May 19th. Daughter of Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Its official. She's ours."
Tony expected Steve to say something, anything, but he remained silent just staring at the ceiling.
Oh. That was one thing Tony expected to have to deal with after marrying a celt that he wasn’t looking froward to.
Steve smiled brilliantly before raising to his full height, his mother’s hand dropping elegantly back into her lap.
Tony shook his head. “He could care less. Bruce, Pepper, Rhodey, they all were victims of my father’s greed. My father allowed the slave trade in the city to expand far beyond anything that had been done perviously. He and most of the rest of the nobility didn’t actually see them as people so of course they didn’t care what happened to them so long as it provided those bastards with a cheep labor force. I did what I could to counter that, but there was only so much I could do myself. I was my father’s heir, but in his eyes I could never be good enough.” Steve’s fingers tightened infinitesimally against his cheek, but their caress continued just as gently as it started.
They were soon faced by an even greater threat than before, this time one of their own creation, or more specifically Tony’s creation: Ultron. In order to protect their children, the heroes left them with Clint’s previously unknown wife and family. They trusted that the safeguards Fury had set up to protect their fellow Avenger’s family would be suitable for defending their own children as well.
He then moved the trunk over to sit innocently besides the trunk that held his husband’s armor. An Alpha and Omega pair that were ready for war. It was fitting seeing as the purpose of this union was a martial one. The light in the room was fading now. Tony had barley noticed the passage of time as he worked and was started when there was another knock at the door.
Tony looked up at his friend and took in the winding blue patterns that were painted all over his skin. Objectively Tony knew that Bruce was a druid priest, but it was something else entirely to see it in person. Tony had become used to the way the Celtic people’s of the continent dressed during his two years with them, but the druid priestly robes were nothing like Tony expected them to be. They were gray, loose, and flowing. They were tied with a rope made of purple and dark green fibers with several types of plants tucked into it that must have had some meaning that Tony didn’t know.
With the reminder that they did in fact have two kids, Tony swung himself out of bed and went to help Steve with their infant children. He ended up being the one to change Sarah’s diaper, the reason that she and then her brother had been crying. After getting his baby girl a clean diaper, Tony proceed to fawn over the one month old infant.
Clint bowed slightly before hastily walking away, leaving a stream of mumbles in his wake.
Steve’s hands moved from Tony’s face to his back and pulled him flush against Steve’s chest. Tony moaned. He moved one of his own hands from Steve’s hair to grip at the back of his tunic. Steve’s hands started exploring all over Tony’s body. Their groans seemed to fill the tent as Tony’s body seemed to heat more and more, mouths never discontenting for more than a moment’s breath. Steve reached both hands down and grasped the globes of Tony’s ass through his clothes before pulling them ever so slightly apparat. Tony pulled back from their kiss and threw his head back in a loud moan, the smell of his own slick hitting his nose.
“You can be the greatest genius and the most skilled, but you’re nothing if you’re not respectful, Sir.”
They sighed, only for Tony to choke on his spit and for Steve to release a whimpering noise once Thor’s words caught up. “Warriors? As in plural? As in two?” Tony squeaked out. Steve went a little pale, almost faint. Sam had to put a hand on his shoulder to keep him from hitting the ground.
“I can’t feel anything,” Tony said, voice higher pitched than usual.
“Sure, see you tonight.” Tony watched as both his friends disappeared, leaving him alone to pull the carriage closer to the race.
The alpha’s dick literally twitching when Tony slowly moved his hand to pull his pants further down enough to reveal his pulsing lips could attest to it. The feeling from having a confined heat leaving for the cool exposure left him shivering and wanting to regain the warmth again. He pressed his body flush against Steve’s, welcoming the embrace from the furnace the alpha’s body created. The little space between them created enough room for Tony to pull his right pant leg down to his knee, revealing his shivers to the world.
A knowing sparkle appeared in her eyes and a smile graced her lips. She shared a look with Fury, switching the stage to him. Without moving his cape glided slightly with no wind felt as he said, “Then you know what happened to the characters. The whole getting wings and causing a war between its fans that lead to its cancellation, or at least that’s what it’s presumed. God knows we hear it every time from Barton and Wilson when they complain about the change.”
All around him there was nothing out of the ordinary, but he couldn’t calm his instincts of something being wrong. With a deep breath he pushed on. Perhaps it was the town itself, or perhaps many shifters in one place and being alone amongst them was sending his senses in a frenzy.  Reaching the road and being away from the people might help calm his nerves.
The coyote that had to be Sam joined in on the fun and started running after Clint and Vision. Thor joined soon after. The difference between the three shifters was so large that Tony was surprised they managed to run and roll around and playfully bite without accidentally hurting each other. Thor appeared alpha, meaning he was larger than the betas, even if he was a feline shifter. If anything, being a feline made him bigger than the canines by default, and Tony wouldn't be surprised if Thor turned out to be bigger than Steve. The lion was as big as life.
“We didn’t do anything,” Steve said.
“Something wrong?” Steve seemed to have noticed his questioning frown.
Tony’s blood ran cold. The last words anyone wanted to hear.
“Tony,” Steve’s voice was surprisingly soft, kind, “could you open your eyes for me, please?” Tony did what he was told, coming to the sight of Steve’s caring eyes that were looking at him as if he was the world. “Is that what you thought we were doing the whole time? Getting back at you for running into us?”
“I can’t help it. You smell so good.”
Tony’s lower lip poked out slightly. "I can’t bring him back with me?"
“All the better. We won’t have to posture around and puff out our chests.”
This had been, and still was, his cherished work. The finest he had ever done. He slaved for days, manipulated for weeks, in order to get the perfect ratio and the perfect strength. Then he slaved for more when he fitted the runes. Magic from the runes was hard to work with on its own, but to integrate it with an object for the two to work peacefully and flawlessly. To have the gauntlets strong enough to withstand the magic, and to have the magic of the runes measured perfect as to not obliterate the gauntlets? It took hours of concentration, hours that Tony had done willingly and proudly.
The Avengers may not have reached him yet but that didn’t mean Tony was going to sit and wait complacently. He was Tony Stark. Once upon a time, that name had meant something. Before he presented omega, before he became known as Tony
The only silver lining was his age, he guessed. He was old and was excused for falling on the ground. It was almost expected by everyone that elders had trouble walking after a while, even though Tony wasn’t
won’t allow it to get into my head. Humility is an attractive trait.”
It took seconds but eventually Steve did lift his head enough to reveal his watery blue eyes. Tony couldn’t resist kissing his forehead, wanting to brush the sadness away. “I didn’t know you were doing it because you were worried I’d leave you. I thought you just didn’t want me talking to any of my friends.”
The rotten bed creaked when he sat on it. An example of his emotions. Any moment the tiniest bit of stress and pressure was going to make him buckle completely and he’d be at the mercy of Hammer and Stane.
“You don’t see me fighting alongside all of you, do you?”
In the meantime he’d figure the lion and the python were close enough for Loki to experience the same thing Sam was feeling at watching his mate make a fool of himself and furiously ignoring it. The rest of the pack were doing a very good job doing so. Must have happened a lot.
“Should anything happen grab what you absolutely need and run. You know where Hank’s shop is located. Grab what you feel best suits any situation and act fast.” Steve reminded the two betas staying behind. “If running is your safest option head for Hattan and seek shelter. Head further East if you must. We'll find you.”
Winter holds no such hesitation. “Steve’s gone feral. Everyone step back. We can’t spook him. Who’s got a tranq?”
From the corner of his eye Tony could see the alpha just sitting there, possibly staring at him and thinking something over. The urge to run away was filling his senses and he knew, he
They remain locked like this until finally,
Tony swore to never allow that to happen. He was going to show Odin, show everyone, that he was no burden and nothing would fail because of him.
He groaned when one particular thrust combined with Steve rubbing the very tip of his dick sent him over the edge. His walls tightened, trying to encourage his alpha’s knot to pop and the idea of being knotted together again made his hips push back without his control, forcing his alpha to go deeper. He moaned from the sensation of Steve’s hot seed bursting in mixed with the pleasure of his own release and the feeling of triumph at having his alpha’s knot catch in his walls, locking them together. His nerves were on fire and it felt so good.
Tony averted his eyes. “Better. I’m better. T-thank you. I’ll just leave now…”
“If I may, Young Vision and I are beyond the age of being considered infants. If you are to address us, do so as adults.”
He told Natasha as much and she snorted, held up her outrageously decorated mug and said something in what Steve assumed was Russian and took a swing. Steve followed suit and drank from his own in celebration to feeling good.
Tony turned and sure enough, there was Steve, making his way towards them. Hat in his hand. It was undamaged and even clean. Tony watched him warily as he got closer. When Steve handed the hat over to his boy with a smile did he finally relax.
Peter removed his hat and waved it around, trying to mimic the cowboys of the television and their dramatic antics. It was at that moment a strong gust blew through and took the hat right out of Peter’s hand. Both centaur and child watched helplessly as it landed right in the middle of the track.
There had to be another reason why the pack didn’t chase after him but Tony wasn’t going to complain. He was still here with only a sprained wrist for his troubles and about to have rabbit for late breakfast with Bruce.
Tony blinked and found, huh, that Jarvis had been right. During their little talk, he had ended up walking right up to the table of the lone omega shifter and had just stood there, bickering with the cockatoo as the other omega watched in… amusement? He was smiling, covering his mouth with his hand but Tony could still see the corners of his mouth facing upward. That was a good start and a good opening.
“I believe you might want to read this, Sir,” Jarvis said with a twinkle in his mechanical eyes.
“Throw it in the river, get it out of the way.”
“Okay, Pete. Time to get down,” May said and held up her arms, meaning to help Peter down.
, was he officially in his cycle now? Had he finally entered it? He felt as if he had. It was so
Loki tapped the ground with his staff, gaining their attention. “Then perhaps we require the day to be cut shortly. The quicker we obtain our merchandize the better.”
The python stared, making him shiver. Those eyes of his were intense. “May I?”
“Beautiful, isn’t it?” He heard Steve say and he agreed. The sight was beautiful. He turned to say as much but found that Steve wasn’t even facing the landscape when he had asked. He was staring at him.
Steve scanned the room and didn't see anyone else. He quickly made his way over to the crying baby, depositing his shield on his back as he did. He gently picked up the poorly swaddled baby and cradled it gently in the crock of his arm. The child's crying stopped nearly immediately, though it was obvious that the baby still wasn't entirely comfortable.
“You don't wike-” Steve immediately clamped his free hand over his mouth, his eyes going wide with shock and embarrassment. Fortunately for Steve, everyone was a little more concerned with Sarah’s behavior than Steve’s unintentional baby talk. “Like. Who do you not like?” Steve recovered quickly.
In an over abundance of caution, the new parents had decided that Peter was not to leave their newly updated security laden home until the dust had settled after his family's murder.
Steve regretfully withdrew his hand allowing Tony to pull away again. Steve placed his goblet of meed down next to him and retrieved the satchel from where he had placed it on the furs without Tony’s notice. Stupid. Tony chided to himself. How had he been too lost in Steve to notice something so simple? He needed to be better then that. He couldn’t let Steve see his weaknesses.
“It’s beautiful.” Tony murmured as they moved farther into the valley basin.
Tony, for his part, had encouraged Steve to go. He knew how bad it must be for their comrades to be unable to handle the situation on their own and he would not let them be put in unnecessary danger. Even if that meant allowing the love of his life to go back into a war zone without him being there to back him up.
In the end it took the three of them two hours to get Peter down and it was only because Peter had exhausted himself and smashed every even remotely interesting object in sight. It had been Tony who caught Peter and as a reward he ended up pinned to the floor by the enchanted hammer that now, apparently, two people could wield. Tony was decidedly not "getting lucky" tonight.
Tony leaned forward, just enough so that Steve’s fingers finally made their arc along his skin instead of just the air. He felt goosebumps rise all over his body at the contact.
Tony took a moment to really look at her face. He could see the genuine emotion hidden behind the mask of neutrality she wore. It seemed she really did care for the man she was married to.
“Don’t hold it against him,” Bucky said but nodded to the question. “He’s… he acts confident, and he is, to a certain extent, but when it comes to mates it’s a whole other story.”
is the last word I would use to describe your scent,” Jarvis said. “I would also note, your cycle’s pheromones have drastically changed in comparison to the last few previous to us joining the Avengers. You smell similar to that of vetiver mixed with that of sandalwood and cinnamon. A most alluring smell in comparison to your previous.”
Rhodey went silent for a moment, taking in what he had said. “What do you mean by ‘stench of the deceased?’”
Tony growled, partly in annoyance at his height being pointed out and mostly out of fondness because, his old friends were
Now, let me take a moment to do this. I'm not asking for much. This is my second fic that's reached the 100k mark and to celebrate all I want is for you wonderful readers to comment and let me know, what made you click on this fic and give it a try?
“Mister Tony, hurry!” Peter waved at him.
The alpha didn’t respond.
Nothing.
. I can’t give him any children. Pups for him to dote on, to rock to sleep, for him to be a great father to,” he hadn’t meant to but the frustration slipped into his tone.
On second thought, maybe now wasn't the best time to think about that. Not with Steve right in front of him and having just recently… yeah.
“It’s a good thing I brought enough coin then.”
“I’m not exactly a fighter, though,” Pepper admitted. “I’ve never handled a weapon.”
“Who are you?”
“You don’t have to stay if you don’t want to,” Sam reassured him, a spark of understanding in his eyes. Tony felt a spike of fear from it. Had the beta pieced it together? Had he realized what Tony had been doing, even though Tony didn’t mean to? “Tony, you’re
They were heading towards the Smithy. The lovingly named building that crafted and sold everything related to racing. They had items and equipment that ranged from harnesses to carts to hats and boots. There was a present waiting for Peter there. Something his boy had been talking about non-stop for the past few weeks. Something that Ben and May had mentioned to Tony beforehand. With Tony’s blessing, they had gone ahead and ordered the present weeks prior. Long before the festival had officially started.
When could he have possibly met Steve? Had he ever met him, or were they talking about someone else?
“Your pheromones are different, Sir.”
Tony took in every detail of every structure and every color and every sight. In doing so he failed to notice the pack slowing down to a stop and nearly collided with Thor’s back. Bruce holding him still was the only reason it didn’t happen. Everyone was facing the same direction, including Bruce. Their gazes were aimed at Hank, who was hunched over slightly and had his arm pressed against his chest, shaking. Jan was nearby with her hand on his shoulder for support, but even Tony could see she was a bit shaken herself as well.
For Sam to be serious was one thing, for Clint it was another story entirely. It meant they were speaking the truth. The two honestly wanted a relationship with his Rhodey and Tony realized, after living together for months and getting to know the two betas, he approved of the pair. Rhodey would compliment their personalities and balance them out and the two would give Rhodey a funny bone or ten. Maybe finally make him lighten up.
That was news. Bad news. If Rhodey’s military pack were to catch wind of Rhodey creating his own pack they might think he’s abandoning them and might dishonorably discharge him for it. “Please tell me you haven’t been seen by any military packs out there,” Tony begged.
The redhead smiles mischievously. “Of course I am. I used to be a spy.”
“Thank you, Jarvis. Please give Ana my best.” Tony replied, pushing past Jarvis and into the main living space.
While Steve was slightly disappointed at not being able to remove Tony’s last vestiges of clothing with his own two hands (or maybe someplace more interesting? A mouth maybe? Oh Steve would have to try that next time), he most definitely appreciated the sight. The ex-playboy’s smirk only grew as he looked down at his lover.
"Whats with the baby?" Tony deadpanned.
“We know, Tony.” Rhodey said, he and Pepper raising their heads. “But you are our King, and now he is too. We choose to bow to you and we choose to honor what you have done for us.”
Steve’s previously stoic face had a soft, glowing smile on it now and it was directed at Tony. Tony’s traitorous little heart fluttered slightly. Maybe he hadn’t ruined anything after all.
________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
She pulled him into the center of the floor and pushed her hands flat against his. “You know the moves right.” Her words just barley audible over the drums.
Under his clothing trunk Tony found his smithy equipment. Tony moved this trunk
Tony looked up at Steve, removing the hand that he had unconsciously brought up to his chin when he began thinking of possible names.
"You really are like a doting grandfather aren't you Fury." Tony had teased.
“I swear to be honest and true. To calm you, keep you, and honor you.” Tony said, managing to say it as well as he possibly could.
“Well then…” Tony started. “I suppose both of us were living different lives then.”
Maybe he could convince Steven to get a second one so they could work together.
Tony managed to eat enough food to appease the red head apparently because she grabbed his hand and pulled him up out of his seat.
Steven opened his mouth and said, “I swear to be honest and true. To guard you, keep you, and honor you.”
“Oh, yes you are!” Tony continued, blowing a raspberry into his daughters stomach. “How will I ever get laid with such a cute little cock blocker in the house?”
He gestured to the ropes and Steven nodded. The brunette man began untying the ropes and soon Tony felt them go slack on his wrist. The man pulled the ropes away, allowing their hands to fall. He then moved to drape Tony’s rope around Steven’s neck and, after a pause and another nod from is betrothed, Steven’s around Tony’s neck. The man stepped back and grasped the woman’s hand in his own. Ah, they must be married.
Tony walked over to him, tying Steve’s hoodie around his waist as he went. When he was with in reach, Tony threw his arms around his husband’s waist and pressed his head between his broad shoulders. Steve started rubbing softly at where Tony’s hands were joined in front of him.
“Yes. Until you have learned how to behave yourself” Steve said smugly before parading victoriously out of the nursery.
Tony opened his mouth to argue, but stopped when Steve curled around him. His arms pulling Tony in tighter to him. Tony felt safe in Steve’s arms in a way that he had really felt before. His life had always hung on the brink of disaster, but here in his fiancé’s embrace it felt like nothing could touch him.
"Um….." Tony replied intelligently. "Because…. I forgot I could?"
“Steve?”
He would honestly rather not tell Steve the rest if he could help it, but he might end up having to. That was not a conversation Tony was looking forward to.
He deftly jumped through the hole in the wall and began looking around the inside of the building. He had made it about halfway through the rather large structure when a loud sound made him jump.
Steve reached over and the baby unconsciously grabbed hold of one of his fingers in her tiny fist. Peter chose this moment to once again drop his bag of cheerios, which was caught in an instant by Steve. This feat elected another ecstatic cry and bought clapping from Peter. Steve gently gave the bag back to Peter, who by this point had decided he was tired of being ignored again and started kicking Steve.
“Goodnight, Daddy. Love you too.”
There. That explained at least part of it and hopefully kept Steve from realizing how pathetic he really was. This was going to be a loveless marriage just like his parent’s own union. That was always going to be his fate. He should just be grateful his betrothed was hot and seemed to be a decent man so far. That could change though. Tony knew just how quickly a seemingly kind man could turn vicious.
“…as you are.”
“Of course not, sire.” Minister Ku said to his King with a slight bow of his head. “If you’ll excuse me?”
Tony hadn’t attempted suicide again after witnessing what it did to his lover, but Steve knew that it was a close thing. He was well aware of the guilt that Tony felt over creating Ultron in the first place, but he also knew that his lover’s willingness to go to such drastic measures in order to protect their friends, their family, and the rest of the world had stemmed from something. The same something that was eating Tony from the inside out. Steve tried to do everything he could, but it just didn't seem to change anything.
Tony nodded. “I don’t forgive you yet,” He looked up at Steve. “but I’m willing to give you another chance.”
Fury had sent one of his men out to find the head of the orphanage and drag her back to the helacarier. She was met with a great deal of anger from all the shield agents and Avengers. At first she hasn't understood until she had seen the baby that Steve was clutching protectively. As soon as saw the child that she referred to as a "worthless brat", she exploded in anger. It escalated to the point that Fury was so angry that he had actually yelled at the woman, who preceded to begrudgingly hand over all the information the orphanage had on the baby girl before swiftly leaving. It wasn't much, but it did confirm Tony's earlier fear that his new baby daughter had been abandoned at the orphanage in the first place.
It had been a hard few months for Steve and Tony. It had begun wonderfully with the adoption of their precious baby girl. They’d had a peaceful couple of months with her and Peter to get used to the newest iteration of their family, but reality had soon come crashing down on them.
“Hmm?” Steve answered noncommittally.
Bruce was far too serious for Tony’s tastes. Tony looked away, heat high on his cheeks from the dedication his friend was showing him. Tony knew where Bruce’s dedication to him stemmed from and firmly believed that he didn’t deserve that kind of loyalty for merely doing what anyone should have done. Tony hated the slave trade with a burning passion. He used to often go down to the docks in his city and buy all the slaves the traders brought just to free them later. It pissed his father off and often got Tony beaten, but anything was better than allowing hundreds of people to be forced into a fate even worse than Tony’s was.
“What do you think you’re doing here?” Tony snapped.
“Then I promise.” Steve stated in a slightly shaky murmur.
Tony walked decisively over to the bed and pulled back the blanket and furs. He wormed his way under the warm blankets, grateful that whatever servants had lit the candles in their room for the night hadn’t left the metal bed warmer under the covers. The weather was still teetering on the edge of summer and fall. If they had done anything more than run the hot coals under the sheets it would be too warm to stand. Tony pulled the blankets up and curled up as best he could, mentally preparing for whatever was to come.
“I swear.” Tony replied as he tried to press himself even further against his partner.
“Finally.” Tony said in an indignant tone. “Its about time you were laid bare for me.”
King T’Challa was currently standing in a very last minute and remarkably boring “meeting” with one of his older advisors. He was supposed to have been at the landing pad to greet his friends and fellow Avengers almost 20 minutes ago. He had invited them all here for a celebration in their honor. Didn’t his dimwitted minister realize how incredibly rude he was making his King appear to be?
Steve reached out for the silver handle and opened the thick door. It opened to a large rounded room with a four poster bed in the center of it. The floor was covered in soft furs and there were two large circles of glass embedded in the stone wall. Their circumference must have been as long as Tony’s arm.
The two of them stared each other down for a moment before grinning snidely at each other. Oh, Tony liked her.
"It says, 'Klän Orphanage'" Tony stated with a hint of concern in his voice.
“He hated the fact that I was an omega among other things, even if it suited him in the end. He had always planed to eventually auction me off to the highest bidder among the aristocracy of the city and breed me to get a real male heir to take the throne. Preferably an alpha.”
“Yes, Steven, I do believe you have chosen your consort wisely. Now,” she turned back to the others in the room. “You have heard what I have to say. My son will hear anything else you wish to impart on the matter soon.” And with a dismissive hand gesture, the room cleared save for Steve, Sarah, Tony himself, and the man standing behind Sarah Rogers’s chair.
As soon as Thor could no longer hear the engine of his friends' expensive car, Thor walked into the living room and sat himself and the young Peter on the couch.
Tony sighed. “I’ll be right there.”
“Does this place go into the mountain?” Tony asked his fiancé, his eyes now greedily coming over the stone wall at the back of the room and the three doorways carved into it.
“I think its about time for us to retire.” Steve said, an almost breathless huff to his voice.
A hush fell over the throne room. The lords and ladies of the court who had previously been milling around the edges of the room were suddenly silent except for the few shocked gasps that escaped from the gaggle. The King turned away from his captain of the guard, James Rhodes, to look at the man approaching him. The minute his eyes landed on the white star in the center of the silver armor, he tensed.
“Samuel, it is an honor to meet you.” Tony replied with a nod of his head.
Fury's only response was a grunt while the rest of the avengers, minus Steve who was putting down the kids for a much needed nap, lost it with laughter.
"You have no idea" Steve sighed defeatedly, shaking his head slightly in exasperation.
Tony pushed open the door and quickly dropped his hand. There standing just inside the entrance to the floor stood Steve Rogers.
Tony felt his spine stiffed as a derisive laugh slipped past his lips.
Steve opened and closed his mouth several times. “I- I honestly don’t even know where to start.”
“And you seem observant.” Tony replied, his young apparently still sharp despite the cotton filling his head.
“They’re amazing.” Tony stated, reaching for another paper to examine.
“I love you too.”
There was an emergency! Shield had issued the highest level warning in their system and had called in all the members of the Avengers, including Steve and Tony. At first the couple had been frantic about what to do about their baby boy, but the problem was too large and important to waste time. Besides, the only people they trusted to keep their precious son safe were also called into action. So, the new parents had been forced into drastic measures.
Tony ground his hips suggestively against Steve’s groin, making the move obvious enough that Clint would have to notice what he was doing.
Tony whined. “Why?” Tony asked breathlessly.
When they finally pulled away a bright smile graced Tony’s lips. He leaned up to kiss Steve’s forehead before moving to stand and get ready for bed, but the super soldier, it turned out, had other ideas.
“Yeah I get the whole 1940s thing that a man is supposed to be the ‘bread winner’ and ‘bring home the bacon’ and all the other crap they call it, but this is the 21st century and thats bull shit.” The shorter male gestated rapidly, his hands flying in random directions. “You staying here and taking care of our children is far more important than my stupid job! You are not useless. In fact you probably do more work than I do” Tony ranted, his voice ever escalating in both volume and emotion.
Suddenly a cry erupted from the baby monitor on Steve’s night stand. The couple jumped and broke apart, both of them looking at the baby monitor that the genius billionaire had enhanced because he’s Tony Stark. How could he ever resist improving upon the poor excuse for a machine that Clint had given them once they told him about adopting Peter?
Steve escorted him from the room and they slowly made their way down the hall.
A hand clapped Tony firmly on the shoulder. “Are you ready?” Bruce asked, thankfully in Tony’s native tongue.
Tony debated for around half an hour before Steve stepped in again and picked Adeline in an attempt to speed along the process.
Steven gently lead Tony over to a small table already littered with food. It was set at the head of a long U made up of other tables with a large bonfire in the middle. At some point music had begun to play and people were already filling the empty center space to dance.
“What’s wrong?” He asked.
There was a moment of tense silence as the two men stared at each other.
“Whatever the circumstances,…” King T’Challa bravely broke the heavy silence. “she got the measure of my Minister rather quickly. I have always thought that something was off with that man, and she just proved that I was right to be suspicious.”
“Oh”. Peter’s eyes drifted from Tony’s face to the canopy of his bed. “Is he going to stay here again.”
Peter’s eyes lit up and he opened his mouth to say something, but Tony cut him off before he could start.
“Wha…?”
“You speak Gaelic?” Steven asked, eyebrows furrowing in confusion.
“Are you cold?” Steve asked, noticing Tony pulling his cloak closer around himself.
Tony’s fingers encounter one of the cold strands of metal in the rope, drawing his attention back to his present situation. The rope was made from material that Thor had somehow managed to smuggle out of Tony’s city, which was as close to home as Tony had gotten in over two years. It was comprised of two large thick cords of vibrant red material with several thin lines of gold woven through it and a single, vibrant blue string that twisted playfully through the other two colors. His fingers followed the path of the blue cord as he spun the rope around in his hand.
"Sarah huh?" Tony said. Testing the name. "I like it, but its a little old fashioned. Maybe we should balance it out with a name she wont hate us for?"
Tony finished undoing the ties and pulled off the stiff fabric. He laid it on the dresser next to his discarded crown and quickly pulled off his belt, pulling out his danger as he did so. He threw the belt next to the doublet and moved to sit on his side of the bed, placing the danger on the bedside table.
“No, I am not going to tell you where they are. I’m sure you and ned will be running around them far sooner than I’m ready for, but promise me that you will always tell Jarvis, Uncle Rhodey, or me when you do. For my sake?”
Tony looked around and took in the intricate carvings on the stone wall in front of them. It curved up in a dome and met the thick wood that made up the rest of the building. This seem was decorated and reinforced with some metal braces.
Several hours latter, Steve and Tony had returned from their evening out. Steve looked much more relaxed about the whole situation than when they left the house. Tony, for his part, looked very pleased with himself and was wearing and expression that practically screamed "I'm getting lucky tonight". That was, however, before the two of them registered the sight that awaited them inside the house.
Steve gave Tony a gentle smile as he gestured for Tony to sit. Tony stiffened, the gesture was innocent enough, but it had always come with the insinuation that Tony was weak and useless, unable to even sit on his own. He knew this was not the space to refuse it, even if Tony suspected his fiancé didn’t have the same intentions with the gesture that Tony’s father had. He kept his expression carefully blank as he took the offered seat. Only after he was settled did Steve move to sit in his own seat, but Tony was numb. He didn’t hear anything around him. He lost the train of conversation and the din of the sounds around him faded into a harsh buzz. It reminded him too much of other parties back home. Parties where he was just a prize to be shown off and traded for favors.
It was during one of Peter’s now frequent rampages that a particularly bad episode hit Tony. In an instant the innocent image of his baby daughter in her elephant themed infant floor seat (which Steve had picked because he thought it was cute and perfect for the non-powered baby girl) turned into an image of her bloody and mangled body.
“As am I. I can’t thank you enough.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hello,” Tony managed. The words nearly getting stuck in his throat.
Rhodey was left with his mouth open and eyes wide. Eyebrows steadily going higher and higher with each statement until they nearly reached his hairline. He searched the room for help but found none as all the Avengers were either snickering to themselves, were covering their faces in second hand embarrassment or were groaning at the pair.
“He gets that from you,” Tony said so to the bird, placing his hand over Vision and petting.
Bucky shrieked and leaped away, narrowly avoiding the Hulk’s full mass on him, but the large wave the Hulk created still caught him. It caught everyone in the vicinity, in fact. No one had been safe. Not even Jarvis, Redwing, or Vision, who had been relaxing by the edge of the pond, believing they were safe from the dreadful liquid.
“Then it is a good thing I know exactly where they are heading,” said a voice that was created almost of pure hissing.
Clint was smiling with his tongue out. “Great. That means you’re not against contact, right? I don’t have to worry about you pushing me away when I snuggling up against you. ‘Cause I will. I’m warning you now.”
Tony.
Bucky released a ‘ha’ before he said, “You think that’s bad? Try growing up with him. Nut wouldn’t shut up for days.
A whistle nearly made him jump. So unexpected for his current situation. Bucky walked over to him while staring at the direction Steve most likely left to. “Didn’t know you had it in you. The shouting,” he elaborated when Tony frowned in question. “I knew Stevie was getting overbearing and you’d eventually snap, but actually seeing it happen? I’m impressed. Lets me know you won’t take everything Steve does or says.”
“Probably,” Steve said bluntly. Not even bothering to sugarcoat it. “At least it'll be quick and painless?”
Tony hadn’t been groomed in… well, in such a long time. He was starting to realize there were a lot of things that hadn’t been done to him, or to better phrase it, he was realizing there were a lot of things that
And to prove her point Steve and Natasha grabbed empty plates and began adding to it. Bucky stood with his arms crossed and pointedly stared at Sam. “What, you didn’t fix us up a plate?”
“I was worried for
Instead Tony just huffed back and rested his head again, sighing and closing his eyes. He must have fallen asleep again because the next time he opened his eyes he felt groggy and grumpy and had this nagging sensation that he was forgetting something. His heart almost leaped out of his throat when he remembered the Avengers and Steve and the invitation. He sat straight up and looked around in a panic, ready to vault to his feet, but all he found for his mini heart attack was a still dark shack with a sleeping Bruce curled up next to him and Vision resting next to his hip. He nearly jumped out of his skin when Jarvis suddenly hopped onto his stomach, all puffed up with the yellow coloring showing under his wings and at the base of his tail feathers. The long white plumage on his head was standing up in anticipation.
“Bucky is his nickname based on his middle name he can’t stand. Stuck with him ever since. Guess we have the same taste in friends.”
That sounded worth it. They’ll keep their happiness.
Steve had made quick work gently bending him over his anvil and pulling down his pants. He half expected his alpha to just rut, but over time he realized Steve absolutely loved having his mouth on him. To kiss, to lick, to suck and to bite. There was an oral fixation and Tony had no room to complain about it, not when Steve began licking the little slick mixed with his sweat and the ash that had clung to his skin and put his lips on every intimate spot between his legs.
“That’s
Taking first place in a surprising landslide is Bruce/Natasha, beating Bruce/Thor, Bruce/Pepper, Bruce/Loki, Sam/Natasha, Pepper/Natasha and Clint/Natasha.
So if you follow me or visit my Tumblr you're more or less aware of the reasons why it took forever to update.
He followed the general direction the smell came from, sniffing more than necessary and imagining the flavors that would sing on his tongue if he took a bite out of the source. His stomach was churning, outraged that it wasn’t already digesting the food.
Out of instinct, Tony closed his eyes. A reflex he clearly hadn’t grown out of no matter how much time had passed away from the man he had once called family. Often, when Stane called his name in that tone, a verbal discipline followed, along with a firm hand to discourage future defiance.
