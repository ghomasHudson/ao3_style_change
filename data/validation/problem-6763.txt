With only a towel covering the lower part of his body, he placed his dirty clothes on the counter and proceeded to rummage the fridge. That is if he hadn’t stayed rooted at his spot as he stared at the note plastered on it.
Then again, even in his situation, Loki would still find things to complain about or insult. Unlike Thor, he’s a guy you could impress pretty easily, contrary to Loki who wouldn’t be impressed to anything unless he made it himself.
Bruce was just about to turn around as Tony gave his best not to roll his eyes. “I seriously have no idea how you survive around here,” Tony said as he pushed his stuff to make room for Bruce’s belongings. “Sit, god knows I need human company before I kill myself out of boredom.” He wasn’t really bored, but to Tony, it’s not a conversation when there’s no exaggeration.
Nodding, Natasha grabbed her wallet from her jeans. “Everyone, contribute four dollars.” Then she turned to Thor and called “Hey big guy, pay your part for the pizza, it’s four dollars.”
Natasha raised an eyebrow and cocked her head slightly to the right. “As far as I’ve known there’s only one fridge and you’re standing in front of it.”
Taking the risk, Bruce took a step closer, “You know, you always act so high and mighty,” he said as he continued to step forward. Eyebrows furrowed, Loki stayed rooted on his spot.
Finally finished with his own set of boxed belongings—which took a whole month much to Bruce’s dismay, a new person finally moved in. Not that Tony’s like the other two tenants, it’s just that he’s almost as much of a hermit as the other two.
She wanted to ask them why the surprised expressions, it was obvious that Steve, Bruce, and Tony were just too scared to tell them that they wanted to just head back to their rooms, rather than give this bonding thing another try when they don’t even know how to act around each other. Sure the previous experience was great, even Natasha admits that he found it fun and wanted to do it again, but it was obvious that everyone was walking on eggshells.
“According to one of the seniors, ‘Still Life’ would be the most boring thing you’ll ever encounter,” Peggy complained, her thick English accent seeping out, as they skimmed the shelves for different types of drawing pencils. “Imagine drawing nothing but bananas and apples for months.”
“More commoners, how brilliant,” the kid drawled, earning him all of their attention again, with the addition of Steve.
And it was true, it’s been almost a week since the movie night and Clint has grown a rather unhealthy fixation about peepholes, he even got Thor convinced that it was a necessity. Natasha was never there to hear any of his complaints, but the notes on the fridge was enough.
That must have caught their attention because the looks on their faces immediately slid off. The next moment, Natasha was staring at two blinking owls rather than the two housewives.
Bruce glanced down at the mug in his hands then looked up at the bigger man. “Do you like drinking them?” Bruce asked, smiling. Probably finding the situation funny.
Unlike Thor, he didn’t acknowledge Bruce, he just went straight towards the fridge, grabbing Tony’s milk carton—with an exaggerated amount of sticky notes with the word ‘Tony’s’ plastered all over it, and started drinking straight from the box. Bruce just stared at him,
“I could write a novel with why I don’t need to buy you shit.” Clint said, “buy your own damn hotdog, and leave me alone.”
“Brother told you my sob story didn’t he?” Loki lashed, and the sudden change of mood almost made Bruce flinch. “Did he forgot to mention he’s the cause of it?”
“Oh, so you where joking, ha ha, very funny,” Tony said annoyed as he rolled his eyes, involuntarily getting way too close at Steve. His breath hitched,
Tony raised his hands as if surrendering. “Well I’m outta here.” He announced slowly backing away, Clint grabbed him by the left arm, and yanked him back in the room.
Clint frowned before glancing down on his phone. “I’m starting to think that anything about me is shit.”
Tony had been the first one to leave, stating that he still had a date with his creations. After that, everyone just started leaving one by one. Thor didn’t blame them, it was near one in the morning when Tony left and it was already two in the morning by the time Steve bid goodnight and trudged up to his room.
Thor blinked, and for moment, he smiled. “You have to admit, it was amusing,” he said, before looking down at his phone. His smile was instantly wiped from his face.
But the event was immediately cut short when they heard the telltale sounds of an upcoming car. Soon, Bruce was staring at a black SUV and a grumbling red head got out of it.
The idea of sharing a room with a person she doesn’t know, let alone trust, repulses her and was set on finding another place to stay. As soon as she discovered the lonely building near the campus, she decided to take a room without any second thoughts.
Everything felt so surreal Thor pinched himself.  Sure, they didn’t talk that much throughout the marathon, all the talking was mostly from him and Tony, but everyone was putting small remarks here and there. This was the very first big step that actually happened and Thor couldn’t stop smiling.
Making a beeline towards the fridge, he was suppose to grab a bottle of water but froze on his spot when he noticed a sticky note attached on the fridge.
Thor frowned, she did really great with Thor—then again Thor would befriend even a cactus if he had no other choice. So hearing that she’s not really good with people was a little surprising. “Really? I think you’re pretty great at it.”
He scribbled something on his clipboard before pausing, then looked at her with concerned eyes. “I noticed that these are all men,” he said and Natasha had to fight down the urge to roll her eyes.
Loki turned to Bruce, frowning, before breaking off with a huge grin and letting the most genuine laugh Bruce ever heard from him. But it doesn’t sit well with him “If you think I’m planning to end myself, you’re much more dimwitted than Barton.”
“You do know I can’t really hear you, I’m just complaining about the shaking you keep doing every night. This thing isn’t going to help me stop protesting. Also, holy shit! Why would you buy me this when I barely even know you?!” Clint was sure Tony barely got any of what he said.
The kid, who appeared to be named Loki (What is wrong with their parents?) yanked himself out of Bruce’s grasp, but was only able to send them both sprawling on the ground. It wasn’t a graceful fall to be exact, considering that both of his hands were occupied, with one keeping his nose intact.
“My brother, had problems with… with drugs, so he was brought here to be fixed.” Thor continued, his voice suddenly going low. “To get it out his system. I thought it was going well. He was staying in some building that was supposed to make him change and move on, not— Not make him worse—”
“I see, a start of something new,” his professor repeated with a nod, and Steve was pretty sure there was a smile somewhere.
Bruce was missing something, and he knew he shouldn’t even meddle, but something’s wrong and yet Thor would still try to smile, as if nothing was going on. And maybe nothing is going on and Bruce is just looking into it way to seriously. But for the past few days, he would always see Thor on his phone, or his laptop, waiting, and waiting, and waiting.
Natasha narrowed her eyes but answered nonetheless. “There’s Tony, Clint, Thor, Bruce, and Steve who I think needs therapy sessions more than I do.”
Steve shrugged and grabbed a few pencils off the shelf. He’s not sure if it’s a good brand, he hasn't done any research, but it’s the cheapest so far and his wallet isn’t having the time of its life after spending too much on food. “I don’t know, it’s been a while since I last used a pencil as a medium. I’m kinda looking forward to it.”
“I’m not asking you to reconcile with your brother, I don’t know what’s going on inside your head—could be anything, but we have a six foot blond mass of muscles panicking because of you. You got yourself a second chance, it’s your turn to give it to your brother. And on the way there, you might wanna need some help.”
Anyway, I was dead set on using the comics for Thor's life, but then i realized it would only work if I made Thor suffer amnesia, but we already had Captain America for that 'hospital related' backstory. And so I decided to watch Thor a few days ago and used that instead. I hope you liked it!
And no, it’s not because of Steve’s ridiculous clockwork habit, it’s because of Steve’s strange presence. Bruce couldn’t actually pinpoint it very well, but the way Steve stood, walk, talk—or just the way he held himself, something in him just screams, well, America. It’s like every time he’s in the room, Bruce found himself wanting to sing the national anthem or salute like a military soldier.
Clint dropped whatever it is he was holding on the counter and smiled smugly at Tony. “Got your stupid Back To The Future.”
“Wait,” Loki said when Thor started putting him in the car, “We’re actually going to listen to a person named after a condiment?”
The point is, if the college life in this story seem made up, that's because it is. I tried alright, I really tried asking and researching, but college here in my country runs really differently. For starters, Dorms aren't a big deal. Not one college here requires any first year students to take residency.
Nimble fingers slowly grabbed the flowers. “Any occasions why you’re giving this to me?” Jane asked.
“Like a rehab?” Natasha stated flatly, the monotony of her voice started to seem normal to everyone.
“No need to state the obvious,” he replied. “And here I thought I wouldn’t be found.” He paused. “Did my brother sent you?”
She had just gotten back from her session and was expecting to find herself locked in her room again, but instead, she was staring at the notes taped on the fridge.
“Yeah but—” He didn’t get to finish what he said as she’s gesturing at Steve that he was blocking the door.
When she came back hours later, she was holding an apple. Glancing around, she grabbed the note she previously made, her name visible on the pale paper, and stuck it on the red apple.
“I did not.” It must have been because he was too pissed off with the kid, but now he was suddenly noticing that the way he talks reminds him of Thor a little bit. Sounded fine, but if you listen carefully, you can notice the bit of formal talking.
“Hey,” She called at the pizza delivery boy, which he didn’t hear, hence for the heavy arm pat Thor gave him.
Thor waited, and it was the most excruciating thing he had ever done in his life. Jane had told him to be honest, and it seemed like a bad idea but he couldn’t really think of anything else. Did he mention that he was desperate?
Bruce remembered how it felt when he told the others about his parents, how it feels to have something off of his chest that kept on nagging at him for years. Sure it was weird, he didn’t know how to act around others, but honestly it made things a little better. “Comfort I guess?” He shrugged.
“He didn’t specify,” Natasha said. “But remember the time at the bathroom floor where he literally said that he was ignorant, where everything was already at its worst before he realized it?”
Tony went back to staring at the note Clint left on the fridge, when not a few moments after, Steve slowly walked out the bathroom, face redder than a tomato, glaring at Tony as if he somehow sung the national anthem wrong. Tony stared at Steve, now a little confused.
She didn’t know how long she stood there, but in the end, she ended up fisting her raised hand instead. Shoving both hands in her pockets, she exhaled and left. What was she going to leave anyway? For Clint to use earplugs? Bruce already did it anyway.
“Hey,” Thor said giving up. “I am aware that I had left a voicemail yesterday, nonetheless I really want to hear from you. I visited the other day—yesterday in fact—that is why I left a voicemail, but you won’t come out of your room. Did you even obtain my message?” His voice trailed a bit. “Anyway, I’m still trying to make friends, and remember Steve? The fair-haired one that’ was almost as vast as me? Apparently, he can rival mother’s cooking skills. I have eaten some of his food, well what Clint had left—you remember Clint? The other fair-haired man I mentioned, but tinier—and yet I have not managed to speak to him. But I am not losing hope, success is still visible in my vision.”
Clint blinked at the third note too much to even be considered as normal. He did a double check if the note wasn’t an illusion or something. So the nameless lady actually has a name, and she actually acknowledged them, maybe she is able to participate after all.
Thor, for the longest time, believed that he could take everything. But he never really thought his father could be that creative and kick him out of the country. And maybe, he should have expected this, but what he wasn’t expecting was his younger brother, Loki, to be sent here as well.
There are no current pairings because I'm still deciding what pairing I should choose, I would like the story to progress a little more before deciding.
Thor had this face that Natasha didn’t like, not one bit. She decided not to upset Thor in the future because she didn’t like the look on his face, at all.
. He was really looking forward to handing it over himself, but if the owner wants it this way, then who is he to change it?
“It’s not Back To The Future!” Tony retorted. “Before renting a film, check the disk if it’s the correct one.”
“I haven’t even started on my coffee yet,” Thor pouted, and by started, he meant that he hadn’t even picked a mug yet.
Clint actually found himself grinning at Thor’s obliviousness, only to frown when he realized that he was grinning.
Frowning, he took the smallest one, a yellow sticky note with a handwriting as if it was screaming. It read:
“Well,” Tony suddenly announced clapping his hands together. “I’ll be in my room.” He added finally standing up but Clint grabbed hold of his arm and yanked him back, again.
Steve shook his head and scrubbed at the painting from his palms until the paint was no longer visible.
It was probably three in the morning, he was sleeping on his bed when it actually started to vibrate. If there was one thing Clint hated about himself, it’s being a light sleeper, just like a bird.
Clint was quite for a minute, the boy taking that as the end of the conversation and giving back his full attention on the food in front of him. “Or maybe,” Clint said, voice a lot lower than what’s normal. “It’s a side affect.”
“Yours are at the end of the left wall, the others already moved in their stuff so you can’t reall—”
From the moment he first met Steve, he was pretty sure he knew what kind of guy he was. Morals and all. Definitely not expecting to face the guy that he was currently conversing with. Tony decided that he liked it, finally, something fun around here.
Bruce winced. “Been trying to forget that,” he said, which for some odd reason wasn’t a good idea to be said in front of Natasha.
It keeps reminding him that he’s all alone, and it also keeps reminding him that it’s his fault he can’t really run back to anyone. And he hated it, he moved and left everything behind to forget, but the memory just keeps coming back.
She hated their sessions, and yet she never missed a day. It was a reminder that her days in that kind of life was over, it grounded her. She didn’t like it, but that doesn’t mean she didn’t need it. She’s not that stupid to believe she didn’t need help.
After weeks of sitting alone, and ignoring each other in, and out, of the University, it took Tony by surprise that one of the other five was actually talking to him, much less asking to spend their free period with him. For starters, he wasn’t even aware if he and the other five shares a free period.
Every heads turned to Steve as he stood awkwardly with both his hands holding the strap of his messenger bag. The healing black eye made the whole picture kinda weird, and Bruce couldn’t help but wince internally knowing that he was the cause of it. He apologized to Steve the minute he got the chance, but something went wrong in the middle of the conversation because for some reasons, the conversation ended with Steve apologizing as well.
The ball was already on Steve’s court, and he found himself internally panicking, what was he suppose to say? That he was hospitalized? That seams reasonable, but before he could open his mouth, Bruce had taken the ball from him and spoke in a deep emotionless voice, and having his face covered in blood while his fist looked beyond murdered, the hair on his back stood up.
“You know what, just order some pizza,” Peggy finally said, throwing the bag of chips back at the shelf with its family. “Pizza’s great, especially Hawaiian, I dunno why people hates it.”
Clint blinked, before realizing what just happened. “Shit, no. I didn’t mean it that way,” Clint backtracked. “Oh and also, I don’t blame you with, you know” He gestured at the door. “This, and everything else, I swear.”
Next to him, Natasha raised one eyebrow towards Clint. And no, she wasn’t confused, there would probably be a nuclear war first before Natasha gets confused in a situation.
the closed door. Everyone jumped and held their breathes as the fist retracted, and after a few seconds, the door was kicked open, breaking the knob in the process, sending a deafening bang when it slammed on the wall.
Thor never liked coffee, they were bitter and he needed tons of milk and sugar before he could even bear the bitter taste. That was why the coffee he was giving Bruce resembles more like milk with a few drops of chocolate milk.
Taking one of his hearing aids off, he toyed with it and stared at the kid in front of him, who was devouring a cheeseburger but was still able to look like he was eating in fine dining. “Am  finally gonna get a name?” he asked.
Steve stared at Bruce, reassuring if what Tony said was true. “What he said,” he replied taking a sip of his tea.
Giving his painting a last glance, he left his room and made a beeline towards the bathroom—as expected the first floor was empty. He let out a groan when he spotted his reflection from the mirror and saw a big blob of red and blue on his face.
“I will when you give me a real explanation why you’re letting me live in this, this, this—god Pepper, I don’t even know what this is! Is it a dorm? A house? Jesus.” Tony peeked out the door and glanced the owner, only to see him playing on his phone.
The kid never respected him, always demanding things and that, he can’t even say thanks. And yet Clint would still feed him every other day, getting nothing in return. Just like back at the building. And he’s starting to wonder: when is he going to stop and realize that maybe this is enough. Maybe he already repaid Tony’s good deed.
Tony slammed his head on the wall, ignoring the startled yelp from the owner. “Tell me this is not one of your stupid ideas, please. This is a whole new level of betrayal.”
Steve was at the counter by that point, rummaging inside his bag. “Yeah, I mean I thought it was a good idea. I mean, the popcorn wasn’t that much so yeah, pizza,” he said without glancing up from his bag, as if he was purposely not trying to make eye contact. “Dang it, I can’t find my wallet.”
“Jesus fucking Christ!” Tony exclaimed, losing grip on one of the boxes he was holding sending it crashing with a loud thud on the ground, narrowly missing his left foot.
“A lady shouldn’t sit on the floor,” Natasha whispered as Bruce gave a jerky nod behind the book he was buried in. Natasha smirked before turning back to the two man-child fighting about the current TV situation. “Mind telling me the movie, considering that it’s been changed.”
He never really hid the fact that he was deaf, but he never really showed it. Out of all the people who should know about his disability, it should be Bruce—being that he’s the only one he ever met face to face. But either he kept quiet or that he didn’t notice.
Tony snorted as if Steve had just said the most ridiculous thing a person could ask. “Walking’s for the weak,” he said. “Also, it helps me reach my classes, God I miss the time when Pepper wasn’t breathing down on my neck,” he added.
Natasha raised an eyebrow from her place on the couch when Clint entered the building with a scream of victory. Tony, who was making himself some coffee by the kitchen, stared at him as if he’s got an alien parasite leeching on his back.
Steve frowned before studying his painting again. It’s his typical empty abstract painting that carries empty stories and plain brush strokes, it held nothing.
As soon as they entered the threshold, they immediately spotted Tony passed out on the sofa, the television still on.
Natasha stared at the contents for a good full minute before swinging the fridge shut. She ripped off the note from her apple and crumpled it into a ball before throwing it away to the nearest trash bin. Hiking her bag up her shoulder, Natasha bit on her apple and climbed up to her room.
Bruce entered the bathroom and froze, taking in the missing mirror on the wall, and the obviously broken door knob of the bathroom. Honestly, Bruce’s still waiting for the others to complain about losing their privacy while taking a dump or something.
Staring back at the stupid kettle, Tony wondered if he’s living with a bunch of hermits. Then again, he could stay locked up in his workshop without realizing he’s been in there for a month.
“Well,” She said, readjusting the stool she was sitting on and gestured at the painting. “It seemed frustrated as if it did something and it’s in,” She paused, thinking of the right word to say. “discomfort”
She swung open the fridge and immediately frowned. The first thing she saw was Tony’s milk, considering that the note taped on it was exaggeratingly big as if he was making a point—Clint should really get the memo. She didn’t know which was better, the fact that Tony moved on from using a lot of sticky notes for one milk, or the fact that he started using bigger notes than the actual object.
Bruce was ready to run and lock himself in his room, so what if the T.V. went missing, Steve’s the only one who uses it anyway.
She was fortunate enough to land a decent job a shady nineteen-year-old could ever get. And just to get her therapist off her back, she agreed to attend college.
Bruce stared at the building in front of them, before turning to Loki who was was avoiding to look at everyone, instead he too was staring at the building. It was a rehab center.
As soon as he was done, Clint washed his hands and made a beeline towards the fridge, might as well get on with the day. He could spend some time in the archery before his next class anyway.
A few moments ago, it was littered with students, and he thought why not as he dragged a chair and sat down next to them. At first, they were startled, which was fine. Everyone always had the same reaction around him. It’s always the same, so it didn’t really surprise him when they were suddenly thinning out, because it’s was how things would always turn out. Always.
He didn’t know how, his schedule hasn’t started being hectic yet, and yet every single one that he tried befriending ended up doing something urgent. But he wasn’t holding that on them, Loki was always busy as well. Only he was busy with something else Thor would rather not even remember.
As if on cue, warm  liquid started to seep through his fingers, down his mouth, to his chin, before dripping down towards the ground. Bruce pulled his hand away from his noise and saw blood clinging on his fingers. He sighed, not really bothered, just a little annoyed that his injuries weren’t exactly reducing.
Clint rubbed his temples before pulling out his phone. He was going to miss his next class but who cares, he was failing anyway. Putting his phone away, he stood up, startling the kid. “C’mon, the line’s short,” Clint said gesturing at the hotdog stand.
Tony opened his mouth to say something, but nothing came out, so he closed it instead. And for once in his life, Tony actually felt his face flushing. He cleared his throat, suddenly wishing he had burned all of his Captain America memorabilia that he, for some reason, never grew out off.
He found himself sitting on the floor, surrounded by schematics and broken prototypes. Butterfingers chirped at him from the table and he had to wipe more tears as he waded through the papers to find something he could fix. He was not as smart as Tony, and maybe did not understand some of the more Sci-Fi things the man created, but he knew enough engineering to fix a prototype, he was a rocket scientist for Christ sake.
When Steve let go and got up Tony's breath had already diminished, his eyes closed and body limp. Nothing remaining of the inventor but a husk of a body. He was dead, and the only thing reducing the pain that stabbed through Steve's heart was the knowledge that he, at the very least, managed to share one last experience with him, and perhaps made it all less painful for him.
With that he left the room, not allowing Steve to insert another word into the conversation. If he did, Steve would've enthusiastically explain to him that he did not cause Tony's death, he prevented it. He saved Tony after he was crushed, he helped keep him alive until rescue came. He would've reminded Bruce that he himself said that without Steve's intervention, Tony would've died back then, and none of them would've gotten to say goodbye.
"wouldn't have been as entertaining." Rhodey quipped, and the smile felt more natural then. "She… we all wanted to see you, Tony. it's one of those things friends exist for, you know. To give ridiculous giant teddy bears to each other."
JARVIS was silent for a long moment. "Understood, Colonel. I do not require further information. Your room is ready. May I suggest you enjoy a soak in Sir's private bathtub?"
We are not here to fight you." Her voice was soft, and if Steve had not known her skills he would have perhaps believed her words. Unfortunately for her, he was well experienced in that regard.
They stayed that way for a while, stroking each other's backs and heads as the tender hug continued, reminiscent of something they have left in their youth, but was never completely gone from their relationship. When they finally met eyes again, Rhodey's hands resting on Tony's shoulders, both sets of eyes were damp and threatening to shed tears. Tony was shaking and his eyes drooping as his breathing became heavier. His head leaned towards the warmth and safety of Rhodey's body, which had now climbed to the bed to sit beside him, and it was the one place he knew he would be protected.
He wanted to be able to believe Bruce, whose worry lines deepened further than what Tony thought possible - when Tony finally calmed down enough to piece together his memories of the past few nights, the blurred scenes his mind conjured when recalling the words Steve had said and the places his hands touched - explained to him quietly and slowly that while he really was assaulted – it couldn't really be Steve. Tony knew that – Steve was their teammate, a good person, Captain America…
Once Tony was wrapped in warm blankets in the small nest of pillows Steve had made for him, placed in a small and bleak room Tony had designated in his plans an 'even Safer room', Steve hooked in the breathing machine into another hidden wall socket and loaded it with a fresh and full oxygen tank – a precaution, most of all. He had no reason to believe that he would be gone for more than a few hours, at most, but if for some reason that was not the case… he knew he could count on Tony to make do until he came back to him, but Tony's body was traitorous, so such precautions had to be taken.
Clint seemed to be less confident in his grip on his bow. He looked at Steve, up and down, eyes focusing on his half-covered face, as if trying to find something he recognized there. Steve smiled gently in his direction and nodded once, encouragingly. If he could convince even one of them of the importance what he was doing, then that would be enough. They will convince the others for him.
When he looked at Tony now, he couldn't find regret for what happened. Sure, it would have been better if they did that in a bedroom, and if Stark was not a broken body on the verge of death, it would have been nice if he could participate and express his own love and appreciation of Steve as he did Tony's. The scenario could not have been much worse for their first time – had it not been their potential last time as well.
"Finally, I have some… worrying news." Bruce whispered. "Usually I would wait for Tony's consent to reveal those findings, but right now this could be the most vital damage to his person, and he will need our support to move past it." The man breathed in, then out. Steve must have imagined the slight green tint of his eyes and skin. "It seems that Tony was… assaulted, when he became indisposed. Sexually, violently." He breathed out again. "I am not going to repeat the details of that to you, was bad enough reading about it in the report myself without his consent for it, I feel very uncomfortable revealing it to you, but I also know he is going to need support, and Tony… he won't ask on his own."
"Decreased… motor-skills… fainting…" Tony resentfully recited, for the third time that day. "Short-term memory loss… B-brain damage…" Steve pinched him, he did so several times since he brought him there as some kind of warning or an un-violent punishment, the previous times Tony stopped immediately, this time he didn't care. "increased… heart rate. Heart attack." He breathed in, Steve's musky odor present and strong in the air he inhaled, it made him feel sick - Sicker. "Coma… brain death…" he all but sobbed the words when the slight pinch turned into the scorching pain of a slap against the bare skin of his thigh. "Actual… death…" he inhaled again as Steve changed their position, propping him down on his side on the bed while Steve hovered above. His heart pounded in his chest but he didn't dare to try and move, he couldn't, not with the tension his body was under. Any additional effort would surely result in one of the outcomes he'd just listed.
"You know it would've happened anyway." Steve finally said, again coming closer with intent to touch Tony, who at that point wanted nothing less than being touched by the man ever again and tried making that fact very evident in the expression of his face, "I would have had you even if you weren't dying, Tony, it wasn't done just out of pity. I know you are worried that it was… in a way, a parting gift for a dying man, but I would have done it either way. I really do love you. And you love me too."
Steve's hands were around his neck and were squeezing, crushing it with strength reserved for the nation's most iconic hero, Captain America. The man who was, at the moment, killing him.
Tony hissed in pain when Steve pressed a piece of the fabric that had once been his under-suit against the worst wound, applying pressure to it to weaken the bleeding. Maybe if he could save him this would not be necessary, they could go back to normal, rebuild the team, the city, start an actual relationship. Maybe it could work after all.
"It doesn't matter if you love me or not." Steve stopped dead on his feet "It doesn't matter, not anymore. You loved doing it with me, Tony. do you remember? You were just… there. And you were looking at me and pleading. I couldn't do anything else, I couldn't save you. And we both wanted it for so long, you know that." He once again came close to the bed, and Tony's heart was drumming in his chest as he tried making himself smaller, less noticeable with his legs folding and his arms crossed across his stomach.
His opinion changed. He started getting interested in the exploits of the Avengers, watching Stark – the most visible and active member of the group talk in the media about his and the Avengers' agenda and goals, and reading about Colonel James Rhodes and his service to the USAF as a gifted engineer, experienced pilot, liaison to SI and finally – as War Machine. He learned that Stark continued development of non-weaponized systems for the military, with the intention of protecting the soldiers themselves as well as the people they were meant to protect, he learned that the equipment he himself used during his service was personally developed by Tony Stark himself.
he got past Jarvis and the suits also remained unsolved. The A.I. seemed as conflicted as him by the data being missing – an entire half hour before the alarm started was just gone, consistent with the hospital's own security records.
So this? This fucked up situation? Jim knew Tony Stark, and he knew he will raise up and take it on and win. He knew that this anxiety attack and the pain – they would not break his friend. He would fight, and Jim-
It was rare, almost entirely impossible to catch Natasha genuinely beg, but right now that seemed like such an occurrence. Steve was baffled by her words, however – "I'm sorry, I wasn't aware someone left us." he said, frowning, "Oh, wait. You mean Rhodes? I hope it wasn't because of his little disagreement with me, Tony would hate for his best friend to quit being an Avenger because of him…"
of three days without a wash, and that Tony would probably want him to take a relaxing shower and eat a burger and get some sleep, also – someone needed to talk to Pepper, reassure the bots their creator was okay. Steve would take care of Tony, Natasha and Bruce were there. War Machine was not needed.
Tony stayed where he previously fell, his body frozen but his mind rushing to find a way out of the small room. The room was supposed to be impervious to sound, and yet he could hear each grunt and shout Natasha made or managed to get out of Steve. The fight was going on for more time than Tony could've imagined, and he hoped it was due to either of them holding their punches. Despite everything, he didn't want to be the reason for the team's downfall, he didn't want to be the one to tear them apart and pit friends against each other.
His father created the monster that plagued his dreams. Clearly his life was more fucked up than he could ever have imagined.
Steve had turned him into an addict, and Tony - who didn't want the pain and was too much of a coward to just let himself die, allowed him to do so.
And they wouldn't let him find out. Tony himself was rejecting him, not willing to hear what he had to say. Bruce had contaminated their consummation with words like 'Rape' and 'Sexual assault' without actually knowing what had happened, Natasha implied that he wouldn't have done it if he had a choice - which was false, because the choice was there and he took it and couldn't find regret at doing so – they all stayed blind to the act of love that transpired, insisting instead on victimizing Tony and himself by making up a tragic story for their own comfort.
"He doesn't remember you" he said as he passed by him, the corners of his mouth curled downside in a frown. "For his sake, I hope he never would have the misfortune of remembering."
It's not that he didn't like or worry about Tony – he'd went to a local Support center to get some material about PTSD and coping with sexual assault and then promptly discarded all of it because the feeling of overstepping some invisible boundary was overwhelming him from the moment he stepped into the tower. It was dumb, being a counselor was a part of him, an important part. Helping people who had gone through something awful, as he had, as all of the Avengers have – it was something that should have come easily to him.
Such a scenario, however, was not even close to being on her agenda. She stood there and stared at the wall, intensely considering it as if her glare could be enough to make the door slide open. If it was necessary, she knew her teammates would tear the entire place down by any means necessary, but she had a less violent solution in mind.
"No, you are here to arrest me." He snarled, causing her to recoil from him, her weapon right back in the air. "We are doing nothing wrong, Nat. just… strengthening the bond that was already there. Taking time, like you suggested." He sighed then, staring at the both of them. "we needed this to figure everything out, both of us."
Steve stood up, not looking back at the limp heap of flesh that bore a semblance to the Genius, Billionaire… Hero he loved, he tucked himself back into his uniform and wiped beads of sweat from his brow before picking up the shield that represented Captain America, made by the father of the corpse he was leaving behind, to be found by rescue teams or scavengers, whoever got there first... No—no. Tony deserved at the very least a proper burial, a hero's funeral. Steve could not let his sense of loss affect his ideals like that. He picked up the busted earpiece and put it in his ear, whatever was blocking the signal before was gone now, and he was able to transfer Barton a message with the coordinates of his and Tony's location.
Afterwards, he found Steve standing in the seating area, looking sternly at the window. The man didn't even turn to greet him when he came close but crossed his hands – somewhat defensive, Bruce thought – under his chest.
Tony locked his gaze with Steve's enraged glare as he shot him a third time, he listened to Steve scream and did not tear apart the eye contact even as General Ross and several of his goons burst through his doors to witness what was happening. When they tried getting closer to stop him, three iron man suits immediately stepped in front of them and blocked the way.
"I will shave you." Steve said decidedly with a smile before kissing him again, "I won't be as precise as you are, with all the clean-cut shapes and angles, I have no idea how you do it like that… But that's okay, I wanted to see how you would look without that goatee for ages, now."
"That's… it's to locate Steve, isn't it?" he sighed and pulled on his hair in frustration. "Jarvis, it won't do anything. Steve is out of the country."
Tony got up and moved away from the TV, instead he picked up a StarkPad and looked at the silent calculations Jarvis was making as they happened. He understood some of them, but as always, the rest caused him to develop a migraine as his mind tried to access old information that long since been corrupted or overwritten with new information –
He was so tired, back at the hospital. Waiting for Rhodey to return, to get in the bed beside him and brush his hair between his fingers like he used to do back in their college days, it wasn't safe to sleep, otherwise. Even when the suits guarded his door, his mind was vulnerable and feeble and easily succumbed to nightmares.
There was no tech. no computers, no phones, not even a microwave or a fridge. Everything seemed to have been made from blocks of solid wood, no metal, no cables, nothing to take apart and put back together. The windows were sealed with glass that did not even get scratched by having a chair thrown at it repeatedly, and the door did not open, had no visible key-hole, and made any attempt at kicking it down or slamming against it until it broke look more and more ridiculous each time it caused him to fall back on his ass, squirming in pain.
"Tony I swear to god-" Rhodey paused, he and Tony were about the same size, in fact, Tony was taller – and smug about it to no end – but at the moment Rhodey was towering over him, almost. "You have… If it's… if it's Stockholm syndrome, if you feel like… like that for him…"
Rhodey had a beef to settle with Captain America. He didn't like what Bruce had told him about Steve refusing to leave the room even when Tony made clear it was what he wanted, he didn't like the sort of possessiveness he recognized in those actions. He understood the need to be by Tony's side – he felt it every moment of the day, but more important were Tony's well-being and his wishes – if Tony had wanted him to go away, or If his presence created a harmful reaction Rhodey would have flown out of the country for his friend's sake, and not come back until he was cleared to.
And it was going to work out. Once Steve found Bucky, like he promised himself in that cell, he was going to make it work with Tony.
The words on the screen told him help was coming, and filled with calculations of the chances of him being rescued in the next few moments. Tony wondered what variables his AI was using, and considered making a snide remark about it being arbitrary and without cause – but he was just too tired to do that, and wanted nothing but to get under the layers of blankets and drown in their comfort again, forget that he'd ever heard what was going on out there and gotten his hopes up.
He put on and strapped the oxygen mask to its place on Tony's face, noticing how it seemed to fit almost too perfectly, as if shaped specifically to his face, disturbingly like a permanent fixture. As he wondered if one day they could be rid of the sight, the dim sound of an explosion far closer than there should have been one made him get up and leave the room, closing it behind him with a silent sigh and his back to the door. It was hidden just as the entrance to the safe-house was, the door resembling a normal wall more than anything, and powerfully sealed against explosions and advanced lock picks alike.
A gentle, warm touch was then on his head tilting it to the side as his body was pushed into the same direction as well, a light pat prompting him to let go of the liquid in his mouth onto the dirty floor, and throw up the rest just a moment later. He coughed and blinked the heavy darkness away from his eyes, taking in the foul smell of blood, sweat and fluids, all suddenly clearer. Above him, Steve knelt and he cradled Tony's head in his arms, murmuring his name and numerous curse words as well. Distantly, the notion of the Captain swearing seemed to have held some kind of a meaning, it was something Tony knew he should be amused by, perhaps mocking the young blond for his old man's ways. Only…
A shriek so high left Tony's mouth as he woke up in the bed that used to belong to his parents - he managed to scare the night nurse, who fled from the room immediately. Presumably to recruit a demon exterminator to exorcise him. He inhaled and exhaled rapidly, looking around him to assure himself that he was, in fact, safe. It was hard in that room, with the portraits of his parents looking down at him from the walls. Rhodey chose the room because it was large and had space to accommodate all the necessary medical equipment, at the time he didn't think about the nature of Tony's relationship with his parents, it wasn't relevant as long as he was in a life-threatening situation, but now… all he wanted was to be out of there. Not to feel his father's painted eyes, harsh and full of judgment even in paint stare at him.
A fluttering blue light bathed the ceiling and walls of the Milstein Hall of Ocean Life, mimicking the way sunlight dances on the ocean’s surface. One of the grand halls that comprised the American Museum of Natural History, Milstein Hall was known for its ninety-four-foot blue whale suspended in the air above the ballroom floor. On this particular evening, that floor was dotted with round dining tables for a dinner honoring donors and encouraging prospective investors. The whale model, despite its 21,000-pound weight, was arched delicately in the air as if diving deeper into the ocean. Its nose pointed towards the stairs leading to the second floor balcony while the rest of its body hung precariously over the dance floor. The watery lights, coupled with the shadowed mammal above, casted a dim, sleepy atmosphere over the room.
"Well I’m sure that if he set them all off, Obadiah must be on very thin nerves right now. He isn’t going to tolerate much more." Loki said thoughtfully, tapping the arms of the chair.
The town was a good size, and by the lack of shatter windows in the storefronts, the looting must have been at a minimum in the days following the outbreak. The rain was a steady drizzle now, and Steve had to shove his soaking blonde locks out of his eyes. “Where should we start? Looks like there’s a general store over there on the corner, and a supermarket just down the street. Maybe there will be a clothing store nearby-“
I know, I missed my Thursday update! But in my defense, I came down with strep throat on Wednesday and it really knocked me on my ass these past few days. I was going to just wait to post this next Thursday, but why wait when I have this chapter sitting and ready to go, right? So here it is!
Bucky rolled his eyes, leaning back into his pillows and reaching for the second half of the sandwich. “I don’t need to be babied, Steve. Tensions are high and we need all hands to keep up security. I may be injured but I can still shoot a fucking gun.”
Bruce frowned, looking over the program. “I think…I think it’s the computer program Tony’s been working on. But how did it launch itself?"
"That I was dead? Come on, you know it takes more than a grenade to bring me down," Bucky scoffed, grinning as he flexed his metallic arm. "Besides, Tony would have let me die without a fight," he smirked.
"Clint, shut that kid up before he gets away!" The short-haired blonde's voice hissed. "The last thing we need is for him to tell the cops!"
“Excuse me?” Toni was truly dumbfounded by the response and she took one step closer. “Are you fucking insane? I understand that you’re upset about Barnes, I do. And I’m sure you’re busy trying to find him, but you should meet with my father. He was going to check on your progress. For him, that could possibly mean offering his assistance, which I’m sure you need.”
Steve huffed and leaned down, brushing his lips against Tony's cheek before kissing him deeply again. "I'm going to hold you to that."
“In that miscellaneous aisle of art supplies and toys. It was either this, or we play Uno,” Bucky offered, taking a seat on the floor beside Steve and peeling off the cellophane seal.
Toni shook her head, huffing a disbelieving laugh as she met his cold glare. “None of this is concrete evidence, Rogers. You sound like you’re grasping at straws, here, and I know you want Bucky back, but do this right. Don’t go turning on the only people who have ever tried to help you.”
Tony huffed, cheeks warming just barely as Steve's proud gaze fell on him. "Good to have you back," Steve grinned, settling in his seat as the car fell into a comfortable silence.
That sparked annoyance in Steve. How was he supposed to honor Howard’s wishes if Toni was insistent on inviting possibly traitorous friends into his secure estate? “And how did you get past the front gates?”
“And you, you brilliant angel. Shooting Stone during our escape? Nailing that guard with a wine bottle? Amazing. Cheers to that,” Bucky teased, knocking the crust of his pizza against Toni’s.
my partner. What did you want me to do? Let you walk on out with our shit?” Bucky hissed, leaning forward and narrowing her eyes on the girl. “If it was up to me, we would’ve left you in that pharmacy on the floor.”
Bruce smirked, shaking his head and walking over, glancing over Tony’s shoulder to study the computer screen. “Are you…coding computer programs?”
When Bucky moved his arms under Toni in an effort to lift her up, he was surprised to find the girl already half awake- well, her eyes were half-lidded, but she made no protest as Bucky pulled her up against his chest.
Toni’s eyes immediately moved back to the window, one shaky hand bringing the cigarette to her lips. “Nothing. It’s nothing, I was restless and I figured I could come in here and do some work while I’m up.”
“Not only that,” Bucky countered, though he didn’t disagree. She was still a threat, until she proved she could be trusted. “I am also genuinely curious about where you came from. But if you want to be hostile and sit in silence for the next few weeks, we can do that too.”
“My father likes to keep his work life separate from his home life. And as for his business partners?” Toni continued, eyes flicking towards her father. “It’s a bit more complicated than just ‘dangerous men’.”
signal," Tony called from where he was standing in front of a computer Obadiah left for Tony to make calculations with.
“Gotta get your kicks somehow in a post-apocalyptic world,” Bucky shrugged easily, unfolding the board and passing the money to Steve to sort. “Come on, sit down. We can sort through all the supplies later. Let’s just…take a minute and enjoy ourselves.”
“Those aren’t bad qualities to have when you’re dealing with the…particular crowds that I’m sure you see,” Steve began, almost hesitant to direct the conversation topic towards business after how Toni had reacted to him earlier.
"I do." Clint huffed, looking through the row of cars until he spied the large, black SUV with Hammer’s tags.  “We aren’t waiting in his car if that’s what you’re thinking. Too risky. If he’s loyal enough, he’d run us off the road and take all three of us out." Clint huffed.
It took Clint all of ten seconds to punch Loki unconscious and now, they were throwing the limp and bound body in the back of the car. The car ride started in silence, all three men too deep in there thoughts to speak. It was Bucky who finally broke the silence, shifting in the back seat to lean forward. “Who do you think has Tony?"
Tony stood and followed after, humming as he passed through the doorway, moving around Steve into the hallway. “You two seem to really be hitting it off,” he commented lightly.
Bucky’s eyes flicked down, torn from his thoughts by Toni’s raspy voice. Some of the color had returned to her cheeks, and her blue eyes were no longer glazed over by pain. “I wanted you to get as much rest as possible. We have a big day ahead of us, sorting through supplies.”
Clint tensed at the gasp and drew his pistol with lightning speed, turning and aiming straight towards the source of the voice. Slowly, his eyes widened as he found his brother’s face framed by the sights on the pistol.
Steve steadied Tony, hands lingering his hips although no one seemed to notice. “Loki is the guy we call if we need to drug someone. Or kill them off. He’s good with poisons and stuff along those lines,” Steve explained, trying to keep vague for Tony’s sake.
"N-n-nothing!" Tony choked out, shaking as he looked up to meet Obadiah’s gaze with tear filled eyes.
Toni ignored the two, instead focusing her attention on their whereabouts. Looked like an apartment by the locks on the door and the layout. They were in what must be the main room, half a kitchen and half a living room. The place looked like it had been ransacked, most likely by its owners leaving in a hurry or looters. Everyone was a looter nowadays. There were two doorways to her left. One had an open door, and Toni could clearly see it was a bathroom. The other door lead to what must be the bedroom. One look over her shoulder revealed a window to her back, though it was pitch black outside. Great. Turning her glare back on her two captors, Toni huffed. “So what,” Bucky asked, raising a brow at the girl. “You’re just going to pretend we aren’t here?”
"Who did you fucking work for?" Clint snarled, stepping forward as Bucky grabbed his arm, pulling him back.
I'm alive! Thought I forgot about this story, huh? Never! I want to thank you all for being so, so patient over these past few months. I have no credible excuses but I'm going to give one anyways; I had the past seven chapters planned out in depth and I have a future chapter I want to get to, I just reached a block writing these transition chapters. But here it is!
Loki groaned softly, spitting blood on the floor before him as he glanced up to Steve. “The boss is going to make sure you all die," Loki snarled. “What a shame that it will be Tony who takes you all down."
Loki smirked and tucked the money away, nodding to the boss before exiting. “Why am I here?" Tony wasted no time in asking, slowly sipping the orange juice before him.
"I will not disappoint," Thor nodded, immediately pushing open the door to the main floor of the factory where workers were assembling hundreds of replicas of Tony's prototype.
Clint gave him a look as Bruce scoffed. “An hour at the gym with you will have him sore for the rest of the week. None of you go easy.” He mumbled bitterly, obviously speaking from past experiences.
This situation was growing more and more involved, and Toni started to fear she’d never get those contracts tonight, let alone a chance to ask about them.  Whatever drama Steve was dealing with didn’t mean he could give her that look a parent gives a child when they’re interrupting an adult conversation. Where was Barnes when you needed a middleman? “Steve, I just need the contracts you and Bucky were supposed to bring. We’re about to leave soon-“
They stepped into the dark house, making quick work to search the downstairs. The blonde looked over the living room, pausing at Tony’s computer and studying it for a second. His eyes moved to the flashdrive beside it, picking it up and studying it for a moment before sliding it into his pocket. “I’ll move up stairs and talk to the kid. Keep an eye out down here, Ramirez,” the blonde hissed, moving towards the stairs.
Bucky hung up the phone, tipping his head back against the window. His head was killing him and his chest felt like it was on fire, but other than that? Bucky was willing to admit it was a
“You want to, though. Some part of you doesn’t want to see him hurt,” Toni argued. “It’s why you feel guilty about what happened. You didn’t protect him to the full extent that you could, like you’re trying to do now?”
It wasn't until an hour before lunchtime that Tony finished the arm, stepping back and looking over it with tired pride. The metal coating was sleek and glinted in the light, while the gears and sensors hidden beneath were pure beauty to Tony. "Alright, Bucky, lets get you suited up," Tony murmured, taking the heavy arm and slowly moving over to Bucky.
Tony huffed, anger crossing his face. “I have nothing to do with him or whatever the fuck he does.” Tony hissed through gritted teeth.
Clint nodded warily, sighing and nudging them away. “Not sit your asses down so we can have breakfast,” he huffed, which Steve and Tony quickly complied.
Tony sighed, hands shaking as they dropped back to his side and he looked down to the mess of glass. Tony took a slow breath in, sliding off the gauntlet and looking down to his creation. He could do it. He and Bucky could fight their way out and escape. Or they could die. Tony sighed, shaking his head and moving to the lab door. Steve wouldn’t want him to risk his life on a last minute escape plan.
Bruce blinked, turning to give Clint a confused look. “Who is it?" Clint asked, leaning close to examine the screen.
He cupped Toni’s cheek, eyes flicking over for any sign of damage or pain. It was the most informal Howard Stark has ever been in front of business partners and Toni could see Steve shift uncomfortably in the corner of her eye. “I’m fine, I am. We got out of there just fine.”
"See, I knew you were bright," the boss grinned, patting Tony on the shoulder. “I think you and I will get along just fine."
Toni’s brow furrowed, and she slid the glasses off so that he could get a proper look at her disbelief. “You can’t be serious.”
Steve huffed, grip tightening on his glass of tea as he sat down at the table, facing Tony. “You and Bruce really seemed to hit it off,” Steve commented, forcing his voice to stay nonchalant.
Warm shafts of light streamed through the dirty blinds, thanks to the morning sun. Bucky took a moment to appreciate the way those beams splayed against Steve’s broad back as the blonde packed up their bags. They had spent the night on the tiled floor of the exam room, both of them quickly lulled to sleep by the rain outside. It wasn’t often that they indulged in going to sleep at the same time; in a world where anything could come for you in the night, the paranoid became the survivors. But the exam room door locked from the inside, and placing the doctor’s stool against the door assured the two that, if anything did manage to make their way inside, they’d definitely hear it.
She was right, he realized. Even if he went on patrol tonight, there was no chance he’d gain any ground in this war by himself in one night. If they were going to win, they would have to play this smart and playing smart requires time. “I guess you’re right. Just because I’m stuck here doesn’t mean I’m not able to help.”
“No,” Steve muttered, pinching the bridge of his nose before motioning to the stairs. “I plan on doing it. I promise. But she wasn’t exactly in the mood today for a heart to heart with me, of all people.”
Steve sighed and glanced to Phil, who was biting his lip as Bruce cleaned and bandaged the wound. “Let’s go back to the Estate. I don’t want any more of my men injured tonight." He huffed as Thor helped Phil up gently, careful not to jostle his arm.
"Don’t worry, I won’t let him touch you," Bucky said softly. “It’s my job to watch over you for Steve."
do anything to hurt him, after all." He turned around. "I'm off the team, Tony is off the team, and if I ever see Roger's pasty white ass anywhere near my brother again I will bazooka his head off. Tell him that the next time you see him."
, completely defeated. "So, is it time for the happy drugs yet?" Tony barely exhaled the words, shook visibly and winced as he offered his hand for Bruce to inject with painkillers. He looked like an old, abused animal, none of the grandeur and dazzle he used to practically ooze out of every pore in his body was present now.
Tony fought away the cracks in his composure, tried to keep the urge to fight for Rhodey's honor tucked in and controlled. He had to stay calm.
A surge of energy hit his body and it jerked violently, his eyes shooting open to find several faces looking down at him. None of them covered with the blue cowl of Captain America or looked at him with ice blue eyes full of the accusation and contempt he expected – but their hands were holding him down, and that was no less horrible at the moment.
Steve sent him a look, pointing. “Leave him alone, Buck,” Steve warned. “Go help Clint with his bags.”
When Steve finally spoke again, his low voice broke Toni from her quiet fuming. “You know, before you arrived, I received a call from one of my men. He had been tracking a lead on Bucky’s whereabouts.”
The blonde made an annoyed sound, blue eyes glaring down the woman as she moved to stand before him. “You’re really going to rob an innocent guy who did nothing to you? Who you don’t even know?”
Tony whirled around to glare at Steve, a dark fire burning in his eyes. “Are you seriously defending you relationship with her? In front of me?” Tony’s voice was quiet, yet it sent shivers down Steve’s spine.
Tony was straining against Steve's bruising grip, eyes glaring darkly at Clint. The older brother was trying to figure out who to speak to first, whether to explain to Steve or Tony. Before he could say anything, Steve was taking control of the situation. "Natasha, make sure you and the others finish this interrogation. You know how I like things run and what I want to know out of the weasel. Me, Clint and the kid have to have a little talk," his commanding tone leaving no room for argument.
Clint was fully aware of Obadiah's men as they circled the three, guns trained on their heads and waiting for Obadiah's orders. "I dont care. I know I sure as hell won't surrender to you," He hissed lowly as he stepped forward. "I'll gladly die for Tony, even if it's only an attempt to save him."
“Because,” a voice started from the doorway, and Steve’s gaze flicked up to meet that of his second in command, Bucky Barnes. “I had Sharon set up the meeting an hour ago.”
“I meant no offense. I’m sure you’re a… well-read man,” Ty excused, charming smile sliding into place as he brushed past Steve’s hand. “We were beginning to wonder if you were really going to show.”
Tony choked on his sandwich as Bucky was laid down onto a lab table; it wasn't hard to see the missing left arm.Tony felt absolutely sick to his stomach, rushing to Bucky's side and assessing the damage. His body was littered with cuts and bruises, a few stitches here and there, but Tony was sure the missing arm took the cake. "What....w-what did you do!" Tony hissed, looking back to Obadiah.
The front door opened as they approached it and there stood Bucky, sporting nothing but sweatpants as he rubbed his face. “I thought you promised no more work tonight,” the man complained, stepping out of the way as Steve and Tony entered, leaving the door open for Clint.
“Will you lose the attitude?” Ty shot back. Toni gave the man a hard look, before he groaned and tucked the device into his pocket. “Fine. I’m sorry, I didn’t mean that. Look, it’s gone.”
Steve rested his chin in hand, eyes trailing from the couple before him to the phone in his lap. He was going to kill Bucky for making him entertain these
Clint sighed, already starting a pot of coffee before moving over to the table. "This is my little brother, Tony. Up until now, he hasn't known anything about you or our operations. He just doesn't know how to keep his nose out of places it doesn't belong," Clint growled, sending a look to Tony.
“You’re looking worse,” he responded in turn, taking her in again. Her hair is neatly braided down her back and out of her face, and she’s wearing red, silk pajama pants with a white tank top. What gives the brunette away though is the faint hint of dark circles under her eyes, betraying just how worn she truly is. “Understandably so. I’m sorry about what happened. That it happened at all.”
“No, you listen,” Tony snapped, shrugging away from Steve’s hand. “Im not as fragile as you think everyone in the city is. I can handle myself and I dont need your sympathy or whatever the fuck you’re trying to offer here. Now get the fuck out!”
Steve's smile turned bittersweet as he stood and tucked his gun away. "Perfect. I had a feeling you'd agree. Now, if you two will excuse me, I have a meeting to get to. Clint, you can have the night off. Settle your family issues because I expect you to be on time tomorrow." He hummed, striding out of the room, the front door closing behind him.
Tony huffed softly as he programmed the software he was working on, a frustrated look crossing over his face. He loved the fact that he was finally building his own designs, but for the wrong person. If only he could get out a message to someone, get help for him and Bucky. He slammed down the circuit board in frustration, rubbing his face and sighing. “Tony, you have to relax," Bucky said softly as he walked over, holding out a pair of pliers Tony had asked for.
“Easy, we’ll find something,” Steve assured, smoothing a hand down Bucky’s back before shifting towards Toni and leaning down to meet her eyes. “Are you feeling alright?”
“I have, Mr. Rogers,” Toni agreed, her sharp eyes finally meeting Steve’s gaze confidently. “And I do regret it; this is a terrible bottle.”
“Yeah, sounds like him,” Clint replied almost immediately, not bothering to even question Steve’s problem. He knew better than anyone just how Tony gets, but that also meant he knew better how to handle him.
The first blonde gave him a look. “Lower your voice, Thor. We dont want to wake the whole block. Get the guy into the alley,” he huffed, moving into the shadows of the alleyway.
“I’ll stop by the mansion in a few days with the paperwork from the new investors. Goodnight,” Toni shifted forward to press a quick kiss to her father’s cheek. She took Ty’s hand and slid out from the car, pushing towards the front entrance as Happy covered them from the onslaught of rain. Ty let himself into the building, while Toni turned to offer Happy a pat on the shoulder. “Thank you for driving tonight.” She glanced briefly towards her father in the car. “Make sure he goes home and doesn’t work himself to death.”
“I said,” Bucky began, pushing himself up with a pained wince until he could rest his back against the headboard, “Stop lurking in the doorway like a weirdo.”
Toni left the kitchen, weaving her way around the dining room table, past the couch and down the hall towards the apartment’s spare bedroom. The room acted as an office for both Ty and Toni, though her fiancé tended to claim the space more often. Toni preferred to use her personal workspaces at Stark Industries if she was planning to knock out a lot of work. The brunette moved for the single desk against the far wall, taking up the chair and sifting through the desk drawers to find Ty’s new hiding space for her notebooks. Opening the center drawer, Toni was delighted to find a half empty pack of cigarettes and a lighter. And Ty swore he quit. She snorted quietly to herself, stealing a cigarette and leaning in to hold the tip over the orange flame of the lighter. Smoke curled up into the air lazily, and Toni stood to move to the window just to the right of the desk. She opened it just a crack, a weak attempt at preventing entrance to the rain. Toni perched herself on the edge of the desk, holding the cigarette close to the window to let the city air whisk off the smoke rather than keep it trapped in the apartment. The usual city skyline wasn’t very visible against the backdrop of storm clouds. Her blue eyes flicked away from the lackluster cityscape before her to scan the top of the desk, from the laptop at the far side to the planner beneath her thigh- Toni snatched up the weekly planner, gaze caught on what was scribbled down on the calendar for the previous night.
Tony sighed and relented, nodding slowly. Maybe he could deal with working with one of Obadiah’s mindless agents. He could use the help, although Tony was reluctant to finish these weapon prototypes. Knowing Obadiah, he had the worst possible use in mind for them. And the last thing Tony wanted to do was aid in the destruction of others.
Hello darlings! I'm sorry for the delay, midterms and work have really gotten the best of me this past month. I'm even more sorry for those of you waiting for an update on These Kingdoms We've Built, but I promise I'm working on it. That story requires so much more plot and planning than what I put into this one! Anyways, it's the spooky month, and there was no way I was not going to update my spooky story. So here!
"Well than good. We're on the same page," Obadiah hissed, raising his pistol and aiming for Clint's forehead.
“You can stay out here. Get dad moving and head for the car. It’ll just take me five minutes to track down Steve or Bucky and then we can get going,” Toni assured, already stepping back into the building.
. We’ll help her. I told her we’d head north. But I want more answers about what we’re walking into. I’ll see what I can get out of her when she wakes.”
, was guilty. He had been acting so strange lately that Toni wouldn’t put it past him to pull a stunt like this. The real question, however, was whether her father was in on this plan. Were Obadiah and Ty following orders from her father, or were they acting on their own? Had Steve been right? Was Bucky’s disappearance her father’s doing? Did her dad do this?
Steve took a long sip of his water, pointedly stalling his own reply. “You’ve given me this talk a thousand times, Buck. What makes you think I’ll finally take your advice?”
Clint was standing in Bruce’s path of sight, keeping his eyes off of Loki. “Thanks, Bruce, but I think Steve wants a little more time. We’ll be up in about fifteen minutes," Clint said.
Tony growled in frustration and stormed off, moving down the street to his house and moving up the steps to his front door. He paused, fumbling with his keys to unlock the door and glanced back, finding Steve gone. He huffed softly and turned away, unlocking the door and stepping in. “Fucking mob bosses,” he mumbled, slamming the door behind him.
“It’s funny,” Steve commented, turning his attention back to the papers as his fingers slowly and methodically uncurled from their fists. “For a woman who has rejected her family’s business, you sure do seem eager to stick your nose into contracts and other dealings.”
“Come on, Antonia, you aren’t going to kill me,” Ty laughed bitterly, moving until he was only feet from Toni. “You can’t even stomach killing, so what makes you think I’d actually believe you’d shoot me?”
Before he could even start counting, the mugger tossed the wallet back to Tony and raised his hands. “There, there. I gave it back.” The man swallowed, moving to slide around Steve. He didn’t make it far before Steve grabbed his collar and pulled him close. “Tell your boss if I find one more of his men in my territory, I’m cutting off all trades and coming for him.”
“You may see him when Pepper has contacted me to set up an appropriate time, Ms. Stark,” Sharon declared, already pushing away from her desk.
He yawned as he set the computer on the table, setting his flash drive beside it before shutting off all of the lights. He moved up the stairs to his room, rubbing his face as he shut the door and slumped tiredly into bed, sliding under the covers and immediately falling asleep.
Steve’s fingers tapped idly on his thigh as he watched the street lights pass over them, their black armored car maneuvering through the city’s dark night. “How much longer?” he asked, voice firm and battle-ready as he glanced to Rhodey.
“No,” Toni laughed. “No, that’s not what happened. The base was overrun during the evacuation, yeah, but dad made it to his plane in time. But I didn’t. Fucking tripped on the tarmac and missed the boarding before the plane took off.”
He nodded solemnly, inhaling slowly before he pushed himself forward with a pained grunt. Bucky had a tight grip on his chest over the wound, but that didn’t stop how his knees nearly gave under each step. Toni was at his side in an instant, hands smoothing over his back and chest to support him should he fall. Bucky led them to the corner table, nudging aside his jacket and taking up the pistol. Sliding it from the holster, he passed the gun to Toni before he fumbled with shoving his wallet into his pocket. “Do you know how to shoot that?”
Tony huffed and glared after Steve, crossing his arms. "What's his problem?" Tony asked, mostly rhetorical.
Clint wasted no time as he moved to Tony, pulling his brother into his arms and holding him close, carding his fingers soothingly through his hair while Steve moved to the window, glancing out and watching a car pull onto the street and speed away. “Whoever it was, they’re gone.”
“Wasn’t asking permission,” Toni huffed, stepping out of the sitting room and continuing down the hallway.
Toni straightened out, taking a breath before pushing off of the desk. “Think about what I said. Play this really careful, Rogers. I’d hate to see my father make you crash and burn just because you got jumpy before you were sure.”
There was a chorus of agreements as Clint pried open and air vent, climbing in with Bucky right behind him. Steve gave Thor a brief nod before moving forward, firing at the men crouching behind the bar while Thor grabbed Bruce’s arm and pulled him quickly over to Natasha and Phil. Steve followed after, sliding behind the tables and reloading his handgun. “What happened?" he asked Natasha.
Tony nodded slowly. “Thanks, Bucky," he said before shifting nervously. “Uh…how is Steve?" Tony asked, because in all honestly, he missed him.
Tony huffed, sending a short glare to Bucky. “Easy for you to say, everything that happens to the others is counting on my actions. If I make a mistake, the bombs explode. If I do everything perfectly, my weapons will kill them all."
Toni huffed, shaking her head and looking up to the ceiling to quell the tears brewing in her blue eyes. “You know what our relationship was like. I didn’t love him; we tolerated each other and that was enough, but it wasn’t like I was head over heels. And yet, I still let myself… I let myself fall for it. I was
The boss huffed thoughtfully, fingers tapping on the polished wood of the table. “Send in Donovan and Ramirez. They’ll be paying Mr. Stark a little visit.”
Toni rolled her eyes, before waved her good hand dismissively. Bucky could see the resignation on her face; she knew she had no other options than to rely on the two of them. “
“Wait.” Bucky hefted Toni up, placing her inside his own cart before reaching for his backpack on Steve’s shoulder. “Alright, go. Just wanted the food and water for her.”
Clint watched as Obadiah's body crumbled to the ground, stepping back in shock as his eyes slowly found his brother's, whose shaky hands were gripping a pistol from the back of the helicopter. Clint huffed out a laugh, moving forward and pulling Tony against his chest, hugging him tightly.
“No. I came here of my own free will to knock some sense into you. You screwed me over three years ago just to get to my father’s ear, and now you’re going to throw it away?” Toni approached the desk, crossing her arms. “My father has done a lot for you in the past, and he doesn’t take it lightly when people waste his time. But you’re lucky he likes you. So if you call him now and apologize, he’ll most likely overlook it just this once and take you back on. I know he will, as long as you don’t do it again.”
"Where is Tony?" he asked, his head bowed and his hands clenched to the point of digging holes in his own palms, Natasha could only guess Bruce had revealed what she heard discussed herself the day before to the rest of the team, and a small part of her was mad on Tony's behalf, even if she knew Bruce did it for what he deemed a good reason.
Clint was awake now, but he pretended to sleep yet. His shame radiated through the room with his uncharacteristic silence.
, he wanted to wake up – thought the pain should have made it happen already but it didn't and Tony still couldn't believe that anything he saw was real.
I also have most of the next chapter ready so you can expect it soon - sadly, as I started my pretty intense study regime this week, next chapters might get delayed. So I hope you can be patient.
"Of course not, the program you installed wasn't meant for it-" he unhooked the cable as the metal sphere started emitting an orange-gold glow and floating a few feet above their heads.
And then their first out-of-costume meeting happened, after they'd subdued Loki, and Steve was again proved right for his prejudgment of Stark. The words they exchanged were harsh, Steve tried to measure Tony up, confronted him with the knowledge he had of him from both his time as Howard's friend and from the file he had read on the man. He tried to find a shred of what his father had been in him – but the man was just too different, trying too hard to separate himself from the reputation and image of Howard Stark. That desperation was not charming.
He hated that Steve's hand was the one that fed him, and the one that brought him oxygen when breathing became a terrible strain on his body, he hated that he had to beg for it, and to be kissed and kiss back right before he could have the promised surge of air that gave that brief relief to his aching lungs and heart. He hated that he didn't mind, just as long as he could breath.
Bruce hesitated, Tony was obviously repressing the cause for his repeated panic attacks, his fear of sleep indicated nightmares, despite having been administered drugs that were supposed to shut those down completely. "I guess… Colonel Rhodes is back in the tower, I can call him and ask him to bring back a StarkPad."
So Bruce left him, and as he walked out Tony was suddenly completely silent, only the machines attached to him are still proving he is even alive with a loud beeping noise every few seconds. Bruce was no longer sure that is a good enough indication.
"He is in pain," Bruce whispered after a while, "I know you want-" Rhodey didn't move his eyes from Tony's, but he nodded slowly and watched as the drug took effect on the man he could call a brother and dragged him back to sleep. The hand not held by his friend was clutching the bed rail with such intensity it bent a little under his grip. Every single person occupying the room could tell that he was there to stay.
"Jim? Did you fall asleep in there?" Natasha's voice jerked him back into reality, and he turned to look at her. She was smiling wryly, her fingers softly tapping on the warm metal plating on his arm. She was good at hiding her concern, he almost couldn't spot it, if not for the Armor's sensors, he would not have noticed the tremble in her form.
He heard Steve pacing around the room, then leaving it for the sake of the next room before returning once more. His breath caught in his throat as he waited for him to settle, decide on the best way to discipline him and do it. He just wished it would be over already.
Moments after Clint left the room, Tony woke up. As before, the machines started beeping loudly before the man had shaken the influence of drugs completely away, broadcasting the sudden spike of his vitals to all who inhabited the room. Rhodey's head snapped back into complete awareness the moment it started, and was leaning over Tony before Bruce got a chance to come close enough and tell him otherwise. He had to be the first face Tony saw when he woke up, he handled this before – he knew how Tony would react to being in an unfamiliar environment, a hospital – no less. He'd been in this situation more times than he cared for, Afghanistan just the most recent.
He was supposed to be dead. He remembered not being able to breathe, being crushed by an enormous weight and calculating chances, scenarios… he was supposed to be dead, instead, he was… captured? Kidnapped? Is that what happened? Everything hurt, and the only time he could remember everything hurting so bad was Afghanistan, waking up during, and then after being operated on, waking up after being drowned and beat into the ground, waking up in the middle of the desert after crushing his first suit… and somehow this, at this moment, was worse. Something horrible happened – but he couldn't remember. Everything hurt so much. He needed help.
Tony looked at him, his big eyes full of misery. "I forget. Please, please…" he wasn't lying, his memory was fickle, his mind refused to process the things he heard, like the duration of it all. Two months just seemed too much time, and then not enough time at all. Bits and pieces of everything that happened, all the times Steve touched him, all the times he stopped breathing or tried to resist, all the times he gave up… there were so many of them, different and the same, melding into just one moment one time, and splitting up into more and more moments another time.
Tony murmured something about 'Christmas' and 'revenge'but otherwise kept quiet. The was obviously something off in the atmosphere. He knew from Bruce's frequent updates that Tony had refused to take pain medication, and had tried on several occasions to bribe a doctor into letting him go. He was jumpy, paranoid and refused to sleep, and it all had something to do with Steve Rogers.
Then again… the entitlement was part of Tony's nature, and Steve found that more than just endearing…. Exciting in the way it kept him on his toes and contradicted his own nature. It was a big part of the reason he knew Tony and he were meant for each other, the reason he loved him.
Steve crossed his arms over his chest, and tilted his head. Tried to look as non-threatening as possible as he took a step back from Tony, hoping to ease him enough to remove the knife from the vicinity of his throat. He knew that it would be safe to step in, then. But Tony was too smart to fall for that trap – he was aware that Steve could take the step forward before he could manipulate his damaged hands back into position, and he didn't lower the knife from where it began cutting into his neck.
The hospital systems were apparently out of commission due to a large scale power outage, and while medical equipment was powered by a separate generator to save lives of patients who were dependant on it, security equipment like cameras was shut down to conserve power. For Jarvis, there was no such convenient excuse. There were a few options that could explain it, but each seemed less plausible than its predecessor.
Steve paused. A frown was coming to his face as Tony's eyes filled with tears. "Let me go." He sobbed, blinking the tears away from his eyes. His hand trembled terribly but was so close to nick himself with the razor that Steve didn't want to risk trying to wrestle it away from him for fear that he might accidentally cause him actually to do it. "Let me go. I don't want this, Steve. Let me go, or I'll free myself this way. I- I hate you enough to do this. I
wrapped itself around his calf in its entirety: bony and long fingers wrapped around his flesh, and claws sank into his skin with enough force to injure. Tony was bare and vulnerable. Nothing to protect him, no metal suit to cocoon himself in. what was he thinking-
"Welcome, Colonel Rhodes." The familiar voice of the A.I. greeted him, and Rhodey smiled softly. "May I assume you will be spending the night with us, Colonel?"
happened back at the crash site." He said then, and Steve almost lost his footing as he finally recognized another emotion in the Colonel's eyes. Violent, unadulterated aggression. Instead, he stabilized himself, tried to keep his composure. It didn't matter, he did what he did out of love – Rhodes would understand that the rest of the Avengers would understand that he really had no other choice, there was
It was the third night when Rhodes came to see him, and they both sunk in the atmosphere of defeat that hung around the entire tower. Bruce was locked inside one of his special rooms, unable to de-hulk since the night before, Natasha and Clint were out, coordinating the search along with local authorities, to whom they have not told about Steve and instead sold them a story about a Captain America impersonator. That the real story would not have been believed was their reasoning as explained to a furious Rhodes who demanded Steve was held accountable for his actions.
"You are my Knight in an Advanced Threat Response Battle Suit, I'm going to turn War-Machine into a medieval armor next time you come to me for an upgrade." Tony squeezed on Rhodey's un-injured hand as he joked, though the both of them had averted their eyes from each other. "I… it terrifies me, but I don't think he was lying, Rhodey."
He had kept it up, for the last few years. Fought irredeemable maniacs and outright villains on the virtue of his words alone. The cracks always kept under a considerable amount of snarky comments and jabs. It had worked every time.
"Tony?" Rhodey looked at his friend, then around the room – trying to find the trigger to his sudden change of temper, the only thing that changed was Sam coming into the room.
. His thoughts struggling to turn clear for long enough to even grasp the significance of the places where Steve was stroking both his arms and his lips – his tongue – on his body, or interpret the appearance of Steve's face as hungry, or was it horny, actually? Perhaps both.
He injected Tony with a low dose of Valium and then increased the dose of the pain-killers to help his friend relax. Tony was sweating and his dilated pupils were blindly focused on the ceiling for several more seconds before his body slumped, the tension leaving it somewhat. Bruce didn't attempt making conversation, as much as he wanted to check for his friend's well-being, letting his patient rest until he was in a position to recognize where he was and what was actually happening was a higher priority. Bruce hoped the valium would be enough to let him sleep peacefully, with no bad dreams to plague him.
Tony gasped again, fear pooling in his chest and stomach. The smell of his own cum on Steve's hand made him feel nauseous. He could lie, Steve would accept a lie because he was so desperate for it to be the truth, he could lie…
Rhodey inhaled again and blinked, from where he was standing at the entrance he could not see the entire room, so just because it looked empty, didn't mean it really was. The armor was too big to fit through the door, so he didn't try to enter until he was released from it, somehow it seemed that rushing in into the room just to find it empty, or worse… it would be horrible, he couldn't do it like that, he had to be prepared.
"Yeah…" Rhodey paused and looked at him, then he got up. "If not for the serum, he would still be sporting a shiner the size of War Machine's fist."
“You are a treasure, Pep. But there’s really nothing for you to do here.” He finally said, “I promise.”
Poor Bruce is so tired he just keeps on missing all the signs. that being said, if this Steve could convince the entire US to trust him you can be sure he can manipulate puny Banner.
The doors remained glaringly open, waiting for them all to come inside and face the reality of what happened in a raw and direct manner that they had the privilege to willfully ignore until that very moment. He saw from the corner of his eyes the people who chose to go down that rabbit hole, both Wilson and Rhodes with nearly no hesitation going down to find each their lost best friend. He knew only one of them would come up with someone, and that they both remained lost regardless.
Tony had laughed with them, provided his own material to the team repartee regarding his and Steve's supposed relationship and teased the old-school Captain for his chaste nature as he made lewd comments, he played a game of Gay Chicken Steve had no intention of losing.
"I have alerted the police, based on their case priorities, traffic and their initial disbelief in my report, I predict it will take up to twenty minutes for them to get here." Another pause, "Sir, the panic room-"
Sam was frozen in place as well, his brow creasing in worry when he saw Tony's face change in terror, then rage.
No, that wasn't it. It wasn't just anger he felt when he heard the words Tony thoughtlessly spewed from his venomous mouth. The man played him, brought up Bucky and the brainwash knowing full well how he felt about it.
"I’m sure," Steve growled, grabbing Loki’s shoulder and shoving him into the chair Clint brought over. “But I think we need to have a little talk first," He hissed as Clint tightly tied Loki’s hands to the arms of the chair.
Two of Hammer’s broke with a satisfying snap that left Justin screaming again. “We have all day, Hammer," Steve grinned, giving him a look. “When. Is. The. Invasion?"
“Yes sir,” Bucky smiled, gladly accepting the kiss before taking a seat in the straw beside the girl. He pulled the bucket closer, watching Steve settle down on the blanket before fishing through his backpack. They didn’t really have any food to spare: one can of beans left. Christ, they needed a lucky break looting that town tomorrow. Actually, they just need a lucky break all together.
Steve smacked his hand on the table. “That’s enough, children. We’re stuck in here for the night, so let’s not spend the entire time miserable and at each other’s throats.” Steve gave Bucky a look, before leveling his gaze on Toni. “You said your name was Toni. My name is Steve and this is Bucky.”
Bruce propped a head up on his elbow, palm against his chin as he thought. Taking a slow bite from his sandwich, he cleared his throat. "Maybe they aren't after us. Maybe they only wanted Tony."
He’s trying to get a better read on the girl, figure out whether she’s more than just a ruthless thief trying to survive. He
“I received some training when I was in the service,” Bucky nodded. “I can’t promise it’ll be perfect, but it’ll at least heal. That’s the best you’ll get out here.”
"Tony, what did you do last night after we got home?" Clint asked nonchalantly, eyes on the eggs he was idly pushing around the pan. "You disappeared pretty quick."
Obadiah huffed, slowly pacing around Bucky and humming. "I guess he isn't of very much use to you now," he hummed, pulling out his pistol and pressing it to Bucky's temple. "I should probably just dispose of him."
“I shouldn’t care. I shouldn’t be so affected by what Ty did,” Toni whispered, voice raspy and threatening tears.
Tony only shook his head, struggling to push himself up despite the pull in his hurt shoulder. “Cant rest. Have to finish the weapon by tonight,” he whispered, shivering at the cool lab air hitting his wet skin. “Or else.”
Steve came into his office like a whirlwind, hair disheveled and blue eyes burning with anger. “I want him dead by morning,” he snarled, tugging his tie loose with one sharp pull.
“Antonia, darling, I’m glad I found you,” the blonde cooed, taking up her hand and pressing a kiss to the back of it. “I wouldn’t have been able to forgive myself if I had gone the night without wishing you a happy birthday personally.”
“Fuck off,” Tony snapped back and Clint sighed, shaking his head. “Let’s just go, Steve,” he mumbled, glancing to Tony in the rear view mirror.
Steve’s fist clenched as he turned to Bruce. “Pull up the security tapes from after we left." His voice was dark and commanding, one of the true signs that he was pissed and a little bit afraid.
It didn't really matter though. Steve's hands moved across the now bare body under him, not holding back his strength to manhandle Tony into a more approachable position – leaning against a piece of concrete with his head upright, cloudy eyes looking but not seeing Steve right before him, lips murmuring inaudible, incomprehensible things. Gashes across the flesh of his thighs leaked blood down his legs still at a slow, constant pace, turning his skin red and sticky. Steve stopped for a moment when his eyes spotted one of the deeper cuts. He knew what he was doing was not doing any good to any of those wounds, that he was making any chance of a recovery drop to the negative numbers by not performing any first aid routines. As it were, he was probably making the situation much worse.
he did it, why he was still doing it – what mattered were the lives of those he hurt. What mattered was Tony.
He did however leave his motorcycle standing with the keys in the ignition and the jacket neatly folded on top of it before going into the store, and talked to the pharmacist while the exhaust roared in the background as it was inevitably swiped away by some very unlucky person. He only hoped they would wear the helmet he left with it, and not get into too much trouble over the theft.
In his car, Natasha was already waiting in the back seat when he got in, frightening Happy who had just finished fending off the swarms of journalist who were not satisfied with the announcements he'd given already, looking for another scoop, another comment.
"Since Shield fell no one has Steve's DNA on file. The risk that it would be stolen and used to create more super-soldiers is always there, so no one documented it." Bruce said quietly, "The sample we collected… after… it didn't match Human DNA, but it didn't match the samples we collected from the invaders either."
Well, hadn't Tony just manipulated him into trusting him before snatching that knife and threatening to kill himself? What if this was another ruse? What if…
"It's all good, man. I trust you." Sam nodded at him, "Need a lift back to the tower? We can send someone to pick up your ride later…"
Awful as he knew the desire to act on his dreams actually was, Steve nonetheless worked his hands to remove dented plates of armor that constricted his access to what he wanted, throwing them aside and ignoring the way tony winced at the sound of metals ringing against one another. The man breathed in a shallow snuffle and his lips moved without making a sound, he didn't seem to comprehend the situation yet, Steve wasn't sure if he'd be able to anymore.
He still had to call Pepper, tell her and Happy what was going on. Get Tony's closest friends closer to him. There were so many things to do, to arrange. Tony was… Rhodey breathed in sharply and raised a hand to his temple. Tony was raped. And Rhodey, with all of his experience as a commanding officer in the military, his familiarity with sexual violence in that environment and the protocols of handling such within a military unit – had no idea what to do.
The realization that he might have really fallen in love and started a relationship with this man if none of this happened hit Tony hard enough that he flinched, closed his eyes as tears started to emerge from them and shook his head. "No, you… you sick… I will
“I-... ah.” Steve started, trying to push the right sentence out. “I don’t care much for flying either.” When he looked over, Tony was giving him this hard look of understanding. The kind shared between two people who’ve both seen things the other couldn’t begin to imagine. But share a common ground of faded memories that just don’t seem to fade.
Tony is an absolute zombie the entire time. He drags his bag the wrong way for a while and Steve chuckles has to correct it for him.
Steve’s face blurs for a moment as the tears overflow Tony’s eyes. His fond smile crumbles a bit, “mm’ s-selfish…” “You're not selfish, Steve.” “I made y-you cry…” Steve sounds so heartbroken at the thought he’d hurt Tony, “I w-wanted to see you again.”
Steve’s emotions just go absolute haywire, getting all simultaneously defensive and tender. Steve feels panic bubbling in the back of his throat because
Tony does chuckle lightly, “I’d still rather take ‘Fury’s wrath’ then that plane.” Steve gave him a strange look, noticing his flash of nervousness before he masked it adding, “What? I don’t like flying. You got a problem with that?”
The Captain comes on the speaker informing them about some national park they’ll be passing in a minute or too. The sudden speaking must tug Tony out of sleep slightly; he lets out a small breathy noise of contentment and makes a tiny grabby motion for Steve’s shirt. Which he gets a hold of and uses it to cuddle himself closer.
But laying in bed for two hours isn’t going to fix it. In fact it will only prove that he couldn’t go to sleep anyway. He’s midway through redesigning his gauntlet when a loud crash resonates behind him. His tool box is on the floor, bolts and nuts scattered all over the floor, knocked over by a hunched figure.
When they pull onto the runway Tony’s tapping patterns with his fingers as he stares out the window past Steve wishing more that anything that stupid sleep aid would kick in already.
“I’m from 2042.” Tony eyes widen, Steve chuckles weakly, “Just celebrated my 124th b-birthday too… or 58th… you always used too c-corrected me…”
He leaned back in the chair folding his arms, “How much trouble do you think we’d be in if we took my private jet instead?”
“...Steve…? What are you-... Oh my god-.... Steve, you’re bleeding.” Tony feels the panic rise into his throat looking at the dark patch staining Steve’s uniform. Tony bursts forwards as Steve sways, he catches Steve’s head before it cracks onto the floor when he crumples.
When they get in the car Tony gets a chance to pass out again. But after the second time bonking his head on the wall he wonders what was so damn comfortable about that airplane seat.
“From the future…” He chokes out, trying to suck in air to his battered body. Tony tries to comprehend that statement.
That’s not what Tony was expecting at all. Tony opens his mouth to ask but Steve already knew he’d do that. “Not important-... y-you just stay in the house o-on September 3rd, 2012 mmkay…? I think around n-noon, that’s what Narepha s-said.”
They hit an hour and a half into the flight when Tony feels his eyelids start to droop. He goes to fix the head flaps on his seat to support his head when he finds out there aren’t any.
on top of him when Steve scooches him over and wraps an arm around his waist. He hums nuzzling into Steve’s shoulder again, and it gives Steve this warm, fluffy feeling in his chest.
Steve snorts probably a little two loudly, “Here.” Steve pushes him up a little bit, and Tony squints looking around confused. His hair’s tousled and sticking up in places. He’s got a little crease on his cheek from Steve’s shirt, and he’s swaying around dazed with sleep.
“We need to get you to medical. JARVIS-” He stops at Steve’s hurried shaking on his head. “Apollo said there’d be a… paradox-... timeline-... thing if I s-stayed.” He sighs heavily, eyes closing briefly, “This is-… this is better.”
Tony huffed and jogged after him, turning the corner in time to see Clint standing in an alleyway with two darkened figures. He frowned and ducked behind a parked car, listening closely. Tony always had been nosy so it was Clint’s fault for not being more secretive about whatever he was trying to hide. Or at least that’s how Tony saw it.
Rhodey and Dugan gave firm nods, immediately grabbing two pistols each and tucking them away before each picked out a large rifle of choice. With the ammunition they needed both took off, scaling over the fence and moving through the dark lot towards the building. Steve moved to the driver’s seat and slid into the car. “Come on, Thor. You and I are going to use the front door.”
"Now, now, you're in no position to be making demands," Obadiah cooed as he shoved Tony beside the helicopter, ignoring the boy as he landed against Obadiah's valuables and weapons that were packed inside. "You are surrounded."
Bruce nodded, carefully cutting away the bandages and peeling them back to expose the angry, red stitches in the upper left corner of Bucky’s chest. Steve watched the exchange intently, stormy blue eyes following Bruce’s every move as the doctor began to clean the wound. They were exchanging words, probably about how Bucky was handling the pain and how he could go about checking the wound himself for infection. All Steve could focus on were those neat little stitches, sealing up the hole that someone had made in his best friend. This man, who had followed Steve into a den of lions at just a teen, who braved warehouse raids, shootouts, arrest, and more just to watch over his friend. Steve owed Bucky his life- or at the very least his sanity- and he hadn’t been able to protect him.
Toni shook her head. “You’re going to get yourself killed with that I-need-to-save-everyone mentality.”
Toni shrugged with an indifference that was too tense and practiced to be genuine. “I was fine. We were just bickering. But I can understand if you were hurt by the sentiments I expressed.”
Justin huffed softly, shaking his head. “Everything. A large stone wall surrounds the place; the only entrance is the main gate. He has a group of guards with trained attack dogs that patrol the perimeter hourly. Alarm systems and spot lights are set up at each corner. Guards are posted at every entrance to the main house, except for the delivery door at the far left side of the back of the house. Stark and Barnes are kept in the lab, where an agent is posted to watch them after that stunt Tony pulled with contacting you guys. The lab is at the end of the hall in the west wing of the house, where a security camera watches them.”
"Talk, Hammer. Steve wants answers so you’ll give them to him. There are plenty more bones of yours for me to break if you need an incentive." Clint snarled in Hammer’s ear, eyes narrowed.
Bruce eagerly took the offer, the two excusing themselves from what was increasingly become a conversation to be had in private. Steve waited for them to go before he stepped back, carefully rolling down the sleeves of his button down dress shirt and turning for the door himself. He wanted to remove himself from the situation, before Bucky could retaliate and before tensions reached their breaking point. He just wanted his friend to recover safely- and a selfish part of the blonde just wanted to keep his friend out of harm’s way. He had dragged him into this lifestyle, and he would not allow him to get hurt again because of Steve’s inability to protect him. Bucky could be mad all he wanted today, but it was for the best and Steve knew he would have to see that sooner or later. Until that time, perhaps Steve would be better off working and allowing Natasha or Sam to bring Bucky his meals. Just until the brunet relaxed. Despite this retreat, however, Bucky’s words still caught him at the door. “Is that an order,
Toni shook her head, turning her back to him as the front door opened to reveal Obadiah’s personal guard and driver. “Hello, Raza. Is he ready?”
They left her in the lounge, and Toni couldn’t tell whether that was a godsend or not. Rogers had disappeared up the stairs to the eastern wing with Barnes, promising to return once he’s gotten the brunet settled in a guestroom and their doctor arrived. She needed the time to collect herself anyhow.
Tony simply shrugged away Clint’s touch, his focus not breaking. Clint sighed, shaking his head. “I get off early tonight so I’ll be back by midnight, alright? I’ll lock the door behind me,” he huffed, moving off.
Toni’s grip tightened on his shoulders, and those blue eyes were back on him instantly. “I didn’t need an apology.”
"So take care of it," he growled through gritted teeth, eyes narrowed as he turned his head to get back to work.
There was a knock at the door of their exam room, a pause, followed by two more knocks in rapid succession.
"Great," Tony murmured, feeling compelled to give positive feedback for the sake of his friends. “I almost have the circuit system down and should have a prototype ready by the end of the week."
Tony huffed, placing a hand on Steve's cheek and giving him a look. "And what if that's not what I want? Im in the safest hands in the word," he murmured. "Dont you dare blame yourself for anything that has happened to me or Bucky." Tony murmured, resting his forehead against Steve's. "They wanted me for me, not because Im involved with you."
Toni met her own gaze in the window and raised her chin. No more. She’d smoke out the traitors and burn them herself if she had to.
"Natasha." Clint mumbled with a grin before looking Steve over. “Fix your hat again, you’re showing off too much of your face."
“I wish you had!” came Toni’s snarky reply, lips curled back in a sneer. “Then I wouldn’t have to look at your ugly face right now.”
Steve grinned. “You’re a life saver, you know. I was counting on this deal going through to expand territory.”
The blonde only huffed, peering down at Tony before leaning in and catching his lips with his own. Tony happily complied, cupping his cheeks and parting his lips as Steve eagerly took the invitation and slipped his tongue inside. Steve's hands gently framed his hips, slowly pushing Tony's back to the bed before taking the space between his legs. "There's no going back, you know. Once you join this family, there is no going back," Steve murmured softly against Tony's lips as he glanced down to the brunette.
“I apologize that you do not like the wine I bought for myself,” Steve hummed, keeping his tone careful as he released her hand. “I’m happy that Howard has set up this meet-and-greet between us; I have heard a lot about you, Tiberius.”
Another chapter! I started this story with absolutely no plans at all, but I just got so many ideas over the weekend that it just started coming together and I had to get things down on paper. I was originally only going to have Toni flashbacks, but I figured you guys would like to see into Steve and Bucky's past too here and there. Anyhow, here you go!
