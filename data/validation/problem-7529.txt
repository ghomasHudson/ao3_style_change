Despite everything that is coming down around them, his pack is happy and healthy, and Tony's strolling past him and --
"Sweetheart, breathe with me."
Natasha answers with a fake smile of her own, her fingers twitching against the table, "You know that was my assignment. It wasn't anything personal."
who just wouldn't listen to him no matter how many times he begged and plead for them to leave the weapons industry behind.
"I'm sorry, Captain; but I wouldn't wish for her to be alone in this state." Vision explains, and his gaze bounces between the rest of the Avengers, "I will give her some time to calm down and broach the subject again."
When they rejoin the rest of the group, neither Sam or Clint are looking at each other, and Scott is staring back and forth at them like he's wary. Steve's not entirely sure what's happened in the time he stepped away, but it doesn't look too comforting, all things considered, that one of his closest teammates and his best friend in the future looked entirely like they wanted to jump over the table separating them to knock each other out.
"Jesus Christ." Bucky breathes out, and aside from Sam's gasp, earlier, he's the first with a verbal response.
"You know," Tony begins, and there's not even the slightest twitch of his facial expression, "I'd figure you'd be happier to see the guy that got the Accords repealed."
Steve just stares in the direction he'd gone in with his heart shattered and laying on the floor, trampled. He deserves it, but it doesn't make it hurt any less.
"I didn't call?" Tony asks, and he's shaking in his chair from all the anger building up, "You were
In the end, that's what startles Tony out of his daydreams. He's gotten into the habit of wearing multiple layers so the glow of the arc reactor on his chest isn't seen by anyone; and he doesn't want the world to see it because from there, it's not hard to make the conclusion that Tony is, indeed, Iron Man.
Gentle, yet firm, Steve brings a hand to Tony's hair, giving it a little tug that forces Tony to look up at him. Steve's eyes are blown wide, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallows.
anyway. i hope you enjoy this one!
Then, Stephen smiles; and it's such a hollow smile that makes his gut churn because of how knowing it is. He flickers his wrist, and a portal opens behind the group.
"We don't choose between lives on this team." Steve says decisively, standing up and strolling over to meet Stephen where he's standing. He's filled with tension and anger and the feeling of helplessness.
Steve catches Natasha's eyes and they share a look. Tony would either love this guy or completely hate the way they were both so similar. And then he catches himself and shakes his head because Tony isn't the Tony he remembers being friends with. He can still hear the brunet's words echoing in his ear.
Shaking his head, Tony lowers his shirt again, "They captured me, held me hostage for three months, performed some torture -- you know, hostage things. They demanded I build a missle like the Jericho, so that they could have whatever political power they wanted. I couldn't do it; after seeing what those missles were doing to hurt the people they were meant to
"You are mine, Tony." Steve tells him against his lips, and his voice is so full of awe and wonder and love and -- his brain is seriously short circuiting.
"'Tasha, do something about this?" Steve asks, releasing the two in order to wave his hand in Clint's direction.
"That was before Extremis." Natasha answers with a shake of her head. Again, she's the only one who seems to really know anything about the newest strand of the serum that had initially created Captain America, "Extremis uses nanotechnology and computer coding that rewires the brain. As of right now, Tony is more like an android than a human."
"What does that even mean?" Scott asks, running a hand through his hair in an anxious movement that Steve finds himself mirroring, "What do we do about that? He wants us all dead and if he was willing to blow up his own compound there's no saying where he'll stop."
Iron Man. The Earth's last defense. Fighting since the day he had come home from Afghanistan despite criticism and without backup.
"Pepper found them. On Stane's desk." Rhodey supplies, and his lips are curled back in disgust.
He steps out of the apartment, ducking down into a dark alleyway and making sure there are no cameras before he puts the briefcase onto the ground and stepping on it. The suit unfolds around him, surrounding him with a familiar HUD screen and circuitry.
"In another reality, you didn't tell him the truth; and much like this reality, you would've fought in Berlin and the team would divided, but James Rhodes would have fractured his spine instead of dying outright. Stark would then use pieces of the Extremis formula to promote and encourage healing, and they would both move on from what happened.
James clicks his tongue against the roof of his mouth, shuddering as if the very idea of it makes him uncomfortable, "The only people that knew Tony was going to the demonstration, out of the entire world, were myself, Howard, and Obadiah. How would it be considered a random attacking and abduction if all the pieces were put into place in that specific way? Think about it; Howard was and is the face of Stark Industries, Tony designed all the weapons himself with no right to claim them, and Obadiah just needed the designs for the Jericho missile. It was
Is that right? Tony gets free food and he might get his unwanted suitor out of his life? How could he possibly let that opportunity pass? He looks at the space beside Steve, and at the seat across from Steve. They're both uninviting and there's another man sitting across from Steve and looking at him with scorn in his expression, but yeah, he'll take that seat.
His command is cut off when Tony shifts just slightly and rockets off into the air. It might have been just a second, but the entire suit covers his body as he propels himself forward and catches the falling machinery.
After following an angry Wanda out the last time they'd all been together, he'd trailed after her for hours while her anger built. He was waiting for a moment to broach the subject of helping Tony, like he'd told Steve he would do, but never had the chance. She ambushed him, manipulating the lingering feelings of affection Vision had for her against him. A fight ensued, Wanda tried to pry the stone out of his head, and he phased away, fleeing to regroup and gather himself.
Tony wants to say Steve doesn't need him, but in the realm of wolves, an alpha especially needed the comfort of his mate. Some alphas could choose their own mates, they were lucky like that -- but not Steve. Steve had the worst mate in all of existence, a man named Tony Stark who had run away from his fate..
Steve just looks at him, his expression bemused as he points one more at the chair, "Pants off."
Tony smiles, and it's a small, shaky smile that's entirely too forced. He glances down at the briefcase armor in his hand and realizes it's time he finally come clean to Steve. After all, he could've died while dealing with this threat, and Steve would've never known.
"I am the head sorcerer of the sanctum, and because of such, I am the protector of the spiritual world that is now being threatened by Tony Stark," he explains, sitting back in his chair and crossing his arms in a way that screams intimidation.
his head hits the pillow. His breaths are even, as shallow as they might be, and he looks relaxed for the first time in days. He quietly tucks the genius in, then takes a seat at the edge of the bed to watch just for a few minutes. His life had never actually been boring, but with Tony in the mix, it feels like he's living in an action movie.
And Tony stares at him, over the top of his hand still being held out. The others are silent as they watch, unsure of where this conversation is headed. Tony could either run away or attack them, and then they'd lose him for good.
Tony shoots at the shield, and Steve uses his shield to aim the trajectory of the shot. It ricochets like it always does when they perform this particular maneuver, and the reupolsor blast hits Wanda straight on.
"Iron Man, got any ideas?" Captain America asks; and really, does he have to ask? There's only one option they can work with right now, and it's the same option they had during the Chitauri invasion.
"I like art," Steve replies easily, and his eyes seem to light up just at the mention of it, "I haven't really had the time for it because of the pack, but I've got to say that's where my passion lies."
Tony grabs her by the neck and throws her out the shattered window. She won't die, because she's Natasha; but seeing the cruelty Tony's showing a former teammate unsettles Steve in a way he's never expected.
"As long as we don't need to haul your ass to an urgent care center in the middle of the night, I'll look the other way." Sam supplies with a grin, but it's only now that Tony notices the strain on it.
"Stevie," Bucky warns, and though his voice is quiet enough that only Steve should be able to hear it, Tony's eyes flicker over to Bucky again in amusement.
the older man begins, and Tony wishes to be surprised when in regards to Howard's alcoholism,
It's as he's thinking it that the phone buzzes, and he switches applications to get to the message inbox.
And then, one night, Tony's dislodged from his dreams about waking up in Afghanistan to a stranger's hand in his chest cavity to the sound of a scream. At first, he thinks it's him screaming, tossing a hand over his mouth to try and subdue the tremors of his body. But when the screams don't fade, he forces himself upright. The scream is coming from the living room, he realizes, and he crouches on his way out of the room.
"Yes." Tony answers, and there are so many thoughts in his head but that's all he can make himself say. Steve takes the silver bands out of the box. He slides one onto Tony's finger, and Tony returns the favor.
"He joined us for the movie night," Wanda supplies, and her eyes are twinkling ever so slightly like it's a fond memory.
Tony's eyes fall to Steve's hands, curled into tight fists where they sit on the blond's lap.
He knows it's a bad idea to look at Tony while he confesses it, and yet his body betrays him anyway and turns to look at him. Tony's looking right at him, this time. His gaze is heavy, searching for lies where there are none. But Steve can't say that, because Tony's got no reason to trust him after their past.
He's cut off by the first 'I,' that comes from none other than Clint. He wants to glare, but his attention is torn away from Clint when not a second later, everyone else in the room follows his cue. Steve, the cheeky bastard, also votes in approval, but his eyes are glinting in mischief like he's planning on Tony's compliance.
Stephen cuts him off like he never even expected the man to talk, "To every reality that we know, there are a million realities that can take in place of it. For example, in another reality, you would have told Stark about why you wanted to save Sargeant Barnes, he would have agreed to help, and with James Rhodes would have willingly helped free his mind without anyone being the wiser.
Although, if Steve had just wanted a roommate, he could've just asked Bucky. Bucky, who seems to come over every day and spend hours with Steve when Tony was at work. Even when Tony came in at night, the other brunet would still be there, laughing at the Yankees with Steve and offering him a beer like the whole situation was normal.
As much as he knows he'd love 'the Hobbit' if he were able to pay attention to it, Tony can't get himself comfortable enough to watch the actual movie. His thoughts are racing in his head; but whenever he feels like his breath is starting to hitch and that he's going to fall victim to a panic attack, Steve shifts just a little, proving to be just what he needs to ground himself each time. It's not the best distraction, of course, but Steve's hand gently rubbing his shoulder, coupled with the rest of the pack's inability to remain silent during the movie, it makes it just a little easier for him to sit through it.
Tony relents, but his smile is still wide and full of mirth as he reclaims his stool. Steve's at his side, but standing with a hand on his back. It's good to know that even the composed alpha gets a little jealous sometimes. Rhodey's eyes focus on the display, his gaze thoughtful until he pieces it together in his head. Then, because he's another little shit, he glides closer to Steve and sticks his hand out with a smile so charming that Tony nearly falls for the act.
"Yeah. Pepper wasn't answering the phone and after the last alien invasion, I was worried about her." It's a lie and while he's good at lying, he's not comfortable with lying to someone as earnest as Steve is, "Fell over something in my way there but I'm alright."
Steve growls again. It's louder now; more forceful and a little possessive. He wonders what's swimming in Steve's head, and wonders how he can manage to erase every thought from Steve's head aside from him.
, Tony. We can't just sit back and wait if there's a threat that can take our whole world apart."
He's cut off when Steve surges forward again and kisses him once more. It's probably the most effective way to shut Tony up, and Tony relaxes slowly against Steve's lips.
Well, probably not in the exact same boat.
"That was my mom, Maria Carbonell." Tony tells her, and he's only too aware that the rest of the room has gone silent. He should've kept his mouth shut and he knew it, but the damage had been done. He knows he's told Steve about her being dead, and he knows Natasha is aware of it, but did the rest have any actual idea of what his story was?
"You don't eat like you should." Is Steve's response, by way of explanation. Tony's ears burn, both with embarrassment at being treated like a child, and with appreciation towards someone who seems more than willing to take care of him. Steve gestures over to the workbench, releasing Tony's hand so he can walk over and place the food down, "Come and eat. I'll leave you to your work when the plate's clear."
"Maybe that'll teach you not to taunt me." Steve tells him, and he's grinning wide like he's won some argument.
, he thinks.
that Tony just stops moving.
Steve growls again as he hears the plea, and in the next moment, he has two fingers in Tony's mouth. Tony knows what he's supposed to do, of course, and his eyes never break away from Steve's as he coats the two digits in saliva. He has lube somewhere for the main event, of course, but at least to aid in the prep, this will do. Steve watches him, hungry like he's never seen the blond, and his fingers are replaced with Steve's lips pressing against his.
Steve pulls back enough so they're looking at each other, and he's licking at his swollen lips. While his eyes are still blown wide with desire, he looks cautious and unsure of what Tony's proposing. He's searching Tony's face, looking for a sign of hesitation or confusion, but finds nothing there.
Stunned, Steve just stares at Tony. He should've known ahead of time that if Tony was sure of Bucky's innocence, he wouldn't do a thing to harm the man.
Steve doesn't answer for a long time, focused on his task of ensuring Tony's leg doesn't need stitches after all. When he finishes, he leans forward and brushes a kiss right onto the surface of the bandage covering his leg, and Tony's body flushes with heat.
"I won't be gone too long. Don't wait up for me." Steve says against his forehead, and he presses another kiss onto Tony's face before backing away and following Bucky out the door.
sort of privacy. That ought to count for something, right? The conversation from the kitchen is subdued from out here, and they're all straining to hear of whether or not they'll be gaining a new packmate.
It's a colonial style house, big and white and almost perfect for a horror-movie type setting with lines of ivy crawling up the sides of the building. He wants to laugh at the site of it, really, but it's really his own fault the house looks abandoned. He probably wasn't making his mom proud by visiting only when he wanted to escape Howard's prying eyes.
Let Obadiah take his best shot.
"So did you." Tony scoffs, and he elbows past Steve to go and finally take care of his leg.
And Tony knows they're still so far from perfect. He knows he pushes buttons. He knows he's a coward. He knows Steve has a temper problem that reminds him of Howard. He knows they have to
"I know what you can give me to get me off your trail." Steve says, his eyes slowly dragging from Tony's eyes to his lips and then back. There's something dangerous swirling around in his eyes, then, but Tony finds himself curious despite it, "A kiss."
Confusion hits him hard. Is Steve angry because he doesn't want to go to the funeral? Is he angry because Tony can't bring himself to mourn over a father who was barely present in his life?
Tony's hands, having flown forward when his body was tugged back upright, plant right onto Steve's chest, and though he refuses to look up into those disarming blue eyes, he can just
True to what he'd stated in the hallway earlier, Steve walks into the garage around 2 PM, looking for Tony to give him a neatly made sandwich and a glass of juice since the man has too much coffee. Tony doesn't know this at first, of course, because he's tucked underneath his car with ACDC playing on the speakers loud enough to drown his thoughts out. It's the one thing he misses most about his old life; working with his hands to create and upgrade technology. If it hadn't been for Howard and Obadiah and their obsession with business and money, Tony would be happy to be just a simple mechanic.
He forces himself to sit still, telling himself not to be angry or annoyed at Tony's lack of self preservation. There was no way of knowing how Tony would react if Steve shows his frustration; and the last thing he wants is for Tony to look at him with fear in his eyes,
"You did?" Steve asks now, the disbelief bleeding into his tone as he remembers the entire argument that had led to their fight in the first place, "Why'd you do that?"
, and you couldn't pick the Malibu house?" Rhodey quips, as sarcastic and dry as he ever was, and Tony is up and out of his seat in a matter of seconds.
"You don't like popcorn?" Steve asks, and Tony's baffled by the blond's obliviousness, "I'm sure we've got M&Ms here if you'd pre-"
Steve's answer is instantaneous,
"Does that mean your mad sciencing was successful?" Bruce asks; and though he's annoyed, there's the slightest bit of fond amusement that slips into his tone.
“The witch is right.” the sorcerer begins with just the slightest raise of his shoulder, “Even without Tony Stark, you would be able to save the Earth.”
They start fighting, though it's a big mess because there are two enemies and even if Tony isn't fighting them he can jump in at any time. Foes that underestimated Tony Stark in the past would know.
”Our freedom was worth less to Stark than his company.” Clint retorts easily, and he shakes his head in disagreement, “I had a family, kids to take care of, and yet he stood back and got us arrested.”
"Uh, J?" Tony asks, but he has a sinking feeling he knows exactly what's about to happen.
Steve lights up instantly, and a moment later, he has his arms full of Tony, dipping the slighter backwards to give him a searing kiss on the lips. He murmurs his thanks against Tony's lips, his arms squeezing Tony like he's not ever planning to let go, and for once, Tony's grateful towards fate.
"Then why did you come out here?" The star-spangled-pain-in-the-ass shoots back.
"Hold on. He has something else to say and I want to hear it." Tony replies, and he shrugs his shoulder in order to knock Bucky's hand off of it. He continues staring -no, glaring- at Steve in challenge. Up until now, they've had a decent, easy kind of relationship. Of course adding Howard into the mix wpould change everything.
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Natasha and Steve take a little step back away from her line of sight. Right, they've both met her in the past. He's a little envious, though; because if anyone needs protection from the petite blonde striding over to them in her stilettos, it's him. Happy and Rhodey are behind her, of course; but Tony can't bring himself to tear his eyes away from her. Beautiful, efficient, and ddeadly Pepper Potts.
, but he's also so desperate to feel him already. By the time the fourth finger is in there, he's already sore from the stretching and tempted to just fuck himself to completion on Steve's hand.
Yeah, their surprise is expected, considering Tony's spent years on his own and they don't know who the newcomer is; but it doesn't stop the downright glee that errupts from his chest when Rhodey walks in through the back door, heading straight for the kitchen. Still in his uniform and wearing a grimace that shows just how tired he is, Rhodey's eyes sweep the room just once before they land on Tony.
"I know I didn't make it easy on you yesterday, Tony, but it wasn't out of jealousy -- not the kind of jealousy that you're thinking about, anyway." Bucky says from behind him, and Tony's slow to return to his stool so they can resume their conversation, "I guess part of me was just so angry because Steve was chasing after you and so earnest and you just didn't want anything to have to do with him."
When Tony looks up, Steve's never looked away, and his eyes are gleaming like he's looking at the most beautiful thing in the world.
Tony hears himself snickering as he pictures it, knowing it would be an effective use of those youthful looks. He wasn't expecting for Steve to be such a little shit about it, though.
"He'll get over it." Tony replies, and they both snicker. Of course Steve won't get over it.
"I said put her down." Steve commands once more, and he holds a hand up to keep everyone still where they are as Bucky replaces Wanda and removes his hand from her neck.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What do we do?" Wanda asks, gently replacing her little cup of tea and shifting her gaze from Steve to Tony.
"Go get your shield, Steve." Tony tells him, and his voice is weak but if his faceplate were up, Steve would see the flicker of amusement dancing in his gaze, "You look pathetic fighting without it."
"But anyway, back to the story." Tony watches as Sam draws in a deep breath to brace himself, and without even thinking about it, Tony stands and strolls over. He's not too good at comforting people, but his hand presses down onto Sam's shoulder with just enough pressure to be a grounding presence. Sam flashes a smile up at him, and the gratefulness twinkles in his eyes, "At first we just met with everyone else, but there's this magnetism that comes from them that just drew me in. All of a sudden, we were jogging together, going out for drinks, talking about our childhoods. It helped all of us, I think. Just being able to talk and hang out like guys -- took the edge off. At some point, you came up. None of us had mates before, it was crazy to imagine that one of our mates would be
So, instead, Tony just sends Steve another message,
But he missed Steve's gaze enough to know he didn't mind one way or another. And then he parts his lips and takes the entirety of Tony's dick into his mouth in one fell swoop, and Tony nearly cums from the sight of that alone. Steve's got no gag reflex, which is probably something he needs to thank the serum for, and goes at it like he's starved for it.
Wow, he never knew he had a praise kink.
Steve reaches his hand out, and Tony's unable to hide the way his body flinches as he readies for some sort of beating. Steve falters for a nano-second; but he covers it with a wide smile and places a hand in Tony's hair. This is different from earlier acts of affection; and yet, it fills him with warmth anyway.
"You say that, Tony, but it's always going to hurt when I wake up and you're not beside me." He sighs out, and he presses a soft kiss to the center of Tony's forehead, stepping back slowly to put some distance between them, and while his lips are curled into a soft smile, the joy doesn't reach his eyes, "I'll bring you lunch later if you don't come out of the garage by then."
He takes his time, his tongue flickering along the shaft as he takes Steve further into his mouth in slow, teasing strokes. Steve shudders in response, and one of his hands lands in Tony's hair, fingers tangled into the curled locks as he grunts. Tony looks up at him through his wet eyelashes, loving the sight of Steve biting hard onto his lower lip. Their gazes meet, and Tony allows Steve to set their pace, his hand guiding Tony along as he moves to take more of Steve into his mouth.
"I told you I don't want to hurt you anymore, Steve," Tony replies, just as quiet, and his eyes are searching Steve's expression. Knowing more now than he did the day before, after speaking with Bucky, he can just see how much of his heart Steve was wearing on his sleeve.
"I'm sure you've got a lot to discuss as a pack now, so I'll head to the garage and get started." He turns on his heel, nodding once just to himself before he goes, when Bucky's voice calls out.
Okay. Well, he wasn't expecting for Steve to have company when he's planning to unveil his deepest secret; but for now, at least, just seeing Steve will have to do.
"So what of it? Why have this conversation at all?" Wanda retorts, and her fingertips are twitching as red wisps of power escape them, "He's an enemy, so we take him down. Correct?"
It's silent for a minute, and then Captain America is crouched down beside his suit, looking entirely like he's ready to yank the armor off all together.
"Are you ready for me?" Steve asks against his neck, licking a stripe across his Adam's apple that shoots another thrill of pleasure down his span.
He cums with a jumble of words Tony can't understand in his post-orgasmic haze, leaning forward and biting at Tony's shoulder hard enough to leave a mark. His fingers are bruising at Tony's hips, but Tony's proud to know he can zap away Steve's self control.
Tony softens considerably, wondering if having a mate meant they could read each other's mind. He tries to quiet for a moment and reach out with his mind, but honestly, he's never going to be able to stop thinking long enough to figure out what Steve is thinking.
two years
”I don’t understand!” Wanda shouts, and she’s the only one who seems thoroughly uninterested in helping Tony at all.
"I'll be okay on the couch, Tony." Steve murmurs, but his body is still shuddering involuntarily and Tony can't really wrap his head around why Steve's so reluctant to sleep with him.
He watches the pack more than he watches the movie. Natasha and Wanda are sitting on the two opposing sides of one of the long couches, their feet stretched out between them and a bowl of popcorn resting on the blanket covering their legs. Thor is on the floor in front of them with Bruce, and while Bruce is mostly stretched out himself, Thor is sitting upright with his legs crossed and his hands planted firmly on his knees like he's at an old timey war meeting. Sam, Clint and Bucky share the other long couch, and Clint's the one who provides most of the unnecessary commentary as the movie progresses.
also -- i'm playing 'spot the typo' and cackling at my own negligence. sorry for the inability to type properly.
"Jericho was a missle unlike any others. It would explode, like an ordinary bomb; but what made it
Steve sees right through it, like always, but doesn't comment on it.
"How did you know I was going to come in here?" Tony asks warily, leaning back in his seat with his arms crossed over his chest as best he could.
Which is true. Hammer is just as slimy as Howard is, but in different ways.
And with that, and his heart in his throat, he turns and heads to Steve's apartment.
"Everyone's hard on me. I'm used to being held to a different standard than anyone else." Tony answers without hesitation, and Steve's heart clenches.
He doesn't know if knowing that is supposed to make him feel better or worse, but it definitely makes him feel worse. He and Sam have this thing in common, which is something; but is that really something worth celebrating?
"Where was I?" He asks after another moment, having been able to stave off what was going to be another panic attack.
Tony blinks, forcing the smile to widen; but he's sure Steve doesn't buy it. The blond doesn't say anything about it, though, just continues watching Tony like he's trying to solve a puzzle.
just following my instincts instead of my brain for once, but I wanted
"I don't want to fight you again, Tony," The blond holds both hands up in a motion of surrender, "You and I, we've - we've always done our best fighting together. I know there's a lot of bitterness between us but I don't want to fight another battle against you.
James Rhodes, fondly called Rhodey by Tony, had lost his life in their battle in Berlin: tragically, unnecessarily. Tony only found out after a long stay in a local emergency room, where he was forced to deal with the aftermath of his fight with Steve and Bucky. He never recovered and went deep into hiding off-grid.
And that time, he could hear it -- well, most of it. It cut out here and there, but he could get the gist of it even without the complete connection of the words. Steve counts as he breathes in, holds his breath, and releases; and Tony forces himself to follow along. It's hard going at first, but after so many labored breath cycles, he's managed to calm himself down a little. Beyond Steve, Rhodey is watching them with a fond gaze on his face. Tony makes a note to ask about it later, but doesn't dwell on it too much.
He's ripped off of Steve suddenly. Well, more like tugged off, and in another moment, they're flipped back over and Steve manages to have Tony's jeans and boxers thrown off before Tony himself realized what was happening. Steve lowers himself, and their naked, throbbing erections are grinding now in a much more painful, intimate way.
Tony says, as a way of breaking the ice. It's not a very good way, granted, but what else is he supposed to say about it?
"Tony-" Wanda begins, but Tony suddenly can't hear a thing. It feels like his head's been submerged under water and he can't hear a thing at all.
Clint's a little outmanned here. No one could ever doubt his prowess as an archer, but she's as good long range as he is and he mostly provides cover for Natasha. Natasha is a deadly spy, for all intents and purposes, and doesn't intentionally hold back but - she's always had a bit of a soft spot for the other female on the team.
All of a sudden, he can't breathe. It's like he just managed to forget how, because his brain is too busy thinking about
"Language." Tony scolds, but there's no conviction to it. It's quiet, something that he just has to say because he doesn't know what else
"And it's only in this timeline, with resentment for you all, that he willingly hands over the world he's protected since the moment he donned that armor."
The shock around the room is brief. There's some disbelief in the air, too; and Tony pretends not to feel the weight of everyone's stares as they turn to look at him. Steve, especially, seems to have several emotions flyinh across his face at once.
"Go eat, sweetheart," Steve murmurs; and his voice is low enough for no one else to have heard it, "I'm not mad. Just try to eat a full meal before you disappear to your garage."
with him. He knows Tony goes out whenever Steve does, because Tony just had to make sure his tower and his company are fine (at least, that's what Tony says every time).
"Viz?" Sam calls out, the horror seeping into his own tone, and he's visibly shaken as he stands to help guide Vision into a chair.
And then, they're curled up in bed again, Steve's arms holding him closely, protectively as they both start to drift off to sleep.
and fight everything together. I don't know how many times I have to say this. I had no interest in betraying anyone. I just wanted to keep us together."
, that wanted what I symbolize more than you wanted me." Tony gripes, and he tilts his head back down. If they thought he had forgiven and forgotten, they were sorely mistaken. His gaze is full of hatred as it darts from person to person and then settled on Steve, "And you. Oh. There's so much I can say about you-"
Which it was.
What's surprising, though, is that Tony retracts the gauntlet that was on his hand and is actually going hand to hand with both of them. The kitchen is a mess and half of the building is trashed so they're fighting in between small spaces and Iron Man was always a long range fighter. If they weren't enemies in Tony's mind, Steve would be impressed by his improved skills.
Without meaning to, his very existence had gotten the way of the happiness Steve had with someone else. He wasn't entirely sure of it, of course, but really, what
"Please let go of me." Tony says through his pressed lips, and he's surprised by his own composure.
"Okay, no. I need a shot of this, too." Rhodey's gleeful voice trails off, and the sound of the camera's shutter is all that's heard as Steve leads him from the kitchen to his old room.
Tony drags a hand down his face and stands up from his chair, holding his hand out in front of him, "I was told to respect my elders. After you, then."
Just like that, all of his jealousy fades away. Now, Tony just feels bad for the pair of them.
Steve presses a finger to his lips and pushes against Tony's mouth. Confused, Tony just sits back and raises an eyebrow in question, "It's too public here. Go to the bathroom. I'll meet you there."
“Even so!” Wanda shouts, raising a shaky finger in Natasha’s direction like she can’t understand why the spy would defend Tony, “We were sent to prison! It’s only because Steve came back for us that we even have our freedom!”
If not between Tony and himself, af least with the team.
“More tea, Captain Rogers?” Stephen asks, more out of obligation than an actual interest in the leader of the Avengers.
"Steve Rogers, sir." Steve replies, and some of the tension that comes with jealousy eases off him. Tony bites back his own grin.
Bucky leaves just before midnight, and Tony's in bed already with the Starkpad in his hands. He could've joined them, but baseball was their thing and he's got upgrades to design for his latest battle armor.
Check-in goes off without a hitch. He pays triple for the room because he's paying in cash and wants them to keep it off the records. They look at him funny and have eyebrows raised, but hopefully, they won't get cops involved. It really would suck if he ended up with his mugshot plastered all over the place.
"I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know."
Still, he can't say he minds, or that he would prefer any other kind of life. Well, the second part is a lie; he'd much rather not have his entire pack threatened just so the genius would make more weapons that the brunet himself wanted to part in.
His anger grows substantially; and then, all of a sudden, his face drains of all color and he hunches forward in his seat. He props both of his elbows up on the table, ducking his face into his hands and breathing deeply. He might be crying, too, considering the shake of his shoulders.
Sure, Steve didn't know about all of that before; but he had an inkling. Tony still refered to the pack as Steve's, even though they've all been trying to include him more. Tony's afraid of being vulnerable, and spends more time lost in his thoughts than engaging in conversation; but does it make Steve a bad guy for wanting to make Tony part of
And then Steve bends down, pressing his lips against the glass of the arc reactor. Tony can't feel it, of course; but the very image of it has Tony feeling all sorts of vulnerable. The last time someone went near his chest, they'd tried to kill him. And now here was his husband, kissing his chest and wordlessly promising to keep it safe.
It's been throbbing since their kiss, too, but Tony wanted tonight to be about Steve and
"Don't finish that sentence." The genius is heaving now, holding a hand in the air with his palm flat like just knowing Steve's breathing in his direction will bring on the onslaught of a panic attack.
Now it's Steve's turn to blink, and then an eyebrow raises in skepticism as he leans back on the bench, "Is this you kicking me out?"
Unless he wasn't trying to tell him about running Stark Industries. Unless; Howard, in his own tactless, less-than-considerate way wasn't trying to congradulate him but
Sam is the first to react, and he bodily slams into Wanda to distract her. It works, but the suit is still farther than would be a safe distance away.
"Tony, you alright?" Bruce asks, and his voice is twinged with worry.
"Who did you think was Iron Man?" Tony can't help but ask, and he silently calls for the armor to disassemble. It's in one piece, but still has a few dents that need to be worked out for him to wear it comfortably.
Steve joins him shortly after the front door swings shut, and he looks a little nervous as he creeps into the room. Tony stares at him with an eyebrow raised, questions dancing in his mind at the way Steve's acting like a high schooler about to ask his crush out on a date to the dance.
Late? For wh- oh, right. He just notices that all three of them are dressed for the wake. He just blinks and shrugs a shoulder as he takes a step back.
"Think of it this way." He tells the group; and he's forcing a smile onto his face even though it feels empty, "At least you can tell him you brought me back home at his funeral."
Steve, fully anticipatory as he stares back and forth from Wanda to Tony, doesn't bother to answer. It's obvious, anyway. Tony's inappropriate sense of humor was something he'd already gotten used to.
While most of Captain America's face is covered by a cowl, Tony doesn't miss the way his royal jackass rolls his eyes at the
Somewhere further along Steve's left side, Bucky snorts his amusement, "Is he always like this?"
, but is frozen where he stands.
She manages to rip off the cloth that had been dampening her powers, her fingertips covered in wisps of red power. She lifts the table and throws it in Tony's direction. He blasts it apart with just a flicker of his wrist. The table breaks apart, slamming into Scott and Clint. They both roll away, mostly uninjured.
Tony doesn't even glance in her direction. His face is set blank, the best poker face that Steve has ever seen in his long life. He's just staring, his gaze roaming over the tense expressions and then finally settling on Bucky. He doesn't settle there for long, either, and brings his gaze to Steve's. They've always been challenging each other since the day they met, but Tony has never looked at him with so much hatred.
"You work for the government?" Tony repeats, and he puts the mug down with a little more force than necessary. His blood feels like it's boiling as he raises a finger in Steve's direction, "Is that why you came up to me last night?"
to build one overseas and you managed to build one in a day?"
He's not entirely sure why she's telling him that like it has anything to do with him, but manages to shrug it off as he leaves the kitchen. He already knows Steve is behind him, because Steve's eyes always find their way back to him even when the room is full of other people, but the blond remains silent until they're far from prying eyes.
"It's okay if you don't want to come with us," Steve begins, though he's not as confident with his words as he'd like to be, "but I don't want you here on your own. There's a safe space, if you're willing to come with us to it."
Tony leans in, slow enough for Steve to see it coming, but the alpha just waits with those intense, patient eyes. He's said it repeatedly, that he wouldn't rush Tony or pressure him, and he'd let Tony decide; and Tony decides that for once, he won't run away. At least not tonight, not after Steve has cried
He takes the nearest seat that he can find, turning his attention to a holographic workstation he can use for his designs. While the rest of them might have felt like they had to pay their respects to a dead man, Tony just wanted to get these designs for Obadiah done so he can get the guy off his trail for long enough to take his company back.
Which doesn't happen. Tony's eyes fly open; and all the anger that they had managed to drain out of him is back with a vengeance. He raises a hand to his chest and pulls the entire metal shard out of his chest. He doesn't even grimace, though that might have to do with how he'd had his entire chest operated on while he was awake and in Afghanistan.
easy."
"I can't. You know that." But even as he says it, his body starts crumbling down. He's surprised with his body's exhaustion, seeing as he's been known to go days without sleep when it came to his projects; and that was before he had something that he felt so strongly to protect.
Bucky manages a chuckle and stalks off towards his own bedroom, "I think that's something you need to ask him."
Steve slides his hand beneath the hem of Tony's shirt, and he's filled with satisfaction at the way Tony's breath hitches. The genius always has words and sarcastic comments; so any time Steve can knock him speechless, he's understandably proud of himself. And when Steve pulls back from the kiss in order to drop his head and nip at the mark he left on Tony's neck, Tony writhes in pleasure and he sounds so beautiful crying out in pleasure that Steve instantly finds himself wanting more.
"I'm gonna head over there." Tony says, his voice quiet and unsure, "I'll come back and do all the paperwork your pretty little heart thrusts at me; but I need to see him."
"You okay?" Sam asks Tony, and Steve furrows his eyebrows as he turns to the Iron Man suit.
"I was bored after college?" Bruce returns, a little sheepish now.
"J?" He asks into the air as he stands from the couch to find a clear space to stand in.
And Tony decides he likes it when Steve is rough with him, hitting him deeply and making his toes curl in pleasure. He's sure he's conveying it with how loudly he moans, and Steve learns quickly. He doesn't last much longer, and when he cums and finishes riding his orgasm out, his body falls limp and Steve keeps going until his own thrusts become erratic and rough.
There are a few murmurs of agreement, which is expected, but it's Steve that has the final say, "That won't be necessary. We've already intruded for the night."
do I know what I’m doing? does anyone know what I’m doing?
"Huh?" Tony asks, dumbfounded, but Steve just manages to wrap an arm around his waist and hoists him up so that they're walking together but most of his weight is leaning on the blond. Steve has the little cup in his free hand, and it almost looks like a doll's tea set with how big the man's hand is. He's so focused on that thought that he doesn't even have the ability to comprehend what he and Steve are doing.
Tony asks, exasperated as he draws his fingers through his own hair,
But he pauses at the threshold and turns his head to look at Steve. There's a calculating look in his eyes as he mulls over what he wants to say, "You knew it wouldn't be easy when Tony packed up and left New York, but you followed him anyway. Why?"
Pepper tells him, and if he were still laying down, Tony would have bolted upright, "
But as his mom used to tell him, he'd just have to make lemonade out of lemons.
"It's not a problem." Tony answers, putting his clothes back onto the top of the dresser, unable to meet those beautiful blue puppy dog eyes, "It's just..."
"What can they do to us?" Wanda asks, her tone fearful.
"If it wasn't for me, you probably would be." Tony hears himself say, followed by a self-deprecative peel of laughter.
Tony rolls his hips into Steve's touch, not bothering to hide the groan building in his chest, "I'll tell you after you fuck me."
"Every few days, or maybe once a week -- I don't know." Tony admits, then quickly shakes his head, "We should meet up. Get to know each other. That kind of stuff. I usually hate the fate crap and I don't like feeling like all of this is just the universe's way of telling me who I am but you're a good guy, Rogers. If you've spent years being content with watching me from a distance, I should at least meet you halfway."
Tony, fearful and ashamed of his past - a man who spent most of his life on the run, now feeling like he has to choose between family and duty.
"Stand down." Tony says, and he feels Steve's confusion rather than sees it. Tony raises his voice, knowing the two that had just left the room wouldn't be too far to hear him, "Come back. He's a friendly."
"Trust me. I won't be able to keep anything I eat right now down." Tony answers without looking, and he's still wheezing hard.
That's meant to end their interaction for the night, Tony decides on his own. Really, he had no moral obligation to fulfill by opening his house to them, but he felt guilty enough about them following from a distance. They gave up their normal, cozy pack-life to follow him as he ran from his responsibilities. He hadn't asked them to do any of that, but they're the ones who wanted to be near him. For once, he figured, it'd be nicer to have them in the same four walls than following from a distance.
"Sorry, Mr. Stark. We just assumed it was okay to use whatever was in the house." The man has a hand out towards him, polite and gentle in a way Tony really wasn't expecting, "I'm Bruce. Bruce Banner."
"I wasn't aware we had enough in the house for dinner." Is all he responds with, and he makes sure that his smile is wide.
"Everyone sit, please." Is all Tony responds with, and his voice is a little harder than it probably should be. Everyone seems to freeze, and he's not sure what's racing through their minds, but he lowers himself onto the edge of the tv stand in an attempt to appease them, "We need to have a little heart to heart, as much as it pains me."
"Well we can't let you face her alone again after what happened the last time." Steve disagrees, waving a hand in the general direction of Vision's forehead.
But when he's looking around the room, having finally calmed down enough for Steve to release him, everyone's looking at him in concern. Was it really possible that the group of people he had just met recently felt more like a family to him than his only living family member ever did?
Steve stares at him quietly for a moment, then crosses the space between them and cups Tony's face in his hands. Tony feels his breath catch, and he can't turn away when those blue eyes focus on him. Steve bends forward just slightly, brushing a kiss onto his forehead.
Tony's pretty sure he's the one that won, considering just
Steve knows her history with Stark and yet can’t find anything in his heart that can understand her loathsome comments towards Stark. Even he, after everything had been said and done between himself and Tony, wanted nothing more than to help.
"Maybe that's all you need to do now." Bucky suggests with a shrug of his shoulders, and he's gone.
But as quickly as James's mood had lifted, it falls again; and he looks sobered to the point of despair as his head tilts back down and his eyes focus onto Steve, "The man's been through a lot, Steve; a lot you don't know about, and a lot even I don't know about. When I met him, he was the smartest kid in the world that I knew of; and had more money than I could ever think to imagine, but the kid
"So," Tony picks up when they finish their sandwiches, and both of their hands are just stretched out on the table in the space between them. It would be so easy to just reach out and tangle his fingers with Steve's, but the thought of it makes him feel nervous, "You've been in my private space twice now. I think I have the right to ask; what do you like to do, besides following geniuses across the country and shaming full grown adults into doing your bidding by just
me to know you can't even rely on
wrong?"
"If it means he can finally be free again, I'll get him to testify." Steve cuts in, and he'll have to apologize for being inconsiderate later. Right now, the most important thing is to put Obadiah away; if only so that Tony can feel like he can go home.
"All of you put your lives at risk following me around without knowing what it would cost." Tony replies, calm despite the tremor of his hands, and his eyes are focused on Steve, "I can figure out a way to fight them after I get this done, but if doing this means no harm comes to you, it's a no brainer."
His gaze flickers, between Natasha's gaze that is shows just the slightest concern, to Wanda's questioning eyebrows, to Bucky's intense gaze that is burning with questions, and then finally settles on Steve. Steve, who looks like he's fighting the urge to get up and run to him, with his fingers curled tightly into the leather of the recliner. Tony notices it, just then, the sketchbook that is sprawled across his lap. His head turns, finding the little closet behind the television, and a smile forms on his face despite himself. At least one good thing came out of all this, he tells himself.
What he really wants us to cum, but there's so much he's feeling and he just wants to feel more of it.
No one was able to see her coming, unfortunately; and seeing that she has such strong telepathic abilities, she's able to use that dagger-shaped metal to pierce Tony's chest. If her aim had been slightly off, she'd have caught Steve in the crossfire.
Asleep, Steve looks far younger than he is, his eyebrows resting like there's nary a bad thought drifting through his mind. Tony can't help the little hum of content that passes his lips. Having a mate was never something he imagined he would have, and yet, it felt so
Just before he can leave the room fully, Steve reaches for his elbow, tugging him back and wrapping his arms securely around Tony's shoulders, "Don't stay up too late. I'll come looking for you in a few hours if I don't see you in bed."
The engine clicks off, the headlights following, as Tony looks up through his windshield at the hotel he's pulled up to. Normally, he would just stretch out in the back seat and nap for a few hours on the side of a road off the path of the scenic route, but for once he just craves the warmth and comfort of an
"Just don't ask me to leave. Please." Steve's almost begging, and he's an alpha, -they normally have too much pride to do this- this can't be easy on him.
Tony stares up at him, his lower lip quivering. He doesn't like the anger that's filling Steve's face. It reminds him too much of Howard, he decides.
Right on cue, it dawns on both Steve and Bucky's expressions, and they dust themselves off like Scott's swarm of ants were crawling on them.
Steve seems to take this as a hint and brings the coffee carafe over, topping off Tony's mug even though it's not even half-empty yet. Tony just stares at him in a mix of admiration and amusement, and Steve just continues moving around the room to fill everyone's mugs.
And then, Stephen sits straight again and just the subtle movement causes everyone to turn back to him in wait.
He knows it's not a good idea to wake someone having a nightmare, and knows that there are things Steve's seen that he couldn't even comprehend but he can't stand the thought of watching helplessly as Steve continues to toss and turn. That's why he creeps forward, placing a careful hand on Steve's trembling shoulder in an attempt to rouse him.
He peels Tony's shirts off; and now that his secret's out, Tony's got no reason to deny him. He raises his arms, Steve tosses his shirt to the far corner of the room, then leans back to drink in Tony's bare chest.
Pepper asks, slow and cautious, because they both know the answer to it.
He shifts off of the couch, settling himself between Steve's legs so he has the perfect view of a blissed out face whenever he looks up. Steve looks down at him heatedly, tongue darting out to moisten his already swollen lips.
. He looks like he's satisfyed with whatever he'd been up to in the past day since he shut out everyone who cared about him. Okay, so maybe Steve
"See, I don't do breakfast." Tony tells him with an easy grin, and after lifting half of the sandwich off the plate, he nudges the plate over in the blond's direction, "If it's not caffeine, I usually don't want it in my body."
"I don't." Tony replies, and he hops off the table, closing the distance between himself and hunching forward so he can still look Steve in the eye, "And I don't want you to feel like you have to settle for me if you're not happy."
"Isn't it too soon to be thinking about all this?" Bruce pipes up, and it's like a knife cutting through. Tony, for one, is grateful for the one voice of reason, until he turns his head to thank Bruce and finds a mischevious glint on his face much like all the others, "I at least need enough time to renew my minister's ordinance."
"No wonder you keep running from me." Steve says against his collarbone, and Tony finds his own heart thud painfully. How was it that even when Tony was cruel to him and giving him the worst kind of pain imaginable, that Steve could sound so mournful toward him? Steve squeezes again, and though such close contact usually had Tony feeling trapped, he felt protected and safe. He felt
what kind of influence he had on Tony?
It's Pepper, who answers the moment the line connects with a hushed and concerned,
And when he's standing in front of the door, he falters. What is he supposed to even say? Is it too late for them after all? He wanted to give Steve space, but was that only assuming that they were strong enough to handle it?
"I think you two need to talk." Sam suggests, his eyes a little hard and his hand gesturing in the direction of the room they had all shared previously, "There's a lot we need to talk through as a team but we won't get anywhere unless you work things out."
"Clear the-"
He's said that already.
He realizes he's looking for pity instantly. He's always hated pity, even as a child. There's no pity in Steve's eyes, though. There's only heartbreak there, and there are teams spilling across his face as he reaches out. His hand clamps down onto Tony's shoulder, and with a firm tug, he brings Tony in for a hug. It's more of a squeeze, and Steve's head drops onto his shoulder, lips pressing against Tony's collarbone. Tony wants to pull away, to crack a joke, to apologize or
"I guess it makes sense that he told you." Bucky muses, and his eyes flicker to Tony's, then drop back to the brown liquid steaming away in his mug, "It's not really as simple as having feelings or not."
"You wanted to make me a villain, Avengers," he says next, and that shark-like grin is back. The suit comes back out of his skin and covers his hand with a gauntlet like it's always been a part of him, and he raises his palm in Steve's direction as he says, "And now you've got your wish."
Tony raises a hand; and this time, Steve lets him, even goes as far as to reach down and press Tony's open palm against his cheek.
From next to where they're sitting, an orange circle cuts into the air. Considering he knows who he's about to face, Steve bites back a grimace. He nods over to Bucky and Sam, because they're still holding onto Wanda. They still have to figure out what to do so that she
Tony lets out a sound like a choked sob, and when Steve looks up at him, his heart stops. Like this, with tears running down his face and his face crumpled in absolute sorrow, Tony is easily the most beautiful thing or person he's ever seen. He's a little guilty about causing such an emotional response in the brunet, but it relieves him to know Tony hasn't given up on them.
Steve lifts his head slowly, and while he's not crying, his eyebrows are drawn as he looks up at him. He seems to understand where Tony's going with it, and with a deep sigh, he raises a hand and brushes the back of it against Tony's cheek, "Then that's okay, too. If you don't want to go back, I won't force you."
At that point, he's openly begging to be fucked already, but Steve takes his sweet time to prepare Tony. He knows he needs it, because Steve is
"It's not too late, Tony." Clint tries, and he's lowering his bow because it is true that Tony can attack any one of them before he can launch an arrow, "You can come home. We'll work together again. Like we did before - like family."
"Who does he kill?" Bucky asks, and his eyes flicker over to Steve because everyone's seen the look of disdain Tony had for his former friend and leader.
for him. I think that's worth the downs that come along the way."
"I'm like a cold, you'll never see me coming until I hit." Tony quips back; and despite not knowing Hawkeye very well, they've always been able to banter easily.
"Did you just call the robot dumb?" Clint quips, and he sounds absolutely mortified, "Have you not learned anything from
"What's
"Remind me to stop missing you when I don't hear from you in years," he adds, like an afterthought, but his voice is far away as he stares down at an early blueprint of his Jericho missile.
Tony turns to them, and his smile is wide and sharp like he's been waiting for them to ask just that, "What's the fun in killing you there where you'd be unknown when I can kill it while you're on American soil?"
Steve releases a heavy sigh, and his arms lift to Tony's waist, arms wrapping tightly around the brunet and squeezing him against Steve's sturdy frame. He feels as though he's about to burst into tears, and Tony doesn't know how to help someone else when he was nearly at that himself just a few minutes prior after his own dreams.
Natasha. It never is personal with you. You would lead me to my death without remorse, then expect me to apologize for dying."
He scowls at the first name, which is well -- understandable -- but he softens considerably. Virginia, who otherwise went by the nickname Pepper, and James, who otherwise went by the nickname Rhodey, were the friends he had given up when he went on the run. He missed them terribly. Would it really be alright to contact them?
was the fact that when it exploded, the smaller pieces, shrapnel, would separate and shoot outward. It was a good idea at the time, considering they were supposed to be used to protect our soldiers," Tony continues to explain, and his own hand is clenched and shaking on top of his lap. He's dying for another drink, but it'll have to wait until the story's over, "Howard was supposed to go to Afghanistan for a weapon's display, but when it came down to it, Obadiah somehow convinced my old man to send me; that it was the best way to get my name out there as the next 'Merchant of Death.'"
A man hurries around the table over to him. He's a little older, with curled hair sitting atop his head and a pair of crooked glasses on his face. Usually, that would annoy Tony to no end, but it works for the man. The man, who is wearing the old apron his old butler Jarvis would wear while cooking. He tries hard not to dwell on it.
According to the time stamp on the text, it was received when he was in bed with Steve.
Not after promising he wouldn't hurt Steve anymore.
Steve pulls his hand until it's resting against the blond's chest. He can feel the steady beating of Steve's heart and fights back the whimper that makes him want to ask how Steve knows that. How the hell was Steve able to confidently claim they'd be okay?
At least Steve isn't the only one who's frustrated.
Steve turns his head, brushing his lips against the inside of Tony's palm and sighing against it with his eyes fluttering shut. Tony wishes for a way to be a little more reassuring, but he knows he can't promise anything. Being Iron Man meant there was always a chance he couldn't come home after a battle. That was why Pepper had left him in the past.
He's not surprised when that effectively ends their debate. He knows he's not entirely deserving of their respect considering he had them chased and thrown onto the Raft, but it's a comfort to know that they'd still follow his lead even in a moment like this.
And right now, he remembers the look of pure hatred on Wanda's face as she stops just before Steve and Tony.
"I'm here, sweetheart." Steve murmurs against his lips; and Tony flushes at the term of endearment.
"I'm sorry, Captain, for I'm not asking of your permission." Vision retorts, calm and sure and determined in himself, "I would still like to hold my memories of respect with her, and I can't let anyone else see what is to happen between us."
"Let me lead so I don't lose control." Steve mutters against his lips, a sheepish chuckle following as he teasingly rubs his head against Tony's entrance.
"I want you." Wanda continues, and she's managed to get closer to Tony without Steve even realizing it.
"Okay let's make this a vote by majority, then." He speaks up, and everyone turns to him expectantly, "Anyone who wants to stay for another night, say-"
"Are these all Howard's?" Bucky asks next, and there's wonder in his tone. Tony's heart flutters at the tone, but the fact that he thinks they'd belong to
Vision greeted them on the lawn, his normally expressionless face just that as he bid them a welcome. He would be the only one to welcome them. No bots, no Rhodes, and in a bittersweet reminder of what they had lost, no Tony Stark.
Thinking it's a ruse and he's just planning to get his revenge when he gets closer, Tony and Clint's efforts to get away double. Unfortunately, they spill into the kitchen like dominoes since they run out of wall to brace themselves with. Everyone else is already there, staring at them like they're aliens from another planet. Tony and Clint look at each other, having a silent conversation with just their eyebrows.
The moment the ring hits Steve's finger, Tony surges forward and kisses him. Steve's caught off guard and falls backward with Tony straddling his lap; but neither of them seem to care.
Sometime along the film, Sam and Bucky get up and return with several boxes of pizza. It does the trick of rejuvenating the pack for at least until the end of the movie; and now, chewing is more prevelant a sound than the chatter that had been going on for the first half. Steve has an entire pizza box that is resting between their laps, but even though he gives Tony that pointed look, Tony can't even pretend he's interested in food right now. No, the only thing Tony wants at this moment is a glass of whiskey -- no, make that an entire bottle.
When his stomach finally settles and he can focus on anything other than the spinning of his head, he finds that he is not alone, wherever he is. The rest of his team is there, wearing varying expressions on their faces that go from concerned to scared and in Wanda's case, hatred.
Tony reaches up, carding his fingers through Steve's hair, and tugs him forward into a kiss. Someone's hollering in the background, but Tony ignores everyone who isn't his husband.
Tony's lips are warm, a reminder that he's still alive and right in front of him. It should make him feel better, but it really doesn't.
"Why does what I believe even matter, Steve? Why do you care? Why
have him; but you're
Tony."
He holds a hand out between them, expecting for Steve to shake it, but really, he shouldn't be surprised that Steve takes the offered hand and pulls him into another searing kiss. Steve is a whirlwind of passion, he learns quickly, with Steve's teeth nipping at his lower tier and his hands caressing at Tony's waist. It's just as Tony parts his lips, wanting to give him just a little bit of a break, that Steve pulls himself away.
"And I deserve it." Steve cuts in, shoulders squared and jaw clenched. Whatever insults Tony has for him, he'll hear it out. It's less than what he deserves, even if it hurts to hear them.
"Wow. You got him to eat breakfast. I think you've won me over, Rogers." Rhodey whistles his approval, and there are several chuckles that follow along with it. Steve doesn't reply verbally, but his head ducks and the tips of his ears flush. Obviously, Rhodey's approval means something to him.
"You're making it hard for me to control myself, Tony." Steve tells him, lip quivering and his hands shifting to sit atop Tony's shoulders. His fingers are curled into the shoulder blades, too, and Tony can believe how hard Steve's holding himself back.
"Then you go and we'll stay here." Natasha retorts, but there's no confidence in her tone and she knows it.
The amusement on Steve's face falters, but just slightly. He's looking at Tony like Tony's the one thats strange. Their gazes hold, and Tony raises an eyebrow, feeling the anger in his body cool down even without his acceptance. Steve seems to notice it, too, and leans forward like he's trying to look into Tony's soul, "Sit across from me or sit beside me. We'll discuss that after you've eaten."
Tony bristles, narrowing his eyes to glare at Clint, but with a glance in Steve's direction, he's given enough confidence to get it done. After all, just once kiss later and he'd be allowed to move on with his life, without the name
"You said something as you came." Tony murmurs, his fingers trailing up and down Steve's forearm.
He doesn’t like the idea of sleeping separately from his husband. Even though they're technically just a little more than strangers, he can't help but wonder why Steve just doesn't want to share a bed.
"You can't do anything to me," Wanda answers, her voice smug as her gaze flickers from Steve to Tony.
"Threats come up empty." James replies, his gaze shifting from Steve to Clint and back, "Trust me when I say it's a promise."
That elicits just the slightest of snorts from Steve's nostrils, and the blond dips his head down. Tony's heart races, thinking that they'll finally have their first kiss; and yet, Steve just presses his lips against Tony's cheek and releases the brunet. He moves away, slowly but deliberately, to scour through the cabinets for microwaveable popcorn.
in the man's expression. He follows the metal-armed man into the house quickly, and the air falls thick around them as silence envelopes Steve, Natasha, and Tony. There are questions, and he can read them in their body language, but there's also so much hesitation between them like they're not sure if they're not welcomed. Steve and Natasha aren't even looking at Tony, to his frustration, but having a silent conversation through their eyes.
And then Steve rounds the corner. When Clint sees the expression on Steve's face, he grabs onto Tony's shoulder, pushes him in Steve's direction, and sprints in the direction of the kitchen. Spluttering about Clint being a traitor, Tony hoists himself up using Clint's shoulders and runs. It manages to erupt into a big, awkward game of leap frog as they attempt to get away from Steve. The blond is no longer angry as he follows. He's instad bellowing in laughter and his stomping slows as a result of it.
"When I graduated from my final degree, Howard had me working, in a completely unofficial role, to design weapons for Stark Industries. He got all the credit, but the designs were mine." He pauses to lick his lips, his eyes flickering shut as he faught the nasea that came with memories of his past, "We got a contract with the government. It was a big one, to design a missle big enough and powerful enough to wipe out any enemies of the state. Howard didn't have any new ideas at the time, so that one fell on me. A few months later, I created the Jericho missle."
It's silent for a long beat, and then,
And then his gauntlets power up and he spreads his hands apart. Everyone knows that move because everyone's seen the Hulk use that move. They might not have similar powers, but knowing that Tony has newfound abilities that put him up to par with Steve and Bucky, there are so many ways this can end up.
He's lucky that in their first week together, Iron Man hasn't been called. Or he might have been, but with the rest of the Avengers on the scene, Tony has never bothered to put his suit on.
"Guess you'll have to try harder next time," Tony manages, his tone teasing. It's not the best idea to edge on an alpha like this; even one with as much patience as Steve. He might be gentle like Tony's made of glass on most occasions, but the guy's got at least 50 pounds on him.
"He can and he will." Is Stephen's definite answer, "If things remain on the course in which they are going now, Tony Stark will be the downfall of the entire human race."
"You don't look like you want us here so why did you bring us here?" Bucky asks, because he doesn't have any reason to fear anyone. His brainwashing days are over, and he's already done so much to prove himself ever since.
Really, someone needs to give Tony a lesson in tact. That would really save everyone a lot of trouble.
That seems to startle a laugh out of Steve, although it's a wet sound and lingers with disbelief. The blond pulls back slowly, and Tony ignores the unshed tears gleaming in his eyes and instead focuses on the pointed raise of one of those beautiful brows.
"Obadiah is expecting me to go." Tony tells them, with his hands clenched on his lap. Yes, he's had a strained relationship with his old man; but they are still family, and Howard was all he had left. Obadiah would be waiting for him there with some sort of trap; and being at a public event, there would be little to avoid whatever the elder had in mind.
"I did." Steve agrees, and he leans over Tony's shoulder to look the brunet in the eye, "I said that I love you."
Tony feels the guilt spreading in his chest without his acknowledgement. Sure, the whole fate business and finding out he had a mate and finding out who that mate is didn't do good things to him. Sure, Tony spent the last few years running away from Steve and from his own father, but as far as things went, Steve was really trying to hold onto him. He might not have gone about it in the right way, but it wasn't like Tony was giving him another way to get close to him.
There's no sign of Tony for the rest of the day, though Steve isn't sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing. He wants to trust Tony and say that the worst is behind them; and yet, with their recent conversations and the way Tony
Then, Tony grins. It's fake and has too many teeth. It's like looking directly at a hungry shark. For all the masks Tony's ever worn throughout his entire life, this one isn't one they're expecting.
"I fell in love with him when he was still the scrawny kid that stood up to bullies and got beat up daily." Bucky says wirhout preamble, and Tony just stares at him for a moment without knowing what to do.
Steve Rogers, apparent alpha of the pack his father, Howard, had sprung onto him out of nowhere. He'd never met the man in person, but the pictures could never do him justice. Blond hair, chiseled face, broad shoulders - it was everything Tony had ever wanted but was afraid of having.
"I should reject you." Tony says, but he's trying so hard to keep it under his breath. There's a sharp inhale behind him, but Tony ignores it best he can. Being rejected by a mate is almost as painful as losing a mate to death. Very few wolves recover from it, really, but Steve has Bucky. He was just Tony, the person fate was constantly mocking. Steve would be better off without him.
He's the only one who seems to think so, though.
Satisfied by the response, Tony tugs at the waistband of Steve's sweats. The blond lifts his hips just slightly to help, and Tony pulls the sweats down to his feet.
In the morning, Tony wakes up feeling sweaty and warm in the best of ways. It's not even morning, the sun isn't peeking through the blinds and the gentle snores coming from behind him tell him it's too early to be awake; and yet, his brain is buzzing with activity. His back is pressed against Steve's chest still, the blond's arm draped carefully over his waist and holding him like a stuffed animal. He grins at the thought and shifts as carefully as he's able so that he can see Steve's face.
There's still Obadiah to deal with, and whatever tension Tony had with his father; but their bond has only grown since the first time they met. They might not know how to get around everything yet; but they have each other, a whole pack that he
"I love you, Steve." Tony utters out, and it takes a heartbeat for Steve to recognize the words. His eyes light up, much like the Christmas tree scenario Sam had invoked in his head. His eyes soften, and there are tears flowing freely down his cheeks. His lips split into a wide, charming grin, pearly white teeth and pink gums.
And he's right.
Grateful, Tony sits up in his bed and scoots back against the headboard. Really, he should've considered getting a burner phone years ago, if this was how it would end up.
family?
"What do you mean you can't eat all of that on your own?" Steve asks, his voice full of disbelief and amusement, even though he obliges and takes the empty seat, "This is a full meal for an adult, and you skipped breakfast."
"Pass." Tony answers, holding a palm out to reject the offer. He's about to turn and blast off, because now that the threat is neutralized he can go looking for Steve to make sure he's okay; but he's halted by a strong hand pressing down onto his shoulder.
"You're so good, sweetheart." Steve tells him, his voice husky and full of adoration, and Tony feels himself flush as his cheeks hollow.
There's an alien on the screen; at least, that's what it looks like. There's destruction following it like it's attracting it, and there's a body count flashing on the bottom of the screen. The scene is being filmed via helicopter, and Tony feels his stomach clenching as he watches.
, and met us with weapons to take us down." Sam barrels ahead, and he taps a finger onto the dining table.
"A friendly?" Sam echoes, like the very thought of it is bizarre.
with him?"
His gaze darts between them again, settling on Scott who doesn't speak much to him, then moving to Bucky who had his shoulders hunched like he's trying to make himself seem smaller and unassuming, and then he turns to Steve.
He's cut off by a deep growl and then Steve's hand is under his chin, strong enough to direct his head but not strong enough to hurt, "You're not a replacement for anyone. Bucky and I didn't work out, but that's got nothing to do with
absurd. Tony loved the woman and wanted to marry her. That woman took over his company and held his hand through the darkest times. Steve was always envious of it, but what could he really do if it meant Tony was finally happy and on his way to settling down.
of all people makes his lips curl into a grimace.
Tony waits a beat, like he's trying to see if he's being made fun of for it. When he doesn't see anything in the group that would cause for him to scurry away, he turns around and waves a hand behind him, "Come on. The elevator's on the other side of the workshop."
"You asked for it," Steve retorts simply; and in the next moment, he has Tony's hands pinned over his head with one of his own hands and grips both of their cocks in his free one.
"You were in the pararescue unit. It makes sense in my head."
"Do you want a stage or something? Some showgirls and a dance number?" Tony snarls at him, waving a hand in the air the way he always gestured while talking in the past.
"It was a long time ago," Steve explains, and he's looking at his shoes with a heightened interest. Tony is looking over at him, eyebrows drawn, because surely, that's not really much of an explanation. Steve moves, then, taking jerky steps forward and dropping himself down onto the stool beside Tony's car, "Bucky and I -- we grew up together, you know? We spent all our time together and got into a lot of trouble together, too. But you should know that mate bonds are important in the wolf community. Everyone expected us to be mates when we turned 18,  but we weren't. We aren't meant to be."
Steve, on the other hand, crawls back over him, starting at his thighs and pressing soft kisses along his skin. His lips are soft and warm and the kisses leave behind a trail of fire as he climbs up to Tony's chest. He stops at each scar, kissing them in a gentle manner that could only come from Steve, and when he reaches Tony's lips again, Tony's suddenly overcome with emotion.
"Enjoy this with me now, instead." Steve responds, and even though he's straining for relief and his body is convulsing from holding back his orgasm, he sounds so composed that Tony's thoroughly impressed.
Tony asks, and now he's actually panicking a little bit. He knows Howard knows about Steve and his pack, but he's not sure as to what extent.
Steve pulls away, and they're both panting and Tony can feel the flush on his face mirroring Steve's pale skin. Steve looks incredibly sexy like this - hooded blue eyes, swollen lips, and chest heaving. He's still angry, it seems, and Tony knows it's not something words can solve.
"He did
meant to be, I'd have at least had an inkling, you know? But it didn't happen that way. I ended things between us as soon as I came to terms with it, and Steve's stubborn ass kept trying to cling onto me. The boy's got a whole crazy notion when it comes to true love and bonded mates."
Wanda distracts them by shooting another blast of her power; though this time Tony's able to react fast enough to have his mechanical boots wrap around his feet and lift off the ground.
No. It's not hard to assume. It's just that Steve doesn't want to assume it because it's Tony. Tony, with stubborn ideals and cries of accountability. It feels like the futurist is unable to move on from his past.
"Hold on, I need a drink." Tony answers, holding a single finger up as he pours the scotch in his glass. He hasn't had alcohol in years, and scotch tastes better on the rocks, but he needs it at moments like this when the world is crumbling around him.
"How about you?" Tony asks, and he notices a few frayed edges on Steve's polo shirt that hadn't been there earlier in the day, "Have anything for me to look over?"
"You don't wear underwear." Tony notes, amused, and he runs his thumb along the crown of Steve's dick.
"welcome to the land of the living!" Sam calls, cheerful yet sarastic, and there's the briefest roll of his eyes added onto it.
Steve flashes him a grin and moves to put the bags down in the kitchen. He wants to ask, Tony can see it clearly on his face; and he hates how weak he is to that puppy dog look.
anyway. thanks for all the kudos, bookmarks, and comments.  I love the feedback and knowing that people do enjoy my work so I hope to continue writing decent content. thanks for sticking around if you’re not bored with the story yet.
Tony's finished his first mug of coffee while Bucky had told his story, and he remains silent as he stands to pour another mug. It's not the same as scotch or whiskey, but at least the caffeine helps his brain wake up when he needs for it to.
"We can't do that, Wanda." Sam answers, and his wings unfurl from his back so he can join her in the air, "We're a really shitty group of friends, but we're still friends. We're
The third week is, whether fortunately or unfortunately, quiet. There are no alien invasions, he's mostly caught up on his R&D work, and suddenly he has so much free time and no idea on how to spend it.
"I'm sorry I didn't call." Tony says, his voice heavy and quiet, "I didn't think you'd want to hear from me."
"Where the hell are we?" Clint asks, and the archer is rubbing his shoulder. Tony had done a number on him after all, and that was just from a blast of his repulsor. They've all been blasted at in the past, whether by accident or on purpose, but back then being blasted at didn't accompany the scent of charred flesh.
The rest of the team is already there, sitting around the dining table that is once more, empty. Wanda is there, but the cloth that Stephen had once used to quell her powers is draped over her hands once more. She's glaring daggers in their direction. Wanda is young and held a lot of resentment for Tony that really - Steve couldn't understand. Sure, Tony designed weapons and a missile his company designed took her family away.
"What's so funny?" Steve asks, and he stills his hand as he does so. His head pulls back just slightly, lips trailing up to the spot behind Tony's ear. That spot is specifically sensitive, and Steve knows it.
They live in Steve's apartment, but that's only because that's where they started. Tony would more than prefer to live in his private penthouse overlooking the city; but Steve's had no interest in moving in and Tony figured it would be a change of scenery.
Both Wanda and Tony turn to look at him for a short second, considering his words; but they both turn to each other in wait to see who makes the first move. Forget Spanish soap opera it's more like an old Western film.
"In this reality, with the way things are building up, there are very few outcomes." Stephen continues, and he's really got a knack of ignoring everyone else's input, "Stark revives the Ultron program, takes control of it to destroy the remnants of the Avengers, and then he surrenders the Earth itself to the destruction that will come along with the arrival of Thanos, the mad Titan."
Steve stares after his fading back, and then he gathers his courage and stands up to go to Tony's room. Bucky's right, of course. No matter what Tony's thinking about the whole thing, he would just have to be patient and willing to listen. He had once told Tony he would break his heart a million times over to stay close; and that hasn't changed.
He might as well have said he was the one who killed Howard; even though an investigation was still going on. Everyone stopped to stare at him, and even the bots froze in place.
"It was in Afghanistan, actually. I got hit by a stray bullet, thought I'd lose a foot." How Sam manages to sound amused despite the story is beyond him, but still, Tony finds himself drawn in, "I spent some time with vets, like I told you, and then one day, Steve and Bucky walk in."
Natasha looks at him increduously, and Tony really hates it when people look at him like he's stupid, "We follow you. Did you forget?"
There are dozens of tables and possibly hundreds of people between them, and yet Steve looks at him like he's the only one that exists. Frankly, the very thought of that disturbs him. After spending years on the run to get
He's not sure how much time passes, but eventually, Tony falls asleep with Steve's fingers carding carefully through his hair.
Their first fight follows after a particular battle in which the Avengers had gone up head-to-head with poorly designed AIM bots. They worked well enough together as a team, but he couldn't pretend Captain America was getting to become one of his favorite people.
”Anyone else?” Stephen asks; and just a second later, everyone else has a refill of the tea that was obviously not their preferred choice in beverage.
Steve walks in at that moment, arms overburdened by paper shopping bags. He pauses in the threshold as he looks them over, eyebrows raised in a silent question.
"And well, I told them that day that I was done making weapons; that I wouldn't sit by in a world where I wasn't held accountable for the weapons I created, and I wasn't going to let them distribute the Jericho while it was still technically my design." He scoffs again, then, and he actually does feel a little amused by the thoughts in his head, "Since I was still a minor and in an unofficial post, Howard and Obadiah still had the rights to my designs. I will never forget how the old man had the nerve to look me in the eye and tell me that true peace meant having a bigger stick than the other guy. So, I destroyed every copy of the blueprints to the Jericho, and I packed up my shit and left."
"That was as my fault as much as it was Tony's." Steve answers, his voice hard and his jaw clenching.
"Are you okay?" Steve asks, swaying in his spot like he wants to move forward. Tony's not sure if he can handle Steve getting closer yet or not.
It's a challenge and he knows it, but Tony just continues to stare at him, his gaze hard and contemplative all at once. He runs his tongue along his lower lip, and this really isn't the time for Steve to get distracted.
Obviously, a fight breaks out. Wanda charges into him with her magic, because she's always hated Tony and this was just adding fuel to the flame; but she's still not as in control of her powers as she'd like to be and Tony's been on the frontlines for years. Vision does more to protect her than to attack Tony; which is understandable, considering some parts of him are made up of JARVIS, who had been created to protect him. Scott shrinks down to get closer and divert his attention like he'd done before, but gets flicked away like the bug he's named after.
He clears his throat, raising his hands to Steve's shoulders and pushing gently so they can look each other in the eye. Steve goes, but he's reluctant in doing so. His eyes are bloodshot and the tip of his nose is red. Tony knows he's not much better off himself, and yet, Steve's the most gorgeous person he's ever seen.
"None of us have dads anymore. Some of us never met our dads, some of us were hurt by them; but you?" Steve's bristled in his anger, his shoulders shaking in a way that always reminds Tony of Howard as he pulls forward even with Bucky trying to hold him back, "I get wanting to get away from him because you felt oppressed. I never wanted you to come back because of him. But he's
James's eyes flicker over to Bucky again, this time more deliberate and thoughtful. Bucky lifts his head just enough to look at him in return, his eyebrows twitching and his lips curled into the slightest of frowns. They've never met before, as far as Steve's concerned, but there's something there.
Steve had come back with a sandwich and Bucky following him after their last stop. Truthfully, he didn't want to stop; but while he was used to driving for days with no end in sight, he couldn't find it in him to force them to do the same. Tony couldn't eat; he couldn't even raise the cup of coffee he would usually inhale to his lips. Steve tried that look again, of course, but Tony was a bundle of nerves. Bucky strong-armed him into sitting in the back. He frowned and glared, but the metal-armed man was just as stubborn as Steve on a normal day. Tony just sighed, stretched out in the back seat, and tried to ignore the many glimpses Steve threw at him over the rear-view.
”It wasn’t me.” Steve answers, calm despite the rage of emotions filling him, “The security on the raft was down. As fast and as strong as I am, I wouldn’t have been able to get everyone out without help from the outside.”
"Is that ... is Bucky and me hanging out a problem?" Steve asks then, swallowing heavily like he might just cry.
infact part of it now. His past with Howard and Obadiah be damned, he's Steve's family now.
"You were serious about lunch?" Tony asks with an eyebrow quirked, and Steve reaches down with a free hand. Tony's covered in motor oil, but that doesn't seem to deter him the slightest as he hoists the genius to his feet.
Tony's not too good with humans. That's why most of his friends growing up were bots he programmed himself. He wonders why the others thought it would be a good idea to have Sam come find him, considering his earlier reaction to Tony's weapons history.
They both know they have a deadline approaching and very few options. Tony can't sleep, not with threats of Howard and Obadiah and the Jericho hanging over his head.
"That's a multi-million dollar prosthesis and I'd appreciate it if you put it down." Tony snarks back and he holds his hand out.
Tony's heart skips a beat, his lower lip trembling just from the calling of his name. He knew what he was going to be giving up years ago, but still, just hearing her voice made him long for the home he once had. His fingers grip at the small flip phone, and possibly hard enough to dent the metal, "
"Tony Stark is a good man." Natasha answers Stephen, her own lips curled back into a snarl, "He is still grieving, but killing us won't change anything for him. Rhodey would still be dead, and he would just continue living with the reminder that he's killed his former teammates and friends."
Tony Stark, after all. But I figured you'd get bored and tell him to fuck off and I'd finally have my shot."
, that I didn't want anything to have to do with it. It has nothing to do with Steve, personally, and even now I think that if I hadn't been born, maybe he'd have a better mate like-"
