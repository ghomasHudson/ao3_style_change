His excuses were wearing a little thin when he saw Tony playing with laser pointer and Dummy racing around the workshop, U and Butterfingers in the corners ready to pounce. Really though! That was just cute! Who was he to think there was something else behind it, especially if it was unintentional.
It swung open slowly, the door banging lightly on its hinges before settling about halfway open. The two men started at it.
“No! No.” He said gripping Tony’s hand on his shoulder and using his other hand to rub his thumb across over the other man’s forehead where he had brained himself. “Nothing’s wrong! I-I just-” He glanced at the carrier which was very still on the table “I got you a gift.”
The Avengers had dealt the bug, which had not only had chirped so loudly it had cracked windows but had managed to smash several buildings, including a favorite coffee shop and an animal shelter. Lucky there has been minimal injury, human or animal, but the clean-up was immense since sticky cricket goop had ended up on everything.
Tony stared at him, opened his mouth to stay something when he suddenly paused looking down at his hand. The cat had jumped onto the couch he was standing beside and was now sniffing at him questioningly. When Tony didn’t make a move, she proceeded to rub her face along the lines of his fingers.
It said something about how smitten Steve was that he had really was enthralled by Tony, even when he had absolutely no clue what the man was talking about.
“Jarvis,” Steve started, his voice hesitant as he sat in front of the computer screen “do you think-”
Steve nodded along to the torrent of words, squeezing Tony’s hand glancing around. He always saw that stupid cat over here… it would be the one day he wanted to see the damn thing that-
Tony cooed rubbing his fingers atop her head and whispering to her about all the things he was going to make her.
He started by asking Tony to grab dinner with him outside of the park. There was this awesome pizza place he knew so it was easy to tempt the man to go.
If he was being simple he could just point blank ask Tony why he didn’t have one, but Tony had surprised Steve with things so many times he really wanted to give one back. Just last week Tony had come bounding up the stairs with a new wax for Steve’s shield that would create greater bounce to oncoming objects.
“Itwasjusthat,youseemedtolikethemandIaskedPepperandevenyouandtheredidntseemtobeaproblemfortheothersandyoudidntsaythatyoudidntlikecatsexactlyIknowyouneversaidyoudidlikethemeitherbutitkindaseemedlikeyoudidsoIaskedJARVIS,orratherIguesshekindaknewanditjusthappenedPepperhelpedwiththepaperworkedandeverything,butreallyifIwaswrongitsfinewecan-”
Steve was unable to help himself as he laughed watching Tony snatch whatever it was from the bot before hurling himself on the couch next to Steve. Dummy rolling to the couch beeping excitingly and angling towards the screwdriver in Tony’s hand.
He didn't think about the moment till much later, after he had finally bucked up and (according to Clint) "put on the moves" and asked Tony out.
"Tasha can you head to 5th and make sure Fury isn't shitting a brick? Him and Maria were up there for a meeting." Natasha rolled her eyes at being made essentially a babysitter for the leader of their spy organization, but it was probably a good call. Fury got pissed when his shoes got dirty.
exhausted, the dark smuggest under his eyes hadn’t reached the ‘dark of the night’ stage and he seemed pretty coherent “Only about 17 hours, why you have a hot date planned?”
“Uhhh” Steve honestly had no idea what to say at this point. Tony hadn’t taken his wide eyes away from the table staring like he could see through walls.
Steve had to admit he was a little excited, he had never really thought about owning a pet himself. Back in the 40’s people were too worried about keeping themselves fed to worry about feeding a pet so it really hadn’t been a thought. Looking through the various cat photos online had been pretty fun and he might already be kind of attached to the one he had read about at this shelter. If the description of the animal was accurate he was pretty sure it would be the perfect addition to the weird little family Steve had made for himself.
“I know, I know.” Pepper groaned, and even when she was clearly at the end of her rope she still looked composed enough to be on camera “But after hours of screens my eyes need a break.”
"Hold that thought agent." Tony said suddenly and Steve looked to find him staring intently at something across the street. "Brb."
"Stark!" Phil raised his voice a touch, betraying frustration under the mask of calm "what the hell?"
Steve stood in the elevator bouncing on the balls of his feet, nervous with energy. Beside him the cat carrier sat on the floor, very still, its occupant clearly nervous about what was happening.
“Yeah,” Tony had moved his head to rest on Steve’s shoulder “it was orange and super fat. Once I build this little wheelie thing for him to chase but he just stared at it before sitting on it when it was still. I tried a whole bunch of other ones too, but the damn animal just ignored them. It was pretty great though, always had someone to play with at Jarvis’s house.” Tony’s voice was fond holding none of the pain it usually did when talking about his youth.
. So, he decided fuck it, and with Jarvis’s help picked out the best shelter he could find and downloaded the application.
Steve laughed and glanced back at the computer screen as it reloaded before his eyes. Google was now showing a list of adoptable cats in New York.
Steve grinned up at the ceiling. He had long ago given up trying not to look and just accepted it was something he was going to do. “You know, when you start to answer my questions before I ask it just makes me believe you are closer to taking over the world than we all think.”
“Steevvveee I was working on that.” Tony’s eyes were shining as he spoke the brown of his eyes soft in the low light.
“Down! Down you bug!” Tony said leaning into Steve, his voice filled with mirth. Steve still chucking reach up and scratched at Dummy’s arm. Instantly the bot calmed letting out a soft whirr of contentment.
Part four actually turned out to be the most challenging. Now that Steve was determined to get Tony a cat he realized he didn’t know when he was supposed to get him one. Did he wait for a holiday? A birthday?
Now that he was confident that a cat was something Tony actually enjoyed, Steve moved onto part three: The other Avengers.
“And I told you that U is a perfectly acceptable name. Besides U doesn’t have a problem with it!” Tony was a little indignant as he spoke crossing his arms before quickly uncrossing them to give the cat a pet as she wandered by.
Pepper sighed again as though reliving a particularly bad memory. Steve couldn’t help but smile, putting up with Tony Stark wasn’t a full-time job, it was a lifestyle. Pepper Potts really was a gift to the world.
Steve casually tossed the salami in the path when he was sure Tony wasn’t paying attention. He needn’t have worried; his boyfriend was happily gesticulating in the air about… something…
“Hey,” Steve objected “They told me she has no trouble hearing, they have noticed no adverse behavior from the-”
However, just because he thought it was a good call, didn't mean that the other people in his family would. Sure, he had talked with Pepper Potts and she agreed it was a smart plan, but she was also a little biased about the whole thing.
“So,” Steve murmured at Tony leaned back into him “the shelter was calling her Mia but we can change her name if you want?”
“It’s just,” Steve began watching Tony grin “Well no one shouldn’t have a home just ‘cause they aren’t perfect.”
Steve covered his mouth before he could really get himself going, an involuntary smile curling his lips. Tony froze looking up at him mild panic still crossing his face. “No, it’s nothing like that.” Steve said unable to help the nerves from coming through in his voice “Really, I just thought… well if you don’t like it its totally fine. I talked to them and they said that if needed it would be okay that I bring it back, it just kinda frowned upon you know? I think Pepper would-”
“Oh,” he wasn’t exactly sure how to respond to that, and to be honest it still didn’t explain exactly what Pepper was doing with her stacks of papers. Lucky Pepper seemed to understand from his less than intelligent response and continued:“If it was up to Tony he would throw as much money as possible to all the shelters in the US. But we can’t have Stark industries donating to one cause only. If Stark industries donates to all the charities of one type then we will be expected to do the same for every other type. Not only can we not do that, but really we don’t want to donate to every ‘charity’.” Peppers voice has a lilt on that last word. She continued “Besides I finally convicted him we can’t give money to every lost cat. Though he made me swear up and down I would pick the best one to donate too. I forbade him from picking after the 2006 debacle.”
The sitting room, which if they were being honest was more Tony’s secondary office than anything, was bathed in blue light as he approached the entry. The room had several comfy chairs and a couch with a large ‘coffee table’ in front of it.
Sure, he vaguely noticed that when they walked through the park hand in hand if a cat was nearby Tony's eyes would track it. But it was hardly on the radar it wasn't like Tony stopped walking or even talking.
The genius behind stark industries, twice voted top bachelor, graduate of MIT at age 18, motherfucking
“Captain…” JARVIS began, his voice containing a certain judgement that Steve never would have thought a robot could have before he met one Tony Stark.
Steve casually walked closer to the animal. The piece of salami prepared in his right hand, his left still holding Tony closely. The cat had started to take interest in what was going on. Steve was trying to walk slowly as to not startle the animal and fast enough to not make Tony suspicious. It was much harder than he thought.
It was so soft that they wouldn’t have caught it if they hadn’t been both focusing so hard on the box.
“Ow!” Tony gripped his head with one hand and grabbed Steve’s shoulder with the other “Are you okay? What’s wrong?”
Steve would like to point out that he was absolutely not scared of Pepper Potts. Pepper had told him a hundred time he could bother her at any time about anything. Still Steve was a little embarrassed to knock on her door clutching a handful of paper’s regarding cat adoptions.
Tony wasn't listening and had started to walk, Iron Man suit and all, across the street toward a group of people.
Steve really didn't connect the dots until Pepper Potts showed up at breakfast with a stack of papers she thumped down on the table. Steve raised this eyes at the pile (Stark industrials was well known to be relatively paper free). Steve had been worried he and Pepper wouldn’t get along, after all there was some history there, but lucky they had become pretty good friends. They both loved art and bonded over the dumb shit Tony Stark did. Pepper had actually been not only encouraging about Steve asking Tony out, about also helpful when it came to dealing with the man in question. A year since Steve had stuttered out an awkward “will you maybe get dinner with me” and Pepper and Steve had become pretty close, going to the MET and local art showings and even getting tea together, sometimes with Bruce.
Steve was pretty sure that having a cat in the tower would not be too much of a problem. He had done some research on the care of cats, and even with missions and whatnot there should always been someone around to at least feed the animal. He was pretty sure none of the Avengers would mind. Actually, he was sure most of them would be thrilled with the idea. Clint lost his shit every time he saw any animal and Thor liked anything that was fluffy. Steve wasn’t sure about Bruce and Natasha, but he figured if anyone had a major problem they would keep the car in their suite. It was large enough for a dozen cats let alone one.
“An addition of a feline to the tower would not truly inconvenience me in any way. None of the occupants have any reported allergens to cats, and my data is in favor of sir owning an animal. I did indeed try to persuade him to get one in ’09 since research indicated having a pet can reduce stress and anxiety.”
“Okay!” Purple scrub lady came back into the room with a smile, “she is in a great mood this morning, which she usually is anyway. Right this way Mr. Rogers!”
Tony hasn’t noticed him enter and now that Steve is close enough he can hear Tony talking softly to himself as he flings data sets through the air. From what he can make out as the images fly by his face it looks like some form of bulletproof fabric. As Tony pull up a new screen Steve reaches out and snags the image tossing it over his shoulder and leaning over the billionaire.
Steve shrugged, tried a bit of a smile.  “I’d have to hate an awful lot of people, then,” he pointed out.
Steve nodded immediately, fervently, not opening his eyes, jolting his head up and down.  Tony found himself smiling, biting his lip, looking down at Steve, running both hands through his hair now, fondness twisting tight and bubbling up inside him until it almost made his throat hurt.
As it happened, it looked like what Tony wanted was to have Steve’s hands curled loosely around the back of his own head, and Steve complied with a willing, happy sigh, letting his head roll inward against Tony’s cheek again so his mouth rested against the line of Tony’s beard and curling his fingers eagerly into those thick, dark curls, like so much unspun silk under his fingers, thick and springy and soft.  He loved touching Tony’s luxurious hair, black but not so black it didn’t shine brown in the light, curling and soft under his fingers, even if the best part was always how Tony shuddered and gasped and sighed when he stroked it, and even now, Tony was shuddering under the touch, even as Steve kneaded gently at the back of his neck and curled his fingers loosely into it.
At the Grand Prix Final, almost three years ago.  Steve had been there, just to cheer on his teammates, of course.  He’d seen the whole thing.  He still wasn’t sure if he’d admired Tony for skating more than he was horrified by the blatant disrespect, the inappropriateness of the whole thing, or the other way around.  He should have withdrawn, everyone had said.  Given some other skater his spot, rather than make a mockery of the whole event. Maybe that was true, but Steve—well, Tony had worked for it, he’d thought.  He’d understood why he’d wanted to skate.  Even though he … probably shouldn’t have.
“Hey, no,” Tony said, still soft.  His fingers dropped, rubbed at the back of Steve’s neck, and he almost closed his eyes again in pleasure, had to fight against it.  “You need the rest.  How are you feeling?”
“Well, you are a little ray of sunshine, aren’t you?” Tony said, but he was smiling now, slinging his skates over his shoulder.  He looked Steve up and down, and then said, “All right, a big ray of sunshine.  A very big ray of sunshine.”
Brock arched his eyebrows at him.  “He’s not what?” he sneered.  “A cock hungry whore like you?  That’s the truth.  I don’t think anyone could want cock as bad as you do.  I didn’t even have to pay you for it, did I?  You just got down on your knees and bent right over like the best little cockslut in the world.  No way Stark would be a cock-hungry slut like you who needs his ass beat black and blue to spurt off.”
on it, reduced to nothing but sensation and feeling, caught between pleasure and pain, so overcome there were tears in his eyes, yet he’d press himself back for more, rocking into the swats to his rump and legs and whimpering, it was—it was a heady feeling, went straight to Steve’s dick, but deeper than that, too, like it settled under his skin, went down to his bones, that
“Just as long as you know,” Tony said, softly, sounding a little unsteady, his fingers curling gently in Steve’s hair, tugging just a little.
“You bet there was,” Tony said in a low voice.  “Don’t worry, babe, still as pretty as ever.” He reached up with his other hand, gently squeezed Steve’s chin and jaw in his hand, gently enough it barely hurt, and let it drop.  “Just looks like a sunburn.  I’ve seen you get worse on the beach.  You’re a lucky bastard as always.  Hair didn’t even get singed.”
Clint lasts two months, after Tony leaves. He has nightmares a lot, Steve can hear it, the hitching sobs and Natasha's soothing voice easing him from the grip of terror.
“Is this goodbye,” Tony demands and Steve blinks. “I know--I know. She’s your epic, your forever girl. You came back in time for her.”
It takes two days but on the second, when the sun is setting and the court has dispersed for the evening and Morgan has been tucked into bed, Natasha pauses. "He's waiting for you," the spymaster says, and he tips his head at her. She smiles, a small thing. "In our home. Go. I'm tired of a sulky knight and a pining king."
He goes silent, listens as Tony reels off the benefits the team won’t lose, listens to him appoint Maria Hill to be their contact within SI, listens as he says, rocking on his heels and hesitant for the first time. “I think that’s everything. Go save the world.”
"Why come back now?" Rhodes asks, and Tony twitches toward him, his best friend and his brother, even as his gaze is fixed on Steve.
He grits his teeth and when Steve sits next to him, Tony drapes himself over Steve’s shoulders, brushes a kiss over the shell of his ear and murmurs, “I need to talk to Howard. Then we’re leaving. I wanna get you home and ride you.”
A hand, light on his shoulder, familiar fingers curving around the bone and muscle, a tether of flesh and bone that’s stronger than steel or his shield.
He's itching for it, shifting in his skin and eager for a fight, eager to split his knuckles and drag Tony's  attention back to him, and there's nothing for him to fight, and no one from Tony's merry little band of criminals will come near him.
His voice shakes and Tony shifts, off the counter and into his arms, small and soft against him, grounding and reassuring and everything he wants.
After everything. The war and Thanos and the long empty years when he clung to bitterness and anger because it was so much easier than admitting what he wanted. After the last gasp of hope, and the months spent trapped together in the past, and that battle when Steve had knelt next to him and he lay dying--
“It was?” Steve said, and he sounded a little hesitant now.  “I was a little afraid I was too much.  With the, you know, my mouth on your pretty little hole, and all.  I know you don’t—it makes you kind of uncomfortable—”
Steve nodded, heard himself sniff a heavy breath as he struggled to keep his eyes from stinging further because of the pure sensations of it.  “Yeah, good,” he slurred, and hardly recognized his own voice at all.
Steve wanted to promise that it would be all right, that he’d make sure it was okay, that no one gave Tony a hard time, but he was afraid that would be too much.  They hardly knew each other, after all.  He would just make sure that no one gave Tony a hard time, and then, maybe next time, thought it felt presumptuous even to think about a next time, but maybe then Tony would feel well, safer, accepting an invitation from him.  “All right,” he said, and smiled at him.  “Great.”
“If that’ll get you out on the field with me, sure,” Steve managed.  He felt lightheaded and his head was still throbbing, but everything felt better with Tony’s hand in his, with Tony bantering with him like this, like always.
The tone still made Steve flush.  “I—just thought,” he said, and swallowed.  “You seemed like you were here alone, so.”
Tony’s fingers slid down over the bottom of Steve’s pec again, teasing gently where he was already sensitive, and then he squeezed, hard, hard enough that Steve could feel himself bruising under his thumb, his fingers, and he was so close, he nearly came, he saw stars, but—but it wasn’t quite enough, not quite enough.  He could feel his dick throbbing, aching, he was straining, so damn close, and he made a helpless noise, pitiful in his own ears, twisted against Tony, jerked his hips despite himself, despite how badly he wanted to be good, felt his fingers clenching in Tony’s soft dark hair and panted against his jaw, soft breath and messy wet from his mouth hanging open, gave a whine through his nose that sounded high-pitched and desperate even to him.  Tony squeezed again, and oh, oh, if he could only come from that—
, oh, God, it hurt so good, so damn good.  Tony tugged again, and Steve groaned again.  “That’s it,” Tony said.  “Let me hear it, big boy.  Let me hear your voice.  Groan so gorgeously, just like that, for me.  So gorgeous.”  He gripped tightly, twisted, dug his nail in until Steve was whimpering, panting, then moved to the other, gripped,
He felt too heavy, too soft and uncoordinated, his limbs like they weighed about a million pounds each, to pick himself up after that, but somehow Tony managed to get him on his feet, managed to coax him to put one foot in front of the other—giving him another kiss helped with that, fingers curled in Steve’s hair at the back of his neck as he tugged Steve lightly in toward him—and then Steve was in the other room again, and Tony was pulling a pair of loose pajama bottoms up over his feet, his legs, his sore rear.  “No undies for you right now,” Tony said, smiling, “take it easy on your poor ass and freeball it, okay, stallion?”  There was a pajama top a moment later, Tony buttoning it up.
“Are you kidding?” Steve breathed, fingers dipping down and running over the delicate lace as he looked up to the mirror again, watching it.  “I
“No, no,” Steve murmured, hand coming up and traveling softly through his damp hair.  “You’re so beautiful, sweetheart.  That was amazing.  You’re amazing.  Thank you.”
He pushed and pushed and even with Steve’s softened hole, thrust-open wide, there was a tight, burning stretch, but he blew out a breath and made himself relax, relaxed his muscles one by one, making them go loose, blossom open and let it in, and then it was slipping inside, easy as anything, and Brock was laughing, fucking it back and forth, in and out, and Steve’s eyes burned, he went molten with humiliation, because it felt
Brock choked him while he fucked him, looped his belt around Steve’s neck and pulled it tight, and Steve cried out and nearly came each time, but never got quite close enough.  “God, you can’t be quiet, can you,” Brock said after the third time, “Just can’t quite do it, you needy piece of ass.”  Steve had no breath—or words, really—to respond.  Finally Brock dropped him, let his head fall back loosely into the bed, and concentrated on fucking him, and Steve fisted his hands in the bed and let himself be fucked.
He squeezed Steve’s rear again, massaging firmly, almost roughly, the pain-pleasure of it kicking Steve up again into someplace even warmer, even
“Okay, this is how we’re gonna do this, Steve—you don’t mind if I call you Steve, right?” Rumlow said, and Steve shook his head against the bed, but Brock still wasn’t moving.
“Okay,” he said then, took Tony’s face in his hands again, kissed his hot, sweaty forehead.  “Sure thing, mister.”  He got an arm around Tony’s waist, careful of his hot shoulders and sore, welted backside, and used it to lift him up, just the slightest bit, with Tony’s help, bracing his arms on Steve’s shoulder and holding himself up, so he could ease his other hand down, undo his belt and push it to the side, undo his flies and tug his briefs down over his hips until his cock sprang free. God, it was wet, wet and leaking and he gave it a brief tug and moaned himself, threw his head back a moment, because God, God, that hot wet slide of friction after so long—
moans, moaning Tony’s name, both hands in his hair now, stroking and gripping, and it felt so good, so, so good, that Tony’s cock felt hot and damp in his panties, against his hot skin under the garter belt.  Tony felt warm all over, and every tug or squeeze or stroke of Steve’s hand in his hair made him shiver with that warmth as another wave of it passed over him, pooled in his cock, flushed warm in his face, in the ache of his jaw.  Tony let himself settle into that warm, loose, easy feeling, fuzz out on that pressure and ache, the feeling of Steve warm and hot and heavy and pulsing down his throat, lost himself in that heavy drag, the hot slide along his tongue, in and out of his mouth, in working his tongue, hollowing his cheeks, sucking, the way Steve’s hips juddered and worked under him, until he was pressing his lips to Steve’s base, into his pubic hair, against his skin, in a wet, red kiss, closing his lips firmly around Steve’s cock so Steve would be sure to notice, to remember the red lipstick stain, the releasing a bit as he let himself drag back up.
“You beg so prettily,” Tony said softly.  “Never seen anyone who begs as prettily as you, sweetheart.  All so, so damn sweet and sincere and honest.”  A gentle circle of a fingertip around Steve’s painfully sensitive nipples, over the tips, above where the balls bit into his skin.
Steve grinned at him, grateful for the consideration, and grabbed a piece of bacon on his way past.  He was loopy and a little faint from hunger, and surely Brock wouldn’t begrudge him that much.
He’d never thought, exactly, he’d be the sort of person who had hot dates.  Not like Tony, who could have dated any woman—any
“I—” Steve started, and then subsided, because Tony was already up, fussing around.  In a second later he was sitting back on the bed by Steve’s side with a plastic cup in his hand, holding a plastic spoon full of ice chips to Steve’s lips.  Steve accepted them quietly, gratefully, really, but the best part was that Tony rubbed his chin, along his jaw, with his thumb again, stroking lightly along Steve’s jaw as Steve swallowed them.  He felt himself go hot and pink again, and let his eyes slide closed as he took another spoonful of ice chips to suck on. Tony petted his jaw again, and Steve sighed with pleasure.  This was worth any amount of pain, to have Tony want to take care of him like this. He knew that was stupid, and at any rate, he’d never let himself get hurt just to get attention from Tony, that was—that was pathetic, but.  But God, it felt so good.  “Thanks,” he managed after they melted and he swallowed the water.  His eyes felt so heavy when he blinked then open again.
“Look at these gorgeous tits,” Tony murmured, sliding down in front of Steve to his knees, guiding Steve’s face up to his shoulder, even as his hand went back to his chest, stroking and teasing.  He was there, kneeling in front of Steve, a moment later, squeezing his thumbs tight against Steve’s nipples until his breath creaked out of him on a high-pitched whine that sounded like a door hinge that needed attention.  “Shh, shh, I know, I know,” Tony said in a soothing tone, leaned in and pressed a wet, hot kiss with teeth into Steve’s neck, just beneath his jaw, never letting up the pressure against his nipples, circling his thumbs firmly, until Steve was gasping, jerking his hips, throwing his head back and squirming helplessly.  He could feel his already peaked nipples growing even harder, firmer, under the friction Tony’s thumbs provided, the friction Tony had so far only given his cock with the sole of his shoe, felt his nipples going hot, hot and flushed, even as he found himself pressing his chest up into Tony’s touch, panting, chasing the feeling, every brush of Tony’s thumbs sending referred pleasure down to his dick.  He barely noticed as his cock jerked, sending precome spattering against his inner thighs, the kind of wet and messy that usually embarrassed him, made his cheeks, his chest, his ears, his whole body, burn with humiliation.  “Look at that,” Tony said, “when you flush your areolas go
Tony huffed out a laugh.  “Yeah,” he said, giving Steve a look that seemed fond, affectionate.  He stepped forward, sat down on the side of Steve’s bed, and hesitated just a moment, then took his hand, pulled it back down to rest on his chest.  “You stay still now, all right?” he said.
Tony shivered under him; Steve could feel it, through the hand he had pressed to Tony’s chest, against his body.
“Still doin’ all right, sweet stuff?” Tony murmured, and Steve nodded, groaned, even though he could hear himself breathing heavily through his mouth, trying to catch his breath.  Tony braced Steve’s face in his hands, one against his jaw, and pressed a quick kiss to his cheekbone that had Steve catch his breath on a groan.  “Does that hurt how you were hoping?” Tony asked then, in another moment, and Steve groaned softly, again, but managed to nod.
“Flatterer,” Tony said, still with that soft smile.  He traced the shell of Steve’s ear, brushed short strands of hair back behind it.  Steve thought he probably needed a haircut, but he didn’t like cutting it when it was so cold out.  Tony always seemed to like it longer, too—he was always playing with it, and Steve liked that, no matter how hot and sticky and sweaty longer hair got under the cowl.  It was worth it to have Tony’s hands in his hair so much, petting and stroking whenever they were sitting together and his hands were idle.  Even now, it was hard to keep his eyes open rather than just melting into the wonderful feeling, how relaxing and just—how damn good it felt.
Steve was very flushed, and he smiled, ruefully, sheepishly, shaking his head, and Tony just reached down, stroked his cheek, his jaw, cupped his hand against it, figuring that, well, though he was certain Steve had always been handsome, he hadn’t been born with the extravagant beauty of the body he had now, and maybe that made him feel awkward when Tony praised it.
And then as far as he knew, he was struggling to open his eyes, which was unreasonably difficult, because his eyelids felt incredibly heavy and seemed to want to flinch closed, and his lips felt very dry and cracked and he wasn’t sure if he was bleeding anywhere but he was pretty sure he was because his leg felt all wet and he was panting, gasping for air but he couldn’t get a deep breath, and his ears were ringing.
Steve smiled, and it was gorgeous, like a sun rising over the water, bright and gilded, his tongue running along his damp, swollen bottom lip before he bit it and the smile went charmingly crooked.  That smile could power whole buildings, Tony thought loopily, if only he could find some way to harness it.  “Nope,” he said.  “See, I was expecting it this time, Stark.”
So yeah, he knew Tony had been fretting himself over Steve being reckless.  That was why it was so ironic that when it actually happened it was total chance—Steve hadn’t expected anything like that, hadn’t even been thinking about it. Maybe he should have been, but he honestly didn’t think the A.I.M. cell they were chasing had had time to set up any kind of explosives in the area—they’d chased them out of the area where they’d set up their base, hadn’t they?  That was miles away.  So when would they have done it, and why would they have done it over here?—so when he chased their attempt at a new super soldier into the abandoned building, he’d been more worried about the floor giving way under their combined weight or putting his foot through rotted floorboards than an explosion.
“Mmmph,” Tony said, and kissed at Steve’s thumbs, then leaned down, let Steve draw his face to his.  He opened his mouth, coaxed Tony’s mouth down onto his, and Tony followed his lead eagerly, and then they were kissing, Steve running his thumbs softly over Tony’s cheeks, petting his facial hair with them, stroking gently.  Tony moaned, shifted over Steve, writhing until they were pressed closer together, his hands carding through his hair, shivering and shuddering under Steve’s hands as he coaxed Tony’s tongue into his mouth, rubbed his palms up and down over Tony’s back under the blanket, over his shoulders.  Eventually, Tony pulled away, but only to press another soft, deep kiss to Steve’s lips, then another, then another, playing a teasing game where none of them were quite heated to start building to anything, but all of them smoldered with promise and the deliciousness of tasting Tony, of his breath in Steve’s mouth, the taste of him down his throat.
This one was his absolute favorite to use on Tony out of all the ones they owned—one of the few things he’d ever bought for Tony in the first place, he’d bought it for him for their third anniversary together.  He’d read somewhere that the third wedding anniversary was leather, and, well, they weren’t married, but it still seemed to fit.  It was the first time Steve had even remembered their anniversary before the day itself, and he’d wanted to make up for the last two times.  But Tony had just about everything he wanted already, Steve figured, so what could he give Tony except himself?  But they’d just started playing with Tony on the bottom for impact play, just like this, and after the first time they’d done it that way, Steve would never forget it, Tony’s face, spacey, glowing, his soft, open, crooked smile, the way he licked his bottom lip and bit at it and smiled up at Steve and said, all breathlessly rushing words, that he’d never, ever enjoyed it before like he had enjoyed that, that how had Steve even done that, how had he made it feel so good, and Steve, overcome, had just slid a hand around the back of Tony’s neck and kissed him, deep and soft and long, as feeling as he could.  So Steve had thought,
Tony rolled his eyes before turning his attention back to the cat. She had sitting on his chest now carefully sniffing the Arc Reactor seemingly intrigued. As they both watched she brought a paw out and batted carefully at the light. Tony scratched her head.
“Honestly, I’m going to need to talk with Ryan about this. We can’t have the whole department depending on that ass-”
Looking up, Tony’s eyes met Steve’s. An expression was waring on his face, the stone melting to a look Steve has seen before, the fear and helplessness that usually wasn’t allowed. It was that expression he got when he had first seen Steve’s drawings of him. The one he wore when Steve complimented him or showed him all ways that he loved him. The one that said “I don’t deserve this, I don’t deserve you, I’m not good enough or moral enough and you shouldn’t bother with me.” It was a look Steve hated, but at least he was on more familiar territory. He knew that Tony hated parts of himself, he was the most narcissistic yet self-flagellating person Steve knew. Steve was determined to show him that he loved him anyway, this seemed to be along the right lines.
“Oh no.” Tony said, his voice very firm “We need to think of something before bird-brain meets her. He will call her something like “Mrs. Fuzzy Bottom” and it will stick and then we will have a cat with a ridiculous name. He is already going to be obsessed with her because of the whole hearing thing.”
Tony had turned to look from the cat at Steve. He had that unreadable expression that Steve had seem him use during uncomfortable encounters with members of congress, and Happy Hogan when he was pissed.
And “How much do you think it will cost you each month to provide the necessary medical care and to cover the costs of feeding and caring for this pet?” Steve honestly had no idea how much it would cost. Was it okay to put down “I really don’t know but no worries cause my BF is like the third richest guy in the world”?
“You didn’t have to!” Tony was rambling now, “It’s not like I get you things that are great anyway and – oh god! Did I forget something! Is it your birthday! Wait no I know that one it’s the 4
Steve couldn’t help the soft smile that crosses his face as he takes in his boyfriend. He places the carrier carefully on a side table, his focus for a moment captured by the scene in front of him.
“When I asked you how to spell his name you said quote ‘literally the letter U Steve! No 'O' no 'Y' just 'U’.” The photo that Steve had labeled ‘U’ was a favorite and was hung next to the ones of the other bots in the workshop.
Butterfingers was trying to poke in behind U and the bot kept trying to subtly push the other one away, when suddenly there was a great crash from the work bench. Dummy was suddenly hurtling across the room, his wheel squeaking madly.
No one said anything about it after that night, when the stood around JARVIS' corpse and threw accusations and fury and he couldn't respond because JARVIS was
“A campaign for the sympathy of the public,” she says, stiffly. “That’s what I said. I know that’s what I said because I have said it so many times, Tony, the words echo in my
“I liked it better when you weren’t sleeping together,” Steve grumbles, and Sam smirks, slides a margarita across the counter to him. “You gang up on me more, now that you are.”
He wonders if Bucky remembers the burnt synagogue they found in the war. He wonders if Bucky remembers the bodies they found thrown by a set of tracks, women stripped naked and bloated in the sun and they could still see the bones pressed against their skin.
Steve doesn't look at him. Because Sam--Sam had always wanted to tell Tony the truth about his parents. Had said it wasn't right, to use his money and his tech and not tell him the most basic truth about what they were looking for.
“The New Avengers have kept a low profile,” Pepper says, and it’s almost apologetic, a glance at Rhodey to soften the blow. “Spider-man’s been busy with New York and Hope is doing what she can in California but for the most part—the team you’ve built hasn’t done anything that the public can rally around.”
“Hey, Steve,” he says, and Steve looks at him over the top of his paper because he’s a fucking luddite and still reads a paper, just to fuck with Tony.
Steve figures he’s been stateside a month, been out in the world for a week--it’s past time for things to go tits up.
Well, and he talked back. He did that. It was a bad habit, a loose sharp tongue, always poking at Howard.
Tony throws one last look at the field. It’s madness, and Bucky has vanished, along with the Knight of Stars. Thor is leading the melee, wielding that damn hammer of his while keeping his gaze fixed on the royal box.
His CO is standing over his bed, and he stares up at the man who's been a friend and superior and compatriot for years.
the Avengers, honeybear. They do good work but I'm not here to clean up messes. I'm the Futurist," he says, wistful.
He doesn’t say anything, just watches quietly and Fury says, “We can still use you, still use Captain America.”
Tony nods, and turns the conversation to the mission Bucky and Sam had gone one, almost tactful in giving Sam space.
“Sweetheart,” he breathes, and Tony almost sobs, his hands scrabbling at Steve’s clothes, a whimpering little noise spilling out of his lips that Steve eventually realizes is him
streets and airports they destroyed.” She shakes her head. “They have the good will of America, because it’s hard to hate someone rescuing children, Tony.”
He was completely out of control, when Tony was kidnapped, like Tony had ever been hurt by his kidnappers, like he hadn't arranged a few of his own abductions.
"What are you saying, platypus?" Tony asks, swinging his legs down. He adores Rhodey but maybe in his boxers on his back wasn't the place for this conversation.
He doesn’t want that today. “Gonna fuck you hard, baby,” he says and Tony shivers, his head bobbing eagerly.
NIck Fury comes to the cafe. It’s a quiet afternoon, almost a month after the fire, when Steve has returned to work and Tony is tucked away in his workshop and the world doesn’t feel like it’s closing in on them both.
He looks positively delighted, and Steve grins when he follows it up with, “Come on. He’s waiting for you.”
Steve squeezes his hand, a quick quiet reassurance, and Tony leans up, and presses a kiss to the underside of his jaw.
Bucky’s quiet and she doesn’t seem to realize, just barrels on, “I know--Ducky was always obsessed with Steven. I knew and I never stopped it but--I don’t know how this happened. How that
Tony hesitates for a long moment, and then sighs, and shoves away from the desk, throwing a file onto the holo screen FRIDAY pops up in front of him.
a deep protective possessiveness that makes him and Rogers dance around each other, a little, until Rhodey presses into his space, a gun tucked under his chin and says, “He’s a child. He’s a
And then he’d slapped Steve’s rear the next day as they were suiting up, about to head out on a mission, snapped the strap of his uniform, of his shield, and Steve had flushed bright red and said, “Rumlow, not before a mission, cut it out,” and he’d just winked at him and he’d said, he’d said, “Well, what about tonight, big guy?”
So he told Steve as much.  He let his mouth ramble, brain barely engaged, something he’d always had a talent for, and honestly, in his opinion, telling Steve how gorgeous and how perfect he was was probably the best use he’d ever put it to.  He let one hand slide down to Steve’s shoulder, bracing himself against his broad, impossibly sturdy strength, and said, “Oh, God,
.  He found himself pushing his feet into the bed, lifting his hips, and Steve gave a pleased sounding noise and bobbed his head over him again.  He moved his hand away, rested it warm and impossibly broad over Tony’s thigh, started stroking the inside of it with his thumb, and something about the—the tenderness in that had Tony’s chest tight, had his eyes stinging, stupidly, all out of nowhere, his breath coming unevenly.  He closed his eyes, took a few ragged breaths.
“And I really like the curls,” Steve said, letting one twine gently around his finger, tugging on it.
Tony’s hand—the gauntlet—was on him a moment later. Holding him still?  But then both of Tony’s hands were on him, without the gauntlets this time, firmly feeling down his sides, pressing on his gut. Steve thought, with a dizzy, heady kind of flush, that Tony’s thumbs were pressing in right above his groin, even though he shouldn’t have been thinking that way at all when he knew Tony was looking for internal bleeding or obviously broken bones.  And it was—it was inappropriate, about a teammate, in the first place.  “I scanned you with the armor’s sensors,” Tony said, and Steve caught wisps of sound that time.  “No spinal injuries that I can see.  I’m sure it’s not news to you that you hit your head, huh, big fella?”
“Miss you,” Steve said.  He let himself grab at Tony’s wrist, hold him, rub gently against the bone of it.  He swallowed, made himself say it aloud.  “I—want you.”
And fuck him, if it didn’t sound good.  If it didn’t sound like exactly what he wanted right then.  Steve didn’t—hadn’t known what was wrong with him—he still didn’t.  He just knew that something had gone bright and hot all over inside him, had rushed down to his cock and made it jerk, leaking wet and hot up against his pelvis, just at the thought of being
be dealing with the New Zealand merger. Really any other year he would be fine with someone from the correct department picking the charity but noooo when it’s the animal shelters it’s up to me.”
Grinning down Steve leaned over and pecked Tony’s lips before pulling back. Tony pouted up at him reaching to pull him back down but Steve pulled away laughing “How long have you been up?”
Rhodes waved a hand through the air, a little odd with the stiffness of war-machines mental covers, "Don't worry about it Captain, he’s fine, just helping."
So, Steve didn’t want to outright ask, but he needed to find out if there was a specific (i.e. traumatic) reason Tony didn’t get himself a pet.
“I’m pretty sure of all of us Bruce is sanest, which is saying something since he turns into a giant green rage monster who likes ‘Family Guy’.”
When they first met Steve might not have thought of Tony as someone who was capable of caring for another living thing. After all the man was shit at caring for himself. But Steve now knew better. He knew that Tony always checked on his bots (and screw you if you don’t think Dummy is alive) first thing when coming back from a mission or business trip and was always checking on their programing and if they were structurally sound. Tony was always updating and caring for his creations. Fixing Dummy’s wheel that was continuously loose and giving special attention to Butterfingers joint in her right site since it seemed to bother her. He was also always checking in on the people he cared about. Calling Rhodey to “bother” him whenever it was obvious the man might have had a bad day. Even Pepper, who Tony threw all his shit at, was constantly bother by Tony to see if she was ‘okay’. The rest? Tony would ever admit it, but he mothered the Avengers, checking on their supplies, having JARVIS plan for food, making sure they all were safe and comfortable.  Tony cared about his friends and is bots always making sure that his kids were cared for before bothering to even look at himself. So why then didn’t Tony just adopt a cat?
Steve started down at him, his heart beating a bit faster than a second ago. It wasn’t often they told each other that phrase. They both had their own problems and often found themselves finding other ways to express that love. This was a moment though, this was an important moment. He opened his mouth to say… something when he was interrupted by a soft sound.
The worst that could happen was that he miscalculated seriously and Tony didn’t want a cat and Steve had just fucked up royalty. Sure, Tony would probably think it was funny but still this would just show how much Steve didn’t know his boyfriend and he did love Tony and didn’t want Tony to think he didn’t know him well. Honestly what if he thought Steve was just some idiot? He worried about that enough as it was this would just confirm-
The cat was now sitting fully on Tony, half on the Arc Reactor, happy as the proverbial clam the soft sound growing louder.
Steve opened his mouth to apologize. Damn it! This was why he shouldn’t try to get gifts! He should stick to what he knows. Drawings and Coffee beans. Fuckidy, fuck, fuck.
Tony just huffed again and gave the bot a scathing look resting his chin in Steve shoulder. Dummy, clearing not minding his creators pout, leaned into Steve.
Though, Steve supposed, the whole idea really had started a while back after a giant grasshopper had tramped through New York, he just hadn’t realized it at the time.
“Oh.” Tony said letting his head thump back down against the table. “That’s fine then, that’s-” Almost immediately Tony sat back up looking at Steve in surprise “You got me something?” He said it with such a vulnerability and caution that Steve’s heart lurched and the small vengeful side of his wanted to punch anyone who had ever made Tony look like that.
, was currently sprawled out across his “coffee table” flat on his back his hand raised above him, moving holographs around in an order that to Steve looks random but probably had some purpose. Then again Tony usually migrated to his sitting room when he had reached the “too tired to actually use a smoldering iron but brain still awake enough the need to create is taking over all other senses.” This fact was confirmed by the three coffee mugs sitting beside him.
“Oh my god.” Tony groaned, and would have surly added movement if he wasn’t worried about disturbing the cat “You are such a sap.”
“Umm” The cat jumped onto the coffee table and started batting at the blue holographs. Clearly it was unperturbed by the new location.
Steve stood up and wiped his sweating hands on his pants and followed her to a bare room with a couple cluttered cages, all empty, and a metal chair. There were various things strewn about as you would expect to find somewhere slightly underfunded, like they just didn’t have time to clean this particular room very often. Steve took this all in quickly before his eyes zeroed in on the table, or rather what was beneath the table. A cat hammock (he had seen them on the internet during his research) was strung between the legs. Taking a couple steps forward Steve knelt next to the fabric swing to face the occupant.
Steve sank onto the other end of the couch. The cat was now stretching up and sniffing at Tony’s beard. Tony’s hands hadn’t moved.
Maybe Tony didn’t like cats as much as Steve was thinking he did. Maybe it was one of those things he liked but didn’t have any interest in owning himself… but that didn’t really sound like Tony.
The team had congregated on the street while the police and medical squads surged around them. Coulson was giving directions for clean-up and, for once, all the Avengers where actually present. In fact, they were up a number since War-machine had been in New York and had joined them in squashing the threat, literally.
Pepper glanced at him as she organized the stack of papers her voice was blank: “While drunk he donated a million dollars to Spunky’s Rescue Ranch because he saw a cute photo of a cat on their Facebook page.”
“Pepper loves him though, something about charisma with the press. Really? We don’t need any more charisma, I have enough for the whole company!”
“Did you have any pets growing up?” Steve asked, trying to keep his voice casual and firmly not looking in Tony’s direction. Steve usually knew better than to ask questions about Tony’s childhood.
Not that security clearance meant shit, Rhodey had always been a damn good soldier and a much better
Steve is quiet, watching Tony pack, and then he's sliding into bed, curling up against Steve's broad warm chest and familiar arms wrap around him, holding him steady as Tony sprawls against him. "I don't have to go," he says, softly.
. Steve is arguing and he's holding Tony back, trying to stop him and it registers, distantly, that even while he's trying to stop him, Steve isn't using any force to make it stick, that Tony can brush him off like a fucking fly brushed aside.
He’d just jerked off to the delicious sight of him, and he’d talked, a steady stream of filth to the sound of Tony moaning. And when he’d finally let himself come, it was because of Tony, because of the hitching little sobs he’d been giving up and the way he’d gasped so high and startled and come, all untouched, just from Steve jacking his cock and telling him how bad he wanted to lick his pretty hole.
There are bruises on his skin, so familiar Steve almost doesn’t notice them anymore, except that he has always noticed everything about Tony, impossible to overlook, impossible to look away.
Then Tony pulls away and sniffles, stepping back out of his arms and turning. "Goodbye, Steve," he murmurs.
"So are you," Rhodey says, pointed, and that does get Tony to look up, eyes gleaming dark and exhausted. "What're you doin', man?"
It’s how he finds himself in the backseat with a recovering assassin who watches Steve and Tony with the same kind of avid hunger he knows he does, while Tony sings too loud and demands road snacks and Steve laughs and indulges him with a fond, “
“Tell me what you want,” Rogers says, finally, and some of the fear tightening his gut goes loose and he nods before he begins to speak.
There’s a long deep silence from the other bed, deeply suspicious, but that weekend--Tony cancels his trip home.
“Howard--when you were gone. He didn’t handle it the way I thought he should,” Steve says, carefully and Tony doesn’t laugh. He can see the way that Steve would handle it, smeared across his eyelids when he closes his eyes.
It isn’t that he’s in love. It’s only--he’s Tony’s best friend, and he’s never wanted it any other way. But sometimes, standing in the shadow of their love affair is a lonely sort of business.
Jarvis stares down at the sticky water blood, the way it's stained his hands red and can remember so many afternoons on his knees, cleaning up Anthony's blood. This is the first time someone hurt Howard, for daring to touch Anthony.
He still hears the low murmur of Steve’s voice through the thin bedroom wall, and the wails that Tony’s pillows don’t muffle.
Steve has always looked at him with eyes full--full of anger, full of fondness, full of exasperation, full of love.
"You aren't denying it," the queen says, suddenly. "The attempt to kill my child--you aren't denying it."
Maybe killing a man should leave a stain. Maybe the execution of a traitor should serve as a reminder to everyone who stands on those stones.
And he wears armor--thousand-dollar suits and metal suits and ridiculous sunglasses and a smirk that changes with his audience and all of it is armor, protecting him, keeping a world that has hurt him at bay.
"Why'd you quit?" Rhodey asks, and Tony looks at him, and he wants to drink, and knows, knows with a certainty born of experience, that drinking this deep in his own grief is a horrible idea.
"Hello, Mr. Stark," she says, professional and beautiful in her towering knockoff heels and just out of season business suit. "I don't have an appointment, but--I think you need to see this."
Blinks again. "Did I help Rogers bust his band of backstabbers outta your underwater pokey? Is that what you're asking?"
and if it was any more intimate, he might need to re-evaluate everything he’d been thinking, recently, everything he quit thinking, after they left the farm and Tony left the team, and Steve did.
He doesn't know if he believes that. But he thinks maybe--maybe if Nat believes it--maybe that will be enough.
Steve takes an obnoxiously large bite of his hot dog and chews as Clint's face goes pained and he opens his mouth to reply but nothing comes out. He just stays like that, mouth open and gaping and then, sighs and holds out the phone. "He wants to talk to you."
"There's been no proof of life, but--we think so. No body and not enough blood to think he's been killed."
"Will he really?" Rhodey murmurs and Tony snorts. Harley was angrier than any of the New Avengers, but he didn't need to go into that with anyone.
, of all fucking people, being thrown in his face, like Tony doesn't spend his nights and days and hours in between flirting with Pepper, and sure, it's different, they're friends and they work together, but that
himself into Steve’s arms, sobbing, and he doesn’t believe him, when he says that he’s safe, doesn’t believe him, when he says that it won’t happen again. But he clings and his eyes are wide open and staring into the light.
"Did you fuck her?" Tony asks, abruptly, the fight draining out of him. "Was it like fucking Peggy?"
He stands next to Tony near a quiet grave. Bucky and Rhodey are waiting nearby, but they’re alone, now that the priest has gone and Steve is choking on it, the grief and the guilt.
"The Avengers died," Tony says softly. "I killed them, when I left. But there is still something coming for us. Who's gonna defend us, during the next alien invasion? How are they going to, when the Accords that want to put them in a max security prison in the goddamn ocean?" He shrugs, spreads his hands. "I'm fixing the Accords because the world needs us to fix them."
It goes sideways because Tony's fists tighten when Bucky comes out of the base, blood soaked and wild-eyed, and Wanda's hands brighten with red mist magic and he doesn't know--
His smile is bright, shark sharp and challenging, and Steve wonders when the hell Tony started smiling at them with armor on, when he started protecting himself from the people he called team.
The War Dog smiles at him, all teeth and no warmth. "The king requires your presence in the throne room, my lord," Rhodes says and Stane huffs.
He thinks about everything Howard is threatening, and Tony lies sleeping in his arms, the first and only peace he's ever managed to find. Howard would destroy it. For optics, for the fucking stock prices. He'd destroy Tony, destroy this fragile fierce thing they've built, all because he's jealous and petty and *small.
"Of course he is. You think so too," Tony says, exasperated. He strips off his shirt that Clint had spilled wine on and says. "Stane is just playing possum."
After that day, Howard’s funeral, when she’d slapped Tony while he changed his suit--his hands clench, remembering, the red print on his skin, the light bruise and the tender way he’d winced, when Steve kissed him.
She motions to the file. It doesn’t need explanation. Nomad and his team have done everything Tony chose not to—rescue work in the Andes’ mudslide, a battle with Doom over a small stadium of people, clearing a beach in Thailand when Namor got a little feisty. They even worked with Johnny fucking Storm, and Tony wasn’t sure what that said about his tentative alliance with the Fantastic Four.
He doesn’t pay any attention at all, until Bucky hisses in pain, and his head whips around to find a kid poking at the still healing stump.
He listens to them, to the dirty teasing on the phone and Tony’s pretty groans as he gets himself off. He listens when Rogers visits, and curls around Tony in his twin bed, the wet kisses loud in the silence, the sound of Steve’s mouth on Tony’s cock impossible to ignore.
"You said there were two things," Tony says, and it jerks Steve out of his thoughts. "I know about Barnes. What's the other?"
"The Rift War kept the Howlers busy--the kingdoms, really. I saved the Wakandan king, during it, and he welcomed me and my pack into his kingdom. They reforged my armor," he adds, and Tony's gaze snaps down, to that strange armor that's familiar and not, and he realizes abruptly
There's a mugging a week after that, and he runs into the little blonde girl outside his favorite café, looking shifty and then
The last bit is just loud enough for Mama to hear, and she sits back, color bright in her cheeks, and Tony smiles, smug. He chances a glance at Steve, but he’s smiling, amused and pleased if the way his gaze flicks to Tony’s mouth is any indication.
It's been three days and the team is finally beginning to believe that they're safe, that they can breathe in the warm air of Wakanda and not worry about being thrown back into the Raft.
"Well,  yeah, of course it did. Pepper and Rhodey are his captains, though, and if they couldn't get anything else outta him, what the hell do you think he's gonna tell me? He sure as hell wasn't gonna stop the engagement because I said it smelled hinky."
She blinks at him, sphinx like and unreadable, and he hates when she blocks herself away like that. "Do you think he doesn't?" she asks, instead of answering, and he doesn't answer. He isn't sure how to answer, so he doesn't say anything.
Not until Tony's gaze lifts, lazily, from the princess, and he sets her on her feet, pats her shoulder and she hops down to the strange knight as Anthony straightens.
Bucky lives here. He isn’t one of the Rogues, doesn’t fight--hasn’t since he woke up free of the triggers in his head and down a metal arm and Shuri asked him what he wanted.
He doesn't remember going down. He remembers the IUD's going off and the world going up in flames and chaos, can remember the gun in his hand and the blood and screams.
"Why do you think it's thirty-six hours? Blowing a Jericho and making nice with the brass only takes about an hour."
Steve blinks. The mugger jogs down into the alley and Steve watches, bemused and a little bit baffled as the man throws himself into a dumpster, cursing all the while.
"You and Pepper have been planning on this art opening for months, beloved. Stay here. I'll be home in thirty-six hours."
“You’re boy is a lot,” Rhodey says, mildly and Tony tenses. Because Rhodey has never liked any of the many people Tony’s dated, never made any secret of his dislike of them, and it never bothered Tony, because Rhodey
Tony nods, and kisses him, carefully, presses everything he can't say into that kiss and Steve kisses back, hard and hungry and desperate.
His shoulders are hunched and he is naked and hard and littered with bruises, each of them from Steve’s worshipful hands and hungry mouth, and he looks--
It takes years, adjusting and manipulating and building, but Tony puts a suit of armor around the world, a protective field against any mad Titans wandering with genocide on their minds.
Steve catches her eyes, bright and warm and Bucky, relaxed and solid at his side, and Tony's almost offended, hesitant smile, and he takes a breath.
Thaddeus Ross is there, against a backdrop of the Accords seal, and it makes Steve's stomach turn, as Bucky flanks him, and they listen.
"Ana," she says, and her voice doesn't tremble, even if her fingers do. She clenches them in her skirt, and licks her lips again. Wonders what Captain Rogers will do next, and heat blooms low and burning in her belly. "Ana, I think another sherry, please?"
"Not everything has to be hard, sweetheart," Steve points out, and Tony nods. Steve hits a particularly tense muscle and he groans, his head dropping down to hang loose and floppy.
Jarvis, she learns, is Tony's. He leaves her there, in her beautiful lonely villa and returns home with her son.
,” he snapped and Steve laughed, mean and quiet, too aware of Peggy asleep on the other side of the house.
because of that. They knew Stane was crooked, but this--this is exactly what Tony has been waiting for.
Steve gives him a disapproving look and Tony smirks. Squirms a little, up and into his lap. “It’s not our job.”
"Broken jaw, shattered orbital bone, a broken nose. He's got a minor skull fracture," the doctor reports, and Howard would
snarls, and swings, and it's only Bucky's darting hand that keeps the punch from connecting with Tony's face, and he thinks
When he’d pulled away, Tony blinked at him, dazed and panting, lips swollen and a hint of lipstick smeared on his mouth.
Tony doesn't like early mornings, and Steve slips out when he still sleeps, more often than he doesn't. But sometimes. When he's stayed up all night in his workshop. When he surprises Morgan with breakfast. When Dumee begs for a walk while the sun is still rising, he'll wander past the training fields, where the Keep's guards and the queensguard train, and he'll hear it.
His father is a shock of cold water, an icy slap to the face as he’s nudged aside while Howard enters the apartment.
He’s freer in the quiet moments too, dropping absent-minded kisses against Tony’s hair while he reads, playing with Tony’s fingers while they eat, rubbing his feet when they’re watching the news.
“Gonna wanna be real careful there, Tones. He’s real possessive, that one. And I don’t think he’s gonna like it too much, when he finds out what Howard is.”
"The shield shattered. And an Ironborn--one of Lord Stone's bannermen--stabbed me with his lance. Almost disemboweled me. Stripped me of my armor. Some of the Howlers found me, while he was still at it, and they fought him off. Dragged me back to their camp." Steve shrugs. "Jones got my armor back and I--I stayed with them. After I was healthy. I heard the news, that the Pursestrings had declared me dead. It was safer to be dead."
?" he asks, and he's naked and vulnerable and this questions matters, more than any he's ever asked.
Steve stares at him, and sometimes--moments like now--he can see every version of Tony that he’s ever loved--the man on a helicarrier, the hero dying, the child who clung to him, the beautiful brat who took a ring on faith, the man he married.
explained it,” she says. “I explained when it began two years ago, and I explained it a year ago and six months and every month since then and frankly, you
Sam is watching him, and he thinks of lies, lies layered on lies, truths tucked away and hidden, and how much damage that did.
The blow comes out nowhere, an open-handed slap that catches his ear and the side of his face, and his ears are ringing as he stumbles, careens off balance into a chair.
She gives him an unimpressed grimace and Steve raps his knuckles against the table. "Tony being here or not doesn't change the fact that we have a job to do," he says, sharply and he can feel them watching him.
"Was it worth it?" Natasha says. It cuts through the room, cuts through the tension, and levels Tony.
Tony is younger than him, wide-eyed and tiny next to a stack of boxes and watching him, Jim feels a hot flare of worry.
He won’t fuck him. “Not until you’re legal,” he murmurs against Tony’s lips as he holds sixteen year old hips, skinny and sweet, still and jerks him, rough and deep.
he doesn't recognize as a warning, and he looks at it, the briefing he doesn't have the security clearance for because he's a civilian now, and not under contract with SHIELD or the DOD or any of the other alphabet agencies.
. He trusted Tony and walked right into hell with him, dammed them both to lies and loneliness, to years spent apart and distrust--
It was enough. Being the family he’d never had enough of. It wasn’t what Steve wanted, but he didn’t
But as the days slip by and Ty goes from missing to presumed dead--no one else comes looking for him at their door.
He pressed and pressed, and he pressed against glass, and every single time Steve smiled at him and didn't speak, every time they fucked and didn't talk, every time Natasha stopped talking when Tony entered the room--it all shattered hairline fractures in glass that he could see, because he was pressed against it desperate to get on the other side.
No. That’s not true. He loves Tony, more than he’s loved anyone or anything, a kind of helpless adoration for the tiny, larger than life chaotic disaster. He loves Tony
Pepper breathes a laugh, and stands. Tugs him toward her suite and he follows her, to the familiar comfort of her rooms, where they have always been a family. She closes the door after them and says, softly agreeing. "Tomorrow."
It’s a habitual protest, though and Tony knows it, one hand down his tiny shorts, fisting his cock as he shifts in his seat.
"He's been off," Natasha says softly. She’s watching Steve and her gaze is softer than it should be, and intent. "Since Ultron, Tony's been--not quite right."
Tony is sobbing. He's pressing back weakly, and there's tears on his cheeks, pretty and Steve catches him by the throat as he slides in, tips his head back and fucks his tongue into Tony's mouth as he fucks into his body.
"Ross," Rhodey says. "From start to finish, this has been clean and fast and impeccably timed--it's the kind of coup that you and Pepper executed when you cleaned Stane's people out of the board."
"It was good to see you, Cap," he says, and slides into the Audi. Steve watches him the entire time he drives away.
Tony nods, a jerky thing, and turns. Pepper is waiting, pale and so tense it’s almost painful to look at her, Morgan cradled in her arms.
there’s something between them, something building that’s been there for so long he can’t remember when it wasn’t.
--through the pain and tries to get a handle on when the fuck his life spoun so completely out his control.
So he carries it, a  kernel of knowledge that festers and takes root, as the weeks spin on and Steve makes his morning vow and holds him careful in the dark and he wakes trembling, a scream trapped in his throat.
. He expected it, really, but the way that hostility bubbles up as he steps into the room makes him want to falter, want to turn and wait.
People talk, and occasionally something makes that talk spike up sharp--but for the most part, no one is stupid enough to bother them.
"I asked that," the king says, and the smile he gives Obie then is bitter and coldly furious and ghastly. "I would have waged a war, if I thought it would avenge Steve, when he died. But for my daughter? Killed by my own allies in my palace? I would burn them to the ground, reduce their kingdoms to ash. I would reopen the weapons pits to slaughter her killers. And you know it."
and maybe he isn’t, and maybe you would never hurt him. But if you ever do, you’ll never see the inside of a jail--I’ll make sure your dead before you have a chance.
“Not much? Father was pushing for me to marry. Removing Steve from the Keep was supposed to make me focus on that princely duty. Why?”
Steve seals the deal when he fucks Tony against the floor to ceiling windows, the ones too high for anyone to see them, with the city sprawled out at Tony's feet while Steve sucks bruises into his neck and fucks him with an aching slowness that makes Tony sob and writhe on his cock, desperate for more before Steve's big hands clamp down on his hips, holding him still, forcing him to take exactly what Steve will give him.
She kisses him, a benediction, and he holds her tight. "Tomorrow?" he asks, and it's a plea, a question he can't quite voice.
The fight is brutal, and there's a moment, when Barnes takes his gun from him, that he feels blood stopping fear, heart-weakening regret, before it registers, that his tech did it's job, that he's breathing.
Tony's face does something, then, something complicated and displeased, before he tucks it away and breezes through the weapons specs, and in just a few minutes, he's being dismissed, and DUM-E is tugging him away as Tony slides his welding goggles on and it feels
They aren't together, not anymore. He needs to remember that--it's not like Tony has forgotten, not with the way he's filling his bed with pretty models.
Maria calls when the news about the fire breaks, and when Tony refuses her calls, she comes to the apartment, slim and lovely in a floral sundress and wide brimmed hat, her eyes catching hungry on Steve before they flick to Tony.
He thinks of the burnt villa and Ty, and shivers, just a little, desperate suddenly for Steve’s touch. “Why are you here?”
“I want this to end,” Howard says, softly. “You’ve had your fun, you destroyed something I love, now it’s time to stop this. Come back to SI, let him go, and when it’s time, marry the Fujikawa girl.
She can see it, if she closes her eyes. The way Howard had wheezed, and the meaty noise of Captain Roger's fists hitting his face, the furious shouting from Stane doing nothing to drown it out, and his scrabbling hands doing nothing to slow Rogers down.
Tony--Tony is a small shadow slipping into the room behind their foster mom, and Steve doesn’t really pay any attention to him as Peggy hands him a greasy paper sack, and he gives her the updates on Bucky.
Tony goes quiet, watching her, and she wipes away the tears. Her face is blotchy and red, and he loves her, fiercely, loves the way she cries with such ugly dignity, the way she has always been steady and solid for him, the way even now, she is better to him than he deserves.
he wants, everything he had, in a place so familiar that when he closes his eyes, he can almost pretend that seven years haven't passed.
But he knew that when he took the stones, he knew that the first time he fucked Peggy, and when he gave her all the information she’d need to burn HYDRA out of SHIELD.
"I did too," Tony murmurs. He steps in close, wraps his arms around Steve's neck while Steve's slip around his waist, his head tips up to reach for Tony's lips. "Never again, beloved. I promise."
His shoulders come up and his head comes up and a smile, radiant and demanding, tilts up his lips, and Jim blinks because he’s so different than the shy little thing that had just been standing there, it’s a special sort of whiplash.
He’s been hard since Tony pranced out to the car, in a tiny pair of shorts that leave his long legs bare and barely cover his ass, a too large shirt drooping off his shoulder. It’s Steve’s, a shirt Tony stole a few years ago, the night Steve jerked off while Tony whined and begged from where Steve had handcuffed him to his bed.
Tony is still on the holo. Still talking. There are files, too, cascading out, all of them neatly labelled and--
"Then it'll be a very thorough burn pile," Steve says, evenly and Sam sighs. Natasha doesn’t say anything, but a smile, small and secretive, flickers at the edge of her mouth.
He sees Barnes watching them, sees confusion and anger, and he smiles, grim and hits Steve with a blast that sends him to his knees.
He notices, of course, and his jaw clenches a little, furious because it’s so goddamn blatant, the way her fingers brush over Steve’s wrist, and her neckline dips when she leans into him, and her eyes track his ass when he rises to assist Jarvis.
"Of course I do. She's my best friend. She's my partner, and she's the finest queen the Iron Keep has ever seen." He sits up and says, carefully. "I will always love Pepper. But I am not in love with her. And she has always known that."
Still. He lives for that soft promise and the taste of Steve on his lips that lingers through the morning.
"Keep an eye on it," Tony says and Rhodey gives him an unimpressed look, like he can't believe Tony is bothering to give him directions.
“Gonna carry you inside. You can rub your little cock against me while I carry you, ride me like you like so much. Won’t matter. You come like this, I’m still gonna fuck you raw.”
“I have something, I think. I’ll dust it off,” Tony mumbles, and Rhodey laughs, like it’s a foregone conclusion, and Tony thinks--
Thor smiles, as Loki pushes him to their bed, and sprawls across it, carefree and beautiful and Loki leans down, slits the laces of his breeches with a too sharp knife, just to see Thor's eyes brighten.
It’s been seven months, since Thanos, since using that fucking gauntlet that almost killed him, that took his arm and changed his world, and didn’t change a goddamn thing, either.
He’d wrapped his hands around Tony, let his fingers brush the crease of his ass and dragged him closer, nudged his nose just a little to get the angle just so and then kissed him, slow and drugging, like he was fucking him lazy and adoring and hungry.
Tony falls asleep there, on the polished mahogany and Steve tugs his filthy shirt down to cover his cock and balls and then straightens.
Sam’s quiet, watching him with patient, wary eyes. “I think it’s time for you to think about changing it then, or moving the hell on, man.”
"I married you knowing who you belonged to, Tony. I knew what I was doing then, and I know what I'm doing now."
“Measuring,” he says, and then turns back to Bucky, hands moving and muttering constant and Steve takes a breath, to snarl or curse, or scream but Peggy’s hand is soft on his shoulder.
"It'll be good to see him," he agrees, and wriggles around until he's comfortable, sprawled on the bed like a starfish and tugging Steve down like a particularly heavy blanket.
"Of course, Mr. Secretary. Let me know if you need--" Tony says, his voice dripping sincerity and it makes Steve do a double take.
He fucks Tony until he's sobbing silently, licks the tears from his face, and, later, when he's come and he's carried Tony, dirty and dripping come, to their bed, he licks him clean.
Fury is building, impotent, in his chest, and he swallows it down, and looks at the doctor. "You need surgery, Mr. Stark."
When Tony left, he left all of them. Peggy and Bucky and Steve. Losing him broke Steve's heart--but it broke something in all of them. And for the first time--Steve thinks maybe they can get it back.
When he is spent and Steve has fussed over him, cleaned him and curled him against his broad chest, when he's fed Tony and is content to rest and close his eyes, Steve asks. "What about Pepper?"
He’s a shameless little slut, bratty and demanding and so fucking hungry for it, that sometimes even with the serum, Steve can’t keep up.
He curls around Tony in the dark and Tony drifts asleep to the sound of Steve’s breathing and his own, and wakes to the silent shaking of the bed and wet trails against his neck and hands that leave bruises in the dark, until he squirms around and holds Steve against the dark, and the restless nightmares fade in the silence of the night and Tony’s soft promise, “I’m here, sweetheart. I’m here. You’re safe.”
He smiles and he smiles and he smiles and sometimes, at gala's and charity events that don't include children dressed up like Ironman and Captain America, his smile is fake and strained and plastic, because Tony has been preforming since he was a child, has been paraded in front of the public since before he could speak and he's
It's Tony, he thinks. Tony is the reason Steve attacked him, he didn't understand the situation, and it'd been months of living together, months that Tony could pour his lies into Steve's head.
About Howard and the ultimatum, about the casual disgust he treated Tony with, about Tony curled on the ground, hands braced protectively around his head.
Steve ignores him while he works his way through his own cheeseburger, doesn’t offer to help when Tony grapples with holding it.
He nods, not bothering to vent the scream climbing his throat. Pepper sighs and hooks her hair behind her ear. “Between that and the new Accords—there isn’t a way to stop this. The public perception is there and they
Tony funnels money, to the boy in Queens, but keeps his distance. There are no children. Steve doesn’t want them. He told her, once, when Tony was six, that he wasn’t a father, and he thinks he would be--if that were what Tony wanted, he would be. But Tony is a jealous little thing, demanding and bratty even as the years stretch around them, and he’s never wanted to share Steve, not with lovers or friends or children.
That wounded exhaustion and Sam’s warning look keeps his mouth shut for a moment, but then, “Are you ok?”
“I’m gonna go down to the workshop after breakfast,” he says, and Steve smiles, slow and pleased and Tony--Tony grins back, helpless to do anything else.
“Funny thing, Stark. You came home and didn’t mention it, like you thought it was gonna go away. And these bodies turned up in a warehouse downtown.”
"FRIDAY," he says, softly. He's watching the team settle into their rooms, watching the way they move around and with each other. Familiar and comfortable. It stings, and soothes, all at once.
Steve smiles, because it’s true. “Still not letting you blow me while I’m driving, sweetheart,” he says, severely and Tony pouts.
His heart is pounding and he wants to wave it off, wants to hide from that expectant stare and the curve of his lips, and the burning itch in the back of his mind that he’s missed for
“I couldn’t save you. Not then. So I came here. To save you from everything that had ever hurt you.”
They don't talk about Bucky often--Tony is a jealous little shit and Steve is fiercely protective of his weak spots--but he knows exactly where Steve's thoughts are tugged. “I’m sorry, sweetheart,” he murmurs, and Steve presses into his chest, buries his face there and clings, the way he never does.
It’s been almost a month, when Fury arrives. It’s when Steve is at work, and Tony is elbows deep in coding. “What do you want?” Tony asks, and he’s being rude, he knows he is, but Fury has never meant anything good for him, is too close to Howard for Tony to ever feel truly comfortable with, and he’s watching Tony now, eyes narrowed and assessing, like he knows something Tony doesn’t.
Tony smiles and shrugs. “Who knows? I’ve reinvented myself a few times, Capsicle. Maybe it’s time to do it again.”
Barnes goes for his arc reactor, and Steve is too far away and too close and panic is clawing at his throat, and his parents are dead, dead,
“We’re not going to discuss them anymore. It’s over,” he says, decisively. “I don’t want to think about them. SHIELD took care of the scene and it’s over.”
is falling, and Steve is flying away with Barnes, and everything has spiraled so far out of his control, and he screams as he dives after Rhodey.
He stepped into the living quarters with Steve, relaxed and happy in a way he hadn't realized he missed, until he was here, shoulders and tie loose and Wanda Maximoff was there, watching him with big, hostile eyes from across the room, her hands tight on the counter, a sheen of red in her gaze.
Howard huffs, and Tony tenses. “You have until the first of the month, Tony. Make the right decision.”
"It's gathering steam," Rhodey says, reluctantly. "I'm keeping an eye on it, but--it could be something serious."
“Do you want me to go with you?” Tony asks, later. He’s propped against the counter in silk panties and black robe and wide worried eyes.
Obie strides through the gathered lords, the kings and their attendants from around the Six. A knight stands near the dais, in armor that he doesn't recognize, and he frowns a little.
Steve had thought he had already convinced himself this was a good idea. After all he had done all the paperwork, bought all the supplies and even done as much possible research as one could do.
His voice had the entirely worshipful tone that he often got when he was really, really sweet and under, and that Steve always put down to how Tony’s space went.  Still, something twinged in his chest again, tightened with feeling, because, well, damn, that was sweet, to think that Tony, even if it was because he was out of his head and trusting and too sweet with it not to, trusted him so much.  “That’s it, sweetheart,” he murmured.  “I’ll take good care of you.”
Finally Steve surged forward, squeezing at Tony’s cock through his garter belt, and grabbed hard onto the mirror himself, bit down on Tony’s shoulder, the meat of it, and gave a low, stuttering cry as he thrust hard between Tony’s thighs one last time and it spattered all over the front of the mirror.  Tony moaned at the sight, watching it hit the mirror and run down it, over the image of his own body, shivering under Steve’s warm strength as Steve groaned, bit and sucked at the bite on his shoulder, breath hot on his skin, still rubbing at Tony’s cock until it felt so—so hot and needy and tight and desperate, itching for something to really thrust against and aching trapped tight against his belly, and God, it was such a turn-on, the way he felt helpless and trapped and Steve’s big warm hand felt so good, and Steve was huffing and panting and whining as he thrust between Tony’s legs, riding out his orgasm, painting the mirror with his come, nuzzling and sucking at Tony’s throbbing skin where he’d bitten him like he wanted to bite a big obnoxious mark there, like his initials or something.  Tony’s hands were sweaty and trembling on the mirror and he couldn’t seem to do anything but push himself back against Steve’s slowing thrusts, riding against his cock with his thighs squeezed tight, and roll his hips forward against Steve’s warm hand where he was rubbing at him, the image of his hand rubbing under Tony’s little skirt insanely hot, insanely lewd, in the come spattering the mirror.
“I’m not so sweet,” Steve said.  “You’re the sweet one.”  Tony made a face at him, shook his head, because honestly, that was ridiculous.  “But I do want to make you feel good,” Steve added, then bent his head again, licked at Tony’s cock, licked it back into his mouth and sucked wetly, messily.
The soft glow of euphoria—of being used hard and put away wet, of Brock saying he wanted him on a—on a what, more permanent basis?  Of being
“Touch yourself,” Tony managed to moan, somehow, getting his head back up, his eyes open, curling his fingers in Steve’s hair.  “C’mon, touch yourself for me, big fella, I want you to feel good, too, want to know you’re touching yourself while you’re bringing me off . . . want to know how you’re enjoying this, that you’re enjoying this . . . .”  He really, really did.  It sure seemed like Steve was enjoying the hell out of all of it, what with the throbbing heat of his erection all huge and wet against his belly, the eager gulps and grunts and noises he was making as he sucked on Tony’s cock, but—but he just wanted to see it, to remember Steve loving this, loving sucking Tony’s cock like this, really, really enjoying it.  And he wanted to make sure things went better when he came this time—but more than anything he wanted to see Steve come.  “God, I want to watch you come,” he mumbled.  “Want to see you come for me, watch you come sucking my cock, big guy, gorgeous.”
It was good.  It was good.  He felt a little knot of tension in his belly relax, sighed and let his muscles go loose, finally let himself just feel good, just relax.  That was just perfect, then.  It had been good.
Sure there wasn’t. Steve sighed, let his head rest more solidly on Tony’s shoulder anyway.  It felt … good, to lie here like this.  They were tucked up in bed, and he was wearing a soft t-shirt, lounge pants.  Tony was dressed similarly.  Steve didn’t really remember changing his clothes or getting into bed, falling asleep, just the relief of putting his arms around Tony, resting his head on his shoulder.  He must have been really out of it.
Only the fourth thing he noticed was the fact that he recognized him.  Tony Stark.  He’d beaten Steve at U.S. Nationals earlier that year.  Come in third at Worlds and shocked everyone.  He hadn’t been supposed to make a comeback, not after—well, everything. Steve hadn’t realized he’d slowed down at first, watching him as he bent forward to shrug out of his jacket, revealing the loose red-button down shirt he was wearing—he was in his performance gear already.  His dark hair fell over his forehead.  Steve still wasn’t used to the mustache.
“Oh, God, so much,” Tony panted, and he saw Steve’s quick smile before he stroked his tongue over Tony’s cock again, the head of it, then the shaft.  They were soft little licks, then firmer, stronger, longer strokes of his tongue, then back again to soft and gentle, careful over his tip.  “So good,” Tony managed to moan.  His hands were sweating, mussing Steve’s hair, making it fuzz up around his face as he clutched at him.  “You, you can, you can, oh—oh.”  He panted, swallowed, tried to clear his head just a little, just enough to think, to talk.  “You can, uh, if you slide your tongue in against the, the slit, you know?  That’s always nice.  If you—if you want.”
“No, it’s true,” Steve said, deep and sex-rough, raspy and honest.  “Gosh, look at you, you’re so beautiful, you’re so lovely like this, Tony. You love this, don’t you?  Cock all trussed up for me, sweet and obedient and perfect, with me inside you, filling you up.  You love having your cock all locked up for me, giving me your pleasure like that, oh, sweetheart, oh, thank you.  You love it, you’re so lovely like this, so sweet.  Just look at you.”
Natasha shrugged with a laugh.  “It’s just an exhibition,” she said, but she did push off from the wall and give him a little wave before heading off again.
, darling, sweetheart, baby,” he managed to babble.  “The things you do to me—I like that, too, like to be there for you, inside you, wherever you want me, whatever you want.”  He was petting Steve’s hair with his fingertips, couldn’t seem to stop.  “Anything you want, anytime, you just have to ask.”
But he wanted to work Tony up into that slow, give him pleasure on top of pleasure, sensation on top of sensation, first.  Get him ready for it.  He wanted to make Tony feel really, really good tonight.  He always did, of course, always, but if he was going to be driving the bus in particular, it was his responsibility, and Steve wanted it to be extra, especially good.  Tony trusted him to do this.  He wasn’t going to let him down.
needs, right, princess?” Tony asked, and winked at him so obviously Steve could see it even with his dizzily pleasure-blurred vision, the way his head felt hot and full.
It was a strange sort of feeling, no direct pressure on his cock, just warmth and friction along his thighs, along the lace of his stockings, hot and humid where Steve pushed up against the crotch of his delicate panties, just tiny little jostles of his balls.  Tony could see himself in the mirror, Steve behind him, and he looked—well, he looked debauched, sweaty, with curly hair hanging over his forehead, mouth swollen and still painted red, though it was sticky and uneven now, nipples hard and plumped up, the rouged buds seeming so obvious through the babydoll every time Steve’s cock thrust between his legs and Tony swayed forward as if helpless against it.  Steve’s cock was visible between his thighs, the big blunt head dripping precome on the floor, sometimes catching the front of the tiny skirt, even as Steve’s hands pushed it up over his ass, held it hitched up around Tony’s waist, and it was strange to see no evidence of his own cock, the skirt concealing the bulge under his garter belt.  Steve’s hands looked huge on his waist, and Tony felt—felt small and delicate and vulnerable and beautifully tousled, wrecked, just there for him to use, for Steve to get off between his thighs.  Sometimes Steve would look up, stare at them both in the mirror, like he couldn’t get enough of what he was seeing, and it would always make Tony feel hot all over, down to his toes.  And then Steve slid his hand up, started rubbing under Tony’s lacy little skirt, against his garter belt, gripping and squeezing and rubbing up and down against his cock, through the girdle and Tony’s panties, making his trapped cock throb, until Tony was panting, gasping and whimpering himself, despite himself, Steve’s hand so hot through the fabric, the friction so startling and hot and bright, so that Tony found himself rolling his hips forward desperately, helplessly, feeling himself leak where his cock was held tight against his skin, somehow loving the helplessness of it as Steve pawed at him and fucked between his tight, straining thighs at the same time, so that he was very aware of the garter straps biting into his skin.
Steve moaned again at that, sounding happy, and his eyes squeezed further shut.  His hand sped on his own cock.
“Got a hard head,” Steve managed, and oh, God, was that his voice, all raspy and broken and hoarse like that, little more than a whisper? He sounded like hell.  No wonder Tony was overreacting like he was.  Like he always did, Steve admitted to himself. “I’m, ‘m gonna be fine, Iron Man. Right back to the fight.”
“Shush, martyr to the cold, the wind, and the bitter weather, no one’s impressed,” Tony said, that lovingly teasing tone in his voice that Steve knew so well.  He unscrewed the tin, got a good dollop of lotion on his fingers, and blew on it slightly, breathing on it while he met Steve’s eyes.  Warming it up.  “Now,” he said, and reached forward and took Steve’s chin in his hand, pulling him in.
Tony grinned.  “You betcha, champ,” he said.  He twisted around on Steve’s lap—also distracting, with that fine rear end of his moving and rocking all over him—and leaned forward, picked a gingerbread wreath cookie, and held it to Steve’s lips to take a bite of.
Tony smiled, and his thumb rubbed gently down along Steve’s jaw.  “Yes, you are,” he purred, and Steve felt himself flush even deeper, because it was clear that Tony had meant that as a compliment.  He looked down, feeling his face go even darker red, knowing the deepening flush was spreading all over his body.  “Aw, honey, you are,” Tony said, hands falling to Steve’s shoulders, thumbs digging in against tight muscles, warm palms smoothing out knots, hot and prickling over the stinging marks Tony had already left on Steve’s shoulders.  Steve moaned, felt his head tip forward and bob loosely on his neck, dangling between them, felt his mouth go wet and soft and felt embarrassment, self-consciousness, prickle over him again, but couldn’t stop.  “You’re so hot I don’t even know what to do with myself.”
“Okay,” Tony said, breathless and low, his hips still twitching a little, but otherwise lying there soft and obedient, arms still bound above his head, the fingers of one curling against the wrist, the cuff, of the other.
“Another day, another dollar,” Tony said, grinning, closing the tin of lotion and returning it to whatever pocket he’d been keeping it in.
He’d regretted having to answer the call from Fury, regretted it more when it was basically just answering a few questions about the missions he’d been on in the last month and a milk run mission to take Hydra tech out of the hands of a bunch of homegrown domestic terrorists who wanted to blow up the tree at Rockefeller Center.  They’d been so haphazardly set up it had felt a little like taking candy from a baby.  He hadn’t wanted to be out on Christmas Eve, hadn’t wanted to leave Tony, especially—it was only their second Christmas together as a couple, no matter how many jokes Tony made about them being like an old married couple already—but duty was duty and Tony, in between making him promise that he’d call for back up if he needed it, had assured him about a hundred times that it would be all right, that he had to work late anyway and it would make him feel less guilty about it.  Working late on Christmas Eve.  Jesus.
Steve nodded shakily.  Tony’s fingers stroked through his hair again, then gripped it firmly, pulling tight as he rocked back up to his feet, tugging Steve’s head back just a touch until he was looking dizzily up at Tony again.  Just being put in that position made heat swoop in Steve’s belly and pull tight, made his cock jerk and throb.  Tony pulled his head back a little more, braced himself with both arms on Steve’s raw, tender shoulders, sending a shivery burst of sensation all the way down Steve’s spine to his cock, making him gasp.  Tony was grinning down at him, bit his bottom lip, then licked at it in a movement that set even more heat twining in Steve’s belly, then, before Steve could even so much as think about what he might be about to do next, he slid his beautiful dress shoe—black Oxfords, calfskin leather that felt cool against Steve’s skin—up along the inside of his thigh, pressed it under Steve’s cock and tilted it up until the sole was resting against the base of him, against his balls, and Steve was panting, gasping just at the sensation, the promise in it, the heat that had prickling at the back of his neck, in his stomach, in his balls and cock themselves.  Sweat trickled down the side of his face, he could feel it, down the back of his neck.
