“Indonesia,” Peter supplied. “She was studying an ancient martial art I cannot remember the name of. About five months we were there? Can’t quite remember.”
“Nothing is wrong, Steve, except Wawa stopped stocking the right kind of pickles. It’s a personal attack, frankly.”
“Oh, you’re fucked,” Rhodey said, as soon as the elevator door closed. “You are so fucked. Unless you want to drop this celibacy nonsense, you are so metaphorically and not enjoyably fucked.”
Bucky and Steve had been best friends since elementary school, and Steve was truly thrilled to see his friend this happy. He and Sam had spent years dancing around each other, and it had been a great relief to their entire friend circle when they’d finally started dating. The idea to get married had actually been the result of Nat scolding them over being dumbasses the night before at the bar.
Before too long they were back at the shelf which had the book Tony was looking for. Just like last time Steve knew the shelves well enough to barely have to spare a glance before pulling down the needed book and holding it out for Tony to take. Tony however didn’t take the book right away. Instead he was too busy glaring at the shelf like it had personally offended him.
Looking at the contact in his phone Steve imagined what would happen if he actually did dial that number and see if the person on the other end really could provide a good time. Just the thought made more precum ooze out of the tip of Steve’s dick making the slide of his hand over his length that much smoother. Biting his lip Steve acted on his lust before he had a chance to second guess himself and change his mind to make a far more rational decision.
Today had been a day for impulsivity though and Steve decided that if he was in for a penny then he was in for a pound as well. Hitting the accept button, Steve held the phone up to his ear.
“In that case I think you owe me a drink for making me search for books that you could have found on your own and wasting time that we could have been better using to plan out a date,” Steve said with a triumphant smile.
Steve was working at the circulation desk of the library checking in books that had been left in the drop box overnight after the library had closed yesterday. It was a good job and Steve was very happy with it. He got to help people find new knowledge or a new world to explore. The library served a local college campus along with local patrons from the city. As such the library was quite large, massive square footage with three stories plus a basement full of books, and took dedication to keep nice and organized. Dedication that Steve was more than happy to give.
With that Tony turned and walked away leaving Steve with the older man muttering under his breath about the younger generation too busy messing around to actually get any work done. Steve plastered on his best customer service smile and set about helping the next patron though part of his mind stayed on Tony and the fun he’d had even with just the short interaction they’d had. He didn’t know when or if he’d see Tony again but Steve couldn’t help but hope that it wouldn’t be too long.
“Um, well, you see … The thing is the book wasn’t really lost earlier today,” Tony admitted, rubbing the back of his neck. “I might have hidden it before I came to the desk to ask for your help. I swear I wasn’t trying to mess with you though. I just thought that if you couldn’t find the book right away then you’d have to spend more time searching for it which would mean that we’d have some more time to spend together. I hadn’t known that you would get so worked up over not being able to find it. I am sorry about that.”
On the other end of the phone Tony grunted and huffed. Steve might not have been able to see him but he knew the sounds of someone coming. That was the last straw for Steve as he came over his fist and shot over his stomach with the force of his orgasm.
When Steve finished up with his current patron he looked up to invite the next one up to the desk and caught Tony’s eye from where he was waiting in line. Steve’s eyes widened in surprised pleasure before turning to give the next guest his full attention. Just because he was excited to see that Tony had come back didn’t mean that he could give any less than his best service to each patron. He wanted to make sure that people had a good experience with the library and continued to come back and use the services that the library strove to provide to the community.
Steve’s hard breathing sounded down the phone for Tony to hear, mingling together with Tony’s own. When his cock became too sensitive to keep jerking off Steve had to reluctantly admit that he had wrung every drop of pleasure that he was going to get from it right now and let it go. Now that their mutual pleasure had come to an end however, Steve wasn’t sure how to finish off the phone call. This was something that everyday Steve had no practice with and road trip Steve was coming up at a loss as well.
“There you go ... Tony,” Steve said, glancing down at the name on the library card. “Good luck with your thesis. Please let me know if there is anything else that you need from the library to help you be successful.”
That of course didn’t eliminate the fact that Tony might lose track of time and forget to turn in the book thus making it overdue and meaning Steve wouldn’t get to see him today. What had started off as some light flirting had grown into a desire to see more of Tony and to get to know him better. As the day went on and the library got busier with students coming in to cram for midterms and toddlers coming for story time, Steve wasn’t able to watch the door as diligently as he had been doing earlier in the day.
“Don’t you know it,” Tony teased back. “However would I find my way around here without you to lead the way. I might get lost and then you’d feel bad when they eventually find my body, withered away in the furthest reaches of the library when you go to reshelve your books.”
The moon was bright in the sky giving enough light for them to see well enough by so that they wouldn’t get turned around in the water and lose track of where the shoreline was. Steve’s strong hands found Tony’s hips and pulled the smaller man closer to him so that they could grind together as they floated in the water. It also meant that he could make sure that Tony’s head didn’t hit the water while they were together.
He was not an outdoors kind of man. Tony was unashamed in his preference for luxury and technology, neither of which were anywhere to be found as the six of them hiked down the trail deeper into the woods to the campsite that Steve had picked out. They had tents, sleeping bags, food, potable water, mess kits, and a small axe. Other than that they would have to make do with what they could find in the woods. This was most definitely not Tony’s scene but at the same time he wasn’t going to veto a group trip without a good reason. That didn’t mean he wasn’t above whining until Steve agreed to carry some of his gear for him though .
“Hey there hot stuff,” a husky voice replied. “Sexy voice to go with the sexy equipment you’re packing there.”
Clearing his throat to try and get his mind back on track Steve gave the man a charming smile that was maybe a bit more genuine than his normal customer service smile. “Hi there. How can I help you today?”
Tony slowly blinked at him. Then his mouth twitched at the corners and obviously keeping his laughter back, he said, “I love the enthusiastic consent, but we’re talking wants and boundaries right now. Anything that is completely off limits? Anything you particularly like?”
The doll was about twelve inches tall, and its smile was far too accurate for comfort. It wasn’t Stark’s full-on shit-eating grin but the press smile that too many people thought charming. One reporter had the gall to call it ‘still boyishly handsome’. They should see him when Steve was done with him.
It hadn’t been about ‘some bimbo.’ Daniels was about to become the chief of Hydra’s recruiting offices, and Steve’s patience had run out at the same time as Daniels was recounting the exploits of his weekend.
There was a tug at Steve’s elbow and his muscles were ready to yank free when he remembered where he was.
He didn’t care. Stevens wasn’t… Tony didn't care. He’d order everything he needed for the flat arc reactor he could wear on his body and would start assembling the tools for building his fold-out repulsor first thing the next morning.
“Oh god.” Everything was a rush, and without thinking, Steve picked Tony up and pulled the dress over his head. He could feel something ripping, but the sound didn’t carry over the noise in his ears. He threw the doll back on the pillow, and it landed ass up. Steve managed to wrap the dress haphazardly around his cock and give it three more strokes before coming. He painted white lines over Tony’s ass, back, and head which stood out as beautifully as the garter did. Panting and slowly sinking back down on his hackles, Steve was unable to take his eyes off the image, but eventually, he carefully unwrapped his dick from the dress. He probably would need to get a new one. Maybe some other outfits, too.
No Obie at least. Probably hoping that if he’s not here Tony would find it more difficult to veto any of these people. Rubbing at his face, Tony briefly entertained the idea for vetoing Rumlow off the team, but no. There were too many uncertainties in this game, and the more factors Tony was sure of, the better. Keep your enemies closer and all that.
Steve did not jump, although he hadn’t noticed Tony’s entry. He took a breath to calm his heartbeat and turned around. With the utmost control, he didn’t hide the package behind his back.
The wet trail of saliva on Steve’s cheek drew his attention only for a split second because Tony, whose eyes were glued to where their groins met, was rutting into his own hand. Then closing his eyes, he stilled and came all over Steve’s abs. He kept on fucking himself on Steve for a few thrusts, never looking up. Then he climbed off Steve and the couch entirely.
Anthony’s jaw clenched. “You ruin my business deal and still act as if I need looking after? What’s up with that? Bringing me coffee, making breakfast, asking how my day is going? Because the poor boy is so lost without you? And don’t think I haven’t seen how you look at Lowell. Do I need protection from her, too?”
Leaning on Tony’s Mitsubishi GTO was none other than Obie himself: one hand in his pocket, the other holding a cigar that he was slowly smoking. The most unnerving though, was that for once, he wasn't even trying to hide his displeasure.
Assessing the surroundings ended up being a drive around the block. “Typical high-end apartment buildings two blocks down and up. What is there to assess?” Rumlow grumbled. “If everyone’s plumbing is up to code?”
Tony laughing was something Steve hadn’t known he had missed. It hadn’t been a common occurrence in their future’s later years, but now that he’d heard it again, it was like a miracle, the sun breaking through the clouds when a thunderstorm had been rolling in just a minute ago.
“Nonsense, Tony! Can I call you Tony? You’re a smart young man and you are strong. Anyone in your shoes…”
The whole thing with Tony suddenly having a security detail — had that happened the first time around? Every day, Rumlow was on the phone with Garett, reporting back what in itself seemed to be meaningless snippets of Tony’s day, but which, when added up, would give a detailed look into his life and especially his work. As much of what was possible to find out with Tony keeping them from seeing any scrap of his actual papers or the screens he was working on. And if that all was not enough, if it weren’t for the security detail, Stane wouldn’t have managed to accost Tony as often as he had either.
He met his new martial arts trainer the next night. Tony had chosen one specializing in several different fighting styles because mixed martial arts was what Tony had preferred in his later years and would serve his purposes the best now too.
It was good that Steve had that excuse to fall back on. His eyes trailed after... Anthony. As was Steve’s job. He didn’t need to feel weird about it. This room was full of people much more dangerous than Anthony could even guess. If Steve took his task seriously, he would drag him out of here without further hesitation, but he couldn’t. Because he was ineffective, corrupted, hypocritical, a coward—
Stark scowled, and Steve already thought they were through. “Please, don’t tell me you get that excited about a new razor? No? Set of monogrammed handkerchiefs? Bookmarks?”
There was a pause. “If this is not working out, I can try and get you transferred during the next several months, but then we’ll need to be certain it will be worth it. Any idea which team or commanders could be Hydra?”
Trying to calm his breathing, Tony turned around and eyed the backseat. He pulled the hard backseat cushions apart, crawled into the trunk and felt for the emergency lever. Thankfully, the murdering morons had overlooked this safety feature and in less than two minutes, Tony was out and sprinting back towards his apartment building.
Tony pressed on the handles too hard and let go with a clang. Suppressing a cringe, Tony slowed down and started the countdown from ten.
Steve huffed out a breath, righting his pants. Tony wouldn’t see it coming. Steve hadn’t decided how to make the most of the doll and outfit yet. Actually, he hadn’t really spent any thought on how exactly this would lead to Tony being cowed.
Clint was already there, eating something that obviously contained chicken and some kind of sauce. He said that it didn’t matter what you combined as long as the nutritional values were right. Steve thought it was a lazy excuse for his weird tastes.
“You know what I want to talk to you about. I promised Director Pierce new long-range missiles two months ago, Tony.” He came closer, put his large palms on Tony’s shoulders, and shaking his head in an almost fatherly way, said, “You promised Director Pierce new long-range missiles three months ago. And yet? No missiles. Why do you think that is?” He paused, shook Tony by the shoulders and continued in a sad and disappointed tone. “You know you are letting me down, Tony. And I don’t think you want to do that, do you?”
And then it’s later, too late, and Steve’s face is determined, his muscles are straining under the stone boulder he’s supporting, the bright beam lights up the air.
Steve felt his face heating up. There was a wrong sense of familiarity. Steve was struggling to say something — anything, but was rapidly realizing that he’d lost the thread of what they were actually talking about. He was still trying to figure out what was going on when Tony grabbed the front of his shirt and with astounding force, pushed him to sit on the couch.
Of course, it had to be Stevens. Tony noted with a grimace that his subconscious had finally allowed him to use the man’s name.
Rumlow talked about security at SI headquarters, but he wasn’t very thorough. Not thorough enough, In Steve’s opinion. So he started to comment on it, but Rumlow glared, and Steve remembered that he wasn't supposed to be good at bodyguarding or strategy, so he clamped his mouth shut.
here. Surely, Rumlow wouldn’t have agreed to Lowell ruining that. And she was – what? Almost thirty. Tony was twenty-one! And he looked sixteen!
“You’re a fucking tool, a hollow copy, no sense, no clue, nice and caring, and no idea what you are doing... what that face of yours does. This is what you are useful for, nothing else. Shouldn’t expect more from you, should I?”
Steve shook himself mentally and headed back towards the apartment. Maybe he was tired enough to manage a few hours of sleep, feeling less like having to be drawn and quartered for what he’d done to Tony — Anthony. He almost wanted someone to know, wanted someone to judge him. Make him stop. Give him some way to atone for it and then never let him close to Anthony ever again.
Tony wants to push back up, to get Steve off, before his body gives out, but Steve holds his head pressed to his shoulder. “At how many was the tally this morning?”
“I don’t care why you are not sleeping, but if you sleep on the job tomorrow I’m going to kick your ass,” Rumlow greeted him from the kitchen.
His voice, already loud due to its natural booming quality, grew harsher, and a part of Tony, the younger part, withered inside. Another part, on the other hand, froze and hardened like ice spreading through his body. He wanted to lean back and punch Obie in the face, tell him to step down as the CFO, and just generally go fuck himself, but he knew what the most likely outcome to that would be. Tony would be locked out of the board of directors, and the man in front of him would remain a
Steve was startled by how bitter he sounded. “If you ask me, all it does is make you look down the barrel of bigger guns in the next conflict.”
Could he? So what if he ended up on death row for it. Aunt Peggy would listen to him. Aunt Peggy would investigate—
Tony took the condom, making no further fuss about getting it on. Steve didn’t dare to close his mouth or even pull back his tongue. When Tony was done, he positioned himself.
All the levity that had unnoticeably crept into their interaction of the last few minutes was gone. Steve took a step back and knowingly or not, Tony sat up straighter and pushed his shoulders back and out, occupying as much space as possible.
Steve had just checked all the rooms when Tony, already on his way to his bedroom said, “I’m gonna hit the sack. You can watch TV or eat or whatever.”
Back at the apartment, he went ahead and secured their way inside, glad that there was a routine to fall back to. After he checked the rooms, he came back to Tony staring Rumlow down.
“You mean she is…” Steve still thought there had to be a different explanation. Surely, this couldn’t have been
“I see agents Stevens and Rumlow are very attentive tonight.” Pierce’s tone was jovial, ready to share a joke or anecdote. His hand landed on Tony’s shoulder.
Steve rubbed a thumb over the nylon clad calve. “Sometimes you get so much more with just being able to accept things.”
There was no predefined plan for that, for Tony and him talking. How would that go? What would happen now? The fog from the earlier had been gradually dissipating, and Steve was starting to wonder whether anything he’d read into Tony’s actions during their… escapades... had been real.
Yes, Stane wanted Tony present at a meeting the next day to people he wasn’t sure he even wanted to do business with. Tony suspected that some of those people were involved in gun trafficking or would in the near future. He’d never seen those exact names in Obie’s secret ledgers, but Tony had a bad feeling about this meeting.
Tony flicked one of Steve’s nipples. “Hey, breathe. I really don’t want to have to explain to Rumlow how you got a heart attack.”
It’s only a handful of strokes before Steve comes over his hand. Parts hit Tony’s belly and his cage. He thinks he might cry.
As much as he still could. When Steve fell asleep, the hot streaks of tears on his face had run cold and mostly dried up already.
“It’s a demonstration of power,” Steve concluded. “Not functional like the lab or your workspace at the apartment.”
Steve didn’t particularly enjoy listening in when Lowell and Madden came back from their shifts, but he needed to know what was going on if he was to keep Anthony safe, as Stevens or just Steve.
As if waiting for a response or for his message to sink in he paused again, but in the end, before Tony could even get a word in, he went on.
Half an hour later, ignoring Rumlow’s protests, Tony left him outside of his private laboratory on the SI R&D floor, (Stevens was presumably with the building security) and went in. There, pushing away every distracting thought and feeling, he worked. Getting his digital designs into post-processor and checking how it interpreted his schematics was cumbersome, but still so much better than the pen and paper method he’d been forced to go back to in his last year in the future. On the other hand, it was also too easy a task. His thoughts kept running away from him, the low-level anxiety running under his skin for no obvious reason was unsettling.
On the evening itself, Lowell drove them to the venue. When she slowed to a stop in front of the mansion Anthony was invited to, Steve got out to open the door for him. Anthony stepped out into the slight drizzle that had been falling all day and closed his tuxedo jacket. He thanked Steve and, for one short moment, his eyes didn’t seem to stare into the distance but scrutinize his bodyguard for the evening.
“This is really flattering, but you know that this isn’t ‘Gone with the Wind’ moment, right? It’s the nineties.”
Anthony’s shoulders sagged a little before his gaze fell on Steve and he purposefully threw himself back into the chair. “What are you looking at?”
Vaguely, he heard her getting her radio out to tattle on him, but he was already sprinting away in the dim light of the parking levels. He ducked behind a car, waited a bit and dashed behind another. He heard Lowell running after him, but she’d taken off towards the elevators, so he waited a couple of minutes more to let her get on, before quietly jogging towards the stairs.
He got into position, bent his knees and suddenly, Tony realized that Stevens, the condescending ass, wasn’t big and slow, he was big and…
“Let me get him,” Stane said then, “and we can get you all properly acquainted, so he can do his job and you can do yours.”
Schooling his features back into their normal form, which Tony had repeatedly called his resting Cap face, Steve mentally kicked himself in the butt. Peggy was not here to do it for him after all. He would take the chance to get into Hydra if he could (and Steve could feel bad about it later), but that was what he had to do. And Anthony… of course he would not start sharing all his hopes and fears with Steve just because he’d been nice to him for two days.
Steve went straight to his room, where he put the package down on his desk and took a step back. Taking a deep breath, he forced himself to forget about the encounter. He wouldn’t let Stark ruin this. The opposite, actually. For once, Stark would be the butt of the joke.
Instead, Tony kept getting frailer. When it was just the two of them, Tony was in a wheelchair most of the time. He’d designed it himself, of course, but Steve had seen plans for it to head into production in January.
The town thought the two were brothers, because they were, and that Bucky was a writer, which he was since one of his hobbies had become writing longform fanfiction for
Instead of communicating with it, Dum-E tapped the screen several times- something Tony had taught him to access other things. And there, on the tablet, was Ana’s recipe book. Somehow, she had given it to Dum-E, and somehow he had saved it.
“I don’t need anything as badly as you need to be with Bucky,” Tony said firmly. “Pack a bag, and text me updates as you can, please.”
The five o’clock shadow that Steve could see in profile was clearly a little bit of overgrowth for a perfectly manicured beard and mustache combo. Tony’s eyes were wide and brown and his eyelashes probably could scrape the sky, and Steve was overcome with the need to know what that full mouth would look like wrapped around his cock.
Scott, one of the head nurses at St. Mary’s General, looked like he swallowed a snort as he changed out the saline bag for the IV drip.
Tony loved his job. He got to play pretend for a living, and take down bad guys in the process. Ever since he’d first learned the magic of being a different person to survive, he’d wondered what it would be like to use those powers for the good of others and not just himself. So he’d spent his 20s working on artificial augmentation software. By his 33rd birthday, he could slip a necklace on underneath any piece of clothing, and his body would appear to others however he wanted it to.
“You saved my ass tonight, Quill,” Steve said. “Thank you so much. We couldn’t afford to back out of this gig.”
For the rest of his life, Steve would never be quite sure what drove him to head to the butterfly garden the Saturday after Thanksgiving. He’d felt itchy all day - holidays where food was involved always made him feel that way. He understood proportions and that joy was important, but when you live in countries where famine was a recent past and not a topic on Twitter, food always felt a little different after.
“You’re a literal rocket scientist and you didn’t double check if my beach was free? Wait, that actually makes a lot of sense based on the other rocket scientists I know,” Tony said. “Makes total sense.”
“ICKY. ICKY food!” Tony saw Steve was over by Peter, trying to get him to stop, so he had a chance to take a bite.
His profile in the VIP section was picky and the screening questions to even be able to see his profile were not fucking around, so whenever this particular alert sounded, he made sure to swipe quickly.
The man didn’t respond at first, but there was a slight nod of his head. He didn’t stop reciting numbers, though, or moving his fingers over the cube. His breathing was ragged if he paused either and it clicked to Steve that he was probably having a panic attack. He’d seen his fair share with the younger Peace Corps volunteers who he’d supervised over the years. No matter how much you prepared for the life they’d all signed up for - the reality was overwhelming.
“It’s not public,” the man replied. “Hasn’t been in the six months I’ve lived here. If it was public before and you had dreams of matrimony on the site you first fucked each other, then a, I’m super sorry your sex life sounds awful and b, you’re shit out of luck, because now it’s private. So you can take down that pathetic looking prom photo backdrop and get off my beach.”
“Well, that’s bullshit,” Bucky replied. “If he can forgive you for the Great Cheese Incident of 2019, he can forgive you for anything.”
A flash of something positively terrifying went across Brock’s face before he rearranged back to pleasantry. “No problem, babe. Just text me when you’re done here.” He leaned down and captured Steve’s mouth in a particularly possessive kiss and then left the room.
Not only were thoughts of Brock invading his peace, but Tony was there, too. What was his deal? How could he possibly be so sure of a man he’d never met?
. They were able to stabilize you at the stadium because taping players back together with duct tape is basically Sharon’s speciality, and the only reason they didn’t transfer you to the hospital in the middle of the match was that the reporters were already circling. You have a mild concussion - your third this season, lest you forget - a shattered knee cap, and some bruising around your groin that I don’t love both as a doctor and the man who likes to get my mouth on you as often as possible.”
Steve the Peace Corps hero who was practically ungoogleable because there were so many fucking Steves in Brooklyn, and even Tony’s flexible morals stopped at hacking Peace Corps records to track down a hot man he met once.
“I read the data, Pete,” Tony said with a chuckle. “Celebrate tonight, and we’ll talk shop when your hangover wears off.”
Steve had been sure the plan would die as the hangovers started, but Sam and Bucky proved them all wrong. Steve tried to talk them out of it, but Nat reminded him that they were grown adults who had been dating for three years and probably were ready to get married anyway. She was just the straw that broke the camel’s back.
In the sunshine, Tony looked stunning. His smile was wide, his goatee well trimmed, and he was in clean clothes for the first time in weeks. Steve figured it was all for the man in uniform climbing out of the helicopter and wasn’t quite sure what to do with the feeling in his chest.
“He explicitly asked us not to tell you, which is why JARVIS cannot overwrite his commands. I, however, stopped listening to him years ago,” Pepper said with a sad chuckle. “Tony is currently here in his penthouse in Manhattan and is in a coma. The reason he hired you was that he was poisoned on a work trip about eight months ago with an element called palladium.”
“I’ve always loved the idea of the Peace Corps,” Tony said, “and you are exactly who I always thought would volunteer for them. Listen, I’m a pretty big nerd and I’d love to hear all about water, but I have a thing to go to soon that requires me to be not in pajamas. If you’re up for it, just call Stark Imagineering and ask for Jarvis, and maybe I can hear more when I don’t feel like I’ve been run over by seven Formula 1 cars?”
“Natasha, I am the cellist for hire, and he’s the lead producer. It’s not like we have a lot in common.”
WE MADE IT! Lord above, thank you for your patience on this thing. I have no idea why it kicked my ass so much, but here it is, a testament to my incredible writer's block of 2021.
“Yes sir, Mr. Rogers,” Happy replied, and Steve let out a chuckle. They settled into small talk for the remainder of the drive.
Peter blushed. “Well, Miss Potts said that with the early market tests looking the way they were, it would be a good idea to make a bit of a splash.”
Which is how Steve found himself trying to secure a particleboard arch in the sand. He’d just gotten it fairly secure when a voice called out to them.
There was a kerfuffle in the tech world when it was revealed he was running the company from a small town in the mountains of Maryland, but then Musk did something stupid, and Tony’s eccentricities were back to being history.
“You don’t have to say anything, okay, but I’m gonna sit here with you until you can breathe a bit better, okay? I’ll tell you some stories, you can just focus on my voice, it helps, I promise.”
“Right, stacked blonde guy with a beard. Good thing we’re in Brooklyn and that narrows things down.”
Steve nodded, a little speechless, and watched Tony walk off towards one of the side streets. Stark Imagineering? What was that? And who was Jarvis?
“He probably has one,” Sarah commented casually. “He wears a lot of weird clothes I can’t imagine anyone manufacturing for anyone else. Except for when he’s in three-piece suits. Then he’s just yummy.”
Tony held out his hand, and Steve moved to take it. He sat next to Tony on the bed. Steve had always loved the way that Tony felt solid in contrast to how light Steve often felt. His own body often felt a breath away from disintegrating - his doctors said he was alive mostly due to sheer spite. When people described Steve, they used words like ‘slight’ and ‘delicate’ and Steve hated both of them. With Tony, however, they’d shifted to ‘cherished’ and ‘safe’.
Thank you to everyone who is excited about this! I wasn't sure if it was fun at all, and your words have given me the motivation to keep banging it out. Thanks for your kindnesses.
The man was close enough now for Steve to see that his eyes were bloodshot and his skin ashen. Either the man was really hungover or he was actually dying, and the stench of whiskey that emanated from him spoke to the former.
“Handsome and smart,” the man said. Without taking his eyes off of Steve, the man spoke. “Tell you what, Tall, Blonde, and Yummy here agrees to do me a favor and you can have the beach for the afternoon.”
“I’m an inventor and I work with large scale motors and other heavy objects. I’m also currently having a minor health issue that means I can’t lift what I used to. I need muscle, your friend needs my beach,” the man said. “Seems like you could help make this work.”
“I’m going to transfer you to Ms. Potts,” JARVIS said, and soon Steve’s ears were full of AC/DC’s “Back in Black” on violin.
“Lang, are you done?” Tony said, quietly but with a tenor of a growl that Steve was sure Scott didn’t miss.
Tony had always adored dick in his ass - knotted or not. Toys were fine, fingers were acceptable, but solid, pulsating, engorged cock? Second. To. None.
He knew he could search when he was out of the house, but he hit the firewalls on the oddest things - the word “elemental” was blocked, but Tony’s name wasn’t. He couldn’t find a recipe for chilli con carne, but he could learn everything he could ever want to know about baked chicken. The blocks were random - to Steve anyway - and only made him want to find more to see if he could discern a pattern. The only one he’d discovered so far was that anything to do with cardiac health was off limits - and combined with some of Tony’s physical symptoms, Steve had guessed something was wrong with his heart. What it was, though, was still a mystery.
“Fuck it,” he muttered. He tossed back his drink, placed the empty glass on the railing in front of him and headed towards the quartet.
“Today, sure,” Rhodey conceded. “And I’d love to pretend that’s for me, but I think we both know it wasn’t.”
Steve shook his head. “No, I’m actually working down here for the season. I live in Brooklyn, but I’m trying to get different landscapes to inspire me. Came down, found a job that lets me do that, and now I’m here.”
“Buck’s unconscious, coma, I think, I don’t…. I don’t know, but I have to get to the hospital, I have to…”
“All of them?” Steve said with a chuckle. “Can’t say I’m an Ayn Rand fan. But I think I liked Claude the best.”
As far as Steve knew, the only place he’d ever see Tony again would be on magazine covers or on news clips in taxi cabs. He was, therefore, completely shocked when a package arrived at his studio two weeks later with a key card to the Four Seasons in the Financial District and a note saying Tony couldn’t get him out of his mind.
“I need at least three more orgasms before we open that Pandora’s Box,” Tony breathed. “You up for the task, soldier?”
“I think it’s actually pain I’m passing out from, schnookums,” Steve retorted through gritted teeth.
“And you haven’t heard from him since you got here?” Brock asked, for easily the seventh time that day.
“Then you’ve had four hundred opportunities to pull the pole out of your ass,” Bucky replied. “Now, help me set up the chuppah.”
“So, confession, years in East Africa have made me a real coffee snob,” Steve said. “Can we head to Bedford and Park? There’s a
Tony was quiet for a few beats. “Well, that you were a dickhead out of deep love for the kid helps smooth the way a little.”
“Oh fuck,” Bucky said. He put down his beer bottle and went back to marinating the chicken. “You’ve fallen for him.”
Steve’s palms were sweaty as the doorbell sounded. He’d been directed to a suite at the Four Seasons in the Financial District - one that conveniently could have meetings of any fashion, and not just naked ones. The app response told him to wear anything he wanted, and to feel free to order food to be sent to the room if he wanted to talk over snacks before the main event.
“Better than the smells you get around here,” Dr. Cho quipped. “Glad you were in a more pleasant place while your body did all the hard work. We’re at 70%. Where is Ms. Potts?”
“Why’d ya do it?” Bucky asked quietly, about three hours later. They’d closed up the coffee shop and retired upstairs to Nat’s apartment.
Sarah’s sons were with their Uncle Sam down in Louisiana for a few weeks - some sort of learning exchange program or something - and Sarah and Bucky had been taking full advantage of a child-free home. Not a Steve-free one, however, and the pair would. not. stop. fucking.
Tony sipped his coffee. “Because it has the best Yelp score in the borough for egg white omelettes at a budget price.”
Steve never knew what to say when he heard about the death of other fathers. His father’s death was a relief at the time and an unhealed wound since. If other people missed their dads immediately, he was always unsure of what to do with his words or his emotions.
“What do you - ohhhhhh,” Steve said into a moan, as Tony began to suck and nibble a bruise into Steve’s clavicle.
“You’re not ethically or legally allowed to treat me,” Steve replied, “and maybe our relationship is clouding your judgement.”
“Rumlow was going for Thor’s head,” Steve said. “I could see it; the way his body was positioned, I could see it play out. I had to stop it.”
Something in the air shifted, and Steve looked at Tony. Any remaining color Tony had in his face had drained. “That’s a very unusual name.”
“I know him,” Tony said. “I’ve known him for years, and you need to cancel your date and never see him again. He is garbage, Steve, he is human garbage, and he is using you.”
Steve had no idea where to go, but if he didn’t talk to Tony within five minutes he was going to explode. He dug out the phone he’d had shut off for days, and powered it on. As he paced the streets outside the hospital, he dialed.
“I thought you would. It’s why you’re getting our money,” Coraline smiled. She leaned forward to kiss both men on their cheeks. “Now, go give an old lady some eye candy and dance, will ya?”
“You’re fucking blind, Stark,” Bucky replied. He swallowed dramatically. “Good thing Stevie doesn’t need your eyes from what I heard last night.”
Holding back any sort of reaction, Tony took a bite of his own plate and nearly choked at the burnt taste on the chicken fingers. He was never going to doubt Steve’s poker face again. Still, the mac and cheese had to be good, right? Just as he thought that, Peter threw his plastic plate to the floor.
Steve was sure that much of his annoyance was exhaustion, but there was something niggling at him that there was info he didn’t have about this man.
Steve let out a roar that made Tony jump. “You unbelievably stubborn idiot! You pay me to lift heavy shit, and I don’t know if you noticed, but we stopped doing that a few days ago. I have been here for a month and JARVIS enlisted me to mind you around day three, so can we stop this garbage. Why don’t you want solid food?”
“I am so angry with you right now that I could turn myself inside out entirely fueled by rage,” Tony whispered, and Steve caught the catch of tears. “We
“No,” Steve said too quickly. Pining after Tony from afar was safe - he had no interest in having his fantasy burst.
“Bumper,” he said, and the robot-powered walker he’d built zipped over to his side. He gripped the rails and brought himself into an upright position and shuffled towards the door.
He’d been shocked and delighted upon his defrost to learn that same gender pairs were a thing in The Future. Nat had explained to him that there was some discrimination, sure, but overall alphas with alphas was legal and accepted.
Steve made a face. “Of course I listen. I don’t understand all the formulas, but I know that you’re trying to invent a new metal that can house energy sources that don’t contain radium. I Googled - no one’s ever done it, so I figure it’s a pretty big deal. These boxes go into storage or straight into the workshop?”
“It was a dad and a kid, a few years older than us, and you could tell the kid was the real star of the show. Anyway, that kid was Tony Stark, and he was actually on track to be the youngest astronaut NASA had ever admitted into the program when his dad died.”
They’d started dating, privately at first, before being outed by a particularly lecherous photographer about two years in. Looking back, Steve was glad those first two years were in private, because they had to work through a lot. Steve had been fine with getting spoiled when he was a booty call, but not when he was a boyfriend. He made a fine living as a graphic illustrator for Simon & Schuster, with some freelancing on the side. He appreciated that his boyfriend did not only not know the price of milk, but had
Rhodey snorted, but settled back into the bench. “Can I get some more details as to what I’m looking for?”
Oh, that was another thing - the house talked. Steve grew up in a world where he was lucky if Siri understood his accent and now he lived in a house that talked. A house he had conversations with. JARVIS knew Steve’s favorite beer, preferred La Croix flavors, and what temperature was good for washing his brushes.
Rhodey made a sound that could have been a snort - and probably was - but Tony ignored it. Rhodey was going to say whatever he wanted anyway.
Steve thought, but followed orders. They arrived at the shop, Tony slowly got out of the car - batting away Steve’s offers to go in for him - and reappeared with a small bundt cake wrapped like a gift. Tony handed it to Steve.
His finger hovered over the profile of one specific alpha for approximately the four hundredth time since he opened the app. “Tonio” was everything Steve craved in a sex partner - muscular but svelte, shorter than Steve but not by more than six inches, floppy hair he can grip onto, and an ass he could snack on. And Jesus Christmas, the photo of his knot… He was listed as clean, into alphas, omegas, or betas, and free tonight.
“I know, okay?” Steve nearly wailed. “I know. I just… Dr. Simonian is the best, and this clinical trial is so exciting. Regenerative lung tissue? I mean, Petey wouldn’t have to have a nebulizer at all. At all, guys! His life would change and…”
“You’re a genius who likes sex and makes a good living doing it, from what you’ve said,” Steve corrected.
“I’ll throw in a set of steak knives if you want,” the man said with a sparkle in his eye. Steve was strangely glad to see life in them, and wondered what it said about him that he was already attached to a man he’d met approximately four minutes previous.
Steve flipped him off with the hand that wasn’t grounded to Nat and let out a deep sigh. “I need to go home.”
“Your profit margins sucked balls when I hated you,” Nat replied, “and Steve hadn’t met Tony, so really, your life before me was terrible.”
for more on these yahoos. You can also submit prompts and cajole me into writing faster - it usually works. If you're on Discord, I'm definitely there, too, and probably hanging in the
“You picked a helluva a profession, Cap,” Tony responded. “I, on the other hand, don’t know how to not have secrets. So take it from me - we don’t need that PR nightmare quite yet. Plus, it would mean seeing my grandfather and I just never need to do that.”
Steve was an employee. Employees did not get emotionally attached to bosses. The look in Steve’s eyes, the concern in his voice, all of that had to have another explanation.
“I don’t want that for him,” Steve confessed. “The idea that he could live a life not governed by albuterol was just so intoxicating, I lost myself a little.”
“Tony?” Steve called as he entered. He’d been out for a run before the sun could scorch the earth. “JARVIS, is Tony actually here or…?”
“The children having a safe place to heal without cost to their families is enough for us,” Coraline said. “And boys?”
Harold expanded. “We build relationships alongside our donations. We waited until you’d settled down, son. Our next question, therefore, is what are you two doing next Sunday. Cora makes a roast that will make you see God.”
Standing on that beach the day he agreed to this scheme, he’d known Tony intrigued him. He was attracted to Tony - you’d have to be exclusively attracted to women and potentially completely blind to not be - but there was something else. He was both completely open at times - joy would take over his face when an experiment worked that was so pure it stole Steve’s breath, and the way his body moved whenever Rhodey visited told Steve that he was Tony’s safe person. Tony deflated around Rhodey, and it made Steve itch to be a person who would provide that for Tony as well.
The frustrating thing for Steve was that he still was a creature with instincts, and one of those instincts told him that he never wanted to knot an omega. Ever.
“Well, whatever it is, it doesn’t affect who I spend my off time with,” Steve said. “No part of my contract says you get to dictate what I do with my dick.”
The silence that followed that comment sent a chill down Steve’s spine. “Jay, I’m joking. He just seems to be there a lot.”
“Um, a hot blonde man? Beard, longish floppy hair, shoulder to waist ratio of a superhero and thighs that could -”
Steve laughed. “What did you tell me once? My heart is always in the right place, even when my brain isn’t?”
Bucky made a noncommittal noise. “You wanna shell peas or head to the grill? Staying here lets you wallow in whatever is happening in you, grilling means you’re open to the grand inquisition that is my husband.”
Once his coworker had come over to take his place, Steve once more walked out from behind the counter and led Tony through the stacks of books. It had become a familiar routine for the two of them and Steve found himself walking closer to Tony’s side than was strictly necessary but the other man didn’t seem to mind. If anything he was subtly leaning in closer into Steve’s space in return.
“Steve,” Tony gasped, tipping his head back and letting Steve nibble his way down his throat. “So good Steve. Been wanting you all night.”
Tony’s face went from nervous and concerned at the beginning of what Steve was saying to overjoyed by the end of it. A wide grin spread across his face at the librarian’s pronouncement.
“Hey, it’s fine. Really,” Tony said, doing his best to reassure Steve. He took Steve by the elbow and tried to pull him away from the shelf that was missing the book that they had come looking for. “How about you tell me about similar books and material that I could borrow for this week and maybe this one will reappear later when we least expect it.”
All together Steve was very impressed, even more so by now knowing that the man he had started to develop feelings for wasn’t actually so brainless as to not be able to figure out the Dewey Decimal System. Reaching out, he plucked the book from off the shelf where Tony had put it back after hiding it. Taking a piece of paper from his pocket he quickly scribbled down his phone number and tucked it into the book like a bookmark and shoved it into Tony’s hands.
While water was less useful as lube, it was at least enough to provide enough slick for the two of them to grind and rub up against each other. Their mouths found each other again as kisses turned from desperate to sweet to heated and longing in an almost never ending cycle. Their hands were too busy holding onto one another so that they didn’t drift apart that neither of them could get a hand between them to jerk off with. All they could do was kiss and thrust against one another.
The more Tony talked the closer Steve got to the edge. His hand was practically flying over his dick as he squeezed himself tight.
A week later Steve couldn’t stop himself from planting himself firmly at the front desk all day long and glancing up every time the front doors opened. He couldn’t fool himself into thinking he was doing this for any reason other than looking for Tony to come in return the book that he had borrowed. If Steve was pressed he’d have to admit to abusing his privileges as a librarian to look at Tony’s account to see that he hadn’t turned in the book or renewed it earlier in the week and that it was still outstanding and due back today.
“Well if there is more to learn then I’m sure you’ve already found the next book that you need for your research,” Steve suggested.
Steve couldn’t stop the big smile taking over his face as he looked up the book in the library system and wrote down the call number. Handing the paper back, Steve gave a smirk.
With great reluctance Tony took his book and headed out of the library. Flirting was fun and the connection they were building during their two walks to the bookshelves and back was nice but Tony wasn’t about to cross a line. As much as he’d like to stay and talk with Steve he couldn’t interrupt the man’s work. Tony wouldn’t like that if someone was interrupting him and he wasn’t about to do the same to someone else.
Tony shook his head rapidly for a moment before turning his attention back to Steve and taking the book in question from him. “Sorry about that. Sometimes I get lost in my own head.”
Tony helped Steve put away the rest of the books on his cart while they planned out what they would do for their first date. It would be a nice chance to get to know one another outside of the library and without having to hide books to spend time together. However that would make for a good story years down the road at their wedding about how they got together.
Before Steve could respond in either the positive or negative Tony hung up the phone and the call ended. Steve supposed that it was for the best. This way the offer was out there without either of them having made any promises that might not be kept.
Half an hour later Steve’s day was made significantly better when Tony did appear at the desk holding out his book for Steve to check back in. Steve found himself at the front of the circulation desk so fast when he saw Tony that he wasn’t completely certain he hadn’t teleported across the distance.
Steve’s lips quirked up in amusement though his brow was still furrowed in concentration. “The book should be right here,” Steve said pointing to the spot in question between two other books. “It should be right here but it’s not and I don’t know why.”
Tony smiled wide and leaned his hip against the desk. “And who is the cute librarian that I should ask for help from? I’m afraid I didn’t manage to catch your name.”
As they walked between the bookshelves Steve couldn’t help but wonder how a man that claimed to be working on a thesis paper couldn’t manage to find a single book in a library with a call number written down for him. It would probably be rude for him to actually say that to Tony though and he had said that he didn’t judge people for needing help finding a book so that would make it even more rude to say something. Choosing instead to focus on the positives of finding new knowledge, Steve asked Tony about what he was working on.
Steve frowned but did tip his head in acknowledgement. While he did want answers, he truly hadn’t meant to frighten that other man.
Luckily Tony seemed to know what to say and took the lead. “I enjoyed that. Hopefully it was the good time that the bathroom wall promised.”
The next time Steve’s phone lit up it wasn’t with a text message. Instead it was an incoming call from the man he had been sexting. That acted as a bit of cold water to his erection. It was one thing to text a man he didn’t know pictures of his dick to get off to but quite another to actually talk to him.
Steve brought his fist to the head of his cock and rubbed his thumb just under the tip where the piercing was on the other man. A moan rumbled from his chest at the new spike of pleasure. Steve couldn’t imagine having a needle anywhere near his own cock but if the piercing felt anywhere near as good as playing with the same area with his fingers then he could see why someone else would go for it.
As they made their way through the maze of shelves Steve didn’t even have to look as he drew to a stop and easily plucked the book in question off the shelf with barely a glance and handed it over to the man. The man took it and smiled though without looking at the book in his hands.
Using their previously discarded clothes as makeshift towels the two of them dried off enough that they wouldn’t soak their sleeping bags before crawling into their shared tent and laying down right in each others’ space. They needed to sleep if they planned on being rested enough for tomorrow’s hike but that didn’t mean they couldn’t spend the night curled around each other. After all, the trip was meant to be a bonding activity.
As he got back on his bike Steve thought about what kind of person would end up with their number on a bathroom stall in the middle of nowhere. Was it someone local to the area that used that rest stop frequently? Was it someone like him that had just been passing through and was now states away from this little no name place? Was the name put there as a deliberate and thought out choice or was it just as spur of the moment as Steve copying it down had been?
Steve felt like there was more to it but didn’t want to push. Tony hadn’t done anything wrong and didn’t owe him any explanation to the thoughts that went through his head. Instead they just walked back to the circulation desk together, continuing to chat about AIs and the possible uses that the world could have for them if they were ever fully realized.
A loud moan echoed over the phone for a long minute. “Fuck, oh fuck Steve. Yeah, fuck me open on your cock. Need to feel you splitting me open. Need to feel every inch of that monster inside me.”
“Oh no, you’re totally going into my contact list as Hot Cock. It’s a done deal. Your name is just so I know what to shout out when I finish,” Tony said back with an air of confidence that Steve knew he had no chance of talking him out of it.
The hike was long though not particularly hard. Not all of them could boast the stamina of a super soldier or alien prince. By the time they reached the planned campsite they were all sweaty and ready for a rest. The spot that Steve had picked was fairly flat and shaded with a decent sized pond just to the side making the perfect spot to spend the night. They each separated into their own tasks to get everything set up.
The handwriting was messy in a rushed sort of way that could be elegant if the writer just spent a little more time instead of hurrying to jot everything down all at once. Either way, it was still legible and Steve, having read worse, was able to search for the book on the computer.
He might have copied down the number because life itself had gotten more than a little boring at this point. Day in and day out, nothing ever really changed. He got up, went to work, came home, went to bed, and started it all over again the next day. Everything was predictable and while that may have been by Steve’s own creation, even he was getting tired of it. That was why he had taken time off of work and gone off on a completely unplanned and impromptu road trip across the country. There were no designated stops to make and nowhere that he needed to be by a certain time. The destination didn’t matter in the slightest. It was all about the journey and getting out of the rut that he had found himself in.
Snapping a picture of his hard and leaking dick, Steve typed out a message to go along with the picture.
His hand was practically flying across his dick as his mind supplied his with image after image of what could happen. It was almost a complete shock to Steve when his phone pinged with an incoming text. Steve’s hand froze on his dick as his other thumbed open the messenger to read what had been sent to him, not sure what to expect.
Steve groaned and had to squeeze at the base of his dick to keep from shooting off right then and there reading those words. It was everything that he could have possibly wanted when he sent that text and everything that he was just as certain that he wouldn’t have received. He knew, deep down, just how creepy his text could and should have come across and yet somehow this Tony on the other end was responding in kind back to him. It was like a wet dream come true.
Across the fire Tony caught Steve’s eyes and smirked as he bit into his sandwich. An eyebrow wiggle from Tony had Steve shaking his head in amusement and the other Avengers trying not to laugh at the genius’s antics. They couldn’t practically live in each other’s pockets and not pick up on when two of them were getting frisky with one another. Reactions ranged from outright ignoring anything was going on to teasing the pair mercilessly but so long as everyone involved was enjoying themselves, none of them had any issue with it happening. In fact most of the time the remaining team would find excuses to leave those involved to their privacy for a time.
Coming out from around the side of the desk Steve started leading the man through the library to the shelf where the book he was looking for would be found. As they walked Steve thought about if he wanted to encourage the man’s flirting or not. It had been a while since he’d met anyone new that showed any interest in him after they knew about his work in a library. Sure he had gotten more than a few looks while outside the library given his broad shoulders and large muscles but once they found out that he was in reality a fairly quiet bookworm their interest died off almost immediately. This guy knew where he worked and could reasonably assume that Steve enjoyed reading and still flirted with him.
Steve used a finger to scroll over the books on the shelf to check and see if someone had perhaps looked at the book earlier and just put it back in the wrong place. When that didn’t turn up anything Steve turned his attention to the shelves above and below the one that the book was supposed to be on. The computer had definitely said that the book was in the library and while it was possible that another patron was currently reading it somewhere, given the obscure nature of the contents Steve did think that it was unlikely which meant that it should be here.
Once he had control of himself again and was confident that he wasn’t about to end the night just as it was starting to get good, Steve went back to stroking himself light and slow. He wanted to know what this Tony had up his sleeves that made him such a good time. The picture that he got back a minute later threatened to end the night for Steve all over again.
By the time everything was set up and they had a fire crackling merrily in the shallow pit that had been dug, they were all more than ready to clean the day off of themselves and settle down for a nice dinner. The pond proved a huge help as they each used the cool water to wash away the worst of the sweat until they felt at least halfway to normal. The battles that they fought on a regular basis had made them each immune to the worst grime that could cling to them. Washing was quickly followed by some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. While not the most elaborate dinner they’d ever had together, it was all stuff that didn’t need to be kept refrigerated as they camped.
“Okay, I called him a privileged asshat who was willing to let his son miss out on freedom because of his own fear.”
After dinner, that’s when he cried in his husband’s arms, finally exorcising an age-old grief that he hadn’t let himself feel before. Then, having released some of the pent up emotion, he could focus so he looked through the recipe book to figure out how to make the mac and cheese.
He wasn’t actually that upset about messing up the chicken fingers, but he was quietly devastated that his memory of Ana’s recipe hadn’t proven up to the task. Soon, he would be ready to rejoin his husband and son to eat. He knew Steve would keep Peter from talking about his food disaster, and would hug him without saying a word until Tony’s own first joke showed the memory no longer stung too harshly. But for now, he needed to see Dum-E, the only one of his bots that Ana had met.
Today’s menu was going to be toddler-friendly. Macaroni and cheese, Ana’s recipe. Done from memory as he never got the recipes from her when he had the chance, but his memory was good, and he was sure he remembered everything. In addition, he had found a recipe online for panko-breaded chicken fingers. This was going to be perfect, and the beginning of something for him and Peter.
“That ship sailed in ‘98,” Steve replied, as was also tradition, as he headed out the door and down the stairs from their 5th floor walk-up.
“I know,” Tony said firmly. “It was the last time, I swear. I remember nothing from about midnight to dawn. I woke up in a pile of bodies I didn’t recognize, rushed to throw up, stole clothes from a drawer and shoes from a pile, got the fuck out of there. I wandered for blocks, ended up at this diner where I got a rubix cube from the claw machine by the door. I ate an omelette, drank a pot of coffee, and then walked outside fully expecting to call the car service.” He took another sip of his coffee and continued.
And so it went for a few more weeks. July ticked into August, and Steve’s contract was nearly at an end. He knew he was completely in love with Tony, and if Tony would give him the time of day, he’d forget Brock Rumlow existed so fast it would seem like an Eternal Sunshine brain erase.
“You didn’t have to lay it on so thick,” she said with a laugh. “You were about two breaths from the Oliver Twist routine. Just be yourselves.”
“Oh thank fuck,” Tony said. “If I had to keep doing this when it started snowing, I was going to be grumpy, I can’t lie, Steve.”
The mac and cheese was done before the chicken fingers, so he put it to the side to reheat. He’d never made the chicken before, so he wasn’t sure on the timing, but he figured that it was better to err on the side of cooking them too long. He didn’t want to serve undercooked chicken. When it was all finished, Tony plated it up. The chicken fingers looked a little dark, but he was hoping it all tasted okay.
“He just knows your name is Tony, and I’m working doing minor construction stuff. That’s what the NDA says, and so that’s what he knows,” Steve replied.
“About every thirty minutes or so,” the man said with a shrug. “I’ll pay you, if you’re worried about that. I’m good for it.”
I'm in the middle of a writer's block spell the likes of which I've never known. Thank you to all of you for your patience on this - and to Tina and Sabre in particular for some helpful prods in the right direction.
This one is fighting me a bit, folks, so I apologize for the wonky posting schedule. Your comments are joy, however, so thank you for all of them.
Steve had walked in on Sarah and Bucky twice in the week since he’d been back from Kenya, and he respected that they were still in the honeymoon phase of things, but….
Bucky pulled his phone out of his pocket and scrolled a little. “2:30. Nat says she has the license.”
There were about seven points of commonality between them - orphans, passionate baseball fans, charitable - but Tony had yet to muster the courage to use any of them to strike up a conversation.
They went out for beers and clams that night and there was something about Brock that Steve couldn’t put his finger on - something not good. Something… off. In terms of a boyfriend, Brock wouldn’t be a good fit. Steve wasn’t into being possessed, and the way that Brock introduced him around at Tucker’s Tavern told him that Brock was more into collecting people than knowing them.
“Tony, whatever you’re terrified of, I’m guessing it’s not as real as you think it is,” Pepper said gently. “He asks about you whenever we book him; and rumor around town is that he has a thing for facial hair. I think you may want to shoot your shot, love.”
“Funfetti, right? That’s the cake you said your mom always made for your birthdays. I missed your birthday, and I’m not that shitty of an employer. So happy belated Steve.” Tony gave a soft smile. “Home next, but do any other stops you need.”
At the time, Steve had heard that Tony didn’t think he was sophisticated enough to understand, that Tony thought he was naïve, or dumb. Tony was trying, instead, to protect him. He put a thousand other puzzle pieces together in an instant and then blinked at Bucky rapidly.
Something passed over Tony’s face that Steve struggled to identify. “I was, I really was. I still am.”
Steve set his jaw and ran through the list of worst case scenarios this may come with. Unless the Gorgeous Dying Man needed him to do some sort of euthanasia, Steve could probably handle it. “Done.”
There was silence from JARVIS, but it was the judgemental silence. The one that meant JARVIS would pass on the information against his better artificial judgement.
Upper balcony, Steve’s 10 o’clock, talking to a woman who was not Pepper Potts. He had been talking to Pepper, but she must have left when Steve’s periphery vision had to focus on a kerfuffle at the buffet table and had been torn temporarily from Tony.
Steve lost himself in the rhythm of his feet on the pavement as he ran up and down the streets of the borough, with an old Fall Out Boy album playing in the background. Usually he could completely clear his brain as he ran, but he couldn’t get out of his own head that day. Since The Big Fight, Brock had gotten creepier and more possessive, and Steve kept meaning to text and break up with him, but he also wasn’t sure they were doing anything worth breaking up.
It was not for wondering what it would feel like to be fucked by a walking triangle with a smile that could tempt a nun.
“You know,” Bucky said, as he swiped a piece of shortbread and shoved it in his mouth, “I liked you better when you hated us.”
“Buttercup, while your commentary on my life is always welcome, you’re missing the mark on this one. I simply think his artistic gift needs to be shared with a wider audience.”
The pet names were probably too much too soon, but so was bonding with Captain America, so Tony would let it slide.
“There’s no repairing this,” Tony said into the quiet, and Steve’s stomach sunk. He’d wondered. Being a professional athlete meant you knew your body better than most doctors, but being married to a bone magician meant Tony always knew it better.
Steve took two deep breaths. He knew what Tony was saying was true; he’d known it the minute his knee snapped in between Thor and the ground. He’d known he was on borrowed time with both of his knees, but he hadn’t quite expected to be borrowing this little.
The man nodded again - that slight jerk of the head that could be anything from a seizure disorder to consent, but Steve forged ahead.
Steve shrugged again. “I’ve never worked for a reclusive billionaire who looks like he might actually be a corpse and not a human some days before either, so I figured it’s a summer for new things.”
“Hm,” he mused out loud. He had profiles on a lot of the sex apps - sorry, dating apps, but can we please be real? - but KnottyPining was the only one that had a separate section for discreet VIPs.
Over the years, Steve had taught him how to draw, Peter had taught Steve how to be a dad, and they’d both taught each other how to love Tony the best. They’d formed a family, and Steve wouldn’t trade it for the world.
“What are you doing here? Are you okay? You’re still wearing my jacket?” All of those came out in a rush as Steve hurried to sit next to Tony on the bench.
Neither of them said anything for a minute. Finally, Tony sighed. “I have other rounds to do. You’re being transferred to an ortho suite as soon as we get one clear.”
Which may have raised a lot of money for war bonds, and definitely brought the crowds out to the USO shows, but that spin was bullshit.
Tony let his eyes drift to Steve, who was playing in a string quartet that evening. His hair was slightly longer than it had been the last time they’d come across each other, and Tony ached to scratch his fingers through it.
“And yet,” Tony replied. He pulled out his tablet and started tapping away. “Maybe I can become one of those people who is productive in parks. I hear nature can be soothing.”
Steve knew he should thank Tony for being honest, tell him to find someone to do the surgery, and retire gracefully.
“I like details,” Tony said with a shrug. A car horn sounded in the distance. “That’s my ride, but let’s talk water sometime, okay?”
“However could I accomplish that, Sir?” JARVIS replied. “I’m a robot, I have no judgmental options.”
Steve looked over his shoulder at Tony. They’d been doing more social-y things together over the past few weeks, but nothing as overt as this. It had been more like meals together, or Tony allowing Steve to sit in the workshop when his heavy lifting wasn’t required.
“Are you speaking of your employee whom you have been mysteriously neglecting? Yes, he wanted to serve his purpose within this home.”
“As long as we can get married on the way,” Tony quipped, “because someone who loves both Leia and actual coffee is too good to let go.”
Tony’s eyes snapped from the tablet to Steve’s, and Steve could not read the expression on his face.
“What MJ says, too,” Peter affirmed. With one more hug, Peter took off to greet some other folks, and Tony let his eyes drift to the raised dias where Steve sat.
“I grew up in Flatbush, in the 90s when people without hedge funds could own houses in Flatbush,” Steve started. “Just me and my ma, really, and then my buddy and his family. Dad was a drunk, before you ask, and drowned in his own vomit when I was 10, and Ma got sick when I was in high school. She was a good woman, you know any of those? I hope you do. My ma was someone who made you want to be a better person. Anyway, she died about two months before I graduated and the day after her funeral, a Peace Corps staffer happened to come to the nursery I worked at and asked if I’d ever thought about living in Tanzania for a few years.”
Tony still went undercover, but he’d resigned from the CIA. Freelance, he considered himself, but mostly it was because he longer he hid, the more he wanted to be seen, and living in Boonsboro allowed that.
Tony let out a breath that seemed to deflate his entire body. “Two years ago, that woulda taken you about six days, so I’ll take six hours as a real win in our adulting scorecard. You head to Soliloquy?”
Working for Tony was equal parts fantastic and frustrating. Something was wrong, but Steve had no idea what, nor would Tony answer any of Steve’s questions. There were used needles in a biohazard bin in the workshop, but Tony wasn’t diabetic. There were mysterious packages with return labels of hospitals in New York, but Tony said he wasn’t sick. There was Tony’s near completely fear of the sun, but vampires weren’t real.
Peter nearly launched himself across the dance floor once he caught sight of Tony. Unlike the smile he’d had pasted on since he arrived, his face broke out into a genuine grin to see his former intern.
“Tony.” Steve put his hand on the other man’s shoulder and was gratified to find it still, not shaking with any residual chemicals from the panic attack. “I’ll be going now, but honestly, I can stay.”
Steve grabbed his jacket and jogged down the front steps of the row house in Crown Heights they all called ‘home’ and started to head for the self-storage unit where he kept his motorcycle. A ride would clear his head for sure, but then he saw a few of his favorite neighborhood kids in the skate park and headed there instead. He watched Jamal, Kai, and Bobby for a little while - Kai was attempting a slappie for what felt like the ninth time that week - before he decided to wander through the butterfly gardens. It was a crisp October day, and taking the long way home didn’t seem like the worst idea.
He said nothing else, and Steve didn’t know what to think. So he filled the silence instead. “I’m sure you knew I had one, it’s on all my statutes, I think, but this one is the real one. The one that’s in the public record is one that Pegs and your grandpa helped create. Neither of them knew the real symbol, they both gave me designs to draw on top of the mark, and then I created something. They had someone tattoo it -
“Brock Rumlow,” Tony said, “tall, slightly gravely face, semi-permanent scowl? Will not eat anything that has touched mayonnaise, and pitches a hissy fit if there isn’t his favorite vodka at the bar he goes to?”
He was on his knees, with his face buried into a pillow, and his ass stuffed with a knotted cock. Tony was running his hands up and down Steve’s sides as they both caught their breath. He then guided them both to their sides on the bed, and curved himself into Steve’s back in a way that had Steve’s heart doing flippity flops unbefitting an alpha.
“Hey man, that sounds like it’s still pretty hard to do,” Steve rushed out. “Just keep focusing on getting that under control and we can chat later. Just focus on my voice and your breath, okay? In and out, in and out.”
“Really?” Steve asked. “I like the idea of it being entirely vow based. It makes it… I don’t know, mean more?”
Steve shook his head incredulously. “I have no idea what you’re talking about. Brock is an orphan, and he’s working three jobs right now. He has no money, he’s not in your world. Whoever you think he is, you’re confusing him with someone else.”
The man held up his fishing pole. “It’s a good place to catch sunfish. Mind if I join you? This is my lucky spot.”
Tony just gave Steve a look. Working Peter up like that right before dinner was never a good idea. Steve just looked a little sheepish but said nothing about it, instead focusing on the food. “Did you cook, Tones?”
The judgemental silence returned, and Tony lost himself in daydreams again as he watched the ocean tides. A few moments later, the elevator dinged.
Without even thinking, Steve answered. “It’s the raw materials for a titanium and gold alloy that he’s been working on for the exoskeleton down in the workshop.”
“Didn’t say you weren’t.” Pepper took a sip. “I know the three of us have been, well, the three of us for a while, but I’ve never talked about my sex life with you and I’m not about to start. That’s all.”
As he cooked, he drifted back into memories. Ana and Jarvis had both cooked, and he had loved staying in the kitchen as they talked to him. Shaking his head, he brought himself back to the present. He had to focus on the macaroni and cheese, as he didn’t want the cheese to burn. This was one version of her mac and cheese- she had two. One was the one he ate for lunch as a little boy. The other was the baked version that they had as a side dish. Even though there would be chicken fingers for dinner, this was the quick version.
“You both like eating ass, from all the rumors I’ve heard, so I’d say that’s enough to start with,” Nat replied.
“Baby,” Steve said quietly. “I know how to hold my body to not let that happen. Between the choice of my knee or my spine, I’m going to choose my knee.”
Soon, a female voice replaced it. “Steve, this is Pepper Potts and I am the CEO of Stark Imagineering. Tony has told me all about you. JARVIS said you were looking for Tony?”
Steve laid his head on Tony’s shoulder. “I love you, too. All I saw was that he’d have a better life than I do, and that blinded me.”
There was something Tony wasn’t saying, and Steve itched to ask, but something stopped him. Instead, he brought his forearm up to Tony’s eyesight. “I have this, do you have one?”
The man stepped toe to toe with Steve and the phrase “spitting fire” came to mind. “Private. Beach.”
man. And he wasn’t really stalking, he was more stumbling, which was fair because walking angrily in sand had to be a challenge.
“Well, glad you’re back now,” Steve said. He put his cello in the stand and cracked his neck side to side. “I’m going to massage my hands. You want anything from the green room?”
Steve sighed. Tony hadn’t been wrong that Bucky was furious. He’s stomped into the room several hours before, covered in grass stains and still in his uniform. Tony had eventually forced him into the staff showers and given him a pair of scrubs to wear, but the first hour or so while they waited for Dr. Strange was full of a lot of half-completed sentences, laced with cursing.
He ran his hand over his face, and absently scratched his beard. It probably meant nothing that he always knew where Tony was. Tony was a complete stranger - they’d never even spoken. So Steve was basically being a stalker. Not the best look.
“Thrilled you can still keep track of time,” Pepper said drolly. “I need you to go get him. Happy will stay with the car, but there are folks here to see Steve, and we don’t want to disappoint.
A bell sounded and Steve Rogers, the instructor Tony was desperately trying to cosy up to, called for them to end practice. Tony moved slowly, not only because he liked to after practice, but because today was the day.
Something that life in Kenya had taught him was that several things could be true at once; people could be fundamentally good and make evil decisions, he could love Bucky with all his heart and also wish for his slow and torturous death.
Tony never meant to make Steve uncomfortable, and that’s why they were still together. Lots of negotiations, lots of spats, lots of full-out fights, but they’d built a life together.
“While I’m sure your heartfelt confession was heard,” Dr. Cho said with a kind smile, “I have a feeling it’s more due to the antidote I just injected.”
Bucky was quiet for a moment. “Didn’t he make you sign about fourteen NDAs? Can you really be telling me that shit?”
Tony shrugged. “I like learning. You knew things I didn’t, and I wanted to learn them. Plus, you’re fucking gorgeous and somewhere around 90% my type.”
“Hey, listen man, can we pay you? We seriously need, what, maybe an hour?” Bucky pleaded. “An hour of your life, and we’ll rake the sand back, or whatever you want. Honest mistake, but we’ve set some shit in motion, and…. Well…” Bucky ran his hand through his hair. “I’d like to get married today. I’ve been in love with this guy for a long time, and if I don’t go through with it today, I may lose my nerve.”
Bucky was quiet for a minute, which was good because everything Tony said that night came flooding back to his brain.
Steve rolled his eyes as they climbed back in the car. “I’m sure the supply chain management was really concerned. Where next?”
And he knew he was. He knew he’d allowed Tony to push every single button, and he could have been an adult any time in the last several days and asked questions. He just couldn’t get over the presumption that Tony would tell him how to function.
Miraculously, Peggy’s niece was part of the whole SHIELD apparatus and they’d allowed her into his handling team. She’d let onto him that she was aware of his… proclivities and that there were escorts of both genders, just like there was in his day. And now, he didn’t even have to hang around a phone booth at 2am - he could access it all from his phone. Sharon got him a non-government iPhone and loaded it with something called a VPN, and taught him how to use KnottyPining.
At one point, a bevy of doctors came in and someone began to push Steve out of the way. He knew it was now or never, so he leaned down to Tony’s ear and said the words he’d been holding inside.
Steve relaxed slightly. Tony had told him it wasn’t a busy spot. “Yeah, my housemate told me about it.”
“You just realized he’s worth using words for,” Bucky finished with a lazy grin. “Welcome to what the rest of us have known for a bit.”
“You’re doing just fine, handsome,” she replied. “I’ve been at this for a long time; third generation. Quick tip, just remember that you’re inviting us to be a part of changing someone’s life. You’re giving us an opportunity, you’re not asking for our money.”
“Wow, I take back the smart,” the man said with an eyebrow raised. “It’s not a quick favor, you wanna know what it is first before you agree?”
“Steve, I’m so sorry, this is a lot of information at once, but please come to the house. Something tells me that having you in the room would soothe him,” Pepper said.
Steve nodded, and Tony ambled off. Steve’s eyes followed him all the way back to the house, which is when he became vaguely aware that Bucky was talking to him.
Tony paused mid-chew. He hadn’t known Steve was even in the room for that one - he’d mentioned to JARVIS that Steve’s work reminded him of Monet's style.
“Grandson, yes. Dad was named Howard, too, as an FYI, because Stark men love nepotism and narcissism as much as we love good scotch. So I know. And you’re safe.”
They fought constantly - Tony had hired Steve to do all the heavy lifting for him, but Steve would routinely find himself summoned by JARVIS to get to the workshop quickly because ‘Sir’ was attempting to do everything himself again.
As he headed off the raised stage and towards their dressing room, he felt the heat of a stare at his back. He turned swiftly and caught Tony’s eyes. The heat in them burned Steve’s clothes off.
Tony’s eyes flew up from the chart he had been looking at and met Steve’s. The look in them stole Steve’s breath.
Erskine had seen that Steve was a human first, and an alpha second, and that’s why Steve got the serum - because Erskine knew that once his body matched his secondary gender, he’d still act like a human with choices and not a creature with instincts.
“No, Steven, I am not,” Tony said, as he sailed into the curtained off area in the ER where Steve was currently doing his best not to expire from pain. “But isn’t it lucky for both of us that I am, since despite the advice of at least seven professionals, you decided to go for that tackle. Aren’t we both completely thrilled that I happen to be the orthopedic surgeon on call to see if you have any bone left in that mess where your knee used to be? I know I am. Aren’t you, Steven? Aren’t you simply ready to pass out from excitement, love crumpet?”
Tony swiveled his head to see a platter of grilled salmon with broccoli and brown rice. His stomach revolted at the smell, not that he’d tell Steve. Telling Steve the pain medicine he was on to simply function meant that solid food was too much, meant telling Steve he was in enough pain to take such high dose medicine. Which would mean explaining what was happening, and that option wasn’t on the table.
“Contributing to Tony’s mother’s legacy is one of the most important parts of our family,” Steve continued, knowing he was laying it on thick, but the couple in front of him was lapping it up. “It’s so sad I never got to know her, but doing this makes me feel like I can know a piece of her. That might not make any sense.”
His words scraped across Tony’s soul. Like he didn’t already daydream about staying alive long enough to learn everything that made Steve happy. But he wasn’t going to. The palladium that housed the reactor keeping him alive was bleeding into his bloodstream. He’d die without the reactor and die with it, and all this summer was for was throwing as much scientific spaghetti at the wall as he could to make sure it never happened to anyone else.
He headed back to the other end of the coffee bar to wait on another customer, but Steve knew there was no way it was going to end there.
Black Friday, also, made him so feral that he took his bike and rode as far as the gas tank would take him - which ended up being a town in the Catskills - where he stomped around a state park and screamed for a few hours.
“Enjoy shackling yourself to someone until death do you part,” Tony said to Bucky. To Steve, he said, “Do you have another job or anything?”
Tony barked out a dry laugh, which led to a coughing fit. When he could breathe again, he glared at Steve. “He’s using you, Steve. He’s using you to get to me, because no one in that family cares about anything else than their own power, control, money, and fame. You’re not in this world, so you have to trust me. That man is using you, and I do not want you to be hurt, Steve.”
His eyes weren’t just bloodshot, they were sunken. Steve wasn’t a physician or anything, but he’d seen a few episodes of
There was a confusion - maybe even a pain in Tony’s eyes that caused Steve to pause. “I wasn’t sure you were serious.”
“So this is the strongman. Jim Rhodes, not honeybear, or sugarbear, or whatever other infantilizing thing falls out of this idiot’s mouth,” Jim said with a wide smile and a firm handshake. “Thanks for keeping my boy safe this summer.”
“It was a temporary death,” Tony protested. “The good doctor here got my heart started again in no time.”
The smirk painted on Bucky’s face told Steve it hadn’t worked. “While I appreciate you treating my handcrafted decaffeinated-because-I-love-you macchiato like a shot of Jager, you want to tell me why you’re here and not at home with Tony and Peter?”
SHIELD kept hinting that it was time for him to find a good omega and bond, that part of his service to his country would be producing pups with a PR-sanctioned omega, and smiling through it. Steve had been frozen through the 50s so the nostalgia for the nuclear family baffled him - it hadn’t existed in his world, even though he got told over and over again he was the symbol of that version of America.
“And that’s how we ended up together,” Steve said, as Tony squeezed his hand. Pepper had challenged them to get $500k in personal donations that night, and it had ended up involving a lot of telling their story.
The stranger’s hair was slightly floppy - Steve’s personal preference - and he had bags under his eyes that could probably carry luggage. Whatever drove this dude to a bench at 11am on a Saturday wasn’t small, and something in Steve itched to help.
Steve couldn’t help but wish that more people fell that in love with learning as Tony clearly was. He also wished that he could see Tony looking this excited and passionate every day of his life.
“You got me there,” Tony agreed as he held out a new piece of paper with the title of the next book that he needed.
Steve just shook his head. While everything that Tony said was probably true, that didn’t make the missing book any less frustrating to him. Steve took pride in how well he kept the library. Everything was neatly organized. Books made it back out onto the shelves within an hour after being turned back in so that other patrons could find and borrow them. He and his coworkers made regular trips around the library looking for books that had been left out so that they could reshelve them so things like this didn’t happen. The fact that it had and Steve didn’t know why bothered him. The fact that he also felt like he was failing Tony to an extent didn’t help matters.
By the time he checked into a motel for the night he was already semi hard and wanting. He got to his room and immediately stripped down before crawling into bed, taking himself in hand and jerking himself off nice and slow. He wanted to make the moment last as long as possible.
. Before he could think twice about it, he was hitting the send button and listening to the little whoosh sound that meant his actions were done without a way to undo them.
“Returning it,” Tony answered, pulling out a slip of paper from his pocket and handing that over to Steve as well. “I’ve gotten the information from it that I need but it did open up some new avenues of questions to explore. Can you check if you have this book in right now?”
Steve was working very hard to keep his face straight and not show the amusement he felt over the situation. “My name’s Steve and it would be my pleasure to help any further needs that you have from the library.”
“Fuck yes,” Tony hissed out. “Want to bury myself deep in your throat. Fuck you ‘til you you can’t talk the next day.”
Steve frowned, not wanting to let it go that easily but Tony had a point. Staring at the same shelf wasn’t going to make the book magically appear so they might as well try and find something else that could help Tony research for his thesis so he wouldn’t fall behind due to this setback.
Steve felt his face flush slightly and hoped that it wasn’t enough for the other man to notice. “Yes I can help you with that back at the desk,” he said before leading the way back to the circulation desk.
A week later Tony came striding into the library, book under his arm, and glancing around the people standing in the open lobby area. When his eyes landed in Steve standing behind the desk his whole face lit up and he positively had a skip in his step as he queued up at the desk to wait for the hunky blonde to help him find the next book that he needed for his research. There were two people ahead of him but the cute librarian was worth the wait.
“Name’s Steve,” he said over the phone as he got his hand going again on his cock. “I guess it’s fair to tell you since your name was on the bathroom wall with your number and I wouldn’t want to have you at a disadvantage. That and while Hot Cock might be flattering and accurate, it’s not the most charming name out there.”
Tony just shrugged and used the buoyancy of the water to jump up into Steve’s arms, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist and clinging like a barnacle. Steve rolled with the motion and let his hands drift down until they were palming and groping Tony’s perky ass, letting a finger dip in occasionally to brush against the furled hole between Tony’s cheeks.
At one point he thought he had seen Tony hurrying by out of the corner of his eye but when he had turned around to take a closer look he didn’t see the other man anywhere in the lobby. Shaking his head Steve tried to get himself to focus. Yes he wanted the chance to see Tony again but he also had his own work that he needed to get done and he couldn’t spend all day pining after a man that may or may not show up, no matter how much he may want to.
Steve shook his head as he laughed at Tony’s antics. “I should draw you a map. Maybe that would at least help you find an exit. I would hate to come across your mummified body while reshelving just because you got lost trying to find a book.”
“Oh you even remembered my name,” Tony chuckled delightedly. “I hope it’s because I left a good impression behind and not because you had to walk the helpless man through the library to find a book.”
Tony got a raised eyebrow at the question but Steve didn’t say anything, just called over another worker to man the desk and directed Tony back towards the rest of the library. The trip was just as much of a maze as before. With three floors plus a basement filled with rooms of books as well as a few media rooms and conference rooms, the library really was one where someone could get lost if they didn’t know where they were going.
That drew a matching moan through the other end of the phone and Steve could hear the distinct sound of flesh on flesh as Tony was obviously jerking himself off to what Steve was saying. It was a heady feeling for Steve to know that this perfect stranger was getting off to him, his cock and his voice taking someone else up through their own pleasure.
Tony couldn’t hold back the startled laugh. “Hopefully not. The problem that AI can run into though is the lack of feeling and empathy. Take self driving cars for instance. Let’s say a car AI values the safety of the passengers inside its car above those around it and to avoid a crash has to swerve out of its lane of traffic. On one side of that car is a motorcyclist and on the other is a concrete barrier. A human might make the choice to hit the barrier because even though they might get hurt they probably won’t die where the motorcyclist might if they were hit by a car even though the person in the car won’t be harmed that way. We do this because we care about the safety of more than just ourselves. Would an AI do the same or would it’s inability to empathize mean it would run over the motorcyclist to prevent injury to the passengers in the car?”
Rhodey was quiet for a few beats, which Tony knew was even more dangerous than sarcasm. “The way he looked at you, and the way you look at him? I’m not talking about fucking, Tones. I’m talking about family, and if you would use your words, I think this one might be good for you. That’s all.”
Tony was quiet, but began to trace his fingers up and down Steve’s cock - featherlight and yet tender. “So what do you want? Do you want the world to know you are soulmates with the black sheep of the Stark family? I’m a hooker, Steve.”
“You could just ask him out, you know,” Rhodey said quietly as he and Tony observed the dance floor. “Would probably save Pepper some time.”
,” Steve snapped. Another thing he hadn’t meant to say out loud. “He doesn’t know what it’s like to have a body that fails you all the time, to have to fight for every breath sometimes, to know that you’re carrying around a ticking time bomb, and that you’re only….”
“Your body isn’t ready for anything you need more time for,” Pepper sassed back. She ushered everyone out of the room. As soon as the door clicked, Tony motioned for Steve.
“You know everyone,” Steve said, wrapping his fingers in the massaging gloves he always used on breaks.
Steve shook his head, and dropped the IKEA bag he’d been carrying. As he and Bucky got to work setting up the arch under which Bucky and Sam would exchange their vows, Steve couldn’t shake the idea that this pop-up wedding needed a bit more planning.
Instead of responding further, Peter took a swig of water from the bottles provided and headed off in the direction of where Tony was standing.
Bucky nodded. “When we were growing up, do you remember that show about spaceships? The one on PBS that showed you how to build models out of stuff around your house?”
“The leader of Stark Resilient needs to hate vigilantes. It fucks with business, it doesn’t allow for the version of world peace that we sell. I, on the other hand, am a vigilante - because that’s what undercover ops is. It’s state sanctioned vigilante-ism, because while it upholds law and order, it does it on our terms and usually outside of the, you know, actual law. I’ve been ordered to take down your BFF by any means necessary, after getting info out of him.” Tony took a deep breath and raked his hand over his face. “When did the glamor slip?”
“Steve, I’ll be in the workshop. Go ahead and order pizza.” He didn’t wait to hear Steve’s answer before heading downstairs. He wasn’t quite ready to see the results of his mistakes.
Tony fell hard for both of them in different ways. Bucky was a brother and fellow shit-stirer second only to Rhodey, and Steve was…
“So you don’t want to be able to walk into the hospital for the birth? You want to spend the first year of Peter’s life in rehab? Why is your stubborn ass so focused on the past and present?”
Fuck that they weren’t omegas and didn’t have bonding glands. They were soulmates, and they’d make their own bonding.
“Maria Stark Gala,” Steve called back from his spot in the bathroom, where he was meticulously trimming his beard.
A few weeks later he was ready to try again. And this time, Tony made one important change. Instead of trying to do it for his son and husband, he was going to do it with them. Yes, a two year old wasn’t a whole lot of help, but he was having a lot of fun playing with the grated cheese. Steve was laughing as he poured the macaroni into the water, and Tony himself was carefully watching the roux to make sure it didn’t get too hot. Taking a moment, Tony sent a thought off to wherever the Jarvises might be. ‘Thank you for letting me have this.’ Then he steeled himself for awkward questions and said to Peter, “You know, Ana Jarvis taught me this recipe.”
“Cool. I’m not sure if there’s any sense in asking you for hard limits a third time. Can you at least promise me to use a safeword if anything gets too much?”
‘Good morning’ Tony was supposed to say, but instead, he just grunted and stared at the plate Stevens put on the desk to his right. Tony had planned to ask Stevens if maybe they could, like two reasonable adults, pretend that the sex had never happened, but for some reason, he was now unable to even utter a greeting.
“Are you alright, son?” Pierce was staring into his eyes, seemingly concerned. “You seemed to be far away for a moment there.”
Making him take breaks was a different matter altogether. Even Lowell reported that he was mostly working during her shifts with occasional, short
“I don’t know what has been going through your head. Or what the fuck the look on your face means now.” He made a vague gesture towards Steve. “But you can’t lug around getting in people’s faces like that.” He pulled the coffee pot out of the machine, although it hadn't run through yet and filled two mugs. “And I can’t let myself get intrigued by it over and over again,” he muttered, maybe not meaning to be heard. “I can’t get rid of the feeling,” he continued louder, “that us having sex just after you’ve done something dumb might be an incentive for you.” He handed Steve one of the mugs. “Is it?”
“He’s good, they’re already talking prosthetics,” Steve said absently, confused as to why JARVIS was answering Tony’s personal cell. “Can I talk to Tony?”
They were interrupted by Sam sticking his head out of Bucky’s room and motioning to them. “He’s done with his bath. You can come on in again.”
Steve was quiet for a while, before voicing a confession he’d been afraid to say out loud. “I was sure he’d see my side if I just made the appointment.”
He’d been so stupid to hire Muscle Man Steve. He did need help, but he didn’t need it from someone he would have fucked so hard his dick broke in a past life.
The first twelve weeks after a knee replacement were crucial to the long-term recovery of the patient. Conveniently for Tony and Steve, their forthcoming son was due in sixteen weeks, so only having a month of wiggle room wasn’t the best, but it was better than nothing.
“And Nat, Sam, Clint, and Bucky,” Tony said with a slight smile. “You brought a traveling circus with you, sweetheart, and I’m glad.”
“‘Oh, it must be the alloys he’s been waiting for,” Steve said, and headed for the elevator that would take him up to the roof. A shower could wait if the shipment had arrived. The sight that waited for him made his heart skip a beat.
Steve shook his head. “I’m an artist and in between commissions right now. I teach during the school year, too, but I’m shockingly free this summer. Was going to stay down here in a friend’s beach house and paint.”
Like maybe even a Google search to make sure they were allowed to have a pop-up wedding on a beach in New Jersey.
“Fine.” Tony leaned over, and took a piece of broccoli. It tasted like ash in his mouth, but he chewed deliberately, without breaking eye contact with Steve. “Happy?” He asked after he swallowed.
The tone of Nat’s voice was laced with condemnation - which Steve deserved so deeply it caused him pain.
Peter was right. The texture was so very off on the mac and cheese, so much so that icky might be the best word for it. How could he have messed up Ana’s wonderful mac and cheese so badly? This was something he wanted for himself and Peter, and he ruined it from the beginning. He wasn’t sure how to fix it, but he knew he needed to give himself some time.
“Not any more,” Tony said. “I can’t sign off on anything, you’re right about that, but there is not a doctor on this planet who will disagree with my assessment. Strange is on his way in to offer a full diagnosis, and to schedule your surgery. We’ve pulled him away from that creepy ass lab he has, so I’m sure he’ll be in a great mood.”
Tony nodded. “I have no idea how long I was there, but at some point, this guy sat down and talked me through the panic attack. He helped me breathe, and then noticed I was shivering, and gave me his jacket. Figured he knew who I was and was looking for a reward of some sort, so I gave him the code.”
“Master Rogers is on a run, shall I summon him home?” JARVIS’ question penetrated both the silence in the room and the noise in Tony’s head.
Tony hummed into Steve’s skin. “Maybe. I just like the idea that once the universe syncs you, no one can fuck with it.”
“No,” Bucky shook his head. “He’s worried, like the rest of us, but you know Thor. Mad is something he reserves for the opposite team and anyone who is ever mean to Jane. We are all fucking confused, though.”
Steve stole another glance at Tony to find that his eyes were closed, and his skin was decidedly ashy. There was also an odd sheen to a few of his veins sneaking out from under the sleeves of his worn t-shirt.
“The car. It’s got a flat. They’re at that lot on 9th and AAA can’t get there for another thirty minutes.”
Then, visions of how caring Tony was - even through JARVIS - started flashing through Steve’s head. Steve’s favorite snacks stocked without asking, a rowing machine in the indoor gym after Steve said he wanted to try it, reimbursement for every single thing he’d purchased that summer down to sticks of gum.
Without answering, Bucky went and retrieved his prosthetic arm from its charging station. He flipped up a plate near the elbow to reveal a signature burned into the metal.
“As long as I’m doing it as your husband, I don’t care what I do, babe,” Steve replied. “Playing, dancing, schmoozing. I’m mostly annoyed that the group Pepper hired has their 2nd violin out of tune.”
“I just think you deserve better than being someone’s PA,” Brock said, but the tone was off, like there were a million things he wasn’t saying. “And I’m glad you’re not with that narcissistic scumbag any longer.”
Tony had just enough time to get nervous all over again about his cooking before Steve and Peter came thundering into the room, Peter on Steve’s shoulders.
If Steve could have drawn his ideal mate, the man before him would be it. Even better than the app could have implied, if Steve didn’t get his hands and mouth on this man quickly, things would get sticky.
“Ana Jawwis? Who’s that?” Peter’s question led to Tony telling all his stories. Including ones he thought he had forgotten.
Peter was actually Lord Starbourne of some shire in England, and played violin entirely for fun. He followed his girlfriend around the world as she studied the limits and potential of the human body, and learned musical traditions wherever they traveled. He was a bit of a pain in the ass, but Steve liked playing with people who played for love rather than a mortgage payment as much as he could. It reminded him to play for love
Tony knew that Cho would be thrilled he was eating. The Oxy told him he wasn’t hungry, but he was. His body still needed everything that Steve put in front of him.
It was like someone let a pin out of a tire, and all of Steve’s stress deflated. He had a million questions, but the most important thing was those last three words.
“Jay, I have maybe two weeks left. Maybe. The palladium has taken over 85% of my bloodstream. Once I hit 90, that’s the ballgame. Pep gets the company, and you get to work with her.”
“One alpha to another,” Tony said conspiratorially, “the others don’t know what they’re missing. A knot in the ass… god, it’s perfection. Plus, we don’t have to worry about all the bonding shit, or the whole pups thing. Why doesn’t everyone want this option?”
“This is the only thing I wish we had,” Tony murmured between bites. “I’m jealous that omegas can bond naturally.”
“You’re right that we should see a new pulmonologist now that he’s older. See if there’s a second opinion on treatments or tissue transplants,” Tony said. “But experimental shit is gonna be a bridge too far for me, I think. Not for him. Me? If it were me? Throw me on the table, do whatever you want. But him? And you? Absolutely not. I want at least nine peer-reviewed articles and a personal call from the director of the FDA before I’m comfy with that.”
Steve gasped and pressed their arms together without even thinking. More emotions flooded his body than he knew what to do with. At the same time, he felt Tony’s teeth break the skin on his neck - ever so gently - as he simultaneously moved inside Steve to scrape the knot against Steve’s rim - and he knew what was happening.
“Ohmygod,” he said, obviously louder than he intended because the man on the bench looked in his direction.
Steve started ticking things off his fingers. “Point Break the morning I tried surfing, Capsaicin when you discovered I liked spicy things, Hot Potato when I dropped the casserole dish -”
Steve Rogers was one of those musicians that everyone knew about, but no one could give a steady job to. He played charity galas, engagement parties, weddings, and appeared on more studio albums than he could count. There were days that was wonderful and he adored the flexibility, and others where all he wanted was to stop having to learn new pieces of music every two days.
He shouldn’t have been surprised to find an entire room ready for him in Tony’s penthouse. There were clothes in his size, but Steve was especially touched by the hoodie. Tony knew he hated to be cold so much that even incapacitated, JARVIS could provide the knowledge. God, he did not deserve this man.
“Thank you,” Steve said. His voice was barely over a whisper, but it echoed throughout Tony’s body. He bustled around the house, and fifteen minutes later, JARVIS confirmed the helicopter was en route to Philadelphia.
If you liked the story, I'd love to know! Kudos and comments are life giving. If you're not sure what to say in the comment, know that I take keyboard smashes and emojis as full love. So, if you liked it more than just a kudos, dropping a heart emoji is great and I thank you in advance.
The man didn’t step away from Steve, but turned to Bucky with an appraising look. “I’m pretty shitty at relationships, but if you’re going to lose your nerve maybe it’s not the right time anyway?”
“Fuck that,” Steve said, feeling his hackles rise. “He doesn’t know who you are! No one knows you’re down here! JARVIS locks this house down so tight, and we disguise you when we’re out, and your paranoia is so strong there is no way anyone knows you’re here.”
“Tony, I love you. I know it’s fast, but I don’t care. I love you and I wish we had more time, I just… I love you.”
They’d met at Christmas time, just after Tony’s 30th birthday, five years previous. A completely chance meeting in a Trader Joe’s in Washington Heights - a place neither of them had ever been before - led to a semi-anonymous night in one of the apartments Stark Imagineering stashed around the city for various needs. Steve had nearly had three asthma attacks he came so hard, and he’d chalked the entire night up to a fever dream he’d wank off to forever.
They walked into Bucky’s room - Steve still stopped short at the sight of a gauzed stump on Bucky’s left side - and made some small talk. Brock talked for a few minutes about something none of them cared about, Sam and Steve filled Bucky in on the Phillies most recent disastrous homestand, and they all played along with the episode of “Family Feud” that was on the TV.
The ninth, however, Steve had gotten insomnia and stole some hotel paper to sketch Tony in the moonlight. Tony had seen the sketch the following morning - their trysts always occurred when Peter was with his mother - and commented on it.
This was the most precious gift he had been given, with the exception of his family. It was some time before he could look, and by the time he was ready, Steve was calling him for pizza. He would have to save looking for later.
“You can do it from here,” Tony said. “I have a lot of natural light spaces on the 2nd and 3rd floors I’m not using. I only need the first floor.”
Steve met his gaze. “You are wrong about him, about who he is, about what he does. You are so wrong.”
“He gets to make his own choices soon, and you get to make all your own now, so I know I’ve got borrowed time to have that opinion, but it’s the one I have,” Tony finished. “You two are my entire world, and the idea of experimenting happening anywhere near you makes me break out in hives.”
Just as they finished their song, and Steve smiled so brightly at the man playing first violin that it felt like someone punched Tony in the stomach.
“Sounds like it was an okay thing,” Bucky said evenly. “He’s done a few interviews, sounds like the dad was a right asshole, but anyway. He’s a fucking engineering genius. I can’t believe you met Tony Stark on a park bench.”
“Right, it’s about not telling me why you’ve dropped fifteen pounds, holed yourself up in a house on an island you’d never heard of two months ago, and smell so much like Johnnie Walker I started looking around for your dad.”
As Steve’s knot hit against Tony’s rim in small, micro movements that sent shockwaves through his skin, Steve’s hands reached around Tony’s body and firmly gripped his swollen cock. “How do you like this bit, sweetheart?”
He was nearly lost in thought completely when he heard someone reciting numbers that sounded oddly familiar.
Tony didn’t reply as she wandered off. She wasn’t wrong to encourage him to be brave - especially since he’d never had any trouble charming someone into his bed before. He realized, however, that the reason he was terrified to even start the conversation was that something in his gut said that Steven Grant Rogers, Professional Cellist, was not a one night stand.
He gave his look a last once over, decided it would do, since he’d be in shadows for most of the night anyway, and headed out to the living room. He grabbed his cello case and addressed his roommates. “Gig ends at 2am, so I’ll see you guys tomorrow.”
Steve swallowed a cough. He’d known Natasha for eight years and she was never not blunt, but it still took him by surprise.
“Jefferson,” Tony repeated. “JARVIS will make sure you have a room nearby, you stay as long as you need.”
“Brock Rumlow’s dad is in jail because he killed Tony’s dad,” Bucky replied, closing his eyes as though the statement was too much to say out loud. “Not, like, directly murdered him or anything, but there was a ton of corporate espionage and some real shady shit. Everyone in my world knows that Rumlow, Sr is in prison because he’s the one who fucked the launch of Stark Pharma, and it was that whole mess that led to Howard… They couldn’t ever prove that Rumlow was driving that night, so they got him on something else, but Stevie… that family is bad.”
“Sap,” Bucky said affectionately. He headed out the door and to the converted barn on the back of the property that served as his living quarters. It had the benefit of lots of natural light… and sound proofing wards.
“I’m paying him to haul shit,” Tony said smoothly, “because a dying man gets eye candy. Want to join me?”
“You’ll need to consult with whoever is in charge of reincarnation,” Tony quipped, “because it ain’t happening in this body.”
“Pep’s,” Tony said. “He knew we fought and it was becoming a whole thing, so he went there to finish his homework and not be distracted by our quote negative vibes.”
Now it was 2015 and everyone still knew that Captain America was an Alpha. But no one knew that Steve Rogers craved to be knotted.
That particular puzzle was interrupted by a change of song in his ears. This wasn’t Spotify changing songs, however, it was Sam calling. Steve didn’t feel like a chat, so he fished his phone out of his pocket and hit ‘ignore.’
“Apologies, Master Rogers,” JARVIS replied. “That must have been one of the rare occasions where my inputs could not process human verbiage.”
“The comics say you’re asexual and the tabloids will keep saying that until you fall for a state-sanctioned omega, but they also say that I’m a castrado with no gender becuase that’s what I want them to believe, so let’s go with what actually is instead of what is supposed to be, shall we?”
“We’d be honored if ours was on your list,” Tony said smoothly. “We’re hoping to raise the full five million total needed for the hospital wing tonight. Can we count on you getting us to that goal?”
