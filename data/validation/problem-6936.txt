Toni meant more to him than anyone else in the world—Buck was another story-, and she touched his heart without even trying to. So that call to Pepper hurt more than he expected, and he never wanted to make or receive that call again. Pepper, even if she didn't agree with Toni, had and will always care for her, and even if she removed herself from Toni's life-to cut the craziness and stress-, Toni would always be important to her. She would always care, and her heart would always break. This was no exception. Pepper was worried beyond belief, and Steve could hear it in her voice. And he would do anything to not hear it again, because hearing her broke his heart. Almost broke him in two.
She took a deep breath as she made her way to her tent. She had a few things to pack before they were off for another location. This time they were heading to a base, near some large city. Toni couldn't say which city as Phillips didn't tell her, just telling her to pack. It was annoying how he ordered her around, but she supposed that he was doing his job. He was the Colonel and all.
Madame Hydra laughed as she stepped toward Toni. "Does she really mean that much to you?" she asked, as she picked up her own metal torture device.
The Captain could feel his hands tingle as he reached for the shorts on the bed. Again, he didn't break eye contract with her, and she didn't look away. Silence had fallen as he bowed down in front of her, sliding the shorts up on to her body. His fingers grazed her skin the whole way up, and he could feel himself shake slightly. "You're beautiful," he breathed.
Things were in the crapper. Between getting out smarted—something that would never happen again- and the attack on Fury, something was in the works, a secret plan was kicked off. It didn't take a genius to know that something was up. However, it could've just been a random attack, as there was no doubt that the Director of Shield was the target of multiple assassinations though any given month. She assumed it was something he checked on his daily list.
"The Red Skull. He was told you were be here by a strange third party and I was sent to collect you."
Toni really didn't want to talk about this anymore and started the walk to the apartment again. Taking a deep breath, she tried to calm herself. She was grateful to Barnes for coming to walk her home, but she didn't want him to know that.
Bucky eyed his roommate as he knew something was up. "Is that it? Or did you try and enlist again?" He stood up annoyed. "Why do you keep doing that?" he asked, trying to keep his voice down as not to wake the girl. "You're just going to hurt yourself."
Barnes' hold tightens around Tony, refusing to let go. Bucky's hands are shaking around the genius. "No, that isn't it," he says slowly. His voice is shaky, a sign of how scared and nervous he is. He buries his face in the Genius' hair, breathing in his scent. "I love how you smell. I've missed it."
She could tell how pissed he was, but his anger just set off her anger. "You act like I owed you anything. A thank you maybe, but nothing else."
He gave her a smile as he stepped around the hole toward her. "Are you okay, Stark?" he asked, glancing over her. "I don't think I ever saw you bolted so fast."
Unable to stop himself from following her, he trailed her as she jogged. He kept to the shadows, watching her as she jogged through the crowd in a zig zag motion. He watched as random people tried to get her attention. He watched as they tried to touch her, which infuriated him. Why did they feel the need to touch her? Why did they think they were even allowed to touch her? Didn't they understand that she didn't want to be touched? He could see it in her every time someone got close to her. He could see how she flinched away from their touch, and he hated that look on her face. It wasn't exactly fear, but she had a pained look in her eyes. It took all that he had not to start killing these people for daring to touch her, for putting that look on her face.
Was that how Bucky felt when he fell to his death into a frozen bed of water? Did he feel anything? Was he aware that he was falling to his death? That he only had seconds left to live? Did he panic? Did he regret anything? Was his death painful? Did he feel a thing? Toni hoped not, but she doubted anyone had enough for luck that. His death was probably agonizingly painful, and he probably felt
She wondered when she had gotten to the point that she preferred her absent father to Captain America. "I'm peachy… In fact, would you happen to have a peach? I have a peach craving right now," she said, hoping to change the subject.
He placed a heavy kiss on her lips, stopping her in her rant. Without hesitation, Toni kissed him back, holding onto him like flames on fire. It didn't take long before it morphed into something more and dirty. They both knew that they needed to talk, and the sex was just a distraction, but after everything that had happen, they just needed each other. Sometimes, it wasn't what you said, but rather, it was just that you were there.
Holding the handcuffed still as best as she could, she struggled getting her left hand into the correct motion. After a few seconds, she took her arm out of the sling, which gave her a little more movement, but the cast was heavy and it hurt to hold it in one place. Toni didn't have a choice; she had to do this and she had to do this now, because she didn't know when she would get another shot.
Madame Hydra looked at the Captain before looking back to Schmidt. "He was easily captured. I expected more."
Bruce, who was taking deep breaths, sighed. "I still don't see how Captain America is a national security risk," he said in annoyance. "And I would agree with Clint. I might have to reintroduce SHIELD to the big guy." He wasn't joking, and this tone told everyone this.
"Riddle me this. Why haven't I put a tracker on Steve? And why don't I have a lab in DC? Or why hadn't I made you a body or something?" she asked, making her way to one of the DC monuments. "Granted, you can control the Iron Man suit." There was light smile on her face as she truly thought about it
Steve didn't let go or finch at the sound of Toni's voice. Instead of loosening his hold on her, his grip tightened, firmly keeping her in his embrace. "Toni," he uttered. His voice was firm, ungiven, but soft. "I know that look. I have seen it a few times…Seen it on a few soldier…" He drifted off as he placed a kiss to her forehead.
Colonel Phillips narrowed his eyes at Toni as he picked up the chair in the corner and placed it in front of the table across from her. "It could just be your horrible singing."
She patted him on the shoulder before she picked up her pace. "I would've teased you either way," she said with a chuckle as she stepped toward Phillips and Peggy. They were making their way toward the center of the camp, trying to put some distance between them and the guards posted at the gate. "However, it would've been much worse."
The usher, who didn't look much older than 20, stared at her with a puzzle looked. "You're with him? How the hell did he manage to get a dame like you?"
"I know," Steve repeated harshly, cutting the AI off. "It would be quicker for the suit." He knew it; it was logical, but he couldn't bring himself to care. "Fine."
Dugan and Jones laughed behind her, while Trip eyed the scene in front of him. Toni was now at a panel on the wall typing away at something.
Toni didn't open her eyes. "I'm fine, Agent Carter," she stated. Her voice was shaky and she hoped no one noticed.
However, his conditioning was far too great for him just to take off and find this woman, whoever she was. He had to return to his handler to report the kill, but he saw nothing wrong with taking the photo. It didn't go against the mission's objectives, so he pocketed the picture before returning to the base. For a while, she was the only thing he could think of, as he pondered who she was and how to find her. And, she was the only thing on his mind for years.
To him, anyone who made weapons from the Tesseract was not a friendly in his book. How could Fury even begin to think that was wise? There was no way explanation in Steve's mind that could justify what Fury was doing. To make things worse, he had lied to them. He had brought them in to fix his mistakes. He had put the world, including Toni's life, in jeopardy, and he couldn't forget that.
Out of mental exhaustion, she fell to her hands and knees, resting her head against her cold, shaky hands. As she knew that Barnes was going to die, she didn't think his death would destroy her like this. And how could she move pass this when she was the reason he was dead? She could've warned him. She could've done something.
look like a mess," she said as she looked him over. He was the one who Rogers found strapped to a lab table. "
That struck Toni as odd, because she didn't understand why those names would mean nothing to her soon? Did he want her memory or something? However, what would her memories give him? Maybe, he wanted her brain? But she didn't understand that ether. She knew she should find out, but to be honest, she was too exhausted to care as she had already put too much thought into this game, and she just wanted to get home to her own bed. "What is it that you want? I'm tired of this game."
"I feel special," Toni responded. "So Jones, let's see your hand." She turned the attention back to the game. Her competiveness was coming alive in her and she wanted to win this round.
Howard exhaled slowly. "That ten foot range of the device is very stable, so we just need to find a place away from the prying eyes."
"Yes!" Peggy cheered with more energy that she had a second ago. "Where is my camera to catch it all?"
Toni narrowed her eyes as she crossed her arms against her chest. Her fingers were tapping in annoyance. "I don't know if I would consider you a man."
"He's an idiot you know. He refused to listen and just let himself to die, not listening to my warning. How dare he do that to me?" she asked, not expecting an answer. "After everything, after hating him for years, I really started to like him,
"SHIELD will fall in a matter of days and Hydra will grow from the ashes." Though in a different degree as the Winter Soldier, the look on Pierce's face was unnerving. He was calm and angry all at the same time, and he even had a smile on his face.
He's a spy. Captain, he's the spy. His secrets have secrets." She looked at him for one more second before she turned to Bruce. "It's bugging him too, isn't it?" she said, point to Banner.
"I would say it's a good sign that Stark wears the ring around her neck," Rumlow replied, not wasting any time to jump into the conversion, while he took out the closest person next to him. Not wasting a second, he turned, heading toward the next adversary.
The Genius had always thought that Harley was a pain since the second that she saw him. Really, she thought he was a pest, but there was a small part of him that grew on her. He was a brother that she never wanted, but that didn't mean she wouldn't protect him like a brother, an annoying little brother…Again, she didn't want a brother…though her younger self might have. However her younger self was an idiot, even if she was already inventing at that age.
Without knowing where he lived (she knew it was somewhere in Brooklyn), she had no idea if they were close, which made the walk even more awkward. They had walked mostly in silence as she had no idea of what to say to him. She didn't want to insult him again, because it would happen again if she said something as Toni Stark was an asshole.
Toni exhaled, harshly. "It is, and if you and Agent Carter need a recommendation for a restaurant, don't ask me. I usually just skip that step in the date if you know what I mean," she said, winking while forcing a smirk on her lips.
"Who says I'm going to be blasted on my ass?" he asked as he rotated back to the glass. "Just hopeful thinking? You want to see me on my ass."
Toni's eyes twitched as he smiled. His smile made her want to hit him and she might, as she spotted a familiar wrench on the table. "You're pushing it, Stark," she said. She eyed him with a deadly glare. "I don't want to end up back in a prison cell, so shut it."
Tony isn't sure why he's letting her do this or why he feels so comfortable in her arms. He isn't sure why it feels okay to let go in front of her and let her see it all, but it's amazing how close they has gotten that they can do this. She isn't on the same lines as Pepper, but she is up there.
For working for Shield, Steve wasn't the most security conscience person, trusting society more than he should; Toni couldn't believe how naïve he was. In this case
No, the ring wasn't 'Toni Stark' style, if there was one. She would first need to see herself getting married, which she never did. It had never crossed her mind as a possibility. To her, it was a fairy tale, or in some cases, a nightmare, nothing more. Therefore, she had never thought of a ring or what she would like her ring to look like. However, she doubted she would've ever picked a fancy ring like all the Billionaires did. To her, they would just get in the way, especially if she was hand deep in something—which she always was. She was Toni Stark and all.
The room was already dark and the film had already started, which made it hard to spot anyone in the crowd; however, she was able to make out faces in the dark. Toni scanned the crowd looking for Steve, but she couldn't spot him. To get a better view of the crowd, Toni moved down the aisle, but she still wasn't able to spot him. Ignoring all the looks that she was getting, she crossed down to the corner of the auditorium by the screen and scanned the whole crowd. She still could not locate Steve.
"The plan is still a go for Miss Stark. We just need to eliminate Fury and Rogers. I must say, I didn't expect Rogers to be such a pain in my side, but for our plans to work, he must be removed." Pierce's eyes fell to his tablet, giving the article a once over. "I don't give much attention to this crap, but it is informative." He stared hard at the words: Wedding of the Century. "Could give Hydra a run for our money, but they're wrong about that. That wedding is never going to happen, even if Hydra allowed it to happen. Rogers can't handle Stark to save his life."
"Whatever you have to do," Barnes started as he pushed a metal table in front of the door. "Do it now."
Toni glanced toward Peggy before leaning back and looking up at the roof of the plane. "I will behave," she said as her
Steve had to pull the speaker away from his ear, as Jim's shrieking was painfully loud. "What happened?" he asked, trying to keep his cool. Yelling back at Rhodes would do nothing but make this situation worse; besides, he was a soldier. He could handle being yelled it; in fact, it was a normal for his line of work. However, there was something different about it when Toni was involved.
At first, Steve didn't realized that he had turned the water up even higher, and the water almost burnt his skin. "Relax," he told himself as he turned the water back down to normal levels. However, the memories started flashed before him.
"I'm fine." Why couldn't they leave her alone? Just thinking about what had happened to her brought tears back to her eyes and chills to her bones. She took a deep breath, as she tried to forget the stalker's breath on her face.
Taking a deep breath, she turned away and headed toward that door. "And fix that clock. It's annoying."
At that, Steve finally moved with a look of pure protectiveness on his face that no one could deny. "Stop," he ordered in his Captain's voice. It was hard to ignore his firm, unforgiving voice as he spoke, giving no room to protest. "We can't be fighting each other." His eyes drilled into everyone, almost daring someone to say something.
Steve was smiling, as he pocked the keys and got out of the white Audi to follow after them. His eyes were on Toni, watching the Genius' every step as if she was the most important thing in the world to him. "Easy, Toni," he replied, stepping on to the elevator. He was truly smiling.
Barnes was beating himself up over that, but there was no way he could've stopped her. Toni had a mind of her own and there was no telling her anything. "She wouldn't listen," he replied. "I tried, though I wish that I had tried harder." The image of her being grabbed from behind and knocked out by a hydra soldier was burnt into his mind. He couldn't get rid of the feeling that he failed as he watched her be taken. He felt like shit and he couldn't get rid of that feeling.
He flinched back, flashing back to their fight in the lab. She had used that word as an insult, and it hurt to hear her call him that now. Was she insulting him again? Yes, he said he wouldn't give up, but he didn't know if he could take
Toni let out a huff. "That was the main purpose of the device," she answered. Howard was too damn smart to fool and Toni wouldn't even try to lie to him, as it would be a waste of both of their time.
Toni wasn't sleeping, even though her eyes were closed. She was fully alert in her small cell, which she had been in for what seemed like weeks, but without any windows, she couldn't keep track of the days and the nights. Everything started to blend together. Every so often (Toni wasn't able to keep track of how often), an officer would bring water to her. She was feed twice a day, or what she thought was twice a day.
"Do you even care?! Or do you only care about yourself like a true Stark? Did you laugh when I dead?"
However, just as she turned from the lab to get a breather, Bruce turned around, and his eyes immediately locked onto her. She could feel his surprise as he suddenly dropped the tool in his hand, and though she couldn't hear him, she could make out her name coming off his lips.
It was coming to an end for the Asset, who was finally captured just mere feet from Toni. Mere seconds from grabbing the woman and disappearing—somewhere no one would find them. He was mere seconds from happiness…well what he thought was happiness. Having not experiencing it before, he had no idea if this warmth in his chest was happiness, but he knew he wanted to experience it over and over again. He wanted to bury himself in this warmness, as they disappear from the history books.
However, that would just get her adult-napped. To be honest, it was only a matter of time before he caught up with her with that super speed of his and did whatever he wanted to do to her. Whatever that was was still up the air, though she had an idea. She was a fucken genius, and the tech she could build could give anyone the edge over anyone. She wanted to say that she would never build anything for these assholes and them chasing her was a waste of time, but she wasn't stupid. She was playing a game of cat and mouse, and right now, she was pretty much useless. She was working on very little sleep and her will power wasn't at the level she was used to.
With a rush of joy and exuberance, she turned to Steve, as energy rushed through her. Before realizing what she was doing, she tackled her boyfriend, placing a kiss to his lips. Even with a loud explosion in the background, it didn't take long for the Super Soldier to wrap his arms around her and pull her close. Steve was like the sun, warming her up. He warmed something inside of the genius that Toni couldn't describe. Even with their problems. Even with even coming down on them. Even with the crap coming at her, he was safe. He was home, not that she had an idea of what that was, but she felt open with him, even if she was ashamed of herself. He showed her every day that she had nothing to be ashamed of, and she needed it. It took away her anger and fear.
Toni could feel herself start to wonder again. Why did the first man want this other man gone? Did this man do something besides attacking Rollins? She had no idea but she knew she had to move. She had to open her eyes.
"Enough with that," Sharon interrupted. "I know we don't get along. You're an ass and all, but you aren't a burden. You aren't broken. And if Steve sees you as that, he doesn't deserve you, though I doubt that's the truth. Probably, the furthest thing from the truth. Just looking at those pictures, I knows he loves you. So, don't let that stop you for getting what you want."
Toni glanced toward Natasha and Clint, who were very quiet. Natasha was watching Steve with an interesting look in her eyes, while Clint was focused on the box he dropped. He was shifting through the broken bulbs, but it was clear that he was listening to what Steve was saying as was Natasha. "And Bucky?" she asked, as she limped toward Steve. She was still covered in old and grease, and there was doubt that she smelled, but Steve didn't pull away from her when she reached for him.
She waited a few minutes before crossing the street in the shadows. She ducked in a bush as she saw a guard come her away. She peaked her head out of the bushes once she couldn't hear the footstep. As she had seen one too many action movies, she rolled behind a tree in a ninja fashion and posed before the tree. She moved the leaves out of the way and looked out. When she thought the coast was clear, she crossed to the fence at the back of the facility that was rarely patrolled. Reaching into her bag, she grabbed a wire cutter.
She took a deep breath as she didn't want to have this fight with him again. "What are you afraid of, Rogers?" she asked. "I can take care of myself."
Killian took a step forward, allowing only a few inches between him and Toni. "You say that now, but after this, you won't be saying that." He pointed the needle toward her neck.
"JARVIS call you?" Toni asked, breaking the silence. Her voice was hoarse, as if she had been yelling all night.
The man stepped forward to grab Toni, but before he could reach her, the genius threw a punch at his nose. He stumbled back, trying to catch his balance, but Toni didn't let up. She dropped to the ground and kicked his feet out of his legs. For a second, he didn't move as if he was in disbelief. "Y-You," the man hissed from the ground.
Phillips narrowed her eyes. "It never fails does it, Stark? No matter how worn out she is, she'll always call me that," he said to Howard, annoyance in his tone – but with fondness buried deep within his tone that Howard could barely detect unless he hadn't been looking for it. Or maybe he was biased, now that he knew she was his daughter (no matter how hard she tried to deny it) and thinking that everyone should love her.
In the past when she didn't want to be alone, the old Toni would go out to some random bar, get drunk, and pick up some random, hot (unless she had on her beer goggles on) guy with one thing in mind: Sex. Back then, it was the one thing that could make her feel anything. It was the one thing that distract her mind from the pain, and for those few hours, Toni was happy. However, it didn't last, and she ended feeling worse than she did before.
start to build up inside of her, as he continued to bug her. Her mind went to Steve without hesitation, as she wanted- needed him. "Remember when I told you, that I have an a…anxiety issue?"
"Okay, then." He paused. "I guess there's nothing to speak about," he said, stepping closer to her. "Just move out of the away." He reached for the doorknob, but Toni put her weight completely against the door as if to stop him.
"Let me go," she begged. If she didn't get away from him now, they would take her and there would be no end. If she wasn't saved, she knew she would cave and tell him everything.
Her feet, even with her socks acting like a barrier, were killing her as there was nothing to protect her feet from the hard ground. To make matters worse, it was freezing outside, and with no coat or shoes, the cold was affecting her faster than normal. She was losing her body heat quickly. She was shivering, but she had no interest in going inside.
Suddenly, Schmidt harshly grabbed her face and forced her to look at him. "It's such a shame." Toni gave him a questioning, narrowing look. "Such a shame that the Americans would send a beautiful woman into the battlefield." He had a hard, bruising grip on her face that she couldn't break. "Are they afraid to face me themselves? I suppose so as much as they sent a woman." He studied her face. "It will be easier to break you, though"
Toni had no idea where Howard was with her device, as she hadn't seen him since that night she hurt her arm. It annoyed the hell out of her that he had taken her device with him, but she didn't say anything as she realized that she needed a break. She had been working on it for days without end. Maybe, it would give her fresh eyes, because right now, she couldn't think of anything and it was frustrating her.
Suddenly, the S.T.R.I.K.E. patch was all she could see, and she was unable to make out anything else but the yellow font. She wasn't sure what the patch mean or who it belonged to. It could've been a military patch, but if it was, why would the soldiers leave her alone in the empty camp? It could've been SHIELD, but Fury would've known that if a SHIELD team found her, right?
"Really? You're worried about me? That's funny." She let out a chuckle. "I can handle myself, thank you." She stared deep into his eyes as she tried to figure out what was going through his head.
Rogers narrowed his eyes as he opened the file. His eyes widen at the sight of the picture. "What is this?"
Bruce took a step forward as if to step between Steve and the angry CEO, who was shooting draggers from her eyes. "I don't think it matters what was said," Bruce said calmly. "But whatever was said, it should be taken with a grain of salt."
"You don't have to get up," Steve started as he took a seat next to him. He stared at him, shocked at how old he looked. He knew seventy years had passed, but it was shocking to see Dugan like this with his hair thinning and turning into different shades of whites and grays. A used cane discolored from years of use sat a few feet from Dugan ready to be used. "How are you doing?"
Bucky sighed. "I understand." He glanced back to the newspaper, which was laying overtop of something. Only a corner of a white envelope was visible. "But you need to think this through."
"Toni," he repeated, as he looked her over. "What are you doing?" He was in full battle uniform with his rifle on his back, and he was looking pretty intimidating. She couldn't get pass his eyes and how angry he looked.
That's the last thing he needs right now. "No," he says strongly. "Only let Vision through if he needs me."
"W..W-what?" he shuttered, which was so not Barnes like. It made her laugh, even if she was mad at him.
Toni glared at him as she saw him reached for her. It took her a few seconds to figure out that he was going after her bag, which annoyed her as well. She didn't need him to carry her bag, but she didn't fight him when he took it from her. "I can take care of myself."
With a big greedy smile, Nick walked out from his office and handled Toni an envelope. "Here's your money for the week," he said with a smile.
She couldn't contain that laugh, which echoed throughout the craft, drawing several heads toward her. "I can probably handle it better than you," Toni said, feeling slightly better. That laugher had brightened her day. "And I would make a sexier CEO than you."
Steve glanced at him as they made their way through the rumbling base. "No, I'll save her; you just need to get out of here."
"When did I sign up babysitting?" Pepper teased back as she walked out of the lab. Toni watched her leave from the corner of her eye, knowing she would be seeing her again.
"I love that one too," Steve said as he wrapped his arms around Toni's waist and pulled her back into him.
After fixing the clock, Pepper turned back to the door. "Come eat, and I'll come get you if you don't come up. I mean it, Toni. Don't test me," she said with a smile.
Looking up from her phone, Natasha meet his glance. Her expression was serious. "Steve, I got a bogey. Short-range ballistic. Thirty seconds, tops."
Bucky's eyes narrow as he stares at Tony. "So you're getting back into that bed whether you like it or not, while Steve and I take care of you," he says, sternly. His expression is almost cold, like he's daring Tony to disobey.
The Commander pressed the blade tighter against Toni's neck, drawing blood. "No one cares for your mouth, but that does not seem to stop you," she replied angrily.
"So what movie are we watching?" Bucky asks. "I'm always up for a science fiction flick. I love those kinds of movies." Tony snorts as he pushes out of Barnes' arms, much to his displeasure. "No!" the super soldier whines. "Come back!"
He couldn't keep his eyes off her and the iron man suit. Her body was incased in the suit, and he was completely unable to make out her form in the bulky suit. He could only see her pale face and messy hair that was sticking out everywhere. However, even with helmet hair, she was still beautiful in his eyes, and he couldn't see himself with anyone else. "I don't remember it being that easy. This guy packs a wallop."
A knock at the door interrupted Steve, who shot a deadly glare at the door. "Come down, boy," Toni said with a chuckle. "I'll get the door. No need to burn it down." She waved him off, as she crossed to the door barefoot. With a forced smile, she opened the door. Before she could even get a word out, she could already feel her eye twitch. "Oh, it's the Wonder Twins." With a harsh sigh, Toni folded her arms a cross her chest. "What can I do for you?"
"Yeah, we compromised. Sometimes in ways that made us not sleep so well. But we did it, so the people could be free. This isn't freedom, this is fear," Steve said, giving Fury a side glare, as he tried to pretend he hasn't seen
Pepper stood still but she didn't turn back. "I'm not doing this because I want to. I'm doing this, because I have to. I'm doing this because Toni is important to me. She will always be important to me and I would do anything to make her happy; however, I have to think about myself. I have to, or all I am going to have is regret and hatred."
"Toni," Rogers called, softly. Toni flinched at the sound of his voice. After getting over her shock, she could tell that he was worried.
Trip shook his head as he picked up the coat. "So? Didn't your mother teach you not to leave things laying around? I know my mother would kill me if I did."
Toni let out a hefty sigh, feeling like she was hit by a bus and it kept going . With everything that happen in the last few days, it felt like someone was repeatedly in hitting her the head and kicking her in the stomach until she couldn't breathe. Maybe, she should just go back to New York, lock herself in her lab and leave the saving to someone else. "I can't say the same. Here for your boss?" she asked, still finding the idea strange. Wrapping her mind around it felt like holding a rattle snake. "No tears I see."
When Tony comes to, the pain's gone, completely gone like he's on the good stuff, but unlike with the good stuff, the room's spinning and not the good kind of spinning. It's the pukey kind of spinning, and who likes that? Everything's moving too fast for him, and he doesn't know what to think. For once, he doesn't know how to. There're too many questions in his head, and they're coming at him at a rapid speed. He doesn't know how to answer any of them.
"And I'm sorry that Aunt Peg hadn't rubbed off on you after all of these years. I'm sure she would be happy to learn that you took an assignment, so you can check out Steve's ass. You know Aunt Peg loved Steve. She would love that you're stalking him." There was a huge smile on Toni's face, as Sharon paused at the door. "Have a good day."
, it worked out in Toni's favor, though she would talk to him later about it. Hiding a key behind an apartment number wasn't the smartest or wisest thing to do, but she supposed that if someone wanted to break into his apartment they wouldn't need a key. They would either just break down the door or pick the lock. Then again, the ones breaking in with the key weren't the ones he had to worry about. He could handle those idiots. It was the people who didn't need the key that they had to worry about.
With a gentle hand, he pulled her closer as he guided her to a certain spot in the museum. The expression on his face changed slightly as an exhibit caught his attention. "Look at this." The exhibit was in no way as large as Steve's, but it took up a good bit of the overall exhibit.
"JARVIS, turn this shit off!" Clint ordered. "If there was an intruder, I think the sound would've killed him. What kind of home alarm is this?"
"The Mobile armor is deporting, Miss." There was a pause. "Captain Rogers is inquiring about your location. Would you like him to meet you instead?"
Bucky didn't speak right away as he thought about what he was going to say. "I've been worried about you for a while now, because you haven't been thinking. Also, you never brought a woman home before," he said as he took a seat on the bed. "Plus, why would she come home with you?"
Clint look up from his spot on the floor. "The beginning makes me cry! You will see, Cap. You will see," he said.
"I have not." He glanced back at her as she didn't respond. "And dancing with that guy was what?" he asked, annoyed.
He doesn't know why his father still has such a control over him, when he has been dead for years, but he does. Howard Stark seems to be always present in his thoughts, telling him how w-
He took a deep breath as he tried to force out the image in his head. The image of Toni walking away from him and Bucky following after her haunted him. Though it wasn't importance now, he hated that Bucky became the person she turned to. Back in the old crummy apartment, it was him, but was the only reason she turned to him was because he was the only person there? No, that couldn't have been it. He had felt the connection between them. So what changed? Besides him becoming Captain America… Was that the reason? Did he lose her the second that he became that?
He studied her, as if he was trying to figure out what to say. He was clearly in unknown water and he didn't know what to say. "It's okay." She looked away. "Toni, it's okay to be hurting."
She knows. She knows it all. Damn it all to hell, and Tony's cursing in his head. Is there anything that that woman doesn't know? Sure, she's a spy, but it seems like she's reading his mind! Why in the hell does he let Barnes in his lab? He should've kicked him out. "What?"
He did try at first to kill her when his handlers had given him the case, though it was without success. At the time, she was in her lab, working on one of her many suits, and while she worked, she had been blind to the world. Her eyes so focused on tech in front of her that she couldn't hide her emotions, and the expression on her face stopped him cold. She didn't work on these suits because she was smart enough to do so—well not fully-, but rather, she did it to ease her mind. She did it to get her mind off her troubles. She did it to through the night.
"Oh, yes, because I have the Dad Card. That's one of my father's wishes. Are you going to go against one of the last wishes of a dead man? If so, you are a heartless bastard," she teased.
"Oh, you should have," Steve say, pulling him close. "But don't worry, we're going to make up for it."
Natasha stopped laughing and turned her attention back to Steve. "Barton just meant you and Stark are leaders of this group, and it's not a good thing when you two fight."
Toni smirked as light blush formed on Steve's cheeks, which Toni couldn't help but find attractive. "Oh, you are just jealous," she replied as she stuck out her tongue at him.
Toni put on a small smile. "Geez, thanks," she said. "I feel so loved." Why was it so tough to keep up her normal facade? It was a struggle to smile, because she didn't want to smile. It was too much work to smile when she felt like crap.
"Why, Captain, that would be inappropriate!" she protested, loudly. "What would people say?" Everything that Toni had thought before had flown out the window as she stared in Steve's eyes. She could get lost his eyes for years, seeing how happy he was. Sure, she had seen Steve happy before both in the past and present, but this was a different level of happiness.
Clint was still annoyed and it showed to everyone round. He so annoyed that he was willing to pick a fight with Captain Rogers just so he could have something to do, something else to think about.
Toni wanted to hide her face as she caught the look Steve's face. "Now, now. Let the child have her fun," she said, trying to change the conversion. "You two are just too old to understand."
And, that was the scary part, not knowing if something was real. She couldn't trust herself, and she
Toni knew that, and she had no doubt that they would be asking her questions that she didn't want to answer. They would probably ask about her father, and she couldn't stand to talk about him or anything else. After they learned that she let countless people die, they would either think she was a heartless murderer, who let her father die-which she was-, or they would pity her, and she didn't want that. It was the last thing she wanted.
The Asset's mind froze, spotting a woman jogging through the streets. As he was high up in one of the many high rises, it was amazing that he could spot this dark haired Brunette on the crowded streets, but his eyes were glued to her. He could barely make out her face from this distance, but certain feelings came flooding back to him. Even with her name escaping him, he remembered one thing: she was
Toni knew what this woman was doing and she wasn't going to fall for it because that would be exactly what this woman wanted. She wanted Toni to think she was alone, because they wanted to turn her against the Camp. Besides her brain, she wasn't sure why they would want to, because she would probably make them murderous and she would end up dead. "Damn, only half? I was trying so hard to make the whole camp hate me." She reached for one of the gun, and even if was unless, it gave her mind some peace.
Pepper felt her heart race at that, because she knew this wasn't going to end well. Toni was always closed to others, never letting anyone in, though Rhodey and she could crack her shield at times. If something happened, she knew it would only be worse. The genius would never come out of her lab now, and it broke Pepper's heart.
Toni could do nothing but stand there as Peggy put the handcuff on her tightly and harshly pushed her forward.
Sam glanced between the two as the expression on his face softened. "No wonder the media eats you two up. You two are
He put his hands on her shoulders and looked her in the eye. "I want you safe, but there's no stopping you and I'm not going to try. I tried last time, remember? It didn't work." He stared silently into her eyes for a second before he added, "I know you can take care of yourself."
That concept was a new thing to her, never experiencing this before with anyone, and it scared her at times—well all the time. How could this have formed so fast and she not know? It grew like a wild vine without her knowing, and it was strong like a steel cable. There was no cutting or fighting it, as it grew like a rose torn. Again, the idea of it 'cutting' it made her ill—more so than she cared to admit, but it still was a shock to her brain to realize how she far she had fallen for the super soldier.
Also, A reviewer once asked me what Actress I would see playing Toni, and I could only think of two possible people. I was thinking either Rachel Emily Nichols or Roxanne McKee, but I don't know.
," she stated. "What makes you think I will? Me and authority don't get along." She let out a chuckle as she thought about all of the times Rogers tried to tell her what to do.
"He doesn't belong here," Bucky states, coldly. He glares at Sam for a second before turning back to Tony, sitting as close to the genius as he can.
Unlike Steve, Clint took a step forward as Pepper started to rock back and forward on her heels. "Maybe, you should let the genius breathe? Her face is turning blue."
Tony smiles, putting on a mask. He knows his best friend knows all of his masks, but he hopes Jim doesn't call him on it. "I am the best cuddlier."
Steve's hands balled at his side, because he knew exactly what he was going to do, and he didn't care what Fury or anyone said. "I-"
The Asset gently traced the side of her face, putting it to memory. Toni's skin was smooth to the touch, and it song to him like nothing else. Leaving her face, he twisted her hair in his finger, taking note of how soft her messy felt. Toni had not been tied down, laying unconscious on the bed. It would've looked like she had fallen asleep if it had not been the dried tears on her face. There was a feeling boiling deep within the Asset at seeing her like this, but he made no move to correct it. She was-
Tony knows he needs to calm down and take a step back, but there's so much bubbling inside of him that he can't. "I got this," he says, before turning off his comm. He knows his tone and sudden appearance has only caused worry along his team, but he doesn't care. He doesn't care if he hurts anyone's feeling. He needs to worry only about himself.
Toni felt herself shake as she backed into her father's headstone. Why was he doing this? Why couldn't he just let things be? Did she want him to leave her alone? She wasn't sure, because she wasn't sure if she could handle all of her guilt on her own. "No."
After Fury had flatline, Toni left the room giving them some time to themselves. She had never been any good at grief, with her own eating her up like a shark. With that scared person in mind, she left them alone to grieve, as there was no chance for her to insult him if she wasn't in the room. Usually, she wouldn't care to hold her mouth, but this was not the time for her mouth. Fury was dead and her Iron Man suit was out of commissions- though it wouldn't be for long.
Toni glanced back up at the mystery man, but the Bucky lookalike was gone, feeling like a blow to a stomach. It felt like someone had put their hand through her chest and pulling out her heart, and it was that feeling that made her want to chase after the man, but with the chair on her legs, it was harder said than done. Having lost the feeling in her legs, she was unable to kick the chair off her—not that she could even feel her legs-, and reaching back was painful. She had no idea why it felt like a hundred of pounds were on her legs, but it felt like—
Though Salty didn't jump at her outburst, he was clearly startled at it. "What are you talking about?"
Toni eyed his movements as he brought his hands up and softly cupped her face. "Nothing?" she asked with a smirk.
Stepping deeper into the lap, Bruce stopped at the hole. He gave it a meaningful look before he looked at Toni. "You know I found Steve at this spot once. You should've seen him. Granted I haven't know Steve long, I have never seen him so lost. Toni, he was
Natasha was sitting at the communication station, typing away, but she was also keeping a close eye on the Captain. She hadn't spoken a word in the last hour or so, and it was clear that she wouldn't be saying anything soon, though she was interested in their conversion. Her eyes were flicking between Steve and the monitor even time he spoke.
Toni took a deep breath as she pushed herself up. "There's some spare clothes for you in the dresser," she replied.
"No!" She protested strongly. She didn't need him to come and get her. She could and would get herself back to the town in one piece, and she didn't need him to come save her. "I got it. Just send the suit."
Suddenly feeling a hand on her shoulder, Toni flinched, almost jumping three feet in the air. Trying to control her heart beat, Toni looked up to see a smiling Bruce. Even in his exhaustion, he had a fond smile on his face as he stared down at her. He wasn't saying anything, but she knew he was checking on her. It seemed like he was the only one to have noticed her panic attack—no, not a panic attack. Toni Stark did not have a panic attack.
Was it bad that Toni wanted to turn her comms off? Normally, this small talk-this teasing didn't bother her, but for some reason it did. It got under her skin in ways that it annoyed her. Maybe, it was because she wasn't in the mood. Maybe, she had other things on her mind. She wasn't sure what, but it only made her push her suit harder. It made her want to distance herself.
The Asset gave the Senator a look before he stepped toward the window. He wasn't sure what drew him to the window as he had a mission to focus on. But, it seemed like he wasn't needed for this assignment as Rumlow had it under control.
"Oh, I feel so loved," Tony says, with a hand over his heart. "Is this why Rogers and Barnes are hiding from you people?"
In about ten minutes, they arrived outside of the apartment. "You need to tell him, Barnes" she said, trying to change the subject. Toni didn't want to talk about her anymore.
Still not saying a word, Toni scanned the room before flopping down on her soft, huge bed next to Rhodes, who had taken a seat at edge of the bed. Pepper was stiff and unmoving, as she stood in the center of the room. Her quietness could silence most people, and it was no different now. However, it was so much worse than before as Toni didn't know what brought this quietness on.
"About time you got home," a man interrupted as he entered the main room from what appeared to be a bedroom. He gave Rogers a smile before turning to eye her.
The flames and smoke forced them to the rafters as the entire building was being eaten by the flames. Barnes had wondered if they would ever be able to find Toni and get the hell out of this place. With each passing second, the flames had gotten worse, and the building started to shake and fall apart around them. As they stepped onto a higher level, another rumble echoed throughout the base, sending Barnes to the knees. Steve was able to stay on his feet. "Are you okay?" he asked.
You wouldn't think the man was hunched over due to how tall he stood in the shadows, but when he straightened up, he was half a foot taller than the Iron Man Suit, which meant he was over a foot taller than her out of it. That wasn't the only thing that shocked Toni, as he was bigger than his grace would lead her to believe. For the lack of a better word, he was stack of beef. Hidden under his black assassin wardrobe, Toni assumed were his Steve's level muscles, especially if he could keep up with the super soldier.
And I want to give a special thanks to wintersupersoldiers who has proofed this for me. :) She is great.
Though Toni wasn't as fragile as everyone thought she was, she could get used to Steve carrying her around. She could get used to him, holding her close as he wore a skin tight shirt that scratched across his chest, showing all of his muscles. Seriously, how did he get into that shirt? That in itself should be illegal, though it was her who brought it. So she would probably need to have herself arrested too? If so, she was not going down alone! He was going arrested for being so damn hot.
"He's having a difficult time getting power to it to see what it's supposed to do. Every time he gets any power to the device, it burns out everything connected to do it. Either he can't find enough power or there is short in the device and it is overloading everything around it," Peggy stated. "If only, we can get her to talk. That device could be useful against Hitler."
God, Toni missed JARVIS. How the hell did she survive without him? "Thanks, JARVIS," she uttered, stepping toward the flag pole in the middle of the camp. It had lost its solid, white colorings ages ago, and the rust stared to poke through; an abandoned American Flag hanged from the pole, untouched in years. The faded flag had seen better days as it had started to come apart at the ends. It was like the rest of the camp: forgotten. It looked like people just left, which was odd to the genius. She could never understand that concept.
He had the biggest smile on his face as he looked in her eyes. "I have seen you naked, Toni," he said, as his thumb caressed her cheek. "Why wouldn't I be attracted to you? Why wouldn't I want to kiss every inch of you?"
She took a seat across of Phillips and leaned forward. "I have no idea, but I can't sit here anymore and do nothing," she said quietly.
On the other hand, Maya's expression changed suddenly and panic took over. In a shaky form, she stumbled forward. "What?" she uttered as she reached for something-anything to support herself. "Killian, no!" she protested, terror setting in her eyes. "You can't. You don't know what it would do to the baby."
Toni narrowed her eyes at him in annoyance. "One, I'm fine, and two, that isn't what I was going to ask. However, I'm fine and capable of going out," she said. Why did everyone insist on treating her like a child?
Bars and clubs were still open and going strong; music was blasting, coming out into the streets from the numerous doors. People loitered in the streets and on the sidewalks, going from one place to place, and none of these people were quiet. Most were drunk or close to drunk, and they could barely walk, though none of them seem like they wanted to go home. No one wanted to go to sleep, even if they were already halfway there. These were the funny people, even if they were annoying to all hell.
Toni couldn't watch Schmidt and Zola leave the room as her head was forced back and a bucket of ice water was poured on her face. The water flowed into her nose and mouth, and her eyes were forced shut as the ice pelted her. She let out a sigh of relief when the water stopped; however, that was short lived. She was ripped from the chair and thrown face first into a hot tub of water, which singed her skin.
Barnes took a deep breath. "I'm sorry that I overstepped. I won't do it again." He stood up and turned away from her. "And just in case you wanted to know, Steve has been very worried about you. I would ask that you aren't this harsh with him as you were with me. He is too naive to handle it, and I'm not sure he would be able to handle that with me gone." With that, he headed to his room.
"I don't-" Toni started but feeling a hand on her knee, she froze. It shocked her more than anything as she didn't know how she felt about it. Why would Barnes put his hand on her knee? Did that mean anything? Only a few people had ever put their hands on her knee and either they were family members or someone she was about to have sex with. She wasn't going to sleep with Barnes, so what did this mean? In disbelief, she stared at his hand.
Howard glanced at the now opened box and focused on the metal tags inside. "Dog tags," he said, staring at the engraving in the metal. He was unable to read the names, but he didn't need to read the tags to know who they belonged to. "Rogers and Barnes?"
." He is all but yelling when he spits out those words. Yes, Tony fucken cares and it's killing him that Barnes is about to go into a meltdown, but that isn't his problem anymore. It's Steve's, and if Tony helps or turns to him, it will kill him later. And he needs to move on.
"Gabriel Jones. Gabe for short," he stated as he stuck out his hand to her, but she made no motion to shake it. "Rogers asked me to keep an eye on you while he's gone."
"Miss, are you okay?" She could hear the stranger run to her and she could feel his hand on her. "Please answer me."
"And the Colonel?" Clint asked, giving her a look. It was clear that he was not a fan of the nickname.
"That might be interesting to watch," Tony states as he straightens himself up. "Can I video type that?"
She felt him laugh before she heard it. "See, I'm not that bad," he said as he turned from the window toward the door.
"Why don't you come with us?" Dugan stated as he wrapped his arm around her shoulder. Toni glared, but she didn't shrug him off. "Come show us how good you're at poker."
He didn't need anyone to tell him that she hadn't slept in days, because he could see it, feeling it. She couldn't fight her way out of a wet paper bag in her current state. He also knew that he wouldn't be able to get through to her until she slept. In a sleep derived sleep haze, she wouldn't be able to listen to reason. Being awake for days, it was like she was drunk, and she was unable to think clearly, logically. "Let's get you to bed."
Surprised, Pepper spun around quickly, stepping back to Toni. "Toni," she called, as the tension died in her shoulders. In a few long steps, Pepper pulled Toni into her arms and hugged her tight. "I love you, and even if I can't be there next to you, I will always love you. Always."
"Are you okay, Stark?" Phillips asked as he stepped to her side. His hands were tucked behind his back.
"No, you don't get to do this," Bucky snaps, pain present in his voice, as he follows after the limped Tony. "You don't get to be stupid, almost get yourself killed, and run away. You don't-"
Pepper let out a harsh sigh. "A warning about you and Captain Rogers. The Media is having a field day with this."
The genus doesn't know when he came home the night before, but he's on the couch in the lab under a blanket. He's in a state of confusion as he doesn't remember falling asleep on the couch. He remembers coming home from his horrible date (He couldn't get
Shaking his head, Barnes smiled. "I thought that there was no need to forgive me as you didn't care about me."
He gave her a look before closing the distance again, but just as he placed his lips on hers, there was a loud, rapid knock on the car window. Steve let out a heavy groan as he broke away from Toni. "Natasha," he breathed out, noticing the master assassin.
Toni had to admit, though not out loud or to him, that he had a nice smile. "I don't like to rely on people. And I do remember some things, just not a whole lot." She decided it would be foolish to have total memory lost.
Sounding nothing like JARVIS, Zola uttered, "Accessing archive." His face disappeared on the computer screen, showing old footage of the Red Skull. It was sickening, videos playing in front of them like a home movie. "HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly."
Toni glared at Barnes. She wasn't going to kill Steve, just maim him enough to remember that he shouldn't ever doubt her.
His heart binged when he thought of how he had rejected her after Bucky's death because of Phillips' advice. He told – no… more like ordered Steve not to start a relationship with her, which Steve didn't like. Sure, the Colonel had a point and there was no need for love in war, but he had no right to order him not to start a relationship. But before he could snap, Phillips told Steve that she needed time, that he shouldn't attempt a relationship with her. He told him that he should honor Barnes, his best friend, and just be a friend to Toni. After seeing how broken she was after she learned of Bucky's death, he had known Phillips was right.
Steve stepped toward the door as he tried to stop her; however, he should've known better. He should've known that would only cause a fight.
, Rollins and the rest of the gang would not have betrayed them like the shits that they were. Barton was teammates with these men, he had fought beside them in some of the deadly places on earth. They had shared jokes and meals. Yes, the Archer had done the same when he went undercover, befriending criminals, but this was different. They were supposed to be the good guys. They were supposed to be the heroes, but yet, here they were. It hurt more than he cared to admit. He was just fucken glad that he didn't mention Laura and his kids to any of those fuckers.
There was something about the woman that Toni didn't like, but she couldn't figure it out. However, what she did know was that she didn't like be forced to do anything. "What happened?" she asked again.
"G-go away," Toni hissed. She couldn't deal with him when she had an aching head. No, she couldn't deal with him at all.
Erskine was silent for a few minutes. "I don't believe she's a spy for Hitler, but we cannot be sure that she's not a criminal or a danger to the city."
Toni was used to fake comments. "It keeps me alive. That's all you need to know." She wasn't going to go into the history of the reactor with his man or her father.
The Brooklyn Twins smile at that, and their smiles are the biggest smiles that he has ever seen. "We love you, too," they utter together.
He wasn't afraid of her anger, and he was willing to push her, because it was the only way to get the truth out of her. "I…" Steve started but froze, unsure if he could get the words out. "I…" He was afraid to say it, because he had no idea of how she would react. She had pushed him away in both times.
She didn't know why that was so hard to do, but it was. Was it really that hard to breathe? Her mind wasn't kicking back like the pain was. She felt like she was on fire again.
She eyed him for a second before taking glancing around. She caught a few eyes on them, which was just another signal that Peggy was right about that rumor. "I don't talk to Barnes about my emotions," she responded with a chuckle.
"I leave shortly. I'm just waiting for Steve to get dressed. He's walking me to the bus stop," he said with a smile. "But…" He paused as he thought for a second. He pulled her into a bear hug. Toni was utterly confused and not sure how to handle this. "I will miss your spunk."
There was still a sadness in his voice that Toni didn't like. "It is," she replied, forcing herself not to reach for the dog tags. They seemed to become so important to her in so little time.
At first, Toni assumed it was an EMP, which didn't worry her too much. Knowing that would be the first thing her enemies would throw at her, she had made an EMP shield—though she had not tested it against every EMP yet. There was no telling if this was one that could overpower it, but that wasn't important here. This grenade was so much more than an EMP, not that she had time to ponder that. One second it was quiet and the next, all hell broke loose. In a blink of an eye, a loud piecing scream rung through the Iron Man speaker like an hurricane. If JARVIS was talking to her, she wouldn't know. She couldn't hear anything besides the earsplitting shriek, which made her want to rip her ears out.
Peggy eyed her before copying Toni's pose. "It's something going around the camp." She didn't explain.
Tony refuses to allow his emotions to get the better of him. There're innocent people who need help, and he refuses to allow another person to die on his watch. Besides, this isn't anything that he can't handle. He's fucken Tony Stark, and he doesn't cry. He doesn't sit around and do nothing. He's a fucken Genius, and he knows technology better than anyone else in the world. He's fucken brilliant, and there isn't anything he doesn't know. He knows how to look and find hidden frequencies. He knows how robots and droids work. He knows how Operating Systems work and collect data, and he can see flaws just by looking. He can see one now, a delay whenever they morph. He can see the lag in the OS, and he can see the flaws in his head. He can see it all.
"You don't have a heart for one." Toni let out a chuckling sigh. "But okay, Mother," she mocked, as she scooted away on her ass from the engine block and slowly got to her feet. Thanks to Steve, she had finally gotten her first full night of sleep in
Jim didn't answer right away, and though Steve couldn't see him, he could almost see and hear his locked jaw and grinding teeth. "I trusted you with her," he finally snapped. "I trusted you to be there! I trusted you to take care of her! I thought you would be good for her. Thought you would be
"Are you okay?" Steve asked. He hadn't seen Bruce drink before, because there was always a fear that he could hulk out and hurt someone. "Are you sure you should be drinking?" Though he was a super soldier, there was doubt that he could stop the big guy.
" he snapped. No one was going to tell him that he didn't love Toni, no one. "Colonel, what happened?" he demanded in his Captain's voice. He was tired of this game and he just wanted Jim to spit it out already. "What happened?" he asked, demanding. He could feel a few heads turn toward him, and Steve wondered if Natasha could hear Jim as he was speaking so loudly. He didn't doubt it, judging by Natasha's stiff form. "Jim," he said, his voice calming again.
"Did…I miss something?" Rhodes asked, as he stepped into the room. With a raised eyebrow, he glanced between Clint, Bruce, and Pepper, who were all glaring at each other. The tension could be cut with a knife.
"I don't think I ever had any fat on my bones," he said, as he lifted his head to get a good look on her face. "Even before the serum, I was all skin and bones." He remembered those times as being a punching bag to everyone around them. He remembered the looks and cruel treatment he got from everyone including Bucky, but never from her. Toni never treated him differently, though she at times expected more.
"Well, you were his moral compass," Toni stated softly. "Mine too if you think about it, though I might not listen. There is no fun listening." She fought the urge lean her head on his shoulder and lowered herself to her knees.
Toni squeezed the box. "Have you not seen any time traveling movies?" she questioned, sadly but with a smile.
Toni let out an annoyed chuckle as the damn device shocked her yet again; however, she was closer in finding a solution as the shock wasn't as wild as before, though no solution would matter if she couldn't power it. No matter what she tried, she couldn't get enough power to it, and it wouldn't retain the power. "Maybe, a more stable power source might work out the kinks. Or I can put in so much power into it that it won't matter that it's spitting some back," she stated as she ran another diagnostic on her phone-turned scanner.
Toni's head was spinning. Yes, she expected to be overwhelmed, but she didn't expect this. "Stop," she howled, feeling ill. Her head started to hurt.
This was the man—Brock, if she remembered correctly…not that she cared if she didn't—that she had met in the park after she thought she saw Barnes, which again was impossible. This was the man, who helped her up. This was man, who she had gotten a bad vibe from. This man worked for SHIELD? She knew the fact that he was agent could be why she hated him. It was an automatic thing with all agents and government types, but there something different. And to make things worse, he was in the park? Why the hell was he in the park? Was he following her?
Rumlow and Pierce gave him a look before turning to each other and whispering to the other. They were attempting to keep their words to themselves, but being enhanced, the Asset heard every word. They planned to break Toni, to bend her to their will by any means necessary besides reconditioning as they feared that would break the genius's mind, which they wanted more than anything. The Asset, their weapon and tool, did not like the idea of turning her into a tool like him, but if it kept her near, he would do anything. She called to him on the DNA level, and he would not lose her.
on her shoulders, and anyone who knew Toni could see this. She never knew when to stop, never knew when it was too much, which would be her down fall, and Steve knew this. She also carried everything on her back, blaming herself for everything-though Steve had that issue at times. Some could say that Toni and he had a lot in common, but he knew when to call for help…Toni did not.
he had fallen for Toni. "We've other things to worry about," he replied, choosing not respond to Clint's jest. "We still need to figure out if this is related to the items stolen from Blackhawk."
A color flier caught her eyes. It was an army recruitment poster, which had seen better days. The ends of the poster had started to peel and rip. The bright colors had started to lose its color, making her wonder how long it had been hanging there. She was surprised that it hadn't been replaced, considering there was an army recruitment station a block down. Toni could see the long line from here. "I wonder if R-Steve is there." She wasn't sure if he would be, considering their conversation a few nights ago. She really hoped he wasn't an idiot and gave up. If he did, she was going to beat his ass.
He picked up the pencil again to add streets signs and other small details, but he dropped it a second later when he realized where he was. This ugly building was located in the same spot that he had found Toni bloody and injured, calling out for help. This was where it all happened. This was the spot that she traveled back in time, though there was no way to tell if this was when she did so.
Steve recognized the voice belonging to Pepper Potts, who he had seen a few times since Toni had disappeared. Pepper didn't like to be in the tower lately, calling it haunted, and Steve would have to agree. Even if the tower lacked a homely feeling, Toni's present was everywhere in the Tower. There wasn't a room in the building that didn't feel like her and her huge ego.
"Well, if it isn't the star spangled man with a plan. And what's your plan for today?" Phillips asked, annoyed. Why was he here? He didn't have time for this. He had condolence letters to write and he had to figure out what he was going to tell Stark about his daughter.
t be erroring… it had to be her. Where was Steve when she needed him? He was her rock, her base. He kept her grounded, when nothing else worked. He would tell her that she wasn't crazy, refusing to let her believe it. "JARVIS, enough," she ordered.
"Time travel," she replied, still struggling to keep a smile on her face as she broke free of his arms. "It's more strenuous then sex, but sex is more rewarding." As the words came out of her mouth, she felt like she was trying too hard.
Shaking from the wind and weak muscles, Toni struggled to push herself to her knees with one arm. Her left arm was pretty much useless. I can do this, she thought as blood dripped from her head. Her mind started to go and it was getting harder to think. "H-help," she begged, her throat screaming in pain. Her breathing, if possible, was becoming more difficult, which made her take hollow breaths. It hurt to breath in deep.
Killian gave Toni a hard look, almost chilling; however, it was gone in a blink of an eye, replaced with a smile. "I was teased for a completely different reason," he replied as he dimmed the lights without her permission. "Now that we got that behind us. Let's get down to business. After years of dodging the President's ban on 'immoral biotech research', my think tank now has a little something in the pipeline. It's an idea we like to call Extremis."
He looked into her eyes. "I am still in Asgard with Thor." He said it with such a distaste that she thought the room would catch fire.
God, Toni would've eaten these idiots alive if she was in the right mindset. She would've roasted them, and Clint would be laughing at the destruction she left behind. However, she wasn't. He wanted to ignore it, pretend that the genius was okay, but they all noticed the ghost lingering in her eyes. They had noticed the fake smile that she sported. They noticed her guilty eating her alive. She was drowning in it, and it was clouding her judgement, making her doubt herself. Making Tony think she was crazy. Clint doubt she could kick Rollins and friends' asses in her current state, which worried the Archer.
As another man fell by his hand, an explosion echoed across the compound, shaking the floor. After the roar of the explosion died, faint sounds of combat could be heard in the background, though they didn't last long. The battle was over in seconds, and the Asset spotted the fake blond and his goons a minute later as they escaped the compound. They didn't seem to be any kind of hurry, even if the sounds of another battle suddenly roared. The Assassin in black watched as they climbed into three dark SUVs. Hesitating, it went against his programing to leave witnesses alive, but he also wanted to kill them for touching the Brunette.
reasons why she hated her father. He basically abandoned her to nannies, as he didn't have time for her. Yes, she was still bitter about it. Sure, she grew up fine (some would probably disagree on that like the asshole Future Rogers), but it wasn't the same. Though she didn't play as a child, she had seen other fathers with their children and she had desired to have that same relationship.
She shook her head. "Toni, keep focus." Rogers had always said that she got distracted way too easily, and she would yell at him each time he said it, but now, she guessed he was right. She glanced around the room before rounding the corner, which brought the rest of the small apartment into view. To her joy, she didn't see anyone, which was weird. Why would anyone leave a stranger alone in their home? That was just stupid. "Idiots."
them, which was a clue enough for her that it was time to go. Or the clue could've been one of the ladies calling after Toni saying that she could do whatever Toni wanted.
With a deep sigh, Toni leaned back in the CEO chair as she had signed something for the nth time. She had lost track of how many forms she had signed, which was plain exhausting in and of itself. Yes, she had been CEO of this very company before, and it had done it successfully for years, but this was exhausting. Even if it was just because she thought she was going die at the time, the genius was glad that she had put Pepper in charge of the company. Stepping back had been great for the genius, and there was no doubt that she would've gone crazy— well more so, if she had to do this job for any longer. She just wanted to build and invent things, not run a whole company.
However, it was a kick to Toni's stomach as it was a reminder that their pain was her fault. She was allowing this to go on, and she didn't deserve to kid around while they suffered. She hated herself right then.
She thought, listening to them fighting about their 'relationship.' When did they get into a relationship? She kind of felt bad for Peggy, because that was one relationship that wouldn't last.
"For a dame, you have a mouth," Rogers said as he walked over to her. As he took the pan from her, he didn't notice the glare she was giving him.
Bucky's grip on the genius tightens, almost painful, as he closes his eyes and takes in another deep breath. "It… I'm so fucken sorry, Tony! So fucken sorry. It's…just…" He says, struggling to get it out. "The things… Hydra…" He closes his eyes as he takes in another dose of Tony's scent. "There're times… that I…forget where I'm. Thinking that I'm back with t-them." Steve's arms tighten around them, and James relaxes in them. "And at t-times, these nightmares…turn into night terrors, and… I… turn violent."
She glanced at his face before she looked back down at the box. She couldn't talk to him for the same reason why she didn't tell Barnes and Rogers the truth. "I can't talk to anyone."
This was why the smell of pine threw her when she stepped into the communal lounge. It was that aroma, which attacked her as she entered the room. It was almost overwhelming, taking over everything. It was like a Christmas lot with the pine and peppermint smell that developed in the room. Judging by the strength of the aroma, this smell was fresh and recent. Unable to stop herself, she flashed back.
When did Steve become so good at kissing? Seriously, how? Who the hell was he kissing? He had to be practicing, because there was no way her Shrimp was this good. Before the serum, he was a small, awkward man, who couldn't get a girl, a
"Miss Stark has connected the device to an Arc reactor," Jarvis answered. "However, the device drained the reactor and fried all of the circuits, making it impossible to repair."
Toni took a deep breath and let him take it. She did her best to ignore the feeling of his hand on hers. Once she was sure he had it, she let it go and hopped off the couch. It was then that she realized how close she was to him. Turning away from him, she hid her face as she didn't want him to see her red face. She didn't want Steve Roger to know that he did this to her. "I got the kitchen," she stated, changing the subject.
Originally, the only reason why he's hiding is because of Steve Freaking Rogers. It isn't because he hates him as that's the farthest thing from the truth. No, No, No. He does
Tony feels everyone's eyes on him, and he hates it. He downright hates it, and he wants to punch everyone in the face for looking at him. Plus, he really hates how the Red-She-Devil is forcing his hand, because this will only hurt more in the end. Sometimes love isn't enough, and it isn't like they can love him. They're afraid to even say those words to each other in front of him. So why is she doing this? Why can't she leave things alone? She hates him for crying out loud! Or maybe, this is her goal! Pain and suffering
Steve reached for a towel on the bed and gently ran the towel up her arm. Again, she was watching him, her eyes following his every movement. He dried one arm at time before he turned his attention to her chest. He fought back his blush as his thump passed over her collar bone. Her skin, even with all the scars, felt soft under his touch, and he could feel his blood rushing. He could feel his heart race as his hand grazed over her sports bra.
Toni walked into the apartment to find Rogers on the couch with a depressed look on his face. "You tried to enlist again, didn't you?" she asked as she took a seat next to him.
How dare he hurt her? He took a step forward, ready to attack her; however, before he could step out and kill this man, the woman defended herself, sending the man to the ground.
"Fire Rocket," he called again as he jumped in front of her. His face was all bruised and there was a clear limp in his step, which was probably why he was still in camp and not out in the field.
For some reason that he could not understand, the idea excited the Asset, and he didn't know what to make of the feeling bubbling in his chest at the sight of her. He had no idea of what this feeling was exactly or why he liked the feeling, but he did. To feel like this and have the woman, he would do whatever his handlers wanted of him, and if they want to use him to make her submit, he would do so, even if it didn't make any sense.
"You thought what? That if you're nice, I would have sex with you?" she asked, hissing. The man just looked at her as if she had shot him. "Just leave me alone."
Toni kind of wished she was asleep for this part of the conversion, because she didn't want to listen to them talk about her. She hated when people discussed her like she was something needed to be fixed. She didn't need to be fixed; she didn't want to be fixed. She needed to be left alone to deal with her pain.
If she could cry, Toni would be right now, and it wasn't due to the painful ache in her shoulders and arms for dragging her suit. She hated fighting with Steve, hated it. Sure, she loved to banter, and she loved to annoy him with her quips, but she hated fighting with him. She hated the disappointed look in his eyes whenever they did, as it drilled into her very soul, breaking her down. He had a point, because threating a terrorist wasn't smart, especially giving out her home address. But, that man hurt Happy, and that was unacceptable. Everyone she loved was strictly untouchable, as she refused to lose anyone in her life, which was why her fight with Steve hurt so much. She couldn't lose that man. She just couldn't, even if she wasn't good for him.
"I can spell," Phillips stated quickly. Though he didn't like to be ordered around, he understood where Rogers was coming from. "I have signed more of these condolence letters today than I would care to count. But the name does sound familiar. I'm sorry." Though he had used Barnes to spy on Toni, he didn't know the man well, but Phillips did feel sad about losing a soldier like that.
Clint's hands went to his ears. "I so need to live somewhere else. The images! Where is the bleach?"
JARVIS may have told Steve exactly where Toni was, but he didn't need the AI to tell him. He knew exactly where she would be as there was only one place that the genius felt at home: her lab. There was no denying that it was her safe haven, the first place that she ran to, whenever the need arose. For her, it was where she felt like herself, and for everyone else, it was the Pentagon, the hardest place for anyone to be invited. She guarded it like nothing else, building high walls to protect it.
Steve laughed, reaching for the towel to dry Toni's legs, which glistened under the bright lights. He started from the bottom of her legs, as he wiped her legs dry. He was careful around the ankle, pressing as softly as she could, and once it was dried, he eyed it, pondering how badly she had hurt herself. He may have some medical training as did most soldiers, but he had no idea of how to check an ankle to see if it was broken. He would have Bruce check in the morning.
Toni stared at him for a few seconds, comprehending what he had just said. "What?" she uttered, not expecting that from him.
Sam, letting out a sigh, shook his head as he crossed to the phone. "Hello?" he answered, picking up the receiver. Sam didn't say anything else before he was handing the phone over to Natasha. "For you." He said holding out the fold. His stare hard. "He said to put on speaker phone."
With her heart beating heavily in her chest, Toni glanced at Steve and almost panicked at seeing the pain in his face. Though Steve could stare down the Red Skill with a deadly glance, he was speechless. His face was filled with emotions; his eyes were drowning in guilt. She didn't blame him, madder at herself for putting those ideas in his head. "See better," she said, looking back at the angry bruise. It was darker now, viler, but that meant it was getting better. "Looks so much better than the love marks you have given me." She added with a wink.
What she really wished she had was a bullet proof vest, but they didn't have those in this time. Why didn't they have them in this time? What would happen if she was shot at? Depending on where she was hit, she would be dead… Was this really a good idea? She wasn't really trained to go into combat, though Barnes had given her some tips. Salty had even taken her aside and gave her a quick run through, though Toni wasn't sure that was enough considering what happened the last time. She had combat experience, but that was with the Iron Man suit and not hand to hand combat.
Frustration filled Toni as she stared down the barrel of the gun. What was his point of him taking it? Was it just to show her how weak she was? Or was he going to take her back to Phillips and call her traitor? "Don't count me out," she said through her teeth.
He narrowed his eyes at her before shaking his head. "You're way too comfortable," he stated. "Where did I go wrong? Maybe, I should lock you up with your father. Maybe, he can get you to behave."
If she wasn't frightened before, she was now; Pepper's expression was pure fear. "Let us in! I need to see Toni."
Natasha stood back. "I remember Stark telling me about this. She told me that if the lab closed itself off like this, it wouldn't be good." She took a deep breath. "She said, while laughing, she would most likely be dead or worse." There was a grim expression on her face.
Zola, who was holding a clip board in his hand, glanced up at Schmidt. His hesitation was clearly visible in his eyes and Toni almost felt bad for him; however, that went out the window in seconds as she remembered that he had helped to torture her.
, him! Which is a good counterbalance for his over the top insecurities. Serious, his insecurities are the size of Mount Rushmore, which makes it's surprising that those two put up with him and his baggage. He expected—still expects them to run for the hills every time he does something stupid, which is quite often considering he's a fucken genius who likes to test his limits.
She looked at him. "I don't care! Maybe, it would be best if they did," she yelled, pushing him away. She didn't care about anything, she didn't care about her stalker, and she didn't care if she was danger. She just needed to get away. "Let me go."
"We weren't, so drop it." Barton sounded annoyed. Barton and Banner were always coming to her defense as they seemed to understand her the best after Pepper and Rhodey.
JARVIS responded before Natasha could, granted the assassin had no interest in responding. "There is no use, Agent Romanoff," the AI responded, as the control panel on the wall suddenly turned black. "Though Miss. Stark made my firewalls impenetrable, I must insist you cease your actions."
The masked the man reached—Toni's heart pounding loudly in her ears at this point- forward to pick her up, but before he could touch her, a certain shield flew through the air, cutting through swelling fear. There was no denying the famous shield as it spun through the air, playing a familiar song with Steve not far behind it. Toni wasn't sure where he came from, but he leaped down from the sky like an avenging angel. His expression masked, but Toni could read it: angry belong belief. Now, she wasn't sure if that was directed at her or the man, but Steve was not happy.
"Also, it's Christmas…" As she said it, she didn't understand why it was important, because that was the last thing on her mind. In the past, it had been at the back of her mind, as she hadn't had anyone to celebrate with, but now, it felt important to be with Steve. "I swear to make this up to you…but d-does that promise mean anything? How many time have I said that? Steve… God, I'm so sorry. I'm a screw up." Even in the freezing cold, tears started to form in her eyes, threating to fall. "And I'm sorry in advance because…I can't come home just yet. I need to find this guy, and you gotta stay safe. That's all I know, and I don't care if you're Captain America, because I'm going to protect your beautiful ass from this. This is my mess, and you can't be hurt. I
Toni glanced up, looking him over. "Skully isn't that scary." She tried to shrug it off as nothing. She didn't need them worrying.
Toni glanced at him from the corner of her eyes before she looked down at the device. For a few seconds, she found herself staring at the device.
"I'm old fashion, Tony. Needed to hear it," Steve says as he leans forward and catches Tony's lips with his. He sucks on Tony's bottom lip. He keeps a firm hold on Tony's face as he fights for dominance. It's like a battle going on in his mouth, and it doesn't end until Bucky pulls Tony from Steve.
Steve stared at where the glass doors were supposed to be. "Wait, what is this?" From floor to ceiling, metal doors blocked the lab entrance. In big block bright yellow lettering, the word caution was plastered against the huge metal doors.
Though she knew better than to talk to a stranger- you never know what could and would end up on the news-, Toni took a seat next to Sam, while avoiding looking directly at him. "I'm not weak," she repeated, though she wasn't sure who she was talking to. Sam? Herself? Who the hell was she trying to kid?
Natasha let out a chuckle as she eyed the bulb flying up and down in the air. "Well, you have a big mouth on you," she said. "Sometimes I think it's worse than Stark's."
Just like that, it felt like his mind had exploded. "What?" he asked, unable to wrap his mind around what the agent had said. Was he saying what Steve hoped he was saying? Was Toni really back? Has she returned to him?
"Colonel," Peggy greeted, interrupting. She took a seat across from Salty and Toni. Her glare had changed to a smug look.
She punched Toni hard in the face. "Maybe, I can tell Schmidt that there was an accident. I don't know what makes you so special," she spit.
It was too much to handle at the moment, and she did what she did best: she ran. Taking a break from everything, she disappeared into the woods again, but she wasn't alone. Barnes was with her, as he became her shadow lately. She wasn't sure if it was just because Salty had told him to or if he was trying to make up for being an ass. The reason didn't matter, because his presence was relaxing, even if he told her that she was being stupid.
She got to her feet and headed to the door, wanting to follow the Commander, but she never got passed the door. Morita was standing in front of the door, blocking her exit. "You make such a great door," Toni teased, when he wouldn't move.
Toni groans, because she didn't need her AI to tell her that, even if she didn't want to admit it. "JARVIS," she uttered softly, feeling her knees buckle. If it wasn't for the suit, she would be face down on the ground, but her protective AI wouldn't allow that. He was always there for her, even when she didn't know it.
The very thought of going back into the bar scared her; she couldn't face that man, though she wasn't sure why she was so scared. He couldn't hurt her when she was surrendered by people, and there was no way that Barnes, even if he was distracted by some girl, would let anything happen to her. "I'm going to head back," she announced.
man have to touch her? Why did that man have to have her? He wasn't sure, but soon, he wouldn't be able to recall anything. Soon, he would forgot that woman all over again. Soon, he wouldn't have to worry about that man taking her from him as he wouldn't remember anything.
Steve and Toni, with helmets off, were doing sideway glances at each other. He knew she was sizing him up with that intense glare of hers, which he had come to love; however, this look was different than the ones he was used to. They were cold, non-trusting, and he hated it. He wanted her to trust him again, which would be a battle.
Time Travel had been anything but fun, causing only trouble. Her memories were the biggest mess, which at first she didn't notice; however, the more she thought back, the more she remembered. These memories—if they were memories. More like flashes- weren't clear. It was a fog with her conflicting memories, though most of the early memories of her father and their time together were clear. It was the later memories that seemed to blur and change. Toni knew it was her fault for changing history, but she refused to take total blame for that. She blamed that on Damn Loki as well. If she really thought about it, it was totally his fault.
"What?!" Toni uttered, her eyes huge. "If you like the floor so much, you can sleep on it!" She played angry, trying to sound hurt—though she was not fooling anyone. There was a smiling Toni underneath it.
Then she would be getting drunk ass wasted in the hopes that she could forgot, forget that her father was dead. To forget that she was a failure yet again. She wanted to forget all the lives that were lost because of her.
He glanced at her before eyeing the door. "If you don't know, then there's no point," he stated as he stepped toward the door.
Tony's chest tightens as Bucky's words go straight to his pants. He has imagined how it would feel like to be fucked into the bed by the both of them, but now, it will happen. "Oh, I will hold you too it," he says with a grin.
Toni had long since given up on trying to get a cell signal and was now placing as much distance between her and metal armed assassin as she could. It was just harder said than done. Though she was getting used to the pain, she was still feeling the car accident throughout her body, like someone was continually poking her with needles. Her ankle was still sore, feeling more unsteady with each step, and her head was still throbbing, almost to the point of tears. She tried to close her eyes and force herself to take a few deep breaths, but that only made it worse. It was getting hard to even think with pain. All she wanted to do was stop.
The nurse moved around Phillips and stepped toward the IV bag. Toni eyed the nurse with a penetrating scowl as she fought her father. "Please, don't," she begged.
He doesn't need to see Steve and Bucky to know that there's panic on their faces. "W-What are you talking about?" Steve asks, shaky. His tone is very unSteve like, and it almost makes Tony do a doubt take. Barnes, on the other hand, is extremely silent and standing very stiff, almost like he is a statue.
"Or maybe, she does care," Schmidt said, not turning away from Rogers. "Imagine what she will do when I kill you."
Kicking off the blanket, Toni shuffled herself to the railing and felt for the leveler to release it. After a few minutes of struggling, she felt the leveler and pushed it in. The railing fell, pulling her down with it. Pushing herself up a little, she stared at the heart monitor. Will these machine alarms go off if I pull these off my chest? If they did, her escape would be blown, but she had to risk it.
Before Toni could react, Barnes rushed forward, grabbed her hand, and twisted it, disarming her. She stumbled back, landing on her ass. "Can you now?" he asked as he trained the gun on her.
She turned back to the bed and took her normal spot; however, it wasn't long before she was disturbed again. This time it was by the Colonel, who looked like he was hit by a bus. If he hadn't had thrown her in a cell, she would've been worried about him.
She jumped at the voice. "What the hell?!" she yelled as she turned to Dugan, who was standing over her.
Natasha and Clint laughed louder. "I like how worked up he's getting," Clint crossed to his teammates. "Are you sure, Captain?"
Shaking her head, she got to feet and shook the snow off. With a deep breath, she rolled up the folder, lifted up the back of her jacket and stick it into her pants pocket. After making sure it was secure, she made her way toward Howard and her device.
Before Toni could walk into the room, she was pulled into Bruce's awaiting arms. Her arms were pinned against his warm chest with her head tucked under his chin. He kept a firm grasp on her as if he was afraid that she could disappear right in front of him. "Toni," he said, softly. "…Toni, how are you here?"
"T-Toni," Maya muttered, sweating and visibly shaking, as she tried to crawl her way to Toni. "I a-a..."
she thought as she took a few steps toward her. She hated when Peggy was upset. "Hello, Agent," she stated as she held the bag over her shoulder.
Bucky turns to Steve slightly, giving him a look. "No, he doesn't get to do this, and you agree with me. I know you do."
The Asset stood a ways back, hiding in a shadows of a few buildings, but he could still make out the Brunette and Beefy Blond as they made their way through the crowd of reporters. He could see the well placed mask on the Brunette as the blond hovered close to her. Ignoring the anger growing inside of him at the sight of the blond men, the Asset focused on the brunette, eyeing her every detail. For a while, he wanted to observe the woman as she stepped away from the Hospital and toward a car. He wanted to study the blank emotion on her face, trying to understand what made her so special—so different. After a few long seconds and for reasons that he couldn't understand, he could tell that the blank expression on the woman's face was a lie. He could tell the carefully placed and constructed expression on her face was a mask, intending to hide her emotion, and he couldn't understand how he knew this.
It took Toni a few minutes to catch up, as even Rogers' slow walk was a speed walk. Also, as her body was still sore, she had a difficult time running or jogging. She kept tripping over her own feet. She was only to catch him because some officer had stopped to speak with him. "Rogers," she called when she got within a few feet from him.
Steve forced himself to breathe through his nose. He was already disillusioned to SHEILD, but Natasha, though she may not show it, believed in SHIELD with everything she had. Believed in what they were doing. They pulled the Black Widow and turned her. They were new family. While Steve felt betrayed, among other things, he could only imagine what she was feeling.
Her father's name froze in her mind, and she could think of nothing else. "What? Bet?" she uttered, wondering where her words went. Her arms wrapped around herself, as she tried to keep warm. Did it get colder?
Toni wasn't sure how to answer that, even if she wanted to answer that. With a sigh, she glanced at Steve's blue cotton blue shirt and pulled at it, trying to get a good hold on him. "You have your shield with you," she uttered faintly.
Toni was in shock, never expecting for Steve to get so many shovel talks. She was expecting to get them instead, granted she hadn't seen Romanoff yet. There was no telling what that woman would say to her, or do to her.
Getting as close to the ground as she could, she cut out a small hole in the fence, just big enough for her to squeeze through. "Urgh," she uttered as she dragged herself through the sticky mud. She could feel the mud and leaves stick to her and feel the bugs crawling on her skin. Even though she wasn't a girly girl, she was never a fan of bugs, and right now, there was a spider on her face. She was fighting the urge to scream and freak out.
"You would be so lucky!" She said as she crossed to the tent's entrance. "Imagine what she could be like if she did!"
"I am impressed by you, Sark," he stated as he grabbed her bobbing head. She did not have the strength to do anything, even to keep her eyes opened not that she wanted to look at him. "I have not seen many men, who can last through that torture, but you have."
With smile on her face, Toni kicked off the thin sheet and rolled out of the bed. With her feet on the ground, she redid her messy hair before she made her way to the kitchen in the tiny apartment. The worn wooden floor was chilling beneath her feet, and it sent shivers up her spine. "Slaving away in there!" she grinned, as she crossed into the kitchen.
"How is she?" Natasha asked from the doorway. With her arms folded across her chest, she was leaning against the doorway, eyeing them.
"Tell them, Stark," Wanda commands, interrupting the yelling, as she looks dead at him. In seconds, the room silences as they look between the Genius and the witch. There's a look in her eyes, a telling look, and it's clear that she won't take no as an answer.
"Oh, that's how it is." Steve said, returning the look as they shook hands. "And you." He added, turning to Toni and drawing her out of her thoughts. Like in the movies, he pulled her into his arms and dipped her. Toni was so thrown off by the move that she didn't fight—not that she would. He placed a heavy kiss on her lips, putting as emotions as he could. She felt loved.
Barnes turns away and pushes off the door frame as Steve takes a step forward. "You want us join us, Tony?" Rogers asks, smiling as big as he can.
"Do you believe I'm that prisoner? That's crazy." The gun was still pointed toward her, but it wasn't going to make Toni sweat. This wasn't the first time she had a gun in her face and she knew it wouldn't be the last.
? Why did it matter to them if Toni didn't come to D.C.? He didn't blame her, not when he didn't want to be here. He preferred New York himself. But again, why this was so important? Steve didn't wait for another word before he headed to the closest door. He wanted to get out of here before he said or did something that he would regret. There was an insult on the tip of his tongue that was dying to come out.
If possible, it looked like the Howling Commando was getting older and older with each passing second. As Toni eyed him, she knew the answer to her question and she felt sick. "He's dead."
"It was a bet you see. Back when my law firm was just Pearson Litt, Howard Stark came to us and asked us to deliver a package to you on this date at this place," the Lawyer stated with a smile.
Toni's heart flickered in her chest, skipping a beat. She wanted to scream 'yes,' but let's be honest, Steve was her first
Tony shrugs. "How am I supposed to know what goes on in his Serum filled head? And besides I turned him down."
Toni's eyes flicked from the plans to Howard. He genuinely seemed excited to be helping, and it took her by surprised; however, she shouldn't be surprised by her father anymore. He wasn't the man she knew. "You seemed pleased by this," she replied, looking back at the plans. She knew she would be pleased with herself if she came up with it.
Tony never learns what movie the group ends up picking as sleep takes him easily. With two warm bodies against him, there's no fighting it, even when the group loudly whines at seeing Barnes and Rogers give each other a kiss. Tony does not open his eyes, even if he wants to watch them make out like teenagers. It's hard to be anything but happy at this moment, and it's in a moment like this that Tony wants to say those three words, but it isn't the sleep that stops him.
She was in haze, barely paying attention to the world: however, there wasn't much going on. She was just guided into a quinjet and back to Stark Tower with any fight. She didn't say anything as she forced onto a sofa and a heavy blanket was thrown on her, almost covering her whole. She knew Steve and Bruce—when did Bruce get here?- were saying something to her, but all she saw were their mouth moving. Were they speaking another language? She could even hear JARVIS in the background. It was mumbled, and it took everything she had to pay attention to the AI. After a few long minutes of staining, she could hear JARVIS ask if she needed something—not that she could answer.
Toni crossed to the knife and picked it up. "I do," she answered as she played with the blade. She had read about that mad man in a few of her father's journals. Schmidt's technology was ahead of its time and her father had-would spend months trying to figure it out.
Toni's eye was twitching, and it wasn't because she was bitter. It was because this man was an idiot and her holograms were so better. So much better. "No," she said as she crossed her arms.
Toni opened her eyes, letting out an exhausted sigh, as she glimpsed out the diner window. "Besides, fans are nuts." She uttered, spotting a few people eyeing them. It wouldn't be long before there was a group of people looking at them like they were at the Zoo. "Just look at them. JARVIS would totally go all smart house on their asses if he found them my bed. I would probably take a phaser to them myself."
All of the sudden, she felt a pair of eyes on her again, and she turned toward the window. There he was again, staring at her.
he thought. He wasn't going to let her die. Determination filled Steve as he got to his feet and rushed over to Toni. Even if she would not approve, he would not allow her to get hurt. He had to get her to safety and the best place for her was in her suit, even if it put her in the line of fire. He didn't know what he would do if she got hurt again…even if it wasn't technically again for her yet.
With the wires and IVs connected to her, Toni bolted straight up covered in a cold sweat. Not paying attention to anything round her, she hunched forward and fisted the sheets like she was in physical pain. "It was just a dream," she whispered, breathing heavily. Her throat was killing her. "Just a dream." She had no idea why that dream hit her harder than her nightmares did. In her nightmares, she was fighting for her life, while in that dream she just had to pick. She wasn't sure why she had to. It wasn't as if she wanted either Steve or Bucky, because she didn't…
"Yea, I bet he wasn't happy to hear that," he chuckled as he kneed down next to her. He grabbed her face and turned softly to look at the bruise that took up half of her face. "Doesn't look pretty. Maybe you should go see a doctor."
Having woken up early to do something, Steve returned a couple of hours later to find Bucky once again sitting at the table staring at him. In front of him was today's newspaper, which was opened to some war article. Steve stared at the picture with the same old desire of joining the army and helping his country but no one wanted him.
Loki had been locked up tight since he had tried to destroy New York City. "There's a chance he can help, or if not, there is also a chance he knows who did this." He knew the likelihood that Loki would help them was low and that he would want something in return if he did, but Fury had to do something.
Finding Stark Industries was easier than Toni first thought. She didn't know why she thought it be so hard, considering how big her father was at this time. She couldn't go down the street without hearing his name. His building, not as impressive as her tower, was huge and could be seen from a few miles away. The Stark logo wasn't as big as she thought it could be, but it drew enough attention from the people around. The color of the building was dreadful though, but she doubted that her father really cared what the color of his building was.
"There's also the fact that you were found with two unknown devices," Dr. Erskine stated. "Very interesting devices I must say." He was staring at the glow under her shirt, which Toni noticed. "It's fascinating that you would intergrade the device into your chest."
"Okay," Tony utters as he follows after the Colonel, tripping over his heavy boot. He looks like a fool, as he struggles to keep up. His leg is killing him, and it's showing on his face with every step. He knows there's a noticeable twitch in his leg, and he knows everyone notices. If Steve and James were present (and still dating), they would sweep him off his feet and carry him around like a princess—not that he'll never admit to wanting that-, and damn it, he wants that. He wants it bad…
She had a lot of questions. He didn't like questions. "Thor is looking at this as a chance of redemption for his brother." He took a pause to breathe. "He does, however, understand that this is a risk."
When Rogers stepped on board, Toni was snapped back to reality and turned away, not wanting to look at him. She hadn't spoken to him since the night she woke up from the coma and she had no interest in talking to him. She was going to keep her distance because there was a chance that she might snap at him for being the Captain Asshole if she didn't. She still couldn't understand what he was thinking when he kissed her.
She didn't want to deal with a certain person today, because of what today was. It was March 15, and she knew Rogers would know the importance of that day, because it was the day that her father died. He liked her father unlike her. She couldn't stand her father, and he couldn't understand why, but Toni wasn't going to enlighten him. He didn't have the right to know. He didn't have the right to look into her soul.
"Save it, Rogers," Toni said, interrupting him. Of all the things she wanted to talk about, that kiss wasn't one of them. That was the last thing she wanted to talk about because it wasn't as if that kiss meant anything anyways. He was hurting and needed comfort, which Toni didn't blame him for. "It's fine. It meant nothing. I understand. Now that's over with, are we done?"
"Captain America! How exciting!" He stated as his grip on Toni's arm slipped, sending Toni to the ground hard. It was clear that she was unable to stand on her own.
"All due respect, Sir, but horrible things had been done because someone thought it was for the best."
Toni had no interest in reliving that terror, even if keeping it inside hurt even more. "Why don't you finish what you were telling me, Cap."
Toni eyed Sam Wilson, taking him in. She watched him as he ended the meeting and said bye to each person individually. He was skillful with his movements, only touching certain vets; however, there was a solid connection with each of them, giving that veteran the link that they needed. It was probably the expression on his face that made it. There wasn't an ounce of pity or judgment in the man's eye. There wasn't an ounce of anything besides compassion. In rare form, this man just cared. There was no secret conspiracy plot. No treachery. He was just to be here because he cared. It was refreshing but weird. It was such a difference compared to everyone else she had met. It was-
He glanced up at her before looking back down at his menu. "I could've hurt you." He said, his voice soft. His voice was heartbreaking soft, sounding like someone had stepped on his heart. "I
Toni knew Rhodey wanted to talk since she first made contact him after her supposed death, but they hadn't had the time. How could there be? Thad been under attack, having to play defense, and now, they had to save the President. With the threat level in the red, it was a horrible time to have a talk, nor was it a good time to have a freak out, though that didn't stop Toni. Here she was on the edge, falling apart. How could she fight in this state? How could anyone keep their head on their shoulders if they were feeling like she was? "No," she replied, fighting back the oncoming headache—not that she could remember a time without one.
However, before she could wrap herself around Steve, an arrow flew through the air like a knife, burying into a target a few feet from the kissing pair. From the arrow, a small bright blast flashed behind them, forcing them back to the matter of hand. With a step back, Toni's heavily blinked as she forced her head back to the dangers around them. "Barton," she uttered as she spotted the purple Archer on a metal beam, his bow out in from of him. "Who called you?! I didn't ask for bird brain."
"Why would I settle down with just one lady, when I can have many?" Dugan asked. "Besides, I do have Nancy. She loves me." He let out a chuckle, leaning on his old, wooden cane.
Steve smiled –truly smiled–and it was breathing taking. There was no doubt that Steve had the biggest and sexiest smile around. There was no doubt that it could melt anyone's heart. "Well you
That was one reason why he almost killed Steve, when he noticed that bruise on the genius's arm. Heck, he still wanted to put an arrow through the super soldier, even if it was an
"So a job offer? Aren't you afraid that your board's going to like me better and make me CEO?" she asked, trying not to laugh. Why was it so hard?
Pepper was panicking as she knew what this alarm meant. "JARVIS! What happen? Is Toni okay?" she yelled as loud as she could. If she didn't, there was no way he would have heard her.
As Toni loved porches liking to lay out in the sun, they were required for everyplace she lived. Feeling the sun beat against her delicate skin and the wind gently blowing through her long dark wavy hair was the best feeling. She could lay out for hours (well with sun block and a nice cold drink). Sometimes she would sleep or read a magazine or book.
...Then there was the fact that she doubted herself. Was she really going to do this? Was she really risking her life just to get home? Even after a few minutes of that negative thinking, she knew she was.
"Toni," Steve said, interrupting her. With the Iron Man suit on, Toni was almost the same height of him, and her small frame was gone. Though the Iron Man suit was slim, it added bulk to the genius, and if Steve didn't know that the pilot of the suit was Toni, he would've thought it was a man flying it. He wasn't sure what the point was to make the suit male like, when she could've made it more female, but he supposed it had its uses.
Her eyes flicked. "Rogers," she said, fighting to speak. She was so exhausted that she could barely stay awake. "You sound h-horrible."
Peggy took a step back to her. "Toni. You need to be resting. You just got out of the hospital." There was a pause. "And you shouldn't be alone."
"I'm not going to let them risk their lives while I sit on the sidelines!" she replied. This was the same conversion that they always had. Pepper hated that Toni risked her life on a daily basis. Hated it.
Just as she was about to run, someone placed her hand on her shoulder, almost sending her a few feet into the air. It made her want to punch the person in the face. No one touched her without permission. Toni turned to face the person, and to her surprised, Rogers was standing there. Much to her annoyance, she saw concern in his eyes. "Rogers."
Bucky crossed to him. "She's having a nightmare." He wasn't sure what to do to help with nightmares, but he was sure that they couldn't just leave her.
Toni thought. She got the last name. "I find a lot of things funny," she stated as she pushed her device away and stood up.
Fondling it with his fingers, Killian mindlessly the needle, as his smile grew. "This drug isn't like anything that you had tried before," he said with a wink. "You'll get a kick out of it."
Shaking her head, she continued her crawl as the ground shook below her. "Assfuck," she cursed as another rumble sent her to her knees. "I hate this." Yet another shake rocketed through the building, keeping her still. She closed her eyes as she was hit by the overwhelming heat. If she didn't hurry up, she was going to go down with the building. Toni pushed herself onto her knees and forced herself forward.
He isn't sure—not that he expects them to care anymore- if Barnes and Rogers know he isn't sleeping in his bed at night, but he assumes that if they do, they'll lecture him about it… but they would have to care first, which they don't. Even if they haven't said it to his face, he truly believes that, which is why he gives up on waiting for them to come back. Maybe, this is their way in telling him that they don't want him anymore, which is the only outcome that he ever saw. His angst has been in overdrive since he started to sleep—if you can call it that— alone and it hasn't let up since.
"Don't touch her," Rogers snapped, glaring at the woman as she twisted her fingers into Toni's hair. Knowing Toni well, he could recognize the fear in her eyes, and he didn't like it.
"So how are you here?" she asked, eyeing the god who was only a shadow of his former self. He wasn't the one to help without a reason, and she doubted it was to help her. Sure, she was sexy as hell and could get any man to drool at her feet, but she doubted Loki really wanted to drool at her feet and woo her. Seriously, what was his reason?
His hand dropped from her arm so he could pull her into an embrace. He wrapped his arms around her and nestled her head under his chin. "I could never hate you. Maybe, mild dislike in your teenage years, but never hate. There's nothing you can do to make me hate you, Toni."
the use of the word. Sure, the word 'asset' was often used in the intelligence world, but she didn't like the idea of someone being a tool for someone else. Sure, she had been a tool for others at times and had used others as tools, but she was different now, not that same person. "Geez, didn't know I was so special," Toni snapped. "Oh, wait, I did, but next time I catch you following me I'll-"
She only made it half way, before she sunk to her knees as her legs couldn't carry her anymore. She couldn't even feel her feet or fingertips anymore. Even with the warmth of the lab, she was still freezing and she couldn't stop the shivers no matter what she tried.
It would be dangerous to let her go without knowing all of her secrets. The idea that she was a spy was less plausible now, but Toni could still be dangerous to the public. She could still be a terrorist or criminal, which was almost as bad.
"What did I do to make you dislike me so much?" he asked as crossed back to the door. He closed the door with his foot and stood in front of it to block her escape. "I don't remember ever doing anything to piss you off, and even if I did, how can you allow that dislike to control you? It seems like you need this device to work, and I can help with that." He paused and took a deep breath. "Stop being rash and juvenile."
Steve let up for a few seconds, though not letting her out of his arms. "Oh, are you? You might need to put on the suit, though it might not be good for our imaginary child."
Toni let out a sigh, because there was no denying that he was right. She needed to sleep, but the nightmares woke her every time and she found herself more exhausted than before. "So tell me about this theory?" she said, resting her head back on hands. "Maybe, it will put me to sleep," she said, laughing softly.
After making sure that the spider was off her, she darted to the back door of the complex. She reached into her bag and pulled her homemade scanner. The lock wasn't fully computerized as it would require her to manually pick the lock. The lock, impressive for the time, was connected to the building security system, and any attempt to pick the lock would alert the guards and slam down an interior partition inside the lock, making it impossible to pick. However, she was the famous genius Toni Stark and there wasn't anything that she couldn't hack. Plus, she had the scanner, which could hack the system and create an interference so the system would not know it was being hacked.
She looked him in the eyes. "You know this won't be easy," she said, thinking she could talk him out of this.
"Nope, still not working." She gave him an even bigger smile. "Nope. Now stop that. You're giving me the creeps."
"It might have worked if I was a dog." He glared, but she waved him off as she tried to get the picture of a dripping knife out of her mind. "Like I listen. Just ask Salty. I don't like orders," she said as she put her gun away and looked at the building map on the device. As she was looking, she added, "And you took down that man with a tiny knife?"
From her angle, she couldn't see what he was looking at, but she didn't care enough to move. She was too tired to deal with the world, and her exhaustion was only growing. She just wanted to sleep, but the idea of sleeping scared her. If she saw the flashes when she was awake, she hated to see her nightmares.
"You must think so as well, since I'm live," she replied. She wiggled her fingers trying to keep her hands from going numb. She could barely feel her feet as it was. "Or do you have crush on me?" she said with a wink. "That's so cute, though I would most likely break your heart, well if you have a heart."
With a snort, Natasha lifted her feet off the dash and lowered them to the ground. "Don't worry. Clint will find Toni. And trust me, Clint won't rest until he finds our favorite genius."
Steve eyed Toni for a few seconds before he turned to the movie. For a few minutes his eyes were on the movie invested on the emotional adventure of Carl, but the second he felt a weight against his side, his eyes were on the brunette next to him. The half-eaten popcorn bowl was on the table and Toni was curled up on the sofa, trying to get comfortable against him. With a smile in his face, he lifted his arm, and it only took a second for her to duck under it and curl up in his chest. "I got you," he said softly, putting a protective arm around her.
She had been called a fool before, and she would be called a fool again, no doubt by Rogers, but she didn't think being a fool was a bad thing. She was quite proud of her foolishness, and she would never stop. However, the look he was giving her could scare the fool right out of her. "What do you want?" she asked. "If you think you're going to get anything out of me, don't. I won't tell you anything, and you'll be wasting your time." She tried to emotionally ready herself, even if she knew nothing she would do would be good enough.
"I am a United States citizen. You don't have the right to do this to me." Toni was pissed. She knew his title give him the right to do whatever he deemed fit, but that didn't mean he can use that authority on her.
"I can't believe I rushed him off that phone call. How could I? I was so stupid. So cold." She buried her face in his chest, trying to hide from the world.
If her list was long, his had to be really long. He probably had an enemy list a mile long. He probably had enemies he didn't even recall. Yet, he was probably aware of each of them in some fashion, down to their underwear size. He probably knew their every move and tracked them like the super spy that he was.
Clint snorts loudly, as he stuffs a handful of popcorn in his mouth. "Doesn't stop Rogers and Barnes from moping around like someone had kicked their puppy. They keep pacing the hallway near the lab like some love sick teenagers trying to work up their nerves to talk to you. Not that they can, FRIDAY won't let them anywhere near you. She's threating to activate the Tower's security system on them." His stupid smile is growing as he eyes the engineer. "It's quite funny to watch, especially Barnes…though he may or may not have pulled a knife on me for poking fun."
Steve crosses to the other side of Tony as anger is suddenly in his voice. "You need to listen for once in you-"
Toni let out a sigh, knowing he found nothing. There was nothing for her father to find. "And what did you find?"
. Toni could remember that day in the woods, when they kissed. Even now, she could still feel his lips on hers, and her heart still skipped a beat at the thought of it. She could remember his laugher when she made a joke. She remembered it all, which was why it hurt so much looking at Barnes' face.
Toni's eyebrow rose. "Let's see. How often do you shower? Please tell me it's more than once a week! I have to make sure this big boy does not come back with fleas," she replied, smacking Steve lightly in the chest with her hand.
Giving her fellow Scientist a smirk, Toni pushed herself up as she tried to control her frantic breathing. Leaning on her good leg, her eyes scanned the room, as she tried to figure out what she had missed in her panic—not panic attack. When she got up, she noticed Clint staring at her as well, eyeing her every movement. She wasn't sure what he was thinking, but she knew he couldn't read her like Bruce could. Smiling, Toni turned from Clint and limped her way toward Steve, Natasha, and the Stalker SHEILD agent.
Tony takes a deep breath as he picks up the plate. After that, Barnes started to stop by the lab more often, and he's talking more, which Tony doesn't know how to deal with. But in any case, he refuses to think of it as anything more than it is. Barnes is just a stubborn guy, who wants everyone to like him. It means he's getting better, which is good, and Tony is glad. He is glad for both Rogers and Barnes.
"Jim," she said, softly. Toni didn't want to have this conversion with him, not now—not ever. Emotions were not her thing, not her strength, and the very thought made her want to run screaming for the hills.
The name was familiar to Toni, though she had no idea as to why this lawyer was here. Yes, she was aware that her father used Pearson Litt for his personal attorney rather than the Stark Industry fleet of lawyers for a great many things, but she wasn't sure why that mattered now. Her father, though it was yesterday for her, died a long time ago, when she still attended MIT. "I am aware," she said. "However, I am not sure why you're coming to me now?"
She also uses these weeks to watch Stark Industries, in which she had noticed a small hole in the security that she could sneak through. Now, she just needed to pick the time to sneak in, but that would have to wait until the cast came off. Hopefully, it would be in the next week, or she would take a saw to it herself. It was the itchiest thing on the planet.
"Don't kill her!" the Commander yelled as Toni closed her eyes. "Just destroy that device before the Allies get what they need."
Steve couldn't make out what she was holding on for dare life, but he wasn't focused on that. He couldn't look past his pain and anger; he was tired of her making him out to be the fool. He wasn't the fool, and he wasn't naïve. He was hopeful. What was wrong with that? "Do you care at all what you put us through?" he asked, not turning and watching her step toward the door.
However, his heart was already breaking, but there was one thing that Steve could hold on to: Toni was alive. She was breathing, which might she was coming back to him…Well maybe…Unless, she did something stupid, which was her mo. For being a genius, she did some stupid things, really stupid things—like make public threats and giving her home address. She also never knew when to back down or ask for help, and there was no telling what would or could be happening. She could be in a fire fight for all he knew, and Steve wouldn't put it pass her. She didn't know when to sto—No! He couldn't think like that. Toni left a message stating she was alive, so she had to be alive.
"Will you still ask me to reveal my inventions, Salty?" she asked, eyeing the man. He had turned back to her.
"Hey, that's my line," she said, her eyes drifted down to his hands. Again, silence fell, but once more, she was the first one who broke it. "I'm surprised that you hadn't touched me yet."
Toni drowned in her emotions for a few seconds, wondering how much of a pain and torture it was for Steve to be here. Did he really hate being here? Did he hate this sun? Did he miss the white Christmas that he had growing up? There was no doubt that he was a Brooklyn Boy through and through, and he belonged in New York, but did—
Letting out another sigh, Bruce held the reactor in his hands and just stared at it. "I see you're wearing dog tags."
"I know, but there was a reason why you didn't. Though no one could name all of the risks, it would set something off," he said, rubbing her back. "I'm not a time traveler, but I think that is rule one of the hand book, right? I might need to look at your rulebook to see, though." He added a laugh.
"Then so be it," she said. "Many scientists have died in the name of science. It's kind of like an honor." She knew what it sounded like; it sounded like someone who was defeated. It was a voice of someone who didn't care.
"No, I am not. Now, where and when were you born?" she asks him, studying the movements of his eyes.
He was the asshole that attacked Steve in the alley and slapped her ass, which no one did and got away with. He was also the reason why Steve and she didn't talk for days. "It won't be you," she snapped. Shaking her head, she turned to leave, but she didn't get too as he grabbed her arm. "What the hell? Let me go, Private," she ordered, using ranks.
Howard opened his briefcase, took out of the file and held it out to her. "Of course. What else will you do after the war?" he asked. "And you will love my labs." There was a brief second of silence before he laughed as she still hadn't take the file. "Oh, wait, I forgot. You don't like to be handed things."
"I don't know if I would consider myself a 'lady.' Being a lady is too boring," she stated, waving it off. "I rather have fun."
Steve started to struggle again as Schmidt grabbed Toni's face. "What are you talking about?" he asked, his smile dying as his eyes were glued to the hand on Toni's face.
She thought about Clint and Natasha, but they were most likely with Steve, and like him, they would've their phones off.
Toni was shaking from head to toes and struggling to keep her breath in the strong, powerful win, which kept threatening to steal her legs from under her. With each strong breeze, it felt like someone was stealing her breath and that she wouldn't be able to re-catch her breath. That nearly scared her to death, but she refused to give up, even if she wanted to. With the nonstop shivering and the difficulty breathing, the genius felt like she was seconds from fainting or something worse. It was a battle to stay on her feet, which she couldn't feel at the moment…again, not a happy feeling. She could barely feel any part of her body at the moment, which did nothing for her confidence.
If you ask him, Tony will tell you exactly what love is: a curse. It really is, because it takes over every part of your life and refuses to let go. It controls every part of you, not letting you to think for yourself, and if you try to fight it, it only causes pain and destruction. That's what happened to his late relationship. Sure, he
Closing her eyes, she cleared her mind and focused on the task at hand. She needed to study Stark Industries for a way in. There were high fences around the complex and security guards that walked up and down the fence every few seconds. Though she couldn't tell from here, she knew there had to be cameras, so even if the guards missed something, the guys monitoring the cameras would not. There was only one way into the lot, and that was through a single check point. Each employee was required to have their badge before entering, and if the guards wanted to, they were able to search the vehicle without cause. They seemed to search them all though, but she spotted the one time the car was not. The guy who drove in must've been trusted.
Phillips' grip loosen, but he kept a grip on her arm. "I'm sorry," he said, softly. "I was out of line."
She was hoping that she could run those feelings away, but she still felt like she was falling. Falling to her death. Free falling was one of the scariest things in Toni's opinion, because it was a total loss of control. There was nothing that anyone could do to stop themselves from falling to their deaths. The only thing a person could do was watch, watch him or her fall, and while they fell, they got to imagine what their death would feel like before truly feeling it. For Toni, this nightmare was the worst, because she had experience it before. She had free-fallen over New York, and she had been completely helpless, unable to save herself. Unable to do anything, and that feeling was worse than death itself.
With that and without saying another word, she turned from him and continued toward Howard and her device. Talking to him made her go crazy and she refused to do so for anything longer.
"I am shaking in my boots," Loki laughed as he dropped the journal on the cot. "Well, that was if I was wearing boots."
First of all, I am a horrible author. This chapter took me forever to write. Two months write the chapter itself and the about three weeks for the proofing. I don't why it took me soo long, though life happens. Crap and more crap. And even more crap.
Still speaking with the officer, he only glanced at her for a second. The officer nodded and stepped away a few seconds later. Rogers glanced at Toni again before he stepped away as well. "God, damn it, Steve," she yelled, switching to his first name. "Stop."
The drawing, almost completed, had an angry line drawn through it, caused by him throwing his pencil down. The tower was missing the name Stark that the real tower had, but the sketch had a shadow in one of the top windows that he envisioned Toni to be standing at looking over the city. He could see a smile on her face, happy at her work. She was always happy at her work.
Besides, she had to find something to wear, because she was the idiot who only had the clothes on her back. No joke. However, one of Steve's dress shirts worked just fine in her opinion and she was right. With her small form, it was the prefect length for a dress, though some might call too short. But you know what? She had awesome legs, and she was pretty sure that Steve would agree to that. "Right, Steve?" she asked, not even asking him the question.
"Don't give me that shit. What's wrong?" she asked pushing his hand off her shoulder, and using his arm as an anchor. Seeing the scared, depressed look on his face, she kept a grip on his arm and she squeezed.
Since she met Harley, she hadn't been plagued or haunted by the dancing shadows, but with the boy gone, they seemed like they were back, ready to drive her insane. With her heart beating rapidly, she could see or she thought she could see something sparkle in the shadows, and it stole her breath with each spark. She could feel her heart skip as she pressed her foot hard to the gas petal. With everything coming at her all at once, she wanted to put some distance between them.
"Just keep talking. It doesn't matter what you say," Rogers said. He paused as he glanced toward Toni, who had stiffen as Madame Hydra continued to play with her hair. "You hadn't seen anything yet. If you think you won, you have another thing coming."
He waved him off. "I know it was because you were protective. You were an ass out of love," he stated with a laugh.
"Yes," she replied, bitterly. "I've heard, but not from you two." She was annoyed that no one bothered to tell her that Toni had returned. If it wasn't for the AI, she would've never had known that Toni was back. Was anyone planning to tell her? Okay, she knew they would've told her eventually but when? "If it wasn't for JARVIS, would I have even known? Would you have told me? Or is this an Avenger only thing?"
As Steve stared wide eye at her, his anger grew. He couldn't believe how reckless Toni was. Did she not understand what she was doing? "Hey!" He yelled, getting their attention. "Are you nuts?"
Even worse, he expected her to have kids. Her children? One, she had no idea at all of what to do with them, and two, she would probably kill them on accident. How did one even feed a baby? Then there were diapers. Seriously, her with kids? Who the hell was her father kidding? Wait, her father didn't raise her as he left her to nanny, which was another sign that Toni would be a horrible parent. She was just like her father.
Steve laughed again. "I won't let anything happen to her." With that, the call disconnected, leaving Steve and Toni alone. "I mean it, Toni. I won't let anything happen to you."
She felt ill just thinking about it because she couldn't even begin to imagine what he had gone through.
Toni was lying down in a patch of dead snow covered grass, using her binoculars as she watched the two groups move toward the small well-guarded base. Her small form was almost invisible, while Barnes, also using binoculars, was kneeing next to her. He was only a few inches from her. "It seems like they're almost in place," she said as she stared at Rogers, who looked like an ant form this distance. He looks cute as an ant, she thought with a smile.
Toni eyed his hand for a second before looking away in a huff. The early sun had come out, casting a light yellow upon them. There was a cool breeze in the air, provide a relief to those running. To her, it gave her the goosebumps. The park was peacefully quiet, as these early hours provided a clear pathway for runners. "Ah, what a boring name. I expected something more," she said, gesturing into the air.
Toni thought she handled the Colonel well, and she knew she had annoyed him, which she smiled about. She didn't know if he would come back or if he would send someone else in. If Howard walked through the door and she had to speak to him, she didn't know if she could handle it without turning to violence. She didn't know if she would be angry or spineless, which was normal for her. He had a presence that could tear anyone one down. He wasn't always like that, she thought. It was a long time ago and it was hard to remember, but he was a nice loving father. She blamed the change on Maria's death.
"Okay, that's a bad example, but I blame Barnes on that one," she said, annoyed. Why did he have to step in front of her like that? What was he trying to show?
Barton didn't turn back, focusing on another piece of melted metal. Though the pieces were no longer red hot, the pieces were still warm. "Knowing Stark, she kicked the guy's ass and is gloating somewhere with a drink in her hand."
This is the last pre-written chapter. The next chapter is completed. Just waiting for my beta to return it. Once she has, I will update it for you.
That pissed her off. Wasn't just her father? Did he think he had a right to her father? Sure, she didn't want him, but that didn't mean she wanted to share him with an ass. She was inching to go in there and punch him in his face, even though she knew that wasn't a good idea. She didn't need to break her already burnt hand.
He made a face at the sound of his last name. "I had enough beauty sleep, and I'm glad Peg woke me. Didn't want to you to leave without saying goodbye."
"Hey, now," Tony replies, glancing around the rest of the kitchen. It's just the four of them, which is more than Tony is used too. He knows he shouldn't shut himself off from the world or at least the team, but he isn't sure he can handle them all. Plus, there's no way that he can hide his emotion from them. "At least, I can feed myself."
Toni chuckled lightly as she leaned heavily against Steve. "Hey, now," she said, quietly. "I can cook."
Toni's hands tightened around the box to the point it hurt. "You agree with him?" she asked, fighting back the anger that was struggling to break free.
Toni let out a snort. "Steve and I disagree a lot." It wasn't a lie, but she could admit that their fights and disagreements didn't leave her crushed like others in the past. Even in his anger, he was gentle with her.
It had taken a few minutes for Bruce to talk Steve down from his mood and get him out of the lab so he could work. It was hard to do anything with Steve around, which annoyed them both. He knew Steve was feeling useless right as there was nothing he could be doing. Steve wasn't stupid by any means, but he wasn't genius. He didn't understand anything about what Toni was building. Toni and Bruce could have whole conversions in front of Steve with him not having a clue to what they were saying. Toni thought it was funny, though Bruce didn't think so. He took a deep breath as he thought about her. He could keep himself busy, trying to recreate the device, but Steve could not. Steve was good, no great, in the field, calling out strategies; however, in the lab, he was not. They both knew it.
"Yup, you two are disgusting," a voice said from the door before Toni or Steve could say another word.
Toni shook her head as she tried to rid herself of those thoughts. "Oh, that outfit," she said, remembering what he wore during the battle of New York. His man really loved to be a flag, didn't he? "Such a sexy outfit." She laughed.
"Skully?" He looked at her harshly and coldly. "You hold Captain America too high," he replied. "He will not be able to save you, Sark."
When Steve came to the next morning, he was alone in the bed, which didn't sit well with the Captain. With a cold bed, his first thought was that she went back to the lab to work herself death, which turned his stomach. Readying for a fight, there was no hesitation as he jumped out of bed and onto his feet. There was only one thought on his mind, and that was Toni's well-being. He had to find her, go to her, hold her; however, he didn't have to go far to find Toni, who was standing a few feet from him at her floor to ceiling window. With her arms wrapped around herself, she was staring out at the calm ocean.
The Asset was sure he was going to be punished as he was not obeying his handers when they ordered him away from the Brunette, from
Toni glanced up at Clint and Natasha, giving them each a look before returning her glance to Steve. She didn't say anything, which scared the Super Soldier, as she was impossible to read when she was like this. Did someone hurt her? If so, he would regret the day he was born. Or was it an accident? Steve wasn't sure, but he was going to find out as soon as he calmed her down.
Not willing to listen to Steve ramble on anymore, she launched herself at him and placed her lips against his. She didn't know what exactly was going through her brain- not that she would know what to say, but she kissed him with everything that she had. Maybe, that was an answer? After a few long minutes, she pulled away. "You talk too much."
As Steve helped her to her feet, he held her close, not letting her out of his arms. "You better as I'm never letting go," he said, holding her. She leaned in and gave him another kiss, but this one was heavier than before. Steve's hands traveled to her lower back, pressing her against him. His fingers brushes against her soft skin; however, before anything it could get any heavier, they were interrupted with a loud thud.
The Genius stood like a statue, not even twitching, in the bitter, cold air. Not changing out of what Steve had put her in the night before, Toni was wearing shorts and a loose t-shirt. Frozen for a few seconds, he eyed her, studying every mark on her pale skin. Though he had noticed the marks before, the dark bruise seemed all the more noticeable. Though the welt from Natasha had long since faded, there was a new angry bruise riding up her back and onto her shoulder. He had no idea of how Toni obtained the bruise, but it angered him deeply.
"Sex?" She asked, looking up at him. There was something in her eyes that made Steve chuckle. "Because I would be up for that. Have you seen your abs?" she asked, as she un-balled her hands and softly ran her hands down his chest, tracing his bodily lines. "I would like to lick each one."
There was a point where Steve wondered if he should gave up and stop chasing Toni; however, that very thought made his stomach uneasy. He hated the idea of not being with her, and he knew if he gave up, he would regret it. He regretted it before and he would now. He would regret not loving her, and besides, he was getting to her. Her reactions were clue enough, which was why he followed her. He could see the struggle in her eyes. He could see her fear.
He wondered briefly if he would see Toni, but he brushed those thoughts away. She wasn't a part of this; she didn't need to be a part of this. She was already hurt by this Tesseract and she didn't need to be hurt again.
With a bit of hesitation, he wiped the tears from her eyes. "How often do you have nightmares?" he asked. He had a hand on her knee in a sign of support.
Toni's eye was twitching. She had enough of him pushing her to Rogers, who she didn't want to see. She just wanted her whiskey, which she would have soon. "Why don't you go bug him now?"
"I'm not interested in making Super Soldiers," she said, giving him a cold look. To be honest, she might have given it some thought or consideration before the Time Traveling incident, before she became involved with Steve, before she came friends with Bruce. Though Toni wasn't afraid of the Hulk, she knew Bruce hated himself at times, and if she could take that way, she would. She would do anything for Bruce. Plus, being with Steve, being his ear, she couldn't support any kind of enhancement project, as the government would see any 'Super Soldier' as a weapon, and Steve wasn't a weapon. Both Steve and Bruce were so much more than that.
Toni pushed herself up, joy—relief washing over her. Maybe, it was seeing Steve, but her hearing was finally returning to normal. "Steve," she uttered, slowly getting to her feet.
The genius groaned loud, as the chair pinched her legs, pinning her. "Fuck me," she cursed, as she tried to kick the heavy chair off her, though she couldn't get the chair to move an inch. With a deep sigh, Toni glanced at the window, still trying to get the chair off her legs. Her eyes scanned the area outside the office window, though there wasn't much she could look at. Her office was good for people watching, which was what she did for a few seconds, as she was still trapped under the chair. Though in those few seconds, she cursed those idiots, who weren't trapped—though she had no one to blame besides herself. However, she refused to blame herself. She, Toni Stark, was never at fault…
Toni's eye may or may not have been twitching. How could he not mention her? Or how about poor JARVIS? "And don't forget about me. Because I'm so in the pro column. I'm the whole column in fact. And I'm also telling JARVIS. You're screwed. We all know sensitive he is."
Phillips took a deep breath and crossed to the corner table. He wouldn't admit it, but Toni's pain was getting to him. He disliked seeing anyone in pain, but there wasn't anything he could do for her. She was the reason why she was in pain, and he couldn't do anything for her until she admitted the truth. "Just tell us everything and this all can be over," he stated, knowing no one could hear it.
Toni's heart raced, not knowing that someone was in the room, and in her surprised, her arms gave way and she collapsed back onto the bed. "Shit," she cursed. Not wasting any time, she tried to push herself, but before she could, she felt a set on hands on her, keeping her stil.
Steve's fist balled at his side. "You don't know what you're talking about, as she was quite clear to what she wants," he replied in a cold tone.
Refused to show an ounce of emotion, Toni took a few deep breath as she tried to calm herself. With anger growing inside, she needed to calm herself, because she would be
If she wasn't pinned, Toni would kick his ass, even though this man glowed dangerously. That would just made her try harder, and it wasn't like she was completely helpless. She had something up her sleeves that she was waiting for the right time to use. "It's not your fault kid. Remember what I told you about bullies?" She asked, remembering what she had given him earlier. She could almost smile at her horrible parenting (not that it could be called that) skills.
Rhodey groans. "What? Are we ten?" he asks. "…We're children in adult bodies, but yet, they tasks us with protecting this world? Geez, what are they thinking?" The groups laughs as Tony starts to fall asleep against Steve's warm side.
"Wow," she uttered, out of breath. That kiss had taken everything out of her; it was toe curling, stealing her breath. "Maybe, I should say that again? Maybe with less clothes," she said, giving him her best come hither look.
With the bag in her hand, Toni, still in the fugly nurse Uniform, walked down the streets heading toward the location of Stark Industries. She did her best to ignore the cold that was nipping at her and the fact that after she stole her device back there was nowhere she could go. She had no money or resources; what was she supposed to do? Toni wasn't sure, but she knew what the first thing she had to do: she had to get the device. After that, she wasn't sure.
"Good, because there's a new position I want to try if you're up to it, Old Man," Barnes says, smirking like the punk that he is. "We wouldn't want to break you." His voice is soft, and even if he's teasing, it's clear he's worried about hurting Tony.
"Where would the fun be in that? I like to see you like this," he said, inching his face closer to her.
Tony looks up and glares at the former Assassin. His Brooklyn accent is strong, getting stronger with each passing second. "Like I told the Captain, I'm
Toni couldn't guess what day or month this was, because one, she didn't know how long she had been out and two, she wasn't sure how time travel worked or how far she back. She could have gone back 75 years or 75.23 years, and she had no clue how to find out without looking like an idiot, not that she didn't already look at one. Right now, she looks like a chicken without a head. Normally, she knew New York like the back of her hand, but now, she was completely lost. The whole city was different and she couldn't find her away around to save her life, but more importantly, she was unable to locate her father's building. Maybe that was for the best, because there was no way for her to sneak into that company.
Toni watched him as he walked away. Sure, she knew she was being an asshole, but it wasn't all her. She couldn't stand this fighting between them. She missed hanging out with him. She missed being able to talk to him or even trying to hook him up with someone. She could be having so much fun trying to get Peggy and him together, even if he didn't like it. That would make it funnier.
Though Steve knew he shouldn't take her insults personally, they hurt. "Stop with the insults," he said, almost snapping. It was so hard to remain calm with her, when she did this. "Why don't you just say what's on your mind?"
A blushing Steve placed the two glasses on the table before he took the popcorn from Toni. "…So why does
"I have my moments." She stepped toward the table that the officers were standing moments before and stared down at the map. As they were still in Italy, she knew before looking at the map that it was of Italy and the surrounding areas. "So why did you call?"
"Really?!" She couldn't believe that he admitted that. "I can handle it. Barnes taught me a few things."
Before she could turn away, Rogers pulled away from Carter and turned, which to her bad luck, put her right in the sight of Rogers, who was looking at her with those eyes again. "T-Toni…" He stared at her, unsure what to say. He knew he had been caught. "Why are you out of bed?" he finally asked.
Toni's eye brow rose. "Did he really just say that?" she asked, looking around. "Did he just say that? You control me? Pssh. Steve control me? Yea, right."
"Not so fast, Pierce would like to have a word with you as well," Rumlow adds. "It seems Iron Man was spotted in an Alley fight and caused some damage."
He pushed open the door before he looked back to her. "Fine. I won't say damsel in distress," he said with a laugh as he pushed through the door before she could say anything.
Anyhow, back to the story on hand. I thought I would give you some warning for this chapter. Nothing to major, but there is some talk of suicide. Or rather, one character telling another character to kill herself. No is no attempt but I figure I give you guys the warming.
"M-make it stop," she cried, unable to take it. "It h-hurts." Her ears felt like they were on fire, and if she could feel her body, she would've sworn that her ears were bleeding. It was so intense that she couldn't feel anything besides pain. If she could speak or if someone could hear her, she would plead for her death. The sound was so deafening that she could no longer hear what the echoing words were.
For a few long seconds, Toni just stared at him with her month hanging open. Without meaning to, her hands went to the tags and gripped them tight. The cold metal cut into her hands, but she didn't let go. She was holding on for dear life in the hope of hiding the tears from Rogers. How did he know? The only person who knew was Bruce, but why would he tell the Captain? "I don't know what you're talking about."
Though she would never admit it, there had been a couple times that she had been hungover or even dunk when she flew the Iron Man Suit. It wasn't because she meant too; it just happened, and it wasn't like anything was going to happen. She had JARVIS if something were. Future Rogers had been suspicious of her a few times, but he didn't accuse her of it. If he had, they would've been a fight, which was what he might've been trying to avoid. "No worries," she said as she waved it off. "What about that girl for you?" she asked, pointing toward a few woman on the other side of the bar. "They can't say no to a man in uniform."
That had the genius worried. She wasn't an expert on 1940's law, but she was sure she wouldn't like the power it gave him. In her time, the law was there to protect the people, but in this time, there was a war going. This country was afraid of Hitler and they would authorize anything to protect themselves.
"Yea," she uttered, still feeling odd. Though she would blame it on the temperature, she was shaking. "I'm good."
, and she felt better, even if her mind refused to stop. She had never been good at shutting off her mind, which was why she was a horrible sleeper only getting a few hours of sleep. She wished she could shut off her mind, especially now. She really needed to now. She was the most negative person ever.
Toni didn't think anyone could make her wish that Harley, the boy who never shut up, was at her side instead of this idiot, who didn't understand personal space. However, the mention of Steve got Toni's mind spinning. Having no idea what was going though Steve's head at this very moment, Toni had no interest of being reminded of her perfect Boyfriend, who deserved better than her. Guilt just filled her, whenever she thought about the pain and heartache she was putting him through. "Come on in and close the door, Damn it. You're letting in the flies."
She forced the growl down her throat as she pushed herself to her feet. "Stop saying my name." She hated how he said it. He said it as if he cared.
"Nat," came Clint's familiar voice. He sounded exhausted and apprehensive as he spoke. "Rogers, you there?"
The genius from the future looked at Peggy from the corner of her eyes. She wasn't sure if she liked this friendly Peggy, though she supposed it was better than the bitchy Peggy. "Just tired," she responded as Peggy packed.
Tony waits until Natasha is gone and down the hall before he opens his eyes, and for a while, he just stares at the ceiling before he rolls toward the edge of the bed. It's like he's in a slow motion movie as he's moving ever so slowly. Every movement feels like there are needles stabbing him, and it's extremely painful. Sure, the nanos are working and healing him quite well, but there's only so much they can do. Like with most injuries, he needs to rest. He knows he needs to, but he can't sleep here. Not here, not where he used to sleep with his Brooklyn Boys. Not where he used to feel so L—No! He refuses to use that word, because it isn't that. It was never that, and now, this place is tainted. He can't sleep here anymore.
Phillips knew, due to her freak out earlier, that taking it out would kill her, but her statement got him wondering. Did something force that device on her? Or did something happen to her that forced her to take it? He guessed it would have to do with what it did. Did it keep her heart beating like pacemaker did? If it did, why would a young thing like her need one of those? However, it might not have anything to do with her heart. Maybe it had to do with her blood. She might've been poisoned and that device could be keeping her blood clean. Or maybe, it kept her safe from someone. He didn't know what it did but he was going to find out.
Bruce looked back and smiled lightly. "I believe that Toni transported herself into the past, though I'm not sure to which time period."
"I know, Nick. That's the problem," Steve said, with a heavy sigh. His eyes glanced to Toni, watching her as she stared out the window. Steve, tired of talking in the dark, reached for the light. Though it took him a few seconds to adjust to the light, he noticed Fury's injuries for the first time. There was a brief second of silence as they met glances, and with a firm look, Fury indicated for them to silent. Still not happy, he pointed up to the ceiling and shook his head. Steve, morphing into Captain America, turned the light off. Like hitting a switch, he was in war mode.
After drinking half the bottle of water and with a bit of hesitation, Toni dumped the remaining of it on her head. She shivered as the water dribbled down her face and neck. It tickled as it traveled down her skin, dripping into her shirt. The cool water droplets felt refreshing against her warm, sticky skin, though it gave Toni slight chills. Even now, the slight feeling of water against her skin brought out some panic in her. It was a battle at times to keep
Toni's patience had gone out the window, well if there was a window. "You just like to poke," she stated.
Rogers stares at Tony for a few seconds before turning to Barnes. Their eyes meet and they stare at each other for a few long seconds. Tony isn't sure what's going on through their eye glances, but it's like they're talking, which just annoys the genius. Why can't they make kissy face at each other in private? Seeing this does not help him.
Clint's eyes wandered around the hole. It was very interesting, because JARVIS was correct. Everything just vanished, and that was strange. There were no displaced tiles, broken pipes or anything. It was a clean cut. There were no evidence that anything besides a hole was ever there. "Is there anything you can use to track Toni?" Clint asked.
