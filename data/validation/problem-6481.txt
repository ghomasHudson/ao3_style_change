Tony's heart clenched painfully at the memory. That voice was tearing him to pieces. "Vision." Tony tried to calm down, but the obvious concern in
"Do you, err---" Tony cleared his throat. His heart was beating like crazy. "---maybe--- want to buy a ring?" Tony hesitated.
"Tell him I'll be there in a sec." Tony exited the Captain's room and stood by the door again, staring at the floor. How many times had he read the letter? Enough times that he could recite it from memory.
Clint searched the kitchen for a vase, he waves the flowers gently at Rhodey, as that would answer his questions. Rhodey gave him a lost look.
Tony moves to Sam side instantly. Arm over his shoulders. “Sam, you and I need to talk. I think we have a bond here.” They walked away from the wolves as they heard Sam laughing to whatever Tony was saying.
“Do you think this is a good idea?” he asked as he pulled away. Tony huffed a laugh, “Are you kidding me?” Humor filled his eyes.
They’ve found Tony and Rhodey cuddle up in the armchair. Didn’t look comfortable. Tony was sprawl out on his friend as Rhodey kept a secure arm around Tony waist.
His friend huffed out a laugh, “Yea, what of it” he finished placing the last of the eggs on his plate.
“Oh hi,” Bruce moved to shake Tony hand. Letting go, Tony brows came together, “Bruce? Not for nothing, but you wouldn’t be that
Oh, maybe he should have done this in the beginning. As Steve lips quirked up, amused. He took hold of Tony hand and pulled him out the shop. Last sight was Loki laughing face.
He felt Tony puff of laugh against his throat. “I’ve never thought I would see the day someone did that to me.” Steve gave a throaty laugh. “Get used to it.”
He bounced off the bed. If he was going to get some answers might as well get ready for the day. The old man said they had the run of the town, he grinned.
“The shift starts around five or six-year-old. It’s rare when it happens any later than that. They’ll get it out their system here. Tire them out, so later their parents teach them the way. Soon they will start their lessons with me.”
The little girl from before jumped with her hand held high. Frigga motioned for her, “Mommy told me it has two… Tree of life or World tree,” she answered. Tony found her cute.
“Well, here a question for you, when do you guys,” he motioned a couple of kids that were shifting. Frigga clapping excitedly at their accomplishment.
They weren’t headed inside. They were led around the house to the huge open field. A barn open to horses grazing about. Tony noticed one horse fence off from the others. Even though he was far, he could tell it was huge. Big and white, a few specks of black dotted its rear. And he just saw the guy on top of it get bucked off hard.
Thor smile with amusement, “Our guest is called Anthony Stark. And be warned that Loki likes him a lot.”
Steve’s still caught up in Tony scent. Disappointed that he couldn’t taste him again. But with Tony clung to him, a viselike grip on his shirt, he turned to see the bear that had Tony nervous.
Sam eyes twinkled and he gave a full-blown smile, “Ah right you met the boys, “he chuckled. “They are a handful.”
The chair scraped the wooden floor. He pulled his hand away from Steve. Blue eyes held a bit of hurt, but Tony was instantly on him.
They shook hands, “Hey, how you’d like it around here? Beside the whole imprisonment situation.” Tony was going to like him.
“Rebecca,” she was popular. As Tony turn to look at a man, who was smiling the same smile as her. He held out some clothes to her, “Found them, how about you see if can get it on them.”
“Mm yea…” Rhodes took a sip of his coffee, “The way he looks at you. Not sure if he wants to deck you or…” he trailed off.
And once he untangled himself, he gave Steve shoulder a kiss. He wasn’t sure where his clothes exactly went and took whatever he could find. Which was a shirt, and it being Steve’s shirt. Tony wasn’t that short, but it covered all the bits that needed covering as he made his way out the bedroom.
Wade eyes was intensely fixated to the door Anthony had gone through. Thor hand was on his shoulder restraining him. Thor eyes fell to Loki, they have much to talk about. “Thor mind the shop, boys” Jared and, reluctantly, Wade looked to him, “Make sure you take your grandfather home.” With that he left them.
“Mm,” Tony hummed. As Steve let him go, looking behind him. Steve was huge everywhere. He held him against his skin. He was happy that the moon didn’t light everything up. Or Steve would see Tony completely red, as he started to rub himself against Steve stomach. They both were hard, and Tony took that as a good sign. Though he’s not sure why he felt this way toward Steve.
He walked toward them, Steve clasped a hand over his shoulder. “Sam, this is Tony. Tony meet Sam Wilson.”
“Not enough,” they turned to Natasha as she found the bottles. “Looks like four max. Three barely halfway done and—” she picked up one empty bottle, lips lifted “One empty.”
Rhodey gathered Tony in his arms. Tony held his friend tight. He really was happy to have these people in his life. His family.
Tony was absorbing what he could. But he was reeling at the fact there were other places like this! He’s wondering if these places, these people were maybe the reason for so many myths out there.
“Glad to be home.” Natasha pushed back and saw Steve split lip. “Looks like it was a rough one this time.” While they’ve were fusing over Steve, Natasha phone went off. She excuses herself, as Steve turned back to Thor.
He couldn’t help but laugh, his mixed feelings from earlier forgotten—for now. “Tomorrow we are going to Frigga, Thor’s mom, place." Clint said rummaging through the bags. “Getting the Shapeshifter 101.”
And the answer came out from the tall grass. A behemoth of a bear moved toward them. “Please tell me that’s a friend?” He may have squeaked that out. He watched the grizzly steadily make its way towards them.
“Now my little ones, let’s start with a bit of our story.” She smiled and took a seat. “We all met Yggdrasil.”
“Now Steve before you take our Tony out. There a few rules,” Clint crossed his arms, a serious look on his face.
Though he should find another way to handle this, if he was going to win Tony. And he sure as hell will win his mate.
“Who are you?” Steve growled. “Cut the bull Rogers!” Tony steel himself, “How do you know her?” he shouted.
Tony held his breath. His body thrummed at Steve lips touching him. Oh man, he had a feeling he won’t be going home anything time soon. Nuh-uh, he wanted a piece of Steve.
“I can’t,” she huffed. She looked at Tony shyly, she was okay around Steve, which is understandable. Steve was her kind; Tony was a stranger.
“Are you guys the reasons people think bigfoot exist?” Clint earned a smacked to the head by Rhodey.
“Steve Rogers” Tony repeated, it left his lips like silk. And Tony bit his bottom lip, feeling the shift in the room. Man, Steve was making him dizzy the way his moods changed. He made a step toward Tony. Tony took a step back, Steve could sense Tony nervousness around him.
And he looked to a shelf that held some books and a few pictures. Family pictures. He looked behind to watch Steve busy with whatever he made. Oh, a guy that can cook. Big points for Rogers. Tony was a horrible cook.
“For the hundredth time, you look good.” it exasperated Rhodey. He couldn’t remember Tony being like this. He wished Pepper was there to see that.
“Nothing.” Steve answered. His jaw clenched, this guy was tense. Tony had a feeling he did not like that decision. But the way Steve eyes moved to burn into him, this guy needed to relax. He thought Pepper was tenser when he had the habit of pissing off a board member and the occasionally scandalous event that the media ate up. Though she hasn’t glare at him this bad.
“You know quite a bit on weakness.” Steve lip quirked up. Tony was good at catching some important details. “Like I said before, I wasn’t like this.” He motioned to himself. They lean closer, their arms on the table. Their plates cleaned off. Tony fingers moved up and down the stem of the wineglass. Some lights were off, the candle their main light.
Aunt Peggy was right about something, he had so many questions. And most of them he wanted the answer from Steve. Has he met his Aunt? What did he know about her? What is Asgard? What the hell was that last night?
Steve back hit the headboard; Tony leaned against his chest. They both were panting. They made a mess. Steve’s hand pulled from Tony and grasped his buttocks and squeezed.
“So… how bad is it?” Sam spoke up, Steve leaning on the driver side door. “Beside Wade being an ass” his face tight, “Not sure what to do with this mess” he looked to Odin.
And when Tony thinks about that… he never was a person who like strangers to invade his space. For god’s sake Pepper had to take things that people tries to hand to him.
“You guys are pretty chill with,” he waved his hands around, “All this.” He started to shrug his jacket on.
Well at first, they seemed to turned cat like…no, he was mistaken, they’ve dilated, for whatever reason. Either way Tony felt a bit wary and took his hand back.
They all blinked as headlights hit their faces. A pickup truck drove up and halted. “Hey,” Sam stuck his head out the driver side window as he waved.
Thank you for reading this fic. And thank you to those that comment and stuck to this fic. It's very encouraging!
“Right… exactly what is all of this?” he splayed his hands to the counter. He moves, his hand shuffling mostly on—MP3 player, CD player, a radio and a toaster. “This,” Rhodey took the MP3 from his hand, “Is a trade.”
Tony cleared his throat, “Why didn’t she convert?” Steve's eyes widened, taken aback that Tony knew about that. “Sam, told me.” Tony answered.
“Okay, okay, we drop the ball on that one.” Rhodes straightens as he moves towards his friend. “I figured that—” he sighed and shook his head “Are you okay? Did—did he do anything?” the concern written on his face.
And there they were—his Top five least liked people. Bucky being number five and Steve the winner, he should be so proud.
Bruce blushed and rubbed the back of his head. “Thanks.” He stood still as he felt Steve glared at him, feeling he would have been disintegrated by that look where he stood. He wasn’t sure what to believe when Natasha told him of the news and their visitors or that Steve was territorial around one of them. He was feeling the heat now. He wanted to runaway now.
Tony snorted, “You really think I will stay in the dark for long?” he crossed his arms, “You let my friends go into town. Clint, he may not look like it, is nosier than me.”
“Oh, excuse me. It was getting drafty in here. Thanks for that” Clint sniffed. Rhodey was holding back his laugh behind his toast.
Steve lips quirked into a smile, “Point.” Steve gave out a resigned sigh. “Okay, I’ll answer whatever questions you have.”
“Marvelous, much to tell.” Loki shared what has happen earlier in the Shop. Thor booming laugh could be heard the street over.
I have made outlines and wrote scenes and such, trying to keep myself organize, so I’m thinking maybe 7- or 8-chapters top. But I will be slow at updating. Please don’t expect weekly/monthly chapters, it took me months to get somewhere with the first chapter.
Steve noticed and moved towards her. Tony close behind. They crouched down to her level. Steve gave his most charming smile before he spoke, “Hey, shouldn’t you be playing with your brothers,” he thumbed to the cubs.
Rhodey sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose “We have lives. What exactly do you expect us to do?”
Steve fought the laugh, “It’s true. I was like you.” He pointed to Jazmin. “My dad was a shifter; my mother wasn’t one. So, I was half. My mother was very sick, and she couldn’t go through the change. Your mommy was very strong, so she could.” She let out a smile, hearing how strong her mother was.
“Excuse me! Exactly how?” he felt his hand shaking, he couldn’t believe he was this angry. Tony let no one get under his skin. He was a suave ass himself, he was good at getting under people’s skin—he was
He gathered Tony in his arms; he grunted at him. And Steve brushed his lips against his forehead. It brought great joy for Steve to come home to someone.
The ground floor had only one bedroom and bathroom—where Tony slept last night. It had a nice view out back, looking into the forest. Upstairs, where his friends took, had two bedroom and bathroom.
“Whoa, my brain must be fried.” Steve laughed. Tony placed the frame back, “You were in World War two!” Steve nodded and motioned for Tony to take a seat.
, he gave Steve an insolent look as he continued to burn his eyes into him. Bucky gave a light slap to Steve arm, getting him to move out. “Have a goodnight boy’s! Welcome to Asgard,” Bucky shouted behind him as he shut the door.
Blue eyes stared down at him and Tony felt Steve’s excitement. But he stood still waiting for Tony answer. He couldn’t hold back his smile, he looked like a huge puppy. He nodded his head, Steve pulled him in for a kiss, smiling into it.
Rhodes blinks up at Thor, “She did all this? But this—this could have taken years, shit maybe centuries! Look at the trees!” he waves at the huge trees they passed by.
He didn’t realize that they were holding hands now. He felt an urge to press himself close to Steve. He pushed that urge down, so down it couldn’t see the light or until Tony was alone and could analyze that urge.
“Mr. Stark! Welcome to Asgard. As you know, my name is Loki and looks as you’ve stirred up our little town” Loki looked amused.
Loki spoke, “Tony, I am sorry for tonight. If you need anything” he splayed his hands out and clenched his hands as they fell to his sides, “Well you know where to find me in town.”
They’ve knocked, no answer. Bucky tried the knob; the door was unlocked. Steve grinds his teeth at the carelessness.
It was small, had a porch, and it looked weathered down. But, not so bad. It was when Steve opened the door Tony felt the warmth inside wash over him. Clint was right it was cold tonight. He entered and had a blast of, Steve. His smell.
“I must since I said yes!” Tony flailed his hands upward. Ever since he met Steve, he puts him in turmoil. Twisted his inside and after today… oh! He was a wreck. Why?!
A square in the middle, as cars could go around towards only about two road into more forests. A few buildings and one diner and, “Two bars?” he questioned the older man as he took a road, leaving town. “We Asgardians love our drinks,” Odin stated with a fond smile.
Thor entered the shop. Coming from behind Loki, he grasps his hips. Landing a soft kiss to the side of Loki’s neck. Loki chuckles, wrapping an arm around Thor’s head, as he comes to plant a kiss on his lip.
They give you the talk and the courting thing. And Steve thought it’ll be easy, no sweat. They’ve forgotten to mention the jittery feeling, his stomach flipping and the thought he might fuck it up—again.
“I never said it was.” Wiping his hands on a napkin, Tony rose to his feet. A hand on the board guided it to move in front of him as he brought Steve to the training room he’d prepared the day before. It was the work of seconds to transfer Steve from the board to the frame in the center of the room. Tony tilted it, Steve’s head hanging down lower then his feet, leaving his arms pinned by his sides. Steve’s legs were bent at the knee and spread wide, giving him room to maneuver. He left long enough to retrieve the cream he needed before settling on a comfortable stool between Steve’s thighs.
“Such a good boy. You’re a fucking gift, Steve.” Tony led him back down to the lab, over to the corner filled with benches and frames. This time he helped Steve up unto a table, urged him to lie back against it. Steve’s wrists were fastened beside his head, and a metal strap was secured across his waist. It should have made him feel claustrophobic and trapped. But because it was for Tony, the restraints had started to make him feel safe. Secure. It was another way the other man took care of him. Holding him down so he didn’t hurt himself.
Steve looked down, studying the pattern around the bottom of the couch. How did Tony always throw him off balance like this? "No. I wasn't going to tell you to stop. Knowing you, that'd just make you go out and buy twice as much." His lips quirked in a half-smile. "No, what I wondered was... I mean, what I wanted to ask you is..." He shook his head frustrated. "Why me, Tony? You don't buy Natasha fancy cocktail dresses, or Clint comic books and nerf guns. You take care of the living expenses and necessities for everyone, and we appreciate it. We do. But I'm the only one you treat-"
The dimness of the room made Steve feel more secure, however it was the feeling of his alpha’s hands on his skin that was helping the most. His thoughts were fuzzy, hard to catch. The only thing he could focus on was needing more. More touch. More skin. More alpha. Tony let out an undignified yelp as Steve ripped his shirt and jacket from his body, pressing against his warm chest and purring in the back of his throat. Better.
“Since you don’t seem to know how to keep your mouth shut, even though I told you my very first rule for you was respect, you have lost the privilege of speaking. The gag will be removed for water and meals. If you say a single word in that time, I will replace it with a less comfortable gag that I can feed you through. Nod if you understand.” Steve slowly nodded, eyes wide.
Steve bowed his head and disappeared into the bathroom. When he returned several minutes later, Tony was sprawled on the couch with another thick red cushion on the floor in front of him. It took no prompting this time for Steve to slide to his knees like he had in the other man's office. He felt fingers tangle in his hair, smoothing it back from his face.
When Steve woke up he was unrestrained, stretched out on a plush king sized bed in an opulent bedroom. Flashes of the earlier conversation between his new alpha and the doctor rushed back and he sat up with a jolt, feeling a plug press deeper into his passage. Heart pounding, he traced the collar around his throat, tugging at the metal, searching for give and finding none. He moved on to the cuffs around his wrists and ankles. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t get them to break.
“Good job, sweetheart. See? I knew you could do it. Now you just stay there and look beautiful while I finish getting you ready.” Tony moved up behind him. A heavy bar was fastened between his legs, metal cuffs secured just above his knees, holding him in the desired position. His torso was pressed down onto the mattress, head resting on a pillow, his wrists encased in shackles that were attached to the cuffs on his legs. Leaving him bent over and humiliatingly exposed to Tony’s gaze. “Aren’t you just the prettiest thing. Tell me, Steve, have you ever been with a man before? Or played with this pretty little hole?”
"Tony, I always love the things that you make. That you take the time to create something for me with your own hands. Whatever it is, I'm sure I'll love it."
Tony took the opportunity to run his hands over his omega’s well developed chest, thumbs flicking over his nipples, working them into hard peaks. He toyed with them idly, watching Steve’s cock twitch and flex from the stimulation. Waiting for Steve to set the tone for the day. He didn’t disappoint.
Tony offered him a crooked smile. “Yeah, loved. You are my sweet little omega. My mate. And I love you.” He brushed the tears from Steve’s cheek. “It’s alright if you don’t say it back. If you never do. That isn’t something I ever want to hear you say because you think you have to. Alright?”
Tony’s voice came from closer than he’d thought he’d be. “That’s right. Good boy. Just enjoy it. Let me take my time. You are so fucking beautiful.”
Shock was nearly as intense as the pleasure when Steve’s orgasm crashed over him, drowning him in waves of pleasure, drawn out by Tony’s steady thrusts. It wasn’t until after Steve’s second orgasm that Tony buried himself deep and groaned out his own release. Steve pressed closer, heart pounding, overcome with gratitude. He had craved the closeness of the other man. Had not expected to find pleasure. But Tony had been generous, even thoroughly distracted early in the morning to change the setting on Steve’s implant, allowing him to find a true release. “Thank you, Tony. You’re so good to me.”
The day Tony received a message from Thor announcing his return in a few days, Steve immediately went to find Loki. He didn't see the other man when he reached their floor, which worried him more. He almost always greeted Steve in the living room. A careful search of the floor found Loki tucked into the small space between one of the beds in a spare room and the wall, huddled in on himself in the corner. Steve carefully knelt in front of him, resting a hand on his knee, then flinching. His skin was icy cold. "Jarvis? Get Bruce. Now."
Tony smiled up at him when he walked in the door from his position crouched next to a table. “Give me just a minute, sweetheart.”
Steve set the tablet aside, deciding a break was in order. He wandered back into the small kitchen, looking around. The coffeemaker’s light was green, which likely meant it was still on. He poured himself another cup, adding cream and sugar the way Tony did, before carrying it back into the living room. Once he was ready, he turned back to the internet.
He tried to shake his head, couldn’t. “No. I was fine before. I was happy. You people took that away from me. My family. My friends. Now you’re taking my freedom, even my body, away from me!”
"Okay, so I'm going to assume this is an aspect of the modern world that wasn't in the file SHEILD gave you. Look, some people still consider anything other than vanilla heterosexual lovemaking with the lights out taboo. But for the most part, the kink community is all about safety and consent. If you're both having a good time, there's nothing wrong with what you're doing."
“You can and you will. Because I’m telling you to. Now.” The first release ripped through Steve as soon as the order left the alpha’s mouth. He shook, sensation crashing over him, leaving him unable to resist. As soon as one ebbed, another crested, taking him again. His nipples and cock throbbed, burning with oversensitivity, Tony carelessly fucking him through it, his voice a low murmur against Steve’s ear.
If their conversation earlier had taught him anything it was that Steve had been made to feel ashamed for any wants or needs that he had. Had been forced to ignore them and soldier on. How much of a toll would that take on a person over time? No wonder he was such a wreck. But Tony had the power to fix it. To make things better.
“So polite. I love it.” Tony took a moment to retrieve one of the water bottles he’d left in the room earlier, offering sips to both men. He soothed Steve softly, giving him an encouraging smile, then stroked James’ hair before guiding him back to the chair and settling him into it once more. Tony then made a show of pacing the room, digging through various cabinets and making plenty of noise each time, knowing Steve could see him out of the corner of his eye, ratcheting the anticipation higher. He pocketed a few items, before returning to Steve’s side.
Steve blinked a few times, distracted from the words by the dark purr of Tony's voice. "Umm... Yeah. Yeah, sure. Thank you, Tony."
"Good. Now kneel down right here." He helped guide him down onto a cushion facing the foot of the bed before slipping a silk blindfold over his eyes. "I will be monitoring you the entire time, and I can release everything remotely, alright? I always want you safe."
“You’re welcome, darling.” Tony stretched out fully, pulling Steve along to lie on top of him, his face tucked into the side of Tony’s neck. The sudden movement jarred the plug inside of him, resulting in another spike of pleasure and a following burst of pain to ruin it. He tucked himself closer, burrowing into Tony’s body. Steve had never realized how attuned he was to this man. How soothing his touch and scent could be. He had a brief moment to wonder just how long he’d been in love with Tony Stark, before sleep pulled him under once more.
“So do you still want to end it, Steve? Or do you still want to play, knowing exactly who you’re submitting to?”
Tony’s hands tightened, forcing him to be still. He pulsed his hips, letting his knot tug at the inside of Steve’s hole, working his slick glands. He finally went limp in his arms, soft helpless whimpers falling from parted lips. “That’s right, my good omega. You take me so well. You’re so good for your alpha.”
"Good night, Tony." Eventually, Tony's breathing evened and slowed. It was a long time before Steve fell asleep.
The bed dipped beside him under Tony’s weight before fingers gripped his chin roughly, forcing Steve to meet his gaze. “And when do I ever do anything I don’t want to? Especially just because I’m told to.”
It was late afternoon before Steve came back to himself enough to be aware of his surroundings. His body felt soft, still wrung out and tender from earlier, but the endless frustrating need that had haunted him since he presented was finally quiet. He stretched out his stiff muscles, pleased to realize that Tony had removed the restraints at some point. Steve rolled over, pressing his face against the other man’s thigh. Tony was still leaning back against the headboard, fiddling with various things on his tablet. He carded his fingers through Steve’s hair, smiling down at him.
Muttered words were garbled by the cup and Tony was intelligent enough to let it go. The table was quiet until Steve was finally awake and aware of his surroundings. A light blush stained his cheeks. “Morning, Tony. Sorry…”
“Yeah? You want something, omega?” Tony gripped his hips, rolling up against the plug, buried where he desperately wanted to be.
Tony rolled off the bed, disappearing into his closet. Steve stayed on the bed, obedient even without a command. Once he returned, the first thing Tony did was shackle his wrists to the bed frame. They were left loose, providing some room for movement, but the point was that he wasn’t going anywhere without Tony’s permission. Just the thought of it was enough to have Steve hard and leaking against his belly.
Tony focused his attention on Steve’s chest, mouth moving between his nipples, gripping his chest and kneading the flesh greedily. Steve’s chest soon felt swollen, nipples raw and throbbing. Each powerful suck caused him to whine helplessly. He could see bruises in the shape of Tony’s fingers forming on the skin, as well as reddened marks from the insistent grip. The tissue seemed softer than it used to, hanging with a slight curve, pliable in Tony’s grip. And feeling better than he thought it would.
Just before noon, Steve took the elevator down to Tony's office. It was strange seeing him behind the large desk. He was more used to seeing the other man bustling around his workshop helping to create the future. But he looked good, in his tailored suit, radiating power and poise throughout the room. Steve closed the door behind him and took the seat Tony gestured him to. "Food should be here in a few minutes, but I wanted to talk to you first."
Tony’s fingers brushed over his lips, occasionally pushing inside Steve’s mouth as he fed him bites of pastry and bits of fruit. Allowing him time to suck the sugar and juice from his skin. There was a second mug on the table, coffee with cream and sugar added, just the way Steve enjoyed it most. Every few bites Tony would press it to his mouth, allow him to take small sips.
“I’m sorry.” Steve ducked his head lower in a sign of submission. He was getting it wrong again. Would never get it right. He squeezed his eyes shut, trying not to let his thoughts carry him into a downward spiral. If he crashed, there would be no one to help him level out again.
"Very nice, sweetheart. You like that, don't you." Tony leaned away from him for a second, then returned, mouth hard and demanding on each nipple, leaving them hard and throbbing. Steve felt something cold brush his chest, then a sharp pinching pain in first one then the other nipple. He moaned, arching off the bed helplessly. The motion dragged the chain connecting the clamps on his nipples off to the side, tugging on them further.
“When you decided I wasn’t worth keeping around… When you were gone and I… I’d be alone again. And I’m so tired of being alone, Tony…”
Steve nodded mutely, overwhelmed by everything going on around him. He was led to a quieter corner, stage empty and waiting, where Tony sat down in a plush chair and drew him onto his lap. "Is this okay, Steve? We can leave if we need to."
Tony shot him an offended glare. “Of course I did! You don’t really think I’d put anyone else’s tech on your dick, do you?”
And the long awaited (and deserved) punishment scene. And maybe a hint of future plot. Oh yeah, this thing has plot, did you know that? As always, comments and constructive criticism are loved and greatly appreciated. Hope you enjoy!
"The sass on you." Tony shook his head slowly. "Better watch out, good boys might get rewards, but bad boys..."
There was a firm pressure along the entirety of his stretched rim, like suction but continuous. He tried to struggle, shake off whatever was putting pressure on the sensitive flesh, but nothing happened. He felt the metal dildo slide out of him, until only the very tip was buried in his body, before slamming all the way home again. And again. And again. A steady precise rhythm. Too precise for a human. This had to be another one of the toys Tony had designed for him.
“There’s my sweet boy.” Tony pulled him into his arms, holding him close before kissing him again. “I love you so much, Steve.”
Tony leaned back, watching Steve’s body shudder through several orgasms, becoming increasingly sensitive after each one, the desperate need driving him never slowing. Days. He was going to keep him like this for days. “I think you’re ready for us to get to work.”
Steve climbed up onto the bed and into the older man's arms, curling up in his lap and burying his face into the side of his neck. This was where he was meant to be. Everything he had ever wanted was right here.
“What would you like to do now, baby? Do you want to play with Steve some more? Or watch me this time?”
Steve stumbled to his feet and unsteadily followed Tony into the elevator, shivering from nerves rather than cold. When the doors opened he was lead out into the middle of the training room. His eyes darted around, hoping none of their teammates would be there to see him like this. Naked and cowed beside his alpha. “Tony?”
“Just a second, baby. Gotta get you all set up.” Tony flipped a switch on the front of the machine and it began making a low hissing sound. He picked up one of the tubes, pressing it against Steve’s swollen nipple. The plastic was just wide enough to completely surround it. As soon as it was flush against Steve’s skin, he could feel the pull, drawing his nipple up into the plastic, stretching the flesh to it’s limit. Some of the pressure released before the process repeated, similar to a mouth insistently sucking at him without pause. Pleasure and pain wrapped up so tightly together there was no longer a difference. The second one was placed over the other nipple, making him ache and clench uncontrollably around the cock buried in his passage.
Steve turned his face away, but not before Tony caught the glimmer of tears in his eyes. “‘S not true.”
Took me a little while to wrangle my muses into cooperating, but I'm back! I hope you enjoy, this chapter was a lot of fun to write. As always, I don't have a beta so any mistakes are mine. Comments and constructive criticism are greatly appreciated. So, with no further ado, enjoy!
"Okay. We're only going to do ten. And since this is your first time, I won't even make you count. Get ready."
“Did you think I’d forget, Steve? I kept the exact measurements. Been working on it for the last week. Say thank you, my sweet omega.”
Tony’s pace quickened, chasing his own orgasm before burying deep and spilling inside of Steve. He could feel every hot pulse of it, each dirty grind of Tony’s cock against the very core of him. Soft whimpers reached his ears, and it took him a moment to realize that he was the one making them.
After a while Steve’s mind drifted from his thoughts to just float hazily. His eyes closed, focused on the touch of Tony’s hand, the rumble of his voice. He was brought back to the present by a firm tug on his hair. “You back with me, pet?”
Steve felt the cool touch of plastic at his rim before wetness flooded into him, dripping back out and down his crack. Tony tossed the lube shooter aside and picked up something he had tucked out of sight. The metal was cold as it pressed against him, slid deep into his passage in one stroke. Almost too deep, and he clenched around it trying to force it back out. The dildo was massive, stretching him open, making him feel like it was going to split him in half. And then it was thrust into him further, so far the line between pain and pleasure was blurring around him. He could no longer tell if he wanted it pressing deeper or pulled out entirely.
Earlier than he normally cared to be up and awake, Tony was readying himself for the day. If he was going to meet potential omegas, he wanted to get it over with sooner rather than later. If they all proved to be a disappointment, it allowed him time to plan his next move. If there was an interesting specimen in the bunch, then he’d want the bulk of the day to prepare. He drove to the location he’d been provided and schooled his features before he stepped inside.
“Good.” True to his word, he started moving again, thrusting carelessly into Steve’s oversensitive body. Each stroke against his rim, each thrust against his prostate made him burn. It felt like his skin was on fire. Too soon he felt Tony pulse inside of him before sliding out and replacing his cock with a thick plug. Steve whimpered, hips grinding down into the sheets.
Finally stepping away from the punching bag, Steve went to take a shower, thinking of his mysterious Sir. A moan slipped free when the water first hit his skin, all of him sensitized from the constant denial. His hands slid over his shoulders, down to cup his pecs and tease at his small pink nipples, pinching and rubbing. It felt even better than usual, causing his cock to twitch in the metal confines of the cage attempting to harden before throbbing relentlessly when it couldn’t.
Sparkles danced across his sight as the drugs began to work on him, all of his limbs feeling heavy. Blackness began to creep in at the edges of his vision, even the fear of where he would be when he woke not enough to keep the world from falling away around him.
"I know you can. Now you just lie there and look gorgeous while I make you scream." He felt Tony settle against his side, and had a brief moment to enjoy the sensation before the toy inside him came to life. The vibrations started off intense, a strong pulsing against his sensitive prostate. It didn't take long before he was sobbing out his release, but it didn't stop. Instead the vibrations became stronger. The oversensitivity was almost painful, and yet he could also feel himself getting hard again.
Steve struggled to find words and failed. He’d been silent for too long and his emotions were too overwhelming. He shook his head, clinging to the lapels of Tony’s jacket, afraid that he would leave when Steve couldn’t obey. But Tony stayed.
Bruce chimed in over the comms. "Not to mention the pictures from the gala that were plastered all over the news."
As he spoke Tony slowly stripped Steve's clothes from his body, tossing them towards a chair in the corner, eyes never leaving his body, until he was spread out on the bed underneath him, bare to his hungry gaze. Steve could practically feel it on his skin like a touch. He ran his hands over his stomach, gently.
Steve howled as the length of the toy stroked over his prostate, the weight of it pulling at his hole with every thrust. His hips jerked and rolled, fucking up into the air in search of any kind of relief. He cried out when a hard hand buried in his hair, dragging his head forward, and then Tony’s cock was buried deep in his throat. He gagged around the length as Tony set a brutal pace. Steve could feel him throbbing, warm and alive, as he thrust into him. It was an intense contrast to the robotic dildo pounding into his ass and the tight metal wrapped around his cock. He moaned around him, feeling Tony spurting down his throat a moment later.
“I know. You’re just so backed up, sweetheart. Have to get you soft here. Releasing nice and easy for me.”
Steve struggled briefly, disoriented, then collapsed against the mattress with a groan as Tony did his best to devour him. He thrust his tongue in and out of him, lapping at his inner walls, rubbing against his omega gland until he released, the rush of slick drenching Tony’s facial hair. He sucked at the spasming hole, reveling in Steve’s cries of pleasure, working him to another quick orgasm. Tony released one of his thighs, pressing two fingers into his clenching passage, rubbing at his sweet spot relentlessly, continuing to lick at the stretched rim. He pushed Steve over the edge again and again until he was sobbing with pleasure. Swollen, soaked, and needy. Only then did he become aware of the babbled pleas falling from Steve’s lips. So lost in the feel and taste of his omega’s body that he hadn’t even heard him speak.
Tony led Steve to an open wall with attachment hooks. He fastened them to the restraints on his wrists, arms spread wide, on display. He looked him over approvingly before his eyes began to glow. Steve let out a cry, knees buckling, as the plug and the cage attachment both vibrated to life.
Bucky curled tighter in on himself. “I-I…” He couldn’t get the words out. Didn’t know what to say. How to explain. Tears welled up in his eyes again.
"Now, I know we hadn't agreed on it before, so be honest. Do you want me to punish you for trying to come without my permission earlier?"
Tony pulled back slightly to study the embarrassment written across his face. “Really now? Well that is interesting. Maybe we should have adult story hour where you tell me all the kinky things you and Barnes used to get up to.”
"Yeah, I think I'm going to decommission this suit. Even I'm not sure if I can get the slime out of it."
Tony’s knot slowly expanded within him, popping in and out, stretching his rim over the bulge, until it was large enough to lock them together. It grew wider, pressing relentlessly on his gland, the pressure maddening. He flailed, unable to hold still, felt Tony pin him to the mattress. Higher and higher until a spasm ran through his body and he was coming, harder and longer than he had in his entire life. The thick cock splitting him open, deeper than he imagined anything could be inside of him, finally satiating the need that had been driving him for so long. He felt it pulse, could feel the heat of Tony’s come filling him, soothing the last of the ache in his core.
I think this might be the filthiest thing I’ve ever written. I’m not sure if I should be ashamed or proud. And we have Tony’s POV. Let me know what you think in the comments, and if you have any ideas or requests for kinks to make an appearance in the story. Enjoy!
Steve took the time to look around. Notice the chaos and creativity present in every inch of the space. Somehow it seems to suit the genius perfectly.
With that Tony gracefully stepped past her and led Steve into the museum. He greeted several people politely as they passed and snagged two glasses of champagne off the tray of a passing waiter. Handing one to Steve, Tony proceeded to escort him through the art on display. Tony was a fascinating companion telling him stories about why he had chosen specific artists for his collection, Pepper's trials tracking down certain pieces, the lengths they had to go to over a particular painting that had gotten stuck in customs.
Tony rubbed soft circles against his chest, murmuring words of comfort against his hair. Tears slid down his face fell onto the blanket beneath him. Steve wasn’t sure when he’d started crying, or when he eventually stopped. All he knew was that his alpha was holding him close, making him feel safe. Treating him like he was important. Worth the effort, maybe.
As soon as his employers had figured out that Captain America wasn’t the symbol of alpha superiority that they’d been led to believe, they couldn’t wash their hands of him fast enough. Unfortunately, the Avengers had followed suit.
Tony arched a brow. “Sir is it? It seems I’ve gotten an upgrade. I like it. Thank you, sweetheart. Now, brace yourself. This is going to hurt.”
Tony sighed, exhausted. “I don’t know what you want, Steve. Just tell me what you want, and if it’s in my power to do so, I’ll give it to you. Would you rather leave the city? Go somewhere new? Name the place. I’ll buy you a beautiful house and get you all set up. I just want to know that you’re safe and taken care of. You… You could start over. Maybe even find a new mate. Someone you wanted to spend your life with. Would you like that?” Tony tried to keep a smile on his face, but it wobbled at the edges, and his dark eyes sparkled with unshed tears.
Steve could feel himself blushing. "Umm... Thank you. I... I don't think I've ever gotten flowers before. They're nice. Come in. I'll try to find a vase or something."
"What's going on with you and Stark? Come on, you've been walking around with a dopey look on your face for a week. What happened?"
"You are. So fucking good for me. And I'm so damned mean to you, aren't I?" Steve nodded against his neck. "And you're trying so hard, aren't you?" Another nod. "You're doing so well. You are."
"It's okay, sweetheart." Tony murmured against his lips. "I'm here. I'll take care of you. I'm never gonna let you go."
"You're a lucky boy. I'm going to be so sweet to you today. Let you come as many times as you like, you don't even have to ask. Say thank you, Steve."
The next two days seemed to drag. Steve couldn't stop imagining what Tony would do to him when he came home. How he would punish him. At night he would dream about their previous scenes, waking up to his cock straining against the cage and his ass clenching desperately around nothing. It was making him crazy. He was counting the minutes until Tony would be home and he could climb him like a tree.
“Okay, sweetheart. I think you’re ready.” Steve moaned again when he felt fingers press against his rim, sliding around in the slick dripping out of him before stroking inside. Tony twisted and scissored his fingers, stretching him, drawing soft whimpers and cries.
Words finally began to penetrate the haze. His throat was dry, his ass sore, and every muscle stiff. Steve groaned, afraid to try to move. “Back with me, sweetheart?” A bottle was pressed to his lips, and Steve greedily drank the cool water.
Steve was completely exhausted after an entire day of being tormented with ruined orgasms. By the time Tony brought him to bed, he collapsed into it gratefully. What he hadn’t expected was for Tony to slide in beside him and gather him into his arms. Steve burrowed against his chest, fighting back tears at the tender gesture. Tony rubbed his back, making soft shushing sounds, eventually soothing him to sleep.
"Almost done sweetheart. Just have to take care of you now." Tony helped Steve find his balance before lowering the cuffs and releasing them, taking the time to rub the soreness out of his wrists. He then led him out of the dungeon and to the bedroom, guiding him to all fours on the bed and kneeling behind him.
Tony shook his head. “You say that every day. You should really know better by now.” Steve glared up at him as Tony tried to calm himself. All the sacrifice would be worth it in the end. “You’re getting sassy, Steve. I think that means we need to move on in your training.”
Steve raised his head enough to weakly glare up at the older man. “I don’t really have a choice, do I?”
Tony leaned forward, teeth digging into the side of his neck and gripping firmly, a growl buzzing against his skin. Steve’s muscles went limp, head falling to the side to expose more of his throat to the other man.”You will obey me, Steve. And when I tell you to do something, that is exactly what you’re going to do. I have been extremely indulgent this past week, but obviously that isn’t what my omega needs. My boy needs something to fight and struggle against. So that is exactly what I’ll give you. Tonight, you are going to rest, because you have still had a very long day. And tomorrow, I’m going to punish you. And when I’m done, we’ll see if you ever disobey me or decide to growl at your alpha again.”
Steve wanted to know what Tony was excited enough to play this game over in the first place. Wanted the older man to force him down on the bed, teasing and torturing him. He took a few cautious steps down the hallway, hesitating long enough for Tony to turn back to him, eyes impatient. With a sigh he relaxed his tired muscles, the plug dropping to the floor a final time. Steve dropped to his knees, head bowed, gazing up through his lashes.
Steve pulled his knees up to his chest, instinctively trying to make himself smaller. “I do. You’re saying I don’t have a choice. So, who is it? Who’s the poor bastard who got stuck with me?” Nightmare scenarios began to flash behind his closed eyes as options like Rumlow or Rollins immediately came to mind.
Tony groaned in his ear once he was fully sheathed inside Steve's body. "You feel so fucking good, baby. Nothing I ever imagined could come close to this." He began to move, sliding back slowly until just the head was still inside, then slamming deep, pulling back on Steve's hips until he had him angled so he could slam into his prostate with each hard thrust.
He could hear the sound of computer keys over the connection. “Rebellious type? Oh, Tony, you’re too predictable sometimes.”
Something was wrong. Something was off. About Steve. About his reaction. But he didn’t have time to figure out what it was before his arms were full. Steve had launched himself at Bucky, arms around his shoulders, legs around his waist, like he had a million time when they were kids. Bucky had caught him out of instinct, then stood there frozen with shock as Steve buried his face in the side of his neck and began to cry. He couldn’t remember the last time Steve had cried. Not during the war, or when he’d been beaten to a pulp. Maybe when his Ma had died, but even then he’d hidden it. Tried to be strong.
“Tony…” Steve leaned up as much as he could, tucking his face against the other man’s neck. “Why do you think I crashed like I did in the gym, instead of anywhere else? It was you. When we’d spar, you’d get so close. I could smell you on my skin for the rest of the day. I could feel you. And I wanted that. So much.”
“There’s my good boy. Why don’t we give it a few days. Get settled in, and then I can start working on your glands?”
“I know it’s not cutting somebody’s balls off and locking them in a cage!” Steve stood, pacing angrily in front of the couch.
“Not gonna be that easy, baby. But points for trying. You stay right here. I’ll be back.” With a wink, Tony walked out of the bedroom towards the rest of the apartment. Steve said a fervent prayer that he wasn’t getting what he thought he was. No one was listening. Or maybe they were. Hard to say. Steve squealed and writhed when Tony pressed the ice pack against his skin. Bucked his hips in a futile attempt to knock it away. His cock softened, shrank beneath the cold. Once Tony was satisfied, he set the ice on the nightstand and picked up the cage he had built for him.
Steve whined in frustration as the fingers withdrew once more. “Be a good boy Steve, and you’ll get to come after I’m done. Now, slight pinch.” He felt the unmistakeable pain of a needle pressing into his prostate, followed by a burning rush. The syringe was withdrawn and set on a tray to the side. “We’ll just give that a minute to work. I want you to be nice and sensitive for me. This one combines particularly well with the serum, so the effects should be permanent.”
“Thank you, Steve. I knew I could count on you.” Tony stood up, rested a hand on Steve’s shoulder. Could probably feel it trembling beneath his palm. “We’re gonna be okay. You’ll see.”
When he finally dared to look up, Tony was looking at him as though he had finally done something interesting. “Quite a lot you’re offering me, Steve. What happens when you change your mind?”
“I’ll need to get things ready for him at the tower. Shouldn’t take long. Have him readied for mounting by this evening. I’ll bring him home after.”
“Wonderful.” Strange stood up, hands making oddly graceful  gestures through the air. They were quickly surrounded by shapes painted from orange light. Steve tried to lean forward, to see them closer, but they seemed to rush around him, causing his stomach to lurch like it had when he was sick. He dropped to his hands and knees, only then realizing he was in a dimly lit apartment alone, not the sitting room with Strange.
“Oh Stevie… You can’t listen to people like that. They ain’t any better than the gossips always talkin’ ‘bout who was runnin’ around with who back in Brooklyn. They ain’t got any idea what’s really goin on.”
A strong hand slid into his hair, firmly tugging his head down. His lips were on Steve's again, but this time they weren't gentle or patient. This was desire and need. Powerful enough to make his knees go weak. He clung to Tony and allowed him to ravage his mouth. Whimpered and chased after his lips when he pulled away. Another soft kiss, and Tony was pulling back. He brushed the backs of his fingers against Steve's cheek, similar to the way Steve had woken him earlier.
When Tony finally risked glancing down at Steve, he was shocked. The omega had a look of soft wonder on his face, a hand resting protectively on his stomach. “You… You want that, alpha?”
“Lube shooter, sweetheart. Got something special for you today.” Thick silicone pressed against Steve’s rim, stretching him impossibly wide. He cried out as it pressed deep, and then deeper still. Steve swore he could feel it in his throat, as his body spasmed around the intrusion. It was pressed far enough into him that the pleasure was painful. He squirmed, desperately wanting it out.
Steve breathed a sigh of relief as he stripped off his uniform and stepped into the steaming shower. It hadn’t been a long mission, that was something to be grateful for. But the missions he was sent on for SHEILD were increasing. In difficulty, length, as well as frequency. It almost felt like they were hoping for him to just… Not make it back. Which did not bear close examination right now. Then again, he felt the same about several things in his life.
True to his word, Tony held Steve still against his body as he struggled. The vibrators continued to work against his prostate and balls, wringing any hint of come from his battered body. Before long the only thing left was a steady ache that grew as the minutes ticked by, becoming an all consuming pain as his body continued to spasm dry. Slowly sensation returned to his hole and abused prostate, making the situation worse. He was past the point of pleasure, floating along on waves of agony.
Steve pressed closer to Tony, desire molten in his veins. He couldn’t imagine lying in bed beside the other man, waiting for his body to calm down and allow him some rest. Anything had to be better than that, right? “I want the second one.”
"I know, baby. But this kind of hurt? I love. You should see yourself. Helpless, and hurting, and completely mine." He knelt on the bed, fisted a hand in his hair, jerking Steve's head back, forcing him to meet his gaze. "This is what it means to be mine. This is what I want from you, what I want to do to you. Over and over again until you can't imagine anyone touching you except for me. Anyone pleasing you but me. Is that what you want, baby? Do you want to belong to me?"
Tony cupped his chin, tilted his face up. “Is this too much, James?” He shook his head, uncertainty written all over his handsome face. “Am I giving you too many decisions?” A hesitant nod. Tony kissed his cheek softly. “Alright, gorgeous. Thank you for letting me know. Kneel for me, baby.”
The season opener was good, quickly drawing him in. Steve stretched out on the couch, so wrapped up in what was on the screen he stopped paying attention to the world around him. Mistake. The plug surged to life inside of him, vibrations at a higher setting then before. His cock was instantly and painfully alive, throbbing within its confines. He writhed on the couch, hips grinding back into the plug then rocking forward into the air. Arousal built higher, flushing his skin, pushing him towards the edge. Just as he was getting close, despite the cage, the vibrations stopped. His hips rocked a few more times, but it was too late. Steve collapsed back on the couch, resigned to his fate.
It was easy to slide under the desk, there was plenty of room after all, and the thick carpeting cushioned his knees making it a fairly comfortable place to be. His hands shook as he unfastened the expensive suit pants and freed the older man’s soft cock. Initially Steve was determined to be good. He carefully took Tony into his mouth, holding him softly on his tongue.
A soft whimper fell from Steve’s lips as he clumsily got his knees under him, lifting his hips. He could feel the slick sliding out of him, dripping over his thighs. He’d been soaked since Tony had bit him in medical. He felt hazy, like he was moving underwater.
Bucky guided them to the sofa, pulling Steve down next to him, still keeping him close. “I got picked up after that one protest, but I assume you remember that part. They hauled me in to one of the clinics. I took out two orderlies before they had me sedated for an exam. Before I knew what was happening, I ended up at the commission.”
Steve attempted to school his features into an expression of innocence. “Did I get carried away, Sir? I just wanted you to feel good.”
Sorry about the wait everyone! I wanted to get this chapter just right, since it sets the tone for everything else to follow. I hope you enjoy it, and plan to have a nice smutty chapter up soon. For now, enjoy soft boys being soft.
He was so innocent and trusting. He still didn’t know how completely Tony owned him now. Could control him. Steve’s first instinct seemed to be blaming himself. Using the nanobots he’d injected to keep his cock soft during their game earlier instead of explaining what he’d done to him was a stroke of genius. Tony idly wondered if Steve would ever figure it out. If he did, it still wouldn’t matter. There was no way to reverse the procedures he’d already performed. And with the modifications to Extremis 3.0 Tony had finished the day before, there would be nothing to stop him. He could keep Steve so docile and mindless with lust, that he’d never think to question him.
Tony pushed him back against the pillows, loomed over him. “I hope you know what you’re asking for, sweetheart. Because if I take you apart right now, it’s gonna be the furthest thing from nice. I’m going to wreck you. Claim you. And never fucking let you go.”
Sometime later he became aware of Tony’s palms rubbing up and down his back, raised his head to greet him with a smile. “Morning.”
“Good. Let’s get you up and fed, and then we can go down to my workshop so you can earn your reward, alright?”
Steve whimpered softly, still rocking back to meet his movements. Slowly he let his head fall to the other side, offering up the unmarked skin. Tony didn’t hesitate. “You’re mine Steve. Mine.” He knew what he was doing this time, knew what to expect. Tony sank his teeth into the swollen gland, tearing through flesh, until he felt the little spasm and gush of sweetness that meant he’d hit the right place.
The next few weeks were busy, but fairly normal. Or at least what passed for normal for superheroes who were regularly called out to save the world from an unending stream of would-be villains. Tony spent a little more time in his workshop, but he was a genius. And even with the extra hours, he found time for Steve on a regular basis, either to take him out on extravagant dates, cuddle on the couch with a movie, or help him discover a laundry list of kinks that he hadn't actually known he had.
Tony nodded, unused to the sense of responsibility weighing heavily on him. It had been a long time since he had needed to care for anyone other than himself. He silently promised that he would do everything necessary to care for the defenseless omega. “Yeah. I’d like that.”
"Good." Tony leaned over and began idly toying with Steve's nipples, pinching and tugging at them, making him squirm. "You know, I bet one of these days I could make you come just from playing with your nipples. I'll have to try it sometime. But for now..." He shifted so he was straddling Steve, hips pressed firmly against his. Every time he moved, his cock rubbed against the other man's, teasing him with what he couldn't have. Now that his hands were both free, Tony returned to teasing his nipples, playing with them until he was desperate underneath him, moans falling from his lips with abandon.
"Good. You might not, in a little while. But don't worry. I'm starting slow for you. I know you don't have the experience."
And another one down! I might not have been writing quite as much lately, but I still have plenty of ideas. I hope you like the ending. Thanks to
Tony stood still when Steve lowered his head and pressed his brow to Tony's shoulder. It would be so easy for Tony to turn his head and kiss away the water from the man's neck.
The sauce was expertly dripped into a love confession. Tony secretly couldn't wait for more. Clint was one funny guy. That sentiment was confirmed the moment they saw the dessert. Clint had really outdone himself and used whipped cream to word a suggestion on the apple pie:
"Clothes." Vision phased through the wall, delivered several towels and clothes and was gone again a second later.
"---I scared him, Nat." He whispered defeatedly. "He was terrified, of me. I saw it in his face." He couldn’t bear her gentle gaze anymore; he didn’t deserve it, and he squeezed his eyes shut in shame.
Steve saw the way Tony stood his ground when the young man took two steps towards him and pointed the gun at Tony's forehead. Steve's heartbeat doubled its speed, and that was his undoing. "Tony," he softly whispered. "Let me talk." They needed to stall to make time for the police to arrive.
It took some time, but Tony finally reined in his giggles. "So, you wined and dined me. What are you going to do with me now, soldier?" But the second the words were out of his mouth, he stilled with understanding. Oh God. Of course. Flowers. Dinner. Date.
Tony sat gingerly on the bed. "Nothing. HYDRA wants you hurt or dead, but we don't know where they're hiding," he murmured. He watched Steve without further words. Tony couldn't imagine what he would have done had HYDRA been successful. He didn't want to imagine his life without Steve in it.
"Can someone take a picture?" Sam asked when Tony passed him. Unfortunately, Tony held precious cargo in his arms and couldn't punch him.
Tony dove in with his tongue the moment Steve slowly allowed him access to his mouth. His fingers trailed through the soft hair on Steve's nape, and he wound his other arm around his waist, anchoring the super soldier to his body. Finally tasting Steve felt so good his eyes almost crossed behind his eyelids. But thank God he wasn’t the only one affected by their kiss: Tony could feel Steve's heart hammering inside his chest.
Tony couldn't stop staring. It was the same face that had been contorted with fury as he swung the shield into Tony's arc reactor, but at the same time, it was also the man who had protected him on so many occasions.
However, some things still needed to be clarified. "So, he's going to beat this shit with his super serum, and he will be absolutely alright?"
Tony heard the concern in his friend's voice. "I'm fine, Dad," he stated hastily, but with the last word his chest clenched in pain.
It was fascinating how such a kind, friendly, and open face could warp with determination and anger. As he stared at the photo, Tony's world shrunk down to the seconds when that same smiling person had pinned him to the cold ground, eyes hard as he raised the shield for a final blow. Only a week ago, Tony would have sworn Steve Rogers would never harm him. And yet just few days before, Tony had been in mortal danger from the man he had trusted most. It was like Obadiah all over again.
Unfortunately yes, Steve knew that. It had been the main reason why he tried to never physically overpower Tony. All too clearly, he remembered Tony's flashback when Steve had protected him against the metal spider robots. How could he be so selfish as to crave Tony underneath him while knowing at the same time how it would scare the man? Something was seriously wrong with him!
"That's true," Steve could second Tony's opinion. He watched him study the details of the room and then start talking about the Mayor's antiqued mahogany table. Steve's heart started to feel a bit warmer, because from the furniture in the Mayor's mansion they smoothly steered the conversation to the Tower's equipment and furnishings.
Tony's heart was drumming in his chest. The hot water had nothing to do with his entire body suddenly being on fire. The steam enveloped them in a warm embrace. The air thickened. Time slowed down. The sound of falling water faded to the background, and Tony couldn't move.
"He’s fine." Tony mustered a smile. "Handsome as ever and still the cryptic little bastard who happens to wear black spandex and claws in times of crisis."
"Tony, they tried to kill you." Steve looked at him seriously. "I will rip them apart. Each and every one of them if I have to."
Steve was sitting on a bench in Central Park, his shoulders hunched. Kids were shouting cheerfully in front of him playing with their parents. Runners never looked his way. Thankfully, they didn't know his identity. In case someone went near him, he wore a black cap on his head. All the noise his super senses received, Steve's mind didn't even process.
In that super-serum-induced brain of Steve's, he could almost hear the sound of breaking bones. He had heard it so many times on the battlefield. It was too familiar. All it would take would be a second of distraction and he would hurt Tony. Perhaps not irreparably, but he would have to live with the knowledge of having done so for the rest of his life.
"Did you know you're glowing with pride and happiness when you talk about something you love?" Tony turned to Steve, but Steve was pretty sure he couldn't see much in the darkness.
"There is no beauty in love either. In the end, there's only heartbreak," Tony snorted cynically. "Just heartbreak." Tony's heart had repeatedly made the mistake of loving someone who deserted him in the end. He was not happy with himself, but one couldn't dwell on something that couldn't be changed.
"Except he's not talking about you, and he's killing himself in the process of finding a solution for Rhodes' situation. How about you?" She glanced at the drawing. "Nursing your crush, I see. So, nothing unusual on your front either."
This whole situation was also Steve's fault. As much as they teased each other, they still didn't go much further than kissing because Tony waited for Steve to bring the subject onto the table. And Steve, confused as ever, didn't know how to broach the subject without feeling mortified simultaneously. He was a good fifty years Tony’s senior, and still, some things took him longer than average teenagers.
First of all, we have to apologize for the long period of time with no update. My dearest beta is having her finals and that's more important than proof reading. So, thank you all for your patience.
Tony finally gave up. With the food gone, he ignored the rest of the world as he repaired Iron Man's primary suit.
"Is that wrong of me, Boss?" FRIDAY's unsure voice made Tony think about his question again. He knew his AI sometimes needed guidance and didn't want to disappoint him. He could always count on her being on his side of things, but it suddenly looked like she changed her mind about Steve. She wasn't as vicious as before. She sure as hell was still giving him a hard time and was evidently evading his questions, but something had changed for her.
Tony wanted nothing more than to forbid his thoughts to even go there. It was not possible. It was absolutely pointless to think about it, after all, it couldn't be true. Steve had loved Peggy Carter for half of his life and the other half he had spent pining after his supposedly dead friend. He sure as hell wouldn't have feelings for Tony.
Steve pressed his forehead to Tony's. He felt defeated, at a loss as to how to reply to that. He needed to trust Tony. The billionaire knew himself better than anyone else, but still, there was another thing to address. "You should know that I don't feel any pressure from you. I'm just---" Steve swallowed. "---cautious."
"You're wrong." Steve was aware Tony was trying to provoke a reaction from him. They both knew each other too well.
like a beloved national icon capable of protecting the world. Tony wanted nothing more than to hold him in his arms until Steve had gained his strength back. The vulnerability spoke to some primal part in Tony and woke the need to protect the super soldier at any cost inside him.
Steve saw the War Machine suit levitate and then land back on its feet to face them. A second later, the armor started to fold back into itself.
If Steve was honest with himself, he himself hadn't known until there was all of a sudden the scary possibility of him leaving it. "It's nothing you have to take into consideration." The thing was, Steve didn't only love the Tower. He loved the family and friends he had found there. The place felt like home. And he most definitely loved its owner.
wrong with me right now?" Tony spoke self-deprecatingly, but he was still amazed by the vulnerability in Steve's eyes. "Can you honestly say I'm your prince Charming, huh? Sweaty? Stained with who knows what? I look like---"
Tony wanted to reply, but he turned quickly to Steve instead when he noticed his breathing was far too labored and the skin in Tony's grip felt too warm to the touch. "Steve? Bruce!" He quickly backed away and let the doctor examine him.
Tony dragged his eyes to Steve's face. This awkward atmosphere was worse than them yelling at each other. Steve looked pale, and he obviously had trouble breaking his stare from Iron Man's chest plate, as if he was lost in his own memories of Siberia as Tony had been before. But damn, the blond man looked good. At least Tony could be satisfied he had a good taste in men.
"Team Captain?" Steve was momentarily confused before his gears kicked in. "You mean in the Civil War?" The question coaxed a small smile from the young man.
"Steve, one thing I can say safely is that I'm not heartbroken anymore. Just as I don't think about the torture in Afghanistan every night, I don't think about our Civil War either. Yeah, I do have flashbacks or I sometimes feel uneasy, but it's in my head. I can conquer
"Love you back!" Tony gave him a small wave with a blinding smile and waited for Rhodey to leave. When the doors finally shut behind his friend, he could breathe more easily. "Now, where were we?" Tony's attention moved to his AI.
Tony considered his creation on the workbench. His thoughts were again occupied with Steve. He abandoned the wheelchair completely with a frustrated sigh. It was pointless to invent something when his head was stuck in a different place. He thought back on FRIDAY's comments and turned. "FRIDAY, why are you talking to him now?"
"There is nothing between me and Bucky." Steve was getting annoyed by these suggestions. "I'm not and won't ever be in love with Bucky."
"The temperature of the room is steady. The thermostat is working at one hundred percent. It didn't deviate from your personal preferences in years, Boss," FRIDAY answered calmly.
They were finally there. Together. Separated from the others. Not Captain America or Iron Man. Only Steve Rogers and Tony Stark, and the idea scared Tony shitless. This was the situation he had tried to avoid at any cost because Tony knew very well how it would end.
"Captain Rogers has asked repeatedly about your health, Boss. You were in your rooms for too long for his liking, and he had appeared to be concerned."
The smug bastard only continued to smile with flushed cheeks. Tony looked back at the rose. "You went out just to give me a flower?"
"We do not have to create a scene. That is not what the people in this room want to see. We are going to take a walk." T'Challa's eyes never left Tony's.
The manual labor helped clear Tony's mind and at the same time gave him a chance to process his conversation with Steve. He was aware something had changed between them. He just couldn't put his finger on what it was precisely yet. His mind obsessively dwelled on
"No!" Steve interrupted him forcefully and came closer. He didn't let Tony finish his sentence. He had heard it before. Everyone had always left Tony behind. That flippant statement would always be Tony's universal answer for everything. In the past, this had usually been the moment Tony snapped and started an angry tirade. Steve wanted to believe those days were over and they had put all that behind them.
"It looks like you need to hit someone. I don't wish to inconvenience my guards with dry cleaning or explaining your blood on my clothes."
But then, in the blink of an eye, Tony shifted on the chair, sat more appropriately and released Steve from his longing gaze. He could finally breathe again.
Only when T’Challa had come to say goodnight, she had finally left. Tony hadn’t felt any satisfaction watching her leave. He wanted to be left in peace, but at the same time, he wanted to confide in Pepper to what was happening in his life. But how do you talk to your ex about loving someone else? How do you talk about your own heartbreak?
"I think we’ve had enough," Steve said. "I don't care what happens to me, but no one attempts to harm the members of this team. Not on my watch. From this moment on, we're at war and have one enemy only - HYDRA. No matter what the government says, we're protecting each other and going after them. Any complains?"
Anthony Stark stood in front of the door to Steve Rogers' room in Avenger Tower, fingers still painfully clutching Steve’s letter. Wrong choice of words. The letter was from Captain America, not Steve Rogers. He couldn't make the same mistake again and think that Captain America and Steve were two people. No. Captain America had almost killed him. He was the same man as Steve Rogers, his former friend, his teammate, his...  the Avenger.
Tony wanted to say something. He really, sincerely wanted to open his mouth, but the words flew from his mind, and his throat was stuck with a lump the size of the United States. Steve's voice in that soft tone was his doing, and that realization made him tear up.
Steve, clad in his Captain America armor, nervously followed Tony to the love seat in the studio. His senses were overwhelmed with all the noise and chatter from the live television production of the show they were supposed to appear in. He left the seat closer to the female host to Tony.
It was only after the glass of the reactor had shattered that Steve could see the irreparable damage his action had caused. Tony was staring at him, eyes wide and an expression of naked fear and betrayal on his face. That look gutted Steve, and as he looked down at the engineer, the frustration and righteous fury that had powered Steve throughout the fight abruptly left him. There was no recognition in Tony’s eyes; he looked at Steve as if he were a stranger, as if he had never seen him before.
"For my genius brain, I would certainly say I'm an idiot, because tonight was the first time that it finally clicked for me. You were talking about me that way."
"Thanks, buddy," Tony whispered. He immediately winced, ashamed of his words. He didn't have any right to refer to T'Challa that way. It really wasn't very respectful behavior towards the king.
"I love you. I will always protect you," he vowed fiercely. "Even if I am the threat." He kissed Tony's lips softly, breathing in the familiar scent of Tony's cologne, sweat and motor oil.
Steve slid a hand over Tony's lower back and carefully pressed him towards himself. After their encounter in the shower, Steve had learned to be more conscious of his movements. He finally knew how his body would react to Tony's and could at least prepare himself for the onslaught of emotions. But as much as he wanted to say he was controlling himself with Tony, every kiss was a battle.
It was then that Vision materialized through Tony's body beside Steve. "I beg to differ, Captain Rogers."
He was hopelessly embarrassed, because Tony knew the truth. "Sorry," Steve breathed with difficulty.
Tony swung his chair back around and rolled his eyes. He made a show of looking at his friend like Rhodey had a brain injury instead of a severed spinal cord. "Rhodey, I work on my robots and AIs all the time. Just because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not happening."
Steve sighed fondly. It wasn't Tony's fault, Steve had practically invited that question into their conversation. "More like I will hurt you long before the---" He wanted to find another word, but the eloquence had left him as Tony stared into his eyes. Steve was forced to use Tony's exact word, but he cringed internally, "---
"Nat?" Tony sidestepped Steve when Vision and Natasha entered the room from the main doorway. The rest of the Avengers gathered around them as well.
"Right," Tony whispered almost inaudibly. He had to visibly drag himself out of the memories. "Isn't it a bit cold in here, FRIDAY?"
"Colonel Rhodes and Vision have already arrived at the Gala," FRIDAY told them, "and I have been instructed to inform you that Doctor Banner's invitation was unfortunately lost and not delivered so he won't be attending tonight."
"You deserve to have someone you can feel safe with. God knows we're doing a bang-up job with it." Tony was surprised that Steve didn't put it as a question. He just stated the truth which looked to Tony as if he didn't like it at all.
"Why? I have work to do." Tony had currently been working on Steve's shield with safety goggles on his face and welding torch in hand. The Iron Man suit was in top condition already.
Tony could see Captain America freezing for a second when he saw Iron Man hitting the concrete, then speeding towards Tony, hunching over him to cover the suit from a metallic spider and the explosion, and then Vision arrived. Steve was saying something to the android.
"I know. But you said it yourself, at least we have something to look forward to after the Gala." Steve winked at him and closed the door behind them.
No one would accuse Tony Stark of not following every little lead when he had something to figure out.
The absolute terror on Tony's face in Siberia was suddenly making much more sense. Tony had had dangerous shrapnel embedded into his chest for years. Someone had surgically removed a large portion of his sternum and put the arc reactor in instead to save his life.
"Why am I feeling like a lab rat?" Rhodey asked, out of breath, but finally sitting in the new wheelchair.
Steve finally asked a coherent question, but he still had that haunted look in his eyes. Tony wanted nothing more than to change that. Steve should not look this uncertain. Maybe he should finally say something. "Good."
I would like to apologize for the delay. I was on the trip in London and my work schedule didn't cooperate with me when I got back. But I'm back on weekly updates.
want to sign the Accords with the rest of the Avengers, but to hell with everything, more than that, he wanted to be back home in his workshop. Hiding from the rest of the world sounded better by the minute.
Steve was dressed in his military uniform, silently working through his dinner at the fancy mansion. He had answered the questions, but just as it had been decided previously, the rest of the talking was left to Tony. He thrived on social events, tonight being just another example. Tony was charming as ever. He joked at his own expense, never belittling others. He looked absolutely at ease. No one would guess the man's thoughts.
"I'm talking about Wanda. Ultron." Steve continued without a pause. "She enchanted you, but we blamed you no less." Steve didn't know if he should touch Tony or rather stay away from him right now, because the tension in his body was way too familiar. Tony looked like a coiled snake ready to attack any moment.
"Are you fucking kidding me?" Tony bellowed loudly and didn’t give a rat’s ass if the whole hospital staff could hear him. "He just went away and you let him?"
Tony frowned upon hearing the amused tone of his AI. "Who bothers with counting the hours of my sleeping schedule?"
Tony propped him up against the far wall inside the shower cubicle, but Steve struggled to free himself. "For God’s sake, at least stay still," Tony huffed with annoyance. He pressed his upper body against Steve's to keep him upright and blindly searched for the tap. However, he couldn’t find it. Why again did he feel the need to have the showers so big? He was too far away to reach. Luckily, he knew a different solution.
"More like undress," Steve corrected casually with a wink, and Tony's mind stalled. Now he was nervous, thank you very much. Steve wouldn't---
. Steve had just smiled, pleased with himself and the world in general. Tony had ignored the whole class of school children - they were all so beneath him - and focused on the video conference.
"Let’s do this. Avengers, back to action. Tony, War Machine, you're with me. We're coordinating with the Secret Service and closing every exit. Hawkeye, you're securing the window. Falcon's with you. Scarlet Witch, find out if anyone of the attendants is hiding something. Be thorough, please."
Tony hated that reasonable voice. He sneered. "Do you even know---" But he didn't get far, because the king of Wakanda suddenly stepped closer, and Tony's brain shut down in surprise.
When the details were finally hammered into his mind and Tony would be able to repeat them in his sleep, Pepper let him off the hook and left him to his thoughts. Tony didn’t know if it was better or worse. He palmed the tablet in his pocket, looked at some of his measurements and ideas for making Rhodey’s suit even better and tried to lose his mind in the details and inventing. Not that it helped any, because he was still aware of Steve’s body near his. When he closed his eyes, he could almost feel the warmth radiating from the super soldier.
"I hate this," Tony complained, probably for the millionth time since the moment they all had received the expensively crafted invitations.
Steve nodded in acknowledgement. Tony was gifted with a lot of things, and one of them had always been perceptiveness. Tony didn't only have a genius brain, he could use it as well and draw consequences from other people’s actions. Steve was honored by that to some extend, after all he was important enough to Tony for him to watch him that closely and know his habits.
Steve didn't bat an eye when they were finally face to face. His armor was bulletproof, after all. He was just grateful Tony had stayed behind him. "Son, you don't want to do that," he stated calmly.
Tony smirked. He could almost picture it to the detail. FRIDAY telling Steve he was alright and at the same time insinuating Steve's concern had been justified.
Tony had to stop the words from coming. He turned his head and captured Steve's lips with his own. Tony's insides made a violent twist, and his stomach dropped. Every nerve ending in his body sparkled to life. The wave of heat punched Tony's breath out of his lungs. He could do nothing but hold onto the dark blue scrubs Steve was still wearing and try to calm his racing heart.
He didn't have to wait long for T'Challa to sit beside him. Tony sighed. "The time's not important. It just--- it was all written on his face when we were having dinner with the Mayor."
Steve admired Pepper Potts. Without batting an eye, the woman shook her head at Tony and was capable of talking like Steve's speech wasn't anything out of ordinary. But for Steve, the moment hadn't been forgotten. He caught Tony looking his way repeatedly throughout the rest of the dinner.
"Nothing would make me happier, Boss," she replied sarcastically, obviously reluctant and as far from happy as one could be in her situation.
Yeah, maybe that crazy geriatric was right. Tony had overreacted as always. But who could blame him under these circumstances?
Steve stared at his fists where they rested on his knees as if they were the most interesting thing in the world. It took a moment for him to force out the words.
"You could have died, and you're telling me to mind my words?" Tony was now full on his warpath. All his fear had been channeled into anger. His heart couldn't take another incident like before when someone had tried to kill Steve. "What if HYDRA agents were watching the Tower? What if they're waiting for the right moment to snatch you off the street and do some more experiments with that poison? Or kill you?" Tony's voice broke. "You could---" He cut himself off and took a deep breath. Steve could have ordered anything to be delivered to their Tower online. "You could---" Tony tried again as he helplessly watched Steve come towards him.
"Sometimes---" Tony's hoarse voice stirred something at the bottom of Steve's stomach, but Tony cleared his throat and started again, this time with a soothing tone. "Sometimes you're impossible."
Second of all, For those who want to read how Rhodey and FRIDAY saved the day at the end of this chapter, there is a snippet called
"FRIDAY, zoom in on his face. Rewind it to when Steve was talking. Good. Wait. Play it again." Tony didn't have any decent audio input since the Avengers were destroying the metal monster in the background. The scene had been one big loud clatter of noise. People were screaming on the streets. As much as Tony wanted to, he couldn't isolate the sound of one certain voice, but he wasn't a genius for nothing. There was a chance to figure out what was Steve saying. Tony would have to read his lips.
When Tony's eyes made contact with Vision, the android inclined his head minimally in acknowledgement. "I shall go back and inform King T'Challa and FRIDAY you are unharmed."
Tony swallowed with some difficulty when Steve's fingers rested on the place where the arc reactor had once been. No one would feel any difference between Tony’s breast bone replacement and a real one, but Tony hated how naked he felt at that moment.
The super soldier caressed Tony's cheek. "It won't happen again. I swear." Steve wound his other hand around Tony's waist and pulled him closer. He didn't like the vulnerability in his eyes. Everything within him screamed to reassure Tony he would always be safe with him.
"I will gladly tell you about myself. I’m that irresponsible, reckless billionaire who broke your heart. You know better than to try and make me a good guy here. I won’t be the one complicating T’Challa’s life." And most of all, he couldn’t see T’Challa that way. No matter how much of a good-looking guy T’Challa was, Tony’s heart still belonged to the man currently eavesdropping in the presidential suite with them.
For the first time, Tony had stood against Captain America, and in that moment, he had known the superhero would kill him. The man had worn the same face as his friend, Steve, but had been steadily pressing onto the glass of the already damaged arc reactor, and Tony had known these were his last seconds.
Tony held out his hand when nobody moved. "Bruce?" The only person with a lab coat was to save the day in a wholly different way now.
That's what Steve told Vision with agonizing eyes. With a heavy heart, Tony let the screen freeze on Steve's face. No one would fake this much concern. Especially not the super soldier who never lied, and his features were like an open book. Well, almost never lied, but Tony didn't want to open up that can of worms again.
Steve stood paralyzed by the sight of Tony's chest. To the tiniest detail, he remembered the terror in Tony's eyes when he had been lying beneath him on the concrete in Siberia.
The hope in the man's eyes made Steve regret every wrong word he had ever said to Tony. "No. That's what I thought before I knew him. The Tony I know is willing to listen to me talk about my drawings until three a.m. and never complain."
It was several moments before Natasha broke the silence again. "You know, I betrayed Tony’s trust when I let you leave with Bucky, but he still warned me that Ross was going to come after me, and he let me remove myself from the Tower to prevent myself from being caught," she said in a considering tone. Then she shrugged. "Nothing's ever just black and white, Steve, and Tony has always been discerning of that gray. I think, in time, he’ll understand your reasons and everything will be alright."
Tony sighed heavily. Damn. Of course FRIDAY didn't have it. How could he have forgotten? He could almost hear the lecture from his AI. She didn't disappoint him and continued her explanation.
"It will be fun," Tony assured her quickly. He would finally have all his robots around again. At least a fragment of his past would be back.
Tony could almost feel his bubble of happiness slowly leaking out. One small piece would be back, but the bigger one  was still missing forever. His JARVIS. He deliberately kept his mind as far away as possible from thinking about Vision. Tony could exist with the idea of his life being in pieces, but Vision talking to him as JARVIS was one heartbreak too much. Anyway, Butterfingers wasn't the only thing he needed to work on.
"Because I am a super soldier." Steve shifted his eyes to the floor. The uncomfortable heat in his cheeks betrayed his embarrassment.
The moment they touched the roof of the hotel, Tony acted his part as was expected of him. He had a blinding smile on his face, complimented every staff member they encountered, used his motor mouth and talked nonsense all the time they were in public, because that was what Pepper and the others expected.
"More like you're reading a different book. In a different house. In a different country. Probably somewhere in Europe, halfway across the world from me," Steve mumbled, confused. He shook his head. "I don't feel any pressure."
"I think I beat you in your own game, Mr. Stark." Steve grinned smugly. "Eat your dessert. We have somewhere to be."
Hello, I'm still alive and I have a few things to say. First, I want to apologize. These past few months were hectic. My friend/co-worker was diagnosed with cancer. So I'm spending half of my time at work and the other cheering her up. It's a long, exhausting process. Sometime I have these amazing ideas, but unfortunately no time to write, or I don't have the energy to do anything more than sleep. But I want one thing to be clear - I'M NOT GIVING UP MY STORIES. It will just take some time to finish them. Second, I added my wonderful beta as a co-author of this story. And third, merry Christmas to every one of my readers. You are all so wonderful. :)
The screen slid down, and here he was, Steve Rogers with those fucking puppy dog eyes and the bastard lying and saying,
Tony's focus was laser sharp on the small device clenched in a vice which he was currently working on. He had tried to put the fucking bolt into the hole for the fifteenth time, and the motherfucker just didn't stay there. With a frustrated exhale and anger seething through his movements, he finally forced the device out with his fingers and threw it as far away from himself as possible. It didn't help at all. He was still pissed off, and he felt like murdering someone. Most definitely himself.
Tony shouldn't be turned on by Steve’s taking charge attitude. It really wasn't a good time, but he couldn't help himself. Before the Avengers could scatter around the premises, Steve reached out to Clint’s shoulder.
"Yes, I know." Tony remembered their discussion. He hadn't wanted security cameras around. The only places permitted to recording were the entries and exits of the Tower. He must have had a moment of weakness to think the Avengers
"Hi," Tony whispered, stunned by the gesture, and accepted the rose without thinking. His mouth hung open, scolding words forgotten. After a second he shook his head. His brain had finally kicked back online. "What the fuck, Rogers!"
"Why? What do you mean, ‘why’?" Tony shook his head helplessly. "Because I smell like sweat. Because I’ve been working on Rhodey's suit, and I don't even remember for how many days in a row. Because I can't remember the last time I showered. Because I have fucking motor oil under my fingernails. Because the last time my undershirt saw a washing machine was sometime last week. I think." Tony hesitated. He honestly couldn’t remember. Not the point, though. "Because I'm a fucking mess and you're---" How could Tony make him understand? "---you. You did all of this and---"
Steve had almost forgotten that their silence was sometimes permeated by Tony's artificial intelligence, FRIDAY, as well. Right now, she sounded very offended.
Wanda and Sam appeared beside them a moment later, starting to create a protective circle. Rhodey didn't even hesitate, he activated his wheelchair and suited up in the midst of the crowded room.
"Guys, here’s your blanket." Bruce gave Tony the fabric and stepped back while Tony wrapped it around Steve's shoulders. "I talked to the doctors. We have a bed ready for you."
"Well, esthetics are important. And you do know that the whole building is powered by an arc reactor, right? But, sure, make fun of your home." Tony's attention turned back to the monitors. "Come back later."
"Dummy, pass me the soda from the refrigerator. FRIDAY, show me the footage of the security camera from the moment Rogers entered here." Tony sat in his chair, messily eating the food, napkins forgotten. The screen changed to the image of him and Steve.
"FRIDAY, anything new?" Tony mumbled, distracted by the weight of Rhodey's wheelchair he was currently situating on the workbench.
Steve hadn't taken his eyes off Tony the entire night, and now he chuckled in amusement. "What did you say about seducing me, Mr. Stark?"
"Oh, shut up!" Tony snarled. "I'm furious. I'm mad as hell. I'm fucking pissed!" Tony was a lot of other things as well. Tired of being the one to hurt people around himself was on top of the leaderboard. Paired up with heartbroken, because all he wanted to do was take Steve into his arms and wipe the hurt from the super soldier's face.
Just as Steve expected. She would be pestering him for answers all afternoon if he didn't give her answers. After all, the Black Widow was patient and had an extensive knowledge of interrogation techniques. In the worst case, she would wait him out. That would certainly sour his afternoon.
Now, the Avengers all took interest and asked Steve some questions which Tony ignored. He kept kneeling beside the bathtub in his suit and held Steve's hand like he had from the moment the super soldier had woken up.
A few hours later, Tony was sitting in Pepper’s chopper with Steve by his side, and they were on their way to a hotel somewhere. He didn’t give a fuck where exactly. All he wanted was a quiet place to exist without his thoughts being haunted by the man sitting next to him. He could already feel the beginning of another headache.
"You both figured it out too late. Too many things have happened." T'Challa rested his fingers on Tony's forearm. "Due to your bond it's now even harder to make peace with your past mistakes."
Tony tried to forget his embarrassment, opened his eyes and put a smile on his face. It probably looked a lot like his fake mask for cameras.
"May I ask what is it you're searching for, Boss? I could be of help if you would specify what you want to find." FRIDAY sounded confused.
"That's why I'm here," Tony smirked. "Don't worry. I will charm them all. You have to tell her some facts, throw in some ‘
Tony saw him visibly hunch his shoulders, as if Steve wasn't sure how to explain himself. This was the side of the super soldier not many people got to see, and it was successfully pulling on Tony's heart strings.
Steve's whisper in that grateful tone made Tony feel guilty. He understood very well what the super soldier felt. Tony was scared shitless by the idea of Steve getting hurt again, too.
"You're fine just as you are," Steve assured him, but it didn't help at all. Tony was panicking at the idea of being wined and dined in a pair of stupid sweatpants and nothing but an undershirt. Something must have been visible on his face, because Steve was quick to reassure him with a firm voice, "Tony, I'm not here to date your clothes. Sit down, put the rose where it belongs and enjoy dinner." Steve winked at him.
"I know that." Rhodey paused for a moment, then continued after a moment with one of their usual snarky remarks. "And this is not a secret lair. Batman has a secret lair, Tony. You have majestically-in-your-face glowing Tower with a big "A" on it and probably stratospheric electricity bills."
"Do you want me with you, Tony?" Black Widow asked, obviously interested in the afternoon delight in the darkness. It was like they couldn’t wait to go anywhere with Tony and help him. It grated on Tony’s nerves.
Steve's heart gave a painful twitch. He felt mortified because it had never occurred to him he could feel attraction towards Tony. Attraction? Who was he kidding. "How---" He stopped with a tight throat. Words really weren't his strong suit.
"FRIDAY told me. She saw a few seconds from the show's preview, but then it was interrupted and they changed the program. Safe bet something was going on," Rhodes smirked. "I couldn't stay at home so we just decided to do something out of your handbook and made a reckless decision," he grinned, and that was all it took for Tony to smile back with pride.
But then again - why the hell would Steve tell Tony about his problems? What had Tony expected? That they would suddenly be the best fucking pals and pick each other’s fucking braids?
"Some scrubs would be perfect, guys," Tony announced into the silent room. They were still in the hospital, but apparently nobody felt the need to use their brains anymore. After Tony’s implied request, the Avengers ultimately scattered and gave them some privacy. Bruce was the only person who remained.
Steve’s eyes snapped open with alertness when Tony carefully laid him down on the bed. "You’re fine." Tony reassured him automatically. "It’s your hospital bed. Are you with me?"
Tony allowed himself a few minutes of weakness, but anger was slowly starting to simmer under his skin.
Tony's brain couldn't focus. His body betrayed his every move. Every sensation seemed to be new and more intense than anything he had experienced before. He was almost afraid how it would feel to deepen the kiss. And to hell with everything, this was not an innocent peck at all, because Tony wanted to let loose and get lost in the sensation.
Hawkeye just gave them both a silent nod of acknowledgement and went after Sam to carry out Steve's order. Tony wanted to speak up, but Steve's pleading eyes stopped him.
Tony internally squirmed under Steve's gaze. But nothing would make him shy away from those eyes. He was still Tony Stark. Stark men didn’t shy away from anything. Yet, that right there was not how Steve should look at him in a room full of people.
Tony separated their lips only for millimeters and opened his eyes. Steve looked at him with apprehension. Just waiting for Tony to do something. Probably to push him away. And Tony finally had enough. Enough of his fear of getting close to the super soldier and getting hurt again. Enough of his fear of losing Steve.
Tony shut his mouth when they finally reached their suite. He threw the Ray-Bans on the bed with Egyptian cotton sheets. On the bright side, it was the best presidential suite that was available. On the other hand, Pepper had conveniently happened to forget the detail that he and Steve were sharing the room. Apparently, they had to show the world they were best friends forever and would never again do another stupidity such as fighting against each other.
Movement out of the corner of his eye caught his attention. Tony slid a hand around the back of his neck, thumb pressed to a slight indent in the metal. “You ready sweetheart?” Steve nodded and Tony pressed his thumb down firmly, held it in place until a blue light glowed from underneath.
They stayed there until James and Steve had both calmed. Tony rubbed softly over the marks the restraints had left on Steve’s wrists and ankles, then turned his attention to James. The prostate massager was carefully removed, and Tony gathered him up, carrying him back to the bedroom and depositing him gently on the pile of blankets. He placed another soft kiss on James’ lips before returning to the playroom and lifting Steve into his arms, bringing him back to bed as well. Tony stripped off his clothes and settled all three of them into a comfortable tangle of limbs and bare skin.
Note: The slight DubCon warning only applies to Steve being observed without his knowledge while in privacy mode. This is not a rape or coercion fic.
Steve was a whimpering wreck on the bed as the last of the saline disappeared inside of him. His stomach swollen so large he looked pregnant. The extreme discomfort was warring with Steve’s desire to be good. Accessing the implant, Tony cued up mild vibrations, just enough to slowly stimulate his prostate despite the cramping in his intestines. Then he returned to stroking Steve’s hard cock, working him back to the edge and pushing him over.
The bright flush on Steve's cheeks made Tony smile, he brushed his fingertips over his cheekbone then down over his lips. "If that's what we both enjoy, then yeah. But I want to hear it. At least once. Do you like it when I make you wait, Steve?"
A moment later Bucky was stepping in close, wrapping him in a tight hug. Steve buried his face against a wide shoulder, the familiar presence enough to bring tears to his eyes. “Hey now. It’s okay, Stevie. You’re okay.”
Tony gently urged Steve onto his side, curling their bodies together, trying desperately to soothe the distraught omega.
Steve gasped at the words, tears welling up in his eyes. He was right. It might not be how he pictured it, but this is what he came here for. Tony would give him what he deserved. What he needed. “A-as many as you want, Tony.”
“I also expect you to pay attention when you’re being punished. Now, did you hear what I just said?” Steve slowly shook his head, apprehension tying his stomach in knots. “What I was saying was that I have spoken with Bruce. He’s looked at your scans, and believes that you should have started a cycle by now. The fact that you haven’t could be a symptom of damage to your reproductive organs. Apparently this is a treatment that he’s used with omegas in the past and had success with. I’ve been trying to think of a way to make this nicer for you. But since you’ve earned a punishment anyway… Well, two birds, one stone. All that.”
Bucky rocked back against him, thrusting against the clever fingers that were working him so well. Tony pressed harder, and Bucky broke. He released Steve to scream out his own orgasm, come leaking from the tip of the cage in a steady flow. It was Steve’s turn to hold him immobile, wrapping his arms and legs around Bucky as Tony continued to rub the sensitive gland, quickly building him to the edge again. He fell over it with a cry, shuddering, unable to move or think, focused only on the sensations, the pleasure burning through him and wiping everything else away.
"You will be. For starters, I think you've earned yourself a few more days locked up. We have to teach that disobedient little cock of yours some manners, now don't we?"
I do have to make a note here so that *my* Dom doesn't kill me. Of course in the real world consent should be well established before anything takes place, and kink negotiation should be a serious conversation. That having been said, I hope you enjoyed.
He needed Steve to be completely filled with his seed and his claim. Dimly Tony also hoped that Steve was receptive enough to catch this heat, already planning on keeping him plugged for as long as possible afterwards. He wanted his mate to carry his child. To know that a piece of them both was growing inside the sweet omega. He was certain that Steve would be an amazing mother, and that having their child to care for would do wonders for his security and temperament.
She smiled. "I'm glad. Look, I first met Antoshka during a really bad time for him. He's been through a lot. And so have you. If you find something that makes you happy in this fucked up world, my advice is to grab it and hold on with both hands."
“My pleasure, sweetheart.” He nuzzled at the torn flesh of Steve’s neck, couldn’t seem to help himself. They’d need to talk in the morning. Unsurprisingly, Tony now had even more questions about omega anatomy than he’d had before, and they’d need answers. Steve belonged to him now, and Tony would give him everything he needed. Steve snuggled back, the acidic tinge of distress was gone from his scent. It was warm and soft now. Soothing. Tony wrapped his arms around his omega and drifted to sleep.
Okay, work is really boring, so I seem to be averaging about two chapters a day. Not sure how long that’ll last, so please, enjoy it while you can.
Clever fingers slipped the plug free from his hole before sliding in to take their place, rubbing firm circles against his prostate. Steve arched up with a cry, rocking back against them, driving them deeper. He saw Tony’s eyes begin to glow bright blue above him, felt the strangle hold of the cage around his cock ease slightly.
“Fuck you!” Steve tried to roll off the bed, forgetting that his ankles were bound in his haste. He ended up collapsed on the floor at Tony’s feet. He let out a long suffering sigh, staring down at the angry omega. “Hard way it is. Aren’t you ever going to learn, Steve?”
"Just what I like to hear. Come on." He slid his fingers through Steve's, gently tugging him along to the bedroom. Tony took his time, stripping off his clothes, examining every inch of smooth skin revealed to him. Once Steve was naked, Tony guided him over to the foot of the bed, bending him over it, leaving him exposed to the room. "Yeah, just like that. Such a good boy."
"It's okay. I'm home now." Tony gently rubbed over his back until he relaxed against his body. "I think I know something that might make you feel better."
Instinct sent him staggering back to the bed, collapsing at Tony’s side. Steve gripped the alpha’s shoulder, shaking him gently to wake him. He wasn’t sure what was going on, why he felt so sick. But Tony had told Steve to come to him whenever he needed him, and after the last few days he desperately wanted to trust the other man. Tony came awake immediately, sitting up and turning towards Steve, concern etched on his face. “Steve? Sweetheart? Is everything alright?”
"You did. But that's things I would have been happy to give you any day. Isn't there anything you want that might be special? Maybe a little selfish?"
To be fair, Tony had called from Hong Kong every night he had been gone. Less fair was the fact that he had left Steve locked up in the cage the entire time he had been gone. And teased him every night. Because of course he had. Steve practically dove across his bed to grab his phone the second it rang. "Tony?"
Steve cupped his jaw, turned Bucky’s head to face him, then guided their mouths together. Bucky melted at the way their lips slid against each other. So soft, with an undercurrent of longing. He’d never wanted this world’s Steve Rogers like that. But if he’d been more open, like the man currently beneath him, that would have been different. He wondered how long Steve had wanted this. If that version of him had rejected this sweet man, broken his heart. A surge of possessiveness rose in him, locking his arms around Steve’s waist. There was no way Bucky would let him go after having him like this.
Tony laughed again. “Alright, so you’ve taken your punishment. What would you like for your reward?”
A hot mouth slid down Steve’s neck, over the sensitive bond bite, jolting him back to reality. Tony’s hands slid around his ribs to cup his pecs, kneading them roughly, digging into the hard tissue. It was incredibly painful, but at the same time he could feel sparks of pleasure running down his spine. Without realizing it, his hips were rocking against Tony’s lap, grinding down against the plug. “Tony… Tony, please…”
"Good, so good baby. So close. Come on, swallow me down Steve. Just like that." He let out a ragged moan, head falling back, as Steve desperately swallowed around him until he was drawn away. "Such a good boy."
Since my story was rudely interrupted by real plot last time, have a wonderfully kinky chapter this time! I hope you enjoy the latest installment. Comments and suggestions are always appreciated, and if I've made any errors, please let me know. Now, onto the sexy boys!
Steve groaned, rolling over onto his knees, back stretched long by the grip he still had on the headboard. He couldn’t stop the short stuttering movements of his hips until he felt calloused hands gripping hard to still them. A soft gust of air was his only warning before Tony’s mouth was pressed against his sensitive hole, lips and tongue devouring him, the rasp of his beard against the sensitive skin making him squirm harder. It felt better than he had ever imagined it would, which added to his current predicament.
“Alright honey. You did earn it, after all. Looks like you’re still up, Steve.” Tony stood in front of him this time, wanting to see the agonized expression on his face. Slid a hand between his legs, fingers sliding easily into Steve’s slick entrance. Steve moaned when Tony began rubbing over his glands, letting the feeling roll through him and quickly building to another release. Again, as soon as Steve began to clench around him, Tony slid his fingers free, leaving him to struggle against the restraints as the pleasure was yanked from his grasp.
Tony’s knot grew wider, pressing against the inside of his hole, making the area prickle with discomfort, similar to the pins and needles feeling of a limb going to sleep. Strong arms wrapped tight around him as he cried, until his head felt stuffy and his eyes ached. Tony slipped gently from his body, pressing against Steve’s shoulders, urging him to remain where he was on the bed. A moment later the plug from earlier pressed against him and slipped inside, pulling another painful spasm from his body.
Steve turned back to the box, carefully opening it and studying the contents before placing several items on the bed. His selections for the night made, he set the box on the floor and climbed onto the mattress. He’d done this often enough that he knew exactly how it should go, where to start. Step one was lube. Just enough to be a little slick, to start stretching his hole around a couple of fingers. Not much. He wanted the stretch from the vibrator to be a lot. Once that was done, it was time to attach the vibrator to the headboard, slicking the surface with more lube once it was secure.
Stark’s voice sounded closer. When Steve pried his eyes open, the other man was kneeling on the ground in front of him, his gaze filled with concern. He shook his head, trying to clear it. This was wrong. He should be the one on his knees, not Stark. Never Stark. He couldn’t speak, a choked off whine the only sound that could escape his tight throat.
Steve nodded in relief, allowing himself to be dragged over to a high bench and unceremoniously shoved down over it. A sharp slap landed against his thigh, cautioning him to stay still, before callused fingers began rubbing against his entrance. He could feel himself immediately begin to get wet. It was a new sensation and still made him feel uncomfortable.
"It- It was the cold. The ice. All I could think of was the Valkyrie. When the water broke through the glass. All I could feel was the cold..."
He reached their floor, staggering to the couch, collapsing on its surface. Immediately the vibrations stopped. Steve rolled onto his stomach, buried his face into a pillow and screamed his frustration. It was going to be a long seven hours.
When Steve finally relaxed beneath him, Tony slid out slowly, ignoring the accompanying sounds of protest. “Stay right there, sweetheart. Clench up tight. You lose even a drop of what I gave you, you’re getting punished.” He watched the stretched out ring twitch, desperately trying to clench. It only took Tony a moment to retreat to his old playroom, retrieve what he needed, and return. The plug he’d chosen was metal. Solid, heavy, and much larger than the one he’d used on Steve before. He took his time running the surface over Steve’s skin, coating it in slick. The slim tip was pressed to Steve’s entrance, tracing soft circles around the madly fluttering hole before Tony began to slowly ease it inside.
I’m having a lot of fun playing with A/B/O verse, and a mean and possessive Tony. I hope everyone enjoys this installment. On with the show!
The door opened behind them, allowing Bruce to enter. He set a large bag on the counter then stepped forward to grip Tony’s hand. “Hello, Tony. I’m glad you finally decided to settle down.”
"Oh God..." Steve buried his face in his hands, feeling his skin burn at the realization that Bruce apparently knew exactly what he and Tony were doing, and probably had for a while.
Tony moved back to where James was waiting, taking him by the hand and leading him to a comfortable chair near where Steve was restrained. Once he was seated, Tony grinned. He did love putting on a show. “Well, James? Are you ready to see what you’ve won?”
Loki sighed, sipping at his tea to organize his thoughts. "On Midgard, this sort of thing is an entire subculture, with rules and precautions. Not accepted by mainstream society, but not entirely taboo either. On Asgard, to lie with another man or participate in this sort of play is opening yourself up to disgrace and further mistreatment. I am still accustoming myself to the kindness I am shown by Bruce."
He could feel his cheeks heating up again. It was a ridiculous, over the top gesture. But at the same time, some dark secret corner of his heart was pleased by the attention.
“I think it’s late, and it’s been a miserable fucking day. How would you feel about a long hot bath? JARVIS could order us something to eat after, and then we could go to bed and start over in the morning.”
Tony pressed deeper, finding his prostate and grinding into it painfully. Whimpers fell from Steve’s throat, but there was nowhere he could go to escape the touch. He shifted back and forth, pressing his caged cock and throbbing nipples into the mattress before jerking back into Tony’s fingers. He played him like an instrument, working him into a frenzy before abruptly pulling out of him.
“I’m not going anywhere, honey. You don’t want me to leave, so I’m going to stay. That’s what you want, isn’t it?”
“How nice is that, honey? You come on command. Tell me, does it work the other way? Can I stop you with a word?” Steve couldn’t breathe, couldn’t speak, just nodded, showing his alpha what kind of power he had over him. “Oh honey… You really shouldn’t have told me that.”
James turned dark bedroom eyes up to his. “That’s right, Stevie. What’s the matter, can’t handle what we’re dishin’ out?”
Steve shifted on the bed, curling up tightly against Tony’s side, face buried against his chest. “I love you, Tony. So much. You”re the first person I think of every morning. The one I want to see the most when I’ve been gone. I’d do anything for you.”
Once the cage was in place, Tony began tightening it, forcing Steve’s cocklet to compress to the smallest size possible. He ignored the growls and complaints as he manipulated the soft flesh, locking the mechanism in place. “There we go, sweetheart. All nice and pretty for me.” Tony lifted the cage in his palm, squeezing the delicate package gently. The nanobytes activated from his touch, holding Steve secure and adjusting to ensure a continuous tight fit as the area shrank over time. The metal was thick enough that all Steve would be able to feel was the numbness of the lubricant, until it wore off in a few hours. After that, only the strongest vibrations would be able to penetrate the cage.
Biting back a moan, Steve dug through the box, finding the lube and slicking his fingers. He rolled to his knees, reaching back and rubbing his fingers over himself hesitantly. It was different when Tony was the one doing it.
"You know what to say if you need me to stop. Otherwise, I am going to have you. It's been nearly two weeks since I've been inside of you. I fucking need to feel you, Steve."
Steve didn’t know what he had done wrong, but it was breaking his heart. It had been two weeks since Tony had appeared on his floor long enough to push a semi-recovered and still very much alive Bucky at him and disappeared. The first several days of that time were spent comforting his oldest friend and helping him acclimate to the new world around them. It was after that Steve realized something was wrong.
He tilted his head to the side, as though he was considering it. "No. You haven't even been locked up for a day yet, sweetheart. You can't need it that badly so soon. I took care of you so good last night, didn't I?"
Steve crawled across the bed, silk sliding under his knees. Tony was back a moment later. He could feel restraints close around first his wrists and then his ankles, holding them together and forcing his back to arch, putting his body on display.
"Alright..." He heard the other man stand up and move away, followed by faint sounds from the kitchen. It seemed like no time had passed before he was back, fingers gentle on his face, urging him to take bits of food from his fingers. Steve slowly ate what he was given, tongue darting out to lap at Tony's fingers, reveling in the care and attention being lavished on him.
Steve sighed, tucked up his knees and curled in closer to Tony. “Not as much as it used to. But failing Bucky…”
Steve was slowly pressed back again, forced to take the full length of the dildo inside of him. Tony watched him struggle with the depth of the penetration, then whimper as it worked the lubricant deeper inside of him. Tony fastened his thighs to the sides of the machine, holding him firmly in place, preventing him from rising. His arms were folded behind his back and bound together then attached to the framework surrounding the machine. A fur lined posture collar was secured around Steve’s neck, covering his daily one, forcing his chin high and preventing him from looking down. That too was secured to the framework, rendering him completely immobile.
Tony let his helmet fold into the armor and looked at the other Avengers around him. T'Challa was on his way to the Tower, but Tony and the rest of them were annoyed and angry, because they had found one big fat NOTHING.
Tony drummed his fingers on the soda can. Shit. Well, she was right. Tony couldn't violate the privacy of all the other Avengers just for the niggling feeling of suspicion. Well, he could, but--- Alright. He was being a bit hasty. They did deserve their privacy. Not that he would want to talk it through with the Black Widow. She would probably break some of his bones if she found out about the cameras. Clint really deserved a quiet time. Rhodey too. And Vision.
"No." He interrupted Pepper before she could continue. "We’re not having this conversation. Ever." The only place to go and get as far away from her as possible was Steve's part of the suite. The bastard was looking out of the window and appeared to be enjoying the beautiful view from up above.
Before Steve had a chance to think about what he was supposed to say next, all eyes were fixed on him. He clearly had been talking for some long minutes about Tony's Tower, his inventions and his work. Finally, the silence around him permeated Steve's senses, and his monologue stopped. He was acutely aware people were no longer eating, they just kept staring at him, making him uncomfortable and embarrassed.
Tony wanted to cover him, but there were no curtains, blankets or anything else to be used. He himself was still in his armor, and one look around let him know that the other Avengers were all clothed in spandex or other clingy materials. If Thor were present, he could have lent his cape, but he was still fighting his own war in Asgard. T’Challa wore his suit, but Tony felt bad asking the king of Wakanda to lend him a suit jacket. That was just wrong on so many levels, no matter how good friends they were. Thankfully, Tony’s eyes landed on a certain genius scientist.
Finally, Steve could say something productive. He highlighted the luck they had because Tony had converted one of the rooms into a gym. There was a theater room where they used to sit down and watch movies on Friday nights, and they had a big space where they could just talk and relax. They hadn't used it for a while, but Steve was still in awe of all the things Tony arranged for them. Not to mention every member of the Avengers had their own bedroom. Steve talked about Tony’s generousness, Tony’s AIs and Tony making improvements for their armors.
"If you say so, Boss. But I have footage of its existence with JARVIS, and as a matter of fact, it didn't look very funny."
Tony put his palms flat on the workbench, ignoring the blueprints all over the desk, and with a heavy sigh closed his eyes, allowing his head to hang.
I would like to thank DreadPirateWombat for beta reading the chapter and making it absolutely awesome.
"Already? Time flies when you're having fun. Ok. Let him through," Tony said distractedly. He put down his tools and crossed his arms over his chest in an unwitting move.
"Yes." Steve slowly trailed his fingers over the skin one last time, then averted his eyes and took a step back. This night was not running as smoothly as Steve would have liked.
"FRIDAY---" Steve started barely audible, then cleared his throat and began to speak again. "FRIDAY said you won't be eating dinner with us."
Tony would never say crude words like these in the company of others, but in the privacy of their bedroom, formerly only Tony's bedroom, he could say them and have some fun. Not much, but a little teasing was allowed between couples.
As Tony's shaking hands sneaked around Steve's back and Tony's body inched closer, he knew very well there was nothing
He could still hear the ringing of metal against metal of Steve's final blow, and then Captain America was leaning onto the shield protruding from his chest, breathing heavily. Tony flinched.
Steve nodded again with a small smile and, like a good soldier, continued to eat his dinner, eyes firmly fixed on the table. What if these weeks would be the last time he would spend moments with Tony alone? The idea was killing him.
There was no conversation about this emasculating situation because the super soldier was asleep with his head on Tony's shoulder within a second. Tony internally winced. The immediate future didn't look very promising. He could picture all the curious glances from the Avengers waiting outside.
"You're afraid you will break me with your super dick, or something?" Tony smirked, and the tension between them was gone.
"I'm leaving now," Tony informed FRIDAY, needlessly. The words were more to reaffirm his decision to separate himself entirely from the former Avengers.
Tony narrowed his eyes in suspicion. "What is ready?" This was not Steve's normal behavior. "What are you up to?"
Somewhere to be? A theater maybe? Tony had never paid much attention to the dating scene in the 40s. Who knew what the geriatric was hiding up his sleeve now. Hold on. They’d had live bands and clubs. So, maybe dancing was on the agenda for tonight?
"I'm not going anywhere, soldier." Tony smiled affectionately and was surprised when Steve took Tony's face in his palms and kissed him in front of everyone. Not some passionate making out which might offend the delicate sensibilities of the high and mighty individuals in the room, but a soft kiss on the lips that couldn't be interpreted as anything else than a loving gesture. And by Tony's cooperation it was obvious to everyone that this wasn't a first.
That piece of royal ass had the audacity to smile at Tony all knowingly. Eventually, Tony jumped to his feet and helped his friend up from the concrete as well. "Thanks."
The glass with alcohol was put in front of him, and Tony automatically reached for it. The moment his fingers closed around the glass, a distinctly colored hand landed on his.
"Nonsense. Steve is right." Tony studied the dining room with new interest. "Everyone always wants to talk about the world's safety, but we're disregarding the smaller things."
"He took away your Bucky! I understand how it feels when someone takes away the person you love, you know. He's jealous. He’s never had anyone. He doesn't know what it feels like to love someone more than himself. He loves only his money!" the kid sneered in Tony's direction.
"Ok." Tony sighed deeply and relaxed in his chair. Hands on the armrests, he wheeled the chair around and faced Steve with a grin on his face and legs spread carelessly. "How’s it going, Captain Picasso?"
"You're just a coward," the billionaire snarled angrily. "You think just because you’re fucking Captain Perfect, you’re entitled to know everything better than everyone else, but you're too scared to see that someone else might be right as well."
What kind of answer was that? Tony was about to put the rose onto the dresser, but Steve gently steered him in the direction of the bedroom door.
"Don’t know, don’t care. There has to be something they missed," Tony replied distractedly. He flew several rounds over the area with zero results. "FRIDAY, give me visual from the invasion. We need to know where they came from. Did S.H.I.E.L.D. find something useful on their bodies?"
"Let’s be clear on something. I need you to be healed and alright. We have to talk," Tony hoped he empathized the word
Tony took flight in his Iron Man suit, and minutes later, he descended on the ramp at the Tower, walking towards the entrance and shedding the armor one step at the time. He went to the bathroom to take a shower, trying to rein himself in. Bruce had said Steve was well enough. After all, he was a human enhanced with a super serum that was finally starting to work again.
Tony never minded the gaze of a woman. But with Natasha—felt like she was looking right through him, it felt lethal and he was more scared of her than blue eyes.
He shouldn’t trust him. Really, he shouldn’t trust anything from this man, but he does and relaxes and stroked them. Steve bite Tony shoulder, moaning as Tony continued the strokes. Tony mouth opened, a pant, as Steve circled and moved a finger into him. Tony grasped Steve chin and crushed their lips together.
Good thing, since the topic of the conversation came into the kitchen. And so, did the tension. And Bucky looked as he was enjoying it. “Your door is fixed,” he Bucky announced.
“We do.” He agreed. “But, not today,” he swallowed. “I feel like—like once inside, we’ll definitely talk. But… but I have a feeling that something else might happen,” Steve arch his brow. “And I’m not ready,” he finished.
And Tony discovered that he enjoyed being carried away like this. He won’t admit that out loud though.
“Right now,” Sam answered. “Their parents bring them here. It’s safe and they get to shift, run around with the right supervision.” He smiled as he watches Bucky zig zag through, the little pups trying their best to catch him.
Steve stood with his hands grasping his belt, a scowl across his face. Steve didn’t get the kid. The clear blatant defiance towards him—the frigid attitude towards him. He figured it was puberty—but puberty was different with them—he didn’t grow out of it, after tonight it looks like it had gotten worst.
“Well, Loki is known for his mischief here and there. So, I am glad this time it was not him. But we have an outsider,” James opened his mouth, Natasha held her hand up—stopping him, to let Thor finish. “He is visiting, taking care of business at the old
He gripped the steering wheel, then he let go; he didn’t want to break it again. Thor just fixed it. He took a deep breath and let it out. Taking the flowers, he got out the car and made his way to the house. Finding Clint and Rhodey waiting for him. He noticed the wooden bench, that was not there before. It looked like one of Wade’s work.
His Aunt Peggy always told him that Rhodey was his best friend, the type that would be there for all the ups and down. He agreed, as he held her arm in his, while they walked the courtyard of the hospital. She was relaxed, when she said it again that day, he felt her relief. She probably was worried that he would be alone.
Was he suffering from the aftereffects of the alcohol? Is he in a freaking coma and dreaming all this up? Looking at Steve frown, could he read his mind—shit, he needs to know the stats of all shapeshifters soon. The can and can’t dos.
Here Tony was, in Steve’s home. Wondering how they got this far. Dating. He hasn’t been on a date for some time. Work kept him preoccupied, and he just hasn’t clicked with anyone either. Pepper said he was becoming picky at one point. She and Rhodey gave up in playing matchmaker.
“You are right. I am the boss,” he barks out a laugh, Pepper chuckling at the other end. “Alright boss let me have it.”
“And if I were?” Steve countered. He straightens up, his mouth set in a grim line. Tony pursed his lips, thinking. “What are you?”
Their hands full. Moving to toss the items on the counter. “Tones—this whole town,” Rhodes expands his hands.
Wade came from the back and the gloom was back. Jared must have been at the back as he came right at the heel of his brother. “Twins?” Tony turned to Loki.
“That’s right Rhodey,” Tony slapped his back and turned to Clint. “And I’ll make sure Laura knows how brave you were and name one of our kid after you.”
“You are right. It has taken centuries,” Thor smiled proudly. His friends stutter in their walk, not sure how to follow up on that.
“Ah, my son Loki does nothing but make fun of an old man…” Odin whined, but they could see the humor in his eye.
“Dr. Bruce Banner,” Tony let out an excited bark of a laugh. “I’ve read all your work!” Steve could see the gleam of Tony eyes. He was not liking this one bit.
Sam saw Tony flash of confusion at that. “He was never born one of us. He was mortal, like you and your friends.”
“The flowers. Red Calla lily means beauty, passion. Daffodils means rebirth, new beginnings and Lavender, love and devotion.”
He wasn’t sure how this happened. But not the reaction he wanted. Steve was quick. He took hold of his head with both hands and crush their lips together.
Her green eyes sparked, a slow smile of amusement, as she saw Wade naked and holding his hands to cover his groin. “Did I miss the fun,” she snickered.
Steve's hand moves to Tony waist, pulling him closer—Tony arches into him. Until he heard a car passing them by. Panic.
“Ah,” Steve nodded his understanding. “Well, I was fifteen when I first shifted.” Tony and Jazmin had an identical look, mouth gaped open to the admission.
“It was just a joke…” Jared spoke up. “We—no one was going to get hurt. I didn’t think Wade would shift, though” he rubbed his hands together, and elbowed his brother.
His hand skimmed down Steve chest, down his well-defined abdomen and Tony felt Steve cock tap him from behind. He looked at Steve shy face. He was embarrassed at the reaction. Tony huffed a laugh, leaned down to kiss Steve.
“Odin, nice to see you” Tony gave a tight smile, he saw movement from behind the old man, it was Steve and he looked more wound up. But his eyes were on Rhodey. Rhodey just stared back. He cleared his throat, “Should I expect more visitor?”
Tony felt odd watching the affections. It brought memories of his family. And though they were happy thoughts they were also painful, because they were not here.
It took him longer to figure out where he was going. People he passed by for directions had no clue and his stupid GPS kept telling him to make U-turns. He vowed that he’ll take the GPS apart and make it better.
"Well… yea" he flapped his arms at his side. "I like him." Hearing it from his mouth. That part of him was thrilled with the confession. Which he remembered, that part of him, he has yet to analyze.
“You guys had Asgardian mead?” Steve was amazed. Tony's eyes squinted, “I didn’t buy it.” They looked to Rhodey, who thankfully found some aspirins. “What? Is it not regular beer?” he gulped down the pills with water and gave the bottle to Tony.
“Thor!” he turned to a sultry red-head, who accompany her was a brunette man, whose hair was tied up, the brunette waved. Both were in there uniform, deputies. Well—a title to make this town close to normal.
Steve was busy last night stewing. Pouting, Natasha stated with amusement. She came over to see what he was up to. Since he did not show up at the office and Natasha was his second. She complained how unfair it was that he had thrown all the work on her.
Steve turned, “I never been this nervous.” Throw him into battle, toss him a mission and he would face it, not a twitch to his nerves. And here he was, looking at his best friend and not sure what to do at this point.
Jazmin must have caught a trail of his thought, as she poked Steve bicep. Steve gave out a throaty laugh. “Honest, not even kidding, Bucky will tell you.”
“I guess it went well…” Bucky stated. Tony was not sure, but Bucky didn’t exactly sound happy. Maybe he just didn’t want to bump into another, barely dressed, man. And wasn’t he a wolf, Sam said they had a good sense of smell. So, Bucky might not appreciate the waft of sex.
“Yea, I also got sick. I held out better, being half, my dad decided he couldn’t wait. He lost too much.” He flipped Tony hand over, both hands held him, Steve’s thumbs smoothing over his palm, down his wrist. Steve could feel Tony’s pulse quicken.
Steve looked into the mirror, carding his fingers into his hair. Natasha cut his hair and helped trim his beard. Saying that he couldn’t look like a shaggy dog, both wolves let out a displease noise, she shushed them. He tried to argue that Tony already knew how he looked.
“Also, Tony is our precious friend. You may be different and could probably easily handle us. But hurt Tony and nothing will stop all my military training to kick your ass.” Rhodey finished.
He felt solid hands on his shoulders. He met Bucky steady eyes. “Relax. Tony already met you at your worst.” He teased. “Not helpful Buck.”
“The old place? I’m going to guess Odin has something to do with this?” they’ve turned their attention to the gruff voice.
She blew a raspberry at him. “Steven Grant Rogers.” He cringed. “This is a date. And Tony, your mate, deserves the whole nine yards.” Bucky gave a nod, agreeing. “You’re courting my pup,” she said as she tapped his nose. “Funny, I could have sworn I was older than you.” Steve countered. She huffed a laugh. “Yes true, but you’re acting like a pup.” With that she gathered her stuff, gave Steve one last look, “Now, have a wonderful date. Do not screw it up or I’ll shave you bald.” She threatened and left her two idiots to themselves.
He swears he’s hearing water. The closer he got, it’s roaring. Tony stopped as he made it to the edge. The edge of Asgard?
Tony wasn’t even trying, but yes, he was teasing, and he was glad she responded to him. “I was hoping you’ll call me Hades instead.” Yes, if anyone missed it, Tony was a huge nerd.
walking freely among them. At least for some of them. Others, Tony found out, lived long enough to have people like them come through for a few days.
It was the first time he ever saw his father cry as his mother passed away. “It was better that way. She would have suffered and die, badly. It wasn’t a risk that anyone wanted to take.” Even though, she suffered in the end.
“You should meet our bear,” Steve smiled. “Come on, more to see around here.” He tilts his head and moves. Tony took one last look and followed Steve.
would have just grown up. Guess we know where Wade gets most of his behavior from," he gave Thor a pointed look.
Steve looked down at him, his blue eyes holding some hope. Tony’s aware that Steve held his hand, still. His thumb stroking it. There went his inside again. He felt the flutter of butterfly wings, as his mother would put it. And those pesky aftershocks down his spine.
“What?” Tony and Rhodey said in unison, an incredulous look. “What the hell Barton? What makes you think you will get out of here alive,” Rhodey said through clench teeth.
Wade was about to move in, when Loki moved between them. “Tony, how about we go to the market close by. You probably need to stock up for the time you are here” Tony nodded as he exited the shop. Before Loki stepped out, he turned to the men.
“What are they doing?” Tony finally asked. “Looks like they’re posturing” Loki cleared his throat. “Wade” his voice stern. Wade reluctantly turned his attention to Loki. “Go to the back and stock that shelf, love” he ordered.
“That’s the problem. I can’t,” Steve almost laughed at the identical faces look of shock. But humor was long gone for him tonight.
Clint swallowed his food, “Also, you should be less—” he paused searching for the right word “I can’t find the word. But you and that Steve guy are off. It’s just… the tension," he looked to Rhodes at that.
He heard children laughter, as they got a better look of the tree. Children were around the tree. Some trying to climb it, others running around, and many touching it with awe clear on their face.
First, I was thinking about this for months. I wanted to create a fantasy world, it’s pretty much a mixture of things I have read throughout the years. I also like the A/B/O world as well. I’m using the dynamics, it fits what I want to do with this story, but this is not the omegaverse, just borrowing. Don’t expect the characters to be in character, it’s going to get ooc, I’m going where the story taking me.
“Oh, see!” he took the frame and faced Steve, as the man quirked an eyebrow, “This here is not fair.” Tony pointed to the picture. “You’re too good looking.” He whined.
He turned back into the tall grass. A few minutes later, a man walked out tugging his shirt over his head and placing his glasses on.
Clint took a hold of Tony shirt, “Before that, I found this. It’s address to you” he pulled an envelope out of his back pocket. The handwriting,
Steve glares at him. Steve growls at him and not the normal growling. The guttural kind that an animal would make. And that didn’t make him nervous. No, it’s when he touches him, and he can’t breathe. His body waiting for Steve to do…
“Oh god.” His friends were the worst. “Now, now,” Rhodey tossed an arm over Tony shoulders. “I guess I should give you the talk.” Tony looked horrified, “Rhodey please.”
Rhodey raised his hand, “All right, as strange as tonight has been… what’s your plan for us? Because I for one would like to get my head check.”
Tony gave him the most endearing smile. “Thanks. I love them.” He bit his lips and Steve found that he would love to bite those enticing lips.
Could Steve feel that Tony was upset? God, could they all feel his moods. He looked at the others; they didn’t seem to feel anything, except he thought Bucky was frowning at him. But he was focus on Thor and helping Clint in drinking his water. He glanced at Steve and held his breath. Yup, Steve could feel his moods. He didn’t know how but he just knew, looking at those worried blues of Steve was telling him everything.
Steve coughed, “Uh—heard that your first public visit in Asgard was not comfortable.” Clearly Loki told Steve this. Tony nerves settled. Like before, Tony was used to public attention, but not the type that Asgard showed them. It’s not their fault, he knew. They just wasn’t used to
” he could see Tony’s mind consume the information. “Let’s leave that for another time.” Tony mouth snapped shut. Steve coughed, to disguise his laugh.
Tony was still in his boxer and T-shirt, and terrible bed hair. But he upturned his nose at him and went back to his friends and eggs. It was childish, snobby, but he made him that way. He heard Bucky laugh.
Rebecca turned away and smiled at the others. “Bye! See you around Tony!” she wave as she took the direction where the foxes went.
On cue, Natasha handed him a glass. Tony took a gulp, while turning over. Rhodey huffed, not practically happy in how he was being woken. They both stared at each other and started to laugh, but instantly stopped as they groan in pain.
He stood in the middle of a house he come to known since he was a boy. Aunt Peggy always happy to see him. Spoiled him rotten. He loved staying with her on the days she was home for extended periods.
Steve pushed Tony toward the couch. Tony willingly went down. Their lips separated. As Steve stared down at Tony.
The high beams weren’t helping. And he felt a strong foreboding, something telling him to turn around and forget Nowhere Ville. Well, the town name was called
Rhodey eyebrows shot up, his lips pressed together, holding a choke laugh. "Hold on," he raised his hand, "No, no. Now see we need to talk. What is going on, Tones?"
But now his focus was on his friend. He was nervous towards Rhodey reactions. He cleared his throat, "We never talked about it before," Rhodey blinked as he focuses on Tony. "About?"
Tony moved quickly and motion to help Odin up the steps. Which Odin gladly took the offer. Tony imagine this place would look a bit beat up, but it seems it was well taken care of.
She had brown curls in a ponytail, and her cheeks were chubby. She was so enthusiastic earlier now she looked put-out.
“Tony,” he chirped. Then looked up as the door slammed shut, Tony visibly wince—Wade smiled turned upside down. Tension, the theme in this town. Though he was relieved to see Loki coming from the back, brow raised at the two having a staring contest.
Tony stared at the image of Steve's face until the anger slowly slipped away. Due to the detail of Steve's concern, he couldn't get yesterday's conversation out of his head. Well, not the conversation per se. That one moment when Tony had been absolutely sure Steve Rogers had looked at his lips and thought about kissing him.
"Don’t do this," Tony warned her with a collected, soft tone of his voice. "Not with T’Challa. He lost his father. He’s got a nation to lead. He doesn’t have time for this bullshit."
to do. He couldn't stand the idea of someone genuinely complimenting him, so he changed the subject.
Then, a warm palm slowly slid over Tony's lower back. Steve obviously wanted him closer. Tony heard Steve holding his breath as if he expected Tony to push him away.
"Your pulse is slightly elevated, indicating significant discomfort." Of course, even if he could outsmart all of humankind, he couldn’t fool an A.I. he’d created who constantly monitored his vital signs.
"Colonel Rhodes is waiting in your workshop, boss,” FRIDAY said, pulling Tony from his dark thoughts.
Tony's stomach clenched nervously, because all these things looked suspiciously like a date. Their first official date. One look at his clothes in the reflection in the stainless steel door of the elevator told him that he wasn't even remotely dressed for the occasion. Gray sweatpants and a black tank top weren't date material. Steve wore a nice pair of black slacks and white shirt with three buttons casually undone.
"Good to know," Tony murmured, "but just for your information, that demanding partner will be having your hide later tonight anyway." Tony just couldn't help himself. He lived for the moments in which Steve Rogers was speechless and blushed furiously.
"He's fixing our mess as usual, throwing money in every direction, kissing Ross' ass, not sleeping much, traveling around the world, keeping Vision from moping about Wanda and working insane hours. Nothing new."
"Captain Rogers is now back on the premises," his insolent creation informed him and then fell silent.
Tony was just hoping the ground would finally open up and swallow him. He still didn't have the courage to look at Steve. Of course he would be the one to ruin their night. No one had ever made so much effort for him. And what would Steve be getting in exchange? Sweatpants. A stained tank top. Motor oil under Tony's fingernails. Probably some dirty smears on his face as well. Hair sticking in all directions from Tony's frustrated fingers running through it all day. He really was one
"I don't know what happened in Siberia, but---" Natasha's smile was gone. "---I’ve never seen him so skittish around people."
"Hm," Tony made an unspecified noise. He sat down in front of his computers, fingers on the keyboard as he was idly searching the angles of security cameras in the Tower. At the same time, he watched another black screen from the corner of his eye where he could track Rhodey's progress on the reflecting surface. It wasn't easy for his friend to switch places.
The first person Steve's eyes had sought out was Tony. The billionaire looked at him in astonishment, then smiled fondly at him. Steve would have wept for joy if it weren't for their present company. For so long he had yearned to see that smile, he couldn't believe his eyes.
AS always, Rebecca did the edits. Buckets of roses and all the chocolates needs to be send her way. :)
Tony silently thanked God for the opportunity to have another chance with Steve. Sometimes, he still woke up sweating, scared out of his mind to find Steve's body maimed and the man he loved dead.
Steve noticed the way his body kept a hairsbreadth of distance from Tony's chest. He held himself securely on his forearms, although their legs and crotches were pressed together thanks to Tony, who seemed to emulate an octopus with only four limbs. The brunet had a smug glint in his eyes before he grew serious again.
"Captain Rogers expected your question and instructed me, if the circumstances were to arrive, to explain that he is out and will be back as soon as possible."
Steve didn’t appear to be affected in any way. He had answered Pepper’s questions, nodded in the right places, but hadn’t initiated any conversation. He acted like this trip was a daily occurrence, and Tony couldn’t tell that this was the same guy who had sat on that park bench. He couldn't see any resemblance. Tony did, because he knew it had happened. Steve Rogers was suddenly too good at displaying a poker face.
He wanted to press Steve into the wall, feel every inch of his super hot body and kiss him desperately. Finally find out how Steve tasted. Tony just
Tony finally exhaled. He clutched Steve's wrist when the super soldier caressed his face. "Fine." He sighed shakily. Steve helped him to his feet and
"Someone has to stand up for you!" the young boy shouted in his face with a mad glint in his eyes. "Stark!"
"King T’Challa," she added with a frown on her beautiful forehead. Pepper shouldn’t worry about him that much.
"Insisted?!" Tony repeated in disbelief. Yeah, he was losing his shit due to the super soldier again. It felt like his life was a series of mini heart attacks thanks to Captain Perfect. "If a five-year-old insists he wants a knife out of curiosity, would you hand it to him with a smile?" Tony glared at the doctor angrily. "Of course not. You're gonna think for yourself. You're gonna use your brain. Well, in this case, I'm not so sure," Tony insulted him cruelly without much thought. "Not all the time, apparently. Your patient is missing and you don’t give a fuck?"
Tony focused back on the wheelchair in his line of sight. He brought his tools closer and got to work. However, it didn't matter how many hours Tony spent in the workshop, half of his focus kept straying towards the big screen and Steve's face which was still there for him to glance at.
But now, at the reception, Tony's eyes strayed to Steve who was currently conversing with Clint. For fuck's sake, Steve Rogers was
Tony considered the importance of Butterfingers in a grand scheme of things. However, he finally had to capitulate. There were much more pressing issues than his old robotic friend. "You know what, we have a lot to do, kiddo. Butterfingers can wait. The armor and the shield have higher priority."
Happy New Year to all of my readers. Thank you so much for your patience with updates. And a special thank you to Rebecca, who edited the chapter.
It was the middle of the night, and Steve was sitting in Tony's workshop, silently sketching the man behind the Iron Man suit who was currently working with his computers. They had been spending long hours in comfortable silence, interrupted only by the strokes of Steve’s pencil on the paper and Tony's fingers dancing over his keyboard.
Tony slept for almost fourteen hours with astonishing peacefulness of fitful sleep. The nightmares eased thanks to his exhaustion. Some might say it was due to his conversation with Steve, but he didn't want to admit the fact to himself. He wasn't that far down the road as to give the Captain Perfect that much credit. No one would make him admit that.
Tony lightly scraped the skin under his fingers and froze when Steve whimpered. That was not the reaction Tony had wanted to cause. Definitely not now. Unfortunately, he couldn’t stop his own thoughts. He just had to picture Steve in different circumstances, preferably in bed under Tony, making that same sound. Great, now he wanted to haul Steve to his feet, kiss him senseless and reassure them both that Steve was still alive.
"Yes. Theoretically. The last lab results showed significant improvement of the serum. It’s stronger than whatever poison they tried to contaminate him with," Bruce nodded thoughtfully, his eyes landing on their connected hands. He blinked twice, then switched his attention back to the topic at hand. "The bad news is, I think this is just a testing batch to test the effects on the super serum."
I would like to apologize, I have no idea why I live with the idea of Scott having a son. I really don't. My only excuse is I didn't see the movie or read a comics. Thank all of you so much for pointing this fact to me. :)
Tony watched Hawkeye survey the area from the highest building in close proximity. The streets were still infested with dead spider robots and rubble. They were both observing the cleaning group of S.H.I.E.L.D.’s agents as they made slow progress.
Steve squared his shoulders and continued, "The friend I have is doing everything in his power to assure all the Avengers have their rights like any other person in this country. The Tony I know is the man who is allowing the Avengers into his home and, without batting an eye, offering them everything he owns. And he's doing everything without wanting anything back. "
Tony was angry. That was the only way to describe his emotions. He wanted to yell at the whole world and not keep smiling at the U.N. representatives and sign the Sokovia Accords. Alright, yes. He
"Fine," Tony capitulated begrudgingly. He slid the rose into a vase which had obviously been placed on the table for exactly that purpose and sat down. "Anything else?"
"No. But then he attacked Bucky, who hadn’t been in control when he killed Tony’s parents, and the jerk was barely fighting back. I thought Tony was going to kill him, Nat, and Bucky is innocent," he pleaded, trying to make her understand the whole terrible situation. "I jumped in to protect Bucky without even thinking." Steve chewed his lip, then sighed. "We made such a mess of everything, and I don't know if we’ll ever be able to recover from that. There’ve just been too many words, too many blows, too many misunderstandings. Do you really think it’s possible for us to be how we were before?"
FRIDAY had added the last part after a moment of careful searching for words. "Ok. Care to explain your scientific analysis of Steve Rogers?" Tony turned when the bright big holographic projection materialized behind him. FRIDAY played the same video from yesterday for him, only now in high definition.
voice did nothing against his mental state. Still, one could hardly blame someone for having the voice of someone else's vocal cords.
"He’s my friend. He would die protecting you," Tony reassured him heatedly. "Trust me, if you don’t trust him."
Which led him to the most important part. Tony absolutely refused to believe that Steve Rogers would ever be happy loving him. People couldn't order their hearts to stop loving someone, but if it was somehow possible after all, the super soldier would be the first one to try.
Tony grabbed Steve's nape, pulled him down and kissed his forehead. "Everything's gonna be fine, you know."
"Don't know what you're talking about, Rhodeybear. I thought you would be happy. It will be easier for you to navigate in the labyrinth of our secret lair with that chair." Tony carefully worked on his matter-of-fact tone. "FRIDAY, show me the access code for Butterfingers. We have to do something with him."
"Alright, to the sewers we shall go," Tony decided with an unsettled stomach. He didn't jump for joy over the idea. "FRIDAY, keep me updated. Hawkeye, you’re the eyes on the streets."
"I didn't want to scare you, Tony, but this flower was more important to me than any HYDRA agent. It was meant to be for you."
Again, I would love to thank DreadPirateWombat for beta reading the chapter and making it absolutely awesome.
God, the love thing again. Steve was so unbelievably sweet sometimes, even when he was promising mayhem and murder to certain organizations. Tony had it bad. He felt his heart stutter in his chest. "I love you," he breathed dazedly. A second later, Tony's brain caught up with him, but it was too late. The words were already out.
Tony shook his head and looked at Pepper without comprehending the question. He was standing in the center of the suite, lost in his thoughts. "Beg your pardon?"
God, were those tears in Steve's eyes? Tony could hardly breathe. His own misted eyes burned. The silence between them was frightening. What did it mean?
After several long moments, Steve’s eyes fluttered open with a serene smile on his perfectly healed face. The peaceful atmosphere in the room made Tony whisper, "How are you feeling?"
enough to have a different meaning. He watched Steve’s dazed expression as his eyes shifted to his lips. Tony’s desire to bridge the small gap between them made him almost breathless.
She was equivocal with Steve. "Tell him I'm awake and working. The rule holds. No one in." Tony gathered his tools and again found himself with his thoughts going back to the super soldier. He was sure, though, that the work would cure him of that. Not everything in his life was about Captain I-want-to-be-your-friend-but-Bucky-means-more-to-me, then why the hell couldn't he stop thinking about him?
"Mr. Stark?" Vision floated into his line of sight with his eyes intensely focused on Tony's face. The tilt of his head suggested he was trying to figure him out, and his tone was concerned. Tony had heard the question
"Good," Steve repeated with a nod and a slight uncomfortable blush. "That's good. I'll... leave you to your work."
"He has a fever which means his body is finally fighting the poison. It's a defense mechanism as if he'd contracted the flu. His body is basically burning the poison. He's fine," Bruce nodded with a reassuring expression.
I would like to thank DreadPirateWombat for beta reading the chapter and making it absolutely awesome.
"Are you ok?" Tony leaned forward to get a better look into Steve's face. He looked exhausted and very much
And Tony finally understood. It was a test. She wanted to see his reactions and figure out what had happened when Tony had spent his time in Wakanda. Pepper Potts was trying to play the matchmaker.
Tony silently cursed himself. He had been too distracted by those sinful fingers to remember about the faint scarring on his chest. The auto-transplantation had taken care of the hole. The big chunk of skin graft from his thigh had helped, but the scars were still visible. Definitely for someone with enhanced sight.
Steve didn't have to be a genius to know all of that behavior was carefully crafted for the public. In seconds of silence, filled only with the clinking of the dishes, Steve saw Tony's eyes. They were lost. It wasn’t visible for more than a fraction of a second, but Steve knew what he was seeing in his friend's eyes. Tony was working through the question Steve had asked him earlier. Steve was scared out of his mind what the answer would be.
Steve fought to maintain his sanity every time he felt Tony's mouth on his. The heat of Tony's body just wasn't enough. Steve craved Tony's skin. Every soft sigh he made had Steve yearn to hear him whimper and gasp with pleasure. And the more he kissed Tony, the more Steve ached to be closer.
"Where is he!" Tony's tone didn't invite any arguments. Logically, he understood that he had no reason to be worried, but at the same time, HYDRA had been silent for too long already, and they could be long gone with Steve or could have left him to die somewhere in the city.
Spending the day with T'Challa or Pepper had been fine, but alone in his workshop, nothing worked at all. Nothing could distract him from his thoughts of Steve.
"I know." Steve carefully put his palm on the side of Tony's throat, where he felt a wildly beating pulse. He would do anything to keep Tony's trust.
"Just went for a walk," Steve murmured without looking at her. He didn't want her to see his face. She was too good at reading him. It was only a matter of time until she asked the most pressing question.
"I remember better days," Steve answered politely, averting his eyes from Tony’s. Steve was always the polite and proper one. Tony couldn't force his gaze to shift away from him. Steve’s hair suddenly fascinated him. He wanted nothing more than to brush away the wet golden lock that had fallen onto Steve's forehead.
Tony watched as Steve seated himself as well and lifted the stainless steel cover from their food. They both laughed when they saw the appetizers - rice had been stylishly arranged into a word:
Steve was lying in the bed of their hotel room long after they had said goodnight. He could hear Tony's soft breathing even though each of them were in a different part of the suite. Tony's every movement had been highlighted for Steve's senses from the moment they went to bed as a result of the tense silence between them.
Steve closed his eyes in shame when Tony whispered to him. He would gladly give up his senses just to give Tony some privacy. The Avengers invaded his Tower. They were constantly in Tony's face. And even now, Tony couldn't have his own room and knew about Steve's enhanced hearing.
Tony blinked several times in confusion after his retreat. Well, if this wasn't awkward, he didn't know what would be. Tony reached for the paper bag. Under the unreasonable amount of napkins - because people were supposed to eat and not made a mess by Captain America's standards - were two hot dogs. Tony's stomach growled loudly. Right, dinner. He hadn't eaten all day.
anything, that could be the only explanation, Tony thought sarcastically. Right now, he just wanted to know if he was right or if he was imagining the thing between himself and Steve.
Many thanks to DreadPirateWombat and Rebecca who made a huge difference and made this story better. It wouldn't be the same without you, ladies.
The same Steve Rogers who, on another picture, sat in Central Park with his face in his hands, looking as if the world was resting on his shoulders and he was seconds away from crumbling under all that weight.
From the corner of his eye, Steve saw Natasha studying his profile, the way he kept his eyes averted, how much he didn't want her to see him like this. After a long pause, she nodded with a sigh. "Oh. You finally figured it out."
Ross was a different matter. He had eyes and at least two brain cells (jury was still out if he needed any help for these two cells to communicate with each other, but that particular evening he had done the math and wisely hadn't commented).
"I was so angry at him, for attacking Bucky, for making me have to fight him. I just wanted it to end, and I went after him with all that anger. I beat him until he fell, and then I pinned him to the floor. I rammed the shield into his reactor. The glass broke and---" His voice trailed off as he ruthlessly suppressed a sob.
Tony surveyed the full room. Sam was clad in a fancy tuxedo, Wanda in a red cocktail dress. Natasha wore a long tight black robe, but Tony was pretty sure she was hiding a weapon or two in there somewhere. The only person in their superhero fighting uniform, ignoring the dress code, was Clint Barton aka Hawkeye aka I-will-do-whatever-I-want-so-screw-you-people. Tony squinted at him in disapproval.
Steve lay on his side on the bed, fast asleep. The tension finally left Tony's body as he had proof Steve was alright. He understood very well why Steve had wanted to leave S.H.I.E.L.D.'s hospital. He hated hospitals just as much. Tony would do the same if the situation were reversed.
And if that statement didn't cause Steve heart palpitations he didn't know what else would. This was far more important than anything Tony could ever say.
"I'm a soldier, Tony. I'm used to dragging myself through the rubble of the battlefield just hanging onto the belief that there might be something worth it on the other side. I thought if I kept believing things between us could go back to where they've been, we'd get there. Giving up was never an option for me. Not in battle. Not on my fellow squad. Not on you."
"A HYDRA agent," Natasha explained calmly, but judging by the fire in her eyes, she was livid. Tony understood. "We almost got him, but he was dead before we reached him."
Steve helplessly clawed at the bathtub's edge, causing the ceramic to crumble under his touch. Tony knelt down. "He's not fine. He's hurting," Tony hissed angrily, but he saw with his own eyes that Steve's cheek bone was forming back into place. The bloody scrape still remained.
Everyone found apparently very fascinating spots to look at other than Steve while Tony was covering him.
The idea of Steve being as nervous as him made Tony feel slightly better, and he finally found his courage.
The smile slowly slipped from Tony’s face. He didn’t want to explain what he felt in the presence of Wakanda's leader. Not with Steve within hearing distance. The only answer was to deflect. "You want to know my opinion? He’s a good man. Great guy. Awesome leadership skills. What is this about, Pepper, because if I didn’t know you better I would say you
"Not a scratch," Tony assured him. He took a step forward and leaned against Steve's chest, seeking shelter in the arms of the man he loved. That had been close. Someone had tried to kill him. On the Presidential Gala no less. God. This was such a mess. Working with the Secret Service would be a
"You're an idiot," Tony breathed out in a huff. "But I love you, too. Now, kiss me properly or you're sleeping on the couch tonight."
Without further hesitation, Tony finally jumped the gun and whispered, "You were gutted when you walked out of my workshop. Tell me why." He held his breath for a few long seconds, patiently waiting for Steve to finally gave him an answer and open up. Something that could mend them closer together.
"He’s your friend. The person you trust the most and can be yourself around. I don't want him in harm's way. You don’t trust the Avengers anymore."
