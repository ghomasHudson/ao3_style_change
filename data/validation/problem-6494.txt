“Yeah. But then I saw you hiding behind a plant and realised that maybe with everything going on, you weren’t happy any longer.”
“It doesn’t look so little,” Steve says dubiously, drawing his hand back. “Why aren’t you at a hospital?”
“Nothing to be nervous about,” Steve says, opening the door. “Only a coupla more hours to go before you’re finished.”
“I was good,” Tony says, leaning back a little to meet Steve’s eyes, enjoying the crinkles that appear when Steve smiles at him. “And I’m tired. You should take care of me.”
Steve laughs, his hands firm on Tony’s skin. “You’re not that much older than me,” Steve says. “No, I’m just curious.”
“We think so,” Steve says. “They—I don’t know why, but they think I’m one of them. At least they did, after yesterday I’m not so sure, but Pierce is one of them. Rumlow as well, I think the whole Strike Team, but I can’t be sure. Bucky—” Steve breaks off and swallows, meeting Natasha’s solid gaze. “Bucky’s the Winter Soldier.”
“He says he has something to show me,” Steve says, frowning at his phone. “I think he’s testing me.”
“I enjoyed it as much as you did,” Tony says, snuggling back against Steve’s chest. “But you’re welcome.”
“That does not give me faith in your grilling skills,” Tony says. “I don’t know why I’m letting you cook.”
“Maybe back then I knew them, but if they’ve worked their way into SHIELD, they’re more powerful than they were,” Steve says. “I don’t even know why they think I’m Hydra.”
“Yeah,” Tony says, looking up at Steve before running a hand over the healed skin. “Are you hungry? The others ordered take out.”
Putting the photo back, Tony sighs, rubbing a hand over his face. He’d wanted to apologise to Steve, to make sure Steve knew it wasn’t his fault, that it had all been Tony, but he’d been too scared. After rehab, he was still so fragile that if Steve had rejected him, Tony might’ve dealt with that by going nose first into a pile of coke. So he never contacted him, as much as he’d wanted to.
“I want to,” Tony says, his foot outstretched under the small metal table, tangling with Steve’s legs. “I want this, you, forever.”
Tony finishes the wine in his glass and pours another, stuck somewhere between wanting the dutch courage to say what he wants to say and not wanting to risk being a mess in front of Steve. “The thing is,” Tony says, once he’s taken another sip of wine. “I don’t know if I can be friends with you.”
“If Bucky’s alive, then someone must have found him after he fell, and I don’t know how he could survive that, except—” Steve stops, a memory shooting to the forefront of his mind. “When I found him, the first time—”
“You’d want that?” Tony asks, one hand on Steve’s stomach as he tilts his neck, giving Steve more access. “Really?”
“Five more,” Steve says, leaning down and pressing kisses up the length of Tony’s spine until he reaches his neck. “Can you take it?”
“Oh I’m going to enjoy this,” Tony says, his eyes fluttering shut for a moment when Steve reaches down and runs his fingers through Tony’s hair. Swallowing, Tony opens his eyes when Steve removes his hand, and there’s a pleasant tingle at the base of his skull as Steve looks at him in approval. “Yeah,” Tony breathes out as he gets Steve’s jeans unbuttoned and grins at the sight of no underwear, just Steve’s thick cock curving up towards his stomach. Licking his lips, Tony watches as Steve pushes his jeans down enough to fully expose himself and he waits, fingers digging into Steve’s thighs, until Steve leans back and raises an eyebrow.
Steve gets up from the chair and stands behind Tony, sliding his hands around Tony’s waist. Pressing a kiss behind Tony’s ear, he holds him as Tony finishes washes his hands. “You,” Steve says quietly. “I want you.”
They shower quickly, even with Tony distracted by the sheer expanse of wet Steve skin in his face, and head downstairs to the kitchen where Tony switches on the coffee maker as Steve starts chopping fruit up for breakfast.
“You awake?” Steve asks, watching Tony fondly over the rim of his mug, his back up against the arm of the couch, legs outstretched and tangled with Tony’s who is mirroring him at the other end of the couch.
Tony sighs, his free hand twisting in the beach towel, fingers pressing into the soft sand below them. “For how long?” he asks quietly.
“I’m hungry is what I am,” Steve says, continuing to walk. “Where’s this food truck you promised me.”
It only takes a few more thrusts before Steve’s coming, his cock pulsing deep inside Tony as he fills him up even more, and he groans, almost falling forward as if his strings have been cut.
Tony’s got grease smeared on his skin, his low slung sweatpants and old t-shirt also showing signs of wear, and there’s a pair of goggles pushed up in his messy hair.
“Jesus, Tony,” Steve says, shifting onto his side, his hand coming to cup the back of Tony’s head. “Come here.”
“Sweetheart, I just want to make sure you’re okay,” Steve says, leaning against the doorframe and resting his head against his forearm. “I don’t know what that ray gun did to you.”
She looks around before she takes a deep breath and lets it out slowly. “When he shot me? That wasn’t the only time I met him,” she says. “When I was younger, before Clint got me out, I was—well. I wasn’t doing nice wholesome things like this. Winter Soldier and I had been sent after the same mark, and we ended up at a crossroads when the mark went into hiding.”
He doesn’t, he has some social skills as rusty as they are, and instead he steps back, gesturing for Steve to come in. “Hi,” he says. “You brought me flowers.”
“Had an awful breakup where you found me convulsing on the bathroom floor because I’d done too much coke?”
And that’s—Tony knows what he’s saying, has always known that sometimes Steve can’t say it. Tony leans in and kisses him, bringing a hand up to run through Steve’s hair as he does. “Your face is okay, I guess,” Tony says, nudging Steve’s face with his nose after breaking the kiss. “Could stand to look at it a while longer, maybe.”
And that would be fine, even Tony has old photos, they’ve gone through the photo albums he’s kept before, but these—these are Tony in lingerie, and Steve can’t stop staring.
The frown on Tony’s face doesn’t go away, and it’s making Steve want to reach over and smooth the lines away, to try and find some way of changing Tony’s mood. He’s sadly very aware of how pathetic this makes him.
“Before then, even,” Tony says. “Go on, do your worst, tell Steve my childhood shames, ruin his image of me.”
The first time it happened, Steve had stood there in shock as Tony hoisted the baby in his arms, cuddling him close and laughing as the kid grabbed at his sunglasses. Steve hadn’t heard Tony laugh like that before, and he was spellbound. Tony kisses their cheeks and lets them gnaw on his fingers, doesn’t mind when they drool on his expensive suits, and Steve—Steve just doesn’t know what to do with that.
“You’re not taking me somewhere fancy, are you?” Steve asks as they fall into step walking to the car Tony has idling near the square.
The sound of skin against skin echoes in the bedroom, the setting sun casting shadows across their bodies, and Steve hopes that the cameras in their room are recording, that later they’ll be able to watch this together, because Tony looks so fucking stunning. The orange glow coming through the window lights Tony’s skin up, making Steve want to paint him exactly like this, with Tony’s hole stretched out around Steve cock, sweat running down his body and his head tipped back in bliss.
“I—fuck, Steve, you need to be inside me,” Tony says, his hands running up Steve’s arms like he’s trying to memorise every inch of Steve’s skin with his fingertips.
Stumbling out of bed, Steve heads to his bathroom, and gets the shower going as hot as his skin can stand. His legs are barely holding him up, but it helps, it’s helping. The bathroom fills with steam and he breathes it in, the coldness in his chest dissipating with each inhale.
The vulnerability in Tony’s eyes kills Steve, and he wishes he could erase whatever it is that still has Tony sometimes feeling like he’s one misstep away from Steve not wanting him anymore.
“I—” Tony laughs in disbelief. “Yeah,” he says, reaching down and running his hand over Steve’s hair, resting his palm on Steve’s neck. “That’s one word for it. Let me—I want to touch you.”
“You know,” Tony says, as the door to his bedroom opens. “One day I’m going to make you use this commanding attitude on me with much more exciting results.”
“We were going to get dinner, right?” Steve asks, in a desperate attempt to change the subject before his pants start feeling too tight.
“Wow, okay,” Tony says, climbing off Steve and getting out of bed. “Come on. I’m going to be right there with you.”
Tony sighs at the feeling, and he turns over in Steve’s arms so he can face him, hooking a leg over Steve’s hip as he cuddles closer. “You’re a pain,” he says. “In my ass.”
Looking up, Steve glances over at Tony and smiles. “You have to say that,” he says. “Given everything.”
It’s hideous. Bright green with a reindeer on the front, and what Steve sadly suspects are light up bulbs on it that are draped over the reindeer’s antlers. Sighing, he pulls on a tank top before he looks at the sweater again. He knows Tony left it here, and if he doesn’t wear it, Tony will definitely have something to say. Or he’ll pout mockingly and Steve won’t be able to resist putting it on anyway.
“No,” Tony says, leaning in and kissing Steve, his orgasm fried mind unable to think of what to say. He shifts on his knees when the kiss comes to an end and grimaces at the sticky feel around his crotch. “Ugh, that’s not going to be fun to go home with.”
There’s a red flush on Tony’s cheeks, and he glances away. “Well. It seems to make people happy. Doesn’t make up for—” he cuts himself off. “It’s something, I guess.”
“Huh,” Tony says, swinging his legs over the edge of the bar and reaching for the decanter of scotch. “Drink?” he asks, offering it to Steve. “I need another.”
Easing himself off the bench, Tony stands up, the fresh tattoo pulling at his skin as he walks towards the mirror and looks at himself. He’s amazed by what he sees, he left the choice of colours up to Steve and there’s an explosion of red and yellow on his skin, with green leaves dotted in here and there. As Steve said, the numbers aren’t lost in the colour, instead standing out in the petals, and Tony’s overwhelmed at how beautiful Steve’s made his idea look.
Steve rubs their noses together before kissing Tony again. “Yeah,” he says, lips brushing over Tony’s mouth. “I’d—if you want to do it, I’d like that.”
“You sure?” Steve asks, running his hand through Tony’s hair before gripping the strands and lifting Tony’s head up from the bed so he can look him in the eyes. “I’m going to take my hand away, if you fall to your knees, that’s on you.”
“I asked the nurses,” she says. “They told me he likes to cuddle the babies, give parents like me an hour or so to ourselves. I didn’t—well. I’ve never met a billionaire before, but I didn’t expect him to be like this.”
The water is already running when they set foot inside the bathroom, and Steve steps inside the shower, letting the water run down his body so he can start to wash away the last few hours. He enjoys the warmth of the spray for a moment before he looks over at Tony and frowns. “You getting in?”
“What shoot?” Steve asks, looking up from his book and nudging Tony with his foot. They’re at opposite ends of the couch in their bedroom enjoying a lazy Sunday afternoon, and Steve cherishes these moments. The afternoon light plays across Tony’s face when he looks up, and Steve can’t hide the smile that crosses his face at the sight.
Steve cuts him off with a kiss, part of him still amazed at the fact he gets to have Tony like this, pressed up against him like there’s nowhere else in the world he’d rather be. Tony’s hands are gripping Steve’s hips firmly, and Steve pushes forward, groaning when he feels the line of Tony’s hard cock against his.
“This is fun,” Natasha says, raising an eyebrow as she drops her stance. “You don’t whine like Clint does when I hit him.”
But Tony’s lips are so soft against his, and he finds himself lingering for longer than he intended to, and then he feels Tony’s hand against his cheek, Tony’s cold hands gently stroking Steve’s skin, and it’s—. Steve didn’t know kissing Tony would be like this, and now he doesn’t know if he’s ever going to be able to let it go.
Instinctively wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist, Steve smiles up at him. “Thank you,” he says. “We can leave the shoot as it is, it’s okay. But maybe—” Steve hesitates. “I think I’d like to do something for kids of immigrants.”
“Tony, look at me,” Steve says, his hand sliding to cup Tony’s cheek, but not forcing him to look up. “Do you think I would’ve spent the last eight years missing you if I thought that? If I’d ever thought that?”
“I know you do,” Steve says softly, leaning down and pressing a kiss against the back of Tony’s neck. “I know,” he says again, just before he brings his hand down, harder this time, and Tony
Tony lands next to him and helps him up. “We’re not going to beat him like this,” he says. “Steve, we gotta—”
When Steve opens the drawer there’s several sets of clothes in there, along with the cashmere socks Steve’s taken to wearing around the tower because they’re so soft, and Steve reaches out to touch them. Swallowing around the lump in his throat, Steve quickly gets dressed and pauses to look at Tony. He’s still in bed, but he’s grabbed a tablet and is muttering under his breath about bulletproof fibres, and even with all that’s going on in his life, Steve doesn’t think he could be happier with his life.
Steve wouldn’t be able to say where he ends and Tony begins, they’re a tangle of sweaty limbs as Steve fucks him, as Tony scrapes his blunt nails along whatever parts of Steve’s skin he can reach, and Steve’s completely lost in the physical feeling of being so enmeshed with Tony’s body.
“Just trying to lighten the mood,” Tony says. “Look, there’s a lot of ways this could go, and I don’t know where all the pieces are going to fall, but I do know that I’m by your side in this. That however you want to play it, I’m backing you. I don’t want you to think I’m not.”
Steve laughs, lowering the bowl and leaning in, pressing a quick kiss against Tony’s mouth. “Later, then.”
The combination of the praise, Steve’s hand on his neck, and Steve’s cock in his ass sends Tony’s head spinning, and as Steve starts to fuck him, it’s all he can do to hang on. Steve sets a brutal pace, slamming into Tony with each thrust, right up against his stinging ass, making Tony cry out as the sensations send pleasure through his entire body.
“That’s quite an offer,” Steve says, knocking his knee against Tony’s and smiling when Tony looks at him. “I’m okay. Could we—Natasha wants to take me to lunch after training tomorrow, but can we get dinner this week?”
“Good,” Steve says, a possessive rush flowing through him at the idea. He knows it’s not real, that Tony got fucked years before Steve came along, but—. Fuck, he wishes it had been him who had the pleasure of seeing Tony fall apart on his first cock.
“Relax,” she says. “I don’t think anyone is looking to you for fashion advice. But I’m sure Tony would help you out if that’s your thing.”
Steve’s never asked if it was that that made Tony want to come back permanently, or if Tony had been looking for an excuse to wear the armor again. And he’s certainly never asked if Tony rejoining the team was the reason he and Pepper broke up. Steve’s not sure he wants to know.
“Shut up,” Tony says with a smile. “I’m trying to be a good example to the youth. Look, there’s hot chocolate, lets get that, my hands are freezing.”
“I think maybe you should think about it now,” Tony says, rolling off Steve and sitting up, his back against the headboard. “Natasha knows about the Winter Soldier, she knows you suspected it was Bucky. She, at least, deserves to know that your suspicions were right, especially if you want to help him.”
“I should’ve gone back when he fell, I should’ve looked for him, found him, if I had then he wouldn’t be—and I wouldn’t—”
Steve catalogues the equipment they’re using, trying to remember as much of it as possible to tell Tony when he gets back. If they know what’s being used on Bucky, then maybe if they get him back, they can—. Steve senses Pierce coming up behind him and clamps down on his thoughts.
“I got you,” Steve says, quickly moving to rip the fabric off the headboard loop. Unwrapping Tony’s wrists, Steve lazily swipes at the mess on his hand before he throws the fabric to the side and settles back down on the bed. Tugging Tony close, Steve runs a hand through Tony’s sweat soaked hair, pressing soft kisses against Tony’s face before he reaches his mouth. Steve lets Tony take control of the kiss as he slides a hand over Tony’s hips, playing with the catches on the waistband that’s still twisted around him.
“It seems like a pretty big coincidence,” Steve says, raising an eyebrow. “From what I remember about Rhodey, he wouldn’t have you live somewhere he hadn’t thoroughly researched, and it’s not like I was hiding.”
“I know you missed the eighties, but no one says hacked anymore,” Tony says, looking up and wiping his hands on his tank top. “Where did you learn that word?”
“Oh like you don’t sneak down to daycare and get all the kids hyped on sugar anyway,” Cynthia says with a fond smile.
Steve answers in the affirmative, and Tony leads Steve through the house towards the garden, startling slightly when Steve takes his hand. Walking to the structure at the end of the garden, Tony scans his eye and waits for the doors to slide open. The lights switch on as they walk inside, and Tony can’t help but watch Steve’s face as he takes it all in.
“Ouch,” Tony says, rubbing the back of his head as he turns around, a carton of eggs in his hand. “You know, for someone so big, you’re goddamn quiet when you walk.”
“So,” Steve says in a rough voice, moving his thumb away, his hands running down Tony’s arms, unable to stop touching him. “Was that obvious enough?”
“Kinda thought I was being obvious,” Steve says, lifting one shoulder up in a shrug. “Natasha teases me about it all the time.”
A shiver runs down Tony’s spine as he watches Steve retrieve the paddle from the box and he quickly strips down, putting his clothes on a chair. There’s already a pleasant haze coming over his brain as he stands there naked, his cock so hard he can’t resist giving himself a few strokes. “I want—”
“Steve!” Tony cries out, smacking Steve on the shoulder. “That was custom, and I—wait, what are you—”
Letting out a sigh, Tony hopes he’s past the age of inappropriately timed boners and crosses the street. “Hi,” he says as he reaches Steve. “Ready for you to hurt me.”
“Not sure,” Tony says, leaning in and trailing a line of kisses up Steve’s neck. “Maybe we should move this to my room and you can try and convince me again?”
“You don’t have to get me one,” Tony says, shoulders hunched over a little as they continue walking. “Most people don’t.”
“Want you to come in me,” Tony’s muttering in Steve’s ear. “Want you to fill me up and keep going, don’t pull out, I know you can, I want to be full of you.”
“I’m just saying,” Tony says, patting Steve’s ass, leading him to falter on his way to the elevator. “It’s a good ass.”
Steve’s still kind of wired by the time he tries to go to bed, and he’s awake when he hears a noise at his door. Getting out of bed, he opens the door and finds Natasha standing there. “Hey,” he says. “You okay?”
By the time he’s out of the shower, he’s stopped shivering, but he can’t shake the memories, can’t get them out of his head. Steve forgot, almost, what it was like to have the nightmares, it’s been months since he had one and it’s been almost a year since it was this bad. Looking at his bunched up sheets, Steve sighs and gets dressed, knowing he won’t be able to get back to sleep tonight.
Steve picks up the last box under the tree and starts to open it, feeling Tony’s eyes on him. It’s got some heft to it, and the reveal of a plain box under the wrapping paper piques Steve’s curiosity. When he finally gets it open, he sucks in a breath. “Tony,” he whispers. “What—”
“You’ve got me,” Tony says, his fingers playing with Steve’s hair at the nape of his neck. “You, uh. So. Thing is, depending on what age I am exactly, I—not that it matters because God knows you and I have more than made up for it, but—”
“You know I never liked that side of your life anyway, Tony,” Steve says, bringing Tony’s hand up with his and kissing it. “There’s a million ways you could try and talk yourself out of this, and I get it, I really do. But I just want to know one thing.”
And that’s all Steve gets out before he’s kissing Tony, his lips tentatively pressing against Tony’s mouth in the briefest of kisses, and Tony swears his brain shorts out. Before he can even react, before he can touch Steve, return the kiss, do
Steve doesn’t need any more encouragement than that, and he willingly goes, sinking into Tony’s touch. Tony’s hands are gripping his coat tight, like he wants to make sure Steve’s really there with him, and Steve buries his face against Tony’s neck, breathing in the scent of his cologne. “I couldn’t—fuck, Tony, I—.”
Tony lets Steve get him onto the bed, arranging his limbs as he wants, and he waits in anticipation, trying not to rut against the bed. Letting out a sigh when he feels Steve’s hands against his hip, Tony closes his eyes, just wanting Steve to take charge.
“I’m healed,” Steve says, ducking his head to kiss a bruise on Tony’s shoulder lightly before he trails a line of kisses up Tony’s neck. “Tony, I’m fine.”
“And besides,” Tony says, running a hand down the baby’s back. “Like all sensible people, she seems to be very comfortable in your arms.”
“I puked on you, I yelled at you, I tried to hit you, and then you had to drag me away from the fight I did get into,” Tony rattles off before shrugging. “Take your pick.”
Tony nods and walks through to the back room that he was in earlier in the week. When he walks in, he instantly spots the stencil on Steve’s station and part of him itches to go and peek at it, but he doesn’t. Instead, he stands and looks at the walls, eyes flicking over the art that’s covering them until a piece catches his eye. It’s not like the rest, it’s abstract, painted in deep colours, and Tony’s not an art critic but there’s something that hits him in the gut as he looks at it. He would swear he can hear it screaming. It’s disconcerting, but Tony likes it. Understands it, in a way.
“No,” Steve says, watching the way Tony’s biting at his bottom lip, turning it as red as the fabric wrapped around his wrists. “You, like this? Only I get to see this.”
“It’s my day off,” Steve says, finishing the last of his burger and crumpling up the wrapper, throwing it in the trash can. “You’re my only client.”
“It’s fine, you don’t have to—what are you doing?” Tony asks, his eyes widening as Steve fluidly slides onto the sand, kneeling in front of Tony, his hand running up Tony’s thigh. “Steve—”
Steve laughs and pushes up on his elbows, looking down at Tony. He looks gorgeously fucked out, messy hair and a lazy orgasm induced smile on his face, and Steve’s fingers itch to pick up a pencil and sketch him like this. He’s never seen Tony look so relaxed and Steve wants to make it happen as many times as possible. “Take up yoga,” Steve says, carefully slipping out of Tony and detangling their limbs. “Because we’ll be doing that again.”
“Apparently we’re too old to be making out on the couch,” Tony says, trying to find a way to get up without kneeing Steve in the groin but quickly giving up. “I can’t believe we fell asleep.”
It’s quiet for a moment before Steve hears Tony sigh, and then the door opens and Tony’s standing there looking twenty years younger than he did when they left the tower. Steve can feel his eyes widen as he looks Tony over. “I—you—”
“I’m sure,” Tony says, kissing the hinge of Steve’s jaw before leaning back to meet his eyes. “Steve, I’m sure. Okay?”
His head is woozy, and it’s not only from the head trauma, it’s medicinal, it’s something in his blood and that’s—.
“Sorry,” Tony says. “You spend as much time as I have around the military, you can spot it, but I’m sure the tattoos work for everyone else.” He pauses for a moment, not sure he has the right to ask the question he wants to, but his curiosity takes over. “Why’d you get out?”
“Oh good,” Tony says, walking over and placing a baby in Steve’s hands. “Here, I need to get out of the suit.”
“Hey, I’d rather have that than a client who winces each time the needle comes near them,” Steve says, leaning back and looking at his work. “Sitting well isn’t something everyone can do.”
His cheeks heating up, Steve swallows and steps into the elevator, carefully still gripping Tony’s thighs. “Tony, I—”
Steve goes quiet. He hasn’t been to visit her, he wants to, but it’s been hard enough, adjusting to this new world, and the idea of seeing Peggy like that—. “I’m a coward,” he says eventually. “For not going to see her. I’ve known where she is, but—”
“Shocking,” Tony says, as Steve yawns and slides off the couch, holding one hand out to him. Tony takes it, letting Steve pull him to his feet, and goes with it when Steve pulls him closer, kissing him softly. “Mmm, okay, good way to wake up.”
“If I hadn’t, someone else would’ve,” Tony says. “All I did was offer a good salary and the opportunity to make a difference.”
And the thing is, Tony’s right. They could’ve done this sooner, and maybe it would’ve worked out then, Steve doesn’t know, but they’re here now, and Steve—he couldn’t ask for anything more. Leaning over the mess of wrapping paper between them, he kisses Tony softly, letting their mouths play together in a quiet reassurance of what he feels.
“Dad met them all in the sixties, partying hard in Vegas, I imagine. Think there’s still some photos around somewhere,” Tony says with a small smile. “I met them as a kid, but I don’t remember. Wasn’t exactly the best environment for a kid to be running around.”
“There are more fun ways to warm me up,” Tony says, nudging Steve with his knee. “If you’re interested.”
It’s been a long time since Tony’s woken up wrapped in another man’s arms and he lets himself enjoy the feel of Steve’s body up against him, the weight of his arm across Tony’s stomach. He doesn’t want to open his eyes, because if he does it means he has to actually wake up for real, and that means Steve will go on his run and Tony’s half baked plan for a lazy morning with him will be ruined.
“Don’t mention it,” Tony says, picking his fork back up. “I’m also gonna want to see how far down that blush goes one day. Just so you know.”
Finally getting the sheets off Steve, Tony curls up against his side and reaches down, pressing a kiss against Steve’s neck as he holds the satisfying weight of Steve’s cock in his hand. “Now this is a gift,” he says, hiding his smile against Steve’s neck. “All for me.”
Steve’s chest rumbles as he laughs, and Tony smiles, kissing Steve’s laugh lines, knowing he’s going to be clinging to Steve for as long as he can. And if he’s honest about it, Tony kind of hopes that means forever.
“M’sorry,” Tony says as he straightens up enough to lift his face off Steve’s chest. “Guess that nap I took wasn’t enough to see me through.”
“Oh put your eyes away, Tony,” Peggy says with a laugh. “You think I don’t remember you telling me you wanted to marry Steve?”
Tony’s got on a damn Princess Leia outfit, gold curling around his chest and hips, with red fabric skimming over his crotch, and Steve’s brain feels like it’s shut down.
“You look like the best present,” Tony says, tugging at the sheets in an effort to reach Steve’s skin. “All wrapped up so prettily with sunkissed skin.”
“Really? Felt refreshing to me,” Steve says, walking over to his set up and flashing a grin at Tony.
“Then turn around so I can get your back,” Tony says with a smile. He quickly washes Steve’s back, trying to hide a smile when he hears Steve let out a muffled groan at the pressure of Tony’s hands on his lower back. “Enjoying that?”
“You want to be punished until you can’t form a thought,” Steve whispers in his ear and, just like that, Tony goes from semi hard to full on needing to come.
“Thanks,” Tony says, tucking his phone away before he sticks his hand in the bag and takes one, breaking off a bit and stuffing it in his mouth. “Oh these are good,” he says around his mouthful.
“It’s a nightlight,” Tony says before scrunching up his face. “Not that you’re five and need one, but—we both travel a lot, and you have nightmares, right? So do I. And there’s times I won’t be there when you have one, so I—”
“I don’t know,” Steve says, folding his arms across his chest now he knows Tony is mostly okay. “I thought I was fighting Loki, but when I woke up—” Steve cuts himself off and looks around. The floor is mostly cleared out with only the Avengers still around, but even so he lowers his voice so only Tony can hear him. “There was a note, in my handwriting, and it—it had something only I would know.”
“Someone had tipped them off,” Clint repeats with a shrug. “At least, that’s what we assumed. Nothing there but a bomb, which we narrowly escaped. Never seen anything like it before.”
“Maybe,” Tony says, tongue darting out to swipe over Steve’s bottom lip. “But is it any worse than the other ideas I’ve had lately?”
It’s been a long time since Tony’s had anything other than his hand and his imagination to get himself off, and the reality of seeing Steve’s lips wrapped around his cock is just too much for Tony to take.
“I can hear you thinking,” Tony mutters, his breath hitting Steve’s chest and making Steve’s nipples perk up. “Stop that.”
Tony’s legs are squeezing Steve’s sides as he tries to pull him in faster, but Steve easily resists, taking his time until he’s firmly seated inside him.
Tony drives them into town, parking in the lot a little way down from the new bakery, and when Steve gets out he blinks against the falling snow. Sticking his hands in his coat pockets, he turns to look at Tony and finds him gazing up at the sky with wonder on his face. Steve swallows, watching the way Tony smiles as the snow falls on him, flakes catching on his eyelashes and the curls of his hair sticking out under the red beanie he’d tugged on before they left.
“Tony said the same thing,” Steve says, leaning against the doorframe. “But if Bucky’s alive, even if—I have to find him. I have to
Tony pauses, the mug halfway to his mouth. “I didn’t know there was a us to ruin,” he says, lowering the mug without taking a sip. “Steve, I—”
“Thanks, JARVIS,” Steve says, leaning against the wall as the elevator starts to move. “Looking forward to seeing him as well.”
distracted by photos of hot twink me in lingerie, then we need to reconsider this relationship,” Tony says, smiling at him before looking back at the photos. “God, I was young.”
“Ah, of course,” Steve says, letting Tony take his hand and lead him towards the elevators. “What was I thinking?”
One day in September, Tony gets his three year chip with Steve in the room, smiling proudly from his seat, and the scent of burnt coffee and stale pastries in the air.
“You’ll get no argument from me,” Tony says, flicking at a screen before turning around on his stool. “Hey, so, I did some thinking about your whole double situation, consulted an old college rival.”
There could be a full USO routine going on in the corner of the room and Steve would be completely unaware as long as he’s got Tony beneath him reacting so beautifully to everything Steve’s doing. Steve didn’t know it could be like this, that he could let himself get consumed entirely by another person, and Steve’s struck by the fact that he would burn down worlds to keep this. To keep Tony.
It’s a reassuring weight, and Tony looks down to see Steve looking up at him with a content smile before Morgan grabs his attention. “What was that, little miss?” he asks, nodding as she tells him about the animals she’s met in Australia so far. He honestly just hopes she’s not going to come back wanting a venomous spider for a pet.
Tony sticks his hands in his hoodie pockets. “Call it making amends. Besides, I can't go ticking off the local firefighters if I’m going to keep building things in the shed.”
“We can always use another,” Pierce says. “Now. You said you didn’t have much time, so I’ll see you out.”
They’re the only two people here, and with the snow falling outside, the lights on the tree twinkling down on them, it feels like they’re the only two people in the world.
Natasha’s quiet for a moment, looking him over, and Steve doesn’t know what she’s looking for. Her face softens slightly and she sighs. “I’ll help. If I can.”
He’d loved Steve, so much. He really had. Steve had been the one spot of goodness in the chaos, and he’d been so determined not to drag Steve into the darkest parts of his life. He’s not sure how much he’d succeeded, but he could at least live in some state of denial until the day Steve found him on the bathroom floor.
As he meets Steve’s eyes, Tony wonders if he’s making a mistake, if this is too much too fast, Wonders if maybe staying tonight will be something he looks back on in several years and regrets. But the thing is, Steve’s looking at him in a way he hasn’t been looked at in a long time, and Tony can’t find it in him to walk away from that. “Yeah,” Tony says quietly. “Yeah, I’ll stay.”
“I’ve got your back,” Tony says, cutting Steve off. “The armour is ready, and if anything goes wrong, I’ll be there. I promise.”
“I love you,” Tony interrupts. “And you—this is as much for me as it is for you, trust me,” he says. “Fuck, I wish I could touch you.”
“Both,” Tony says. “From what Natasha says, the longer Bucky’s out of cryo, the less under their control he is. That gives us something to work with. As for SHIELD, we go digging. Find out every dirty little secret they don’t want us to know about.”
“Postponing it?” Tony suggests, pushing up on his bare toes to brush his lips over Steve’s curving mouth. “If you’re okay with that?”
“No,” Tony says, listening to the water around them and enjoying the feel of Steve holding him up like they’re in their own little world. “I’m good, here with you.”
“I think, Steve, that says more about your taste than it does about either of us,” Peggy says, voice clouded with amusement. “You may want to ponder that.”
“I wouldn’t expect that,” Pierce says. “But you did need to see him before—” Pierce pauses, narrowing his eyes. “Well. I’ve said enough.”
“I know,” Tony interrupts, holding a hand up. “It sounds ridiculous, but think about it, Hydra would want access to the highest levels of government. Things like the serum, Bruce’s research, Loki? That’s all information that SHIELD wouldn’t share with any other organisation because they’re too damn paranoid. It’s the only organisation Hydra would bother with.”
Steve can feel Natasha’s eyes on him as Tony sits down next to Steve, an everything bagel with cream cheese and capers on a plate that he puts on the table. Clint’s rocking on a backwards chair as he chews on some toast, and as Steve looks around at them all, he wonders how exactly he’s meant to say what he needs to.
“You’re not going to lose them, Steve,” Tony says. “I promise. But you are going to have to get out of bed.”
Dinner is at a small, family run Italian place where the owner greets Tony by name. Once they’re seated, Steve listens with interest as Luca tells Steve the story of how Tony met his father at a conference and sponsored his visa, how he made sure the rest of the family were able to join him, and how that led to Luca opening the restaurant. There’s a flush creeping up Tony’s neck as Luca speaks, and Steve nudges him with his foot, shooting him a smile.
“I don’t see the need,” Tony says with a shrug. “I do what I can, and sure, accolades are nice, but—”
“You can get lucky in another way if you know what I mean,” Tony says, wriggling a little on Steve’s lap, and Steve just holds onto him tighter.
Steve picks up his gift for Tony and hands it over. “I, uh. I hope you like it,” he says as Tony takes it from him.
“No. Maybe. I don’t know,” Steve sighs. “I don’t know what to do if I’m right and he is the Winter Soldier.”
“Hi,” Tony says as Steve steps under the spray, the water flattening his hair against his head. “You staying here tonight?”
“Isn’t it? You drag me down here and then say you don’t believe I am who I say I am? If you’re trying to test me, you’ll be the ones failing. Like I said, I’m not here to prove my loyalty.”
“You’re doing so good,” Steve says, his voice breaking through Tony’s thoughts like a shot of clarity. “Tony, sweetheart, do you want more?”
“That’s right, no,” Tony says. “We’re going to do Christmas, you and me. We’ll, I don’t know, FRIDAY?”
Steve’s fingers keep tracing patterns along Tony’s skin as he kisses him, teeth scraping down Tony’s neck in a way that has Tony letting out noises he didn’t know he could make. It’s intoxicating, dangerous in a way that Tony recognises could destroy them both, but he—he doesn’t think it will. He thinks it could’ve, before, if they’d tried this when they were younger, but now they’re older, slightly wiser, and all Tony can think is how much they deserve this. That maybe getting lost in each other is exactly what they’re supposed to be doing.
“There was a blip, apparently,” Tony says. “In simple terms, he thinks we had a visitor from another universe. Not space universe, more like... an alternate timeline? Which is apparently a thing that we have, and lord help us if Reed ever wants to explore that properly because I don’t think even Sue could stop him and she’s the only one who can talk sense into him, so—”
“Sure,” Steve says mildly. “I know you’re not going to trust me immediately, we have too much history for that, but I’m gonna work on it.”
“That a promise?” Tony asks, leaning forward in his chair as he reaches down and threads his fingers through Steve’s hair, noting the way Steve closes his eyes at the touch.
There’s a flippancy in Tony’s voice, but Steve’s not fooled, and he takes a few steps back over to the bed. Bending over, he holds Tony’s face and kisses him firmly, waiting until Tony starts to relax before he pulls away. “Thank you,” he says, kissing him quickly again. “Tony—thank you.”
“I do. There’s meetings just outside town, and my sponsor is, well. She’s rude and cranky, but that’s exactly what I need.”
Steve smiles at Tony, before he pulls him on top, enjoying the comforting feel of Tony’s body against his. “So,” he says, hands running along Tony’s skin. “You want kids?”
Making sure he’s steady on his feet, Steve straightens up with Tony balanced over his shoulder. “Not happening,” he says, ignoring the light thumps from Tony’s fists on his back. “You need a nap.”
Tony pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket and puts it on the counter. “I’m not really an artist, but this with some roses is what I’m looking for.”
Tony’s got the smallest baby Steve has ever seen cradled in his arms as he sits on a rocking chair, his head ducked as he smiles down at the kid, running one finger along the baby’s cheek. All Steve can do is stare through the glass, suddenly feeling like even one wrong move out here will cause irreparable damage to someone. He watches as Tony rocks the baby, trying not to listen to the murmured words Tony’s saying to it—him, if the blue knitted cap is an indicator, though Steve is well aware it might not be—and it’s just overwhelming.
Steve’s heart is pounding against his chest as he watches Tony stumble off towards his bedroom, and once Tony’s out of sight he sits there, staring across the room at the night sky coming through the windows. “A date,” he mumbles to himself. “Oh shit.”
Steve smiles, a soft curve of his mouth that Tony was never able to resist. “You had a problem,” Steve says softly. “I don’t blame you.”
The bed is the right height for Tony to bend over it, but his legs are already aching from the gym this morning and he wonders how long he can stay like this. His cock rubs against the sheets and he bites his lip at the feel, trying to resist pushing against the friction.
“You look good,” Steve says, and Tony can hear the unspoken ‘better than when I last saw you’ in that simple sentence.
Opening his eyes, Tony’s met with Steve’s face all flushed, his hair pushed back from his forehead, and he leans in, meeting Steve’s mouth with his own in an urgent kiss. “M’so fucking hard,” Tony mumbles against Steve’s mouth. “Can you—”
“Do you? Because when I found out that Obie was double dealing behind my back, it almost killed me. And that’s not even taking into account the fact he did try to kill me. Twice. Steve, there’s some rocks you don’t want to turn over.”
Steve can sit and paint with the older kids, can answer their questions and read stories in a hesitatingly slow voice, but he doesn’t have the ease that Tony has. Never will. Half the time he goes with Tony to these things, he spends staring at Tony and wondering how Tony does it. He could make a joke about the kids being on the same mental level, but that would diminish the very real connection Tony manages to make with the kids.
It’s a tacky tourist magnet, and Tony tells Steve the story of how their tradition started at MIT because Rhodey didn’t have a clue what to buy him, so ended up giving him a tacky Boston magnet that Tony immediately stuck to his toolbox. “No one had ever bought me a Christmas gift when they didn’t have to,” Tony says, looking at this year’s magnet from Ohio of all places. “Rhodey was the first person I met who didn’t ask me for anything because of who I was.”
There’s quiet from Steve as he works, more lines etched in Tony’s skin before he says anything. “That makes sense,” he says eventually. “I got my first one before I signed up. They changed the policy to open up recruitment, and I was a smartass. Figured if I were going into a warzone I might as well have something on me I wanted. Meant a lot more when I came out of it with something I didn’t want on me.”
“I don’t know why I decided to subject myself to this,” Steve says, leaning back in his chair, his chest feeling warm as he looks at Tony and Peggy. “You’re both terrible people.”
And kids love Tony, they enjoy Steve, but Tony’s practically a god to them. Whenever they get asked to visit children’s hospitals or orphanages, Tony’s the first one to sign up, usually turning his wide eyes on Steve until Steve agrees to accompany him. It’s ridiculous, really, Steve could easily get out of it every time, but he feels bad saying no to the kids.
Natasha curls her legs underneath her and leans back against the couch cushions, her eyes darkening. “Possibly. I don’t know what you’re looking for, but—”
The water’s cool against his legs as they walk in, and Tony knows he’s clinging to Steve’s hand, but Steve seems okay with it, so he’s not going to let go. It’s calm, like Steve promised, and Tony’s worries slowly dissipate with every step they take. Eventually they’ve walked so far in that the water’s up to Tony’s clavicle, and he tugs on Steve’s hand, getting him to stop.
“No,” Tony breathes out, pulling his hoodie off. “No, I can’t.” His sneakers and jeans follow, and Steve watches greedily as Tony pushes his boxers down his thighs before stepping out of them, leaving a pile of clothes on the floor.
“Next year it’s your turn to dress up,” Tony says, shifting a little to give Steve better access. “Something, ah, skimpy. Maybe in public.”
Tony’s had a grand total of one visitor since moving to town, and that’s only because Mrs Davies insisted on bringing him a casserole when she saw him working on the house. Which, to be fair, had been very welcome considering Tony had forgotten about dinner while getting JARVIS wired into the house. Tony’s not used to being social now he’s sober, truth be told it’s half the reason he ended up in rehab, and his rusty social skills being put to the test by Steve of all people has to be some kind of cosmic joke.
Steve wakes up shivering, grasping for something he can’t reach, the memory of ice water rushing into his lungs so vivid he feels like his chest is going to cave in. Making fists with his hands, he digs his nails into his palms, trying to calm himself.
He’s down at SI to sign off on a merchandising contract Tony’s set up for him, with proceeds going to various charities, when he hears a commotion from outside Tony’s office. Scribbling his name on the contracts, he pokes his head out the door and finds Tony cuddling a baby, a woman hovering over him.
“Here,” he says as he puts the tray down on the coffee table. “It’s not much, but there’s more in the kitchen if you get hungry.”
“It’s gorgeous,” Tony says, watching Steve’s face light up. “You did more than I could’ve imagined, and my imagination is pretty incredible.”
“I—” Steve pauses as he adds another finger, watching as Tony’s hole takes him so easily even as tight as he is. “That I wish it had been me,” he says, looking up and meeting Tony’s eyes as he fingerfucks him. “That I’d been the one to give you this for the first time, that—”
“I don’t need to go to France,” Steve says. “It’s—I haven’t had a Christmas since I woke up. Not really. The first year—” he breaks off and shakes his head. “The first year I didn’t want to think about Christmas, it was too raw, I couldn’t—”
“If you think I’m any better, you’re going to be disappointed,” Tony says. “There’s a laundry list of reasons laying out why you shouldn’t even be friends with me, let alone—”
Steve’s lips are firm against his, and it's over before Tony can fully comprehend that Steve is kissing him. When he opens his eyes, Steve is staring at him with flushed cheeks, his eyes wide like he’s not entirely sure what he just did was the right choice, and Tony—.
“Bucky, yeah,” Steve says against Tony’s neck. “He’s missing an arm, and there’s—there wasn’t anything of him left. I think I could’ve been in the room with him and he wouldn’t know me.”
“See, I’m fine,” Tony says, sitting up. “Now, what happened to you? JARVIS showed me the footage, why were there two of you?”
By the time they’re done in the shower, Steve feels dead on his feet, and it’s all he can do to towel himself off enough so he doesn’t create a damp patch on the mattress. Tony ushers him towards the bed, and when Steve hits the soft sheets, he presses his face against the pillow, breathing in Tony’s scent. “Sorry,” he says, turning his head to the side as Tony slips into bed next to him.
“Let me just—” Steve’s hands drop from Tony’s body and he leans back, grabbing some paper. “Stay still,” he says as he splays the paper against Tony’s side, picking up a pen and quickly outlining a space. “Okay,” he says, taking the paper away and looking at it. “You can put your shirt back on.”
“Ugh.” Tony looks away and shrugs, his fingers twisting together. “It’s different, like this. It’s fine to look back and think about how I looked but—”
“It’s come up a few times,” Steve says, pressing a kiss where skin meets the reactor before he shifts, watching with pleasure at the way Tony’s face reacts to their cocks brushing together.”
Tony’s taken back to the first time Steve had said that to him, and he knows by the look on Steve’s face that the phrasing was intentional, which sparks something in him that’s been dead for a long time. “Yeah,” he says. “I’d like that.”
“Mmm?” Tony looks up from his coffee, blinking at Steve. “You going to SHIELD? You got your phone? Let me know if anything’s hinky.”
“No you’re not,” Tony says, running a hand down Steve’s chest. “But I forgive you, given everything.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony says, turning to look at him. “Did you want to cram your sizable frame into a car for five hours? Because we can, if you’re complaining.”
Steve looks at Tony, the exhaustion on his face clear. “You okay?” Steve asks, pressing his sock clad toes against Tony’s thigh.
“God, Peggy,” Steve groans, his face flushing like the first time he met her. “Don’t say it like that.”
“It’s not like I had normal Christmases,” Tony says. “I was shoved into a tux and made to glad hand with senators and oil tycoons as a kid, I don’t think you want to know what my idea of Christmas is.”
Tony nods as he takes them, paying an inordinate amount of attention to the pan, and Steve watches him for a moment before he turns back to his own mixture. It’s looking ready, so he pours it into a mug and steps away, leaning back against the counter while Tony keeps stirring his.
“And what’s that?” Tony asks before he places a kiss against Steve’s neck, feeling his pulse jumping. “Hmm?”
Tony’s got his legs wrapped around Steve’s hips, kissing him as they stumble through the bedroom doorway, Steve holding him up with one arm as the door closes behind them. The bed is still messy from when they left it this morning, and Tony wriggles as Steve lets him down on the sheets. Looking up at him, Tony licks his lips as he runs his eyes down Steve’s body. They’d been in the gym before the meeting and Steve’s still clad in track pants and a tank top. Pausing at the bulge in Steve’s pants, Tony smiles and looks back up to meet his eyes.
“Makes sense,” Tony says. “I don’t have nearly as good of an excuse for why I live in the same building as my work.” He looks around, greedily taking in this glimpse of Steve’s life that he’s being allowed to see. There’s a drafting table in the corner set up with lights, a comfortable looking couch with a separate footrest that Tony assumes Steve uses when he’s having a bad day, and then Tony’s attention is caught by the slightly faded inspirational poster featuring a cat telling him to ‘hang on in there’. “That doesn’t seem like your style,” Tony says, hiking a thumb at the poster as he sits on the couch. “What’s the story?”
Steve’s almost healed by the time they make it back to the tower, but that doesn’t stop Tony from fussing over him, and Steve lets him, indulging in the novelty of someone looking after him. Pulling the uniform off is always the worst part of being injured, and today is no different. The skin knitted around the edges of the fabric with both the knife wound and gunshot wound, and Steve hates how it feels to have his skin ripped away.
Steve lifts his head from Tony’s thigh and rolls onto his back, his cock tenting the sheets that are still wrapped around him, and Tony smiles at the sight.
,” he cries out at the first hit with the paddle, his knees buckling beneath him, and it’s only Steve’s firm hand on his lower back keeping him in place. “Fuck, I—” Tony sucks in a breath and waits for the next strike, his legs shaking as he feels Steve trailing the edge of the paddle over his ass. It’s perfect torture, knowing that he’s completely at Steve’s mercy right now, that he’ll be waiting as long as Steve wants him to wait.
“My dad was an asshole, but he wasn’t Hydra,” Tony says. “And Aunt Peggy would’ve punched anyone with even a hint of Hydra in them.”
“That’s not it,” Steve says, getting on the bed, the med kit next to him. Opening it, Steve rummages around until he finds some bruise cream, and he gestures for Tony to come closer. Tony takes a sip of the coffee before putting the mug back on the nightstand and inching closer to Steve. “You don’t make me uncomfortable,” Steve says as he starts to gently rub the cream on Tony’s face. “Not in the way you’re thinking.”
“Tony had a minor incident,” comes Natasha’s voice in his ear. “He’s being looked at. Where are you?”
“Guess so,” Tony says, walking around the bed and kissing Steve. “Go get ready, I’ll meet you there.”
Swallowing around the sudden lump in his throat, Steve takes a step back and bumps into someone he didn’t realise was behind him. “Sorry,” he says, before noticing they’re watching Tony as well. “Is that—”
Steve cuts Tony off with a kiss, pressing their mouths together firmly, and he only means for it to go on for a moment, just to prove he’s up for the challenge, but—.
Steve nods before he leans in and kisses Tony, one hand gently cupping his cheek as he takes what he wants. “Get in position,” he says, his voice rough as he steps back, his gaze never leaving Tony.
“Okay, no,” Tony says, pushing himself up and looking up at Steve. “But your heart rate picked up, and not in a fun way.”
“Well,” Pierce says. “Who would’ve thought that you, of all people, would be on our side. I wouldn’t have believed it if Sitwell hadn’t heard it himself. Captain America, part of Hydra.” There’s a pause, and Steve doesn’t speak, waiting to hear what else Pierce is going to say. “I’m not sure I do believe it,” Pierce says, finally. “In fact, I know I don’t.”
Steve’s not sure when in the night they migrated together, but waking up with Tony in his arms is something Steve could definitely get used to. Pressing a kiss to Tony’s messy hair, Steve sighs and stares up at the ceiling, his fingers trailing over Tony’s back as he thinks on the events of the day before. He still doesn’t know what the right next step to take is, and the only thing he’s sure of is that the entire situation is going to get worse before it gets better.
“Fuck,” Tony breathes out, looking up at Steve, running his hands along Steve’s arms. “I—fuck. I didn’t think—”
“I got her,” Tony says, hovering above the fields in the North Meadow before flying down. “She needs help.”
Taking it back into the lounge, Tony notices Steve’s found some glasses and is pouring the wine he brought into them, and he’s struck by how painfully domestic it feels. It’s like a painful flashback to how his life had been until recently. He
They unwrap gifts from Natasha, soft sweaters in similar colours that Steve never would’ve picked out himself, but immediately loves. There’s a few smaller gifts from Pepper, more hot chocolate from Sam with a note that he’s keeping his supplier secret that makes Steve laughs, some treats from old SHIELD staff who now work with them, drawings from Clint’s kids, and before Steve realises it, all that’s left are their gifts to each other.
“Unchartered territory,” Tony says with a smile. “Technically. Body wise, anyway. Fuck, this is confusing. My body is a virgin but my mind isn’t? How does that—
Steve picks up his mug again and relaxes back into the couch, watching Tony’s eyes light up as he flicks through the list FRIDAY’s sent him. He’s not entirely sure what this means for his Christmas, but he thinks he can stop Tony from going too far. He’s just not sure he wants to.
“Here’s hoping,” Steve mutters under his breath, but not quiet enough for Tony to ignore, and he stumbles a little on his way to the back room. “Let me lock up,” Steve calls after Tony. “Go on through.”
Steve laughs before he kisses the top of Tony’s head. “I’m going to shower. Get JARVIS to tell me when we have to leave.”
“You’ll get to shove Greek food in your mouth soon,” Natasha says, seamlessly slipping in back at his side. “Is this about Bucky?”
“Oh, sorry,” Steve looks up from where he’s breaking down his station. “I—no? Unless that’s what you want to do?”
, Steve’s pulled back. Tony stares at him, the bubbling of the spaghetti the only sound aside from their breathing.
“But,” Tony continues, eyeing Steve. “You said ‘were’, and I kind of want to know, since you’re here on my doorstep and didn’t run away screaming when you saw me. I just—you were always the person I wanted to reach out to and was too scared to, and somehow we’ve ended up in the same place, and holy fuck stop me talking—”
“Steve, you—” Tony goes silent for a moment, and Steve just holds him patiently, waiting for him to gather his thoughts. “This goes both ways. Before you came along, I—well you know what my life was like. After Afghanistan it was like all I had was the mission, was the fight. Then you came along, with all the misfit friends, and suddenly I had a whole lot of people in my life I didn’t have before. I had people, other than Rhodey and Pepper, who stuck around. And for the life of me, I’ll never understand why, but it’s—. You changed my life, Steve Rogers. And I love you for that.”
“Whatever you need,” Steve says softly as he uncaps the bottle and tips two of the pills out into his hand. “Here, do you need water?”
“You wouldn’t be the person I fell in love with,” Steve says. “The man I’ve built a life with. Is having you like this fun? Sure. And if it were permanent, I’d be okay with it because you’re still you where it counts. But I’d miss those scars, I’d miss seeing the evidence of how hard you’ve battled to become the man you are. I’d miss the earned strength of your body. I’d miss seeing the laugh lines on your face, knowing I’ve helped put them there. I’d even miss the goatee.”
Steve sighs, holding Tony close, the polaroids scattered around them. “It’s not about winning,” he says. “Or about the lingerie.”
“It’s fine,” Steve says before he shakes his head. “I mean it’s not, obviously it’s not, but that’s not because of you.”
“Bring me back some,” Tony says, rolling onto his back as Steve gets out of bed. “And, uh. There’s some clothes in your size in the second drawer down.”
“Uh huh,” Tony says, leaning in so close he could count the water drops clinging to Steve’s eyelashes. “Just a little.”
“You’re not a coward,” Tony cuts in. “I invented a flying suit, and have more than one private jet, and do you know how many times I’ve been to visit her since I became Iron Man? Four. Four times. You’re not a coward for not visiting her yet, Steve. No more than I am.”
“Hey, Nat?” Steve asks as they stand up. “If we do find him, are you—with your history, are you going to be comfortable with it?”
“I’m fine,” Steve says. “Keep on him, I can’t—” Steve’s cut off as he catches a kick to the face and he stumbles backwards, falling into a dugout.
Steve’s mouth is so fucking warm, and Tony can’t even push up into it because Steve’s got his hand pressed against Tony’s hip, enough of a weight to keep him still. He’s completely at Steve’s mercy, and all Tony can do is go with it. The slick wet heat of Steve’s mouth is a goddamn revelation to Tony, and he almost wants to know how Steve got so damn good at sucking cock, but then Steve does something with his tongue and it’s all Tony can do to stop himself coming embarrassingly quickly.
“He was at that,” Peggy says. “But you turned out just fine. Look at you, you even bagged yourself Captain America.”
“I know,” Steve says, heading out of the workshop. “But you need to sleep, at least for a couple hours, and if you’re not going to listen to me, then—”
“Tough,” Steve says, as he dumps their mess in the trash can before looking at her with a small smile. “Because I’m gonna.”
“How long?” Tony asks, trying to move his fingers to squeeze Steve’s hand and not succeeding. “What’s—” he frowns at the taste of blood in his mouth.
“No,” Tony says, pushing off the seabed and letting himself float. “Not so bad.” He lets go of Steve’s hand and wraps his legs around Steve’s waist, trusting him to hold him up. “In fact,” he says. “I’m liking this more and more.”
The smile fades from Tony’s face at the reminder, and he nods. “I can’t come with you, and they’ll scan you,” he says. “They’ll take your phone.”
“And you haven’t aged a day,” Peggy says, her eyes shining with unshed tears. “I couldn’t believe it when Tony told me, but—well. I suppose if anyone had a chance of surviving, it would’ve been you.”
“Call it curiosity,” Steve says, setting his jaw. “I wanted to know who in SHIELD could be trusted.”
“Yeah,” Steve says, swallowing and shifting on the couch, his pants uncomfortably tight. “Hydra. Right.”
“Still not funny,” Steve sighs as he moves through the crowd, trying to urge people to get to a safe distance. There's no indication of what caused the explosion, and since there isn’t anyone running around trying to cause more chaos, Steve’s going to chalk it up to a horrible accident until he gets more information. Noticing how many people are bleeding, Steve shrugs his shirt off and starts tearing it into pieces, bandaging up what he can with what he has until the paramedics are able to get through the crowds.
“Offer free energy and people come running,” Tony says as he continues unpacking the groceries. “There’s cinnamon rolls in one of those bags, bagels and lox in another, maybe some muffins? I’m not really sure.”
“Relax, we’re just borrowing it for the night,” Rumlow says as he waves a scanner over Steve. There’s a beep when it passes over Steve’s phone, and he takes it out of his pocket when Rumlow holds out his hand.
Steve watches as the nanites crawl up Tony’s body and back into the casing until he’s standing there in the same jeans and t-shirt he’d been wearing at lunch. Holding the baby at arms length in front of him, Steve raises his eyebrows at Tony. “Take her,” he says, trying to find the right grip strength to not hurt her. “Tony—”
“Right, can’t be too honest around dear Anthony,” Peggy says, leaning over to Steve. “He’s awfully sensitive, you know.”
Steve grins before he gets back to sucking Tony’s cock. Tony’s hand doesn’t leave Steve’s hair, and Steve lets him tug at it, enjoying the slight sting of pain when Tony pulls just a little too hard. It’s grounding, reminding him that Tony is still Tony, whatever age he’s at, and Steve loves it.
It feels an awful lot like flirting, but it’s been a long time since Tony’s done that sober, and he has no idea if Steve’s on the same page.
It turns out that when there aren't major disasters, there’s not much for Steve to do. He’s been deflecting Fury trying to get him on SHIELD missions given his suspicions about Hydra, guilting Fury into believing he’s still adjusting to the new world, but he’s not sure how long that’s going to last. It's not a lie, really, he is still adjusting, it’s just not as hard as he’s telling Fury it is.
Everyone’s gathered in the large kitchen on the communal floor, and Steve watches as Tony goes straight for the coffee, pouring out two large mugs. Steve sits down at the table, across from Natasha and smiles at Tony when he hands him a mug. “Thanks,” Steve says, taking a sip before putting it down. There’s leftover pizza on the table, and Steve snags a box, eating it cold as he waits for Tony to finish making a bagel.
Tony stops by a stall selling Christmas ornaments and picks up a couple, smiling at the trader when she wraps them up for him. Steve traces a finger along one of the more delicate pieces, admiring the craftsmanship that’s gone into creating them. There’s a stall selling warm cookies, and Steve buys a bunch, sharing them with Tony as they continue strolling through the market.
“SHIELD,” Steve says, looking down at Tony’s head, feeling an overwhelming amount of fondness. “I’m okay, Tony.”
The man doesn’t want to hear him scream, Tony realises. It’s like there’s a damn science to what he’s doing as he cuts into Tony, as he hits him, as he heats up a poker to—.
Every intake of breath feels like ice in his throat, and his legs are trembling under the blankets. He’s dimly aware of his stuttering voice asking FRIDAY to turn up the heat, but it’s not enough, never enough and—.
“Generally a road trip doesn’t involve a private plane,” Steve says, leaning back in his chair. “But sure.”
“You sound very confident about that,” Steve says, pushing himself up, leaning back against the headboard. “Wish I could be.”
The shower goes some way to clearing Tony’s head, but it doesn’t get rid of the bruises, and after he gets out he stands in front of the mirror looking at himself. There’s dark circles under his eyes along with a cut over his cheekbone and a quickly developing bruise. His lips are cracked, and he looks way too fucking old for the age he is. There’s bruises scattered across his torso, and every time he moves it hurts. He knows he’s got a whole drawer full of pills that would fix that up for him, but he’s trying not to use them and—.
“Still,” Steve says, pausing in his works and gently moving Tony for an easier reach. “I shouldn’t assume. I guess we both have our issues.”
Steve feels his skin heat up, and he rolls his eyes in surrender. “Come on, then,” he says, reaching a hand out for one of the slightly older kids to take. “We need to find your parents.”
“Because I don’t get anything out of it, obviously,” Steve says, kissing Tony’s neck before shifting enough to pull out. “Such a pain.”
Frowning, Tony pokes his stomach. “Didn’t have abs back then,” he says almost absently. “Guess being a superhero is good for something.”
“Tony, come on,” Steve says, knocking on the door to their bathroom where JARVIS told him Tony was hiding. “It can’t be that bad.”
“I didn’t know you lived here,” Tony says before Steve can jump to conclusions. Not that Steve would. Or, at least, the Steve he used to know wouldn’t. “I retired, and Rhodey, he picked the place without me knowing, if it’s a problem, then—”
Instead, he gets out a saucepan, some milk, and the hot chocolate Sam gave him before he left, and gets to making himself something to kill the last remnants of cold lurking in him. Steve’s halfway through warming the milk when he hears the elevator ping, and he looks to the entrance to the kitchen just as Tony walks in.
Steve takes in the look on Tony’s face as Luca walks away. “You really don’t like it when people compliment you, do you?”
Steve slides his hands down to Tony’s lower back, fingertips slipping underneath the hem of Tony’s shirt. “Can we eat down here before I have to go? Pizza, or something?”
“You just takin’ my breakfast away from me now?” Steve asks, raising his eyebrows as his messy hair flops over his forehead.
Tony’s out of the car before Steve can say anything else, the bag with his market purchases left in the footwell. Steve picks it up, along with his cookies, and gets out of the car, trusting FRIDAY to secure the garage, but by the time he makes it into the compound, Tony’s vanished.
“If it were a Hallmark movie I think I’d need a dashing stranger upending my life,” Steve says, reaching for his mug and taking a sip of the cocoa. “And I’ve had enough of that.”
“It seemed like—” Natasha cuts herself off and bites her lip before continuing. “I think his programming wore off? Like the longer he was away from them, the more he could be something other than what they made him to be.”
“You don’t have to talk me into anything,” Steve says when he’s done taking his fill of Tony. “I just don’t want you to regret it.”
Tony snorts at that and rolls onto his back, wincing at the pull of his muscles. He’s sweaty and disgusting, can taste vomit in the back of his throat, and he wouldn’t be surprised if Steve ran screaming from him. “Twentieth century,” Tony says. “No one says stupor anymore, Cap.”
Tony takes a couple of steps, closing the gap between them, and then Steve’s warm hands are on him, turning him to the side and mapping out an area of Tony’s skin with his fingers.
Steve glances up to see that she’s right, they’re underneath the mistletoe, and Steve curses himself for not noticing it before. “Uh, we’re not—”
Steve wasn’t snooping, he wants to be absolutely clear on that. He’d been clearing out boxes that had been sent over from one of Tony’s storage facilities as they started sorting out what to bring with them to the new house, and, well. Steve hadn’t exactly expected to stumble across photos. Polaroids, to be exact, of Tony when he was younger.
The elevator opens to the penthouse, and Steve heads straight to the bedroom in a rush to get out of his uniform and see Tony. Pushing the door open to the bedroom, Steve pauses at what he sees. “Tony? I—”
“Merry Christmas,” Tony says, the curve of his mouth almost looking like a promise. “And mine is worse, look.”
Tony shivers as Steve wipes up the excess ink and blood on his skin, slowly realising how much his side is aching.
“That seems dangerous,” Steve says, holding the baby a little closer to his chest. “Tony, I don’t—I could hurt her. I’m too strong.”
“I’ll always take care of you,” Steve says softly, rubbing a circle on Tony’s hip. “Especially when you’re like this.”
“Even if we can, he’s going to have to make peace with what he’s done,” Natasha says. “And that won’t be easy.”
It doesn’t take long to open Tony up, and Steve swears that one day he’s going to spread Tony out and fuck him with his fingers until he’s begging to be allowed to come, but right now he’s too damn impatient to get inside him. Slicking himself up, Steve slowly pushes inside Tony, watching the way Tony bites his bottom lip, the way his mouth falls open when Steve is all the way inside, legs wrapped around Steve and smiling up at him as Steve starts to move.
“I wouldn’t go telling the public that,” Tony says, and Steve can see a slight flush appearing on Tony’s neck. “They’d want to scan you to make sure your brain isn’t atrophying.”
“Cut off the head and two more take its place,” Steve says. “That’s Hydra. Fuck, Tony, even if we take down this branch, there’s more out there.”
“That’s—I don’t—” Steve breaks off and sighs. “He gave us all somewhere to live,” he says. “He tries his hardest to fix everything he can, even when it’s to the detriment of his own health, and he’s so smart. I don’t know how I couldn’t—”
“Did you buy everything they made?” Steve asks as he roots around, pulling out a cinnamon roll, all gooey and smothered with frosting. It smells incredible, and he bites into it, unable to stop the moan that slips from his mouth.
Tony swallows, trying not to lean into Steve’s touch. “Good,” he says. “Considering I’m here to get it finished.”
Steve leans back in his chair and bites his bottom lip as he looks at Tony, not entirely sure how his idea is going to be taken. “There’s a Christmas Market in town,” he says. “I want to go.”
Tony stands up, needing to be on equal footing if they’re going to talk about this. “You’re not the only one who gets nightmares,” he says. “I can deal with that, I promise. And—” he breaks off for a moment before he decides to go all in. “I would like to stay, if you’re okay with it.”
“Well. Okay then. Someone get a distraction going before I have to pay to replace every tree in Central Park.”
So all of them move in, Steve settling into a lower floor quite comfortably, and he ends up spending most of his time helping to rebuild the tower. What Steve really wants to be doing is to be in the city helping people, working to fix all the damage the battle caused, but whenever he tries the press swarm him. Between the yelling and the cameras in his face, Steve’s come to realise he’s a distraction from the work good people have been doing, and he hates it.
Grabbing his side, Steve feels the blood pooling through his gloves, and he looks at Bucky, willing him to recognise him, to break through whatever the hell Hydra has done to him. “Buck,” he breathes out. “C’mon.”
“While you slept in,” Tony repeats. “We’re watching Die Hard.” Tony looks at Steve. “Any objections?”
Steve glances at him, taking in the way he’s fidgeting with his hands, and he nods. “You can get another pan out, or you can wait until I’ve made mine.”
Straightening up from shoving a box of cables in a corner of his office, Tony pauses at the sight of a photo on top of another box he’s yet to unpack, and he picks it up, running a finger across the glass. It’s he and Steve almost twelve years ago, the sun’s shining on them, Steve’s kissing his cheek, and Tony—he looks happy. He was happy, he remembers that. He’d flown them both out to Malibu for two weeks and they’d spent that day on the stretch of private beach in front of his house. Tony hadn’t been high, and it—. It had been good. Tony had almost felt normal. But then that weekend he’d had to meet up with an associate and he’d ended up making excuses for standing Steve up while doing coke in Vegas like the worst kind of cliche.
Steve nods, his eyes not betraying anything, and he drops his hand from Tony’s face before he takes the few steps and opens the drawer. “That’s a lot of pill bottles,” he says without judgement.
“God, you’re annoyingly cheerful sometimes,” Natasha says, but Steve can see the slight upturn of her mouth.
It’s not that Steve doesn’t want to see Peggy, he does. He really does. He wants to hear her tell stories from the life she got to live, he wants to listen to her talk about all she’s seen in the decades Steve missed, and he really wants to know what she can tell him about Tony as a kid.
Tony watches as Sam grabs the scrap of paper and walks away towards a back room. Hoping he’s not recognised, Tony hunches his shoulders and takes a seat by the wall. The art all over the walls gives the shop a cosy feeling, despite the sterile smell, and Tony’s also comforted by the fact Sam took the time to reassure him. He’s staring at an animal flash sheet when Sam comes back, accompanied by a tall blonde man Tony assumes must be Steve.
Steve hadn’t even noticed the sweater Tony’s wearing, and he takes a step back to fully take it in. Tony’s sweater is bright red with a snowman that has a knitted nose sticking out, and, like Steve’s, there’s lights draped all over the snowman, but Tony’s sweater has the addition of what looks like glitter sewn into the snowman’s fluff.
“No,” Tony interrupts. “Sorry. Ugh. Ignore me until I’ve had a gallon of coffee.” He stares up at the ceiling, contemplating what lies ahead for him. “Fuck, I hate this,” he says eventually. “Standing in front of cameras, talking about the Stark legacy as if I haven’t been actively trying to dismantle that legacy since you helped me find out what Obie was doing.”
“But you were adorable,” Tony protests. “I’ve seen the pictures, you might’ve been small, but you—I would’ve dated you.”
“I would’ve let myself ignore it while I drank and snorted my way through life,” Tony says. “You’re giving me too much credit.”
“Wow,” Tony says, pushing himself up and looking at Steve. “And here I thought I’d be the one with all the commitment fears.”
“It’s okay,” Tony interrupts. “You’re not a bother. Pepper used to—I mean she used to be the one telling me to take care of myself, and now she’s gone I—well I didn’t expect anyone to pick up where she left off. JARVIS tries but there’s only so much he can do.”
Tony pushes up and kisses Steve’s cheek. “You’d better come in when I call you, don’t make me look like a liar to Peg.”
“I’m sure you do,” Tony says. “Steve, she—I think she just wants to know you’re okay. That you’ll be okay.”
“Tony, I love you,” Steve says, drawing him down until he can kiss him. “And anyway, Bruce said it would wear off in 24 hours, that’s what I was going to tell you before—”
“Yeah,” Steve says, rubbing a hand over his face. “I hate this. Pierce is running Hydra, at least this branch of it. Rumlow, probably the whole Strike Team is Hydra. Sitwell too. The only people I’m sure aren’t Hydra are in this building. And Thor.”
By the time there’s a tentative knock at the door, Tony’s changed into jeans and a nicer shirt than he wore for Mrs Davies, and he steadies himself before walking over to the door. Tony opens it to find Steve standing there with a bunch of sunflowers in his hands, jeans clinging to his thighs, a soft looking henley stretched over his shoulders, and all Tony wants to do is jump him.
“Don’t do that,” Steve says, squeezing Tony’s shoulder lightly before dropping his hand. “Don’t act like we’re not friends. You need to sleep, Tony, whatever work it is can wait.”
Tony follows Steve through the swing doors at hip height and through the work area to the back room he noticed earlier. Sitting down on a stool, Steve clasps his hands together and looks at Tony. “If it’s not your dick, what is it you want to show me?”
“Fuck,” Tony gasps in Steve’s ear. “I’m gonna have to take up yoga if we’re going to be doing that on a regular basis.”
“No,” Tony says, shaking his head. “No, we don’t have to start there, in fact we can start anywhere else but there.”
“In a bad way?” Steve asks, taking his hand out of Tony’s pants and wrinkling his nose at the come on his fingers.
“Can’t,” Tony says as he crouches down and picks up a car seat with a baby in it. “Unless you want the really tiny baby.”
“There’s a jug in the cupboard to your left,” JARVIS says. “And may I say it’s good to see you again, Lieutenant Rogers.”
Steve drives into Tony’s body again and again, almost losing himself in his own need to come, in his need to claim this version of Tony’s body for his own. He can’t take his eyes off Tony, memorising every detail of him as he’s like this, not wanting to ever forget what it was like to fuck Tony at this age. Then, he catches a familiar look on Tony’s face, and Tony’s coming, shooting all over himself without a hand anywhere near his cock.
Steve laughs before he pours himself some coffee into a mug and sips it, enjoying the warmth of the liquid and the comfortable quiet lingering between him and Tony. Finishing it, he drops the mug in the sink before he checks his phone. “Gotta go,” Steve says. “I’ll let you know if there’s anything weird.” He hesitates as he passes Tony by, barely resisting running his hands over Tony’s rumpled hair before heading out of the kitchen.
“I’m going to, uh. Get these in water,” Tony says, turning on his heel and walking into the kitchen. Running the water, he rubs a hand over his face before he fills the jug. Setting it down on the table, he unwraps the flowers and methodically trims the ends, placing them one by one in the jug. Taking even breaths, Tony pulls on all he learnt in therapy and concentrates on the task in front of him, being present in the moment even with the emotions that threaten to overwhelm him.
The quinjet lands on the East Meadow, and Steve hops out, the rest of the team close behind him. SHIELD personnel are already there evacuating civilians, and Steve almost chokes on the smoke from the burning trees.
Tony leans in for another kiss, the play of Steve’s lips against his making a part of him that’s been near dead since Afghanistan light up, and he can’t stop the sigh that slips out of his mouth when he pulls away. Sliding off the couch, Tony situates himself between Steve’s legs and looks up at Steve, enjoying the slight widening of Steve’s eyes before his face settles into something more knowing. Tony pushes up on his knees, thankful for the thick rug beneath him, and runs his hands up Steve’s thighs, eyes lighting up when he sees the substantial bulge in Steve’s jeans.
“Steve,” Tony yells, a blast hitting Bucky’s metal arm. “Don’t you goddamn dare.” A second blast hits the arm at the joint, and Bucky stumbles, turning his gaze on Tony, and Steve’s blood runs cold.
“Yeah,” Tony says, meeting Steve’s eyes, the frustration at not being able to touch Steve evident in the way his muscles in his arms bunch as he arches his body. “Yeah, okay.”
“Tickets home, that I made him accept because I roped Mama Rhodes into it,” Tony says with a smile. “He let me join him and ended up being annoyed that his mom fed me his favourite mac and cheese first.”
If Steve wasn’t turned on before that speech, he sure as hell is now. “Maybe you should be the one giving inspirational speeches,” he finally manages to say.
“That’s Mr Rogers-Stark, thank you very much,” Steve says, winking at Tony before he starts the machine and gets to work.
Tony grins, getting off the stool and walking over. “Come on,” he says, tapping Steve’s legs. “Let me sit down, you couch hog.”
“No,” Tony says. “I mean. It’s your choice, and given that I once hid I was dying from everyone, I don’t think I’m the person to say when to spill your secrets.”
“Yes Captain,” JARVIS says. “All but Mr Banner will meet you aboard the quinjet. And if I may, there is food ready in the communal kitchen you can eat on the way.”
There’s quiet over the comms and then Natasha speaks again. “Come back up, something weird’s going on.”
“Jesus, Tony,” Steve says quietly. “If you weren’t freshly tattooed I’d fuck you through this couch tonight.”
“Nothing, I just—” Tony breaks off and shakes his head, offering Steve an easy smile. “Sure. That’s probably on FRIDAY’s list somewhere anyway.”
Steve swallows and pulls Tony even closer to him. “You too,” he says. “I—you too.” Steve can’t quite say the words back yet, even though he feels it every second he’s with Tony. The words get stuck in his throat whenever he tries, and part of him feels terribly guilty for that, but when he finally says it, he wants to mean it with every fibre of his being. “I can’t—” Steve buries his face against Tony’s hair. “Sorry.”
Steve takes this in around a mouthful of pita. “So,” he says after swallowing. “If we can rescue him then—”
“Is this—I mean—” Tony shifts onto his side and props his head up on his hand as he tries to find the words. “I didn’t think you liked me.”
Steve waits until Natasha’s eaten half of her gyro before he starts in again. “What were you going to say, before? About the Winter Soldier.”
Tony’s eyes narrow as he examines Steve and Steve barely resists squirming under the scrutiny. “Yeah,” Tony says eventually. “I think it’s this way.”
Tony’s so fucking small underneath him, and Steve can’t stop his brain from focusing on it. It’s not like he’s ever been as built as Steve, but between boxing and piloting the Iron Man suit he’d been all corded muscles, lean strength that Steve had always taken the time to appreciate. Tony like this, though, is softer. Delicate, in a way, even though Steve knows Tony would probably hit him for thinking it, and it’s—.
“And people thought I’d be the bad influence on you,” Tony says, running his hand over his hair. He winces when he touches what feels like dried vomit, and quickly drops his hand to his lap. “I don’t—I thought you’d leave,” Tony says quietly, looking down at his hands, seeing the cuts and bruises on them. “I’m a mess, Steve.”
