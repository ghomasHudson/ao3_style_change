The genius stopped for a second, running a hand through his hair. He looked wild. And tired. The inventor had bags under his eyes.

“Hey, Barnes... No. No no no.”
“You can’t talk about it. You’re going to get fired. Or worse. Please, you have to let them do it, it’s better this way. This way we can still care for the children. If we get replaced, they will put people like Ward in our place. This is why you cannot say a word, and you cannot play hero. You are not a hero. Understood ?”
Steve, who had succeeded at dodging everything even with his low energy, started tiring.  His limbs felt heavy, and his movements were getting slower and clumsier.
Someone – a man, he sounded like Clint – outside the door screamed and Steve heard them running towards his room.
“Brother of Winter ? What's wrong ?” Thor tried to whisper, but he was never good at being quiet, and the man winced.
-Zeyra
Right ?
This chapter used to be named "Final Warning" but someone told me it was cliché and I agreed (that someone is Every_Fandom_Trash)
--------------------------------------------
And to all my regular commenters, I love you all so much, and can't wait for your comment ! I'm so excited to read what you thought of this chapter !!! <3<3<3<3<3<3
“Maybe I would have been enough, before… Before all this.”
Without a word, Stark stood up and left, stopping in front of Steve to glare at him for a few seconds.
The caretaker didn’t hear Thor talk even though he knew he was right behind him, but maybe the kid knew that this would do no good to his baby brother at the moment.
“Brother of Iron.”
‘Act’ Bruce’s voice sounded in Steve’s head as the blond stared out the window.
Tony, who had been staring at the shattered cup and spilled coffee until now, since he did not want to see Clint's concerned look, because as long as you don't see it it might not exist, quantum logic and all that, lifted his head and inspected the room.
Shouldn't Bucky be here, holding his hand ?
“I believe Captain Rogers is already on the battlefield, sir.”
He felt the sun on his skin, and for a moment he thought he in his Brooklyn appartment, in the 40s. Then he moved, and his improved senses picked up on the particular sound of the metal arm.
Steve watched Stark melt and decided that he really didn’t want to wake up right now.
Bucky frowned, trying to hold back his laugh as he assessed the situation. They had indeed been crowned.
“Hey” He said, because he needed to say something before it got awkward, but he didn't know what to say.
A love that nobody could destroy
The Howard look alike man stared at him with his big chocolate brown eyes, and asked :
_Written by Wolves, To Tell You the Truth
Steve stood up and left, ignoring his empty stomach and spinning head.
That night, Tony sat at his bar, drinking a glass of whisky, when JARVIS spoke up, nervous.
Clint was about to keep going when Tony entered the room. The archer murmured under his breath in a dark tone : “Go away. Now.”
Blue eyes settled on him and widened in surprise.
Oh wanna be jealous of me ? I have those english orals to prepare for bac, coz I'm french and all, and I have four orals to do, and one of the notions is Myths and Heroes. I looked at it and I went "MARVEL." so now I am taking a break just to publish this chapter but then I go back to explaining how the marvel cinematic universe is a reflection of how our society is now. I am going to have so much fun doing this... Except the first part of the oral is about superman. And superman traumatized me with that woman who turned into a killer robot in one of those old movies. I was too young to see that ! Godamnit, parents !
“Coulson ?” Repeated Bruce. “He is alive ?”
Steve wanted to open his eyes, help, he sensed that something was wrong, so very wrong, in the way the Asset's grip around him tightenned, and his legs left the ground. The former Hydra assassin was extremely tense, and Steve felt his heart start to race.
The smell of blood was overwhelming. There was a huge puddle of the crimson liquid on the floor, and Steve lied against the wall opposite to the door, soaking in it.
-------
The robots were shooting at them, and the Asset's metal hand left him for a moment. The soldier shot twice and Steve heard several metal bodies falling.
Bruce didn’t answer, and Clint looked at his phone. “Yup, she just sent a text, she’ll be there in less than an hour ! When do we start making cookies by the way ? Because now they sure as hell won’t be ready for when Natasha arrives… Maybe we can wait for her to get here and bake them with her, they’ll taste even better !”
“That’s exactly what he did.” Stated  a voice that sounded weirdly familiar to Steve.
A crimson filter fell over his eyes, altering his vision of reality, and clouding his thoughts.
There was a short silence while Tony focused on blowing up a dozen of robots.
“Wherever Stark is right now. I need to talk to him.”
“Come on Stark, are you afraid of losing ?” Had asked Barnes, and Tony could see the fear of rejection behind the grey eyes.
“Yes.” Replied the inventor.
“NO ! Don't touch him !” Exclaimed Bruce and he crouched next to Steve, examining the supersoldier. “You might make it worse if you do. Thor. Don't touch him.” He insisted when the god looked at him with defiance and tears in his eyes.
Now, a comment, kudos, bookmark, whatever to make me know you exist and you want me to keep going, is very much appreciated, really, it makes me smile one of those dumb smiles that won't go off your face no matter how hard you try ^^"
“Then why are you afraid ?”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEhCHVXm-Sc
Because my friend and I are currently doing a project together. It's a Clint centric fic, full of angsty hurt/comfort. I give the ideas and plot, and she writes it. It is amazing guys. You are all going to love it if you read it.
It took only a second for the super spy to slip her mask back on.
“Who are you ?” He asked in a soft voice, feeling like this man was terrified and ready to flee the room at any moment. And that wouldn't do because Bucky needed answers.
“Winter Soldier.” Stated JARVIS.
“To put me in jail ?” Asked Thor in a small teary voice.
Thor shrugged.
“Yes, Ste-Bruce…” Replied the inventor in a fake annoyed tone.
These past few months have been CRAZY on me in my defense....
A picture of Bucky, in his soldier uniform, beaming at him and joking with him danced in front of Steve’s eyes.
So that was it. Steve found out and he was worried Tony would hit on his best friend. Or were they more ?
That's the first thing Steve noticed. He felt cold. The room he was in was freezing.
During that month, some things changed, and it almost looked like something disappeared during that time. Tony's world was slowly losing its colors.
“What ??”
“Doctor Banner wishes you would join him for breakfast.”
“What ?” Bucky was so confused.
“I'm going to suit up and get the Winter Soldier out.” He called to Tony, who was already on his way to the workshop.
The boy faced the man again. If he was with the police, he should answer his questions, that’s how it happened in the movies.
----------
Tony sat on one of his table in his workshop, arms crossed and brow furrowed. He was worried, Steve could see it. Gently, the super soldier took the inventor in his arms and pressed a kiss on his neck. “I love you, Tony. Please. Bucky is important to me.”
“Steve woke up.”
“Steve ! Tony Stark is at the door !!”
It was a red and gold metal box Tony had made as a young child, to try and keep his most precious creations away from the wrath of his father.
“I don't care, Tony. I don't want you near him.” Growled Bruce. “Or him” He added, pointed at the Winter Soldier, whose stare instantly focused on them, and... Was that fear Tony saw in his eyes ?
And then said secret arrives at the tower, and is found by Clint. The secret asks "Where's my mommy ?"
And everytime Bucky would reply : “So you think Stark doesn't blame me ?”
---------
Bruce didn't even startle.
The old times.
“Are you sure you're just a robot and not a person ?” Asked Bucky suspiciously.
Now able to see more than shapeless colors again, he saw the man standing in the doorway.
Behind them, Thor silently turned away and went back to the kitchen. It seemed he had surprised a conversation not meant for his ears.
The soldier suddenly remembered Bruce's words.
“I'm not his..” Protested Bucky just as the elevator stopped.
Bucky resumed cutting the vegetables. He had decided to prepare something with rice, chicken, and some vegetables for Tony, he really hoped the genius would like it.
------------------------------------------------------------
I am slowly preparing Loki's arrival. And I'm wondering... Do I do it the funny way, or the dramatic way ? Or both ? What do you all think ? Don't forget to comment, it's the comments that keep me going you know !
Bucky woke up alone.
Loki was quietly rereading one of the few books of the Orphanage when someone knocked on the door.
He caught a glimpse of a metal arm before his vision blurred one more time, and then faded to black as he vaguely felt himself fall to the ground.
Steve opened his eyes. The light blinded him and hurt him for a few seconds, but he kept them open. He didn't really know why, but hurting himself felt good, in a twisted way.
They watched something about a man on a 'secret' mission with the maturity of a ten years old destroy eveverything all the time and give his name to everyone he met. Talk about undercover.
“I’ll answer your questions mister policeman.” He told the policeman very seriously.
Howard sneered at them.
“Because I loved your father. It was always him. Never you. I never loved you, Tony.”
A plate shattered on the wall. Maria startled, but kept her eyes on her food.
Thor ran into Bucky's room, panicked. He had heard the man's scream and hadn't hesitated for a second before bolting towards the supersoldier's room.
“Brother of Winter, I did not know you enjoyed sunlight”
--------------------------------------------------------------
Bucky kept his face blank, deciding to hide the fact that he knew sign language for now. Deep down, he knew he was being sneaky, but he couldn't help it.
He sat on the empty chair by the bed.
“I don't know, Bucky. I don't know. But let's focus on the fact that you are, alright ? Plus, you got a new arm.”
It had been a month since Steve hit Tony. A month since Steve Rogers had stopped opening his mouth for something other than strategy or what was necessary. He gave short answers, and his voice stayed quiet. Ironman and Black Widow had taken the lead of the team, and no one had discussed it. Thor had been offered the post but the Prince had refused, saying that it would spoil his fun while in battle. A month since everyone on the team started being cold and distant with him. Well except for Clint. Clint was aggressive. The archer spit his venom on the supersoldier at any given occasion.
-------------------------
I just put "mama" by MCR on and now he's like "oh, what is that, I don't know that song" *gerard starts singing* *nicolas (my best friend) starts dancing*
He has Captain's preserum looks, but he's taller, and has Deadpool's personality. It's explosive combined to mine. Our whole school thinks we're crazy, and 50% ships us. The other half thinks he's gay. One half is right, and I'm not dating him. x)
He had already told them multiple times but all of the avengers needed to hear it again regularly. All of them except Natasha, who had just noted it somewhere and read it from time to time.
The blond punched him playfully and they laughed. It reminded Bucky of how they were before it all, and he should have felt pain, but all he could feel was hope.
“Right after the whole Winter Soldier thing. He was recruited by Coulson.”
The bots were getting closer.
Looking around him, he realized he was indeed in a hospital.
“You. The Target is not able to fight right now. The Target's energy levels are too low due to lack of sleep and food. Mission : protect. Target's status : too weak to fight. The Asset recommend for the Target to step inside and find shelter while the Asset fights any threat coming too close.”
Silence, in a huge, richly decorated dining room. Silence around the table made of noble wood. Silence except for the silverware hitting the plates full of expensive food. Silence except for the breathing of the three people sat around the table. One of them quiet and dangerous, another prudent and reserved, and one shaky, too weak and barely passing through red trembling lips.
“Nat ? Nat do you copy ?”
Clint ran to the edge of the building, trying to see past the damn pile of rubble. Robots were shooting at the supersoldiers, but the archer couldn't shoot at them, they were behind a building and neither Thor nor Ironman were in sight.
Tony shrugged.
Tony woke up alone.
They was a silence, and Bucky blushed harder, looking away this time.
“Steve. Please.” The scientist's voice was cold, though.
OMG MY COMPUTER WANTS ME TO KILL IT TONIGHT I CANT EVEN THIS IS THE HUNDRETH TIME I TRY TO POST THIS FUCKING CHAPTER AND NOW ITS THE INTERNET THAT'S NOT WORKING I HATE THIS COMPUTER THE ONLY THING YOU READERS CAN HATE ON IS MY COMPUTER AND IF YOU DO IT YOU WILL GET A FUCKING COOKIE BECAUSE I FUCKING HATE THIS FUCKING PIECE OF TRASH OF A COMPUTER.
Clint nodded as Natasha gave Steve a glass of water.
(See the end of the chapter for
I hate having so much work but at the same time I love my life because my english teacher (who is my favorite teacher) keeps teaching us about marvel (I don't learn much but it's the best classes I have ever had !!!! and he said he will cosplay as bucky barnes for next halloween. This actually got me nuts and I can't stop fangirling over it coz favorite teacher + fav character = death.
The man looked away awkwardly and mumbled something Bucky couldn't pick up.
Please comment and leave kudos, you don't know how much it means to me unless you're a writer yourself ^^
Were they mad at Steve or something ? But they couldn't possibly know about what he did to Tony, could they ?
“You used to listen more” Whispered Steve sadly.
Thor looked at the money left in the wallet. There was one more thing he had to buy. He went to a library and bought a book about science. Something about how stars are born. It looked cool and smart enough to be interesting. Bruce would like that.
“I am so sorry little sister. It is my fault. I am the worst brother ever.”
“Wake up.” Bucky ? No, the voice was too flat. It was the Winter Soldier.
Yeah, Tony would be alright. He had broke up with other people before. The genius would probably be sad for a few months, but eventually he would heal, the other avengers would help him, Rhodey would help him. Tony was going to be alright.
Steve looked away from his plate. He knew what was coming. “Yeah, Bruce ?”
Sometimes, Steve wondered if the genius loved Steve or Captain America, and if he wasn't just another trophy for Tony. However, he quickly dismissed the thought. It didn't matter anyway, he loved Tony. If the inventor only loved one side of him back, it was alright, it was already more than nothing.
“I don't want him near you either.” Stated Bucky matter of factly as he entered the room too. “Breakfast ?” He asked Clint, his tone hopeful.
The tone of the genius made the soldier stop, looking around for any potential threats. He found none. His grip on the blond supersoldier relaxed a little.
The two spies noticed him first. They walked towards him calmly, and their body language showed that they meant no harm.
He sat up and looked around him again, trying to wish his vision to stop blurring. His chest ached, and for a moment he thought it was only his unwelcomed emotions – he truy wished he couldn't feel anything anymore – but when he lifted his shirt just to be sure, he found a nasty burn, its circular form hinting that this was probably the result of being shot. Since he felt the same kind of pain on other parts of his bodies, he guessed he had been shot several times.
Tony heard something shatter in another room and he saw Loki put his hands over his ears and close his eyes tightly.
Bucky’s heart missed a beat, causing the monitor to beep louder for a second.
If he ever woke up.
“Steve, you know that’s not true, stop blaming yourself…”
“Apparently I ran into Bucky.” Replied Tony in a monotone voice. He was so tired.
“Nothing's wrong with my- oh you mean the black eye thing. Yeah, I got into a fight.”
PS : who do you find the cutest for now ? It doesn't have to be a kid, I find Tony pretty cute too even though I'm making myself melt when I write Thor and Hawkeye_girl just dies everytime Clint says or does something XD
Clint sobbed, and Natasha hugged him tighter. “They will, Clint. They're supersoldiers, they have the serum in their veins. They heal faster than we do.”
Firstly, I am so, so sorry (But you've got two shadows XD) for what you're about to read.
“Hey, Bucky, buddy, how are you doing ?” Tony tried to act casual, but even he could hear how wary he sounded. The Winter Soldier was a threat, it always had been.
“Right.”
The dark haired man was holding his head, an expression of suffering on his face.
Two weeks later, Tony had invented the first unbrainwashing device in history, and the Winter Soldier was dragged out of his cell to a cold, securised medical room.
Tony’s pained chocolate brown eyes.
“The bank ! I'm in the bank !” Clint felt his hands shake and looked at them. They were covered in blood. It was all it took for him to finally break. “Oh god Tony, Steve... Bucky... There's blood everywhere. Oh god.” He sobbed.  “help me !”
“Nothing you don’t want me to do” Replied the weak voice of the supersoldier.
“I don't know if they're going to survive the travel.” Announced Bruce after examining the supersoldiers.
And yes, right here, he could see all the raw fear melting into anger and violence. He knew that look. He sometimes saw it in the mirror, after a flashback, or a nightmare about the past.
And that was not Howard.
But i'm not sure yet. so it could be minutes later. what's sure is that bucky isn't awake yet. Oh I should... shit i got a problem right there i need bucky not awake but i also need bucky awake.
And then the voice of a long dead wise man : “You must promise me one thing. That you will stay who you are.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Clint snickered and walked towards the one armed kid to high five him.
This wasn’t happening. This was his sick mind playing him an equally sick trick.
“Steve…”
“Hello brother ! Are you feeling fine ?” Greeted the god.
It had started the day Thaddeus Ross had arrived at the orphanage. He had presented himself and then declared that he had heard about a smart boy being up for adoption here.
One the other side, there was Tony. His charismatic mask that hid a caring but scarred heart and a mind more brilliant than anyone could imagine. There was the man who dared show him his true self and trusted him more than he trusted anyone.
“Hi” Replied Tony.
The blond thief came running down the stairs. Tony crossed his arms, ready to look as mad as he could even though all the anger had left him a long time ago, if there ever was any.  The boy quickly noticed the man in the doorway, who was looking slightly angry, even if his eyes stated otherwise. The kid’s face turned blank and then guilty afraid and ashamed as he recognized the man.
The bowman smiled approvingly.  “You heard that JARVIS ? Take him to Shellhead.” The elevator started moving. “Oh and Bucky ? Call him Tony, he doesn't like to be called Stark by his friends.”
“I said okay.” Repeated Bucky, deadly serious.
His anxious mind provided the picture of Steve and Bucky, laying on the ground, their blood mixing with the dust to form a crimson mud puddle that surrounded them, growing way too quickly.
“Cap ? Lost your tongue ? Did it disappear with your valors ? Because, you know, you had everyone a little confused. You did say that you don't like bullies, right ?”
“You scared the hell out of me. Out of all of us. You hear ?”
Oh god, how much he missed the past. Steve used to come down to the workshop and draw, listening to Tony's eternal rant about science. The blond used to bring food and coffee, and Tony used to stop working for a few minutes just to join Steve on the couch and cuddle with him. Sometimes he ended up falling asleep. Sometimes he woke up in their bed, with strong arms wrapped around him.
Sitting on his left, between him and the door, a tall blond man was holding his hand, whispering softly about his childhood with someone called Loki, and smiling sadly from time to time.
“I believe there are killer robots destroying the city, Sergeant Barnes. I would advice you to stay safe and therefore not go outside.”
So, the angst was good ? You wanna kill me ?
Bucky put his chin on Thor's shoulder and returned the hug while observing the two spies, who were sharing glances.
Bruce's eyes widened in realization. “You don't think... No.” Everyone held their breath, in fear of a Code Green.
“Natasha Romanov, nice to meet you” Replied the woman, not making any move to come nearer.
Bucky takes back the crown of his own kingdom, the one no one should have ever taken from him : himself.
“What have you done, Steve ?” The question was asked in a soft voice, but it made strangled sobs shake Steve's frame.
“Hi, Clint”
Steve was curled up under his sheets. He didn't want to see the world outside, he didn't want to talk to anyone, not even Bucky. He was so full of shame, of self hatred.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Well use our first names too then, Buck” Bar-Clint replied. “JARVIS, put on mario kart, I wanna introduce Bucky to something useful.”
Then he put on his media smile and laughed.
Strong arms were restraining him, he felt trapped. What was happening, why was he trapped ? Did they get him again ? Did someone stop him before he killed Howard ?
“Steve ?” He called.
Bucky stared at him for a moment, searching for an argument, and then nodded slowly, a small smile in his lips. “I can't really deny that.”
The title of the chapter might seem weird, but it's meaningful. In this chapter, Bucky starts to gain back control over his life, with the help of Thor, Clint, and Natasha.
“What are you doing, old man ?”
Or maybe... No. Keep Calm (and lose your shit) seems like a great title x)
As soon as the door closed Clint had instantly jumped on Bucky’s bed, sitting near his chest.
Then he started running after the boy.
“I found you and our brother of winter in the corridor, you both were trapped in your pasts.” Explained Thor quietly, so he would not wake Bucky.
“Yes.”
I just wanna keep on loving you
He heard an explosion in the distance, and then all the metal sounds the robots produced stopped. He turned to the street, and even through his blurred vision he noticed all the bots dropping like dead flies.
“You couldn’t be awake for five minutes without crying out attention, hm ?” The doctor sneered. He removed Steve’s hand from his wound and started cleaning it, not bothering to tell Steve what he was doing.
Natasha nudged him with her foot, encouraging him to continue his idea.
“What's wrong, punk ?” Had asked Bucky, confused, at the same time as Tony had shot back : “This is my tower, if someone should get out, it's you.”
And then the world came crashing down.
Oh no ! Winter is paralyzed ! Oh no, HYDRA stole all your pokemons except pikachu ! What will Pikachu do now ? Oh what are you saying, go to the pikachu realm and seek help from his father ?  Okay sounds like a cool plan !
So, I uh had that idea of publishing the deleted scenes and a few bonus scenes. There is a deleted scene in chapter 5, two bonus scenes that I could write in this chapter, and several other bonus and deleted scenes in the other chapters, and I think I told you all about it but you must have forgotten because I didn't get your feedback : would you like that to happen ? Or should I focus on the story ?
'He needs us to be there' Added Natasha. 'Look, how relaxed he is now'
"Good Asset ?" The soldier asked in the same language.
“Was it Steve ?”
Why the hell did he think this was a good idea to call Pepper and rant about this problem ?
“You remind me of my brother.” Said Thor, out of the blue.
So ? Bucky making pancakes for Tony ? Steve being his sad and traumatized self ? Good ? Not good ? I love comments :D
This would have to do.
Here, if you want an extract :
Tony was startled, and for a moment he didn't know how to respond. No one ever looked at him long enough to notice anymore. Not even Pepper, or Rhodey. Or maybe no one wanted to notice, because then they'd have to take care of him, and he would become even more of a pain in their ass.
Natasha seemed to notice and she helped him sit, but her gestures were cold, nothing like they used to be.
So angsty. But also very very sad. I think I made myself cry while writing that chapter ? Cry inside, at least.
So Steve did what he did the best : he made a plan.
'If he gets his own place, we'll visit him often.'
“Who's the Target ?”
Bruce opened his mouth to protest but Steve kept going.
“I am Tony. Tell me, when are we ?”
But the genius wasn’t listening.
As I write this, there are 471 hits, 29 kudos, and 11 comments on this fanfic.  I can't even describe how happy I am to see this ! Thank you ! Thank you so much !
For Pepper and Rhodey... I see them as.. kind of gone, like Sam. They're living their life away from all the actions of the Avengers. (It's a lot of characters to write, you know, and I suck at writing so when there are too many characters I tend to forget the plot or make it too complicated for my weak writing skills)
------------------------------------------------------------
You should check it out, though don't worry, I repeat, my fic ends well. But this music video.. It's so heartbreaking ! I just love it. Sometimes I watch it on loop because the feels are so intense and I am so addicted to them that I can't. look. away. Oh, that'd make a good title for.. I don't know yet XD
The story about the snake ended, and the steps stopped.
“And how old are you ?”
The man nodded.
Steve whimpered. He was a monster. A fucking monster who should have stayed in the past, should have died in that plane.
Bucky startled. Thor. Why was he here ?
The sight of the inventor was enough to make Bucky's smirk turn into a wide smile. He was so happy to see him again, even after two days.
The genius turned around just in time to see a blond boy who looked like he was twelve running away.
The Asset tensed when the spy from the Red Room approached him. He knew she was very good, he had fought her before. She could hurt him really bad.
“We need to clean those cuts.” He stated, before reaching for a box underneath the bed.
Was Bucky alright ?!
“Winter is not the season of the sun. I came to talk to you, son of Barnes. I believe we should discuss last night's events.”
And he had heard it. Heard it all. It had made him blush madly at first, and then a smirk had grown on his face as his cheeks retrieved their normal color.
Bucky had been haunted by the cruel voices again, and the scream of terrified people. People he had killed.
“Loki would love you, I am sure of it, brother. He always dreamed of having a little brother to protect, even though he would never admit it.”
Only then Tony realized just how vulnerable he was being right now.
“So I will get my Bucky back ?” He asked, hopeful, still staring at Barnes through the one-sided glass.
*big sigh* Anyway you just got that long speech because I'm tired of the reviews saying Steve is an asshole who deserves to be left out in the cold, beaten up, punched by rhodey (i like that one tho coz it wouldn't hurt steve that bad just bring him back to earth), and other hurtful thing, and that's when you don't want him to just die. So okay, I get it, my story, but your opinion, and you can have that opinion okay, I respect it. It just makes me feel like you're not getting it, and also.. Why so unforgiving ? Why ? It hurts to see humans so cold and unready to even understand.  But once again, I get it. Keep telling me how much you hate and want him gone it's okay, I'll work on trying to get you to like him as the chapters go :D
“Hm, Has something happened that I don't know about ?”
“I know. He's.. He says he's sorry. I think he means it.”
As soon as they were alone, Steve ran to Bucky and hugged him tighly.
Clint and Natasha weren't paying much attention to the movie, though. Out of the corner of his eye, Bucky could see her signing with Clint. They used a sign language only taught to spies because it was discrete. If one wasn't looking for it, they wouldn't even notice it.
“No.” He answered in russian.
In a year from now, Tony would come to realize the impact this small sentence, pronounced by a stupid teen trying to get away, would have on his life.
“I said : we're in 2014, old man”
Pietro ran back to his sister, who looked confused. The man stayed for a moment to make sure he hadn’t raised any suspicions that could endanger the mission.
As they ran away towards the woods, they heard a second explosion. Wanda stopped running and turned to see.
Memories of the fight sounded in his head. The explosions. The Winter Soldier’s shouts, his demand for him to stay awake.
“IT'S TOO HOT !” he cried, holding onto the tube anyway, because he knew that if he broke it he would be banned from the workshop forever.
… Wait. Bucky Barnes was making pancakes ?!
“The Captain of America told me things about you. You have been forced to fight for your enemies. Soldier of Winter. Is that how they called you ?”
Steve had nodded, a painful feeling of helplessness overwhelming him. “Understood.”
So. About PTSD. Does anyone know anything about PTSD here ?? (don't raise your hand I can't see you)
Natasha's calm voice rose above the rest of the avengers'.
In the Stuckony order lol, I didn't mean it. Don't forget to comment, it makes me sad and unproductive when you don't :'(
“Your boyfriend is Captain America.” Continued Tony. It looked like the inventor's brain had shut down.
“Protecting Target. Hold on. Do not die.”
“I must learn about my friends' work !” Replied Thor, beaming at Clint and Bucky. Behind him, Natasha smirked and talked to Clint in sign language.
And still, he loved Steve.
“You didn't seem pleased to be called by his name”
you are everyone you hate
He didn’t know if he really wanted to go in now. If the caretaker learned that the boy had stolen something, he might write it on the kid’s file and then the boy would see his chances of getting adopted drop.
“Steve. Please.” The scientist's voice was cold, though.
“You can make your own decisions if you have an idea that might help us win faster, but you'll need to inform us.” The arched told the Asset. He then turned to the redhead. “Tasha, does he have an earpiece ?” She nodded. “Do you know what we're up against ?”
-------------------------------------------------------
When Steve finally poked his head out of the armor of sheets he had wrapped around himself to block out the world, there was no one in the room.
Now wide awake, Tony decided he needed to socialize. It was absolutely not because he seeked comfort from his team mates. His team would never take the time to comfort him, he had made it pretty clear that he didn't want them to. Really, he did not want them to hug him and put a hand on his shoulder and just make him feel they're here. No. Nope.
“JARVIS, how are our supersoldiers doing ?” Asked Tony while blasting robot after robot's head off.
Russian words. He could understand them. They said :
“JARVIS, scan.” Said Tony, voice trembling. He had taken off the faceplate and was kneeling next to the supersoldier's heads. His eyes were wide and full of fears.
“I don't want him near you.”
The mechanic started to panic.
Clint caved in within two seconds. And that was not normal. Tony needs at least one minute to manipulate Clint with his puppy eyes, and the inventor is very good at this art. All of this to say : Bucky's puppy eyes are a masterpiece.
During that month, Steve realized that he had to make a choice. He and Bucky had been dating for years before Bucky fell. And now Steve had finally found it in himself to fall inlove again, even though his love for Bucky never died. However loving two men had never been a problem before now, because when Steve thought Bucky was dead, he could love him as a memory, and move on slowly with Tony, letting the genius heal the scars of the past. Now ? He loved two men, and he had to choose which one he wanted, and quick, before Bucky woke up. If Bucky woke up, and Steve still hadn't made his choice, then Captain America would find himself dating two men at the same time, and he would lose both of his loves. He would lose everything.
“You can go now.”
He could feel the spy's eyes on him.
The heart monitor panicked and then went flat, emitting a long insufferable beep that felt awfully painful for Steve's aching head.
“I need weapons. SI guns aren’t that good, and this boy is a genius right ? He can improve them I am sure.”
------------
Tony shook his head and started again, staring at his own relfection in the mirror of his bathroom.
“Bucky. Bucky this is nonsense. You're in shock, look at you, you're shaking like a leaf. You don't know what you're saying. He doesn't know what he is saying, Tony.”
For the first time in what felt to him like an eternity, Bucky tried to struggle against his coma. Steve needed him. Steve. His Steve. His punk tried to kill himself.
“TARGET IS DOWN ! HELP IS REQUIRED !”
Tony jumped, dropping his coffee cup on the ground, causing it to shatter. The sound made memories of bombs and war and shrapnel tearing his insides appart play in front of his eyes.
Steve stared at the back of the bowman for a few seconds, throat tightenned, before getting up, head spinning and nausea rising, and going back to his floor.
Tears filled Bruce’s soft brown eyes.
He went back to bed.
“I like the guy, but Tony's not the same. It's like all that's left is an empty shell.”
There was a long silence.
“I’m sorry Bruce. Could you just, close the door and pretend you never saw ?” Asked Steve calmy.
“YOU !” Tony took a few steps back, dropping the bottle, letting it shatter on the floor. Steve forced himself to take a few steps forward. “YOU WERE ALWAYS THE PROBLEM ! I NEVER WANTED TO DATE YOU !”
Clint gave him a smile, wide and proud. “I know !”
IMPORTANT INFO : We just created a bloopers and bonus work for this fanfiction ! Go check it out if you wanna laugh or see the orphanvengers' faces !
“I thought I loved Bucky more. But I love them both just as much.” 'I want to die. I want to die. I want to die !' He wanted to add. But Natasha wouldn't care, she probably would tell him to go do it and release the world from the bully he had become.
(See the end of the chapter for
“JARVIS, you heard her.” Said Tony. He trusted the spy with his life. If she said the Winter Soldier was safe for now, he trusted her. The question was, how and when did she find out ?
“Nat.” He answered, and his voice was raw from crying.
Tony ran his greasy hands through his already wild hair.
Steve's plan was easy.
Hey guys I hope you enjoyed this creepy chapter ! I didn't want it to be so dark buuuut I am a very influencable person *looks at Zeyra*
“Steve.” She greeted.
Okay, I am now going to assume some people don't know that having PTSD means you can get violent. For not apparent reason. You just lose it, and it looks like no one can stop you. It does not happen to all who have PTSD, but it does happen, and it is a thing. A true thing. That Steve Rogers happens to have but hasn't been diagnosed with yet. Bucky and Tony also have PTSD (if you look at the tags wondering where the hell those were, I forgot to add them and will add them right after publishing this.)
“Do not finish that sentence.” Tony's tone was dangerous now. “I want each and everyone of you to take care of him and give him company. I don't care if you take turns. I don't want him to be alone.”
And then I will create a serie where Steve comes back. And Bucky and Tony forgive him, stuckony ending, but not necessarily happy, it'll depend how you look at it.
“Steve woke up and unplugged himself from the heart monitor. Clint thought he was dead and ran into the room. I don’t know what happened in there, I left them alone as there was no emergency.”
“No Katniss, it was Nat’s !”
“I don't think it would be a good idea, Tony. The soldier is a part of him now. He is not who Steve used to know. It's pointless to try to turn Bucky back into was he used to be.” Natasha said, squeezing Tony's shoulder in a comforting way.
“I missed you too punk.” Replied Bucky, voice thick with emotions.
The bowman smiled approvingly.  “You heard that JARVIS ? Take him to Shellhead.” The elevator started moving. “Oh and Bucky ? Call him Tony, he doesn't like to be called Stark by his friends.”
He had heard enough. He needed to get to his patient, now.
The Winter Soldier approached the Target. He assessed the Target's wellbeing and decided that the Target was barely able to fight and therefore shouldn't be out on the battlefield. Remembering Hawkeye's remark about sharing his ideas when it helps encouraged him to talk.
Bruce’s cold and severe tone.
Clint shot another robot. Those things were his least favorite villains. Fight killer bots always reminded him of Sokovia. He could still see the dead body of Pietro, lying there, right in front o f him, covered in bloody bullet wounds, unseeing eyes wide open.
And I meant
“No.. I mean, you. Tony Stark. I don't want to stay away from Tony Stark.” Bucky wanted to hide and allows himself to be shy, but he needed to do this. This was important.
“I wish Bucky would go away.” Sighed Bruce. “I like the guy, but Tony's not the same. It's like all that's left is an empty shell.”
He couldn’t hear anything but the Hulk’s growing growls and roars of pain, and his increasingly fast heartbeat.
'So I was right. Time to go before I do more damage.' Realized Bucky, before getting out.
The impact sent waves of pain through his body, and his vision went black for a second as he fell to the ground. He tried to get up, but couldn't.
It was a sunny sunday afternoon. Kids were playing in a snowy parc somewhere in a small town of Sokovia. Most of those kids were simply normal, laughing and running after each other and playing hide and seek. However anyone looking at this bunch of kids would notice one in particular.
(See the end of the chapter for
don't have the time for a rant. sorry. fucking computer, making me waste my precious time.
Steve struggled, trying to free his arm. “No, no leave me alone. I’m doing it for you, for everyone. It’s okay Bruce, don’t feel like you have to save me. You could just leave, close the door behind yourself, and pretend you never saw.. You..” Steve had to take a break. He was exhausted. “You wanted me to do this, I don’t understand.”
“Yup. Howard's my dad.”
'Shit' cursed Bucky mentally. He was about to open his mouth to answer, to explain, but that's the moment the Avengers alarm chose to go off.
During that month, Steve refused to step away from the one sidded glass of the medical room, where Bucky sat on a chair, under a weird machine he could not begin to understand, but he knew he could trust it to cure Bucky, because Tony made it.
“What if Bucky never wakes up, Nat ? What if Steve loses him ? What if we lose Steve too as a result ? Because I don’t think…” Bruce’s voice lowered to a whisper. “I don’t think Steve’s willing to survive without him.”
Another child walked down the stairs, and after a few seconds Steve heard Clint whisper something, but all he could make out was ‘Tony Stark’.
“PIETRO !” Panicked the little girl as another loud whistle made itself heard.
“I care deeply about him. He is almost as important as Loki to me.” Confessed the blond. “I don’t think I would take it well if he happened to die.” He added in a surprisingly low voice.
“Hi Bucky, hi soldier if you’re in here too. Just so you know, Loki isn’t what Thor says. Loki’s evil. He made me… He… He mind controls people like us. Makes us turn against our friends, and kill people on our side. He seems like a great guy yeah, but he’s the god of mischief, don’t forget that. Now I don’t know if you hear me, I hope you do, because that’d mean your mind is alive in there,...”
Bruce sighed. “Clint, you’re really like an excited puppy sometimes.”
The way back home from the parc was quite long and they were left on their own, but Pietro and Wanda didn’t mind. Their parents were way too busy to take them to town and even if they were just five years old, they understood that.
winteriron
“Tony”
Thor, who was searching for pop tarts, stopped for a second and turned to Bucky.
Pietro.
Sad blue eyes that had seen horrors most people couldn’t even imagine, more blood and tears that needed to fill an ocean, more smoke and embers than necessary to burn the whole world, revealed themselves to the room, diving into brown, intelligent but clouded by anger ones.
“And before you ask, yeah, I think I pretty much heard it all. Come out now d-Tony. I got something to tell you.” He said in a voice that almost sounded like he was assured.
Hi guys ! you know I'm not kidding when I say comments are motivation.. This is hard to write when you get 7 poor kudos and  only one comment from a friend.... It's like you readers don't even exist !
The first thing Bucky heard was a sigh. It wasn't a sigh of contentment, though. It was a tired, sorrowfull sigh. One of the ones only broken men knew how to make. His first thought was a confused desire of holding that man into his arms and comfort him. His second thought was about Steve. Was he alright ? That punk better have survived, or Bucky would him bring back from the dead just to kill him again. Slowly, Bucky opened his eyes, find himself staring at the ceiling of what seemed to be a strange hospital room. There was a weird machine hanging from the ceiling. Bucky hoped no one had made more experiments on him, the only thought of it making him shiver. That's only then that he registered that he felt no pain. Not even a headache... And... Didn't he lose his arm ? Without moving his head, he glanced at his left arm. It was made of metal. How cool. He didn't know doctors could do that.
“TARGET IS DOWN ! HELP IS REQUIRED !” The Winter Soldier screamed again, making Steve wince.
Okay so I know this chapter is short, and I'm sorry. I have a lot of work and it felt righ to stop the chapter there. It gives me more freedom about next chapter.
“And before you ask, yeah, I think I pretty much heard it all. Come out now d-Tony. I got something to tell you.”
He hadn't been able to sleep that night after fleeing Clint's floor silently. JARVIS had taken him there when he had asked where the others were, instead of answering him. Bucky had decided to step out of the elevator and go see what everyone was doing on one of the other's private floor.
“You call a man who leaves bruises on you, and breaks your ribs, a friend ?” Natasha's tone was icy, but somehow Tony knew it wasn't against him. Not totally.
“N-none. You're just upsetting me Steve... Why are you saying all this ? Is something wrong ?”
“Kill the robots.” The british voice spoke, and that's all the soldier needed to start moving. On his way, he grabbed an earpiece. He needed to be able to get orders if there was a change of plan.
Bucky's head hurt. He took a step back from the man in front of him, and he looked around him, searching for something, anything to ease the pain and make the voices leave. When he looked back at the man, he saw Howard Stark. The mess of words and sounds in his head got even louder then.
Once he was battle ready, he called the elevator and stepped inside. Natasha and the Winter Soldier were inside too. Clint knew it wasn't Bucky anymore because the soldier's face was blank, and his usually soft eyes were dull.
“I'm Clint. Clint Barton. So, what are you watching ?”
“Wherever Stark is right now. I need to talk to him.”
The kid was having fun with Tony’s money, buying a bunch of different books and toys and even… A few dresses and some perfume ? Well maybe he had a sister. Or weird tastes. The inventor wasn't judging though.
He wanted to run in, hug his friend, tell him everything, beg him to wake up, come back to him, apologize to him forever and more. But he knew he had no right to even lay his eyes on his motionless ex-lover, let alone speak to him, even though the man probably wouldn’t be able to hear him.
However he could see that a lot of robots had decided to focus on the Winter Soldier and Captain America.
And then the Soldier started running. The robots started shooting. Horror filled Steve as he finally realized what was happening. The Winter Soldier was taking him to safety, and was getting hit by every shot the robots sent at them. It was taking so long, and the Captain could feel Bucky's body shake against him with every blow. His enhanced hearing picked up on the sounds of the suit and the flesh burning and being torn appart, but every sounded was eventually drown out by the wild beating of his own heart.
“Yes you can” He grumbled. He heard the genius jump and a few things fell. That's when he realized he was very very anxious about the whole situation. And now it was too late.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The first slap left a sharp, stinging pain on the entire right side of his face. The second sent him on the ground, ears ringing. His father just kept going.
This was one of the worst points of the story, and this is about as violent as it's gonna get. I consider suicide more violent than sacrifice battle and murder by the way so everything's not over yet kids ^^
Upon hearing the last sentence, Tony looked Bucky in the eye for the first time.
“They request immediate medical assistance, sir, but they're going to live.” Announced the AI just as Thor came running, Bruce clode behind him. He was fully closed, they hadn't judged Hulk's presence necessary for this mission.
Steve started to sink as memories of better times, times when it was easier to exist, played in front of his eyes.
Okay so chapter 9's title : The Truth lies in the eyes
The redhead ignored him. “Yes, you can pair up with the target, soldier.”
“Is that really what you want, doll ?”
Steve frowned at the mention of Tony, and Bucky seemed to notice it.
“You said that out loud, Tone. Just in case you hadn't noticed.”
“By the way, Thor, do you know where are the others ?” Questionned Bucky.
Steve lifted his head to look Bruce in the eye for the first time since.. He could not remember it. He kept his head down at all times now.
Bucky had often heard people say that sometimes when someone is in a coma, they’re not really unconscious, and they can still hear. He had believed that those people where the same sort of people who believed in ghosts and aliens.
Their entire house was burning. The only home they had ever known. And their parents in it.
So during this summer I had the opportunity to write (if you go on my profile you'll understand what I'm talking about ^^') So the reason why this story hasn't been updated in so long is because I have struggled a lot with deciding what to do with chapter 18. So much that I have ENTIRE deleted scenes about what was supposed to happen but never will. I don't know if I'll ever publish them, they're crap. Well no they're not really but I don't like them so they're crap and I wanna burn them but you can't burn a google drive file. Well yes you could by printing it but yeah you know what I mean did you miss my rants ? I bet you didn't. xp
This should have been an easy plan.
“Yes, he survived.” Replied Natasha and Clint at the same time.
I hope to read your feedback soon ^^
Bucky wanted to smile at this. This Loki sounded like a great guy.
He opened his eyes to Clint's angry face.
“No, he can't come, he was sent undercover on a mission by SHIELD a few months ago. He still has at least a few weeks before he can come back.” Replied Clint.
“So was yours” Bucky shot back, a grin growing in his lips. He was enjoying this. The man in front of him was adorable, and this was easy. For a few seconds, he just felt like he had felt back in the 40s when he was flirting with a very oblivious Steve. And for a second, the inventor started returning his smile, before a look of realisation dawned on the genius' face.
“What is it Thor ?”
Thor smiled, proud of himself. “I’m the best big brother ever” He whispered.
“Target : Captain America. Mission : kill. No witnesses. Ready to finish the mission, waiting for orders.”
Tony glanced at the door. He wanted to run away. That was what Bucky made him feel. Bucky made him want to run away.
“I'm eating it. I'm eating it all.” Decided Tony, too excited about finally feeling the taste of one of his favorite things to care about the fact that he was being fed by the Bucky fucking Barnes.
His feet hit the ground, and he ran towards the safe place Bucky was running to. It was a deserted bank. Clint felt a burning pain in his shoulder, and understood that he had been hit. He kept running. He got there a few seconds before the soldiers, and when Winter arrived, he fell of the ground, letting Steve fall beside him.
His sixteen years old body was not able to handle so much kicks and punches, and so after a while, he welcomed the numbness of unconsciousness.
Steve had told him about the other members, and Bucky looked forward to finally meeting them. However the team had judged it better and safer to let Bucky adapt to the new century in peace, without the pressure of social integration, so they had left for Barton's farm.
All he could think of was 'Survive. Survive. Survive.' And he wasn't thinking that to himself, no. He was thinking that to the Winter Soldier, to Bucky.
“THAT WAS YOUR JOB STARK !”
“Hey, Tone, no need to be so jumpy, it's alright, it's just us” Soothed Clint, and judging by the bowman's voice, the guy didn't understand the concept of 'leave Tony Stark alone he doesn't want your comfort' that the genius has tried to teach them all since they met.
He knew that feeling.
Clint, Natasha, Bruce, and Thor sat in the bowman's living room.
----------------
“Oh so hum, Winter Soldier. What are you doing ? What's your plan ?”
Bucky frowned. “Wait... Am I allowed in those ?”
The Asset had three mission : fight with the Avengers, don't die, and keep the Target safe. He decided that keeping the Target safe was the most important one, and that would he have to make a choice, he would focus on this mission.
“I didn't see anything about it in the medias, and you don't drink that much anymore.”
“Bad.” Answered Steve, looking bored. Tony frowned, wondering what was wrong, but decided to ignore it.
Natasha glanced quickly at the Winter Soldier, wondering if Bucky was hearing this.
“What ?” Barton asked. Bucky was about to repeat what he just said when he felt a hand clap on his back, making the soldier in him flinch and prepare to fight. “Of course we're not afraid of you, Barnes ! Why would we ? We'd see it if it was the Winter Soldier in the room, and we would handle it. Tasha and I made plans to contain him if he ever came back, but really, since Tony made the tech that cured you, I don't think he will ever come back, and that was a LOT of talking help me out Nat I think I broke him.”
So yeah, studying superman brings back bad memories, but I'll do it. *puts on ridiculously brave face* Because I can't go to germany til I finish my homework, uh Peter ? ;)
-----------------------------
So here he was, standing in a busy street after having escaped the orphanage and walked for hours to get to the city center. He was waiting for… Oh ! This one was perfect !
And oh gosh, Brucie was pissed. Why was he so pissed ?
In a matter of seconds, he heard Ironman land behind him and someone hugged him. Natasha.
“No need to look at me like that. It won’t work. You need to wake up, Rogers. You are not alone in this world. Most people have it worse than you ever will. Stop complaining and drowning in self pity. You’re a weight, for all of the Avengers. It’s time you release that weight, because we all really miss the old times.”
Tony had sighed and smiled. "Anything for you, Cap"
“Maybe he knew and liked the person who did this to him, and he didn't want to hurt them.” the archer said in one breath.
“I… Uh. I perfectly know why I’m here !” Protested the adult.
“STOP CALLING ME DOLL AND GET OUT !” He roared as he turned around.
-------------
“Is she always like that ?” Asked Bucky to Clint, who chuckled but didn't answer.
Bucky closed his eyes so tight it hurt.
------------------------------------------------
Oh shit, Bucky ?! What ??
The blond clenched his fists, breaking his fork in the process.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I experienced a little in this chapter, losing Steve in his mind in a weird way. I'm not sure what I did, it just looks like the dreams I get sometimes. I have freaking weird dreams, if you ask I'll tell you some :D
‘Do something.” Bruce’s cold angry voice insisted.
/Sorry about that/ Whispered Winter. Bucky had grown more used to hearing the soldier's voice, but he wasn't used to hear so much regret in it.
That was not expected.
“JARVIS, investigate on my parents' death, and try to spot any link to the Winter Soldier.”
“I’m coming !” Retorted Loki, annoyed. Couldn’t this mystery knocker wait two seconds ? Seriously, he was ready to bet this was another of those stupid adults who never listen to what kids have to say.
‘there is no way I’m allowing you near him again’ Bruce’s voice shattered the warm memories, Bucky’s face faded into the dark, and the water went cold.
Steve's face suddenly lit up, but still he didn't even turn to look at his boyfriend.
Another, shorter man was there, facing the window. He had refused to sit. He was too worried and he needed to be able to move. He had been pacing in the room for the last two or three hours. Everyone at stopped counting when they realised the brown haired man wouldn’t stop anyway.
/Let me out. I have a mission./
“No Clint, do not add so many chocolate chips !”
He drank as much as he could. He didn't know one could feel so thirsty. Steve decided to ignore how good it felt to have Clint's hand on his, stabilizing his grip on the glass.
The elevator doors opened and Bucky walking into Tony's floor, gaping at the beauty of it. It was so much better than the guests rooms, and those were already awesome !
Bucky was on top of him, watching him silently. His eyes were narrowed on his face. He had noticed Steve's struggle, and judging by his expression, he thought it was his fault.
Anyway, enjoy the winteriron
Steve layed on the ground, surrounded by dozens and dozens of drawings. His blue eyes where opened but not aware of the world around him. He was somewhere else. It felt cold. Icy cold. He could not move. He could not do anything. No one could hear him. No one would ever save him. No one would ever find him. If anyone even cared to search.
“No one else would want to pair up with him anyway” Snickered Clint, earning a punch in the shoulder by Natasha. Looking behind him, he realized the supersoldier had heard him, but didn't seem surprised or even offended. Simply... Hurt.
When he was done, he only had a second to catch his breath before Winter called again.
“Does he have an earpiece ?”
“You can get out now.” He told Bucky.
Steve woke up to a silent room, and an empty hole in his chest.
GOING BACK TO THE HARDEST CHOICE !
-Zeyra
Of course it's also because Tony gets a hug. (I KNOW ! FINALLY !)
“Hey Bucky, buddy, I'm sorry about the other night and I bought you that amazing appartment not too far away from the Tower, and it's very comfortable I tested it my-.. No.”
Frozen. Trapped. Silently and internally screaming, all over again.
… She totally will do it because Tony has been hurt. Fuck.
Steve woke up alone.
Clint opened his mouth to answer but a dozen of robots attacked him. He fought them, stabbing the robots with explosive arrows and sidestepped to avoid the blows of the machines.
Natasha took a few steps towards Bucky, placing herself between him and Tony.
The third time Tony approached Bucky, Steve saw red.
Steve is not okay either.
And yeah I might have forgotten to tell you all... It's gonna be dark. Like really dark for real. But the ones who already read some of my stuff know that ^^
The Winter Soldier's eye widened the slightest bit at the approval : he did right. He wasn't going to get hurt. Maybe his mind wouldn't get wiped either ?
“Robots. Stark says they're almost the same as last time, but stronger.”
Natasha ordered the Winter Soldier to let Bucky out, and the soldier complied.
“Shit ! That’s why you all shouldn’t make me bake cookies ! I suck at cooking !”
Anyway, enjoy ! See you at the end (of the line).
“Who the hell is Bucky ?”
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hello. I'm dead inside. Too much orals to make too much, too much, too much. But at least I got to analyse Thor Ragnarok ! Yay ! So I said that Thor gets beat up by two women AND the hulk and basically loses all forms of dignity including his kingdom and in infinity war SPOILERS he loses his people too. And bro. Yeah I know too soon but Dan Howell triggered me yesterday with his comment to Phil. Dan or Phil, I don't remember, starts talking about Phil not looking dead inside or something like that and Dan stops, has that smiles that just TELLS YOU YOU ARE ABOUT TO GET TRIGGERED and asks in the sweetest fake sweet voice :  "Phil, how is Loki doing ?"... And that WAS TOO SOON OKAY ?! SPEAKING OF OKAY I'M NOT (i promise)
“Captain Rogers, I advice you eat now before I have to call for help” Said JARVIS.
The blond kept looking deep into his eyes, searching for a trick, a lie.
This chapter (and actually the entire story) has been originally inspired by this music video :
Bruce smiling softly up at him. Thor walking towards him for a hug after returning from Asgard. Clint jumping on his back and hugging him from behind before making a bad joke. Natasha noticing his faint limp and insisting to wrap his ankle even though it would already be healed the next day.
And then the door flew open to reveal a very angry looking supersoldier. Tony put his glass down, regretting intensely giving in to Bucky's puppy eyes that morning.
Natasha sighed heavily. She was tired too. No one had had much sleep since before the battle, three days ago.
SPEAKING OF MY FRIENDS every_fandom_trash and I are writing a clint whump (i think it's called like that) thingy. It's awesome. I gave the idea and she used her writing skills and I swear you're not holding your breath while you read you have a serious problem because I do not know of an angstier way of writing. It's beautifully painful x) I love it ! It's called (Don't) hold me. Prepare to see it pop up sometimes soon with the Natasha thing "Two can keep a secret" remember about that one ? Yeah it's coming, give me time.
“Goodbye, Bucky.” Had whispered the god of thunder softly before leaving. “Come back to us soon, brother.”
“The Winter Soldier is currently fighting his way towards Captain Rogers' location. However I do not believe it is intentional.”
“Sam joined SHIELD ? When ?” Questionned Bruce.
The Asset nodded. “Current mission : keep target safe. Target status : injured. Doctors are needed.”
--------------------------------------------------------
----------------
“We are waiting for you and the boy in 48 hours. Don’t be late.”
“What is my mission ?” Replied the assassin. Former assassin ? Time would tell.
“Code Winter ?” Repeated Thor while kneeling next to the supersoldier, who was staring at him with empty eyes.
“And what if they're from Brooklyn, and I don't know, named... Steve Rogers.”
“WHAT ? DO NOT BURN MY TOWER BARNES !” Exclaimed Tony dramatically, without thinking.
-Cigarettes After Sex, Keep On Loving You
He stepped through the open door.
PS : Chapter edited because too many people hate on Steve and that's not okay, he is human, guys.
“Call me Bucky” He told them.
So here he was, cooking in the communal kitchen again while all the others were god knows where.
--------------------------------------------
Oh and Bucky won't be "Steve's Bucky" when he wakes up. He will be... Someone else, well.. I don't know how to explain, chapter.. 5 I think ? Deals with that. And chapter 9 proves it too.
I like that title, didn't even mean to make it rhyme but yeah, that happened.  Short extract ? Short extract.
Tony pretended he didn't notice that it was a drawing of him, smiling.
“He’s coming right now.” He announced, holding onto Bucky’s hand with even more energy. “I truly hope you are waking up, Buck.” He murmured.
“Of course we are, jerk.” Grinned the super soldier.
A lot happened during the summer holydays... I got a boyfriend, he took me to many places and omg I never knew I was crazy enough to go to another freaking country with a man I had met less than two month before.
Bucky had agreed. The Winter Soldier seemed to be slowly gaining his own free will, and he would be less dangerous this way. He could even become an Avenger, if he behaved really well. Which Bucky still doubted. The guy was an assassin, trained to take lives, not to save them.
“Where is Howard ?” He asked instead of answering.
From you here next to me
“Steve.” Replied Bucky, grinning.
“Tony-”
“He's awake.” Continued the spy, ignoring Tony.
Clint is not okay.
On top of that, Bucky still hadn’t woken up, except from a change of heartbeat from time to time. The other Avengers still avoided Steve like the plague, but at least Clint had stopped being cruel. Steve wondered why, but he wasn’t about to look a gift horse in the mouth.
If only Bucky was there to comfort him. But he didn't deserve it after what he had done to Tony, and he hadn't seen the other supersoldier last night anyway. His lover had never come to bed. Bucky probably already knew.
“I am going to talk to Steve.” Stated Natasha, and no one argued.
“Truth is… Even if I spent the last two months trying to get him to socialize, to connect, to understand that I care about him… I don’t know if I can do it. He doesn’t seem to react to anything. He is either numb or full of pain and anger, and in both cases whatever I say just doesn’t seem to… Reach him at all.”
“Are you sure he is going to wake up ?”
Of all the choices that Steve had to make in his life, this was undeniably the hardest.
“Nothing much. And yes, the smell makes that pretty obvious, Clint.”
“Yes.”
Bucky took a few steps forward, and now there was only a table between the two men.
“The mission is fall asleep.” Natasha told him.
Steve frowned. He had theories, but he didn't want to torment Bucky. If the man had some time to adapt to the future before he started remembering the Winter Soldier, that was a gift.
OK so who hates me now ? If you want to kill me already get in line, you're not the only one XD
Steve didn't answer. He knew where this was going.
Meanwhile, Thor wasn't paying attention. His eyes were on Bucky's. The soldier was standing in the shadows, listening to their conversation, and he looked utterly destroyed as he stared back at the god, silently pleading him not to reveal his presence.
It was true, he was very anxious about meeting other people, especially people who knew about the Winter Soldier. He was terrified of finding fear and mistrust in their eyes.
But right now, the archer was clinging to the spy like she was his lifeboat.
“Guys.”
OH AND  I AM SO HAPPY THANK YOU ALL WE REACHED 1800 HITS AFTER ONLY SEVEN CHAPTERS (one chapter a day so a week) AND I WAS PLANNING FOR 200 hits/chapter and now I'm so motivated to end this story the way it deserves to be ended (aka as well as I can with a happy ending coz i could just kill them all ya know) SO I JUST MET YOU AND THIS IS CRAZY BUT KEEP READING ME MAYBE !
“I called to tell you to never get close to Bucky again. You triggered his flashback today. It's your fault. Always has been.”
-------------------
Tony's face grew surprised, hurt, and then defensive in half a second, and the mechanic took a step back, his eyes darkening.
“Bucky.” Said Steve, out of breath.
Steve gave him a short laugh.
And then two strong arms lifted him from the couch and wrapped him in a hug.
“Already ?” Chuckled Natasha, and WOW. That was way closer than where she had been before. Bucky stopped staring at Barton to locate the redhead, only to find her right behind the couch, smiling down at them.
There was a silence.
“You need to get yourself together, Steve. Manage your emotions.” With that, Bruce stood up and left the room.
"Goodbye.”
Tony was curled up against one wall of the corridor, shaking, eyes and cheeks wet with tears, and his breathing was jerky. He wasn't really there. Thor knew that look, he had seen it on way too many warriors : his brother of iron was stuck in terrible memories.
“Thor ? Ironman ? I need someone to get me to the supersoldiers.”
“I can't do this” Bucky heard Tony whisper.
PPS : I also had, since chapter 5, the idea of publishing a sort of bonus thingy where you get to read all the scene I deleted (as if they didn't happen), and where I will write scenes I didn't show (like, in chapter 11, a bucky&tony moment I totally ignored in order to maintain the angst), as well as ideas that could have been or rants to explain the characters. If it interests you, comment about it, and I'll be sure to publish it sooner.
Also, do not hope too much. Only Bruce is going to be a little nicer to Steve, and all this is sadly not going to last.
“What ? What mission ?”
so. I think I'll name chapter 17... hm.. Quicksilver ? no. too soon, too much feels, not enough pietro in the chap to do so. What about... STUPID FUCKING ROBOTS START WHY DIDNT YOU USE THAT RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING no. not that either, and clint, please don't yell. Oh yeah, that's a good idea. "Keep Calm" and then you add whatever. x)
“It is, Jarv’. I know it’s only the second best school and that dad wanted me to go to Harvard right now, and I know that I could, I know I’m a genius and everything, but I really just want to be around people my age for once in my life.” His voice was trembling with something that may have been fear, or anger, or pain. Or all of the above.
Steve opened his eyes and stared at the ceiling, not moving.
“I am not leaving one of my mindwounded brothers alone !” He boomed, making Bucky frown and move in his sleep.
Their mom was probably cooking diner as their father was cutting wood. The sun has jud set and even though the western part of the sky was still on fire, the children could see the brightest stars starting to appear.
The inventor  waited for a minute to be sure that the boy wasn’t trying to trick him, but he heard the sound of a door opening and closing, so no, that was where the thief lived. And that looked like a very big and very damaged home this kid has there. Parts of the roof were gone, and some windows were shattered. The shutters looked like they were white once, but now they were just grey, and sometimes they were missing.
“I’ll make him talk, don’t worry. How much do I owe you ?”
“Bucky,” Natasha sighed and waited for the soldier to look her in the eye. “This is about you. You need to know that you're free. You can get your own place and spend your days at the tower, or get your own place and just stay there all the time, or simply stay at the tower, and no one will judge your actions. You're free, Bucky.”
If someone had happened to be in the room with him at that moment, they would have noticed that there were drawings of two persons, always the same two men.
As always, Bucky went mysteriously unannounced by the AI. It made the grey eyed man smirk and mouth his thanks to the artificial intelligence. He really considered JARVIS a friend by now.
Loki would want some drawing stuff. He was always forced to draw and then erase on the same piece of paper to economise for when he’ll be better at drawing, because Steve couldn’t afford paying too much things outside of the necessities.
“Natasha, do not interrupt me, I am not done with you all !” Growled the inventor.
“Bucky, you think too loudly, I can't sleep” Mumbled a very cute looking and very sleepy Captain America next to him.
Hey ! It's not my fault if you love it when it gets angsty !
He had also grown used to JARVIS. He liked the AI, it was one of the things that made him feel like he was in a science-fiction novel, but in a good way. He asked as many questions as he could. Everytime he was alone in a room and felt confused about something, anything, he could ask the AI and it would answer. What was the most amazing was that it was almost as if the AI actually liked Bucky back.
“By the way, anyone knows why they broke up ? Is it because of Bucky ?”
But Steve didn't know what to say. Howard wasn't better than Tony, it was the other way around. It was obvious. So that's what he said.
Steve shook his head no, feeling his eyes watering. How fucking weak. Couldn't he stop crying for a minute ?! He wasn't the victim here ! Tony was. Bucky was.
Clint stared.
“I hate myself” He whimpered again, hugging his knees and shutting his eyes, whishing his existence to cease.
“Tony is nothing like his father” he growled.
Tony spit blood before replying, looking Steve right in the eye. “So was I.”
Bruce squinted his eyes at him, suspicious.
Wait.
Cold.
And it felt... Bucky sighed. Nice.
“Is he the one who hurt you ?”
“There is no other way” He murmured to himself, and his heart ached.
The AI was silent for a moment, and the Asset didn't move.
It was almost the same feeling he got when he thought of Steve, but with Steve, it wasn't  just dreams. It was memories, dozens of them, all of them sweet and warm and almost comforting, if he could forget the fact that they now belonged to a past he will never get to live again.
Thor, Bruce and Tony knew not to push and risk to anger the potentially very scary woman in front of them, but Clint Barton knows no such fear.
“I want to be a spy !” Boomed Thor, making Clint and Bucky jump. Natasha only raised an eyebrow.
“Yes you can” Grumbled someone outside the closed bathroom door.
--------------------------------------------
“... Bucky ? Can you hear me ?”
“O-Okay. That's good, I guess.” Decided Tony before focusing on his own mission : killing as much of those damn robots as possible. He couldn't stop worrying about Steve, though.
“Why would the man of iron let himself be injured ?”
“Why do you want me alive ?” Wondered Steve. He really seemed confused.
“No way. My brother of iron is not the kind of person to hold hatred in his heart, nor is he one to blame the innocent.”
Ok so chapter 14's title is (at least for now) : You are everyone you Hate
Tony walked around the street and found the official entry. On the wall next to the opened rusty portal, was written :” Shield Orphanage.”
A weird metal thing went through the wall Illuminated by the blinding light and landed on Wanda’s scarlet carpet.
Tony nodded and stood up, not even bothering to grab a gauntlet or any weapon on the way to Bucky's room. If the Winter Soldier woke up and killed him, it didn't really matter, no one would miss him. Not anymore.
“Yeah Tony ?”
“But you know he's not me, right ?” Asked Bucky. He really didn't want to be a sort of substitute.
“I will, uh, go work with Brucie then.” He said in a shaky voice.
He let out a scream of pain, and the god of thunder came running.
An hour later, the inventor was sat on a chair, staring at the melting ice, remembering grey concerned eyes and a quiet deep voice.
lie he told himself to make himself feel better about his choice, that was no one's buisness but his)
“Yes daddy !”
“You're a funny guy, Barnes. So, I wanted to see you to check on your metal arm, would it be ok for me to open it and see if everything is in place ? I promise it won't hurt. Well unless something's broken, then I can't promise anything. By the way do you like it ? It can feel temperature and touch and pain, because most people think feeling pain is a flaw, but it's actually an asset,”
So here he was, Tony Stark, behind the one-sidded glass, refusing to let his ex-boyfriend's BFF wake up alone.
“I can leave.” Offered the voice Tony had dreamt about the night before.
“Brother of Winter, are you okay ?” Thor questionned, concerned.
“He is not your mission anymore !” Growled Bucky out loud.
Steve and Tony had glared at each other for what felt like hours, completely ignoring a very confused Bucky who didn't know what to do.
“D-dad.”
Bucky frowned. He didn't want to leave the inventor alone, and it didn't look like anyone was spending time with him these days. They might be all worried about him, but he didn't see anyone making him food or coming to the workshop to check on him.
They all put themselves into motion, running towards their equipments and weapons as Jarvis briefed them on the situation.
And yes, Bucky calls Tony New Stark in his head, it'll pass in next chapter, but I found it funny and endearing somehow ^^
--------------------------------------------------------------------
“You can get out, now” Steve told Stark in a cold tone.
“I mean smarter than you, because apparently you can’t even tell when a child is a genius. I want to adopt that one.” Upon stating that Ross had showed steve a black and white picture of the little Bruce Banner and oh, smart like that, okay.
Bucky opened his mouth, closed it, looked away, and opened it again while studying the ground intently.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve felt his heart stop, and then, he felt nothing at all. Nothing but a both distant and intense pain.
“Hm no boy, stay here please, I have a few questions for you.” Called the man as the child was turning away.
-------------
He was currently walking as slowly as he could in a very busy street, so busy that no one even seemed to notice that Tony freaking Stark was right next to them.
Fuck, he had almost called him doll. But he couldn't help it, it was his way of well.. Show affection.
He closed his eyes, exhausted.
This was true. And if it was true then it meant that... That Steve was...
The inventor decided that it had been way too much time that he had been standing in the same room as his parents' killer and his ex-boyfriend, so he left, feeling the Soldier's eyes on him.
“Then let me put some ice on this eye”
Clint and Bucky, who were now eating, choked and looked at him. Barnes was blushing, and Tony looked at him in complete confusion and wonder, because oh gosh, what a cutie when he blushed and...
He swallowed and looked at Bruce, who seemed to enjoy his pancakes quite a lot. He had a bowl full of apple slices next to it, and when he noticed Steve looking, he pushed it closer to the blond. The soldier took a slice to be polite.
“NOOO !” Clint roared, jumping of the building and shooting an arrow to slow his fall.
However his logic told him that he had to. So he got dressed and went to the communal kitchen. Clint was making french toast.
“Do you want to stay with him ?” She asked, just so he knew that it was okay.
“My head” He whimpered. “There is a voice... The Winter Soldier. He talks to me. I want him GONE !” Bucky had roared the last word, in frustration and anger. A second later, he was moaning in pain and holding his head even harder.
So Steve and Bruce got closer again ? Good. Steve doesn’t deserve to be hated by the whole team like this. Not for so long. He probably understood his mistakes and felt sorry for them a long while ago.
Steve choked on his water. Why didn't Sam tell him ? And Coulson was alive ?!
“Hey stevie ! I have a good new and a bad new. Which one first ?”
More robots landed near them and started walking towards their location.
He jumped and stared at the bowman. “I… Yeah. He’s fine.”
“I want to go to Shield.”
The moment Clint said it, the moment his venom was spit and the poison was in Steve's blood, the archer regretted it. He couldn't control himself. He was a monster. He saw the supersoldier's eyes widen in shock before his injured face fell into a blank expression. He saw the faint light in the blue eyes dim and die. The archer stood there, watching, not even able to move.
----------
He stood up slowly and looked into the nearest mirror. He was going to have a phenomenal black eye. He carefully touched his ribs, and realized he was going to have to get Bruce to check on them without telling the other scientist how he got hurt. It's not like the others wouldn't notice the black eye, anyway. But he couldn't tell them it was the supersoldier. The blond was just doing what he thought was right. It was alright. Tony was alright. Steve just happened to love his best friend from the 40s more.
“Bucky ?”
The man nodded and turned away.
“No, no.” Steve paused, swallowing with difficulty. “You told me to fix it. I am.” He closed his eyes and breathed; not opening them again. “Fixing it.”
Bruce looked at the supersoldier’s face. His blue eyes were dull and dry, his mouth closed and resigned.
“WHAT ?” Tony exclaimed, startling everyone, who immediately demanded to know what was happening.
“Could I get some french toasts too please ?” The blond asked, trying to act casual.
However, he was apparently still too loud, because everyone in the room tensed, their eyes darkening in anger.
“Because I loved your father. It was always him. Never you. I never loved you, Tony.”
Suddenly someone talked into Winter's earpiece. They sounded like Clint. Why wasn't Steve hearing him in his own earpiece ? Uh. It must have broke during the impact.
OUCH MY FINGERS ACTUALLY HURT FROM ALL THE TYPING ! come on fingers ? You all are serious ?? ><" so fragile, fucking fingers.
It was truly breathtaking, to see Bucky like that. He looked like a male version of Snow White after she bit the apple. His face was completely free of any tension, as if he was peacefully dreaming of a place far away from their messy, oh so painful, reality.
He wasn’t high enough for the fall to kill him, he noted, before turning back to the rest of the room, searching for something, anything, that could help him cease to exist.
The someone behind the door knocked again.
'Before hurting Tony. That's when I last ate.'
Thor smiled at him, sitting next to him on the edge. Their legs were dangling in the void, and it reminded Bucky of all the times he and Steve had sat like that to speak about everything that went through their heads and hearts.
---------------------------------
The supersoldier wondered briefly where the other avengers were, but quickly figured they had decided not to crowd him.
“Stark. He probably hates me, actually.”
“Do you still love me ?”
Ironman was somewhere in the sky, he had teamed up with Thor and they were now exterminating as much of the flying bots as they could. Natasha and Clint were on the other side of the street, the former Red Room assassin fighting on the ground, the bowman on one of the highest buildings, shooting a rain of arrows around his partner, and never missing.
“What the hell Steve ?!” He roared, running to the man and putting his hands over the deepest cut.
“I never wanted you” The super soldier heard himself spit. “You're just a playboy who wanted to add Captain America on his list !”
Pancakes. How lovely. Steve tried to remember the heavenly taste of Bucky’s pancakes as he chewed on what, to him, had no taste at all.
The grey eyed man did the puppy eyes. And damn, he did it well.
Sometimes, after a battle, he would come in and tell him how it went.
“And now he's crying. You're so weak.”
“Target should not be out on the battlefied.” The Asset informed the Target.
“I am... What ?” He demanded.
And the Winter Soldier obeying the Avengers' orders ? How cool ? Sorry if you're offended that he's good in this fic or something, but I didn't want to bother with a wild Winter Soldier in the Tower when I'm trying to focus on feels, even tho it would have been very very angsty.
“Who are you, then  ?” Questionned Steve quietly, and Bucky didn't understand why it sounded like Steve feared the answer.
“Captain Rogers, I advice you do not fall asl-”
Thor meets Bucky and go all big brother on him. Bucky just wants to take care of Tony. Clint ships it.
Okay, that being said, what did you think ? Satisfying to watch him be miserable I guess. Natasha was cold, only wanting information, but she also doesn't forget Steve is her friend. She's just very, very mad at him, and it's going to last for a long moment.
“Jarvis. Come in.” He sighed.
Tony was trying to gain Bucky's trust. Tony wanted revenge.
“Captain Rogers.”
It will be focused on Stucky sorry for the Tony fans, he'll come back in chapter 6 ! ^^"
“That little guy from Brooklyn who was too dumb not to run away from a fight. I’m following him.”
Bruce stared at her like she had suddenly grown a second head.
“Yes, sir.”
Tony smirked. Finally, a good excuse to miss the meeting.
He paid for it and put it in his battered backpack. He wondered if there would be enough room in it to hold all the gifts he wanted to buy.
‘HULK OUT’ Demanded the monster inside of him. ‘HULK HELP.’
It was the calm before the storm.
“I think someone does blame me.” He murmured.
Anyway, the plot is, Natasha has a secret she is so ashamed of that she won't even tell Clint. A woman from the Red Room, Darya, arrives  and use the secret to blackmail Natasha into making the others think she is an old and trustworthy friend.
This boy, who didn’t seem to be older than five years old, had white hair, and ran faster than anyone else, making fun of the speed of the other children.
This is why Bucky was currently watching TV without being able to focus on it, on the communal floor, alone, waiting for the avengers to arrive. And that's how Clint and Natasha found him.
“No ! Don't sleep ! Stay awake Cap.” Pleaded Clint.
He got shot by one of the robots. He couldn't bring himself to be fast enough to dodge all the shots, and he was getting hit more and more. He fell on his knees, and stayed there for a few seconds, trying to will his vision to focus. He stood up again and looked around, wondering why none of the robots were hitting him anymore. Strangely enough, the robots seemed to die one after the other, Steve didn't even need to touch them.
“No. Go make your food on your own floor.” Came the icy answer.
Clint was heading to the kitchen on the communal floor to see if he could steal some of Bruce's food – the scientist's food was the best – when he saw Thor and Bucky sitting against a wall. They seemed to be leaning against each other. Clint smirked when he realized they were asleep, and silently left the corridor to go get a few things.
"Don't be afraid. We're not going to hurt you, unless you decide to become a bad guy again and to hurt innocent people. But you did good today." She said in russian.
“Hey stevie ! I have a good new and a bad new. Which one first ?”
“What is my mission ?” He spoke in russian again. He could speak english, but it felt wrong. English was Bucky's language, just like russian was the Winter Soldier's.
“Good boy. So what’s your name ?”
Wait. Doctors could definitely not do that, he would have known.
-------------------
I also got a lot of comments about how Steve was being a total jerk to Tony and how they hoped he wouldn't get away with it so easily. Do not worry, dear readers,(ialmostwrotedeadreadersandisn'tthatsotrueafterinfinitywar)
The soldier then refocused on the movie, but not for long.
He wanted to give a sign. Just a little sign that he was in there, he could hear them. Something clearer than a change of heart rate.
“Stop being childish. You need to eat. If you die on us Tony won't be happy.”
“Sir, I believe Steve Rogers is..”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bucky’s heartbeat stuttered. Steve tensed, grabbing his childhood friend’s hand. “Bucky ? Are you waking up ?”
Who the hell dared steal something from him, Tony Stark ?
Pietro barely knew how to read, but the letters were big and easy to decipher. ‘STARK’ and some other, smaller word, starting with an ‘I’ after.
Tony entered the room where Steve had lived for the past twenty days. All the super soldier did these days was stare at Bucky Barnes. Tony would have considered it creepy if he didn't know how inseparable those two used to be. Of course, he knew the relationship between him and Captain America would never be the same after Bucky's return, but he also knew that he and Steve loved each other, no matter what and through it all.
------------------------------------------------------------
‘YES ! YES I CAN HEAR YOU ! I WANT TO FUCKING WAKE UP ! LET ME WAKE UP !’
“No. Mission is protect.” Replied Winter.
He knew Ward would not hesitate before letting Bruce go.
Following an impulse, Steve had followed Ross quietly. Ward’s office door closed behind the man, and Steve had silently went to stand behind it, listening in.
“Master Anthony.”
Tony jumped. Not just anyone. Bucky. Oh shit. Shit shit shit.
“Hey, Bucky, buddy, how are you doing ?” Tony tried to act casual, but even he could hear how wary he sounded. The Winter Soldier was a threat, always had been.
Here is a very, very short extract so I don't spoil too much but you still get prepared for the violence of the feels. Civil War kind.
Steve hadn’t stayed longer, and had left as quietly as he could, before running to Phil.
And then he had heard them talking about bruises on Tony. He had felt a wave of protectiveness towards the man, and had to control himself in order not to run to tend to the other man's injuries right then.
Yeah I know that title sucks. I don't know, it just sounds so stupid.. But I can't think of any better title. Tomorow when you'll read it you're welcome to try and think of a better one :)
“What does he have that I don't ?” The inventor growled.
Clint sat down next to him on the couch and put his legs on his lap. Bucky tensed at the unexpected contact, but it felt nice, so he slowly relaxed.
“Steve !” He couldn't help the stranggled cry that escaped his mouth.
Oh. He must have had a blackout for a few seconds. He didn't even remember what had triggered the flood of memories.
Tony comes back next chapter yaaaay !
“Then why did you  ?” Asked Tony, and Steve hated how the inventor's voice was so small and stranggled. But what he hated even more, was the answer he was about to give him. It made him feel nauseous.
“How do you know that ? What are you doing ? What do you want from me ?”
“Hey, old man ! So what's wrong with your arm ?” Smiled Tony. But it looked fake and forced.
“Buck, are you ok with being here ? At the Tower I mean.”
Steve could not sleep. Tony had found out about the true reason why he had left him. He knew it was because of Bucky, and now the genius wanted to get his revenge, he wanted to hurt Bucky. Well Steve would not let him. He would defend Bucky until his last breath.
Now, Tony was going to hate Bucky even more. Steve needed to give him a real warning this time, since the first one hadn't been effective.
Howard Stark stood up. “You. Will. Not. Go. There.”
“Uh ? Yes, sorry. I was just thinking.”
And just thinking about it, Tony felt warmth in his chest and stomach, and his heart skipped a beat before going nuts as he remembered the moment of the dream where Bucky had kissed him.
A few months ago, Steve would have been offended at being ignored like that.
“JARVIS, who's speaking ?”
“Are you okay Stevie ?”
WARNING : I think that Cap not eating is considered anorexia ? Yep, he's captain self destructive right now.
And Tony ? I know the chapter wasn't focused on him, but what did you think ? About him still caring and worrying about Steve, and trying to deal with this new winter soldier ?
He turned his head to talk to the girl running after him. “Wanda ! Catch me if you can !” He was smiling with assurance, but when he saw his sister laughing face turn into a scared one, looking at something over his shoulder, he turned back to look where he was going, but too late.
Steve could see how hard Tony was trying to avoid the argument.
Someone had wanted to take care of him, and he had pushed them away. Nothing alarming, just the usual.
“Is he going to be alright soon ?” Replied the grey eyed man.
His voice was softer than what he had wanted it to be as he lied through his teeth, but he decided to ignore it.
It was a normal evening at the Shield Orphanage. Natasha and Clint were nowhere to be seen, but if you asked anyone they’d tell you that they’re probably practicing their spying skills, because that’s their favorite game. Pepper was in her room doing her homework and the additional work she had asked her teachers to give her, because she wanted to be the best. Bucky was watching Steve, the only adult of the orphanage, cook diner. Those two were truly inseparable, Bucky followed Steve everywhere he went, and the caretaker truly didn’t mind.
“I can do it myself”
“Ready to comply”
-So Far, Ólafur Arnalds
Steve is going to fix it. He's going to do it and it will fix his mess, or at least it will prevent him from messing up even more.
Tony Stark was curled up on his couch, eyes fixed on the big screen on one of the walls. The screen was split in two. One of them showed Bucky playing video games with two superspies, and on the other, Steve was drawing.
The sunlight on your face in the rearview
So, did you enjoy ? If so pleeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase write a comment and leave a kudos ! This isn't taking you much time but it is giving us so much more confidence and motivation to keep writing this story ! It is so important, and if you are an author yourself you know what I mean ^^
Steve had had to explain him who the Winter Soldier was, and the conversation had stopped when Bucky had ran to the bathroom to vomit.
This is after those two weird but kind of okay in the end days that Bucky decided to go see Tony and talk to him, maybe tell him about his growing feelings, or ask him out on a date. Or.. Something. He missed the genius. He'd find an excuse to spend time with him.
---------------------------
“No. No it's okay. Stay.” Tony told Bucky, not looking the soldier in the eye. “Steve's not here, it's okay.” He then mumbled under his breath, staring at the broken cup again.
The inventor stopped just long enough to nod at him and mumble two words : “Don't die.”
The first time Tony tried to reach out to Bucky, he had made sure Steve was out of the Tower and then he had made pancakes, before asking JARVIS to tell Bucky to come to the communal floor.
Tony was his favorite visitor. He wouldn’t do much, except sit by the window and work, muttering to himself as he did so.
“Hey Buck, catching up on all the popculture ?” Called Clint as he walked in the room.
Feel free to comment, if you're nice enough I'll leave clues, and if you're really really nice you'll get uuuh... Idk. a rant. about chapter 17.
“Tony Stark. I took the liberty to make you a better arm while you were sleeping. Oh, and it's not a joke. Welcome to the future.” The guy was smiling, but Bucky could see the concern behind his eyes.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
And I decided to give myself the night, to think about it.
Steve sat suddenly, taking in a deep breath, as if he had been drowning. But his breathing wouldn't calm down. It wouldn't. He was on the train, Bucky just fell, he was alone, how could he ever calm down, it was so cold, everything was so cold, everywhere, and he couldn't move, couldn't call for help. Couldn't breathe.
--------------------
He had dreamt about not being alone in his bed again. The thing is that this time, it was Steve that was telling him sweet nothing while cuddling him. It was Bucky.
Bucky stared at him for a moment, and then decided that his life was just crazy like that. So he was in the future, and Steve was still as young as he had been last time he saw him. What about that guy who looks like Howard ? Howard didn't seem like the kind of guy to want kids...
Bucky shook his head no.
Loki looked at him, pinched his lips and nodded, blinking a few times to chase the tears that had filled his eyes. He would be alright.
“The Asset.”
'Show him the crappiest one possible' she signed.
Tony and Clint throwing cookies at each other, the inventor hiding behind Steve and stealing a kiss from the blond as they all laughed.
No knowing what to do, the genius crouched and put a hand over the boy’s shoulder. It was the wrong thing to do apparently, because the kid instantly flinched and stepped back. As running steps could be heard coming their way.
Anyway. Remember how I said Steve dies ?
The hand didn’t move. He sighed. “No. Of course not. Why would I, of all people, make you wake up, uh ?”
Two days later, Bucky ran into Tony. Neither of them had been paying attention.
“Maybe go back to sleep. Maybe draw.” He continued.
Tony really shouldn’t be feeling bad for a boy who didn’t hesitate before stealing his wallet and phone.
I just think this is important that you know, people can make huuuuuge mistakes, and sometimes you don't understand. Sometimes the pain they cause, is not even close to the one they feel. I SAID SOMETIMES DONT YELL AT ME FOR BEING STEVE'S ADVOCATE SOMEONE HAS TO TAKE HIS SIDE (says the one yelling sorry)
“Sir is currently in his private quarters” Informed the AI.
“Brother of Iron, I believe there is smoke coming from the oven..”
From who I love
Oh and I have an announcement to make in the end notes, if you would be so kind and read them too... :)
“Target : Captain America. Mission : kill. No witnesses. Ready to finish the mission, waiting for orders.”
“Yes. Tony made it. I like this guy !”
Don't forget to comment and leave kudos and all that ! I really love the support you all show me guys ! Especially the ones who leave me a comment on each chapter, love you all :D
All Bucky could do was mentally scream as the Winter Soldier roared like a caged tiger.
“Well... I'm still trying to figure that out.” 'I am trying to remember'
During those two days, Natasha had approached and him and had asked him to let the Soldier out from time to time. She had claimed that she wished to speak to the guy, that the Asset was, indeed, an asset on the battlefield and that she wanted him to trust the Avengers. That it was important.
And I freaking struggled with it because omg wtf too many emotions to much stress I never at.. oh yeah.
Natasha didn't say anything for a few minutes.
It was Thor's turn to be surprised. “The others didn't tell you ? Well I guess that's better. They don't know him. They saw him while he was at his worst, and from what little informations I could gather, I think he had been tortured into submission by an entity far greater than all of us.” Bucky shivered.
His butler was watching him from the doorway. Sadness was clear as day on his face.
PS : I would like to thank you for the 170+ hits and the 9 subs though, you're awesome <3
“We're going to take turns. I'm not staying with him everyday” She warned.
Steve cried harder.
He could somehow hear Bruce's cold tone while reading the words.
“He was… But, well… You know how he is these days.”
“Steve ! Steve stay with me you hear me ? I am going to fucking punch you in the face if you die on me !” Clint wanted to cry. This was not fair. He couldn't do anything, he was helpless, they were dying, the robots would figure out their location in a matter of minute, he had three or four arrows left, he couldn't do it. He couldn't.
Tony had opened his mouth to start conversation, maybe ask Bucky if he needed anything, or if his metal arm felt alright, but at that same instant the door had slammed open, revealing Captain America, still sweaty from his morning run.
And yes, I decided that Bucky would take the thing about being in the future really well, fight me. The story does not focus on that anyway. I don't pretend to be writing something perfect, the characters are so much deeper than what I am writing, but I don't have the skills to do it like I should. Sorry.
------------------
A tidal wave of fear flooded him.
Tony blinked.
Clint started shouting in the earpiece.
/Me, don't be afraid. We're not with Hydra anymore. We can fight for whoever we want./
“After analysing your recent interaction with the team and their vital signs at the time of the interactions, I believe they feel anger towards you, Captain.” Replied the AI.
OH AND ! PLEASE READ THIS I got a comment talking about Steve/Howard... There is not Steve/Howard (Steward ? Howeve ? Stoward ?) It was just a lie that Steve told Tony to get the man to hate him. Didn't work, of course, but that's for another chapter..
Flashes of the past kept haunting him, dead memories full of warm sunshine and laugher, but also darker ones, and those were the only ones that felt real.
-Cigarettes After Sex, Sunsetz
Oh gosh. He hoped so.
Was it his fault ? Was it all his fault ? Was is because he returned ?
--------------------
“Howard ?” Repeated someone from behind him. “Howard's dead. Barnes, you're more than 70 years later, did you forget ?”
Then he remembered some bits and pieces of the battle.
“JARVIS. Did you deliberatly let him in ? Don't answer. I know you did. I should give you to the nearest university, you know that ?” He threatened.
Bucky opened his mouth, and closed it. He was still pressed against Thor and he felt protected, accepted even in his vulnerability. He felt like a little brother.
“Mario kart is not useful, Clint” Natasha argued, sighing. It sounded like it wasn't the first time she said that.
“Orders received.” Replied the Winter Soldier, but no one heard him.
The blond punched him playfully and they laughed. It reminded Bucky of how they were before it all, and he should have felt pain, but all he could feel was hope.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
'We won't.' Clint replied
“It is safe to be around my beloved brother, Clint.”
... So complicated. I hope you all get it, I'll think about it and sort it out later, though. You see I have a lot of exams starting from this week and until the 25th June. It's gonna be awful because I'm not even sure I'll pass, it's mostly sciencey stuff and I suck at sciencey things. Like, really. Why the L didn't I go in literature classes. I'm so dumb sometimes XD
“No ! Don't finish the mission ! New mission, protect the target !” Exclaimed Tony, his heart jumping in his chest.
Immediately the soldier closed his eyes, and started slowing his breathing. Thor settled next to the Winter Soldier, determined to watch over his friend, but his eyes were on Tony.
“Sorry punk.” Grinned Bucky, not sorry at all.
As Bruce ranted about not picking fights in bars, Tony realized how much he had, indeed, messed up. He wasn't sure exactly when he had done something wrong, but he must have, if Captain America himself was so angry at him. Surely, it was about Bucky, but the genius couldn't help it, he felt drawn to the quiet man. And it felt very much like... No.
“And now everyone is hurting you.” Replied the AI.
He hadn’t been surprised.
“Yeah, you told me that on the phone already.” Replied Bruce dryly. He was tired. Hulk growled again.
Steve did not speak again, for he was too weak to do so. He wanted to tell the AI that it's all he deserves for becoming everything he hates, but he was so tired. He wanted to sleep. He scratched at one of the burn marks on his body. His hand felt heavy. And he was sweating but he also felt so cold and he was shivering.
It was more like, these past few months, and they both knew it, but neither of them really wanted to acknowledge it. The redhead sat beside him on the couch, and put a gentle hand on his shoulder.
“No matter where they're from, right ?”
“I'm the king of flowers.” The soldier continued, very seriously.
“You okay, Stevie ? I'm sorry. I shouldn't have done that. Kissed you, I mean. Let's forget it, yeah ?” Bucky said while getting off of Steve.
The call ended.
The pain and guilt blooming in his chest were overwhelming.
“Hello, soldier” He greeted, not missing how Winter's eyes sparkled a little at the acknowledgement.
On one side, there was Bucky, his charming and overprotective personality, his sweet smiles and courage. There was the broken man from the past who needed him to help him get up and live again in a world that wasn't their own.
Thor sighed and evelopped the other man in a hug. Hopefully his brother of winter would feel better soon.
Was Bucky by his side ? Had it all been just a really bad dream ? Was he still that kid from Brooklyn ?
“Okay..”
The Winter Soldier seemed to circle around him, killing a maximum of robots becfore they got near him.
Next chap's title is : It's Okay (I hear voices, they're cruel), It's Okay.
How could they have come to this ? How could they do something so cruel to a member of their team ? Of their family ? All of this out of anger ?
“Brother of Winter ? Bucky ?” He asked first. He knew the man had a dark side, and that it was dangerous to ignore him to pay attention to Tony first. The god had to check if Bucky was himself.
Thirdly, I think it's not going to have any effect even if I beg you not to want to murder Steve. You're going to anyway, if you don't want it already.
when you're asleep or awake
That being said, you might have a good surprise tomorow if I get inspired tonight and write a lot, which have 60% chances of happening. It increases with the positive reviews I get because yes, honest compliments will get you anywhere you want with me, I know, I'm so weak.
The five of them made cookies together, and it was an amazing experience, at first, and then, inevitably, the kitchen apocalypse.
Somehow, while he slowly ran his hand through Bucky’s hair as memories of the 40s danced in his mind, the solution appeared to him, loud and clear.
----------------
Thor paused, seemingly lost in thoughts.
The Winter Soldier. Then, the Winter Soldier happened.
Hey everyone ! I love you all, I love you so, so much, I got so many hits and comments and kudos and it has barely been a week since I started publishing this story, but you all make me a little anxious, you know ^^"
The short extract is three extracts giving you an idea of how the next chapter will go :
“Tell me that it’s not Tony Stark’s wallet that you stole…” He whispered to the other blond kid.
“I love you, Bucky. You better wake up, jerk." He confessed, and left.
“I wish to see one of those spies movies !” Boomed Thor out of the blue.
But maybe he should just have made pancakes. A wave of anxiety and insecurities went through his chest. What if it was the pancakes that Tony enjoyed, and not Bucky's cooking ?!
The man was staring at him silently, confusion and mefiance still clear on his face.
“Why do you care ?” Replied Bruce, turning to Tony and looking him in the eye.
The scientist sighed.
“I do not wish to make you remember this, brother of winter. I just wanted to tell you that I understand, and I am here if you need me. I will not judge you for was they made you do. I don't think any of our friends will.”
“So you’re Tony Stark right ?”
He tensed, blushing furiously as he tried to break the embrace, but Bucky was holding onto him and didn't want to let go.
“Is there something on my face ?”
“W-what is it ?”
“I'm not the prince of flowers.” He said in a dark tone.
“Bucky, why were you listening to us ? Were you spying on us ?” Questionned Thor, but it wasn't accusation the man from the 40s heard in his voice, it was genuine curiosity.
So the plan is, write the fight agains the octopus, and somehow, a wild HYDRA appears ! Pikachu, go !
The treatment lasted a month.
The AI fell silent once again.
This chapter is very very long.
“BUCKY ! BUCKY COME BACK TO REALITY ! BUCKY IT'S ME IT'S STEVE !”
-----------------------------
“-eady to comply”
“Will he live ?” Asked Steve, his voice, weak and trembling, made a huge contrast with his blank exterior.
He stood up from the uncomfortable chair he had been sitting in for days, and walked to the glass, putting one hand on it and watching the doctors read the machine's screen, which was out of view. Now he had to break up with Tony, and make sure Tony believed Steve didn't love him anymore. But Steve was worried that if the genius discovered that he left him for Bucky, Tony would take it out on Barnes, who would once again be hated for something that wasn't his fault.
He had a black eye.
“Bruce ? Good choice. What do you want him for ?”
Wanda just kept sobbing, unable to stop, as Pietro eyes remained dry and empty of any emotion as he watched his childhood home burn, and his innocence with it.
The choc would have sent Tony to the ground if Bucky hadn't catched him.
Bruce looked at Natasha worriedly. She knew he had taken that in consideration, and she was lying to the archer. He didn't know if it was a good choice, because if one of them died during the trip to SHIELD medical, Clint would hate her.
Come on, don't be mad. Or hurt. Don't know what your reaction is lol. I know it doesn't seem like it, but it's like life : you never really know what's going to happen until it happens, and things often turn out more okay than you thought they'd do. ^^
It had been a month since Steve hit Tony.
So I was saying, this was a hard chapter to write and I almost wanted to split it but then I decided against it. I think it was important for all these scenes to be in the same chapter.
And then he remembered his theory.
“Come on Steve... You know that's not true ! I love you !” Came the broken answer from Tony.
Steve closed his eyes as it began.
“So, you're a Stark ?”
“Brother of Winter, I do not believe the cakes of pan are supposed to look like this.” Thor informed Bucky.
But everything had felt wrong about that man. Why want to adopt a boy just because he’s smart, without even meeting him ? Where did he get that picture anyway, it was a picture taken the day the boy had arrived at the orphanage, three months ago !
“Okay now I have to go check on Steve.” He said quickly. Too quickly.
Loki let go of him to say something he didn’t hear and Steve finally turned to the stranger but the words died in his throat and his mouth fell open.
“Listen Steve, I know it has only be two days of this new thing, but if you want us to give you another chance, you should stop drowning in self pity. Maybe do something to fix your mistakes, I don't know. Have you appologized yet ?”
Bruce looked at the broken man before him.
“I’m sorry it took so long for me to finally fix it” He apologized both to no one in particular and to the whole world.
“If you’re not disposed to help me, then I’ll talk to someone else.” The man had said, before walking past the caretaker and climbing the stairs, towards Grant Ward’s office.
'Oh god, he is afraid of me' Thought Steve, feeling his heart breaking painfully.
And then he left. Because there was no answer, except the one he couldn't give : Howard had nothing that Tony hasn't, and Tony had everything and more. Tony was perfect in his own way, Tony was one half of Steve's heart, Bucky being the other half. And Steve had just broke both Tony's and his own heart with his plan.
Bruce let the tears escape and roll on his cheek, not even bothering to wipe them.
-Hawkeye_girl
Right now, he was laying on his and Steve's bed, his flesh fingers running through the blond's hair slowly. Steve had fallen asleep shortly after he started doing that, so Bucky didn't stop, in fear of waking him up.
Because you are everyone you hate
His eyes dropped to his hands. The one that what once wet was now covered in dried blood.
And so, so alone.
Feel free to comment, I love you all still ! I mean I can't blame someone for being mad at someone who hurt Tony. I just hope you won't stay angry.
-----------------------------
Bucky didn't know why it had affected him so much, but it had, and he was terrified of the others finding out that he heard all that conversation. The soldier had kept looking Thor in the eyes as he had fled into the shadows, trying to get him to keep quiet, but he didn't know the god, he had no way to know if he could trust him.
‘Between life and death because of you’ Echoed the physicist’s voice once more.
Okay so all the feedback I got from the beginning of this story made me rethink some things. I was teared appart between continuing this fic, writing it till the end, and not caring about what you all think, and changing it all, or even deleting it. (Yes, I seriously considered deleting it)
Short extract for those who care (makes me sad to know most of you don't)
Steve sighed as Loki instantly clung onto him, hiding his face in his shirt. He hoped that one day the boy in his arms would learn that it was okay to cry in front of his big brother.
Steve had not understood why this man had chosen to work in an orphanage, because he clearly hated children. The blond had often been worried that the man would hit or even kill one of them.
“And you ? Why aren't you angry ? I hurt your creator.”
Oh and Déjà-Vu is a french expression, you english thieves (kidding, we stole words too sooo...) and I love the way you guys pronounce it !
Bucky looked at his left arm and smirked. He could always say that his arm hurt. He didn't want to cry wolf though.
Oh shit. He needed a plan, and quickly.
Don't worry I'm not forgetting the hardest choice it's barely an OS, at most a short multi chaptered  fic
She seemed to notice she was being watched, though, because he snapped back to reality and stared at Clint, who had called her name twice already.
Bucky turned back to the pan and stated in his usual quiet tone : “Shit. It's burning.”
And still Steve loved Tony. How could he cause pain to Tony like that ? How dared he ? How could he love two persons at the same time ? How could he hurt one of them so much, just for the sake of the other's safety ?
Have you noticed how the chapters keep getting longer and longer ? Yeah, me too. I don't know why I do that, but I'll end up published 10k words chapters if I don't stop XD
“Yes, but you call me brother all the time.”
Tony had been focused on his Starkpad, trying to think of a more effective way of building Clint's explosive arrows, and avoid anything that had to do with any supersoldier.
And just like that, all the remaining anger in Clint's chest flew away, leaving behind a huge void, the weight of guilt and regret, as well as a pain that was so unbearable it was hard to breathe.
“Look at me” He asked, voice strangled with barely contained sobs.
The world blurred and spinned around him, and he didn't lift his shield in time to avoid getting shot. He went flying against a wall, colliding with it abruptly.
“Yes. Are you okay, Tony ?” She replied, putting a hand on his cheek and another on his shoulder. She knew friendly touches from people he trusted comforted him.
Hi everyone, we're posting another chapter because well firstly we have one and secondly omg PLEASE read our story we are desperate for some feedback, please please please tell us what you think ! :'(
Bucky nodded. He felt like Thor was treating him like some sort of kid... But it wasn't really that. He could not find the word, but Thor was acting strangely. He was pretty sure Steve would have mentionned it if Thor had a big brother thing going on.
“I have a missiong for you” NO.
He was woken up by the avengers call. There was a bad guy in town. Again. It had been calm for the last few months. What was he hoping, peace never lasts.
“Bucky ?”
hey guys, you gotta read this. It's important. I'm not joking.
“No. It's sir. You're old enough now. Wait. How old are you again ?”
'You wouldn't if you knew.' He thought, chest aching as if he was being stabbed.
Steve had shut his mouth and glared at the man he had until then considered like his friend.
Bucky stepped back into the shadows, silently thanking the AI for never announcing his presence when he found himself spying on his new friends.
(See the end of the chapter for
/NO !/
“But you can’t figure out why you’re here ?”
‘I hope so too’ Replied Bucky mentally.
Bucky woke up to Thor laughing loudly.
Surprisingly, the AI sounded almost concerned. Steve laughed weakly at that.
Hey ! I read all your comments, but since I was at school I didn't have time to answer, I'm sorry ! Thank you all though ! I love you and I'm really happy to see the same people commenting chapter after chapter.
“I do not believe anyone hates you in this Tower, Captain Rogers.”
What was unusual, though, was the lack of hand in his.
Bucky grabbed his head with his two hands, metal and flesh pulling at his soft long hair.
And I know. Angst. So much angst. But you're addicts and Natasha centered fics are quite rare so I know most of you are interested. x) (or maybe im wrong and you don't care)
“What is the mission ?” Asked the Winter Soldier.
Also, yes, I plan on updating this more often, so don't be scared to read, please don't abandon me I worked hard for this ^^"
The raven haired kid whose name was apparently Loki facepalmed. “Worst. Brother. Ever.”
And uh, that's all. Gotta go !
A small voice made itself heard in his head. A mess of whispered thoughts slowly turning into single, clear one.
Clint spitting hateful words at him. Laughing at his tears.
Thor turned to her, surprised. He hadn't noticed her coming.
Tony's vision blurred as he held onto the test tub, gritting his teeth.
“Yes sir.”
Anyway I hope you just read that. Coz my long af notes are certainly not read by everyone and I get it it's so boring I skip them too. It's just, for those who keep commenting how Steve is so unforgivable, here, let me reveal some of the plot : Steve has issues. Mainly PTSD and depression but depression goes with PTSD most of the time (it's a symptom).
