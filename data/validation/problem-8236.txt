Steve shakes his head, giving him a small smile.
"A letter," she confirmed. "This letter, Tony, is a very important part of the healing process. By writing to Steve, you afford yourself the opportunity to thank him, or forgive him, or ask him why he did the things he did. Now, we don't mail the letter but the simple act of putting it on paper frees you, allows you to let go," she said, "Do you think you can do that for me?"
Steve hummed thoughtfully, eyes trained on their daughter as she fed.
"Stark! Listen to me, we're not going outside, I promise. What happened?" he asked, feeling a lump at the back of his throat. He felt guilty because he wasn't there when this had happened. Maybe if he was with Tony then this wouldn't have happened. He wouldn't have gotten the phone call from Tony and Tony would've been safe and very much not high.
When he moves it a little bit more to the right, Tony yelps, grabbing hold of his arm to stop him from moving his ankle around any further. He grimaces and moves his hands away, feeling guilty for causing Tony even more pain than he was already feeling.
Tony was already upset with him.
He’s met with the sight of Tony slumped on the floor, hunched over his right leg and body all tense.
Despite all the things they've just said, all the dark thoughts and insecurities being put out for the other to see, he finds it in himself to laugh, and soon Tony is laughing too, shoukders shaking and tears running down his face.
Tony tries to get Steve to agree to go back to bed but the blond is stubborn, refusing to go back to bed and just holds onto Tony's arm tighter, shuffling into the kitchen slowly.
"Good morning. I wasn't sure if you would be up yet. How did you sleep?" he asked, gauging Steve's expression.
When he realizes that Steve's watching him with a mixture of wariness and exhaustion clear on his face, he packs his phone away.
Although, that could just be Natasha. She sounds normal whenever she's sparring against Clint, or whenever she's shooting at the enemy. So maybe she was still annoyed at him, but was extremely good at hiding it. He doesn't dwell on those thoughts and gets straight to the point.
He's surprised, as anyone else would be. After all, Rhodey hardly got leave from training, and if he did, it was only for a day, not an entire week.
Tony glanced at Steve, smirking slightly. "They all knew about it?" he asked. Steve shook his head in agreement. "I told them, yes. And I got both Pepper and Rhodey's blessings. Somehow the others found out."
And Steve feels that he's depended on Tony too much in the last two days. He needed a break. He needed to learn to do things by himself.
Not this Steve.
Steve knows that there are still boxes that need to be unpacked with clothes that needed to be folded and put into the correct drawers. It isn't a lot to do, but it would suffice in keeping his mind busy so that he couldn't torture himself into thinking up various scenarios of when the time came to pick Morgan up and bring her back home.
It's not the best answer, but it's a step up from having Steve cry. At least he's calm and has stopped saying things that weren't true. Things like 'this is my fault'. If Steve said that one more time… Well, Tony was really close to losing it himself, actually. Because how could Steve even blame himself for something like this? He didn't hurt their daughter. Sometimes babies are simply born and they can't breathe properly. It's normal.
Stone smiles wider.
He's shocked to realize that it's
He'd barely walked five steps when he saw her walking down the hallway, apparently already on her way to Steve's room.
And one second Steve's sitting there in the hospital bed that in all honesty should probably be a tight fit for his frame, but at the moment seems to make him smaller than he really is, more vulnerable, and the next he can see Steve's facade crack and his face crumble.
When he got back to the tower, his mind was pleasantly quiet, which, to him, made for a good day. He took a quick shower then started on the team's breakfast, greeting each of them with a smile as they walked in.
"Morning," Tony said with a smile before sitting down. His therapist sat opposite him, pen in hand and last week's notes laying in her lap. "So Tony, you've said you had trouble getting over Steve. I found a way for you to get over him," the therapist said and Tony leaned forward in his seat. She had his full attention. She slid a piece of paper and pen in Tony's direction.
"Tony, hey, look at me - " he gripped Tony by the shoulders. "What else do you remember?" he asked.
That didn't mean, however, that he didn't see the look that Tony gave him when he thought he couldn't see.
And as he said, it was a less than ideal situation. But Steve also knew that one could never truly be prepared for having a child. You could prepare for a long time and still be wholly unprepared when they came along, or you could be someone who never prepared, and when they came along everything kind of just slipped into place. You could never know with these sorts of things.
Steve bit his lip to keep from laughing.
Also, the fact that George Michael was singing about how his ex just used him as some sort of emotional crutch hit a little too close to home for him. Steve didn't trust him anymore. Couldn't even look at him properly when they were together for any amount of time. He basically ridiculed Steve.
"Why?" he asks and Tony frowns. "Because I can't sleep without you here with me. Steve, what if they come back?" Tony asks.
to even spare a thought towards doing something so horrible.
That pretty much made up his mind for him.
Tony rubbed his eye and bit his lip, not looking Steve in the eye.
"Ah, yes. Whoever knew that Natasha was a secret lover of romance films? Tell you what, how about we go out tonight for dinner? We could go out and then watch a movie when we get back. And if you want, we could stop on the way for dessert," Steve suggested. He hoped that Tony said yes, seeing that he had already made plans in his head. Ones that he was hoping would come to fruition and would help lift Tony's spirits a little.
He first noticed it when they finished their little street fight with Doom (he absolutely refused to call it a mission because to him, missions meant battling against their challenging enemies and blowing up their hideouts while staying hidden long enough to make it out and be on their way home on the Quinjet before their enemies even realized what hit them) and Tony had flown back to the tower without saying a word.
Which was a massive problem for him right now, especially since he needed to get Tony to Bruce as soon as possible. He didn't like the effects that whatever was used to drug Tony had on him.
Tony frowned at how quiet Steve had gotten, sensing that something was wrong; Steve was too quiet, too still. He was slumped over, almost as if he were defeated, and he wouldn't look in Tony's direction, his head was tilted in the direction of the window overlooking the city.
What was unusual was that they were arguing at the asscrack of dawn. And the fact that they were arguing at all right now.
He sees it when Steve's face goes eerily blank before he turns away. But he notices how Steve's youthful face suddenly looks drawn and even more tired, his blue eyes dim. Steve is trying not to let his obvious hurt show, and Tony wonders — if not for the third time this night, if he's finally done it, he's become the biggest asshole ever.
Last night and today were the most he's ever seen Steve cry, and both times they were for things that were out of Steve's control, yet things that he held himself accountable for.
It’s not fast enough because just as he’s stepping over the threshold of the lab and the glass doors are sliding shut behind him, he hears Tony curse up a blue streak and a loud clattering as whatever tools were around Tony is knocked to the floor.
He watched Steve's face carefully as he spoke, noting the way the blond furrowed his eyebrows as he got closer and closer to blurting out 'move in with me?' and the way a deep frown started to form.
Tony laughed and then pouted when he realized that he had missed out on Bruce's hot chocolate.
He dropped his paintbrush and palette on the table beside his easel and ran to the garage.
Tony turned over with a moan, eyes still tightly shut. A hand wrapped around his waist and Tony opened his eyes, smiling when he saw Steve smiling at him, blue eyes sparkling. "You okay?" Steve asked. "Yeah, just a huge headache. Now I know why I never cry," Tony said. His head was pounding, voice rough and eyes feeling bruised. Steve laughed and Tony pouted. "I love you, you know that. I've never stopped loving you," Steve said softly. Tony looked down at their tangled hands. "I love you too," he said. Steve tilted his head so that Tony was looking him in the eye. "I promise you, that I will make it up to you. I love you. And I'm never going to leave you again," Steve whispered.
Literally.
Like now, for instance.
Just the other day he and Steve had been alone in the elevator on the way to the boardroom where the rest of the team were waiting to start a meeting and they hadn't shared a single word between them.
Didn't mean his hands weren't twitching or his eyes didn't glance over to the empty bar area a few times.
Either way, if he were in Steve's shoes he'd think the same thing. And who knows, maybe the blond already thought that.
He wanted Steve back. Right now. Right where he was. He needed Steve.
"Tony, you don't need to - " Steve murmurs, sounding put out. He lays back on the bed, shoving his hands into his eyes.
Sam, who had been sitting next to Thor, who, for once in his life was uncharacteristically silent - and maybe it was due to the huge box of Pop-Tarts that he was munching on - rolled his eyes and stood up. "Well, if none of you are going to do anything, I'm going back to bed," he said, shaking his head in disbelief before yawning.
"So, I phoned Pepper last night and she had some people drop off a couple of baby supplies at the penthouse. Knowing Pepper, she probably had them assemble the crib and everything else that had to be built. She also might've had a few people clear out one of the spare rooms and turn it into a nursery. I know we didn't talk about it, but you know Pepper, she has good intentions. So, what do you say? Move in with me? Well, I mean, there's the guest bedroom, so not really in with me
Not that his little act was working. Barnes seemed to catch on earlier at the tower and kept on giving him and Steve weird looks when he thought Steve wasn't looking.
"I'll be there," Steve said, "Just - just hang on tight, okay? I'll be there soon. Okay, sweetheart?" Steve said.
Why would Steve comfort him over this? He knows that this topic is also something that isn't exactly easy for Steve to talk to him about.
"Shut up, those pick-up lines were literal gold. And they worked, didn't they? I have the hottest man on my arm. What more could I possibly want?" Tony said with a smirk.
Pepper was going to kill him for this.
Tony sat down at the desk with a small sigh before unlocking the drawer, eyes skimming the contents inside. Before he knew it, he was sitting with both the letter and burner phone in hand.
"I really, really need you, Steve. I missed you so much. And I didn't know if you were being serious with the letter and the phone. It just said that you'll be here for me when I needed you but I didn't know if you still loved me," Tony whispered.
"Tony, there's no one else in here but us. I haven't opened the door yet."
"You don't need to make excuses, Tony. Talk to me, sweetheart," Steve says, squeezing to grab his attention.
He pulls his hand out of Tony's and walks away.
Tony dresses quickly, running a hand through his wet hair and winces when he realizes that his hair will dry in its natural curls, simply because he was too lazy to brush it out properly. Which, since he had forgone getting a haircut two weeks ago, was going to be even more of a nightmare. But he doesn't care about that; he's rushing to get back to the medical floor so that he can be there when Steve wakes up.
Tony grimaces at the reminder.
He's gone not even a minute later, the glass doors of the medbay swishing shut behind him.
His nonchalant attitude just serves to worry him even more and he pushes for more information, anything that will tell him what is going on with Tony. His effort, however, is futile when Tony waves him away, and, almost as if feeling guilty (he should feel some guilt because it really hurt when Tony ignored him without even speaking to him), he blows him a kiss and shoots him a tiny grin over his shoulder.
This was the real Tony.
When Sam leaves, Natasha wastes no time in beating about the bush and goes in straight for the kill.
Today is the day that Morgan gets discharged and would be coming home.
They were saved from saying anything else to one another when Barnes walked in.
And how could he even think of that? What horrible person thought of things like that? Steve was in pain. Steve needed him. And he wanted to comfort Steve. It was wrong to try and take advantage of the blond when he wasn't behaving like his usual self, when he was in this vulnerable state.
which sounds interesting enough. It's up to you though."
The arguing started at two in the morning. Granted, no one else on the team had heard anything yet, but when they asked JARVIS what time it
The way she states it so casually makes something in the back of his mind go off. So the others
"There you go. I guess you were just hungry, huh?" Steve murmurs and smiles down at his daughter.
God, Tony missed Steve's laugh. Tony bit his lip to stop the whimper escaping but Steve still heard. Damn super-soldier with his super hearing. "Doll?" Steve asked worriedly.
He feels his throat close up and his eyes prickle. Was this - Is this how Tony actually felt? So he wasn't the only one then; he wasn't the only one who was convinced that they were the reason that the other didn't reciprocate each other's feelings,Tony felt the same way too.
Steve wastes no time in opening the bag, making sure not to rip it. He brushes aside the tissue paper and pulls out the first thing he sees.
He sees when Tony realizes the exact moment that he clued on to the fact that something was wrong because Tony tries to pull a face to show exactly how unhappy he is with Clint but it fails. All it does is fall flat and show how miserable he looks.
"Good morning, Mr. Stark. I take it you were visiting Steve? I hope you weren't riling my patient up again," she says, glancing at him for a couple of seconds and then turns away to greet a nurse that tells her good morning. Although this time, he can hear a teasing lilt to her voice, and not an accusatory one.
"Sorry," he apologizes hastily and hates how fake it sounds. He doesn't sound sorry, but he really is. He doesn't mean to hurt Steve. Ever. Hates how Steve's happy smile disappears and he gets all quiet.
"We're not calling our kid Blob."
"Firstly, I wasn't cheating on you. It wasn't some affair if you knew about it,
"Sure, Tony. Whatever helps you sleep at night."
The smell of strong coffee permeating the air is enough to lead him to the kitchen where FRIDAY had already started the machine for him.
He moves forward again and stops short when he realises that the doors to his lab aren't opening.
He could've gotten married to Peggy, maybe have had a house with a white picket fence. Maybe had a child with her and a pet.
Steve doesn't hesitate to put his fears at ease.
And when he finally got off the phone with Tony, he spared a minute to think about the conversation that he had had with Pepper not even three days after his fight with Tony, when he was extremely furious and annoyed to even think straight.
There was silence on the line. "Steve? You're mad, aren't you?" Tony asked sounding uncertain. "What? No, I'm not mad. I'm really proud of you," Steve said. He sounded happy. "You are?" Tony asked. "I'm really proud of you, sweetheart. Is it helping?" he asked.
So the fact that Steve and Tony were close with each other and seemed content to kiss each other whenever they wanted to, well, that was their own doing.
He looks tired.
He grinned. "Okay, firstly, it's Tony. Not Mr. Stark. I know you don't care about the whole formality thing like everyone else does so why are you still calling me Mr. Stark? I didn't peg you as one of the sucking up to the boss type of people. And secondly, yes, I was visiting Cap.
And yet he could practically imagine his ma rolling in her grave when he asked her that.
Tony nodded. "Ah. Okay. And how are
hidden; he hadn't touched this particular blend in a while (since he and Steve broke up) and the last time he'd had it was precisely seven months ago, back when he and Steve were still dating and blissfully unaware of the near future. Tony still remembers the exact thing they were doing that night; they were settled on the sofa in front of the penthouse television with the lights turned down low, cuddling together and holding steaming mugs of coffee. He can't remember what movie was playing, just that it was some mindless series on Netflix that didn't require much effort to catch up on if a few scenes or episodes were missed, and that he and Steve were far more interested in the other than the actual show.
And that's when Steve broke the moment.
No matter how guilty betraying Tony's trust in him made him feel, using Tony's own A.I. against him was the only way that they could get out of the bathroom, and he intended to use it.
So he shrugs it off and tells JARVIS to remind Tony that they'll be having supper with the rest of the team and watching a movie later. JARVIS assures him that the message would be relayed and he made his way down to his art studio to work off a little more of the adrenaline that was still coursing its way through his body. Unfortunately for him, the fight with Doom and his bots were of no challenge and was easily defeated, which meant that he didn't have an outlet for all of his energy. Painting helped relieve some of whatever pent up emotions or leftover adrenaline he had and it seemed like the best bet.
is… jesus he looks about 30, maybe 35 tops. He can’t remember the last time he looked this good.
They go home and talk.
Steve and Tony stare in disbelief. Tony’s new blood sample now looks more similar to Bruce’s blood, or Steves than it does to his own blood results from a year ago.
- Tony+Bucky friendship, possibly with more about Tony upgrading his arm.
Steve smiles, and thanks Bruce again before rushing out the door. He’s got a meeting to get to, and a couple of conversations to figure out.
“Yeah I guess,” says Tony. “I think that must have been when Steve was on the other side of the world for that thing with the werewolf-people? Oh hey didn’t I have that week-long SI tech conference in California? But oh, yeah I flew home early from that…”
“There’s some sort of sentient plant attacking the Brooklyn Bridge, all available Avengers assemble. Coordinates to follow… or just head out to Brooklyn, you’ll see it.”
“But yeah, I mean I’ve been working on a plan and if you’re serious about figuring things out together I think we can… figure it out, together." Tony continues to pace. "I’ve been working with my lawyers and some of the higher ups in Wakanda actually. They are masters of working around the red tape that world governments like to throw up, and they also have a lot of keen insights about wielding massive power in a world that isn’t really prepared for it. We’re drafting some really slick amendments to the accords and if we can get them to pass, it will basically be the best of both worlds. It will protect Wakanda from external interference and provide the Avengers and other select groups with autonomy. Real autonomy, but with a protective layer between us and anyone that wants to claim our super-powers gave them cancer or whatever bullshit arises next from our adoring public.” Tony throws up three screens to show the progress he’s made so far.
Bruce settles back onto a stool and wonders if he did the right thing. Steve is obviously completely gone for Tony. And he knows he has a lecture coming from Nat about how he’s messing with Steve’s perfectly perfect budding relationship with Becky. That Stark is an unknown quantity that may be doing better on the team, but who is a disaster when it comes to his personal life.
“Huh, guess it turns out we didn’t really need to be sneaking around these last couple of weeks after all.”
The moment Steve kneels, Tony’s brain shorts out.
Steve huffs, “Why do I feel like you’re some kind of Willy Wonka, but with sex instead of candy?”
Tony loses his grip a little saying “Yes Steve, yes,” head still on the table like he can't bear to keep watching.
“Okay first Tony, you will need to either abstain from penetrative sex or use condoms for the foreseeable future. We need to observe how long the serum stays active in your system, and if there is deterioration or negative side effects when you are cut off from... the source. Then I’ll need you to provide a blood sample at the same time every day for next two weeks.”
“Has anyone ever done this for you before Steve?” He slides the finger out and back in up to the knuckle.
“Yes, I am using my own personal wealth to fund the “Change Accords for Progress Political Action Committee.” Because this planet needs united heroes. It’s safe to assume another event like the Chitauri invasion of New York
“Good point," says Tony, better make it a blowjob then you fuck me, then I…”
Tony rubs the washcloth along Steve’s back, playing the hug off as a maneuver to clean him. He gets to the swell of his ass before moving back around to his front, skimming the soapy cloth over his abs.
Steve adds a third finger and more lube. “Apologies if that was unclear, we will need to insert the expander for a short while. It’s part of the process that can’t be skipped, here we go.” Steve removes his fingers and Tony turns in time to see him pick up the largest “expander,” aka, dildo, and slather lube over it with his gloved hand.
“I know. I
Tony let’s out a strangled moan and manages to say “Yess” as Steve begins to thrust faster and faster. Tony is still pinned in place, but he squeezes as tight as he can every time Steve impales him, moaning low over and over. He can tell it’s affecting Steve because his iron control is slipping. His movements become erratic and his thrusts shallow.
He grabs Steve hair at the back of his crown and yanks, hard.
Tony pauses to press the cloth’s cool gel bumps more firmly up against Steve’s perineum on his way back to his hole. Steve releases the most animalistic groan yet.
Steve wants to try.
Steve’s stomach growls.
Steve swallows and nods, “And Option 3?”
Tony guffaws.
He leans forward, taking Tony’s hands back up to the pillow above his head and entwines their fingers, holding them above Tony’s head while he braces the majority of his weight on his elbows. Something about the position feels familiar, and he realizes it’s similar to leaning forward full tilt on his Harley. Just a different kind of ride. He grins, suddenly confident.
Bruce continues. “Just a few more questions. What is the longest you two have gone without having sex?
"Dude, you're embarrassing me in front of the wizards." says Tony as Strange moves Bruce to safety with one of his admitedly handy portals.
The puzzle is sex.
? What?
Tony wastes no time when he gets to his room. There are always swimsuits in the dressers of all the bedrooms in all of his properties (even the one in Switzerland, hello, hot tubs?). If Steve wants to have a heart to heart, or give a lecture, or both (which, of course he does. Tony knows he’s only avoided it this long because he’s been in a pretty decent amount of pain), he can do it on the beach.
Steve nods, before remembering to say “Yes, Tony” and takes off his shirt.
“Shh, I know, just… I need to concentrate Tony. Can you relax into my hold? I’m going to move you up and down over my cock until I come. I just need you to move where I put you okay? You can lean back, I won’t let you fall.”
all the way to Wakanda, and then on to your super-secret base of operations that I totally know the location of.”
“Don’t worry about the details Scott, this is just something Tony does… honestly I wouldn’t be surprised if somehow Cassie’s college tuition is already paid for…”
Sometimes he writes about how he can’t sleep. He’s careful not to get too intense. He doesn’t want Tony to shut down when he is so far away, but slowly it starts to feel right again. Like they were before Japan. They share stories and create inside jokes and one day when Tony calls him ‘Captain Tightpants’ in retaliation to some barb of his own, Steve writes back only:
“Nrrg, uh, wha?” Steve can’t help but exclaim at the sensation, but also can’t really fathom that Tony enjoys eating soap…
“It’s your choice Steve.”
Steve relaxes and takes a seat on the sofa a little bit away from where Tony is taking the call. He’ll listen in and join the call when he feels comfortable. That’s the best he can do.
“Please fuck me with your tongue, Steve. Open me up, get me ready. I want to feel you inside me. I don’t want to wait anymore, I’ll hold myself open, just for you. I’m ready, take me with your mouth,
Steve slips fully into the floaty feeling as he lets go, accepts that he’s just a nice warm place for Tony to come into. He’s there to accept whatever Tony gives him, he just has to be still and keep his mouth wrapped around Tony’s perfect cock and just be. Perfect.
Steve wraps a firm hand around himself. “This is what’s going to be inserted inside you,” Steve narrates, as if his cock isn’t a cock at all but a piece of medical equipment. “First I need to apply the lube so that it won’t hurt you. Next, I need to ensure it’s in working order, replicating the procedure movements before moving on to inserting it into you.”
“Welp, I already said it!" says Tony. "Come on Steve, let’s go… '
He looks at Tony, who is waiting as patiently as he can with his fists still glued to the wood of the headboard.
Tony laughs and flops back, hands waving in an “ask away” motion.
Tony rolls his eyes and mumbles what Steve’s hearing just makes out as “mixed messages!” before removing his own pants and watch, and taking his phone out of the pocket placing it beside the Stark pad and getting in.
“Okay.”
He’d like to think he knows Steve a little better than he did before they were quarantined together. As hard as it is to believe, Steve really is as earnest as he seems, and based on Tony’s response to the news about Becky, Steve didn’t tell Tony about her.
Bruce takes his glasses off and cleans them to buy him one last minute of not getting tangled up in this mess.
“I have relayed your message, Captain.”
Tony wishes Steve could just be direct. It’s so strange to see the same man that can make split second life and death calls in the field hem and haw over how to say “I like you.” Tony’s brain doesn’t seem to process his elaborate roundabout language. It’s doesn’t compute, and he hates that even now playing it back for himself he isn’t totally sure what Steve means.
“You can’t just refuse medical care Tony!” Steve starts before he’s even made it to their make-shift healing station.
“I’m going to insert this now. It shouldn’t be painful. Let me know if you feel any pain and we will go back to the manual method for a while longer.”
that?”
And Tony falls the rest of the way into his lap and leans in to kiss him. And for a moment Steve lets himself imagine
He rubs his hands up and down Tony's back in a silent apology. Tony hums and presses back against Steve. It's not sexual, just a comforting return of Steve's physical affection, like a cat pressing into the hand of its owner.
The entire team is there, plus the Guardians, Nebula, Strange, Wong and Bucky. T'Challa and his senior guard round out the group surrounding Thanos, a righteous judgement council.
“Me too.”
Jesus. One day, maybe not for a while, Tony thinks, Thor may need to spend some time in B.A.R.F.
Just then there’s a tremor. Screams and chaos echo into the sanctum from outside on the street.
But as always with Tony it’s confusing.
Tony pulls a little more on the handful of hair. “Words Steve.”
Pepper hasn’t said anything, but there’s this air of… confused respect whenever they interact. Like she can’t believe he’s being so mature about it, or she can’t believe he isn’t asking her to come back.
After what seems like just a moment and somehow many hours the thumb is removed and the gauntlet slips around the back of his head to cup the base of his skull. Tony moves closer, the groin of the suit only a few inches from Steve’s now wet mouth.
A view of the entirety of Steve.
Tony dismisses the screen, grabs himself a bottle of water and leans against the bar where he can see the elevator clearly.
that?” mutters Tony.
Once Steve is settled, his back to Tony’s chest, Tony starts: “I wanted to ask where you’re at, check-in. We did a lot in the last 24 hours and I know we had that blip in the shower. What did we do that you liked, what didn’t you like? Do you have questions?”
Right.
Angst ahoy! The dreaded conversation (or part of it) has arrived.
Steve still looks lost.
Another rinse and he’s ready for some lube. Steve lets out a pathetic noise as Tony stands to gather more supplies.
He’s on the right track, he thinks. He begins stroking him again, not hurried, just pressure up and down the length to remind him he’s there.
“Jarvis?” Steve asks doubtfully. He’s pretty sure the AI wasn’t around then.
Steve’s tempted, but he’s ready to move on. He moves off of Tony entirely, emptying the remainder of the small tube into his palm and throwing it to the side. Steve straddles him again, facing him once more. He bends to kiss him languidly for a moment until Tony nips at his lip, a silent protest for not getting his way.
And Tony has no problem with that, far from it, but he also doesn’t want to create a one-sided dynamic. He’s already older, and definitely way more experienced than Steve. If this is more than a one-night thing for Steve (and Tony is guessing it is, because it’s Steve), there’s a lot to navigate. And they already have a shit-ton of baggage to work through totally separate from sex.
“If I have questions or want you to stop I’ll say ‘Stop.’”
Steve freezes.
Tony interrupts, "I'm sorry, Earth is closed today. You'd better pack it up and get out of here. Get lost, Squidward!"
They rent a second boat when Rocket and Tony challenge Thor and Steve to a boat race (“Brawn verses brains” Rocket so delicately dubs the match).
Bruce is worried about Tony.
And she no doubt heard him as well thanks to Tony’s incredibly advanced comms system.
Steve sits up and allows Tony’s hands to tilt his face up, so they’re making eye contact. Tony smiles a small smile, like he knows a secret, and brings the tip of his erection to Steve’s plaint mouth.
After laying there for a while, contemplating if it’s possible to die from embarrassment, a thought occurs to him.
He pulls his lips into his mouth before answering, “I think I’d like to hear what the other options are?”
His fingers slide down, all the way brushing over his entrance. Just slightly, just enough
“Fuck, Tony, I’m not gonna last." Steve confesses. "I’ve been hard since you called me… had to tuck my erection into my waistband and run back here full-tilt.”
Steve knows that things with Becky never really got back to where they were before Hawaii. After he told her about his conversation with Tony, she said it wouldn’t change anything… but it did.
Because he’s been offered a spot on
Steve’s hands clench at his side. “I need you to touch me, touch my cock
Steve helps him pack for Hawaii (though he notices he leaves his silk boxers in the drawer for Tony to pack himself). He’s still sore, but the thought of a few days in paradise with Steve is making things a lot better.
Clint and LASS-E Tear. It. Up. Balls are thrown, arrows are caught mid-air in her jaws, and Clint actually does get to take her on a mission (though she has to stay in the hellicarrier).
He’s been in the “future” for over five years now, but it’s still engrained in him to think kissing a man will get him a negative reaction. Especially from a military man.
Tony takes a step forward and begins to pace. He presses on, ignoring the kneeling
Tony pauses. “Huh, okay we’ll send you the paperwork to act as an independent consultant. You can still call SI/The Avengers clients once you guys are up and running.” Tony clicks a few more things on the pad and sets it aside, sipping his coffee.
Tony’s mouth waters as he looks at Steve hard and glistening in front of him. His errection is obscene, sticking out of Steve’s pants while the rest of him is still totally buttoned up and professional. Tony takes a mental picture of it, Steve in his glasses and lab coat and khakis, cock weeping. Fuck, he'll be thinking about this image for years.
Shuri and Nebula don’t say no, primarily because they have no idea what he’s talking about.
It’s not that Tony doesn’t know that Steve has never been to Hawaii before. It’s just… Steve is looking at everything like it might as well be Jurassic Park or something. It’s adorable. He feels a pang of regret for being the reason Steve didn’t get to see Japan other than the hotel and hospital.
Tony sighs. “It’s… The cradle fixed it… Look, I can’t promise the next time we fight I won’t get freaked out a little… and yes don’t look at me like that Steve, we’re both running high on endorphins now, but we are going to disagree in the future. You’re a stubborn son of a bitch and I can be kind of an asshole. We’ll work on it.”
“You kept the phone.” says Steve, noticing the flip-phone he gave Tony months ago on a wireless charging pad next to the tablet.
Steve puts his hands out on Tony’s shoulders like he needs a physical support to keep from keeling over. It’s unlikely with the serum he’s actually light-headed. But it means Tony’s words have mentally worked him up so much that his brain
He imagines Steve ripping them from the wall while fucking him. Maybe they can do some stress tests next time…
After a moment Steve does think of one thing to bring up. “I really,
Steve reads the rest of the note and laughs.
It seems like seconds later that Steve hears the shower turn off. He comes back to himself and looks down at his chest to see that he has literally come all over his undershirt. He hears Tony’s movements in the bathroom as he starts to dry off and panics; it could not look more like he’s deliberately drenched himself in his own come. He already made it clear to Tony earlier that he didn’t want to go any further, so taking the shirt off doesn’t exactly send the right message… but leaving himself a mess isn’t an option either…
Tony practically jumps off the table, ripping the paper on top. He turns and bends over, leaning on the table as instructed and presenting his ass. He looks back at Steve who has moved to roll the circular doctor’s chair over. It doesn’t have a back, just a round leather cushion on a rolling metal base. Fuck, Tony did not think this through, going to the doctor is going to be really fucking arousing for the foreseeable future.
There’s a loud click and the groin plating disappears to reveal Tony’s hard cock, silently swaying inches from Steve’s now-empty mouth. Steve is pretty sure that isn’t something the armor does in real life (nor is Tony in the armor naked... he's 95% sure). He takes a moment to appreciate what’s been revealed.
Tony rolls his eyes but moves to sit opposite Bruce, pulling a stool around the other side of the lab table. He leaves enough room for Steve to pull up another next to him, which he does.
“I’m sure I will; see you in an hour Tony.” Steve laughs as he ends the transmission and turns around. If he pushes it he can be back there and in Tony’s suite in 20 minutes.
Most of them are just passageways that have reinforced rooms fifty feet or so below ground-level. The rooms have communications equipment that is hard-wired and connected to mini arc-reactor generators, food enough for four people for two weeks and a variety of weapons. The entire system is built to sustain a nuclear blast, and honestly Tony kind of forgot to tell the rest of the team about it. Maybe he subconsciously liked being the only one to know it was down there, something deep inside still not fully trusting anyone but himself.
Tony nods, making a note to never suggest Steve be the patient. If he brings up wanting that they’ll work on it and discuss things more before jumping in.
“Would you
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony, who can’t seem to help himself asks “Is anyone going to address that there’s a talking Build-a-Bear? No, just me?”
A couple of months ago Peter suggested they do a “really old movie night” (that is, films from the 80s and 90s). His Aunt May finally eased up after Thanos and agreed that he could be around the team mask-less. His argument being that if he had a hand in saving half of all existence, he should at least have a little more freedom to bond with the team. Pete can now come to the compound to hang out twice a week (as long as his homework is done), and has a curfew of 11:30 pm.
Steve can’t believe he’s agreed to this. Well, he can, because he’s scared and tense and pretty much the last thing he wants to do is jerk off into a little cup by himself.
He’d be so… Tony slides two fingers over, to trace between his cheeks. Steve would say
… I’m officially dreaming. Okay dream-Steve, here’s what I want. I want you naked, like, yesterday. I want you rutting on your knees for me until you get rug burns from my Isfahan rug. I want you to take me as deep as you can down your throat, get me right to the edge, and then back off. I want to slap your beautiful face with my hard cock until you're begging to have it back in your mouth, I want you to choke on my cum and I want to taste myself on your pretty lips before I fuck your mouth with my tongue the way my cock just did moments before...”
He pauses to note that the trademark STARK name isn’t there either, which means Clint’s intel was probably accurate. Just last week he heard Tony was planning to sell the building and move The Avengers (such as they were) to a compound upstate. Maybe he already did, and the tower is empty, sold off to the highest bidder.
“It’s not my fault “CAP PAC” was the most marketable name! That was picked by a focus group, not me!” Tony’s mouth does the little twitch it does when he’s lying. Steve has to kiss it. He does it without thinking, just a quick peck at the corner. When Steve remembers he’s on camera he quickly pulls away, blushing slightly as he looks up to see if Rhodey has any reaction.
Tony doesn’t say anything about his growing erection. Steve told him to be still and quiet. Steve is in control.
“Steve, uh, I’m, I’m gonna lose my grip.”
Tony retracts the helmet and kisses him, hard. There’s no finesse, it’s not even a kiss so much as a violent press of his lips on Steves, assurance that he’s here. He’s alive.
Tony and Steve are sitting together on one of the sofas as usual during Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. About half-way through Tony – having seen the movie several times - has snuggled all the way up to Steve, throwing his leg over Steve’s and slotting his head under Steve’s chin.
“Mmm, ‘washboard’ abs indeed, Captain” he says scrubbing the cloth along them as if he were Charlie Bucket’s mother himself.
The first chapter of the second story (
God what was Steve saying? Tony tunes back in to realize Steve is still rambling about changing roles, and progress in communication. He is about to save him from himself, when Sam pipes up.
Steve smiles because Tony can’t see it from where he’s fallen back on the table. Tony looks amazing, ass exposed, legs spread wide. Steve sets each of Tony’s heels in the metal and plastic holders and presses his knees apart. They have naturally migrated together, Tony instinctively trying to cover himself, protect such an exposed area.
“That’s right” Tony smiles. “You have to follow the Order of Operations or the whole equation falls apart. Now, can you get naked for me?"
He glances back once, just for luck… to see Steve lowering his mouth down to Tony’s… Gah!
They’re in bed a few hours later when Friday notifies them that Wanda and Vision have returned.
Steve is floating on a cloud of bliss until Tony tells him he’s about to leak bodily fluids onto a priceless rug. Realizing that he’s so worked up, so wet, that Tony has noticed, that’s mortifying enough, but to think he could ruin something like that…
Wanda’s magic keeps the hand with the stones pulled away from Thanos’ body as Dr. Strange deftly uses a portal to slice the gauntleted arm off at the bicep. The portal closes as the dismembered arm lands back in the New York sanctum where Wong quickly casts a series of cloaking and protective spells.
“So I can’t really get the idea out of my head, and I thought I’d just ask. No pressure to say yes, it’s probably really stupid…” Tony takes a breath and presses on. “Was role-play even a thing in the 30s? I don’t want you to be like, some other person. Just like, wear a lab coat and put me up on a table and fuck me while talking about how big of a dose I need, that kind of a thing... You’d be Steve, but just like, Dr. Rogers? Oh fuck I’m getting hard…”
It's... Yeah they are still in the shower. I swear there's more character development and discussion of the deep issues coming... Idk what to tell you, it's a really nice shower. 😅
Just as they gain the advantage however, a building begins to collapse, and Steve and Tony are tied up getting people out of the way and reinforcing the structural integrity so it doesn’t cause massive loss of life.
Steve whimpers.
So far their talk has gone about as well as it could have. He didn’t realize that Steve was so hurt by his silence in Japan… or that Becky was essentially Steve’s own version of trying to escape feelings he thought weren’t reciprocated. When he thinks about it like that he almost feels sorry for Becky… almost.
Pepper nods, and Tony can’t take it anymore, he swipes to end the call.
Of course Tony is automatically trying to make everything better and easier for him. He always did that, just housed the team, fed the team, provided them with anything they ever needed. And they all just took it, like it was expected. Steve is going to be sure things are different moving forward.
Unbelievably his cock seeps even more precum, enough that once again it’s glistening, the liquid sliding down to pool at the base.
“Oh.” says Bruce. “OH. Umm, wow, wait… what?”
The collective Avengers groan at the name (minus Steve, who thinks it’s pretty… he thought Tony would go for more of a cliché, like Rex or Fido).
“Roughly, fourteen million.”
“You looks so good Tony, I’m going to hold your legs open like this just a little longer okay? I want you to get nice and slick for me.”
“Hey, you know that ‘eat something and go to sleep’ is definitely still on the table, right? Like, that’s Option 1, and it’s a great one! Where are we on that?”
At that Steve comes, and it’s only his super-soldier reflexes that allow him to get the cup up in time to catch the ejaculate. He comes and comes, almost worried that the cup will overflow. Eventually he stops, the liquid just a centimeter below the edge. He quickly adds the lid and sets the container on the edge of the sink, desperate to get at Tony in return.
Steve feels himself jerk, totally independent of any conscious movement and out of control. He gives in and focuses in on what can only be described as a whimper coming from the bathroom. Tony is in there, thinking about him… Steve knows that much should be obvious, but the mental image and the sounds that accompany it are too much.
“Yes?” Bruce says. Steve looks at him confused.
. I want to show you what you mean to me by making you feel good, and by sharing a part of myself that I haven’t shared with very many other people… maybe only one other person in my whole life...” Tony pauses, unsure. “Honestly this feels like it might be something I’ve never had with anyone else.”
Tony rewards Steve’s accommodation with a hard bite right on his ass-cheek. He tastes like lemon and honey.
“So good Steve, I’m close… when I tell you, I want you to suck as hard as you can. Can you do that for me?”
Tony whimpers.
Bruce looks at Tony and starts ticking things off on his fingers. “Not as much grey hair, leaner, more muscle mass, more youthful skin, fewer wrinkles… I just thought he was dying his hair, working out more, maybe botox…”
“While we have you all here, there’s actually something Tony and I wanted to tell you.”
Steve kisses him, as though to test it right then even though they’re both on the sofa in loungewear in the master suite of the compound, no armor in sight.
Steve knows he’s chickening out, but he’s just so overwhelmed. He never imagined growing up that he’d spend a day walking around telling his closest friends and co-workers that he’s in a relationship with another man.
“Right,” says Bruce, “A year ago Tony’s blood looked totally typical, just like Sam’s. But here’s what it looks like now.” Bruce dismisses Sam’s screen and brings up Tony’s new results alongside his old ones. At first glance they look similar, but there’s a series of flags and markers on the new one, and the lab results in the corner have several readings that are highlighted in red.
Maybe they will just turn out the light and then… Steve sees that he’s screwed as soon as Tony approaches the bed smirking.
When he gets there Steve and Tony are waiting for him on one of the sofas. Man, they’re sitting pretty close. His mind flashes back to what he saw in Tony’s suite.
“I need you to tell me the truth Tony. Have you been
“Tony Stark? Steven Rogers? I’m Doctor Stephen Strange, and I need you to come with us. It’s not over-selling it to say the fate of the universe is at stake.”
“At this time Wanda and I would like to officially announce our relationship, though much like Tony and Steve’s courtship, I believe everyone is already aware?”
Steve pulls out and quickly wipes himself off with some disposable towels from a dispenser on the wall.
Tony sobers and quickly pulls Steve into a hug. “I’m sorry. You’re right. We’ll figure it out, Bruce is on the case.”
Tony pauses. His mouth has run away from him again, but this time he’s done something even more terrifying than suggest Steve give him a blowjob… he’s basically told him he fucking loves him. He hadn’t even really thought through his own feelings to that conclusion yet, but he can see it’s true. Fuck.
Wanda is able to remove it from the bridge with her magic and Falcon and Vision distract it while Tony stuns it with an electric shock. The port authority helps wrap the unconscious plant-creature in a net and it’s taken away to be held in a containment unit for further study.
He covers his eyes with an arm and just lets loose. Might as well get it out there. Steve will have plenty of time to digest while they all sit through this performance at the New York City Center.
Does Steve really think he’s that out of control, like some sort of rabid animal? It’s… he knows he messed up with Japan. He knew when he was doing it he was messing up, that was the point. He wanted to just take some time away and just forget for a while; come to find out Steve was tracking his every move anyway… stupid instant internet. Stupid accommodating Japanese.
Surprised, he almost lets go of the hammer. Tony showing up means things are about to get much better and much worse. The armor doesn’t have the helmet and he can see Tony’s face clearly. Hear his natural voice. It cuts through the whispers of the bog drowning out everything else.
He sits on the adjacent sofa and sets his pad on the coffee table. He brought it in case this is just an early check-in meeting about his X-Con analysis... but he gets the feeling it’s something else.
And he really, really doesn’t know what to do now, because they are making their way to his bedroom (‘I want some time to think… show me your bed’). Seriously, what the fuck even is he supposed to do here?
Tony asks him some more questions about his security company, and to Scott’s utter shock and terror, he says “I’d love to be your first customer. Take a week or two and send me your analysis of the compound. I’ll have SI be the official client and they’ll send you over some terms and a contract.” Tony has pulled a pad out of somewhere and has been typing while he talks.
“I get it," Tony says, brushing a wet strand of hair away from Steve's face. "I was outed as bi by a tabloid in my 20s, but I definitely let my dad and everyone else think I was straight for a long time. I just ask because I know you mentioned being less experienced and I want to make sure you feel okay with everything. I can still… even though you’re the one fucking me, I can take the lead if you want?”
Damn it, Nat’s going to be annoyed.
“I don’t want to make you uncomfortable, and I know the timing of this is really shitty… say the word and we can pretend this never happened. Tell me no, and I’ll still be here to bring the team home and support you any way I can.”
“I love when you rim me, but that’s not what this is about.” Steve says.
“Ha,” says Tony, “I guess you need to fuck me every day or I might die.”
Tony lets a happy little moan escape. God damn, constant phantom erections may be his new perpetual state of being around Steve.
So when Steve and the rest of the lost boys (and girls) return home, Tony’s focus is split about 50/50, half of his attentions go to settling everyone in at the compound, making sure the team is bonding, and continuing to advocate for Bucky (who’s case wasn’t totally covered by the Accords II, which means he is still in limbo in Wakanda).
He’s an independently wealthy biochemist who is working on a cure for cancer. Honestly, he reminds Steve a little of Tony (though way more subdued and somewhat less attractive, in Steve’s opinion).
Steve and Tony finally have some real privacy.
His sketchbook was closed hastily and put to one side and he stood up as if in a trance and walked away, heading back to his and Tony's floor to change into clothing that was more suitable for the gym.
If you counted the hour that they had been sitting in the common room, then it meant that the arguing had now reached its third hour, with no signs of stopping anytime soon.
And when Tony's appalled look fell from his face and he pouted, Steve made sure to kiss him until he struggled to hide the smile from his face.
Then Steve's looking at Tony, and Tony can't contain the smile that threatens to emerge.
Tiberius Stone stands behind him, hands pocketed in his slacks, body language nonchalant but he's betrayed by the smug look on his face.
He doesn't turn around.
Which was why the doors to their balcony were open, the curtains billowing across the bedroom.
Steve turns to face him, carefully this time so as not to bring forth another feeling of discomfort, and mock-glares at Tony.
Her voice is gentle, and the question wasn't interrogatory or probing, but sounded rather curious. And she sounded genuinely concerned.
Tony! non ti vedo da tanto? Sei così impegnato da non avere più tempo per venirmi a trovare?
Don't forget to leave kudos and comment what you think!
Tony doesn't rush him and waits until Steve's lowered himself gingerly into the chair.
He hoped for his sake that neither Pepper and Rhodey nor Steve would ever find out about his little obsession with possessiveness.
"Eh, details." Tony waved a hand through the air. "Happy Valentine's day to us," Tony spoke softly, brown eyes glowing golden in the light of the candle between them.
Nevertheless, he stays silent and doesn't bother answering Tony's look of confusion, taking the mission brief from his hands instead.
But first, he needed to make a few calls.
Steve's entire body language was tense, frustration and anger rolling off of him in waves.
"Yeah, Tony?"
He smiled weakly at her, pumping her hand.
Other days he's sitting alone, drawing or reading and he'll suddenly be hit with the fact that he and Tony aren't together and he can't do anything but let the memories wash over his mind once more like a heavy blanket. Those days are far and few between, but when he does have them it's like there's a dark cloud above his head and nothing that usually makes him happy can help him shake the loneliness and sadness that he feels.
Natasha, surprisingly, answers on the first ring. And despite his earlier assumptions of her leaving him due to all of his complaints centering around Tony (who he was currently babysitting in a public bathroom), she sounds perfectly normal.
And for Tony, just seeing Steve genuinely happy at the news that he gets to visit his daughter and to hold her is enough to make him smile.
"You know, for someone who's spent this long in the modern world, you're still terrible at lying," Tony tells him. It comes out incredibly blunt, but his words are softened by the hand that Tony places on Steve's arm.
Steve cocks his head to one side for a minute before he straightens up. He clears his throat once, twice, and he can see just how nervous Steve is.
Tony's eyes trail back to his daughter, watching the way Steve handles her with the ease and gentleness of an experienced parent.
And then there was the added bonus that they would get to spend some time together.
Tony couldn't fault him for it, though.  The thing was, they hadn't even spoken about living arrangements. Yes, he had promised Steve that he would be there for their daughter. He can't imagine being one of those parents that ignore the mere existence of their children. And if he's being honest with himself, he can't imagine being the type of parent that Howard was to him.
The sight is enough to make his stomach turn and he has to breathe in and out several times so that he doesn't empty his already empty stomach.
The taste brings back memories of evenings spent in the kitchen, back when they were dating and they would settle anywhere so long as the other was next to them or in the near vicinity.
A couple of side notes in relation with the Italian that Tony and Mama Rosa exchange:
They knew what they had to do.
God, he was so fucked.
Steve.
Doctor Mikhailov hums thoughtfully, then turns to look at him, one eyebrow raised.
He checked each stall to see if they were empty before locking the bathroom behind them.
(See the end of the chapter for
They finally reach the ballroom and make quick work of leaving, keeping their heads down and both of their hands at their sides. If anyone does happen to see them together at the gala, at least there won't be more rumours being spread about them, or their apparent romantic involvement with one another. After tonight, he doesn't think that Tony's ego would last if someone spread something like that. It was enough that he had called Steve.
"Tony?"
Steve sounded exactly like he did before, and it was so unfair.
"Hi, Tasha. What do you know about a certain Tiberius Stone?  The CEO of Viastone." If his ma were still alive she would have flicked his ear and glared at him as he asked the question. She always hated people that were impolite, and believed that you had to always be polite to a woman. Seeing as it was the twenty-first century and all, he knew that people thought a whole lot more differently, and if he tried to treat Natasha like he was brought up to, she would be less than pleased. So while he tried to treat her like he treated everyone else, habits were hard to break.
She nods and takes a bite of the half of the bagel with the strawberry jam on it and makes her way to the lounge.
He and Pepper actually got on really well, despite the situation that they found themselves in. They had a shared like for all things art and had even gone to the Metropolitan Museum of Art together, with Tony insisting that he tag along. Pepper had simply raised an eyebrow at Tony before whispering in his ear that the closest Tony had come into contact with any art was whenever she bought him pieces for a collection before it went into underground storage never to be seen.
He hoped Steve liked the name Morgan.
of the emotions that seems to be playing a game with him right now.
"You know, I never thought I'd get to have this," Steve said quietly. He's pointedly not looking at Tony, instead looking out at the view of the New York City skyline from the penthouse.
months, so she got used to hearing your voice."
Steve didn't really feel like answering the call, but he knew that it was inevitable. He knew that their friends were waiting on the news seeing as he'd told them of his plans to propose. But all he really wanted was to spend the rest of the evening with Tony in silence. And whenever their friends called it was always so loud and everyone was speaking over one another.
Steve nodded, a tiny smile on his face.
"Really? Lying doesn't suit you, Cap, you're not exactly good at it. Why don't you save it from the professionals and tell me why you really bothered driving to the gala just to pick me up," Tony sneered, crossing his arms.
Next to him, Steve could tell that Tony was giving the entire restaurant a once-over.
The truth is that of course, he wasn't okay with the situation. It's less than ideal for two exes to suddenly come together with whatever baggage they still carried due to their failed relationship and parent a child that they had created by accident right before they broke up.
Natasha sounds oddly amused, and all too knowing when she replies. "Alright, don't kill anyone," she says, sounding downright cheerful.
"I don't need to go medical, Steve. It's fine, I can handle a sprained ankle by myself. I'm a big boy."
Steve doesn't allow the blank look that has now taken over Tony's face to make him feel guilty. He thinks he's done enough of feeling guilty to last a lifetime and isn't this the point?
"You're mad at me, aren't you?" Tony questioned, sounding upset.
He did, however, look up when he heard someone call Steve's name. He turned to look and when he did, he saw a pretty blonde standing in front of the table.
When he stayed silent, Tony carried on.
Back in their apartment, Steve let the sounds of their friends' chatter wash over him as he indulged in the feeling of Tony's body heat seeping into his, happy and grateful to be surrounded by the one he loves.
No, Tony was the one in the wrong here. And okay, yes, he was in the wrong, too, but Tony was the one who was most at fault. And no, he doesn't feel as if he's being petty. He feels as though he's allowed to feel petty just this once, though, and his anger and frustration (and moping - not that he was going to admit that he was moping) was justified.
Doctor Mikhailov allows Steve to visit their daughter on the condition that he uses a wheelchair. She performed the routine checkup - Tony had left the room to give them privacy - and had stated that the serum wasn't healing at its usual rate. Which wasn't something she was too worried about, seeing as Steve's body had gone through the process of housing a baby he wasn't aware of and had had to work twice as hard seeing as Steve hadn't exactly done everything he would need to if he had known he was pregnant. And then there was the actual birth. On top of tearing slightly, Steve had also lost a lot of blood, which explains his pallor and how he still seemed so exhausted.
They hadn't even sat down for ten minutes when a waitress asked them for their orders, giving each of them a bright smile and didn't even blink twice when she realised who they were.
Inside the golden box is individually wrapped truffles. It's extremely tasteful, and, because it's Pepper, Steve has no doubt that they're expensive and made of good quality ingredients.
"Thank you. Guess I'm the luckiest guy to have someone like him as my fiancé," Tony said fondly, glancing at Steve as he did.
What he wouldn't do for a goddamn drink right now. But he promised himself and he promised Steve that he wouldn't. It was better for the team if he wasn't drinking.
Tiberius Stone was going to pay.
He grabs his sunglasses from out of his blazer pocket, slipping it back into place over his eyes and gathers what little belongings he'd brought with him.
. I -"
He'd had his part in the whole ordeal, so he shouldn't leave Steve to fend for himself.
He shrugs. He doesn't want to let on just how annoyed he was at her. Not that she deserved it, of course, but it didn't mean that he didn't have a reason for being annoyed. His friends were talking behind his back. And while it was probably in good faith and in concern for his general well-being, the fact remained that they had still gone behind his back.
She sees him immediately, sending a nod in greeting. He waits for her, and then they walk back to Steve's room together, side by side.
However, she inherited Steve's pouty lips. Which is something that will make it all the more harder for Tony to say no to in the future whenever she asks for something.
The walk to the café was spent in conversation. Or rather, Barnes spoke and Steve laughed, while he tried to make what little conversation he could without seeming like a total idiot.
Stone straightens up. "Nothing, Cap. And you can't prove that I did anything to Tony either, can you? You have no proof. And if this gets out, it's his word against mine. I'm willing to bet that people will be in my favour, especially since this whole situation we're finding ourselves in -" he motions to Tony who's still sitting in the car, oblivious to what's going on just outside the car, "Is normal for him. Tony's always experimented. You can't say that this is anything out of the ordinary. Who's to say that this was him just having some fun and then having taken too much this time? It's happened often enough. And besides, what motive would I possibly have for wanting to drug Tony?" Stone asks, spreading his hands wide.
After that chance meeting where he bumped into Steve, it's suddenly like he happens to be everywhere Tony goes.
In silence.
"Thank you," they said in unison, sitting down at their table.
There was his pride and joy, his sweet girl.
"Well, some of us can't just run away whenever they need to step up and do their job, Steve. Some of us have real jobs to do and sleeping never helped anyone, " he says and takes a small amount of satisfaction at the fleeting look of hurt that crossed Steve's face.
And now Tony was hurt.
He gently pulls Tony towards him and is surprised at how easy Tony falls against his side, trusting. When Tony puts a hand around his forearm and rests his head on his shoulder, he has to tell himself that this is not real, and that it's not right. Because Tony is still mad at him, he's still mad at Tony and this is all not real because someone drugged Tony. He just needed help, and called the first person he knew.
The pile of sandbags had grown significantly since he'd come down to the gym and he felt a surge of guilt at the fact that the money to replace them was coming out of Tony's pocket.
He looks at Steve again. "Did you perhaps get his bottle of water that he drank from? If you have it I can take a sample from it and check what he might've been drugged with." he says, and Steve can just about kick himself for not thinking of that.
Steve shrugged.
So Tony tried. He really did. He tried to get over Steve but how do you get over someone you still love? He even tried to forgive Bucky for killing his parents but nothing worked. He tried to be a good father to Peter but it was difficult without Steve there to tell him how well he was doing when he was feeling low about himself and panicking about being like his own father who didn't even care about him.
he was, analysing the song and tearing it apart, comparing it to the Christmas situation with Steve last year.
Tony gasped, hitting him on the shoulder and he laughed, shoulders shaking.
child.
Getting to the tower doesn't take lots of time, in fact, they reach the tower in five minutes and he immediately let's JARVIS know that he's got Tony and is ready for Bruce to see him.
Just… telling a lie of omission.
They pulled apart, Steve still holding onto his blazer and looking annoyed at the interruption.
"Why?"
He smiles, hands wrapping around Tony's waist.
He smirked, capturing Steve's mouth in a searing kiss, and Steve didn't hesitate to meet him halfway. He was careful not to lean his entire body on Steve, mindful of the precious life that was nestled between them.
As the window leading to the common room slid open, he was immediately drawn to the two figures sitting on the sofa in front of the flatscreen.
The waiter grabbed her tray and tucked it under one arm before looking at them both. "You are both very lucky.
In the background, fucking George Michael was still singing his woes away and, in a fit of frustration and disappointment, he threw a spanner in the air, hitting the wall opposite his workbench.
Steve winced, locking his phone. He looked at Tony.
Tony rolls his eyes. "Okay, one, please never mention those two idiots' names in our bed again and two -"
But he remembers those blue eyes. How, at first, they shone with love, looked so innocent and hopeful, and at the end how they shone with tears and hurt.
It's only after they've finished the main course and are delving into dessert that the other shoe drops.
The doors remained closed.
She's gone in less than a minute and he shakes his head.
They weren't together anymore. Mutual break-up and all.
And when Steve finally pulls away from him, not fully, but a mere couple of inches away just so that he could look him in the eye, Tony allows that, too.
And while he can understand why Sam and Bucky and the rest of the team get so concerned whenever he leaves for a mission - they think that he's going to burn himself out and overdo it - he's
"Right. Well, I've got a movie date with Clint. He's probably bored out of his mind right now. I'm not looking forward to seeing arrows buried in my wall because of boredom. Tell me what Doctor Banner says, and come up to my floor when you're ready. I've got info on Stone," she says.
Steve's sick for almost two weeks, and then when two weeks are over he's as right as rain; cheery and laughing and sassing Tony left, right and center.
He shakes his head.
He places a hand on Natasha's shoulder and gives Steve a brief smile.
The lab that was now under complete blackout mode.
"Which I will not be sharing with the class," Steve echoed, watching as Tony rolled his eyes and sighed.
"Good reviews, huh? Hope it lives up to the hype then. So far they've gotten five points from me. This place has a certain ambience about it that doesn't immediately make me want to run out because of all the snobby rich folk who have no problem with confusing which spoon to use with which dishes," Tony said.
As predicted, at the mention of a date, Tony perked up tremendously, the beginnings of a small smile tugging at his lips and hope shining in his eyes.
He shoots Rhodey a glare and pointedly looks at the entrance to the bank. Rhodey laughs some more and when it's clear that Tony won't budge, he sighs and throws his hands up. "Fine, I'm going, I'm going," he says and walks inside.
"Tony? Sweetheart?" a worried voice asked.
"God, can't you just drop it, Tony? Just leave it!" he shouted.
Sure, Steve looked downright nervous and Tony could just about make out the telltale signs of Steve's guilt when the young nurse - Nurse Hannah, Tony remembered her name - handed their tiny baby to Steve to hold.
Again.
And Steve, despite his words, was not okay.
Tony groaned and Steve laughed, shoulders shaking.
"You know, Steve, you don't have to go out on this mission. I mean, sure, Tony asked you, but I'm pretty sure you're not needed. I know for a fact that Bucky would be happy to go with us on the mission."
*****
And that's more or less when they realize that they have to tell their friends, and by extension, the rest of the world.
"That yawn that I just saw says differently. Try."
After all, they did need to talk.
he said had made it through to the blond.
And secondly, I wasn't the one stringing you along. Is this not what you were planning on doing to me? Or did I get it wrong? Tell me, were you not the one who kissed me first, and then told me that nothing was going to come of it because you and Pepper were on a break? And then, not even two weeks later, you do it again. I'm sorry, did I imagine sleeping with you? Because I'm pretty sure the two of us messed around more than once. And Pepper, does she know about this? Does she know that I was nothing more than your little rebound fling?" Steve bit out harshly, each word sounding more and more bitter and hurtful as they fell out of his mouth.
Tony huffs and rolls his eyes.
Give me a little credit, here, Steve. Don't insult me, I can tell when something's wrong. And I'd like to help."
He doesn't wait for Stone to finish and punches him right in the face, wiping the grin off his face.
Steve gives him a grateful smile in return.
The sound is enough to make his blood run cold and he runs back through the now tiny opening of the still closing lab doors, halting it in its process of shutting behind him.
Was he there so long already? It didn't even feel like half an hour since he'd joined Steve again, and yet it was already six hours later.
He knows he has absolutely no right, no right at all, to feel as hurt as the way that he's feeling right now. And maybe hurt isn't the way to describe the way he's feeling, although hurt is
Apparently, Tony had never introduced anybody to her. Not the way he did Steve at least. And she'd felt a bit like a proud mother when he did that. She told him that while she loved Tony, she also found it difficult to connect with him the way a partner would. Not that there was anything wrong with him, or their relationship, just that Tony had had a lot of things happen to him in his life, many of them to blame for the way he acted and was today. She told him that every single time that she and Tony took a break, she found it more difficult to come back to things the way they were before, and that he was harder to handle. Which is why she feels as though they are better off as friends.
Steve can instantly tell that he's lying.
If he had anything to say about the situation, and boy did he have a lot to say about it - and people would very well listen to what he had to say - then one certain CEO of Viastone would not get to see daylight again.
Thankfully, the sidewalk was basically empty, as it was later in the morning and all, otherwise, he was sure that the blond's belongings would've been kicked all over the place. Now whatever people were milling about the sidewalk just gave them a wide berth, going along their own business. Which is what he preferred, really, not wanting his face to be splashed on page six in the local newspapers for simply knocking someone to the ground. Not that they'd use that reason, of course, they'd claim he was doing something else, picking up someone to spend the night with him, perhaps.
If Tony wasn't falling asleep on him while standing up in a bathroom at a gala that he was currently the one in charge of organising, he would have entertained the idea of getting revenge on Tiberius Stone for a minute.
It wasn't a good feeling, feeling the way he was, but knowing that Tony was willing to be there with him every step along the way, it made him believe that he could take on the world once more.
Well enough by now to see that something was extremely wrong with him.
Now all that he needed to tell Steve was his idea for names for their daughter.
Steve nodded. "I'm exhausted. And..." the blond trailed off, a slight flush on his face.
"Really? Me, stringing
Steve had moved on.
(See the end of the chapter for
He has a child now. A living, breathing person that will depend on him.
"Do you think you'll be able to see what Tony's been drugged with?" he asks. He's oddly nervous, but it's Tony, so all rational thought seems to fly out the window when he's involved in anything.
Not that he's feeling all too calm at the moment, in fact, he's the exact opposite of calm right now.
Steve glares at him. "Wow, Tony. That's such a great thing to say," he says sarcastically and Tony grins, capturing his mouth in a kiss.
If this was how he was feeling, just after being a support system without even
"We're all done here. I'd like to keep him here overnight, just for peace of mind," Bruce is quick to add, "JARVIS can monitor him better from here and should anything happen can notify me immediately. You can go to bed, Steve. I'm sure he'll be fine and you look like you need the sleep."
An hour later and well into a painting of the entire team post-mission, Steve had gotten the phone call from Tony. Tony who was hiding in a bathroom and clearly inebriated.
What causes his amusement to fade, however, is how pale Tony looks.
"Do you make it a habit of bumping into people, Steve, or is it only when the person you're bumping into is me?" he asks and is positively delighted when Steve's face flushes.
He didn't realize that his resolve was so weak when Steve was involved.
to see his facial expressions properly.
Rhodey and Bucky glared at him, and Natasha, who was calmly painting her toenails crimson, stopped what she was doing and scowled.
So he told her everything.
Steve could tell that Tony was pleasantly surprised by his choice of restaurant.
"I could do it by myself. Getting someone in to unpack a few boxes is unnecessary. And besides, I'm nearly finished. All I need to do is pack this away and then I'm done," Steve says.
"Ugh, that's so unfair. The flight back was way too long even with the new plane. Although I'm pretty sure we broke flight regulations with the plane's added speed. Not that they can say anything, of course. If they do, I'll just remind them of all the things that Stark Industries helps fund," Tony said with a self-satisfied smirk.
Which was something that he didn't need.
Bruce sighs, punching the bridge of his nose. He puts his glasses back on and looks over at Tony. When he sees that Tony's drifting off again, he shakes him awake.
Tony was rendered speechless, brain struggling to comprehend the sudden input of information.
When Steve opens his eyes again, they immediately fall onto the pink gift bag from Pepper. He still hadn't opened it yet.
Not even a second later he hears the ding of the elevator as the doors open and Pepper steps inside.
"Tony, come on. No sleeping just yet. We still have to leave, alright? And then you can sleep as much as you want to, okay?" he says, resisting the urge to pull his hand through Tony's hair.
His abrupt change in attitude does little to ease the wariness that lingers, but because he’s a good boyfriend and he doesn’t want to push Tony too far - and sometimes being a good boyfriend means making sure that vultures like Clint can’t get to the other’s food - he moves to leave.
I made it! Okay, so because it's my birthday today, I've decided to post it as a sort've gift. I originally planned to post it when I was halfway through writing chapter 6, but a few people asked when I would be updating and I just couldn't resist. I know, I know, everyone already knows that their daughter's name is Morgan, but these two obviously don't. At least, Steve doesn't. Also, I apologize for any remaining mistakes that I might've missed. The next chapter will be shorter, but only so that I can focus on chapter 7, which will be longer. We will be seeing a nursery soon, and the team will get to meet the newest member. Eventually.
"Yes. Please. I'd like that."
The whole touching thing. The close contact. He never realized how much he missed being warm. Or the fact that he was cold for so long that being warm was strange for him. Steve was warm.
"What did you do to Tony?" he asks. And okay, yes, maybe he shouldn't have accused the man outright, especially since there was no evidence pointing to the man, but he trusted Tony's word. Besides, the man standing in front of him just had a whole feeling about him that screamed 'untrustworthy'.
He had a ton of trouble when it came to convincing Tony that it was his job to listen to him. Because, if not him, then who else would listen to Tony? It was part of being Tony's boyfriend.
Although he had no doubt that Doctor Mikhailov would say the same thing whenever she popped in for a check-up, just using better terms.
He's more than ready to continue to ignore the situation, which in his head equalled to not bumping into Tony to avoid the tension. And then, he didn't even get a chance to put his plan (read: lack thereof) into action because Tony blew it all to hell in a single evening without even meaning to.
Finding Doctor Mikhailov was surprisingly easy.
Really, they were always together.
"Talk to me. What's going on? I can tell something's bothering you."
He turns his head slightly, working his mouth in some semblance of what he hopes is a reassuring smile and directs it at Steve.
Which meant that the A.I. anticipated that something was either about to go wrong, and that one or the other were about to go in for the kill (it used to be said teasingly, before, but now it sounded as if they really were going to kill one another) or that they were going to wreak havoc.
Tony's face falls and his hand drops to his side.
Whether he was uncomfortable or not, this wasn't something they'd planned for, and this was Steve.
"I'm trying! You won't even give me a chance. I can be nice, I swear!" he says. And maybe it came out a bit shrill because the people walking pass all give him strange looks.
To tell him how he felt and how sorry he was.
He gritted his teeth against the barrage of angry words that were threatening to escape his mouth.
"You're very welcome. Enjoy your dessert. Feel free to call me for the bill whenever you're done," she said and parted from their table.
Which is why, when Steve faints at work and Tony finds out by mistake three days later (Natasha had let it slip that Steve fainted. Although, if Tony were being honest, he's pretty sure that Natasha knew
Soon she was done, and then the nurse returned, showing Steve how to burp her.
"No, Tony. I'm not joking. I've loved you for a long time, but I never said anything because you won't know how it feels when the person that you love keeps on telling you that whatever they were doing was never going to be real and was just something temporary. If that was all that I could get from you then I was willing to take it. And I thought I could do it but even I have my limits, and I'm sorry if I hurt you but Sharon and I were never a thing, and you hurt me too, Tony. So much," he says.
Natasha laughs at him and stands, offering a hand and he takes it.
Judging by the bare concern shining in Steve's blue eyes, he probably did a really bad job of it, but he can see that Steve is trying just as hard not to let on that he knows something's up with him. He sees Steve relax and exhales at the sight, his own relief more than palpable.
“I was doing maintenance on Dum-E and Butterfingers must’ve moved the ball harder than necessary because Dum-E chased after it and his wires got tangled up around me. It might not have been as bad if I hadn’t already hurt my ankle in the fight with Doom and his less than intelligent robots.”
Apparently, Tony had no qualms with his idea, seeing as he let himself be pulled along for the ride.
Steve felt Tony's words crash into him like a tank. For his sake, and Tony's, he chose to ignore the nickname that Tony called him. He focused instead on what Tony had admitted. It was extremely unlike him to admit that he didn't feel well, even more that he was scared.
Much love,
He'd done the reading, well, he got FRIDAY to read it out to him while in the shower, but it still counted as him doing research. Whatever Steve was feeling and going through was normal. All people who just gave birth felt this way, some had it worse than others. So yes, at least he could tell Steve this. That whatever he was going through was normal and was okay.
This time it was Steve's chance to roll his eyes.
Tony keeps on rubbing soothing circles on Steve's back, allowing him to calm down slowly and at his own pace.
And for Tony, it seemed too loud. He just needed... he didn't know what he needed anymore. He wanted Steve back. But needing and wanting are two different things.
"Do you want to hold her? I just realized you never - She's your daughter, too. You should hold her," Steve stumbled over the words.
Tony gives their sleeping daughter one last look and then walks over to Steve, standing behind the chair.
"Hey, Steve?"
And let's be honest, there aren't a lot of inches, no matter what Tony says when he's feeling insecure about himself and his physique. (As big as Tony's ego is, his height is incomparable; he's like a tiny adorable kitten that's walking around in an expensive suit).
"Tony, JARVIS is going to tell us if it's safe or not for us to leave the bathroom, okay? If there's no one outside then we can leave, and if there is then JARVIS will make sure that they don't come after you - us, okay? JARVIS always keeps you safe, doesn't he? He looks after you?" he says it softly, praying to whatever godly beings were listening that Tony would trust him on this one and let them leave the bathroom.
God, why had he ever decided to leave the peace of his art studio back at the tower?
Steve, as predicted, is relieved at the good news.
JARVIS turned off the lights and he was asleep in less than a minute.
"I'll be here the entire time. I'll be awake if anything changes, promise. Sleep, Steve," Tony says. He brushes a couple of stray strands of hair out of Steve's face and smiles at him.
Nurse Hannah leaves them to it, giving Tony a respectful nod and goes back to doing whatever it was that she was doing before.
"Hello, Sir. Captain Rogers is indeed correct. There is no one outside the bathroom and should anyone try to come into contact with you, I'll make sure they leave straight away. You're in safe hands, Sir," JARVIS' voice is oddly gentle for something that isn't living, and once again, he's reminded of just how clever Tony was to create something like JARVIS.
And then the meeting was over and he had to watch Steve leave with Barnes and Wilson, laughing with them at something stupid Barnes seemed to be showing them on his cellphone.
It didn't make everything between them right again, and he needs to get that straight.
Tony couldn't help but flinch, humiliation burning and spreading through his veins like hot lava. He felt guilty at the mention of Pepper, and the fact that he had used Steve as a rebound fling. At first (and yes, he knew that it was disgusting, but he needed a distraction and if Steve was willing to provide one, then he'll take it) he
Steve raises an eyebrow and he deflates.
He wants to hide the bag in the far corner of the kitchen cabinet, somewhere where he can't find it.
"I might, you know, for a price. Give me some time to think about it," Tony said, pretending to think.
Yes, their daughter was being held back because she couldn't breathe properly. Was it Steve's fault? No. This was out of his hands.
"Oh, don't pretend you haven't noticed all the looks you get whenever we step out together. Women and teenage girls in the street stop and stare at you whenever you walk past. And I've seen a few men, too! You know you're wanted, right?" she says with a teasing tone of her own, eyes twinkling in the artificial light of the boardroom.
Tony's got a look in his eye that he immediately dislikes. Tony's not going to make this any easier on him.
As soon as his bare foot touches the floor he can't help but let out a shiver; it was freezing in the guest room.
Steve hummed noncommittally.
Their conversation was interrupted when the waiter placed a silver dish before Tony. "Your dessert, Sir," the waiter said with a polite nod.
"What if I was some - some madman? What if I decided to kidnap you? It's not a joke, Tony! This is your life that we're talking about!" Steve is still scolding him and he's getting a tad bit uncomfortable.
Apparently, Steve's not one of those people that fall for his wit and charms that easily and refuses to get with the program because his scowl deepens and he crosses his arms.
"I know."
Steve's sad? Make him smile. Steve wants to see an art exhibition? Buy tickets and clear out an entire museum. Steve's angry? Make a joke to make him bring out that smile of his that says 'I'm mad at you so I shouldn't be laughing but I can't help myself'.
There was simply no winning this one. He couldn't break down the doors; he knew how difficult they were to break (they didn't) because he built them. And he knew that JARVIS couldn't be overridden because he was fulfilling the reason for which he was built: looking our for his creator.
"I slept every night, Tony. And shouldn't I be asking you that, Mister 'I'll sleep when I'm dead'?" he retaliated. He was skirting around the question, and he knew that Tony wasn't buying it, but he really wasn't up for playing twenty questions tonight.
. It's cute, and he feels fondness settle in his chest at the thought of his little baby. She was still so small, and yet, he can't help but feel so much love for her. It was overwhelming and at the same time, he couldn't deny that it felt right, having her. She was his and for so long he denied the fact that he wanted something like her in his life, he denied the fact that he yearned for something Morgan-sized and denied his sadness and anger at the fact that he couldn't have children.
saying.
rich. And you also know which spoons go with which dishes." Steve raised an eyebrow at the irony of Tony's words.
"Hi, Doctor Banner. I - yes. No, he's extremely out of it. His pupils are blown and he's clearly been drugged with something, suffering from gaps in his memory. It's - it looks bad, but maybe I'm just being paranoid. I was hoping you could take a look at him when we get back to the tower?"
His mind was plagued with thoughts of what his life could be like if he wasn't forced to crash the plane into the Arctic.
They walked further into the building and carried on with banking.
Tony blinked. He only understood part of what she had said but didn't want to make a fool of himself by assuming something.
It's nice to know that she likes him enough to let him call her that, and the knowledge that she thinks of him as someone she can call a friend (not that she couldn't before, but now she trusts him a bit better) warms someplace deep in his chest.
Tony frowned at the question and tilted his head to the side.
By then he's noticed that Tony is long gone and they're the only ones in the boardroom.
All too soon, their time with their daughter is over and they have to leave. For Tony, it's a bitter-sweet moment and a part of him wants to resist when the nurse takes her from his arms. But then he sees the way Steve watches as Nurse Hannah puts their daughter - their so very tiny daughter - in the too-big incubator and he feels a deep pang of sorrow for the soldier.
Not that it stayed that way for long. Tony was the first to pull away, slightly out of breath and looking even more dishevelled.
Because in a perfect world, Steve would be getting to take their daughter home with them instead of watching her being put in the incubator for the night.
When Tony nods slowly, he struggles to contain the grin that threatens to break out across his face. It can't have been that easy, could it?
go on that mission?" he asked. He knew what Steve's answer would be.
"Can you move, please, I need to get back to my floor," he says.
They let their phones ring until it stopped, and then Steve finally picked up his phone, opening his text messages.
He takes a deep breath, holding it in and counts backwards from ten. When he deems himself calm enough, he stares at Stone, narrowing his eyes and crosses his arms.
When there's silence on the other end, he puts his phone away in his pocket with a sigh, only then realising that Natasha hadn't given him any information on Stone.
From the tinny voice on the other end of the line, he can distinguish Bruce's confusion and slight worry. He thanks the supersoldier serum for his enhanced hearing and motions for Tony to hand him the phone, which Tony does with a pout.
"Of course I know that, I'm Tony Stark. I'm freaking awesome. I'll make coffee every day if it means a pre-breakfast makeout session," Tony said with a slight scoff to which Steve rolled his eyes.
Steve nods his head, but he only has eyes for the baby in his arms.
Tony takes the elevator and rides up to the penthouse, planning on taking a quick shower to refresh himself and then grabbing some coffee. Maybe a breakfast muffin if he felt like it.
It's like a dam had suddenly broken and all of Steve's worry and sadness and pain was too strong and Tony's words had been his breaking point because Steve just… lets go.
When they finally sleep together (shocker! It only happens after date number six. If the rest of the world knew that Tony Stark hadn't just bedded someone without all the dating in between they'd die of shock) there's nothing special leading up to it.
Tony swallows his mouthful of cake and can practically feel it turning to lead as it settles in his stomach.
In less than five minutes he was dressed, and he kissed Tony goodbye, wishing him good luck for his business trip.
"Thanks, Cap. I won't be able to help much since I'll be at SI when you guys are on the mission, but FRIDAY will be able to should you need it. Just ask her for anything. I'll be back in time for a debriefing," Tony says.
CEO of Viastone and also Tony's ex.
He couldn't believe that he had a hand in creating something so pure and innocent as her.
"Pepper, just stop. Why does it matter? Steve and I are dating, there really isn't much to it."
"Hi, Tony. How was your flight?" he asked, moving back until his back was against the headboard.
Right.
It's only when Pepper grabs the cheque (and he grabs it from her to take one of the coffee-flavored sweets inside) that one of the waiters touches his forearm, gesturing towards the cheque book and winking at Pepper does he open it. Inside is a hastily scribbled note.
"Oh. I - I think I was at the bar. I was getting a bottle of water and there was someone sitting there. I can't remember. Steve, I can't remember. Why can't I remember?" Tony started breathing heavily, eyes looking wild and panicked.
But it wasn't something he wanted for
"Of course you will, Sir. Check should be done in five," she said and he sobered up, fingers moving quickly across six different holograms all at once.
He grins at the boldness of the blond. And then frowns. Just a tiny bit good looking? Excuse you, Steve, Tony was the
"I'm going to ask you what that last bit means because even though I caught some of it, I don't understand everything you just said." Tony looked at their waiter for an explanation.
“I actually called because I have big news... Great news! Surprising news, hold on to your butts!”
Tony steps in. “Yep, this is purely a social call. You see, Steve and I have entered into a romantic relationship, and since we’re all living together, we figured it made sense to tell everyone.”
“Tony I’m… I don’t know what I’m doing. I’m not really even sure what “as much or as little” even means. I think I’m probably most comfortable having you tell me what that is in more detail? And um, you probably already noticed I don’t mind you taking the reins?”
It’ll probably never happen, but it’s a nice little dream. Cosy by the fire, maybe roast some marshmallows… a real dream about Tony, not what he’s had to cling to these last months. Him and Tony, together.
His eyes widen in panic as a thought occurs to him - Jesus, what if she’s
Tony shrugs and slides his hands up to the base of Steve’s neck. He cups the strong muscle there, grounding himself.
Tony focuses on the last of the code which simulates splattering blood and bites his tongue. He knows better than anyone that people change, and that Thanos was a master manipulator, but he’s never going to tell Thor Loki is forgiven for New York. Thor has regaled them a few times over the last six weeks with how Loki attempted to kill Thanos in the end, choosing to save Thor and sacrifice his own life.
“My first impulse is to tell you that you seem to really care about Becky, and that whatever is going on with Tony, it’s not really worth jeopardizing what you have.”
Tony winks, and presses some of the small gold tubes of lube into Steve’s hands, turning around on the platform to address the shower “Cleaning mode 3.”
It’s one of the best nights in the city Steve has ever had.
Tony closes his eyes and nods. Fuck.
He knows he should tell Tony to see a doctor anyway. Bruce is a genius, but he isn’t actually a medical doctor. He tries to get the words out but his whole chest has gone tight. Tighter than it was during any of his old asthmatic episodes.
“No I fucking do not! I’m just going to grab a quick shower and… unwind a bit, and then come back to bed and snuggle you into my $50,000 mattress, deal?”
Rocket shrugs as if Tony doesn’t have a say. “You’re still using nano-tech! We give nano-tech to babies! It’s practically useless after a year with the degradation factor, and then you’re left with a total mess.”
Steve sobers. “I… honestly with everything I haven’t given that a lot of thought.” Steve is silent for several moments. “I think getting everyone back together, soothing the tensions our conflict has sewn; that will be step one. I’d like to keep us, just for
Steve shudders and gratefully does as instructed. Once again, his dreams have stoked his desire for what he’s doing, but the actual mechanics of it feel unfamiliar. He starts with just the head, getting used to the feel of it in his mouth, swiping at it with his tongue, slowly moving down a little and then back up. Then a little further, working out how to find a rhythm and breath at the same time. Since the serum anything that requires physical aptitude seems to come to him like second nature, and he’s relieved when after a few minutes he’s able to bob up and down on Tony’s erection with ease, further testing what combinations of pressure, suction, swallowing and licking Tony seems to like the most.
Steve smiles, “No pressure, I know you’re all-in with the team, and I know everything with Pepper only happened a few months ago. I just want you to know I’m not going anywhere, no matter what.”
Tony exhales heavily against Steve’s mouth. “Yes”
Steve shakes Tony’s shoulder a few minutes before landing; he doesn’t want the jostling of the plane hitting the tarmac to be what rips Tony from his peaceful slumber.
“Going up - Penthouse.”
Tony throws the pad down on the bed and manages to beat Steve to the shower again, even though he knows the way this time.
been a difficult time…”
“Tony, no.” Steve’s hands come up, god he wants to grab ahold of Tony’s hips and pull him in. He wants to rub his face over those soft-looking pants and reassure Tony that the only thing he wants, is Tony.
Tony. Nothing he’s done with Becky has meant as much to him as his almost kiss with Tony.
That he’s weak, that he isn’t in charge, that he’s powerless.
He confidently palms Tony’s erection, sliding up and down as he leans forward to kiss Tony’s neck, ears, hairline. Tony arches up into his touch but doesn’t move his hands.
He is about to set up his towel when he sees Steve emerge onto the deck and take the stairs down to the beach. He’s smiling but it looks kind of strained as he hurries out on to the beach towards Tony’s location.
Steve pistons his fingers in and out with more pressure, stretching, sliding, trying to find that sensitive place…
like a blueberry.
He starts at the bottom, picking up Steve’s foot, lovingly scrubbing between the toes, around the ankle and up, and up until he’s at that delicious juncture between Steve’s torso and leg. A harsh V of muscle points like a fucking beacon to Steve’s aching cock. Tony bites that juncture, teasing, before moving on and away down to the other foot.
to say something.
“Tony. You have had a crush on Captain America practically your whole life. You had Captain America bed sheets in college! You've been mooning over him for
Steve rubs the back of his neck, he forgot. “Ah, yes so one more thing to know is that there is a code that will automatically stop all action. The code is “I heart New York.”
But Steve isn’t moving, or scoffing at Tony’s blatant impropriety. In fact he’s… uhh, he’s looking… at Tony’s crotch?
He slides the gauntlet on and gasps. Sparking lines of power emanate from the stones, through the glove and up his arm. He drops to his knees.
to be here. I slept fine, so stop stressing. Has the doctor been yet?" he asked.
They believed him and let him go with a chorus of 'goodbyes' and 'goodnights'.
"Tony, what are you talking about?" he asks slowly.
He feels himself panic, and his heart feels heavy all of a sudden. Because he didn't tell Tony that tonight, it was something that he'd whispered to Tony after, when they were laying in bed all sweaty and glowing. Tony had gone still and then scoffed. But he had seen the happy look that Tony's face had made. His promise hadn't been fulfilled then, because not even two days later Tony catches him having dinner with Sharon.
His view of Tony is obscured by Bruce who is now standing in front of him, cleaning his arm with an antiseptic wipe
Steve's turned away from him, probably so that Tony couldn't see the inner turmoil that's shown so clearly on his face, but he's still too close to Tony for Tony
"I'm in love with you, you idiot. I was trying to sort through everything in my head before I decided to do anything, but I guess you picked up on it. I'm sorry that I made you worry, Tony."
After, when the doors opened up to the floor where the boardroom was, it had hurt seeing Steve practically flee the elevator and he had to swallow against the lump in his throat.
Stone cokced his head, looking confused. "Me, Captain? I haven't done anything to Tony."

Tony was his main priority. He was willing to put aside his own annoyance and anger at Tony from their argument and focus on the state that Tony was in.
Which, is it really all that important? Why go through all the effort to go to the bank when you can do it online?
Wait, who the fuck was he kidding? He definitely deserves this for breaking Steve's heart.
"Hey, Cap. You can put him down over there. You say he was drugged?" Bruce asks.
Steve gathered that it was finally time for what he'd spent copious amounts of time planning.
"Good morning, Tony. I wasn't here all night, promise. I slept for a bit but couldn't sleep any longer and lying in bed wasn't cutting it for me. I realized that there were still a few more things to pack away before Morgan comes home and here I am."
"Of course. Guess I should've thought of that. I do have a meeting after all. And Pep will kill me if I fall asleep during the negotiations," Tony says.
"Steve, Bruce and I were busy talking. Why did you cut the call? That's not nice, Stevie," Tony whined and he had to hold back a chuckle before he did anything stupid like laugh at how adorable Tony was behaving in this moment.
Two hours later, and more than three-quarters of his book done, his eyes were beginning to blur and slip shut by themselves.
And if it meant that he had to get cans of pain-relieving spray or ice packs or even some of the pills he and Bruce had worked on to help when the pain Steve was in was too much for him to handle, then he would do it.
He opened his eyes, ignoring the blurriness and telltale stinging before muttering a muffled curse.
," Tony hears Steve mutter the last part to himself but he stays silent, choosing instead to watch as Steve scolds him. Not that he could say anything, he was literally stunned into silence.
"This place looks amazing. How did you even get a booking for it?" Tony asked as soon as the mâitre d' was out of earshot, glancing at the interior with a critical eye.
The tweet was already waiting to be sent, one simple line that would have a major impact on their lives from now on:
He stares for a couple of seconds, and then decides against saying anything.
"Steve?" Tony let loose a shaky breath. "Tony, you called," Steve said in disbelief. The tone of his voice was happy, and just a tiny bit worried and confused.
Steve tried to pull away when Tony struggled to reply, but then Tony finally got with the program and pulled Steve closer to him, wrapping his arms around Steve's waist.
Outside the night is cooler, and Steve feels as though he can breathe easier. He ignores the parking valet and takes his car keys, heading towards his car. Tony follows along obediently, not questioning anything or even where Steve was leading him. It's strange to think that Tony was willing to trust him so fully, but he's not looking to change that. He hopes that Tony realises that he's one more person that he has in his corner.
Luckily the person ducks just in time and he brings his fist down to his sides.
The woman smiled at Steve and bent down to give him a kiss on the cheek before sitting down next to him.
At dinnertime, he was silent, only speaking when spoken to. He listened to the others' stories, laughing whenever they said something funny. At least at this hour, unlike this morning when he went out on his run with Sam his actions weren't mechanical. They were real.
Steve grins at the cute dress in his hand; it's pink and so, so tiny. He's sure that Morgan will look adorable in it. He allows himself to wonder how she'll look in it when he gets her from the med floor.
Tony brushes his fingers through Steve's hair until the blond's eyes fall shut.
At least he managed to phone Bruce and get him to prepare the medbay for when he and Tony arrived back at the tower. Over the phone Bruce had sounded calm - he purposely ignores the thought that he might have disturbed the scientist from his daily yoga session and angered him - but he could sense the distinct note of worry in his tone, and was quick to placate the man, lest he turns into his mean green alter ego. After all, Tony wasn't as bad as he had seemed earlier when he first got to the man, and seemed happier and less panicked at the moment, although at the rate Tony's behaviour had changed from one state to the next, he wasn't banking on the fact that Tony would stay in the joyful mood he was in, no matter how much he wanted Tony to.
In the end, they were the ones who had to deal with it.
body is achy. I never thought it possible, but apparently, it is." Steve said.
"Steve, how was he when you first found him? Any speech impairments? You said that he told you he was feeling dizzy and that his head hurt," Bruce asks him and he nods.
"We're sorry, Tony," she looks at Rhodey and Rhodey nods before looking at Tony, "We just worry. We don't want to see you hurt again."
Sometimes, he wondered if his friends really knew him.
Tony nodded vigorously, swallowing thickly.
"Why are you comforting me? I've said some real shitty things to you and you're still comforting me. Why?" he asks finally, gaze imploring.
"I'm not asking you, Tony, I'm telling you. And right now I'm not liking the way your ankle is swollen. Maybe if you'd told me about your ankle earlier then we could've forgone going to medical, but you didn't and now your ankle has swelled even more. I won't ask anyone else to help you, because I know you and you hate medical," he says as he grabs hold of Tony's waist and slowly lifts them up.
Instead, it sounded like she was almost encouraging him to get back at that prick that drugged Tony.
He slips his card to the waiter and the waiter nods at him, walking away with the cheque.
The short blond was sitting right at the back of the coffee shop where it was probably quieter, body turned towards the window and his head bent over a book. It's only after watching him for a few seconds longer, that he recognizes the leather-bound book and that Steve seems to be drawing in it.
He hated that this is what they've become; Tony hiding in his workshop and flying halfway around the world to be at meetings in countries that didn't even allow him to adjust to the different time zones before he had to leave for the next country, while he tired himself out going on missions that lasted three days minimum.
Great, so not only was Tony high and feeling sick but he was also experiencing hallucinations where Ty was coming after him and in the room with him.
that? I would never - I wouldn't hurt our daughter. Ever," Steve sounded so sure, so horrified of the prospect of doing something to intentionally hurt their daughter, that Tony couldn't help but pull him a little closer.
"Yeah, Tony was slurring a bit, much like he did just now. Uh, he said that his head hurt and that he was feeling dizzy. And he also seemed to be hallucinating. He thought that there was someone else with us in the bathroom." He glances over to Tony who's shut his eyes again.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Yes! Come Steve, I want to see Brucie-bear now." Tony rights himself, whatever tiredness that was marring his features suddenly gone and excitement lighting up his face. He tugs insistently on Steve's hand and is instantly frustrated when Steve doesn't budge when he tries to pull him.
"JARVIS, send Rhodey and Pepper a voice message. Tell them I say enjoy the holidays, and send your family my greetings. Tell them to - tell them to stay longer, god knows they need a vacation."
Surprisingly, Steve participates and wraps his arms around Tony's waist.
Steve laughed, throwing his own hands in the air. It was ironic, considering what Tony had just said before.
"Coming?" she calls.
"Leave what, Steve? The fact that you look like you're about to drop dead? You look exhausted. JARVIS, how much has Steve slept while I was away?" Tony asked, looking at him while he waited for a response from the A.I.
He blinks, stepping back and holds up his hands and he can feel a bright hot flush spread through his body.
Stone deserved getting punched in the face.
"Here," he handed Steve his phone, "Just give me your number. In case I need to call you or something."
Steve nods, a pained wince on his face. "Yeah, I'm good."
Tony laughs. "Yeah, but you're stuck with me. I promised the good doctor that I'll be here if you need me, remember?"
"Hi," Tony whispered, mouth curving up into a small smile.
And then when it was time for supper and the takeaway boxes were all strewn about the coffee tables in the communal living room in front of the big screen and Tony still wasn't there, he went down to the lab to retrieve Tony.
"I want a divorce. Lies and slander right here, under my own roof.  JARVIS, did you hear that? Steve says that I'm not a delight," Tony complained loudly, holding a hand to his heart.
Doctor Mikhailov gave him a look of sympathy and they carried on walking in silence.
Tony turned to look at him, brown eyes glowing golden in the light of the bedside lamp. He didn't say anything for a while, eyes scrutinising every inch of him.
"Steve," Tony says sounding all confused again, "Stevie, my head still hurts. Why is it hurtin'? Can you call Pepper? She's always gotta headache pill for me. She's the - the best. You'll love her." Tony states matter-of-factly.
Tony thought that he had a hard time watching Steve. Just… in general. It was a problem for him right after they'd broken up. Half the time he found himself staring at Steve whenever the blond wasn't looking at him and then he'd catch himself, internally having to remind himself that he and Steve weren't together anymore and that Steve didn't belong to him. It got easier over time, after he started to spend more time at the company and attend more meetings that required him to fly to another country.
The second time he sees Steve is at the coffee shop he likes to frequent. Pepper had practically dragged him with her for the next company meeting and surprise of all surprises, it happened to be at his favorite coffee shop.
"You! I'm talking about you! You're all quiet and just - do you even want to be here? I'm trying to see this from a logical point of view, but I can't. Why do you waste your time spending it with me of all things?" Tony asked, managing to sound exasperated and frustrated and insecure all at once.
"Sure thing, Princess. Just -" he stuck a hand in his pocket, looking for his cellphone.
His hair was all messed up from where he had pulled at it earlier and his face, which usually held a smile just for Tony, was closed off, sending a message that screamed 'unapproachable'.
And Tony didn’t tell him.
Maybe he deserved this.
He had to think quickly. He needed to get Tony out of the bathroom. But first, he needed Tony to trust him. And because Tony thought that someone was going to come after him, it didn't seem as if getting him out of the bathroom was something that was going to happen anytime soon.
Despite his earlier exhaustion and the horrible thoughts that had flicked through his mind, he managed to smile back. He was really glad that Tony was home.
His eyes burned and it was only then that he realised that he was crying.
Tony seems to be on board with discontinuing the disaster they were heading towards in conversation and steers it in the opposite direction.
Everyone else who ever comforted him was only pretending. They never wanted to comfort him, they only ever wanted something from him.
So he shakes his head and huffs out a laugh.
sorry that I left you to freeze. Can you find it in your heart to forgive me?" Steve apologized with a grin. He grabbed a bottle of water and hid a smile at how his comment made Tony's pout grow even further.
The sight of the wires that are connected to his daughter makes Steve even more scared to hold her closer than before, but holding her in his arms, against his skin is soothing. It feels natural, familiar.
"Leave the booking to me. Just be ready by seven. And wear something nice," Steve told him.
Steve looks him in the eyes when he answers.
"What do you think you're doing, you stupid bag of bolts? Back to the charging station with you."
And travel it did.
And while Ty was the one to put whatever drug he had chosen in Tony's drink, he was sure that Ty wasn't the only one in this. From what little Tony had told him of Ty, it didn't sound as if he could pull something like this off without the help of someone else. Someone else who had a grudge against Tony.
When Tony speaks, it's as if he's finally caught on to what Steve's been doing because he nods.
good-looking man in the world. Just ask Rolling Stones. He was voted hottest man three years in a row.
The sip of coffee he had taken goes down the wrong pie and he chokes, spilling the rest of the coffee down his front.
In which Steve and Tony have an awkward meeting to discuss the recent mission, ignore the elephant in the room, and Steve finally gives birth.
Tony's eyes are still wide and he licks his lips nervously before biting at his bottom lip.
Publisher021
Tony nods reluctantly, and despite telling himself to gain distance away from Tony, he reaches out a hand and smooths a loose curl away from Tony's eye, rubbing his finger along his face.
Which, yeah, the entire team could agree with. To be woken up by an A.I. that, for all intents and purposes, was never supposed to do more than help people and greet them calmly and politely, it
She turns to look at him, and, if he looked long and hard enough, he's able to see the worry on her face, but, since Natasha is extremely good at what she does and he doesn't want to spend forever trying to understand what it is exactly that she's thinking (the effort is wasted, as soon as he thinks he knows what she's thinking she proves him wrong), he can only make out the slight furrow in her perfectly sculpted eyebrows.
, and
When he arrived at the gala, dressed in nothing but his jeans and leather jacket, shoving through the crowd to get to Tony who just so happened to be hiding in the bathroom right by the back entrance to the hall, he understood.
And who will only continue to suffer, seeing as they weren't together anymore and now had to parent a daughter that they had together.
But as it were, he had to think of what that would do to his reputation (not that he really cared about it all too much at this point, actually) but also to Tony's reputation.
It mostly worked, but only because he kept on looking out the window to avoid looking at Steve whenever the blond smiled or laughed at the ridiculous antics of his two teammates.
There was a big difference.
"Steve, what did you do?" Natasha doesn't sound accusatory, whereas if the question came from someone else it would, and he'd have bristled. If anything, he feels like he should do something to Stone just for even thinking of drugging Tony.
"I'm great, doc. Although, something tells me the only thing that won't be great is my sleep schedule for the next couple of years. Good thing I don't sleep much. Means I don't miss out on much sleep. Huh, everyone always told me I needed to sleep more. They never wanted to believe me when I said I don't need it. Guess I was right," he murmurs the last part to himself, almost thoughtfully.
"Take him to Bruce, Cap. I'm sure the good doctor is tired of waiting by now. I know I am," she says and he nods, walking down the hallway that leads to the medbay, Natasha following.
As far as the baby's resemblance to her parents, she seems to have inherited the Stark genes; she's got a dark head full of hair - which Tony knows from the research he's done that it will start to fall out and thin before growing back in again - and brown eyes.
Tony got up from their bed and moved to his walk-in closet, rummaging inside for a shirt that would match the suit pants that he wore. It was only as he was pulling the shirt on and buttoning up the buttons that he noticed Steve watching him.
He felt himself growing angry as Tony pushed.
He would do anything for Steve.
"I did promise, didn't I? Okay, hiw about you sleep here tonight, no, I will not be sleeping here in the medbay with you -" he didn't think he could stand to be in such close proximity with Tony any longer. He'd reached his daily quota two and a half hours ago. "Tomorrow when you wake up, I'll be waiting right here for you. How does that sound?"
Steve sent him a grateful smile.
The wheelchair was lying abandoned near the doorway, waiting for when Steve had to return to his room.
His blood pressure rises significantly higher than what it had been earlier on when Tony had explained to him what had happened and it's only when he thinks of Tony who is sitting in the passenger seat of his car that he keeps himself calm.
He searched Steve's face for any sign that there'd been a breakthrough, that somehow,
In the interim of her and Tony's mutual break (now Steve knew that it wasn't so much as a break than a kinder way of saying they were ready to break up with one another) right before his and Steve's argument in the lab, they'd gone on an unofficial date. Well, Tony had told Rhodey that he and Steve were going to spend some time together and might get lunch or dinner.
"So? Who's the little spitfire? You get Blondie's number?" Rhodey questioned.
Steve's glare at his previous comment faded away and a small smile took its place.
He worked up the courage to smile back at Tony. "Morning, Tony. And no, you didn't wake me. I usually wake up this time for my run with Sam," he said.
When Steve's eyes open, he gives Tony a pained smile.
He rushes through the motions of cleaning himself, then he towels himself dry and grabs any clothing from his closet that looks comfortable.
He sat up, eyes flitting around the room until they noticed Tony.
"Good morning Tony," his therapist greeted warmly before pulling him into a hug. He was still getting used to the whole hugging thing but if he was honest with himself, he liked it. He missed having Steve hug him. And any hug, even if it was from his therapist, was welcome because it made him feel loved again, and not as if he was only there for the sole purpose of paying for things.
Dum-E, who was in the corner of the lab, hiding from the two of them in fear, beeped shrilly.
With those words, he can feel himself breathe easier.
Bucky and Natasha would be upset that Steve never thought of telling them first.
"Hey, Stark! You wanna watch with us?" Bucky called, pausing the movie they were watching.
He sighed, moving to answer the group call.
He's stunned that Steve had the audacity to speak to him like that and behind him, he can hear Rhodey snickering. He totally forgot that Rhodey was with.
"Shut up, I'm trying to make a point here. The thing is that I love you. A lot. And it used to scare me before, but now it doesn't."
He watched as the blond bowed his head, playing with his fingers that were laid in his lap.
Tony reached forward and thumbed a rolling tear away, looking Steve in the eyes. He
"You know what, maybe if you weren't such a goddamn ass then you'll find that people really do care about you! But no, you push them away and then question someone when they try to help you despite your shitty attitude. Build a bridge and get over it, Tony. I came to come get you because it was the right thing to do," he spits out.
"Yeah, baby, I did," Tony said, his voice coming out shaky and choked up. He felt a stinging behind his eyes and he blinked rapidly. "What's wrong?" Steve asked and Tony just couldn't do it anymore.
He's just coming back from his mission of getting to the kitchen without catching anyone from the team's attention and getting a fresh pot of coffee, and is about to step into the lab when JARVIS stops him.
Tony raises an eyebrow, and Steve quiets, settling down once more.
He follows and they settle themselves on the sofas with their assembled dinners in their laps.
Tony glared at him. "Don't call him that. He has a name. And of course I got his number, what do you take me for, an amateur?"
Tony felt a surge of panic take hold of him, but he managed to suppress it enough to urge Steve to hand her over.
It was a Moroccan blend, one that Steve discovered while on a mission and had brought back home. They'd tried it and surprisingly, Tony liked it, and whenever the blend was coming to the last little bit, Tony had it imported.
He wasn't even aware that they had bagels in the tower.
The room is dark when Tony wakes up, and he's extremely glad for the blinds that block out the light of day. He's pretty sure that it's early morning, but with the lack of light, it's hard to distinguish exactly what time it is.
All too soon, Sam stands with a look of regret on his face and gives them a smile that could easily pass as a grimace.
"Congratulations, punk! And good luck to you, Stark. Wouldn't wanna be saddled with that idiot for the rest of my life but you do you," Bucky said, grinning madly. Sam rolled his eyes.
"Tony, I promised Pepper and Rhodey that I'll stay by your side through both your bad days and your good days. I'll admit that I might've gotten a talk from Rhodey and Pepper had a whole speech prepared when she realized we were dating. We've gone through stupid arguments and given each other the silent treatment and for not one moment after each of those were done did I ever doubt that you were still mine. And if I did happen to push you too much and you wanted to walk away, I promised myself that I'd find a way to make you stay. I love what we have right now, but I'd like it to last forever. So will you marry me and be mine?" Steve asked, heart beating a mile a minute as he waited for Tony to respond to his question.
Tony didn't seem particularly happy with his lack of answer because he huffed in annoyance.
And he loved them. He supposes that he loves them because it's Steve, and he loves everything about Steve, so that's not really something to point out.
He can only watch as Natasha cuts her bagel in half and spreads cream cheese on one side, and strawberry jam on the other.
"I always dress to impress, sunshine," Tony said, grinning as he took a bite from his waffle.
The longer the silence stretches, the more he feels as if he should be doing something about it. Steve seems unsure, insecure. It's so far removed from the Steve that he usually sees; sassy and sarcastic. Confidant.
"Only about a million times, Tony. Also, I suggest you answer Pepper," Steve said. He looked pointedly at Tony's phone where it had lit up, no doubt due to Pepper texting him about the little stunt that he had pulled.
"Dinner? Where are we going? And on such short notice all the restaurants will be booked seeing as everyone seems to have the same idea for Valentine's Day. We won't get a booking anywhere," Tony pointed out.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony grimaced and locked eyes with Steve who looked just as horrified.
He raises an eyebrow, draping the towel around his neck.
This chapter is dedicated to all the people who stuck with this while I wrote exams and generally abandoned this fic because of RL. I love you all, and I'm grateful to each and every one of you for your patience and kindness for waiting until I could update again.
that Steve blamed himself, and if there's something that Steve shouldn't be doing right now, it's blaming himself.
He understands that Sam and Clint need to leave to be with their own families, and he and Sam weren't that close, anyway, but he kinda expected Rhodey and Pepper to tell him that they were leaving at least two weeks before. Give him some time to adjust and plan so that he doesn't look like he's alone and wallowing in his own self-pity.
"Hi, Sharon. Sorry, I- Need to leave. Just remembered that I have- Pepper sent me a few documents that I have to sign before eight. I need to leave. It was nice meeting you, Sharon. Sorry," he rambled, hastily standing up and almost tripping over his own feet before Barnes pulled his chair in.
Tony leans back in the hard plastic chair that he now thinks of as his own and spares a quick glance at the time on his phone, noticing that it was already one in the afternoon.
Finally, I feel like I can breathe again! Ugh, I feel like the last I've updated was five years ago. So not cool. In regards to this fic, there isn't much plot, as it goes, but it is essential to the fic. Of course, because it's me, there's slight angst and negative thoughts, but it will get better, promise!
Steve and Tony could sort their own goddamn problems out.
"No, I - No, Tony, sweetheart, you never said anything bad, okay? We can talk about this later. For now, you need to tell Bruce how you're feeling, and then we can leave this place and you can sleep for as long as you like. How's that sound?" he asks, and he's more than aware that his own voice sounds shaky and hoarse, but Tony's too engrossed in dialling Bruce from Steve's cellphone that he doesn't hear.
He never realized how good it was to laugh and let himself go after dealing with everything that happened last night. It felt like he'd been walking on eggshells the entire time, too afraid to say or do the wrong thing. Laughing was freeing, and he felt like a huge weight had been lifted from his shoulders.
"How's our resident genius doing?" she asks, worry shining in her green eyes. She rubs a hand against Tony's face before scratching at his scalp with her fingernails. She stops when Tony's nose scrunches up and he tucks his face into Steve's chest. She raises an eyebrow and steps back once more, a smirk on her face.
He scowled, unable to take it anymore.
"How could I say no to that? Such a sappy speech. And I can't believe you proposed with a candy heart. Unbelievable," Tony said, shaking his head in disbelief.
who bumped into him this time.
"No, nope. Listen to me. I'm talking now." If he told Steve that he loved him a long time ago, then maybe Steve might not have felt this way. He feels the familiar feeling of guilt lodging in his chest and vows to never make Steve feel this way again.
When Steve glances at the alarm clock he's not surprised to find that it's still early. He's been trying to go back to sleep for more than an hour and has completely given up on sleep, feeling too antsy and like he was too small for his skin.
When he snickers again at the sheer ridiculousness of his own insane thoughts, he realizes that he can make out whirring noises coming from the corner of his workshop where DUM-E was stationed.
"I hate you so much right now, JARVIS. When you realise that you've made a mistake and unlock the doors the two of us are going to be having a long discussion about disobedience and what it means to mind your own business," he mutters.
Which is why he's so hesitant to meet up with the rest of the team. He doesn't want to face questions on whether or not he and Tony are going to parent her together, or even worse, questions on whether or not he was okay with all of this.
"Wait, what? Oh, I get it. Must be a Valentine's Day special that they're doing or something. It's kinda cute. And I love candy hearts. Guess it's my lucky day after all," Tony said, staring at the candy heart that stated
He suspected she had left because she was secretly tired of listening to him and his long list of complaints about Tony.
The medical floor is just starting to wake up, a few staff members milling about.
Steve was the one who suffered.
Tony looked at him, one eyebrow raised before he sat up and paused the show. "Are you going to answer that?" he asked.
When Tony wakes in the morning, Steve is already up, nose red and sniffling. He looks absolutely miserable and doesn't even try to turn away when Tony puts a hand on his forehead to feel for a temperature.
what she was doing when she let it slip) they're not at all surprised when Steve takes the pregnancy test and it's positive.
He had a job to do, and until Tony was safely back at the tower and away from whoever had drugged his drink, he'd treat this as a mission.
"No! I'm not mad at you, okay? I promise I'm not mad at you. I'm mad at the people who did this to you, Tony."
He hates the way he seems to croon the words even as he's singing about his Christmas heartache. Who the hell croons when singing about their heartache?
stalking you! If anything, maybe you're the one that's stalking me!" He crows.
"If you knew that you were pregnant, if you had
"Steve, wait! I love you too. I had no idea you felt this way, and it sounds ridiculous right now when we're practically confessing our undying love for one another, but I was convinced that you would never feel the way I did about you. So I was willing to take everything that you were willing to give, even if it meant that you wouldn't stay," Tony confesses.
Except, Natasha was extremely straightforward about these things and doesn't hesitate to show her displeasure or annoyance or anger. So he doesn't think this was the case. Maybe she was just annoyed with him for not trying to fix the whole thing with Tony. It's always hard to tell with her.
He'd apologized, of course, picturing Pepper telling him to try and be nicer to people and not scare them away by his mere presence. He'd rolled his eyes when she told him that and laughed. But this time he was willing to try it on the pretty blond that he'd knocked to the floor.
He doesn't know what to do with that information, there's nothing he can do about it.
"So… about Steve. Are you two serious? Or is this just another one of your flings? If so, Tony, I gotta warn you, man, it's not going to end well," Rhodey says.
The nurse snaps to action, showing Steve how to move so that she doesn't choke or swallow down air.
"Shit, Steve. Three hours? I was gone for four days. That's not healthy, baby. You need to sleep."
And then Tony turns to look at him, a smile quirking up at the corners of his mouth, and Steve finds himself having to swallow several times because honestly, he could handle any one of Tony's moods; he could stand Tony when he was angry and when he was irritated, or when he was too tired to function like a regular human being, even when he was wearing his public persona and was purposefully being difficult.
"You're so annoying, you know that?"
An emotion that he got really tired of seeing on his friend's faces when they thought he wasn't looking. Although, in the beginning, right after he and Tony broke up they hadn't even bothered to disguise their worry and concern. Now they were slightly more subtle about it, but he was getting better and better at identifying it for what it was; them looking out for a friend.
Tony who wore track pants that were so well-loved and worn that they were practically threadbare, who liked to wear oversized shirts and cardigans that didn't belong to him, rather items that were stolen from the other team members, sometimes Natasha if he was feeling brave and she wasn't feeling to murderous.
"Steve, what are you doing? Holy shit! Are you
The nurse adjusts Steve's grip on the baby, and then leaves with a smile, moving further into the room to give them a semblance of privacy.
said or done anything with him since that kiss.
It was quiet between them while Steve made them breakfast and Tony scrolled through his phone, occasionally breaking the silence to grab Steve's attention to show him something.
"No! I - Tony, how could you even
He nods, taking Bruce's word and allows himself to be reassured.
"I need to go. See you on Friday, Tony."
Steve didn't sound too happy about it, but his tone wasn't angry or bitter, so Tony counted it as Steve being in agreement. Really, Steve never gave up so easily, so if he was doing it now, it must mean that he agreed with Tony's logic.
"Is that why you're comforting me?" he asks and he's proud that his voice doesn't crack at the end.
Rhodey had then told her and they'd agreed that in Tony-speak, it was very much a date, and in his head he saw it as that.
And if that wasn't a boost to his ego then he doesn't know what else was.
It's concern.
When Steve nods, he takes it as a sign to continue. "I should've told you that I loved you sooner. Admittedly, it wasn't as horrible to admit to myself as I once thought it was -"
"So? Unlock it, Jay," he orders.
Two years later and they were still ignoring the elephant in the room and taking rather enormous precautions never to mention anything that might have to do with the incident all that time ago.
Steve's so intent on his actions of folding the clothing and packing the few toys away that he doesn't pick up the sound of approaching footsteps, nor does he hear Tony's knock on the door.
He hates seeing Steve like this; Steve never cried,
"It's okay, Nat. I've got it from here," he says and she frowns, but doesn't push. Instead, she stands on her tiptoes, leaning toward to place a kiss to his forehead and then one on Tony's.
After, when the nurse had declared her work done and deemed Steve and Tony capable of watching their daughter, Steve turned to him.
He and Tony weren't meant to be so friendly with one another, especially not since they were exes. Tony told him that they were essentially roommates. Of course, it wouldn't do to dodge one another and ignore the other's existence, but since they weren't together anymore, they didn't have to depend so heavily on one another.
