He stops at a Trader Joe’s on his way home and picks up coffee ice cream and popsicles in hopes that this will work as a peace offering. In the back of his mind, he knew this would happen. He knew that with recurring tonsillitis, the doctors would want to move forward with a surgery. That’s what happened with him. But there’s no way in hell he would’ve managed to get Tony to agree to a doctor’s visit. Not if he’d known surgery was on the table.
Even in private, he was reserved. He preferred just listening to conversation, occasionally laughing or adding his opinion. He would watch in idle amusement as games were played on various consoles, as bets were placed--usually between Clint and Thor, smirking when Clint would inevitably lose-- just enjoying the playful banter of his friends.
“Did I miss dinner?” Tony asks quietly. He blinks, looking at his watch. 7:22. Dinner was at 6:00. “Fuck. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to, I swear--” Steve shushes him, wrapping his arms around Tony’s frame.
Tony's hand tightens on his thigh at that, and he groans thickly. Steve loses his words, after that, has to just concentrate on control, even though Tony is taking everything so well, breathing deep through his nose and keeping his mouth so open, swallowing hard when Steve pulses on his tongue. Steve saves the last little bit of verbal capacity he has to stutter out, “I’m gonna come, I’m—” He drops his hands to Tony's shoulders, unwilling to give up contact but allowing him the freedom of pulling back– and he does, but god, not far. He doesn’t sit up or lean back, but keeps his face right there, fuck.
“As much as I would love to watch you try and keep your mouth shut,” Steve smiles as he rubs his hands through Tony’s hair, “not tonight. You need to rest.”
“Damn it!” Steve huffs, pushing away from the desk. He’d broken another pencil and had given up on drawing. He was pissed off at the rainy weather, not suitable for running, and had been to the gym twice already today.
“I’m just worried about you, you know?” Steve says. He lets his voice soften, and Tony glances up at him. Stupid eyelashes. Stupid, beautiful idiot. “You need to take care of yourself.”
“Come cuddle, Daddy,” Peter slurs. Tony sits on the edge of his tiny bed and plays with his hair until his breathing evens out. Steve smiles at him in the way he always does when something is particularly endearing. Tony stands slowly, careful not to jostle the boy, and presses a kiss to his forehead. Steve guides him out of the room with a soothing hand on his back. Neither man says a word until they’re back in the kitchen. Steve busies himself by cracking open a bottle of wine, Tony watching his every move.
“Nice reading, bud.” Tony says resting a hand on the back of Steve’s neck, the other ruffling his son’s hair. Peter looks up proudly at his father and grins crookedly.
Something he'd learned after a few weeks in bed with him is that Steve like to take his time. He likes to go slow and methodical at first before giving in and letting loose. Now, he teases Tony with small swipes of his tongue as he writhes beneath him. He's a breathless wreck thirty seconds in, begging wordlessly for more. The sensation is overwhelming and nowhere near enough all at once, and after a few endless minutes he's actually shaking, his whole body vibrating with want, muscles aching from holding back as Steve teases him with his tongue.
Steve immediately turns them off and carefully approaches the bed, sitting down on the edge and pulling the blankets off Tony, slowly, noting the way he shivers and buries his face deeper into his pillow. Steve frowns and puts his palm flat on the small of his back, just where his shirt is starting to ride up. He’s hot to the touch.
They end up on a Sunday/Wednesday schedule. They both managed to end up with the time to sleep in on Mondays, Steve’s first class not starting until 11:30 and Tony’s at noon, and Wednesdays they both get done for the day around one. So they’ll go get dinner, or see a late movie, or get drinks. Sundays and Wednesdays.
"Turn over." Steve hums. Tony blinks confusedly at Steve. He's briefly taken aback when Steve grabs his hips and flips him. And then, oh, God. Tony buries his face in his hands as Steve palms his thighs with both hands, spreading him open. There's a hot ghost of a breath before he the swipe of a tongue at his hole, and Tony groans, fingers digging into the buttery fabric of the sheets.
“Look at me.” Steve pleads, voice soft and gentle. “I don’t know how many times I need to tell you this, but you are not your father.” Tony nods, the motion stoic. “Peter drew something at school today.” Steve slides the paper across the counter to him. Tony is standing dressed in a suit and tie with a cape tied around his neck, flowing behind him with an SD; he can only assume it means Super Dad. In the drawing, Peter is holding his hand and they both have huge smiles on their faces. The drawing makes tears well in his eyes and slide down his cheeks instantly.
“Very.” Tony says bringing their hands to his lips. “You are the best thing in my life, aside from Peter, but that boy loves you.” Steve gnaws at his lip in hesitation before smiling softly.
“God, Tony, you have no idea, I want it so much. I know I'm not making much sense right now.” Steve stares at the window over Tony’s shoulder, trying to cajole his brain into making an actual decision. “Your place?”
"Let’s go to bed?” Tony suggests. Steve smiles, rests his hand on Tony’s cheek and presses one more lingering kiss to his lips.
Tony kisses him on the mouth, in the mostly quiet airport. His flight isn't for another two hours. Steve wraps his arms around Tony's waist and holds him still, Tony's breath against his neck.
Tony pulls his hands gently away from the bedframe and lets him lie there while Tony grabs the wipes to clean his hand and Steve's belly and the side of his face, oddly enough.
The thing is, he isn't doing a whole lot of moving. Or, he is, but not so much up and down: he tilts his head to get different angles, here and there, but what he's really doing is making out with Steve's dick, steadying it with one hand around the base. It's surreal, and obscene, and the very idea of it would be enough, but the sight of it - his other hand still curled loosely around Steve's wrist, holding it to his hair; eyes closed, his dark lashes fanned out on his cheeks; his reddened lips sliding across the surface of Steve's cock, a slow slick drag that has Steve shuddering. Tony lifts his head for a moment, his hand dropping away from Steve's wrist to rest on his thigh.
“It’s been awhile since you left,” He nudges Steve in the ribs, presses a little closer in the cab space.
Tony heaves a sigh. "You're right," he says, but he keeps on kissing Steve's lower belly, now with an open mouth and a sloppiness that borders on playful but is also still traitorously hot. Steve takes a deep breath, looking around for something, anything.
His face is the worst, externally, at least. The left side of his face is covered in cuts and bruises, while his right eye is swollen shut.
“Do you want to know what happened?” Bucky finally asks. Tony nods. “His convoy was attacked. He was taken hostage. I got a call from Peggy Carter, she would have called you but didn’t have your number. The officials normally would call, yes, but since this is kind of a family affair, they gave it to Peggy and I.” Tony’s tears start again, but no sound comes out. “So. Peggy found him. He’s pretty beaten up; has a collapsed lung, some internal bleeding and a couple broken bones but it isn’t anything the doctor’s can’t fix. He’s in surgery now, at least that’s what they told me a couple hours ago.” Again, all Tony is able to do is nod.
"Look at you," He says. "I love how responsive you are. So pretty for me." He gasps and nods as Steve moves both hands to his chest, pinching and playing with his reddening nipples. Tony tips his head up, parting his lips expectantly, and is rewarded with a rough kiss, teeth sinking into his lower lip and tongue pushing into his mouth. Steve does not let Tony lead—not that he wants to; he steers the ship, so to speak, sets the pace as he moves his hands down his abdomen, fingers sinking slightly into flesh, on a mission.
Bucky turns his body towards Steve and quirks his eyebrow. Steve sits up a little bit, folding his arms across his chest. Bucky looks at him, then looks at his chest, then looks back at Steve’s face. Like he knows exactly what Steve’s problem is.
They walk the three blocks to get back to Tony's and ride up the elevator to Tony’s apartment. Steve sits awkwardly on the couch, anxiously drumming his fingers against his thighs as Tony makes coffee. Steve gives in and paces, trying to compose explanations in his head.
“Go on, I’ll be there in a minute. I just have to talk to Papa about something.” Tony says and watches as Peter runs off. He sits in the newly discarded seat and watches his husband burp his daughter.
Tony bites down on his lower lip as he registers the hoarse arousal that tinges his voice. They're not so far apart now, and he takes another step closer, shortening the gap even more as he licks his lips. Steve swallows again, reaches out slowly, reverently, hands on his shoulders pressing down, stopping him in his tracks, grounding him.
“You’ll still love me even if I mess up, right Gracie?” Tony asks. The girl blinks at him, bottom lip sticking out. “Okay, sweetheart. Let’s get you changed and into bed.”
“You are it for me, Steve Rogers.” He whispers. They kiss for a few moments, holding each other like their lives depend on it.
“Yeah, it kind of fucking is.” Steve snaps. Tony blinks at him, his mouth opening and his eyes widening in shock. Then he sits back, stands up. Tony runs a hand through his hair, glancing around the room. His eyes occasionally flick towards Steve, and Steve’s not stupid enough to miss what sits behind that look, the anxieties and fears and desires. Everything Steve loves about Tony, directed at him with the utmost frustration. Possibly anger.
Tony wriggles a little, settling his head at a different angle on Steve's leg. That's all the warning he gets before Tony is tilting his head and nosing at the shape of Steve's cock through the thin fabric of his pajama pants.
“Some self defense. Just in case.” Steve reassures. “And that’s the last time I show you anything.” Steve says turning to glare at Peter. Peter smiles playfully and shrugs, slipping back into conversation as Tony drove them home.
“Tones?” Steve asks, suddenly breathless. His cock jerks, though, and Tony snickers, which is sort of unfair, if Tony really just told him to do what Steve thinks he did. They’ve talked about it a little, before, but always in an abstract sort of way, and now Tony's mouth is right there, and Steve can hear his own pulse right now.
Tony pauses, like he's thinking about that. "Vigilantes? No," he says. “But in a world with anthropomorphic turtles, I’d be all over that.” Steve laughs again, harder, his head lolling back against the sofa, and Tony looks up at him with an expression of mock irritation. "Stop laughing or I can't suck your dick," he says, hooking his fingers in the waistband of Steve's pajamas.
“Go.” Tony whispers, pushing Steve away a bit.  “If you don’t go now, you never will.” Tony says regretfully. Steve reaches out to caress Tony’s face once more and leans in for one last kiss.
Tony cries for a week. Not all the time, of course. He gets the kids up, gets them to school and day care. He goes to work. He attends meetings and lunches, laughs and tells jokes. He picks the kids up, he makes dinner. He puts them to bed. And then he cries. He cries in the shower, he cries himself to sleep. He cries when Peter crawls into his bed at three a.m., crying himself.
“That’s nothing,” Tony agrees. “I swear to god if you die, I’ll revive you just to kill you.” Steve snorts and leans forward to kiss him.
“Do you have everything?” Tony asks tearfully. He’s wearing one of Steve’s Army hoodies and a loose pair of gym shorts.
"Soon," Steve repeats, and gives Steve one last kiss before he turns and drags his suitcase towards security.
“I’ll explain, I promise. Pack a bag and come outside, please.” And Bucky hangs up. Tony stares at his lockscreen, a photo of him, Peter and Steve on the day Morgan was born and just cries.
“So, listen. I’ve got two days a week slotted for video calls for about an hour at a time. My days are Wednesday and Sunday. I can pick the hours, I just want to know what you think. I want to give my ma a day, too.”
They don't last very long, either of them. Granted, Tony certainly didn't expect to, after the buildup, but only after a few deep thrusts of his hips is he shaking through his orgasm, bouncing on Steve's cock all the way through it. And all the while, Steve's eyes are fixed on him, his hands, his chest, his stomach, his hips. Tony feels his hips snap up sharply, hammering into his prostate and Steve comes, his thrusts slowing to a stop moments later. Time seems to slow to a crawl as he gingerly lifts himself off of Steve and collapses to the bed beside him. Tony goes limp, his entire body feeling wrung out and overworked. A hand lands on his back, calmly stroking down his spine, and it makes him shudder.
"Off," Tony says, and starts tugging at his pants again before he can sit down. Steve manages not to trip over them as they fall to his ankles. It's a really good thing he gave up any sense of shame a long time ago with Tony, impossible not to, Tony's contagious that way because it's got to look a little undignified. But Tony is on him again the moment he settles back down. Tony smooths his hands up Steve's stomach--he's still wearing his shirt, he should fix that-- thumbs over his nipples, tongues his navel again until Steve tugs at his arms.
“I-sorry, I need a sec.” Tony says, turning his flat palms into fists. He breathes raggedly, letting Steve rub his back soothingly.
Steve types out a thank you, drops his phone back on his desk, sighs and looks up to the ceiling. His guilt is eating him alive.
“Oh, sweetheart.” Tony murmurs. Though he looks horrible, Tony is just relieved to see him in person. He takes a seat in the chair next to Steve’s bed and holds his good hand. “I’m right here, baby. I’m not going anywhere.” He presses his lips to Steve’s knuckles.
“Always,” Steve breathes, and pulls back just far enough to press his lips to Tony’s, opens his mouth and lets him chase his tongue, clings tight to anything he can get because this kiss has to last him for hours.
"We’ll figure it out," Steve agrees, and he gently pushes them apart so he can press a kiss to Tony's forehead. Tony grins.
Their hands stay locked together as they bask in the afterglow, silent save for their labored breathing. After a few moments of recovery, Steve pulls Tony into his arms.
He must fall asleep at some point, because when he wakes it’s to Bucky shaking his shoulder saying they’re there. Tony gets out of the car immediately and goes inside without waiting for Bucky.
For the remaining time, he just listens as Peter recalls his time spent away from Steve, talking about his friends and school and how cute Morgan is getting. Peter cries when the time comes to say goodbye, but promises to draw Steve a picture to send him.
“I love you, too,” Steve pants, gently pulling out. He busies himself with removing the condom and petting Tony’s hair off of his sweaty forehead.
“I can squeeze in a quick breakfast in the morning if you want.” Tony says pressing kisses up and down his neck.
“I’m thinking chocolate chip pancakes. How’s that sound?” Tony says as they ride up in the elevator.
"Yes. There's nowhere else I’d rather be.” Steve beams, chokes when Tony smiles over the rim of his mug.
“Shh. They’re going to prescribe you antibiotics, that’s all,” Steve says, though he can’t be certain. “I’m booked all morning or else I would go with you.” Tony’s eyes start to well up with tears and Steve can’t tell if it’s a play for sympathy or genuine fear. It could go either way with Tony.
“I love you,” Tony says breathlessly. His chest is heaving, rising and falling rapidly, his eyes trained on Steve, still looming over him.
“You do the work, sweetheart,” Tony says, and settles back, his hand resting in Steve's  hair but making no move to control his movements. Steve does what he's told, sinking down around Tony's cock and flicking his tongue under the head, where he knows licking gets the best results.
“Yeah. Come on in.” Tony undresses automatically, takes a deep breath and slides the curtain back. He steps in and is met with Steve’s toned back. He admires it, loving the way the water drenches his honey colored hair and can imagine how it’s plastered to his forehead. Steve turns just as Tony reaches out to touch him and grins at his boyfriend. His wet hands move to cup Steve’s face, bringing him in for a kiss.
“Holy shit, Tony. Keep going, baby, please.” Steve rasps, hands tangling in his hair, trying to resist the urge to thrust forward. Tony narrows his lips and pulls his head back before pushing forward again, moving his hands to hold onto Steve’s hips. He picks up a rhythm, stopping occasionally when Steve was buried in the back of his throat to swallow around him.
“You’re killing me.” Steve moans, dragging a hand through his sweaty hair. Tony leans down and kisses him messily, too much tongue and saliva, enjoying in the erotic nature of it. A hand wraps around his dick and Steve cries out freely, face turning redder.
Tony says “I want to bite you while you come,” and the idea is so overwhelming Steve can hardly get the words out.
"The fight for truth and justice is a very passionate struggle," he says, and Steve cackles, his stomach shaking under Tony's mouth.
“Hello?” Tony grumbles into the reciever, eyes still shut. Morgan is asleep on his chest, Peter curled into his side.
“The shower this morning, I think. We were getting dressed and I realized that you have a drawer here and a shelf in the closet and a toothbrush in the bathroom and it felt right.” Steve hides his face in Tony’s hair because he isn’t crying (fall allergies are just fucking bad right now, okay?) and wants to be closer to this boy.
“Just got Morgan to stop crying, Peter hasn’t started yet. Let’s have wine while we can.” He suggests walking over to press a kiss to his husband’s lips.
He inhales when he steps inside the entryway, expecting to see Tony sitting at the table, the air smelling of coffee and eggs. But all the lights are still off and the kitchen is empty and untouched.
Stark Industries has a big launch that Tony needs to travel to Los Angeles for, and after an extraordinary meltdown from Peter about staying with Grandma Sarah, Tony goes on his first business trip since Steve left.
Tony smiles against Steve’s skin. “I lied,” he whispers, nipping along Steve’s collar. “Missed you.”
Steve is again struck by how much Tony does with such little time. Steve sighs and prods one of the less well-read titles from the top shelf. It’s another biography. There are a couple of bends in the spine, so Tony’s definitely taken a look at the book, but it’s otherwise pretty pristine.
It's much later when they return, full and happy. Steve collapses on the couch and all but pulls Tony down with him.
“We’re…” Tony pauses. He bites his lips, furrows his eyebrows. “We’re still figuring this out, aren’t we?” Steve hums.
“Jesus.” Steve yelps when Peter throws himself dramatically onto the hood of the car, giving the effect that Tony hit him. Tony just laughs.
“Yes,” Tony assures him, and then presses his parted lips to the tip of Steve’s cock, his tongue flicking away the precum there, and looks up at Steve, his eyes heavy-lidded and dark with anticipation.
Much to Tony’s disappointment, Steve was often private in the bedroom too. He would muffle his noises, hide his face in Tony’s neck, chest or his own hands. It took him a few months to get over the horror of Tony watching him grow hard and then open him up before fucking him. It was mortifying.
Tony absolutely whimpers as Steve sucks a bruising kiss into his clavicle. "Oh, my God," Tony mutters. "Steve, please, I need you to touch me."
“Sure. Mr. Rogers is on the surgical recovery floor. I just need to see your ID, please.” Tony fishes out his wallet and produces his ID. She hands him a bright yellow sticker and gives him directions.
This time, though, he’s blaming Tony. It’s nearly an hour after they agreed to meet at the restaurant, and Steve is sitting alone at the bar working on his third  beer. Eight o’clock rolls around and he fishes cash out of his wallet and leaves.
Most of the time, being with Tony is easy. Whether that means being the guy Tony kisses whenever he wants, or just being around him, it’s true both ways. Sometimes it’s Tony telling a story about something Bruce did in their chem lab, hands moving wildly, eyes enthralling. Other times, it’s laughing as Tony sneaks things into the grocery cart or moving easily around each other when they make dinner. The rest of the time, it’s exhausting.
Steve sighs quietly and goes about putting the groceries away in the freezer, loads the dishwasher and fills a pitcher with water. When he glances back to the living room, he finds Tony staring. He rolls back over as soon as he’s caught.
“That little boy thinks the world of you.” Steve says reverently. “And I know Grace does, too. You are such a great dad, Tony.” Steve cradles Tony’s face between his hands and thumbs away his
“Hey,” Steve says as they wait outside for the Uber. “I love you.” Tony smiles so wide Steve’s heart melts a little bit.
Steve bites his quivering lip and his hips press up against Tony’s, his cock trapped between their bellies. Tony hammers into his prostate and a surprised, achoked cry leaves his lips and Steve throws his head back.
Steve has always been a private person. Before he was injected with the serum, no one paid much attention to him. After, though, his world turned on its axis. He was suddenly the most interesting person in the room, and often received a considerable amount of attention from women. Being in the public eye was uncomfortable in the 1940’s, and in the twenty-first century it was even worse.
“No, that’s okay. Thanks.”  Steve removes his shoes and lounges on the bed, reveling in the scent of Tony. He pulls the new phone out of his pocket in an attempt to learn how to use it.
“He’ll be okay?” Steve asks, slowing to a stop at a yellow light, ignoring the angry driver honking behind him. “I can cancel the rest of my day. It’s just typical S.H.I.E.L.D stuff.”
"Go on, baby," he says, his voice hoarse and raspy. "Show me how you fuck yourself. Put on a show for me."
"No," Tony mumbles, against his mouth now. He nudges Steve's lips apart, licking just inside; he's wormed his hands up Steve's shirt too, and now his thumbs under Steve's jaw tilt his head the way Tony wants. Steve makes a soft muffled sound into his mouth, but he's only too happy to acquiesce. Tony's lips are the tiniest bit sticky from the marshmallows; Steve cleans away the sugar with little sucking kisses. Or possibly he's only spreading it around. He couldn't care less. Tony's pressing closer, and his skin is hot on Steve's bare chest, and then the soft flannel of Tony's pants brushes his cock and he surges up into the kiss. Tony breaks away with a little sigh, but when Steve tries to chase his mouth he shakes his head and starts to slip down, out of the poor abused shirt.
“No,” He draws out the word like a child would. “Stay.” A half asleep Tony sighs happily when Steve settles back down.
Steve smiles and closes his eyes as Tony tucks his head into his shoulder. Steve runs his fingers through Tony’s loose, greasy hair. “I missed you too,” he says, and Tony chuckles, slotting in right beside Steve.
, and ends up with a half-shrug half-smile that he hopes at least communicates that he isn't having a panic attack. He's trying, he really is, but it's like trying to swim against the current and Tony isn't helping at all. He’s stepping back towards him and staring and reaching to cup his neck in one warm hand. Steve leans into it, he can't help it. He's not pulling even a little but, God, Tony’s fingers in his hair.
“Good morning.” Tony blushes, a bit flustered. Steve kisses him again and slowly presses him against the wall of the shower. Tony gasps as Steve’s lips attach to the junction of his neck and his fingers tug on his hair.
Steve wraps an arm around Tony’s waist and it’s awkward, but when he finally gets a look at Tony’s face. Tony is asleep. Literally asleep, his mouth open just slightly, drool forming in the corner.
“Come on, baby. Come for me.” Steve whispers in his ear. Tony does just that, moaning obscenely as he releases into Steve’s hand. He kisses Tony sweetly, reaching around him to grab the soap. They wash up in a comfortable silence and Tony hesitantly reaches for the shampoo before Steve can take it.
He's never actually had to explain it before. He just started doing stuff his boyfriend liked, and it worked, so they kept going and he picked up the words for it along the way. Trying to explain everything is an overwhelming prospect, even if he wasn't already spacing out. So maybe he should just explain enough that they can get through tonight? Tony might not even like topping him once he tries it, and then they'll know and they'll just… try to avoid pressing Steve’s buttons like that, or something. Tony’s an adult, he's capable of saying no. And Tony lets Steve top him, so even if he hates it the other way around, Steve still has a lot to be grateful for.
Steve nods frantically, and then Tony’s lips are on his. He melts into the kiss, opening his mouth for Tony to lick at his tongue and nip gently at his bottom lip. Tony reaches up into his hair and tugs, right at the base of the skull, and Steve follows instinctively, tilting his head back so Tony can bite his neck too gently to leave marks. He whines and Tony laughs quietly against his throat.
“Okay, kiddo. Let’s go brush those teeth and get in bed, yeah?” Steve suggests, nudging him before he can really fall asleep. Peter nods, sliding off the couch and trudges up the stairs. Steve follows him and Tony looks down at the sleeping girl in his arms. She looks just like Steve’s mother, a fact he is distinctly happy about. Peter is all Tony; unruly dark curls, mischievous brown eyes, a knack for science even at a young age. The boy likes to get into everything, whether he should or not, is always moving and loves to cuddle (a trait he definitely got from Tony that Tony will deny until he dies.) Grace, though, has her father’s golden hair, starting to curl ever so slightly, beautiful bright blue eyes that make Steve’s look dull in comparison and the most perfect peaches and cream complexion. She’s an easy baby--much easier than Peter was-- and at just nine weeks old, she is sleeping through the night. Even better, though, is the fact that she is Sarah Rogers’ mini-me. If Tony didn’t love his mother-in-law so much, he would accuse Steve of doing it on purpose.
He’s halfway to the door when he hears a frantic rustle and then - something soft bouncing off the back of his head. He turns around and finds Tony sitting upright, looking resigned and a bit guilty. Steve looks down and finds a paper ball at his feet.
“I don’t know what he told you, but none of it is true, Tony. Not any of it.” Tony takes a glass from him and leans against the counter.
There’s records. There’s so many records, new and old, of genres he didn’t think Tony even knew about. There’s Black Sabbath (obviously), there’s Florence and the Machine, there’s Les Mis, ACDC, Guns n’ Roses, there’s bands Steve has never even heard of.
"I am so happy I found you." Tony whispers against his lips. Steve shudders at the hot breath that dances over them.
Tony raises an eyebrow again, less dramatically, but nods. He’s silent, lips pressed together in a thin, thoughtful line.
“You’re clearly about to—don’t touch me!” He yells, ripping his arm away from Steve’s grip, wincing at the tone of his voice. “Just leave. Leave us, whatever. We’ll get on without you. I’m tough, resourceful and… fuck. I am freaking the fuck out. So fuck you, you’re making me crazy.” Tony spits, turning on his heel and stalking to their room. He cries on the bed for a while until Steve comes in, spoons right up behind him and just holds him.
"Yeah," Tony reassures him. "Just love you." Steve blushes, smiles and caresses his knuckles. Tony thinks this could be an okay thing, moving in. He summons all the courage in his being and speaks.
“So. Food.” Tony dishes out the food, lights some candles and pours the wine, and Steve just watches.
"Take off your clothes," He says, his voice even softer. And Tony, blushing bright crimson, is compelled to obey, couldn't control his body if he tried. Steve doesn't move, just stands there by the bed with arms folded, observing as Tony slides the belt from his pants. Tony removes his shirt carefully, sets it on the chair, atop his jacket, then takes a step forward, down to his briefs.
"What do you think?" Tony asks quietly. Steve's eyes are dark as they rake over his body. He'd feel even more exposed if not for the easily evident bulge tenting Steve's pants. Steve's jaw tightens, and Tony sees him swallow visibly before he drags an impatient hand through his hair and says, "Come here."
Steve swallows. “I don't–you don't have to. I'm really sorry I freaked out earlier. You didn't do anything wrong. I'll be fine tomorrow-” and now Tony isn't smiling and he's fucked everything up.
Steve guides Tony down onto the bed with its soft sheets and plush pillows and mattress. Tony lets out a sigh as adrenaline and happiness rush through his veins. Little flickers of arousal spark in Tony’s belly as Steve kisses down his body. Steve places kisses and nips to the soft flesh of Tony’s belly and growls as Tony’s fingers card through his hair, tugging lightly.
Tony hums around the head of his cock and Steve hisses out his name, watching the way his lips stretch and his eyelids flutter and takes hold of Steve's hand and pushes it into his hair.
“Just thinking.” Tony hums, taking a deep breath through his nose, eyes fluttering closed. “Go back to sleep, sweetheart, I’m gonna walk it off.” Tony whines, wrapping himself around Steve like a koala, squeezing tighter as he pulls the sheets off himself.
Tony’s apartment is a weird mixture of cramped and messy, but in perfect order. He has a decent sized TV set up with an Xbox. Steve breaks his own rule about not touching Tony’s stuff by playing Call of Duty, terribly, for about an hour in the afternoon because he’s bored. Tony has these gorgeous bookshelves packed with everything Steve couldn’t even imagine owning. Books- paperback and hardcover. Novels and textbooks. History books, biographies of people Steve didn’t even know Tony was interested in (there’s one about George Washington that catches Steve’s eye, and then a book on the history of political systems of the world which makes Steve blanch).
The more logical part of him isn’t as worried: Peter is usually pretty happy to see him. But the anxiety in him, the part of him that knows nothing is perfect, is terrified.
When Tony finally tugs at his hair and pulls him away, Steve rests his head on Tony's hip and breathes him in. He feels boneless, curled up with Tony above him, not even aware of his own arousal until Tony breathes, “Good boy.”
Tony's eyes widen as he guides his cock to his entrance and slowly begins to sink down upon it. He's so much thicker, so much longer than he'd expected at this angle, even now. The stretch of it is exquisite, filling him up.
“We should go out more,” Steve says idly one morning. It’s early, just about seven, and Tony is showering for his eight a.m. Steve is at the counter in the bathroom finishing up his shave.
"Okay." Tony lets him, feeling his anxiety melt away as soon as Steve’s fingers begin to massage his scalp. He wordlessly tilts Tony’s head back and rinses the suds.
He’s packing up to leave by 4:30 p.m., trying to put the day’s frustrations behind him, eager to get home to Tony, when his phone vibrates across his desk. A text from Pepper.
“Oh my God,” Steve says flatly as Tony starts to move. Up and down, holding the dildo steady behind him. He watches, head spinning a little, because he wonders if this is what he looks like when Tony fucks him. It can’t be, because Tony looks so good, the flush spreading from his face down to his chest now. He looks good and in control, but not, all at the same time, and Steve fists his own dick, pumps it a few times, trying to hold back.
“Good boy.” Tony huffs picking up the pace. Steve chokes out a whine and is coming unexpectedly across Tony’s fist and his stomach.
It’s the last Saturday before Steve is set to leave and Tony is awake at an ugly hour of the morning. They’re still naked from their night together, watching Steve as he sleeps deeply, eyes trailing along his form. It’s weird, he thinks, how he could feel like he hasn’t looked at him enough, despite the fact they’ve lived together for over a decade, known each other for much longer. Tony reaches out to touch, soft and gentle, and settles with his left hand resting on the curve of Steve’s cheek.
He wakes with a start to something cold pressed to his neck. He’s about to swat when Tony mumbles, “Hey, ‘s jus’ me,” with a bit of a tired slur to his voice.
“You’re so greedy,” Steve’s mouth says, practically on autopilot now, but at the same time he wants to see where this goes. He wonders if this is how Tony feels all the time, powerful with just a hint of want. He traces the dildo where it meets Tony’s entrance with his fingertip, his touch light and teasing, noticing how Tony arches into it.
“Not what I meant. Believe me.” Steve’s hand trails down Tony’s stomach and his lips press into his neck. “I meant that I was bored, so I came down to do something.” Tony gasps as Steve’s hand fondles him through the fabric of the towel.
“I called my mom about coming to stay for a while.” Steve says pulling away, holding Tony’s face in his hands. Tony groans, pushing away.
The door is shut and Steve rakes his eyes over Tony's body, who shivers in response. The gesture is so obvious, almost starkly funny in its clear meaning.
“Maybe when classes are over, we can go to my parent’s place in Malibu.” He stops, bites his lip. Steve’s smiling.
That makes a hundred things spark in Steve’s head, most of them rather mean. Bucky’s expression falls, and Steve realizes he’s scowling.
“You want us to be, like, a family?” Peter asks. Steve’s heart swells and for the first time since he’s known Peter--close to five years, now-- he looks like a child.
When Steve's fingertips sink beneath the waistband of his underwear, he whines a little into the kiss, prompting another sharp nip to Tony's bottom lip. "Good boy," he murmurs and his head gets a little muddier with the praise as he allows Steve to slide his underwear down over his thighs, stepping out of them automatically as they join the pants puddled on the floor. Tony sucks in a breath as the cool air of the room meets his heated flesh. One of Steve's hands tangles in his hair, tugging his head back and exposing more of his throat. His lips close over the pulse point beneath his ear, sucking and biting, and Tony gasps, eyes closed, allowing himself to be pushed backward onto the bed. Tony melts into the sheets as Steve clambers atop, crouching on all fours over his frame. His hands are all over, touching the nape of his neck, his chest, his stomach, inner thighs, everywhere but his leaking erection.
"I love you, too." Tony murmurs before he falls asleep on Steve's chest, one hand still tangled softly in his hair.
Steve pulls him off to let him breathe, asks if he’s okay, and Tony just nods. His jaw is slack, and he licks his lips as he catches his breath, but he seems uninterested in talking. He isn’t even meeting Steve’s eyes anymore, which would be worrisome except that he just seems to be trying so hard to get back to Steve’s cock, and he is – Steve suddenly notices – making occasional tiny movements with his hips against the sofa beneath him. He moans when Steve uses the hand in his hair to pull him close again; he moans louder when Steve thrusts, and a small part of Steve wants to drop his head back and shut his eyes to soak in the sensations, but he couldn’t look away from Tony right now if the building started to collapse. He can’t believe his goddamn luck, honestly, and he knows Tony won’t believe him but he says it anyway. “You look so good,” he murmurs, and Tony whines high up in his throat. “You look, you look incredible—”
“You’re really good at this, sweetheart.” Steve compliments with a dopey smile on his face. Tony grins back, planting a soft kiss against his bare shoulder blade.
“This is fun,” Tony says, low and throaty. “We need a safeword. Tell me, be a good boy and tell me your safeword.” Steve swallows thickly a few times before the words find him.
Tony initiates it. He shuts the door behind them with a spectacularly wicked grin. It’s Wednesday, and they’d just gotten home from dinner, and Steve was picking up his apartment but now Tony has him cornered, pressed against the wall.
“Um,” Tony says softly. “You sure you're okay? Because that doesn't really look like an okay-face. That looks more like you’ve– oh.
“Because I love you!” Tony yells. “Jesus Christ, Steve. Have you noticed that half my shit ended up here? Or that you have an entire side in my closet? That isn’t an accident. I love you and I want to be with you, but I don’t think I can be around you right now.” Tony stands and blows past Steve, right out the door. Steve hits his knees, loses all resolve and breaks down, ugly sobbing.
Tony frowns, guilt rising in his chest. After observing his actions for so long of course Steve would pick up on this part of him. On the part of him that picked on people, sarcasm dripping like honey. He kisses him sweetly and caresses his face gently.
“Hey there handsome,” Tony says in cool surprise when he sees Steve laying on the bed. “Ah-I’m not wearing any clothes.” He says stupidly. Steve snorts, drops his phone beside him.
“This kid is gonna give me a heart attack one of these days, I swear.”  Tony says unlocking the door so Peter can climb in. He clambers into the backseat, smacking a wet kiss to Tony’s cheek in the process.
He glances up at him, eyes sparkling, dips his head and scrapes his teeth across the expanse of his chest, making him shiver. "Am I not touching you?" It's agony, his erection leaking, pelvis straining upward as Steve lavishes attention on every other part of his body, still fully clothed himself as he grinds down against his thigh. "Let me try harder."
Tony's face flushes even warmer, head spinning dizzily as he quickens his pace steadily, working himself up to an eager pace. He's so turned on, and he takes a steadying breath, inhales as deeply as he can and he keeps fucking himself on his length as Steve's long fingers dig into his thighs. His free hand goes back to his face, and he leans in to capture his lips in a heated kiss.
Sure enough, Steve is asleep. He’s got an oxygen tube settled in his nose and is wrapped in gauze seemingly from head to toe. He has two soft casts, one on his right arm and another on his left leg.
“I bet you wish this was my cock, huh,” Steve teases, pulling it out a bit before driving it back home. Tony keens, back arching, head nodding. He watches the muscles in Tony’s back move, trying to stay still. Watches him flex around the glass toy, watches his thighs twitch with what looks like supreme effort. He reaches back to the bedside table, slicks up his hand with a couple pumps of lube before he reaches for Tony’s cock.
In the morning, Bucky will come in and heckle Steve about being able to only use one arm. They’ll call Sarah and the kids and Nat, apologizing and letting them know that everything is going to be okay. They’ll meet with Steve’s doctors, learn that he is lucky to be alive, that if the shrapnel that caused the internal bleeding was any more to the right than it was, his heart would have been blown to pieces. They have a long road to recovery, both physically and mentally. But when he gets back in the car later that week to go home, nothing else matters.
It pulses in his hand even as he grabs it, hot and hard, and Steve gives it a firm squeeze before stroking it a couple times. Just enough of a tease to make Tony groan again. Steve smirks, and takes his hand away, running his lube-slicked index finger around Tony’s entrance, where it’s already stretched wide. Tony yells.
4:32 a.m. Steve is spooned up behind him when he starts to twist and groan in his arms. Steve loosens his grip and scoots back. It’s been a couple years, so he knows better than to try to keep Tony still when he gets like this. He still ends up with a sharp kick just above his knee. Steve yelps, and Tony stays asleep, rolling onto his stomach and starfishing on the bed. He clears his throat just when Steve is drifting off, Tony hugs the pillow in his sleep, pressing it into his face and trying to muffle the sound as his coughing starts back up.
Steve bites his lip. He already talked about it. He unloaded on Peggy before their art show, and she’d been incredibly sweet, kissing his forehead and promising him things would get better. He feels directionless, doing what he loves, hit by something new every day. Peggy is still hopeful, young enough that she hasn’t been hit by those fears that everything’s going to fall apart.
“Maybe if you kiss me for real, I’ll talk to you.” Tony’s head whips up to look at Steve. He’s grinning, despite his swollen face, and Tony doesn’t hesitate to--gently--launch himself at him. Their lips meet and their tears mix and Tony has never been more scared and relieved at the same time.
“Keep your eyes open for me,” Steve breathes, his blue eyes focused and perfectly trained on Tony’s face. “I wanna see you.” His voice was laced with authority, and it made Tony’s eyes fly open; he was sure that that was the hottest thing that Steve has ever said to him. Steve smirks at Tony, hitting his prostate again, more forcefully this time.
Tony shudders as he turns on the night light, a replica of the arc reactor both kids love so much, and makes sure the baby monitor is on before he leaves the room. Steve is just finishing up reading Peter his book, so Tony sneaks in, leaning on the door frame. The move is right out of Steve’s book, something he does when he just wants to observe Tony with the kids, and Tony understands why. Peter notices him, though, and makes sleepy grabby hands at him.
"You deserve it," Steve says. It sounds inane, but he doesn't know how to make his sincerity clearer, except to shift his hand in Tony's hair in a kind of petting motion. Tony arches up into it like a cat, and then his smile twists, gets a little bit of a wicked edge.
“Sorry. I just...y’know, I was working myself up in the shower.”  He blushes and Steve melts a little more. Steve presses a reassuring kiss to Tony’s mouth before pulling back for just a moment. He’s mildly embarrassed at how endearing this whole thing is. How
"Here," he says, right as Tony's tongue dips into his belly button and his voice breaks just a little. He leans over, grabs the blanket slung over the back of the sofa, and Tony sits up enough to let him spread it over the cushion beneath.
Which is good. It is. He needs to keep his head straight until they get home and Tony enthusiastically kissing him would make that impossible. Even if this... thing of Tony standing inside his personal space and shying back from touching him, kind of makes him want to cry again. He leans forward and brushes his lips against Tony's, who breaks into a grin.
Tony is still making a lot of noise, but there’s none of the anxiety he usually gets in his face when Steve tries to tell him this stuff, and that’s – that’s something to be examined later. He’s so receptive and sweet and Steve literally can’t believe this is happening: he’s lounging on his sofa, snowed in, an unintelligible racket of cartoons in the background, gently fucking Tony's mouth.
Somewhere in the back of his fogged-up mind, Steve realizes the TV is still on, because he hears a distant Cowabunga! and can't help but erupt into giggles, momentarily distracted from the subtle torture Tony is inflicting. Of course Tony chooses that moment to take him into his mouth, of course. Steve's laughter breaks off into a groan, and his hands clench in the blanket beneath him.
“Oh,” Tony says, looking up from the book he was reading on the sofa. “I’ll actually be in Malibu for the weekend. My flight is tomorrow afternoon.” Steve’s expression falls. “Did I forget to tell you? I’m sorry.” He manages to look like he truly is. “It’s just for a couple of days, Mom wants me home for the weekend. Some SI award thing Howard won.” He waves a dismissive hand. “I’ll be back by Monday?”
Steve wakes up at 3:14 a.m to the sound of Tony hacking into his pillow. His shoulders trembling, face pink and flushed when he rolls over onto his back, still in a dead sleep. Steve doesn’t know how he manages that.
It’s late on a Wednesday night when Steve finally returns to his apartment. He’d busied himself at the library until his hunger drove him home. Steve unlocks his door and freezes when he sees Tony standing in the middle of the room, dressed up with a bottle of wine in hand.
“I used up my last apparel when we had Peter.” Tony wants to cry. He wants to fall to his knees, hug Steve’s legs and just cry.
“Yeah?” Tony calls over the spray. “You know I’ll never say no to going out with you.” Steve frowns a bit, knowing that Tony has been saying no more and more frequently.
“Hi, sweetheart.” He sits up immediately. He shifts Morgan so her cheek is smushed into his shoulder, gently getting off the bed.
“C’mon,” Tony says, and presses another open-mouthed kiss to the side of Steve’s cock. “I’ll let you know. Three taps to the leg. I remember.” And then, because Steve is still staring mutely– “Rogers. You’re starting to make a guy feel unwelcome down here.”
Then he starts to realize that Tony Stark is full of shit, because he keeps saying - “I’m fine, I’m fine,” and waving his hands whenever people express concern, but then he’s falling asleep at really inconvenient moments.
“Greedy,” Tony repeats, gasping and he’s no longer looking at Steve; his face pressed to the bed but his ass still thrust high in the air, body perfectly still. Steve presses down a little more firmly, and his teeth are buried in his lower lip as he watches. He moans as feels Tony open up to him, as he lets him press inside, the pressure tight and incredible with his finger trapped between the toy and his rim.
“Hi.” Tony licks his lips, wetting them, his mind reeling. “Do you mind if I join you?” He asks over the noise of the water. Steve grins, rakes his eyes up and down Tony’s body, and nods.
"Yeah that sounds good, actually." Tony pulls his hoodie on and sits to pull on his socks. Tony can’t help the smile at how domestic this all is and how natural and safe it feels. Tony smiles as warmth spreads through him when he realizes that he just thought about being domestic with Steve without panic surging through his veins. He bites his lip and zips his jacket.
“Fuck. Tony. God, I wish you could see yourself. I wish everyone could see you. I wish I could take your photo and keep it forever,” and here he moves his finger, just a fraction of an inch, just for emphasis, and he feels Tony suddenly seize and tighten and then relax again around him, and they both let out a little gasp in tandem.
make you feel that way makes me so damn happy, I can’t even begin to tell you.” He runs a thumb over Steve’s warm cheek. “It turns me on so much, Steve, hearing you and seeing you come apart beneath me.” Tony whispers more intimately, lips brushing over Steve’s. “I love you so much.” Tony whispers sweetly, ducking his head as his cheeks tink a deep red.
Steve licks his lips. “Of course,” he says, turning on his heel so trek back into his bedroom. He tosses the towel into the hamper and sits on his bed. Tony follows him in after a moment and presses himself against Steve, wrapping his arms around his neck.
“Hey, pal.” Steve says to the four year old. “You’re gonna be good for Daddy, right?” Peter nods, tears running down his tiny cheeks. “I love you so much, Pete. You’re so brave, my brave little man.” He hugs their first born tightly for a long moment and Tony starts to cry as he sees Steve’s tears fall more steadily.
“Of course. Your comfort means everything to me.” Tony says seriously. “Whatever you need, baby. I’ll do it.” Tony says, leaning up for another kiss. “We can talk more in the morning.” He says when Steve pulls away.
"I've been waiting to hear you say that for so long," He kisses him again, deeper this time. "I am very much in love with you." He says reverently. Steve has said it before; the first time he said it, Tony worked himself up so much he panicked and Steve had to talk him down, telling him that he's okay and he doesn't need to say it back until he's ready. Tony turns slightly into the embrace and he kisses Steve for real this time, soft lips and feather light touches.
“Hey, now. Let me see that gorgeous face.” Tony urges sweetly, nudging Steve’s hands away from his face. The man looks so fucked out; face flushed, hair sticking to his sweaty forehead, eyes wide and dark with lust. His teeth are buried in his bottom lip and his face is scrunched up in what Tony hopes is pleasure. Tony slams his hips forward and smiles devilishly at Steve’s broken moan.
“No lights!” Tony’s voice, hoarse and barely above a whisper, calls out from beneath a pile of blankets.
They ride to the airport together the rest of the way quietly, Tony squeezing Steve’s hand and drumming his fingers on his thigh with his other hand. Steve tugs his suitcase out of the trunk, and Tony swipes his card in the back of the cab and thanks the driver.
“I love you.” Steve kisses Tony’s forehead, setting the condom aside. He maneuvers himself onto the bed, nudging Tony’s legs open. “Spread your legs and relax for me, baby.”
“I know, you’re mad,” Steve says to his back, shrugging a shoulder. He turns to the elevator, prepared to spend the night on his own floor. “For what it’s worth, I figured if you needed surgery they’d schedule it. I thought we’d have some time to talk about it.”
He wakes up at 5:30 despite exhaustion , knowing that if he skips his run he’ll feel even more out of it. He returns around 7:15, showers in his own bathroom before heading back up to their shared floor.
“Well, since Peter’s in school and my SI schedule is always changing, why don’t we take Sunday? Give you more time to talk to the kiddos.” Tony suggests.
Steve set the pace, nice and slow gentle. Feeling bold, Tony wraps his legs around Steve’s waist to pull him closer, biting his lip to contain a groan when Steve hits his prostate.
“I think so,” He says zipping up his bag. “It’s only six months. We’ve gone longer.” He reminds gently against Tony’s lips. “I love you so fucking much.”
“Not much,” Steve says truthfully. “Just that your dad called, and that you had a bad day.” Steve kisses his forehead, forcing him to look him in the eyes. “Eat your dinner and then come upstairs. We’ll talk about it later.”
“We just have to pick Peter up from Ned’s and then we’re going to make the best damn pancakes you’ve ever eaten.” Tony says pulling away from the curb. Steve listens as Tony hums along to the music on the radio, feeling his heart swell and his stomach fill with butterflies. Tony reaches blindly across the center console and takes Steve’s hand in his. Steve squeezes and rubs his thumb over Tony’s hand three times; their silent sign for I love you.
“Hi,” Tony says. “I hope you’re hungry, I made lasagna.” Steve walks to his boyfriend and pulls him into a hug.
“Yeah, I am,” he admits. Tony pushes himself up into a seated position, tucking his phone into his pocket and watching Steve with his Intent Gaze. That’s what Steve’s named it, though only in his head. One of Tony’s eyebrows shoots up, comedic in its timing, and he smirks then pouts when Steve rolls his eyes.
"Oh, fuck," Steve says helplessly, stroking just behind Tony's ear. The hair is so silky here, downy-soft, and Tony makes another noise, encouraging. Steve doesn't pull, but keeps his grip firm, the way Tony likes, a steady tension at his scalp when he moves.
“Stark, take good care of our boy,” Carol smirks, clapping him on the shoulder. “It’s getting late, so we’re gonna go.” She announces, winking at Steve as she helps Rhodey up.
“Okay.” Steve runs his palm over Tony's hair, his heart swelling at the easy contentment in Tony's voice and the mindless way he keeps trying to squirm closer. “Not yet.”
“Daddy says I have to tell you only the ‘portant stuff. I miss you a lot, Papa.” Tony’s heart clenches, so he buries his nose in Morgan’s hair to hide his tears as he steps into frame.
“Yes, you are.” Steve smiles, taking his shirt off over his head. Tony’s breathing became labored and he lets Steve press his body against the wall.
Talking to his friends is a lot easier than anticipated. There's a fizzing energy under his skin, a constant distraction, but his attention back to what he's supposed to be doing.
“Do you have condoms and lube?” Steve asks, trailing kisses down his chest. Tony nods and attaches his lips to Steve’s neck. Steve takes Tony’s chin in his hand and pulls him in for a kiss. Tony tries his hardest to put himself into the kiss, but he eventually breaks away and rests his palms and forehead on Steve’s chest.
One of Steve’s fingers gingerly pushed into Tony who immediately let out a breathy sigh. Steve somehow always knew how to treat Tony right. He somehow always knew what to say and do to make Tony more comfortable, no matter how many times they’d done this.
“This is amazing, sweetheart. Thank you.” Tony ducks his head, maybe to hide his grin. When he looks up again though, his eyes are sort of sad.
“But he’s alive?” Tony croaks looking over at the other man. Bucky nods, and Tony watches his Adam's apple bob as he swallows. Tony throws his head back in relief and cries quietly.
“Learned it from you,” He points out. Tony can’t argue with that, so he just shakes his head with a fond smile. “Oh! Steve! I did that move you told me about. Y’know, the defensive thing with the hands?” Tony’s eyebrows shoot up to his hairline as he looks to his boyfriend.
His face is scrunched up in ecstasy and his chest rises and falls rapidly. Tony can feel his pulse where they’re connected and, if he were a normal person, Steve would be just this side of cardiac arrest. Tony thrusts into Steve with abandonment and grips Steve’s biceps. Steve continues to choke out moans and whimpers all while writhing in pleasure.
“Christ, baby. This is, what, the fourth time this year?” Steve asks as he feels along Tony’s neck, just below his jaw line. His glands are swollen. Recurrent tonsillitis, if he had to guess. He went through his as a kid.
“Hey, we promised we wouldn’t do this. I won’t complain about the kids, and you won’t complain about not being here to help me. Mopey time is over, Captain. Tell me about your day.” Steve does, diving into a story about his platoon. He’s hit it off with a couple soldiers, which is so nice for Tony to hear. He’s happy Steve isn’t being a hermit and just giving orders.
Tony shakes his head against him. “Not yet,” he says, although his hips make another little shift against the sofa.
“Made you swear.” Tony chides, biting at Steve’s neck. Steve hides his face in embarrassment again and moans, the sound muffled. Tony softly kisses up his jaw, murmuring a soft apology.
So he generally stayed under the radar; investing in a copious amount of baseball caps, hooded sweatshirts and jackets. When Tony eventually caught on, he supplied a full collection of Ray Ban sunglasses.
Jesus. He feels so full now, and Steve's cock is hot and slick and fucking huge and his eyes slide shut. Tony can't think about anything else, about his body or putting on any kind of show, as he lifts himself up an inch or two on his knees and then sinks back down onto him with a low hiss.
A little while later, the door to the ensuite bathroom opens and he sees Tony walk out in just a towel.
Steve nods to himself, feeling some of the tension lift from his shoulders. “Thank you. Again. I know he’s a handful when he gets like this.”
As they lay in the warm afterglow, Steve pets Tony’s hair and murmurs sweet nothings to him. He’s always so sweet and gentle coming down from a high, a nice contrast to what was done just moments before.
“Whatever’s going on in that brain of yours,” Bucky finally says, and his voice is a little softer now. “You’ve been quiet, and I haven’t heard from you or Tony in like a week.”
"Steve," he mutters. "I just—please." Tony cringes at the sound of his own voice, scratchy with want and bordering on pathetic, needy. But Tony needs this. He needs to be touched, needs some relief after the tension of the night, the dancing, the bottle of wine forgotten by the pool, all of it. Tony loves him. Loves his smile, his laugh, the way he wakes him up in the morning. Tony needs him and he's not even scared to admit that. Steve flashes a quick, wicked smile, and kneels upright before climbing off Tony altogether.
Tony stares at him again, his mouth set in a half-frown and eyebrows furrowed in a careful, precise crease. Steve shifts under the heaviness of the gaze set on him.
Tony probably didn't mean anything by it. He just hadn’t seen Steve all day, got excited and pounced on him for a kiss right in the middle of the bar. And Steve is never going to turn down kissing Tony, so he took half a step back to lean against the wall and enjoy the moment. Except that they’re in the middle of a bar and anyone can hear them, and when he pointed this out, Tony said “So be quiet,” pushed his shoulders back, and Steve was gone. Tony was pressing against him and nipping at his ear and all Steve could do was try desperately not to moan. He's pretty sure he stopped breathing for a while there, too.
“I know.” He says lamely. “I’ll be fine, Steve.” He takes his daughter from her father and smiles as she coos at him, nuzzling into his chest. Steve sighs, knowing better than to argue with Tony when he gets like this, and he walks into the living room. Tony follows him and places himself next to Peter on the couch, the boy engrossed by some Disney Channel show. When he realizes that his dad is now sitting next to him, he launches into an animated story about something that happened with his friend at school, and how he stood up for the new girl Michelle when some mean kid was picking on her. He rambles into another story, yawning throughout, before he curls into Tony’s side, thumb sliding into his mouth. The couple watches the boy fight consciousness and just as he’s about to nod off, Steve slides his hand to his tiny leg.
“So good.” Steve says again, and he reaches down to take Tony’s cock in his other hand, palming the whole thing, rock-hard and pulsing in his hand, the tip dripping with pre-come. “I wanna make you come just like this–” and here he smirks, nasty and entirely to himself, and strokes Tony two more times, brushing his thumb over the wet slit. “Just like this,” he repeats, and with great concentration, he strokes Tony three more times, quick and efficient.
“What are you sorry about? I’m sorry I was so angry.” Tony shrugs, pulling away to look Steve in the eyes.
“Woah,” Tony breathes. “I thought we were meeting here and I fell asleep. I’m sorry, this one’s on me.” Steve’s jaw tenses, still frozen in the doorway.
He wishes it was him. He wishes he was the one to be captured. He wishes he was the one with a collasped lung and internal bleeding. Steve, his perfect man, suffers enough from chronic illnesses. He doesn’t need this on top of it all. Tony has never done a single heroic thing in his entire life, but he would both kill and die for Steven Grant Rogers.
Sunday is the last day. Sarah knows, somehow, exactly what they need, so she takes the kids to the zoo. He stays in bed for most of the day with Tony, making love and sleeping and breathing in every ounce of his husband. They both cry. Neither of them sleep that night.
Then he notices, feels hot and tight with need, his cock achingly hard. Tony drags him up to lie beside him and hooks a leg around his, keeping him in place. Steve  has no idea what to do with his hands until Tony says, “Hold on to the headboard for me, sweetheart,” and makes everything simple.
When Tony was feeling up to it—no panic about living with someone—they usually stayed at his apartment: a cozy one bedroom apartment in the center of the city. But when Bucky wasn’t around to comment on their every move, they took advantage of the bigger space at Steve’s apartment. It isn’t like they haven’t discussed it, moving in. Because they have, a lot, but Tony usually ends up panicking about hypotheticals and Steve has to talk him off the ledge. The idea is actually quite appealing to him; waking up next to Steve everyday and being with him more than he is on a daily basis. It’s just… he doesn’t trust himself to keep up the good dynamic in the relationship. What if they break up? Or what if Steve decides that it’s too much and he needs to leave immediately? Or what if—
“That’s right, Steven. Captain, half my seal has been deployed, is that a different process? Oh, I see yes, thank you. No, listen, you’ve been very helpful, I appreciate everything you’ve done. Yes. Thanks.” He hangs up the phone and looks up to Tony expectantly.
“You bastard.” Tony says between kisses. “I thought you were dead.” Steve pulls his good hand up to cradle his head and connects their lips for longer this time.
He’s pulled out of his revere by a fussy whine and mesmerizing blue eyes staring up at him. Tony shifts her so she’s cradled against his chest, hands gripping his shirt.
Tony screws his eyes shut and leans into his touch, digging into his bottom lip with his teeth. It’d be cute, almost, if he didn’t look so flushed and miserable. “And you promise they’re just going to write me a prescription?”
“I love you too, Tony. Very much.” They’re silent, listening to each other breathe like they would when they were dating in college and didn’t want to hang up. “I’ll call you whenever I get the chance, of course. Sunday’s are definite, though.”
“Just hold me a minute? I'm okay. I'm sorry, I have bad timing. I'll be fine as long as you're not mad at me.”
Tony closes his eyes, the weight of the day finally settling down upon him. He can feel himself begin to drift off to sleep, and struggles briefly against the riptide, but Steve just keeps stroking his hair, and he knows he can't hold on much longer.
Steve takes his dick into his mouth and is shocked when he moans again. It’s just—well, Steve looks downright obscene with his pretty pink lips wrapped around his dick, and Tony couldn’t help it. He just had to moan. Tony has himself propped up on his elbows and is looking at Steve in pure amazement as he bobs his head. He pets at his hair lovingly, looking down into his eyes that were more black than their typical blue. Steve looked up at Tony as he pulled away, making Tony whimper at the loss of contact.
"Can I wash your hair?" He asks quietly. Steve smiles and nods, wetting his hair enough for Tony to wash. He bends slightly and Tony gets to work.
“Okay.” Steve says as they reach security. “This is it.” He’s holding Morgan, asleep on his shoulder, so he kisses her head and breathes in her scent. He’s crying already.
“Oh my god,” Steve manages, because he needs to let Tony know how good he is, how good he makes Steve feel, and real sentences are totally unthinkable right now. Tony's jaw works under his hand, his tongue flexing as Steve pulls back. He keeps thrusting up, steadily, and he does try to keep them uniform, but Tony's mouth is so hot, and the sounds of it, wet and obscene, are driving him crazy. Tony lets out a choked whimper when he goes a little too deep, throat convulsing, and Steve backs off with a chain of
When Tony arrives at Steve's room, he stops himself at the door. He’s not sure what to expect. Collapsed lung. Internal bleeding. Broken bones. The images swirling through his mind aren’t pretty. With a steadying breath, he opens the door.
“What a thing to say when you’re sucking face with your very naked boyfriend.” Tony chuffs, connecting their lips again. Steve chuckles into the kiss, pulling away for a moment to ogle some more at the naked man in front of him.
2:00 on Sunday afternoon is their time. That first Sunday, Tony gets Morgan down for a nap earlier than he’d like to usually, but he wants her to be awake and alert during the call. He explained to Peter that Papa only has an hour, so he needs to pick the most important things to talk about. He can’t really say anything else, he just wants Peter to get the most out of this.
“Okay,” Tony says, and he doesn't look weirded out, even though Steve is paying really close attention to whether he might be. “Okay, not touching you because I don't want you to space out while we're still talking? But I'm guessing it's a good kind of spaced?”
The idea of being so close, so connected, always blew Steve’s mind. Pulled from his trance when Tony’s breathing picked up again, Steve kissed Tony’s forehead.
“Sorry to scare you,” he says, but Steve just hums. His dream is still pressed against him, like Tony, like the firm warmness of Tony’s chest to his back.
“You,” Tony says standing, getting into Steve’s face. “Are not my keeper. You are my boyfriend. You are supposed to love me and support me, and I have to say, Steve, I don’t feel supported lately.” Tony flattens his palms against Steve’s chest and takes a deep breath. “We’re in college, Steve. I don’t know if you noticed, but we’re kind of paying to do work, so I’m sorry if sometimes I get preoccupied in actual reason I’m fucking here.”
