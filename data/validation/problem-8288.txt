“One question. The truth.”
Tony did not, as it was, expect to survive long. Sure, he had Erica and Abe's team working on cryogenic suspension, and a solution beyond that, but he also was painfully aware that the odds of that working in time were low. Experimental procedure for a condition without precedent, the fact that no one – except one supersoldier who couldn't be used as an example because of the serum – had been successfully frozen and revived, the possibility that even then he would just start dying again... He'd take his chance, because not doing it ended with him dying anyway, but that was it.
“Not with you being Secretary of Defense, no.”
There was a look in Steve's eyes, just for a moment, and Tony's stomach turned on itself. He knew that look. That was the look Steve gave him – both of him, Iron Man and Tony Stark – when he didn't believe a word “Mr. Stark” said but had no actual proof to back it up, and so didn't say a thing.
That got a smile out of him – but it was cold, humorless and possibly a bit disturbing to see on his face; not that the skrulls cared about who he usually was.
So Steve winced.
Then, of course, because it was the best idea ever, Steve and T'Challa had Cloak teleport everyone in the middle of New York, in front of the Baxter Building. They could have brought the fight to a field in the middle nowhere, but no, Manhattan was a much better idea.
He'd been toying with the idea for some time, but until now it wasn't like Steve had needed another shield, and Steve had made it clear he didn't want Tony's help, long, long ago, if he could do without. But now Steve didn't have a shield anymore.
Or did you just decide it was wrong because you didn't like the idea, went unsaid. He didn't need to antagonize Steve. Steve hadn't yet turned around and slammed the door, so.
Tony gave the man a small smile at his knee-jerk attempt to find something good to say to counter all the accusations Tony was burying himself under – but the fact that he didn't actually have anything to say about it, in the end, said enough.
He couldn't even remember, he had no idea how that happened, even though the SHIELD files could tell him, surely, but that wasn't the point, the point was that Tony didn't remember, and the last time it had happened it had been with Kang and his split personality – or whatever that had been – and the time before that was when he'd been drinking.
The thought that came to him was deeply unpleasant, and therefore Steve shoved it under the rug of his conscious to focus on something else.
The second thought was, obviously, that he really didn't want to go at it again with the ghost of Stark this early in the morning.
“Uh-Oh. I sure hope you like the taste of your own leather boot, Cap.”
You could trust Captain America with a lot – Captain America was a good man – but Tony doubted he could trust Steve Rogers with a way to find out who Iron Man was and not expect him to look. And, even if Steve proved him wrong, even if he settled with knowing that indeed, Iron Man was in the database – even if Steve acted on his principles here, and not on his personal anger – wouldn't that be cruel?
No one had anything to say to that. Namor, though, snorted.
If he even still cared, after the reveal.
“Is that the part where I'm supposed to pretend I can't smell who's under all that metal?”
“I... Back then, I thought Tony had... I thought...”
Of course, if Captain America himself couldn't see it, Tony shouldn't have expected that from a child he barely knew either. What had he been thinking?
Hank's – or not Hank? – voice reached him through a veil of suffocation.
Next thing he knew, he'd be accused of being behind Stamford.
He was a bit surprised when she gave him a loose hug, her bionic arm cool even through his jacket and t-shirt. It made him think of Bucky for a moment.
Also, what was he supposed to answer to that? He couldn't be honest with Steve on that, he just couldn't, because if he did that, if he answered honestly, he didn't even see how Captain America, of all people, could end up liking him, even just a little bit. Tony was the worst advocate ever to defend Tony's personality – if honesty was involved; if not, he could do a very good job of presenting himself as a somewhat passable human being, decent enough, but mostly recognizable because of his great efficiency. But that was all he was, in the end: a tool, perhaps a highly valuable one, one that allowed people to be saved or helped often and efficiently, but still a tool – no matter how valuable, a tool could be sacrificed if it was to save a person, and though the sacrifice could end up being costly, it was still justified.
It angered Tony to a point, as he looked around, at the ruins of Hala, at the corpses of men, women and children of the Kree that were visible here and there under the rubble, that Steve couldn't even begin to consider that something had to be done, morals be damned, or all this would happen again, on Earth, somewhere else maybe, and it would be their fault. And by upholding the foolish belief that they could not kill, Steve would have failed – and would have brought everyone else here to fail – in protecting the lives of innocents.
But Tony was also thirty-two and dying over there, in Captain America's arms of all people, and had been twisted into a shadow of who he was supposed to be – to become – by a time-travelling despot and he'd just been killed by himself – which felt disturbingly cathartic in a murder / suicide way but let's not talk about that – when he had been twenty-two and hadn't lived through all the physical pain he now knew – emotional pain was another question, obviously, and not one he wanted to talk about to anyone – and he really, really hoped the kid would have enough self-preservation not to get himself crushed by his expectations of Captain America and his actual relationship with Steve Rogers amongst a lot of other things.
He didn't even want to hear it – not again.
Besides, the man seemed happy with everything “back to normal”, so there was that. Maybe keeping the status quo was the best Tony could get.
How did he formulate that? I wanted to know where the hell Tony disappeared to? As if she'd answer something like that. Tony's employees – when they didn't get it into their heads that somehow he was ripping them off or the general cause for global warming – were loyal to a fault, because for all the flaws people tried to pin on Tony, the man had always paid his employees better, had always given them good working benefits, had always listened to their concerns if they were founded. Tony was one of the privileged rich, yes, but unlike with most of them, the dripple-down effect did exist with him.
He'd hoped, but he hadn't believed it.
“Jesus Christ, Shellhead, come in. Come here. Whatever this is, we can fix it, okay? I've got you.”
“You know, we'd prepared a way out for you, and then you just had to go and get yourself shot in the middle of it.”
But that was Tony did, anyway – he kept pouring himself into anything that was worth it, even if he didn't believe in it, even if he didn't believe it would work, just because he might be wrong, and, at least, if it didn't work, it wouldn't be his fault. It wouldn't be because he hadn't tried hard enough.
Better than the alternative, Steve guessed. He should go and see Jarvis, tell him that...
“Interesting, isn't it, how you're one of us, T'Challa, one of the 'good guys', one of the super-people, and the king of your country. Even putting aside the obvious issue of power play, because while I'm certain Storm is acting out of concern for human and mutant rights, I also know that you cannot allow your personal morals to entirely overwrite your duties as a king... Even putting that aside, T'Challa, I find it interesting that a country whose king is one of us, and thus has the legitimity and the ability to deal with any superpowered issue, is rooting for the freedom of action of heroes.”
Steve sounded hesitant with his next question, and Tony immediately understood why.
Tony looked away from the glass of bourbon, and back at the self-proclaimed hallucination.
Maybe Tony's imaginary Cap would have been disappointed in him, but he wouldn't have been disgusted; he'd probably have told Tony he wasn't good enough yet, but that he could do better, if he tried hard enough; that there was still hope for him, that he believed him to have the potential to be more, that he wasn't a lost cause yet.
Then, Steve got up, not a protective ball of resentment anymore – still there, of course, but less... – and hugged Iron Man before Tony could react. Not that he could tell what exactly this supposed reaction would have been, or should have entailed.
Tony was wearing a hot pink vest with SUPERSTAR written on it, a mock-gift from one of his previous casual girlfriends – one of the rare ones who had actually cared that he wasn't dead in a ditch somewhere, she had always been too kind – which he was wearing anyway because let not it be said that Tony Stark couldn't rock everything and anything. The only times he didn't look perfectly good – if not fashionable – were usually when he was well on his way to “not fine”. Otherwise he'd probably be able to wear eyeliner and a potato bag and look good in it – not that he'd want to, but if he had to do it, no way he'd act ashamed and let anyone know he didn't actually like it.
“So you want to talk about why you're really supporting the SHRA now?”
Well.
Steve, being the asshole he was, did neither of the two things which could have made this bearable: instead of just walking out – disappointing, but not surprising – or demanding an explanation and refusing Iron Man's rebuttal – which would have been right in line with his general disregard of Tony's wishes and decisions but could have also led them to actually try and do something productive – he decided to mock their friendship.
Don might understand, because just like him, he was a liability on the field, but he also couldn't understand it all, because unlike Tony, Thor wasn't a liability on the field. Tony was still Tony under the armor, and all his problems were still there.
Whoever shot Happy probably wouldn't have gone through with it if Tony had already been dead – because, let's be honest, the odds that Happy had gotten the attention of someone willing to kill by himself, instead of because of Tony, were not great.
He and V'ra were eyes to eyes, now.
Steve gave her a tentative smile – she had sided with the law during Registration, but she'd also helped him and the others occasionally, and he wasn't quite sure what to make of it. Especially of the fact that Tony had... let her do it? Sure, he probably hadn't been happy with her and her decision that one time, but she hadn't been amongst the prisoners at Prison 42, so.
He was decidedly not taking his – not-so-sweet – time to get back to his flat – where Bucky and Sam were staying right now, and where he could ask the questions that had been plaguing him since he'd come back, but hadn't been courageous enough to actually ask until today, not that anyone was actually giving him answers – when he heard a woman's voice calling him.
There was no point trying to be that good, it just wasn't possible, and Tony was tired of trying. All he wanted was to sleep.
Two meters away on the left, three screens down, the video of how that very same woman – he recognized the voice, now – had proven that the person he'd have to trust was, obviously, not her, or else she wouldn't be trying to steal from him. Not particularly surprising, people loved to berate him when he didn't trust them fully and without question and then they acted as if it was his fault when he trusted someone – or not, for that matter – and it turned out they were snivelling bastards.
He turned around, and smiled at Steve, for real this time, despite everything that was going on, despite how he had dreamt of blood on his hands and it hadn't even been only a nightmare, despite the fact that he couldn't go by without a drink a day, when it wasn't more.
“You mean, that V'ra?”
There was no ghost of Tony Stark here. Nothing had been said. He hadn't heard Stark's voice asking him “and then what, Steve?”. There hadn't been an enumeration of all the ways Strange had not necessarily made his choice because he thought Steve was right, that maybe he was doing it because he thought the consequences were not worth the principle or whatever other reason could push him to do what he did – and what he hadn't done beforehand. And that, of course, it didn't mean Strange hadn't done it for the reasons Steve thought, that maybe he had, but there was still the possibility that he hadn't, and
He was bereft of clothes, without his chestplate, imprisoned in a magnificent example of a cell that he'd probably be looking all over with enthusiasm if he wasn't jailed in it, and about to die. And, hurting, but that went without saying, because even with the chestplate his chest kept hurting continuously, so there wasn't really a point in pointing it out.
“No one told you about Jarvis.”
Steve did not break the bowl he'd just taken to pour some milk in it – Stark's voice, even though the ghost wasn't saying anything about that, sneered in his ear that most unrespected prisoners in the galaxy weren't quite so coddled, and Steve did not reply that a gilded cage was still not freedom, but only because that conversation wasn't actually happening.
It might be a ghost. Or not. Perhaps it was an interdimensional echo – if that existed, but he'd found out over time that almost everything existed, even the things you'd never have imagined, and if they didn't exist in your universe, then they existed in the universe next door.
Or, at least, to listen.
He wasn't exactly surprised.
Hill raised an eyebrow at him, and did not stop filling her report on... apparently the slime attack in San Francisco. Somehow that kind of shit wasn't even surprising anymore.
He saw Steve clench his jaw, and wondered if he was more pissed at Iron Man or at Tony Stark – because obviously this was all Tony Stark's fault, it couldn't be because Iron Man himself didn't want Steve to know. Which, fair, but not considering what Steve knew, and what he thought he knew.
Sounded more likely.
The door wasn't even closed, and he stopped himself on the treshold.
Questions he'd asked, back when he'd thought Tony had lost it, back when he thought Stark had sold them out.
“Hot date, Shellhead?”
“Damn it to hell.”
It happened all too often, actually.
He waited inside the mansion. The dead husk of his home, of the place where he grew up, of the house where his father yelled at him, and cried when he thought Tony wasn't here, where his mother tried to be there for both of them and eventually ended up not being there enough for either of them, least of all for herself, where Jarvis made sure that Tony lacked nothing, if for the presence of his parents. The place where neither Howard nor Maria came back after their accident.
He wasn't in love with Indries – not yet – he could tell because, well, it seemed he had apparently gotten himself a sure way to assess whether the sentiments were that deep after the fact: whenever he was in love with someone else, he stopped thinking about Pepper or Steve in that particular way, except for the fact that he still knew the truth about it. He just... stopped thinking about it. When Tony was in love with someone else, Steve went back to simply being his most important friend, if not his best one – that was Rhodey, by the way – and Pepper went back to being Happy's wife and a friend, instead of a hopeless infatuation.
Tony could see, on his armor's internal displays, that Tony-over-there was dying – and now, had died – as the older man synchronized their armors in one last effort, throwing all the intel he could into Tony's armor. He didn't have the time to finish, though, and his heart stopped beating.
He had a small, dry laugh as he took the whole helmet off – breathing the mortal gas in, knowing full well was he was doing.
Stark, of course, was nowhere to be seen – was it for the better, because Steve didn't want his gloating presence here on the street? Was it for the worst, because Stark couldn't even stand by what he'd done? In the end, he'd rather believe the worst from Anthony Stark, because then he couldn't be disappointed anymore.
Not that, even with a moment of confusion, Steve wouldn't have been able to take the criminal down.
Those thoughts almost came in Stark's voice, but the ghost wasn't saying anything, and this was definitely in Steve's head – then again, what wasn't? Was the ghost here, or was it a hallucination?
Iron Man excused himself from the team as soon as possible, and came back as Tony Stark just as the others arrived. He was going to greet Steve Rogers to Avengers Mansion himself. The man deserved that, after all he had done for the world, after what he had lived through, after he had been told there wasn't anything left of his world for him to go back to.
“And in that case, the others step in, Misty! When one of us fucks up...”
He wasn't quite sure if that meant...
Steve scowled, and spit “A surrender!”. He didn't even look like he was listening.
“Because I'm not entirely convinced by his bullshit doesn't mean I disagree with everything he says, be it because of what he did to me or not. Mostly, I'm unsure if he's telling the truth about how he got me on his side, but he is terrified of something and if it terrifies Kang the Conqueror then I want to know what it is.”
Well.
Anyway, the comment about his attire was because Steve had eyed him judgingly – not that he wasn't used to it by now – when he'd had first caught sight of him, just so you know. Because yes, Captain America got to judge people on their clothes, too.
Rhodes gave him a weird look, and Janet pinched her nose.
He took a deep breath – he couldn't afford to cry, he couldn't, he didn't have the time, the more time he lost crying on himself was time he lost before the next blackout.
Steve didn't like the look – pity – Carol gave him at that, especially as it really wasn't flattering – disgust, he thought, but he wasn't certain, and it was Carol, she knew him, she couldn't possibly think he really believed that not being 100% human meant you weren't a person, that changing into something else also made you someone else. She had to understand that it wasn't because of what Tony had become, but because of how he'd behaved afterwards – because that hadn't been Tony, it hadn't been, it had been just a shadow, Tony would never have done that, he wouldn't have...
What was certain was that it hurt, and Steve wasn't quite sure why it should, but it did.
He looked back at his friend one last time before leaving, and gave him a last hint, one that Steve, as usual, wouldn't even try to understand, which was why it wasn't dangerous to tell him.
Peter jumped at Tony – Iron Man's voice, and turned to look at him with a deer-in-the-highlights look. Why exactly, Tony wasn't sure, but this was Peter. He got startled and looked vaguely guilty for no reason on a daily basis.
Tony braced himself for whatever was going to be said now, half-afraid that yes, Cap was going to confirm his suspicion that there was nothing he could do as Tony Stark to get close to his already-but-didn't-know-it friend, half-hoping that at least this way he would finally know what he had been doing wrong, what he needed to correct to get a chance. If he knew what he was doing wrong, for once, he could do better from there.
Except, it didn't change the fact that it was after 03:00 in the morning, and Steve wasn't sleeping, and Tony wasn't sleeping, and they did need to speak, and... And if Steve didn't like Tony Stark, he did like Iron Man. He would talk with Iron Man, and perhaps Iron Man would manage to make things better for Steve.
Jan looked like she wanted to argue, but didn't. Probably because she understood that it was, indeed, for the best – even if that best was shitty.
Sometimes he felt like his life was “throw me in the worst situation you can imagine and I'll still come out looking better than you because I can't afford not to”, though occasionally it took him some time to come out of it.
“Where is he?”
And of course, Steve wasn't entirely wrong, but it wasn't like Iron Man was someone he needed to start a new team. Captain America might not have been an “original” original Avengers, but if he went out without Iron Man by his side and asked the others to join him and form a new team of Avengers, no one would stop him.
So yeah, Tony was relieved that his armor was still there, and not only because he was only wearing a red thong – what? He had wanted to try and see how it felt, just because you have to be informed to actually know what you were talking about, and it was virtually impossible to wear a suit under this particular model of the Iron Man armor.
“I want an explanation.”
Hill's fake smile took an ugly spin, which she didn't even try to hide.
Iron Man didn't have to put on a mask, considering Iron Man was a mask to begin with.
Not exactly surprising, considering she currently had his mind in her brain, on top of her own.
How many slights aimed at Iron Man himself, whenever the subject went back to Tony Stark and Steve just couldn't figure out why, maybe, Iron Man didn't hold the same contempt he did for his boss?
Shapeshifter? His enemies were rarely supportive – not that his friends were either, but not the point. LMD? Nick might want to contact him that way, but this certainly didn't sound like him at all. Too polite, and way too supportive. Could be, however, a self-aware LMD who really liked him – sentient armor, hello – and had become self-aware – that too had already happened, which had kickstarted one of his numerous heart attacks, right before the synthetic heart.
Tony just hoped he hadn't behaved too much like Iron Man, too familiar, during the lesson. He might have a very good control of himself, of his body language, but he wasn't a robot either, and sometimes he slipped up, especially when there was no immediate threat to deal with and no one's life was on the line.
“Mr. Stark made me this shield, and he gave me this shield to shut me up. So I wouldn't come here and find you and stop you.”
Steve wanted to argue, because it wasn't true, because he did his part and then others had to do theirs too, because it wasn't his job only to make sure the world was fair and good and perfect, because he couldn't do everything alone, in the end. But he remembered Manhattan on fire, the Baxter Building in the orange light of open battle, and the first responders going against him, because he'd had an enormous part in causing that situation, because he had been about to kill Stark, because, because, because...
Hank – well, Tony had to say he hadn't seen that one coming, not from Hank of all people, but maybe that was what the other one had been saying, maybe this was what he'd missed, wait, no, what if he was an hallucination too – sneered.
Steve certainly wasn't going to.
Tony always knew why he was so miserable; he couldn't help but be an optimist, even when he knew perfectly well that there were no reason to be anything but a pragmatist in this world. He was a freaking paradox of hope and despair, and he had never known how to fix that, one way or another – sometimes he wished he was more stupid, less of a genius, that he could believe in things because he wasn't be intelligent enough to really understand that wasn't how any of it worked.
They didn't actually sound like they were asking – confirmation, perhaps, but no, not even that, it sounded like, like...
Under his breath, Don... pleaded?
He hated crying in general.
Steve could understand the precaution.
Not that he needed the chestplate anymore, but still. And that was only the last concern on a long list of concerns about people – even Steve – knowing who Iron Man was. The less important one. His continued survival, in itself, wasn't so important – no, he didn't particularly wish to die, thank you, but if he did, it wasn't like it would matter that much. Unlike many people seemed to think, Tony wasn't so full of himself that he'd think himself to matter that much in the grand scheme of the universe. The others things, when you came down to it, mostly boiled down to the fact that he wouldn't be able to work with the Avengers the same way anymore, if they discovered who he really was – if they were still able to work together at all.
A thought made itself known, and Tony squinted behind the faceplate.
“I got carried away.”
Misty let out a sigh – he wasn't entirely sure why – and looked around.
Steve rolled over in his bed, and tried to bury himself in his pillow, just in case it cut off the ghost's voice.
It didn't matter. Either none of them got out, and they died, or one of them got out and managed to free the others. One way or another, an end would be coming.
By which he meant, everyone he thought needed a lecture about ethics, morality, and righteousness, by yours truly, Captain America. Because only Captain America knew what was ethical and moral and righteous.
A week passed, and Steve found out what was happening. Kind of.
Maybe that he wouldn't rot in jail for about as long as he'd spent in the ice.
“What happened is that no one said anything. The few of us who have our suspicions about what happened, about who killed him, don't have any kind of evidence to back it up, especially as SHIELD is keeping it quiet, possibly because Tony's last wishes said to do so, because he always knew how to prioritize, and it never mattered to him what would be the personal cost, beause he thought it was better that way. Because, to him, his murderer being brought to justice wasn't worth the consequences to the community.”
Locked back into the duty of forcing himself to become more, to give more, to try and be enough. Because anything less would be selfish.
His eyes first fell onto the alcohol – in everyone's hands, on the tables and counter, on the wall – and the first thing he thought was that a drink would be welcome to deal with this. The second was that he should put it all on fire.
He wasn't sure whether he was talking about Iron Man and Tony Stark, here, or of Steve Rogers and Iron Man. It didn't really matter, either way, because Steve wasn't going to understand, because he never did.
Emma gave him a smile back that was about as fake as his own – there was a point, he mused, between people who wore masks, at which letting others see the falseness of the masks was as close an admittance of kinship and honesty as possible, and wasn't that a particularly unpleasant realization?
Steve probably thought Iron Man was crying because he didn't want to do what he was doing, though, that he didn't want him mixed up in it because it was wrong, when Tony really just knew how a stain could come and mar a good name even when it wasn't deserved.
The look on Steve's face as he punched Tony – as he punched Iron Man in the faceplate told him enough. Steve could have done it because he thought it was necessary, but here, it was before all an act of petty revenge.
He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks, the snot running down his upper lip, and when he talked next, he could barely understand his own words.
Steve hadn't believed him, so far, whenever he did say the truth, but depending on the question, he could... There were things he hadn't told anyone, because no one cared, and those who did would almost certainly cause more harm than good shall they learn about it, but if that what it took to get Steve's ear, he'd say it. Hell, even if he asked something like, is it true Stark will go for the post of Director of SHIELD, he could say it, and the answer wouldn't be what Steve expected, but if he had to say everything, to talk about Kooning, to admit that of course this wasn't him who'd asked, that he didn't want to...
Of course, that meant Tony had to listen to all the things about his other life back there – that he didn't remember, because he'd been outed to Magnus after the business with his father and thus Iron Man simply hadn't been available for the attack on Genosha, if Peter was to be believed – and consider the things it might mean about him and that he didn't want to contemplate anymore than Peter did.
Still, Steve didn't want Tony's apology for Iron Man, so he guessed he had to go “in person” and deliver them. He hesitated a moment, but eventually turned on his heels and went to get the armor, back to the mansion. Jarvis told him Steve had gone back to his room, but just barely, which meant by the time Iron Man would get there he wouldn't have started anything – Iron Man wouldn't be interrupting.
This time, though. This time it made him laugh.
“Who are you?”
Tony arrived a bit late at his meeting with the Fury-LMD – which Tony was reasonably sure was working as much for Hill's SHIELD as it did for Nick himself no matter what anyone else thought on the matter – about the global summit, just in time to hear Dugan inform Nick-who-wasn't-Nick n°28 that Tony Stark had definitely blown a casket, and wasn't that worrying considering all the pies he had his fingers in and the fact that a superhero worked for him?
He turned back around to look at T'Challa, because hell if he was going to let anyone think he couldn't say it while facing the ones he accused.
“I wanted to thank you, Iron Man.”
That was when it really started, no matter what the trigger had been.
Not that any of this mattered, when Steve couldn't even bear to have a conversation with Tony Stark, and Tony Stark couldn't afford to let people know he was Iron Man.
Steve Rogers was Captain America, after all, and Captain America was always fair.
He needed it, to be able to go on and not... fry himself with a modified EMP or something.
“That being said, you were crystal clear here. No place for my cancer here, huh? Give my regards to Ororo. Tell her I'm sorry I couldn't stay.”
Because the moment he did that, he would say goodbye to any sort of future friendship with Steve Rogers – as Tony Stark.
No need to worry them, right? He'd been injured, but it hadn't been as bad as they'd first thought – he didn't comment on who were that “they”, and, by the way, now he was going to have to call up Nick's latest LMD and have Maya, yet another old friend, arrested.
Loud and clear amongst the other voices, in the ambiant chaos.
A door opened, and a marshal, a nurse, a doctor and Nick Fury walked in.
Steve woke up with a sharp breath, and.
Before Steve could say anything – he was feeling a bit lost, to be honest, and that probably had something to do with the fact he'd lived his shooting twice and he supposed the right version of events was the first one, considering how the doctor had summarized the event, but then what had been the second version? Had that version been a dream, finally, and not the first one? – the doctor and the nurse left, leaving only the marshal and Fury in the room with Steve – and Stark, except...
Steve wasn't going to leave, and he wasn't going to help.
Easier than to accept the truth – that sometimes you disagreed on things, even with the people you loved the most, and that you could only blame the two of you, because in the end, no matter the circumstances, no matter the influences, you made that choice, and the other made their choice too. Easier, of course, to decide that someone else was to blame for your divergent opinions, for your inability to reach a compromise, to give in, or to convince the other otherwise.
“Thanks. I... would have liked to hear it from Iron Man.”
The president, who'd taken the post only a few months prior, on the other hand... Tony wasn't certain his predecessor had seen the need to tell him, though it was entirely probable that he'd called him just after Stamford just to share the news.
“Cap? Steve, what's wrong?”
Tony wondered how long he would be able to continue fooling himself on that point, how long he would be able to pretend that Iron Man didn't have all the problems Tony Stark had, and the very fact that he wondered about it probably wasn't a good omen.
Tony wasn't sure what would be better, for Barnes to be alive but out there and somehow controlled, or for him to be dead and not under anyone's control. Of course, Barnes being alive meant that Cap might get him back, but as someone who'd actually been used again and again to commit crimes, Tony could say how cruel that would be for the – young? – man too, to come back and understand what – whatever – he had done in the meantime, what he'd been used to do. Supposing they ever managed to get him back, which was far from certain.
Tony could feed SHIELD all the bullshit he wanted about Randall Pierce being fired and responsible for everything – and yes, he had had to take the Mandroids out, too, even if they were working for the government, because 1) they could be stolen from the government, and 2) the governement had already tried to use them against the Avengers, and guess who had been blamed for it on both sides later on? – but Steve knew better, if only because he had no faith in Tony's word.
Tony frowned at her.
That did the trick.
And sure, superheroes hadn't, for the most part, asked to have powers, they hadn't chosen to have an assault rifle in their hands, but the things was, they did have it, and deciding that their rights were worth more than the rights of others not to be threatened every day of the week by someone who had an assault rifle and no control over it – or worst, over themselves – wasn't any better than the contrary, and would just get more people killed.
Steve, though, Steve would gamble it all, all or nothing, because he had no idea – because he didn't want to know – what “nothing” really was.
“I... I'd barely woken up from the lies the government had me living in. I was struggling to get my memories back and acknowledge that our present was my future, and when I left my flat for the first time after I'd moved, I thought about getting a drink. You were drinking coffee and you immediately recognized me, I wondered if perhaps SHIELD was keeping an eye on me.”
Nothing made sense, and he hated that, and he couldn't come up with an actual explanation to all this mess but he was still going to say it out loud for Steve because if he didn't and it turned out he was right and something was rotten in the state of Denmark, then he'd have deceived Steve and that wasn't something he was willing to do without an actual reason to do it, just because he was afraid of the consequences to himself and himself only.
“And you, Tony, are you my friend?”
Someone Captain America wouldn't be ashamed to admit to knowing.
It was incredible to hear Steve argue about his own righteousness when he had next to no clue as to what the situation really was like, when he could barely judge what was going on because he only had a fraction of all the factors.
But no. There was no saving the situation.
Tony had to be mistaken, though.
Eh, Steve probably thought Tony had gotten off scott free of the latest situation. Maybe if he hadn't been too busy hating him, he'd have seen that Tony was, in fact, dealing with the consequences, that he was, in fact, trying to help where he had made mistakes, that he had, in fact, a conscience. But no, Steve was, as he had always been, unwilling to look past the appearances.
“Who else knows?”
“Are you sleeping with him?!”
He wasn't sure how Steve would take that, but what he meant was that no matter what, Iron Man would defend Steve's life. Though, knowing Steve, he'd probably take it like it meant Iron Man would always agree with Captain America / the Captain. Which wasn't likely.
He couldn't take the risk, either.
The LMD continued staring at him intently, and sure, it did look like the actual spy was here.
A terrible thought crossed his mind, and it made sense, how could he not have thought of that, how did he not – Nick had to have informed people about who was in the Iron Man armor, now, it was the logical thing to do, hell, Tony would do the same just so that they'd put a bullet in his brain if it was so easy to make sure no one else got hurt, except you'd need a special bullet and who was to say that 1) he'd let himself be killed if he'd really gone mental, 2) the person who was behind all this, supposing there was one, didn't have other plans even after Tony was done for.
Except that plan was obviously shot with Steve's presence, and later on Tony would admit that the problem of the prisoners left his mind not long after the stand-off started, which allowed them to escape and cause more damage, exacty what he had feared would happen with his stolen tech.
Steve stopped for drama, then let go of the damned name.
Tony failed to react, mostly because he wasn't particularly surprised that Steve wouldn't let it go. The man could be like a dog with a bone, and the fact that they'd gotten into a relationship had only made it even more actual with basically anything that pertained to Tony.
A blue and red woman – mutate, probably, this was the Savage Land – had come and put them all to sleep, and – and what?
“Right. The point. Tony's injured, badly. And that's when it starts getting wild, because he's babbling about how he's fine, he's alright, he's not injured, he's not going to die, which, okay, I would be panicking too, but the lamp post disappear and all of a sudden he's not injured anymore.”
He needed to leave and go take care of his actual problems.
Of course, if they kept superheroing without authorization afterwards, they'd go right back on the list, but Tony could manage a minimum of compromises within the purview of the Act. If no major catastrophe happened in the next two months, he might even succeed to push for a voluntary, default reserve statut.
“Not, not that.”
They'd spoken, Carol and him, about her having missed him, about his funeral – he still hadn't watched the video, he didn't want to watch the video, he wouldn't watch the video. Sam had told him what it'd boiled down to, anyway, including the fact that he'd had to step up because Tony hadn't wanted to give a speech in his honor. Or something. Sam hadn't been exactly precise with the details of the ceremony, and Steve was grateful for that. He didn't want to hear about how they'd put him in the ground any more than absolutely necessary.
“How is it, out there? No open chase on innocent citizens?”
Tony stilled, politely waiting.
Even if Steve didn't care.
Barely not dead.
“No one told you about Jarvis, right?”
“'Was thinking, boss... At first, I didn't get it. Why doesn't he tell them? Why doesn't he show them? But with everything going on... You're one of them, sure, as in, you're going around superheroing and risking your life for all of us poor sods just as much as any of them, but, thing is, I don't think they do consider you one of them. Or, you know, that they would, if they knew.”
...was planning to go back home to ask his two best friends where his former best friend n°3 had disappeared to and why they'd let him. Considering neither Sam nor Bucky had thought it important enough to tell him yet – worse, maybe, that they might not have wanted to tell him, that they might have thought he didn't want to know, that he'd rather never speak of it again – well.
Steve gave him a smile that took over his whole face.
Tony groaned and caught his head in his hands, trying to squeeze the headache away, perhaps.
“...I'm not sure as to what you mean, Tony. Of course I care.”
“Man, you're giving me a headache. I'm not promising anything, though. The moment I think we'd be better off with Steve knowing who you are, I'm spilling the beans.”
Janet was the first one to talk, looking a bit pleading but keeping her distance nonetheless.
He didn't turn around to look back at her, but did not take another step.
He was more partial to the idea that love was ugly more often than not, that it could push and burn and scar until there was nothing left in its wake but ashes and anger whenever the circumstances didn't allow for it to be peaceful.
For Steve to stop saying how much he believed in Iron Man, only to show how much he had no trust in his judgment, no intention to ask and understand why they might have differing opinions on something – Tony wasn't asking Steve to change his mind just because it was him saying so, but... It would be nice if Steve would be willing to consider he might not be entirely wrong.
Maybe both of them.
Tony did die.
So maybe he was a bit of a hypocrite, but hey, if that was what it took to make it work. He'd sell his soul if he had to – and if there was a guarantee that whoever he'd have sold his soul to wouldn't double-cross him, and since that didn't exist...
Luckily a chance to prove himself came right to their doorstep. Tony wouldn't count it as a win, though, considering what transpired then and the cost to Wanda.
“You can trust Iron Man at Cap's back.”
Tony wasn't sure why, but he almost wanted to laugh, right then. No matter what Steve went by – be it Nomad and his frankly revealing outfit, or the plainer Captain of today – you just coudn't take Captain America out of Steve Rogers.
Tony wasn't the one ruining SI, he wasn't the one responsible, but it didn't change the fact that for now, he was unable to save the company, it didn't change the fact that he wasn't good enough. People depended on him no more, and he was acknowledging that.
“We'll see what we can cook up, but you'll have to provide the reasoning and the proof for each of them. Now, to get to the point: what do you want for yourself, Mr. Stark?”
...That probably was truer than Steve thought it to be, but.
He had dozens of speeches he could give Logan, right now, about why the Avengers could be a good thing for him.
He didn't believe it, but he could be wrong. It happened.
Steve didn't confront him about still being the old Iron Man. No one did.
He looked back up at Steve, sharply, and there were so many things, so many things he could say about that one line, but he couldn't afford to antagonize Steve, not now, not ever, and none of those would cut the deal.
No one liked to talk about that, and the fact that he'd thought of it first didn't make it any less hard to speak about out loud.
Maybe because he couldn't fathom looking at his friend when he'd tell him that no, he wasn't innocent – nevermind that Steve wouldn't do that, or at least, that he wouldn't do that with so little info. Maybe because he was ashamed of even asking, of making it about himself yet again.
Tony wasn't surprised by Steve's decision, of course. Barely disappointed, at that. It wasn't like he didn't know the man, by now, and how bloody idealistic he could be even though he called himself a man of practicality.
Tony wondered if, should he unmask now, Steve would go back and burn anything he'd ever gotten from Iron Man.
They needed the rules, not for those who didn't need them, but for those who did. Just like they needed prisons, not for the law-abiding citizens out here, but for those who weren't.
“Actually, I was calling about you.”
A carefully pleasant smile, not too open – Rhodes had made it obvious that they weren't close, not at all, even if Iron Man and Captain America were, when he'd told Tony about his relationships with the rest of the Avengers, or at least all he knew about it. Visibly relaxed, but not physically reaching out. A precise choice of words, made out not to sound willingly chosen.
Unlike many people seemed to think, Tony knew he could be wrong – no, more than that, he knew he could not be enough, while still being right. Seeing a situation for what it was, instead of for what you wanted it to be, didn't necessarily mean that you knew how to make it better.
“I can't even tell you why I'm doing half the things I do, it's like I woke up the other night with a whole past I can remember but can't ultimately understand and it's a past that makes me a pretty shitty person. So, once again, Steve: why do you care?”
Reed was the one, later on, as they were on their way back to Earth, to ask.
“Steve... You do realize that none of us, except Clint and the likes, and, yes, Tony too, before... None of us are really human anymore, you know that. Not by the standard you're dictating here, at least.”
Oh God, he was tired. He had a feeling he was forgetting about something important, but what? He couldn't remember – what was it, about four obligatory hours of sleep a night to be able to function normally? Or was it three? No, three was from before he became Iron Man, when his physical and emotional activity hadn't been quite as strenuous even if his mental activity had been roughly the same – which didn't tell him what he was forgetting, just why.
At least his mechanical heart hadn't given out, as it wasn't directly linked to the armor. Small mercies, he could still be kind of useful.
“I... don't understand. If it's not sex and it's not money and it's not secrets...”
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony couldn't – not this time, not again, not with everything else – do it. He just couldn't. Normally he'd have gritted his teeth and let it pass, but this time he just... He couldn't. He needed to get out of here. He needed to...
Wilson stared at him for a moment, then pinched his nose, eyes closed and brow furrowed, before shaking his head and exhaling loudly.
Then she looked back at him, as she reached into her pockets to pay for – both – their drinks.
The words weren't the same either.
The look she gave him, then. Steve would have called it pity, perhaps mocking contempt, but he knew he was in the right, and Miss Potts – for all that she couldn't understand, because she wasn't one of them – didn't seem like someone who would support something she knew to be wrong.
He wasn't quite insane, though. He had hoped for, but not expected much better.
A self-deprecating – very familiar – smile.
Those people – except Yinsen, of course, Yinsen was another story – had been enemies. They'd been all over him, and he'd had a reason not to want them anywhere near him and his secrets.
Maybe he should have said something along the lines of “what's important is that he trusts my judgment”, or something like that. But again, he was tired of trying and never getting results – he would probably get over it soon enough, and try again, and regret it once more, but... not this time.
He'd probably be happier if he could spar with Iron Man, instead.
Right, not thinking about it yet. Might not ever become a thing. He knew it could, and that was what mattered, not anything else.
Steve still didn't get, either, that Tony didn't want his pledge of loyalty or whatever it was supposed to be, but simply... some trust. The benefit of the doubt. For Steve to ask, before assuming.
Peter shut down then, a startled look – seriously, how did he do it with the mask? – on his face, as if he'd just realized something. The younger man turned around sharply to stare at Steve, only to let out an anxious laugh as Steve raised an eyebrow at him.
That seemed to amuse the SHIELD agent in a dark way. Hill spinned her pen between her fingers, and leaned back in her chair.
Steve entered the room just then, and Tony – and Iron Man turned back around to look at him.
Steve put his shield away, on his back – which was already better when he thought back on the guardsmen, but didn't mean much, considering that Steve had more than enough practice reaching it in no time to sling it at someone's face.
He'd seen him dead.
Fake-him sighed, apparently relieved, and let himself fall against the nearest wall.
Now that might have been a bit of an exaggeration.
He heard Carol sigh, looked up. Saw her deflating.
Bad choice of words – perfect choice of words. It was exactly what he'd thought. And he could tell Carol understood the exact implications.
“It's alright, it happens to everyone. And I... I'm glad you've got such a loyal employee. We should all be so lucky.”
The skrulls scrambled into... action, he guessed. Most of them weren't warriors – perhaps that guy he knocked out first, but that was it – that much was clear, and Tony's basic combat training – he was an Avenger, after all, and couldn't always rely on his armor's capabilities, thanks Cap for that – was enough to take them out.
That is, not at all.
“Something to convince me?”
“What happened is that Crossbones was at that window, and Stark caught it before any of us. He sent the armor to detain him, and went to you himself. Which ended exactly the way the doctor told you. With Stark dead and you treated here for two weeks. We're investigating the rest of it.”
A moment of uncomfortable silence, Iron Man with his hands still extended, but slowly receding against his body. Then Steve broke the silence.
One of the marshals – the darker-skinned one, the one who semeed to be the most considerate towards Steve, given the circumstances – turned around to confront the man who'd thrown the tomato, and...
The President coughed politely and gestured to get the report, which the Director of SHIELD gave to him with a shrug and a scowl.
And before Steve could ask more, the younger man was spinning a web to the next building and disappearing from his sight.
Tony was pretty sure he had tried to convey that, in both his identities, as much as possible along the years, so no, he didn't really know where Steve was going with that.
Steve's number.
Exactly what Steve would have expected after everything that had happened between them lately.
But he understood. That was, after all, a necessary evil of his own choices. You couldn't be in control and at the same time expect people to see past the masks.
“Yeah, but... you do like him, don't you?”
It took him about a week from there to figure out exactly how it worked – to figure it out and to confirm his conclusions, Tony would be proud, in fact, the ghost had told him so himself, though with a sarcastic edge to his tone. He'd have asked Strange, but Strange was busy doing... things, for now. Magic things. Steve knew better than to butt in.
Because he'd surrendered, and he wasn't going to change his mind now.
Steve wasn't saying anything – which was better than him calling Tony out on what he probably thought was actually going on.
The SHIELD agents – the same ones as in his dream, except he'd already seen them the day before so of course that didn't mean anything – told him the exact same things as in his dream about half the time, and they did some things the same way, some things another way. No way to say for sure if there was something suspicious about it.
Something wasn't right.
As evidenced by what happened when Steve woke up again.
“Wouldn't it be better if people knew that you are one of them, that you understand what they are afraid of?”
Tony thought of pointing out that he didn't have the ressources to bankroll the Avengers again – he was still working on the Maria Stark Foundation, on putting it back afloat, and while he could pay for a team, because even broke he still was richer than most, he couldn't assure a continuous support – but mentioning Tony Stark right now would just make Steve even more stubborn, because that was how it worked.
But they weren't there yet, and by then Tony was only vaguely aware that he was missing something important – not what, of course, because that was the point of missing something – so let's go back to their present, with Tony being indirectly accused of having control issues by a “friend” who thought he was someone other than himself.
She leaned in, her bionic fingers curled dangerously around her bottle of beer, and Steve wondered if there was a risk of her strength breaking the glass into pieces, because it was easier than to speaculate on what was coming.
He spotted the red dot before anyone else, of course. Right there, on the back of the marshal's jacket. He turned to look at the surrounding buildings – there, the open window, and the glint of light on metal – there wasn't any time.
It was difficult focusing on Maya's work, with the headache, the pain, the blood he could feel sloshing around in his body, in parts where it wasn't supposed to go, and the general knowledge that he only had this one chance or he was toast – sure, he had been thinking about taking Extremis, maybe, in the future, once it'd have been better tested, once... But no hospital could cover the damage, not this time – again – he knew, he'd been dying often enough to tell, and more than that, his scans were telling him so.
But he also remembered Firepower, and how the government had been so willing to go after him with a killing order, with a suit using his designs – yes, Steve, those designs I was trying to prevent from falling into the wrong hands – and how the use for that particular project was obvious. If a hero died by Firepower's missiles – not much of a problem now, not with him having utterly destroyed the suit and not with the cost of it, thank you for your hard work, Iron Man – it wouldn't be on Tony, no, he knew that, but the fact that he could have stopped it? That would be on his shoulders.
Too bad Shellhead didn't exist, wasn't it? Too bad that only Tony Stark was there, under the armor, and obviously Steve didn't care about Tony Stark.
If they even cared about what had happened to him. After all, he wasn't an Avenger, was he? He was just the team's benefactor, and as everyone suspected he was the reason why Iron Man had gone on his armors war, wasn't he? Of the West Coast Avengers, only Tigra had come by and left a bouquet of flowers, but he knew she had had a bit of a crush on Tony Stark. The East Coast Avengers hadn't even deigned calling Rhodey, or someone, anyone, to ask and learn if the news were true, when Tony had yet had to be operated on – he knew, of course, that some of them were in their own shit, so he couldn't expect them to have called right away, but he also doubted that any of them would do anything about it later on, after being finished with whatever they were doing.
He'd probably think this was Iron Man choosing Tony Stark over him, when really, it was Tony choosing what he believed to be right over Steve. Picking what was right over Steve.
Cap tugged at his gloves, and Tony wondered for a moment why the man even had the uniform on inside the mansion. Not that he could talk, with how he never got the armor off as long as he was posing as Iron Man, and not as Tony Stark. It reminded him, for a moment, that it wasn't Steve Rogers giving him a hand, but Captain America. Because Captain America was just and fair, and would help even Tony Stark, but Steve Rogers wasn't Tony Stark's friend.
They were alone at the Yankee Stadium – or, at least Tony hadn't brought anyone; the proximity scans seemed to say Steve was alone too, except Steve's side, like Tony's, had teleporters. So, privacy was relative.
If there was no one who could tell them when they went overboard, how could they trust themselves not to do exactly that? “We're heroes, we don't need your point of view” wasn't going to cut it.
Anything. Until the others came back, he needed something to do not to think about things he couldn't do anything about.
A disturbing smile, and an answer.
Steve wasn't with them this time, still busy with whatever mission was occupying all his free time lately – it was important, it seemed, because Tony wasn't sure he'd seen Cap this angrily focused since, probably, Zemo and Vespugia. He absently wondered about what he'd think of this story about Tony Stark's heroics, but ultimately he didn't think he actually wanted to know – what would it be this time, that there was nothing heroic in basic human decency, in refusing to kill Magnus, or perhaps that Tony hadn't not done it because he was a hero but because he wouldn't have had the guts to face the consequences?
Of course, things changed right after they finished their handshake – and Tony couldn't even say he didn't like it better that way, because leaving things unsaid might make it look like they agreed not to talk about it, but more often than not it just turned out that one, if not both, of the people involved simply hadn't seen fit to discuss their decisions. That way at least he might have a chance to convince Falcon if the man didn't get it already – and if they couldn't come to an agreement, well... At least Tony would be warned.
“Of course you do.”
Steve made a face – not really disgusted, but slightly irritated nonetheless.
Fortunately, Steve went on before Tony had to find an appropriate answer to that.
It was short, controlled. Wary.
“Lives are more important.”
“Please...”
Sometimes it wasn't.
Hill had said “personal circumstances” had taken Tony off the position of director of SHIELD and head of SHRA. She'd said...
Deal with other people's messes, and be blamed for it as if he'd started those in the first place.
“No need to answer, obviously we've done our homework. And I must say, it is impressive how few people do actually know Iron Man's secret identity. Humans are a really stupid species, aren't they?”
Sure, he had hoped. Sure, he had had that wild idea that, perhaps, Steve would have had enough faith in Iron Man to believe that he knew what he was doing, Tony Stark's orders or not. Sure, he had thought that, maybe, something more important would have come up and Steve'd have been too busy dealing with it to get in his way.
Now if only Steve could go to Richards for that too...
But Extremis was repairing the damage already – no matter the damage, as long as there was a coherency to what was left behind, as long as his brain wasn't too damaged.
Unarmored.
“Yes?”
No one ever talked about the fact that the ends justified the means, only as long as the ends were justified too. Probably because it was more than difficult to be absolutely certain about whether or not the ends were justified.
The man gave him a look and Tony had to refrain from taking a step back – and in his eyes, there was that question to which Tony couldn't answer, not at all, because yes, he was the same man as the one dying in Captain America's arms, but no, he wasn't him, obviously not, and how did he even start explaining that without mentioning that it was Tony Stark who had just died in – Steve Rogers, the files Tony-over-there had dropped onto him said – Rogers' arms?
Her smile was cold.
Not that anyone would believe Tony if he told them he was Iron Man – a bit like in that novel by Dostoyevsky, he wasn't quite sure which one, when an old and respected man confessed to the murder of the woman he loved and no one believed him, thinking he had become mad with grief, except in Tony's case people just couldn't believe him to be self-sacrifying enough to be even a little bit altruistic.
But it was alright. Rhodey would do well as Iron Man. Rhodey was the only one he could trust with the armor, with the skills of a pilot and the heart of a hero.
The two skrulls looked at each other with a smirk, and the first one drew out a – a what? It looked like a stun gun. Tony really, really didn't like it.
“This one's different. I don't think it's going to go away. I don't think they're messing around this time.”
Well.
Janet took a step towards him, but her eyes were drawn to the screen where Kathleen Dare had just shot Tony and left him for dead.
Time to add one last personal comment, because it wasn't like anyone else ever dared to show Steve his own shortcomings, when Tony's were constantly thrown into his own face.
Focusing back on the conversation, Tony tried to come up with an answer to Steve's words, knowing full well that his own position on the matter was, in fact, the very same, but since he had brought it up he had to defend his “doubts” about Cap wanting him there.
But they'd have told him if something had happened to Jarvis, right?
On the other hand, no one else than Clint himself and those somehow knew who he was had noticed a thing, and wasn't that cringe-worthy?
The door was pushed open a bit, and Steve saw Peter's face appear in a dim light. When the younger man saw he was awake, he pushed the door wide open, and Steve recognized both Jessicas, as well as Luke Cage behind him.
Tony just stared at his friend for the longest time, as no words or explanations came to him – he was pretty certain he'd know if he had been doing something like that to Jan, and since he didn't, and Jan wasn't one to lie like that, he...
He wondered if maybe Steve thought he had let Iron Man be killed. Likely, considering that Steve didn't think him concerned with his “employee”'s welfare. Then again, Steve also didn't believe one word Tony could utter, so he might as well be thinking that Iron Man wasn't, in fact, dead – it didn't matter that it would thusly mean Tony was protecting Iron Man. Who knew.
Some could make standing in those ruins of everything that was and could never be again, worth it.
Steve lay down next to him, and not long after Tony felt a hand searching for his, fingers entrelacing – and he went along, because no matter how selfish it might turn out to be, right now he couldn't deal with the low, dull pain in his chest and reject Steve's comfort at the same time.
It didn't matter that he had been ready to let it end because he couldn't bear it anymore – Steve would probably, if he cared, which he didn't, not when it was about Tony Stark, Steve would say something about life being beautiful and hope being the only thing you needed to live, and that Tony, sorry, Iron Man should want to live because of that. But as it was, Steve didn't care, and would in fact certainly agree with Tony that he had to live because he had responsibilities and no right to hand them over, no matter how much everything hurt.
“If you'd been his friend, you would have worried about the bullets he took for you all, instead of blaming him for the few he couldn't stop.”
Not only the ghost seemed to be able to tell whatever Steve was thinking, but he also knew things that had happened in the other world, things Steve hadn't explicitly thought about in this world.
Steve just didn't understand that this was Tony facing his past actions, the things that his weakness had allowed to happen while he was wallowing in alcohol. It was him taking responsibility for what he had allowed to be taken from him, and which could be used for evil.
As if that mattered. Killed “who”.
Not that Steve wouldn't be a catastrophe – on both a personal and global level, because he'd hate the job and wouldn't have the flexibility to make it work – in that role, but hey, apparently that was what it'd take.
Even when he knew he was right, he didn't really believe it.
He thanked Steve, not totally sure if it would actually do any good, but he had to try, didn't he, and if he didn't take the helmet off right in front of Steve maybe this had a chance of working.
Pepper hadn't either, nor Happy.
Tony snorted, and gave him a paperclip version of the events with Hydra, Bruce, the armor, and the fact that he was now a cardiac cripple because karma was a bitch and apparently he'd deserved it – but, surprisingly enough, not enough to outright kill him, when really, pain was a terrible punishment but it also meant he was still in a position to make more damage, whereas a dead Tony Stark would be utterly unable to do anything, good or bad.
“Of course you didn't mean it like that.”
The man continued squinting at Steve for a moment, and just as Steve was about to say something, snorted.
And after that, what, Steve? What would the surviving people would do, after that? What would they do, after having proven to the people that they would not listen to their concern, that they wouldn't even consider the fact that they were dangerous, that means to deal with them were needed in case something happened?
To be frank, T'Challa had probably been playing a role during that card game, but. As everyone knew, even in roles people tended to tell part of the truth, if they wanted it to stick and seem real enough to the ones who didn't know about the role.
Tony Stark wasn't as good a man as Iron Man; however, Iron Man was as flawed a man as Tony Stark, and Cap had yet to see that.
Except Steve would either not believe it – not yet, he hadn't seen enough yet, even as Tony could see the actual storm brewing on the horizon, he'd barely begun to believe – or be completely affronted, which would help no one, especially as that would probably be the moment he'd bring the mythical great american nature up again and still not take it like a serious menace.
Steve's eyes shot open, and.
At this point, Tony felt generally bad about eveything in his life, so.
As it was, during the next few months, Tony barely had the time to even stop by the mansion for anything else than taking Iron Man's mantle, and when he did have the time he always ended in the workshop tinkering on the armor or taking care of something for SI that he had forgotten to do at the plant. He had exchanged, what, maybe twenty-three sentences with Captain America, and most of them were limited to “Hello” or “I hope you're doing well”. That was hardly going to make them friends.
Good news, though, Rumiko and him had gotten back together – until the media shitstorm had her going back to Japan, especially as people didn't like the idea that their future Secretary of Defense was being chummy with a foreigner, the assholes. And yeah, he could see their point, and yeah, he'd seen it coming, and yeah, Rumiko and him had talked about it, but shit he'd gotten a ring and it still hurt no matter how much you tried to rationalize it.
There was a pattern here, and it wasn't a new one, at that: anytime Tony chose to do the right thing, it came back and bit him in the ass, but he did it anyway.
Of course he did think that.
No, it was easier to pin his actions on his “control freak tendencies”, which was frankly hypocritical coming from a man who thought that anyone who draped themselves in the American flag was their responsibility, especially if they did it while committing crimes.
Sure, the company would have a hard time following his death, but it wasn't like you couldn't find someone to replace him. Tony Stark was good, but he wasn't unique. What he didn't invent, someone else would. Maybe not exactly how he would have done it. But it would happen anyway.
“You accused me of never inviting you into my home, T'Challa, unlike you did, and maybe you were right, but you were also wrong.”
And maybe, maybe it wouldn't be enough. But it would still be better, and at that point that was more than what they had.
Still not taking the helmet off – he could probably check for more things spying on them with his scans than the device could, anyway – Tony snorted.
Sue had slapped the drink out of his hand – he'd been about to pour it from the top of the tower, but well, at least this way there was no temptation left – accused him of being insane, of puppetting Reed, of destroying their marriage, because why not, after all, Tony was the root of all evil, wasn't he?
He had come there to talk about Zemo, about Steve, hadn't he? Not to talk about himself.
Tony wasn't sure he believed that – come on, skrulls, anyone? – but for now he didn't have much of a choice so he complied and did his best to get back on his own two feet – he was having a hard time with directions, he was probably still half-drugged, sue him. The skrull was probably trying to lull him into a false sense of trust so that he'd spill about... well, something. But, Tony did with what he had, and right now he didn't have a lot, so.
Which, yes, kind of him, but. Problematic.
Steve just looked at him oddly while Clint excused himself.
Tony, at least, regretted that it had come to this.
Or, you know, Captain America.
“I like to keep an eye on any piece of technology that walks around with my face, and anyway I need to make sure the world doesn't take on fire while I'm not available. Hill isn't a bad agent, but she's not cut for being at the top. Second-in-command, maybe. Still, my question. Did you get all that, Stark?”
He could hear, in Cap's voice, that he didn't doubt Iron Man's innocence, per se. It was good – the contrary of what had happened with Bethany back in City Hall, and it had been awful, and he had said things he shouldn't have said, because Bethany didn't know, and Bethany disliked Iron Man, but she didn't dislike Tony – but still, it left the possibility that Tony wouldn't be able to prove “Iron Man”'s innocence, that no one would believe it – and it wasn't good, because, knowing Steve's opinion of Tony Stark, Cap probably didn't trust “Tony Stark” to defend Iron Man properly, and that, that hurt.
“I was about to...!”
He couldn't breath. Always, always back to it. Steve wouldn't care that people did know who he was, even if Iron Man told him, even if those people were the President of the United States, Director Maria Hill, and the Secretary of Defense. As long as “Iron Man” wasn't in the database, he'd call him a hypocrite – which, depending on how you looked at it, wasn't quite false, except, in the end, this wasn't about the database, was it? It was about Steve's access to that database, about the fact that he wouldn't be able to go and look him up, about the reality that, in the end, Iron Man didn't want him to know who he was.
Yes, of course, because obviously Tony couldn't be trusted with protecting his bodyguard's most important secret. Either Tony was a liar who couldn't tell the truth when asked, or he was a bastard for telling the truth, no middle ground. Damned if he lied, damned if he didn't.
He should... He should give Steve the overrides. Pepper and Rhodey had them – he'd thought about Happy, too, but the man had said he wasn't good enough at estimating if it was actually needed or not, he didn't want to blow it, so – but they weren't here right now, and he didn't want to endanger Pepper while he wasn't even sure if he was sane himself.
Diplomacy really wasn't his strong suit.
The ghost looked with Tony's blue eyes at the bread Steve had just cut into two pieces, as if to point something out – what, Steve had no idea, but that was Tony all over. Always meaning more than he said, and sometimes Steve thought that was because the man couldn't manage to be honest, and sometimes he wondered if it wasn't simply that there was too much to be conveyed, and words only weren't enough – or, as the ghost kept talking about so much more than Steve could actually take in, that there wasn't enough time in the world to say everything he thought about.
The open window.
Because it was the right thing to do.
There was a tentative smile on his lips, and Tony could admit that he yearned to see it turn into a ugly grimace as Steve would be confronted with the truth. Just to prove that for all his promises, Steve wasn't as good as he liked to think.
He did.
Captain America.
Steve wasn't done, though.
That would go so well, now.
Steve was probably thinking about how this was all going to end if he went at it hard enough. Because it wasn't like Iron Man – Tony Stark – wasn't the source of all evil. Because it wasn't like there were actual reasons behind the Registration Act – oh look, New York on fire, wonder how that happened – and because it wasn't like there were other people behind this all who would take out the heavy artillery the moment Tony stepped down.
But Steve Rogers wouldn't be Steve Rogers if he didn't think he could make miracles happen if he was stubborn enough about what he wanted – just look at the current situation.
He remembered thinking, long ago, that once Cap would get to know Tony Stark, just a little bit, just enough for it not to be a complete disaster, he'd... He'd tell him, maybe he'd show him.
He also heard Nick Fury's voice, calling for him to stay with them, but...
“Yeah, you're the only one of us with a weapon.”
Seeing as Steve was glaring at his bowl of milk – Tony would ask where was the coffee in all that, and what the milk had done to him, but the ghost wasn't Tony, Tony wasn't here, and Tony would never be anymore, because he'd taken a bullet to the head to save Steve's life – nothing more was said on the subject – for now.
“Some days I feel I can barely do this, with you.”
A glass of alcohol could make these doubts recede, at least partially, to let him focus on what mattered at the moment. It wouldn't be a problem, as long as he didn't let it become more than that, as long as he didn't drink enough to forget entirely the worries that kept him in check.
Peter looked at him weirdly and bit his lip.
Still, it was the right move, wasn't it? To provide Captain America – sorry, the Captain – with a shield, so that he could battle against the forces of evil at top efficiency. Even if the man would almost certainly classify Tony himself as one of those evils, soon enough.
Tony gritted his teeth, not to say exactly what he thought of Steve's stubbornness.
He'd like Steve to prove him wrong, this time. But he'd have liked that the other times, too, and it never happened.
Well. Steve was in a dive with Clint, and Iron Man would stand out. Not only that, but Steve would almost certainly refuse to listen to Iron Man right away because he was stubborn like that.
Aside from Stark's presence, and a few questions thrown his way by the journalists, things went mostly the same as in Steve's dream, up till...
He was still in his cell. This had all been a dream – Steve had his fair share of problems, and PTSD might be one of them, but anxiety wasn't part of it, but he guessed dreaming about what could go wrong this day was entirely plausible, considering he was putting himself in a position of vulnerability, in public, when he already had so many enemies, more than a few willing to see him die. As for Stark dying in his dreams...
Which he already did as Iron Man, whenever Steve wanted to learn about the future – Tony had been tempted to propose to do it himself, but before he could manage to say it out loud Steve had tried to clap him on the shoulder, like he did to Giant Man or Thor, and...
Steve took a step towards him, a look on his face that Tony – that Iron Man associated with Captain America looking at civilians and checking whether or not they were about to snap because of whatever had happened just before.
For a moment Tony felt a surge of rage and... and fear at what the aliens had done, at what they could do to the Earth after that if they wanted to, but that didn't make any sense, hell, he himself was more than able to lay waste to his planet with the right weapon, the fact that the Kree were aliens had nothing to do with that. Still, the fear receded – as in, still here, but logical, no more important than his fear that one day Magneto would manage to enslave all baseline humans or that AIM would end up opening a black hole around the Earth – leaving only the anger.
Killed someone – again, because that was what happened at one point or another, Iron Man could save as many people as he wanted, Tony Stark could pay for as many rescue efforts as he did, it would always come back to this – and wasn't that bad enough already?
The point being, Tony Stark had not, in the end, proposed to Steve Rogers to show him the future, but Iron Man had. So much for trying to befriend Steve Rogers as himself. It was safe to say that, all things taken into account, Tony hadn't really tried yet.
They all looked back at the dead, armored man who had been Tony and yet hadn't been.
Before Tony could ask what this was all about – and yes, you'd think people who wanted your death and / or suffering, which was apparently Hank's case, supposing that was Hank, of course; you'd think they wouldn't answer, but villains, and ill-intentioned people in general, actually had a weird tendency to monologue – the dot on the device flared gold, and the world pulsed around him.
He didn't say anything about how he hadn't even received an “invitation” to this meeting, how he'd had to hear about it through “Mr. Stark”, as “Mr. Stark” was the one who made it all possible – his mansion, his money, his contacts for the most part, his responsibility when it didn't work, and his blame when people thought it wasn't enough.
Sure, Cap could, potentially, have fallen in love with Iron Man's personality and not care at all about his body, but that was a new hornet nest if Tony ever knew one, seeing as Steve didn't like Tony Stark's personality, not one bit.
Of course, Tony, stubborn as he always was, had managed to be both, to become the first and stay the second. Which had put him through so much pain...
Steve was almost snarling at him, as he went on.
“...managed to prove his point that superheroes couldn't be trusted at every turn...”
Steve managed to look up, past his own wound, to make sure that Tony was still over there, and not unmoving and unseeing on the ground next to him, to make sure...
When Steve woke up again – in the other world, in the world where Tony had died for him, and now that he was here and not there, he had the feeling that was the worst of the two deaths – the first thing he thought was that he actually could consult Richards on the matter of his rather unexplainable and unexpected twin realities, if only he managed to win his trial – whatever winning might mean here.
Not that way, at least. Not directly. There had been the Randall Pierce fiasco, and all those questions which answers all rounded back to the fact that Iron Man was Tony Stark, but never, never an actual question about his identity.
“Look out!”
Because right now there was another situation in which the both of them didn't agree, and neither of them could afford to agree with the other only to please him, because it was the easier, personal choice.
“Well then. I'll see you when I see you, I suppose.”
One of the Jessicas – right now Steve couldn't tell them apart – patted Peter on the head and pushed him out of the room.
Steve caught Stark rolling his eyes in the corner of his eye.
But he knew himself well enough, he knew how much he could control what he gave the world to see, and while he was aware that he wasn't in his best state right now, he probably gave away less than anyone else would. The Avengers would probably be able to tell something was wrong, especially those who had known him for some time already, but they wouldn't know what to make of it – no one ever did. People made assumptions about how he felt, about what he thought, about the fact that he couldn't have just as many problems as they did, and generally they were wrong in those assumptions.
When she closed the door behind him, Steve realized he hadn't asked his question.
The theories some of the women he spent his free evenings with came up with were frankly ludicrous, and it always amused Tony when they told him what they thought after the third or fourth date and they still hadn't done more than holding hands or a peck on the cheek – at the beginning of his life with the chestplate, Tony had been worried that, on top of being unable to have a sexual and romantic life, it would keep him from having casual relationships with women, but he had found out soon enough that a lot of them actually enjoyed being able to just spend some time with him, with someone who would listen to them and not particularly expect anything out of them afterwards; and the few who didn't like not being able to get into his bed, he just didn't see anymore. Some thought he was way more old-fashioned than his reputation suggested, and was looking for the right person – which wasn't entirely false, as it was, but not the actual reason for him not sleeping with them. Some had theorized that maybe he didn't like sex and just wanted female friends – what was certain was that he didn't crave sex half as much as the tabloids implied, but no – or that he just didn't like women that way but still wanted female friends – Tony certainly wasn't gay, and hadn't, in fact, ever found a man sexually attractive even if he wasn't opposed to the idea and recognized that they could be aesthetically pleasing to the eyes. And those were only the more common explanations they had come up with. He never really tried to argue any of those, and apparently it had become a game between the circle of women who had become his “platonic dates” and not minded, to try and undo the mystery of Tony Stark.
Steve still didn't get it, though.
Steve gritted his teeth as Iron Man looked in his direction for a moment, and turned back.
Better not to taste to make sure.
Anyway.
And maybe it was wrong, but maybe it was true.
“I don't give a rat's ass about my sexuality, Steve, it can be as nuanced as it has to be and I'm not going to lose sleep over it, because people are going to talk shit about me one way or another. Not saying I want to broadcast it for the whole world to see, but I'm comfortable with myself on that point at least. That's not the problem here, the problem is that I have no idea what I was thinking in almost all of the actions of my life, including us getting together, and most times I can extrapolate but here I just can't. Can you?”
He had, in fact, almost managed to convince himself not to try.
What was Tony thinking, believing that Iron Man, the murderer, could comfort Captain America?
– it was more to keep himself from thinking about all the reasons why it would have been a catastrophe, and that had nothing to do with his thong – which, by the way, was a definite no from now on, because it just wasn't practical with the armor. Being willing to try anything – within reason – did not mean he had to like it all.
He was useless.
Steve was smiling, and Tony almost wanted to point out that he had given him the opportunity to get to know about Tony Stark, and Steve had rejected it. But Iron Man couldn't know about this as far as Cap was concerned, and this conversation had been about making Steve feel better after Zemo, not about blaming him for not wanting to be the friend of a man who probably didn't deserve it anyway.
It was just that he didn't respect who that secret identity was, but eitherway, not the point.
An unpleasant – thin, fake, forced – smile took over her face.
“Captain Rogers, I don't want to talk about Tony. Not with you. Not after everything you did. Not after everything you didn't do. So if that's your only reason to...”
“Supposing that by 'disabling' you do not mean killing the newcomer, in which case you'd break the second sub-principle, I have to point out that the morality of such an action depends only on the result of said action. Should you be unable to disable your enemy, you would still have retroactively lied to your friend in that you were unable to protect them and still made a choice counting on your ability to disable the enemy, and you would still have failed to protect life at all cost. Worse, should that cost be your own life, should you not only have lied and failed to protect your friend, but also failed to protect yourself, three times would you have failed your principles. Your intent was good, but the result would not be.”
He had, however, more to say on the subject of Registration.
“I promise.”
“Well, I'm offering. If you come to California, to SE here, I'll whip one right up. You can come try it out.”
Or should he have let Steve's feelings pass before his own convictions? That wasn't a question Tony could bring himself to ask, no matter how true it actually was, because it was a cruel question, one that would either ask of Steve to reconsider his own certitudes, or of the both of them to part ways.
His eyes caught the vivid blue glint of Steve's for a moment, and he wasn't sure, but Tony thought the supersoldier might have been conscious – barely, but conscious.
What if he wasn't being controlled by anyone – how, why, who? What if, this time, it was just him...
Not asking why it mattered, of course. Barely not saying that it didn't.
“You see, the other night I was at a party with Pepper, a party I'd thrown mostly to piss people off after I'd gotten away with yet another accusation of grey-bordering-on-black ethics, and she asked me when I'd become... that man. The guy who doesn't care about his employees, only about the money they bring in. The guy who isn't trying to better the world anymore, who's living in it and doesn't care if it's not perfect because he doesn't have to live in the wrong parts of the world. The genius who can see he isn't doing any good but just doesn't care. And the thing is, Steve, I had to guess. I had to tell myself about Rebel and what happened to him, I had to deduce that was why I'd stopped caring, but I didn't know that. I had to think about it, and I'm still not sure if it is it because I can remember the events but not what I was thinking back then, only what I did, and even extrapolating I can't make sense of everything I did. I mean, what's the point of being ridiculously rich if you don't use at least some of your fortune for the best, if you're becoming rich by abusing your workers and bankrupting others who don't deserve it? Even on an entirely practical point it doesn't make sense because if you go too far all the time there's an ever-growing risk of it blowing up in your face when people finally get fed up with your bullshit, so if you ever do it? It's because you have no other choice, because the other options are actually worse. More than that, what's the point of holding onto something, be it morals, be it money, if it doesn't protect anything else as a result?”
“Who know, you might even be the original, though I have no idea how you got out if that's the case. So I'm telling you, as soon as I'm done with you, 'Stark', I'm going to look for V'ra, and I'm going to ruin whatever you were planning here. We're here, and it's too late, you can't do anything about it.”
Maybe Steve would be willing to listen, if they started with baby steps, if he managed to bring him around enough that he could not deny what was going to happen, and that principles only wouldn't be enough to save everyone, not this time.
“I was talking about your other friends, Captain Rogers. The ones you stood by when you decided you'd rather campaign for your own rights, and to hell with everyone else's.”
Not that he hadn't been called reclusive, secretive, and generally insane before.
Something had to give, or they would all be hunted and – at best – put in a dark hole for everyone to forget about them – at worst... either the country or the heroes would be utterly destroyed.
Not to mention the fact that Tony just didn't feel that way about men – at least not sexually; romantically, to be honest... he'd have to think about it. He had never fallen in love with a man, sexual orientation notwithstanding, but it didn't mean it couldn't happen at some point. He knew talks about sexual and romantic orientations had gotten very confusing in the last decades, and frankly he didn't want to label himself with one word or another when there wasn't even a way to know for sure what you were until it was to late too talk about it because your whole life had passed and thus you knew what did it for you and what didn't – the scientist in him mostly rebuked at the way talks of sexual orientation were just so vague and relied too much on identifying with a particular definition that no one seemed to agree on, and not actual facts, to be honest.
So Steve had to resort to mumbling under his breath.
“Jarvis is fine, Cap, don't worry. But, right after... Well, the Skrulls. They got to him. And we didn't know, until. You know. The invasion and all that. Fake-Jarvis almost got away with stealing Luke and Jessica's baby, but in the end the Avengers found Danielle, no problems. And Jarvis is fine... I think.”
Hank – not-Hank – turned a dial on his device, and...
“Nah, it's alright. If that's necessary...”
Of course, there was the matter of whether or not he'd be able to tell when that particular line would be crossed. Which was another set of doubts to add on top of the others.
She had a small smile, and shrugged.
With the Iron Man mask in hand.
Steve's voice had slipped in that frankly terrifying Captain America tone – you know, the one Tony was entirely not afraid of because he was all too aware of Steve's flaws, but that still hurt, like, a lot, to hear directed at him – as if he had any right to...
And, as time had gone by, as Tony had realized what exactly those feelings were, Steve had shown him again and again and again that it would never happen. That Tony Stark would never make Steve Rogers happy.
Even if Tony hadn't been his rich millionaire self – considering the fact that he created a company, Imperio Techworks, from scratch with Tamara and Tyree Robinson while being homeless, it wasn't like it would ever be a permanent situation, but let's assume for the sake of the hypothesis – he liked to think he wouldn't willingly and knowingly endanger strangers just for his own sake – probably not even for someone else, depending on the level of threat and the number of people in danger.
Steve was probably the less practical man in the world whenever it wasn't about how to beat up supervillains, but Tony didn't comment. He smiled, too, and unlike Steve, no one could see that it wasn't a real smile, because no one who knew him was there to notice.
He'd survived a bullet through the skull?
The beeping of the machines stopped.
He didn't even want a drink right now, not after that, not now, and anyway, he had better things to do. Such as getting Iron Man back to Cap.
They left the pub – really, Steve was just following after Misty, because what she was saying didn't make sense, because it couldn't be true, because they wouldn't have, because...
Pepper wouldn't know.
Of course, Steve had squinted at him that one time they'd crossed path at the Mansion, probably thinking something about arrogant assholes who thought they could control the world, but Jan had unconpiscuously gotten in the way and steered Steve away so that Tony could go back to being judged by other people than Captain America.
Tony, unlike some other people, didn't explain “Good” and “Evil” to people, as if he knew and they didn't, no matter what those people chose to think. He did, however, voice his concerns, and hope for an answer and an explanation.
The window broke against his fist, and he viciously wondered if Susan actually understood what Pepper had been asking of him, if she considered he had so little worth as a human being that it was a reasonable demand to make of him – that him not granting it would make him selfish in her eyes.
Which, admittedly, would put an end to his immediate problems. No more Tony, no more murders on his hands. Of course, if there was someone behind all this, the murders might go on, differently, but still, go on, but what was certain was that it wouldn't be Tony's problem anymore.
He was smiling, he knew it, but it didn't feel like it.
Tony.
He wasn't sure what that said about him, that in the end, he hoped for Bucky Barnes to actually be alive, out there, being mind-controlled – at best, brainwashed at worst – for Steve's sake, when he knew exactly how cruel that would be for Barnes himself. Let alone for all the people he'd probably been set against during all those years, people who didn't necessarily deserve what had happened to them.
Now it was mostly making him feel sick – and not with himself.
“I know what you mean, Spider-Man.”
One day, soon, he wouldn't be able to give Steve anything close to what he needed, so he did that now that he could, for as long as he could, as much as he could afford to.
“Let's get out of here, I'm taking you back to the Savage Land. We'll talk after that.”
Tony looked through the window, towards the gates that Carol hadn't walked out through, preferring to take an angry take-off from the garden – he should have her meet Rhodey, when all this would be dealt with, they both had the same way of storming out when they were angry.
It made him wonder why Falcon hadn't told Steve what he knew – or, maybe he had, except Steve had never been that good an actor and he would definitely be doing something right now if he knew. Not that he didn't have an idea why, but.
Tony could see this was going to get ugly – maybe not now, maybe not right away, but at some point, later, there would be resentment and anger, and he wasn't sure why exactly but he knew it, and if someone had to take it then it could as well be him.
In the other reality, Tony was killed in Steve's name, and that was all there was to say about it.
“...range said you'd have a difficult time staying awake the first day or so. I mean, after the shooting, we had a bit of a hard time getting you to safety, especially after what happened with the second shooting, and it might be that you were a bit more roughed up than you should have been in that state, plus I think there was something weird with that bullet, from what I hear SHIELD is all over it, not that they talk to us, but...”
War Machine – Rhodes – and Jan shared a look, and obviously made a decision because they looked back at Rogers at the same time – and if the faceplate kept Rhodes' expression hidden, Jan's expression was telling.
Steve looked puzzled, and perhaps a bit suspicious. As always, he was right to be.
It didn't matter that it hadn't been what he'd meant, because Tony was dead, and he wouldn't be if Steve had done things differently. Wasn't that the exact kind of thing Steve had blamed Tony for with Bill Foster?
Nick Fury wasn't one of them, and he went to get the results when someone knocked at the door.
At this point, he wasn't sure if that was still true. Maybe, maybe not. Depended on your definition of love, really. Lots of people went with the idea that love couldn't be selfish, couldn't hurt the one you loved, or else it wasn't true love. By that definition, neither Steve nor Tony loved each other, he supposed.
