Steve and Tony exchange a concerned look, neither of them quite grasping the extent of what the being is implying. And for the first time, a human expression shows up in its words.
“Because, Steve… We both know what is going to happen if I don’t. And we
. But we already knew that, didn’t we? Because no matter what, we keep coming back to each other, and I know if I just said that, you’d dismiss it out of hand, so I thought I’d use some of the magic you’re so scared of to prove my point.”
and that’s what terrifies him, but since Steve is looking at him like that, and he’s still holding his body as tight as he can against his own, Tony decides that he’ll tell him later, whenever that might be, because right now, he has other plans.
“What the…” he begins, but as his eyes open abruptly and quickly double in size, his mouth refuses to emit any sound at all – and it’s possibly better this way as the last thing Tony wants is for Steve to wake up everyone else in the Tower. Still, finally seeing those blue-grey eyes fills his heart with all sorts of emotions, some too strong to hold back, so before he knows it tears are streaming down his face, and he ends up falling backwards, his back hitting the floor with a silent thud. For his part, Steve is still shocked, staring down at Tony in disbelief, trying to put together the vague resemblance of a sentence. “How is this… possible? Am I… Is this a dream?”
here, but still Tony can tell this is not the first time he has come to this place, which makes him think that maybe it’s just appearances, the guy might just be the best dancer in the room just waiting for a good enough suitor to claim as his companion for the evening. He smirks gently at this thought, and – never the person to back down from a challenge, even a self-imposed one – he decides to go and say hi, introduce himself, finding out whether or not he was correct in his assumptions.
” he pauses, hit by a sudden idea, looking up as he resumes talking: “Wait, do you think it’s actually this… alien who’s pulling the strings, and not Fury? Should we be…
though.
“Hey, you still interested in dating?” he asks, and the sudden question catches Steve so unprepared that he gets stuck midair in a jump, ending up stumbling on the floor, and Tony chuckles as lending him a helping hand.
“I am, but I understand now why I barely ever make it to a second date…” the other giggles, and if he’s noticed Tony’s move, he doesn’t show it nor comments on it.
“Shit. Okay then, you’re coming with me,” Mr. Field says, his voice dripping with desperation, and just as Tony wonders who the

“Okay, um, let’s go…” he mumbles, stretching a hand towards the other and hoping he’s not blushing – but he
And then Steve does it again. And again. All throughout the dinner, he surprises Tony beyond his wildest expectations, doing just about
. I ended up watching a movie with Sam last night – I didn’t
For a moment or two Steve just stares back at him, seemingly not knowing what to do with this information – or with the response itself – but then suddenly a new energy appears to get ahold of him and when he talks again he sounds more sure than anything he’s ever said before.
Exactly how he had anticipated, General Ross ends up being the number one problem to their plan; a couple of days later Tony gets a call back from Mr. Grey, and he can tell by his tone that they have a bit of a situation on their hands.
?,” he asks, arching a brow in his direction and tilting his head to the side, looking a little like an owl.
time. Let’s just focus on getting you out of this situation, alright? Mind bringing me up to speed?”
Steve lets one of Tony’s hands go and then spins him gently around, so that they’re now facing each other; Tony can’t help but smiling widely as it happens, because
Mark grabs his asscheek to make him stay – it’s an innocent move, especially considering his cock was right inside of the other just a minute ago – but it sends Steve over the edge.
“What happened?”
does. The sleep has made Tony some good: now able to stand on his two feet, he holds on to the rail as they get off their jet, just to be on the safe side, but once he gets on the ground, he manages to walk without having to lean on Steve, which makes him feel better. He might not be the sturdy type, but it’s definitely not in his habit to relay so
because he instinctively know they’re speaking the truth. It’s not
“What?!” he almost screams, and Tony can’t help but sighing. Sometimes he wonders just how
“I’ve gotta say, I was quite surprised to receive your phone call, last we’d heard you were… well, off planet.”
“Umm… Have you… figured it out now, then?”
, but the truth is, the lack of improvement is in itself a very bad sign. Wallowing in his misery is not his style, and yet here he is, going through day after day with no thoughts about the future, taking unjustified risks in the heat of a fight, spending every spare moment of his free time in the gym, training for something that has already happened without him being able to do anything to stop it. He’s the one Avenger who spends every single night in the Tower – the rest come and go during down times – mostly by himself except for when Sam drops by to check on him, or Peter knocks on his window to chat about baseball (something that Steve has no doubt Tony asked the kid to do – when exactly, he has no idea). They both stopped by today to invite him to spend the holiday week with them, only a couple of hours away from each other in fact, and since he was expecting this to happen, Steve had managed to come up with a lie constructed well enough to hold, leaving them both convinced he had already accepted an invitation from the other. With that out of the way, he had spent the rest of the day in the gym, punching bags and running on the treadmill, whilst FRIDAY kept screening films about the Second World War on the big TV following his request. After the briefest of Christmas Eve dinners and interrupting a couple of bank robberies on his own – these days he would listen to police frequencies as a person would listen to a podcast – he had come back to his room in the Tower and let himself on his bed with his dirty clothes still on, twisting and turning until sleep eventually caught up with him.
“Sounds promising…” comes the reply, along with hands sliding on Tony’s bum, possessively.
“Janey!”
“And you don’t even live with him, go figure...” Steve replies in an attempt to lighten up the mood, moving towards him. “Lean back, come on…”
And Steve does, giving him just the basic facts whilst trying to not let his voice pull tricks on him whenever he has to mention his most recent past, something he hasn’t fully come to terms with yet. Tony remains silent all the way through, and for the most part, he even keeps his gaze low, making Steve wonder whether that has some kind of second meaning he can only guess at. It doesn’t take long – ten minutes maybe, the years of military training coming handy in circumstances like this one – but by the end of it he feels exhausted all the same, as if he had just given an hour lecture to a university class.
“That must be the cheesiest thing ever, Cap…” he giggles softly, shaking his head and crossing his arms over his chest, trying to make himself look more hardcore than he actually is, because he can’t deny that’s actually a very cute gesture coming from him. Especially considering that he probably… “Wait a second. Did you actually
He has a point, Steve knows it, but that doesn’t mean that he has to like it. He sucks in a breath, trying to decide which strategy has more chances of success. Eventually, he settles for the sympathy card.
Caught in the midst of drinking some wine, Jessica ends up spitting some out of her mouth as hearing these words, and as she fights against a fit of cough, Tony narrows his eyes to his companion who gives him the smallest of winks and a smile, leaving him speechless yet
What was he supposed to do now?
Tony was not expecting such a fierce defense from someone who’s basically a total stranger. He blinks away his surprise, and gives the other a small smile that Steve intercepts. Meanwhile, the private has opened yet another door, to reveal yet another room, although calling it a giant locker would be more appropriate. In there, in all its splendor, is his suit, hung up on metal hooks. His heart takes a dip as finally recognizing something
“Things are bad, Tony, and the way it’s happening brings back echoes of the past I thought I’d never hear again. Only this time it’s happening here and I was part of it – of the government anyway, because of the Accords – and I just… I was feeling torn apart between being a soldier and doing what I think is right, it was eating me from the inside out, until I just couldn’t take it anymore. So I jumped at the first chance I got to do something that I knew would properly piss Ross off; he took the bait, said that I either followed the rules or get out, so I walked. Figured I needed a strategy or a plan or something if I wanted to have a shot at this. Which is what I’ve been doing for the past couple of months basically.”
“Where?” she then asks, and damn, it’s a single word but hits him like a full-blown fist in the face.
At 2 sharp, Tony unlocks the front doors once again and, after a brief nod to the two cashiers, he takes his position next to it, feet slightly apart and hands behind his back. After the chaos of the morning, he hopes the afternoon will be relatively calm and easy-going, although he’s fully aware this probably won’t be the case, being Wednesday and everything. Still, for the first half an hour it seems that his prayer hasn’t gone unheard, as all but two customers make their way inside, both pensioners who spend most of their visit talking about their grandkids “already off to college next autumn! It seems just like yesterday that they were sitting on my lap hearing stories…” Tony can’t help a soft smile from appearing on his lips as he hears them talking, remembering when he himself was a child and would spend whole afternoons listening fascinated to his grandma’s tales about the boat journey that had taken her grandparents over to America. It was sort of a family tradition and although at the time Tony was only fascinated by his grandma’s voice and her natural talent for storytelling, in more recent years he has often found himself wondering whether he’d be able to recreate that same magic with his kid/s, were he to actually have any. The subject scares him, and not a little – mostly because it comes with the realization that he’s getting older, and on the worst days it feels like he hasn’t achieved much – so he often cuts his thoughts short and focuses on Jarvis instead. Still, he thinks now, it’s something he should probably talk about to—
about the Iron Giant, considering what happened the last time he let someone – his father – talk him into using it for something he didn’t approve of.
“That sounds perfect, I’ll see you later then.”

“… They need your
“System: overridden.”
The doctor nods, and Tony is relieved that he doesn’t have to fight about this. “What about… family? Did he have a partner?”
“Yeah, just being prudent, y’know?” he nods before smiling at Steve, and for a moment he feels nervous again as when he saw him on the rooftop yesterday, every thought about politics and the government disappeared from his mind. He wants to kiss him, because he wants to feel safe again and happy and at peace with the world as he had before knowing what was going on, but he has no idea how Steve would react to a sudden burst of affection and he doesn’t want to start with the wrong foot, if that’s an expression you can still use after everything they’ve already gone through.
“Who the hell are you talking to?” comes a familiar voice, and he blinks because it can’t be, can it? His mind must be playing tricks on him for sure. He turns around and of course, the voice wasn’t in his head, it is

“Somewhere in Europe, I don’t have the details. We’re regrouping there, starting phase 2. Have to get out of here before things go even more awry.”
What he’s doing is getting dressed again. Briefs, trousers and t-shirt are back on his body in less then half a minute, and for once it’s not an effect of the serum.

There’s a knock on the door, and instinctively he shoves the drawer closed again, as if he was hiding some secret (which, in a metaphorical way, he is). He clears his throat, stands up and goes to open it. Steve is there, the expression on his face not that different from his own: sunken eyes and heavy heart, lips that haven’t smiled in too long a time to remember what it actually
before then.”
Steve gets up too, mechanically, just to do something because he has no idea what he’s supposed to say even if he so desperately wants to; but he’s never been too great at talking and knows he’s not about to start now. They stare at each other for a few seconds, the same expression on both of their faces: hurt mixed with pain mixed with love; how is it possible for such diverse feelings to coexist not in one but in two people, all at the same time? Tony has no idea, but one thing he does know is that he has to be the one to break whatever spell they seem to be under, or he’ll never get out of here alive, not emotionally anyway. So he launches himself onto Steve, kissing him deeply and for a long time, letting his tongue into his mouth to have a last taste to relish him with, and then, without saying anything, he abruptly pulls away, turns and heads outside, towards his car. He doesn’t stop or look back once as he drives off.
Steve stays silent for a short while, those words running into his brain as they get processed and then accepted; he nods eventually, smiling a bit in his direction: “I figure… that’s for the best. But before we move on, I just want to tell you again how sorry I am. And…” he gets closer to Tony, putting a hand over his mouth to keep him from talking, as he was just about to. “And it’s important to me that you understand this, I am fully aware that my actions didn’t make any sense, I wasn’t being rational, it was all pure… emotion, if you want to call it that. The… lying to you, that is. Not the Accords. But then again, that wasn’t really the problem, was it?” he adds, once again underlining it more for his own benefit. “I’m sorry, Tony.”

The doctor gives him a comforting smile followed by an amicable pat on his back: “I’ll give you a moment.”
“Everything alright?” he asks casually, knowing all too well that if that wasn’t the case Steve wouldn’t have entered the room as quietly as he just did, or held his tongue as he’s doing now.

They’re still kissing when a long blip echoes in the room, and there’s no need for Steve to explain what that is because Tony knows already: time to go. They each take a step back and smile almost shyly at each other, then, before any of them can say anything, Steve starts towards the balcony and he follows, running his fingers through his hair whilst thinking of something to say, because he knows he
“So your real name is ‘Tony’, uh? Suits you better, if you ask me,” the other replies, smiling a bit as he puts the paper away into his pocket before moving towards the desk near the window, bending over it to – Tony hopes – write his own number down for him.
. Then, as if he was watching this scene develop in front of his eyes instead of being the one in control, he lifts his eyes to meet Steve’s, his jaw dropping slightly as he tries to push words out of his mouth – for a reason they seem to be stuck against his palate. When he eventually succeeds, they’re the wrong ones, because his brain has stopped working a good minute ago.
Although Nick can’t possibly know this, he’s just used the one word (and its derivatives) Tony actually extremely despises as of lately:
It’s a poor excuse and they both know it, but luckily for him Tony can sense an overwhelming tiredness bestowing him, so he ends up nodding and patting his companion on his arm.
“… What?” the other man blinks and comes to a halt, as if those four words had literally paralyzed him. And maybe they have.
“You’re joking.”
, given these are the first words he’s actually spoken.
“I feel like you’ve been spying on me, I wonder why.”
“I can’t do anything from here!” Jean says, her voice slightly shaking, although she sounds to be more in control than him. “Once the alarm is triggered, the only way to unlock it is from the outside.”
For a few moments, Steve can’t help but staying still, as if mesmerized by such an unusual view. He has never seen Tony sleeping - at times he has actually wondered if the man even knew the meaning of it - yet what’s even more puzzling, it’s that he’s doing it in a hospital room. His hospital room. But why? Sure, Steve has never spent a night in one - he has rarely had to visit the ER since joining the Avengers - but different people at different times have, and Tony had never spent the night at their side. Must have just fallen asleep, he tells himself, starting to stretch a hand out to wake him up.
gift, you’ll see that you do have one for me after all,” the other replies, a tiny smile on his lips as he nods again: “Your eyes, please.”
Tony sighs deeply when he gets interrupted, but shakes his head and finishes his sentence anyway: “You need to move on, Steve. It’s time.”
“Yeah, it’s a recent… development, so to speak. They’re not conventional glasses though. I’ve equipped them with FRIDAY, so she can scan documents and files immediately without needing to handle the hard copies.”
“Hey, Stephen. What’s up?”

“I… am not sure how to use these things, Tony,” the other admits, raising his eyes to meet his, and he can read a tiny amount of desperation which he doesn’t particularly like.

Tony is barely managing to not burst into laughter the more Rhodey goes on talking, and in a way he doesn’t want him to stop, because it sounds so funny the way he’s trying to make sense of it and how he’s still doing his best to be a supportive friend albeit he doesn’t consider it a smart move. He loves him so much.
“Well… Let’s consider the situation for a moment, shall we? There’s no better time than this for me to check out. Nobody is attacking us, you guys have quite a big rooster of superheroes to pick and mix – I believe you have enough for
“I guess…” Steve replies, and for a moment Tony is glad that the other doesn’t seem to have a clue about their location. “What about you?”
Just a couple of seconds later, four people enter the room – two guys and a woman – and even though Steve doesn’t exactly know what he was expecting – possibly other soldiers like him? – the group is definitely
that makes Tony shiver.
That’s definitely
“Hard to pass on someone when he calls you by your name even though you’ve never met him,” he replies, and although sarcasm is not a weapon he often uses, this time it seems like a reasonable choice..
Looking back at it now, as he’s saying his goodbyes and taking a last, long look around the compound, he can’t help but wondering whether he shouldn’t have just offed himself eleven years ago, instead of building a chunky suit out of scraps to escape. Would have Nick still tried and assemble a team without him? Possibly. But what about when SHIELD went to shit? He took it upon himself to provide the others with a home and financial resources to keep at it, so had he been out of the picture, the Avengers would have ceased to exist more or less in 2014, right? And that would have saved the world (and Sokovia in particular) from Ultron first and their stupid Civil War second; Cap would have never become a fugitive, Bruce wouldn’t have wandered off to a weird ass planet and maybe, just maybe, Thanos’ plan to wipe out half the universe would have never worked out. And this is without counting all the pain and the misery his behavior has caused over the years to people close to him.

of it.”
now. Are you still the one funding this, or it’s the government again? We have no idea…”
“Tony, please, I’m so so sorry…” Steve finds himself saying after what feels like
Frustrated, he lets himself go on the sofa facing the big television in the living room, a deep sigh escaping his lips. He feels like he’s going to go mad if he doesn’t do something other than wasting time around. For a reason or another, he has never had the time - or possibility - to being idle, hence why these days have been so hard. Even as a kid, when he was not in school, he was out there running errands for his mother or working a part-time job for extra income.
idea of basics – which means mostly liquids (especially iced coffee) and only occasionally food (cheeseburgers always delivered straight to his door). He sleeps rarely and badly, twisting and turning into his bed in the early hours of the new day before he realizes just how much of a lost cause this is and gets up, thinking that the sooner he finishes, the sooner Steve is safer, the sooner the plan can advance, the sooner this nightmare of reality will be over. After two days, he has perfected what will be their main way of communication, an improved, twenty-first century version of an old school pager, capable of sending slightly longer messages and almost 100% secure (he gets it down to 99.7%). He’s so excited about it that immediately sends it over to Steve’s mailbox and, as soon as he receives the signal back, he frantically presses three numbers: 823. He doesn’t

“Right away, sir.”
to lie and say something like “Sure, last time I checked I was a genius!”, but knowing at the same time that it’s impossible here: “I don’t know how, Steve. I… don’t think it’s possible.”
“Let’s wrap this up,” Tony eventually nods, the biggest smile on his face, “There’s a cute guy I really want to ask out back home.”
There it is, the question he has been thinking about nonstop for the past few hours. He knows what his ideal solution would be (“Fancy a holiday, Steve? I’d visit during weekends!”), but alas, that’s not even worth bringing up, he already knows what the reply would be. So he goes for the third down his list, the more practical and – in certain aspects – legal.
Once everything is done, he gets closer to Steve – who is now learning from Jocasta how to make floral crowns, if you can believe it – and sighs, wrapping his arms around his neck from behind and leaving a kiss on his head.
“Casted off, uh?” Steve comments as he sees him making his way back to the pit, letting himself go to the seat just next to his.
“What do you mean, what I’m doing here?” Steve replies, smiling awkwardly as if hearing a joke he doesn’t quite understand. And he doesn’t even know how to further elaborate on that, not at first at least, because the wedding just happened yesterday and it still hasn’t sunk in yet. “We… We’re on holiday…” he says eventually, making up for his laconic answer by squeezing the other body tighter and placing a kiss on his cheek.
“Tony?”

“Mr. Grey, thank you so much for finding the time to meet with me.”
“I knew a fella once who seemed to really

“Do you want to walk home?” Steve asks him once they’re done with their dinner – yes, they split the bill as if this was an actual date, and what about it? – although is snowing and it’s cold and they’d be better off calling an Uber.

in his body compared to the artificial one he has been breathing for over twelve months.
They end up eating in silence, finishing their meal quite quickly – Tony realizes only halfway through that this might actually be the first food approaching his lips in more than twenty-four hours, although he doesn’t surprise him too much – and after their dishes get taken away, he casually leans his hand over Steve’s again who, quite predictably, immediately glances over what’s happening on the table. Only this time, Tony opts for a different strategy: he just ignores it.
and that’s just how it’s going to be – he doesn’t think about
With the AP finally out of the way and a couple of weeks free from international commitments, Tony can finally divert all of his attention to figure out a way to sneak his glasses inside his office, as no matter what Nick claims, he’s fully aware that no journalist or audience would ever take seriously handwritten copies of whatever deal, no matter how dangerous or criminal that might be. The breakthrough arrives on a Friday night/Saturday morning in early May, when he manages to come up with an algorithm which should obliterate the metal detector’s signal for just a couple of seconds in a way that – he hopes – would be impossible for the human eye to register. He tests it against every security loophole that he can think of, and when it passes them all, he feels confident enough to try it on the big stage – and which better day than on a Saturday, when the office is less busy than usual? With that thought in mind, he finally collapses on his bed, telling FRIDAY to wake him up at 9 so he can go in.
“Did you write me one as well?”
for a physical contact to let them out in that moment. But he has had plenty of time to think about it all during the last three months, and now he just can’t wait to be alone with him, to spit them all out, raw and emotional as they might come.
“I could say the same thing without even having to lie!” the other chuckles in delight, turning around the corner to the cashiers section to start counting the money. This is a banter they have almost every morning (except for when Mr. Grant is late) and although it barely changes, Tony likes hearing it over and over because it gives him some sort of inside peace just before the dull routine that could change in a split second (but never actually does) starts.

“Oh, no, I was just thinking that I don’t mind you calling me Cap – usually it annoys me. But
that?” he asks, frowning a bit but amused nevertheless.
Tony takes a deep sigh, looking down: “My lab…” he admits, because he just doesn’t see the point in lying, and besides, he has made the other a promise to not keep things from him ever again, so why would he start now?
Tony, who has been staring at the weapon since it made his appearance, needs a couple of seconds to remember his training and put it into action, so to speak. He shoots what he hopes to be a reassuring glance over at Miss Goodwin, who is trembling like a leaf by now, and then tries to get closer to Mr. Field, but before he can even complete a single step, there’s a deafening noise in the air and this time Tony knows at once that the situation has just taken a turn for the worst, because there is clearly a

idea.”
“Cheers to that…” echoes Carol, nodding, and Steve is glad he isn’t taking a sip of any sort of liquid right now because he’s quite sure he would have ended up spilling it out of his mouth and all over the table.
Yeah, Tony knows it all too well, because it had been a struggle for him too. He sighs, and for once instead of going with his usual sarcasm he stays silent, leaning his cheek on Steve’s shoulders and closing his eyes, breathing in his smell as who knows when he’ll have a chance to do it again?
“Of course I want to remember you,” he eventually replies, and his voice trembles slightly as he says it, a small victory for the organ sitting in his chest, which now seems to be beating a bit faster than normal. “I’ll call you tonight, okay?”
“Here…” Steve says softly, reaching back with his hands to unlock the chain around his neck; a moment later he’s flashing his military tags in front of Tony’s eyes. “I seem to remember that you liked having them with you a few years ago.”
As it turns out, he didn’t need words to fill in the gaps.
With their drink and food orders out of the way, Tony decides it’s time to test the level of the conversation game Steve would bring to the table while on a date, so he asks him to start talking about the first random thing that pops into his mind. The other takes a few moments to think it over – Tony stops himself from rolling his eyes as he can’t believe Steve actually doesn’t have a reply ready – but when the other eventually does, he wishes he had been more patient.

He shrugs the hand off – something he wouldn’t have actually managed to do if the security guard hadn’t loosened his grip himself – and smiles to Pepper, following her back into her office as she nods at him to. Much to his surprise, it’s still full of boxes and the furniture is randomly pushed one against the other in a corner of the room, all except the big glass desk that stands boldly right in the middle, a laptop opened on its surface, and two chairs in front of it.
“I can think of one reason why you were needed back here…” Steve starts, smiling at him the way he always does (or so he gets told, he himself has no idea he smiles in a particular or different way whenever he looks at Tony) and nodding for him to get close.

“Don’t claim to be. I’m just practical. And right now, we don’t have time to quarrel over minutiae like this. Finding Iron Man is a huge thing, I agree, but our initial mission hasn’t progressed any further, and we still are in a race against time. So I need you to tell me about what
The other man stops talking now, and narrows his eyes at his friend as to try and figure out who could he be possibly talking about, but after a good ten seconds, he just shakes his head in defeat.
“Go get them” is the prompt reply.
“Nonsense. You’re feeling okay now?”
The voice seems to be coming from the ceiling, absurd as it sounds, and it’s impersonal and somewhat metallic even though it’s got a female touch to it. Tony’s eyes gaze up to spot any speakers or a radio or
“Do you think… this could ever happen? Us dancing together in a room full of people, nobody caring it is two men?” he says eventually, surprising even himself although he has often wondered about it.

In about ten minutes they reach the hangar, which makes Tony forget about the ring and his suit for a few seconds, because what he sees completely takes him aback. Aircrafts had always fascinated him, back in the day, to the point that for a (very) brief time he had even considered becoming a pilot – the idea hadn’t exactly thrilled neither of his parents, and his father had explicitly prohibited such a career. So now, watching a bunch of these modern jets, the sense of admiration and wonder he feels are comparable to a country kid entering a big toy store for the first time in their life.
And really, who’s the Wakandan to judge? Tony is about to say all of this (and then some) out loud, but just a second before he does the doors open again and in comes Steve, the look of someone who just woke up from a restless sleep. Tony sinks more into his chair as seeing him, wondering who the hell thought it would be a smart idea to put the two of them in the same room together.
of times to—“
times.”
Maybe even more surprising is that Steve seems to have an answer straightaway, revealing that he himself has had the same thought at times: “I
“Are you the guy wh—“
“… Steve.” Rhodey repeats, still staring at him as if he doesn’t have any idea
“I thought you’d be happy to not have to deal with me for a while” he hears himself replying, and his sarcastic tone can only do so much right now.
Tony opens his mouth to reply – what it might come out of it he has no idea – but he’s so mesmerized by Steve’s words that no sound comes out. They stare into each other’s eyes for what it seems like an eternity, then just about when Tony is starting to formulate something resembling a coherent thought, a hooded, floating figure appears in front of their eyes, literally out of nowhere.
“He’s alright, wishing he could be doing more, y’know. Not long now though.”
He knows he should ask him what he means exactly by that, but it seems impossible for words to come out of his mouth, so he only gives a brief nod before getting inside the car, turning the engine on and driving away. A couple of minutes later, having regained some vague sense of internal quietness, he dials Steve’s number.
for two whole ass years, which means what, 2015? Early 2016? And then, all of a sudden, a flashback hits him with the energy of a lightning. A beach whose name he can’t remember right now, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. The sun on his face and the sound of the waves going back and forth, listlessly, the only reminder of time passing in a stillness that he wishes could return to him, along with the person he was sharing those moments with.
“How did you manage to get in?” he asks in reply, because forget about the kiss, he
“Funny, I was thinking exactly the same thing…” murmurs Steve in return, turning into the embrace to kiss him again, pulling his body as close as possible, sending shivers down his spine although it’s July and it’s hot as hell. Tony wants so
“Is there a problem?” Tony intercedes, trying to meet Mr. Field’s eyes, but the guy seems settled on ignoring him.
. He tries to scream away his pain but when he opens his mouth no sound is heard. That’s when he begins to cry, and cry, and cry. Until eventually there are no tears left and he gives in to his exhaustion, holding his knees to his chest.
he feels right now. The guy who was Iron Man just asked for
no, and he knows it. That’s what hurts the most.
“Hello?”
“It’s going to hurt so badly…”
“I’ll suck you off, you like that, don’t you? You want me to swallow it? Got no problem with that either, lemme do that for you…”
to me!” Steve barks at him, his voice so loud that Tony can feel a pang of pain right to his temple.
“I’m sorry, I haven’t gotten you anything, I thought…” he starts, although he doesn’t continue because what he was about to say was something along the lines of ‘we were only having sex’, which, he realizes now, was indeed an idiotic thought to have entertained. After everything they’ve gone through? How can there possibly be sex without even just a strand of feelings attached? Steve is right, he can really be dumb sometimes.
“Mr. Stark, wow, uh, I’m sorry, what happened to you?”

running around like fucking cowboys thinking they’re better than anyone else. I don’t mean to be rude, but that’s the truth.”
“Yeah, I thought so…”
“Wasp, see if you can find some other hidden spot or anything like that. We still have to look for that ring. Thor,
Tony would like to point out that he’s

“I know…” the soldier replies, his voice trembling ever slightly, but noticeable enough for him, who knows it so well, each and every fluctuation memorized in his head.
“Of course, Mr. Stark, what is it?”
“Guys, uh, I think we should go to the conference room, Tony’s got something to tell us…”
, but it’s of no use.
Steve stays silent a bit, seemingly trying to absorb this scale that he had no idea existed until a minute ago. But it must somehow make sense to him because he eventually nods, much to Tony’s relief: “So, the story... how many points was it?”
no offense but I never thought you had it in you...”
about Steve. “Anyway, this is Captain Steve Rogers, everyone. Captain, these here are Bruce, Janet and Hank. They’re gonna be your teammates, if you agree to come on board.”
There’s that word again. It drives him

at a restaurant of his choice – which, unsurprisingly, it’s a more refined version of a traditional diner, although he suspects that’s mostly out of respect for his rather sophisticated standards, Steve looking at it like some sort of compromise between the two of them.
, he can’t help but thinking as he takes a few steps towards the front door, almost falling over because, to put it gently, his body needs to get used to gravity all over again, something that he had completely pushed aside in his brain. It happens when you’ve been gone for a year.
And although Tony is plain confused by that answer, he does as he is told, figuring there’s no harm in following that, not when Steve is right in front of him to protect him was something to suddenly explode or a threat to fall off the sky out of nowhere.
– although for some reasons Steve seems to think otherwise.
“You gave us a real scare there, Rogers,” Tony says, but his voice doesn’t have a reproaching tone, rather it sounds like it’s infused with a badly hidden worry. Which is interesting, to say the least. He’s pretty sure he has never heard it before. “That oversized insect really wasn’t worth it.”
to stop using traceable devices altogether.
But before he can go there, Steve squeezes his hand tight and overlaps with his voice: “It doesn’t matter, because I feel the same way, and have been for quite a while now too. I can tell that you meant it, so I won’t
As he says this Tony could almost swear he can spot some kind of embarrassment going on, which quite confuses him: “What is it, a condom? Are you just remembering that now?!” he frowns, but Steve quickly (and frantically) shakes his head, and now a decisive redness is emerging on his cheeks.
“This is the real reason why you pulled out, isn’t it?” Tony whispers a few seconds later, looking at him even if he’s not returning his glaze this time. Steve nods again.
Tony makes a movement to skirt around Nat, but she must have been expecting it because she stops him right away, and before he can think of another way to circle around her, the end of the jet opens up and he catches sight of a stretcher being rushed towards the entrance. “Steve!” he yells at the top of his lungs, turning in the opposite direction to make his way back down, but once again Nat anticipates his move and delivers a precise, small blow to the back of his neck, and a second later Tony collapses into her arms.
The first thing Tony notices as opening his eyes is how
“In other words… yes.” the being replies, its tone now exasperated as if it was trying to explain a very simple concept to a particularly obtuse kid. Tony doesn’t like that. “Now, if you’ll excuse me, I have more…
“I’m actually not sure, I… kind of lost track of time, I was reading up on this… Final Host, but it doesn’t make much sense to me, seems like I’m missing something…”
As he wonders what the hell is going on between the two of them – and whether he actually wants it to
“I don’t know what you mean…”
“That makes a strong opposition if you ask me…”
with you?! You can’t possibly be
“… Sorry, what did you just say?” Steve can’t believe those words. How on Earth could Tony think that to be a good idea? He’s no expert obviously, but he’s quite positive their first attempt was a semi disaster from his part, so now the prospect of having to face not just one, but three people at once in a romantic setting, albeit fake, is nothing short of terrifying.
with his present, he can well see that he’s now resenting the level of obsession with it.
“Tony!”
he’s travelling at Speedlight. There is only one small flaw to his plan: because he’s now officially off the grid, he has no way of testing it without the government knowing about it. He’s about 99.9% sure that all of his calculations are correct, and still weirder things have happened in recent years, so he wouldn’t be too surprised if something was wrong. But if you thought that would stop him from going, you’d be sorely mistaken. He
Steve feels incredibly stupid, standing there in the living room and dancing with Tony to a tune from fifty years ago, but damn if it doesn’t feel good. Tony nods at him and goes so down on his knees that he can feel his back complaining, but he doesn’t care as long as it makes his companion smile. When the song finishes, he points his finger at him and grins: “Don’t tell me that wasn’t fun.”
Steve looks at him now, not sure whether his question is serious or he’s just about to make a fool of himself once again – with Tony is always a very close call. He stays silent a while, but eventually spells it out, because he just can’t come up with an alternative line.
The other man gives him a nod – maybe to apologize that it had to come to this, maybe to tell him that he understands his struggle, you can never know for sure what’s in his thoughts – and then starts explaining the plan, which he has codenamed ‘TJ’ (Trojan Horse); it’s painfully simple and that’s its best quality, as the most effective strategies are; plus, it doesn’t involve a lot of people, which cuts down the possibilities of leaks and moles to almost zero.
, he can picture him saying.
Sitting in one of the conference rooms of his hotel a day later, waiting for Fury (and hopefully Steve) to show up, Tony’s mind is a clusterfuck of thoughts and feelings and words as he nervously taps his fingers on the big table, checking his watch every other minute, wondering if they are actually going to make it or if something will happen at the very last moment and all of this will have been for nothing. Plus, he’s growing extremely queasy at the thought of meeting Steve for the first time in almost five months, not having had any form of communication with him, not knowing if he’s okay or what he’s been up to and if that involved fighting or just laying low. What if he’s got hurt, lost an arm or something? What if he can’t make it because he’s in a hospital bed? He doesn’t think he could be dead – Fury would have told him somehow, right? Or maybe he wouldn’t, thinking that he might pull out of the mission if he knew Steve had died…
Steve and he officially started dating, a detail made clear by their overprotective, vigilant and possessive stances, always alert, afraid that a sudden, out-of-nowhere danger might pop up at any given second to rob them from this unexpected – albeit much wished for – happiness that is nothing more than everyone else’s normality. As if following their own thought, his eyes end up stopping on a particular picture, the same one Tony was so hard trying to ignore: their wedding day, a few years back. In it, they’re standing in front of the officiant and facing each other, hopelessly stargazing into their respective eyes, hands together as hearing the words bound to change their lives forever. Steve is dressed up in blue and Tony in red, and although you could never tell by the picture, Steve hadn’t liked this idea at all for the longest time, but if you were to ask him right in that moment, he would have said that Tony looked
But before he can finish his sentence, Tony does the only thing that could get Steve to come around, or at least so he hopes, because he
“So… What is this, exactly? Military outpost?”
For the second time tonight, he catches his partner’s face becoming slightly flustered; it would be kind of adorable if it wasn’t also so painful to witness.
Then takes aim and shoot.
“You… don’t need to do that,” Steve explains, an awkward smile on his lips now, because he really hates it when people do it with him, it makes him… uncomfortable, as being called ‘captain’ does. Sixteen-year old him would have loved it, but sixteen-year old him was idealistic and stupid and believed in the army. It had been his dream since his mother had died, two years earlier, maybe because he felt he could actually make a difference, or at least
Rhodey nods and doesn’t ask why he did it or what’s their content, and Tony is glad he doesn’t. He’s military after all, he knows how these things go.
!” the stranger moans as he starts stroking his own dick, but Steve’s eyes open at the sound of his own name being called out like this and for a moment he completely freezes in his position. Mark doesn’t seem to notice – if he does, he gives no sign of it – and Steve obeys to his request, but his mind has now taken control again, demanding attention. His name on the guy’s lips sounded weird, misplaced.
“Why not you?”
, and couldn’t imagine him wearing anything else. Now, Tony can feel his eyes welling up at the memory, so he forces himself to look away before speaking again.
. Maybe we should just wait.”
, upon which respecting social rules was definitely in the top three in that list. And still, this one –
Those days are long gone now, and more than a memory they actually feel like something that happened in a recurrent dream ages ago, similar enough to reality to
“Tony, wake up.”
“Ahah, very funny. Seriously though, we can’t have humans flying around the galaxy, littering it, getting into fights and so on. Rumors spread quickly here. You’ve had your fun, it’s time to head back. I bet you’re missing American food. I know I
Even before he enters the dance hall, Tony instinctively
Steve looks at him, eyes so watery that it’s like staring into the deep blue ocean; Tony wants to fight it, to insult him maybe, anything to make Steve forget about him, or even just put him away in a box on top of the wardrobe: you know it’s there, but as time goes by you simply stop thinking about it. And still, he doesn’t do any of this, because the truth is, he’d be lying if he said he believed it possible. He himself is dead, and all he can do is lying down next to Steve as often as possible, trying to cling on whatever fragment of his human nature is still present in him.
“You good?” Steve asks him once he gets close, and again as some sort of automatic reflex Tony finds himself sliding a hand on the other’s arm, although the suit makes it so awkward that he drops it in a matter of seconds.
“Earth called, they want their Avenger back.” Quill greets him, going straight to the point, looking at him as if he had just caught him red-handed.
Yes, Tony knows, and wants to say that it is impossible to forget that when he has a perfect example of it right in front of his own eyes in this moment, but decides to keep it from himself for fear of sounding shallower than he intends to. Steve is handsome, of course, but that’s not what he’s thinking about. His
Tony smirks, and even before he answers, Steve knows his sense of victory had been hugely misplaced.
“Huh? What are you talking about?”
“So what am I supposed to do? I thought you were pretending to be my date…”
“You know… New Hampshire is a long way drive…” he murmurs, trying to sound flirty but quite failing at it.
“Well, you should have been the one
it a second time is just too much to handle, especially when you’ve been deprived of the one person who always seemed to have an answer for anything, and even if he didn’t, he wouldn’t rest until he found one. But now Tony was gone, and he was alone again trying to make sense of everything, without any idea or hope of actually being able to.
And Tony kisses him again, for real this time. A hand closed on the collar of his suit, he pulls Steve closer and takes his lower lip between his, pulling it gently and sighing softly. When he talks, his voice is sweet and calm, almost a whisper.
“Son of a bitch…” is the private’s comment, but all Tony cares about is the taller shadow pre-announcing Steve’s body getting closer again.
“Wait a second, I think I saw something!” Janet cuts Steve’s sentence short, immediately sprinting towards the wall opposite to where they’re all standing. Time that the rest can turn their heads, and she’s… gone.
As the other man helps him to come up into a sitting position, his eyes regain their ability to focus. He forces a smile out, not knowing whether or not he’ll be successful.
“Alright, that does sound like me…”
to have a reason? This is my propriety, after all.”
“Check your coat, sir?”
“The Jazz Café in the Village?”
“Ah, good luck with that, Nick. In case you didn’t notice, he’s not quite the fan of following orders nowadays…”
Tony squeezes his eyes and his hands so tight, hoping to achieve something,
“Well, you can say what you want about Tony, but I really feel he’s been giving me some solid advice.” Steve chimes in, once again coming to his rescue, causing all sets of eyes to focus back on him, Tony’s included, staring at him for a split second before adding, in what later Tony would think of as nothing short of a social suicide: “Like, did you know that you
“… I’m glad you like it. Shall we?”
. The team is already worried about him as it is – has been for over a year now, although it’s gone by in the blink of an eye, seasons changing without him realizing it, his senses and his perception of time completely dulled out by the pain,
May 21
“I thought… I thought you were in a coma or something, I…” he stops halfway, realizing just now how he had let his emotions take control of his brain. Nobody had ever told him exactly how serious Steve’s injuries were, and he didn’t stop to ask about it to anyone on his way here. The only thing he knew, matter of fact, was that the other had been hit somehow, and that had come from Nat, who might as well be the best secret agent in the world, but hardly a doctor or even a nurse.
“When did you get back?” she asks him straightaway, but before replying he pulls her in a long, tight hug, which she happily returns, although a bit puzzled.
, he thinks, his eyes already surveying the room to spot the long counter, and it’s right in this moment that they land on another person who, just like him, looks a little out of place, indecisive whether remaining and taking the chance – of a dance, an encounter, a kiss – or going and calling it a night. The guy is quite scrawny and skinny, it doesn’t feel like he
This is the worst form of hell.
“I’m not sure…”
Of course.
“Don’t be absurd, I just told FRIDAY to notify me whenever he’s in range…” he claims, and it’s only once the words leave his mouth that he realizes just how
His head literally buried deep down the hollow cavity of the suit he’s been trying to repair for the last couple of hours or so, every bit of his attention devoted to it, Tony doesn’t hear Steve as he makes his way into his lab, although it takes him only a few seconds to notice the intrusion and knowing at once it’s him, even before the super soldier can open his mouth.
Steve nods – mostly as a vote of self-confidence, hoping for the best – and takes a slow sip from his beer to take some time, thinking, before eventually shaking his head in defeat.
of options out there, so he’d taken a napkin, asked for a pen, and began listing the various options. He had gotten so absorbed by the whole thing that it was only once the waitress had asked him if he was done with his job today that his eyes almost casually fell on the clock wall, and he had discovered that he only had five minutes to go back to work before the bank opened again.
The A.I. follows the command, and notes from a piano begin playing in the room.
The house is surprisingly full with furniture and decorated in a typical country style that Tony finds a bit oppressing and claustrophobic to be bluntly honest, especially if he compares it to what his eyes have seen recently. It all seems so
“Okay, let me get this straight, you got me a… present – let’s call it that, shall we?, – and now you’re gonna give it to me – possibly, if you stop rambling. So, if that’s the case, I don’t understand, what’s the big deal?”
Although caught by surprise, Steve smiles on his lips and returns the welcome outburst of affection, but stops shortly after to catch Tony’s eyes, whispering gently: “Hey, what’s going on?”
, but overall I do feel I have a responsibility towards people to protect the planet, and I just think… I just think it’s an unfair situation, to both of us. To me, because it’s not my fault I feel this way, and although I
“It’s not here.’
“Now you just have to trap the piece of sushi in the middle, like this…” he says, and without thinking it over he demonstrates it, picking up the hosomaki and taking it to Steve’s mouth, watching the other as he parts his lips to let the food inside.
“Let’s go sit down, c’mon.” he replies, pecking his lips again before eventually taking the beer off his hand, unscrewing the cap and taking a long sip as heading towards the living room. They take their seats on the couch next to each other and without further ado he summarizes Nick’s plan to Steve, painfully watching his expression changing from interested to confused to plain hurt by the end of his recap, and again Tony has to fight against the urge to say,
Tony blinks with surprise and just stares at the face on the screen. He’s totally sure he hasn’t mentioned it to
his A.I. works – he sleeps throughout the whole weekend, and when Monday comes around, he feels ready for the start of Operation: TJ. He showers, shaves, wears the suit he just bought the previous week (an Armani three-piece marketed at $10,000) and steps out in the early August light, heading towards Washington.

“I’ll call you tomorrow, okay? After I’m done with Fury. We’ll come up with something.”
. Let’s face it, you’re not that great at feelings, but damn, if there’s something you
. They can have silences, it’s not awkward or a sign that things aren’t going well. If anything, it’s comforting. Here they are, on a fake date, laughing and talking and having a good time as if they were two regular friends living a regular life – something that Steve really misses at times, although he never says it out loud, not just because he doesn’t want people to take it as a weakness, but especially because it would scare him to have it in the open, a secret fantasy that cannot be transformed in reality.
his area of expertise, see just how many of his most notable ideas turned out in global catastrophes merely because he hadn’t weighted in common sense factors.
, he thinks, a chill of fear running down his spine.
Tony smiles and stretches his hand towards the other man, who nervously bites his lip and stays there, indecisive about what to do.
. But Steve is Steve, and he doesn’t back down.
“To my knowledge, this is all. Bear in mind though, I’m new to this myself. Fury sought me out – summoned me, actually – just ten days ago. To tell you the truth, I haven’t even had the time to try and make some sense out of it.”
Steve is aware of it too, although probably not on a conscious level. Was he to not say anything – and at this point he feels it’s really up to him, because the other seems to have lost himself behind some thought – the silence could go on and on god knows until when, never becoming an issue. Which, of course, is part of the problem itself. So he resolves to open his mouth again, but before he can, the waiter comes to their aid, bringing their food over. Tony lets a brief sigh of relief go as his eyes switch on to his hot dish.
Steve thinks it over just a few seconds – he doesn’t even need that time, his mind is already made – and then shakes his head: “If it’s all okay with you, Nick, I’d like to sit this one out.” Fury doesn’t have to say anything, a glance is all it takes. “I want to be here when Anthony wakes up. He’s gonna need all the support that he can get, and well, I believe I can provide just that. Hank can lead the team, but we’ve been getting better at anticipating each other’s moves so I doubt they’ll need a guide anyway.”
he thinks to himself as sitting down on the cushioned pillows. But when the whole of ten minutes go by, he starts wondering whether the other has got cold feet, or just plain forgot about this (although he can’t bring himself to actually
“Jarvis? Activate the medical bay, pronto. And call in Dr. Brent, there’s been some sort of emergency and I’m not taking risks,” he commands his A.I., and has been walking so fast that by the time his last word leaves his mouth he’s already on his way to the rooftop. Five minutes later, the jet lands tentatively on the tarmac, and it just takes Tony the briefest of glances to detect that whatever or whoever hit it did a significant damage to the vehicle. But he couldn’t care less about that right now, not when he doesn’t have a status on his teammates, so he runs towards the plane, not even waiting for it to come to a full stop, and starts shouting at it, as if his voice could be heard from within the vehicle. Just a few seconds later, the door opens and he sprints inside, but before he can climb more than a couple of steps Nat rushes out to stop him, placing a firm hand over his chest and searching for his eyes.

He stops, eventually. Short of breath, he looks up to the sky and screams out all of his pain before collapsing on his knees and taking his head into the palm of his hands.
“No, I… I didn’t know anything about it, I’d have been there if I had…”
the ones smaller than him. Plus, he figured if he kept him well fed
Rhodey’s voice catches him a bit by surprise as he’s busy packing up his room, mostly because he had lost himself into not so distant memories that felt to be coming from a lifetime ago. But he’s decided to ignore his feelings and power through what needs to be done, as he knows he wouldn’t be able to finish it on time were he to stop and take a moment every time an item reminds him of something.
“Why, you’re having second thoughts?”
“Well… yes. Why didn’t you say anything?”
want to help
you. We are gonna get the rings, I swear. But the right way.”
But before he can finish his thought, he sees Steve bending forward with the upper part of his body, and again everything seems to be happening so
“Thr—“
“Anyway, to answer your question, he’s been known for fifteen years
Here he is now, wearing the same clothes that have been on him for the last sixteen hours, although judging by the way they fall on him – so perfectly fitting, with very few visible wrinkles – you would never guess that. His hair, slightly long and slightly messy, gives him that extra detail on a look that speaks only about half of his personality – the super smart one – leaving the part about him being a very successful Latin lover out of the picture, because that is a luxury that belongs back to a world where the brutality and craziness of Nazism didn’t exist. In the frantic days that followed the beginning of the conflict in Europe, while everyone else was eagerly trying to ignore it, he had immediately started observing it as attentively as possible, knowing all too well that it would only be a matter of time until it expanded to the rest of the world. So when Pearl Harbor happened, Tony was ready with a strategy (and equipment) for when the US would join in. Which, of course, they did in a matter of time.
the Second World War was over – stealing them for the Germans would be my educated guess – and he hid them in a secret location nobody knew about in his own house. The guy is long dead – the world is probably a better place because of it – and we aren’t cops, which brings the question up again: why are we here?”
“I’ve already contacted the best defense lawyer in the US, he’s studying the case as we speak. You won’t be charged. It’s gonna be a tough and maybe lengthy process, but you’re not going to be in jail for any of it. And eventually, you’ll win.”
“Duh, yeah, great deductive powers, Cap, where did you notice it from? Was it the name, or the decor, or the ginger smell...” he replies, sarcastically, not quite sure where the other is going with this, lifting up a hand as spotting the two women smiling in their direction.
. We’ve found the lost automaton.”
- and still, he felt like he
again! Why do you never give me more time to get ready?”
Steve shakes his head to himself, of course, he could not outsmart Tony Stark, it was silly to even try. He follows the other out in the parking lot, wondering how to fill what is shaping to be a lot of free time.
“Ross did. It was alright at the beginning – as you said, he was more mad at you for leaving than me for coming back – but pretty soon things begun getting out of hand to the point that I felt I was actually committing treason to some extent, so I quit. I had no other choice, really. And maybe that’s what he wanted all along.”
