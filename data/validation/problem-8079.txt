Pepper cupped his cheek and Tony reluctantly met her blue-grey eyes. With a rougher voice, Pepper stated, “He will always be your friend. He is the most loyal person I have ever met…but, what you two are doing right now will not last. He’s going to stop sleeping with you but you will keep loving him and stubbornly denying it. And then, eventually, Steve will give his heart to another and you will be crushed.” She begged, “Don’t do this to yourself. You’d be happy with him. Stop pushing him away!”
Steve lightly grasped Tony’s shoulders and whispered, “Do you think you can make that?”
But even promises could not escape the pull of death.
Steve grabbed Tony and pulled him away from the bed so quickly Tony barely had time to requester it and the explosion at the same time. He pushed Tony against the wall and placed himself between Tony and whatever just exploded.
“Create a new element? Just like that? Of course, why didn’t I think of that?” Tony sarcastically stated. “Oh, I know why! Because it’ll be impossible!”
Wade sat beside her and grasped her hand, whispering, “I wish I knew…He’s gone, May…He was t-taken last n-night.” Wade’s last words shuddered and, in a smaller voice, Wade whispered, “I’m sorry…I know I’m supposed to be strong for you but…” Wade leaned into the older woman and she wrapped comforting arms around him even though he could tell she needed just as much comfort by the way her heartbeat rose. She needed to know what happened. He needed to be strong for her and Peter…so he forced himself out of her embrace and made himself sit up.
The judged banged his gavel loudly, yelling, “ORDER! ORDER IN THE COURT!”
Steve’s stomach clenched unpleasantly as he wondered the questions himself. He replied, “That can’t happen. Mary said Venom rejected me.”
Tony blasted to the motherboard and he heard the fight behind him intensify as the Soldier tried to get to him. He opened the console and tore out one of the chips and slammed the one Hill gave him in.
Longer chapter next time I promise! <3
“We’re on it,” Steve stated. He motioned for the Avengers to move out. Everyone jumped into action with the exception of Bruce who took his place by Peter. The Hulk would not be needed in such a delicate situation. He would only go if Coulson had requested him specifically.
“Codenames are different,” Clint explained. “My codename is Hawkeye and will always be Hawkeye…It’s our only connection we have to ourselves. Our everyday names may change but we will always have our codename…Did you really have another codename, Nat?”
“I am very disorientated right now, Tony,” Steve whispered. He closed his eyes for a second to try and right his spinning mind. He cautiously lifted his head and cast a wary gaze to Tony. Tony met his eyes but his gaze was hard, not revealing any inner turmoil he might be going through. Steve’s head pounded but he continued, he needed to let Tony know, “I am still uncertain about my emotions toward him but I know for a fact how I feel about you.”
company…I bet I can get his number by the end of the night.” They walked past the alcove, carrying tray laden with food and their chatter ended as they stepped out.
The rest of breakfast was quiet as usual but the atmosphere was different. She finally felt comfortable with him.
Steve sat up sharply, his heart racing.
Steve’s heart clenched as he thought of Bucky’s new life. He had tried to look for him after the helicarriers fell and he had healed from his wounds but he could not find even a clue. For all he knew, Bucky was dead.
“We’ll take it a day at a time…” Tony whispered and then gently patted Bucky’s thigh.
“You shouldn’t reveal the time travel,” Natasha stated.
not married. The stupid law was being debated in the courts at that moment but it felt like it was taking forever...Did he fix this before the marriage too?
“Do you want this just because you think you might not…” Steve couldn't finish the sentence, not wanting to even voice the horrid yet very plausible notion.
Steve stepped in first and said, “Thank you.”
The first two fetuses died in the womb, killing the mothers along with them. The third killed itself, its mother, and the entire team assigned to it upon its birth. The fourth would have been perfect but it was not born deformed, with its spine exposed. It did not survive long outside of its mother.
Steve leaned into Tony’s touch, loving the feel of his skin and its warmth, attesting to his living. He slurred, “I know…It’s fine, it will grow back.”
Steve called the team to return to the tower to hold a debriefing. He was more than happy to leave SHIELD to deal with the Fantastic Four.
Steve immediately moved into action, his shield sat on the other side of the couch. He didn’t put it back into his room after Pepper left.
Also, I am predicting two more chapters! GAH! Almost done!
For a long time, the Soldier stood there with his gun pressed to Steve’s temple. Tony did not move, fearing such a movement would provoke him into shooting.
But it’d all be a lie, something as unreal as this new future…
Tony broke their locked gazes and rubbed his forehead. He sighed, “It’s…nothing. Can…Can you help me wrap up my chest so the reactor doesn’t show? I need to get out of this tent…”
. He had a broader chest than Peter and larger muscles. Peter had felt his build whenever they embraced but now it was out on display…Peter was tempted to move his hands and explore the more intimate corners. Wade’s hands rested heavily on his waist and he looked at Peter with warm, sleepy eyes. However, when their gazes collide, something shifted in Wade’s eyes and he grinned ferally at Peter. Wade’s hands tightened on his hip and he wrapped his arms around Peter, pressing their bodies closer as they began to turn together.
,” Peter retorted and his eyes avoided the noticeable and
She smiled and whispered, “Hey, yourself. Want a ride to Tony’s place? He’s got a nice pool table in the basement.”
“No, Peter, nooo,” Tony wailed.
Tony looked at the undamaged Audi R8 by the garage exit and ripped off his armor. He’d test the disassembly system for the suit later. He needed to find out who this guy was. Why was he at his house? And how was he able to get in and out of his house so easily??
Tony parked ahead of him in a pull-off for tourists to park and take pictures of the ocean. No one was there so Tony found it to be the perfect place to confront the Enigma.
“Tony,” Steve lightly called out to him.
Peter’s trip to the lab was much shorter now that he wasn’t coming all the way from Queens but he still managed to cut it close with how late he slept in.
Peter took the shield and then held Tony’s hand to transfer the nanorobots over to him, leaving Tony in nothing but his boxers and Peter with a new backpack.
Tony swallowed this information calmly and put the reactor back in his chest. It clicked in and then he flinched. A wave of sharp, tingling flowed over the majority of his chest as a fresh dose of palladium pushed into him.
Peter made his days bearable but, sometimes, looking into the blue eyes, he had inherited from Steve, wretched his heart out of his chest all over again.
“I…I just never met another kid like me,” the boy replied and held out his arm with his sleeve drawn up to Steve, displaying the zeroed implant on his own arm.
“Then I
Peter opened his eyes and smiled weakly at him. He leaned into Wade's hold and sighed, “You saved me, my prince.”
He liked this upgrade.
Steve quickly filled out the form, leaving behind illegible writing and a sloppy signature.
Steve made some coffee then went back down to the labs.
When he recovered, he quickly pulled his hand away with a silly grin.
Tony laughed but then clutched his stomach and groaned, “Oh, God, don’t make me laugh. It hurts.”
Tony dropped his gaze with a frown and murmured, “We shouldn’t get into this. Not when we are fugitives. Not when we are on the run. There shouldn’t be any conflict between us, especially since Sam seems to be joining up with us.”
Peter looked down at the phone and wondered who he could trust in it now and who would sell the new number as soon as they got it. The list of those he could trust was sadly very short. He sent a text to Aunt May first to give her his new number. She replied back almost immediately, reassuring him that she was there for him.
“Both options are tempting…” Tony murmured. His fantasies as a child had obviously not involved the Iron Man suit but it was also his most valuable asset.
“It just sorta slipped out,” Steve garbled embarrassedly. His eyes were glued to Tony’s chest. He’d seen Tony without a shirt before but now he reached out and tentatively touched him.
But he held back.
Eddie frowned as his body pulsed with jealousy. No, Venom needed a host and the only two people it was compatible with were Peter and Eddie since they had fused their DNA with it when it was first created. The fact of the matter was, was that symbiote didn’t
Wade ripped himself off the skewers and moved toward the monster. Venom leapt at him and grabbed Wade with its razor-sharp claws and then shrieked at Wade with all its might, displaying its long teeth and hitting Wade in the face with flecks of its saliva.
“Oh crap,” Bucky hissed.
“My mind is spinning,” Peter gasped into his mouth when they broke for breath.
“Then answer this…out of everyone here, who is the Fuddy-Duddy?” Bucky asked, looking expectantly at Steve with a hint of a smile hidden behind his gaze.
He gave into his vices, he created new weapons, and went wherever Obie pointed to get him more money.
Tony walked over to the suit storage as it opened up in floor in the middle of his workshop. He looked down into the dark depths as a suit detached itself from its container and flew up to meet him.
Bucky and Natasha were locked together in a deadly embrace on the floor. Natasha had her legs wrapped around Bucky’s neck and had a white knuckle grip on a thick knife that skewered Bucky’s metal hand. Bucky had his flesh hand wrapped around her neck. They both were trying to strangle each other and were glaring at the other with a fiery hatred. Clint had wrapped his arms around Natasha’s waist and was trying to pull her off Bucky and Thor had a hand on Bucky and Natasha’s chests trying to push them apart.
,” Steve gasped, his heart beating frantically as he gently placed his hands on his boyfriend. Tony did not react to his touch or voice. No. He couldn’t – Tony couldn’t be –.
"Jacques likes him," Gabe stated to keep Howard and Peggy from bickering.
All he knew was that the Iron Man suit would be waiting for them here. From the little Tony had told him, he knew it had been sent here to conserve power, but they never discussed how to turn it back on. He always assumed Tony would be awake to do it…
(See the end of the chapter for
Peter fell back into his bed with a loud groan. It was
What did Tony do?????
“I know! I just…I just have to be careful! I cannot mess this up or he’s dead! This thing is extremely fragile! It could shatter under too much heat but if I do not use enough heat then the I won’t be able to seal the crack!”
Tony pulled the covers over both of them and said, “Ugh, waking up, gross. J, what do I have on my calendar.”
Tony spun around and broke away from his hold. He said, “Alright, looks like the Mini-Mark 14 is totaled! Hand over the controller.”
He sighed her name, “Natalia…”
Steve smiled sadly and whispered, “According to our story, I’m supposed to be the one who asks.”
“Can I make you something else? Or I can order something from the café? What can I do for you, Tony?”
They were both sitting where they fell and Dr. Calvin calmly replied, “There is no stopping Peter’s evolution.”
He walked off stage, waving to the gathered crowd and ignored the questions thrown at him.
When the doors opened, the boys shot out and, by the time Steve and Tony stepped out, the boys had already disappeared into Tony’s lab. They could hear Harry exclaim loudly and Steve knew they had reached Tony’s suit.
“What’s wr…” Tony paused with a frustrated huff and rephrased the question, “Why are you so distant right now? What’s going through your mind? Is it Bucky’s kiss? Are-Are you having second thoughts?”
Steve stepped away from the grill and looked at them anxiously. Tony’s face was hard but he looked like he was ready for a battle.
He had her waking early every morning sharing a silent breakfast, doing exercises and stretches to strengthen her body, and working her on her snipping skills throughout the day. Mostly they practiced on paper targets, deep into the woods outside of the city, but, sometimes, they were assigned living targets by the Academy and her instructor helped her in her aiming and practice with them. The assassinations were minor and nothing like what she be expected to do once she graduated from the Black Widow Program.
“I asked your dad for help,” Steve explained.
Steve was leaning back in his chair with his long legs stretched out underneath the table as he talked about an old game he and Becky used to play as kids. Suddenly, Steve felt Tony’s foot brush against his leg. He thought nothing of it, assuming he was adjusting his feet, until his foot continued to brush his leg. Steve’s eye snapped up from his food and he saw Tony leaning back in his own chair and staring at Steve smugly. Steve's story dwindled to a stop and silence stretched between them as Tony continued to caress the side of Steve’s leg with his foot.
“...”
“Good morning,” she said as she closed the door behind her. She smiled as she glanced at her watch and said, “Or should I say afternoon?”
“Tell her you never loved her.”
Bruce unsteadily stepped to the side and Tony sat up straighter to give Bruce enough room. Bruce’s feet tapped loudly on the linoleum floor as the entire courtroom watched him slip away. As Bruce walked up the main walkway, he stopped shaking but his head fell down from his melancholy. Steve looked to Tony and they locked eyes. He saw Tony was at war with himself from wanting to stay there with Steve and going to help his conflicted friend. Steve nodded him on and Tony shot to his feet with a grateful expression.
“Listen, he’s been in my care for the last two weeks and is as dangerous as a kitten,” Tony haughtily stated. “His claws only come out when threatened. But I’d like to think anyone would bite back when yourself or someone you love is in danger…Give him a chance.”
Steve did not have to explain as the others as Peter continued to scream.
Pepper smiled, seeing through his act and said, “I’ll call her right now.”
Steve fell forward and his fingers speared into the damp grass where Tony had been laying moments before. There was no sign of him.
Their future was here and neither of them were ready for it but…Steve was excited. By the way Tony was beaming in the photo, he could tell he was excited too.
–!” Bucky clutched his head and then hissed, “Do not call me that!” He held up his hands between them as if to ward off Tony and painfully gasped, “
“Woah, there. Only people on the list can enter,” the beefier of the two stated. Neither had a clipboard so whatever list they were talking about was nowhere in sight.
“We don’t even know where he is,” Bruce continued. “Stay here. Help us…Please, Steve.”
“I cannot watch this hounding any longer!” Thor growled, “I shall fly swiftly to his side and aide him!” Thor lifted his hammer and shot out of the room. The glass shattered as Thor flew through it and it went flying in all directions.
His inebriated mind did not realize what was happening until the floor was rushing to meet his face. After the impact, his mind spun and his stomach clenched.
He had helped found the organization with Peggy after the War but left after Maria became pregnant with Tony. His focus had been too cut between SHIELD, Stark Industries, and the work on Tony’s new element.
He knew Steve loved him and was already committed to him for life. But getting married meant their relationship would then be public record. There was no escaping the media backlash. Steve hated too much attention. If he had a choice, he’d want to live like an average guy and be able to go down the street without being swarmed by reporters. At the moment, the media left him alone in favor of chasing down more interesting or violent superheroes. Steve liked going to the corner bakery or the supermarket. He was enough of a regular there that the no one bothered him other than the occasional fan that bumped into him and asked for an autograph…but if they came out, Steve wouldn’t be able to do that anymore.
“I’m just going to stand extra close to you today and touch you more than usual. Nothing more, so relax.”
Many nights were also sleepless because their new son was teething and fussy and some nights Tony would be pacing the kitchen with the weeping baby and he felt on the edge of tears himself.
Tony stared blankly at the mattress while Steve undressed himself. Steve paused when he saw Tony not do the same and then immediately returned to his side.
Steve jerked in surprise and leaned back but did not try to break away from him. He looked questionably at Bucky, waiting to see what was the matter. Had the Soldier seeped through again? Or was there something important he needed to say?
Steve wordlessly pulled Tony in the direction of their bedroom and Tony stumbled along.
Steve gently reached out and put a hand over Tony’s. Tony instantly relaxed into his touch. Tony whispered, “Mary hated him, she cannot have willingly stayed there.”
He slammed Steve’s head into the ground and Steve felt a surge of fear slice through his anger. Bucky’s voice was not right. It was dead, without any emotion. What was Bucky saying? Was this the Soldier?
His presence was changing the future. There was nothing he could do to stop it. So…what if something happened to the machine while he was gone?
“We’ll get used to it,” she stated with a small smile.
He only wanted to make Steve happy…how did such an innocent want come to this?
Tony did not relent and reached out to grasp the fold of Steve’s breast pocket and let his arm hang heavily off it. He murmured, “I think we should try ‘us’. We’ll go into the relationship knowing there’s an expiration date but we can still have it.” Tony ran his hand up Steve’s chest and then cupped the side of his neck. Steve did not push him away nor did he break his gaze. He stared at Tony with wide eyes and, beneath Tony’s hand, he could feel Steve’s pulse rising. Tony continued, “It’d be better than denying it, right?”
“...I knew his dad, he’d get a kick out of this,” Steve murmured. Howard would’ve probably been so proud of his son’s accomplishments.
“I am now,” Wade replied truthfully as he leaned into Peter’s hand, enjoying the feel of his warmth sinking into his skin. Peter smiled warmly at him and the butterflies in Wade’s stomach fluttered happily. He quirked his lips and added, “More than fine…”
Tony was fully jerked awake and he sat up sharply, spilling the last of his coffee on the ground. He jumped to his feet and then into his car. He tossed the empty coffee mug onto the passenger seat and sped out of there.
As the doors closed behind him, he turned back around and faced Tony. Tony stood by the table and was grinning smugly at Steve. The last thing he saw was Tony blowing him a kiss.
“Steve…” Bruce gasped, his voice and his resolve breaking. He could not argue against Steve’s rational. How could Bruce agree to let Venom stay in Peter when Steve was willing to do it?
Sighing deeply, Tony replied, “Yeah, according to Friday, he's been mostly sleeping. I don't want to wake him. I doubt he slept much last night...”
His master did not let him finish and pulled the trigger. Hot blood splashed her front and James slumped forward into her lap.
“It could work but I wouldn’t announce the engagement until the marriage itself because otherwise the public will think it’s a whirlwind of a romance,” Natasha stated. “Even if you claimed to have dated in secret, they won’t believe it with Stark’s history.”
“Oh Steve…” Tony groaned. Was he trying to find a near-dead victim to pacify Venom?
,” Wade gasped, stepping into his lab.
He pushed the thoughts aside and went to follow through on Steve’s orders. He rose above the struggling pair and flew over to the motherboard of the helicarrier. He took the chip out of a compartment on his arm and zeroed in on the chip it needed to replace.
“Oh come on!” Steve gasped, raising his hands higher. “Do I really have to start spilling secrets in front of this cock-eyed meatball to prove I’m the real Steve?!”
Hello! Another chapter as promised and I am still working on replying to comments! If I end up not replying to you I apologize! O: If I do not get to you, know I appreciate every comment! Thank you all for reading and for your kind words!
Iron Man’s eyes glowed brighter and it turned its head to the side to project the scene it had witnessed several decades in the future…
Steve peered sadly at his husband and smiled lightly. He whispered, “Yes…and you haven’t even seen the video of Peter fighting back against Venom!”
advert a national catastrophe and saved the ‘damsel’ in distress, so he has to be one of us now” Sam stated with a smirk.
Wade pulled him into a gentle embrace and whispered, “Blasphemy.”
He vividly remembered their journey to Switzerland, before he had fallen sick. They traveled along the French coast and spent one day on Italian soil before moving northward. The Commandos took that time to jump in the water one last time because they knew they were not going to see the ocean for a long time. Tony hadn’t gone in the water for obvious reasons, but Bucky
A body was falling from the now sealed portal. It took him only seconds to recognize Tony’s suit.
Bucky began tugging up his shirt and moving his hands tracing his hands over his abdominal muscles. He trailed kisses down the vein in his neck then bit into the flesh. Steve threw back his head and groaned, “Oh God, Buck—!”
Peter clenched his jaw tighter.
The confession sent a jolt of surprise through Steve and he stared down at his soulmate in shock.
He typed in a few more lines and then hit enter. He paused and watched the screen expectantly before cheering, “Eureka! I’m in!”
Peter’s mouth had fallen open into the shape of a perfect “O” and his eyes were open just as wide and sparkling with excitement. He had seen the Avengers fight on TV countless times but he had never before witnessed the feats of their power in person.
“I’ll get you that blueberry jello,” Steve promised, pulling away from him.
Peter nodded, not trusting himself to speak.
Peter was still clutching his phone in his hand when his Aunt May placed the platter of pancakes in front of him.
Tony closed his in the demonstration and Bucky did the same. Tony asked, “Anything else?”
He dropped his head and darkly wondered if Steve would even want him at his side at that point. Tony did put him there.
“Shut up, Jarvis.”
Steve woke with this knowledge, knowing a lot of time must have passed since he last saw Peter’s retreating figure, and he slowly opened his eyes, afraid of what he was going to see…
Or he could keep his hand where it was and start taking this seriously.
. He made Tony feel like he was the most important being in the universe. He was Tony's anchor. He was the best thing he'd ever had in his life because he made sure Tony was happy. And it was obvious his next goal in the helping Tony list...
Steve was 100% head over heels for the guy.
He reminded Steve, “Everything will turn out alright, Steve.”
she gasped, her voice filling with horrified realization. "He must have sent the suit to me right before the explosion..."
“Okay, settle down,” Marston said, waving for his audience to quiet. Despite his plea, it took them a few more minutes to calm down.
Wade woke from his bad dream with a sharp hiss.  His arms automatically twitched to grab a weapon but, instead, tightened around a body.
Cable returned the blank sheet to Steve and gravely stated, “It means we’re not done here yet.”
“D-Do me,” he whispered, his blush grew so large that it stretched from his cheeks and down his neck.
! Jarvis lock down the Tower and all the Avenger’s phones against searches for banana hammocks!! Pepper, where’s my luggage? Why haven’t you packed it?! I have been waiting since yesterday to see Steve!”
Once the serious business was done, Ben and Mary began to talk about his and May’s lives since Mary last saw them. Most of it revolved around Peter.
Tony snorted, “We can try but I doubt it will last long.”
In the future, after Howard had died and Tony took over his company, Tony had wanted to ask him so many things. He had wanted to better understand the man that had been his father. Especially, after his plans to shut down the weapons sector, he wanted to know how his father would’ve felt about that. Mostly though, he wanted to know if the man was ever conflicted, if he had doubts…Or if he was every inch the man the world remembered him as from his newsreels: the charismatic genius that seemed to have no doubts that could stop him.
There was a stunned silence from the Avengers and even his AI paused before replying, “Yes, yes that is exactly what seems to have happened.”
Steve was currently out and, by the early hour, Tony guessed he was on his morning run.
He stepped out and walked down the hall to Tony’s lab.
Steve chuckled and said, “You know, my boyfriend might beat yours in the cute department, especially in the mornings. He has the rosiest cheeks.”
Mary smiled, it looked wary and tired, but she smiled all the same and replied, “I can do that.”
last night. He could not believe he was holding the living, breathing child less than 24 hours later.
No, no, no, God, please. Not now. Not him!
Bruce’s words washed over him in a wave of calm. He trusted the doctor’s words. Peter was going to be alright. He looked down at his son and smiled.
Bucky clapped his shoulder one last time and they traded sad but meaningful glances. Bucky left his side and strolled over to Tony, calling out, “Hey! Gay boy! Where’s your belt?”
The headlines read: More Senators Found With Hydra Connections!
Steve nodded and cleared his throat before stating, “Well, he’ll be ecstatic to meet you.”
“You saved my life, I bet he’ll even let you keep it,” Peter replied, kissing Wade’s forehead.
“Your closet down here is still full,” Tony stated wetly and as Steve pulled back he smiled sadly at Tony.
They exited together, Steve exiting the bathroom to go to his son and Tony going to the closet. Tony slapped his ass as they parted and shot Steve an impish grin.
Tony awkwardly pulled away from Steve. Steve’s arms shot away from him. Steve rubbed the wetness out of his eyes and avoided Tony’s gaze.
“I was distracted by the gleam coming off your armor, Shell-head! Did you spend all night polishing that thing?” Peter retorted sarcastically.
“Don't stop-,” Peter breathlessly gasped into his ear. The sound went straight to Wade’s dick along with the rest of the blood in his body.
But why this act? Didn’t they originally torture him into submission?
He clutched his head with a groan and grabbed onto Rhodey to keep from falling over. Rhodey demanded, “Tony, you okay?”
Peter placed the photo back in the album and closed it.
, Peter,” his Pops stated, as Peter settled into Uncle Bucky’s hold, and Peter’s head jerked back in surprise.
Peter kicked over his nightstand and he heard Wade hiss to May, “Go to your neighbors’ and call the police!”
“You trained me,” Natasha supplied, both Steve and Clint looked sharply to Natasha. The woman with a checkered past just revealed a
No, Tony would not get any sleep that night.
Peter picked up his head and met Tony’s eyes and he reached out to Tony as he gasped in a broken voice, “
Tony rubbed his erection into Steve’s thigh and murmured, “You down for a quickie?”
“J, what happened to my tower?” Tony demanded. Outside, the neighboring skyscrapers seemed to functioning fine.
A hush fell between them and they both stared at their full cups of coffee.
She had even started a game of trying to guess his name.
Both Peter and Wade turned bright red and squawked questions about their future daughter. But Cable did not turn to them or answer their questions. He looked at Tony and Steve expectantly.
community is abuzz with the news,” Loki stated, staring at Peter with hungry eyes.
They came to a stop at the 51
Tony grinned wickedly at his hardened member and stated, "I don't think I'll need the towel for this."
They were uncovering the motherload of all coverups. The Winter Solider was only a tiny, tiny piece of the pie.
Tony’s eyes widened and, with awe layering his voice, Tony asked, “Video??”
Tony had no eyes for the damage or the mayhem it caused.
Steve nodded and gasped, “Yes!”
“Why though??”
When I tried to look up Peter Parker's birthday the best I could find was that it was in August. I choose August 20th in the end because it is Andrew Garfield's birthday so it was a win-win! :)
“Oh, stop with the scientific terminology, it hurts my mind,” Peter sarcastically said. “And hell yeah we should!”
“Are you alright?” Tony gasped.
“That is delicious,” Steve commented.
Tony gasped, “
And then it was anarchy.
He could not help but remember that he had ironically made these same steps before, when Tony had nearly died after falling out of the void in their first battle with the Chitauri nearly two decades ago. They had shared a kiss when Tony was still laying on the ground and laughed in elation when Steve helped him to his feet.
He could barely remember the last time he reacted to another like this. His college sweetheart? She broke his heart and he swore off love.
Tony passed out when the world tightened around him.
“Steve…?” Peggy murmured in confusion, looking between him and Tony with widening eyes.
He grabbed Tony and propelled them over the side of the bridge and onto the storage container being moved behind Pepper's. Tony shot from Steve's arms and ran to the edge closest to Pepper. Their container was lower than Pepper’s and Tony had to reach up to get to her. Pepper reached down to him, stretching as far as she could, not that it would make a difference. Several feet separated them.
By the time they returned to their safe house, Steve didn’t feel hungry anymore…instead his heart yearned for the man who had yet to know him in this era.
“A little busy here,” Tony grunted. A large portion of the house began to fall down the cliff.
“Is there anything else I can get you?” Steve asked with concern.
“Fury called earlier…he asked if I wanted to help out at the Veterans hospital. Apparently, they were in bad shape before the attack and now they’re overwhelmed with soldiers and civilians…not much attention is being brought to it and, well, there’s a representative from the VA coming here to help me help them…”
,” he whispered through gritted teeth. “Y-You do not need to worry.”
Steve flushed and leaned toward him as he asked, “Again?”
Natasha came back to the workshop once all of her teammates went to bed. They were all exhausted in trying to plan a way to save Steve, Tony especially so.
“Yes,” Steve hissed the word like it was poison.
Steve turned back around to his boyfriend and whispered, “But what if I have to jump in to stop her from killing him??”
Peter covered his eyes and stated, “I am going to my room.
and he just wanted to lay down and sleep the rest of the day.
“He’s wanted for numerous murders and terrorism,” Natasha said, her eyes lingering on Bucky.
Steve kissed his forehead and must’ve been reading his mind because he murmured, “Babe, have I ever told you how much I love you?”
After a while, Steve knew he was not going to be going to sleep anytime soon and Peter seemed to have fallen into a deep sleep. Steve tentatively looked up.
Iron Man leapt to his feet and hissed, “They shot Steve there too! I was convinced they had killed him! Could he survive?? Could he be healing??”
This time there was no questioning whether he’d get up or not.
Despite his words, for the rest of the day, Steve found himself wincing every time Tony did. He followed him around the Tower and helped him with whatever he could, even the minimal tasks like opening a door. It made Tony roll his eyes but he humored Steve and let him baby him.
…But the feeling did not go away and he could not deny that it was there. That familiar feeling, that attraction that he had smothered towards Bucky, was still there and it could be stronger than the one he felt for Tony…
Steve blushed deeply upon hearing the sincerity in his voice. He did not feel sexy he actually felt like a clumsy huge mass of muscles, uncoordinated with unsure hands strangling the sheets. He felt so exposed and huge without his clothes and Tony's eyes only added to his insecurities. Tony made no move to touch him. Steve squirmed and mumbled nonsense under his breath, trying to mask his uncomfortableness.
“Not since the palladium poisoning,” Potts replied. She smiled sadly at Tony and said, “I couldn’t handle the stress of being in a relationship with Iron Man…”
Tony cupped the back of his neck and smiled proudly at Peter. It was one of his “father-son moments” Peter was not allowed to spoil. Even after all the time they had spent together, there were moments his dad liked to step back and appreciate the fact that Peter was in his life. Peter rolled his eyes, embarrassed by his dad’s coddling.
Tony rolled his eyes and grumbled, “I’m not like that any more. I’ve gone and fell in love with Captain America for crying out loud!”
“He was trying swing me to safety, but I wiggled to get some shots at the baddies and threw him off balance…” Wade murmured guiltily. “We slammed into the side of a building and he got knocked out.”
Tony sighed overdramatically and said, “I guess I can forgive you. A genius like myself is used to dealing with idiots all the time…" He paused and his expression became serious as he asked, "But if Bucky shows up tomorrow and confesses his undying love for you, are you going to leave me? Because if that’s the case I do not want to become anymore emotionally invested than I already am.” Tony kept up his bravado until the last statement when his voice quavered just a bit at the end. He cleared his throat and said, “I’m a businessman. I need to know I’m making a solid investment here. I’m no longer the blasé playboy I used to be.”
Before Peter could say anything, Tony quickly stepped outside. A little glimmer of hope flickered inside him, praying Peter would call and the next time they saw each other, his eyes wouldn't be filled with hate. It was a ginormous wish and Tony felt stupid for thinking it. The situation couldn't be worse.
Eddie snorted and murmured, “You are such a dweeb.”
“The DNA is evidence enough,” Steve stated morosely. He leaned into Tony and lay his head on his shoulder. He closed his eyes and tried to get the good feeling back.
When he was a kid, the idea that man could go to the moon had been ludicrous and further than that? Science Fiction.
“I am your soulmate, Tony,” Steve assured the boy. He jokingly added, “Tell your dad I’m just big for my age and I’m always here because I go to bed extra early!”
“We’re not going to hold them off for long,” she hissed.
By the week’s end, Peter had gained a godfather in Ben and a middle name: Peter Benjamin Parker.
There were only two and each had been taken with large groups so Steve’s figure was small and his eyes were hidden behind his cowl so they looked like two black pinpricks.
“Tony says they’re a block away,” Uncle Clint stated, looking up from his phone. He commented, “They must have been on the way home when Jarvis sent them the alert…”
He let Tony pull him in the direction of his bedroom by his wrist. Tony did not pause for pretty words or give him another kiss. He pushed Steve onto his bed and stared at him with hungry eyes. Steve was naked only from the waist up but he felt completely naked the way Tony was looking at him. Steve’s gut churned nervously but he licked his bottom lip in eager preparation of kissing Tony everywhere: lips, neck, torso, dick, and ass. He was going to taste him in every way possible just like he always dreamed. He just hoped he would not make a fool of himself…
At first glance, it wasn’t too impressive. They were in what looked like a normal living room. There were a few large couches, a huge, flat screen TV, and large windows that overlooked an open, manicured field with a forest of pine trees in the distance. Tony didn’t recognize any of it but it clearly was not his coastal home.
“Yes,” Natasha answered for all of them and then grabbed Thor’s bicep and dragged him away before he got any odd Asgardian ideas. She and Thor were followed by Clint, who, in turn, was followed by Bruce. Bruce shot him a reassuring smile and a thumbs up when no one was looking. Tony nodded to him gratefully.
Clint was the last to sit down, taking his usual place beside Natasha. The archer grinned at his best friend, perhaps knowing what was going on then looked to the rest of the table. Thor and Jane sat at the end, the only ones oblivious to what had happened. They had returned the night prior after the break in at the Tower.
Steve finally released his hips to cover his face with his hands upon his groan. Tony did not try to pull away like he had earlier and even started to lightly rub himself onto Steve’s shaft, slowly enough so that his friend would not notice but with enough pressure to stimulate them both.
Steve had a few stolen kisses on his USO tour in the 40s but he’d never kissed a man or felt his heart soar in such a way when Tony kissed him.
This was worse than when he had toured with the USO. He would perform, do a meet-and-greet with fans that lasted an hour and be done. They had been at the fundraiser two hours and it didn’t look like it would be ending anytime soon. It was a game of conversation that he was not used to. People were trying to weed them for information or create a scandal and it was exhausting keeping up or deflecting.
Tony grasped Steve’s shirt and murmured, “I am only human and even I make mistakes…but I don’t want tonight to be one of them. Let’s stop arguing about this. Steve… I just want you and me –
“I will protect him,” Bucky grunted with a frown. He stabbed his glare into the ground as everyone looked at him. He stated, “I have never failed a mission and Steve…your father, is mine now.”
A small smile graced his face and replied, “
Peter felt ill at the thought. Would Tony Stark release this? Even with the negative reaction he got from Peter?
– shuddered on the ground.
Natasha nodded and she ran down the alley and Clint went down the block.
have I been gone? I’m so sorry to have left you! Please, forgive me! God, look at you! I can’t believe I wasn’t there!
Heimdall nodded to his prince and said, “You fought well, sire.”
Peter slowly opened his eyes, his eyelashes brushing against Wade’s skin as he did. As he looked and listened to Wade he felt his heart swell. There was absolutely no doubt at that point…Peter was
Peter inhaled sharply and took a step away from him, causing his fear to escalate.
“Nat? What are you..?”
“Date of the crash?”
“Let’s get some breakfast,” Steve said.
(btw let me know which you'd prefer to see first and I'll start working on that first ^_^)
“Oh, my God,” Steve gasped in a broken voice, falling to his knees.
“…Not romantically...I mean he’s my friend,” Steve stated.
And it did not go unnoticed that the same man was suddenly seen moving into Stark Tower.
Steve paused upon hearing the urgency in his voice and turned questionably to his friend. Bruce grabbed Steve’s arm and touched a rip in his bicep armor.
It was bittersweet. On the one hand, Peter had so much more freedom awarded to him without the connection. But, on the other, Tony couldn’t gush about his son and it was extremely smothering for a man who was so open about himself with everyone.
“Yeah, we’re trying to get it to work right now,” Peter sighed.
“Wait…You’re serious?” Wade gasped.
“Absurd,” Thor muttered, his frown growing deeper.
“Master Barton is following protocol and is bringing him down to the sublevels,” Jarvis replied. “The tower’s outer defense system has kept them out of the building so far.”
Steve grasped his shoulders and the tip of his nose lightly brushed Tony’s.
Bucky was being stored in a warehouse right off the Hudson in New York.
your family, Peter especially. He’d do anything to not only kill Peter but torture him along the way…”
“But…first, I want to go to Steve’s memorial.”
Steve's eyes widened and his flush returned in a rush. He shyly smiled and wound his fingers around Tony's. Steve whispered, “Tony...” He bit down on his lip and then murmured, “Thank you.”
“Foooood,” Venom growled, watching the man go with immense dissatisfaction.
“You got your perp walk, I hope you’re both happy!” Tony growled to the detectives. “Now ask your pointless questions and when we leave you better give us the courtesy of leaving out the back door or your department is going to suddenly find itself with a significant budget cut!”
He didn’t draw attention to himself and, with a sad heart, he listened to Tony sob his heart out.
Cable nodded, satisfied with his word, and turned back to the desk.
“I will,” Peter droned. “See you later.”
Steve quickly crossed the room and embraced Peter as he sunk into Wade’s arms. Peter held both men with a white-knuckled grip and gasped for breath as he fought back tears. Tony felt his own eyes burn for his son. He wanted to jump out of the bed and hold him to show him how much he loved him and how sorry he was for all of this but his stupid body was still too hurt to move.
It was absolute bliss.
Steve ran faster than he ever had in his life.
Steve groaned and murmured, “We’re going to have to buy so much baby stuff before we can go home.”
Tony picked up the sealed files and asked, “What is this? Do you expect me to do paperwork? Did you guys look at me at all? I’m dying. I’m not going to spend my last days signing the dotted line.”
He was disgusting. How could he do this to Tony? And to Bucky? He was stringing them both along and will end up hurting both of them. He thought he got a handle on his feelings and had chosen Tony…Steve rubbed the feeling of Bucky off his lips again and flushed with shame. Guilt was flooding through his system, making him feel nauseated.
Thank you all who have read this fic, from the person who just discovered it today to the ones who have been here since the beginning!
Steve’s pace quickened and he was kneeling in front of Tony before he knew it. He grasped Tony’s hands, forcing them out of the white-knuckle grip they were in. He gasped, “Tony, you should have called me! I would have come!”
But first…
That portal, however, reportedly led them straight back to the remains of Hydra and Steve’s doom was sealed. What followed was years of torture and experimentation on Steve’s mind until the man he once was, was completely destroyed…And all that was left was the Winter Soldier.
Tony instantly berated himself. Schmidt was the
Before he found Peter, his life had been bleak and filled with unfortunate circumstances. Finding his son, not only gave Steve a family but a reason to live. With Peter had come moving in with the Avengers, dating and marrying Tony, and never-ending joy and love.
Soon they’d be alone again and would continue where they left off. Steve didn’t mind waiting a little longer. After all, they were going to share a lifetime together.
“I – I’m sorry,” Tony murmured, slipping out of Bucky’s support.
He only broke his eyes from Tony’s when the detective grabbed his arm and began to pull him down the hill of rubble. Reporters swarmed in and Steve held his head high as they captured his disgrace and bombarded him with questions.
“Natalia and James were in love,” he whispered softly.
Steve ran and ran and ran. He ran past Tony’s and then he ran some more.
Steve hummed in agreement and kissed Tony deeply. They fell back onto the bed, both laughing joyfully upon landing.
Steve clutched Tony’s head with one hand and bit deeply into the other hand to muffle his moans because...Jesus...his mouth... He'd been blown before but all of those instances had been nothing -
“All this time – you said nothing – Tony could’ve been walking down the street and I could have –,” Steve aggressively replied.
Peter must have noticed his glance because he stated, “My parents are down in the lab, doing ‘secret’ birthday things.” He went inside and Wade followed. As soon as they were within the safety of the Tower, Peter’s suit melted away and churning tendrils morphed into a dark shirt.
Steve accepted the coffee with a grateful nod and asked, “So how are we going to get caught?”
“’m not hungry right now,” Peter mumbled, playing with the stray bits of his camera.
Tony had done what a normal person would do when he found out his soulmate, a man he loved more than himself, was dead. He went mad with grief.
"He'll be a great addition to the team...I can't wait to work with him," Natasha stated sincerely.
Steve pushed Tony away, shot himself back, and nearly jumped off the couch. Tony lay where Steve had pushed him with a stunned expression on his face.
“Barely,” Steve bit out.
“All the tests show that, the protoplasm, our DNA, and VENOM have all synthesized almost perfectly!” Eddie whispered, smiling giddily at the beaker containing their solution.
A blurred figure ran up to him and as soon as he heard it mumble, "Stupid punk." He know it was Buck and he grinned at him.
“Insolent dog,” the monster hissed, kicking him aside.
He mourned for his loss. His melancholy was so great that it affected the dream. The brilliant bright colors darkened in the dreamscape and he could hear the faintest of whimpers permeate the air.
He did not have to think on it long on who he was going to pick.
Tony’s body skidded several feet then came to a rolling stop. He lay there unmoving and Steve felt his entire body tremble with trepidation.
She was Steve’s age, had wispy brown hair, and wore a white lab coat like Harry had described. She was in a large lab, much like the one Bruce had, as it was built more around the biological sciences. In front of her was a black microscope and a multitude of paperwork. She peered into the scope with a frown and whatever was on the slide seemed to be troubling her.
"I need...I need to try to save her," Bucky whispered without meeting his eyes.
Steve smirked at Wade, but his eyes were drawn to Peter as his son gasped, “That was amazing!”
Wade hmmed something indiscernible and leaned into Peter, nuzzling his face against Peter’s the best he could. They stood like that until the rest of the Avengers arrived.
time traveling. So, to answer your question, no, it isn’t the last of it. Your hand will unwilling be in every paradox that was created because of this.” Tony stumbled back and Steve helped lead him back to a bench and he sat down heavily. Cable continued, “Your granddaughter will even be forced to use it to travel back to the past to chase after a Neo-Hydra agent but will not be able to stop the man from divulging the secrets of time travel to the first generation Hydra scientists…”
“Okay,” she whispered.
more insane than yesterday.”
There was another long pause as Peter spoke at length and Steve's face grew expressionless. Tony recognized that face. Steve was hiding his emotions behind a mask of his own blank face. It was worse than seeing him pale or urgent...It told Tony, Steve was trying to protect him from something painful.
“Peta!” Peter replied enthusiastically and Steve was instantly smitten. Steve smiled at his son and enclosed him in a tight hug. Peter hugged him back and giggled as he did.
After a pause, the AI replied, “He says he'd be happy to loan some.”
When Tony and Peter left, Peter with a full belly and Tony with a large mug of coffee, Steve ventured into the living room.
“Why can’t we see it now? It’s my building,” Tony whined. “Visiting hours don’t really apply to me.”
They left the command tent and, unsurprisingly, Peggy was quickly on their shadow. Bucky led them away from the main activity of the camp and found Steve a quiet stump to sit on. Bucky shooed away the soldier on watch and took his spot, scanning the perimeter.
“The one who goes by ‘Solo?’ Yes, sir.”
“I have more than enough faith that you will cause some sort of scandal or find a way to mortify Steve to death,” Pepper stated.
Bucky fired again and Natasha fell back against the wall.
Wade’s mouth twitched into a semblance of a smirk and he retorted, “It’s a lifetime prescription…”
Tony beamed and replied, “I will tell him!” He moved a piece on the board and murmured to himself, “I
He didn’t have a chance to mourn for his father because Wade’s arm snapped around him and he whispered Peter’s name in a low voice. It was with a tone he’d never before heard from the merc and it made Peter pause.
?? And you technically are not even my husband anymore!! Till death do us part! You died!! We’re going to have to get married
He could already feel the rift forming between them.
He gripped Steve’s hand tightly, letting only him know his true feelings.
big secret and appeared nonchalant as always. The 'boss' name Natasha was calling Bucky seemed to make much more sense now. A million questions stemmed from her revelation but Steve bit them back as he looked down the barrel of her gun. Natasha ignored their shocked expressions and repeated, “Put down the gun, boss.”
Steve urged Bucky to his feet and Peter’s eyes latched onto him and followed Bucky the entire time as they made their way to Steve’s floor.
He was already craving Steve’s embrace, the feel of his weight in his arms. Tony’s arms tightened around the pillow, a pale stand-in for his soulmate…
Reports had been trickling in all night. Venom was killing and…feeding.
“None too gay right now,” Steve grumbled to the man behind him. Tony was handsome and Steve probably shouldn’t have been so familiar with him as he shaved him but he didn’t flirt or ogle…much. He lived up to his promise to Bucky though. He didn’t make any passes toward Tony.
“It’s strange to imagine a future where holding your hand in public would be considered okay,” Steve whispered wistfully. “…But, I'm more than happy with this arrangement.”
In the past, the changes to the future all factored on whether Tony intervened and tried to save Steve and Bucky’s lives.
He was determined to look into what else was happening as soon as he was out from under the water. He dried off and got dressed quickly but, when he tried to turn on his computer, nothing happened.
Steve’s brows pinched together and he replied, “You’re lying.”
A mad chuckle was already tickling his throat, threatening to break free. Norman withheld it by taking another sip of his cappuccino.
Tony had heard him say it before but now it was different. Now they could have a future.
So he created an algorithm to find people’s soulmates based off the time left on their timers. Never before had anyone made a program that could connect to everyone worldwide and it was only with recent computer technologies was he able to create it. Tony made it public in the 80s, not long after the birth of the personal computer, but it didn’t make an impact until the 90s when the computers were made more consumer friendly and internet was finally making an impact on the everyday person’s life.
Tony was right. He was going to beat this.
“Oh my God, there’s going to be three of you punks now…” Bucky groaned.
“Hey, babe, what’s going on?” Steve asked, strolling into the lab. Steve’s fingers traced over Tony’s equipment, caressing it without disrupting any of the sensitive materials as he approached Tony. Steve knew enough about Tony’s projects how to touch them in the right way. Tony watched his fingers and shivered with their progress. After all of these years, even the little things Steve did made him want him more. He hoped he wasn’t going to screw this up.
Leaning into Wade, Peter started his tale about the guy who tried picking him up with the cheesiest one liners and won him over.
“Yes, sir.”
“That sounds like you are pandering to me…” Tony murmured.
“Maybe it’s his way of dealing what’s happening to him,” Steve glumly surmised. “If he dies, he knows you’ll be the one I turn to for comfort…”
Their hands scrambled as they both tried to touch each other everywhere but not let their mouths break apart. They rolled around until one of Tony’s hands shot out to the bedside table and blindly opened the drawer and reached in.
“We didn’t mean to stay out here!” Steve apologized.
Steve could not pause to answer his teammates and barely heard their questions.
He picked Peter up and his son frowned at him. Peter whined, “Poppppsss.”
“Tell her you will never see her again.”
Had Wade lied to him? Was he going to keep killing?
“Tony Stark…We’re married now,” Steve murmured, rubbing his hips into Tony’s. Tony groaned and cupped both his ass cheeks and pulled Steve in tighter.
“Y-you first,” Steve garbled as he tried to come up with an explanation. The man clearly recognized his name so it must still be synonymous with Captain America. What was he going to do??
“There’s not going to be a safe landing,” Steve replied, looking at the screen in front of him with all of the red warning indicators. “But I can force her down…”
“Could…Could we go out and purchase more?” Steve asked.
“No, Peter is at home. This is not a surprise sleepover for the boys, we’re here for another matter,” Steve replied. He closed the doors for more privacy. Norman’s gaze did not lift from his papers but Steve saw his eyes flash with an unknown emotion then sharpen with calculation.
Steve flushed and asked, “No, have the pictures been posted?”
“T-Tony?” Steve murmured uncertainly.
Thanks again for reading! I'll see y'all again for the next emotional roller coaster! >:D
“New York-Presbyterian Hospital,” Jarvis replied and the crawling of his skin turned into a full on shudder. It may have been Steve’s body he was watching but he knew it was Venom who was guiding him. He was not walking through a hospital, he was walking through hunting grounds.
Jams were already sitting on the table and Peter snatched up the marmalade and smeared it on his toast.
Bucky looked from Tony and then to Steve and then back to Tony again.
Out of nowhere, Tony and Point Break were pushed off each other by the rebound of Steve’s shield. The man himself yelled out, “Hey! That’s enough!” Steve caught his shield as he jumped into the clearing. He looked to Tony and Tony jerked his gaze away. He internally called Steve all sorts of nasty names. Steve’s mouth tightened as if he could hear Tony’s inner monologue and he turned to Point Break and diplomatically said, “I don’t know what you’re doing here...”
[Oh my Spaghetti God, YES!]
Steve clenched his jaw, refusing to reply, but, internally, his heart cried out in agreement. Ever since he and Tony realized they were soulmates, they were never far from each other’s sides. He didn’t realize how strong of a connection they had formed until they were forced apart like this. Steve missed him and craved for information about him but dared not ask the Red Skull.
Tony stared at his son’s slumped form, wishing he could better understand his son’s drive to protect. The kid practically worked himself until he was exhausted some nights. He did too much…and…and then Tony remembered the line Peter would quote with reverence.
“That might work…” Steve mumbled and jogged over to the small building.
Things are awkward at first. There was no escaping it. Tony and Bucky may have forgiven each other but the history was there between them and they had to figure out how to operate around each other again with this new baggage. But…they did it.
Steve smiled as tipped the piece of meat Tony’s way and said, “Bottom’s up!”
“Seriously, Pete, it’s all conjecture in the end. What you, me, Wade, and everyone else you love knows… that’s what matters, not what the press is gossiping about this week.”
When their lips separated, Wade licked his lips, sampling the pure shower water and Peter’s tastier saliva.
“Worse than having a son who you ignored for the last 19 years?” Tony stated with a laugh. Upon Bruce’s shocked expression, Tony said, “Did I mention he spent 14 of those 19 years an orphan?” Bruce opened and closed his mouth like a fish out of water. Tony continued, “Yeah, it’s worse than seeing Steve and I fuck.”
They collected their food onto trays with Hydra's symbol. Steve's was unmarked but Tony was delighted to pick up one with a cigar drawn in the skull's mouth and the American flag plaster over its forehead. He presented it to Steve, stating in a serious tone, "God Bless America and her soldiers."
“What else can I do?” She asked him hoarsely.
Steve pulled him up to his feet and Tony stumbled forward into him. They leaned into each other’s chests for a moment and then exchanged bashful smiles as they separated.
Steve chuckled as Tony pulled him and they wrapped their arms around each other when they reached their destination.
“It was me, not Bruce,” Steve quickly explained on behalf of their friend. “We think Venom might be able to bond with me too and he might leave Peter if I were a more willing host.”
“Good thing it’s going to work,” Tony said with a smirk.
“You get him to the time machine and tell him I want him to do a few things for me. Firstly, I want him to live. He needs to fix his reactor and live to be a really old man. Secondly, he needs to be at city hall for the first gay marriage in New York for me and congratulate those fellas because I won’t be able to.”
Tony glanced between the two and crossed his arms over his chest.
century’s past but the 20
“Why are you not naked and in my bed?”
Steve turned his head and lifted it slightly so he was looking up and in the direction of Hydra. He couldn’t see much but foliage. He yelled out, “Status report!”
Peter fell asleep in Wade’s embrace thinking that he’d be waking to Wade’s face tomorrow and all the other tomorrows to come.
Steve broke the kiss and drew Tony’s hand over his opposite shoulder and thereby drawing Tony closer to him. Tony stretched out over Steve and slowly hooked his leg around his hip. Leaving Tony straddling Steve and staring questioningly at him.
“Maybe…” Tony sighed, it sounded more like an assurance to Steve than himself.
the rest of the future!? And did I mention they’re practically naked?!”
“But I am your enemy.”
Peter woke in his lover’s arms feeling extremely rejuvenated. He didn't know what Venom had done to him but, ever since Peter started to wear him, he'd been feeling more and more tired as the days went by. With the symbiote gone, Peter felt like a whole new person.
“You could have just asked me all of this instead of barging in here and attacking us!” Stark practically yelled.
Fury sent Steve and Natasha out to retrieve him and Coulson was to wait on standby if they needed a wave of SHIELD agents.
Steve's heart knotted within itself as he braced himself for the worst. Tony was going to tell him about his new bedmate and Steve needed a brace face.
When it originally got out that Tony found his soulmate and it was a man, the media went nuts. They reported that same-sex soulmates were outnumbered 1 to every 30 heterosexual couples in the country. They were rare but not unheard of, but, it was even rarer for it to happen to one of the select few the media deemed newsworthy.
He followed the footprints, planning dark revenge on Cap’s behalf. He trailed the footprints and knew they would lead him to where Cap had passed.
Peter whooped and carefully slid off the beaker of ‘goo’ off the counter.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about!” Peter hissed, “You just found out about our backstory, don’t think you know everything! It is all much more complicated than you think!”
“Dummy, stay!” Peter commanded. The robot shook then raised its arm as high as it could. Both boys followed its hand and, as the boys were distracted, the robot blasted between them and escaped.
They’d already gone over what to expect but Steve was still blown away by the response to his appearance on stage. People screamed and cheered and when he meekly waved they only grew louder. They quieted only once he started to speak. He briefly explained how he came to New York (SHIELD was going to release a more detailed statement later that day) and thanked the city for its exuberance. He didn’t take any questions from reporters but as he left the stage they tried to get a comment. Because all of them were yelling at once, he could not understand any of them and was unable to answer.
“It’s okay,” Bucky intoned reassuringly. Tony sounded more upset than he should have for getting a little help up. Tony still wasn’t really meeting his gaze. He must have felt guilty for being a burden. He seemed like the kind of guy who wanted to stand on his own two feet by himself. Bucky smiled ironically to himself…he’s just like Steve…the little punk always tried to take care of himself whenever he got sick.
“I’ll take the laptop,” Tony offered. Sam crossed the room and handed it over with a relieved sigh. Steve went to get out of Sam’s way but Tony grasped his arm and pulled him in. they shared one more quick kiss and Tony reminded him, “I love you, Steve.”
“It is horrible,” she hissed.
“Don’t you sell them in a gift shop downstairs?”
The rest of the car ride was quiet with both of them looking out their respective windows and keeping their thoughts to themselves.
“Oh, this guy gets better and better,” Tony replied with glee. For three years, Tony had been alone in the “superhero” arena but, with the chance appearance of aliens, this eccentric “Thor” with an honest to God bright red, superman cape just stepped out of nowhere and made his day.
“But you had fun with Uncle Ben?”
“Why do you always feel the need to add that little tidbit?” Steve groaned, burying his face into Tony’s shoulder. Every time they retold the story Tony found a way to squeeze that fact in there.
Natasha copied him and began to eat one handed too and her mate smiled. It was the first time she had ever seen him do it and, it may have been small and barely noticeable, but it brought a smile to her face too.
Their lives were only just beginning and he couldn’t wait to create more memories with her.
But, even with the gunfire and his screaming, he still heard the Red Skull announce, “Furnace.”
“We all need a night off once and awhile,” Ben replied.
.” Bucky hissed the last word like it was acid burning his tongue. He sharply pulled his hands from Steve and curled his fingers into the flesh of his thighs.
Eddie’s hand shot forward and grabbed the paperclip off his notes before Peter could.
"Natasha is coming by with a schedule of events for me," Steve said, still acting like nothing was wrong...
?” Tony gasped and expanded the picture to peer at the bearded man. The video played and he watched as the man scrambled to hide the shield away. Tony continued, “And why was he here?”
Well. Wow. Steve groaning.
“I just finished the Tower,
“Master Parker?” Jarvis questioned and Peter giggled, thinking it all a name game. Natasha’s stance relaxed slightly as she looked at his son.
“No,” Steve gasped, his voice coming out as more of a pained gasp than an actual word.
“Anyhow, I thought I just revealed my deep dark secret and had freaked Steve out. He had just told the Avengers he was gay and I assumed that he assumed that I was just looking for another hook up. We were best friends and I thought I had not only destroyed any chances of a romantic relationship with him but our friendship as well…”
“Peter,” Steve whispered, drawing closer to the computer screen. It appeared to be a regular human in a black all-body suit but Steve knew it was Venom and Peter. They appeared to be working together. Venom never before moved with Peter’s grace. The symbiote had attacked like an animal and not with the graceful skill Natasha had taught his son.
Natasha smirked in response. Her throat may have been badly bruised but he only managed to draw blood once, from her arm so far, whereas he was bleeding from his nose and now his leg.
“But Peter –,” he gasped. Steve should find him and offer himself to Venom to spare Peter from his continuous suffering.
Steve’s heart began to beat even faster and the tips of his fingers dug a little deeper into Tony’s jaw. Swallowing down his nervousness, Steve stated with conviction, “You’ll escape. You will both escape and go home.”
Peter fell onto the couch next to his uncle and did an overly dramatic flop as he landed.
Peter’s face broke into a huge and happy smile. He let out an excited yip and pushed a hug upon Wade that was strong enough to knock him over. They laughed and Peter pressed smiling kisses onto Wade’s mouth, making their teeth click more than their lips meet.
The Winter Soldier was kept in one of Tony’s blast rooms. It was a small closet, originally used to store his most potent explosives. It was made of solid concrete and steel. It was made to withstand the power of a great explosion so it should be enough to hold the Soviet super solider.
The night went by too quickly after that with a lot of laughing, dancing, and more kissing between him and Tony.
“No!” Tony gasped, grabbing Thor’s arm as he lowered the hammer. “Steve is completely healed! There is nothing wrong with him other than he won’t wake up!”
Harold disappeared into the back and Peter let his eyes meander over the different cameras for sale. He quickly found himself in front of the camera bags and inspected them closely, wondering how well they’d hold together strapped onto his shoulder as he was swinging through the city.
“It’s not much to go on,” Bucky grumbled.
Behind that calm smile however, Steve saw eyes of steel and tense muscles.
,” he hissed into her mouth, using the English moniker again.
“Nice outfit.”
There was a light tap on his shoulder and Pepper whispered, “…Guys, we never really discussed coming out but I think you two just did it.”
And Peter is going to grow up, no more toddler speak or crawling from now on! :)
“I’ve come here to put an end to Loki’s schemes!” The giant yelled.
With his program, people merely had to input their times into SI Online and they’d be matched with several people with the same time. The comprehensive questionnaire they’d have filled out, when signing in, would be used to determine their best match of the listed individuals.  They then use the site to plan a meetup and meet to see if they’ll find their soulmate. Their timers would usually reset before the meeting but many went either way just to make sure. If not, they check back in with SI Online for the next match.
Steve glanced down at Tony and saw he was visibly upset.
Pepper pretty much did the same but scoured Stark Industries instead to make sure their company wasn’t infested with any Hydra agents. Rhodey did the same with the army. He started first with his own division and moved onto others.
He continued to live at the Tower but…he did not see Tony as much. The man was his best friend and Steve was eternally grateful he was in his life but…
“Nobody,” Steve replied with a shrug.
With a heavy heart, he moved on and went to the graveyard. Many new grave markers had been added in the meantime, but Steve knew exactly where to find his parents’ graves. He was happy to see them still there. He cleaned them both up the best he could, pulling away weeds and scraping off dust and moss. When he saw his apartment was gone he had developed an irrational fear that their graves would be gone too… He sat with them and caught them up with everything that had happened. From their spot on a grassy knoll, he watched the sunset and when it dipped below the horizon, he left but not before murmuring, “Goodnight, Pa…Night, Ma.”
Natasha clamped her jaw shut and her glare on Bucky went from a slight burn to a laser death rays.
Cap nodded and looked pointedly at Howard.
Iron Man broke one of the chains holding him up with a blast from his repulsor and caught Steve. He caught him with one arm and they drooped down a few feet. He replied, “Yes, it is! Now let’s get you out of that suit and Rhodey in it.”
“Tony?!”
“No, Sir, that happened and the man has already exited the property and it running south along the highway,” Jarvis replied.
He carefully put the photo back into his pocket and then opened the laptop. As soon as he clicked on the search bar, it suggested Tony’s name. Steve smiled bitterly at the screen and then selected it. He found a new video of Tony dated five years prior he’d yet to watch and put in his headphones before hitting play. He leaned onto his arm as Tony began to talk about a new missile his company had produced.
“Tony!” He called out over the coms but there was only static.
There were hundreds of questions he could have asked: This was supposedly Howard’s son, from the future, stepping out of an amazing robotic suit with untold potential.  The man was clearly placing his trust in Steve and may have revealed more about the future or Steve should have done something to confirm he was who he said he was.
“I hope you enjoyed that,” he grumbled from where he was hunched over at the sink.
“Who??” Tony demanded, his gaze was so sharp and clear that he looked almost completely sober.
“But I went all the way to space and through Dr. Strange’s portal and fought aliens and-!”
“Mmm,” Wade moaned. He reached for his lover, wanting him back in his embrace but Peter was already out of the bed. His boyfriend probably had to piss so Wade took the chance to stretch and readjust himself on the bed.
Steve stepped back and held Peter closer to his chest. The nurses and doctors came forward and started to prep him for surgery but he kept his eyes on Steve and Steve kept his eyes on him until he slowly backed out of the room and then was gone.
“Never again, Pete,” Steve promised. “Never again…”
With these dark thoughts in mind, Steve clasped his hands together, strangling his fingers, and asked Jarvis, “Can you please play the video feed here?”
“I didn’t even get it to reveal its dastardly plan,” Peter grumbled. Ultron clenched its fists and stepped away from whatever it was working on to fully turn its attention on them.
Sitwell haltingly began to review his intel. Sitting beside Natasha, Steve was able to hear him clearly but he glanced in the front to see what Tony was working on. All he saw was code on the laptop screen and he couldn’t make heads or tails of it.
“Why would they take your neighbors away like that?! They’re soulmates! The implants chose them for each other!” Steve asked in horror.
Steve’s eyes widened with surprise and he gasped, “Two years??”
In the end, the Mandarin hadn’t even been the real threat…
Tony nodded stiffly.
“B-Bucky?” Steve gasped in a fragile voice. How was he alive –
Dr. Pavlov nodded and then asked, “Can you tell me what day it is, Steve?”
And, because Steve was such a boy scout, he handed their remaining tickets to the kid behind them in line. The boy’s eyes grew large and he stuttered out an excited thank you as his tickets tripled in amount.
Bucky winced and he and Steve exchanged exasperated glances.
The judge slammed down her gavel and stated, “The prosecution is right in the defendant’s flight risk and the bail mirrors that risk. I assume it won’t be a problem seeing as how Captain Rogers is in a relationship with the richest man in the city?” Marcel pursed his lips and the judge smiled. She slammed her gavel again and stated, “Court is adjourned.”
Steve left his phone on the roof and took nothing with him for SHIELD to track. Wearing only the clothes he put on that morning, and making no attempt at disguising himself, Steve hopped on his motorcycle and went straight to the Brooklyn Bridge.
Yet Steve did not get to find out.
Pepper murmured evilly under her breath as she stepped past him. She was the one who cultivated Tony’s art collection and thought of it as her baby so she was probably pissed now, which, Tony felt was much better than being scared of Bucky. Tony smiled after her retreating form and then turned back to the assassin in his living room.
Her eyes were drawn to the sink and she murmured, “Did you do the dishes?”
It had been Tony’s favorite movie when it first came out because it had been about a ghost who would not leave his soulmate’s side until she was safe. He always compared it to their predicament. Steve nodded and murmured, “Our movie…”
“Yeah!” Peter gasped, just realizing how peculiar it might have seemed to his neighbors if they saw Captain America and Iron Man standing on his front porch. He opened his door and ushered them in, saying, “Come in! Come in!”
Wade felt…
Peter eventually fell asleep in Tony’s arms and he slowed his swaying to a stop. He was afraid to put the boy down or really move at all from his position. Peter was
“I’ll take your word on it,” Fury sighed. “Damn. First Norse Gods and now super soldiers from World War II are popping up. Who’s next? Santa Claus?”
Mary nodded curtly and held out her hand. She asked, “I assume you have a syringe or some kind of needle to draw my blood?”
Bucky nodded and confirmed, “Was…Like I said, I remember falling out of love and remember attaining an attraction for…others. I…I’m sorry about the kiss by the way…”
“I know, Tony. But you will be no use to him if you
Tony snorted, “You get off on it.”
Wade nuzzled his face into Peter’s neck and retorted, “Never.”
Century but what if his old views didn’t truly die?
Harry nodded and murmured, “It looks just like her…she has the same haircut and glasses.”
“B-Buc –,” Steve murmured, he reached out and brushed the tips of his fingers along Bucky’s arm. All emotion left Bucky’s face and he stared at Steve blankly. He clutched both sides of his head and stared starkly at Steve.
, there’s got to be more to that moment you first kissed her. Just like with me and Steve. What were you thinking? Do you remember? What if you told her? I mean –
“End hologram,” Tony groaned. They all leaned back into their seats with heavy sighs except for Steve who stood up.
Peter plucked his fingers out of his mouth and asked, “Did I make the sad go?”
Steve’s hand was still on him so Wade cocked his head to the side in question.
Silence fell between them and it became all too apparent very quickly.
“What is this?? What is going on between you two?” Clint groaned.
“Thank you,” Steve coolly stated and dropped his hand. He shifted his gaze to the side and stepped past Tony.
His spare reactor was in his chest now. Pepper must have brought it at Jarvis's suggestion. It was probably helping but the poison was still in his system.
“You,” Wade said, cupping his cheek. “I’ve bottomed before. I know what to expect.”
From across the room, Susan Tyler stared blankly at him. She stood with the prosecution and the lawyer at her side was saying something to her but she seemed to be ignoring him in favor of watching Steve.
“Thank you,” he gulped. He leaned forward and took May and Ben’s hands and repeated, “Thank you.”
“You're going to have to shave off the goatee.”
Tony reached out and grasped Steve’s cheek. Tony’s entire being wanted to comfort the super soldier upon Steve’s sad words. It wasn’t fair, to Steve especially.
He couldn’t see Wade’s face anymore because he had put his mask on.
Peter touched his chest. It felt silky soft but was so durable he couldn't even feel his heartbeat through it.
The Winter Solider saw what he was doing and pushed Steve back to give himself enough room to swing up his arm and fire at Tony. Tony made no move to dodge because he expected the bullets to bounce off his armor like the last time the Soldier had fired at his suit.
“Oh, God,” Steve moaned.
He also couldn’t imagine standing idly by as Steve’s plane plummeted from the sky.
“We did go to bed very late, after a long day,” Tony murmured, laying an arm over Steve’s waist and snuggling closer to his chest.
“I need to help!” Tony hissed and weakly batted at her hold.
Wade was the first to break the kiss and murmured into Peter’s mouth, “This is amazing…”
The area was tapped off and there were two police cruisers there already.
“Where are we going?” Steve asked, his voice bouncing with good humor.
Steve felt his face slacken with surprise. It took longer than it should have for Tony’s words to process in his head. Tony looked back up to Steve and Tony growled, “
Steve stumbled after him, his mind twirling with this new information. They originally were going to sneak in after Osborn sneaked out…but the Goblin had felt no need for deception, leaving Steve and Cable having to clean up the future in his destructive wake.
“It’s distracting to the others,” the other man deadpanned.
Tony grasped Steve's hands and stated, “I’ll show you how to properly dance, Captain.”
Howard’s hands tightened into fists and he promised himself he wouldn’t let this be it. His son would survive and
Steve snorted and Wade grinned victoriously.
Tony slumped into Steve's arms, letting him take all of his weight. He murmured into his chest, “You're too good for me…that's why I can't have you…”
After so many weeks mourning, it felt like he was in a surreal dream.
That's what he was doing.
He wanted to feel more to life than simply living. He felt his eyes heat and his lips trembled and Peter whispered, “Yes. Yes, I would like to very much…”
Steve cupped the side of his neck and his thumb gently caressed Tony’s jaw line. He earnestly whispered, “Thank you, Tony.”
“…Tonight may very well be one of the last nights we spend together,” Tony stated aloud what was on both of their minds.
“Peter is going to need you more than ever. Please, give Mary a chance.”
Love was not a strong enough word to compare to what he felt toward Steve. He was his everything…his other half, and Tony couldn’t be happier.
Tony taped a fresh ice packet on his shoulder and the cold sank into his aching joint with a welcome relief. It had hurt something fierce since he fell on the Cobra but now it was throbbing after he wildly moved around to try to catch the hippie intruder. The Shelby Cobra was still an untouched ruin since both he and the stranger fell on it, but DUM-E took the initiative to spray it twice with the fire extinguisher within the last hour, so Tony knew it was in good hands.
Tony opened one eye and peeked at the super soldier, he was blushing. Tony replied, “They even made a movie out of it.”
Tony winked at Steve then ran on stage. Steve inhaled deeply then followed him out.
Tony sighed deeply and looked down at the flashcards without really reading them.
Hulk gently released Venom and it shot away from him with a shriek.
“Not the one you’re thinking of,” Steve whispered, his flush growing deeper as he imagined the inappropriate thoughts running through his lover’s mind.
touching him like this, nonetheless Tony.
Steve inhaled deeply and Tony gripped his arm tightly. Tony whispered, “It’s going to be okay!”
“Steve, drop it. I did. She clearly does not want me, and even though I remember, she still hates me,” Bucky hissed.
Peter didn’t know Wade had started to cry until he cracked open his eyes and saw Wade’s eyes were edged with tears. He wrapped his arms around the back of Wade’s neck and whispered, “Wade…” Wade blinked open those big, beautiful, blue eyes that Peter loved so much. A tear escaped Wade’s right eye but he made no move to stop it falling down his cheek. It hurt Peter to see his boyfriend so distressed but he was like this because he almost lost Peter. Peter couldn’t imagine what’d he do if Wade’s mutation suddenly stopped working when he had a mortal wound. It’d…It’d probably destroy Peter. He shouldered so many deaths his parents, Uncle Ben, Gwen…but Wade…
“I don’t care who told you! Why the hell did you bring Loki here?! Isn’t he supposed to be locked up??” Steve growled. Peter whimpered upon his last exclamation and Steve immediately cooed to his trembling son, trying to soothe him.
Steve was the cook so he did not have to clean and was currently poolside on a lounge chair. Tony kept glancing in his direction as if he was expecting Steve to bolt.
Gabe stilled, and he pulled the stethoscope out of his ears. He stated, “I need to listen to check everything, including your heart and lungs. We need to rule out everything.”
This beaming man, with all of his attention on Tony, wasn’t the Howard Tony grew up with…
It took a lot of cajoling on Steve’s part to get him to move from the spot he was standing but eventually he convinced Tony to take Peter to his bedroom. They walked with a steady, slow tread.
Tony near about came in his jeans and, in the process, freaking scarred Steve for life.
“That…That's why I'm here now. The thought of being away from you again…I…I don't want to be separated from you again so soon after…if I’m able, I'd rather be here.”
The suit’s filaments lightly hissed behind him as they powered off and he turned to his invention as he undone his last button.
He grabbed one of Peter’s hands and had him grasp his dick, together they stroked Wade’s dick and he began to move his hips. Peter hissed in surprise but he caught his breath and began to move with him.
“But we weren’t when Tyler says she was attacked…nor for the two years we claimed to be together…
“This is so cruel!” Tony hissed and then hissed again when Steve experimentally licked his nipple. Steve glanced up at him questionably and Tony growled, “It’s crueler to stop!” Steve grinned and sucked his nipple into his mouth.
Steve and Bucky had teamed up against Peter and Wade playing pool. Clint was their referee and was making bad calls on nearly all their shots. Bucky and Wade looked like they wanted to stab the archer with their pool sticks but Clint was smiling without a care. Tony and his couch buddies were placing bets on who was going to break a pool stick first. Tony bet on Bucky, the Winter Soldier’s metal grip usually tightened in his ire.
Bucky’s feet scrapped the rough concrete of the bridge as he turned and Steve lifted his gaze to him. Bucky stared at him with a frown then reached out a single hand to him.
Wade frowned and asked, “
Since then a week had passed, in which, Steve never left his son’s side. He had to fill out an abundant amount of paperwork, promise to let Bruce watch his development, and swear to check in with the SHIELD Science Division bi-monthly. It was an intrusion into his life but it was all worth it.
Ask anyone…mostly ask him. He did it. He’s amazing.
“How about getting her chocolate to couple with those flowers?” Tony suggested. Steve wrapped his arm across Tony’s back and settled his hand into place on his hip.
Steve whispered, “There is nothing to forgive. The past is in the past and right now I am just so happy you are alive! When Bucky shot you, I thought – I thought…”
Bucky ushered the Commandos together and called Dum Dum inside so he’d only have to explain this once. As he began the near incredulous tale, he couldn’t help but note the couple awkwardly pull apart. Now that death was no longer threatening to take Tony, they had to separate again. They could be friendly but nothing more. Bucky had to look elsewhere because the heartache radiating off of both men was too painful to watch.
Steve was crying but they were happy tears. Upon Tony’s declaration, the smile he was wearing grew wider and he cupped Tony’s cheek and agreed, “I am home.”
“I…I can try to fix it. I’ll – I’ll weld it!” Howard ran over to his tools.
“Reboot in progress,” Tony replied and Steve laughed, dropping their entangled hands.
is done and I can finally consentrate on this fic alone! BUT I probably won't be posting anything new until after New Years because my life will be filled with holiday nonsense! After that, I will start posting new chapters weekly!
“The proposal isn’t what is freaking me out,” Tony countered. “I am worried about what marrying me will do to Steve.”
DUM-E squealed excitedly and drove around the new piece to the lab in excited circles. Tony grinned at the robot and did not to discourage its actions.
He dialed Bruce and his friend picked up on the first ring.
Tony was able to press his hands onto the panel as several somethings crashed through his windows and exploded, filling the room with smoke.
His pops’ grip on him lessened then he drew Peter into a hug. For a moment, Peter almost pushed himself out of his pops’ hold but he stopped himself when he felt his pops’ tears.
“I was still flustered when he came to apologize so when he first said what he was sorry for I did not really hear him at first,” Steve added, grasping Tony’s hand with a grin.
He relaxed as soon as he felt the warm body at his side.
“To what do we owe this honor?” Stark asked mockingly.
“Master Parker needs to be retrieved immediately.”
All he could compute was the fact that the prosecution won the hearing.
He put a hand over Steve’s hand and explained, “It…It’s just the darkness. Whenever I’m in it…I’m just thrown back into that moment, when I first experienced it and you-you were dead or, at least, I thought you were…” Tony grasped his arms, the remnants of the darkness still making him scared of losing him.
. Steve needs you. Please, help him. Don’t let him go through what you did. Please.”
When they next returned to the dreamworld, Steve could tell by the depth to the bags under Tony’s eyes that he had pulled an all-nighter…Maybe two all-nighters…
Peter’s eyes shot open and he gasped, “
“Watching your back, you punk!” Bucky yelled somewhere behind them in the house, making Steve chuckle and finally look back to Fury. Tony too looked to the SHIELD director and was surprised to see Fury was no longer glaring at them. In fact, he could swear he was seeing a hint of a smile on the man's face.
The door had closed behind them and blue glow from Tony’s arc reactor was the only light for them to see by. It bathed Steve in its illumination and reflected brightly in Tony’s eyes. Tony’s eyes glowed like a cat’s in the dark and made Steve feel like a mouse cornered and caught in his gaze. Tony slunk over Steve with practiced grace. He sandwiched his legs around Steve’s hips and ran his rough fingers over the skin of his abdomen until his fingers caught the top of Steve’s slacks.
The last time he was awake he had given up. The last few tendrils of hope that held Peter together snapped when Venom returned to him. Venom had broken him. Peter had accepted that fact. He was not happy about it but he knew it was what he had to live with. Peter had ignored his extra sense when it screamed at him to run away and now he was to pay the price.
Tony, meanwhile, was freaking out a little.
happy before
Steve drew him off of him and met his eyes, demanding, “When, Tony? Give me that much. It is more than you did for Bucky.”
“-in remembrance of his son’s birth.”
Tony stepped behind him and out of his sight as he deliberated.
The world around him was glowing and, for a moment, his first thought was that he was dead and this was heaven. But, after blinking a few times, he realized it was one of Tony’s holograms. The entire city was laid out around him and he was laying in the projection of the Hudson River. A ferry boat floated over his knee and Steve watched it go by in confusion.
Fury strolled over to where Stark lay and bent down. He stared impassively at the expressionless, flat face shield. Fury reached down under the suit’s chin and found the release for the mask. As soon as the face plate rose, Stark snarled, “YOU are so sued and I’m going to make sure you lose your job and are arrested for home invasion, assault, and –.”
Luckily, there was another explosion and they both clutched each other to protect themselves again. Tony stopped moving and hopefully assumed Steve had commanded him to stop because of Hydra. As it was, Steve tried to keep his mind on the battle to keep his body from reacting to Tony’s anymore.
Pepper slid next to him on the couch, lightly touched his arm, finally drawing his full attention. Her eyes searched his and she whispered, “You’ve been very quiet the last few days and look…sad. What’s going on?”
“Cap!” Tony called out to him. “Over here!”
“Hello, sirs,” Happy said with an overextended bow that made Tony sigh despairingly. From what Steve understood, he was trying to get Happy to tone down his master/servant vibe with no success. Happy informed them, “We already have company outside. The media knows Mr. Stark will be arriving with a special guest.”
Tony smirked and replied over the communicator, “Just keeping an eye on my
Despite his prayers and its making its way across Steve’s limbs, the black mass did not leave Peter. It made its way over the back of his head and encroached on his face from every angle.
, the Secretary of Defense, some high school valedictorian in Ohio city, Bruce Banner, Steven Strange, just anyone who’s a threat to Hydra! Now or in the future.”
He came with a sharp gasp and it was powerful enough to make him waiver on his feet.
After he was picked up from the Tower, Steve had spent the rest of the day in debriefs learning what SHIELD knew about the Mandarin and, sadly, it was not much…But they knew the Mandarin’s operation was in the United States and, based upon increased weapons traffic, had narrowed him to being somewhere in the eastern side of the country. The President was in country’s capitol so it was a unanimous decision that he move elsewhere.
A few seconds passed and then the man opposite him rolled his eye and hung up. He explained, “Our consultant is selective on his phone calls.”
“I’m her partner! She’s calmer with me than you nitwits!” Clint retorted and disappeared.
“DO IT!” Steve yelled, his voice sounding as wretched and broken as his heart. He did not want to die. He could not ask this of his husband but –
The adolescents both crossed their arms across their chests and glowered at each other.
And then Tony actually swallowed it. Steve finally let slip, "Fuck..."
It was enough to make Steve see red.
Tony enthusiastically described all the different foods they were eating and were he got them. He was proud of the fact about knowing the best places to eat in New York. From there they dived into normal conversation and talked about Peter, the Avenger's, the silly rumors the media came up with for them, and just life in general.
Steve glanced from Peter to the other two on the couch as the conversation turned personal. He stepped out onto the balcony and his eyes trailed over the view of the city. He whispered, “It has not been a home ever since you left…I miss you, Tony. I miss us.”
Coulson, Pepper, Tony, and Steve were all gathered in one of the Tower’s conference rooms. Steve and Tony were the only two sitting and Coulson and Pepper looked like they were about to bite each other’s faces off.
Alarmed, Peter returned the hug and stated, “You are! Is this still about Venom? Your help got it off me! I barely have any marks left from the electrocution.”
Wade scrambled to his feet and stumbled toward the pink cloud. He kept his eyes locked on his boyfriend with his barely healed heart hammering so hard it was going to pop a blood vessel, and gasped, “I-Is he okay!? Did you stop it??”
“Uh huh,” Peter said, nodding as he put another Cheerio in his mouth.
“So I think I liked that,” Tony concluded.
Peter felt his emotions swell again as he looked at both of the men. Venom had tried to kill both of them and Peter had been forced to watch both men bleed for him.
Maybe if he had accepted Wade, Peter would have been more open to share his bio-shield with Tony…
“I couldn’t make your favorite,” she said apologetically. “We had no blueberries and if I tried to run to the market…”
To answer Bucky’s question, he took the phone off of mute and said, “Uhhh, Dum Dum, Steve wasn’t the only one to survive…”
“You make him run laps?” Steve guessed.
Wade clutched his head and hissed, “Shut up!”
“I saw her at Oscorp Tower,” Harry explained with a pinched brow, looking back to the photo. He studied her image for a moment and stated, “She works for my dad.”
“Who’s Wade?” Pepper asked and both Steve and Tony froze.
“Just the beginning,
Coulson looked pointedly to both of them and each avoided his gaze.
Steve trailed to a stop a few feet from his future fiancé and eyed him uneasily.
“No, dhey awe planning to bweak into da fwidge,” Peter replied.
Steve tampered off and looked at Tony, searching his gaze for his true feelings.
No one but Peter knew what happened with Gwen and he was going to keep it that way.
Pepper sighed heavily with an irritable huff and said, “Be ready in half an hour.”
Steve stared at the foldout with a bewildered expression and then asked, “Am I supposed to choose one of these women to be my ‘girlfriend?’”
She held up a small stack of papers and stated, “I want your approval for your statements to the media.”
It was probably the most Tony had laughed in a long time.
“I don’t want to hear “sir” from you either, Bucky,” Tony commanded, moving on to removing the wires and unlatching the bars keeping him upright.
He whispered, “Thank you, Tony…”
Peter got through the first five minutes before exiting the page. All the good humor he garnered from the prior video disappeared.
He remembered reaching out to “Steve” and praying to God that he’d catch his hand. He remembered praying to that same God as he fell to his “death.” He remembered blood trailing from a sump of flesh that was once his left arm. He remembered a lab. And he remembered pain.
Wade bust down his door, brandishing one of the living room’s floor lamps like a kantana. His eyes immediately focused on Peter and he stumbled back like Peter’s very presence had pushed him. He caught himself on the doorframe and gasped his name like it was his last breath, “
His father had ordered everyone out, including Steve and Bucky, leaving them alone. No one would overhear them but he still felt uneasy talking about it after being silent about it for so long… He hadn’t even talked to Steve about the finer details because even the tiniest of details could’ve changed the future.
Steve stepped close to Tony and the heat from his body warmed his back.
The same high-pitched alarm that had first incapacitated the symbiote, rang over the hospital’s speakers. Venom immediately faltered and fell. Like it had with Peter, the symbiote stayed attached to Steve but broke away from him in tendrils. Because of their connection, the alarm was more painful to Steve and he covered his ears to try to muffle the sound.
“Ew, too much info,” Peter groaned.
Logan was sitting on top of Wade’s dresser, smoking one of his trademark cigars. He held up his hand to block his view of them and grumbled, “I’ve already seen too much. Hell, I've smelt too much, so
“You’re not losing me that easily, beloved,” Tony murmured to him, knowing exactly what was running through Steve’s mind. “Especially to a guy who calls himself Doc Oct…”
Peter crooked an eyebrow at him and murmured, “What’d you do?”
And now who was left in his wake?
“Yo! Skynet! Where is Peter?” Wade asked of the AI.
With Jim, Dum Dum, and Gabe preoccupied with Tony, the remaining Commandos scouted out the area to make sure it was safe. Howard carried the tesseract while walking beside Tony. He left his people behind, wanting to limit the knowledge of the time machine to as few people as possible.
He moved slowly and his feet dragged as he left his room. He was still trying to catch his breath and his thoughts were trying to race through his murky oxygen deprived mind to find a solution.
This was the last thing he wanted.
With shaking hands, Tony unwrapped the sealed folder and looked inside. The missing pages of his father’s journal were there and a note in Peggy’s handwriting.
Steve squeezed his hand, drawing Tony’s attention away from the screens.
He scrambled out of bed and ran into his bathroom.
“Thinking?”
“The shrapnel, Sir…I do not see it on the scan.”
“I’m going to go, Dad,” Peter said with a sad smile. “Pep’s right. I gotta keep living my life. I’ll see you for lunch, ‘kay?”
“This way,” the leader stated. “The Captain should be regrouping with the rest of the Commandos in the command post.”
“Yes, Sir, and –.”
“Pops, can we get hot dogs at the pier again after the zoo?” Peter asked, drawing Steve back to their conversation.
When they entered the ballroom, people spread out in search of their graduates. Peggy’s keen eyes found him quickly and they all repeated their congratulations to the teenager. Maria showered Tony’s face with kisses and Tony begrudgingly took it with a fond smile. When Tony turned to Howard, however, that smile disappeared and he held out his hand to Howard like he was one of his subordinates and not his son.
It couldn't be possible.
“You are not going to in a long time,” Steve stated. He drew Tony’s soiled shirt over his head then tossed it on the floor. It took Tony a moment to realize what he meant.
Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair slowly and cautiously, as if he were afraid he’d break. Tony slowly wound his arms around him and then Steve lightly kissed his forehead and whispered with awe, “I’m here. I’m actually here.”
He pointed at Tony’s glowing chest and made a strangled noise.
Bucky made no move to follow them back inside so Steve turned back to him and motioned for the nurses to give them some privacy. Steve demanded, "When?"
“SHIELD keeps an eye on all its people, even the ones who retired early,” she retorted. “SHIELD has already taken over the case, but we can’t find any trace of the intruder. What about your family? Your son?”
“Oh, shut up,” Scott grumbled at the mention of “senior” but Bruce grinned.
“Hello, my Captain,” Tony purred, making Steve’s toes curl. “I haven’t scared you away yet I see.”
“That may have worked before your top dogs were on the FBI’s most wanted list yesterday -,” was all the man was able to get out before Natasha dropped kicked him. She struck him in the head and he was out before he hit the ground.
Steve spun toward to Iron Man and gasped, “Stark? W-were you made by Howard Stark?”
Harold came back after five or so minutes, holding a paper bag. He announced, “We’ve got it all. Anything else for you, sir?”
“Hello, James,” she whispered.
Steve was
. Please stop…like now.”
Steve held Tony’s gaze and slowly pulled up his shirt, flexing his muscles and rocking his hips slowly as he did. His skin prickled in the damp, cool air and his nipples hardened into perky beads. It was only when he met Tony’s eyes that he finally shivered. He dropped the shirt with a snap and bit down on his lower lip. Tony visibly gulped, drawing a smirk from Steve.
“Whoa! Whoa! Chewie, wait! I was just joking! You can’t go there!” Solo ran the distance that separated them and grabbed his arm, gasping, “They’d arrest you for trespassing or causing a disturbance to the peace or whatever they can tac on ya for going someplace where you’re not supposed ta go!”
“Outside” was a balcony that overlooked a fantastic view of the city. There was a jacuzzi tucked in one corner, a full outdoor dining set up, some lounge chairs, and a large outdoor kitchen that consisted of a barbeque, mini fridge, and counter space.
And then he wept for Bucky…he cried for his friend because Hydra had broken him just as they had done to Steve in the alternative future. They erased the man he once was with years of torture…according to the files on the Winter Soldier, it took them twenty years –
He stumbled to his feet, his footing uneven because of his broken leg and the fact that his boots were beginning to melt. He charged forward, leaning forward so momentum would lead him other than his legs. His steps were wild and he faltered several times as his leg collapsed and broke more but he did not stop until he felt cool air. It took him only a few seconds to escape but it felt like a lifetime.
For the first time in almost a decade, Tony ignored the press invites and the media clamoring for his attention. It made them more curious, but Tony did not care.
“Oh my god,” Peter gasped, taking a step back. He pointed at Tony and gasped, “You had the surgery to remove the reactor when I was a baby. And Pops –
Neither of them slept a wink last night and he knew Steve was concerned about Tony now too. Tony hadn’t even attempted to go to bed. He needed to be aware and involved in every aspect of this until that monster was gone. Only then could he relax.
Clint grinned ecstatically and ran back inside, yelling, “Hop in! Where we going?”
He broke into a dark building and an alarm immediately went off. He found the alarm box easily enough and punched it out to silence it. The authorities would be alerted but he doubted anyone would check on it anytime soon with the raging inferno several hundred yards away. It was a warehouse filled with dusty, unwanted files and items from another era. Most of this stuff probably hadn’t been used since Howard Stark was still alive.
"It might not work. If Natasha doesn't die, the soul stone might disappear," Steve whispered fearfully. "This can create a paradox,
“Ten minutes after you and Master Roger separated. Master Rogers is informed. He has been sent a link by Master Wilson.”
Next time, Chapter Six: Bail Me
Steve licked his lips and then quickly joined Tony’s side. He went to grab Tony’s hand like one would do with the waltz or any other traditional dancing but Tony shook his head.
She kicked off her heels and said, “There’s another box in the car if you’d like to grab it.”
“I didn’t realize you were so sentimental,” Steve whispered.
Tony stumbled over to the bench at the table and watched the video with rapt fascination. Steve placed himself behind Tony and wrapped his arms around him. He buried his nose in Tony’s dark hair and breathed him in. He inhaled deeply and tried to engrain his husband’s scent into his nostrils.
He took a taxi to her place and the driver kept a wary eye on him the entire time. He was barefoot and still wearing the undershirt and shorts he fell asleep in that were now covered in the dried blood of Peter’s stepfather. Clint had been with him and it was probably the archer’s universally recognizable face from being a part of the original Avengers that assisted in getting Wade his ride.
“Har har har,” Tony grumbled snatching the soap from his hand.
Tony was sitting on the couch wrapped up in Peter’s favorite quilt. He was clutching a bottle of vodka in one hand and one of Peter’s inventions in another. The invention was a simple jack-in-the-box toy but it played a tune Peter came up with on his own and instead of a Jack's head popping out it was a plushie of Hawkeye.
Steve had to make sure, “Are you sure?”
That's right, he was Tony’s man and Tony was his and his alone.
Tony’s kiss was anything but that.
The safe house was empty so they did not need to defend themselves. It was a small place with a kitchen, half the size of his bathroom in the Tower, with a tiny area connected to it designated to be the living room, a bathroom big enough to hold a miniscule toilet, sink, and thin shower, and a bedroom dominated by a full sized mattress devoid of sheets. Everything was old, falling apart, and dusty. No one had set foot into the apartment in a long time.
much. He was so happy he met and finally married the man.
“D-Dr. Banner,” Peter gasped, his face became beet red. He stepped forward and held out his hand. Bruce took it and they shook hands. Peter said, “Your work in gamma radiation research is amazing! I have read all the articles you published! My powers came about from a gamma radiated spider bite!”
“Deadpool,” was his greeting. He wasn’t “Wilson” anymore, not a good sign.
“…What does ravish mean?” Peter questioned innocently and Steve shot Tony a glare.
She kissed him fiercely and she pulled at his shirt. He did not want to let go of her but her moans of frustration finally broke through the haze of lust that was growing in him. He helped her remove his top layers. As he pulled his undershirt over his head, she ran her hands up his torso and then sat up and pressed kisses up his chest.
Tony’s grip tightened on his and Steve glanced guiltily at his boyfriend then refocused his gaze on the toddler sleeping in his arms.
“No problem, Cap,” Fury replied. “I’m sure we’ll be seeing more of each other in the future.”
“Don’t hate it till you ate it!” Tony countered and tossed him the said product.
Bucky only shrugged in answer.
Steve saw the worry in the doctor’s eyes and he asked, “What’s wrong?”
– totally would,” Tony replied smartly.
Tony stopped but kept Steve in his embrace and smiled warmly at him. Steve wrapped a single arm around his shoulders, unable to be annoyed with the man, and turned back to the others. He asked his friends, “So what have we missed?”
Howard yipped and did a little victory dance. He then sat down and opened the notebook to one of the few remaining fresh pages and began writing out the cornerstone to the new element.
Steve was looking deeply into his eyes and gently ran his thumb over his cheek. He broke the eye contact with a sigh and enfolded him to his core within his limbs. Tony nestled into his embrace and, in the warmth of Steve’s arms, felt like his heart would finally slow down.
Peter couldn’t hold back his shocked snort and tried to muffle it with his hand.
The team looked at him like he was insane but listened and back away. Tony had to be pulled back by Steve but he moved back without much fuss but never tore his gaze from Peter. Steve ordered the rest of the team away. They listened grudgingly though all of them looked like they were ready to fight Venom…to fight Peter.
Tony plunged the dry towel into the water right next to where Steve was sitting. He stirred the towel beneath the water to make sure it was totally wet and the cloth caressed the side of Steve’s hips and just ghosted over the clenching muscles of his ass.
Steve slowly moved his hand off Tony’s mouth and cupped his cheek. Tony surprisingly remained silent as he did so but watched him with stormy eyes that were weathered from misery and fear. It hurt Steve to see Tony like this.
Normans eyes snapped up and his glared at his pathetic excuse for a progeny. Harry, an average boy with none of his intellect. Peter was smart and, with time, his intelligence could have measured up to Norman’s. In that regard, he had been more of a son to Norman than his own flesh and blood. Harry would amount to nothing and Norman was reminded of this every time he looked at him and his naïve eyes.
“We’re getting there and it’s none of the press’s business what I do with my soulmate,” Tony said, avoiding Steve’s eyes. He felt uncomfortable bringing it up in front of these two. Neither of them personally discussed it. Steve had confessed to liking men when they first met but he didn’t bring it up again. Tony only knew Steve was interested because of the shy smiles or lingering looks he gave to Tony.
“Sorry, sweetie,” Peter murmured and leaned forward. His mask parted and he lightly kissed Wade. Wade was in his Deadpool suit so Peter’s kiss was on his mask and it was a handsome mask but Wade wanted to feel those lips.
“We need to get to my lab immediately!” Bruce gasped, his eyes calculating.
The safe word is canon in the comic books and should be in the MCU too!! GAH! DX
Where it went…he had no idea. The Chameleon made it specifically to help Norman with his endeavor. But with the endeavor completed what would the robot do now?
His dad murmured, “I…I think I’m fine. Ow…Maybe a little bruised.”
None of the kids in the neighborhood had ever seen Steve shed a tear about his implant…that didn’t mean he never had. When he was old enough to understand what the lack of numbers in his implant meant and what a soulmate was…he cried. He cried so badly he had an asthma attack and was bedridden for days. He had drawn the short straw in life and he let himself wallow in the unfairness for a short time.
“Amen…” Steve agreed.
Had Tony murdered the man he loved?
“You’ve got dark circles under your eyes and your shoulders are tense. What’s wrong?”
She jolted to a stop when Schmidt finally achieved his control over James.
Peter stuck his thumb in his mouth and peered at the Avengers questionably, not going to sleep like Steve had requested. Steve sighed deeply and ran his hand over Peter’s head. He murmured, “It is going to be alright, Peter.”
Peter dropped his head and murmured, “What life?”
As soon as the word got out, reporters and paparazzi descended upon the tower in a great wave of human depravity. Steve stopped taking Peter out on walks, fearing he would be recognized. It was a hard thing to do. Peter had grown used to the routine and missed the zoo especially.
“Well that ‘squirt’ is in a relationship with Wade and they are very happy together and we are not going to interrogate either of them today…right?” Steve paused in slicing the slab of turkey he’d bought at the deli and looked between Natasha and Bucky, making himself clear in who exactly he was talking to.
He helped his friend with his usual missives as leader of the Howling Commandos and worked with Peggy in Steve’s stead to figure out the best route for the Commandos to use when in Switzerland.
Steve sighed lightly and he relaxed his grip.
His mind was in a whirlwind, trying to put the pieces back together. None of it made sense. Why was Steve kissing him this morning and pushing him away right now??
“Fine…” Tony moaned dejectedly. He paused then asked, “You’re not going to drop this, are you? I’m going to have to check in on my kid, aren’t I?”
Her soulmate blinked in confusion and then nodded sternly in affirmation. He picked up his spoon and went back to eating his oatmeal, however, he was doing it one handed. His other hand remained clasped in hers on the tabletop and it didn’t seem he was planning on letting her go anytime soon.
“Have you eaten anything?” Steve asked, already knowing the answer.
Tony gasped in surprise, “Holy shit, it’s
Peter’s voice broke through all of it and the voices all shut up at once.
“Notes?” Potts murmured in question.
…Steve told her about him wanting to masturbate to the photos. That was the only way she could have known. So was Natasha being protective of her friend or…was Steve interested in making this fake relationship…real?
??? PLEASE POPS!”
Bucky shook his head and dropped it into his hands. Tony’s concern was building but, suddenly, Bucky laughed. It was clearly a pained one, but it was a laugh all the same and it shocked Tony.
Tony grasped his arm, his anger melting away some with this new information, and whispered, “Alright, then what’s upsetting you?”
“It’s not your fault,” Tony whispered to him, his thumb rubbing small circles into his back. “The Goblin took her there, he meant to hurt her, and he put her in danger. You were only trying to save her…There’s only so much we can do. We’re superheroes, Peter. We’ve saved so many lives that we have lost count. But it’s the lives that we could not save are the lives that affect us. What you experienced was worse…Gwen was not just another person to be saved. She was someone you clearly loved."
Yet, out of all these confusing memories, he remembered the Captain most clearly.
That was the first indicator to Steve that something was wrong.
Tony’s face was planted into the mattress so, when he replied, the words came out in a muffled mumble that Steve did not understand.
“Of course, Cap,” Natasha promised, lightly punching his arm. “Consider it airtight.”
At that moment, Tony reconsidered everything: he was going to tell Steve everything, save his life, he would kiss him, make love with him, and share a future with him.
He paused in his clean up and looked up to her from where he kneeled. She stared at him blankly, hiding her emotions, but James could read her. She had tells on the way she clenched her fists and held his gaze.
This…
“Remind my body that all is fine. That we are safe…and that the other half of its soul is alive and I’m sure my nightmares will go away quicker.”
“Buckkkk,” Steve groaned, blushing furiously.
Steve’s hold tightened on him just slightly and his face pinched as he reigned in a flurry of emotions. Tony easily picked out his relief and Steve bowed his head as he hoarsely whispered, “Thank you.”
Because, Steve clearly did not survive his plane crash.
Tony’s mouth slipped off him and Steve almost whimpered from the loss of that startling heat. Tony whispered, “Look at me. I need to see your face.”
“Seriously, Tony, what can I get you?” Steve demanded, wanting to help.
“You are going to be fine,” Steve whispered and Tony tried to believe his words.
“You are doing this because you wish to establish a stable relationship with Master Rogers,” Jarvis reminded him.
Tony…Tony was dead.
[He can't love you. You're just as rotted on the inside as you are on the outside] a voice sneered.
Peter glanced between the two of them then lightly asked, “What happened?”
“Uh, you too,” Rogers squeaked.
“With every passing hour, the chances of Mr. Stark remaining sober was dwindling,” the AI explained.
The last thing Tony heard was Gabe mumble, “…Gay?” as they stepped away from the tent. He would have laughed at it in any other situation. Jarvis had gone with them, leaving Tony and Steve completely alone.
Bucky stood and asked, “Is – Is there anything I can do for you, Steve?”
shirt?” Steve and Tony traded glances and Clint’s head snapped back and forth between both of them almost comically.
They stared incredulously at Norman and Norman stared back with an air of humor.
Howard and Peggy had been looking into the Project Rebirth murders for the last ten years and Howard had barely interacted with his son in those years. Holidays and summers were their time…if he wasn’t at work.
!” Tony complained.
“Y-Your honor?”
“Harry!” Tony called out to the boy as several holograms appeared in front of him. He asked, “What does she do for your father?”
There was no reply and Steve’s fear evolved into a near hysterical terror.
“Tell me, does it feel surreal? After living in the Avenger’s Tower for over a year, do you think you’ve adjusted yet?” Sophie, the TV host, asked with an excited smile.
“We – We – yeah. It’s not…I’m sorry too…” Tony looked grimly at his lap and his eye flickered with an unknown emotion. “…We certainly can have a very convincing make out session,” Tony joked. Steve chuckled nervously but then silence fell between them and Steve looked worriedly down at his lap.
smothering.”
His aunt was talking to him but he did not notice until she waved her hand in front of his face. He jerked back in surprise and focused on her patient face.
Peter didn’t see if he got back up as Venom had him hurdling out the glass door right before the security shutters sealed him in.
Peter raised his tube in acceptance of the cheers and then poured his DNA sample into the solution. Eddie did the same and they both put their tubes back on the try without looking away from their experiment.
“Could…Could I check in on Spidey later, to see how he’s doing?” Wade asked hesitantly.
Except for the feeling of the ring on his hand and the swell of love in his heart.
The memory of that happy moment, of all the happy moments with his husband and son, gave him the will to do the impossible.
“Unquantifiably,” Tony retorted.
The gun fired and tiny shards of ice and metal bounced off his cheek. After a pause, Steve cracked open his eyes.
“Oh God, baby boy,” Wade gasped. “Those noises you make, make my mind more scrambled than usual.”
They both wanted to be together they just...they just couldn’t...
Steve glanced at Bucky and saw his friend watching the both of them with interest. He looked down, his face was beet red at this point. Steve whispered, “It was nothing really, you looked up at me…but your eyelashes were in the way of your eyes and I thought…I thought your eyelashes were nice. They were so thick and I had not noticed until that point. I thought it handsome and then I realized that
Nevertheless, there was absolutely nothing Tony could do about it. He was a man out of time falling for a man fated to die soon. It was an atrocious twist of fate.
Natasha sprinted across the flat roof and peered over the edge.
Tony grasped his hand and said, “Bruce said he wanted to look over you again, once you woke up. You up for that?”
“Tony, you’re not being subtle,” Steve informed him, humor lacing his voice.
“It’s true,” Steve flushed. “I
Tony shook his head and murmured, “I know it’s not going to work, Bruce. I mean…we practiced yesterday,
He knew what the implant symbolized but thought nothing of it.
“It’s okay, dad.
As Peter’s fingers danced across Wade’s torso and he laughed with no abandon, Peter knew at that moment that he’d want to come out to the press with him. Wade did not think well of himself but Peter could see deeper.
“What else?” Steve repeated in confusion and protectively wound his arms around Tony. He was clearly more concerned by Tony’s state than Jarvis’s. Did he think this was normal?! Of course, he did. He probably assumed changing armor was another quirk of the future.
When he finished the phone call, he cradled the phone in his hands and stared at the screen. It showed his most recent calls and the lengths of the conversations. Aunt May was the latest and the unlisted contact beneath hers was Steve Rogers.
Tony stepped out of the suit and said, “Look, you’re still in your uniform so-.”
Clint leapt onto Coulson again, only this time Steve stepped away to let them have their moment.
“Your son was right,” Steve hissed and he took another step back from Tony. Tony lurched with him and felt like he was going to vomit.
Tendrils started to wrap around Steve’s limbs and Steve started pulling the substance toward his own body instead of away from the both of them. He begged, “Take me!
“Where is everyone?” He asked.
Peter instantly hid in the back of his mind and tried to ignore the cop’s cries, the feel of his body being torn by his claws and jaws, and the satisfying warmth as the man’s meat filled his gullet.
Steve traced the side of his face and whispered, “Having you here in my arms feels so precious. It still feels like just yesterday you were dead.”
Steve glanced to Bucky and saw his best friend was eyeing Tony with the same uneasiness Steve felt.
Steve sat next to him on the bench and said, "It's your turn, you know."
Peter rolled his eyes, he may as well just go along with it now, and he did like to mess with Eddie. He countered, “Please, you’re going to have to do a lot more to get into my pants.”
“At least he's keeping himself busy with non-Wade things,” Peter murmured more to himself. Steve overheard him and chuckled lightly.
Wade’s hot breath misted over Peter’s lips as he moved them. Wade turned them so he was above Peter. Peter was plaint, captivated by the way Wade was staring at him. Wade stopped moving only once he pressed Peter into the mattress and then his body lay on Peter’s, enfolding him in a cocoon of warmth.
“I feel…strange,” he finally voiced in case he passed out.
“Lead away,” Tony sighed, resting his head on Steve’s shoulder.
“Friday, connect me to Clint,” Tony bit out the command as fast as possible.
Oh yeah, like most romantic comedies, they start off hating each other. Only difference now, this wasn’t a movie. The fact that they were soulmates wasn’t going to solve the disagreements they had with each other. To top it off, when Cap realized they were mates, he looked like Tony had just stabbed a red, white, and blue puppy in front of him with a quadruple bladed swastika.
Howard shook his head and murmured, “It’s far fetched, even for you, Pegs. I have enough on my plate to worry about, nonetheless worrying over a phantom murder like you are implying.”
Steve sighed lightly and let all his weight fall into Tony.
“You want me to
Steve just knocked out an inmate, after the man had dragged him into the Tower. But this new voice was filled with so much loathing that Steve turned around with his shield raised, expecting immediate trouble.
Tony lay his head on Steve’s shoulder and murmured, “This is your hourly reminder that I love you.”
The Captain did not reply so Coulson reaffirmed, “I will go now. The psychiatrist will be with you momentarily.
What possibly could go wrong? >:D
Peter’s eyes slowly spanned from his adopted father and to the spot he knew his birthfather to be minutes earlier. His mind could not comprehend what it was looking at, at first.
Steve did not reply but wrapped his arms around Tony and pressed his face into his scalp. He darkly wondered if a broken heart sounded different than a normal one?
Next Time, Ch.5: EMP=Emotional Mayhem Prelude
Steve broke the kiss and gasped, “I know it’s not a part of our story but I
So many choices. Which should he choose to consume?
Steve inhaled sharply from his surprise but he quickly returned the kiss.
Peter slept the entire day away. He didn’t once see the sunlight. He’d escaped Venom in the early hours before sunrise and had awoken in his bed a little after sunset.
(See the end of the chapter for
Wade leaned forward and lightly kissed the side of his neck. He murmured, “I think your bedhead is now one of my kinks.”
Steve smiled gratefully at him and said, “Thank you.”
The suit opened and he jumped inside as Jarvis stated, “The agent mentioned the disbanded Nazi branch: Hydra.”
He literally almost vomited right there.
Steve rubbed his arms and whispered, “There is nothing to be sorry about. You went through an ordeal…we all did. Hell, I’m probably a little bit I’m shock too, that’s why I can’t stop touching you…I need to assure myself you’re here...”
James drank some of the water from the sink to clean out his mouth and settle his stomach. He pushed himself with a loud huff and then crossed back to where he had dropped his mug and where Natasha sat. He bent down and picked up the pieces of the mug slowly. He finally bucked up the courage and stated, “I love you, you know?”
Steve cleared his throat and said to Bucky, “So…Do I get to hear your story now?”
When Steve asked him to spend the night, Tony nearly popped a boner right there.
Kilian paused in front of Tony and Pepper. He raised his arms to either side as he victoriously stated, “No more false faces. You said you wanted the Mandarin, well you’re looking right at him. It was always me, Tony. Right from the start. I am the Mandarin!”
Steve snorted and elbowed his friend and then turned to Tony. He asked, “Where should we put all our bags?”
“Hiya kid,” Bucky murmured, eyes flickering nervously between Peter and Steve.
“What are you doing?” Steve asked. His heart was racing at a quicker pace from Tony’s sudden move. He had expected his friend to sulk.
“Another hour, if you’ll keep me,” Ben replied.
It was hard to think positively when think those very thoughts could skewer Wade again. Peter just nodded and leaned down to kiss Wade and let his mouth distract him from the monster he’d created wrapped around his body.
Tony collapsed into Steve’s arms and stared stupidly in love up at him. Steve’s annoyed expression melted off from the warmth of his loving gaze. Steve sighed and wrapped his arms around Tony. He mumbled, “Please don’t announce to the press of all people whenever we are going to have sex.”
“Yes, Tony. I am dead,” Steve whispered and his heart broke as he saw the devastating truth wash over the little boy.
Peter followed his father back to the penthouse and they had lunch with Steve. Steve was smiling proudly at both of them the entire time and Tony had to poke him a few times before he finally cut it out. With Peter’s feelings still so raw, it felt refreshing to relax with them.
Bucky helped Natasha up and, once she was standing straight, he pressed his hand onto her belly with a small but loving smile.
He grimly watched Kilian’s men add to the pyre beneath him. In no time, the flames were burning wildly with the added fuel. It was warm at first but as the fire grew and so did the heat with it.
She got to her feet, gasping in relief, “Steve!”
He kissed her gently, kneading her breasts and thumbing her nipples, and then whispered into her mouth, “I want to make love to you, Natalia.”
Steve forcibly turned Bruce around and gasped, “
When they got into the elevator, Steve whispered, “You said ‘our boys.’ You were including Wade too, weren’t you?”
, please –
Steve’s head snapped up and his fear overrode whatever fatigue or pain he was feeling. When?! How?! He gasped, “T-Tony??”
So we are taking are first steps into the drama now...I will try to get the chapters out on a regular basis but they will come out at a slower pace because of life...
Steve smirked as he thought back to the night prior. Both of them had gone a few rounds, collapsed from exhaustion, and fell asleep almost instantly.
. I’ll be in and out. I’ll be in my Spidey uniform longer to get there than being in civilian clothes.”
Peter leaned back into his seat with a friendly smile and replied, “I don’t think it will ever
Natasha led him back into the Tower and Steve frowned when he did not see Tony.
She heard him and whispered, “I’m here…”
The stranger jumped to his feet and grabbed Tony’s face shield with a metal hand and ripped it off as if it were made of paper. Tony cursed and the sound of his voice, now clear without Iron Man’s speakers and protection, sent shivers down Steve’s spine.
Bucky spared one looked to his confused friend and then ran after Steve.
“All of it,” Tony confirmed, nodding to the two holograms of the scans.
He heard his aunt bound up the stairs and then she entered his room without pausing to knock. Her face was stark white and her big blue eyes focused on him and she repeated in a whisper, “Peter…”
Bucky holstered his gun and slowly stepped off the desk. He grabbed the chair tucked into the desk and dragged it over to Steve’s bedside. He sat heavily onto the sparsely cushioned chair and glared at Steve.
kill Peter.”
He tried to take in another deep breath but became dizzied but another burst of pain.
Tony was braced up in a hospital bed and looked exhausted and weak but he was awake,
to still see them but not be within hearing distance so they could begin their planning.
“Tell her I am going to break her just like I did you.”
“Jarvis,” Steve called out to the AI. “Can you warn Bucky and Tony of what just happened?”
“A lot of people lost their lives when they looked into these eyes. From now on, when people see these eyes, I want it to be in process of saving them,” Peter stated the same argument that won over Dad. He inhaled deeply and said, “I also want these eyes to be the eyes the Goblin sees when he eventually faces me.” The Goblin had resurfaced a few years ago and was trying to get his foot into the criminal empire of New York. The beast was not as bold as he was when he first appeared. The Avengers had yet to face him but they had fought with the beast’s forces and heard its name whispered in fear.
Wade stopped and touched the spot on his cheek where he kissed him. He gasped, “Of all the lines, that one actually works?!”
“All the scans are coming back as normal,” Bruce murmured as he looked over the papers. “Other than his needle prick healing after I drew blood I would say nothing is out of the ordinary…” Bruce lowered the papers and peered speculatively at Peter. “We must have never noticed it before because the needle pricks are so small…”
