The twins were seven months old now going on eight. The both looked exactly like Steve. Sarah Marie and Morgan Pepper.
“My surprise is you in an apron?”
‘No no no. Don’t do this ..put up fight’ tony thought his eyes shut as not to look at Steve’s pink hole...clenching and up clenching as it looked for something to fill it.
“Well that explains why little Steve wanted to play.  What it doesn’t explain is why he wanted me to play with little Steve.” Tony crosses his arms across his chest before he walked over to the image projecting Steve’s vitals.
He slid down and just cuddle up to Steve. He was still so strong and *warm*. “I love you, I love you so much.”
“Come back to bed it’s cold.” Tony whined when 200lbs of super Soldier vacated his spot and left Tony shivering and grabbing all three blankets. “You are evil.”
“Come on Steve won’t want you to be like this.” Bucky sat down next to tony, he couldn’t imagine what tony was going through. Steve was his best friend and Bucky was heartbroken. Steve was Tony’s everything they had a family and a home. Now tony was lost and Bucky didn’t know how to comfort him.
“ it was my fault !! He would still be here if I had been paying attention !” Peter Shouted his cries filling the room.
Bring his legs to his chest Tony sobbed for what he had and couldn’t ever again. “It hurts.” Tony said when Jarvis asked if he was okay. Tony just shook his head as he went into full blown panic attack mode.
There were tears in his voice. He was so tired and depressed and upset. Wanting to fix this. But there wasn’t anyway to do it. “It’s not your fault. It’s the risk we took. We knew it could happen. I love you Peter. Your dad loved you. He adored you. I know he wouldn’t want you to blame yourself.”
All watched Tony make the ultimate sacrifice, with one snap of a finger everyone felt their heart beak into a thousand pieces. Rhodey was there to comfort tony but stepped aside to let Steve be there.
“Tony.... I need.. ..” Steve moaned actually moaned as he pushed Tony against the falling wall in front of not only the Avengers but a host of spectator.
“I... I don’t know. I might go visit his grave but I don’t think I wanna do anything big.”
{text from the my love <3 <3} good luck with your appointment! I love you !
*”hello Little peter....” Steve kissed Tony’s Stomach. As the crowd cheered they had been keeping it a secret. ***
“ I can could come...if you don’t want to go alone.“ Bucky hasn’t gone since they buried him. It would hit home that he was gone and Bucky couldn’t bring himself too. It would only Make it real and Bucky couldn’t face it.
“Don’t come into the kitchen! And sit your butt down!”
“ Mr. Stark. Doctor Pascal is ready to see you.” The kind nurse whose name escaped him each and every time. This is where Steve came in handy, he remembered everyone’s names
“ slow deep breaths Tony.” Rhodey spork softly God He wanted to Find Steve and Kill him for doing this to his best friend. “Look at me. You are okay, I wouldn't lie to you. “
“No! I mean yes we had sex.” Tony stammered as steve reaches for his pants and quickly Put them back on wanting to get out of this room.
“I just want him back. I still hear him. I think I’ll hear him call my name and he isn’t there.”
“I know it’s not fair. Steve didn’t know what he had. He broke your heart. Tony I am so sorry.” Rhodey said knowing not to say mean things about Steve even if Rhodey believed that Steve had permanent redwood up his ass.
1918 -2018
“Tony. I think you should take one of your pills.” Rhodey said, returning from the bathroom with The pills in his hands. “That was a bad one and you still look terrible. So here…”
Tony wrapped his arms Captain America picking him up and flying him to the Compound so that he could deal with whatever was inflicting Steve.
Warning: non-consensual on Steve’s part as he has no control over his actions
“Doll, you feel so good….so tight around me. You are so good...so good.” Tony could feel Steve's hands resting on his thighs and his cock buried deep in him. “I am close. Darling don’t stop.”
“By raping him ? Yeah he’ll thank me.”
“Please Tony .” Steve whined actually whined as he pulled at Tony’s armor. “I need...”
“It’s not!! I killed him !” Peter clung onto his mother tears falling down his face. He just wanted his father's back. To have his arms wrapped around and tell him it was okay.  To hear his loud laugh again and see him walking around the house. “It’s not fair he should be here!”
“Steve! “ Tony said as Slid down on the wall with his hand on his face as he fight back tears. He had just lost the one good thing he had on life.
“Cause I don’t want too!” Tony said throwing his hands up in the air. He didn’t like that they were ganging up on him. And the fact that he was hopeless in Love with Steve. Had been for a while now and did his best trying to hide it with snarky comments towards the man. But he was in love with him and this wasn’t how he wanted to express his love towards the man. Maybe glass a wine by the fireplace ….not in a holding cell with Horny naked Super Soldier.
“When you get back from your appointment. Besides I have a meeting to get too after my run and you have a Skye meeting with One of your investors. “ Tony pouted Which causes Steve to laugh out loud before calling him a child and that a few hours wasn’t gonna kill him.
Tony huffs an exasperated half-laugh to himself, disrupting Steve where he's pressing a line of kisses down Tony's chest as far as he can reach from his position. Steve’s still behind him, hands having taken to kneading the softness at his belly. Yeah, Tony is still on the fence about whether he likes that. At all.
Tony doesn't want anything big and blames the change of attitude on hormones. Convincing everyone else of that is practically impossible, but he's too tired to be upset about his failed attempts at deception.
Tony takes a last sip and screws the cap back on. He allows the liquid to sit on his tongue for a moment and then swallows it down, relishing in the burn and the taste until every last trace of both is gone.
Steve's jaw is set in bitter determination and his mouth twisted into a thin line. Whatever it is he's decided, it's very clearly not debatable. Something about the way his eyes look makes Tony's gut clench with the sudden urge to back off and get the fuck away from the man as far and quickly as possible.
so what guarantees it'll appear once you offer a soul in exchange?"
"You can't do what?" Tony asks out of the blue.
Steve nods, almost on command. On the other side of the table, Carol has started removing bits of armor with brute strength and others with the laser tool implemented in her suit. She works methodically, but there's a grim twist to her lips and a tick to her jaw that betrays the fact she's no more unaffected by this than any of them.
But then he gives Steve a quick once-over and cuts himself off when the old-school military getup takes him by surprise. Steve uses that opportunity to try and explain himself, or, well– explain that he doesn't have much of an explanation for any of this, either.
And with a glance at his still-flat stomach under the hospital gown and grief breaking out of him with violent sobs, he knows this much: There will be plenty more to come.
Tony’s death means being left behind. Tony’s death means nothing being left. It means nothing to fight for, nothing to hope for, nothing to wake up to after a nightmare but an even worse one. Tony being gone means Steve will be too, sooner rather than later, first in spirit and eventually in body.
and god, Steve has no idea what he could’ve possibly done to cause this. Until–
Steve could've broken free if he really wanted to, but he's aware he already caused more trouble for himself than what's warranted, given his situation and the fact that he's very much reliant on SHIELD should Tony get fed up with his presence eventually.
As it is, an ominous wind blows through the sanctum and the changing atmosphere pulls them out onto the street. Tony hands the phone to Bruce and goes to investigate. He and Steve, they've always picked the worst possible times. What’s one more missed chance?
“C’mon Tony,” he says, breath ghosting over his skin as he whispers into Tony’s ear. “Come for me, baby.”
The knowledge of what would happen should they not find common ground soon weighed heavily on their minds, but with neither of them able or willing to offer a compromise, they channeled the frustration into something else entirely. And although it belonged neither into this moment nor into this room and wouldn’t end their debate as much as it would just put off the inevitable–Tony gave in, as he so often did when it came to Steve.
At JARVIS' thorough explanation, Tony smiles, and declares his daughter will later have to show him exactly how she did it – Steve watches the endearing scene between the two from the sidelines despite himself, and quickly turns to sort their used plates into the dishwasher once he notices.
Steve knows it long before Tony’s hand stops rubbing at his arm and the deep, reddened teeth marks are fully exposed. Steve knows it long before Tony starts to shake his head, a slow loop that goes left to right and left again in a disbelieving trance. Steve knows it long before Tony’s jaw falls open and he whispers a hoarse, desperate litany of, “No, no, no, no, no,” that drills into his brain and right through every rational thought he’s ever had.
Tony's frown deepens. "When I'm 'like this'?"
Steve places himself there in the middle of the room, stretching out his arms in invitation. He looks so full of hopeful anticipation that Tony feels almost bad saying, "You're weird today."
Yeah, most of what he's doing these days isn't considered physical exercise in the traditional sense.
Distantly, it occurs to him that as much as he once thought booze was a mandatory ingredient for a good time, it now only takes Steve to make him feel like he’s floating, perfectly out of his mind. Tony feels a touch delirious, achingly full and willing to let Steve take everything and more without a moment's hesitation.
This isn't any different from those times he's gotten front-row tickets to the recurring shitshow that is Tony berating himself for reasons associated with emotional rather than aesthetic shortcomings (fear of commitment, inability to express emotions and insufferable neuroticism, to name a few, and no, those last two aren't mutually exclusive). Likewise, he'll be pulling a face of utter misery then as well, until such a time when he's figured out something to counteract Tony's mood with or it goes away on its own.
to make that shot if you hadn't been about t'be torn t'shreds," he answers. Although his tone is markedly airy, there's an accusatory, almost angry undercurrent swinging in it, and his lip twitches up and down with a strange emotion.
Steve is breathing heavily in his ear when he finally slows. Tony’s arms shake and he utters a surprised yelp as Steve releases him and he barely manages to keep himself from falling. One hand squeezes his neck and brushes down his spine before it falls away, only the shadow of it lingering in the shape of gooseflesh covering Tony’s skin.
He chose his next words with care, wanting to distract from the matter with a dry tone, "Sometimes, yes. Not every time the opportunity presents itself."
They stare at each other for a beat.
"Dreamed again," Tony says, confirming what Steve's already suspected. It doesn't explain why in the world they're so close Steve can feel his breath on his skin, though. The exact opposite should be the case: Tony should be all the way across the bed, far away from Steve.
Shouldn't he be indifferent to these punishments of the flesh? After all, he's done worse things to himself dozens of times before, carved out meat and bone to replace it with iron and circuitry. What is a violation of bodily autonomy in comparison, really? Isn't this raw, animal desire of Steve's more natural than the whir of Stark's mechanical parts as he weakly pushes against him in protest?
The man’s an outcast first-class, sure, and a past version of Steve might’ve not been able to look past that one characteristic. A past him (and he doesn’t like to admit to that fact) would’ve maybe done what Stone expected them to do, what he
He could still close his eyes, of course he could. It's just–Steve's expression is so genuine. He's asking for nothing but his attention and to be heard out, and Tony can't refuse him, can he, when Steve's going to these lengths for
Having arrived at the very bottom of the spiral staircase, Peter followed the only illuminated corridor to its other end, the great, spruce wood double-doors there already wide open to allow him entrance.
"Well, your dad has–"
Later, Tony bids them goodbye with a provocative, little wave and retreats back into the house, in which peace is finally reestablished. Steve waits outside until they're about to leave – which is when an older woman with cropped hair who appears to have overseen the entire operation approaches him and quickly makes her intentions known.
wrapping his hand around his weeping dick helps jog his memory.
He pauses, regarding Tony with that one scowl he inevitably defaults to whenever they come face to face. Tony drops his arms to his sides, only now noticing he's been hugging himself, and sighs in exasperation. “Are we done?”
"Remember that time you got back from Europe and I was convinced you came back the night before?"
His eyelids fluttered shut with a few, rapid blinks and his mouth fell open in a long-drawn, breathy groan as he bottomed out,
is still up for debate.) Tony would be feeling something akin to happiness if he could still feel his body, but as it is, he doesn't think of feel much of anything.
Don’t count your chickens, mister.
Fuck, he wants this. He might want it a little too much.
Tony feels the floor drop out from under him.
Bruce raised an eyebrow but chose not to object, instead dragging a wheeled tray up to the cot before he returned to his workstation.
Steve planned to check in on Pepper and Morgan again sometime, but not straight away; he doesn't intend to come off as pushy or intrusive. Then again, he has no way of knowing if he was sent back to the present, or even
Sir James Rhodes was knighted by Lord Howard at eighteen, still young and green despite his prowess and claims to the contrary.
His eyelids are still heavy, but he forces them open and immediately zeroes in on the long blades of grass brushing the tip of his nose. Steve sits up, brushing leaves and small twigs off of himself while he does.
Star-studded gazes and sweet nothings whispered against heated skin and swollen lips between messy, open-mouthed tongue-to-tongues. The warmth of their shared bed, entangled limbs, languid kisses and soft touches to counteract the violence.
The reality seems to sucker-punch him like it did Tony a few minutes ago: he has already lost. There’s nothing he can do to change the past. (Except he can, he’s done it before and not just once if his written and spoken word is worth a damn, and Tony is only one of many failed attempts, nothing more than another line on the tally.)
When he meets Tony's gaze, his smile is hopeful.
Steve isn't the only one who's taken notice. The Parker kid comes running moments later, his face a colorful mixture of disbelief and dark apprehension as he passes Steve. More and more heroes begin to crowd closer upon realizing the cause for the battle's abrupt end. Their quiet voices are a blur in Steve's ears, the only thing he can make out his own heartbeat reverberating in his head.
When he closes his eyes, he does it in peace.
There used to be a time it didn’t, not by a long shot, but now the door to the workshop will keep Steve out, an insurmountable barrier no matter whether it’s locked or not. On the rare occasion he does overcome it, Steve appears with food and an apology. Tony feels queasy thinking about both; he should be the one apologizing. It's not Steve's fault someone not only impersonated him but copied his likeness from the exact octave of his voice to the proportions of his dick.
Steve's hand released the bruising grip on his hip to cover Tony's smaller one that was flattened to the table. He still wore the wedding ring on his fourth finger, titanium gleaming in the harsh light like a promise doomed to be broken. Tony had taken his own off days ago, a spur of the moment decision during a particularly vocal screaming match of theirs. A decision he came to regret but didn’t know how to undo.
minute takers make off, the tablet they punched all the information he provided them into leaving in the woman's hands, while the remaining agent stays positioned at the door.
Steve shakes the thought. Their chance of
Upon opening his eyes, Tony catches Steve lick what is presumably a drop of come off his palm. Which is interesting, because Tony is pretty sure he was still covered in his own a while ago, and now he's squeaky clean without either of them having moved for a tissue.
Steve says, his gaze heated and intimate while his breath ghosts over Tony's still parted lips. "There's–so much fire, and brilliance and
There's a second of absolute stillness in which neither of them blinks, Tony's hands on his chest a point of contact that sets his skin aflame even through the shirt. But it only lasts so long, and after Tony has squeezed his eyes shut, his gaze is frantic when he opens them again.
Despite himself, Steve eventually does shed his sweat-stained uniform to replace it with the fresh clothes. He can smell himself on the old ones and can’t imagine that to be pleasant for anyone with a nose good enough to pick up on pheromones, so he figures Tony would rather he wear the things than stink up the place.
Rogers' voice is closer than it was; looking up, Tony sees his caravan of mules waiting just a few feet away and reins his horse in. They've made halt at a mostly even stretch of trail, the other man turned awkwardly in his saddle to address Tony behind him.
His gaze wanders from Tony's shape off to the side, where something seems to suddenly catch his eye. He stills, and before Tony gets to snark back, Steve is heaving himself upright and off the bed.
"The way you–" Tony's voice dies, and he gestures lamely with one hand to explain a matter too difficult to put into words. Sighing in frustration, Tony bites his lip while shaking his head as if to reprimand himself for his inability to speak the words out loud.
beautiful," Steve kisses
Steve declares the event over. He waits for everyone to retreat to their designated sleeping spaces before he lets Buck and Nat pull the man to his feet, who barely manages to keep himself upright as he walks. Steve makes a point of leaving him to struggle on his own; he isn't about to allow anyone take the man apart until there's nothing left, but he's got little sympathy for an outcast first-class beyond that.
(Or once they're in the car, if they really can't wait. Or the toilet stall, if they really,
He clasps and unclasps his hands in his lap, watching his fingers move. The skin is spotless, impeccable. It bothers him. No scars, no marks, no calluses. Nothing to show for, nothing left but the memory of war and bloodshed.
Bucky. His voice is guarded, not betraying a thing, but when Steve's head snaps up, his eyes are dark with a sense of foreboding. He's got a good guess of what's on Steve's mind, but is hesitant enough not to move before getting a definite confirmation.
Steve's heart aches with a force that punches the air out of him as Tony curls back into himself, toward his injured limb. It could be the injury that is torturing him, the phantom pain or both. He's seen it often in the war, way back when, and the distant memories of fellow soldiers torn apart by landmines and cries of agony over extremities that were no longer there feel like a fever dream now.
There's a casual, cheery familiarity in his tone as he says, "Honey? FRIDAY said you wanted me to–"
Then again, the bastard did play him like a fiddle until the very end, so maybe there is one piece they’ll finish under the thunderous applause of no one at all.
Steve recalls telling him, moments after he'd helped a too-thin but alive Tony off the spaceship.
Steve curls around the man pressed to his front tighter to keep the warmth from escaping best as possible, one arm over his stomach and the other serving as a pillow for his head, his hand brushing away the dark, sweat-soaked curls from his forehead. His features have relaxed as he’s slipped into a sudden sleep; there’s nothing left to indicate the sharp tongue and all that fierce wit hidden underneath.
Steve retreats, disappears. Someone else comes back. He isn't different, not in any physical way that matters. Except where before there was the Mediterranean sea in his eyes there's now the antarctic–he might have crawled out of that block of ice but he’s never gotten warm again.
It takes approximately 74 seconds, 140 mg of caffeine and Steve pulling him across the counter to press a kiss and a mumbled “I couldn’t ask for a more enthusiastic welcoming committee” to his lips for Tony to notice all things strange about the picture greeting him.
"What is it?" James had asked just an hour into their outing, keeping his tone light. When the other didn't answer, he carefully added, "Howard again?"
He wore shabby linen clothes under simple leather guards strapped to his arms and legs speckled with dirt and blood, some of which appeared to be his own. A puncture wound in his thigh caused him to limp as he approached, face not even contorting in a way that would betray the pain he must have undoubtedly been in.
Steve doesn’t mourn the man he was before. His old self caused him to miss out on many a precious opportunity, made him hesitate when he should’ve pounced, made him weak.
Now, Tony savors the familiar quiet between them; it's a reassurance that they don't need to talk to communicate. Steve's lips resting on his neck mumble
"Now, I'm sorry, Captain, but you'll excuse me for not taking your word for it, seeing as it's very clear where your loyalties lie. Look, I know Stark's had a hard time of it. And
"I'm sorry, Buck," he says, his voice a rasp. End of the line.
Tony asks about it. Instead of an answer, he gets a question, a ring and the promise of forever.
Cruel. Vicious. Evil. Something has to be wrong with him, wanting to spend the rest of his life with this man. Well, no shit, but–goddamn it. How much worse can it realistically get? Trying to compliment himself will be awkward, stupid and terrible for sure, but at least he’ll get off. No blue balls is a pretty good payoff, all things considered.
He would have offered a sip of some strong spirit as well, but he knew better; Anthony Stark had not been a drunkard in a long time, and Bruce was not going to be the one to break the man's resolve when he was out of his mind with pain.
When it's time to leave, Tony is nowhere to be found. Steve scours the entire house, heart racing, blood rushing in his ears, hands shaking and sweat gathering at his temple–and he finds him upstairs, in a smaller bedroom with a great window. He's facing the street and the city beyond, early morning light throwing pale, pastel shadows across his features.
Days pass, then a week. They already have rationed their supplies, but agree to cut down on the portion size when it becomes apparent that none of it will last at this rate.
There is no time for the crippling fear of death, no second to spare to be overwhelmed or thunderstruck. The deer that freezes in the headlights is the one that finds its demise first, long before the starving one or the one slain by predators. Whoever belonged into that category hasn’t seen much of the apocalypse before they became one of its countless casualties, another tragedy forgotten in the masses.
because there has to be a golden thread somewhere, right? Something that ties it all together, that makes it computable, measurable, quantifiable–
"Okay. Because if this is… if this is what I think it is, then I want you to know that I have never, not even for a second, considered you to be below my–my league or any of those things going through your head right now."
Tony thinks, just as Steve drives into him with renewed vigor like somehow the words have led him to express his want even more urgently.
“C’mon. What else?”
ever since the wormhole and still; look where it got them.
He had been fortunate; a fractured bone was an ugly affair, especially one in the ankle. The procedure of resetting the broken pieces was an agonizing one, both for the patient and, to some extent, the surgeon.
That somewhere is visible through his eyes, and there's a certain disappointment, guilt and anger in them that Tony neither knows what to do nor wants anything to do with.
Tony doesn’t return, and the hours stretch into eternity in the enclosed space of the small room.
Fine is an understatement, even. He's always liked flaunting certain parts of himself, flattering himself with something maybe a little too tight or cut too deep, and he knew people saw it and liked it and he liked
"Don't bullshit me, Rogers," he hisses, voice tight and vicious with suppressed anger clawing itself to the surface.
Throughout it all, it’s always been him and Tony. Him and Tony throughout the heartbreak, the horror, the tragedy. Him and Tony and something warm between them that thrived and prospered in spite of it all. The both of them, together, proving that there could still be things in this world that are good and right.
He smirks at Steve, who mirrors his expression.
He approaches at a leisurely pace until his boots knock the kneeling man’s legs, meeting Stark’s wild, wide-eyed glare with an amicable smile. “What were you going to say? I didn’t catch that, Anthony.”
me. Please stop choosing to put yourself in what you know is harm's way. You may not care for your own well-being, but I do."
It pained him, keeping Anthony at an arm's length when everything he wanted was to proclaim his love for all to hear, but there was nothing to be done. They had known the consequences when they chose each other.
he reprimands himself, clenching his jaw and crushing the glimmer of hope Tony's words have ignited in his chest underneath the metaphorical heel of his boot before he gets any stupid ideas.
Steve brings his hand up and presses a kiss to his knuckles, a reminder that despite the cruelty he's inflicted, he is capable of love in the same or an even greater capacity. (He isn't sure whether it's Tony or himself he's reminding.)
Tony pushes himself to the side as well, supporting his weight on his elbow. He levels Steve with a look.
Steve purses his lips and rubs his neck, trying to quench the embarrassment flaring up. She's a Stark – of course he can't keep up, not in this regard.
Arms wrap around him and settle at his hips, and Tony knows the shape of the man that presses up against his back maybe better than he knows his own (or knew, until just recently, and isn't everything so much more fun now that he does).
when it shouldn't be able to happen?
"Gee, I don't know, maybe because I sound like I've got a screw loose? I mean, what, your doppelgänger invading our home life? You gotta admit that’s pretty out there. Hence I figured, benefit of the doubt. So what if the bruises look like handprints? Nothing else happened and I wrote it off as a weird coincidence. And it was, it was just that. Until…"
“No, it’s not,” Tony admits. “How about we get you back to bed and talk about this?”
Sure, the wording went somewhere along the lines of him wanting to 'worship every part of Tony in excruciating detail, inside and out' but Tony chalked that up to the heat of the moment. Besides, the majority of the last ten minutes he's been preoccupied thinking about whether
There's also the various aches that yesterday's journey is responsible for, but that one was, at the very least, a once-off thing. If Rogers is unwilling to re-negotiate their sleeping arrangements, Tony will have to spend months (not) sleeping on this cursed piece of furniture.
, this's just my luck."
Tony chucks the flip phone back into the drawer and leaves. Yeah, letting one absentee father dictate his life was enough. He’ll keep it. Her. Him. Them. (Dear God, don't make it twins.)
Tony twitches in a way that's almost a flinch but isn't. His eyes dart in Steve's direction for a moment, a nervous flicker, like he needs to know whether Steve's heard the words too. It's just like him to check for a reaction to his own vulnerability, like Steve doesn't already know what's clearly and understandably troubling him. Like it's his responsibility to function like a machine and shield his daughter from any and all emotions that aren't hers.
Doesn’t quite feel like six months when the pain in his sternum is the same as it was when the bone there was still cracked. Figures. You can’t put an expiration date on betrayal.
Tony throws his head back and groans, a noise that instantly causes Steve to direct his attention back to him.
How in hell he’s ended up the recipient of this man’s unending affection may be an enigma, but that doesn’t mean he can’t enjoy what's being given. Tony pillows his head on his crossed arms and settles in for a longer session. Steve’s lips linger on the scarred center of his chest for a moment longer than they did on any of the other spots, and it feels as though his skin retains some of their warmth when they detach from him.
for it. Someone with Steve’s voice and face broke into their house and he spread his legs and got off on being violated.
he says, and Steve evidently doesn’t like the tone. Tony clears his throat and moves up again. “And, the scars. You, um, you don’t like how they came to be, but you think they’re a reminder of how far I’ve come and what it took to get here, and that’s. Why you think they're beautiful.”
are you?"
Sharon says, "She knows what she's doing."
"I gotta say," the man says, stepping foot out of the car first, his presence still imposing as ever. "I was
Space is vast and cold, but Tony doesn’t fear it anymore–not in the way he has once dreaded the idea of it, looked upon it in his worst dreams and let it consume him in his most sleepless of nights. The terror that once might’ve choked him is gone, curbed and dwarfed by a reality crueler than anything his mind could’ve envisioned.
Tony feels a tired but warm smile overtaking his features almost instantly. He wipes his hands on the fancy napkin and then reaches out for Steve's that's laying palm up on the table, fiddling with one end of his own, unused napkin–a nervous habit Tony has only ever observed in himself.
The pure affection now written in his every feature that Tony sometimes still struggles to acknowledge is meant for him.
At midnight, he returns back home, to quiet hallways and empty rooms, and before he realizes what he’s doing, his feet have carried him to Steve’s office once again. It’s a path he could walk effortlessly even in pitch darkness. Whatever that says about him. There’s no kidding himself: this room is still Steve’s, with all the little trinkets and pictures where he left them three months ago.
for Steve. Tony being nice to himself helps get him off. That's where they are now, where Tony has gotten them, and… he can work with that.
Tony doesn't manage to keep anything down until a couple of days in, and even then it's just the smallest of portions of conserved fruit and the like. He almost seems reluctant to eat, which Steve chalks up to his fear of getting sick again until sometime later he catches him squirming on the bed, discomfort written in his pinched expression because of course basic human needs don't change even when you're bed bound.
“My Steve did what the Tony in your universe did.”
As it turns out, joining a glorified coalition of neo-nazis gets you pretty far up on the UN's shitlist, so the initial skepticism was to be expected. If there's one thing Tony hates it's bureaucracy, but damn him if he's going to disallow someone the chance to atone for past mistakes. (Without redemption, what would he be? Just the man who killed the last generation of Maximoffs?)
He cuts himself short, breathes in for a long moment as if to steady himself. “I nearly had my throat slit to get my hands on this, and you... See, a lot of us in first get high on these chemicals – don’t look at me, I got tired of it a decade ago – and so people get very agitated very quickly when they realize you’re what’s standing between them and their next hit. But what they don’t know–”
The reminder that almost all of his and Tony’s fallouts could’ve easily been avoided if they’d just opened their damn mouths and talked to each other pains Steve to this day. They always had to take the path of greatest resistance.
She sat at the head of the bed with her legs folded to the side, creating a pillow. Her gray sweatpants were graced with a dark patch where the side of Tony's face was pressing into her thigh, mouth hanging open. Every once in a while, he would moan and more would dribble from the corner of his lips, a string of saliva soaking into the material below.
Tony realizes some things aren't the way they seem. Herding cattle is one of them, Steve Rogers is another.
"Call if you need anything. Or– on second thought, maybe don't," he says, rubbing his forehead as it creases with a frown. "I'll get you some bedding and, uh, clothes. Later."
Steve arrives at the ground floor when he sees it in the corner of his eye. There’s a flurry of movement on top of the stairs, but the moment he whips around to inspect it further, everything appears unchanged.
He's practically mouthing the words, but Steve has no problem understanding. There’s a blue tinge to his lips, drawing his gaze to them. They become another point of intrigue, plush and pretty as they are even drained from all their rosy color.
But then he stumbles off the ship with Nebula keeping him from keeling over then and there, and he sees Steve running toward them. Correction: Earth is a close second.
Steve rises to his feet and pauses, looking out over the city from the vantage point that is the rooftop they've found themselves on. He can make out sirens in one direction, gunshots and screams in the other. This city crawls with scum of the worst kind–be it Stark on one or Steve on the other side–smells of waste, piss and toxic fumes, and will either eat you alive or spit you back out worse than you were.
The other man scoffs, his disgruntled stare solidifying. He crosses his arms over his chest defensively. “Yeah? Well,
Once the recordings are done and over with, Tony doesn’t think much at all. As though his subconscious has kept him up and aware just so he could go through with this one thing he knew he still had to do, and then gave up the fight, finally stopped thrashing like a feral cat.
Which he'll admit is laughable, because he's never really stopped, has he? He never stopped loving this man, and so help him God, he probably never will. It's how he's wired. Maybe he does have too much love to give. If he's ever thought
His family would mourn him, for a couple of months. Morgan...she'd miss him, for some time, but Rhodey and Happy would step up to help her through the loss, and besides, she's four years old. For all it's worth, Tony doesn't remember the first four years of his life. Losing a loved one is hard, even if they were an absolute dick during their lifetime (thanks for that, Howard) but they'd recover. They--
Tony sighs and fists a hand in the hair at the back of his skull. Steve isn't sure if it's his turn to speak; in any case, he wouldn't know how to react, and there seems to be something more on Tony's chest.
After everything that happened, Tony also refuses to help, with a twist to his lips and the home he built from the ashes in mind.
Rogers' eyes widen a fraction when he notices him leaning in, but Tony forgets about it as soon as their lips meet.
Steve.
“Thanos, the one from the past, he figured out what we were doing. Came back, tried to take the Stones.” Steve decides to get it over with quickly. Rip off the band-aid and it’ll hurt less. Figures. “Tony– he did it. We could've figured something out, I know it could've gone differently, but he just. It was down to him and Thanos, and he took the Stones and–”
"I am everyone," Yinsen repeats, looking just like he does in those dreams Tony sometimes still has, when he tells him not to waste his life over and over until the worlds reverberate like a broken record in his head.
Steve doesn't miss a beat.
“Very well,” the A.I. responds.
Steve is about to lean away, but then stops dead in his tracks when he catches a whiff of a strange smell – one that’s definitely not the Kronole. This scent isn’t predominantly burnt and sour; in truth, it’s not unpleasant at all.
He can't imagine the agony the man must've been in until the shock set in. This right here, it's more than just laying down on a wire. No, Tony took the wire and the barbs and pulled it apart with bare hands.
"I bet you these fucking morons don't even know it's there," he scoffs, and then, words pouring from his mouth at a velocity that gives Steve's ability to follow their meaning a run for its money, explains the exact approach in which the circuitry needs to be intercepted so as to not damage it – just, you know, in case he doesn't make it.
“I’d imagine. It’s alright, Tony. I’m just– it’s a little much, is all,” he says eventually. Understatement of the century, but that’s something he’ll keep to himself. “Call Fury. Pretty sure he’s gonna want to see this for himself.”
His voice has an edge to it, laced with something that Tony now, as he listens closer, realizes is not anger directed at him but Steve himself. The other man is rubbing his thumbs in even circles over the raised skin above Tony’s hip bones – two bumps that are significantly less prominent than they were the last time he checked.
Maybe it’s the knowledge that it might be their last time; maybe it’s the way Tony looks, healthy and bathed in the golden rays of the morning sun. Maybe it’s the peaceful air of acceptance hanging in the room, knowing that whatever has to happen will happen and they’ll spend these last hours together sharing their love.
It's very different when he's there and has only his own thoughts to keep him company. The serenity becomes too loud, the loneliness crushing. He isn't used to being alone anymore – before, he's had the compound, and before that, there was the tower – and doesn't like it. It's a reminder of the time after they'd found him in the ice and he'd gotten the apartment in Brooklyn, thinking it'd do him well to be back there. Except, well, it wasn't anything like he imagined; he could spot enough things reminding of his time, but that wasn't it.
"Why do
"Don't you fucking dare die on me, Steve," he says suddenly, the words spoken gently despite his language. His voice is almost inaudible to Steve, and still even the hint of it seems to soothe all his pains.
The other man hums in agreement. "You did," he says, sounding thoughtful. Then, he points at what Tony knows is his bruised jaw with a gloved finger. "That got anythin' to do with it, perchance? Runnin' away from somethin', maybe?"
Tony closes his eyes and breathes, fist closed tightly around the Soul Stone in his hand.
His resolve to wait even another second breaks right then. Steve guides himself in-between Stark's cheeks, another gush of liquid greeting his cockhead as it pushes against the fluttering muscle of his opening.
Tony places a kiss on the skin under his ear. "It's been two weeks, babe."
They won't be friends, but a truce is justified by all accounts.
and a ragtag group of equally irritating aliens. Strange says, “one way”, and nobody would've backed out anyway, but this seals the deal.
In time, Steve can push a finger in. With spit being the only lubricant, the drag is a lot rougher than usual; he watches Tony suppress a flinch as he begins fingering him in earnest. But with pain comes desire, and Tony bites his lip as the thrust of Steve’s fingers is joined by Steve moving his hips in the same rhythm. The implication that Steve could have him like this does something to Tony; he reaches up behind him to drag Steve down by his hair and seal their lips together forcibly.
thoughts about Rogers out of his mind.
For a time, James feared he would abandon the battlefield without his oldest friend by his side, but the gods had decided to spare him. Through some miracle working of one medicine man turned wizard by the befitting name of Strange, Anthony had lost neither his life nor his arm that day.
–from his parents and Barnes to Thanos and the stones–didn’t happen the way they did just because. None of it was their doing, not really. They were just puppets.
The sound gets stuck in his throat as he catches his reflection in the mirror. His gaze is drawn to the blue-purple splotches on his hip and the finger-shaped bruises wrapping around his waist. Like Steve’s hands did yesterday.
Gullible is what he is, more than Steve has ever been. He's tired of playing dancing monkey for a man who has stopped being on his eye level all too long ago. Let them have his head on a pitchfork; Steve will help put it there.
There's a rustle from the top of the bed, and when he lifts his head, Stark's casting him a
Tony huffs in exasperation. "This is unreasonable. Nothing's happened yet, and nothing will happen this night. Just let me keep watch, and you–"
“I’m just gonna–”
And then again, later, against the window overlooking the city, because Romanoff's words have left him feeling that kind of way.
Steve's cock gave a twitch, and Tony produced another soft sound of lust but remained relaxed, his walls tight but not gripping him either.
do it either, doesn’t even want to entertain the thought for too long, so there’s no options left except going at it the true Stark way: ignorance, insomnia and inventing binges.
This winter is bound to be wonderful. If he doesn’t freeze to death, he’ll be guaranteed to have died of blue balls by the end of it.
There's a moment of stunned silence. After, the man chuckles in disbelief and takes a long sip of his beer (to buy himself time while he thinks of an appropriate response that'll shut him up, Tony assumes) but when the blond eventually speaks up again, it's not to discuss further.
The core team of the Avengers gather in the lobby of the office space soon enough, minus Doctor Strange and King T'challa with their people. There's the attempt of a discussion on how to assist the public and countries of the world with further rebuilding efforts, but nobody appears entirely focused on the task at hand. They still have something else to deal with, and no matter how much Steve even dreads to think of it -- it has to be done.
You don't get to suck about half of MIT's dicks by virtue of your wunderkind title–even though a lot of them definitely got off on seeing the Stark kid, resident genius, on his knees. That position of power never was what it was made out to be, because anyone who put their genitals anywhere near his mouth was at
After various winding paths, issues primarily caused by stubborn mules and another three hours, Tony's caravan has made it down to the agreed upon place. The foot of the mountain is visible from here; it figures that they would make them trail all the way down here instead of meeting somewhere in the middle. He scoffs as he swings off Butterfingers' back and ties the horse to a low-hanging branch nearby.
Rogers stands back up, and there's a touch of rue in his voice when he says, "Sorry, bud."
It's moments like this where he doesn't look changed; at this angle, his bad arm is hidden from Steve's view and the light makes him appear younger, those years he has aged in the past month alone suddenly gone.
Hell, it's a wonder they even got anybody on the phone. With half of humanity returning through the snap of a finger, you'd think chaos would ensue in a similar way it did when they disappeared. Not that it isn't chaotic, but it seems not everyone is so out of their mind with joy to let work be for a day or two.
He needs to focus on the questions he can answer, starting tomorrow. If this Nick Fury is anything like the one Steve is familiar with, it’ll take some persuading to get the man on his side. Once he’s done that, he can start thinking about how to get the Tesseract and what to do should his one possible ticket home prove useless.
That's it, gorgeous. Oh,
Steve indulges in the fantasy for a moment: completing a mission, returning to a warm body already waiting, losing himself in it. Not having to be alone. Channeling his frustrations into something other than gym gear and adversaries, both of which leave something to be desired in terms of durability. Naturally, it would take time, but he can see Stark coming around at some point. Even that too-smart brain of his will come to the inevitable conclusion that there's no point in struggling and making life harder on himself when exemplary behavior will get him rewarded in various ways.
matter) message make way for silence as quick as they came. Both of them are long past those early stages of being fazed at one another's nudity, so that's not it.
she sings, and Steve holds him closer, grows a little bolder in his movements.
“I will never have an heir, 'least not in the way dear old Howard intended, that is. Still, that does not mean I haven’t been looking tirelessly for one outside the Stark lineage. And, well…”
Tony takes a quick shower and then fetches the first aid kit from the bathroom cabinet. As he slathers some ointment on and haphazardly wrapps it all in gauze, he reminisces about their last conversation on the phone.
Tony pulls a grimace. "Is there? Because I'm sorry, but I don't… This is not me trying to rile you up, by the way. I fail to see your point."
"We're beautiful," he tells Steve, through the cushions he's deposited his face on. It feels and sounds like something of an epiphany, a
Tony's intently staring at the wall next to him. He's biting his lip when he looks back at Steve, and shoves his hands down the front pockets of his pants. (Hands. It's always Tony's hands that'll betray his nerves first, so he makes sure he won't get tempted.) His gaze drops down to his feet again. Clearly there's something he wants to get off his chest; all the signs are there.
“F.R.I.D.A.Y...pump some Cool air in there so our friend doesn’t heat up.”
{text my love } how would you know :p ?
“Steven Grant Rogers!”
“I’ll stay. We can watch a corny movie.”
“Stop! Stop! Stop acting your cared! I hate you so much! I hate you so much!!!!!” His fingers hung over the end button but he couldn’t bring himself to hit despite the hatred Hearing his Voice brought him comfort.
“You really do have a death wish.”
“Are we gonna celebrate Steve’s birthday ? I mean If you want too.”
“Look I am reading up on this Villain and it looks like she has left a lot of death in her wake.  Man and woman literally burning to death.”
Steve stumbled  down the road without a care, he was numb to the world has been since he buried Tony. At least drunk he didn’t face the empty World that he was now living  in.
“You are lucky you are cute! “
“Your poor love will freeze. I hope you are happy on your run.” Tony said or more the heap of blankets mumbled.
“I can’t go to him. ``Tony said To himself as he stumbled over to the bag. Steve would think he has won and that everything would hunky Dory.. that what he did was okay and that tony would come running back into his arms. Taking a few steps Tony collapsed when he realized he could forgive Steve as much as he wanted too. His knees hit the floor hard and he let out a sob. It wasn’t fair. He didn’t do anything wrong.
“Well let’s get it out shall we ?”
“Fuck You !”  Steve shouted from wet grass as he tried to push himself up but kept falling down.
“You wanted a family ? “
“It’s your daddy's birthday today Sarah and Morgan.” Tony sniffed and kissed both their foreheads.
“I wanted a family with you. I wanted a home. I gave up SI or did.....I’m back but not like I have anything else. You took away our happy and the avengers at the same time.”  The grip he had on the phone  hurt as he white Knuckled it. The tears were falling down his cheek freely now. God, his heart hurt so much right now. Why  did he still feel like  this ? Why did he let Steve Rogers onto his heart?
“I will spend every moment proving that I am here.” He would start by not leaving his side ever.
“I can’t breathe.”
Tony cried in Bucky’s arms for a little while longer.  Then he gathered himself and went to the twins. Picking them both up in his arms.
“Sure, you design me a suit and I’ll get it made.”
Steve asked softly, his thumb rubbing over Tony’s bottom lip.
“Sam wants to give Rhodey his jacket and Rhodey isn’t having it,” Tony responds.
Steve gives a small smile, “What are you doing here?”
“Nothing.”
“My stupid boyfriend ended up in the hospital because he did something stupid.”
Again Tony couldbhear Steve’s thoughts, “You can put your hands on my waist if you want,” he suggested.
The team all practised and perfected these sayings and a few other basic phrases and questions such as
Tony walks over to her, “How is he? The bastards won’t tell me anything.”
Halfway through the movie Tony sighs, “Stop staring at me Steve it’s creepy.”
Tony sighs, he knows this. He knows Steve won’t hurt him. He knows Steve. But he doesn’t know Captain America.
“Steve is going to freak out when he hears that you’re here.”
The painting is of a person, a man to be exact. Not just any man, Tony Stark. Himself. Steve Rogers’ featured painting is of Tony. Steve Rogers knows who Tony is. Steve Rogers didn’t just paint his building but also his face. Tony thinks he’s going to faint. To make matters worse, Steve Rogers is making his way towards Tony right now. Tony is frozen, he wants to leave, run somewhere, anywhere, but his legs betrayed him.
“Maybe drinking all of this coffee instead of sleeping isn’t a good idea but hey I’m an insomniac so who am I to judge.”
Steve asked Tony out while lying in a hospital bed after a particularly nasty fight with Thanos. The Avengers won of course, but at the expense of Steve’s wellbeing. Tony was sitting on an extremely uncomfortable hospital chair beside Steve’s bed, holding his hand, waiting for Steve to wake up. He fell asleep like that so when Steve eventually opened his eyes and saw Tony waiting beside him, small cold hands wrapped tightly around his larger ones, that’s when he knew his feelings were reciprocated. Feelings he harboured inside himself for years beforehand, not willing to jeopardise what they had going.
Steve steps closer to Tony, breath hot on Tony’s face, “I'd be careful if I were you Tony.”
It’s awkward, neither of them are saying anything to each other and the room is silent, everyone watching in anticipation for something magical to happen.
“It’s just, your suit is so ugly, who designed it?”
Tony agreed to Steve’s request and goes to kiss Steve again, winding his hands around the back of Steve’s neck. Steve’s hands found their way around Tony’s waist again. He started moving his hands up and down Tony’s sides and got a small moan from Tony.
“You should go.”
After that day Tony and Steve officially got together. There were many ups and downs but here they are, five years later, having sex instead of saving the world and getting ready for their Valentine’s day festivities.
“I guess I’ll be the judge of that,” Steve jokes. He hands over the money for the coffee and walks to the end of the bench again, waiting for his coffee.
Tony laughs, “Thank you Happy.” Tony exits the car and makes his way towards the exhibition.
Tony walks over to Steve’s bed and sits on the seat beside it, grabbing Steve’s free hand to hold and starts rubbing his knuckles.
“I’m in love with you Steve, and that fucking scares me,” Tony shouts, “You’re you and I’m me. I didn’t think anything could happen before I even knew you were Captain America. This is so hard Steve because I never fall in love. I never trust people. I never let people in. But then there’s you and your stupid cheesy grin and your beautiful face and your perfect body and now you’re a hero. An actual real life hero who has saved people. And I’m just me. A guy who got into MIT at the age of 14 and hasn’t done anything since. A guy who lost both of his parents in a car crash when he was 21. A guy with two friends and one of them is my boss. A short, ugly, boring guy with so many problems. I’m afraid to love you Steve, but I’m also afraid to lose you.”
“You should let me design you a suit.”
“Then why do you keep ignoring me?” Steve was calm.
“What was that, Captain?” Thor asked loudly, drawing the attention of the whole room towards them.
“And all the celebrities from Australia are actors, what do actors do for a living? They lie,” Bucky adds to his boyfriend’s point.
“Rhodey doesn’t like the jacket. And he’s your best friend.”
Tony never expected Steve to come back, or to call him so to say that he was shocked to see Steve enter the coffee shop at the same time again the next day was an understatement.
Steve just shook his head at the villain’s awful pronunciation. He doesn’t have to explain himself to a low level villain, or any villain at that. The man looked at Steve expectantly, waiting for an explanation.
Pro: Tony brought up the idea so he wants to do it.
“I’m not just Captain America, I’m also a normal guy called Steve Rogers.”
“It’s soon.”
Tony just shrugs and responds with a simple, “Fine.”
Tony nods, “Sure, that will be $2.50.”
Steve hauled the man into the helicarrier cell and entered the bridge where the rest of the team were waiting for him.
Steve looked at Tony curiously, surprised that the other man pays so much attention to him. It’s nice to know that somebody cares.
Tony locks up the coffee shop and Steve walks him home.
“Well you thought I was annoying. Anyway they made us partners for that chemistry project. I thought you were just another dumb jock but you weren’t too bad. You made me fall head over heels for you and that scared me. So naturally I ignored you for six months.”
Tony leaned in to kiss Steve and Steve watched as Tony closed his eyes and puckered his plump lips ever so slightly.
Tony is crying, Steve is crying, Natasha isn’t crying but she’s happy for them.
A simple statement and everything clicks. That voice, that body, the very tasking job.
“Steve has a date?” Tony perked up. He was sitting on the couch scrolling through his Stark tablet.
His costume is ugly. Like who thought bright blue was a good idea? And those red boots are a crime against fashion. Tony could design a better suit in his sleep, and he’s not much of an artist.
The man hands over the money and walks towards the end of the till where he waits to collect his coffee. Tony starts up the machine to make the cappuccino.
Tony puts on a movie and gets the popcorn ready. He tells Steve to lie down on the couch and Tony snuggles into him. Steve interlocks their hands together, playing with Tony’s fingers.
“I’ve been following your work for a long time. I have the painting you did of my building a couple of years ago.”
When Steve leaves Tony asks, “Isn’t he just great?”
But Steve couldn’t stop thinking, had he really never spoken Irish before? Or did his team just not pay attention to him as much as he thought they did?
“Wow that boyfriend of yours sounds like a real hassle.”
Steve smiles, if Tony wants to spend more time with him then who is he to say no.
“I was watching, how am I supposed to learn with my eyes closed?”
Tony is crying now and Steve is quiet, “You know?”
“Of course, Steve Rogers is my favourite artist as you well know, I’m enamoured by his art.”
The walls are littered with paintings done by Steve especially for this exhibition. Pop up tables are scattered throughout the room with an array of appetisers; prawns, scampi, cocktail sausages, pigs in a blanket, meatballs, spring rolls, vegetable skewers. A chocolate fountain stands in the back left corner, a plate of strawberries sits beside it. Waiters are walking around with champagne flutes, handing them out to newcomers and guests with empty glasses.
“Duty calls Stevie.”
Instead, Tony channels these comments and turns them into his charming, ‘takes up the whole room’ personality.
Tony smiled, a sincere smile, “It’s called making out. There’s no reason behind it it’s just fun.”
Steve had gone up to Tony’s locker that morning and waited for him to show up to school so he could give Tony his jacket, a sign that their relationship is the real deal. According to footballers and cheerleaders anyway.
Steve heard the familiar roaring of the Iron Man suit and smiled to himself before turning around to greet Tony as he steps out of the suit. Tony smirked at Steve’s presence, and walked over to him smoothly before wrapping his arms around Steve’s shoulders and hugging him tightly.
“I mean this,” Tony says as he shoves his Starkpad into Steve’s face. On the screen was a picture of a huge billboard in the middle of Times Square with Steve and Tony’s faces on it in their superhero gear. The billboard read: ‘Captain America and Iron Man are celebrating Valentine’s day together, what about you?’
“He’s right, but I’m sure he appreciated you asking him. He’s very protective.”
It’s not until after their fifth interaction does Tony figure out who Steve really is. Or well it’s actually Rhodey who figures it out.
“That’s what you get when your boyfriend is Captain America.”
“Uh, it was Irish. My mom taught me when I was younger.”
Steve took one last glance at Natasha, who was smirking and trying to hold in a giggle, and strolled after Tony.
“Thank you, you inspired a lot of it.”
“Bullshit,” Steve says, raising his voice a little.
A few years later and Tony and Steve have adopted three kids.
Steve tries to step closer to Tony again and this time Tony doesn’t step back, but he makes no effort to get closer to Steve either.
Tony watched Steve walk around his room, “Like what you see Cap?”
“I’m sure she won’t mind.”
When Steve came over the day Tony finished it Tony couldn’t wait to show him.
Tony looks over to her direction. She looks familiar, like one of those superheroes that always helps Steve.
Steve weighed out the pros and cons about kissing Tony Stark, Iron Man, in his head.
“Mr Stark, your car is here.”
Tony scoffs, “I’d make it free of charge.”
Tony took a deep breath to calm himself, oh the things Steve does to him.
“I’m sure he would appreciate the upgrade.”
Steve blushes and smiles, “Thank you Mr Stark.”
Someone, a woman, starts speaking, “You’re Tony Stark?”
“My name is Bucky by the way,” he mentions as he walks away to find Steve.
“Special.”
The conversation was over and Steve looked nervous, confused, lost.
He’s speeches are a little too patriotic for Tony’s liking. Peace, justice, equality, the American dream. But not the American reality.
It was as if Tony could hear Steve’s thoughts, “Steve come closer, I don’t bite. Not unless you want me to,” Tony winked. Steve didn’t know if he liked Tony being suggestive but it takes the awkwardness away, or maybe it adds it on. Steve wasn’t sure.
Of course, he’s gorgeous to look at. Tony would be lying if he says he’s never jacked off while thinking of that body. Those broad shoulders, that perfectly rounded ass, those chiseled abs. Tony is getting hard just thinking of them.
Steve stops walking and stares at Tony, worry written on his face, “Does the jacket bother you?”
“How was the evening sir?”
“Oh will I now?” Rhodey raises his eyebrow.
Tony can’t see Steve among the faces, he must be appearing later.
People are staring and pointing at Tony, something he’s used to. He smiles at everyone he passes, waves at some of them.
After Tony calmed down he began to speak, “You know Cap, if you need someone to show you how to kiss, I’m right here. I am a ‘playboy’ after all.”
Tony slides down the wall opposite the counter and hugs his legs. Rhodey sits in front of him, reassuring him that everything will be okay.
Tony winks and Pepper sighs, “Everyday you make me question why I even hired you.”
,” Steve beamed at Tony before stepping closer to Tony, staring at his lips.
“Tony I did it to protect you. I always do it to protect you.”
When someone came by to remove Tony Natasha told them to leave him.
Steve throws Tony onto the bed and stares down at him, “Not on my watch sweetheart.”
“I mean it, it looks a little rough.”
Steve doesn’t pay attention to the movie, he’s too busy staring down at Tony.
“No need to get cheeky Mister Stark, or I might have to punish you,” Steve smirks.
“I’m sure you could,” the man replies amusedly.
“Yeah well I’m willing to go to jail- wait did you just say husband?”
That was Pepper, his boss. Tony works in a small coffee shop in Manhattan. The business does okay, in a city overrun by Starbucks that is. This isn’t what his MIT degree promised but it’s just a pass the time job. Something to earn him enough money to buy materials for his inventions.
Natasha smiles, “I can see why he loves you. The injury was bad but he’s doing fine, resting now.”
