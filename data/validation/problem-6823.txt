"I should think that finding a man whose mind is still in the midst of war should warrant a personal touch. Maybe some help, but, I'm not the failed Director of a clandestine agency so
There might not be much in the world that’s good but this? Watching old TV with assassins, mutants, a God and a field agent that is still technically dead? Tony looks about the room, settles on Thor and Clint debating the accuracy of hammer throwing versus hammer smashing, Natasha rising to give Pepper her seat (female chivalry?), Peter sleeping like a bonafide contortionist, Steve more asleep and leaning into Tony’s side heavily.
Darcy slams her hands on the coffee table covered in sticky notes and wires. Her hair is a tangled, poofed-up mess on one side where she kept grabbing with her free hand. “I am

“You’re mistaken,” the voice says, and Shuri’s about to snap back when it hurries on, “this isn’t for you, exactly. And Tony Stark doesn’t know I’m here. As far as Mister Stark knows, no one has been in the network except myself.” This pique’s Shuri’s interest.
One. Two thrusts and Tony’s throwing his head back, nearly screaming Steve’s name between choked out sobs and Steve’s following after a second, a terse grunt kicked out of the super-soldier as he reaches completion as well.
“If he so much as walks in an unusual manner I will have him quarantined,” Jarvis pipes up, mock-serious and Steve laughs. Leave it to Tony to make an AI with a lot less Artificial-ness and a serious, morose sense of humor.

Tony Stark opens his eyes for the first time, five days after Nick Fury loomed over his unconscious form. He chokes on the thick tube down his throat and tears come to his eyes as the machines around him begin to beep uncontrollably. He thinks he hears someone running towards him, but by the time they make it he is falling under once more.
Tony exhales, long and slow. What a shit show. Vision doesn’t smile, but his eyes shine with something Tony would call mirth.
“What-what the hell--” Tony starts and, with a startled gasp, quickly sits up. “Where is she, we have to stop her, Steve, Steve, she’s going to do some terrible, terrible shit and we have to stop her, get Thor the hell away from here, send him back to
to be there with you!” Tony retorts and he can’t stop the more panicked tone that’s rising, can’t help but feel apprehensive because he can’t let his team down, he has to be there because—what if he’s needed? What is someone is hurt and he can’t
Vision smiles, a soft and fleeting thing before he looks at Tony. “I must… travel, in order to prove something. Something that may, perhaps, be vital to what will come. It may also provide many answers to many people. However, to do so I will need to leave to London to find a scientist.”
“Hello there, Steven. What ever was the cause of such distress?” Hank ponders with a heavy shrug, pulling the slipping bag up over his shoulder.
He can let himself have this, this moment, but he knows what will come next. As soon as they find Enchantress he knows what will happen. So he can have this, can give Steve this but can’t give in to the pulsing
“This is my calling,” Amora hisses, aiming for the doorway. “And I have seen the sort of world that can be made and, darling Loki,” Enchantress’ face transforms from a smooth, serene sort of madness to a wicked, depraved visage of insanity in a mere second as the door slowly opens, “it’s going to be
And that is more than enough for Steve as he lets out this punched out, almost wounded whine and smashes their lips together, sends them both tumbling back onto the carpet.
“We tried tracing who tipped them off—because the home was mostly vacated, and we haven’t been able to pinpoint their location. For all we know, they’re not even in San Francisco. With their money and their knowledge, there’s no way to know if they’re even in the country.” Ross raps his knuckles against the table, a smirk tugging on his lips.
Tony is smart. This fact is universally known and splashed out on every newspaper at least once a month. The

—god, he’d hit Falcon with a repulsor blast, and it was only the grace of armor he had made that protected the other man. When it came down to it—
The woman moves, her left arm moving while her right shifts slightly back. She hands him a single golden apple that Tony takes without protest and without thought. Silence spreads as the blue skies begin to bleed a crimson streak and the fields all start to gray. The meadows of purple and green amaranth begin to wither away.
Steve’s hands burn when he touches the metal cuffs holding Tony down. When he recoils, though, he notices the angry red skin wrapping around Tony’s wrist in the surrounding space about the thick metal.
, that idiot would lay himself down on the line and take whatever the world throws at him and give just as good back because he’s
“What do you want, then,” Vision says at last, feeling the power imbalance in the room, “with this supposed ‘warning’, Secretary.”
“I dream of smoke and fire; death and decay. I see the destruction of the world and the malice in the eyes of those that cause it.”
“I… do not know.” Thor replies,” this does not look like my brother Loki’s brand of mischief, though there are no other Asgardians that are capable of fooling any Asgardian creature of lore to come to Midgard, or a single sorcerer whom enters this mortal realm besides my Loki.”
you!” She shrieks, changing her stance. Tony, whom had recoiled from the attack, nears once more. She turns towards him, eyes wild, and Tony freezes mid-step.
“Besides, Ross,” Rhodey picks up, catching onto Tony’s momentum, “you’re here accusing someone of something as serious as aiding fugitives of the law; I’m guessing the Accords Council denied your inquiry into Tony’s post-mission interview.”
when Jarvis announces that the Avengers have returned. Tony’s in the living room with the TV on mute, an older episode of
"They found the extent of his injuries." Pepper motions at the chart, scribbled with three different writing styles. "Tony was conscious when they did the run down. Somehow, it came back to this: the arc reactor. Something about… his sternum being crushed. Pressing down too hard on his heart, his lungs. The scarring was… it was his choice, in the end, but less of a choice. More or less, Tony’s choice came down to dying slowly, continuously, or reverting back to the technology that had been keeping him alive.”
Bucky. Hardly the grand name a rival suitor should have but nonetheless. “Yes. I’m sure he’ll wish to check on you himself. Men in love do not wish to see their beloveds hurt after all.”
“Let me buy you a new coffee at least,” the man said, still looking embarrassed, but very much like he wouldn’t take no for an answer. “Please.”
“I was meant to take over my family’s company, we work in weapons for the military, and that was always the plan. But I went with my father on a business trip to Afghanistan, and we were ambushed. I got hit by shrapnel, nearly died. And when I got back I realised I didn’t want to hurt people anymore. My heart was fucked, so I built myself a pacemaker, and then realised that maybe other people could use it too. And so I gave up my trust fund, and Rhodey came with me and we started
—I can’t tell what they are, it’s like they keep banishing it’s very annoying; Thor should know, I could only catch half of his whole spiel, sorry.” There’s the low hum, the sound of Captain America’s shield being tossed and then footsteps on gravel.
It's like a series of stills, with the words all out of place: darkness, Thor, Steve, Enchantress, Loki, blood, darkness, light, golden apples, golden hair, Steve, darkness; "Hlín protects you, the Valkyrie will guide you" they say and Tony wants to laugh because he was wrong, so wrong, he was wrong all along. He hears mad laughter and feels a hand run through his hair, whisper soothing words into the silence.
“What are you doing in here and--” Tony stumbles slightly, still dazed and slightly confused but his features sober up as he looks up from his awkward half-leaning half-stumbled pose against his workshop table. “—What are you watching.” He looks pale, out of it of sorts.
"Up there, up there in the vastness of space, in the void that is sky, up there is an enemy known as isolation. It sits there in the stars waiting, waiting with the patience of eons, forever waiting..." - Rod Serling, Twilight Zone ep. 1.1 ("Where Is Everybody?")
She’s still speaking, he thinks; Tony can feel the words like sugar drops falling into a pool of water, smooth and gentle, dissolving just as soon as they reach him. Feather-light as he falls deeper, deeper, but there is a warm weight pressing on his hand, holding him above the surface of absolute darkness.
“The Tesseract is a wondrous thing, young Steven.” Frigga interrupts, leaning forward while placing a soft hand against his neck. “I do believe this will be the first time it will have been used in mercy, for protection. Such an act will not leave it unaffected.” She pauses for a moment, as if waiting for a reply but none comes. “And if one were to bite into one of my goddess’  Golden Apple of Immortality, well, then there’s that. It may not be enough for everlasting life but it may be a great influence to the object that has just seen its first taste of a hero.” Frigga smiles as Steve twitches under her hand.
He thinks Loki might have left already. Thor is leaning heavily on Steve’s side, murmuring answers to the voices.
as collateral damage. They’re lucky for the amount of leeway they have been allotted so far since their departure.
“More than one, huh?” Hank sighs, rubs his forehead. “What are they, ex-SHIELD? More taskforce cronies?”
"Fourth floor. Down the hall. Is... is this place not familiar to you?" She opened her door as the car came to a stop and Fury looked around, hoping to get a clue, but nothing stood out of his mind until they walked to the elevators.
If someone from Asgard is trying to wipe out a whole populace, well, Tony knows where to go with his questions.
“Get out of the way!” Loki shouts as he cautiously takes a step back. Peter leaps back to the ceiling but  Tony has less time, less agility and can only brace himself as a flutter of fire surrounds Amora, spreads and causes a wave of fiery destruction. Loki defends himself with an ice replica of his own form, shooting the ice block forward in his stead.
Steve snorts and tries to even his breathing, knows the tightness of his chest is probably just him, it’s all just Steve.
"--may have tipped her off that something was amiss. She said she thinks she saw something coming his way. Something bad."
He has four windows open around his work table. The first video is silent, the feeds Jarvis has prepared and (the traitor!) showed Cap; the second is information on this “Amora” character, Enchantress, and whatever the hell she is; the third is Hank McCoy’s entire prognosis and the fourth, well, Tony didn’t really close the videos Steve was watching so let’s just say the fourth is Non-Tony doing what Inner-Tony wants to do to a clearly flipped out Steve. Only with less magical body-thief mojo and more “Brazzers” rating.
Only the scene doesn’t end there. Not when Tony’s body slumps forward, not when his eyes shut completely, not when Steve calls out his name to silence. It’s like he’s watching from the camera in the corner, an omniscient view of the going-ons without any more insight.
bond, and we aren’t exactly sure what that, that there precious little thing that gives you life does. Loki,” Tony swallows, but charges on, “he could control people, using the scepter, and we both know Strucker wasn’t using it to cure world hunger; he was… experimenting. It also infected the systems and-and somehow programmed itself into ULTRON.” Tony sighs and closes his eyes. “So it could be bad, sure, but it could also just be something harmless.  Pietro and Wanda’s powers came from the stone, right?”
“Tony,” Steve breathes, hand releasing its hold to brush the man’s cheek, the damp trails he feels there and the final tear that lingers just on Tony’s cheekbone. “Why--?”
So i quit my job, left the wildfire in Nor Cal, moved twice, and finally had time to finish and post this chapter. Sorry for the long hiatus, y'all!
"I guess," Clint starts, and he averts his eyes as he continues, "I just wanted to see how you were holding up, after all that." Clint flaps his hand up and down, in the general direction they came from. Wanda’s smile becomes a little more real.
. Steve, well to be completely honest, he feels like he's interrupting something private,  a moment between two scientists, two brilliant minds, two
They’ve reached the window panes, can see how Ross glares at them as they approach the door. How Rhodey’s happiness is tempered by the clench of his jaw. Tony takes a deep breath—god, he’s so fucking
) and His posture was relaxed, his entire body radiating comfort and peace and Steve wished he had something at hand to try and even recreate that kind of serenity--
Tony wasn’t right. It was damn near visible by the darkness that clung under his eyes from an irregular lack of sleep (because he had lived with the Avengers for over two years now, lived under the same roof with Tony for a year and a half of those two years and knew that the best that could ever be claimed for Tony’s health was a healthy dose of insomnia, malnourishment and some anxiety). No, this kind of lack of sleep had nothing to do with the plans for the Quinjet half scribbled on napkins and loose sheets of paper, nor a new upgrade for the Iron Man suit—it was the kind of sleeplessness that’s found hand-in-hand with shuddering frights that come out with the darkness, the kind of insomnia… you’d prefer to
Wanda shouts and a cloud of scarlet-red mist begins to form, begins to condense before her eyes. The Scepter begins to light up in response, and Strucker speaks once more into the room
After another thirty minutes of going over everything he lands just barely out of the city, a ten minute walk away from the psychic’s house. His armor all dismantles and locks itself back up, Jarvis leading it back to the penthouse.
“—absolutely no way. Sorry, the chemicals can burn straight away to the bone; I’m not taking my shirt off.” Tony grinds out blandly.
That… was some pretty heavy quantum science, but he lived by battling in a metal suit, his heart was still beating because of the arc reactor and Thor technically was another worldly being so the notes didn’t seem too strange.
of clearing a throat and a sound of befuddlement. She waves away Fury and actually clears her throat before starting.
She reminds him of that time, years ago, when the only solution had been to inject Stark and lock him under house arrest with some of Howard Stark's old things.
happenings around the US, and safe spots that weren’t ‘covered in red tape and bureaucracy’ for the everyday man that wanted to experience the extra-terrestrial visitations without the fear of city-wide annihilation. He’d been kind enough for the three hours they had to drive, and although he fought to keep the trip free of any charge—
“I was not the first but surely the last; took up the mission when I was asked. Mother Æsir had failed in her endeavor, left her health waning and worse than ever.” Idonae sighs, sullen. “It is a great task she has bequeathed to you; her spell had been foiled and couldn’t be started anew. I took the liberty of bringing you here.” Idonae looks up and her eyes are the same intense blue from before, the color so familiar and so comforting at once, though Tony can’t put a name to them.
Tony’s sensors report a sudden drop in temperature and he takes a cautious step back as the Landvættir all tapered by, sliding past the door and down the small isle towards the portal. They all seemed to turn their heads and hiss as they made to enter the portal. She turned towards them slightly, crying out:
"W-What?" Steve croaks and then he sees the doctors, all the wires and machines and needles and he almost jumps off the bed but the warm hand moved down to his chest and presses there.
There was something in her, too, something she hadn’t felt in a while. A mix between peace and determination. A quiet kind of… fury? She couldn’t quite place it. The subtitles announced that, although Tony Stark hadn’t quite made an appearance in some time, the new business venture was surely his doing. She spared a thought to Rhodey, remembering the chasm that opened beneath her chest when Tony told him the prognosis
—Aaron would get answers for her. Natasha looked around the solemn home, facing the stillness for the extra analysis. The woman certainly lived alone, but there were signs of another person, someone else…
“Ah, but how could you ever believe that I would side with you, Amora? It is truly astonishing, your naïveté or perhaps it is simply your inanity.” Loki sneers and looks up at the cuffs on his wrists, mutters something under his breath and the light fades away. He looks up at Spiderman, gives a curt nod and chuckles.
He wants to scream (and remembers Tony, so strong, so very stupid, how he didn’t scream until everything came coming down) but takes a deep breath and lets it out in a shaky, watery sigh.
“Selvig. Viz needs to see Selvig to see if his powers, the powers of the Mind Stone, are something he can… retroactively effect.” Tony elaborates, “I figured we would—”
Vision hesitates. “All information points to ‘yes’ but I fear it was… different to what we have been led to believe. Although some part of the stone would instinctually reach out, it seemed not to do so in comfort but… in self-preservation. A consistent need to know where she was.”
“Captain Rogers is currently in the main lobby, standing beside the elevator. I do believe the Captain is the ‘he’ you refer to.” Jarvis’ voice is bland and a little bored. Tony worries that maybe his Artificial Intelligence is less artificial than it should be before shrugging. It’s too early—or late, he hasn’t checked the time yet— to be thinking about all of this without a cup of coffee.  Tony doesn’t curse everything and everyone under his breath as he clambers up the steps to the hallway; there’s no way to prove he did, anyway.
“Remodeling has been done to fix the sub-levels, but the ground level is still a work in progress,” Vision reports, watching Tony sit up. “Colonel Rhodes has been residing in the East Wing, however,  and has maintained his strict physical therapy regime accordingly. I have calibrated his braces twice,” Vision pauses.
Steve always had a problem with feeling helpless. Before the serum he just tried to help—so many fights in so many places, busted lips and broken bones; he had only wanted to help. With the serum it was possible, he could actually help it. Right now, with Tony and his strange episodes—he felt like the Brooklyn boy that was behind the diner, pummeled and bleeding.
Ah. That, then. Rhodey puts a hand on Tony’s head and bites back a relieved sigh when the other man doesn’t flinch this time.
Steve has already made his way to her before he is consciously aware of his own movements. The alcove seems to quiet down as the two stare at each other until Steve finally bows his head and drops to a knee.
“What do you think, then?” Hank asks, because although it seems like Hope has no evidence of a second watcher, her intuition about things like this hasn’t been wrong. He hadn’t quite left the house during the first few days after the airport battle in Germany, it wasn’t like he was out and about in the first place. Hope, though, she had to trudge through the reporters, into the company, and still make like a normal, functional adult despite everything.
Using his phone, Tony scans the room and takes a sample of the pile of thread resting against the wall at the base of the tree-chalk outlined and the fragments of some kind of animal hair that dusts the floors.
but the pieces are all fitting together in his mind and it makes sense. It’s cogent psychosis, this is lucid madness but it
“I’m feeling fine, ‘oh that’s good to hear’ thank you so much,” Tony rasps as Vision hands him a cup of water with a little straw poking out. “I take it everything went… well?” Tony asks after a pause to drink.
“All that information, about the energy signatures,” she starts, “we’ve been keeping a tab on that. If you could—” no longer demanding, their original bargain already fulfilled. This is asking for a favor, something Fury knows Tony wouldn’t take lightly. “There is. Something, something coming, that Tony’s been… trying to keep ahead of. Something he saw—”
“Secretary Ross only asked for a lead. He may find proof of the fugitives having taken shelter in Sokovia, but he will not find them in Sokovia any longer.”
By the 24 hour mark, both Peter and Steve are tired and still waiting on Jarvis for any information.
"You wanted to see Tony," Pepper had said, "and although I don't care about your need to be another underground shadow, a Limo seemed to be a little more... standing out where we are going, and I don't want the media to smell this quite yet, not when--" and she had paused, swallowed, and moved on as if she hadn't stopped at all, "not when we're not ready with a response."
“Jarvis!” Steve shouts to the side, turning his head to avoid yelling in Tony’s ear. “I need you to call someone from the medical bay and Hank McCoy, uh, and can you
"How much do you know?" Pepper asks, barely stepping out of the elevator. It seemed they had been both caught up in their thoughts and hadn't moved since. Fury follows her slow steps, cautious of his next few words. He makes notes of the eerie manequins framing the wall, various limbs traded from their pale plastic into artificial metal; here, this one with braces wound around an arm, here around a leg. There, in a corner, a metal spine aligns the back of a mannequin, headless and facing the corner.
“Tony?” Steve repeats and Tony blinks out of his daze to find Steve a lot closer. He can’t look away from the worried blue eyes and Tony decides that there’s only now. There’s only this moment and if he can forget the half whispered voice in his head and the threat of a woman’s wrath on the world then it’s here with Steve.
Tony doesn’t speak for a long while, letting the words, the kindly, sympathetic voice wash over him. After a heartbeat, he speaks:
For the first time in two whole weeks, Steve lets himself fall apart. She holds him gently as he cries for the first time, as her words begin to soothe the wounds that bled so much, that tore open each day a little more.
“One, for sure, is the Taskforce. I guess Ross thinks he can spare a van or two without the US government catching whiff, but the other… I’m guessing ex-SHIELD, we haven’t caught them on camera; they haven’t gone into the property, either.”
It was a lovely day out, the winter chill brisk but not unpleasant, and the town already bustling as it was far later in the morning than they usually headed out.
They’d ended up sharing the meal Tony had brought, and Tony had waited in the office until Steve could go home so they could walk back together. It was easily one of the nicest afternoons Steve had ever spent.
He hitched Nomad to the post outside the Sheriff’s office, not bothering to remove anything. He’d head home soon enough. He just wanted a minute to stretch his legs and head over to the general store to pick up something nice for Tony - and maybe a bit of rock candy for Peter. He was pretty sure Mr Bullski wouldn’t give him any trouble.
“Tony!” He squeaked, slamming the gate he had obviously just opened shut reflexively as if to put a barrier between them. “What are you doing here?”
“Yeah we are buddy, let’s try and use our inside voices until then huh?” He picked him up to put him on the stair and shove the sneakers on his feet. “Now, let’s go over the rules again. What do we do when we get to the dog park?”
Tony wanted to say that it was Steve he would miss: that this house would be empty without his warm, comforting presence. That losing him would break Tony’s heart.
Steve pulled him close to hide his face and glared out at the room. “I think you’ll find you’ve been repaid. Now I suggest you and your friends get out of here before I find a reason to throw you out.”
She hadn’t told them. Easier to ask forgiveness than permission as her dad always said. She bet he was regretting that
“You’ll never get a date like that, son,” John said, and Steve’s head whipped around to look at him.
Steve glanced up at him, then did a double take when Tony stepped closer to sit down at his bedside and grab his hand. Tony could hear Steve swallow as he stared down at where Tony was intertwining their fingers.
When he was eventually forced to stop, he pulled into a tourist shop, his thighs aching and stiff from being on the bike for so long.
“Take my hand,” he said, reaching out, and he could see Steve was reluctant to relax any of his grip. “I’ll save you, I promise.”
Antonius groaned and swung a hock over, and Stíofán was pleased to see the doe’s own cock erect. He liked servicing Stíofán, it aroused him.
Untouched. Stíofán could feel the desire rushing southward. He was hard enough to pound iron. “I like it. That I’ll be the first Buck you’ll ever have.”
“Of course.” Tony tried to pick up the pace, while not leaving spots of gravy on himself. The Sheriff continued to look at him oddly but seemed to decide not to push it any further.
Steve nodded, taking off down the street at a run. He didn’t stop till he reached the house, not caring a whit about the dirt coming off him, and he knocked on the door. Mrs Banner answered the door, her face taking on a sympathetic look as she saw who it was. “Sheriff.”
Rhodey began to teach him, but only got thirty seconds in, before the till began to add on its own, opening itself for cash and printing the receipt. Rhodey raised an eyebrow.
“Can’t imagine,” Steve said, voice even. “Guess not everyone is tough enough to hack it out here. Real shame.”
“Maybe Stíofán’ll let you have a turn when he’s done, share the loot,” another cackled and Stíofán could feel his shoulders tightening.
Tony still looked angry. “This is why I didn't want to tell you! Because I knew you’d get that stupid, stubborn look on your face and do something foolish. You dying in that impossible challenge will do nothing except hurt me and leave your kid without a sire.”
It was nice. Some nights they worked late into the night, spending more time messing around than working, and Tony found himself noticing
“Not at all.” Tony went to the front door, flipping the sign around and turning the lock. “Follow me.”
So he had claimed the first two dances, relishing every brush of the other man’s hand and enjoying the soft intimacy of the dancefloor. It was as though they were the only ones in the room, eyes never leaving the other. They twirled through the other dancers, parting only to be drawn back together as though they were tied together by a string. There would be talk of course, Tony could already see whispers behind a number of fans but he didn’t care. All he cared about was Mr Rogers' gaze on his, his smile, and the spark between them even if it was all on Tony’s part.
If Tony melted anymore he’d be a puddle. The man was so cute. He had the urge to maybe cuddle up, see if those arms looked as warm and safe as they seemed. But instead, he just gave Steve a smile and asked about the fair.
“Yes!” Maria said, way too enthusiastically for a first meeting. She was pretty sure she was blushing.
Steve’s hand came up to rest on his forehead, and his expression cleared, his shoulders relaxing. “Morning,” he rumbled.
Stíofán knew he ought to feel embarrassed. And maybe two years ago he would’ve. But losing his freedom had taken much of his ability to feel shame. He shrugged at the doe. “It is what it is.”
“Of course my love,” Stíofán said, feeling pleased. He liked that he could make Tony so desperate, so ready to take him however he chose to. It was heady but also humbling that his doe would trust Stíofán to take care of him. He loved it. He pushed in, a slow glide as Tony’s breath escaped in a sigh. They rocked together, in no rush, as the wind howled. Eventually Stíofán’s need grew too much to keep teasing and he shoved in hard making Tony squeak.
doing on da, da floor?” Tony mumbles, rubbing a hand over his face, trying to wipe the last ghostly remnants of his nightmare from his mind’s eye.
Tony listened to Jarvis’ summary as he left the Auditorium, down the hall and out the broken front door. He watched various images pop up on his screen, even as Steve said something to the S.H.I.E.L.D. officer by the chopper.
“Da!” Stíofán looked up to see Hugh and Peadar darting over, bouncing off fences while his Ma ran after them looking frustrated.
Obviously it was nice. There was something really reassuring about knowing your soulmate would love you from the get go. But at the same time, what kind of weirdo said ‘love you’ to a complete stranger?
“Melanie, David, Mrs Arbogast, Jonathan and Francis,” Pepper whispered in his ear, on the same wavelength as always. “They’ll need time to get down the stairs.”
He chased after him still too far away to stop him and watch as Peter flung his arms around the dog’s neck, so close to its mouth and for a second he had a horrible flash of what would happen if the dog wasn’t kid-friendly…
“Anthony, wait!” The alpha tried to follow him, but as he started forward, his balance failed him, and he fell sideways with a thump. There were hoots of laughter from inside, and the deputies came out to investigate.
He was rolled onto his back, Steve stripping off his remaining clothes and leaning back in to kiss him as he settled between his legs. He felt strong hands grab his thighs to hold them apart, and then Steve’s lips were gone from his, and there was a warm, wet mouth sucking at the curve of his groin. The mouth moved to his cock and sucked, making Tony whimper.
The ball of fluff unrolled itself, looking up at Tony with a yawn. Tony felt his heart melt. “Ohhhh, he’s so cute!”
The alpha ground his teeth. “Captain Rogers may have those fancy muscles from taxpayer dollars, but that doesn’t mean he can walk around like some bullheaded alpha with no idea how to treat people of good breeding.”
Tony squinted at him. “No, you’re not. You’ve been god knows where in that logic-driven brain of yours. And you have been for weeks!”
Steve waved the note. “Says here, ‘Please enjoy this picnic, free of charge, provided you enjoy it outside and take our delivery man with you for a whole afternoon. Signed,The Baking Boys.’”
He’d left Peter to draw, returning to stand vigil outside Mr Rogers’ quarters, awaiting verdict from the doctor. He wondered if he should send for Mr Rogers’ beau, if he might not find it a comfort to have him here. But the selfish part of him knew he could not, that it would hurt too much to see it.
He stepped them off to the side out of the way and spent the next two dances showing him the steps and getting him to keep his head up. By the third dance that rolled around, they were able to manage a rather passable two-step that was more fun than Tony had ever had at any of the stuffy parties he’d had to attend with his parents.
“Yeah.” Tony shrugged. “If you almost die for a plant that makes you its foster parent. I’m pretty sure that’s how it works.”
He could feel Steve’s cock through the thin breeches he wore and moved his hips invitingly until it coaxed a hearty groan.
It was a little bit of a blur if Tony was honest. It was just strange that half an hour ago he had been on the train being harassed by that horrid stranger, and now here he was, signing his new name on the marriage certificate for the clerk to file.
Clean and dry, he arranged his nightgown back into place and settled back under the covers. He waited for the Sheriff to return, hoping he might be able to fix it, but it wasn’t long before the sounds of the crickets and the trickle of the nearby stream lulled him to sleep.
“Yeah, well I hope you don’t mind, we showed the shelter I work at,”  Sam told him, sipping his own drink. “They were pretty excited. There are a few animals who struggle to adapt after an amputation and they’d love to talk to you about partnering up.”
“Let’s take lunch at the restaurant,” Steve suggested, and Tony was only too pleased to agree. They were ushered to a small table by the window, and Tony didn’t miss the look he was given by the omega serving them. She looked him up and down pretty clearly, taking in his clothes and shoes, and wrinkled her nose, only for a moment, but it was enough.
He missed them, and Pepper, and though there were nice folks here, it was still hard knowing many in the town still regarded him with disdain, especially when he compared it to back home, where he’d been admired as a prim and proper omega.
“Why sheriff, I think you’re a natural,” Tony proclaimed with a grin as they clapped the band at the end of the dance.
There was a soft touch to the side of his face, and Steve’s eyes nearly crossed to focus on...a small paw. “Hi there, girl.”
He felt a hand slip into his and he looked up to see Steve smiling at him. “Are you ready to see your new home, Mr Rogers?”
He felt a touch to his wrist and turned his head to see Pepper looking at him. He raised an eyebrow in question. She tilted her head to the side, and Tony followed it, seeing a door ajar. His heart started pounding. That hadn’t been open before. They must’ve left it open. If Tony and Pepper could distract the thugs guarding them, they could sneak a few people out. His brain was already running through the list, prioritising. They had at least three over sixty, including his P.A. Mrs Arbogast. Melanie from records was seven months pregnant. David in legal was a diabetic, and was already looking pale. If they could get them out, they could make it to the back exit, where hopefully the authorities were waiting.
“We've just been so tetchy with each other lately. I think Tony's been stressed about the baby thing again.“
Tony felt a wave of affection. “Thank you. I have struggled since her death to make sure I-- that he knows he is loved.” He gave an awkward smile. “Something that was somewhat less noticeable in my own childhood house.”
But people knowing would change things. He’d go from trustworthy Captain America to omega Steve Rogers, too unbalanced, too hormonal to lead. No one would follow him. So, letting people believe what they wanted to believe, their own biases working in his favor, didn’t seem like such a big deal.
Oh god. Oh fucking god. How had he managed to forget? Tony looked at his room, so innocent in the dark, but in the cold light of day absolutely
been and precious to boot. And here he was being brave and ready to make a fool of himself just to dance with Tony.
“Glad I could help,” Tony told him honestly. “And I appreciate you letting Alpine take part. It’s the first step to us being able to offer an affordable programme for people who are strapped for cash.” He handed his credit card to the bartender. “No four-legged friend should go without if they need it.”
“We’ll certainly appreciate it.” The doctor yawned. “Now I’m off to get forty winks, but you can take him home when you’re ready. He’ll need rest, and make sure he drinks plenty of water, but no reason he can’t do that out at the homestead. I’ll call by in a few days to check on him.”
A hand shot out to grab his, curling around his wrist, and tugged him forward. Tony went with it, looking up to see Steve looking worried. Steve pulled him against his chest, letting him lean against his uninjured side. “We’re ok. Don’t be upset now.”
“Thank the gods,” Stíofán breathed, resting his forehead against Peadar’s for a moment. “I thought he was really hurt.”
By the time the train pulled into the station, Tony’s insides were in knots. He’d been so focused on getting here that he’d hardly thought about what that would actually mean. Tony hurried to the lavatory to change. It wouldn’t do to meet his new alpha in travelling clothes.
Plus, it was hard to be mad when he could see the love and pride in Steve’s eyes from beneath the dark blue mask.
“I said, anyone who thinks that is a moron,” Steve repeated because he was a lot of things but a coward wasn’t one of them.
Tony raised a brow, looking bored. “Really, that’s all you’ve got? I’ll never work in this town again? Trust me when I say that doesn’t exactly leave me shaking in my Valentinos. You’re a dinosaur, Bradbury, and you wouldn’t even have bothered to come here if you didn’t need to buy respectability.” He looked at the shocked-looking omega. “No disrespect, of course, to the lady.”
“Yeah!” Sam said, looking pleased as punch over his panic. “We went to get her early. I didn’t realise her first experience was going to be seeing you plummeting out of the sky, but you know what maybe this is for the best. Prepare her early.”
“He looks dead,” Stíofán said, letting some of the rage from earlier deep into his voice. He dipped his head, ready to charge.
He felt the protective instinct rush up, and he stepped inside, his tone no nonsense. “What’s going on here?”
Had what he had done been enough? He scrambled over, his hands passing over Steve’s body as he checked for injuries. “Steve, are you--”
He wrapped the pie in a cloth and tucked it into a basket before darting off to get changed into his best for the dance. He put on his corset for the first time in a while. He didn’t usually bother when he was simply cleaning or mending, and he frowned as it hurt more than he remembered. Had it really been so long without it?
“I wouldn’t say no to a piece of pie,” Barnes offered. And Steve nodded, cutting the last of the pie in half, and offering the two absurdly large pieces to his men.
Tony tucked Jarvis’ belongings into his rucksack and slipped the bag onto his back, feeling the weight and nodding. “We can fly with this, no problem.”
This guy was outdated by even Steve’s standards. “Omegas can do anything alphas can do, and anyone who doesn’t know that is a moron.”
“You got me a calendar?” Tony asked with wide eyes and an even wider grin, pushing the wrapping paper off his lap as he pressed a kiss to Steve’s cheek. “That’s so sweet, babe.”
“I wouldn’t shun any help if I were you, you could use all the luck you can get,” Fury told him. “But that’s enough for now, enjoy the festivities.”
“I knew you’d be good at it,” Stíofán sighed, resting a hand in the thick hair. “Give it a good suck, yeah that’s--oh that’s good,
Steve turned his head just enough to give him a weak smile. A thin line of blood ran down the edge of his mouth. “Couldn’t let her take your kidney, could I?”
Tony wasn’t allowed a pistol yet, or to do any of the tricks he’d seen in shows back east, much to his displeasure and the Sheriff’s obvious amusement, but he was taught how to keep a gun maintained, how to shoot, and how to keep from hurting himself when the gun recoiled after one pulled the trigger.
That was...a little disappointing. But as he watched Bucky fishhook some guy with his prosthetic, while another grabbed Steve’s shirt dragging it over his head to trap him, Tony’s eyes were drawn to the...considerable assets beneath.
The saloon was a wave of noise and the smell of beer and tobacco. It was almost overwhelming, and Tony felt himself nearly gag on it. He scanned the room looking for anyone who could help when his eyes fell on a familiar blond head.
Always interrupting his lessons to lark about, and bringing him novels, and ensuring the cook made him the scones he liked for his luncheon. And the day before hadn’t helped.
Steve sighed, his shoulders slumping as he looked at the empty bottle in his hand. “I’m really bad at this, aren’t I? Maybe this is a bad idea.”
Peter hummed. “He took his refreshment with him. He said he was going for a walk and would return for our next lesson.”
This could be dangerous. Fury was clearly involved in a plot of some kind, the head of it if Stíofán had to guess, and asking such a favour could put him and Tony at risk.
But his designs came across his desk, and Tony inspected them with a curious eye. They were very good, really captured the essence of the products and had a humble, down-to-earth feeling to them that shiny, futuristic Stark tech didn’t usually have. Tony liked it.
“Rhodey, I still have that cake to bake for tomorrow. If it’s not done tonight I can’t ice it in the morning, and they need it for the party.”
extend to pool. He missed easy shots, and for the first two games knocked the eight ball into the pocket early with a curse.
The faun’s mouth moved as if to speak, but before any sound could be heard, the doe’s eyes went glassy and he collapsed to the floor.
His mother-in-law had also sent recipes for sponge cake and an apple pie upon hearing they’d gotten hitched, along with a lovely letter addressed to Tony, personally welcoming him to the family and telling him how excited she was to meet him when she returned to Brooklyn Junction.
It was simple: a far cry from the large house Tony had grown up in and those he had spent his life visiting. It included a small kitchen, though Tony could see care had been taken to store things in clever ways, a cosy little space for entertaining and staying warm by the fire, and a small table to dine at. There were some tasteful cushions and a nice throw, making it seem homely, which Tony liked.
They pushed open the door, a little bell ringing overhead. The shop was bustling, a few customers lined up while a man with a friendly smile greeted and served them. It was much friendlier than the town had been so far, and Tony found himself relaxing for the first time since they’d arrived. The smell of fresh bread and sugar was on the air, and he breathed in deep, the delicious smell making his stomach grumble.
S’Teve’s heart seemed to pound faster as he marvelled at the gesture. He met Tony’s gaze and realised he didn’t need to sense Tony’s emotions to see the hope in his eyes. He reached out, touching his own two fingers against Tony’s in the Vulcan way.
“Not everyone does, history’s biased against women, and women of colour especially. But she was rad as hell.” He ran a hand down the cat’s back and she trilled. “Now, can I help you at all? Maybe find you a book?”
Watching Tony flirt with some of the older ladies and making them giggle made something in Steve’s stomach feel hot, wishing he could get Tony to turn some of that attention on him.
He heard a chuckle, and then there was just sensation. Steve licked and sucked at the skin, dipping in his tongue and making Tony pant. The hands-on his thighs spread him wider and he was exposed, letting Steve get deeper and oh God it was good – it was so good.
“Thanks Mr Stark, I appreciate it. We couldn’t have afforded this if it weren’t for you offering clinical trials.”
He could feel a sharp spike of panic. Alphas could request divorces for lack of marital rights. What if the Sheriff decided that since he wasn’t any good at
“Maybe that would be ok,” Tony said, still sounding a little unsure. “And you’d come get us if he needed us?”
“I will, also I’ll let you know when I’ve set up my gaming stuff and we can try and beat the new level.”
It was embarrassing. He’d gotten his heat in public, which had never happened before. He’d draped himself all over poor Tony, who had been nothing but a gentleman despite being pawed at by an omega he didn’t like, who was acting like it was his first heat. Steve groaned, hiding his face in his hands.
For a moment Stíofán thought he’d made a mistake, that Tony would tell him they were convenient but nothing more. But instead, the doe nodded, head bobbing frantically. “Me too. I love you too.”
The one Hodge had grabbed nodded, rubbing at her arm. “I’m fine, thank you.” She looked up and her eyes widened in surprise. “Oh! Your Mr Rogers aren’t you? The Sheriff’s omega?”
Tony was moaning, already lost in it as Stíofán reached down to stroke him. The doe gasp at the touch, pushing his hips forward into Stíofán’s hand.
Then Tony got to watch a super hot guy impress his kid by getting Dodger to sit, roll over, shake hands and do a spin. This was not what he’d expected when he’d planned this outing.
It was easy, in fact, to forget what Steve’s job actually was, until it came rudely knocking at their door one morning.
Hearing Steve say it back to him was like being handed the whole world in his hands, and Tony didn’t think it was possible to be happier.
Brooklyn Junction was small, but it seemed to be fairly lively. There were a few shops, the saloon, a schoolhouse, the church and a few other buildings for things like the blacksmith and the butcher. All in all, it was pretty and very welcoming, if all the smiles they were getting from the townsfolk who tipped their hats to the sheriff were anything to go by.
“Perhaps that ought to wait until you’re a little better.” He grinned at the distinct pout of Steve’s lip. “Now, since you are bedridden, how about I fetch a book to--” that’s as far as he got before there was a thunder of footsteps in the hall, and Tony had but a moment to catch Peter before he flung himself on Steve’s injured ankle. “Peter! Be careful!”
“Yes. My Sire’s gone to Washington on business, and my Dame went with him to visit a friend of hers. They’ll be gone a few days, so it’s now or never.”
Eventually, Tony pulled away for air, letting his fingers brush over S’Teve’s ears, making him shiver.
Maria finished smoothing a poster against the wall. “Not bad right? I’m just putting a couple of things up, no point doing everything when I might have to move.”
“Huh,” Steve said, looking at Tony’s embarrassing craft project “You really liked me then, not just the shield?”
“Yeah. It’s for one of the charities we work with that uses our Medtech. It helps them, and it’s our last chance to build hype for the StarkScan before it goes live next month.”
Everyone knew. Everyone knew the sheriff didn’t want him like that, and that he wouldn’t be bringing any pups into the world.
“Oh, Sheriff, I’m glad to see you. I was wondering if-” Old Mrs Bonneville’s voice caught in his ear as he felt a spike of dread. No, no not now. He was late!
Generally, Stíofán was happier too. He felt less alone with Tony sharing his room, always there to speak to and sleep alongside. And well, to say nothing of their nightly activities, which Stíofán took to with gusto, like a starving man to food.
“You claimed to want to return home, Amora, do not think I do not know what it is you truly want. You want
He couldn’t stop the words before they had left him. After a two minute verbose tirade on the enigma that was Tony Stark to
A hero that’s going to get caught in the crosshairs of time and space? Well, color Tony informed, but the person he has in mind has technically already fallen into that category.
The second image, the one playing in a ten second loop, was in a smaller window than the other and the images flickered as the feed restarted.

“We both just care about your well-being, sir.” Jarvis pipes up and if he wasn’t a machine Tony would swear it was laughing at him.  “I will auto-program the armor to arrive straight to Stark Tower and lock it until another emergency is called in, sir.”
“They only wish to return to Asgard, for they know not that this corruption of land is simply society to you Midgardians. Somehow they slipped into a portal and brought here, they will stand down until they may return to their rightful territories.” Thor’s voice booms, carefully and a little bit hesitant but joyous nonetheless. Tony pauses for a second as he nears Peter’s signal. There’s an old Theatre that’s being covered by a tumbled over tree that’s on fire, the fire dancing across the log like a bunch of gypsies, far too big for a simple wood fire.
“Want me to check it out?” Clint calls out from the restroom where he was trying to wash off some of the dirt from the past week. “Sam, with me, I’ll work the signal, you work the mic?”
“Well, that is mighty odd…” Hank rubbed a furry claw over his blue chin and his upper lip curled up in a pensive snarl. “I will endeavor to take a gander into his physiological symptoms, if anything shows up I will send you word but I think perhaps a telepath would be better help in this situation.” Hank grinned, white teeth sharp in contrast to his form. “Still, the Professor went missing a few days back, a mishap in the danger room with one of the time-space shifting mutants and Frost is on loan to the British Government so it’s fine.”
They stay there, staring at each other for what feels like a lifetime before Tony clicks another piece back into the brace and Rhodey feels the pinching on the side of his leg slowly fade away.
“Hope you’re happy, if you don’t mind I think I’m going to and drink away the next hour. Sure as hell beats all of--” Tony ducks his head and motions towards the video streams. “It beats all of this.” He takes a deep breath, runs his had through his sweaty hair and turns, leaving before Steve has the chance to say anything.
"You idiot. You're an idiot, you know that?" Steve murmurs as he completely yanks down Tony's button up shirt and wraps it around the man's thigh, the shirt filling out in crimson quickly.
The building was vacated for ten years, Tony knows, and was condemned to be demolished for the following month.

The electrocardiogram is almost muted in the rush of blood in Fury's ears. It seems slow but steady, producing a beat from small electrode attachments on Tony's body. He seems paler than before, and Fury can't help but compare the pale, clammy memory of the poisoned man with the image of him at ease on the gurney. Tony's chest is wrapped in a crisp bandage slightly rusted with blood over his clavicle. The machines around, Fury realizes, are keeping the man nourished and hydrated. He wonders how long Tony has been here, forced to live. Forced back into another medical emergency.
, but there’s just something wrong. Steve’s so lost in thoughts he doesn’t notice that he’s literally
“I had… family,” she said, voice pitched low, “in… New York.” He inhales sharply. “I’ve been roaming since, you know. No home, no family… I just like knowing what else is out there. In case I’m blind sighted again.” The best lie was always wrapped in truth.
“King T’Challa,” Steve says as he catches up to the awed teammates gathered in front of the king, just outside of the landing ramp. “Thank you for receiving us, and for receiving me once more. It was quite our luck when you pinged us.” Steve dips his head once, respectfully.
They stayed until it got dark: Tony resting on Steve, while Steve watched over Peter. The pup moved a little from time to time, but he mostly slept, the red creeping up into his cheeks.
When people didn’t move fast enough, they were shoved, and Tony felt the anger flare up in his chest.
At the same time, he felt an odd sense of calm. Bucky was his friend, and a good man, and he’d see Tony’s pup to safety. He knew he would.
Tony sighed, but opened the till taking out the few bills inside. Steve muscles were tense with inaction. He could stop this. But if he did his cover might be blown.
“And well, she kept hanging around the bookshop and people kept asking if she was up for adoption and I thought, if people want to adopt her just from hanging out in the bookshop, maybe they’d consider adopting others. So I started fostering a few who were taking a while to get adopted, and then Rhodey had the bright idea that Cat Cafes were getting popular so we expanded. The shelter keeps us supplied with furbabies for adoption, and we help keep them from getting overrun. Plus we help socialise them and give people a chance to get to play with the cats they want to adopt. It works well.” He grinned. “Didn’t hurt business either - turns out book people are often cat people and when you offer them both, it’s hard to keep them away.”
They stood, both of them stretching. Steve marked his place in the book before setting it down. Now they would go to bed, and Tony felt himself suddenly quite awake. The night was not over after all.
They’d tracked the men they were chasing to a campsite on the other side of the ridge and were preparing for an ambush.
Peter cheered, and Steve gave him a peck on the head as they walked. He wondered if the proprietor Mrs Pym might also be kind enough to watch Peter for a few minutes.
“Understood.”  He tucked the gun away and gave Tony a smile. “Nice to meet you, Mr Rogers. Welcome to Brooklyn Junction. The name’s Sam Wilson.”
Tony shifted in his lap, rocking slowly at first, but apparently needing more soon enough. Their skin slapped together as Tony rode him, almost desperately, crying out when Steve used his leverage to meet him thrust for thrust.
He was pretty sure Tony was still mad at him, though now he didn’t know if it would be because he’d taken off without a word or because of their exchange a few days ago.
“He’ll be an outside dog, and he’ll need training, but hopefully he’ll be useful and keep the rats out of the barn.”
Stíofán leaned down to kiss him. “We have. You will have all the luxuries I can give you, I will wait on you hand and hoof. You shall want for nothing.”
The creature tugged at its chain, whining when it stayed fast and Stíofán realised he was looking at another soul, trapped and kept in a place far from home.
“Did you see what the prize was for the gladiatorial contest tomorrow?” One of the guards asked another, as they walked past Stíofán’s room.
Pepper sighed, walking around the bed to put her hand on his and wrapping her fingers around his. She took the silk waistcoat from him, shook it out and refolded it, her hand smoothing over the soft material before she tucked it into the bag.
Tiberius scowled. “That’s simply because Fury knows my worth. He would not risk me being used for anything but the most prestigious fights.”
“Yes Papa,” Peter replied, making one of the dolls walk across the small stage. “If he is not too busy making his eyes all big at you.” He brought his hands up to his face and uncurled them, miming big eyes.
Eventually they swung by the Sheriff’s Office so Steve could show Tony where he worked. He pushed open the door, and then there was a low whistle.
Oh good god no. This could not be happening. This was easily the most mortifying experience of his life, and yet, Steve was staring at him with a hopeful expression and Tony found himself tongue tied.
“I thought you were meant to be a pillar of the community. I can’t believe it turns out I’ve taken up with a common coffee boiler who’s so quick to shirk his duties.”
“I’m sure that’s not true. Maybe you just haven’t found your thing yet. And that’s ok. You just need time.”
and a photo of one of Tony’s high school friends and another woman, faces pressed together with both of them holding lit matches.
Tony waved a dismissive hand. “He’s a historical figure from eighteenth-century Earth, known for his romantic pursuits.”
“I haven’t seen you so smitten with someone you just met in a long time,” Jan remarked, sipping her wine. “You need to get out more.”
“We have a spare room out there.” He pointed to a building out in the backyard. “Bottom floor is bakery storage but the top floor is empty. There’s some spare furniture up there we could clean up for you, including a bed.”
Steve took a deep breath and let it out. “You’re right, I’m sorry.” He got to his feet. “I’m going to beat Hodge to a pulp.” And then he threw himself down the steep canyon wall, sliding to the bottom.
“Yeah, I realised when I got back from my tour I hadn’t really spent much time anywhere but New York, so I figured, why not? Packed a bag, gassed up my bike, and hit the road.”
He could feel the doe’s tail wagging against his crotch, the sign that his body was ready and Stíofán groaned. The doe shifted slightly, and his curly locks brushed Stíofán’s nipples, the sensation against his bare chest just pushing him higher.
“Oh Tony,” Steve moaned, and Tony couldn’t help but preen. “You feel so good, so hot and tight.” He thrust a few more times, before pulling out and patting Tony’s leg soothingly at his whine. “Turn over sweetheart, come on.”
Mr Rogers stepped closer too, perhaps the sound of the room making itself known. “I am lucky to have come to Starlight Estate. Teaching Peter is a joy, and one I am happy to have been given the opportunity to have. And of course, the house holds other distractions, ones that perhaps I should not desire as much as I do, but I find I cannot help it. I’m not sure I can--”
“So did I. But I miss the tiny hooves, waiting for their first horns to come in. The kids are old enough now that they don’t need as much watching and if you’re carrying soon, they’ll be just in time for next spring.”
“Yup,” Tony replied, popping the ‘p’. “Sure is. Well, you have your delivery, so I’m just gonna--” He threw a thumb over his shoulder trying to seem nonchalant, but pretty sure he was overreaching and hitting super awkward instead. “So ummm...bye.”
Tony tried to nod, to reassure his alpha, but instead he felt the tears trickle over and brought up his hand to wipe them away.
“At least this time I will be cosy and not on the back of that horrid donkey or being mounted in the wilds by some savage,” Tony said with a yawn. “I will have a nice bed and nice things to eat.”
He remembered the moment he realised what the feeling in his chest was, and it brought him warmth to recall it even now. He and Peter had been taking lessons outdoors, sketching birds in the woodland near the house. He’d heard someone curse loudly, and quickly dropped his sketchbook as Peter had darted off to see the source.
He figured he’d have to throw the match to get Steve in his bed, but instead, Steve made every shot with frightening accuracy.
Tony watched curiously as Rhodey walked to the door, unlocking it and letting in— oh! The guy from yesterday, the one who had stormed off when Tony had helped him out. Tony could feel the scowl spreading over his face as the man stepped inside.
But it was ridiculous. He was a tutor, Mr Stark was the son of a lord, and having any thought other than that the man was an annoyance was dangerous.
“It didn’t feel like that to me though,” Steve said, sounding uncertain. “It felt like you didn’t think my job was important, that yours was the only one that mattered.”
“Hi!” A voice called from somewhere inside the shop, though no matter how much Steve ducked and squinted he couldn’t see the source. He wandered in further, his eyes sweeping over the tacky junk littering the place.
Sam took a gulp of beer, nodding. “Honestly, I don’t think there was a right way. They’re going to miss you two regardless of which colleges you went to. Classic empty nest.”
He made a confused sound, louder than he intended, and Steve shot up, looking around for a threat before his worried eyes landed on Tony.
Steve took the seat next to Tony, gently rubbing his shoulder. “You did good in there. Not everyone would’ve handled themselves as well as you did.”
“Dad’s freaking out,” she admitted. “In a very Dad way. He keeps jumping between impulse buying everything marked ‘for college students’ to getting all misty-eyed when he looks at our baby photos.”
“Thank you,” he murmured, and he felt Tony nod, a rather sobbish sounding noise coming from his collarbone.
“Baaaaaaa,” Antonius bleated, the sound rushing out in a gasp, and Stíofán’s chest roared with triumph.
“Depends on what Sam says. He said he’d message me when he knew more.” He pulled out his phone, realising there was a notification. “Oh that must be him.”
When he let him go, Tony looked a little dazed but shook it off. As the doe made his way back through the gate, Stíofán watched the fine rump bounce beneath the warm woollen shift he wore, fastened at the front, Stíofán knew, with the brooch he’d had made for him when the twins were born. He watched till Tony was out of sight, thinking about how the twins would curl up by the fire in their roundhouse later and he and Tony could retire to their soft bed, curled up beneath the furs. If he was lucky, his hand would wander and Tony would press into them, eager as they moved together, trying to stay quiet…
The man in question wiped tears from his eyes and snorted. “Like hell, I didn’t. Trust Stevie to finally get with his omega and not be able to control himself. What would you have done if the Pastor had come in here? He’d never look at you again without clutching his rosary.” He looked to Tony. “No disrespect meant to you, of course, Mr Rogers.”
“Here are your briefing documents. We’ll be landing in Los Angeles within the hour, and what you’ll find there is a little...odd.” Coulson gave him a look. “It’s a giant gelatinous blob.”
“I didn’t expect to see you so soon Sheriff,” the man remarked, an amused grin on his face. “Most new couples wouldn’t come up for air for a few days.”
The moment of distraction was just enough for Tony to miss the gust of wind, only realising after it hit, spinning them off course.
Tony flopped onto a stool with a huff. “I don’t think I’ve worked this hard in my life. Dad’s shop had more orders and pickups when I did shifts there.”
They were dressed head to toe in black, combat uniforms with a strange symbol on the sleeve. Tony squinted at it.
A recipe from his mother-in-law was a fine first step. “That would be lovely.” Wait, had the Sheriff said ‘write her for it’? “She doesn’t live here?”
Stíofán snatched the kid up mid-bounce and held him tightly. “I don’t care what you had to show me, you say sorry for making her chase you.”
He got his nicest nightgown laid on the bed, and stripped carefully placing the other clothes aside.
There was no time for style, just speed, but even as he flew back towards the lights of the town, he could smell the heavy scent of the rain and feel the chill at his back. It wasn’t long before he felt the first splash on the back of his neck, and then it came flooding down.
Peter nodded, his face alight with responsibility.  “I can Papa, I can. Can I make Mr Rogers something to make him feel better? I have been practicing my sketches.”
Maria leaned into the hug, wrapping her arm around her dad and clutching him tightly. “Both my babies are heading to California.”
Pain shot through his thigh and hip as they hit the ground, but by some luck the earth had absorbed enough of the rain to become soft, creating enough give that they slid through the mud, coming to a halt as they hit the back fence.
Her dad was breathing a little easier now and he looked at her with a grin. “Course she got in. They would’ve been stupid not to.”
There was no time to react before Steve was tugged away, mouthing ‘sorry’ at them before he disappeared into the crowd.
Her anger turned to shock, and she turned to look at the man next to her. He took one look at them and tried to bolt, but Steve was faster. As the guy flew past them, his hand snapped out, grabbing him by the collar and throwing him on his back. “Son, just don’t.”
Stíofán could see the sense in that. Wouldn’t do for a matron to embarrass their alpha during an important meal or at the baths. But well, for Stíofán it was hardly more than an odd novelty.
“Alright, we have soda, chips and I got you some candy,” J.J announced walking back in with Pops in tow. He dropped the bag on the dresser, taking in the changes since they’d been gone. “Oh wow. Nice.”
From then on, he knew from Jarvis that the soldier called by the estate to visit with some regularity. Tony never saw him. He found himself taken into town for business, or out inspecting the estate whenever Jarvis informed him of the soldier’s arrival. He may have accepted his heartbreak, but that didn’t mean he was up to the task of basking in it in his own home.
“Don’t even start. Jarvis projected an article onto the front lawn about how Johns Hopkins is still the best-rated medical school and wouldn’t take it down until I read it. Neither one of them would admit who did it but my money’s on Dad with Pops covering for him.”
“And then it’s just me in the emergency room having to wait while he--” Tony cut himself off, trying to stop the memory filling his head as it had so often and knowing at the same time that he was being unfair, and Steve didn’t deserve it. “Sorry.”
“Get out,” he growled, his voice low and dangerous. “And if you come near him again, I’ll make you a
“Yeah, and trust me when I say I’m proud as punch. Several of the onlookers said you used magic for crying out loud, which I think might be an exaggeration, but realising it was you under that thing nearly scared me to death.”
“Did you wake me just to brag? Because if you did I hate you,” Rhodey grumped, and Tony flapped a hand he couldn’t see.
