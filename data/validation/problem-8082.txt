“Thank you,” Wanda said.
He emerged later that night after testing out the comms with the younger Natasha. He wanted to make her feel included in the mission. That was something Steve really appreciated about his new side of Tony he was witnessing. Not only was he adamant about keeping her out of harm’s way—something he wholly agreed with—but he even saw the genius go the extra mile and make sure he stayed connected to her; he made sure she knew that they were all right and let her assist them in any way they needed. Steve liked that Tony didn’t just dismiss her, that he cared about her feelings and had the foresight to recognise she may be worried or feeling lost, not knowing what was going on. It was…well, Steve wouldn’t say
They stayed in the lab for the rest of the day, trying to figure out what to do, until Steve called them away for dinner.
"Right. Because you and Steve are married."
Steve nodded. “You’re not alone in my world, Tony. You’ve got a great group of friends who have your back. If you’re worried you’re like your father, you’re nothing like him. Trust me.”
reference. This general guy on the colony Tarsus IV did the same thing after most of their crops were destroyed by a fungus. So he rounded up half the population and murdered them so the rest of the population wouldn’t starve to death.”
“I’m aware.”
“Get this, Thor said his father had the gauntlet in his weapons room, because it belonged to his father, Odin. His mother’s bedtime story was their own history. Odin built the gauntlet and tried to seize the power of the stones once a long time ago and it didn’t go as planned. His second in command tried to steal the power from him, and he sealed her in the underworld and made the nine realms forget she ever existed.”
Wanda opened her mouth to respond when Clint called out to them. “Guys, there’s nothing we can do about this situation tonight. We probably shouldn’t mess with anything until FRIDAY says we can. We should just watch a movie or something instead.”
“I don’t know who that is, either. The director is Pierce.”
Tony found himself back down in the lab, then. He knew fairly well how everything worked down there. His own lab had HUD screens and holograms and graphics, that was the norm in his world, but he didn't know about this whole AI business, or whatever JARVIS had been.
“Heimdall!” he boomed. “Might I have words with you?” he asked.
Once they reached the space, the other members looked back at them as the elevator dinged and they all stepped out.
“Peggy?” Steve whispered.
It did come as somewhat of a shock to Thor that, as promised, the next day Loki did give him the stone. Thor had woken up that morning, had a breakfast feast in the hall as he caught up with his friends. He kept an eye out for those coming and going in the hall, but Loki was absent entirely. After breakfast, he took the time to walk around Asgard, visit its people and its shops to see what had changed since he’d last encountered them.
“Hey, kid,” Tony said quietly behind her. Natasha’s breath shuddered and tears started to spill over her cheeks as she turned to look at him.
“Great,” Natasha said. “So he’ll be on his way to Earth to retrieve the stones. He must have some way to tell where the stones are?”
"Coffee?" He asked.
With a sigh, Tony plopped down on the couch right next to Steve and sank deep into the cushions. Steve handed him the plate of pasta he made, and Tony dug right into it. Steve noted the way his eyes turned to glance at Natasha and Clint drinking his beer, but how Tony didn’t indulge himself. Curious, for Tony to be completely sober. Steve wondered if he’d ever seen a truly sober Tony in all the years he’d known him. There was a first for everything, wasn’t there?
“Which means you’re not gonna listen to anything I say and you’re gonna continue to suffer in silence.”
“What if this is our last night alive?” Clint asked. “I mean, the world can’t end tomorrow, can it? I can’t die without having sex one last time.”
"Hi, Tony," she said, not looking up from a file she was reading.
“16 hours. FRIDAY alerted us when there was a surge of energy from the stone and showed us footage of you disappearing. You went to the other universe didn’t you?”
"Promise."
getting involved with Alexander Pierce and killing people.”
"Uh, their dad's dead on our world."
"Ugh," Tony heard from the stairs. "You guys are so gross!" Natasha complained. She walked into the kitchen, ruffled her younger brother's hair, and opened the fridge and got out the carton of orange juice. "Pancake day?" she asked Tony.
"Yeah, bud?"
“The doctor said he had some internal bleeding, but that’s under control,” Peggy told him. “His arm was badly crushed and there’s a chance of some brain swelling, both of which they're keeping an eye on. Only time will tell.”
needed a drink. “Yeah, I wouldn’t know the first thing about how to discipline a fucking teenaged girl. Right, so back on Steve. What does he do?”
She gathered her purse from where she left it and ran out the warehouse doors in the direction Matt had walked off at.
She inserted the key to her front door into the lock and flicked on the foyer lights, her hand going straight to her gun when she saw someone sitting on her couch.
Foggy had texted her and said he was on his way to drop Matt off and there were knots in her stomach. She'd drank three cups of coffee and both her hands and her legs were shaking with her nerves. Tony was glancing at her, trying not to laugh, and Steve was trying to calm her down and tell her that it was going to be all right.
“Right.  Can we torment your younger self, Nat?” Clint asked.
“Wanting to survive doesn’t make you a bad person, Loki.”
Alias: Iron Man
"Good day?" he asked his husband. Steve looked exhausted.
“Uh, no, but I know we’re married in this universe. Which is cool. I’m not homophobic or anything.”
Tony looked up at him, then, seeing Steve's eyes full of longing for the other woman.
“Do you know where these stones are located? We are afraid a Titan named Thanos is planning to wield them for evil purposes.”
Tony shrugged. “Yeah, why not? We’re all on the same side here, want the best for Vision, so on and so forth. No need to argue about it.”
Matt huffed. “This isn’t what I signed up for.”
Steve smiled at him crookedly. "Yeah, it's me. You were having another nightmare. You all right there?"
“I have my sources,” Thor told him. “He’s after the infinity stones.”
“We won’t let it come to that! Please, Nat, do this for me. It’s the only thing I’ll ever ask of you again. This is me cashing in the debt you owe me. Please.”
together.
“I don’t know how to deal with having a family. I’m not….it’s not something I’m used to.”
“What did you do?” Thor asked. “What magic have you meddled with, Man of Iron?”
“No offense taken, Mr Stark,” FRIDAY said.
“Tony’s not heartless,” she said. “He’s not half bad when he’s acting like a decent human being.”
Steve grunted, wiping the sleep out of his eyes. He jumped up, made his bed meticulously, and then dressed in his superhero costume, gathering his shield as he headed out the door.
"It's okay. Not my first time smelling it. What's up? Karen said you just took off?"
The two lapsed into silence again as Tony kept driving to Loki’s magic shop. He pulled in and killed the engine, took in a shuddering breath.
“Do I know any of them? Just rattle off some names and I’ll see if I know any of them in my world.”
“I…” Steve started. “Is it okay if I control the time stone?” He looked at it a little wistfully.
“Or we can see if this plan works, then we can use the time stone to go back before he murdered Natasha, do it all over again, and then call Fury so he can decide what we do with him.”
Genuine concern flashed on Loki’s face. Steve guessed he wasn’t so bad here, after all.
"I told her you were too afraid to ask if they were using protection."
"Well, tell Aunt Peggy I'm fine."
"Yeah!" Bucky shouted.
Tony shook his head. “Figured Howard would be horrible in more than one universe. But you and your brother…you’re still intact, right? I mean, Steve and I didn’t royally fuck up or anything did we?”
“Huh. Didn’t know the guy knew anything about art. And…you? Like, you go to school and stuff?”
Thor clearly caught Loki off guard, as shock was evident in Loki’s eyes, the green of his magic receding into his clear blue.
Tony cleared his throat. "Uh, yeah."
“Do your dads know what’s going on?” Tony asked her, not even bothering to let go of her, even though the other Avengers were in different state of either awe at his affection or awkwardly trying to look away from the intimacy of the scene.
“Whoah, hey, someone’s a little trigger happy,” the person said, standing up to face her.
"Since when did you care? You made me CEO of your company for a reason. I do all the dirty work and you show up when I tell you to and sign whatever I put in front of you without asking."
“Yep, still superheroing. Put a ring on Pepper’s finger, got married. Took this kid Peter under my wing, met the king of Wakanda, and hung out with some more aliens other than Thor.”
Current Whereabouts: S.H.I.E.L.D Headquarters
Tony swallowed. "So that world, with them, it isn't real?"
Natasha didn’t go home to her own world immediately after the battle with Thanos was over. She and the others took about a week to decompress from the fight and to heal their injuries and psyches. Natasha hadn’t had a huge role in the defeating the Titan—Tony had stayed firm on her not being able to fight—but she was on their comms system the entire time, and FRIDAY had been showing her the footage from inside Tony’s Iron Man helmet, so it was basically like she was in the field with them. She wished she could have done more, but she was also glad Tony wanted her safe enough to be able to go home to her own dads.
"No problem, Big Guy."
“Clint, I don’t think we
Tony snorted. "Sam is Bucky's best friend from pre-school."
Before Tony could really catch his breath after Thanos’s super punch, the fist with the gauntlet slammed right into his jaw and he was back on the ground, struggling to get back up.
“Sure. Have fun. Text us to make sure you’re not dead and come home on curfew.”
“Nat! I’m not discussing this with you! You’re sitting out! Please!”
Steve nodded. “Right. Home field advantage. It’s always easier fighting on your own turf. You have enough energy to control the stone on your own?”
“Okay, so what does this Thanos want, exactly?” Wanda interjected. “What are these infinity stones?”
Steve frowned. “No. I don’t think so.”
“I actually did the research,” Clint chimed in.
“I guess.” Tony didn’t sound convinced.
"I built my own tower," Tony repeated slowly. "I don't have a house?"
"I guess, dude. I guess anything's possible. Anyway, Pepper sent me down here. She wants to talk to you about something. Wouldn't tell me what."
“Geez,” Natasha said. “The other version of my dad said you were bigger from the super soldier serum, but this is
After she’d showered and changed into pyjamas, she went downstairs and sat on the couch next to Tony, who was watching the news. “How long was I gone?” she asked.
“Oh, no, Tony, is there anything I can do to help?”
Jane sighed in relief. "Yes!"
Tony sighed heavily. “Nat, what if I am myself around them and they don’t like me? Okay, not just Steve, but the rest of the team? What if they only like me because I can buy them cool things and make them cool weapons and give them a cool place to live? What if I’m completely myself with them and they decide they hate who I am?”
“How does one access their power?” Tony cut in.
"So you're telling me Steve and Tony are actually married in some other world where none of us are superheroes?" Clint asked. "This is like the perfect plot for a fanfiction. I wonder if anyone's ever thought of his before."
“No, they banished me from the hospital. I’ve been a wreck since it happened and I haven’t left his side or slept in three days and they all told me I had to go home and shower and get just a couple hours of sleep. But Pepper, I can’t get ahold of Steve and it’s freaking me out and my kid’s in the fucking hospital, I don’t know how they can expect me to just sleep!”
Tony blinked. “So?”
"Yep. One who's not having sex with her boyfriend," Tony revealed.
Tony grinned at him. “Maybe.”
"Yeah, about that," Clint said. "Do I exist in this other world of yours? I'm not some like, circus freak or some crazy assassin or something, am I?"
Eventually, he reached the decision.
Wade spluttered. "Ex-squeeze me? I was educating your boyfriend in some very important, no girls allowed, business."
“Reckless. Who disregards rules. Who shoots gun and shoots people and gets the government to cover it up for her.”
“Holy shit,” Clint said, laughing. “Nat, is that you?”
Aunt Peggy, who wasn't really her aunt, grew up with her dad. Her family practically adopted him after his mother died and they had been best friends ever since.
Steve didn’t know why he brought his art supplies with him. He hadn’t had need of it for a long time. He started to draw when he first woke up from the ice, but this future, these people…it left his passionless. Out of ideas. He hadn’t drawn since that day he teamed up with the Avengers.
"Really?" Bucky asked, eyes still wide, a huge grin on his small face. "Okay!" He bounced back off the bed and ran to his room next door. Tony and Steve, now alone, kissed each other softly before both sliding out of bed and getting ready for the day.
All things considered, luck really was on their side. Natasha wished this Shuri girl, Wanda’s connection, was somewhere in her universe. She though they would make good friends.
Clint held up his quiver. “Yes, ma’am. I’ll have eyes on you all night. If anything goes wrong, I’ll step in.”
The wheels of Tony’s chair scraped against the floor of his lap as he turned around in it to face Steve. “Good idea, Capsicle. You wanna go to the library and research old books that might have information? Take the redhead with you. She likes research.”
“Okay. But then what was your Tony supposed to learn? How to not be a dick?”
“Oh for the love of…”
“You have pretty great parents, huh?”
Steve sighed. “Yeah, but his family’s not. This sounds like something that his family might have done. His father once stripped Thor of all his powers and sent him to Earth just to teach him a lesson. Maybe someone is trying to teach us a lesson.”
“The purple stone holds the power to control space, while the green one is the soul stone, and the orange one controls time.”
Pepper heaved a huge sigh. She sounded so tired, like she had been through his with him before many times over the years. "I swear to God if you created something else that's going to take over the world, or if you fucked with Steve or the rest of the Avengers again I will leave this tower, Tony, and I won't come back!"
“You’re sweet.”
“Yeah,” Tony said quietly. Steve just nodded.
Steve scoffed. "That's a bit hypocritical, don't you think? You can't even love yourself."
"Mm, no, but I'm hungover. I might smell like whisky today. You might wanna stay away."
Clint easily found his way up high and out of view of the charity goers, able to look over everything going on without a hitch. He had studied the blueprints of the venue beforehand, knowing exactly where all the air vents and rafters were to keep him out of view. Clint liked high places. Almost as much as he liked his bow. And Pietro’s stupid smirk and sexy accent, but that was beside the point. Clint was good at seeing things from a distance. His hearing was shit, but his eyes and his target were good. And that’s all that mattered tonight.
“Yeah, you can come.”
“FRIDAY, do you want to ask Clint what his opinion is?”
“Yeah, you bet,” he said.
“It feels the same as Vision,” she said. “I think all of the stones have a certain mystical energy, a signature, to them.”
(d'yavol)."
“No pressure at all,” Steve murmured. “Yes, I can do it.”
She glared at him. “I’m 17.”
“Are we really doing this?” Steve asked. “Can you do it without harming him?”
“You leave a girl behind in the 40s?”
“You’re disgusting,” she shot back. He pretended to pout.
"Catholic, huh?"
Parents Names:
“I was adopted after my parents were murdered in Russia. I was kind of a problem child for a while, but you and Daddy changed that. I mean, Bucky and I both came from shitty backgrounds, and you helped us.”
Except that's not the sleep that Tony got. He tossed and turned, and when he finally did find his way into REM, it was fraught with nightmares about the world burning. There was chaos and smoke and he was left standing alone in the middle of a smouldering circle, watching the world fall away before his very eyes.
“And the Loki from your universe couldn’t have started it?” There was fire in Tony’s eyes now.
"I'll be there. I'll get Foggy to drive me over."
Tony looked back at Steve to see how he was processing Natasha as their daughter and a young Bucky hooked up to tubes, lying in a coma in the hospital bed. Steve was doing neither, though. He was frozen in the doorway, face ashen, just
“No shit?”
Parents Names:
“That’s awesome, Nat.”
I intended to post this sooner, but I watched Avengers: Endgame and never fully recovered, so there's that. I hope you all enjoyed the movie and if you haven't seen it, you're living your best spoiler free life.
“Is there a difference?”
"Promise?"
“Tony, come on,” Steve said, pleading with him.
"Pietro just recently died, Tony," Natasha informed him. "He got shot protecting Clint."
Siblings and Other Family:
“No,” Clint admitted.
"Essentially," Jane said, "other worlds exist. And somehow Tony cracked the secret of travelling between them. This isn't science fiction anymore. It's real."
"Promise?" Bucky asked.
want me dead.”
"You do. The old Stark mansion. But that's in Malibu. Here in New York you just have the tower."
Thanos snapped his fingers again and suddenly Tony was back in Avengers tower. He noticed just like last encounter that no time had passed.
Any bravado Loki had had disappeared at the mention of the Titan’s name, leaving Loki pale and nervous. “Where did you hear that name?” he hissed, grabbing Thor by his red cape and pulling him into his chambers. He closed and locked the door behind him.
“But what if they don’t, Tony? I mean, aren’t you lonely? You’ve kept yourself separate from the world for your whole life. You’ve never completely opened up to anyone before. So you say Rhodey loves you for who you are, but he’s gone in the Air Force all the time and isn’t always there when you need him. You have Pepper, but she’s your girlfriend, not a platonic friend. Don’t you want friends? Don’t you want those people who are always going to have your back? A support system?”
But apparently he wasn't gay in this universe. And apparently aliens existed. And his daughter was bred to be an assassin in love with Steve Rogers’s childhood best friend, who was her younger brother in their world.
“Barbara Gordon from Batman comics,” Steve whispered to him. He winked at Natasha. “Great codename for the field. See you on the comms, Oracle.”
“And why not?” Loki asked.
He wasn't too keen on telling the group about his other life on this other earth. But then again, maybe they wouldn't be interested in the specifics. Oh, who was he kidding. They were a group of superheroes, of course they were going to be curious. They always needed details after everything was said and done.
“Two months, give or take,” Tony informed her. “I called your school and told them about Bucky and requested your teachers give you work to take home while you’re on a hiatus, so you didn’t miss much.”
Natasha didn’t think so, but she didn’t comment further. She waited to see how the fight was going to pan out. She had confidence in the Avengers. After all, it was all of them plus the stones against one alien. He hadn’t brought backup. He was alone. And it wasn’t like all those stupid action movies where the good guy was teamed up against like ten bad guys and he defeats them all because they all came at him one by one, allowing him to effectively win. All of the bad guys would be descending upon Thanos all at once. In what universe did he think he was going to win?
"Group home, actually. And yes, Natasha still has red hair and she's still Russian."
? Thor felt bile rise in his throat at the thought. He would have to seek council with his father after the war with Thanos and demand some answers for himself.
Tony lowered his face plate again and sucked in a huge breath. “We got this, right, Spangles?”
“And this was a bedtime story your mom told you?”
"Yes, Friend Tony?"
“You know, when you met Daddy, you hadn’t ever had a nuclear family situation, either. I don’t know what it was like for you, but Grandpa Howard wasn’t a nice guy. Not that I would know, because he died before I was born, but I can hear you guys talking sometimes. About how scared you were to be parents, because you thought you’d turn out just like them. How you were convinced you all were going to screw me and Bucky up. But you got past that fear, and hey, I think you guys did a good job.”
"Mmm, probably to yell at me some more about endangering myself and almost dying in order to save the world. Again."
Steve chewed his lip for a minute, debating about whether to speak up or not, and decided it was worth it to bring it up. “Do we know what will happen if we destroy all of the stones so no one else tries to wield their power? The universe created them for a reason. If we get rid of all of them, will it have lasting consequences?”
"It's a complicated math procedure that no one uses or has a need for."
Thor shook his head and held up his hammer. “I have Mjolnir. I do not need a stone to wield.”
“Okay. Good luck, then. We’ll see you when you get back, I guess?”
She approached Clint, who was tossing rocks up in the air, waiting for her. "What do you want, птичка
“We won’t get murdered.”
before Steve declared it bath time. Bucky pouted, but Steve promised to read him an extra bedtime story and all was forgiven. He let Steve give Bucky a bath while he cleaned up the kitchen and turned off all the lights.
"You've never even met him."
"You remember JARVIS?" Jane asked.
“No,” he said again.
Steve closed his eyes as a strange emotion Tony couldn’t place played on his face. “The universe demands balance,” he said.
“Right. You know that dude is a tough nut to crack, right? I mean, he’s disgustingly loyal to Fisk. I’m not exactly sure how you’re gonna get him to confess any information, but I guess if anyone can do it, you can.”
Tony sighed. “It’s a
“Pepper texted to say he hasn’t woken up yet. Natasha finally fell asleep. She said to take your time.”
Tony shrugged. “Sure. Until I build a machine that lets me jump into the multiverse and visit different worlds. I’m gonna miss you, and I’m not ready to say goodbye.”
Natasha bit her lip. “To be honest, I haven’t really had any time to think about it. There was…an accident.”
Tony looked at all of their confused and shocked faces. "Well I couldn't live here not knowing all the differences, okay? I have files on all of you I stole from S.H.I.E.L.D. down in my lab."
“Does anyone even know the real Tony Stark?”
Tony arched an eyebrow at her over the console. “You’re the one who gave the formula. Why don’t you ask your source if it’s legit? Far as I can tell, all the calculations are perfect. Don’t worry your pretty head, little witch, your robot boyfriend will be good as new in no time at all.”
The personality transplant jarred Tony, but he thought he liked it. Albeit, the fact Steve was so goddamned happy all the time would probably start to grate on his nerves before long, and then they would be back to bickering nonstop like they always did. But still, it was a vast improvement from the holier than thou version he currently had in his home world.
“You don’t understand, Nat. I can’t breathe without you. Do you get that? There’s been so much shit in my life. So much hurt. I’m not a good person. But you make me believe I can be. You’re the only one who’s ever believed in me, the real me. Who’s ever understood me the way I need to be understood. You’re my best friend. I don’t know how to go through life without you.”
Rhodey shook his head. "Alternate universes? Man, that's way too science fiction for me, Tony. Come on, things like that don't exist."
Birthday: July 4, 1918
He and Steve exited the car and entered the door, listened to the chimes as they entered. Tony headed straight to the check out counter to see Loki while Steve hung out, pretended to browse around. This was Tony’s world. Best to let him do his thing while Steve offered support if he needed it.
“Hey, kid, you’re all the comms with all of us.”
Natasha's fork clanked against the plate as she put it down, looking up at him. "I guess," she said. "As much as I can be friends with anyone."
Sidenote: the colours associated with the infinity gems/stones vary from comic to comic and are also different in the MCU. In the comics, it’s more common that the reality stone is yellow, however in MCU it’s the red stone (aka the Aether). This means that logically the reality stone should be the one in Knowhere with the Collector, but as I gave the reality stone to Tony & Co. and since at the time of writing this no one knew where the last stone was, I made the last stone be the one Thor gave to the Collector. And on a further note, I didn’t include Dr Strange or the Guardians in this story, so one of these stones is collected by the Avengers and another is collected by Thanos. So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.
Natasha huffed. "I'm on the phone."
Tony peered at it, then grabbed the yellow stone from Steve’s hands aggressively, turning it over and over in the palm of his hand. “I know this,” he said. “Loki sells this in his store. He sells more like it, in different colours. They all do different things, or so he claims. I don’t remember what yellow represented but…this is definitely the stone from his store. An Infinity Stone, I think he called it.”
“That’s so cool!”
"We could ask JARVIS!" Thor boomed.

Steve turned to look in the direction of Wanda and Vision. They were seemingly wrapped up in their own little world, whispering together, hands clasped tightly, unaware of what anyone else in the room was doing. He missed that. He wondered if he’d ever have that again. He swallowed the lump in his throat.
"Okay. See you in a little bit."
Loki pursed his lips in thought for a moment. “I think not, brother. I would much rather stay here and rule Asgard than fight the man I once aligned myself with. But I wish you and your Avengers well in this war. And know if you win, you are welcome back in Asgard as long as you choose.”
Tony nodded. "For a few months now, yeah."
Tony noticed this, concerned. “Steve, you can’t use it for anything other than defeating Thanos, do you hear me? I know you wish you could go back in time, see Peggy, maybe save Bucky, but you can’t do it. That messes with the whole space time continuum and it’s generally frowned upon in literally every science fiction thing ever.”
“Okay. Good to know. Anyone else?”
Frank Castle's family was slaughtered by the mob when he was a kid and grew up with a lot of anger issues. The entire school was afraid of him, except Natasha, who welcomed him into their group with open arms.
And well, then there's Matthew Murdock, son of boxer Battlin' Jack Murdock, murdered after a bad boxing match. He'd never met his mother and spent every year since he was 10 living in an orphanage run by nuns.
“…Yeah? I work at his magic shop?”
Natasha nodded, slumping her shoulders. “Yeah. I get it.”
"But I exist?"
“Pardon?” Peggy asked.
“Uh, except for you, Natasha. The younger Natasha,” Tony said.
When he was done cleaning up, Tony decided he was going to explore the rest of his house, or mansion or tower or whatever Jane and Thor had called it last night. He had only seen the lab and his bedroom and kitchen space, which wasn't too terribly different than what he'd had at his home with Steve. But this Tony in this world seemed a lot different than him, and he didn't know what to make of it. If they were truly this band of superheroes like everyone kept mentioning, then maybe he had files on them somewhere, so he could navigate this world as long as he was stuck in it. And hopefully figure out a way back, if there was one.
“My feelings for you haven’t changed, Natasha,” Matt told her. “But if anything like this happens again, I’m not going to stick around for it. I don’t want to be with someone like that.”
Tony waited a few minutes until the coast was clear and then made his way back to their house. None of this was making sense to him. What kind of fucked up shit was his daughter getting into? Who were these people she was after?
Natasha snorted. "Uh, never."
Russian for "little bird." Clint is Hawkeye. It's a pet name Nat uses.
“Yes. If Thanos is in control of the power stone, this will make him physically very strong. You will need all of your strength combined to be able to defeat him.”
"Wait, what do you mean I was never given the super soldier serum?"
“Right,” Tony said again. “Is there any way we can touch this reality stone you have?”
Clint snorted. “Yeah, sure he was.”
"Your stomach is showing."
The Avengers spent the next hour or so talking to Jane and Thor and running through different theories and solutions until they were all talked out. They decided to order some Chinese food and watch some movies they deemed as classic, getting in some team bonding and helping Steve acclimate more to the 21st century all in one go. They fell asleep there together on the couch, momentarily free of worry and their minds away from the Tony Stark situation.
Natasha grabbed the wrap form the medicine cabinet along with a packet of paracetamol. She wrapped up Karen's wrist as much as she could without hurting the girl. "You want painkillers?" she asked. "It'll help the swelling go down."
Steve nodded.
“No!” Thanos shouted, falling down on his knees, trying to gather all the tiny little pieces and fit them back together again. There was blood and bruising all over his face, ruined from the force of Steve’s shield, but he was still relatively unharmed and still in fighting condition.
“Great. So these Titans have the skillset of both Eternals and Krees. That sounds like a not so good combination.”
“I came to find you.”
Steve nodded along with Clint and the older Natasha. Vision simply turned to Wanda, who let her crimson magic come out to play. Thor waved his hammer Mjolnir in the air, and then they were off to fight the alien.
“And that’s what you want to do on Earth?”
Everything was playing out like a movie as Clint waited with bated breath, feeling like he was outside himself. He didn’t feel like it was him, hiding with an arrow poised at the man with the gun. He didn’t feel like it was him who let the arrow fly straight into Wesley’s chest as he pointed the gun at Natasha’s temple. He didn’t feel like it was him as he watched Natasha struggle to get the gun out of Wesley’s hands, watched as the gun went off, fired into Wesley’s throat, watched as his lifeless body slid to the floor of the abandoned warehouse.
“Yeah, that’s what his father thought. I talk to Karen, you know. She found out Fisk bludgeoned his father to death when he was 12 years old. What makes you think he’d hesitate to do the same to you?”
“Why not?” Steve asked, exasperated. “We have a real chance to save one of our own! Why can’t be take it?”
Thor gave him a watery smile and crushed him with a hug. "And he's a good person?"
“Do you all have a contingency plan?”
Clint almost really did throw up this time. He forgot that the younger alternate version of his best friend was still alive. It seemed unreal, that his Nat was dead and she was still there.
Natasha nodded. “Okay. Then do it.”
Tony looked up at her in surprise. She seemed so unaffected by all of this. He suspected she was just as freaked as the rest of them, she just knew how to hide it better.
“I did not imagine such things would have taken place,” he said, apologising in the only way he knew how.
Current Whereabouts: Brooklyn, New York
"Right. And Thor and Jane don't exist?"
“But it’ll get you back where you need to go! You need to warn the Avengers of what’s coming. You have to defeat Thanos. If that means I have to get transported into another world, then I’ll accept that. This means more than that.”
“Yeah, but we’re retaining our memories when we go back in time. So this time we know how to stop Thanos and we can repeat everything we did to capture him.”
“Any news?” He asked, hoping there wouldn’t be any bad news.
The problem was, he couldn't. And so he drank until he couldn't think straight. And then he drank a little more until he couldn't see or walk straight. And then a little more so he would pass out and not have to think about anything at all.
Natasha knelt down in front of Tony and held his face in her hands. She gazed into his unfocused hazel eyes, staring hard, trying to figure out what was going on with him. How did he suddenly know things he didn't used to know, like Matt Murdock, or how to cook? Why was he talking about kids she was sure he didn't have? "Who is we?" She asked gently.
"You and Dad aren't going to embarrass me are you?"
“Uh huh,” Natasha said, her voice shaky with uncertainty. “It’s what we had to do. It was self-defence. Pierce said stuff like this happens on missions all the time. We did nothing wrong.”
In order to clear his mind and figure out what was going on, Tony went down to his workshop to actually get some work done on his project. He didn’t feel comfortable lying to Steve, and he felt a little guilty not immediately consulting his husband about what he overheard. But maybe it was nothing, and he was totally overreacting. Or maybe they were playing a game. Kids did live role playing stuff all the time. Maybe it was like that. Maybe nothing was really going to happen that night.
"No."
"Maybe this version of me doesn't, but I put the self loathing behind me in college when my parents died. I let go of that negativity. And I have a good life and a great family and I'm happy with who I am. You don't know anything about me, Steve."
Natasha nods.
“But that’s different. I can handle that. But you’re working outside the law, Natasha. There are rules. You have to follow them.”
Natasha shrugged, even though she knew Matt couldn’t see. “If that’s what it takes.”
“I think the term ‘friends’ is stretching it. But we’ve come to an understanding. He…may not be as terrible as I had initially expected.”
“Have you ever actually sat down with Steve and had a discussion about his issues with you? I mean, why do you
Well,
“How’s that? Gonna use your superhero powers to track down the asshole that did this and kill them or somethin’?”
“Yeah,” Tony told her. “FRIDAY detecting Thanos entering Earth’s atmosphere. No doubt he knows exactly where we are, so…fighting is going to happen. A lot of it. Do you still want to be patched into my HUD?”
“So?” she said. “Does Matt pass your test?”
can.”
“How long have I been gone?”
Rhodey sat down in the chair across from Tony. "Same as usual. More training. Thor is a different story, but Wanda's powers were created in a lab. By HYDRA. From a stone. And so were Vision's, but he's...a robot? I tell you man, when we were kids I never thought our world was gonna be this strange."
“Tony, if you never let Steve past your barrier, how is he ever supposed to know that the man in the tabloids isn’t the real you? That you’re more than that?”
She saw Steve grit his teeth as he tried to attack Thanos and was swatted out of the way, his back hitting the ground hard. He grunted in pain. Tony stuck his hand out to help Steve up, patting him on the back as he did so. “You okay, Cap?” he asked.
he doesn’t like you?”
Despite how late it was, Pietro answered on the second ring. “Hello?” he asked.
Steve doubted he would, but he agreed anyway, just because he was too tired to argue with Clint right then. So he shut his mouth, allowed Clint to order them all pizza, accepted the tea Natasha made him, and pretended that his mind wasn’t searching for every possible outcome to end this conflict with the mad Titan.
"Hello, sirs," Matt said. "I would shake your hands, but I can't exactly see where you are in order to do that."
"Still..."
"Me and Steve," he said, as if it was obvious and he were offended she even had to ask.
“I don’t believe that for a second, Loki.”
Tony nodded. “Sure.”
Clint didn’t feel like they had done anything right, but he kept his mouth shut, for Natasha.
"Well, they might, but I don't know them."
Everything was so upside down and he wished for normal now more than ever before. He wanted to go back to his two normal kids and his normal husband who grew up living with his cousin Peggy and where Jarvis wasn't an artificial intelligence and he didn't have an arc reactor keeping shrapnel from entering his heart and killing him and he sold solar powered technology and didn't fly around in a metal suit for a living. He wasn't a fan of comics books in real life and really didn't want to live in one.
And that's how his teammates found him: passed out on the couch, with a whole empty bottle of vodka on the floor beside him and a half empty bottle lying next to him on the couch. Natasha slapped him until he began to come to.
“Their dad scares me.”
“Your friends?”
“Scanning now, sir,” FRIDAY said.
Tony and Steve kept glaring at each other, emotions charged, before Tony backed down. “Yeah, sure thing. FRIDAY, scan the stone for me, would ya?”
You could have gotten away with everything I did without a slap on the wrist while I had to suffer in the dungeons of Asgard. Do you know what they did to me down there, brother? I only let you see what I wanted you to see. The truth was much grimmer.”
Fury studied him, then acquiesced. “Fine. But they don’t come into the atmosphere. We obtain the information from communication in space only.”
When Tony was done reading, he sat back and rubbed a hand across his face. There wasn't a huge amount of detail in the files, lots of details were redacted for safety, but he had still learned more about the Avengers lives than he knew beforehand. For instance, he learned that Steve's home life was basically the same...except apparently his husband wasn't his husband, he grew up in the 20s instead of the 80s, he had some super soldier serum running in his veins, he was frozen in time for 70 years, and apparently was rumoured to have had a thing with his father. That was a lot to process.
“Yes, I would very much like that,” he said.
Tony narrowed his eyes. “Enough chitchat,” he said, walking towards Thanos. “You want all the stones for that hideous gauntlet of yours?”
Clint noisily made his presence known and he walked back into the kitchen. “Well, it looks like you two patched things up,” Clint drawled.
“Father always said you were treated fairly,” Thor argued, though he swallowed at the genuine pain in Loki’s voice.
“Sure. You two grew up together here.”
Tony hesitated. How was he supposed to tell this Natasha her cute little brother was an assassin from HYDRA who had tried to murder them and was currently AWOL? He decided not to mention it; some things she didn’t need to know. “Something like that,” he muttered instead.
“What colour do you wanna be, sissy?” Bucky asked her. “I’m blue and Dada is red.”
Tony drummed his fingers on the desk while they waited for FRIDAY to scan the stone, and then sighed when he got bored. “Well, this is suuuuuper boring,” he told them. “It’s gonna take FRIDAY some time. She’ll tell us when we get the results. We should do something else in the meantime.”
"Dad, I said it's not like that, okay? Matt's Catholic. He wants to wait and I'm respecting his wishes."
“For if everything doesn’t go perfectly the second time and he gets away? Do you have another idea of how to stop him?”
"Don't let him get you in trouble."
Tony peered at her. “I think something big is happening,” he said, “Something that all the universes are experiencing, regardless of the rules in the universe. Something happened in that battle that brought the Avengers together. Someone got in my mind. Someone bad, who wanted to rule the world, remake it in his own image. I think, if he gains enough power, he can conquer not just one world, but all of them. I think things are only going to get worse before they get better.”
Tony nodded. “I’m gonna hire a lawyer. We’ll deal with it. But you have to promise me you won’t get yourself mixed up in this kind of stuff again. I understand you want a career dealing with government facilities, but you’re going to do it the legal way. You’re gonna go to college, and apply for a government program and go through recruitment that way. And I am going to fully vet any government agency that tries to sink its claws into you. Got it?”
The blood drained out of Natasha’s face. “How do you know about that?”
! It would be fatal if we didn't!"
"Good day," he confirmed, shifting Bucky onto his right hip as he kissed Tony. "Pizza okay for dinner tonight?"
Tony nodded and then clapped his hands together. “Okay, now who wants to do some infinity stone training?”
“You’ve been working with him?”
"Guess not."
“It’s okay, you’re here now. Do you wanna play Candyland with Dada and I?”
“Projecting? Jeez, who are you, my therapist? Kid, what would I be projecting onto Steve?”
Natasha rolled her eyes. "Stop being an old man. My outfit's fine."
Natasha and Steve plopped into the other universe, right back into Tony’s lab where it had all started. Immediately Natasha keeled over and threw up on the floor, prompting Tony’s robot DUM-E to come and clean it up. She sat down in a lab chair, clutching her stomach and waiting for it to settle down.
“Well, at least you still have us,” Steve offered. “Hey, you didn’t meet the other version of Bucky, did you?”
Natasha stayed focused, though, even if she was confused. "Tony, you're not married to Steve, okay? He was frozen in ice 20 years ago."
Thor called on Heimdall to open the Bifrost and with a rainbow flash he was gone from the place he once stood.
He’d never felt more useless in his entire life.
They ate at the kitchen table and talked some more about hobbies and interests, future career goals, and the like. True to their words, her dads weren't being too embarrassing or awful and seemed to genuinely like Matt, which was a good thing for her. They didn't bombard him with questions about his dad's death or him being blind. Instead, they treated him like they would anyone else.
of me, not because I always wanted them. I make big grand gestures and buy people things because I genuinely believe that’s why people keep me around, why they like me. Because why would anyone love Tony Stark for Tony Stark?”
He waited and waited as on the surface his teammates called in Fury, appraised him of the situation, and what they were going to do about it. Vision kept immaculate control of him and they hung out in space until Fury reached their hideout. They came back down again. Fury’s expression was thunderous as he took in Thanos, his missing hand, his bashed in face. Then he scoffed.
Natasha wrinkled her nose. "Dad, this is not a conversation I want to have with you."
There was that choked laugh again, but this time no one stopped him. The others were too busy trying to absorb whatever Tony was trying to tell them.
Thanos was still laughing. “No one can stop me,” he said. “Not even your Avengers. Good luck, son of Earth. In the end, you will be defeated. I truly hope you survive the culling.”
Clint stared at her like she had two heads. “Yeah, definitely don’t believe you.”
“And you, Thor?”
“So, Tasha,” Tony said. “The younger one,” he clarified when both Natashas turned to look at him. “What’s up in your world? With the situation you were in? Any updates?”
"I'm pretty sure you did exist! Natasha worked at a magic shop your brother Loki owns. So if he's on Earth and human and everything, you probably are too."
She smiled softly. "Hi." She grasped his chin in her hand and leaned in to kiss his lips.
“Yes, sir.”
“That’s not fair. My dad knew the risks when he let me come to this universe—”
“Dad?” she said, eyes red and puffy from crying, her hands shaking at her sides. “I fucked up, and I don’t know what to do. I thought I could handle it on my own, and I can’t…I need your help, Dad, please.”
Steve stood there, unsure of how to help her.
“I don’t know, Tony, is it?”
Wanda growled at that. “Does he?” she asked.
Lovers:
“Doesn’t it, brother? I have done a lot of selfish things.”
"And she's always welcome here, but I want to know what's going on with you."
did anything?”
The secret was out. Now they knew. And none of them could go back to pretending they didn't know what was going on now. He didn't know if they thought he was crazy and they were planning like a rehab intervention or something for him, or if they had actually spoken to Jane and believed the totally and frankly absurd notion that he was from another world. If it hadn't happened to him, he wouldn't have believed himself either. And yet, here he was.
Lovers:
“Hell yes!” Natasha said, feeling more chipper, and eager to take her mind off the dark things. She followed Tony to the elevator, making small talk with him as they went, until they were gone, leaving the rest of the Avengers in the common area without them.
"That the boyfriend?" he asked Natasha.
So she and Clint were still friends in this universe. Good to know.
“No,” Tony said defensively. “I’m not drunk. I only had one drink.”
“Really, where were you?” Clint asked.
“No. But I do not believe you were doing it of your own free will. Your sceptre held one of the stones.”
Matt snorted. “You’re not getting information out of his boyfriend. Are you insane? It was one thing when you wanted to deal with Anatoly and Vladimir, okay? I get it. You guys are Russian. They might have known your family. They might have talked to you and trusted you. You could have infiltrated their ranks. Dealing with Wesley is going to get you on his radar. You can’t get past him and Nobu if you want to live. They’ll tear you apart.”
“And you didn’t think to include us in it?”
Bucky put his tiny hand in hers and led her over to the table, where he and Steve were in the middle of playing the board game. She sat down in between the two and immediately hugged her other dad.
Far as Steve could tell, it was just a bunch of crystals and herbs and stuff. Things that were supposed to aid in magic and healing and spells. He wasn’t sure how much they were supposed to work. The only people he knew with magic had their powers naturally, not with the aid of these things.
“Steve…well, Steve from my world, was born back in the 1920s, tried to get into the army during World War II. They did some experimenting on him, made him into a super soldier. He went from skinny, asthmatic kid to like…holy muscles. Got super strength and hearing and all that good stuff. Fought in World War II, crashed a plane into the Atlantic, got frozen in ice for like 70 years, and then came back to us.”
Once Natasha's bedroom door was shut and locked, she turned to her best friend. They sat their plates of pizza on her bedside dresser.
Name: Clinton Francis Barton
Thanos laughed. “Is that so, Stark? Do you really think you can stop me? I have the gauntlet needed to harness the stones of power. I have one of the stones already. You really think you can stop me?”
Tony rolled his eyes, but didn’t comment. He grabbed the yellow stone off the lab table and shut his eyes, focusing all his energy on finding Thanos. Then Tony’s perception seemed to shift and the world once more fell away from him as he found himself in a pitch black, seemingly endless void. Just like last time.
“You don’t have to tell me,” Tony muttered.
"Hmm," Tony hummed. "So when do we get to meet this elusive Matt Murdock?"
Fuck. Tony could feel a headache blossoming. How was he supposed to get anything done in this
They spent the rest of the night drinking straight from the bottle, getting drunk. Natasha pretended like she didn't notice Karen's bloodshot eyes were from crying. She ignored Matt's calls for the rest of the night and snuggled into bed with her best friend, drunkenly laughing with her and making light sabre noises as they watched
Thanos sighed. “I’m tired,” he stated. “I wish to retire, to raise my daughters in peace. If I acquire all of the gems, I can, with just the snap of my fingers, erase half the population of the multiverse, so that all of the world’s problems will be fixed in the blink of an eye.”
Tony’s brows furrowed. “You’re telling me you know who they are?”
. Steve wasn’t the greatest at comforting people, but he tried anyway, if the situation called for it. He put a hand on Tony’s arm. “I’m so sorry, Tony,” he said. “But I think there’s a way I can help.”
“I like your parents. A lot.”
"Eat lots of food!" Thor stated jovially.
Foggy picked him up around 8:45 and as soon as she watched them drive away and shut the door her fathers were sitting on the kitchen counter, waiting for her.
They all replied with groans and death glares, but not surprisingly took him up on his offer. Soon as everyone had coffee mugs in front of them and enough breakfast food to go around and they were all seated at the kitchen table, Tony decided to take the plunge and just get it over with.
Name: Steven Grant Rogers
“But he still has emotions and pain receptors. That should matter, Tony.”
Steve shrugged, but Wanda’s voice chimed in over the comms. “Like Nat said, use the stones to trick his mind into seeing something different. Who’s using the reality stone?”
She laughed. "Okay. See ya, дьявол
The Incident: While making a weapons demonstration for the Jericho Missile in Afghanistan, Tony was blown up by his own weapons and held hostage by Afghan war criminals. His heart was kept alive by a battery and then later with the Arc Reactor, built by Tony himself. While held prisoner, he built his first Iron Man suit and escaped. He later discovered business partner and close family friend Obadiah Stane purposely set up his kidnapping and was trying to take over his company. He stole the Iron Man suit idea, tried to kill Tony, and was taken down in an epic fight that turned Tony into a hero instead of the Merchant of Death.
“Dude, that’s so freaking cool!” Young Natasha muttered under her breath.
“Clint’s married! To Pietro, of all people. They adopted a little girl named Luna last year.”
“Not really,” she said, but she stood up anyway and made her way out of Tony’s lab. They took the elevator to the common room, where the rest of the Avengers were waiting to say goodbye to her, send her off with well wishes. She gave each of them a hug, including her older self, who hugged her tighter than anyone else.
Nat made a soft noise. "Why'd you call me?" she asked.
“You got eyes on him?” he asked.
"Why didn't you call Foggy? He's your boyfriend. Aren't you supposed to talk to him about this kind of stuff?"
“Er, well, yes.” She looked at Natasha for clarification.
“He and I were friends long before you were ever born.” Steve sighed. “Long story short, I grew up in another time period. Crashed my plane in the ocean during World War II, and spent the next 70 years trapped in ice but still alive.”
“I’m glad everything is good. And we’re all really glad you’re back. Your brother is awake.”
"Man, I wish my homework were as easy as learning shapes. Wanna do my calculus homework for me?"
“Well, let me tell you. It all started with my parents…”
"Dada?" Bucky asked.
The older Natasha got up from the couch and walked towards the younger version of herself, inspecting her. “I don’t understand,” she said. “Tony, when you and Steve switched universes, the other version switched places with you. How come there are two of me in the same universe?”
Tony let out a slew of curse words under his breath. “Alexander Pierce?”
"And you still married me?" Steve didn't understand why Tony would marry the other version of him. None of the girls had ever looked at him until after Project Rebirth. Why would Tony have looked at him?
Natasha stepped in again to diffuse the situation. “Okay, okay. Both of you, stop. Before we start doing anything, we need to figure out how to destroy these stones, which means research. Can we do that first?”
“We’re gonna call Pierce, and he’s going to take care of this, okay? And then we’re gonna go home and act like nothing’s wrong, because we can’t afford to freak out anymore, okay?”
Tony blinked up at Natasha, abandoning his work. “Big ass purple dude with some seriously weird chin action going on?” he asked.
“Oh? Do tell.”
Tony settled into his chair, clicked the first name, and got to reading on his life here.
“Does she want to be saved?”
"Yes. I'll see you when I get home tonight, okay? I'll read you a bedtime story."
She came to in her brother’s hospital room; the first person her eyes saw was her father Tony.
Sidenote: the colours associated with the infinity gems/stones vary from comic to comic and are also different in the MCU. In the comics, it’s more common that the reality stone is yellow, however in MCU it’s the red stone (aka the Aether). This means that logically the reality stone should be the one in Knowhere with the Collector, but as I gave the reality stone to Tony & Co. and since at the time of writing this no one knew where the last stone was, I made the last stone be the one Thor gave to the Collector. And on a further note, I didn’t include Dr Strange or the Guardians in this story, so one of these stones is collected by the Avengers and another is collected by Thanos. So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.
"Come on, I can't mess with him a bit?"
“She grew up?”
Hours later, and lots of yelling of concern and one too many drinks, Tony was fitting himself for sleep. He needed rest. Like, a decent good night's sleep that didn't involve images of his best friends dying or robots invading the world or crazy power wielding goths who can get in your mind and bend reality.
Steve was woken up early that morning by a blaring siren noise that spread throughout the compound. He blinked wearily for a few minutes, adjusting to the abrupt wakeup call.
But it didn’t. Wanda kept control of Thanos enough for Tony to get the hand off. Thor used Mjolnir to shatter the gauntlet and the power gem. Clint found himself sliding down from his perch and grabbing Vision as he hurled them into space, just like last time.
“Eh, I bet you’re decent at it. You’re pretty great at lots of things, Nat. You’re a better hacker than I am.”
“Dad, the whole freaking
Fuck that, Tony thought. “Right. So you want to play General Kodos.”
Before Clint knew it, he was back in the tree, watching the events unfold beneath him. Wanda was using her magic to control Thanos into submission, and Tony had already severed his hand from his body. It was lying there on the ground, waiting for Thor to destroy the gauntlet. Before he did so, he pocketed the soul stone, allowing them access to Natasha’s soul in the afterlife.
Tony stared at him, blinked a couple times, and then said into his phone, “I’m gonna have to call you back, Pepper,” and violently shoved his phone into his back pocket.
“Huh. Who knew Tony Stark had a heart?” Clint asked.
Alias: Black Widow
“Never better,” Steve said grimly.
“Wait, what about me?” the younger Natasha said. “Why can’t I have a stone?”
Tony sucked in a breath. “Yeah, I just recently met them. Not sure how much I like them, yet.”
“I know so. Me, personally, I might not be able to. But the Tony of your universe? The one with Steve and the other superheroes? They’re going to come after you. And they’re going to stop you.”
Tony shrugged. “To be honest, we haven’t really spoken much since the Ultron thing happened. I think she’s frustrated with my lifestyle. She doesn’t like being put in the middle of feuding superheroes and villains. I don’t think she belongs in this world.”
"Fine, maybe I don't," Steve conceded.
“Fuck. Natasha, he’s not S.H.I.E.L.D. He’s HYDRA.”
“He’s my husband,” Tony replied.
Age: 33
That was, until Wanda figured it out. “My contact got back to me on a way to safely remove the stone,” she said, flinging the email from her phone onto FRIDAY’s network so they could all see it. “Essentially, we just have to re-map all of his neurons, and then we can safely remove it. He’ll retain all of his knowledge and personality, but he won’t have any of the power that the gem provided him.”
“I don’t fucking care if the dude was hung by his toenails for a century. He doesn’t deserve to be the ruler of Asgard, not after everything he did.”
To his surprise, the comms link was still working from their place in space. He didn’t think something like that could reach this far, but apparently Tony was a genius and knew how to make his tech functional.
“Yes, that is most troublesome. Perhaps I will stay here until her research is finished and then take her up to Asgard with me. She deserves a break, no?”
“Yes,” Loki confirmed.
He tried desperately to cling to his existence, the one he was terrified would melt away, the one where he got his happy ending with Steve.
After a few minutes and as the object started to take shape, Steve reared back in surprise and almost threw the sketchbook across the room. He could see in the dark shape of the eyes, in the dense muscles, in the light that coalesced from the chest. Why in the world was Steve Rogers drawing Tony Stark?
"Karen, your dad's not supposed to hurt you. Like hell it's not a big deal. Now let me see what he did."
"Amen to that," Natasha said under her breath. Her cell phone buzzed and she took it out of her pocket, smiling as she texted someone back.
“Yes.”
“Thanos,” he said, not keeping up any pretence.
As the coffee pot gurgled, the Avengers began to stir, starting with Clint and trickling down to the rest of the group. Tony snuck back into the kitchen, the coffee pot full to its limits with the strongest amount of coffee he could make. When he turned back around, the group was all making their way towards him.
The two were interrupted by a small body plopping itself down on Tony's chest. The wind was knocked out from him for a second before he got his breath back.
Nat's little brother Bucky was, thankfully, on a play date with some friend named Sam that he'd met in pre-school. She was just happy she didn't have to deal with her annoying little brother for a night, especially since she was nervous for her dads to meet Matt. It's not that Matt was a bad guy, or that that she was embarrassed by him or anything, she just wanted to keep her private life and her friends away from her parents.
Loki scoffed. “Why should I help you? Maybe I want to see Thanos win.”
“So I’m basically your guys’ Oracle?”
Thanos continued his ugly leer, but it took more of a condescending dip to it. “I’ve fought much braver, stronger, and honourable men than the Avengers, my child. However, none of them have amused me as much as you have. Perhaps after I control the stones, our paths will cross again.”
She smiled. “Yeah. Just got back from my first case as an agent. I’m brand spanking new around the office.”
“Their parents are still alive?”
Tony smirked. "Yeah." He looked over at Steve, remembering how the tiny man could fold into him, how his hands dwarfed Steve, how much he loved being able to count the man's ribs with his fingertips. Steve wouldn't be Steve anymore if he weren't small and skinny.
The day she was set to leave was an emotional one for her. She missed her own world, but she sure was going to miss all of the Avengers she had gotten to know. She wished she had a way to keep in contact with Tony and Steve and Wanda, but the multiverse wouldn’t allow her to do that. She would go the rest of her life wondering how things on this world were going.
Tony sighed. “Do you think we can defeat him? Just us, without the power the stones can provide us with?”
"No problem. Good luck meeting the parents, man," he said to Matt. Foggy waved goodbye to Natasha and got back in his car. Natasha led Matt into the foyer.
“Hi,” Matt said. He felt his way over to where Natasha’s voice was and she helped guide him onto the stool beside her.
Steve laughed. "We'll try not to. Tonight's a Friday. You think he can come over for dinner? I promise we'll leave you two alone if you want to hang out after dinner, but please. I would like to sit down and talk with him, to get to know him. No intimidation or tricks."
“And I’m sure you’ll all fight valiantly. Until we meet again, little Stark.”
He heard Peggy’s sharp intake of breath and Natasha muttered, “Holy crap,” as he assessed this other person who was supposed to be her father.
real. This is your world, Tony. This mad, crazy world where all of us just got done besting a psycho robot named Ultron that you accidentally created. You went down here to work three nights ago and never came back up. You've been sitting here in this chair, asleep, your mind somewhere else. This world where Steve is your husband, where Bucky and Natasha are your children."
? She signed back.
“And what do I get in return for helping you and those pathetic excuses for heroes out?”
"Will you please just humour your old man for a second? Your other father's been worried about you coming home pregnant and he's too scared to talk to you about protection and I just want to make sure you're being...safe."
"Yeah," Tony said. "Sorry."
"Do I have a red and gold iron suit?" He finally asked.
"Where's here?" Tony asked.
"I'm sure they have, Clint, now let's focus on the situation at hand, please," Natasha said.
Tony snorted. “Yeah, like what? That in every iteration and every universe, we belong together, or some sappy shit like that?”
Tony nodded. "That was in my dream. Everything felt so real there. I was a superhero and so was Steve. He had like an American flag on a shield. And I think Bucky wasn't a kid because he had a metal arm, and he shot Natasha once. She was a Russian assassin, not my daughter. We were part of a group together. I don't remember what we were called."
“Thor! Buddy!” Tony chimed in happily. “How do you know that?”
"That's what she said."
“Yeah, about that…how are you here? Not that it’s not good to see you and the Capsicle again, but…this isn’t your world.”
Natasha held up her hand to show him the engagement ring she’d gotten when he proposed after her college graduation.
“Fine, then you don’t get a stone to control,” Tony quipped. “But you do remember your powers came from one of those stones, right?”
It did indeed take days to complete the process, all the while the other Avengers continued to experiment with the stones. They learned how to bend perception, change harmful objects into less harmful ones, travel back in time when a simulation didn’t go as planned so they could do it over, and even travel through different rooms in the blink of an eye. If they could all use their gems seamlessly, they would be able to overpower and confuse Thanos long enough for Wanda to use her magic in order to destroy his power stone. At least, that was the plan. They had no way of knowing if they would actually succeed or not.
“Do you trust this Pierce guy?”
Steve smiled and kissed Bucky's forehead. Bucky giggled. Okay, the kid was kind of cute. His kid.
“Fuck,” she said. “I killed him. He’s dead. What the fuck are we gonna do?”
Slowly, he began to see her coming towards him from the distance. As she approached, she didn’t speak, and Clint scanned her face trying to catch any flaw in her form, any suggestion that this wasn’t really her. He couldn’t find any.
Or, maybe after the debacle with Ultron, S.H.I.E.L.D. (or what was left of it) had finally decided to take government action and seize all of his belongings so he couldn’t be a threat to society anymore. Damn Fury if he had anything to do with it. He was just about to call Nick and give him a piece of his mind when a girl walked in his lab.
Tony smiled softly. “Sure, buddy,” he said.
“Wow. Yeah, that death glare is still the same. Still scares me. I love it.”
was different and Darth Vader turned out not to be Luke's father."
Tony looked hopelessly lost, sitting in the chair surrounded by the tools of his workshop. "You mean like science fiction stuff?"
The Avengers looked at each other again. This was news to them. "Your kids?" Natasha asked.
Before heading out, Steve heard Tony address FRIDAY. “Hey FRIDAY, can you patch to the Avengers mansion and make sure Ms Stark-Rogers is on the line?”
“Did he say what his next move was?”
“Yes, Tony. If it helps save the universe,” Vision said.
“You know I
"I trust you to lead me around." He handed his cane to her and she placed it next to the umbrella rack. Then she took his forearm and led him to where her parents were waiting in the living room, a deep sigh on her lips trying to get rid of her nerves.
“Because we would be using the stones for our own personal gain! If we do it once, what’s to stop us from continuing to do it? How does that make us any better than Thanos? I don’t want the power of these stones to consume us, Steve. I don’t want to rely on their power. We use it to stop him, and then we never use them again. That was the deal.”
“My vote is yes,” the younger Natasha said.
Thanos tilted his chin skywards. “You have all the stones?” he asked.
Tony sighed. “I guess I’m taking your computer away, too. Do I need to set parental controls or have you learned your lesson?”
“Told you I wasn’t crazy. Told you all and none of you believed me.”
"Yeah. But do you all really want to know about his other world? Once you know, you can't go back. Trust me, I wish I could and not know about this world, but we don't always get what we want."
Nat arched an eyebrow. "Just his liquor this time?"
Natasha shook her head. She didn’t know who that was.
Known Affiliations:
"Colouring!" Bucky said.
“I used a magic gem to transport myself into another universe in order to stop an alien named Thanos from destroying half the population.”
“No,” Wanda said. “It’s too risky.”
It was late when he snuck back into this foster parents’ home. He crawled into bed after taking off his bracers and placing his bow beside his bed. He scrolled through the contacts on his phone until he got to Pietro, pressing the call button before he could chicken and back out.
Steve chuckled. “I was thinking of going tomorrow, after you’ve slept and showered and checked in on Bucky. Yeah?”
I keep forgetting to post this. I committed to posting Sunday nights and then I just like...never actually post it when I tell myself I am. This is why I never post long fics, lol. Sorry for anyone (if anyone actually cares) who cares about this.
Heimdall nodded. “Yes. There has been some buzz about the stones as of late.”
“One of you chopping off his hand so you can steal the infinity gauntlet?” Natasha piped up. “Think about it, it’s kind of perfect. Steve can…I don’t know, chop it off with his shield or Tony, you can burn it off with your beam things and then just take the gauntlet. And then that leaves him wounded enough for the others to stop him.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Me neither. How ‘bout you, mini Natasha?”
Natasha crossed her arms over her chest. “I
“I don’t know how the stone works. Do you think we can go to Loki’s magic shop and ask him about it? Maybe he’ll have a hint as to getting us home.”
“Isn’t it about time you found out?”
He was helping Bucky with his homework when Natasha walked in the door, talking to someone on her cell phone. She waved to them and walked up the steps, her door slamming. A few minutes later Steve walked in the door and Bucky lost all his concentration, wrapping around his father like a starfish.
Natasha smiled. “Yeah, he and Bucky are attached at the hip. Best friends forever, apparently.”
Natasha turned to look at him. “I thought you hated me learning how to fight.”
Loki’s eyes flashed green. “Or maybe I enjoyed the chaos he represented. Maybe I wanted to see your precious Earth burn.”
Steve nodded. He guessed they came in contact at some point, but he wasn’t going to pry. Not when his (their?) son was in the hospital.
“Yeah,” Natasha said. “But his dad never wanted him to box, so he doesn’t. It’s not like he really could, anyway. He’s blind.”
Thor nodded, knowing their conversation was over. Tomorrow he would receive the stone from Loki, and then he would be off to Knowhere and Xandar to retrieve the other two.
“If it were Wanda, I would want to go back for her. We cannot leave anyone behind. I say yes,” Vision said.
Okay, so no dirty business. Good to know. "Okay," he said, taking the pen from Pepper's hand and signing the documents. "Good luck at the meeting," he said to her.
"Well, I don't know. I suppose so," Jane said. "I don't see why you wouldn't be." She sighed. "Why don't you get some sleep? We'll figure this out when we wake up in the morning. Maybe you'll remember something in a dream again, or you can talk to the rest of your team tomorrow and they can fill in some blanks that we can't."
Natasha snorted. "He sure sounds a lot like our Tony when it comes to bossing people around."
Natasha had been asking a lot of questions about her past lately. He and Steve had sat down with her and showed her all the information they had on the adoption, the story the agency had fed them, along with any personal information. Apart from knowing her birth name was Natalia, and that her parents had been murdered, there hadn’t been much to tell Natasha. They thought she had taken it pretty well, but maybe she found something else out that he and Steve hadn’t. He didn’t know what to think anymore.
“That’s good, right? That means you can tell where the stones are?”
He smiled. “Yes. My name is Thanos, from the world of Titan.”
"Thank you."
The evening was going off without a hitch. He had his eyes on Natasha, he was texting back and forth with Frank about their progress. Everything was coming up cherries for them as the night droned on, and the crowd began to thin as the event was coming to an end. Natasha and Wesley were making their way towards the couches in the lobby, champagne flutes still in their hands.
“Regardless, you’re never going to get on the same level as Steve if you two don’t hash things out. You think he thinks he’s better than all of you, he probably assumes you think
“So was he born that way?” Tony asked.
“Did you really think you could beat us?” Tony asked, shooting a repulsor beam right into his face. The blast knocked him onto his back, and once again Wanda was using her magic to keep Thanos under her thumb and docile.
Tony’s brow furrowed. “Magic? I haven’t been messing with any magic. I swear it. Magic isn’t real.”
“Yes. I believe your brother has hidden it for safe keeping. Perhaps you should speak with him about it. He is here on Asgard, if you wish to speak with him.”
“Really? Who’s he with then?”
“Pretty much. These legends don’t say which colour goes with which power. I asked Jane to look in some of Thor’s books from Asgard, but from what she told me the colours vary from book to book, so that’s a dead end,” Clint said.
“Yeah. We’re waiting to get married until after he finishes law school. He’s at Columbia now, absolutely killing it. He’s gonna make a great lawyer one he passes his Bar Exam.”
Current Whereabouts: S.H.I.E.L.D. Headquarters
“I wouldn’t call you a badass just yet. More like a mini badass.”
What. The. Fuck. Was. Happening?
Steve thought that meant that Natasha would see everything Tony saw through his helmet. He didn’t know what HUD meant exactly, but that’s the gist of what he understood when Tony tried explaining it to him.
He silently slipped downstairs and grabbed a drink from the fridge. Steve was on the sofa, flipping through some sketchbooks of his husband’s. Tony wondered if this Steve was an artist, too.
“What do you need me to do?” he asked.
“Me too, buddy,” Tony said. “Hey, how are things with Jane going?”
Steve nodded and pulled the yellow stone out of his pocket. “Yeah, it’s this thing. I was in Tony’s lab, and I was searching through his things, and it was underneath some papers, and it fell to the ground, and I picked it up, and suddenly I was here, so….”
I swear I wrote this before I saw Endgame. Like I legit swear. I had this all written out and finished, minus the editing, when Endgame was released. So the fact that Natasha died in both is an extreme coincidence. At least I brought her back to life?
“That’s the thing, Dad. I told the other Tony about it, and on his world S.H.I.E.L.D. is run by someone named Nick Fury. Alexander Pierce is this neo-Nazi guy, the one who tortured and turned his world’s Bucky into an assassin.”
"And for the record, I like Skinny Steve. He can fit in my arms when I hold him at night. Okay? I like that version of you. I wanted to marry that version, and I'm sorry you can't love that version of yourself."
"Well, yeah. I've only been married to him for 20 years."
“Explain away.”
“Always,” Tony informed her.
"Yeah."
“Then you know what that means if he gets a hold of them all.”
Jane shifted a little, nervous energy pent up. Why was taking to Tony about this so hard?
Natasha made an amused expression. “Yeah, I’m in high school.”
With hesitation, Karen peeled off her top. There were bruised littered on her ribs, her upper arms, her torso. Some were yellowed and fading, some were stark purple and fresh. Natasha vibrated with anger. No one should be able to fuck with her best friend. No one should be hit like that. No one deserved to be thrown around like that. She gingerly took Karen's wrist in hers, pressed softly on the skin. Karen hissed in pain, but she didn't move out of Nat's grip. Natasha very gently rolled the wrist around and felt the bones. "Well, it's not broken," she said. "Just a sprain. You want my ace bandage?"
"No. I just remember waking up in bed with Steve with flashes of memories from here. I don't know what I was doing here. This is...this is my workshop, yeah? Was I working on a project?"
“All right. You ready to get this show on the road?” Tony asked.
Thanos frowned. “No, I never wanted you two to hate each other. I wanted to turn you both into warriors. Fighting against each other was the easiest way to show your strengths and weaknesses, get you battle ready.”
"Are you dating Matt Murdock, by any chance?"
“About that,” Steve said, “you could have warned us.”
He let go of Steve's leg sullenly while Steve picked him up and put him in the island chair. "Love you, kiddo," he said before turning to his husband. "Love you too," he said, pecking Tony's lips before heading out the door.
Natasha took a long, deep breath. “Okay,” she said. “Okay. Let’s talk to Castle and Wade first. Are they still with Fisk?”
Sidenote: the colours associated with the infinity gems/stones vary from comic to comic and are also different in the MCU. In the comics, it’s more common that the reality stone is yellow, however in MCU it’s the red stone (aka the Aether). This means that logically the reality stone should be the one in Knowhere with the Collector, but as I gave the reality stone to Tony & Co. and since at the time of writing this no one knew where the last stone was, I made the last stone be the one Thor gave to the Collector. And on a further note, I didn’t include Dr Strange or the Guardians in this story, so one of these stones is collected by the Avengers and another is collected by Thanos. So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.
"Mhmm," Nat said, checking her phone again before drowning her pancakes in syrup.
Natasha shrugged. "I look cute. That's all that matters."
“Whatever, Clint. You love me anyway.”
Natasha put the phone back to her ear and started to walk off. "Ugh, sorry Karen, my dads were being annoying." The conversation faded from their earshot as her door closed again.
Steve chose that moment to tune out of their conversation, and focus his attention onto Wanda. She was off to the side, studying the stone on the table with an intense expression. The tell-tale sign of her magic was visible by the red in the air. He got up from where he was sitting and went over to Wanda.
Sure, he’d failed to secure Earth the first time around, but it was really rather foolish of him to place his trust in a bunch of disposable Chitauri soldiers and that blasted, slippery God of Chaos. This time, he wasn’t trusting anyone but himself to get the job done.
“You hacked into a government agency?”
Steve fell asleep that night coming up with mock scenarios of him and Tony talking through their issues.
“Karen is in rehab,” Matt said, breaking in with the bad news.
"Nuns?" Steve asked, not wanting to pry but wanting to at the same time.
"Bye," she said.
"Agreed," Clint stated.
"She's alive. She's part of our kids’ lives. Babysits Buck when we need her to. Comes to dinner once a month."
Clint groaned. "Way to ruin the end of the movie, man!"
“I’m gay? I’m married and gay?”
"But...I'm not actually married to Steve. Does Steve even exist in this world? Are we even together?" Tony felt panic dredge itself up, stick in his throat. He doubled over in the chair, trying to gain purchase of himself, to breathe clearly. Goddamn it. He hated these stupid panic attacks.
Jane sighed, trying to figure out the best way to explain to Tony what was going on. She didn't know very much about the world he was stuck in, what kind of career Tony had. For all she knew, he wasn't a scientist there. He could run a car dealership, for all she knew. And it wasn't like magic was very easy to explain, anyway. Thor had tried, but sometimes she just couldn't wrap her mind around the concept.
“I know, but I swear it’s true there.” Natasha took a bite of her waffles and chewed before speaking again. “You and Dad were different, but good different. I think I’m really gonna miss them.”
“I still don’t like this idea,” Wanda said.
"No, Loki gave me the day off. I don't work until Monday until 6:30. You going to be able to take me or do I need to ride the train?"
“You said you wanted honest. I’m honest.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Sir, my scanning of the stones is complete.”
“Right. Sorry, I don’t look much like your dad,” Steve said, embarrassed.
“Scanning now, Mr Stark,” FRIDAY said.
Coming home had never felt as good as it did now.
Natasha smiled up at Tony sleepily. “I love you too, old man.”
“So why are you here?” she asked again.
The vibe in the tower was awkward and tense. Natasha and Clint generally hung out separate from the others, trying not to be rude but really not wanting to interact with Natasha’s younger self in case there were major consequences to interacting with your alternate self. Vision and Wanda spent most of their time together, studying his stone. Steve had taken to spending most of his time in the gym, punching bags until his arms were shaking with exhaustion, or calling Sam up and going for a run until his legs were jello and he forgot the awful situation they were in. Tony spent most of his time in his own section of the lab or in the common room in a corner with the younger Natasha. He seemed to be spending all of his time with her and it had begun to irk Steve. Why was Tony spending so much time with someone who technically wasn’t his daughter instead of helping them understand the power of the gems?
Natasha was beautiful. She had on a tank top and shorts and was barefoot, not a stitch of makeup on her face. Her red hair was pulled back into a messy bun. She must have just woken up or something. And yet, it took Tony's breath away. Not in a like, oh my god she's so hot way, because hey, he's gay. But more like in an awed way. He was blown away by his daughter, that someone that amazing was part of his family, and he guessed the thought that this is what his daughter would look like when she was all grown up kind of choked him up. He's a sappy old gay dad. What did he expect?
Natasha nodded and rushed into her dad’s arms. He cradled the back of her head, clinging to her desperately, afraid to let go but afraid of what it would mean if he didn’t. “I love you,” he told her.
“Done,” Steve said.
Natasha huffed a laugh over the comms. “I guess it’s time then, huh?”
Tony snorted. “Why did you do that?”
Clint grinned. “Guess who hooked up with Pietro?” Clint pointed at himself.
"That's good. No, that's useful. Hey, Steve wants to have you over for dinner sometime. And I'm sure our kids would love to hang out with their cool aunt sometime soon, so let us know if you wanna stop by sometime. You know, when you're not busy. Running my company."
Birthplace: Waverley, Iowa
Natasha laughed weakly. “Yeah, I really made a mess of things. I really gotta clean that up when I get home.” She sighed heavily. “You’re really gonna keep the stone and come visit me?”
to the fight? She still found that hard to believe. And hard to believe that he was so confident against all the odds. Sure, he had the gauntlet, but other than that and strength on his side, it looked like an easyish win for the Avengers. He had to have something up his sleeve.
Thor’s skin was vibrating, itching for the kind of fights he and the Warriors Three had been subject to in Asgard. He would not doubt relish in this fight, and then have a celebratory feast with the rest of his brothers in arms when they defeated the Mad Titan. Thor was eager to put this man in his place, torture him after all the torture he put his brother through. Loki had done a lot of bad things in his life, and Thor had forgiven him for a lot. It was a relief to know Loki had not willingly worked with Thanos that day during the Battle of Manhattan. That just meant all that misplaced anger and mistrust had to funnel itself somewhere, and Thor chose to use it to obliterate the man who had ensnared and mind controlled his little brother. He couldn’t wait to see Thanos go down.
Clint groaned. “Fine. But why call in Fury? Why can’t be just send him to Asgard like he did Thor’s evil little brother?”
Clint saluted her and disappeared into the crowd, leaving Natasha alone with her part of the mission.
Steve shrugged. “A Steve from another universe? Apparently?”
“Don’t call me that,” he heard Loki mutter as he walked past Thor and opened the door. “I will retrieve the stone for you tomorrow. You may stay in your old chambers tonight if you wish to.”
“Yeah. Okay.”
“Because you’re staying out of the fight, kid.”
“Yeah, that is fucked up.”
Tony shrugged. “Ask the universe. I don’t know its secrets.”
The Incident: As he was about to receive the throne of Asgard, the Aesir's ultimate enemy the Jotunns attacked. He led a war against them that ravaged their city in Asgard. Thor was then banished from Asgard and sent to Earth without his powers in order to learn a lesson of grace and humility, so he would be worthy of the hammer Mjolnir again. This led to him discovering his brother Loki had set him up, determined to outshine his brother. It was also discovered Loki was adopted, the son of a Jotunn kidnapped when they were children for a war alliance. Loki let go of the Bifrost and fell to the abyss, leaving them all stranded on Asgard and mourning.
“You’re brutal, is what you are.”
The first thing that happened to Natasha when she and Karen were dropped off at school was get rocks thrown at her. From the roof of the science building. She rolled her eyes, told Karen she'd see her later, and found her way to the roof, which she wasn't supposed to know about or be on, but fuck rules.
This one's a long one. Sorry, guys. But at least all the action and fighting is this one, so you all get to finally see the Avengers fight Thanos. Archive warning applies to this chapter, obviously, since there's fighting.
Once Tony and Steve made their way to the hospital, they went straight to Bucky’s room. The only two people currently in the room were Natasha and Peggy, and since the hit and run incident both had been informed of the crazy world jumping fiasco happening. Granted, Natasha already knew and had met the other Tony when they had switched places.
Clint shrugged. “Maybe. I’m leaving a lot of tonight’s mission up to Frank and Wade, though. They don’t have any problems getting their hands dirty.”
"What about Peggy?" Steve almost silently asked.
"Hey, Nat?" he yelled from the stairs.
"Wait, Jarvis died?" Tony asked, eyes wide in alarm.
“Ow!” he complained.
Clint made his descent down from his perch, being fast but cautious as he came down. When his feet touched the soil, he raced over to the rest of the Avengers. He passed Natasha’s body on the way over, and fought with himself not to glance over at her ruined form. He pressed down the urge to vomit at the thought of his best friend, just discarded on the ground, her chest ripped open, exposing her inner workings. But he had a mission, and he would grieve for her later.
“Well, my best friend is Clint Barton—”
Loki is featured in this one. You're welcome, Loki fans.
Natasha slept fitfully that night. When she woke up the next day, the sun was shining through her curtains. She checked her cell phone, which had been horrifyingly dead when she got home to it last night. She had plugged it in for power and was assaulted with a bunch of calls and texts from her friends. She sent a few texts to Matt, Clint, Karen, and Foggy, and waited for them to respond back as she descended the stairs towards the kitchen.
Tony blinked. “Right. That’s…really weird.”
“But why? You totally love me! We’re best friends, even in this totally non superhero universe!”
“Mr Rogers, good to see you awake. Thanos is on his way. Mr Stark has asked me to have you all awake and ready to fight.”
“Thor has a sister? Does he know this?”
A couple minutes later, the comms were back up. “Steve, you ready?” Tony asked.
“I can’t do it without physical contact,” she said. “I’ll need to be right there, where my magic can reach his mind.”
Russian for "shell head." That's Tony's nickname in the comics when he's in the Iron Man costume. She also called him shell head in Age of Ultron.
“Are you sure you’re not just projecting?”
In the end, he decided it didn’t matter. People have to make tough choices in war. Sometimes it’s the right one, and sometimes it’s the wrong one. Only time would tell. Steve just had to weigh the pros and cons, really look inside himself, and come to a conclusion and stick with it. It’s the only thing he could do in this sort of situation.
"Of course I remember Jarvis! He was my butler growing up! When I went off to college I left him behind but I always kept in touch with his family. We get together every Christmas."
“Glad to know I’m a badass in multiple universes.”
Matt laughed. "That's what growing up with nuns will do to you."
“And Matt?” Tony asked. “What about him?”
Tony cleared his throat and clapped his hand together. “So, shall we go visit Loki? See what he’s up to?”
“It was different. You and Dad aren’t together in that world.”
“Wait, something happened when you touched it?”
“So we’re like super cool superheroes? The Avengers?”
She sighed shakily. “Yeah, apart from the fact my relationship is probably over, I’m good.”
the adopted one, not Loki.”

, but it made Steve positive that if he were to make an honest woman out of Ms Potts someday, he would indeed be a wonderful father in the future.
Bucky furrowed his eyebrows. "Daddy, what's cal-coo-lus?" he asked, mispronouncing the word.
“No, can’t say I do.”
Her dad still had the ability to scare her and she had no clue how. Steve was 5'4 and weighed practically the same amount as she did, and yet he still made her swallow in fear when they had serious discussions. "Sorry," she said.
He sighed. “I know. And your dad and I will help you deal with it. And then you’ll be grounded. For like, the rest of your life.”
Natasha looked at Tony with wide eyes. “S.H.I.E.L.D. exists in your universe? They’re some kind of secret government facility?”
"Oh, he's my best friend. Our son is named after him, actually."
"So about last night..." he started.
“I’m sorry, but no,” Thor said. “I agree. We already have Thanos in our clutches. We cannot risk him escaping.”
Steve swallowed as Tony came into view. This Tony was an absolute wreck. His hair was sticking up at all ends, like he’d endlessly been running his hands through it, tearing it out in worry and frustration. His normally carefully pressed suit was missing the jacket. His shirt was pushed up onto his forearms, his buttons were undone, and the blue was marred by blood soaked onto the front of him. His eyes were bloodshot and the rims were red, and Steve didn’t think he’d ever seen someone so utterly wrecked in his entire life.
That answer came three weeks later when Steve moved something on one of Tony's lab desks and accidentally knocked over a small yellow stone.
Steve rolled his eyes. “What are we doing?”
Age: 45
“Yeah, I do. So much I’m gonna let you watch me scare the pants off of me playing
“Well, I’m happy she’s getting the help she needs. Fuck, I think we all need therapy after what we’ve all been through.”
“Then who can inform me if this alien can be contained or not?”
Current Whereabouts: Asgard
“Okay. Does anyone know if this has happened before? Thor and Loki both told me that their mother used to tell them the story of the infinity stones as a bedtime story. If this story has been around a long time, then someone has tried to control all of the stones before Thanos. If we can find a story about another botched attempt, we could see how they defeated this person and use it to our advantage.”
Tony stared at him. Clint believed him? "Uh, none of the above, actually."
The team found themselves drawn to each other that night, doing what they normally did on a night when they were all stuck together: make food, gather around the living area, and watch some good movies. Clint had found the fridge stocked with beers and Steve busies himself making a dish he knew everyone would enjoy, and they all gathered around, waiting for Tony to make his presence known.
Thor set off that night to Knowhere with a newfound love for his brother, and a hope that one day he wouldn’t mend their relationship, but rather build it into something better in the future.
Tony was silent. Then, “Rhodey does. I met him in college, so he was there when my parents died, when I went off the deep end. He always saw past the mask. He called me out on my shit. He was the one that would sit up with me when the nightmares got bad, or help me control my breathing when I had a panic attack. He’s the first person who’s ever told me he didn’t want my money, he just wanted to hang out with me, and that was enough.”
“I guess. Probably he can. I’ve got a sizable piece of land I bought a few years back. It was supposed to be a secluded area for weapons testing back when I was still in the weapons business, but never actually built anything. It’s just a flat 600 acres or so of easy terrain for us to fight him on. We could easily get there and wait for him to come to us.”
Thor knocked on the door and waited for Loki to open the door for him. The door opened and Thor blinked, the face of his father glaring back at him. So Loki had shapeshifted into the guise of their father. He always was clever.
Tony chuckled.
“But whyyyyy?” Clint complained.
Pepper. Okay? I just…found him like that. It’s fucking sickening. Who does that? Who leaves a five year old fucking bleeding in the street like that? Who’s so fucking heartless like that?”
“I can travel back to Asgard and ask around,” Thor said. “Heimdall sees all. Surely he knows there this other stone is.”
“There was trauma?”
Finally they were outside, entering one of Fisk’s endless supplies of limousines fitting for the occasion. Clint mentally jotted down the license plate in case something went wrong, and watched the car pull away and out onto the streets of Manhattan. He followed Natasha’s location on his bike, careful to keep a look out for the limo in the traffic while doing so. He followed them to an abandoned warehouse in Hell’s Kitchen. Probably one of the places they were manufacturing the drugs.
“No,” she said. “Absolutely not. If I’m alive, there’s a greater risk of you all not capturing Thanos.”
"It's a school night," Steve said.
“Your boyfriend text you back yet?”
“You’re not going to do it,” Tony said. “You don’t have all the stones. And there’s no way in hell that you’re getting all of them.”
“Okay, so problem solved.”
Name: Thor Odinson
This is a somewhat shorter section, but I make up for it hopefully later when it comes time to battle Thanos. Me, unlike the movies, actually tries to establish WHY Tony and Steve have tension surrounding them and what they can do to fix it an be friends like they are in the comics. I don't know why the movies did what they did, but whatever. I attempt to fix that, so this is kind of a scene that attempts to do that a little bit.
Thor wanted to argue that his brother had let go of the Bifrost that day, and not that he’d pushed him, but arguing at this point was futile. He would not let Thanos get to him. He had to stay levelheaded and not let his temper make him decide rashly, like he always did. He had to focus today. So he bit back any comment he could have made to the contrary and simply said, “We shall see who wins, Thanos.”
“Maybe,” she said. She spent a few more seconds analysing the stone with her magic before she dropped her hand and the red energy disappeared from the air. “I’m not sure the stones can be destroyed,” she told him.
“Uh, excuse you!” Tony spluttered.
they looked, how Skinny Steve didn’t seem at all bothered by all of the things that he is, somehow he knew that the Tony in his reality belonged back here, and it wasn’t just a weird hallucination. It was real, and this world meant something to this Tony.
“It’s not your fault,” Tony said. “It’s Thanos’s.”
"Like two seconds of it. It's called a crop top, dad."
“That sounds really fucking awful. No offense.”
“Are you okay?” Natasha’s voice cracked over comms system. She’d grimaced as she watched the footage from Tony’s HUD display, still annoyed she couldn’t be there to wipe that stupid smirk off that purple asshole’s face.
Clint made a sound of protest. “Uh uh. Fuck that. Your brother used that sceptre thing to mind control me into working for him. He’s not getting off the hook just because someone bigger and badder than him got their hooks into him. He’s still responsible for his actions. He’s still getting an arrow to the eye next time I come face to face with him.”
on the TV. He turned the TV off and stared at the group as they slept, wondering how his slip up last night was going to affect everyone in the house.
“Do not feel pity for me. Your only crime is your ignorance. Here, take the stone and stop Thanos.”
“Fuck backup,” Clint said. “I’m gonna use that stone to kill that motherfucker and spread his body all over space.”
“Target practice with Clint.”
“Why, for power, of course,” Thanos said, like it was the most obvious answer in all of the multiverse.
“Wow.” Natasha shook her head. “Dare I say you two are friends now?”
this responsibility, but continued on nevertheless. If no one else was going to do it, Clint was damn sure going to stand up and do it. Even if he was just a dude who learned how to shoot an arrow by circus man who then tried to kill him and turned his brother against him. He would always make the decision to fight over everything else, and he hoped to all the possible gods that they recognised that.
“Let me guess, the mission went awry.”
“Noted. Natashas?”
“No prob, Natasha. You ready to go?”  Clint held out his hand for her to take, and with one last deep breath, they were out the door and on the way to completing their first mission.
Her door opened. "Yeah?" she asked, walking towards the stairs.
That just meant they were going to have to use their infinity stones and take full advantage of their powers, just like they had practiced. The soul stone didn’t really help Natasha any. It really just gave her the ability over life and death, to the place between the living and the dead. She could call on lost and dead souls and get advice from them, but she hadn’t learned how to bring them back to the living yet. It didn’t really give her any special advantage. It wasn’t a problem for her, though. She had her weapons, her fists, and her mind, and she knew the others could use their stones to trick Thanos.
"Nooo," Bucky whined.
“Good idea,” Steve said, while he and Natasha followed Wanda into the elevator and up to the common area.
Details rushed through his brain, details of his life that seemed a million miles away after that super realistic dream he had just had. He saw images of him and Steve, when they met freshman year in a political science course. They married five years later, after Tony's father had died, and he'd inherited the old man's company, the legacy that he was destined for. He remembered Steve was an artist. He ran a museum in downtown New York, where the couple lived with their two kids. They had a daughter, Natasha, who was 17 and a spitfire. And their five year old son, James, named after his best friend Rhodey who was away in the Air Force, who looked at his father like he hung the moon. They were a normal, happy family. Not superheroes. Not broken. Not saving the world one alien or robot at a time.
“Really, how
“Yeah, the one and only. You remodelled it after grandpa died and changed it from a weapons manufacturer to a clean energy resource facility.”
Parents Names:
Clint nodded. "She's not taking it well."
Sidenote: the colours associated with the infinity gems/stones vary from comic to comic and are also different in the MCU. In the comics, it’s more common that the reality stone is yellow, however in MCU it’s the red stone (aka the Aether). This means that logically the reality stone should be the one in Knowhere with the Collector, but as I gave the reality stone to Tony & Co. and since at the time of writing this no one knew where the last stone was, I made the last stone be the one Thor gave to the Collector. And on a further note, I didn’t include Dr Strange or the Guardians in this story, so one of these stones is collected by the Avengers and another is collected by Thanos. So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.
Birthday: January 7, 1971
“Yep. Missed you that much.”
"Dad!" Natasha complained.
Tony snapped his fingers. "It's settled then! We're watching
Natasha sighed heavily and the glass clanked against the counter as she set it down. "
Natasha smirked. "I'm sure I can talk my way out of any trouble. But that reminds me, my dads want to meet you. Tonight...for dinner?"
Occupation:
“Are you calling Fury?” he asked.
“Can any cell hold him?” he asked Clint.
"No, she's adopted."
“Do you know the story of Titan, my son?” Thanos asked, no longer kneeling at eye level with Tony, but rather sitting in the inky black void.
“We have,” he said. “Or we’re close to it.”
Steve and Tony looked at each other again. They knew there was more to the story than that, but they kept their mouths shut.
“It’s the only way to find out for sure, sir,” Clint chimed in.
Steve sighed. He didn’t want to watch a movie when he could be doing something useful. He didn’t really know what he could do that would be useful, but he was itching to do something. He’d been sitting still for too long. But Clint was right. Tony had taken Natasha on a tour of the tower in order to distract her while he waited. Thor was off to Asgard to search for the other stones. There was nothing to do but be useless.
“Night, Natasha.”
She was clinging to him so tightly she didn’t notice that her Tony and the other world Tony had locked eyes. The other Tony saluted to her dad and her dad nodded and thanked the other Tony. He disappeared back to his world without another word.
“We need to come up with a plan before the rest of us get murdered,” he said.
Siblings and Other Family:
“What are you doing here?” she asked him.
“Thanos,” the green one said, a scowl on her face as she looked up at her father.
“Coming alone against all of us, are you?” Tony taunted, displaying a bravado he definitely did not feel inside.
He braced himself and waited for this figure to make their way to him before sizing the figure up. Tony had to crane his neck upwards to take in the figure. He was a tall alien with purple skin and a weird, deformed looking chin. Tony wasn’t sure what race of alien this creature was supposed to be, or who this even was, and he was slightly terrified. He wasn’t like the other Tony, or the buff Steve he had encountered. He came from a world without magic and without superheroes or aliens or anything mystical whatsoever. He wasn’t sure how to process the idea that the multiverse really existed, and within this multiverse held millions of different universes where the mystical was a normal occurrence.
"I'll be okay. Is Karen all right?"
"I created an artificial intelligence?"
“What did happen there, Natasha?”
The bell rang and they both groaned. Natasha walked Matt to his classroom. "I'll see you at lunch," she said. "Probably. If Clint doesn't want me."
“Can I ask her questions?”
It was a few days later and Steve hadn’t exactly gotten the courage to discuss his friendship failings with Tony, but he had taken time to be more understanding of the genius, the situation they were in, and actually heard him and his theories out instead of jumping to conclusions and automatically opposing everything. Sometimes it was hard to Steve to bite his tongue and not comment on some of Tony’s less than savoury things he had to say—what could Steve say, something about Tony’s personality still rubbed him the wrong way. He chalked it up to growing up in a different time period than the other man—but all in all it was necessary they at least try to get along if they were all going to work together to defeat Thanos.
“And you? How are things with Virginia?”
It was a regular afternoon they found themselves in, bouncing around theories together.
Natasha rolled her eyes and flipped him off.
Thanos blinked at the appearance of both his daughters, like he couldn’t even believe was his eyes were seeing. “Gamora,” he said back.
Natasha thought about going after him, but then decided he needed to cool down. Besides, she was probably the last person he needed to see. If only Phil Coulson were alive, they’d have someone to diffuse the situation. Coulson was always good at talking both her and Clint down from a ledge when they needed it. It’s what made him such a great handler. Alas, that was gone and done, no thanks to Loki.
“Tony?” The younger Natasha said almost right away.
“Three yeses, three nos,” Tony informed them. “Clint, what are your thoughts?”
Natasha sniggered over the comms link.
Tony snorted. “Yeah, well, it gets even more fucked up when you hear it was my father Howard that worked on the project that made Steve into a living sculpture.”
"How goes things?"
“I can tell you right now he’s not going to be in favour of it,” the older Natasha said.
“It was mostly S.H.I.E.L.D.’s doing. You and Barton were working as agents, Banner and I got roped into being consultants, and Thor showed up because his brother was literally trying to rule Earth. We’ve been kind of stuck together ever since.”
"Oh. Okay." Tony giggled. He didn't know why that was so funny.
Natasha squeezed his hand. "You will. You want to keep the cane with you or do you want to keep it up here?"
оболочки глава (obolochki glava)," she said.
Wanda was seething with anger, but was careful not to let her magic consume her before she could use it on the Titan. She wanted to punch a hole in his heart, rip it out with her bare hands like she had done with Ultron. She lost her family, her place in this world, and the only thing she had left to fight for was the others just like her, struggling and treading water in a world that was falling apart. She was just trying to make the world a little easier to exist in. And she would take all of that hurt and anger and confusion that had built up inside her over the years, and pour it into the fight with Thanos. That ugly bastard wouldn’t know what hit him.
before, but when working on experiments I know how to handle things as slowly, delicately, and accurately as possible. This might take days of being out of commission while I work on your neurons, Vision. You’re gonna be offline for a while. That okay with you?”
That was the last thing Jane wanted. Thor went back to Asgard and there was no telling when she was going to see her elusive boyfriend again.
Thanos frowned, but didn’t push Thor any further. He was stronger than he’d ever been at this point, stronger than all of the Avengers combined, and he would take them down, no matter what. Being defeated wasn’t an option.
“Okay. We’ll deal with all of this stuff tomorrow. Go get a good night’s sleep, okay?”
Thor put his hammer down on the ground and crouched next to Tony, studying the man. “I do not understand. You and the Captain are not married in this world? You are dating Miss Potts.”
Current Whereabouts: New York, New York
“I thought you said violence wasn’t the answer.”
Lovers:
“I’ve got my science, I’ve got my Rhodey, my Pep, my Brucie…isn’t that enough?”
“Sooooo, another movie night until the others come back with info?” Clint asked.
Steve hit his husband's arm. "What did she say?"
“And Wade?”
“I guess that’s my cue?” Clint said over the comms.
“Uh, no!”
“He is?” she asked. “How’s he doing?”
Steve closed the sketchbook in his lap and stood up from the couch, nodding his head.
“Except everything going on with my friends.”
"No, we live here in New York, the Stark mansion. It wasn't a tower in my world."
And so he did. Tony didn’t know how he did it, but above their heads, an aircraft came into view. It came down to Earth and landed in the space not far from where their battle was taking place. Two women exited the spacecraft and walked towards them. One of them was a woman with green skin and a look on her face that seemed displeased with her surroundings. The other woman had blue skin, and looked like she was made of little different bits of machinery. Tony got FRIDAY to scan her, and found out she was indeed made up of mechanical pieces that had replaced her real body parts. He couldn’t even begin to guess why. He was pretty sure he didn’t
Natasha's phone buzzing woke her up the next morning at an ungodly hour. Her mouth felt like cotton balls and her head was just as fuzzy, but she answered it anyway. She didn't want it to wake Karen up. "'Lo?" she whispered.
"So I'm...what? Skinny Steve there? Five foot four with enough medical issues to fill a whole book?"
Beyond annoyed. I had the entire chapter on here and then my laptop (which won't work unless it's plugged it because the battery is messed up) unplugged itself and turned off in the middle of me checking for typos or anything and conveniently all of the text was missing, so I had to redo all of it. Thank the gods I just had to copy and paste from Word, but all the minor edits I made are gone so I had to read through the entire chapter again and make the necessary edits again. Not cool.
“Well, congratulations! I always knew you’d do something great with your life.”
"Nah, man, not a lot of time to watch movies when you're a kid in the circus and when you're out on missions for weeks at a time."
Natasha and Clint shared a look. Clint nodded his head a bit and Natasha bit her lip. “We’re going after Fisk.”
“It could be true,” Natasha piped in. “When we were all on the Helicarrier and arguing with each other, that was the mind stone trying to control us. None of us were even touching it and it was still trying to influence us, just by being in the same room as it.”
"Oh, so I'm back in foster care, yeah?"
Steve shrugged. “It’s worth a try.”
“We’ll be fine, promise.”
Natasha sighed, defeated. "Fine. I'll ask him at school today. But please be nice. And for the love of God, please don't stare too much."
“Why do you want the stones?” Tony asked instead of voicing his thoughts.
you, as you said, you never said no to anything I asked you to do. I’ve conquered worlds before, and you even helped me. You stood by my side for years. Why is now any different, Nebula?”
Parents Names:
—Steve, of all people—and his two kids was the most awkward thing Tony had ever experienced. He didn’t know how the hell he survived it. He had gotten used to his version of Natasha, and it was less weird, but every time he saw tiny Bucky—just a baby, for Christ’s sake—all adorable, and not evil, and happy, he couldn’t stop thinking about the footage he’d seen in his universe of the man with long, greasy hair and a metal arm that went around killing things for sport.
“Hmm.” The purple alien bent down in order to be eye level with Tony. He cocked his head to the side. “What have you got there?” he asked.
Clint watched from his perch, firing all his remaining arrows into Thanos, because that’s the only thing he really could do. They weren’t going to kill him, but at least he could make him feel a little bit of pain. He watched Steve unwaveringly keep smashing his shield into Thanos’s face over and over and over again. He watched Tony sitting on Thanos’s arm, trying not to fall off while also trying use an energy laser to sever the gauntleted hand off. He watched Thor grab Wanda and fly his hammer into the sky, getting her within reach of Thanos’s mind. Her scarlet magic rippled in the air, and Clint saw Thanos go completely still for a couple of seconds, and then slightly move, struggling against Wanda’s magic.
“He can’t kill all of us,” she reasoned. “Besides, we probably won’t even get close to him. We’re trying to get information out of Wesley.”
"Does it have to do with Matt? Some reason why he's never around? Why you don't want us to meet him? He's not secretly a drug addict, is he?"
“Bye, guys. Please stay safe.”
“Maybe she did,” he mused. “Well, your dad and Bucky are in the activities room if you want to go say hi to them.”
Here was the thing Tony Stark was angsting over: everything
“Not yet. We have to take a vote,” he said. Tony didn’t sound thrilled about it.
“Damn, Fury is really recruiting them young this time. I think I’m gonna yell at him about that when I get back to my own world.”
There was a beeping sound at Tony’s console.
“Sup,” Tony said, lifting a hand to wave, but keeping his eyes on whatever he was working on. “Good to see you again.”
“Yes, even Tony.”
“I don’t think so, or he would have mentioned it.”
Vision didn’t much care for fighting the humans’ war. After all, he wasn’t really human. He was just a synthezoid, creating from a mix of J.A.R.V.I.S.’ consciousness and Ultron’s metal manipulation. His only stake in the war was Wanda. It was…strange. But Vision felt something different for her than the rest of the humans. He couldn’t really put a place on it. All of is supplemental research told him it was romantic feelings, but he didn’t honestly know the different between platonic and romantic relationships, or how to navigate them. He tried to explain that to Wanda last night, and she had simply smiled at him, taken his cold metal hand in hers, and told him she would teach him. He was fighting for her, and the other Avengers who had taken him in and taught him kindness. No, this war wasn’t his, but he would fight it nonetheless. For her. And for the possible future with her.
Still, she was strong enough to keep him mostly still, and that was enough for Tony to cleanly cut off Thanos’s hand, gauntlet and all. If Thanos had had control of his mind, Clint was sure he would have been screaming in pain. He hoped it really fucking hurt.
“What about, dear
“Okay, Steve, it’s up to you. You think you can go back to that precise moment?”
“Love you too,” she said back.
“Cool beans. Anyone done any research on the Titan race?”
Tony laughed. "Actually, I think you're crushing on some guy named Pietro, but he has a girlfriend."
Steve frowned. "Why would I stare?" he asked after her, but she was already halfway up the stairs and away from him. He shook his head and got started on making breakfast for his kids.
His eyes then slid to Thor, clutching Mjolnir tightly in his fist. “Thor!” he said jovially. “It’s a pleasure to finally meet you. Your brother Loki told me so many things about you when he came to me, sick and injured after he fell from the void you pushed him off of. The secrets he told me about you…” Thanos tsked and shook his head at the same time. “Well, let’s just say I know your tells. It’ll make defeating you an absolute pleasure.”
Name: Natalia Alivanovna Romanova
“Then there’s the Maximoff twins--”
“No, I bet you couldn’t image we would ever get along, could you, Thanos? After years of pitting us against each other, years of us fighting for your affection and attention. You wanted us to hate each other.”
“Yeah, some purple dude I met when I touched that stone back at Loki’s.”
Natasha's eyes softened. "He's just an old friend I was dropping by to say hello to. Please leave him alone."
“Carter?”
“I don’t want to go,” she said.
“Never thought I’d see him settle down.”
“No,” Natasha said. “I don’t think he was—” she was interrupted by the sound of their doorbell ringing.
Steve chuckled. "That's funny. Me with super strength? I don't think I'll ever be super strong. Still little old Steven Rogers, the skinny asthmatic kid you somehow happened to fall in love with."
Tony Stark.
“Good to be home,” she murmured.
Birthday: Unknown
Steve looked at his husband with a bemused look. "Well, we definitely have a teenage daughter," he said.
"Aye aye,
“Yes,” Clint said. He was desperate.
“Who taught you to be so smart?”
"Awesome. I'll be down in my workshop if you need me."
“Then we’ll do it. Steve?”
“Or all the more reason for you to defy him and help make sure we win the war against him.”
“I appreciate the vote of confidence.”
Karen shook her head. "Nah, stole some of Dad's liquor on the way out. Should dull the pain enough."
No, Natasha stayed until everyone was alive, well, and recovered from the fight with Thanos. Only then did she feel she could safely leave this strange world behind and go back to her own home.
“Who the fuck knows, Steve? But we’ve gotta try something.”
The Incident: She met Bucky Barnes, aka the Winter Soldier, when he was handed over from HYDRA to the Soviets during the Cold War. He helped train the girls in the Red Room and was tortured and his mind manipulated in the process. He and a young Natasha fell in love and were punished for it with sterilisation. After he completed his missions, they were going to put Bucky back on ice until he was needed again. His last act before being frozen was breaking Natasha out. She ran away, got married to a crime lord in order to survive, killed and stole her way through Russia and the US, an assassin for hire, until Agent Clint Barton, sent to kill her for her crimes, chose to take her in and make her an agent instead.
“Okay,” he said quietly. “Then that’s settled.”
She sighed. “Yeah, I know.”
Thor ended the hug and Tony breathed a sigh of relief now that he could breathe again.
“Look, we came up with a plan.”
"I don't know,” Jane said. "You'll have to ask Tony when he's sober and willing to talk about it. This is as much as we know since finding him last night. We're gonna work on a way to send him back. I thought I would have an answer sooner so things would go back to normal, but as usual Tony can't keep his big mouth shut."
Also, Google translate did all the Russian for me, as I don't actually speak the language. So if my translation is wrong, blame Google. And also let me know so I can fix it, please!
And he told everyone! This was what he was worried about! This was why he built Ultron! He was trying to save the world from that thing that had been inside his mind—that thing that was probably inside Loki’s mind as well, using him as a pawn. The poor bastard hadn’t been the Big Bad they defeated. That thing was still out there, waiting. Tony fucking
"It's Steve. And your manners are excellent."
Steve snorted. “Really?”
“You do not know all the details of what has been done to him, friend Clint,” Thor said tiredly.
“Yes, I have the stones,” Thor confirmed. He took them out of his pocket and set them on the table in front of them. The three stones were coloured purple, green, and orange. “I do not know their powers, but your FRIDAY can tell us, can she not?”
The Incident: As a graduate student in college, Bruce was working on a project in his school's lab. He and other scientists were trying to recreate the effects of Project Rebirth using gamma radiation. Bruce volunteered to experiment on himself. The experiment backfired and an explosion rocked the lab. Bruce was then split into his human side and when he became angry, a green beast intent on death and destruction named Hulk formed. Hulk has limited intelligence, understanding, and verbal skills. He has been on the run ever since.
Another thing hard to process for Tony? The idea of him being in a relationship with someone other than Steve. While it was clear Steve was single and adjusting to 21st century life, Tony's file told a different story. What kind of weird universe was it that let him and Pepper have a relationship? Like, who let him sleep with Pepper? Not that she was awful, by any means, it's just...he and Pepper had been best friends ever since they met in college and she was the only person he could turn to when his parents died, and they were just...friends, nothing more. Sleeping with her seemed like...such an awkward thing.
"Yeah? What are you colouring?"
“I have your stone,” he said. “Do you know where the others you seek are?”
Karen sighed again and sat down on Nat's bed. She followed. "Foggy...doesn't understand. He has a good life. A normal family. Lots of prying sisters and a mom who actually gives a shit. It's good to have that kind of support from his family, but...I don't know, sometimes it's just too much for me to handle, you know? I don't want everyone in my business about it."
“Are you okay?” Her dad asked.
And that's how the group of Avengers relaxed for the day before setting off on trying to send Tony back to his world and figuring out why he was sent here in the first place.
“We’ll keep him in check.”
Tony shuddered. “He reminds me of Howard,” he whispered.
“Long time, no see, Nat,” Clint said.
Matt shrugged. “When you shut down Fisk, there wasn’t anyone else willing to take over his drug runs. Karen couldn’t pretend like she wasn’t an addict anymore, and realised she needed help. The situation with her parents still isn’t a good one, but Foggy’s family agreed to let her live with them until the foreseeable future.”
“Really?”
Steve sighed heavily and rolled his eyes. “Yes, Tony, you were right. Are you satisfied?”
I swear I wrote this before I saw Endgame. So the fact that I tied Natasha to the soul stone like in the movie is a complete coincidence. Also, you can thank me for NOT having Steve go back in time in order to be with Peggy and screwing up her whole damn future because...what even was that plot point?
"Okay," Steve said. "So what else is different about our worlds? I mean, are all of our lives completely different? Our childhoods, our relationships, everything?"
Natasha rolled her eyes. "No, Daddy, not with Matt. Why do you guys always think I'm talking to him? I have other friends too, you know."
Thor frowned. “Why not?”
“Great. So we won’t know anything until Thor gets back with the stones and we can scan them for their powers. Awesome. I hate being useless and not having all the information.”
“The last time I spoke to Thanos,” Tony said, “was by touching the reality stone, and it transported me into some kind of void where I got to see him. Maybe if I focus on that again, I’ll be able to seek him out wherever he is, and make him come to us.”
He heard someone choke trying not to laugh, a thud, and then a pained groan, and Tony really needed to know what was going on. "Why am I drunk?" he asked, finally opening his eyes to see a blurry haze of people staring at him.
“Yep.”
Wanda shrugged. “We can manage.”
"Nat, it's not that big of a--"
Which is the first thing they did after making sure Tony was breathing and wasn't going to die of alcohol poisoning. They sat them both down in the communal kitchen, Avengers staring at the two others in silence, until Natasha finally spoke.
“You’re the brains of this operation. I have a suit that protects me, and Steve’s a super soldier. And to be honest, I don’t trust anyone else. This all started with me going to that alternate universe where we’re all a family. It started with us, and I want it to end with us. Is that okay?”
“We’ll be fine.”
Childhood: Clint's parents ran a drug front from their farm in Iowa. When they got into a disagreement with local crime lords, they were murdered. Clint's father was extremely abusive and controlling. Clint and his brother were put into foster care, but ran away after a few homes and joined the circus. Clint then trained with circus archer Trickshot into becoming a master of archery, unable to miss a shot.
“Yep, talking to the mayor.”
“Well, I was wondering if you can tell me about the stones, on the wall over there.” Tony nodded to the wall with six stones of all different colours. "Did the colours mean something special?”
The older Natasha ran her fingers over the stones on the table. “I’ll have the soul stone, if that’s okay.”
Wade Wilson's parents were scientists who, honest to God, did experiments. On their own son. One experiment backfired on them and set fire to the lab, which Wade was caught in. He had burns covering a lot of his body, which made him self-conscious and made people stare, so he made up for his discomfort by being a loudmouth jerk. But a loveable jerk. On occasion.
"Good deal," he said. "But I meant how goes things with you, personally."
"Okay, sorry."
“He’s dead?”
“That’s a first,” Clint grumbled, and the older Natasha dug an elbow in his side for it.
Tony shrugged. “Your guess is as good as mine. They seem happy, though, so either way, no skin off my nose.”
This Tony definitely sounded hurt, though. His voice was cracking, like it physically hurt him to get the words out.
“So, the Titans are an offshoot race of the Eternals. I guess they had some kind of fight with the Kree race and split off from them, settled down on an exoplanet called Titan, hence the name. They were originally a peaceful race that prospered and were science based, and then the leader died. Then the planet started to go into a famine, and in order to save the planet, half of the population was exterminated. They prospered again, and that was that.”
Asgard could have been in any state with his brother on the throne; Thor was not denying that his brother could be a little power hungry and generally didn’t always have everyone’s best interests at heart. However, he also knew Loki loved his home, and would never want grave harm to come to Asgard. Walking around and surveying the land, Thor had to admit that Loki on Asgard’s throne wasn’t much different from Odin’s rule. Heimdall had said Odin knew Loki was ruling, and Thor wouldn’t dare imagine his father would leave Asgard in his brother’s hands if he didn’t somehow trust him nor have his eye on the situation. This comforted Thor, and gave a new spark of hope in his chest that Loki had come to his senses and was trying to do some good in the world, in his own mischievous, slightly warped way. It meant there were redeeming qualities in him after all.
"Wanna talk about it?" Steve asked.
“Thank you for doing all the work for me, Stark. I knew you were a smart one, gathering all the stones for me. All I have to do is pick you ants off one by one and then…” Thanos snapped his fingers. “You’ll all dissipate into dust.”
kill him,” Tony said. “I don’t think we’re capable of it.”
"I would think not. I bet their dad is having a meltdown, too."
Childhood: Tony's childhood was very lonely. His mother was depressed and his father was an abusive alcoholic who would rather work than pay attention to his son. Tony grew up in the hands of their butler, Edwin Jarvis, until his death due to old age. Tony grew up self loathing, following in the footsteps of his father. He put an act on for the media of a self indulging asshole, but showed a story of hating himself and depression behind the curtains.
“No freaking way! See, I told you things would work out! What happened?”
He led Steve to the garage and unlocked the doors to his 2010 Porsche Cayenne Turbo S and he drove in silence to Loki’s magic shop, a place he’d been dozens of times to drop in and just say hi to Natasha while she was working.
That night Tony took her home so she could shower, change, and sleep in her own bed for a change. He and Steve were taking shifts, switching who slept with Bucky at the hospital every other day so the other could take a breather and refresh. Natasha was immensely happy to be in her own space again, with her own clothes and her own room.
"I'm so sorry."
“Yeah.”
"Good! Sounds great. We should have a movie marathon and eat lots of junk food! I need something to distract me from this world. I sure hope movies are the same.
Clint grinned.
“Yeah, I do.”
“Does Steve know you’re not destroying the stone?” He was gonna be pissed if he found out Tony kept different rules for himself and not the other Avengers.
. You’ll love it, Steve.”
"Why does Tony think he's married to Steve and that he's in another world?"
“I’ll give you Asgard,” Thor told him.
Steve nodded. “Our worlds are really different.”
“Um, hi,” the younger one said.
Natasha snorted. "It doesn't run in my family. Adopted, remember?"
"Drinking?"
“Fuck. Is he going to be okay?”
"Uh, hey guys, this is Matt. Matt, these are my dads, Tony and Steve."
"I'm totally dating someone hot, right?"
Steve swallowed, and placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “We can get her back,” he said.
After they chilled out for about a week, Tony hooked Vision up to a bunch of wires and put him a deep sleep so he could remove the stone without essentially killing the synthezoid.
He headed off towards the elevator doors but Steve deftly blocked his path before he could reach them. “Now, wait just a minute,” he said. “Taking the stone away from Vision will kill him.”
“Try me.”
Loki shrugged.  “Sure, be my guest.” He got the reality stone off the wall behind him and handed it to Tony.
“I want to rule,” he said, like it was simple and easy to follow. “I want to be their gods, and I want my daughters to be my side while I conquer.” He smiled at both of them. “My two girls, side by side. I thought I would never see the day.”
Tony’s chin wobbled, like he was trying to hold back tears.
“Yeah, I know him. We work together. We’re a group of superheroes called Avengers. We…avenge things, and stuff. Occasionally deal with aliens wanting to take over Earth.”
“Then go for it, Vision.”
“FRIDAY! What news do you have for me?”
Steve nodded, relieved.
"Cool, thanks!" She kissed Steve's cheek. "Hey Karen, the dads said it was cool," she said into the phone.
“You both had shitty fathers. That’s something that connected my dads together, knowing they shared that kind of hurt and understood what it’s like to carry the scars of emotional abuse. My Steve didn’t judge my Tony for that. And trust me, my Steve is opinionated and stubborn and is
She pursed her lips. "As far as I know, you're just friends. But I live in London nine months out of the year, so I could be wrong. Why don't you ask Steve when you see him later?"
“I know so. I’ve seen the way he acts with you. He’s head over heels for you. If he wants to make it work, he will. Give him some time.”
“You know I want to work in espionage someday,” she pointed out. “You’ve always known that.”
Tony rubbed at his forehead again. "This world is so different from my own. I had a simple life that was normal. A husband, two kids, a modest house in the suburbs. There wasn't magic or superheroes or anything like this. I work in clean energy, for fuck's sake! I'm environmentally friendly!"
Age: Unknown
When Tony woke up, he knew something was different. Everything was different. His lab was different. It was the same in some ways, but…there was no FRIDAY. No Iron Man suits. Nothing familiar like that. He didn’t understand. Had Pepper purged everything after their fight? Tony knew she was still upset about him being Iron Man, but he didn’t think she would go this far. They talked last night. Hell, they had smoothed things over. It was fine.
Natasha crossed her arms over her chest.
Tony snorted. "Yeah, I don't think any of us did. Makes you wonder if there's some version of us out there living a less crazy life. With like, world peace. No aliens invading. No people with superpowers. Nothing. Just a simple existence. You think a world like that exists?"
Clint got eyes on Natasha almost immediately. It wasn’t hard to find her in a crowd, with her flaming red hair on display. She was the most beautiful girl in this place. He often thought about if he had been straight, and if he and Natasha hadn’t started out as amazing friends, they would probably be together now. But that wasn’t a thought he could really entertain right now, not when they were in the middle of a mission.
Tony swallowed and nodded, but didn't trust himself to speak. He heard her move away from him and out of the kitchen, leaving him alone to finish washing the dishes and face the rest of the day.
“No lying.”
"I need you to sign this paperwork real quick before the meeting with the new investors. Just sign here and here." She whipped the files out from under her arm and pointed to the signature line on the sheets of paper. She clicked a pen and handed it over to Tony, who didn't even know what was going on or what he was supposed to be signing.
Loki nodded his head, still thumbing through the textbooks. “Do you really think the Avengers can beat Thanos?”
“I have a few.”
Natasha hit him on the back of the head again.
"Like, are we talking biological daughter, or..."
Wanda continued to glare at him, but didn’t argue any further. Natasha stayed to see Vision go under. She helped Tony painstakingly disconnect the neuron paths that kept the stone wired to his mainframe. After a long few hours, they were allowed to remove the stone without killing him. Wanda wouldn’t let either one of them touch him, and she removed the stone gently, with her scarlet magic guiding the way. Once it was removed, she and Tony loaded his mind back to his mainframe, making sure he worked the same as he did with the stone in.
“Not really,” Tony said.
Natasha had been dead on about Steve being arrogant and stubborn when he was mad. If Steve realised he was wrong about something, he still insisted he was right, because he didn’t want to wound his own pride. Steve knew he had key things to work on with himself, and maybe he was taking a lot of things out on Tony by not being a bigger person, by not admitting his own faults. Steve
Siblings and Other Family:
Tony blinked. "Wait, you haven't seen
“Because
Natasha shrugged. “I asked around for anyone who had any authentic Asgardian history books, did a little bit of hacking, and found something I wasn’t supposed to see. This sidekick Odin had? Was his daughter, Hela.”
“Will do.”
“Look, Nat, I know I’m not your dad. But I like you in my universe, and I like this version of you. And I like that some version of me gets to be happy and settle down and not be a total fuckup 24/7. So if I can save the whole universe and all of its realities from whoever it is that wants to take over, I’m gonna do it. Okay?”
Tony placed the stone back on the counter and thanked Loki for his time. He had to find a way to get Steve back to his universe so that he could warn the others that Thanos was coming.
He turned his attention back to Natasha and Clint. “You okay, Nat?” Clint asked.
Tony, he just didn’t understand him. They came from two different worlds.
And if she really wanted to impress him, she would hide all her personal feelings and learn how to get the mission done. It’s what she was good for. And she was going to pull it off without a hitch.
The second his fingers touched the stone, he was transported somewhere else. A world, or a void in between worlds, made of just infinite blackness as far as Tony’s eyes could see. He scanned around nervously, before his eyes saw a figure slowly walking towards him in the distance.
“Sure, маленькая птичка (malen'kaya ptichka). See you when the mission is over.”
are all the others?” Natasha asked.
Clint fell asleep that night listening to Pietro’s voice on the other line, grateful to have a friend like him.
“You’re in your lab, at home,” Natasha said, sitting down next to Tony. “I don’t know what suits you’re talking about or what FRIDAY is, but Pepper is at work, running your company.”
“I’m sorry I’m not more like your dad.”
Sidenote: the colours associated with the infinity gems/stones vary from comic to comic and are also different in the MCU. In the comics, it’s more common that the reality stone is yellow, however in MCU it’s the red stone (aka the Aether). This means that logically the reality stone should be the one in Knowhere with the Collector, but as I gave the reality stone to Tony & Co. and since at the time of writing this no one knew where the last stone was, I made the last stone be the one Thor gave to the Collector. And on a further note, I didn’t include Dr Strange or the Guardians in this story, so one of these stones is collected by the Avengers and another is collected by Thanos. So don’t hate me because details are inconsistent. Or that I use gem and stone interchangeably because I still have no conceivable idea why MCU felt the need to change it from gem to stone.
“I think there’s no going back to the old normal, but yeah, everything is safe.”
Steve peered back at Tony as they kept flying higher and higher, away from the scene below them. He couldn’t read Tony’s expression with the face plate in the way. “Uh, Tony?” he asked. “What are you doing?”
Jane smirked at her boyfriend.
Thanos smiled slowly, a big, ugly, devious grin that made Tony’s mouth go dry and his body shrink inward. The dude was terrifying.
“What did you do?”
“Well, fuck me. That’s something different. Who is it instead? Hill?"
“We’re prepared to fight you, to defeat you from taking over.”
"Pancakes and scrambled eggs. You want any?"
"Uh, what's this for again?" He asked.
Birthday: May 29, 1970
The Incident: When Trickshot used him to steal, Clint ran away from the circus and lived on the streets, pick pocketing to survive. He tried to steal from Agent Phil Coulson, who turned him into S.H.I.E.L.D., and thus began his training.
And Steve…Jesus,
Tony nodded.
Clint shrugged. “He’ll get over it.”
“Yeah, but even you have to admit it’s strange that another version of you and
Natasha watched the footage nervously from the compound, fidgeting in her seat. “Maybe it’s time you guys use the stones,” she said nervously. “Make him think he’s lost the infinity gauntlet, or transport him through time or to another part of space, or something.”
Steve cleared his throat. “Did something happen to Bucky?” he asked softly.
“I don’t know,” he whispered.
Natasha made a sound of protest. “Why can’t I come?”
Name: Robert Bruce Banner
Natasha laughed. “What about that Pietro?”
“Look, I had a shitty childhood, Nat. Nothing I did was ever good enough for my dad. And I don’t have a single clue why he hated me so much. I tried to do everything he wanted of me. I didn’t spend my childhood like a normal child, playing, I spent it all building things, trying to be as smart as my dad was, to prove to him his company would be safe in my hands someday. And you know what that got me? Nothing. My father taught me to hate myself. To assume everyone wanted something from me. To assume no one would love me for me, that I needed to put on an act. I used drugs and alcohol and sex because that’s what people
. I was chained to three rocks, unable to look away from the entrails of my dead son. Skadi placed a snake on top of my head and laughed as its venom dripped onto my face. I received this torture every day for months with little reprise.”
It didn’t take any of the Avengers long to settle in to their new base when they reached the land. FRIDAY was already wired to the bones of the property, and there was certainly enough space for all of them to carve out. They simply deposited their duffle bags where they pleased, made sure they had all of their costumes and playthings ready for when Thanos arrived, and then waited. Thanos was fighting them on their turf. They really had nothing to do but sit, contemplate, and see how long it would take the mad Titan to make his way down to Earth.
“Well, aren’t you my knight in shining armour.”
Tony didn’t know exactly how it happened. One second he was in the other world with the Avengers, Wanda carefully probing into his mind to see if anything magical could be done to send him back, and the next second there he was, at the playground. He had looked around to search for Bucky, memories of the other world he had just visited escaping from his mind, and that’s when the incident happened: a big, black SUV just came out of nowhere and hit his five year old son. He thanked all the gods of the universe that he hadn’t been completely run over, otherwise he would be planning for a funeral instead of waiting for him to recover from his injuries.
“Clint?” Pietro asked. “What’s wrong?”
"No, friend Tony, you built your own tower," Thor said, grinning like a mad man. He had never seen someone build just a powerful building before with their own two hands and the help of some robots. He'd seen his mother and brother use magic to build things, sure. But that was magic. Tony used science and mechanics.
"What? They asked. And they won't let it go, so I just figured we'd get it over with, if you want to."
"Yeah. I much prefer this reality," Tony admitted, pulling the smaller man in for a kiss.
Apologies for the two week delay. I already scheduled Sundays as my upload days. But then I went to go see a musical and it was like a weekend thing in a neighbouring place so I had to drive there and back. And then last Sunday I was at a funeral, so....yeah.
The girl (Natasha?) stared at him some more. “Dad,” she said calmly, “What happened? You were sober for longer than I’ve been alive. What…does Daddy know?”
"She's my best friend. We met when she was studying business at Harvard and we've been close ever since. She works for me and my company, and she married and divorced my head of security, Happy."
He thought about it for a while, none of the other Avengers pressuring him to make an announcement on his decision. Rather, they let him be, knowing the decision was weighing on him, and allowed him to fully think it all through.
“Loki is on Asgard?” Thor dared not get his hopes up at the thought of his brother still being close to home. He had thought his brother dead at one point, only to find out he had survived slipping into the void. He did not fall for that ploy again after Jane was possessed by the Aether. He knew his brother was alive and well, free from the chains that had once bound him. He had no idea his brother had stayed in Agard, however, as much as he hoped to have been able to speak with him again.
"I have my own tower?" Tony asked, incredulous.
Natasha scrunched up her nose. “No, I’m not.”
“Good to know. Then there’s my boyfriend Matt and his best friend Foggy, and our other friend Karen.”
“Safer for you here. I don’t have any security precautions out there like I do here in the tower.”
“I want him to burn. I want him to hurt. I want to rip his heart out like he did Natasha, pay for what he did to her.”
“Tell that to Frank. I think he wants to murder the whole world.”
“Which leaves, what? Time, space, power, and soul?”
"I don't know," Tony said honestly. "I'm assuming since Steve was never a part of that whole super soldier thing, he never tried to recreate the serum and the gamma accident never happened."
“Okay,” she said. “It won’t happen again. And for what it’s worth, I’m sorry for what happened between us, and I’m sorry I didn’t listen to what you were trying to say.”
“…The Nazi group?”
Parents Names:
Natasha watched as the Avengers vacated the tower, leaving her alone and a nervous wreck. She spun around in the chair she was sitting in half a dozen times. “Do you think this plan is going to work, FRIDAY?” she asked the AI.
Natasha parked herself at the island while Tony got to cooking. They lapsed into silence while he cooked and she watched, fascinated at his skills. She really
“He wants to murder half the world,” young Natasha said.
"Not now, Daddy, please."
“It’s in case anything goes wrong,” Tony said. “It’s better to have the neurons downloaded onto my network so that when we are finished with Thanos, we know we can easily remove the stone and keep Vision in one piece.”
“Thank you, brother.” He clasped Loki’s forearm and watched as his brother walked out of his room and down the corridor to his chambers.
Thor's posture deflated. "Right," he uttered morosely.
“I do. But you’re going to do it anyway. I’m trying to be supportive of the fact all my friends are in a super-secret club of future assassins.”
“Uh huh. And you were born in the 1940s and went through from kind of super soldier program during World War II that cured all of your illnesses and make you really buff and apparently hot. And then you were frozen in ice for 70 years and then came back to life.”
“Tony?” he said.
Steve swallowed, and backed away from the door, now feeling more like he was trespassing on a super intimate moment than spying to hear what Tony was saying about him. He grabbed his water cup from the counter in the communal kitchen and rode the elevator to his floor.
Wanda was glaring daggers at him the whole time. She gripped Vision’s hand tightly in hers, and didn’t let go, even though Vision was adamantly telling her he was going to be fine and that Tony knew what he was doing.
“Okay,” she muttered against his chest.
“I’m in the wrong world. I don’t know where this is, but in my world you’re not my daughter, you’re my colleague. And I’m Iron Man, and I’m dating Pepper, and this is all wrong. How the fuck did I get here?”
“Well,” Steve said, lips pursed. “I don’t think you’re gay my universe, either. You’ve been dating Pepper for a long time.”
“What are you talking about?”
Thanos turned to him, that signature half amused, half condescending smile stuck on his face. “Wouldn’t want to inconvenience you,” he said, before catching Tony off guard and punching him straight in the stomach with the gauntlet just because he could. He took pleasure in watching Tony double over in pain, choking on it, blood dribbling between his lips. Thanos had not pulled his punch, and, after all, he was the keeper of the strength gem.
"They're short."
Young Natasha smiled. “We come bearing news.”
“Yup,” Tony responded. “Want me to come over and get you?”
The two lapsed into silence for a minute, until Tony’s brain caught up with him. “I’m sorry, did you say
“I told him we had all the stones here on Earth, and we would fight him, take him out if he tried to get them. The dude
“I need you to use the soul stone and get him into space where he can’t go anywhere while we call for backup.”
Tony’s hands were shaking as he still held Steve in midair. Steve held on tighter to Tony, afraid of falling.
“Me too,” he murmured. “We all turned out okay, despite the circumstances. That’s a pretty big accomplishment, I’d say.”
Clint hated taking his eyes off Natasha, even for a second, but he scrambled from his place in the rafters and made his way to the roof. He quickly texted Frank with the info and waited for Natasha and Wesley to leave the venue and get in their car.
The other Avengers nodded.
“Sounds fair,” she said.
“I’d like to pop in and visit you from time to time, see how you’re doing. Promise you’re gonna do good things from now on, like
“I just need a moment to think,” he mumbled. “FRIDAY, turn off all comms except mine, Steve’s, and baby Natasha’s.”
He watched Natasha put on a seductive smile, and saunter over towards Wesley’s line of sight, and work her magic. Clint felt a bit like he was intruding on the moment, watching Natasha and Wesley interact. To make up for the lack of hearing, he’d become adept at reading lips, and could definitely understand everything Natasha was saying, even if he couldn’t see Wesley’s responses. It seemed like too personal of a conversation for him to encroach on, but he needed his eyes on Natasha. The boys had it handled with Fisk; Frank was looking out for Wade. Not that either of them thought Wade or Natasha needed backup, but it was better for them to be safer than sorry. Plus, Mr Pierce was watching all of them to be new recruits for S.H.I.E.L.D., and Clint was going to age out of the system soon, and he would be without his foster family or any money for a serious career, and this was his chance to do some good in the world, and not become his older brother.
“I am,” Tony said.
"Well, what's going on?" Steve asked. "I would really like to know why he thinks we're together."
“I’d love to,” she said.
"Jeez, Tony, maybe you need some lessons in anger management from the Hulk," his best friend, James Rhodes, said.
“We’re gonna be okay, right?” Clint asked.
“I liked him a lot,” Steve said.
To be fair, this wasn’t some stupid plan that her and her friends concocted out of nowhere. Natasha had hacked into some private government facility trying to find info on her adoption and her life back in Russia and she made a mistake. It got her on their radar. A few months ago, the leader came to her, told her he had been watching her and her friends and thought they had potential. He said all the right things to get her and her friends to do this mission, told them it was training, like they were interns. If they could do this kind of stuff, it would be a guarantee they would get a placement with S.H.I.E.L.D. once they graduated.
Natasha smirked. “I think we can do that.”
“Whatever.”
"Yeah," she answered slowly, the word dragged out.
"Please, Nat. Just...ease your dad's mind. I worry about who you spend your time with."
“No. He’s a robot, not a person.”
They practiced for what felt like forever to Tony, but in reality it probably wasn’t that long. Natasha sat down next to Matt, who handed her a bottle of water. She drank half of it, then turned to Clint. “You think I’m good enough for tonight?” she asked.
“Duh. I’m totally the best there is. He’d be crazy not to like me back, yeah?”
Known Affiliations:
“Then don’t save me.”
“Mind if I tag along?”
Like fuck you do, Tony thought.
Tony was downstairs mixing the pancake better when Steve grabbed his keys from the kitchen counter, Bucky holding on to his leg as he walked. "I gotta go to work, buddy," he said.
"Nothing." Was Tony not even nice to his own girlfriend? What kind of person was this Tony?
“Yeah, I got it. I’m sorry, Dad. This whole mess happened because I was trying to find out more about my birth parents and my life in Russia. I didn’t think I would get caught hacking into their files.”
“Natasha,” Tony said quietly.
“Same,” the younger one chimed in.
"Stark Tower. Or Avengers Tower. I'm not sure what you're calling it these days."
always coming to Tony, asking for him to fix their weapons or asking if he could make them new ones, and they didn’t even bat an eyelash at the amount of time, work, money, or resources it might cost Tony to do that. On top of being Iron Man, Tony also had his company to run, and wasn’t a full time superhero or agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. like the rest of them. He didn’t have an unlimited amount of time to spend with them. And yet, he always seemed to drop everything in order to please them. They said jump, Tony asked how high. And they never even thanked him.
"No. For all we know, I don't exist in your world. But here, on this world, we know each other pretty well. I'm Jane Foster. We talk science together. And when you're not busy running your own company, you're well...you're a superhero."
"Yeah, probably not best to keep her waiting then."
Tony cleared his throat. “No, I know. I’m just stopping in on my way back to the hospital. Natasha’s gonna have to take some time off from work. Bucky was in an accident and it’s not looking too good at the moment.”
Tony looked at him. "Steve, superheroes don't exist in my world. You weren't born in the 20s. There was no reason for Project Rebirth to exist or you to have been a part of it."
"High waisted. They're cute."
Clint watched again as Tony held on to Steve, flinging him at Thanos’s face. Steve, again, bashed in Thanos’s face with his shield as Tony took his place on Thanos’s arm. Thor flew Wanda close enough to control Thanos’s mind, while Vision and Natasha kept an eye on the situation, ready to jump in at a moment’s notice if the situation went sideways.
He placed the pizza boxes on the island and got out paper plates for them to eat off of. Natasha burst down the stairs, phone still attached to her ear. "Hey, can Karen come over?" she asked.
“Okay. Night, Dad.”
Jane smiled. "You do that here, too. Stark Industries is the biggest name in clean energy. In addition to that, you also sell a bunch of electronics that won't kill our environment. You're bigger than Apple."
"And it was interesting."
Alias: Captain America
When the doorbell rang, she jumped out of her seat as fast as she could and got to the door before either of her parents knew what was going on. She opened it and smiled nervously at the two men on her doorstep. "Hey, Foggy. Thanks for driving him."
“I know. I just think people’s personal life should be private. I didn’t want to talk about it unless you were okay with it.”
Tony looked around the room at all the sad faces. "What? What did I say?"
“Ugh,” was her response. “Hopping universes is
“No!” Thor said, panic in his voice. “You don’t know what the dungeons of Asgard did to my brother, the torture he endured! I won’t sentence Thanos to that.”
“Can…can you talk? Tell me a story? Anything?”
She was still glaring at him murderously, but eventually agreed. “Fine. Steve and I will go do some research to see if this kind of thing has happened before.”
"Oh, it's okay. He died when I was 11. I've had time to adjust."
“I believe so,” Thor said.
Fuck, family dinner with his fucking
“There are six stones of power,” Thor told her, “that give you the power to control the multiverse.”
“I can take over from there,” Vision said. “You can take me into space with you and I’ll use the mind gem to control him.”
“We need that gauntlet off of him, and it’s clear that anything we throw at him he’s going to notice, so we can’t really sneak up on him.”
"That's why you asked if I knew him yesterday, right? Because I'm dating him?"
Natasha tried not to look at Matt as she talked about the mission. He’d told her it was stupid and dangerous, and she hadn’t listened. They had a lot to talk about, and she wasn’t sure what to start with. Or when she would ever catch him alone long enough to talk through all of their issues.
Lovers:
"I promise. I haven't had any run-ins with Happy since the divorce was finalised last week. I'm just trying to take one day at a time."
Nat arched an eyebrow. "You two were discussing when his dad and Mr Xavier were going to admit their feelings for each other and hook up."
“Wait, you’re like five. Are you even allowed to say fucked up? Won’t Steve scold you and tell you to stop using such vulgar language?”
“That is a good idea,” Nat said on the comms. He grimaced at the sound of her voice.
Tony peered closer at the girl. Where the fuck did she even come from? Why was she calling him Dad? The thought of ever being a father left him with a bad taste in his mouth and certain thoughts that he would screw everything up. Pepper and he had a pregnancy scare a couple months back and Tony had had a panic attack, not ready to be responsible for a little baby that depended on him for everything. He was terrified he was going to turn into his father.
Staying on the sidelines sucked.
“Looks like you’ve got a good life up here. What about your parents? Bucky? Clint?”
Tony spluttered. “Uh, excuse me? Where’s the daughter that argues with me over everything and tells me I’m ruining her life when I try to punish her?”
Natasha shrugged. “It wasn’t that hard.”
“No, I don’t know. I want you to be able to go home safely to your dads in your own universe. I will not be responsible for your death, you hear me?”
Wanda frowned. “We aren’t destroying the stones before we go after Thanos?”
Thor sighed. “No. I learned quite a few things about my father these past few days that I was not aware of.” There was a sad downturn of his mouth, as if Thor was emotionally tired and disappointed. The young Natasha had a feeling the Asgardian’s world had just been turned upside down yet again, and he wasn’t taking it very well. She reached out to Thor, giving him a hug, and invited him to sit down on the couch next to her.
Karen laughed. "I thought about it. But Matt, even if he's not judging you, you know he disapproves of your actions. He does it all the time. I'm not trying to hate on your boyfriend, but he's just a really good guy. He believes in justice and the law and God and I just feel...lesser in his presence for not putting my trust in any of those things. He'll want to tell the authorities and he'll just make the situation worse. You know how to keep your mouth shut."
“Guys,” Natasha chimed in. “You can argue about this later. You all need to stop Thanos first. Then put it to a vote, like you did before about using the stones in the fight. Okay?”
“Peachy,” Tony coughed out. “I’m okay.”
“FRIDAY?” he asked.
“Yeah, but it’s nothing we haven’t fought before, right? This dude is just another alien. All of us together can surely take down one Titan, don’t you think?”
Siblings and Other Family:
“Yeah, it wasn’t great waking up and finding out everyone I loved was either dead or so old it didn’t matter if they were alive anymore.”
The girl peered at him. “Are you okay? Are you…oh, Jesus, please don’t tell me you’re drunk.”
He breathed a laugh. "You weren't joking about smelling like booze. What is that, Jack?"
The older Natasha rolled her eyes.
“No lying?”
"Yeah, but her dad's been drinking. And she doesn't like being around drunk people."
“Hi.” Natasha said shyly, after gathering the courage to speak.
After a few hours of restless, no good sleep, Tony sighed and decided it was time to go face the music. He cringed at the idea of going downstairs to a Steve that wasn’t his. He missed Skinny Steve. He wanted his husband back. This new Steve seemed nice enough, he guessed, but he wasn’t his husband. It seemed cruel for the universe to make him go through this alone.
Matt tilted his head, listening to their conversation. “What’s tonight?”
Jane thought it was best to let his mind work itself out. "Right," she said. "It felt real because it
together?”
Natasha’s resolve crumbled. “Yeah, that’s what I was coming down here to tell you earlier. But then you weren’t you.”
She dropped her keys on the table and set her bag down by the door and rushed into Tony’s waiting embrace. Hugging him felt just like it did when she was 17 years old.
