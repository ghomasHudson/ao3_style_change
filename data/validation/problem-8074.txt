“I didn’t even register the others there. All I could see was your face.”
“Young sir,” Jarvis replied. “I believe I do the same too.”
“I knocked the assistant down,” Daredevil said before running down to aid Luke.
“User unidentified. Please wait here,” Jarvis said.
“I will be opening the doors in 3… 2… 1…” Tony said. He clicked a button and the back entrance slowly started to open.
Tony tossed his phone onto his table. He gave his forehead a massage. What was Strucker planning to do? Why couldn’t super-villains just shut up and sit down once they’re apprehended?
“We can stay here. But not for long, I guess. Then some of us may have to go back to Wakanda,” Natasha said.
And they're  back in Boston!
Doctor Strange rolled his eyes. “I couldn’t visit you in the medical unit because of the cleaning up at my place. Hence, I showed up here. I’m sure you’ll be fine. There’s flowers at the side for you.”
“Tony, where is Tony?” he asked, panic slowly rising in his voice.
“Yes we did,” Wanda placed the wheelchair beside Tony. “How are you?”
“Thor now!” Tony ordered once he saw the coast being clear.
“Okay move him to the kitchen first,” Bruce said. “Jarvis, you gotta help with stopping the bleeding.”
“I want to start off by saying that I’m so sorry,” he looked at Tony with sincerity shining in his eyes. “I’m sorry for just… confronting you like an idiot that night.”
“Guys hurry up, they’re coming back out!” Steve was getting worried. He looked up, just in time to catch Iron Man and Thor breeze by above.
Just a level below, Steve Rogers was trying to sleep. But he woke up once he heard screams coming and a few loud thuds.
“I’ll take it,” Natasha suddenly said, breaking the silence.
He smiled to himself, already thinking of ways to save Jane Foster’s dream.
They all entered the kitchen, looking slightly tanned and sweaty. They brought the smell of the sea back home, along with grains of sand wedged inside their shoes as souvenirs.
They entered Reed’s lab, and Tony was awed at the cube. The schematics showed only a small cube and Tony hadn’t thought much of it. Now, it was huge and had an antenna like rod sticking at the top. The cube was translucent but different colors were flashing in it, like pink and orange.
“My oh my,” Jarvis grinned. “You guys look like you’re all going for a wedding.”
Natasha walked to the dining table where her bag was. She quickly rummaged inside to see if she took all her needed books, pencil case, laptop and its charger. She placed the Tupperware box with her breakfast inside and zipped it up.
Bruce nodded. “Hey uh Kayla, I think we can go to level 2. Basement last.” He said.
Nightshade’s creation simply shattered into half.
Steve lunged forward and grabbed Howard’s suit. He didn’t even care about the alcohol smell reeking from him, he wanted to get his words straight down Howard. “Look here asshole, because of your words my boyfriend is missing. If we don’t find him by tomorrow morning, you’re dead meat!”
“Natasha, I am always here for you if you ever need someone to talk to.”
“I really like you, Tony,” Steve leaned in closer. He caressed Tony’s cheeks, looking into his eyes earnestly.
“That’s cool!” Sam grinned as he lifted baby Clint up. “Wait what?”
Tony’s soft features turned into a grimace within a matter of seconds. He moved away from Steve as if he had scalded him.
“Tony’s birthday.”
“How’d Strucker know Steve and I were here?” Tony raised an eyebrow.
Tony had caught Mjolnir. He immediately stretched it toward the sky, calling lightning. Once he felt like it was powerful enough, Tony threw the hammer towards the force field. The hammer, now filled with energy and speed, pierced right through the field. The weak purple field immediately vanished. The hammer kept going and went right through the leader’s assistant.
“Look Steve, I know I’m imperfect and deeply flawed and I’m trying each day to be a better person. You don’t have to point it out for me,” Tony simply snapped.
“Like it?” Bucky grinned. “Tony, I… I love it. Thank you for making this, for me.” He pulled Tony in for a hug. Tony went stiff for a second, but relaxed. He hugged Bucky back, and rested his head on his shoulder. They were in this position for about a minute.
“He can’t even walk!” Clint was laughing. Steve let out a snort and got up.
“Tony,” Steve sighed. “Take good care. And don’t ever let Howard’s words affect you.”
“What?” Tony asked dumbly.
“Your highness!” Natasha exclaimed.
There was a ‘crunch’ sound that suddenly filled the room.
“Is that… are those their clothes?” Wanda pointed at a pile of clothes lying on the floor, a meter away from the lab.
Mjolnir was on the floor. Suddenly, it rose up and flew out of the window. It dived down. And Thor knew what was going to happen. He was counting down the seconds and closed his eyes.
Wanda created a big red shield. She was using all her energy she had to keep the shield up. Hulk trying to get past it wasn’t helping. Steve could tell the pressure she was in was overwhelming. Wanda fell to her knees with her face all scrunched up. Doctor Strange was already conjuring up another shield near the Defenders’ side. Thor was calling lightning; he was hovering a few meters above the road. After a few seconds, he slammed his hammer down on the middle of the street with all his might. There were electricity sparks flying around the impact area.
“Here are the car keys,” Jarvis said. “Drive safely, kids.” He then went back to the kitchen to help his wife Ana with the cleaning up.
Steve pursed his lips at that information. “Seems really suspicious. But… I’m just glad you’re safe, Tony.”
“Apologies, friend Bruce,” Thor grinned, while doing a backward stroke.
Natasha and Steve turned to look at one another.
Tony choked on the lemonade.
He turned his attention back to them. There was a group shot of the Avengers, the camera capturing a rare moment where all of them were smiling. Tony saw his older-self grinning like a fool with both arms thrown casually around Natasha’s and Steve’s shoulders respectively.
“I didn’t know it was this fucked up,” Clint whispered to Natasha. She nodded her head and folded her arms.
Although deep down he felt relieved that Steve was here, there was a part of him that felt that this was too soon to talk to him. Maybe he really was looking forward to having a corporate chat, lunch and then seeing Steve. Not seeing him the first thing in the morning.
He heard the steady beeps from the heart monitors beside him. The room he was in was too bright. The bed he was placed on was too uncomfortable. The smell of coffee was pretty much the first thing that had hit him; he could practically taste it. Also, he was not alone.
Tony immediately grabbed Peter and rolled out of the Giant’s way. The punch was missed. Tony took a basket full of keychains and hurled it at the Giant, to distract him. One of them sliced right through the Frost Giant’s neck.
“Stee, Tonee solve puzzle by ‘imself!” Clint announced excitedly.
Thor placed his hammer on the floor. He was fully focused on talking to Wanda and listeing to her reply, that he did not notice baby Bruce standing next to his hammer. He touched the handle. The little sparkly feeling which he felt while touching the handle, made him giggle. Sam sat down on the other couch and was watching Bruce intently.
“Well, people change and you’ve changed for the better, Tony,” Thor assured his friend. “Don’t be too hard on yourself.”
He went down the hall, away from the people gathered there.
“Well,” Steve hesitated. “You were de-aged, and a few AIM scientists wanted to kidnap you. But you used Mjolnir to beat the crap out of them and half destroyed the Tower.”
“How do you know that?” Steve asked. The Doctor gave him a smile and walked in. Steve followed suit.
Firstly, I really need to apologize for how long it took me to update this story. But I'm back and I'm hoping to update as much as I can!
“I got you!” Sam swooped down and dropped Clint’s quiver on his hands. Natasha readied her stingers. Sam flew back up to see where Nightshade was. “I’m gonna track Nightshade, she’s on the move! Redwing, is in action mode!”
“First jumpscare incoming, I think,” Bruce said in a warning tone, squashing his face into Thor’s shoulder.
"Anything else, Thor?" Steve asked.
They all walked down the stairs to the kitchen, where a big spread was waiting for them.
“Where is Master Stark?” Jarvis asked. He was arranging the magazines that were on the coffee table.
Clint opened the door for Natasha, and helped her up. After her, the rest of the guys entered it.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hell yeah!” Clint agreed.
“Did he just… wheel himself away from here?” Steve asked, giving his forehead a massage.
“We’re okay. Just tired,” Clint replied. “Oh and meet King of Wakanda T’Challa also known as Black Panther, Vision our android, Colonel James Rhodes, War Machine and Scott who is Ant-Man.”
Steve easily pulled his arm out of Tony’s grip. “And you refrain from stopping me.”
After exiting the elevator, Tony jogged to his lab. If there were no other stupid supervillains or villains or just idiots attacks, then Tony had the rest of the day to himself.
“So there was nothing in my dad’s office?” Tony asked, lying down on Steve’s left bicep.
“Doctor Strange came and took it,” Steve answered.
“Thank you, Thor,” Bruce said. Thor clapped him on the back, which nearly sent him flying across the living room.
“Keep in touch, Brucey-Brucey,” Linda winked at him.
“Always making an entrance,” Bucky huffed.
“I wanted it to purify humans, to make them understand the value of telling the truth.”
“I got this!” Sam shouted. He ran to the stove and turned the heat down. He threw the pan onto the sink and the flames slowly died down.
“Woah Tony, it’s so hot here!” Scott said.
“I can say... I love him.” Tony looked at Natasha shyly.
He gave Tony’s back a pat and walked away to where all their belongings were.
"Hey Happy," Natasha greeted him. Happy nodded his head at her.
“People even call you both the
He was holding baby Tony. Tony was already sleeping on his shoulder but Steve kept on patting his little back. His head was tilted and was touching Tony’s head slightly. He stood at the window and couldn’t help but reflect. He stared at the navy blue sky with stars scattered around them.
“Naked is the new fashion, Ms. Van Dyne,” he grinned. “All right, I’ll see ya soon!”
“Glad you fellows are making it up,” Natasha said as she walked into the kitchen. She poured more juice into a cup.
He walked to the bench and sat beside her, almost silent but with a bit of noise to show he was there.
“What a b word,” he muttered to himself.
Jenny nodded her head with a grin.
They exchanged greetings, smiling. Jarvis insisted that they should leave now. He helped them load all their bags into the 7-seater car he drove. After everything was settled, they were on their way to Malibu.
“Typical Barton,” Bruce chuckled, along with Natasha.
It had been a week since the fight with Strucker. Once everyone reached the Tower, Bruce had immediately worked on getting the second dose for Tony. Both Steve and Tony took three days to recover, getting ample amounts of rest, water and food in the form of soups. Steve had healed quicker, which gave him the opportunity to take care of Tony.
Within an hour, breakfast was prepared. All of them sat down on the huge dining table in the kitchen itself, near the balcony doors. It was a huge spread, and Ana was so proud of the kids as they had managed to cook for over ten people.
“What?!” Tony said. “Thor! There is a Frost Giant trying to take away the stone in Strange’s place. Get on him now! Heads up guys, the leader is in the Spanish café.”
Steve’s stomach chose this moment to growl. Tony snorted and wiped away the tears that fell out of his eyes. He turned to face Steve.
Tony nodded his head, amused at what he had just heard. “Thanks Jenny. Take care okay?”
Tony could feel it easily. He felt the mood shift in Clint and saw beyond the smile he had, that he was actually sad he had lost the game. And Tony didn’t really appreciate the fact that only he had seen this, while the others were trying to calm Thor down.
Thor immediately left after sprinkling the liquid. Peter returned back to his normal age. Before he looked around, he quickly slipped his mask back on.
“Okay, let’s say your dad’s right, shouldn’t we look for evidence?” Natasha pointed out.
In the footage, both Rhodey and Sam were trying to cook something. They were examining the pan, as if doing a science experiment. Rhodey was cranking up the heat when the pan suddenly caught fire. Sam and Rhodey screamed in high pitch voices, like girls, and Sam pulled Rhodey to the side. The fire shot up all the way to the ceiling, which prompted the AI to activate the sprinklers. Vision had also entered the kitchen. There was panic written all over his Android features.
They all entered the house. The house seemed cozy. There was a very short corridor which led to the stairs from the entrance. On the right side of the house, there was a sofa set which was big and full of cushion. The kitchen was on the left. It was fully open with no door to it. There was a door right beside the kitchen. There was another door at the back of the house.
“Indeed sir, it’s your younger version,” Jarvis replied coolly.
. Do you understand?!”
“Eat what, Steve?” Clint smirked at him.
Bruce had pulled Tony out of the way just in time. But that had cost him his burger. The burger which was wrapped around a paper, was soaked in seawater and was bobbing about at the shore.
“Peter Parker?” Tony asked in disbelief. “Wow, he actually came as Peter.”
“Come on,” Sam said softly. “Something is bothering you. I can feel it.”
It was late evening. The baby cots had arrived and were placed in the room. They were pretty small and were placed side by side. Kayla, Steve and Bruce were playing with the babies. They all were about two years old.
“Was I the only one who was awake?” Tony asked.
“We should hit the beach,” he grinned.
“You’re gonna face us. Or the authorities,” Natasha answered while entering the office.
“Okay friends, I am done!” Thor grinned while literally bouncing down the stairs.
“Oh, so you must have a better joke, Rogers,” Natasha said it in a sassy tone. “Come on, share it.”
The team was watching in shock, at the people running around in a frenzy. Police vehicles were stopping by in a disorganized manner. The officers obviously didn’t know what to do. They were looking around; some escorting people while others looking at the portals in awe. Bruce was trying not to Hulk out in the house.
In his defence, Steve constantly got onto Tony’s nerves, okay...
“Brucey-Brucey?” Natasha’s face was all scrunched up.
“Well, that guy neither booked my table nor is paying for my food. So, he can go fuck himself,” Clint rolled his eyes and said it a bit loudly. The others at the table laughed at that.
The cybernaut lunged forward, attacking Steve in a deadly manner. But Steve being a super soldier, managed to avoid all the hits. He ducked a blow and used his shield to hit the cybernaut at its waist area. To his surprise, the cybernaut got stunned and stopped all its attacks.
“Si, si, gracias,” the shop vendor took the cash Tony had handed him and smiled.
“Thank you your highness,” Natasha spoke. She stepped out of the jet while the others boarded it.
“Just the beauty,” the girl grinned at him. “Thank you, Iron Man!”
Tony kept it with himself. He looked at the photograph of them smiling and clutched the teddy bear closer to his heart. He felt at peace, knowing he was going to be fine in a few years. He was glad he knew the answer to the question that would be each child’s dilemma;
He heard a thud sound from beside him. To his horror, there was a 6-year-old girl hiding under the table right beside him.
Tony took in a deep breath before starting.
“Tony?” Steve called him. He was standing behind Tony, arms crossed. “Breakfast is ready. And uh...”
Adult Tony started to cry, realizing how much he had missed some people in his life. At night, he lied down right beside Jarvis, silently crying and wishing he could see and talk to him.
He then ran to another parked car, used the side door for leverage and jumped up, aiming his shield at the cybernaut’s waist area.
The team was gathered at the basement that late afternoon. Bruce insisted on wanting to inform them about the stone’s capabilities. They were staring at it intently. Kayla and Linda were seated on the basement stairs. They wanted to listen to the briefing too.
He ignored the skeptical look he was receiving from Natasha. He was already judging himself, he sure as heck didn’t need his good friend doing the same thing too.
“No seriously,” Tony stopped and pulled Clint to his side. The rest of them entered the kitchen while the two of them were standing at the entrance. “It’s just a game, Clint.”
Once Steve saw Thor and the girls coming down from the stairs, his heart sank. But he knew he had no choice.
Tony pressed for level 76. The silence was getting pretty awkward in the elevator ride down. They were more than glad when the doors opened. They walked out and went straight down the hallway. They stopped outside the big glass doors, which was Tony’s public lab, which he gave
After about half an hour, they were paying for the things they bought using Tony’s credit card. They borrowed the trolleys to push their items back home. Tony promised to return back after they were done.
Mjolnir entered the communal level when Tony decided to let go of the handle. The hammer continued to fly towards Thor, who was lying flat on his back in the kitchen.
“He seems nice!” Tony said.
“And now slowly, you slowly rise up,” Thor instructed Tony. They were doing warm ups before they started on pronunciation and presentation.
Clint picked up a little giraffe, which was Bruce’s favorite. He slowly toddled towards Bruce. The entire house was silent. Steve, Kayla and Linda were staring at Clint and Bruce. Baby Clint offered Bruce his toy.
“Steve,” she took in a breath. “You want to fix things, you need to give Tony some time before he’s ready to actually see you again.”
“Yes little guy, what can I do for you?” Steve carried him. He hugged him. He felt as if Bucky was consoling him, telling him that it would all turn out alright, just keep going. “I’ll keep going Buck.” He was looking at Bucky’s blue eyes. After a sigh, he kissed him on his forehead.
Tony got even more incensed. He took a plate and slammed it onto the counter hard, making sure the sound was heard by everyone who were there. He took a bit of rice and went to the refrigerator and took out a can of iced tea. He slammed the door shut and walked out of there without giving anyone a look.
Obadiah was impressed. As Tony uploaded the file into the company’s server, Obadiah gave Tony’s back a firm pat.
Tony, being a genius, understood what his boyfriend exactly wanted. He leaned forward and pressed a button, causing the retractable hardtop to move. Within seven seconds, the wind and direct sunlight got cut, and the car became an enclosed space. Tony turned on the heater in the car to a low level so that Steve wouldn’t feel too cold.
“A reminder won’t hurt, honey,” Kayla whispered to herself.
The held onto each other for a long time. Steve needed this. He needed someone to comfort him. Someone who would just hug and never let go. It had been a stressful couple of days. This embrace gave him the strength to move on and face this nightmare.
“I still have this,” the leader sneered. He slowly got up and revealed the last, small piece of stone he still had.
“He was like a father figure,” Spiderman suddenly spoke up. “He was, there for me and really, talked to me and gave me tech upgrades. It’s like a special bond I had with him.”
“Is it alright if I watch it now?” Tony asked.
“He had the hammer with him when he fell. Do you think he flew out of the way?” Danny asked.
Steve took this moment to digest the fact about how smart Tony actually was. Even as a kid, he looked at his surroundings and realized he wasn’t actually at home. He bravely interrogated one of the best spies in the world. And he was mature enough to acknowledge his situation. Tony Stark was truly a genius. Engineering was his forte, but he also knew how to adapt. And at that age, adapting was a big feat to be accomplished.
“No!” Tony shouted. Beside him, Clint readied an arrow.
Tony had a pout. “No. You obviously want older me back and don’t want me. So no.”
“Nat?” he croaked. “What are you doing here?”
“Not a problem,” Tony croaked.
“Alright, let’s go in. Make yourselves at home, kids!” Jarvis enthusiastically cooed.
Tony raised an eyebrow before laughing. “I can actually. There are a lot of weird things I recall from Boston. I even can remember, a hazy memory of Wanda and I doing a puzzle and… someone slapped me right? Was it you?”
The others who were standing finally got to look at Tony’s eyes. Steve let out a soft gasp while the others raised their eyebrows. They were looking at both the heroes slowly walking towards them.
Steve raised an eyebrow, while taking out his helmet.
“Happy, what are you doing?” Tony laughed. “Why are you so nervous?”
“You’ve obviously never babysat,” Linda smiled. He had to agree on that.
Steve couldn’t even scold Clint about his language. He was too surprised to even utter a single word. Natasha, Bruce and Thor watched in silence, as little Tony single-handedly fought off waves of AIM personnel.
“I didn’t want to endanger anyone, Tony,” Bruce said. His voice was soft; filled with guilt and fear.
After an entire afternoon out at the park hearing Clint squeal because of the ducks, Thor repeatedly saying ‘quackity quack’ and Bruce freaking out over the snake, lizard and frog mosaics, Tony sent his friends back home while he drove down to Stark Industries, West Branch, still hanging on to his vanilla milkshake.
Steve looked at his boyfriend, wondering what Tony was trying to do. If he was trying to rile Steve up, then it was slightly working.
“No,” he replied, without even looking up from the movie collection.
Steve was giving Natasha a piggy back down the stairs. They were singing “ABCD” together.
The two girls smiled and said, “you’re welcome,” in unison. Clint thanked them for their help. He pulled them both for a tight hug. “I will make sure you guys get a full tour of Avengers Tower.” Kayla chuckled at that.
“Go back home and enjoy, my boy! It’s your second last day here,” Obadiah said cheerfully.
“Good job keep going!” Jessica said to him.
Tony stood up, carrying the girl with him. He ran out of there, making sure no one spotted him. He ran to the back of the building.
“You will,” the Frost Giant ordered and did not seem to care about the Cloak, which had knocked him. “Now. My master requires it.”
“What? I don’t know about you guys. But I’m starving!” Clint retorted.
“It’s hangover, Thor. Not hanging over,” Clint corrected him.
“Thank you Doktor Banner,” Tony grinned. “Also, I think the Hulk is my favorite. Don’t tell Cap!”
“Kayla!” Linda breathed.
General Ross cleared his throat. “What’s that supposed to mean?”
Sam sighed. He wished he had joined this “Avengers as kids” phase earlier. It all seemed fun but he was also aware of the amount of hardwork Steve and the two girls had put in. It wasn’t easy to take care of 6 toddlers at the same time. They proved to be an active bunch.
“Fine, Bruce, give it to Tony first.”
Steve gave the phone his full attention. Tony plugged in an earpiece and gave Steve one side. He hit the play button and started watching the first ten minutes.
“I should ask you that,” Clint smiled.
There was a round coffee table and a long couch around it. There was a television mounted on the wall opposite the long couch and below it was a fireplace. Beside it, there was a big space dedicated to being a bar.
“Mrs. Stark,” Natasha stretched out her hand. “I’ve heard a lot about the Maria Stark Foundation. I’m impressed.”
Tony looked at his group of friends sitting around and eating Mexican food, all looking at him for affirmation. He didn’t want to involve them in case something was
She was wearing a scarlet red short dress, with red heels. Her lipstick was bright red, and she looked really stunning. Her hair was let down, and she had them neatly curled to look really wavy.
“I got the stone!” Thor’s voice cut the chatter.
“Tony, I’m sure the couch is more comfortable than the floor,” Steve said. He walked to the table. There was no one behind it. But there was a pile of clothes on the floor, and it had movements. Steve lifted the clothes off to find a little baby boy, completely naked and half asleep. There were dried tears at the side of his face, indicating that he had been crying for a long time and had just given up. “Tony is that you?”
“Jarbis, I have a question about Dr. Banner,” Tony said. “Everyone were saying how he has a Hulk and that the Hulk’s dangerous. Where is Dr. Banner keeping the Hulk?”
“This isn’t over!” he exclaimed and activated the device.
Clint turned and walked away to his lecture theater. Tony decided to walk back to the hostel to take a shower.
After the warm up, Tony turned to Steve.
“Jarvis, is there an ice pack here?” Tony asked with a coarse voice.
Tony was pretty hard to feed too. He had accidentally kicked Steve twice while jumping around. Steve asked him to stay put using a firm voice and Bucky pulled Tony down. He landed butt-first on the floor.
He dragged himself to the gym, and nearly fell asleep during the training. At one point, he left Friday on auto-pilot for his suit and closed his eyes. Clint’s arrow had hit the suit and it came crashing down, waking Tony up from his two-minute slumber.
“If it was a mistake, don’t bother making it again!” Tony raised his voice, making a few of the people walking turn to look at him.
Hi guys! I want to thank each and every of you for reading this story and for coming all the way to part 2's end. Your support means the world to me!
“Ana, I won!” Thor grinned at her.
With that, he flew away from there.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony,” Steve turned to him after inhaling sharply. “I think this chat was inevitable.”
“Yeah.” Bucky agreed.
Hulk managed to punch the last of the Frost Giants in, along with Ben. Johnny was helping by stalling them, so that the Frost Giants didn’t walk out of the portal.
Let me know your thoughts in the comments below! :)
“We’re a part of your life too, you know, so are you calling us a joke too?” Tony thought out loud.
“Yeah, I am. What is it?”
that it was supposed to de-age people and living things.
“You mean…” Steve thought out aloud. “Our Tony got transported back in time?”
“Boss, you have to look into Widow’s Bites as she bites, Hawkass’ arrows and a Bible project with Reed Richards,” Friday said, sounding amused at how 3am, caffeine driven Tony had named his projects.
“Tony, come down. It’s already cut!” Scott said.
Steve felt tears prickle his eyes. But he didn’t let them reach the surface. He brushed back Tony’s hair, and smiled at him. “That’s true. But now that we’re both here, I bet we can play a game of tag, or anything.”
“You seem to enjoy waking up,” Bruce managed. He looked down at his sheets.
“The Falcon will see to that,” Coulson said, still sounding patient. “As I was saying, the plan is to sneak up on Nightshade. So, you don’t have to suit up but bring your weapons. Reinforcements need to be suited up.”
Natasha turned sharply turn to look at Clint. She adjusted herself and gave Clint’s shin a kick. As he was sitting right beside her, the kick landed hard. Clint howled in pain and fell back, while the others were torn between laughing and helping Clint up.
“Mind telling me what in the fuck happened here?” Tony said.
Tony raised an eyebrow at him. “What you want to pass the mantle to someone? You can do that another day. And just… Forget the decisions you made then. The world, possibly, may need you and you’re backing out now?”
Steve remembered walking in from the back door. There were no kids and a dog.
“No worries,” Steve gave his shoulder a pat.
Steve was reading a book. He looked up. When he saw his genius standing there wrapped around in a white sheet, he smiled.
Natasha, Clint, Bruce and Thor jogged to look at Steve, not knowing the situation could get this bad.
(See the end of the chapter for
Tony was giving him a strange look as he got a load off his chest. “It’s… it’s alright really. I’m sorry too. I must have looked like some dick right.”
She dragged the leader with her out the door, to the stairway.
Thor heard the question from where he was standing. He was chatting with Bruce and Natasha by the window side. “The Frost Giants can survive well in colder conditions. Night time in New York is one of the coldest periods. Hence they chose to attack then.”
Clint and Tony both looked up to see Natasha standing there, seeming disgusted, angry, concerned and done all at the same time. She had her arms crossed. Behind her, Jessica Jones was standing, watching the scene, shaking her head. She was holding Natasha’s Tupperware box, which was half open.
Adult Tony always chose the middle finger, if his options were laid out that way.
“Is this the tower, Steve?” Bucky asked. Steve nodded.
Tony pulled up the jet. He sped it towards the Tower.
“Tony! I’m here with the flamethrowers… Shit!” Sam’s voice came through. Steve saw a wave of purple hitting him.
“Thanks Bruce,” Tony said softly. “I’ll get you another burger.”
“Jarbis, light,” Tony said. The kitchen light flickered on.
“And the game shall begin!” Jarvis announced loudly, grabbing all their attention. “Master Barton and Master Odinson are going to compete. The max score is only eleven, because of time constraint, and because my wife Ana has prepared delicious dinner for you all!”
They shifted closer when Steve and Tony joined them.
Even Clint who was on the roof started to run to another roof. Daredevil joined him within a few seconds. He grabbed Clint and they both jumped over a building to another. They landed quite gracefully.
Howard went to the sink to rinse his glass. The glass he had his whiskey in.
Jane faked another smile, nodding her head. Tony stood up to go back to his apartment.
“Gosh, the coffee is good,” Clint grinned.
“Of course,” she said.
Bruce was looking at her. He didn’t expect her to turn abruptly. In fact, he was admiring her side profile, when he noticed a small smile appearing. He was enjoying that moment, just watching her smile.
“You can’t give up now,” Sam raised both his eyebrows. Everyone knew how Captain America was supposed to be, but this was definitely not how he was supposed to be; resigned and sad.
“So, you really like Captain America?” Natasha asked, with an eyebrow raised. At this time, Clint had joined them. So, Tony was seated between the two super spies.
“I thought you already did!” Linda asked while running up the stairs.
An hour later, the babies and the others were in the living room. Thor was talking to baby Wanda. He settled her on his lap.
“Clint! Your bow, did you lose it?” Steve asked once the dust settled.
He quietly washed the mugs and placed them onto the counter. He went back to the other spare bed and plopped down.
“Tony?” Steve let out a sob. “They bullied me Tony! Always threw cold water on me during winter. Made fun of how skinny I looked. Tripped me in school. Snatched my lunch and threw it away. Hated me…”
“Same feeling here, Clint,” Tony straightened up. “But we need to prepare in case Strucker decides to strike.”
“That’ll do.” Clint jumped up. He followed both the girls into the kitchen. Tony was shaking his head.
“Vis!” she started. “It’s not fair! You were supposed to enter from the door but you walked through the wall! You didn’t win this time. That’s not a win!”
“Tony, where are you?” Steve called. He tried using the comms. “Tony, come in.”
“What are you doing here?” Tony asked her.
“What are you going to do, kill me?” Strucker mocked him.
“Also, Dr. Banner and Agent Barton have been wanting to speak with you.”
“Mr. Stark?” Jenny looked thrilled to see him. “I’m good. How are you? Yesterday was quite eventful.”
“Clint, come back here!” Linda said, panic filling her. She had no idea when Clint slipped past her and went there.
The table went silent. Tony even contemplated on swallowing his saliva, because that was how quiet it went.
“Wow,” Bucky said over the comms. “Didn’t know that man became a dick.”
Happy reading! :)
“Bruce, listen to me, you’ve got this,” Tony said. Without a second thought, he hugged Bruce.
Of course it was. If Natasha had set it up it meant that she was tired of watching them both pining on either corners of the Tower.
After a little water break, Thor asked Tony to present something for the little audience gathered in front of him. A small presentation on anything that interested Tony a lot.
“Why would we?” Thor asked. “You’re our good friend! What’s part of you is a part of you and when we forge friendships, we accept you as a whole, not as a part. So please do not fret.”
He didn’t expect Tony’s face to fall in disappointment. “I thought it’d be a Stark tech.”
“And our guests are here!” Sam spoke up. He was grinning at his handphone screen.
“Anyway, just curious but… were you transported back in time?” Clint asked.
They also talked about them speeding down the highway, as if the road was built just for them. Steve simply wanted them to be safe, while Tony was in it more for the thrill. But he assured Steve that Natasha and himself were good drivers. They hoped they wouldn't get a speeding ticket. But Bruce laughed at that and pointed out the speed at which both cars were going. Clint and Tony brushed that off. Then they sighed and relaxed, feeling blissful in each other's company.
Thanks to Clint, some of the Avengers are now toddlers.
Steve closed his eyes and thought back. He tried remembering Tony’s words, from the beginning of the trip. He got reminded of Tony hugging Jarvis and introducing him to his friends at the airport. He got reminded of Tony calming Steve down after he broke down. He got reminded of Tony grinning while getting ready for the dinner and the sex after. He recalled the trip to the amusement park and recalled Tony’s words during lunch.
I was supposed to update on Friday, but I was doing this horrible part time work for two days, which nearly killed me.
Soon after lunch, Tony was ready to go back to the Tower. He was sitting on the edge of his bed. Clint and Natasha were outside his room while Bruce and Thor had already left for the Tower. Steve was making sure none of them had left anything in the room.
“No it’s not with her,” Tony said while he buttoned up his blazer. “It’s with Reed at the Baxter Building.”
He saw a few seagulls flying past him, and a little boy dropping his cotton candy on the boardwalk floor. The boy started to cry while his dad picked him up, saying it was alright and that they’ll get him a new cotton candy.
“Yes Master Stark,” Jarvis replied and immediately went to take one.
“Yes sir,” Jarvis replied. “Agent Romanoff and Master Barton are asleep in their quarters. Master Odinson is also asleep. Dr. Banner just went to bed, after four failed attempts at finding a cure for you. And so did Captain America. He was drawing just three and a half minutes ago.”
If you've got feedback, you can leave a comment below. I'd be more than happy to read and reply! :)
Steve was visibly shivering. “It’s cold and I hate it.” He said with gritted teeth. The smile on both Tony’s and Natasha’s faces vanished.
“There’s still time,” Steve smiled. “You should take a quick nap before going back up.”
Upstairs, Linda was washing, preparing for lunch.
“I was even closer, friend Clint!” Thor beamed.
“You also have a private lab here. You built a couple of bots and are really affectionate about them,” Steve smiled, reminiscing the times when Tony fondly scolded his robots.
It was 5 in the morning. Natasha woke up because it got slightly colder than usual. She stretched till she felt better, then she let out a yawn. She sat at the side of the bed. The curtains were not pulled together, so she could look outside. She could see the night sky. It looked very peaceful, with a star shining extra bright occasionally. She smiled a little, feeling at ease. After about two minutes, she realized her companion’s bed lamp was on. She turned behind.
Steve looked up. He then looked back at Tony, whose eyes were lit up with excitement. Steve smiled softly. "You already are one, Tony." Steve whispered. Tony looked at him. He was grinning and Steve could see that the little boy was very tired already. "Alright, let's go back." He carried Bucky and walked back home.
“Steve,” Natasha pursed her lips. “I will do the report. Clint will get his injuries checked out and will rest. Thor will do what you say. But you, you are in-charge of Tony.”
Tony was guffawing at what he saw and heard. The others were laughing heartily at that, too.
The battle ends with a surprise and everyone needs the medics.
“Thor, you make better coffee than my own boyfriend,” Steve chuckled.
He appreciated the sudden burst of attention, even though he was drained. In fact, while waiting for his food, he had taken a few photos with some employees. He even signed an autograph on a napkin. Tony loved his staff, the very people who had helped his company stand where it was. He made sure they were well taken care of. And if they wanted to take photos with him or get autographs, he was more than willing to comply.
Their luggage bags were shifted to the rooms. Tony decided to take the second couch. So it was Clint, Bucky and Steve in one room, and, Natasha and Bruce in the other.
There were tears streaming down Tony’s face. He nodded his head and took in deep breaths. “Okay, Cap. B…but I will miss you.”
“Boss, there is a private jet with cybernauts in it,” she spoke up quickly. “It’s heading towards Brooklyn and rigged to crash in the heart of it.”
Tony flew as fast as he could and caught the little boy, who was crying. They flew past the others and landed in the convenience store.
“Cybernauts want to crash the jet in Brooklyn,” Tony spoke up.
“This is half of the full version of the stone. Meaning, there are two of them.” Bruce replied.
Tony breathed in and out deeply, trying to contain the anger that was bubbling up. He knew Clint had meant and was his good friend but talking to Steve was not something he wanted to do. In fact, he actively avoided it.
“Tonee,” he chirped.
Jarvis enabled one of the holographic screens. And it showed exactly what Steve was drawing.
“Stop hitting me with the truth, Jarvis.”
The Hulk roared and punched one of the scientists. Thor was slowly climbing up to join them.
They were silent for a long time. It was getting pretty uncomfortable for both of them. Tony could hear Chippy barking outside and Bruce’s loud laughter.
“I want to say, I’m sorry,” he said. Natasha turned to look at him.
Steve was lying down on the floor with baby Bucky perched up near his abdomen. Bucky was holding onto a small elephant doll, which he was using to whack Steve’s chest. Steve could only smile at that. Bruce was hiding a baby bear doll behind him. He instructed baby Natasha to find for it, which she attempted. Once she found the doll, she started to giggle. This warmed Bruce’s heart. Kayla and Clint were playing with paint. They sat further away from the others so that the paint won’t splash on them. Clint seemed very focused while pressing his paint filled palm onto a paper, which made Kayla smile.
Thing was, Steve had seen Tony looking at him from the mirror. He smirked to himself, already knowing what they’re going to be up to tonight.
Steve, who was sitting at the edge of the bed, let out a snort. Tony danced his way to where Steve was, and wiggled his butt in front of his face, and then made a 180-degree jump, and shimmied.
He turned to look at her. Natasha was looking at him, with a soft smile. He managed a weak one. She ruffled Tony’s hair. She knew that Tony was not ready to face the other Avengers. But he chose to anyways. It had to be something serious if Bruce asks for the team to come together again.
“He was sleepwalking,” Steve said, still holding onto the smaller man.
He raised an arm up and tried and tried so hard to grab the handle. He let out a cry and struggled mid-air, already losing consciousness. But then he looked up, back at the Tower. He caught a familiar figure staring down at him.
Wanda smiled. It was a genuine one, only formed when anyone talks to her about Vision. “We can work on it. And I’m sorry too, Tony.” Tony nodded his head.
“You know, it’s… it’s okay if she doesn’t share you know. An AI needs her freedom too,” Sam said. He looked very nervous.
“We’ll get your stuff,” Linda spoke in a small voice. Kayla wiped her tears and picked up her phone. She ran up with Linda, ready to pack all of their items. Wanda, Sam and Bruce went up while Tony jogged down to the lab.
“I was in… some sort of a limbo,” Tony frowned. “But… I was also at my old house. Where I lived when I was younger, with Jarvis and all.”
“Oh come on!” Sam laughed along. “I just wanted to talk to you, Tony!”
“Got it Mr. Safety First!” Tony grinned.
“You can do better than this,” Clint gave him a pat on his back and tried to say it with a straight face. But he couldn’t. Each of them started to laugh again and Steve game them a light-hearted scowl.
Steve nodded. “You’re actually carrying baby Clint.”
Tony laughed at that.
He used his iron will to stay awake as he ran back to where the main battle was taking place. Steve was sitting at the side, leaning against the deck railing filled with love locks. He was wiping his face.
Tony felt the pukey feeling recede back. He sighed in relief.
“You have good instincts,” Tony smiled at Clint, still holding onto Mjolnir.
Before Jarvis could say something, Steve stepped in. “It’s not your fault.” He brushed back Tony’s hair, and pulled him closer to him.
“Mother hen, I’m fine!” Tony protested.
Yeah, he hadn’t expected them here.
“Okay, anything I can do at Long Island? I don’t want to stay at the Tower today-”
“I didn’t mean to touch them…” he said. He placed the frames back, and looked at Steve. His lips wobbled, and tears gathered in his bright looking chocolate brown eyes. “I’m sorry… please don’t scold me… I… I never meant to be a disappointment.”
“See,” Sam started. “I had a wingman. Name was Riley. We were out for a standard night mission. An RPG knocked him out. He fell straight down, and there was nothing I could do. It’s like, I was up there to simply watch him go down. So you could say, guilt was eating me.” He moved closer to Rhodey. “When I saw you fall, for a split second, I saw Riley.”
-Thor, 7.45pm
Steve was looking right at Tony, taking in his words. “I agree with you. Now that we’re back, I guess we ought to stay united.” Steve sighed. “And… I’m sorry Tony.”
“Hey Steve, I didn’t mean to-”
In the TV, there was an aerial view of 177A Bleecker Street in New York, having two fully opened portals on either ends of the street. Armies of Frost Giants were walking in. People were being evacuated. They were running around wildly while screaming. Spiderman, Doctor Strange, Vision and the Defenders were already there, trying to fight the Frost Giants.
Tony cheerfully waved at some of them. And they too, waved back at him. The Damage Control people were sworn to secrecy about this issue; they knew who the little boy was.
The quinjet, which was in stealth mode for a long time, finally came into view. “Welcome back, boss.” F.R.I.D.A.Y said.
Importantly, he could barely walk.
With that, the girls and Steve started to sing. The kids joined in, but they were just babbling and barely followed the tune, which was beyond adorable. Wanda and Clint were screaming it out, uttering the words like these:
“Tony,” Natasha gasped when she saw his eyes.
Spidey scratched his head. “I think so… But I’ll need your help.”
Tony stood up. He went to where Mjolnir was placed, which was on their coffee table, and placed his hand closer to the handle. He saw little blue sparks emerge on the hammer. It went down, to where Tony’s hand was. Thor raised both his eyebrows, and waited for Tony’s move.
“It wasn’t so bad,” Linda laughed.
When Tony heard that in his voicemail, he simply chuckled. He was walking out of Professor Yinsen’s tutorial class, which happened to be the last class of the day Tony had.
the kids.
Hi everyone! How are you guys doing? Hope you're all having a great weekend so far. Here's another chapter and happy reading, y'all!! Thank you so much for your support so far! :))
“Reed, some of those bastards have managed to get past us! Could you
They continued to cruise down the road, enjoying the view and each other’s company. Thor then spoke about how he was beginning to love the West Coast more. He loved the seaside and simply wished to live in a beach house.
The other Avengers standing there were looking at Tony under a new light. They knew him as a teammate and friend, but wouldn’t have guessed he had a side like this. Even Peter couldn’t help but gulp.
created. It was a cube, that can allow anyone to travel to alternate universes. Pretty smart. Everything seemed complex, but Tony could understand all these were formed upon a theory that alternate universes did exist.
Tony shrugged, laughing a self-deprecating laugh. “Look at me, Steve. I’m so fucked up. You don’t deserve someone who is so broken and needs fixing. You need someone who is good for you, for your soul. I’m not it.”
“No sowwy,” Bucky stuck his tongue out. Tony looked up Steve. His big brown eyes made Steve go all mushy inside.
“There are a couple of other things, like the puzzles Tony and Wanda did, we took the liberty to frame them by the way, Clint’s toy telephone, the painting of a big goldfish done by Clint and Bucky, and Natasha’s and Bruce’s coloring books.” Kayla said. Both the girls had passed around the items. “Oh and we have a photo of Chippy.”
Tony blinked at him. “Wait, you’re actually serious.”
Once the steakhouse’s door shut, the buzz died down. The silence was bliss inside, compared the flashes and the paparazzi shouting Tony’s name and questions. The six of them settled down in their seats, and sighed.
“I don’t know what else can explain his sudden disappearance,” Bruce added. He and Thor were walking back after going around the entire amusement park searching for Tony.
Thor sighed. “Alright, the stone is completely softened.”
Wanda’s face changed. She seemed flustered. “I am sorry for that.”
“Clint, you okay?” Tony asked.
“I’m glad it was,” Steve said. He leaned down and gave his boyfriend’s forehead a kiss.
“Too much to what, have feelings?”
“Please be safe,” Jarvis warned them. “Take care of your valuables, have lunch at appropriate times and drink lots of water.”
All of them looked at Tony’s back disappearing further down level two, with trepidation. Clint hoped nothing bad would happen to his friend.
Tony nodded his head. Thor too gave Tony a hug. He took Mjolnir and got ready to leave. “You’re a strong man, Tony.” He said, before he walked away. He wanted to go down to help the Damage Control people finish up their work quickly.
“Yeah, I do, did,” Tony’s eyes widened when he felt like vomiting. “Do. I still do.”
“How was… gym?” Tony asked. He felt like kicking himself for asking such a stupid question.
“Tony it wasn’t your fault,” Steve said.
Steve and Tony turned to one another. They smirked at each other and turned back.
“Alright,” Tony said.
“Mr. Hogan, is Ms. Potts in the office?” she asked in her best customer service voice as possible. Tony almost laughed at how formally she addressed Happy. “Alright, bye.” She turned to Tony. “She is upstairs. I have to give you a badge if not Mr. Hogan will lecture me.”
Steve frowned. “That’s my middle name.”
Tony exited the elevator, already mentally preparing himself to do some engineering math when he heard a sob come from the open area. Jane Foster was sitting there, alone, with a scraped knee and a couple of torn pieces of paper. Tony wasn’t close to Jane and didn’t know her well. But he wasn’t heartless to leave her crying alone. Plus, he felt this sense of protectiveness for anyone from level 6.
“Captain, Daredevil had been de-aged too!” Thor sounded exasperated.
“So that was you!” Clint grinned. Natasha was walking beside him, chuckling at them. She felt her adrenaline still pumping.
The others turned quickly to face Tony once he said the plan.
Sam loved playing with the babies. He didn’t even realize an entire day passing by while being with them; he was really fond of them. He seemed to have forgotten that they were his fellow Avengers. An hour ago, he was playing with Clint and Tony. Both of them have developed a special bond after Tony pulled Clint away from the Frost Giant’s malicious blow. They used Clint’s toy telephone to act like they were talking.
“It shouldn’t be our second nature,” Strucker scoffed
“Steve!” Sam was grinning. “I am so happy to see you. Man, you look so… tired.”
Tony immediately raised Mjolnir, and a light blue force field surrounded the little boy. Tony closed his eyes, and his face scrunched up as he focused on making sure the force he was resisting wouldn’t throw him backwards.
“Thanks Myuh-nee,” Tony whispered.
“Hey.”
“No,” Doctor Strange shook his head. “I’ve been investigating it. If it was in another dimension, the leader could easily take it by creating a portal.”
They went for a few other rides, laughing and giggling together. They got themselves corn dogs from a stand, and sat at an empty bench (miraculously they found one) at the boardwalk and ate together. Clint got himself cotton candy and devoured it fully. Bruce had gotten some large cheese fries, and shared it with the others.
“Yeah… yeah… it’s just that,” Tony stammered. “It’s… My dad has never liked anything I did or had. This is the first time he said he likes something that’s mine, and that’s you guys.” He had a very subtle smile on his face.
“Please tell me he’s done,” Clint muttered.
(See the end of the chapter for
The jet was making its final descent towards LAX. There was the announcement about keeping the seats upright, windows open and tray tables stowed. Tony chucked away his crossword puzzle book into his bag. He pushed up his tray and locked it into position. As he was sitting at the window seat, he lifted up the window shutter. The sunlight hit him suddenly, and he squinted his eyes.
“I’ll bring you all some lemonade,” Kayla said. She took a plastic plate and placed the toasts neatly. She offered them to Clint, who looked very grateful. “Oh Linda, tell Bruce they are here.”
They made a steep turn upwards and were headed back to the communal level.
“I can feel the Hulk wanting to come out,” Bruce said. His skin had green tinges on them.
“According to the coordinates he sent me, yes,” Tony answered while looking at his phone.
“Look at your cake, Tony!” Steve cooed. “Let’s sing him a birthday song.” Tony was grinning. He tried to reach for the cake, but Steve pulled him back. Always eager.
Steve sighed. He decided to go up to the rooftop to clear his mind.
There was no response.
“What will that be?” Bruce asked.
Pepper sighed knowingly. “It went that bad huh.”
“Are you with the Howling Commandos?! Is Aunt Peggy here too?! Is your best friend Bucky-“ Tony clamped his mouth shut. “Sorry Cap, sorry sorry I forgot he died. Don’t get mad at me. Dad always got mad at me because I always say the wrong thing. Please. Don’t tell dad or else he’ll slap me. And his slaps hurt all the time.” Tony’s eyes began to well up again. He was practically begging Steve, who was patting the little boy’s back. He was whispering calm reassurances to a shaking Tony. Deep inside, he simply felt like socking Howard in the jaw.
“Maybe it’s because I got a punch from my old man?” Tony rolled his eyes. But once he saw the glare on Steve’s face, he sobered up. “Steve, really I’m okay.”
“But you had time to fall in love?” Bruce asked, stumping everyone.
“James fucking Wesley… Fisk’s close friend,” Clint said through gritted teeth. “Either Fisk himself changed it or Wesley did. Probably that bastard Wesley because he's in the damn committee. He’s gonna get it from me right now!”
Tony mustered the courage to say, “Yeah. Thanks Nat.”
“I know it’s odd, but welcome to my family, where my dad’s business partner is more of a dad to me than my real dad,” Tony summed up. “I mean… even my butler is better!”
We see short glimpses of what Rhodey and Sam were up to at the Tower while Steve and Linda attempt to bury the stone.
“Oh Master Stark,” Jarvis sighed. “I hate doing this drill. Always involves a lot of screaming.”
“Don’t try anything,” Steve stood up, wanting to smash more punching bags. “Let Tony come back and I’ll talk to him.”
“Did you say Jarbis?!” Tony nearly screamed. “Is he here?”
“True,” Tony nodded his head.
But little Tony knew that was wrong. That’s not how it would work. He decided that Steve belonged here and that the people here need him more. He looked at the photo, particularly at Steve, who was grinning. He pressed it to his heart and waited to get transported back to his own time.
“Jesus,” Natasha grimaced. “What the hell is in this?”
Please leave a feedback and I'll be happy to read it! :)
Tony got up and hugged Steve, burying his face into Steve’s neck. He was crying more now. Steve gave Tony’s cheek a kiss while trying to calm him down. He slowly walked back to where his team was gathered, careful not to fall into the hole.
Great things are about to come in this AU so stick around! :D
Tony stood up as a bright idea hit him. “Bruce, how many shots are in the bottle?”
“You can only lift it if you’re worthy. If not, it would be too heavy.”
“We’ll meet after we had breakfast,” Luke said. “It was great fighting alongside the Avengers.”
Tony quickly activated his Avengers Communicard. Natasha Romanoff answered the call.
Reed and Bruce stepped forward. Reed checked for his pulse while Bruce checked his eyes.
“Thanks Tony,” Steve rolled his eyes.
“How are you?” Sam grinned.
“Your clothes are on the bed. Dress up and come down,” Steve said. He then left the room, laughing to himself.
“Will they come here, again?” Steve asked. He was massaging his temples.
“Yeah, I remember. We were having this really intricate conversation about Bible verses at 3am… what was that about?”
“You didn’t,” Tony assured him. “Look at us, we’re all still ourselves. We didn’t de-age!” Bruce gave a small smile. “So quit the worrying and join us.”
Baby Clint stretched out his painting. Tony took it and was looking at it. It was just Clint’s palm print, purple in color.
I hope you guys enjoy this chapter. Thank you for all your support so far!
“Come on, we got to give them lunch,” Steve stood up.
She took the ice pack from Jarvis and placed it on Steve’s left cheek. Her soft lips wobbled, holding back the many words she wished she could tell someone.
“That sounds, very outlandish. You could put it that way.” Tony shrugged.
“Hey Tones,” Clint grinned at him. “Come ‘ere.”
“Are you ok?” Kayla asked him with concern. He nodded while managing a smile. He then turned to Tony.
Thank you so much to everyone who waited for the next update, really, I'm so very grateful for each and every one of you. I hope you enjoy the story!
Both Peter and Tony got up and adjusted themselves. Peter quickly hid behind Tony’s legs when he saw Thor.
“Where is his mom?” Natasha asked.
Steve’s eyes watered as he nodded his head. Both Thor and Clint then proceeded to hug Steve, who laughed and hugged them back.
Thor had also ordered several toys online; with the occasional help from Clint on picking the right toys. So far, only a drawing block with crayons and a toy car had arrived.
“Why the fuck is he like that?” Tony asked, and turned his attention to Steve.
“What about Reed?”
After changing him into a pajama, Natasha pulled the blanket towards Tony, once he was settled in. Tony chose to hug the Captain America bear, while the rest of them were laid out neatly beside him, also covered by the blanket.
Clint and Tony were already arguing about what to have for lunch. Steve shook his head, smiling lightly at their little banter.
Steve snorted as he plopped down on the other couch, with Natasha nicely placed on his lap. “Yeah they’re all heavily under my influence.”
“Possibly,” Bruce answered while taking a sip of orange juice Linda had kindly prepared. “You wouldn’t want to go back.”
“Jarvis, prepare the cars. We’re probably gonna take a drive tomorrow,” Tony smiled.
“As much as I wanna talk to Steve, this is something you should do with him,” Pepper reasoned out. “So just take your time here and then go back to talk to him.”
“Tasha!” baby Tony exclaimed. Steve pulled him towards him. He settled Tony on one thigh while Bucky attempted to climb on the other.
“What are we doing for lunch?” Bruce asked.
“That’s so cool…” Tony said, as if in a daze. He slowly pushed back the chair. He picked up his teddy bears and went to the entrance of the kitchen.
The weekend is finally here!
“We will practice together once you keep learning the other basics,” Thor assured him. “Now, let us relax.”
“Going to be,” Steve sighed. He was toying with his earpiece. “I’ll instruct the others from here.”
“It’s your room then,” Natasha smiled. She lifted the boy up and everyone then went back to their rooms.
He decided to eat with his teammates, pushing away all his worries about Strucker and most importantly, Steve. He could worry about him later. Right now, he just wanted to have a good lunch with his friends.
He looked down from level two to check if his friends were hanging out in the living room. There was no one. He ran up to the Wii station, to find that empty too. He stood on the stairs and scratched his head. He decided to find for Jarvis.
Tony let go of the handle, and the blue sparks appeared once more. This time, they went in the reverse direction and disappeared.
“We look cool and conspicuous at the same time,” Bruce laughed.
“Not any time soon if I do what I came here to do,” Doctor Strange smiled. A very tired looking Steve turned to look at him. A small frown settled on him. “I came here to take the stone to where I am currently residing.”
Thor flew back and crash landed into the kitchen.
He was so loud the buzz of the people chatting around the penthouse died down quickly. They all turned to look at Rhodey. He reluctantly looked up and tried to smile. But it came out as a grimace instead. He slowly started to stand up.
Steve pushed Howard down before storming out of the office. The rest of them followed out, starting to feel the panic rise.
Clint had wrapped his arms around a sobbing Tony. “Whas tis?” Clint’s small voice asked. He felt comfortable though, to be wrapped around and to be surrounded by the warmth of the Cloak. Even Tony was beginning to relax. He was touching the Cloak to feel the material, intrigued.
Tony blacked out for a second upon hearing Steve’s words. He looked at him, raising an eyebrow because in which world did Steve Rogers actually liked him back?
“He is close,” the AI replied. “He will be entering the state within the next hour. Captain Rogers is already here. He is just two seconds away from reaching you.”
“Yes young man?” Steve turned to him.
“Mr. Stark!” Spiderman tried. “Come on!”
Tony then went on to explain where he was. It was like a limbo. He spent some time wandering around limbo aimlessly, also naked. There was also a tree there, and that was where he sat down most of the time. He then found a source of light and walked towards it. It had led him to his old house’s garden. He walked into his old house, where cops were gathered.
The Doctor went to examine Tony. He crouched down to reach him. “Tony, open your eyes. Come on little one.” He gently removed the hand that was covering the cheek. He carried him and brought him to a standing position. He gave the little boy a few pats on the back. Tony inhaled sharply and his exhale was a loud cry.
Falcon swooped in and grabbed Bucky. They both landed near the portal to help push back the Frost Giants. Luke and Jessica were tossing some of the Giants to Hulk, who punched them straight in. T’Challa cleverly dodged their assaults and kicked the Giants back.
Sam was still going backwards. He didn’t know there was a toy behind him. He stepped on a little train and yelped. His hands swung ferociously as he tried to find balance. His hand was dangerously close to Tony and Clint. But instead of hitting either one of them, he hit the puzzle Tony was proudly handing Steve. The board flew and landed on the couch while the image of Mickey Mouse and Friends broke apart. The 36 pieces landed separately. Sam finally lost his battle with physics and came crashing down, hard. He landed on a box full of dolls and toys. The plastic box shattered under his weight and toys exploded everywhere.
“Can we use it tomorrow instead?” Bruce sighed.
“Anyone up for a night of horror movie?” Tony sat upright. His voice nearly cracked as he was trying to push his tears away. “I heard the Thai horror movies have comedy and horror fused together perfectly.”
“Steve!” Tony called out. “Come on, it was just for fun!”
Beside this room was another bathroom. Further down, there was the room shared by Linda and Kayla. It had two single beds and one cupboard. Both had study tables opposite their beds. Kayla slept near the window while Linda slept near the door. The room was baby pink and had posters of movies or celebrities pasted all over them.
“You could take one of Mr. Stark’s cars,” Vision contributed. “I’m sure he won’t mind.”
“What the hell,” Steve whispered to himself. He went towards Bucky.
“Let go,” Natasha gritted her teeth while trying to pry Steve away from Tony’s dad. “Now we know who is responsible, at least we can try to find him. He’s still at Santa Monica Pier.”
He was wearing sweatpants with a blue tank top, fresh out of shower.
Wanda and Natasha were in the master bedroom. Thor sprinkled some of the water on the babies. He instructed Linda and Kayla to turn away while he walked out of the room. Within seconds, the girls heard some shuffling and a few loud gasps behind them.
He sat back down beside Steve.
Clint realized he couldn’t lie to Tony anymore. He dropped the fake smile and sighed. “Tony, I have a fucking sucky habit. Okay, don’t judge. I can’t just see a game as a game. I take things a little seriously and like to win. It’s me and I can’t do shit about it.”
He fired an explosive arrow at a Frost Giant who got too near Steve. Steve saw this; he used his shield to give the Giant a hard blow. Vision assisted him by hitting the Frost Giant hard enough to send him to the entrance of the portal.
Will Clint and Natasha be okay though? Let's hope Tony will be prepared to face whatever Whitney has in mind.
,” Tony sang.
Natasha smiled. Bruce being honest was enough for her to tell him that everything was alright.
“Thor,” Steve said while pinching the bridge of his nose. “You literally have a genius to catch. Near Brooklyn Bridge, red and gold armor. Hard to miss.”
Steve opened his mouth to answer. But no words came out. He felt a pang in his chest. He wanted to tell Tony that he was sorry that he was not alright. The letter only was not enough, he knew. But he couldn’t bring himself to. The more he looked at Tony, the guiltier he felt.
Bruce woke up with a cough. He rubbed his eyes and tried to stop the coughing fit. Steve pat his back but it didn’t help much. Tony gave Bruce the bottled water.
“No time, J. I have to go to Long Island. Anything else I can do there, please let me know.”
“Yes.”
Steve then held onto the ice pack, and Maria let go. She wiped her tears and turned to Ana. “I’ll be back for dinner.” She gave her son a kiss and walked out of the kitchen.
Clint and Thor were already grinning while looking at the rides from the outside. They all walked in, looking in awe at the various stalls lined up. Natasha had never really gone to the theme park before. She had only attended one carnival, and that was a bad experience because of the bullies she had faced. She then felt someone’s arm going around her shoulder. She turned to look at Clint, who gave her a sweet smile and pulled her closer to him. She rested her head on his shoulder for one second, before looking away, at a little girl getting a teddy bear from one of the stalls.
She nodded her head. “I’m sorry.”
Thor immediately sprinkled some water on Peter.
Tony suddenly felt Steve’s muscles contracting. He gulped, knowing Steve just got angry. But he had continued hugging Tony, and Tony simply melted into the warmth.
Also I was listening to Malibu by Miley Cyrus while editing this chapter and it simply added to the effect. Gosh I love that song!
“What do you mean by bigger threats?” Natasha turned to Thor and asked.
Steve let out a small laugh. “Tony. Scott. Nice to meet you two.”
After a few more seconds, the door opened.
There was no response from Friday either. Tony started to back away from that area when he started to hear the noise coming from the stair area.
Except there was. He could use his jet boots to stall his fall. When he realized that, he attempted to do it.
“That is how unbelievable it is, Tony,” Thor said kindly while chewing his turkey burger.
Tony and his friends prepare to go for the dinner and Howard hits someone. Later on, Steve and Tony get some action...
“No! I’m not going to allow that.” Tony glared at Steve. “Stop trying to be an idiot!”
“What… what do we get for children?” Tony asked.
“Aren’t you supposed to be out there with the others, fighting? Avenging?” Rhodey was frowning at him. He was holding a tablet on his free hand. He was wearing the exoskeleton and he looked like he was trying not to show his pain.
“Tony!” Steve’s enthusiastic voice called him. “Let’s go.”
, partner.” Steve squeezed Tony’s left shoulder.
“Stop it!” Natasha cried out. “He has the cure and we need him alive!!”
“Thor, get to Sam!” Steve ordered. “The rest of you, with me to the bank!”
Bruce shook his head and shut the door. Steve finally let go of Tony, who started to cough violently. Bucky and Clint helped both of them up. The 3 girls started to prepare for breakfast, dropping the topic of Steve entirely.
Once they entered Tony’s level, the little boy ran to his room. Since the room wasn’t touched for a long time (Tony moved in to Steve’s quarters six months ago), it looked really neat. Everything was clean. Tony jumped onto his bed, and squealed when he saw the Avengers teddy bears laid out for him. He took the Captain America one and hugged it.
“I hope he comes back down in one piece,” Natasha said.
“We are buying Mexican from a food truck and will enjoy it at Santa Monica Pier,” Tony read it right off the itinerary, which was in his phone.
Tony smiled. “Good to see you too, Spidey. Care to fill me in?” He was already adjusting the comms to match the frequency of that of the Defenders.
Beside them, Thor and Bruce were fast asleep on their bed. While Clint and Natasha were snuggled together in the walk-in closet.
If you have any feedback, please feel free to drop it at the comments below! :)
“Don’t tell me you’re cleaning the pipe now,” Tony rolled his eyes. “Hey my girl F.R.I.D.A.Y, I think I asked you a question like four years ago.”
“Oh no…” Steve raised his eyebrows.
“Team 3, Thor, Iron Man and Ant Man, I need you three to work together to get the stones. Thor, Doctor Strange will open you a portal so that you can destroy the stones. If any of us gets de-aged in this battle, use the miracle liquid quickly. Tony scan for the stone. Ant Man, work with Tony,” Cap said. “Avengers and Defenders, let’s move!”
came when he fell down. Steve let out a yawn before helping the confused and disheveled Tony up. Both of them had messy bed hair.
“Do you think he knows?” Steve thought aloud,
“Not a problem,” Steve assured him. “It looks like I need to lecture myself.”
“First room door belongs to Clint and Nat,” Tony said. “Second is mine and Steve’s and the last is Bruce’s and Thor’s. The rooms below belong to my parents and Jarvis and Ana. Plus, the office is there.”
“Uh I was coming back home to visit you. But there was a big fight which involved superheroes and I got trapped…” he easily lied, and cringed because Captain America was right beside him.
The man turned to Steve. It didn’t take long for him to recognize this being. He had seen this description on S.H.I.E.L.D files before. This was one of the Frost Giants.
Suddenly, the AIM guy who was at his feet grabbed Tony by his ankle.
Bruce then looked to his right and gasped at the beauty of the sea. It was clear blue and was already shining, even though the sun wasn’t that high yet. He was entranced by the view, and didn’t know he was holding his breath in.
In the end, the king had asked the secret Avengers if they were ok to leave. They discussed thoroughly and were fine with it. It took very long for Steve to decide on whether Bucky will be out with them or not. Tony must have really convinced T’Challa to let Bucky out. Steve was surprised. But he was glad to have his best friend out of cryogenic sleep. After all, if Tony wanted Bucky out, there must be a good reason. Or at least, Steve hoped.
Like everything that happened before this wasn’t enough.
“Who is this?” another man asked.
“Are you okay?” Tony literally fell as he checked on him.
“Yes young fella, I’m here,” Bucky replied. Steve could hear the smile in his voice.
How are Steve and Tony going to patch their relationship up? :")
“Yeah, why attack us if the leader can take the second stone without any problem?” Daredevil asked.
She nodded. After gulping down her drink, she turned to Steve. “So this is your life?” she asked softly. “Danger everywhere you go.”
After at least 3 arguments, everyone had decided to watch Forrest Gump. They had also decided to eat dinner first and then watch the film together. Tony brought them to their entertainment lounge. It was in a soundproof room and had a big screen. There were a couple of couches around. It looked like a mini theatre.
The other three nodded solemnly.
“Oh God, why is my Spidey senses tingling?” he asked himself.
“Yes Steve, everyone except Stark,” Sam chuckled. “Go on, talk to him. Both of you need to talk. Seriously, you both need to be locked in a room or in some place to have a good talk before coming back here.” Sam smiled and gave Steve’s shoulder an encouraging squeeze.
Happy reading! PS, this is my first time posting a smut here, please bare with me haha!
Steve didn’t say anything. He just kept looking at Tony, the glare changing into a look of concern. “I’m not gonna allow him to touch you, Tony.”
“I’ve watched Forrest Gump twice already. I’d like to view the videos, please.”
Tony held Steve’s hand as he pulled him closer. “Let’s go because you, can’t be patient.”
For now, happy reading!
Tony took his visitor badge and made his way to the gantry that led to the elevators. The security guards greeted him enthusiastically.
“There’s fucking blood running down your shirt man!” Clint exclaimed.
“We will,” Natasha smiled. Bruce had already patched Tony up, using the first-aid kit S.H.I.E.L.D had provided them with.
“Why, Clint?” Natasha asked him with a neutral face.
“No,” Tony practically whined. Tears formed in his eyes. It was easy for him to say something snarky, being the King of Timing. But apologies were never his strong suit. “Please give me a few minutes, Steve. I want to make an apology.” Steve nodded.
“Alright, Tony and Steve, both of you take the shovels and dig a deep hole,” Bruce instructed. Both took their items and went up to level one. “Wanda, we’ll look at your path again. You need to use your powers to carry the stone from here all the way up there. Follow me.” Wanda nodded her head. “And you three, stay here. Don’t touch the stone.”
“Has he ever told you any place he finds great to calm himself down?” Jarvis asked.
“We brought out Fantasticar so no problems,” Reed smiled at Bruce. “And I’ll be visiting Tony once he comes out of the medical unit.”
And it did. The portal closed with another extremely violent huff of wind.
I hope you guys enjoy the new chapter and the story.
Just a level below, Steve was with little Tony in his room.
“You’re sort of ruining my presentation here,” Tony sounded casual on the outside. But on the inside, a million things were running. He had dissed Whitney, his ex who gave him nightmares! He had just done that and he couldn’t be more proud of himself! He couldn’t wait to tell this to so many people.
“I really loved the roller coaster,” Natasha smiled, and Steve overheard that.
“Flame on!” Johnny shouted enthusiastically before flying off.
“You really did throw yourself into the activities,” Bruce noted.
Once he lifted Mjolnir, 4-year-old Tony felt the power surging through him. He forgot everything about being worthy and all. Right now, he was focused on saving his own ass from these men dressed in ugly yellow suits.
“Boss, armor integrity is weak. I highly do not recommend what you’re doing,” the AI said. And she sounded worried.
Once the stone came into view, the Doctor opened a portal. Steve could see a few wooden cupboards. There were things in it, like special ornaments and some of them were stored inside other glass cabinets. It was New York, the place where Doctor Strange currently resided. Steve suddenly wanted to go back to New York, to the Tower or the compound, where he felt at home. But he knew he couldn’t. And that made him feel very dejected. He sighed. The little children inside the house gave him some hope; they made him happy. He wanted to go on for them, for his good friends.
“We see that all the time,” Clint rolled his eyes. And then, a brilliant idea hit him. “Guys! We need to take a quick polaroid!”
Once he reached the Tower’s basement, he ran to his Audi. He quickly jumped in and sped out of the Tower.
“Fine… But my dad himself couldn’t dig up anything,” Tony said.
Tony continued to cruise down the highway, and Clint was looking at the seaside they were speeding by. He didn’t really want this little vacation to end. This has been one of the best trips he’s ever had in his life. He sat back and closed his eyes, enjoying the Malibu winds.
“Is there a problem?” the cashier asked from his post, as their table was fairly near the cashier counter.
It didn’t take long for Steve to realize who he was talking about. “Seemed like he made an impact in your life.” Steve went closer to him.
Within ten minutes, Steve and Tony had found themselves in the new cafe. The usual cafe jazz music was playing, and Tony felt like he was in New York City. There was a calm atmosphere in there, with the walls colored brown and cream color. There were potted plants perched on stands on the walls, and a few aesthetically pleasing photos of coffee and cakes were in between the perched plants. They had their daily specials written on a blackboard with chalks of different colors, showing the products and prices. There were tables and couches in the cafe, and the staff dressed in jeans and black shirt looked friendly.
“I did!” Sam laughed. He was hovering and firing his taser at some Frost Giants in the air along with Johnny Storm, who was shooting flames into the portal.
“I feel like pushing you down might be the right thing to do. May I do that, Mr. Rand?” Luke retorted. Danny tried not to roll his eyes and gave Luke’s shoulder a pat.
Natasha finds herself with new friends in Building D, even though she yearns to go back to her chosen family at her original apartment.
-Clint 7pm
This evening, Steve was taking both Bucky and Tony for a small walk. They had their jackets on.
“Well it kinda worked,” Sam mumbled.
“Hey I liked the basic ones! Both of you finished the strawberry and Nutella ones!” Bruce rolled his eyes. He sat back on the couch with his arms folded.
The lot of them started to walk to the elevator, where Natasha was.
“Mom,” Tony looked at her with a pleading look. “You know how he gets when he looks at my face! Why would I do that to myself?”
“Some of them are worth the keep,” Tony confessed after a few seconds of silence.
Steve was lying down on the spare bed. Baby Tony was sleeping on his chest. Baby Natasha was hugging Steve’s belly, she was on his right. Baby Wanda was on his left and she too had a hand on Steve’s belly. Baby Clint was sleeping on Steve’s thighs, his thumb was in his mouth. Baby Bruce’s head was on Steve’s left shoulder. And baby Bucky’s head was on his right shoulder. They were all asleep and looked so peaceful.
“We better reach there first, Tony!” Clint grinned. He kept looking behind, to make sure Nat and the others were still in second place. “They’re gonna fucking overtake! Do something!!”
“Oh, hey Tony,” Reed let out a nervous laugh as he turned to his good friend. “Welcome to the headquarters of the Fantastic Four.”
He avoided looking at either Clint or Thor. This was the most honest he’s ever been to either of them.
“You two ran down the hallway?” Steve asked with an amused expression.
“I’m okay I guess,” Tony replied. “It’s just that the room is too bright, especially the light coming from that little window. Plus, why’s everything so white outside?”
Tony raised an eyebrow. “You didn’t desert me when I had my nightmares. Nor did you push Bruce away when he wasn’t talking to us. You have my word, we won’t push you away.”
Thank you for the support everyone! I hope you all enjoy this chapter. Happy reading!
“Gosh, Jan would have loved this,” Tony smiled. “She was always into fine dining.”
“Abandoning your date, Rogers?” Tony asked, eating another piece of cake, as Steve settled back down.
And then, the ride began. Tony could hear Clint’s scream already slowly starting. He chuckled to himself.
Steve walked to Tony and crouched down in front of him. “Tony?” he asked softly.
“You pals gave me one of the best wake up calls I had in years,” Clint mumbled.
Steve sent the boys with Thor. He was holding both the boys close to him and was walking to the portal opened by Doctor Strange. It was opened near the place Luke and Jessica were fighting.
Tony looked up. “What do you mean? I created you and that means you can share with me anything, especially something like a fire incident.”
The plane continued to make its final descent. Within ten minutes, they were having a smooth touchdown in LAX.
Upstairs, Thor opened his eyes. “Mjolnir, to me!” he commanded.
“You alright?” Bruce asked.
“Friday, wake me up in 4 hours. I still need to finish up Clint’s shit and then meet Reed later,” Tony ordered before knocking out.
“Mr. Stark!” Peter said. He ran to where Tony was and stopped abruptly in front of the wheelchair. “How uh… how are you?”
“This is Steve’s haven,” Natasha said.
“I love you too, Cap,” little Tony said softly. Steve’s enhanced hearing had picked that up, fortunately.
Thor swung his hammer quickly, for flight, and launched himself upward. He caught Sam and sprinkled the Puddle of Truth liquid on him. Sam changed back to his adult self within a matter of seconds. He continued to circle around the area while Thor returned back down.
“Firstly, I’m not going to leave you, even if you fall sick,” Steve said, pursing his lips. “Secondly, I came after you that night after watching the video because I needed to know if it was true or not, whether you liked me. I had to hear it from you directly, despite the video evidence. Because Tony, I really do like you.”
Bruce nodded his head. “So… AIM created a device that can transport you to limbo and to the past, and bring your younger self from the same time period to the present time. Impressive.”
Tony decided to hide under the big bed, pretty sure Thor wouldn’t be able to find him underneath. He caught a glimpse of a few photo frames that was on the bedside table. And Tony froze.
In the evening, the six of them were getting ready to go to the restaurant in Sunset Boulevard. It was a Steakhouse, with a formal setting. Tony had taken the extra mile to book a Limousine for the six of them.
Steve let out a laugh. He then looked down, trying to locate Tony. But the crowd was too much, and he couldn’t find him.
“Tony!” Pepper’s voice sounded more excited than she had ever sounded.
“Alright. It’s 20 minutes, split into two parts.” Linda took out her phone. She gave it to Tony and joined Clint on the floor.
And this moment will be remembered by the six of them, as the time when Steve spat his red wine out, across the table, and Tony nearly choking on his Caesar salad.
At this time, Tony realized something. “You know, if my dad had found you earlier, this would’ve been us then!”
She pushed Steve's, Bucky's and Tony's thoughts out of her mind. She could only wonder how the three of them would come together. They seem willing to but not ready to.
“Oh my God...” Bruce whispered. He was lost. It was night and it was getting cold. Bruce didn’t know where he had landed. He was on the middle of the road. He was happy, for a second when he realized he did not de-age.
Tony slowly turned to look at Steve. He couldn’t help but also feel the warmth of his hands, which were protectively enveloped around Tony’s own hand. But the moment didn’t last long.
“We’re gonna move you to the wheelchair,” Steve said. He began helping Tony up to his feet. But when Tony cried in pain, he helped him sit back down on the bed again. “You know what, I’m gonna do what I’m good at.”
What do you think Peter has for Tony?
“It couldn’t have been that bad, right?” Tony turned to her. It took him some time to realize that all of their worst nightmares had come true.
One of the AIM guys was thrown to where Tony was standing. He landed at Tony’s feet. Tony quickly moved back, but stopped when he realized he was standing at the edge, near the broken window. He had also accidentally kicked a few pieces of glass below.
“Alright, let’s go.” Clint motioned for Thor to follow him out.
After a sigh, Clint spoke. “Look man, whatever I said in the raft prison, I hope you didn’t take it to heart. I was in a bad shape and I was pretty pissed getting arrested. And then you came, it just got messier. So I’m sorry.”
“We can talk.” Doctor Strange now said firmly, directed at the Frost Giant. “I know where the stone is, and I can lead you there.”
The six of them left the eatery after paying and walked down to the beach. They then chose a shady spot and placed their items down. Natasha kicked out her sandals and ran to the shore, with Clint skipping behind her. Steve, who was still folding up his jeans, was dragged to the shore by an enthusiastic Thor.
“Kayla, where is the lab?” Tony stood up.
Sam considered this. “I’m surprised he doesn’t know yet. I mean, he’s a smart guy!”
“And if she finds us?” Wanda piped up.
Butterfingers, who was arranging the tools neatly on Tony’s workspace turned to face him, pushing down all the tools at once. He gave a whirring noise that sounded like exasperation.
“Point taken,” Steve smiled.
“Jesus fuck!” Tony exclaimed, a little too loudly. Steve raised an eyebrow at his boyfriend’s behavior.
Hi guys!!
“You better get to him and drive home first,” Natasha gave Tony’s shoulder a nudge. “I’ll get the others.”
“So that happened,” Natasha said while taking another piece of strawberry from the box. “He walked in before you accessed the files….”
“I’m so glad they are alright,” Wanda asserted. She was smiling. She was ready to let the past be the past and work with all of them again.
“Clean up and come down in a while,” Ana smiled. “Lunch is ready!”
You can freely leave a feedback. I'd be happy to read it!!
“Genius, out of every way you could have gone to that alley!” Tony chuckled.
“Is this how lightly you’re gonna take it?” Steve nearly growled.
“Steeb,” baby Natasha turned to him. “Ish okee.” She gave his cheek a peck. He gave her forehead a kiss in return.
“Look at you!” Clint grinned. Everyone turned behind to look at Tony entering the pool area. He was wearing an over-sized t-shirt with shorts.
The gym lights dimmed down further as he and Steve walked out of it. And things were well… fucking awkward.
Hi everyone! Here's the next chapter as promised.
Sam was more than willing to do so. He helped Rhodey up and guided him to the kitchen, where he wanted to get a cup of mixed fruit juice.
“So Tony? Where’s the food truck?” Natasha asked, taking out her sunglasses.
They were staring at about a two-year-old baby boy, completely naked and drooling onto the floor. They also heard sounds coming from beside the baby and behind the lab table.
“A few of master Stark’s friends,” Jarvis replied politely while pouring Howard a mug of coffee.
Hey everyone! I hope you guys are fine. Thank you for all your support so far, I really appreciate them. :)
“I fear the wrath of a Captain if we dare speak of that matter, Tony,” Thor grinned.
“Yeah, he’s not even in the Tower,” Natasha sat back. “You actually made him go to work.”
“But you love us!!” Tony turned to him. When Clint had a little pout and wasn’t replying, Tony went up to his face. “You love us right, right, right?”
Tony shrugged. He slowly pulled himself to bed anyways. Steve joined him on the other side. He asked F.R.I.D.A.Y to reduce the light entering the room.
“Only one way to find out, Tony,” Scott replied. “Do you trust me?”
Thor returned that early morning. With the help of Heimdall, he got to know his friends’ location. He was also aware of their situation. He made a stopover in Iceland, at the Puddle of Truth in a forest. That Puddle was only available to those who truly needed it when they were in that forest. Hence, it was difficult to make it appear.
Both of them went to the elevator. They went a few levels down and exited it.
“This is where the guys will be,” Linda said.
Both of them took the elevator to the last level in a comfortable silence.
“Oh Steve,” Clint turned to Steve. “Did you know how loud you and your bae were last night?”
“The couch, or, or with the girls. Come on Bruce!”
or any of his best friends in front of his face! He kicked the Frost Giant’s back and grabbed him. He punched his stomach and then his face. The force of the blows only made the Frost Giant stagger.
“Hi everyone,” both Linda and Kayla waved at the others.
The team was seated in the living room after a filling lunch. Linda insisted they tried her meatball spaghetti, which she prepared. They liked it. It was delicious and just the meal they needed to placate their famished stomachs. After this, Clint suggested they had a “house tour” so that they could get to know their hideout better. Both Kayla and Linda agreed to this.
She turned to look at Steve, in disbelief. “We actually did it.” She whispered this. Linda didn’t realize that her eyes were welling up. Steve smiled softly at her. He pulled her for a tight hug.
“Oh my God…” Bruce whispered to himself.
Tony sighed and leaned back, resting his head Steve’s shoulder. He closed his eyes as he munched on a popcorn.
He really missed her.
“‘That’s okay,” Steve smiled. “So, do you want to know if I have feelings for you?”
“You’re Iron Man!” she pointed at the suit and jumped up and down.
Steve obviously didn’t catch the meaning behind her question but Peter sure did. His eyes widened in alarm and he immediately turned to look at them. “No… no no,” Peter said. “That’s another Steve from Brooklyn who caused the injuries! This is… this is
“Alright F.R.I.D.A.Y.” Tony shifted back on his seat. He was looking out of the window.
Tony jogged back to 6-39 after his special date with Steve. The entire time up the elevator, Tony was smiling like a fool while remembering Steve being a cute idiot during the date. Gosh, Tony loved Steve so much it hurt. He’s muscular and wants to look tough but God help him, he’s just a softie inside.
Clint huffed and got ready to play again. And the heated game went on for the next half-an-hour, with Clint and Thor taking leads multiple times.
“When will he wake up?” Steve asked them.
Tony snorted at that. He and Bruce were seated on the hood and were grinning at the others.
“This was a bad idea, Tony,” Clint said.
“You seem to remember me!” Natasha laughed while gently pinching Tony on his cheek. Tony flinched at that. “Oh my, did that hurt? What happened to you, angel moy?”
“Oh crap, the Limo guy is here,” Tony said while looking at his phone. “I’ll go alert the others!”
“You shut the fuck up!” Howard shouted at her. He managed to push Jarvis away and walked towards Tony, who had two people being a shield for him.
“You know, I could actually stand you know,” Tony said.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sam walked to where Tony was seated. He looked out the window. “The skies are clear.” Sam bent down more to take a better look.
“I really like the attire color idea,” one of the directors said. He was all smiles, wearing rectangle framed glasses spotting a few grey hairs. “We’ll let HR know and they’ll come up with a plan.”
“What?!” Natasha asked with an incredulous look on her face. “Why?”
That was when it had hit Steve, that Tony had heard the apology he had given to him when he was de-aged. “You actually can recall that? You were a baby!”
“Jarvis, what’s on the docket for today?”
Tony scrambled to get up. He threw himself onto Steve, hugging him. Steve let out a shaky sigh and hugged him back.
I have a new Tumblr account where I post textposts! Come check it out and say hi vanillaavengerlings.tumblr.com
“Hey, how’s Rhodey?” Tony asked Carol.
“I really want to fix things.” Bucky started. He placed a hand on Tony’s shoulder. “I’m really sorry for what I did then. It wasn’t me. I couldn’t control and they were doing things to me, which made it worse. And the arm, it’s fine man. Really. It’s ok really, although I’d like to have one.”
Bruce passed it to her without a comment. Everyone else were looking at her. She switched on the television and straight away turned on a News channel. She gasped. So did the others.
Thor decided to soften the stone first. He was kneeling while holding it and submerged it into the Puddle. It was already seven minutes and the stone only showed little signs of softening. Tony and Scott were sitting on two separate big rocks, in front of the protective eyes of Thor.
Thor’s hammer was on the road, outside the force field.
Steve pulled away gently. Tony sighed when he opened his eyes again, this time looking like he just came back from a spa session.
Jarvis immediately showed him all the reports and footage of the Hulk through the holographic screen. And Tony read the report while watching the footage. He saw the Hulk fighting the Abomination on a street. He also saw the footage of the Avengers, with Hulk fighting alongside them.
Happy reading!
“There they are!” Sam was grinning. “I called them once the battle ended and helped them with getting here.”
“Yeah. He seems to plan to do something bigger. Which I wanted to let you know. Phil Coulson has already let the team know about this.”
Below, a subtle blue glow formed around Tony’s body. His eyes were once again turning light blue, and he managed to keep himself awake. He then allowed the hammer to guide him, and they both dived down toward the ground.
“You need to talk to him, Steve,” Sam sighed after removing his hand wrap.
