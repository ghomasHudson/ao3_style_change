Tony hadn’t been prepared for Steve’s straightforward declaration of being “in like” with him and his hotel-notepad flowers, that much was certain.  It made his stomach flutter and drop and his chest go tight just thinking about it, like he needed some kind of swooning couch or maybe a nice moor to run across while considering Steve’s nicely shaped…ankle.  Or…something, he thought with a sigh as he mentally settled on the sea bass.
“Want you inside me, Steve,” Tony said huskily, making Steve moan, because they hadn’t done that, except that one night, Tony’s need to be in control leeching over into the bedroom as well, which was just fine with Steve most of the time, but God, the sound of those words….Steve felt his cock get impossibly harder and was a bit surprised he didn’t just spill right then and there.  Tony was undoing his pants and he kicked his shoes off and lifted his hips to help the other man remove them.  He felt a warm hand wrap around his cock for a moment and then Tony was reaching for the tube in the nightstand and rolling over to lay next to Steve.  Without thinking, Steve took the tube from Tony and stared at it a moment before enough blood managed to make it to his brain to catch up.  Oh.  Okay, then.  He struggled to a sitting position and moved between Tony’s legs as he spread them to accommodate him.
“Breaks the spell, I guess,” Tony finished for him with a small sigh.
“Because he needs to be warm when he wakes up or he panics,” Tony continued, ignoring Fury.  “He makes himself swim, every God-damn morning, even though he hates it, and I’ve never hated an inanimate object as much as I hate that fucking pool, I swear to God, I’m going to fill it with cement, and I’m telling you, you can’t send him out there without the team.  He isn’t ready.  I don’t care what he stood there and told you.”
“Excuse me, ladies.  Gentlemen.  May I borrow my husband for a moment?” Tony asked, cutting in to the circle of guests surrounding Steve.  “Won’t take long.  Just a few more pictures.”
“Morning, Jolly Green, how’s it going?” Tony asked conversationally.
“They come and eat my food and drink my wine and give me some dust-catching statue in return.  Honor has nothing to do with it,” the King replied. There was a loud thump, followed by a clattering sound, and Steve watched as parts of whatever the King had been working on scattered and fell from the table.  “Ah, damn it all to hell!” the King shouted, and a sweeping sound sent the whole thing crashing across the table.  A long sigh followed. Then quiet.  “And what does my harem Master want this time?  Surely, Lord Hammer is in dire need of your services this evening, what with it being a day where the sun rises and sets,” the King said in a tight, rough voice that reeked of annoyance at the distraction.
“It’s a fixer-upper, I’ll grant you,” Tony agreed, looking around at the peeling paint.  Probably lead-based.  Over asbestos.  “But, anyway, I get it.  For me, problem solved.  You didn’t take the money.  You love me.  Really, actually love me.  You do. Even Barnes came this close,” Tony continued, holding out his thumb and forefinger an inch apart.  “To admitting that.  Much as it might have pained him.  But, for you…I—I do hear what you’re saying.  I’m not…I’m not ignoring you.  Or—or downplaying what you’re saying.  Jesus, would you--I could really validate your feelings a lot better if you’d slow down a second and look at me,” Tony huffed out.
“Fury tell you to say that?” Steve retorted with a caustic bite to it.  He was tired of the whole thing.  Coulson, the doctors, the therapist, Fury, the team.  Everything was a manipulation.
It likely was, not that Steve was able to appreciate it much, other than the plush, cushioned seats, for which he had said a grateful prayer of thanks this morning.  Any other time, and he may have appreciated the beauty and attention to detail that had surely gone into their conveyance.  Tony’s hand, no doubt. The man might prefer building his machines, but he had an artist’s eye, Steve knew.  The carriage was meant to draw attention, clearly, and proclaim something that Steve thought he only barely understood. Tony could not say some things with words, so he opted for elaborate gifts or public spectacle, but he meant something by all of it, and the carriage, like Steve’s collar and the ring he wore, was one of those things that was meant to say more than what Tony could speak.
“A worthy goal, we both agree,” Steve said with a grin.  Tony let out a low huff of a laugh and ran his hands up and down over Steve’s legs where they circled him in the large tub.
The thing was, he
“---I mean by making things worse,” Fury was saying.  Tony peeked around the corner far enough to see Fury with his hands on his hips, pacing back and forth in a small line, while Steve leaned against the wall, looking about as interested in what Fury had to say as Tony usually was.  “Look, Cap, I get it, okay?  I’m not saying what the guy did was on the up and up.”
Stane moved closer, and Steve could smell stale cigar on him, sickly sweet.  “I’d hate to see that happen to Tony, after all the hard work he’s done, wouldn’t you, Steve?  I hope I can count on you to do the right thing here.  For Tony.”
“In here,” Tony said, pointing to a large, glass-enclosed room that held a grand piano and a few comfortable looking sofas.
Tony’s tongue plundered Steve’s mouth for long minutes.  He didn’t seem to be in any hurry to get to the main event, which was fine by Steve.  Steve laid his arms on each side of Tony’s head and wound his fingers into Tony’s damp hair.  Tony liked to move, Steve figured out pretty quickly, and he seemed to be quite enjoying taking his time, even if Steve was pretty much a sure thing.  Slow, languorous motions.  Back and neck arching into it. Bodies writhing together.  Feet teasing up and down the backs of Steve’s legs.  Hands exploring Steve’s shoulders and the sensitive sides of his ribcage. Wanton, shameless, carefree touches that were slowly driving Steve crazy. Each movement seemed to be punctuated by small moans and gasps against Steve’s mouth, pants of air and low groans, building to a chorus of pleasure between them.
Tony would listen to him, surely.  Tony would believe him. Even if it wasn’t what Tony wanted to hear, even if it would hurt him, as Steve suspected it would.  It was a risk, certainly, Steve knew that much.  It would be easier to simply offer himself to Tony in supplication and hope Tony’s desire for him was enough to sustain whatever this was long enough to gain a place at Tony’s side when he did take his desert journey.  Steve couldn’t do that, though.  It wasn’t sustainable.  He knew that much about himself.  He had to know if he was truly right about the kind of man Tony was or if he was weaving little more than a fanciful story so as to keep from hating himself.
Tony pushed himself up, straddling Steve’s waist, his hands exploring Steve’s chest.  Slowly, almost delicately, he pushed Steve’s shirt up, revealing his stomach and chest, the material lightly grazing over his nipples in a way that Steve thought might be deliberate.  He was sure of it when Tony gave him a rakish grin, bent over and took one of the tight, pink nubs into his mouth, sucking hard on it, making Steve gasp. His eyes flew wide open and his back arched into the feeling, a pang of heat and pressure bursting behind his cock and traveling down his length to pool in a pulsing need at the head.  Embarrassed shame coursed through him, and Steve thought he must surely object, people didn’t do this, did they?  His body seemed to disagree, though, as heaving, stuttering breaths punched out of him as Tony sucked harder, almost painfully so.
good thing I’ve done in my damn life.”
“His friend found one of the balloons they let go one time.  It had a postcard inside.  Got ten dollars from Macy’s for returning it,” Tony said.
“I was talking to your compatriot there, Rogers,” Phillips snorted.
“Get it over a mile and I’ll put on that other little red number you like so much,” Tony threw in as Steve leaned down to place the ball on the rug in front of firepit.
“That's not true,” Tony protested weakly. “He's always had the side nearest to the door--”
“Th-thanks,” Tony stuttered, grinding his teeth together to halt any more words before they escaped.  “So. Tomorrow, then, huh?  Observatory?”
Tony stared at Steve, turning the words over and over in his head as he did.  As much as he pulled them apart, he couldn’t find anything but actual affection there, even if it was the kind Steve felt for his mom, which, okay, fine.  Never thought he’d be depressed at the lack of Greek tragedy in his life, but whatever.  He thought about the way his equations and data sets calmed him, helped him find order in a world he couldn’t control, and wondered if the simple tasks of taking care of Tony in a world that demanded a soldier maybe did the same thing for Steve.
Brock couldn’t have done this, of course.  Steve understood that well enough.  Their current financial situation was the reason he was here, after all.  But, well, really, it wasn’t so much about the extravagance of the evening, though that was nice in and of itself, sure, but it made something slightly uncomfortable lodge itself in Steve’s chest, like a little hitch when he breathed, this idea that Tony might have done this--at least this part of the night--on Steve’s account. For him. To make him happy.
They rode up the elevator in silence.  Tony assumed this was largely because they didn’t need words to communicate and also because Tony was busy sniffing Steve, who smelled positively wonderful, and he should see about bottling that scent, but he couldn’t sell it, of course not, because then other people could smell Steve and know how wonderful he smelled and that would be bad, because this was for him.
“I am home.”
“Slaves can’t wield weapons, though.  On penalty of death. It’s the law,” the boy added, as if reciting by rote.
“The impossible,” Tony replied, staring at nothing for a moment before his eyes filled again and he looked down at Steve.  “Nothing for you to worry over.  Eventually, I’ll marry, of course, and likely find as much joy there as my parents did, but it is naught that needs to weigh on your mind, my dearest.  Marriage changes little for Kings, as my Mother quickly learned. It certainly need not…alter anything with you.”
.  He didn’t know.  He had the odd sensation of floating, warm water cocooning him, the rush of it filling his ears with a constant susurration that blocked out anything else.
“No,” Steve replied quickly.
When Tony got back to the penthouse, there was already a message from Jarvis, letting him know the Quin-Jet was on its way back, sans one ex-Rooskie. Tony sat down on the couch and let his head fall back against the curve of the back. He steepled his hands over his face and breathed out, then let them fall to his lap. He could feel his heart pounding in his chest like each beat was bouncing off the reactor, clanging through his ears, but his hands were steady as he popped the lock on the metal band around his wrist and slid it off. He set it on the glass coffee table in front of him and ran a thumb over the lighter circle of skin there, just over the spiderweb of blue veins pulsing underneath.
“I just—“
“Kinky,” Tony replied, a smile spreading over his face as he pulled Steve closer and wound his arms around Steve’s neck.
“No,” Stane said, almost amiably.  “I suppose you can’t.” Stane picked up a small package, which had a white lily on top of it, which Steve knew was the gift Tony meant for him. He wanted to stalk across the room and knock it out of Stane’s hand, but held himself back out of sheer determination. Stane set it down without opening it and went on to the next bauble, disinterested in the actual items, but seeming to enjoy Steve’s reaction.
Steve sighed and glanced over at the table, where the stack of ledgers he hadn’t had the heart to sift through sat by a vase filled with white lilies gleamed under the dotted shadows of a hanging oil lamp.  Every day, without fail, they appeared, the lilies.  He walked over and took one of the velvety petals between his fingers.
Fuck, okay. Okay, he could do this, Steve told himself.  He was here to help Tony.  That was the whole point.  But, not—God, not like
“Mothballs,” Steve interjected with a wrinkle of his nose.
“If I built weapons, would you use them?” Tony questioned, gaze going sharp.
“I do,” Tony replied. The words pulled at Steve, tugging his memories along the way a sharp wind pushes you to one side or another.  Blue light.  Blue light, a nighthawk crying in the dark, footsteps...
Love is always a question, waiting for an answer.
“Yeah,” Tony said softly, after a beat.  “I’m going to be here.”
“Yeah, well, probably not going to happen, so,” Tony said brusquely.  “I mean, you’re, what, on-call with SHIELD for whatever it is you do, and I’m—“ He was what?  Busy?  That was a fucking laugh.  I’m busy building a missile named in honor of a furry rodent because that’s the deepest interpersonal relationship I’ve had in a while.  So, cross Switzerland off the list, Steve-o.
And with that, she hung up.
"It's really fucked up. They're so brainwashed...it makes me think that I could so easily have turned into one of these people and there's nothing I could have done about it unless someone had pulled me out," said Steve.  "...thanks, Jorge."
Donner didn't move.
...oh, I give up..."
He blinked, then realized it hadn't been his.
A hand shot up instantly, the question coming from a non-descriptive man in a suit. "How important is it for your omega to be aroused for getting pregnant?"
"I don't think it's controversial," Steve said.
Despite his best efforts to get cleaned up, he looked like a wreck.
Tony said all this with a forced lightness that meant he'd obviously done his research but was hoping Steve wouldn't notice.
Their afternoon sight-seeing was cut short by the meeting with Peter Wisdom.  He was a well-dressed man with dark hair who spoke in a clipped British accent.  Tony found him immediately likeable. They chatted about politics over a late lunch in a posh restaurant across the street from MI-13 headquarters.
Dr. Brennan listened to Steve with a smile.  "...I'm guessing you didn't see a lot of healthy trios in the thirties and forties," she said.  "...nowadays, it's not nearly as rare to see an omega as the father or at the head of a trio. I won't lie; it's not exactly common.  But it's certainly not taboo, either."
"That's weird.  You'd think all those uber-dominant Alphas would
"Yeah.  You can come, Steve," added Tony.  "I'll just be a sec."
Kitty came up beside him and showed him how it fastened, but didn't put it on for him. She was small and probably would have struggled to reach properly anyway. Steve exhaled slowly again to reach up and put it on. He wanted to punch a wall. Maybe when they got back to the hotel he could do some boxing, or something?
"What...what actual day is it?" Steve asked, suddenly realising he'd lost track. They were how many days into their honeymoon? And how many days would be left? Steve sighed. "These days have just been a blur of sex and sleep and not much else."
argue," he added, seeming rather proud of this.  "Him and Trickshot argued all the time, and look what happened.  He distanced the bond and sent Trickshot away and I bet Trickshot ended up somewhere real bad.  Don't tell me there weren't auctions in the forties." His voice softened. "I hope Trickshot found his brother.  But his brother was an omega, too, and he probably got sold off a long time ago. And everyone knows used-up horseshoes don't go nice places.  Us here, we're all the lucky ones." He hugged his knees and looked over at the bedroom door, and his lips quirked up in a smile. "You know the last three times I got betted off, the Alpha was too drunk to do anything?  It kinda all works out. That's what we gotta do, as horseshoes, just trust that it'll work out. And it does, usually, especially if you behave yourself."
thing in the 21st century."
“Then we’ll do that together, too,” Tony promised. “I want all of you. Every piece, even the broken ones,” Tony continued, cupping Steve’s jaw in his hands. Steve could feel the worn, rough places there, familiar now, and still comforting. Strong, solid hands that fixed things. Fixed broken things. He could not ask Tony to fix him, he knew that much, but there was a calm sort of warmth in knowing that Tony did not fear broken things, would not run from them or see them as useless. Tony always saw more than what was there. He saw what could be, and maybe that could be enough for Steve, if he let it. He so very much wanted to let it be enough. “You swore yourself to your king. Can you do the same to the man?” Tony asked, clutching at the leather of Steve’s tunic, voice trembling with the effort.
Tony blinked at him, then opened and closed his mouth.  “Okay.  How can you even play Jenga?”
“Who said a relationship?  I said a date,” Natasha pointed out, swallowing the last of her drink and raising her hand to get the bartender’s attention for another round.  “He’d show you a good time.  That, I can guarantee.”
“Thought maybe Natasha would’ve given you a head’s up,” Stark said, eyeing Steve shrewdly.
The ceremony itself was short.  No one laughed at Steve’s attire, though he did get a questioning look from Lord Pierce.  Alexander, he corrected.  He should at least try to get used to the name.  A gift from the King, Steve had told him later, while the guests lingered over dinner and wine that tasted bitter on his tongue.  He is most generous, Pierce had agreed, though now, as Steve climbed the stairs to the Lord’s bedchamber, he recalled thinking it had sounded odd, the way Pierce said it.  Not truly like he meant it as a compliment.   The wine, Steve told himself.  He rarely drank, but his cup kept being refilled and he told himself it was rude to waste his new husband’s stores like that.  He blamed Thor, though it could have been Natasha. Which meant it had probably been all Clint’s doing, Steve thought with a sigh.  Too much wine, and now he was seeing things that were not there.
They walked the path back to the village together, hand in hand, and Steve was reminded of his mother’s words again. A door between worlds, he thought, and I’ve come out the other side.  The desiccated village glowed with a ring of light from the fires lit by the soldiers where they camped at the edges.  The beach was almost smooth, the familiar rocks that had littered it for hundreds of years having now found their final resting place.  It was fitting, Steve thought, that the sea should deliver their cairn.  They were people of the water, and had not deserved to end in ash and smoke.
Steve stepped forward and reached out a hand, taking the tags into his fist.  He lifted his gaze to Tony’s eyes.
“You did.  You did, but then, with the armor and all…you kept putting this off,” Steve said, mouth flattening with a frown, like the word tasted bad.  Maybe it did to him.   Steve was being all Steve about the armor, and half of Tony wanted him to rail against it and half wanted Steve to love it, and he didn’t know how to thread those wants together.
“Oh, God,” Tony moaned, throwing his arm over his face.  “Please stop speaking about thinking about me fucking you.  I’m—look at me, Steve, I’m getting hard from words.  Words, Steve.  Not even sexy words, just, you know, basic, run-of-the-mill words.”
Stepping out of the shower and turning off the water, Steve swiped a hand over the fogged-up mirror, staring at his reflection.  This had to stop.  Whether Tony suspected or not, something was clearly driving a wedge between them, something Tony seemed unwilling to talk about, which really, that left precious few things.  Emotions and feelings being top of that list.  So, it seemed likely that Tony had some inkling of how Steve felt about him and it was making him wildly uncomfortable.  Steve knew he couldn’t compartmentalize this part of his attraction to Tony from the emotional part. The only solution was to stop all of it.  Not that he thought he could simply turn it off like a…well, like a faucet, but he could certainly train himself to stop making it an issue.  That started with leaving these…these fantasies behind and letting that part of it go.  He could do that.  He could definitely do that.
It struck him, as he hefted a craggy chunk of stone that the sea had claimed from the cliffs long ago, that some of the soldiers who had volunteered had not done it out of duty to a title, and, not for the first time, felt humbled by their show of loyalty. It is dreams that stir the souls of men, Steve mentally repeated, and they had come here, to honor the dead, to grieve, to rebuild.  What is grief, if not the hope that it passes, that there is something beyond it?  As terrible as the deeds done here were, most people were capable of nearly unbearable acts of incredible grace, if only given the chance.
“Probably,” Tony admitted, but made no move to do so.  He heard Steve sigh, then felt himself pulled against the solid bulk of Steve’s chest.  One of Steve’s hands was carding through his hair, over and over, in a soothing motion, while the other stayed low on his back.  Tony folded his arms between them and gripped the front of Steve’s shirt with his hands.  The shaking was subsiding as the surge of adrenaline wore off.  It was still all too surreal to really begin to process, Tony decided somewhat hazily as he melted into Steve’s warmth.  His car was at the bottom of a mountain.  It was impossible, sure, but almost seemed like it wasn’t even the most impossible thing that had happened in the last fifteen minutes, so dealing with that could just fuck off until he had time to wrap his head around Steve’s words.
“Careful. You’ll tear that open again,” Natasha warned, giving a quick glance over her shoulder to the open ramp.  Tony swiveled his head in the same direction, wincing as the sudden movement sent a stitch of pain through the side of his chest.
“Glad to hear it,” Steve said, shaking his head and wiping away a laugh, though he had to bite his lip to keep from smiling.
“Lady Van Dyne…” Steve began, letting the name trail off.  “You know her well, then?”
“Not ink blots,” Steve said, biting the inside of his cheek so as not to smile.  He sat back and looked at the rough outline of a figure, all circles and lines at the moment, though it was starting to take shape.  “Like using art to help people solve problems, reduce stress.  Heal.  That kind of thing.”
“You mean how you’re ridiculously in love with our mutual teammate and are using your secret identity to stealth date him while simultaneously using your friendship with said teammate to talk up yourself in the hopes that he’ll see the error of his ways?  That whole thing with you-know-who?” Rhodey asked.
“I said I’m fine,” Tony shouted.  He went over and sat down at his workstation.  The missile designs for what he was calling the Jericho were sitting exactly where Steve had noticed them.  A spiteful part of him, the part of him that wanted to punish himself for messing up, kept trying to tell his brain to ball them up and throw them away.
Steve took a deep breath and looked at some point over Tony’s shoulder, before dropping his gaze back to Tony and shoving his hands in his pockets.  “You’re not wrong,” Steve admitted.
Still, Tony listened, even if it wasn’t what he wanted to hear, even if he denied it or rationalized it, he listened, and that was something.  Something Zola and his ilk feared, Steve knew.  Zola and this Lord Stane and whoever else was pulling at the threads around here, they never wanted Steve to mean anything to Tony. They never wanted him to be more than a passing distraction, turning Tony’s attention from whatever it was they didn’t want him to see.  And here Steve was, giving those forces exactly what they hoped.  He knew what he would say to Tony.  It was the truth, as hard as it may be for Tony to hear, but it was a truth that Steve knew served his own purposes, too, and he couldn’t help but wonder if it could really be both a truth and a manipulation.
The words washed over Steve, swept him up from whatever trough he had been mired in and over a kind of hill, then down, down, down, into warmth, like the heat of Tony’s bath, but at the same time, something completely different.  He didn’t have a word for it.  Better than that.  Better than anything.  The pain, the aches, the itch, the need the swallow, slowly, it all receded.  The tension he had been holding was gone, swept away along with everything else.  Not everything at once, not even in succession, but a sort of overlapping stretch of time where it all just faded.  Not gone, not entirely, but…distant.  Somewhere behind him.  It didn’t matter.  This mattered.  Tony’s cock, warm and heavy and thick in his mouth.  The heat rolling off the juncture of Tony’s thighs.  The smell, musk and metal and the soap from the bath.  The weight of Tony’s hand where it held him.  The occasional stroke of Tony’s thumb. There was a callus there, healing now, but still rough enough for Steve to feel it scratch across his skin, good and hard and
“Met some Air Force pilots, have you?’ Tony asked.
Barnes gave Natasha a long look, and she said something low to him in Russian.
“Mine,” Tony cried out again and again, punctuating each word with a deep, forceful thrust that rocked Steve’s body forward against the bed.
“Any minute now,” Tony snorted. “Christ, James, what if we've lost ten years? Ten years,” he said, shaking his head like he could dislodge the number. Ten years. It kept ringing through his head, counting off like the world's most depressing metronome.
“I doubt that,” Steve said.
, and where did Steve get off knowing there was a difference--or whether Tony had noticed that Ellis’ team didn’t have a single Omega consultant or what Tony thought about the crap going down in Sokovia?  Why did Steve bother to listen when Tony got up in arms over violent rabbits, for God’s sake?
Steve looked over to watch Tony’s mouth open, then close as he watched Natasha and Rhodes depart, catching his eye and turning his face into the palm of Tony’s hand as it stroked through his hair. Dimly, he heard the others talking, the occasional spurt of laughter punctuating the conversation, but it was muffled, like he was hearing it from underwater, he thought, a fissure of unease snaking through him.  He opened his eyes, not quite sure when he had closed them, and felt the weight of Tony’s gaze on him, which seemed right, comforting and familiar, so he let his eyes fall closed again, the murmur of voices lulling him, drowning out the other thoughts that would fill his mind until there was nothing.
“Why?” Tony blurted out.  “Why…me? I’m…I’m no one. I’m--” he trailed off, dropping his gaze to the floor and feeling it pulled like a magnet to the shield.  “You’re Captain America.  I had your action figure and your…bubble bath, for Christ’s sake.  And I’m…I’m just
“You’re beautiful, Steve,” Tony whispered into his skin, the heat of the words seeming to emblazon them there, absorbing into him as they cooled. “Beautiful.”
The alien pulled away, leaving Tony feeling suddenly bereft and adrift, though the calmness remained.  Tony blinked up at the alien and breathed out a shaky breath. The alien sat up, gave Tony a forlorn look, then waved his hand and the not-gel rippled and peeled back again, leaving Tony free, albeit still very naked and, well, half-hard, but who was really counting?
“Hope so,” Steve replied, then returned to his staring contest with the window.
“You’ll do fine,” Steve assured him. “Besides, the King is…he’s not…like that.  He’s good.  I think. As good as a man who has only known power can be, anyway.”
“Maybe I’m making a funny face,” Tony tried. “I could be. You don’t know.”
“Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Steve!  What the---???  We’re going to get arrested. This…this has to be illegal.  Somehow.  Damaging a…a state forest.  Or something.  Fuck.  What the—what the hell were you thinking?” Tony demanded, voice rising in panic.  “How did you even—how?  That’s not possible.  Shit.  Holy shit, Steve.  We’re in so much trouble.  Fuck.  It wasn’t even in neutral.  This isn’t possible.”
“Tony,” Steve said again. He swiped a hand over his face, trying to clear the cobwebs from his mind.  “Tell me.”
Water is wet, Tony thought, blinking, and then realized his fingers were wet.  He looked down.    A wisp of smoke trailed up from the end of the candle, and a dribble of water dripped onto the floor.  U dropped the mostly empty water bottle onto the floor, where it landed with a dull, crunching sound.  DUM-E hurried over to pick it up.  Or, chase it as it rolled, whatever.  Can’t have everything.
“No kidding?” Steve said.
Fighting stance, Anto recognized.  He’s going to fight them. Why? Stupid, stupid man.  What was he doing? He was going to get himself killed, that was what he was doing.  There were five of them and one of him, and they had weapons, and Steve didn’t. They were going to kill him.  They were going to kill him and make Anto watch, he realized, watching as Tyber’s gaze found him across the clearing.  This was his punishment, Anto suddenly understood. Steve was going to die because of him.
“You have given me something far more precious,” Tony assured him as they walked out of the circle, hand in hand.  Steve looked back, once, but it was just a circle of stones again, like any number of others, the strange feeling of wrongness seeming to have left him as quickly as it had come.  “But, if would like that I wear a ring, we can have one made. You can even design it,” Tony was saying.
“Look, it took me a while to realize, but then I did, that night after the gala, when we danced,” Tony explained, trying to force himself to put a pause between each word when he just wanted to get them all out, so Steve would know.  He needed Steve to know.  More than anything.  He needed Steve to understand, because now Tony understood and it was wonderful.  Wonderful, exhilarating, blissful happiness. Almost too much, exploding into his head at once, making him dizzy, but the good kind, the kind where you spun yourself around and around in circles until you collapsed from it, and he needed Steve to feel this, too.
“If they bother us, I’ll banish them, gods help me, I will,” Tony muttered, earning a low chuckle from Steve. Steve closed his eyes, feeling warm and heavy-limbed.  He could hear the sound of Tony’s breathing, the rush of the water over the rocks, the sounds of the forest…there is death and sorrow here, Steve thought, but there is life and laughter, too.  We brought it with us.  That is what Tony had been trying to show him, he realized.  He would always carry something of this place with him, something of that other place with him, too, but it was up to him  how much, and for too long, he had given it more space than it was due.
“You throw them. Well,
“Yeah…yeah…that’s…this is where the idea came from,” Tony replied.
“We have that,” Steve said, giving Tony a look out of the corner of his eye.
Steve made a strangled sound in his throat as Tony reached back and cupped the globes of his ass, kneading the soft flesh and pulling him apart just enough so that he felt the tug at his hole, the cold burn of air, the jolt of being exposed, before releasing him and settling his hands on Steve’s waist again.  The pads of Tony’s thumbs were rubbing circles into Steve’s skin on each side of his stomach.  Steve’s cock twitched and rose, pressing against the fabric of the drape, lifting it, like some kind of strange show, revealing him a little at a time.
There was a small wooden table and curved, high-back chair off to one side. On the table sat a variety of tubes of lube, a silicone plug, an assortment of dildos, bottles of water, Powerbars, a thick, wooden paddle, which gave Steve a start of surprise, and an unopened box of baby wipes, along with a small, electronic box with a red button on it that Steve assumed was the intercom the man at the desk had mentioned. A wastebasket stood on the floor next to the table.
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve nodded and turned to head for his room.   “Any other words of wisdom?” he asked, stopping to look back at them.
“Professor Thorne said he’d like to maybe email me.  Send me some stuff.  Like, just to look over.  Kind of a collaboration thing,” Tony said quickly.  “If that’s okay with you, that is.”
That got him wondering, too. What would it be like to tease Steve like that, joke with him, make him laugh, the real kind that made Tony’s insides go liquid.  What would it feel like to be the one who could do that for Steve?
, Peggy.   My son, thinking about Steve like that.  The one good thing I ever did, and he can’t help but—but try to defile it.  To ruin something he knows is important to me.  Of course, he can’t.  It’s always been that way with him.  Always.  God—I-I saw red, Peg. Can you blame me?”
Steve stopped his motions where he had been pulling various cartons and containers out of the paper bag and looked over at Tony.  “You already talked to him, didn’t you?”
“Then I broke up with you, and you didn’t have to,” Tony filled in for him.  “Is that,” he broke off, blinking hard and biting his lip as he tried to swallow past the lump in his throat. “Is that why you didn’t argue? Didn’t try to…”
“Tempting, but that didn’t work so well when Rhodey tried.  Think I have to do this myself, but thanks, Pep.  You’re the best,” Tony acknowledged.  “Pepper says hi, and you’re wrong about me, by the way,” he told Steve.
“Tony, you can’t---he’s…” Rhodes started.
Steve was a good man.  Kind.  He had been good to Tony.  Tony, of course, having little experience with that, had turned kindness and attention into a grand, romantic fantasy.  He could see it now.  Clarity might have come a bit late, but when it finally came, skulking in the back of his brain, it opened its suitcase and set up shop, offering a carpetbag full of recrimination and loathing that kept pouring out, Mary Poppins-style.
The doorman opened one of the doors as they approached, and they walked into the suite.  To Tony’s relief, it was less pink floral vomit and more salon waiting room.  There were long couches and comfortable looking chairs with down pillows, tables with snacks and magazines, and a flat-screen on one of the walls that was showing a closed circuit of the ballroom, with a second, smaller screen embedded in the corner giving a celebrity news report.  He scanned the footage long enough to find Steve’s broad shoulders still next to David’s chair, though a woman, obviously a nurse, was bending over David and fitting a clear, plastic tube into his nose to give him oxygen.
“I take it you heard from her again,” Steve guessed, a smile forming.  Seemingly at each of their stops along the way from Highcastle, there had been a letter from Ms. Potts waiting for Tony, admonishing him in increasingly strident tones that he needed to send her instructions and respond to several letters from various nobles and others who required Tony’s attention.
“Even if you could’ve gotten an audience, which you wouldn’t have, I wouldn’t have listened. Tried to get you into bed, sure, but actually listened?” Tony said dismissively.
“I want you to think about it,” Tony said, voice pitched low, but there was an air of teasing underneath it that made Steve feel that Tony could see into his head and knew his thoughts, even the ones he didn’t want to think.  “How I’m fucking you on your own cum.   How I’ll fill you up with mine, and when it leaks out of you, it will be both of ours.”
“Director, can you unlock the doors to my quarters?” Steve asked, which was stupid because Steve needed to stay where he was, which was not nearly far enough away from Camp, but it would have to do until he could get him to the island, but Steve was very brave, so there was that.
“Mmmmm,” Steve hummed.  He thought the answer was yes.  Was supposed to be yes.  Yes seemed far away, though, out of reach somehow.  He could see it, right there in his mind, but his arms were too heavy to reach for it.
“That night. I shouldn’t have. I was…I was compromised, and I let it affect my judgment,” Tony admitted. “About a lot of things. I never should have sent you from me, and certainly not like that. I was trying—I thought—“ he sighed, wet and throaty with what he was holding back. ““I’ve brought you only pain. You can’t deny that. I would spend my life making it up to you, if you would but let me.”
“That’s…” Tony started, caught somewhere between a confused frown and a smart-ass remark, because, yeah, that was about par for the course.  “She put the whammy on you,” he laughed, slapping a hand against his thigh, unable to keep the grin off his face, half from Pepper’s situation and half from snatches of conversations long faded into memory.
“Do you…” he started.
Steve could feel the pressure, the burn, the tight heat surrounding his cock, all pounding together in a wave of need that was spiraling to some precipice that was just out of reach.  He found Tony’s cock with his slickened hand and stroked it, using his thumb to work the head and circle the slit. He twisted his wrist, adding pressure on each downstroke, watching Tony’s throat work as he did.
He had missed Tony, though. There was that. Whatever else there was, there was that.
“They taste better because they once knew freedom, so it doesn’t have that guilty aftertaste,” Stark supplied without looking up from his phone.
“He says...he says he will carry his things,” Yinsen finally admitted with a sigh. “And to stop calling him that.”
“It has been too long, Your Highness,” Lord Rand announced.  “Daniel was barely away from the wetnurse last time you visited.”
“Your fellow soldiers. From when you were captured.  I could have them located.  I’m not saying it would be easy, but…it is possible.  They could be brought here, even, if it would please you.  Places could be made for them to serve, and your mind would be at ease, then, I think,” Tony said.  “You will write down their names and descriptions and the details of your capture.  If they can be found, we will find them, and I’ll arrange for their purchase,” Tony told him with a firm nod, as if the matter was settled.  Steve stared at him, all the words taken from his mind as if his head had been tipped over and the words spilled out into a useless jumble.
,” Steve said. “I’m working on it, but I’m not going to lie, it’s probably always going to be an issue I’ll have to deal with, Tony.  So, if we’re doing this, you should know that about me.”
I just think it's unsettling.  You know, like how Rex is. ...which eye do you look at, anyway?"
He leaned in to nuzzle Steve's hair, to nose behind his ears.  Tony had always found the skin behind Steve's ears appealing and wasn't sure why; ever since Gleason had told him there were scent glands there, Tony knew why he was drawn to that area.  It gave him a sense of comfort and arousal at the same time.
, thought Tony deliriously.
"...Aria was smoking in here.  You know I don't like the smell of cigarettes."
"An omega that doesn't listen.  ...like I said.  ...a freak," said Justin softly.
Steve stared down at the case. It was covered in blood.
"Eat. Drink. Hang out," Hal shrugged. "Around midnight we usually crash whatever the Alphas are doing. It's kind of a tradition."
"Yeah, how else would you spell it?"
And then he sighed again.
"...hey Eric."
"Afternoon, everyone.  I'm Richard, and this is the Biology of Successful Mating, and, no, I did
Malick cleared his throat loudly.  "Considering they are bonded, I don't believe we can rely solely on Rogers's word not to--"
Tony listened, interested, captivated, taking the mug from Steve and sipping the coffee gratefully.  "Wow, Rogers.  That's... real... I dunno.  Brave, I guess.  And cheesy.  But brave."  Tony looked up contemplatively.  "Dad never mentioned you were an omega.  But he never said you were an Alpha, either.  Dad never really said what anyone was.  In his own way, I guess, he... he did care about, you know, civil rights.  He was progressive, for a guy born in nineteen-seventeen.  Maybe he didn't want anyone to assume, you know?  Either way."  Tony shrugged one shoulder.  "Rogers, listen.  Don't tell anyone I can be serious but, seriously?  I, uh... I respect you a lot.  As an omega.  And a friend."
"T-Tony."
Donner gripped his hand tight. So tight it almost hurt. "T-Thank you."
insecure?  Tony had been reassuring him for weeks that he was okay with Steve being double-bonded and that it wasn't his fault, and now he was going to go crazy over a little crush?
In the main cabin, Tony, like Steve, was overwhelmed with exhausted.  He didn't even finish his drink.  Tony passed out in the chair he was in and woke up to a slightly bumpy landing.
"Lets go get cocktails!" Maria squealed and darted off towards the bar. Apparently they were allowed to drink more with food.
, Donner, we'll get you your fucking taco!" snapped Tony, who was short-tempered.
"Maybe...maybe you could bite my shoulder, or something?" he suggested tentatively. Steve wanted Tony's teeth to leave a mark.
that won't work!"  Pietro's metabolism was such that most medications didn't.  Or at least, if they did, his body processed them so quickly that they had no lasting effect.  Pietro looked away glumly, knowing that Wanda was right.
support."
He politely excused himself from the room he was in, scooting past several people's knees, and made his way back toward the hospitality suite.  He felt thoroughly sick from watching a presentation about "reassignment" and he needed a fucking break.
Steve left Stephanie giggling on the sofa and turned to make his way toward the DJ.  He'd simply announce that the party was over and then let Rhodey handle Tony's ire at cutting the party short.
Then finally Steve's eyes landed on Karpov's face, red and watery with the snow.
Banksy laughed and it was an almost sad sound. "Well, I certainly wouldn't be here."
"Wh--what's that?"
Bucky switched channels.  On the news, a man in a red tie and a woman in a blue dress were talking, with a picture of a blond in the corner of the screen.  Bucky perked up excitedly. "My omega's on television!" he reported loudly.
"Did you get Avicii?"
Tony rolled his eyes.  “Pepper’s always acting like I’m on death’s door.  Do I look sick to you, Stan?  Give me a break.  I don’t need sleep.”  He looked out the window of the plane, wishing he were out there, flying alongside it.  “...kinda seems like a waste to me, honestly.  Sleep, I mean.  We spend, what, a third of our lives unconscious?  I’d rather be awake.  Living my life.  Instead of wasting it.”
Tony smiled slightly.  He had weird nicknames for nearly all of his old war buddies, and some of them Tony was familiar with, because his father had mentioned them occasionally, in passing.
"I, er, really don't think that's a good idea..."
From the other side of the door, Tony heard a crack and a thump.  "
"Wait, I thought you were a part of the Winter Soldier program?" asked one.
Steve's panic was coursing through his veins and he found himself struggling to maintain his cool; it took deliberate effort not to talk too fast or pet too hard.
Steve was wet and shiny between his thighs again, his dick half-hard against his thigh. But he made no move to touch himself just yet. He was quite happy just to observe Tony all blissed out on the bed in that moment. He also looked tired and Steve knew that everything had to be sore at this point. Not that it wasn't for Steve too, but the serum certainly helped him.
Tony felt it was thoroughly hypocritical of Steve to run off with his
"...you understand that the only way he's gonna say anything, though, is if I talk to him... y'know."  Tony looked down at his coffee. DeSoto really had made some
"But you're right. We need to find out. I don't even know why, or understand how there's a 'market' for taken omegas. From everything I've seen so far... it doesn't make sense. Our 'to-do-list' is getting longer every minute we stay here. And we came here to find out everything we could, didn't we?  So... go get him," Steve said, and gently punched Tony's arm, even though he very much wanted this to be over and done with already.
"Heats can easily make you depressed Steve. And anxious. The heat is messing with your head. I know the real Steve who can't wait to kick more HYDRA ass."
"Right," Phil said gently and stepped forward. They obviously weren't going to get anything solid out of Steve for a while. Now wasn't a time to delve into the reason he called HYDRA in the first place, which was a very concerning thing in the first place. "Steve. We're going to need to do a rape kit."
, it needs
"Anyway, I hope you have a good day Tony. I just thought you should know," Tiberius said, sounding a little tired.
"I'm very sorry you have to deal with that," Steve said, taking a seat at the breakfast whilst he watched the doctor mill around. He was wearing the apron that Phil had given him for his birthday. (
The orchids had mostly been moved upstairs to clear space on the ground floor.  Pepper was busily trying to direct an ice sculpture while yelling on her phone regarding private security.
going back to that cave. I would tear down the world before I let that happen." Steve squeezed his hands gently. "Now, Tony, I need you to breathe with me, ok?"
"Sometimes waiting is part of the process," Steve breathed. "And I'm so sorry." He grinned and leaned down, their noses just brushing. "You have my sincerest apologies, for 'ruining' you. But..." he ducked his head down, whispering in Tony's ear. "You certainly ruined
Peggy gave a tiny shrug.  "Steve meant so much to Howie.  He didn't talk much at all about him, did he?"
"Steve," he said, sternly.  "Please don't yell at DeSoto, he's being very good."  He patted DeSoto.
"Wait, what?"
with) than she did with the news about Tony's newest suit or whatever had dragged 'Stark' into the headlines.
"Ellis didn't call back so it couldn't have been that important," Steve assured him.
As Natasha parked the car efficiently, Steve glanced over at Tony and briefly down at his chest. "Do you want me to carry... I mean, do you want to lean on me?" he asked, tone completely genuine. If Tony was in pain he wanted to help.
The rooms were numbered.  Steve was poised in front of room number 1 like he was in the midst of a very suspenseful gameshow.
"Cut!" called Louis.
"Why are you doing this? If you think I’m HYDRA, why do this and not call SHIELD to rat me out?"
"Phil...it's six in the morning. I'm not really in the mood for you being cryptic right now.  Just tell me what you found."
His eyes snapped open but his hair had fallen in front of his face again.  He couldn't see what was happening and the sounds were too loud for him to really make anything out.  He let out a desperate growl.  He knew that omega.
"Hey, boys, Daddy's home!" he called.
Tony snarled, hackles quivering on the back of his neck.  "
"Steve," whispered Tony into the blond's ear.  "Make her get me whiskey. Please. I really need it."
"There's no rule against it," said Tony quickly.  "Alphas can wear necklaces, can't they? So what if mine just
Steve picked up the box with the prototype in it no problem. Nat and Clint managed the others--just barely. As the boxes were moved, something else fell out from the shelf that had been propped up by a stack. It was a long piece of board, Steve didn't pay much attention to it. He just moved to set the heaviest box down in the lift.
"They're literally selling you out to other Alphas! It's prostitution," Rhodey said with the same kind of bluntness that Steve admired. Donner practically flinched at the use of the word. "I'm not here to make you do anything. I'm here to offer you a way out. You just gotta trust me."
"ARMANDO!" shrieked Tony, his mood evaporating.  He darted off.
The touch at his neck felt natural now. It didn't repulse Steve like before. Before it had just made him feel cripplingly guilty and
"I don't think that's how drinking works," Steve told him bemusedly, sitting on the edge of the bed as he watched Tony getting ready. He watched the dip and rise of his shoulders as he buttoned his shirt up. He smiled when Tony ran a hand down his arm, Steve's gaze flickering up to his face. The shirt didn't exaggerate the muscle but it was hard for anything to hide it.  Steve's muscles would always be bigger than Tony's, the serum defying nature, giving him a physique that he, as an omega, would normally never be able to achieve.
Embarrassment was creeping up again.  Tony sipped his coffee and avoided Steve's gaze.  Tony's experience with omegas was so woefully inadequate; he didn't want to admit that to Steve.  But wasn't that, too, indicative of the problem?  Omegas weren't expected to run businesses, to get high-paying government jobs, to make a difference.  Tony mingled with betas and Alphas; as the CEO of a Fortune 500, he'd rarely had to speak to an omega, unless he was giving a drink order or directions to a night club.  The omegas he saw always tended to be assistants, secretaries, or paired to a high-ranking Alpha.  He'd never questioned it, but yes, even in the twenty-first century, it was true... omegas were treated as second-class citizens, and no one thought that was weird.  They were all so used to it...  Tony felt a pang of guilt.  He was sure he'd probably objectified omegas before without even thinking about it.
The phone he'd used earlier buzzed on the sofa arm.
," he replied, cocking an eyebrow.  He grabbed a passing omega with his unoccupied hand.  "Hey, can I get a martini.  Four martinis.  Get this guy some appetizers too, will ya?"
, like, everything you do is always about saving people and being this... courageous hero with a heart of gold... and speaking as a man with a heart of metal myself, it's very inspiring.  But, anywho, the thing is, I never stopped noticing your looks, either. I mean, you're basically perfect in the looks department. A ten out of ten. So, you know, I think about you a lot."  Tony paused. He hadn't actually asked Steve a thing during his speech but Steve was waiting patiently. Another thing about Steve: unlike Tony, he was capable of letting people get to their points, even when they took a while to get there.
past her without even looking.
"Why won't you just leave him the fuck
"Oh, yes.  I'm well aware of your history.  You were spoiled. Indulged by Howard Stark.  Obviously, his attitude toward omegas rubbed off on his son."

"No, she's a comedian.  Her show is called
Steve was barely moving. He'd shut his eyes. Seeing nothing was less distressing than seeing almost nothing.
"...maybe I should turn on the lights," offered Tony, running Steve's soft blond hair between his fingers.
His blue eyes flickered open and locked with Tony's. "You have to promise me that if it's not safe we get rid of it. Sometimes the price of progress is too great Tony," Steve whispered and squeezed his fingers gently.
"Infected briefly," he answered. "But now it's healing just fine, thank you."
"Call the police, there's a thief--"
Steve reached out to grab his hand, clutching it tightly. "Thank you," he whispered.
Steve wanted to cry when Tony wrapped his arms around him. "This...this is normal?" he sniffed and actually felt better at that. He hadn't talked about this with Gleason or Brennan. He hadn't realised that this would be a problem. Maybe that was stupid of him. Had it tasted bad for Bucky too...? Probably not. He'd been going into heat at the time, hadn't he? Maybe once he went through a heat with Tony they could sort all this out. Maybe...
"I wish I could say that was the first time I've ever heard him say that," muttered Pepper under her breath; Aria chuckled.
Then he stilled for a moment and looked up at Tony, wet eyes open to stare up at his Alpha. "Are you going to kill him?" He whispered. A beat of silence. "I want to watch."
"I'm sorry, sir, I already informed her," said JARVIS.
The soldier leaned forward to nose at the omega's fingertips.  The omega could pull away if he wanted to, he figured. If he told the soldier to leave, he would; he was tired, ready to go curl up on the end of Karpov's bed, since no bed had been provided to him.  But given him own choice (and he couldn't remember the last time he'd made a choice on his own), he would much rather stay here, sleep on the cold tiles under the bright lights, just to be close to the blond.
Steve didn't really understand what was happening. All he knew was that he was on the ground and his ass felt like it was on fire and Tony was swearing loudly in his ears. Steve flinched and then slowly began to make out a familiar voice.
Donner looked surprised.  He actually looked at Steve; his hand went up to his stomach.  "With a baby?" he asked.
"Weird but good," Steve said, moving to grab himself an apple off the countertop and then head upstairs so he could get dry. He put the phone on loud speaker and then chucked it on the bed before shimmying off his pants and going to grab a towel.
"...I think you scared him off," said Eric, unnecessarily.
Tony took some comfort in knowing, at least, that he was the brains of the operation.  Hopefully maybe something would need hacked into or something.
"...I think a lot of people were drinkers after the war," Steve said quietly, eyes dragging down to the real life model on the desk before them. He stepped around, peering at it. "It has a remarkable amount of detail, don't you think? Lasted well too."
“Tony…” Steve started, then let the word hang there between them.  “It wasn’t stupid.”
“I’ll take my chances,” Rhodey replied nonchalantly, checking his watch.  “Figure he should be home anytime now, if he works a regular shift.  Does he work a regular shift?”
Fun Fact: Dumonte, for which Dumi is short, means "man of the mountain".
“Yes?” Tony asked, teasing and still a little honeyed with sleep, taking his mouth off of Steve’s nipple with a wet, sucking pop.   “Something to say?”
“Eh, don’t worry about it.  I’ll handle it. You did fine. Better than fine,” Tony assured him.  “Pepper worries that I’ll say something that doesn’t fit the script, and, let’s face it, that’s not exactly outside of the realm of possibility.  Matt thinks I’m going to say something that’s going to sound bad when they repeat it back in court one day.  I get it.  They’re trying to protect me.  Protect what we’re trying to do here.  But, you want to say something?  I trust you.  Have at it.  You clearly have better instincts for it than I do,” Tony admitted with an indifferent shrug.  “The only reason I haven’t announced to the world what Obie’s up to is that I promised Pepper I wouldn’t put her through a protracted he said-he said, not when we can get him red-handed, anyway.”
Tony breathed out a hiss of air and pinched the bridge of his nose.  He was being an ass, he knew, but it was like he couldn’t help picking at this wound, over and over, in tiny, little tears of skin that didn’t seem like much until he looked down and saw that he was bleeding out.  He sank down to his knees on the blanket next to Steve and put his head on Steve’s shoulder, wrapping one arm around the broad expanse of Steve’s chest.
Steve shifted a bit, and Tony watched Tabbert go rigid as a corpse.  Try as he might, Tony couldn’t keep his gaze from dropping down, just for a second, and he had to clamp down on the inside of his cheek to keep from letting a horrified chuckle out.  The Dean had already given him permission to do the classwork with another professor as his mentor, which worked out great, because Tony was not going to be able to unsee the front of Professor Tabbert’s pants, and, really, it took something away from the learning environment when you knew your Professor wet himself.
“Wider,” the overseer said.  Steve shifted his legs further apart.  “Good.  Be still.”
One thing, Steve thought.  Just one thing.
“I said I’d go, didn’t I?” Barnes replied. “Just put the lists on the fridge, okay?”
“They’re on the desk,” Tony said, turning his head and nodding down at the large desk strewn with papers.
“You should eat more,” Tony said more seriously, nodding at the tray of fruits, breads and cheeses arranged around the colorful flowers that Steve recognized from Tony’s garden which sat along the edge of the bath.  “That poor, embarrassed servant who nearly tripped over her own skirts trying to bow and avert her eyes at the same time brought that all the way in here, just for you.”
“It’s a graduation robe. That’s the exact opposite of stupid,” Steve said as he came to stand behind Tony and wrap his arms around Tony’s stomach.  He dropped a kiss on the top of Tony’s head, then set the cap on top, with the tassel dangling off to one side against Tony’s cheek.   “You look…amazing.  I’m so proud of you, Tony.  I know how that sounds.  I don’t mean it to be patronizing or, I don’t know—this is your accomplishment, but…”
Two, brighter together, so bright and so close, you couldn’t tell them apart.
“You built him,” Steve replied.  “He’ll work.”  Tony found himself unable to quite look away, and suddenly conscious of the dog tags laying under his shirt, warm against his chest.  He opened his mouth, to say what, he wasn’t sure.
“Well, he’s very polite, have you not noticed?  Keep to your lessons like a good boy, how about?” Tony said.  “We’ll make a scribe of you yet.”
Getting out of bed had been his first mistake.
Tony was still smiling as he turned onto the cabin’s long driveway, thinking about the looks on the Alphas faces when he and Steve walked across the lobby with Steve’s arm wrapped around him and the other carrying a large leather satchel with a suspiciously round object inside it while Steve glowered at them.  They hadn’t really spoken much on the drive back, other than Steve’s not-too-subtle look at the speedometer.
Steve nodded.  He thought about the strap, the way it had whipped through the air and snapped against his skin.  It had hurt, yes, but when he thought of it, it wasn’t quite with remembered pain, not the way he remembered getting his nose broken when he called Finn Braugher for a liar and a thief after he stole Mrs. Traegher’s silver spoon, the one her Da brought over from the Green Isles, sewn into his coat pocket in case he needed to make an offering to the Sea Queen should the voyage become treacherous.
So there they were, minutes later, Tony snapping the faceplate down and Steve in his uniform hoisting the shield.  Tony thought he was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen.  That could be the hormones, but objectively, it might actually be true. “Ready?” Tony asked through the helmet.
“You are. We are.  We’re Avengers, remember?”  Tony countered.  “That’s what we’re supposed to be doing.  Fighting the battles that others can’t?  This SHIELD stuff, hell, it’s the very definition of battles that other people are handling just fine.  They don’t need Captain America for that terrorist bullshit.  They’ve been chasing that particular cheese since--“  Well, hell, he’d walked right into that one.
Ah, Steve.
“He’s in,” Brock answered for Steve, glancing his way.  “Right?”
“I’m not saying you’re lying, but you have to understand that pretty much no one on the face of the Earth finds my money the least interesting thing about me.  In fact, pretty much the only two people who do just left the room, so there’s that,” Tony replied flatly. “But, okay, then. Then, yeah. If you’re sure you don’t just want to keep it simple.  Not that you can’t change your mind, but, I mean, for now, if you’re sure, then…then, I’m—I’m interested,” Tony stammered, swallowing hard enough for Steve to hear the click of his throat.
“Sorry,” Steve replied, winding his way through the hallway and dodging a bellboy who stepped out with a cart of luggage.
“No one would judge you,” Tony agreed, then canted his head to the side, and slid his arms down over Steve’s biceps and back up over his shoulders and around his neck again, looking almost absently at something beyond Steve’s shoulder.  “I’d almost forgotten what it was like to laugh with someone like this,” he added, then seemed to come back to himself, his eyes focusing, and a tight smile aimed up at Steve. “Sorry. Ignore me. I talk too much.”
“The neural interface will give you a whole range of obscene gesture options—dare I say it?  At your fingertips,” Tony told him. Barnes grinned.
“Can’t Help Falling In Love With You,” Ms. Potts replied, forehead crinkling with a frown as Steve slid past her into the elevator.
“You pay him, Tony,” Steve reminded him, unable to keep the smile off his face at the praise, “but thank you.  You’re quite the artist, too, you know? Your designs...they aren’t just useful, there’s beauty there.”
“I wish you could stay,” Steve said, reaching for one of Tony’s hands and bringing it to his cheek.
“Bye, J,” Tony said, raising one hand with a slight wave as Jarvis pulled the door shut behind him.  A moment later, he heard the car engine start and the telltale sound of tires on gravel that marked Jarvis’s departure.
Hiraeth is a Welsh word that has no direct English translation. It is a mix of longing, yearning, nostalgia, wistfulness, or an earnest desire for a home to which you cannot return, a home which maybe never was.
Steve lifted his head to look at Tony, a desperately bright pang of hope blooming in his chest, almost painfully sharp. “And if I fail?” he couldn’t help but ask, because that was the dark pit that waited, the one that would take everything from him. He had seen it before, in ash and smoke and salt sea air.
“Okay, then. So, will you please get out of there and leave this Captain alone, so Fury will get off my back?  He’s threatening to have you forcibly removed, by the way,” Pepper informed him.
“What? What is it that you want, Steve?” Tony asked, slow and barbed with too much knowledge of what, exactly, Steve
...Steve knew that meant this was about Bucky.
He and Tony were still holding hands, their fingers threaded together.
say that again."
Steve sighed fondly and kissed Tony's cheek, the least sore looking one. "Well, I certainly wouldn't kneel for Pitbull. God...what a stupid name, okay? So maybe you didn't get to finish the fight. Maybe I don't know anything about being dominant. But I certainly wouldn't be submissive for him." Steve made sure to meet his gaze. "Only you."
"Good choice," she smiled, still looking a little dazed at both of them. "I'll back in a moment with your drinks."
"Are you going to come to bed?" Steve asked, and then added, "To sleep. I mean... it's been a long week," he whispered, gaze drifting off to the ceiling.  "There was a point when I thought I would never make it back here again." Steve sighed and closed his eyes. "I forgot how awesome memory foam is."
, and I was a kid!  Just because I was an Alpha."
to do this anymore. I didn't ask to be a super-soldier. I just wanted to make a difference in the war! And I did.  We won.  It's over, isn't it? I goddamn died for all you people and you act like I owe you something. Yes. I screwed up. Royally. Sure, you can lord it over me forever, or accept the fact that I 'm an actual human, not just some mascot, and I make mistakes!"
Steve cocked his head. How did having your feet behind your head increase the chance of getting pregnant? Surely it just meant your Alpha could slide--
"Get in," Natasha gestured to the chair. "And I'll start hooking you up."

"We can do this the hard way or the easy way, Rogers."
He broke their kiss and lay back down, being careful not to press the arc reactor too hard into Steve's chest, resting his chin on Steve's shoulder.  "This is okay," he whispered, half to himself.  "We're okay... this is fine... this is normal... we're good, right, Steve?  This is okay?  You're okay?"
Donner ducked his head shyly, a hand still on his stomach.  He had a nervous smile.
you. They eased me back into this world, I'm probably the closest they'll ever come to feeling like parents. They won't leave you alone. They'll threaten to kill you in fifty different ways, demand to know what your intentions are...all that shit. And I...I don't want you getting scared off," Steve admitted quietly. "I want us to work out what this is. What we want. What we just...did. Jesus Christ, Tony, I can feel how you're feeling and I know you want to leave, but don't. Please." Another step. "You can go home tonight, that's fine...I get you need to get shit done. But you promised me Italian." His Brooklyn accent crept back into his tone. "And it ain't polite to leave a guy hangin'."
"We waited over an hour," pointed out Charlie.
"Okay, guys, come on, if we miss Banksy and Boswell--" warned Aria.
He tried to meet his gaze but it felt like he was staring out of a window, not into one.
"Oh shit, it worked!"
"You might feel a little sick, or queasy. The heat might not stop entirely. Sometimes it can just be delayed another day or so. The body is a funny thing. Hard to predict. Especially yours.  No offense, Captain."
ever shoot us, not really.  He and Tricky were always fighting, all the time, and he made all sorts of threats.  I think he was just a little drunk and trying to scare Trickshot into behaving-- also, Tricky got so mad whenever he drank.  Tricky's father wasn't an omega, but he and his brother were, and his father used to drink and hit them and I think that's why Tricky was so messed up in the first place.  His father once hit his brother so hard he made him go deaf, that's why he knew sign language. Anyways, Tricky just laughed and said, 'Oh, really? You're gonna shoot me? You think it's worth going to jail for a spade like me?  Do it. I dare you. Shoot me.' And Alpha..."
"Showcasing the latest innovations, we here at Stark Industries pride ourselves on looking forward, improving the world for a better tomorrow.  I believe, that everything is achievable through technology. Better living, robust health, and, yes, even world peace."
"Not now, Steve!  I'm on the verge of a breakthrough!  I'm telling you, I got this!" said Tony, trembling with excitement.  "...just think, just imagine, if I could summon a suit like Sailor Moon-style, have that shit clamp right onto me, get it at any time."  He paused suddenly, mood shifting abruptly. "If he ever comes back for you, I'll be able to kill him."
, it's kinda interesting that now he suddenly isn't liking the idea of sharing-" Natasha cleared her throat. "Anyway. Let's not go there."
"You know you're gorgeous, right?" he said quietly.  He played with some of the bubbles floating on the surface.  "I know what you're thinking.
He slid a finger along the curve of Steve's ear, feeling the soft, downy blond fuzz on the pinna.
"As long as it's not classified," amended Maria.
Phil looked up.  "Like teenagers."
Steve exhaled shakily. "Please don't hate me, Tony."
kill Tony, if he had to.  If Tony ever came anywhere near his omega again, he would tear him to pieces.
"Well, if you want to go to the AU conference, you don't have a choice," said Pepper.  She reached out to tap the stack of papers with her nail. "Start signing."
later."
He turned his head once he felt Steve relax under him and turned his head to spit.
Their lips brushed.
"But that's not a place.  It's nothing," said Natasha.
"2005, maybe?" suggested Abby.
the one who went into heat!  I'm not apologizing to an omeg--" began Tony.  Pepper shot him a withering glare and Tony dropped it.  He felt defensive; who the hell was she to lecture him?  She had no idea how it felt, what it was like.  But as much as Tony wanted to argue, he couldn't.  Because he cared about Pepper.  Possibly loved her.  And she'd just seen him at an all-time low.  He was going to have to tread lightly, at least for a couple of days, until she stopped being annoyed at him.
is why people need Christmas.  To take a break from all this. You should take one, too, while the boys go up to the lodge.  You've been juggling a lot for Steve. It'll wear you down, burn you out. I learned that with Tony.  Sometimes you just have to let go of the wheel for a while, take a leap of faith... hope that they make the right decision."
"I'm bonded, JARVIS.  I'm a new man," said Tony.
"Sorry Nat, say that again?"
They were whispering about him,
Taylor had been on his chat show before and immediately propelled herself at their fellow omega, pulling him into a tight hug. The two kissed each other on either cheek.  Steve spotted Aria and Mac giggling on the sofa, and then Tony drinking whiskey like it was water. He sighed fondly.
"Of course," Gene nodded, dashing smile and all. And then Piper giggled, as if on cue, and kissed Eric's cheek.
Over the next week, Tony's train of thought was more disjointed than usual, with lots of off-handed mentions of his parents.  Clearly, it was weighing on his mind. However, Tony wasn't someone who was forthcoming about things that bothered him. Case in point: he hadn't told a soul when his arc reactor was failing.  He had hid that he was dying, so it wasn't at all surprising that he also refused to talk about how he was feeling. According to Pepper, he was one of the most emotionally constipated people she'd ever met.
The two of them both stepped back with an embarrassed smile, but it was too late; Christine was watching them with unconcealed journalistic delight.
"Fuck," he said out loud.
a disappointment-- oh, tell Boz what you told me, he'll be flattered-- Boswell!  Donner had something to say to you!" He gave Donner a little poke.
Tony looked over at Pepper in alarm, even though Happy was already dragging him toward the house.
Steve felt a tug in his gut and he looked up at the ceiling. Aria tugged on his hand. "Come on! Steve! Get up on stage… let’s go!"
Aria snorted. "Right. Sure. Makes sense."
He looked over Tony's face for a moment. The beard really did make him look older. Steve always forgot he was forty.
The crowd's attention went from the blocked exit to him; he was almost instantly nearly drowning in frantic people clutching at him.
Tony's brain was already compartmentalizing everything.  He wasn't thinking about anything but the next five or ten minutes.  Cram Steve into a tuxedo, and they could get back in there and he could have another drink.  That was as far as his brain was operating.  Objective: get Steve to his dinner.  Reward: a drink.  Two drinks.  Ten drinks.  It was open bar and Tony had never needed a drink more in his life.
"I cannot wait for that generation to be behind us," commented Irshad as the Alphas strolled away. Steve hummed dryly.
rocket science.  He did not understand his omega.  He thought he had, but clearly he didn't.  He was bonded to a fucking stranger whose actions were unpredictable and capricious.
Tony had barely reached the bar and begun mixing himself a drink when he heard the crash and several exclamations of surprise.  Steve had hurled his mug across the room and it had shattered; Mackenzie's hand was on his hip holster, ready to draw.
"Fuck." Aria leaned against a countertop and took a long drag. "Look, Virginia... I know Tony is having his crisis or whatever but we both know he stands a better chance at finding Steve than anyone else does. We need to know if this is just Steve getting better at hiding or if something has happened to him. I just have a really bad feeling and I'm willing to bet everything that Tony knows something is wrong. So tell him to get his ass in gear.  We need to know Steve is safe. And his... apparently his sketchbook... oh my God..."
"For once Captain, stop fighting.  Just relax. I can see and smell how much you like this.  This is what your kind was designed for, you know. Without the serum, you're nothing but another omega, one designed to please an Alpha.  And right now, I'm the only Alpha in the room.
"Yeah, thanks," said Tony, and bent over it to vomit.
His face broke into a grin.  "The war's over? ...oh, boy, really?  It's over? We won?"
He watched Tony's face fall at Gleason's admission and Steve's own heart sank.
Gleason rose.  "You have my number, Captain, if you need anything at all.  Jeff's having twins so I might not be able to answer right away, but I'll do my best to be accessible.  ...just remembered, heats are temporarily. You'll both feel a lot more level-headed by the end of the week.  Merry Christmas."
. He wanted to get rid of it. Steve wished they could cut it out, or something.
Tony had made sure that the collar wasn't cold and Steve was eternally grateful for that. The inside was a soft, dark blue suede that sat comfortably against his skin. He only hoped he didn't get sweaty from nerves; then would it kind of gross.
"I--" Donner paused, like he wasn't used to asking for things. "I want a hug."
"You're obviously fine, and still a selfish pig," said Natasha dismissively.  She reached over and placed a hand over Steve's, and lowered her voice. "We have some new intel and we're going to another base later in the month.  We're going to find him and fix this, Steve."
"Well, I can't name an
Steve rolled onto his front, his legs curling up as he turned his head to peek at Tony from under his bicep as he lazily ran his fingers through his own hair. He watched the way Tony's eyes ran down his form and shivered. "I'll call her after a shower," he murmured, words a little muffled by his arm. His blue eyes were glazed over. Steve looked serene, peaceful.
They were both getting ready and in five minutes they'd be driving to the nearest SHIELD building, in Brentwood, right across from the Los Angeles VA.  Despite being mostly excited, Steve was a little nervous. He knew he couldn't piss Gideon off but it was just hard... because he really wanted to.
Steve's arms were powerful and Tony snuggled into his chest, feeling small.
Tony whistled as he helped himself to Pepper's coffee.
Clint realized he was breathing heavily into the phone and hadn't heard what Steve had said.  "Is he alive?" he repeated, firmer. "Is he... is he... okay? Where are you? Are you sure?"
The second he was out the door Keisha was on him. "Captain, please get in the chair, we only have five minutes." She ushered him way, shooting Banksy an annoyed but fond look.
The jet was huge and shiny and sleek.  It loomed over the car as they drove up to it, a flight of stairs waiting for them to walk in, the door already open.  Happy opened Tony's car door for him (his hands were full of noodles, after all). Steve got out of his own side himself, eyes trailing over the jet. He exhaled slowly. He hoped it wouldn't be a long journey. He was nervous; this was a big day. Coming out day. How would be best to do this? He had no idea...and he doubted Clint and Phil wouldn't either. Tony made it sound simple, them getting up on a stage, but then what...what would Steve actually say?
Donner frowned.  "Why did you lie to her?"
"...cute assistant, by the way."
He glanced up through the hole in the wall and saw Natasha watching Tony with a curious expression on her face. Steve glanced over to catch the alpha looking at him who then quickly looked away. Steve almost felt his cheeks heat up and then he was thinking about the kiss- how hot and wet Tony's tongue felt in his mouth. Fuck. He'd liked that. It had been totally out of line but...maybe Steve had liked that a little too.
Tony paced around the equipment, frowning.  "Kicker looks good... junctions are tight... radio-frequency source is live... I need an argon tank here... Steve, get me... there's a teal tank over that way, roll it over, I gotta hook that up... if I can just get my drift tubes straight we can turn this bad boy on..."  He adjusted the level and his frown deepened.  "I need something under here, just a few inches of lift... hmm... CLINT, WHERE IS MY ESPRESSO?"
Hawley's face flickered with a suppressed smile.  "Captain Rogers is an American treasure. We've had a lot of people lobbying on his behalf."  Her eyes flicked over to Fury, whose face was unreadable.
"It's not therapy.  Just a little support group."
"So far, it's been about twice a year, so yeah," replied Tony truthfully.  "Rogers, c'mon, give me a
"Welcome back, sir," said JARVIS automatically, flicking on the lights for him.
He nearly collided with Dr. Gleason on his way out.
He settled back down next to Steve, slipping the dogtags around his neck and pulled Steve's shaking hands into his.  "You don't have frostbite. Look around, Steve, look, there's an orchid, they're tropical. You've got all these blankets, see?  You're warm and cozy. Take these off, I'll keep you warm." He tugged at Steve's waistband again.
gonna do about it?"
.  You have each other, so... Do you want a life and relationship that revolves around your
Aria took a long, contemplative drag, then pointed the cigarette at Steve.  "Malick won't be there alone. There will be at least two or three other members of the World Security Council.  So he shouldn't be able to say or do anything. Best to just ignore him, Steve. After that conference, he'll probably try to get under your skin, but with the others there, he'll have to at least pretend to be nice.  My advice to you is to do the same." She looked back down at her tablet. "I'm sending you a few possible venues for that charity dinner you want to have in June. We need a place big enough to accommodate all the orchids so people can bid on them.  I recommend a silent auction. ...have you and Tony discussed anniversary plans at all yet?"
The other mark was still there.  Tony's slightly overlapped.
"Aren't you that famous figure-skater?" asked the girl on the counter.
She almost smiled. "My name is Haley. My friends call me Hal."
He leaned forward to kiss Tony once he was clean, smiling against his lips. "Italian," he hummed in soft agreement. Steve stole another kiss, slower and deeper this time as he licked into Tony's mouth. Then they were parting for air, breathless and pink.
"I mean, they don't have to be designer, right?" Steve asked, after meeting Tony's gaze.
This was the sort of sex Tony used to have in the nineties, when he and his partner (or partners) were high on coke and had been partying all night and still wanted more.  This was the kind of sex Tony was famous for. The kind he hadn't had much of, not since Afghanistan.
.  Steve was Tony's and Tony's alone; Bucky had been dead for seventy years; Steve wasn't too small or sick or frail to be mated and Tony was wasting precious time by even thinking about Bucky when he should have been balls-deep in Steve like an hour ago.
called me here, I don't want him, he's yours, I submit!"  Sam didn't dare lift his eyes. "I'm here to help, okay? I'm not going to touch him, I promise, he's all yours."
No.  He'd knelt.  That went beyond "being nice."  Steve had knelt and pressed his face into Tony's leg, and Tony had stroked his hair.... and then fucking Coulson had ruined it.
?  I never get any privacy anymore!  You, Pepper, Rhodey, the whole Fury entourage... every time I come up here, there's always someone here!  I liked living alone better-- I mean, living alone with Steve, obviously. I want Steve here," Tony added hastily.
"Bucky... Bucky, you need to stay over there," Steve managed to there. "You need to stay here and I need to stay here, okay?"
"Hey, how come SHIELD didn't give me a grappling hook?" asked Steve softly.
"I lost my arm," reported Bucky.
"Sure.  What better way to spend Friday night than to scramble my subconscious using questionably legal government drugs and equipment?" said Tony glibly.
"This is
expo."
The clocked passed midnight.  Banksy, Mackenzie, and George had begun a friendly game of poker.
"Well... I grew up like this," said Tony.  "TV interviews, red carpets, paparazzi... this is old news.  And let's be real, Steve.  Any Alpha would be cool with anything after mating you.  I don't know how it feels for you, on your end, as an omega, but... you have no idea, Steve.  I want to give you everything.  I want to be close to you, all the time, and protect you from everything, and... it's just incredible.  I want to spoil you."  Actually, Tony could kind of understand an Alpha's trepidation of an omega going out and working and having a social life outside of the bond.  The thought of Steve existing without Tony there was unsettling.
"Oh, I'm a people person. I work in people. You know how it goes."
"...I didn't think you and him would ever show up for a conference like this.  Oh! This is Shimmer, my omega."
Tony squeezed his hand.  "I'm happy," he concluded.
"Thanks.  Brawn and brains together, huh?  I'm the brawn, obviously."
Steve and Tony were given a whole tent to themselves. It wasn't much admittedly, but it was something. There was a small bed very low to the ground in the center and the walls and roof were only just high enough that Steve didn't have to duck his head down. During the night they both fell out of bed a few times because they weren't used to such a small cot. But Steve thought it was pretty cute when he woke up to see a grumpy looking Tony staring at him from the floor with awful bed hair at 1am.
Then the lift doors opened and they stepped out, heading towards set a double doors and--
Steve tried to stand up; Gleason pushed him back down. "Steve, try to stay still, please--"
Steve was only semi-aware of his surroundings. All he was really focused on was Tony, and Tony being inside of him. Every moment he could he got on top of Tony or coaxed the Alpha between his legs. He ate a few pieces of food via Tiberius's instruction but really, he was only interested in one thing.
"Hey, don't knock scientists," said Tony.  "I'm a scientist. We can be pretty badass, you know."
"...I would risk it, too, if it meant bears listened to me."
Pepper smiled, her nose crinkling.  "...that actually sounds... fun."
He shivered a little as Tony's thumb traced over raised skin. "Will you be there too?"
"At least Steve's not here to tease me," said Tony.
"I think it's better to regret doing something than not," Steve offered quietly. He wasn't really sure why Tony had come out here to talk to him. He hadn't thought the man would spare him a second thought at his own party. Tony was supposed to be having fun. And even Steve could admit he wasn't the funnest person around. Especially in this century.
And with that, Steve left.  He didn’t want to continue the conversation any further.  He knew he was being baited, and he was not going to let Tony get away with it.
want?  I thought you were over the Avengers now.  You can't go out with them.  Go out with
"Great.  So, Steve's birthday is coming up and I wanna do something awesome for him."
her?  Who the hell is she?" he demanded.  He ignored Phil and the other man.  They weren't Alphas.  She was.  What's more, Tony could tell, in an instant, that she was the most powerful Alpha in the immediate vicinity.  He didn't like the way she was eyeballing Steve, the way they were chatting like old pals.  He could already tell she was powerful; she oozed a deadly, confident power.  But Tony was just stupid and hungover enough to challenge her if he had to.  Why not?  He was going to be dead soon, anyway.
"Open it," ordered the blond.
"Suitability," said Tony with a small snort.  Steve ignored him and kept talking.
Which could still no doubt be brutal.
"Yes, sir," said the boy-- Peter-- quickly, turning toward a light that was taller than he was.
Yes, he remembered, vaguely, someone being angry with him, furious.  In a field of tulips in France.
"It'll be fine.  He didn't hit anything important and I heal really fast," said Pietro.  "Thanks for asking. Here, have some gum."
Stiffly, Tony climbed to his feet. "Can I set you down, Steve?"
Not all of the memories Tony had experiences, though, were his or Barnes's.  There were other memories.  Memories of being in a too-bright lab where everyone spoke Russian.
Well, whatever.  Things were how they were.  No use moping over it. Tony was just going to have to come to terms with it and power through.  Bonds were permanent, after all. Sort of. Tony could distance them, if he wanted. He'd never loved anyone quite like he liked Steve, but if Steve told him to, he would.  Right now, he wasn't really sure
were always his top priority.
"So, I got you something," he said, unnecessarily.  "Uh... I don't know if you'll like it. But I... y'know... got you something."  He looked embarrassed as Steve picked it up to open it. "...it's, uh, you know... bands," explained Tony.  "Matching bands, y'know... betas wear bands and... I guess it's trendy, pair-bonds getting bands, too, so... uh... I got two, y'know.  If you wanted to wear it and... have me wear it, too. Y'know. 'Cause we're bonded." Tony was terrible at being overly sappy. He took a sip of his champagne, obviously uncomfortable.  He wasn't sure if Steve would like the idea or not, but Pepper had suggested it. Pair-bonds didn't really need to wear bands to indicate they were paired; anyone who was statused could smell it.  But at least for betas, wedding bands were the only way to determine if they were bonded, and Tony thought it was a nice gesture. Something possessive, but also equal, and certainly a hell of a lot smaller and more subtle than a collar.
Steve was silent for a moment, and then said, "So.  You're building a new suit?  Another one?  Do you really need seven of 'em?"
"You're insane," Sitwell huffed. Steve smiled properly.
"In the room with the chair!" Steve was getting impatient. He'd said this already; why weren't they
"I should-- I should answer it; it might be Nat," Steve said, his voice thick. If she had news on Bucky then he needed to hear it, even if it was bad.
"...we should dose him," said Maria in a low voice to Phil.  "He's too vulnerable right now and his mood will affect Rogers's.  Better for them to just sit this heat out."
"Off," demanded Tony, playing with Steve's waistband.  He leaned forward to nose Steve's ear, run another hand down the back of his head, feel his soft blond hair.  A few brief, loving strokes; then he grabbed Steve's shirt and tugged it up, gently pulling it over his head.  His body might as well have been made of gold.  It was so utterly different than what Tony had always been led to think of as "omega."  There was nothing soft or feminine or weak about it.  It was a soldier's body, toned and taut and conditioned to perfection.
name?  What the hell do you mean, code name?"
"It's a support group for people, mostly Alphas, whose mates have been forced-bonded.  That can be a traumatic experience, and not just for the omega."
Rhodey had been here and then left; he was in the kitchen, probably arguing with Pepper and/or Aria about the party.  No
Tony groaned again, fidgeting.  He was still mostly unconscious, although he'd gotten a reflexive erection from Steve's scent.  Tiberius was pointedly trying not to look at it.
Tony passed through the lab and loped down the stairs to the server room, shivering in his bare feet, boxers, and undershirt.  There was a whole shelf of things stored in here, things Tony didn't trust to be stored off-site. He examined the boxes thoughtfully, not sure which one to start with.
"Just Tony.  No, I'm all set with Steve.  ...but you're not bonded," said Tony, nodding toward his wristband.
," moaned Tony.
The way he was speaking-- it was almost like Bucky was back. Steve wanted to reach out but there were glass and bars between them. He wanted to feel him. Feel how alive he was.
"Merry Christmas Eve," Steve added softly, nipping at his bottom lip lightly before he pulled back to sit up. His hair was a bit of a mess and he was in desperate need of a shower but food would always have to come first. Shakily, he stood and pulled Tony up with him. Steve pulled a face as he moved. Even with the super serum he was still sore between his legs. And yes, parts of the heat itself had been painful but it was nothing compared to going through one alone.
"Enjoy your honeymoon. Call if someone tries to kill you again." Natasha threw them a deadly smile over her shoulder as she pulled up to one of the airport's gates.
yet?  Or did they just let you off the leash and assume you would figure it all out on your own?  If I were you, I'd be losing my mind."
"Oh, and if you call Natasha Dark Angel in front of her again I cannot promise that you will survive the experience," Steve warned with a grin, blue eyes glinting. He could see her face already. She would be mildly impressed but try to play it down in order to not feed into Tony's ego. Clint would find it funny. She would probably insist on teaching Steve a language Tony didn't know in order to talk privately again... it could become a messy cycle very easily. Especially considering that Natasha knew ten languages, probably.
Howard that well. It's just rumor. People are only speculating 'cause I'm a 'mega. No one gave a shit when they thought I was an Alpha. It's kind of funny, when you think about it," Steve breathed and tried for a smile,  but it was weak.
"Okay? What's up?" Steve asked, shrugging at Tony to say he had no idea what was going on.
Tony took a few steps that echoed hollowly in the tile room.  Then glanced over his shoulder.  "Erm... Steve and I came together.  Steve...?"
Tony threw back a few shots to help calm himself down and then grabbed and towel and shot back downstairs, immediately getting sidetracked by--
"Hi, Tony Stark?"
Unlike her brother, she was wearing a heavy coat and a hat; her hands were buried deep in her pockets.  Perhaps because of the thickness of the coat and the fur collar, or the loose hair sticking out of the hat, she looked younger than Steve remembered.  Like a high school kid.
"They tortured him. He was like a robot." He whispered. "He'd of walked off a cliff if they told him to. What he did wasn't good but I can't... I can't even be mad at him for it." Steve frowned, his gaze becoming distant. "It feels like a branding iron. And it doesn't feel like it's his. It feels like it's HYDRA."
"I'm sorry, is he bothering you?" asked the woman, hurrying over to grab the dog.
Malick looked like he'd died and gone to heaven.
. To Tony. 'Shitty Alpha' or not Steve's body still recognised him and had wanted him. Maybe Steve had wanted to. But he wasn't allowed to, he reminded himself.
in public. You never make me feel like I have
Marathon and drinking gin straight from the bottle.
The drawing wasn't quite finished, but it was good. "I...made breakfast," he said after a quiet pause and gestured to the tray of food and coffee
Tony cringed.  "I knew you were going to say that."
Despite being a random assortment of legal experts and lawyers the group had clearly become friends. There was a fondness between them. And it was quite impressive the way they had interacted so impressively during the call. It was team work at its best.
He almost looked like he was high. He was shaking a little, like he'd had too much sugar. Steve's pupils were blown a little wide and his teeth almost chattered. Aria shoved a half eaten bagel into his mouth to stop him from biting his tongue. It was cheese and onion flavor, and it tasted sweet. He hummed in thanks and chewed on it slowly, staring out the window, thinking about how good the show had gone.
"I think Fourteen's going to be this year's high bidder," said Fred.  "Eyeballs aside, Fourteen is gorgeous."
Tony mouthed Steve's neck, teeth grazing the skin.  "Off," he commanded, yanking at Steve's clothes. His heart was still throbbing and he felt a sort of... desperation.  There was no passion or love here. Just a primal urge that he couldn't get under control, mixed with an urgency that came from fear, because his throat was still swollen with terror and his gut still twisted, but Steve's scent was hypnotic.  And it didn't help that he could smell Phil, too. Both omegas were wet and Tony was partially hard, grinding against Steve even as he clung to him.
Steve snorted.  Tony patted his arms.
"Captain Rogers really can't leave the premises," Sitwell piped up from his place at the edge of the table, hands clasped in his lap. He watched Steve devour the rest of his breakfast with mild disgust and curiosity. Steve ignored him watching. "Headquarters have been very clear about that. Pierce has issued an order."
elbow and this is your
His heart skipped a beat.
Only omegas do."
right."
"Maybe you two should go home," Sharon piped up when neither of them said anything or moved.
As if reading Steve's uneasiness, the agent turned around and held out his hand to shake.
"Stupid doctors, stupid everything." Steve muttered to himself as he headed out for a run to burn off steam. He just wanted this heat to be behind him already. He wanted to focus on Donner and his daughter (both of whom were coming over later) and he wanted nothing to do with SHIELD anymore. He was done. Steve was fucking done.
"But then what? How can I have a future without an Alpha?" His voice was so small, like he genuinely didn't know the answer... but perhaps wanted to.
"What are your credentials?" he demanded.
"Oh, I get it.  Good-cop, bad-cop, right?" said Jasper, clearly trying to maintain a level of calm.  His gaze traveled over to Natasha.
“Well, he’s a pig, but he’s a smart pig.  If he does anything like that again, I’m out,” said Pepper simply.  “He knows I don’t bluff.”
"Okay," Aria said. A short pause. "So about your next interview..."
"You gonna shoot?" he demanded, throwing his own hands up and charging them.
"Tony.
"Oh, give me a break, I don't want Hawkguy," snapped Tony, pulling away.   "Coulson's driving is just scaring the hell out of me.  ...what's your deal?  You two paired?"
"It's... lovely.  Thank you," said Tony through gritted teeth.
He snorted, lowering the cup a fraction. "Explains the dumbass suit."
Malick frowned a little.  "If only you'd been so accommodating a few months ago.  ...in addition, we've revoked your passport and, after some discussion, have agreed that your apology on Friday will go as scripted.  You're welcome to have whatever little fundraiser you want, but we're not going to let this turn into a complete fiasco. No grand-standing, no special guest appearances, no mention of Status Alliance or the Horseshoe Society.  We want a calm, non-partisan apology and we don't want you dragging horseshoe rights into this. This isn't about that."
“Right, so, we’re on the same page,” Tony replied.
His heart quickened. It was pretty common, that kind of thing.  Probably always had been, but now people were a lot more open about it.  It was normalized now, that was what Brock said. Spices things up. Steve supposed that was good.  If people wanted to do that, they shouldn’t feel bad about it.  They were still figuring out what, exactly, but, like Brock pointed out, you didn’t know what you liked until you really gave it a chance.  That was true of most everything in life, after all, even if sometimes he was pretty sure he didn’t like something right away.  But, you never knew, and he wasn’t one to tap out just because something maybe didn’t feel so great.  Wasn’t like he hadn’t had worse, and if he ever figured out how to do it right, Brock swore it would feel fantastic.  Brock seemed to enjoy it, at least, so probably, Steve would, too, eventually.
They took him back the way he and Rhodes had come earlier, through the maze that was the King’s Walk, back to Tony’s suite of rooms, where he could take the usual route to his rooms in the compound.  No one spoke, and Steve had to admit to being glad of the silence.  He did wonder what the guards thought of him, of their King, of all of this.  From the other night, it was clear they had their opinions, even if they usually chose to keep their thoughts to themselves.
“I could get rugs, maybe throw some extra padding underneath.  Or we could try one of those air mattresses.  I’d have to reinforce it, of course.  Maybe Kevlar.  I’d need to run some diagnostics.  Bet if I upped the tensile strength, it would be—“  Tony stopped speaking abruptly when Steve leaned forward and rubbed his head against Tony’s stomach.  Rationally, he’d had enough experiences in his life to know that this was the traditional position of an Omega submitting to his or her Alpha.  Hell, half the porn on the planet started out with some faux-Omega kneeling in front of a supposed Alpha.
The most creative of people are motivated by the grandest of problems presented before them, Neil offered, popping back up on the screen with brightly-colored enthusiasm.
It was an opening. Tony could answer noncommittally, if he wanted, and he hoped Tony understood that, he really did.  Though, Steve couldn’t help but wish Tony would feel comfortable talking to him about whatever it was he was up to out in that garage of his.  It felt personal, Tony’s garage, the way Steve thought of his drawings.  Maybe not exactly that, but close, he thought.  It was a part of who Tony was, that much was sure, and Steve craved knowing those parts of him, those secret, personal parts that he didn’t share easily.  But, he wouldn’t push it.  He had time.  Funny, he huffed, drawing a confused glance from Tony.  Time was on his side.  A first.
Say it,” Anthony repeated.  “
“See what happens,” Matt said.
“You are speaking of a lifetime, Tony.  You don’t know what will happen.  You cannot possibly promise that,” Steve protested, but something like certainty had already settled warm and low in his chest.  Tony had no intention of selling him or sending him away.  Even these past weeks, when anger burned like a candle in Tony’s heart, he kept Steve close.  Perhaps it shouldn’t give him comfort, but it did.
Maybe she had, Steve thought as he shook his head and huffed out something that passed for a laugh.  The laugh fell from his face as he looked down at the first file.  Stark Expo.  The Expo.  God, he could almost smell the roasted peanuts, feel the gnawing pit in his stomach as he and Bucky walked over to the girls Buck had rounded up from somewhere. The air had seemed to thrum with some kind of electricity that sparked through the crowd, the feeling of being on the edge of something. That’s what it had been. The precipice before the jump, toes curling around the edge, deep breath filling your lungs to bursting, the
“Speaking of the harem, you must help me find a new Harem Master or Mistress for the Castle.  Pepper has been making inquiries, and there are several I would have you consider,” Tony told him.
“Remember,” Ms. Potts began as she reached out a hand to hold the elevator door open.  “You’re happy newlyweds with the completely above-board, if spur of the moment, marriage.  You are also completely silent newlyweds who have absolutely nothing to say to the press.  I’m working on a press release now, so that will give them something to spin.  Steve, just follow Tony’s lead with the press, okay?  They are going to be all over this.  We don’t need to hand them more fodder than what Tony already did down at the police station.  God, you should see the photos Stern’s office leaked.  He’s got more bandages on his face than King Tut, I swear.  His people are threatening to sue, by the way, though Matt says that’s a bunch of legal posturing.”
He doesn’t love me.  He doesn’t even want me.  The words sprang instantly to the front of his mind, hung there, suspended, waiting to be said.  They were always there, at the ready.  On some kind of feedback loop that managed to be horrible and comforting, if only for the familiarity.  The predictability.  The threshold disappointment he already knew he could handle was reached, so no need to even bother trying to push past it and reach whatever lay beyond.
Steve turned back around and stared up at the Tower where Tony’s windows split the stone, remembering Cam’s words.  The Ambassador brought his concubine with him, with her monkey on a golden leash, and their children, two girls and a boy, who liked to feed the deer that populated the King’s gardens and splash in the fountain.  The Ambassador eschewed all company, save for hers, when not engaged in his duties.  She played the lute and laughed as loudly as a sailor, and her maids said the Ambassador liked to plait her hair while she read stories to the children.
“It was just a few ideas.  Not much, really,” Steve replied, feeling his cheeks warm at the praise in a different way than the other types of praise Tony heaped on him, but good nonetheless.
“I want to go home. Please, Ty, I—” Tony broke off as Ty’s grip on his chin turned bruising.  Ty leaned down close, so close that Tony could smell the alcohol on his breath, sending a danger signal blaring in the recesses of Tony’s mind.
“Well, we all know you’re overly emotional like that,” Tony grinned.  He raised a hand in greeting to Nat and Bucky, who were over by the bar with Clint and Pepper and…Happy, somewhat to Tony’s surprise, who was handing Pepper a glass of champagne.  Bucky lifted a glass in return, his metal arm glinting in the light from the chandeliers.
