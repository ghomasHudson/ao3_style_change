“What in the world have you done to our son?” Steve asked, gesturing to Peter’s walker that seemed to be adorned with an entire aisle of Valentine’s day decorations.
Peter squealed happily as he was picked up kicking his chubby legs in excitement. The ten-month-old grinned widely as his Aunt snuggled him in close to her chest.
“Good boy,” Peter praises, kissing the top of the dog’s head.
“I guess this marriage has its perks,” Steve stated with a soft smile, squeezing Peter gently. “This one, in particular, is worth it.”
“Hi, papa,” Peter greets with a wave.
Two more red lights later and Steve skidded to a sudden halt at the front of Peter’s school, nearly throwing both of them into the dashboard. They wasted no time in getting out of the car, heading towards the building. The sun had completely set at this point but in the distance, they could see a small figure curled up on a bench next to the front doors.
“Like that’s stopped him before,” Tony reminded, leaning over and smacking Steve’s hand away as he reached for another pillow. Steve glared at him and before he could speak, he held up a finger. “F.R.I.D.A.Y., be a dear and locate Peter for us.”
“Oh my God,” Steve whispered as he stepped off the elevator and into the common room. He had been slightly worried, not to mention suspicious when no one else had made it down for training.
A moment later the A.I. spoke up, “Peter does not appear to be on the premises, sir.”
And now he could see why.
Steve smiles softly, wrapping the towel around Peter before bringing the kid into his arms. He presses a kiss to the wet curls. Charlie nips at his ankles as he helps Peter dry off.
Steve came marching into the kitchen a moment later and Tony glanced up at him, noticing the mask of worry that now covered the man’s face.
He didn’t stop walking but turned around to give Clint a pointed look.
“Let’s get him back to the car,” Tony urged.
Peter laughs, shaking his head. “I think we’re both good.”
“Hi, sweetheart,” Pepper cooed, pressing a kiss to one of Peter’s tiny hands as the other one tugged gently at her hair.
The mere thought of the man burns a hole in Steve’s find and fuels the burning rage that will never diminish. It simmers, deep within and flames flare when he sees his son and remembers finding Skip on top of his baby boy, pinning him down. He knows his husband shares the same tormented thoughts and feelings. It was a parent’s worst nightmare. But there was no waking up from this one. This was reality, the realm that unleashed a monster on their son and threw him back in their arms, broken and wounded. And they had to make do with what they had.
“Peter…” Tony calls out wearily.
Steve shook his head, trying to hide the grin on his face as he walked towards his husband.
“I probably put about five layers on him this morning. Plus, we have blankets in the back,” Tony reassured, reaching over to rub the man’s hand. It was white from how hard he was gripping the steering wheel.
“Good, because dad’s almost done with dinner. If we are lucky enough, we might get one meal before he burns down the kitchen.” Steve wraps an arm around his son’s shoulder, leading the way back to the house.
“I think we can make that happen,” Steve replied with a grin, gently smoothing Peter’s hair back. He settled his hand against his son’s forehead for a moment, checking his temperature.
“Hey, hon!” Tony greeted with a beaming smile once he approached him.
Steve nodded his head, standing up with Peter cradled in his arms. Tony grabbed Peter’s backpack and followed as Steve raced back to the car.
“Always, sweetheart. I’m so sorry, baby. I’m so sorry,” Steve cooed, pressing kisses to the top of Peter’s head. Tony appeared next to him a moment later, reaching out to do the same.
“Doing okay in there, kiddo? Need anything?” Steve asks as he descends down the small set of stairs.
Peter laughs and falls to his knees, clapping and calling for Charlie who immediately abandons Tony in favor of him.
“God, he must be freezing by now,” Steve murmured, watching the wipers sweep away the snowflakes gradually falling on his windshield.
Steve glances out the window, smiling when he sees Peter floating around in the pool. Charlie, the newest addition to their family, a two-year-old Labrador retriever, hovers next to the edge of the pool, basking in the sun and yipping anytime Peter splashes water on him. He was brought in as at the suggestion of Peter’s psychiatrist and Steve’s never been more grateful for a four-legged animal before.
“He asked to go into the pool for a little bit. Charlie’s with him.” Tony waved the knife he was using to chop onions towards the doors that lead to the backyard.
“Petey?” He calls out as he steps out onto the deck. Charlie barks at him in greeting while Peter pops out from underneath the water.
Peter groaned but other than that didn’t put up much of a fight. “Fine, but that means I get extra extra marshmallows.”
“Oh, he has his ways, baby,” Steve replies, kissing the back of Peter’s head and ruffling Charlie’s head as he lets them enter the house first.
“There you go, sweetheart,” Steve murmured as he gently settled Peter in the backseat, thankful he had the heat on full blast already. Under the interior lights, he saw his son’s red-spotted cheeks and nose and the old tear tracks staining his face. He felt another piece of his heart break off and leaned over, pressing kisses to his son’s face. He was pulled back by his husband a moment later who shoved a pair of blankets in his arms before all but shoving him into the backseat.
Tony’s waving a wooden spoon threateningly at them from the kitchen island. “I heard all of that. Looks like Charles and I have a dinner date tonight. You guys can order in.”
Steve laughed, hugging Peter tight. “Our gremlin.”
“That’s not fair!” Clint whined, stomping his foot, “I’ve been waiting forever for my turn and he just gets cut in without paying. What kind of business are you running here exactly, Stark?”
Tony sighed, shaking his head before following after his husband. And, he was supposedly the one that worried too much.
It was difficult to gaze upon his son without remembering that night. It was a strange feeling. Peter was a source of comfort, light, and energy. He was their heart beating outside of their chests, running around without a care in the world. He was proof of something better, something grander than the both of them, something to fight and live for.
Pepper ignored his whines and instead gently plucked Peter out from his baby walker, which was covered in pink heart-shaped stickers along with a sign taped to the front, stating in large, glittery red letters, ‘Kissing Booth’.
On the drive back home, Tony instructed F.R.I.D.A.Y. to draw up a warm bath which Steve whisked Peter off to the second they arrived home. Now, a half-hour later, Peter was dressed in his warmest pajamas, curled up on Steve’s lap in front of the fireplace as he sipped from a bowl of chicken noodle soup.
Steve always had a calm, patient composure when driving. However, that was not the case when there was one eight-year-old little boy stranded at school, wondering where his father was. Tony counted no more than five red lights that Steve had driven through, and enough curses to fill not one, not two, but three swear jars at this point. If this was occurring in any other context, Tony might have been slightly turned on. But that was for another day.
Steve’s face suddenly paled and his arms fell limp at his side. “Oh fuck,” He whispered.
“Feel warm enough, baby?” Steve asked as Peter finished off the bowl. “Daddy’s almost finished with your hot chocolate.”
“Oh, this little gremlin of mine,” Tony teased, ruffling Peter’s hair gently, earning him an indignant cry from his son.
The dog whimpers as Peter runs upstairs until Steve takes pity on him and starts to play fetch.
“He’s doing good,” Tony comments softly a few minutes later, absentmindedly stirring the pasta sauce.
“He’s probably hanging out with someone else from the team, hon,” Tony suggested as he followed Steve around the living room as the man started to inspect every nook and cranny.
“Shit,” He cursed, setting the jug of milk down and grabbing a towel to wipe off the spot of milk he spilled on the counter.
“And somehow you still fell in love with me,” Tony pointed out with a smirk as Steve drew back.
“Come here, baby,” Steve beckoned as the door slammed shut behind him and he settled into the backseat. Peter shuffled over, pressing his face into his chest, shivering and teeth chattering. Steve wrapped the blankets around his son, before hugging him close.
“How much extra for cuddling, again?” Pepper asked, pen hovering over the checkbook in her hand.
“That’ll be twenty-five cents per minute, Miss Potts. Max of five minutes,” Tony dutifully answered.
Peter, who had been reveling in his Aunt Pepper’s snuggles and kisses on the couch, finally saw Steve. “Pa!” He shrieked, wiggling around in Pepper’s lap until she set him gently on the ground and he waddled over, arms out.
“Yeah, he is.” Steve smiles wearily, throwing the tennis ball for Charlie to catch. He knows some good things don’t remain.
Steve scoffed softly, tapping Peter on the nose. “You drive a hard bargain, young man. You’re too much like your dad.”
Peter giggles before hoisting himself out of the pool in time for Steve to be there with open arms and a towel.
He watches as Steve's eyes flutter open, still holding his hand with his own. He watches as his eyes open fully, and then it's almost like a pin dropped somewhere in the room. He watches the soldier look around, eyebrows cast downwards, furrowed, a deep frown on his face as his eyes look around the room. He sees the adhesion in his right eye now that he's a lot closer to him than he was back at the plane, and now that he's not staring only at his lip. He felt the blonde squeeze his hand tighter, confusion so prominent on his face, mixed in with slight fear, and it just breaks Tony's heart.
he sends you guys in. On top of that, only the real Fury would be able to put up with my shit for as long as he did, so you're in the clear cyclops." Fury rolled his eye and shook his head and Tony's comment.
"What's so funny?" Steve asked.
"I guess the word
Clint was unconscious, unresponsive in the stretcher they carried him on, his body littered with gashes that were visible and not covered by his clothes, he looked so vulnerable and pale. Then there was Natasha, stone-cold, emotionless Natasha, struggling against the doctors that were holding her down, only for her to fight her way through them.
"He told me all about himself from when he was a scrawny kid from Brooklyn. Everything, not leaving out a single detail. When we got back, he wanted to ask me about my father to which I instantly replied no. From there I said... I practically told him that I wish he was never found so he wouldn't be here today."
As the brunette walked through the door, he wouldn't be lying if he said he was a bit overwhelmed. The room itself was dark, even with the multiple tube-shaped blue lights surrounding the perimeter, attached to the bottom, sides, and top of the walls, it was still significantly hard to see, but just lit barely enough for him to see the creature shackled to the table. He slowly inched his way forward, the sound of the door closing, followed by footsteps close behind him as he sat down.
"That's what I want to get to the bottom of," Tony said, walking away from Clint's side and towards the door behind Fury, "can you give me access to your security room? I wanna check the footage and find the missing pieces to this puzzle."
He clenched his jaw and looked at the man in disgust. Of course, Ross would stoop this low and give him an ultimatum. But regardless, he'd rather take the latter option than give up the soldier.
Steve leaned forward and pecked Tony's lip softly before grabbing the blanket that resided next to him, pulled Tony flush against his body on his lap, causing the genius to blush a little bit, much to Steve's pleasure, before laying down and gently placing the blanket over both their forms.
He was there to carry her coffin on his shoulders, trying so hard not to break down in front of everyone, and he succeeded. He learned a few things that day: such as the fact that Sharon Carter was Peggy's niece- and really he should have seen that one coming, but then again he never really knew her last name anyways- and that love hurts. He loved Peggy with all his heart, and he was reminded of that each day he visited her once he found out her location. He made sure to listen to her stories, tend to her when needed, and as much as it hurt him, he was there for her when she forgot who he was, over and over again. But he loved her, young and old; because even if Steve is technically a twenty-seven-year-old man who was frozen in ice at that age, he will always be that ninety-seven, bordering one-hundred, or even greater- year old who should have had a life with Peggy, and gone through what she had with her.
"I got you, big guy. I'm here." He whispered, scared that if he spoke any louder he might hurt Steve. The soldier smiled, and how it hurt him in a way to see how this damaged man, who was most likely in so much pain, still had the heart to smile in a time like this. But he didn't do anything except smile back and brush his long blonde locks, ignoring how he got blood on his fingers.
"I have not." He denied, eyebrows lowered and face expressionless as he spoke.
"Captain Rogers is trying to call you." And just like that, he fumbled around his desk littered with spare parts, searching for his phone, and laying it in front of him, accepting the call.
"I'll explain on the way there. Right now, Nat and Clint, I need you two to get the Quinjet ready for take-off. Once everybody is on and we're in the air, I'll explain the plan." The spies nodded their heads. "Alright Avengers, assemble." With that, they all left the common area. Well, everybody except for Tony. He sighed to himself and turned around to look out of the window which gave him a great view of all of Manhattan. "Tony?"
"I wanted to say thank you." This caused Tony to raise an eyebrow and look at Steve with an amused expression.
"Yea!" He shouted. "Yea. Sorry, I'm here. I'm alright."
He wiped the sweat off of Steve's forehead, leaning in slowly, placing his soft, yet calloused, dry lips onto his forehead in a gentle kiss. He then rested his own forehead against the sleeping blonde's, running his fingers gently through his blonde locks, while the soldier's own beard scratched against his goatee. It was an act that Tony had done in the past whenever Steve was having a nightmare, and for the life of him, he could not just let the soldier go through this alone.
"They said they have therapy lined up for you to help you get through this, and they gave me the option to decide if you want to do it here or not. And I wanted to ask you if... Do you wanna go to therapy at S.H.I.E.L.D.?" The soldier shook his head in response, and really could Tony blame him for not wanting to speak again? He figures hearing his own voice right now sounded foreign to him. It was comparable to that of someone who took the end of a balloon and sucked the helium into their respiratory system, their voice changing into a much higher octave than what it originally was, but at the same time, that comparison is quite different. The soldier's voice was still his own; same octave, same soothing sound, but just a little jump in his speech pattern. Maybe it was more like a car when you tried to get it to start but the engine kept stuttering, not willing to function properly. Or maybe even a heart monitor, where the consistent beep would cause the line to jump and break the oh-so-steady straight line. Then again, if the line were straight it would just be one continuous long beep. That's beside the point.
"Tony-"
"Tell me about yourself." If he wasn't confused before, he was certainly confused now.
He has a dark side that not many people know about. He's angry because he has no one to fight for, he's aggressive because he's lost so much in his life; girlfriend, and best friend, who he still blames himself for, and not to mention he's lost someone who he never expected to get close to. He hurt him so badly, but it wasn't his fault. Everyone says it's his fault, but realistically the entirety of the situation does not sorely rest upon his shoulders.
"Of course, Captain. But I must warn you that where you are going is most likely a death sentence." T'Challa warned. He knew the risk he was willing to take, but he didn't care. He cared more about Tony's well-being and safety than he did his own, and he wouldn't forgive himself if anything bad had happened to Tony. Who knows what Ross could have done to him by now?
"W-where did you send h-him?" To an untrained eye, they might not have noticed the way T'Challa's stance faltered for a second; the way his shoulder has slumped just slightly, the way the corner of his mouth curved downwards for a few seconds before it returned to its straight-line posture.
"Trying!" He maneuvered through the thicket of trees, all while trying to maintain stabilization in the air. It wasn't easy as the jet threatened to dip downwards a couple of times, and with the chopper behind him shooting at him, it was just getting more difficult by the second.
He made his way back to his room, peeling off his clothes in the bathroom and stepping inside the shower. He turned on the hot water, letting the scalding water pour down his tired form, washing away the agony that resided deep within his body.
He had it bad, but he was
"How you holding up, Steve? Wanda told us what happened." Nat said once she sat down.
It was a stupid thought, and he knows it's stupid because he
"Yes, sir?" The AI replied.
"Ms. Maximoff is on her way, sir. In the meantime, is there anything I can do for you?" Once again he pondered, staring into space. What exactly could JARVIS do? Well, for one, the AI could tell him what Steve was up to by now, but that would just make him want to go back to drinking that taunting bottle of whiskey that is still sitting within his reach. He could ask his AI to tell him a joke, which for a lack of a better term, would turn to shit since he's pretty sure he didn't program humor into JARVIS, only sass; which he wasn't even sure he programmed into him, he just assumed he picked it up from Tony. There was one thing, however, that JARVIS could do.
"I know this is my first time and all, but don't you want me to... Prep you, before I uh..." He trailed off, blushing.
While he sees nothing but darkness, he can still hear everything around him. He hears the elevator ding, as well as the doors opening to let them inside. They ding once more as the doors close, and he can feel the little ounce of gravity elevators temporarily have when they move up or down. In this case, gravity is temporarily weighing him down, so he knows that they're heading towards the upper floor, where the common area is.
"Don't worry," she said softly, "I'll make sure to take the pain away." The way she said those words sent a shiver down my spine.
"How do I do... What?"
That's where things took a turn. It was when that blonde, blue-eyed beauty named Steve Rogers started entering his lab, with promises of food and coffee, but only if he came out of his lab and slept like a proper human being. It was a trap, which is what he first thought of in his mind when the soldier started pestering him and refusing to leave, standing his ground and even going so far as to drag Tony away from his tinkering much like Pepper used to. In a way, Steve was Tony's Pepper, and maybe at the time he thought with their growing friendship or, relationship, it was all too confusing for him at the time, that maybe he might be Steve's Peggy. But Peggy was soft, with a steely, no shits given attitude she carried with her everywhere. She was calculating, clear-minded, intelligent, and Tony, well he for sure was intelligent and calculating, but also the opposite of Peggy. He was reckless, self-destructive, always putting up metaphorical masks where his face is and walls where his heart was to protect himself from letting someone get too close. It worked wonders for him until Steve tore down everything he worked for.
"Spit it out then, Tin Can."
"Hey... I was wondering when you'd show up. Was gettin' kinda lonely in here." The genius told him. He chuckled in response and shook his head, letting the door gently close behind him as he made his way over towards the bedside, taking a seat next to the brunette and placing his hand gently over the back of his.
"You know damn well that I had no choice." He replied, which only seemed to piss off the genius even more.
"No, Tony, it's not. What happened to Steve is not your fault. They were manipulated into thinking they were going on a harmless mission when instead it was a trap." Bruce sighed and stepped away from Steve for a bit, pinching the bridge of his nose, his fingers grabbing a clipboard that held information on the soldier. "The serum is working slowly to try and mitigate the damage to his body, although we can see the physical wounds they've done, who's to say it goes further than that."
"Earth to Steve." He blinked and turned his gaze on the genius, who chuckled as he looked at him. "Guess the coffee maker wins." He grabbed a mug from the top cabinets littered on the walls, placing the mug under the coffee machine, pressing his pointer finger on one button, and watching as his cup filled to the brim with dark liquid. Steve swore his scowl deepened, and his suspicion was confirmed when he saw the genius look at him with a questioning gaze, one eyebrow raised. "Did you want to go first?"
"Wait." Tony suddenly said, panting as he pulled back from the kiss. "Are you sure you wanna do this? We can wait if you-"
"Get ready boys, might have our work cut out for us," Natasha said, getting up out of her seat after settling the jet down on the landing pad. Steve stood up, followed by Bucky who had previously sat in the co-pilot seat next to Nat. Natasha brought one of her guns, a Glock 26, out of its pocket on her thigh, handing it to Bucky who simply just stared at it.
It felt wonderful to
"God it feels good to kiss you again." Another giggle found its way out of Steve's mouth, pecking Tony's lips shortly after it was released into the air.
"What was that for?" Tony inquired.
"Be patient, my dear Captain." He moved his finger slowly at first, enjoying the way Steve's face contorted out of pleasure, the way he bit his lip to suppress his moans, and the way his cock twitched in response to his ministrations. A second finger was added, and then a third. He could feel how Steve's hole was stretching to accommodate his fingers, and he absolutely adored how Steve swore and begged him for more, how there was just a hint of pre-cum slowly dripping down from his tip, and how Steve gripped the sheets and whimpered, wanting to touch himself so badly. It turned him on how Steve reacted to what he was doing, and it only increased his urges to want to just take the Captain right then and there. He took out his fingers, listening to Steve whimper this time at the loss of pleasure before he pressed his tip against his hole, rubbing it up and down ever so slowly to tease not only the blonde but himself as well.
In reality, this is very true. Even if he shared somewhat romantic interest in Sharon, it didn't really feel right. He regrets kissing her; not just because she's the niece of his dead first lover, but because in a way he might have led her on, and that's not who he was. He was a simple guy, born and raised in the 1940s with non-complicated ideologies. He respected anyone and everyone, except bullies, he hated bullies. He didn't care what your race was, your gender, nor your sexuality, to him you were a person. Even if you were a bad guy you were still a person to him, but he would have to apprehend you rather than get to know you because that's his job as a superhero. Actually, that's more of who he is as a person; a law-abiding citizen with no bad bone or dark side.
He let out a sigh of frustration and gripped his hair, tugging on his curly brown locks out of anger. Why couldn't he just be with them, why was it so hard to just fucking let Tony come along with Steve? Why would Fury set them up?
"Let's go win."
"I love you, Anthony." The special nickname that only Steve was allowed to call him just made his heart metaphorically flutter, widening his smile just enough that if he kept this facial expression for too long, his cheeks would start to hurt.
In an instant, as quick as it came, the fear was replaced by the cold, steel gaze he was first met with. Tony looked away once more, a sigh escaping past his lips, the hand not holding onto the door was slowly forming into a fist, the tension in the air thick, and in Tony's case, suffocating.
"Don't worry about me, J. I'll be back before you know it." The lab door closed, and the lights shut off as Tony made his way in his Iron Man suit to S.H.I.E.L.D. HQ.
He thought Steve was always going to be by his side, through thick and thin. He was the only person other than Pepper who was a staple in his life, keeping him grounded from going off the deep end, and doing something he'd regret. Granted, Ultron had been just a small step in going off the deep end, but he honestly wanted to protect rather than create a murder bot. Either way, he chose his best friend over him, and it crushed him.
"Jeez... What's with all the yelling? I'm tryna sleep." A voice from across the room spoke. Tony sat up abruptly, rushing out of his seat over to Clint's side as he groaned and moved around in the stretcher.
However, the one thing he didn't prepare for, or suspect himself to care for, was the sleeping super-soldier on the couch. Simply hearing Jarvis announce that Steve was experiencing a nightmare, a bad one too, was enough to drive the genius from his shelter in the lab to seek out Steve's room and make sure he was ok. It left this weird light feeling in his chest; which to him sounded crazy, considering there was something actually
"Well, with a tower full of superheroes who care for each other, do you really think we'd let you hurt Steve? Well, let you hurt Steve again, for that matter?" Bruce did have a point, they'd all be on his ass about why he hurt the blonde. Shit, just Natasha visiting him alone and asking him what he did, without killing him was enough for him to realize that if he did fuck up again, it would be more than just Natasha having a word with him. He isn't quite sure if the big guy would be up to talking.
"Thank you, T'Challa. It means a lot." Tony said. And how sweet it was for Tony to tell T'Challa what was on his mind because sometimes, the genius just knew what he was thinking and what he wanted to say.
He reaches the communal area and walks over towards the spiral staircase leading to the second floor, two at a time, and walking over towards the makeshift balcony that gives them a view of the yard beyond the glass windows. He sees the genius sitting on top of a white sheet, two bags of food, and what appears to be milkshakes sitting next to him as he stares out the window. He smiles and quietly makes his way over towards the genius.
"Well, he went on his mission with Nat and Clint, and I know you've been a little happier than usual. Even Steve's been happier than usual. So, I'm curious if there's more to this than just hanging out because the last time Steve's been this happy is when we were hanging out for movie night."
"We're going to get through this. Just like you told me all those years ago, old man.
mean that he belongs to them. Steve isn't property, he's a human being who should have a say in what he can and cannot do. However, he can't really get all riled up because of this, because if there's even a chance for Steve to protect anybody, even if he disagrees with the things Fury and the organization of assholes do, he'd still go to protect everyone he can.
"It's only been a few hours. Did you miss me that much?"
It's been an eventful week for Tony, or as eventful as he wanted it to be. He spent the week enjoying his time talking to his super-soldier, enjoying how the lab was full of laughter and the sweet sound of his voice. It was a nice touch to drown out all the busy work he was doing; which included building two robots for Dum-E who goes by the name of Butterfingers and You. Butterfingers was the first robot he started working on, and the reason why he named it Butterfingers was because, well, as the name implies, the bot is very clumsy. He remembered giving it Dum-E's favorite blender to hold, and the appliance met its untimely end when the bot dropped it, shattered glass spilling all over the lab floor. In return, sparked him to create his next robot, You. The way he came up with that name was, well, he simply said "hey, you, clean this up," and the name seemed to have just stuck since he couldn't think of anything creative to call the robot. He also had to build a new blender for Dum-E, since he was so emotionally scarred, or rather, Tony felt he was emotionally scarred.
and make an attempt. He hesitantly opened the book to a fresh new page, and already he started to feel anxious. That stupid milky white spot in his eye that appeared from time to time made the paper look weird, like a weird blurry white blob. Regardless, he brought the pencil tip down onto the paper, slowly drawing the first line. And it was hard to draw anything without focusing on the fact that he can't accurately see what he's drawing, and it frustrated him. The anxiety he felt soon turned into frustration, his eyebrows furrowed with a small crease in between them, and a deep scowl on his face.
"No," he said firmly, "even if this is a trap, even if it's not Hydra's doing, we should still try to figure out why we were sent here. I trust Iron Man will be able to crack the encryption and we'll be able to figure out what's going on here."
"Hey, Nat, listen to me, you gotta calm down, you're safe."He tried to soothe her.
"I'd like that." And so he stood up, walking out the door first just like last time. Unlike the last time, where Tony was more distant with him, more secluded, and wanting nothing more than to be as far away from him as possible, he was more relaxed. The distance he put was less noticeable, but there was still some space left between them, and truthfully, Steve is willing to accept this because at least Tony is a bit more comfortable around him. It's a small win in his books.
"Fury that son of a
"If they take you out, man of Iron, then we lose our intellect. You're the smartest out of all of us when it comes to these types of things, Fury has told me all the data you've collected, and it proves that you know too much."
"I'm afraid to answer that in your current state. However, the Captain is on his way to your location."
"I wanted to tell you that Nat and Clint are sorry. I kinda... Yelled at them, for what they said." Steve scratched the back of his head, and Tony could faintly make out the sign of red that stained his cheeks as he did, indicating the soldier was a little embarrassed about it.
The last thing he wanted to do, as he walked towards his destination T'Challa mentioned, was that he wanted to tell Tony he loved him. While it is a simple thing realistically, it has so much meaning to not only himself but the world's hold the deepest meaning that not many people realize.
"When I went into the security room I had Jarvis record the footage to confirm Nat's suspicion, turns out she was right." He paused to grab his phone, holding the edge of the device with his thumb and pointer, tapping the space in front of him as four holograms of footage appeared. "The first one shows Fury making the assignment a few minutes before telling you about it, then he went to his office where he gave you the mission directly, but check this out," he stopped to point at the third screen, "this baby right here, shows the exact time as the second one next to it, and it's the real Fury asking where you guys went. The fourth one happens a few minutes after that one where the fake Fury comes to try and kill me."
"You talk too much. How about you put your mouth to good use first." If Tony wasn't turned on right now, then Steve's sentence
He nodded his head as best as he could, not taking his eyes off of Tony's for even a second. He noticed the small orange hue that danced around in his brown iris, comparable to the way a flame seemed to dance when it was exposed to an air source current blowing on it from the side. It not only contrasted his brown eyes, but in a way, the orange complimented it, made it all the more beautiful.
"I know that, but I mean I missed you when I was... Ya know." And of course Tony knows what he means, how could he not? He was the one who found Steve practically hanging on to his life by a thread. He won't forget how close he was to losing him, how his head bobbed around as he carried his body. He couldn't, and wouldn't, ever forget that. "I know I'm traumatized, and I'm willing to admit that, but I miss spending moments like this with you. And I'm sorry we can't be as close as we were, I know it must suck."
"Well, we got word of an SOS from a specific location, when we found them... It wasn't pretty. They have some broken ribs, bullet wounds on the shoulder and abdomen area, gashes on their body, broken wrist, and sprained ankle. Some damage to the chest area of the male, and some patches of blood on the head of the female. Whatever did that to them, did a pretty nasty job."
He quickly moved towards the Quinjet, the hangar already open as it usually is. He made his way towards the cockpit, sitting himself down on one of the two pilot chairs. He raised his hand to flip the switches hanging just above him, bringing the jet to life with a soft humming sound. He then flipped the switches in front of him, bringing up the hangar and starting the engines. The entrance to the underground harbor slowly opened, and he waited for the signal.
What exactly would he do if he never got to see Steve again? Well, for starters he'd go crazy. He'd blame himself for not being able to be there to make sure Steve was alright, was that a little clingy? Hell if he would know, it probably was, but can you really blame him? He would most definitely lock himself away from the outside world, doing whatever he could put his mind to, to distract him. But he couldn't distract himself from that because Steve would always be on his mind, even after he's gone. Fuck he's digging a hole for himself the more he keeps thinking about this. Steve is fine, he has Natasha and Clint with him, nothing can go wrong.
"You're right," he agreed, nodding his head and getting out of his seat, "I'm going to go and talk to Steve right now." They all smiled at him and said their goodbyes, but before Tony completely disappeared, he turned back around and shouted, "thanks for the wonderful meal, Romanoff!"
blood, and it would give him nightmares if he saw the soldiers blood on his own hands because then, he would constantly remember when Steve was practically dying in front of him and he was unable to do anything. He doesn't want to remember this moment where Steve might be fighting for his life, or if he died right here. He doesn't need that on his conscience.
He yelled at himself in his thoughts. He was careful as he put his arms under Steve's legs, the other under the upper part of his back. He lifted him slowly, shivering slightly as he watched the blood drip from Steve's head onto the Quinjets floor. He heard a small groan and saw Steve's eyelids start to flutter. He positioned him in a way that his head was gently resting against the suit's shoulder as he walked out, keeping his eyes on Steve's bloody face while he still tried to open his eyes. He was careful as he stepped out of the jet, taking a few more steps away from the damaged vehicle before he gently knelt, laying Steve's legs onto the solid leafy ground, moving around while he held his head for him to sit down and place it into his lap as his eyes finally opened.
"So, uh... Coffee?" The genius turned his frown as quickly as he could into a smile, making his way over to the coffee machine.
Steve's eyes were glazed, darkened by lust. A string of saliva connected from the tip of his dick to Steve's lip, and he could vaguely feel his hot breath against his member. It sent shivers down his spine and made him throb more. Steve smiled and licked his lips, his eyes staring into Tony's.
It's as he walks through the door does the guilt overwhelms him, overflow past his breaking point. It's when he walks over to the seat next to Steve's bed does he start to break down, continuously chanting in his head that it's all his fault and that he should have done more. While the tears flow down his face, he grabs the soldier's hand with both of his and places a kiss on the back of his hand, bringing it up to his forehead so he may rest against it while broken sobs fill the room.
Maybe this is why he and Pepper never worked out, really. It wasn't only the fact that his life was dangerous; more dangerous than he probably would admit to himself, considering most people would consider him suicidal since he A) kept the fact he was dying of palladium poisoning from everyone and B) flew a nuclear warhead into an interdimensional portal, ignoring the fact that he may never return and possibly die. Although he did technically die, in a sense. The Arc Reactor flickered as he felt himself slowly being pulled down by gravity towards the portal. As his eyes closed, the reactor stopped working, and he swore he felt the painful slither of Shrapnel coursing its way through his heart trying to kill him. But it also came down to the fact he was an emotional introvert. It was hard for him to express what he felt, and truthfully Pepper, not just Pepper, but even Steve, deserved better than to deal with him.
"It's true," Tony shrugged his shoulders, looking away from Steve, "I hurt you once, and I told myself I would never do that again. You really deserve someone who will make you happy; I even believed that that person could've, or would've been me if I wasn't such an asshole. You deserve someone who's just like you, sweet, adorable, a heart made of gold and genuinely cares about people and won't get mad at everyone, and isn't a total fuck up. You don't deserve-" He was cut off from his ramble by Steve's hand grasping his chin gently, turning his head towards him, and placing his lips onto Tony. It was a sweet way to get him to shut up, and he smiled as he kissed back. The soldier's hand moved from his chin, snaked its way across his left cheek to the back of his head, his fingers getting lost in brown curls as he deepened the kiss, eliciting a moan from the genius. Steve was the first to pull back, a smile on his face as he watched Tony relax a bit in front of him.
"If you ever stopped talking as much as you do, Tony, I think we'd have to be seriously worried about you." Pepper jokes.
And he wondered to himself if he should really believe that. This whole mess started because Tony called him under pretense, which led to him being sent to the raft where he got beaten every day, basically left there to die at the hands of Ross. And now, could Steve put his faith, his broken trust, his damaged, aching heart full of love for this man into believing for a second, that the words Tony was speaking were the truth. Could he
"Something like that, and if they used cyanide pills, the bodies would still be there. I'm not even sure if they were normally Hydra agents either. It seemed really odd to me, Nat said the same thing too."
the super-spy twins, to just make a game out of. He was a living, breathing human with emotions just like them, even if Nat chooses to repress them. In his blinding rage, he found himself in his lab, just as messy as when he left it.
He watched Steve hesitate, the gun in his hand shaking just a little bit. He watched Steve's face, the serious expression crumbling into one full of relief, the gun and his shield dropping onto the floor as he moved towards Tony, picking him up and wrapping his arms around him, resting his head into his chest as he sobbed.
They sit there and munch on their food, enjoy each other's presence. And it's just perfect for both of them. There are no words that need to be spoken right now, as they want to enjoy the moment for as long as it lasts. But sadly, they can't ignore the elephant in the room that they have yet to talk about.
"Well, what do you wanna know?"
"Alright, you've had your laugh. Now hurry up and get outta my lab and get some clothes. We're going out." He walked away from the couch, closing down the holograms of his suits, as well as the ones of his teammates' suits. As he looked back, he saw a blushing super soldier just standing there, a blanket wrapped around his waist. Did Tony raise his eyebrow? Most definitely. It's not because Steve is standing there in his boxers with just a blanket, but because Steve was just standing there.
"Aye, I can assure you these creatures will feel the full might of my powers for all they've done," Tony smirked, liking the way the Asgardian spoke.
"Uh... Yeah. Let her in." The door to the lab opened and he heard the sound of boots thudding against the floor. He counted the minutes, the seconds even until the boots stopped a few feet away from him. He turned around slowly and his eyes met a less than amused Natasha Romanoff, standing there with her arms crossed, a stoic look on her face, but if he knew any better with how long they've lived together, deep down she was probably a little bit pissed at him.
"No, actually you're right on time," Tony replies, his own beaming, warm smile plastered on his face. He nods his head and sits down carefully, extending his legs all the way out and sitting as close to the genius as he can. He turns towards Tony and notices the genius wearing a black, grey, and white checkered collared shirt, covered with a sleek black jacket, black dress pants, and red, black, and white sneakers. It was simple, with just a touch of fancy, and that was perfectly ok with Steve.
"You... You don't mean that, right?"
Why couldn't he shoot? He knew this thing wasn't Steve, he just
to the genius for what he did. So, if kissing a picture in his sketchbook that holds so much sentimental value is the only way he's ever going to kiss the man he so desperately still loved and wanted, then what was so weird or wrong about that?
"What if we lose?"
He swears he's not going insane. It's not due to the lack of nutrition and water, no matter what anybody says, and it's not due to the lack of sleep for several days. Okay, he can't keep lying to himself, it was due to the lack of sleep because he was a lot more irritable than usual.
"Please wake up... I can't do this." He whispered. He crumbled up the sheets in his hands, squeezing them until his knuckles turned white. The first wave of tears dripped onto the sheets, a sob escaping past his lips shortly after. He whipped them away as fast as they came but soon enough, more replaced the first wave. He released the bed sheets and placed his head in his hands, letting his sobs wrack his body as the noise coming from his mouth was muffled behind his hands. He didn't even acknowledge when the door to the room opened and a hand was placed on his shoulder, causing him to jump and flinch in response. He turned around and noticed Natasha, a deep scowl etched into her face as she looked at him.
And it was on the fifth day of waking up, no breakfast in the morning, no Tony coming into his room to get him, or at his therapy session, that he started to shut down again and become distant and cold. He stopped trying to fix his speech impediment; every time they wanted him to repeat the words they spoke, or write down a sentence he wanted to say and have him say it to them, he simply shrugged and always said: "w-what's t-the p-point?"

If either of these themes makes you uncomfortable, feel free to skip the first half of the chapter in which, we are in Steve's POV, and feel free to go to the next scene break, indicated by the asterisks.

that Steve wanted to ask? There were too many why's to ask: why am I here, why aren't I dead, why did you save me, and so many more options to choose from, but all of them seemed redundant. He didn't know what he wanted to ask, so he simply just didn't respond. How could he respond, when he wasn't even sure just how deep Tony's question went, considering the genius might be asking his own form of "why did you's" in his own head.
As Tony occupied himself with popping popcorn and getting some soda from the fridge, he wondered what would be a good movie for them to watch? What exactly do you watch with someone who's been in cryostasis for 70 years? He figures that Star Trek would be easier to watch than Star Wars; not that he doesn't
"Oh, fuck!" Steve swore. Tony released the organ from his mouth, laughing to himself a bit.
"Because I'm willing to do whatever you want? With some exceptions, of course."
It clicked inside of Tony's head that in his moment of rage, he may have said something he definitely didn't mean. Of course, he didn't mean it when he said that he and Steve would never get together, he was just really angry at the spy twins. He was never the best when it came to rational speaking whenever he was angry, and tonight just proved that as he said something he deeply regrets right now.
He felt his hand being squeezed, followed by a soft groan. He knew Steve was beginning to wake up, but he feared how the soldier might take the news once he's told, or even realizes that something is wrong.
Tony's slumber was disturbed by a buzzing sound somewhere in the room. He tried to ignore it, snuggling closer into Steve, hand wrapped around his waist, cheek pressing up against the top of his head. The buzzing got more prominent, and he grumbled in response, turning away from Steve ever so slightly, opening his eyes just enough to form a glare. The source of the irritable buzzing sound that rudely woke him up from his peaceful slumber next to his super-soldier, came in the form of none other than his Stark phone. He ever so gently, ever so quietly as to not wake up Steve, moved off of the bed, and trekked over towards his pants, fishing out his phone from his pocket.
"Well, if you got inside of his head to hurt him, maybe there's a way to reverse it, right?" It was a long shot, but with her mind manipulating powers, maybe there was a way she could reverse the effects. She sighed and shook her head, her shoulder slumping in defeat.
He didn't stir, didn't whimper, didn't make so much as a peep. He slept quietly through the night, the only sound in his ears was the sound of Jarvis, Tony's bots, his tools, and the occasional swearing of said genius. It was... Weird for Steve, in a sense. It should've been hard for him to fall asleep, considering whenever he was around someone he always felt lonely. But it was... Different this time around. It felt weird that this time - this one simple time where he
"Coming home and seeing you." Tony didn't know what came over him, but he had this uncontrollable and strong urge to propel himself forward, jump onto Steve, wrap his legs around his waist and his arms around his neck, and place a passionate kiss onto the soft pink lips of the super-soldier. He felt the small vibration of Steve giggling against his lips, as well as the curve of them as he smiled into the kiss. He felt the blonde hold onto the underside of his knees as he returned the kiss, opening his mouth for the genius and allowing him to explore every part of it. God, Tony was in a state of bliss from kissing Steve, and he wouldn't lie to say he absolutely
A pained chuckle escaped past Steve's lip, followed by a small fit of coughing that seemed to have agitated his body, making him cough slightly harder. He took a minute to breathe, staring up at Tony as he spoke. "I'm sorry for Siberia. I'm sorry for hurting you and putting a strain on our relationship. There's just so much I'm sorry for, but I don't know if I have the time." He swallowed hard, blinking back some tears that threatened to fall.
The room looked the same as he remembered it- from all those times before things went to shit where he would go to Steve, telling him about his nightmares and spending the night with the super-soldier. He sighed softly and made his way over towards the neatly made bed, a thick blue blanket covering the white sheets that lay underneath. It's just as soft as he remembers it as if he was laying on top of a cloud. Truth be told, Tony spent the most amount of time designing Steve's room, making sure he had everything, but it was simple enough to not overwhelm him. He smiles at the memory of the soldier thanking him, hugging and telling him he loved the room.
for him to get his hands on unnerved him. He felt naked for a few minutes, lost on who he was. He was Tony Stark; genius, billionaire, ex-playboy, philanthropist, he
"How are your wounds?" His brows furrowed, and he actually realized that there wasn't blood soaking his clothes, nor was there any significant amount of pain in his body- and even if there was it was simply small, and would only hurt at the moment before dissipating entirely.
"Heh," it chuckled, smirking at him, "I think you'd be more worried about your property back home?" Tony's narrowed his eyes, suspicion with a hint of confusion etched into his face.
"That's Dum-E, one of my creations. Say hi to Wanda, Dum-E." The robot opened and closed its claw, making some sort of sound that Wanda could probably interpret as happiness. She giggled and patted the creation's claw, making Dum-E move closer to her in its own special way of hugging her. "He likes you," Tony said smiling. "Don't stay up too late Dum-E, you need to recharge ok?" The robot nodded its claw and proceeded to head over to the corner where its charging station was.
"You can't keep blaming me for everything, Tony."
Put as he grabs the screwdriver, he simply stops in place and stares at the silver desk in front of him, heavily cluttered with spare parts, tools, and former pieces of his old team's suits and weapons. He couldn't concentrate, not when everything from his past- all the good times he had with his family from movie nights to game nights, and even when they tried to lift Thor's hammer, was staring him right in the face.
"Alright, so what do you wanna know?"
"We're gonna find him, I promise." He nodded his head slowly and rested his head against the stretcher, letting Natasha lull him into a gentle nap, a calm before the storm.
, but this is out of my league," Tony stated. "This isn't something technological that I can solve and know by heart like the back of my hand, this is something far advanced, this is aliens we're talking about!" He could feel the anger getting to him, his jaw clenched as he took a shaky breath to calm himself down. "This isn't like the Chitauri, where there is a visible weakness, this is something bigger than that, and I can't crack it. You want help figuring this out? Call Thor, he's the one who can figure this shit out. All I can do is provide tech and evidence that has been laid out in front of me. Extraterrestrial shit, I cannot solve." He huffed out a breath of irritation and crossed his arms, sitting back in the chair.
"I fucked up."
"Please J, you know me," he said with a smirk, "when do I ever do anything irrational?"
He could feel something soft against his back; whether it was silk or cotton, or any other form of material, he didn't know, but as his senses came back to him, and he could feel the material against the few inches of exposed skin on his forearm- which was to him weird at first until he noticed that the cuffs he once wore were no more, and he confirmed it to himself that he was on a bed of some sort if the sheet he concluded to himself was anything to go by.
stuttered, "what did... What did you have in mind?"
"Screw it." He muttered. He backed up just a little bit, and ran at the door, using his shoulder to try and knock down the steel door. He collided with it, but it only made a small dent in the steel and set his shoulder on fire with a shot of pain coursing through it. He didn't care, however, because even if he got hurt right now the serum would fix it and all pain would be forgotten. So, he backed up again and rammed into the door with his shoulder a second time, loosening the screws that kept the door hinged. The third time he rammed into it, the door unhinged itself and fell inwards with a loud thud, giving him access to the prison cell.
"I took her to the gym after that creature came in here pretending to be you. And I... Oh God, Tony I
"W-what?" He stuttered.
"As soon as w-we get inside, I w-want you t-two to keep guard and s-stop anybody who tries to in-interfere. I'll go get T-Tony, and bring him b-back." It was a simple plan, but it was pretty much self-explanatory what needed to be done: infiltrate the Raft, take out any guards, bring back the genius.
It was very confusing for Tony, to say the least. He was confused as to why Steve might think that he's not loving him. He's told the man he loves him, has come to grips that he finally loves someone after the whole Pepper fiasco, and he's even showing it. But why would Steve think anything different?
"You planned to take me here even before you asked me to hang out with you, didn't you?"
He opened his mouth to say his thanks, but then closed it shortly after. He clenched his jaw and looked towards the ground, keeping his gaze off of everyone.
"Alright, I'm going, Captain Angrypants." The genius rolled his eyes and proceeded to exit Steve's room, closing the door behind him. The blonde let out a relieved sigh, dropping the towel from around his waist and putting his boxer briefs on, climbing into bed shortly after. He closed his eyes in an attempt to get some sleep, but the night seemed to drag on slowly for him. Ironic, isn't it? Everything around him moves too fast, and now he's complaining about something moving too slow. He sighs in his sleep and squeezes his eyes tighter, willing himself to fall asleep.
And needless to say, he hated it. He didn't hate the therapy himself, because he knew he needed it to try and talk again. But it didn't stop the self-hatred. It was horrible for him to say the least; every word they made him say was putting strain on his voice because every word started, or ended with a stutter. It made him shut himself off more than he already was, making it so he didn't want to try anymore.
"So, Uhm... Did you have fun chatting with those two?" He speaks quietly. He doesn't think much of it, and just simply offers a nod. "That's good, I'm glad you're comfortable speaking to others that aren't me." And now he's confused because it sounds like Tony is just a bit furious with him, if not just a little bit annoyed. Why would Tony be mad at him, he didn't really do anything wrong.
"Are you sure you wanna know, Tony?" The genius nodded his head and Bruce slowly listed off what was wrong with him. "He has a small concussion, his skin is raw at his wrist, bite marks on his neck and lacerations to his abdomen. But as I said Tony, we can only see the physical, we don't know the mental damage these things have caused."
"Well, I don't mind enjoying moments like this and being yours exclusively, talking is nice, too. But you know I'm shit at dating, right?" Steve chuckled and shook his head, his nose rubbing against Tony's a little, causing the brunette to giggle.
"Can we stay like this forever?" And Steve smiled in response, kissing his forehead and looking at Tony with so much love in his eyes.
"What mission?" Fury questioned. Tony clicked his teeth with his tongue, his foot tapping against the floor of Fury's office, his anger spiking to dangerous levels.
Steve's eyes opened for the second time in the same day. Instead of bright blinding white lights hanging above him, he was met with dense and enormous darkness. It was different; where he could see everything from when he was at S.H.I.E.L.D., which helped him to get a grip on his surroundings, the darkness effectively did the opposite and unnerved him.
"Did you just wake up? Jarvis, why didn't you tell me Steve woke up?"
"Ugh, alright enough of this display of love." And he heard the click of the gun being readied, but he didn't flinch. He kept his eyes on his lover, who was looking at him through teary eyes. He brought his hand up to his lips, kissing his palm just like Tony did before he left, and blew a kiss towards him. Despite his fingers being broken, Tony used both his hands to catch the kiss and bring them close to his heart, smiling brightly. It made Steve smile, and that was honestly the last thing Steve wanted to see before he died. Tony's smile.
Not too sure if I like this chapter if I'm being honest. Eh, I'm not gonna go into detail about why, but I at least hope you like it.
"Is there a reason for calling them that?"
"Hmm?" Tony replies, raising his eyebrows and looking at him.
Tony rubbed away the sleepiness from his eyes, he was too tired to be doing this right now, but he needed to get more information on the situation at hand. He tried his best to keep his eyes open, but it was such a long and exhausting day for the poor genius. He was on a rollercoaster of emotions and it was hard to pinpoint exactly what he was feeling past the drowsiness. Fingers snapped in front of his face and it made him jump, blinking rapidly and looking at Natasha, rubbing his eyes again.
"We didn't ask if anything is going on between you and Steve." The gears inside his head were turning, and somewhere inside his thick skull, there was a clock, slowly ticking away, until he realized what he just said. He groaned and let his head fall onto the table, a small thud erupting from his forehead hitting the table. He sighed loudly and lifted his head, placing his elbow on the table, and his head in his hand.
Warning: this chapter contains suicidal thoughts. If you want to avoid this, then by all means, skip the ending of this chapter. Once again, this chapter contains suicidal thoughts.
"Steve? Please put the gun down." He said slowly and calmly.
He watched as Obadiah stood menacingly over him while he was paralyzed, bleeding from his ears, skin pale and littered with blue veins that were visible on his neck, stopping just on his cheek within proximity to his eyes. He remembers the feelings of helplessness and betrayal, as well as the feeling of creeping death as Obadiah ripped the Arc Reactor out of his chest. He felt a pang of pain from his own chest as if the action from this memory was being reciprocated and felt from his own body. The feeling grew stronger, and he grits his teeth. He clawed at his chest, nails digging into his own skin, tearing his skin as he tried to make the pain go away, tried to find any means to make the pain cease. He lifted his shirt, and he felt like he couldn't breathe.
"For what?" Steve's smile was replaced by a frown, his eyebrows furrowed as his once happy facial expression turned into one of confusion.
"We're gonna win, and we're gonna do it together."
His face flushed with embarrassment, painting his cheeks a tint of red, clearing his throat before he spoke. "Uh... Yeah, sorry, Jarvis. I uh... Want some coffee but I don't know how the machine works." He replied, embarrassment finding its way to affect his speech pattern.
The world around me was dark, lost behind my eyelids that felt as if they weighed a ton. It was a hazy feeling, my mind was clouded with a thick fog of white, any thoughts I had were unable to pierce the veil of what was going on in my mind. My body felt heavy, the pain of the bullet wounds still fresh, but I couldn't will myself to move or respond to the painful aches of my wounds. I could hear the whispers of the wind outside, or was that on the inside? It was hard to tell, my mind was too fuzzy to focus on anything around me. I could still feel the way my hair was matted from my blood that was spilled forth due to Tony. Wait... Tony?
The collar continued to shock him, even as Tony stood up and made his way back over towards the door and left the room, slamming the door behind him in the process. He willed his legs to respond through the pain, bringing his knees close to his chest so that he could rest his head against them, clasping his hands together and putting them on the back of his head, groaning ever so slightly as the pain was starting to become just a little too intense.
After waiting patiently for twelve hours, and then another two hours for them to get Steve situated in the medical ward, the doctors finally gave him the permission he needed to go and see the soldier. And even if they didn't, he would most likely throw a fit and get his way regardless, because he cares a significant amount about the blonde.
"I do." He whispered, in a hushed tone. Tony nodded his head and grabbed his wrist, speeding off towards the left-back of the debriefing room, where the spiral staircase that led towards the underground harbor of Quinjets was stationed.
There was a roar in the distance, and before I knew it I was on a train. It seemed like a normal cargo train by the looks of it, but I knew better than that. I knew what this was, and I hesitated to turn around as I picked up the faint sound of shouting. My hands shook, and with some ounce of courage, I turned my body around.
"You of all people should know that I myself, am not a perfect person, nor would I want someone perfect. I want you, someone who acknowledges he has flaws, but still has a heart to act on them and tries to make himself a better person. Although, you should really stop trying to be a better person because you're already the best you, you can be." Tony swears that despite the fact there was shrapnel in his heart, that the organ itself was jumping for joy, or maybe it felt like that because his heartbeat quickened and he could feel that in his chest. The things Steve said that got the right parts of his body working, it's a miracle that he hasn't just jumped him yet.
As the vehicle took off once they got back and were situated, Tony held Steve close to him, listening to the way his heartbeat was so small and faint, that it scared Tony all the way to his Arc Reactor. He kissed the side of the blonde's head, rocking them back and forth as he whispered sweet nothings into Steve's ear. He sat there, paranoid out of his mind, a million thoughts running rampant in his cranium. The only thought he cared for was whether or not Steve was going to make it out of this alive.
to do anything except sit here. I don't care if it's for an hour, thirty minutes, or even thirty seconds, but you can't stay locked up in this room expecting him to wake up any second."
"It feels good to kiss you again, too." He let go of the underside of Tony's knees, and the brunette climbed down off of him, sitting back down on his stool and opening the bag that contained two wrapped burgers inside. "I brought you back something to eat, considering I'm sure you haven't eaten yet."
As he inches closer towards the staircase to the left that will lead him downwards to the platform where his helicopter was last permitted to park, he fires the two shock missiles, watching as they silently whizz through the air. The missiles explode on impact, a small puff cloud that crackles with electricity forms in front of their face and they convulse for a minute, collapsing onto the floor in the next second.
"Can you two argue some other time? Kinda trying to go unnoticed here." Clint spoke.
"It can't be that bad." And for once it felt like everything was okay- that he and Tony were going to be fine. They were talking, they were communicating, that was good! It was as normal as they were going to get at the moment while everything was hectic around him. But for now, he was just going to enjoy hearing Tony's talking to him, joking with him, voice so full of care and concern. It was enjoyable.
"Thank you." He whispered, swallowing the lump in his throat as he tried talking again. "Thank you, for saving him. It means the world to me."
He can see the door coming into his vision, and he quickens his steps. But he abruptly stops as he hears a loud bang go off inside the room, followed by a body hitting the floor. His heart drops, his hand trembles and a cold wind washes over his body, littering his body with goosebumps underneath his clothes. His hands shake violently as he grabs the doorknob, twisting it open.
He turned to look at the progress bar on the holographic screen to his left. The bar reached the end, a green checkmark appearing before him, and another screen popping up shortly after. However, instead of being met with mission credentials, a red box appeared with the words "CLASSIFIED" appeared right before his eyes. He tsked to himself and started typing away on the keyboard to try and get past the firewall that was holding back crucial data.
"Why would Hydra have access to S.H.I.E.L.D. equipment, that makes no sense?"
Leave it to Bruce to make it hard for him to not spill the beans, hell, it was even harder for him to not spill the beans with Pepper here. Normally he would be able to just give off a small lie to his science bro and he would believe him, no more questions would be asked and they could get on with their day. With Pepper here, there was no way he would be able to lie his way out of this because she knew him on a deeply personal level. She knew everything about him and could easily see right through his lies if he ever tried to tell them. Hell, she even knew when he was trying to avoid a topic; just like how he was trying to avoid this topic and she figured that out instantly. She also knew when he would try to deflect, and all his other defense mechanisms. So regardless, he was fucked no matter what.
"You should get outside now, we found some tracks in the show. Two sets of feet, we think someone has Steve." As soon as he heard his soldier's name, he wasted no time in turning back and traversing the inside of the building, finding his way to the outside where he met up with Nat and Thor.
"Well, I don't feel lonely when I'm around you. It's weird, because usually when I'm around the others I feel..." He trailed off, at a loss for words on how to accurately describe how he feels.
"Tony I'm going down!" He panicked. The rumbling slowly turned into groaning, the Quinjet no longer able to be stabilized in the air, and it dipped downwards. The sides scraped against the thick barks of the mighty Oak trees, pushing, damaging the Quinjet as it made its descent towards the ground. And he only panicked more, memory fragments of his past flashing before his eyes once more.
He won't cut Steve out of his life, he'll be there every second for as much, and as long as he can. If he has to stay up every night to make sure the soldier is ok, then by God he will do just that. He will continue to love him through this period of what might be the worst thing to happen to Steve, because to the genius, while the Quinjet crashing and putting him here should realistically be the worse thing to happen to Steve, or even the plane crash that cost him seven decades of his life, the possibility of not being able to speak, not being able to see properly and draw is what truly terrifies him.
It was more casual than fancy, and Steve adored that on Tony. The only fancy thing about him was the black-tie that went with his AC/DC shirt, which was partially covered by his brown jacket, with black jeans to match. And how exactly did Steve look? A blue flannel with the sleeves curled up to his elbows, tucked into his brown slacks. He must've been standing there staring at the genius for too long, considering the man was standing there chuckling at him.
" Ross sneered. He remained silent, because truthfully what was there to say? Words had no meaning here, they wouldn't listen, nobody here cared really. He wouldn't beg, nor plead for his life, it was already gone. He wouldn't whimper and cry, because he's accepted death at this point. Granted, he accepted death first when he sacrificed himself to save millions, but at this point hope is just a word that emerged from its cocoon, grew beautiful, colorful wings, and flew away like a butterfly, hoping to come into contact with a flower, or in this case a person, who it could spread its hope to.
"Tony."
"He's awake right now, but as a fair warning, he might be out of it until the morphine wears off. Other than that, once he's fully regained his senses he's free to go." He smiled and thanked the doctor, who nodded in return and walked away shortly after. He let out a small breath of air, placing his hand on one of the wooden doors and gently pushing it open.
"The Triskelion," Natasha spoke, "but that's all the way in Washington D.C. Why would they go there?"
"I-I have to go and h-help h-him." He removed his hands from his face and stood up straight, turning around to look at T'Challa. "Can y-you help me?"
"For goodness sake, watch your language!" He teased. The soldier rolled his eyes and blushed a little more.
"I told you my name is Tony! God, and of course you're apologizing, why wouldn't you. Fucking hell I wish they never found you or thawed you out, would've been better off without you." His eyes widened as he realized what he just said. He didn't mean that, of course, he didn't mean it, he was just angry, but the way the blonde's eyes turned a shade darker, losing their bright glow, he knew he fucked up. "Steve, I didn't-"
"Hey, no," Tony growled, "you don't get to say that. They
"When you get inside the building, do everything you can to make sure it's safe. Once you're done with that, head to the top and we'll meet you there." A quick nod of Tony's head had the Captain leaning forward, placing a gentle, and carefully slow kiss on Tony's lips before he pulled back. "You can do this Tony, I believe in you."
In those three weeks as well, the two males have been getting a bit more touchy-feely, and it excited Tony. He felt as if Steve was getting more comfortable and warming up to the idea of having sex with him, but he wouldn't get his hopes up. They weren't officially dating yet, and Steve seemed like the kind of guy who would wait till marriage to do that kinda stuff. Well, maybe not considering the guy almost showed Tony his dick pretty early, but maybe that was more for the experience than anything. Also, the thought of marriage sent a shiver down Tony's spine, cause not only was that a major commitment but no sex till marriage? It sounded like torture to Tony, but if that's what it took, maybe he'd be willing to wait that long.
"I'm sorry," Steve whispered again, "for being weak... I'm sorry for being captured, and for not... Being stronger." His voice quivered, tears blurring his vision as he paused.
The walk towards the Wakandan facility was just as long as he remembers it, and it actually was quite amusing to him hearing Tony complain about how tedious and exhausting it was, and why the agents who flew them here didn't just land closer. Which actually was a good question and would have been a lot easier. Regardless, they made it to their destination. It was T'Challa who greeted them, as per usual of the king of Wakanda; always so humble and kind, spoke with true kingly ship and modesty, as well as understanding. He was glad to know T'Challa and was glad the king assured him that the therapy would be of great help to him.
"Shit." He swore. Seems like the teasing has affected him more than he thought it did. He regained his composure and with as much strength as he could muster into his legs, he headed out of his lab and back to his room to prepare for dinner with Steve tonight.
"It's ok babe, I'm right here. I'm right here with you, you're gonna be ok." The soldier held him tighter, but not too tight so that he might hurt Tony, but just tight enough so that he could hold Tony closer to his body. "Shh, it's ok. What happened? Where's Wanda?"
the one who's been avoiding him this entire time, the one who's been staying in Shuri's lab every single day, and never bothering to check up on how he's doing, or bother waiting for him after every therapy session. But he just stands there and takes it, because he can't use his voice to communicate how he's feeling.
"What about when he left for his mission?"
"I'm glad to be back. Certainly beats running around and night chasing a ghost and sitting around for hours. Right now I just want a hot shower and to relax."
"Oh please, Rogers. Did you actually think he cared about you? He brought you here the first time, and he brought you here the second time to meet your end. How else do you think I knew you were at the compound? He played you, Rogers. And you couldn't see past any of that."
And Steve accepts it because even if Tony hurt him in the worst way possible, he loves this man and forgives him for all his mistakes. He doesn't hold a grudge against him for what he's done, because he's just a human-like him, and he loves Tony for who he is. So, he kisses him back just as passionately, missing moments like these, missing the genius's lips against his, missing the way his tongue would try to fight for dominance with his own, missing the way he held him so close like he was afraid to lose him. He missed it all, and it might be stupid of him to forgive and forget, but after being denied the privilege of holding, and kissing the man he loves, he wants to live in this moment once more.
He swallowed the lump in his throat and let out a shaky breath. He got through delivering the news, but it was so damaging to see the distressed look on Steve's face. "I'm sorry." The genius whispered, hanging his head low.
He let out a huff of breath and looked at the Black Widow, who simply rolled her eyes at him when she saw the smile on his face.
He slept through the night happily, his body relaxed, mind at ease, and under the ever-watchful, ever keen eye of Tony Stark.
"I'm sorry, too. God, I'm so fucking sorry, Steve." He swears, and that's completely fine with the soldier. He doesn't need to say "language" to lighten the mood, because he's already enjoying the warm embrace of the man he loves. He's craved this for so long, and even if he might be close to his death bed, what with all the blood he knows he's losing, he's going to savor this for as long as he can, because he's done running. He's right where he wants to be. In Tony's loving embrace, in his arms, that wrap around his stature so perfectly that only the genius knows where to put his hands, and where he likes the genius to put them. And as he looks into those mesmerizing eyes does he have the courage to speak his mind on what he has truly been wanting all this time.
He turned around at the sound of Steve calling his name. "Yeah?"
Steve's words echo in his mind. Was he thinking these thoughts, or was it the mind stone making him remember his choice words. He wasn't even sure if he had control of his own mind at this point, and it was a scary thought as more words echoed in his mind shortly after.
"I love you so much, honey. I want you to make love to me, please?" He was at a loss for words, something unusual for the brunette. What could he possibly say at this moment, there was just space where a sentence should be forming inside of his head.
"No problem, Cap. Now, how about we get out of here and take a walk through the park before going home."
"Alright, Rogers. Just take a deep breath, calm down. Tony likes you, it'll be ok." He said to himself. It was a small pep talk, but it effectively did help him to calm down.
Those words echoed around in his mind, and it absolutely petrified him. A world without Steve was a cold world for him, one he is not willing to live in. The soldier is his life, and he's not exaggerating that. Once Pepper had left his life, things never became easier for him as he didn't have anybody around to look after him, or they just didn't care. But Steve went above and beyond to care for broken genius, making him want to be a better person. He couldn't lose Steve now, not after all they've been through. Not after all the missions, not after all the stolen moments that he holds dear and so close to his heart, not after Steve had trusted him to keep him safe after betraying him. He's
"Thanks for the pep talk, Cap. I better have a reward after all of this is over." Steve snorted in response.
When they finished their meals, Steve took the initiative to clean up after them, washing the plates, drying them, and putting them away. It was a little funny for Tony to watch, considering the soldier would always prefer to do things the old-fashioned way instead of the modern way.
"I thought it was weird I saw you. It's like you weren't yourself, and then suddenly you attacked me. I think they take on the forms of people we care the most about, making it hard for us to fight back. Then when our guard is down, heh, well ya get mauled." He sighed heavily and let his head look towards the side at Natasha, taking in every one of her bruises. "They really fucked you up, huh?"
shouldn't be classified. If that were the case, then Tony would have already had the data present for him to relay to the others.
God, he was so pissed off right now at both of them. His life was not a joke for some people,
"Oh my god, and you got my coffee correct. How did you know how I like my coffee?"
"Good boy. I knew you could do it. Come on Wanda, it's over." I heard his footsteps retreat from me, my eyes too focused on the way my hands had a mind of their own, dragging the scalpel across my wrist over and over, watching my skin tear, letting my own blood drip onto the floor, mixing with the water that still resided around me. I saw specs of black dancing before me, the room was spinning, and I could feel my breath slowly slip away.
He's beautiful in his own way, and there's nothing he would change about Tony's character. He loves how he forgets to eat and sleep because that's more of a reason for him to care for the genius and bring him food that he's cooked, or going to Burger King and bringing him a cheeseburger. He loves the snarky comments that really annoy him because he knows Tony has his own view on things that potentially make him question his own logic, but typically they try not to go too far. Tony is understanding in that department; he understands that he was at the time still trying to adjust, and he helped him remember the world, even if everything has changed. He loves the man through all his insecurities and nightmares because just like him, he has his own. Tony is beautiful to him, inside and out.
I wanted to ask you guys something important. Would you rather I: Upload the rest of the chapters so that way you can read the entirety of this story at your own pace up until the end- meaning, just upload the other nine chapters. Or: would you rather I keep the uploads as they are now- meaning, just upload the next chapter as I see fit, rather than posting all the chapters. Which would you guys rather have? Would you like me to keep it as if where I upload whenever I see fit that I should publish the next chapter, meaning you guys get to see it unfold. Or would you rather just be handed all the chapters?
He was worried about Tony; and truthfully he doesn't think he'll ever get tired of being worried about the genius, because he cares so much about him. He lets his head rest against the back of his seat, staring out the window, watching the trees zoom past in front of him, while he just thought about whether or not Tony was going to be ok. He had hoped the Iron Man made it out alive because frankly, there's still so much he needs to tell him, so much that has been left unsaid and they need to talk about. He wouldn't forgive himself if Tony died because of him, hell, he actually almost did kill Tony back in Siberia, and the memory still haunts him.
Before he got situated in his room, he just so happened to pass by the science department inside the facility, and he remembers Tony inside talking with T'Challa's sister, Shuri. It was nice to see Tony laughing, and mingling with someone else that wasn't him. But he also wishes it was him, but he's denied that privilege until he can speak properly again. And the worst part about it is that he knows Tony will do everything he can to make this better. He'll forgo all food and water, settling only for coffee until he can revolutionize something that will help him with his speech impediment and his blurry vision, and it kills him inside, knowing that science cannot fix what's wrong with him.
"Uh... Hey there, Spangles." Of
"You think you can deal with most of those assholes inside," he asked, his eyes focused on the top of the Triskelion where a weird, bright yellow light was being emitted, "I think I have somewhere more important to be."
"Enjoying the sight in front of me." In all of Tony's life, he has never gotten embarrassed at all because, well, Tony Stark doesn't get embarrassed, but holy shit does Steve make everything he's worked towards building up inside of himself just change. Not only did he feel his lips curl into a big smile, but he also felt the presence of heat on his cheeks. He coughed a little bit and placed his hand over his mouth to hide his smile, but the soldier was already smiling in response at seeing the gesture that warmed his heart.
"How?"
"Feel good?"
So at the moment, it was easy to feel nothing, not even a sliver of what he used to feel for Steve. He just stared at the screen in front of him, watching the soldier writhe in pain, his body shuddering as he turned the frequency of the shock collar up more, just wanting to hear Steve complain once. He wanted him to understand exactly how he felt; how much pain and anguish he put him through, how he was unable to sleep at night because of what he had done to him.
"Well spit it out! I don't have all day to sit on my ass when I could be trying to find Steve right now."
"For letting me stay down here. I... I've never really slept this well before."
"You're holding hands and Cap just kissed the back of it. So I wanna know, did you ask Cap out, or did Cap ask you out?"
"You should get something to eat, Tony. Maybe some coffee will help." Bruce advised. His eyes slowly moved from Steve's damaged form to Bruce, who put his hands up in surrender when he saw how cold and dead the geniuses' eyes were. "I'm not trying to force you to do anything, Tony. But sitting there might not be the healthiest option."
"From what you've induced, Mr. Stark, then these extraterrestrials are far superior and highly dangerous. With our best agents and soldier's out at the moment if they are still alive-"
"Ooh, fuck!!" Tony yelled, closing his eyes and gritting his teeth in pain. Holy shit Steve was stretching him out badly, even after he prepped him too. "Don't you dare pull all the way out." He warned the soldier. He felt the blonde stay still, stopping himself from pulling out all the way. Tony opened one of his eyes, gazing into concerned blue ones. "Ok, ok... You can move now." He said after he got adjusted. Steve intertwined their fingers before he slowly pushed back in. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve's neck, his legs finding their place around his waist, his head burrowed into his shoulder. The pain slowly started to turn into pleasure as Steve continued to bury himself inside Tony, a moan laced with pleasure hitting his ear as the super-soldier buried his entire length inside of him.
Regardless, his dreams feel more like a way to play with his emotions rather than soothe them. Whether the dreams are sexual, or tame, the mind always has a certain way of either playing with the brain or giving it contentment. Right now, he feels like his mind is being played with and it's far worse than the beatings and bullet wounds he received from Ross and his guards. It's worse than the whole Siberia situation, the whole "Civil War", as people call it, that tore apart the Avengers. They were bad, don't get him wrong, but nothing can compare to the feeling of wanting to see your loved one, but finding out they're no longer there.
"Do you want me to answer that?" Fury rolled his eye at Tony's sass, choosing to ignore it. "Still, that doesn't make any sense. The mission details specified that it
He never thought that upon arriving here, wherever
"Can you hack into S.H.I.E.L.D. and get me the reports on this mission?" He asked
"Yeah? What is it J?"
"How many times have you had nightmares?" He looked at Steve, who stared back at him. His once-prominent smile that was etched into his face, was replaced by a stoic expression, his lips flattened into a straight line.
She saw how disheveled he looked; from his messy unkempt hair to the dark bags under his eyes, followed by his red and puffy eyes and pale skin. He looked worse for wear, and it was absolutely bad.
"Yes, you did. According to what you've shared with the rest of us, we know that they disguise themselves as the thing we care about the most, getting inside our head and letting our guard down. When the opportunity presents itself, they attack."
"Here, take this," Fury said, giving him a security passcard, "that card will give you access to the security room, and whatever room you need to enter to get that genius mind of yours working." He took the passcard from Fury and nodded his head, exiting the medical room and making his way down the corridors of S.H.I.E.L.D. towards the security room.
Happiness for what exactly? That he was having a hard time figuring out. Was he happy that Steve was having a moment of weakness, and that Tony was there to help him? Or was he happy that the super-soldier wanted to be around Tony; which to him was something he didn't expect, truthfully? What he had expected was to just simply get water, give it to Steve, and that would be the end of it. Never in his life would he imagine the blonde to actually
The sight of him putting the plane in the water makes him remember the paralyzing terror creeping up on him, gripping his heart heavily as he remembered himself dip towards the ocean below that contained shards of ice, the only option he had left to save all of New York. He remembers giving up his entire life to saving everybody, and how he was willing to lose his life in return, how
"Look, if you're gonna kill me can you please make it quick."
He sat back in awe as he watched her coil the energy flowing through her into a small ball of scarlet energy, after that, he was completely blown away by the fact that she can fly; not in the way Thor could, but it was more like she propelled herself through the air by shooting energy out of her hands and into the ground to give her the height elevation. Needless to say, Tony was at a loss for words the entire time.
"So, with the information that I gathered and remembering what Steve told me when he called me, I suspect foul play." Fury turned his head to the side to look at Tony with his eye as he continued. "When you mentioned aliens, Steve mentioned that the Hydra agents that they apprehended disappeared; it's as if they were never captured at all, but you see that's the thing, what if when you captured them, they simply escaped, or even more, what if they were called back to be used for a different mission of theirs? What if they gathered intel on them and now they've pulled the trigger."
"Sure, the couch is always there if you ever need it." He motions with his head for him to follow, and like a well-trained puppy, he follows. Tony opens the doors to his lab and leads Steve towards the couch, gesturing with his hand for him to lay down. With shaky feet, he walks across the cold ground towards his destination. He gently eases onto the couch, curling up onto his side, staring at the vast expanse of Tony's lab, taking in all the equipment he's tampered with and upgraded. His eyes start to close as he loses the strength to keep them open, fatigue taking over. He vaguely felt the presence of a blanket being placed on him as he drifted off into another attempt into a peaceful slumber, only this time, the nightmares never came.
"Would you like to get some water and relax? You look like you've been through a lot."
When did he ever have the time to tell Tony about his parent's death while he was still trying to clear Bucky's name? Everybody thought it was Bucky who bombed the Conference Hall in the United Nation, but Steve believed otherwise. How could it be that suddenly Bucky would do something like that when he remembered Steve for a fraction of a second? He knew his best friend was in there somewhere, and he wanted to believe that he didn't do this. Of course, he was right, Bucky didn't do it, but while defending his friend he learned dark secrets that he had to keep to himself.
It's a fickle thing, really; people either live without it, whether they're starved of it from parents, or a loved one, or simply because it's their own personal choice and a way of life to stay away from being so close to another person, and some crave it like a drug. Essentially that's what some consider love; a drug you end up addicted to, maybe like cocaine or heroin, but not as extreme and only leaves you with a broken heart rather than dead in the ground.
"You love me, right?" This time he spoke sweetly, a hint of a smile in his voice. I looked at him through teary eyes, my head resting against the chair as a sob racked my body.
"Please... Stop." I whispered again.
that Steve wouldn't do that a second time, but he's scared. Scared of losing him, scared of bad things happening to him, scared of many things he actually doesn't like talking about, but with Steve, he's the most scared he's ever been. Regardless of him being scared, what he did was stupid, and he should have at the very least tried to make time for Steve, even if what he had in mind with staying in the lab for five days was with good intentions.
"And what exactly is that?" Steve raised his eyebrow, a smirk on his face.
"You're so cute."
"Alright, who's cooking?" Tony announced his presence in the form of a question upon his arrival. He looked over at the stove and saw Natasha, a plate full of eggs and pancakes, accompanied by a small glass of orange juice resting next to her as she busied herself with cooking the bacon in the pan. Behind her were Bruce, Wanda, and Clint, their plates mirroring the one next to her, but they were already digging into their food.
"It's just... I want to know what happened after our connection got cut? Jarivs told me an EMP took out the commlinks, so now I'm just left with the knowledge I gathered, with a lot of missing parts in between. So can you fill me in?"
"What did you do?" He asked. It wasn't laced with venom, it wasn't an angry statement, it was a genuine question, but it still left this sick twisted knot in his stomach, like he just knew what she was going to tell him. He watched her hesitate, refusing to meet his eyes as she looked anywhere except at him.
"It has been a minute since the last time you asked." His AI replied.
More than that, however, he wanted Steve to suffer, which is why he did what he did. He made Steve come over under pretense, only for him to have gotten locked up. The fucked up part about it all, besides the fact that he knew he betrayed Steve and saw the destroyed look in his eyes, was that he actually
"But what if he gets hurt? I'm not there to make sure he doesn't get himself into trouble. He's a super-soldier who doesn't like bullies, and nobody is a bigger bully than Hydra."
"That I am not sure of either. However, if they were able to get their hands on some of our weapons, then they might have infiltrated HQ disguised as someone else."
"Shut up!" The soldier yelled, his voice a little shaky.
"She was different, she loved me way before I became Captain America. Now she's gone, along with everybody else because I was stupid enough to kill myself to save the entire world."
"Tony, please listen to me." The line was silent, and he took it as his queue to continue. "Both wings are down, and I'm heading towards the ground. I'm sorry, Tony. This is the end of the line for me."
He finds himself not in his room, but rather in the communal area of the facility. He doesn't want to be alone in his room, there's nothing to do or to see in there. However, instead of finding himself alone, he sees two figures. While his right eye sees nothing but blurry outlines and figures, his left eye sees blonde hair and brown hair. The voices, however, are very familiar to him. He takes the first step down the small set of stairs, one at a time. He stumbles and loses his balance a bit, thanks to the difficulty of vision he has, and he lets out an agitated sigh.
His body felt light, also numb-like. It reminded him of the time he crashed the plane in the ice; cold water rushing in where the windshield of the plane broke, his body flung to somewhere in the plane as he could feel the water capture him, holding onto him, clinging and coiling. It was almost like the water was like shackles, wrapping around his wrist, his throat, his legs, his body, chaining him so he couldn't escape, capturing him and trapping him in a watery grave. And now, just like back then, he accepted death once more, incoherent whispering in his ear as he felt his body relax. The only thing on his mind, just like how back then Peggy was on his mind before he crashed the plane, was Tony. Because even if Tony betrayed Steve, deep down-
"I really don't wanna deal with him right now, or anybody else who came with him." He grumbled.
"Friday, call Fury quickly."
"You really mean that?" Oh shit, did he just say that out loud? "Yes, yes you did." Fuck, he didn't mean to, but oh whale the cat was out of the bag. He waited for Steve to stop his fit of laughter before he spoke.
"Well, no they're-"
It was surreal to think that they've come so far; from practically betraying each other, watching the other die and go through immense pain, to finally getting together and living under the Avengers Compound once more. It was nice to see a familiar place that he's missed more than anything, and he wouldn't be lying if he said he was shocked that the government even let him back on New York soil.
"Cap! Cap, please answer me!" He pleaded. There was no answer, just pure static coming into his ear. He grits his teeth, first in anger, then in anguish. His eyes wouldn't leave the destroyed vehicle the others used to get here, because that's where Steve was, that's where his team was, and he watched as they fell to their doom.
"I found him out in the hall outside of his door, sitting there with his head against the wall, eyes closed and the ghostly trails of tears staining his cheeks. I tried to ask him what happened and if he was ok, and he just told me to go away." Fuck, he really must've damaged him more than he thought. All because of his unresolved daddy issues and pent-up anger from it. He let out a sigh which didn't go unnoticed by Natasha. "So I'm guessing you did do something?"
He heard footsteps coming towards his cell, and he didn't bother looking up anyways. It was probably either the guards or Ross himself, coming to gloat at the fact he has him all locked up in here like a caged animal, slowly accepting its death. Eventually, the footsteps stopped in front of his cell, and he just waited there patiently for them to speak.
have, in his own mind, done more for him, which the genius was beating himself up over. He sighed and looked down before continuing to speak. "I'm sorry for not protecting you. I'm sorry that I let all of this crap happen to you. I'm sorry that I wasn't... Good enough to do anything to prevent this from happening to you."
pace. I'm willing to wait as long as I need to until you're comfortable in our relationship, and until you can trust me again."
"Tony," the soldier's blush deepened at the geniuses' words, causing the brunette to chuckle lightly, "maybe some other time, right now I just wanna fall asleep with you."
"You assume we failed?" It raised its eyebrows in response. "Who's to say we didn't want him to escape? Who's to say we didn't want your little spy buddies to escape too, and have them lead you on this wild goose chase. What if those closest to you aren't what they seem to be? Maybe we're destroying you from the inside, and you're too blind to see it."
, everything he's given me and I can't leave this room until he wakes up. I want to
"I guess while I'm literally tired, your body seems to want to go for round 2; which I'm not opposed to, by the way. Just let me catch my breath first." He looked down and shook his head, his erection already back up thanks to the serum. It was embarrassing, to say the least, but the kiss on his lips that came from his genius told him that Tony didn't mind; and really he didn't mind, because as they shared their intimate moment again, their names being spilled forth out of love from the other's mouth, it wasn't just an act of sexual frustration, nor did it come from wanting to just have sex, no, it was an act of lovemaking, and it was a special night for our two heroes.
"Turn around, and I'll blow your brains out right in front of him." The cold, deep voice of Ross spoke. He kept his eyes on Tony, focusing only on him in this situation. Regardless of what happens to him, whether he dies or not, Natasha and Bucky will get Tony out of here. "I must say, I didn't think you'd come here so quickly, but then again it makes perfect sense when this one won't shut up about you." And he knew the man was talking about Tony, and it brought back the rage he felt when he saw what Ross did to his fingers.
easy, did you?"
Now, what did he have, if he had to ask himself? A job stuck as a field agent, a borderline guinea pig for SHIELD to use whenever, anger, guilt, regret, heartache. He took a deep breath to calm his nerves, desperately trying to stop the whirlwind of emotions fighting for control over his body. He thought of the good things he had. He had a team, who graciously made him their captain, he had a place to stay, once again surrounded by people who cared about each other and-
He taught himself how to be strong; because all his life that's what he needed to do. He needed to be strong when he lost Bucky, or when he had to put the plane in the water. He had to be strong when Tony risked his life to put that nuke into the wormhole, or when Peggy died. He had to be strong when Tony betrayed him, basically leaving him to die at the hands of Ross. For lack of a better term, it was fucked up.
a reconnaissance mission, but after I decrypted it, the rest of the information was brought forth. So, if what you say is true, then who else would have access to sending them wherever the fuck they went?"
," he said harshly, causing the blonde to flinch a little at his sudden flare of anger, "it has never been Anthony, and it will
"Captain," a deep, accented voice called out to him, which belonged to none other than the King of Wakanda himself, T'Challa. "You appear to be deep in thought, are you alright?"
"Is that... Normal?" He followed the direction Steves' finger was pointed in, locating a couple walking by, hand in hand, however, this wasn't your typical male and female couple, no, this was a same-sex couple-,two men holding hands and happily talking to each other.
"S-Steve!?" Tony yelled, shakily. He jogged his way over towards the cell that he remembers seeing the genius inhabit. Once he got there, he could faintly see the genius looking out of the cell, and as he looked, he could definitely see Tony shaking violently from this closeup, along with a few strangled sobs scaping past his throat and out his mouth.
"Hey there, sugar bear."
I felt tears cloud my vision as I stared at myself and Bucky, my best friend, hanging off the side of the train, his hands just barely gripping the railing to keep himself from falling. I watched myself reach forward, trying to get him to grab my hand, trying to save him with every ounce of power I had coursing through my body from the serum. I remember the feeling of my heart hammering in my chest as I tried my best to save him, I remember the sudden drop of fear as I watched the bar snap, I remember the guilt coiling inside my chest as I watched my best friend plummet to his death. Even after I got the serum, after literally becoming the peak perfection of a human body, I was still weak.
"Sir," his AI said, breaking him out of his thoughts.
"Yes, sir," they spoke in unison.
He smiled and got off his stool, walking over towards the computers that were located near the couch, just a few feet in front of it. As he sat down in his rolling chair, he clapped his hands and two holographic screens appeared in the air. One screen was a direct communication link to the other's, the other one was of JARVIS hacking into S.H.I.E.L.D. 's files, some smaller screens appearing showing the AI's progress.
"I hope I'm n-not late." He says, causing the genius to look up at him.
Whenever Tony was in his lab, there was never a dull moment. Whether it was working on upgrades for the teams' suits, fixing up the Iron Man suit after it was horribly damaged thanks to some asshole supervillain, or scolding Dum-E for messing with, and touching, which leads to breaking, something he wasn't supposed to. Needless to say, Tony's fast thinking brain, fitted for the most complex of situations, was always preoccupied, but also, always on the move.
While he waited for the call to go through, he had to try and move Steve so when medics came it would be easier for them to transport him. There was just... So much blood. He doesn't have hemophobia, it's just the fact that it's
"I got you." He whispered gently. The same words he'd always tell Steve whenever Tony needed to comfort him after a nightmare. And just like always, the soldier's body relaxed. He didn't stir, nor whimper, nor call out Tony's name in a broken, scared voice, he just relaxed and looked absolutely peaceful- beautiful, even, and that's what Tony loved about him.
The air turns chilly, invisible wisps of air coiling around his body, tickling every inch of his skin. He shivers, body trembling as sweat continues to form, tiny whimpers turning into cries of agony, the air in the room feels thicker the more his eyes are closed. He can't breathe for a fraction of a second, oxygen foreign to him as he lays there gasping, clawing at an invisible force, wanting to be saved. His eyes snap open, and he notices that he's not the only one in the room. Scared, quivering blue eyes took a gander into concerned brown eyes, a hand on his shoulder the only form of skin-to-skin contact that is soothing to him. He feels like he can breathe again, but he feels paralyzed as he lays there.
"Hey there yourself. Something on your mind there, Cap?"
"Well you see, secretary asshole, I actually have a better proposition for you." He tapped his chest once, and the nanoreactor activated, encasing his body with the familiar hues of gold and red, with a touch of blue in the mix. "You go through me first."
got the pleasure rolling down his spine and towards his already painfully stiff erection.
He thought. He then realized that he was in his room, laying down on his own bed. "Good morning, Jarvis." He said as he sat up. "What time is it?"
"Yes, please." He said softly. It would hopefully help to have some form of human interaction, and most importantly, it might help to gradually talk to someone about his feelings. He was never really good at talking about his feelings, Steve knows that very well, but gradually over time he's learned that it's ok to share your feelings, but that doesn't stop him from being uncomfortable and slightly sarcastic about it.
"You are most welcome."
"Nat, come on... Just, stop- Romanoff!" He yelled at her, shaking her slightly, stopping her squirming. Her greyish green eyes laced with fear stared into his trembling brown ones. He felt her arms wrap around him, and he stiffened for a few seconds at the contact. It was... Uncomfortable to see her show any form of fear when she had such a tight lid on her emotions. Whatever had done this to her and Barton, must've messed her up badly.
"Hmm, I don't know," he started, looking towards the ceiling as he continued to speak, "I'm pretty busy actually; I have upgrades I gotta work on, as well as get food and water since a certain super soldier is always pestering me about that sort of thing. Then I have to go shower and grab some coffee so I can get back to working on my upgrades-".
"I... I told you I loved you, and you just..."
"I'm not gonna do anything to your finger, if that's what you're worried about. I need you to let the machine scan your fingerprint so you can place the mug under the nozzle, let it scan your fingerprint, and make your coffee." He motioned for his finger again, and Steve held out his pointer finger to the genius. He placed the soldier's finger on the side of the machine, watching as a small blue light lit up under his fingertip, disappearing a few seconds later, and listening to the satisfying sound of liquid filling an empty mug.
"JARVIS had to help me with that one. Took a while to figure out the coffee maker since it wasn't my order, but I'm glad I got it right."
I'm here exactly."
He brought the tip of the bottle to his lips, savoring how refreshing the water was to his parched throat. He let out a content sigh and offered to buy her a drink from the vending machine, but she politely declined. He didn't push it and instead decided on sparking a conversation with her as they walked around S.H.I.E.L.D. for a little bit to clear his mind.
"What do you mean?" He asked, looking at Bruce.
"Just wondering if you're free later. I have something in mind if you're up for it." He didn't have any plans for later in the day, but it was hard to voice his answer when he focused in on the way the soldier's hands were sliding up and down his hip ever so slowly, fingers dipping a little bit into the helm of his boxers.
"Sorry to interrupt, but I think Barton just gave us a hint at how these things operate." Fury said.
But he couldn't do a thing about it. So, he sat there through the rest of the day, and all through the night, crying, screaming in anguish, wishing that just for a moment, Tony cared enough to come to visit him and tell him he was sorry, but he knew he wasn't going to get that wish. He was all alone in this, and that's what killed him that night.
"Of course. You're also my favorite person, too."
Somehow we made it outside, I didn't know how as I was barely conscious, but the feeling of snow falling from the sky, and the small crunch of snow under my feet was the last thing I remember before I collapsed.
"I love you, too, T-Tony." The genius smiled in return.
"No, it was just covered with snow when we first got here," Nat responded.
"It's ok, I don't mind really. I would probably react the same way." She had a hint of an accent, but it wasn't that thick or heavy. He slowly started to lift himself away from the trash bin, her hand supporting his back and her other on his shoulder. "Are you alright now?"
"Y-yeah I'm alright, I-I just..." He trailed off, furrowing his eyebrows and scowling.
"I fucked up," he started, he gave a nervous chuckle before continuing, "I took you out today, and made you genuinely happy. Then I had to be an asshole, like my father, and practically ruin it. You didn't deserve that... You just asked a simple question and I took my daddy issues, all my anger out on you. If you still want to hear about my father, then I'll tell you. Is that what you want?" He looked to the side, and his eyes widened. He felt as if his heart was being squeezed by someone's hand, or the shrapnel was cutting up the inside of his heart, whatever it was, it rocked him to his core to see the dark blue eyes, those once so sweet bright blue eyes full of life, reduced to a dull, glass shattering gaze he was looking at. It made his eyes tremble, and it made it harder to breathe as he kept staring.
"We know what they are, and we know their intentions." Fury spoke calmly.
"Glad to hear that, these are the best burgers this side of New York. It's good to have you back, sugar bear."
"Thanks." He whispered.
"What did that thing want with you anyway?" Bruce asked.
Take for example a car, given to you by your parents. Was it free? Of course, it was free for you, because you didn't have to pay a single penny for it. For your parents, they had to pay so much for it. So are things truly given for free without consequence, because while it may not be a consequence for you, it could be for someone else.
"I'm glad you could make it, Mr. Stark. I'm certain you're in the right state of mind before I let you in?" Fury spoke calmly.
"Yeah. Something like that. You explained it better than I could have."
"What have you done to me, Rogers?" He whispered to himself. He dropped the screwdriver and placed his head in his hands, letting a shaky breath wrack his body. He felt so disempowered with his emotions, hate and love colliding like fire and ice, a chemical mixture that could produce something beautiful, but if not tamed properly could be catastrophic. He needed to control his thoughts, his feelings, and his actions around Steve, because he will not have his heartbroken by this man a second time, nor will he feel discontented due to what Steve has done.
"Anthony."
"Yeah?"
"Come on, Shellhead, we got a fight to win." Tony happily took Steve's hand in his, the smile on his face only increasing with each loving gesture he shared with Steve.
For himself, love is the driving force he has for Tony that will either kill him in the end, or help him renew what he so desperately wanted from the genius; a blossoming, healthy relationship, where he could hold, and tell Tony he loved him on a day to day basis. And it was his love for Tony that kept him from screaming in agony as the collar's intensity rose, and the grip on his hair tightened.
of a time where someone said they thought he hated them. Don't get him wrong, there are things worth him hating, but he had hoped Steve never thought he truly hated him. They had their dispute on the helicarrier, words laced with venom thrown back and forth like a game of dodgeball, trying to take the other out of the game. It was a vicious game, words were said that neither could really take back, but they've come a long way since then, and it kinda hurt to hear those words come out of Steve's mouth.
"I know it's not fair, but Fury said that we all have to be there. There's nothing you can say or do at this point."
"Because I'm scared I'll fuck it up." There was a familiar prickling sensation behind his eyes, and he blinked rapidly to force the tears that threatened to spill back. "I hurt him once because he wanted to know more about my dad, and the stupid daddy issues I had yet to resolved made me mad and say something I regret saying to him. He was so... Destroyed. He told me when I asked him what he wanted, he said he wanted to die, and you wanna know why? It's because of what I said to him. I can't... I won't... I don't want him to get close to me because I don't want to hurt him again. It kills me on the inside."
he's never seen Steve like this before and it's just turning him on even more. But then the soldier stops and places his head against Tony's shoulder, peppering small kisses on the appendage as he continues to leave him pressed against the wall. It's silent for a few minutes- other than the steady breathing of both males.
Love, for example, is given for free but has dangerous consequences. You cherish a person, or for some, you simply tolerate them, and he wonders to himself how Steve can ever tolerate him. He's dangerous in his own way, bound to hurt those he loves the most, the ones who he keeps so close to his heart. It started with Pepper when he disregarded her pleas, her cries for him to stop this whole Iron Man thing. And yet he continued because despite him knowing that maybe, just maybe, she was right that this was an obsession, he couldn't stop. He couldn't stop because if he did he would not be able to protect the things he loved the most; and yet, his own hands can damage the things he loved the most.
"Sir, please do not do anything irrational."
"Hmm? So you're not here to kill me?" He saw the corner of her lips curve upwards, a glint of a sadistic smile on her face before it disappeared.
A flash of scarlet filigree fluttered past my eyesight, and I felt myself slowly slip away. My body relaxed against the chair and the scene before me changed, Tony and Wanda fading away in the background as I looked down at myself. The binds holding me to the chair were gone, and the wounds I suffered seemed to have disappeared as well. I looked up and studied my surroundings, and it suddenly hit me as to where I am.
"That's for Steve." He spat. The creature simply chuckled darkly and smirked, looking Tony dead in the eye.
"No, I know exactly what you meant. I'm sorry my existence causes you such trouble." The elevator door dinged, the doors opening as it stopped on Steves' floor. His heavy footsteps thudded against the interior of the elevator before he made his way out, stopping just outside of the doors. "I'm sorry for living as well. I'm sorry I didn't die when I put the plane down. I wish I wasn't here so I didn't cause you so much trouble."
"What do you mean, Thor?" Steve questioned.
Once again he felt like it was all his fault, and the guilt was settling deep into his bones and coiling around his muscles. He keeps thinking to himself that if he had just done
It's selfish as hell, and he knows that but he's at one of his lowest points yet again, and he can't cope because everything is too hard.
He endured it; suffered through every pain imaginable, even the ones nobody could see that tainted his heart emotionally, the scars that were left behind from years of loss, and grief, and heartache to heartbreak, he continued to remain strong like the soldier he was. But it didn't mean he never felt it. He simply told himself that maybe he deserved this for what he did to Tony; for not telling him about his parents, for not signing the accords, for choosing to save Bucky instead of turning himself in, or listening to Tony so they could work this out. But truthfully, that would be taking all the blame, and it wasn't all his fault.
the grin on Steve's face right now. He turned around, and surprise surprise, he had a big grin plastered on his face, his eyes conveying fake innocence behind them.
"To change the accords, we thought it would be best to appeal to the people who still consider you and the rest of the Avengers as heroes rather than vigilantes. To do that, we needed the footage of your imprisonment, as well as a digital copy of the accords and on Secretary Ross himself. So, we made a plan to send him to the Raft."
"I do. If I wasn't around then maybe you wouldn't have gotten to know more about me, and I wouldn't have asked to know more about you. It's ok, really. Nobody cares about Steve Rogers, only Captain America. Some might even say they're two different people, but who am I kidding? Nobody would say that."
"Don't worry your pretty little head on that one, he loves you. Everything will go as planned." He smiled and slipped on his jacket, feeling the cold leather fitting snugly on his frame, completing his outfit. He looked down at himself, taking in his outfit before looking up at Natasha.
"Oh yea, when was the last time you smiled?"
"You see that I don't get," Tony looked at everyone as he spoke, "one of those bastards was just in the security room and had no hesitation in taking me out. So, if they wanted to get to us by doing whatever the fuck they're doing to Steve, why did they have hesitation to just shoot me on sight?"
I just wanted to say, thank you to everyone who stuck around to the end to see this story finished. Thank you all for the comments and kudos you have given, and I hope you enjoy this last chapter of this story.
going through my field agents. If the area they're going to proves to be too dangerous, then we do not send them out. Second of all, do you think I'm that much of an asshole?"
"You see that, right there," he turned around and pointed at her, "that hurts right here," he pointed at his Arc Reactor. She rolled her eyes and shook her head, a small ounce of laughter escaped her. He smiled a little bit and turned to grab his cup, making his way over to sit down at the table.
The dinner table was already set, the food was already done cooking and all that was left was to serve it. He wanted to make something fancy for tonight, but he decided against that and just made something plain and simple. Spaghetti with garlic bread was about as plain and simple as he wanted it to be, he'd do the more fancy stuff later. Or maybe, he should've done it tonight considering today was the day he was going to ask Tony out. Ugh, there was so much going on inside of his head that he almost forgot to take the garlic bread out of the oven, nearly burning it.
"I love you," Steve whispered, thumb brushing over Tony's lips, pulling his bottom lip low enough to see his teeth. He struggled to lean upwards, wanting to feel those lips on his once more. The genius met him halfway, already getting the message. His heart was on fire, but not out of pain because that implies that what's happening right now is hurting him. No, it was a fire of passion, making his heartbeat just a little faster as he enjoyed Steve's soft lips against his, how he enjoyed the way the soldier bit his bottom lip and pulled back at the same time, letting go and watching his bottom lip bounce for a few seconds before becoming still. "So beautiful."
"Do not infect S.H.I.E.L.D. with a virus, please." The genius rolled his eyes.
"I would never miss a call from my favorite soldier, but what's up? Anything exciting happened?"
"That's perfectly f-fine with me, d-doll." And it was absolutely fine with him. He didn't need lobster or steak, accompanied with red or white wine, he didn't need anything fancy, something this simple will do because as long as Tony was here it's just perfect. He reaches into one of the Burger King bags and takes out a burger and set of fries for Tony before he reaches into the other bag and grabs his own. He unwraps the burger, unleashing the succulent smell of melted cheese and perfectly cooked, crispy, sizzling bacon, and oh so juicy well-cooked meat. It makes his mouth water a bit, but instead of taking a bite of the burger, he holds it out for Tony to eat first instead.
The elevator dinged and he made his way towards the kitchen, the smell of bacon wafted through the air under his nose as he got closer.
"I've got it bad, don't I J?"
He was at his happiest when they were talking, and throughout the week he's noticed Steve has gotten him to get out of his lab just a little bit more often and to sleep a little bit early. However, when there were things he really needed to work on; such as polishing up the final touches on his Iron Man suit, Steve was willing to let him stay awake a few more hours for him to finish it. The blonde was also more than happy to stay up in the late-night hours for Tony as well since their time zones were different. Steve would sometimes call when it was morning for Tony and nighttime for him, and vice versa. Of course, Tony knew the blonde didn't need sleep considering he was a super soldier, although it didn't stop him from also telling the man to sleep as well.
He's never done drugs, so he wouldn't know what that's like, but he has gotten heartbroken, not once, but twice.
"Hmm? Oh, nothing. Just enjoying the way you're trying so hard to keep the emotion out of your voice at how much you enjoy me touching you." He whispered, letting his fingers breach past Tony's boxers, slowly sliding downwards, brushing across his thighs.
he had for Tony that made him think for a fraction of a second that going back to New York was a good choice. It was that choice that he made that landed him here, in the Raft Prison.
"Tony."
won't be possible. After all, once again, science cannot fix this. But he still believes, that Tony believes, that the genius can solve this. He tells himself that's the reason why he's being ignored, or forgotten after every therapy session- which, he's stopped attending fully due to not having the motivation to stay as often, or even go for that matter.
"It's ok big guy. I love you, too. I'll always be here for you." He promised.
All eyes were trained on Fury, the Director's calm exterior never faltering as he looked at every one of them. It was like some twisted scheme was playing out before them, like those movies where someone you thought you could trust ends up being someone else, or worse, potentially evil. It had Tony's nerves on end as he and everyone else waited, that was until he was the one who spoke up.
"Tony?"
kissing him. He pulled back and rested his head against Steve's, their noses touching only slightly, and big bright smiles plastered on their faces. They both panted for air, neither letting each other go as they enjoyed the little space between them.
"I'll be sure to remember that the next time I see you." She commented, a slight smirk on her lips. He looked at her with one eyebrow raised, confusion very much visible on his face. He looked at Steve for some sort of explanation, and well, let's just say the soldier understood what she was trying to say, but decided to act if he didn't know the joke she was making.
He didn't even know the compound had this little room because he's never seen the door before. He turned his head, looking over his shoulder upon picking up the faint humming sound behind him. He saw the door disappear before his eyes as it looked like the wall was sliding over it. Well, that certainly explains why he never noticed it.
"You're a fucking sap." Steve laughed in response.
"Oh, you're awake." He says a little startled, adding a chuckle towards the end. "Sorry about not being here when you woke up, I wanted to make you breakfast and be here but I got caught up talking to T'Challa." He places the plate of food and the cup of juice gently on the dresser, moving the sketchbook out of the way just so it didn't get dirtied somehow. He didn't say anything, for he simply just stared at the genius, which in return made him smile nervously and scratch the back of his head. "In case you're wondering, T'Challa and I were talking about the accords and trying to fix them so we can all go home back to the compound. I actually have to go speak to him again but, well, I wanted to come see you and make you breakfast in bed."
"Today."
"That still doesn't explain how they were able to get their hands on shield tech and modify the weapons," Tony said.
carries for this man, even after what he's done to him over the past five days, and even now, that he's willing to forgive him if he just comes through the door right now.
"T-Tony? W-Why?"
Unconsciously he smiled, thinking of the way Tony's eyes sparkled when the sunlight cast over his face just right, his eyelashes filtering out most of the sunlight that made his eyes pop just right, or the way he licked his lips sometimes whenever he saw Steve; those same lips he wished were on his own right now, or other various parts of his body. And he blushed at the thought because it was just a little bit dirty, but hey there's nothing wrong with being intimate with someone you truly love. Besides, he's not gonna deny that he wasn't willing to fuck Tony against the wall or on his bed in his room. Actually, he'll deny that to other people, but to himself, he won't deny it.
He leaned in slowly, as did the genius. Their faces were mere inches from each other, slowly getting closer until their lips brushed against each other.
The second thing he wanted to do was to
But then suddenly the door to his room opens, but he doesn't think anything of it. It's when he smells the sizzling crispy bacon, and sees the half blurry, half-clear, short, and slightly muscular build of his favorite brunette walk through the door with a plate of bacon, eggs, pancakes lightly drizzled in syrup, and two pieces of buttered toast resting gently on the eggs, accompanied by a cup of orange juice, did he think that maybe he didn't dream that the brunette was in his room. Maybe this time he actually was in his room and got up early to make him breakfast.
"I'm sorry." He whispered. Shaking his head and letting out a small sob, kissing the back of his hand as a sort of apology for what he believes he's caused. He sniffles for a few seconds before regaining as much of his senses as he can to speak calmly. "Your right eye is going to be blurry for a while, as the doctors recently just told me. They're not sure if it's temporary or if the serum can fix it, so..." And he took another breath because it was too hard for him to deliver this news. He could see Steve visibly tense as his head dipped further back into the pillow his head rested on, his own tears threatening to fall from his tear ducts. He leaned forward and used one of his hands to wipe the tears away. He didn't want Steve to cry, he was already probably hurting so much on the inside because of this just like Tony, and if he cried, it would just destroy the genius even more. "They also told me that your larynx, ya know your vocal cords, Uhm... Got damaged during the operation and said that you either wouldn't be able to talk at all and even if you were able to, like right now, you'd experience frequent stuttering."
"Tony!"
"Please, help me. It hurts, everything hurts." I said softly. I let a sob escape past my lips as I spoke more loudly this time. "Please, save me! I'm in so much pain." She smiled at me and moved closer, her hand gently resting on the side of my head.
data is being held. What exactly is this mission for it to be so heavily encrypted and classified?"
"Oh, fuck. Fuck, fuck, Tony!" He felt the blonde shiver violently, his swears becoming louder and louder, his name being called. He hallowed out his cheeks, sucking hard and drawing more swears and moans of pleasure from Steve's mouth. Before he knew it, another violent shiver coursed through Steve's body, and his mouth was filled with a warm sensation. He happily swallowed the liquid, breathing heavily through his nose as he slowly rose after swallowing all Steve had to offer. He panted heavily, looking at Steve who was also panting heavily, a glazed look in his eyes, mixed with a lazy smile on his face.
He watched as footage he's already seen before appears on the computer screen. Yes, he knows all about the horrible things that Ross and his guards have done to Steve- his Steve, mind you because he planted a nanite camera that managed to crawl its way undetected into the central hall where the prison cells were. This is the second time he watches Ross wail on Steve with the back end of a gun, repeatedly striking him in the head, drawing blood that mats and stains his blonde hair. Twice he watches Steve steel his expression every time Ross shocks him with the collar around his neck, twice he watches him clench his jaw, and twice he watches his body visibly shake. And he hates himself that he's subjected him to this, because he was the one who brought him to New York, right into the hands of the person who hates his guts.
Tony to get better, he can't handle the pain of not having him here. He was the only one, despite them having a rough start at the beginning, as well as that one night they argued, who made Steve feel like he was so much more than just a superhero persona. Tony made him feel like an actual person, and he wanted to tell the genius how much he truly meant to him.
"Anything seems out of the ordinary?" Tony asked as he heard the creak of metal from their comms. He swore as softly as he could when red words that said "DENIED" came into his vision. This must be one heavily encrypted code for him to not be able to break it this easily, but he wasn't going to give up.
"Have you seen Romanoff, Barton, and the Captain?"
"I mean before today. You're usually always angry, or depressed."
The door creaked as it slowly opened, and his breath caught in his throat. He didn't really expect to see
Before he could speak, Nat motioned with her head for him to follow. The three sprinted their way into a snowy wonderland in the forest, nothing going untouched by the harsh climate. She led them back to where Clint was standing, and as he looked at the ground the tracks were barely visible, but there was no mistaking that there were indeed two separate footprints, one big and one small.
"Alright, how about the past month?" He whispered to himself. His fingers flew across the keyboards again and the scenes changed, playing recordings from the past month. He stared intently at the screens, everything seeming perfectly normal, still no sign of foul play. He was about to give up when he saw it. He moved the mouse, dragging the cursor to the top left screen, clicking on the bottom right security footage. There was Fury when he issued the mission to Steve, Nat, and Clint.
"Morning." He said softly. His smile never faltered even as Tony sat next to him; it's as if yesterday's talk seemed to have calmed down the nervous tics and uncomfortable feelings festered within himself. He elevated his feet onto the armrest of the couch, his back rested against what little of the couch was left as his head lay gently in Tony's lap, his face looking up at him. The genius ran his fingers through Steve's blonde locks once more, a content sigh escaping the soldier's lips. "I missed you."
"No." The words flew out of his mouth faster than a bullet. The super soldier furrowed his eyebrows, a crease forming between them, and a small frown on his face.
"Sounds like a lovely woman."
He closed his eyes in defeat shortly after watching Loki's scepter being raised in the air, knowing that there was no way out of this. Is this truly the way he was going from this world? What more could he do, in his damaged state. It'll hurt Steve at first when he's gone because everybody that Steve has come to know and love leave him, but eventually he'll move on. He'll cope is what Tony is hoping for after he dies, and it's selfish, he knows, but he's weak and damaged, with no control over his mind due to the scepters exposure, and all he can do is pray that things will work out.
giving you up to Ross."
I sat there, for what felt like minutes, or maybe even hours. It was hard to tell past the numbing sensation in my body and the fuzzy haze in my mind. I felt paralyzed in my own body as if it wouldn't respond to me. I didn't know what to do except just sitting here and accept what was happening to me. I had no choice but to sit here and wait for Tony to return. I just wanted to go home. I just want to go back home and make everything right, I want Tony to love me, I want him to hold me how he used to and tell me everything is going to be alright. I didn't want this pain, but Tony assured me I deserve it. He's probably right, I do deserve it. I deserve every bit of pain he gives me for letting myself be weak and get captured. I don't deserve Tony, he deserves better.
He set objects on top of the drawer next to his bed, his footsteps light and quiet so he doesn't disturb the sleeping blonde. He knelt, grabbing one of Steve's arms and placing it around his shoulders, while he wrapped his own arm around Steve's waist. The soldier groaned a bit in his sleep, his face scrunching up, and his breathing had shifted, but he didn't wake up. Tony let out a quiet breath of relief as he carefully sat Steve up, his head bobbing from the side, finding its place on Tony's shoulder. The brunette rolled his eyes, wondering to himself why the fuck he thought this was a good idea. He should've just grabbed the pillow and the blanket, and put them on the floor with him. But, his own consciousness- that little annoying, goody-two-shoes asshole voice that told him not to, made him decide to do this instead.
"Would you like me to call in sir?"
It was a weird moment for him, and as he continues to look at the soldier groaning slightly in pain, he starts to wonder if what he's doing is wrong. And, of course, it is wrong, but in Tony's mind it was two sides clashing against each other; one that held all the hatred he had for the blue-eyed man who hurt him, threw him aside like a second option, the side that only sought to seek revenge and make him suffer, while the other side was filled with compassion, telling him that he was in the wrong for what he was doing and that he didn't want to see Steve like this.
"Can you blame me? This feels so good. No one has ever done this to me before. Hell, nobody has even touched me before, you're the first person to do this to me."
"Fine. Cap and I were hanging out, nothing more nothing less."
And it hurts, to have these thoughts and feelings because he's
your friend, and I am
"I'm glad you met Rhodey, he's a great guy. If it makes you feel better, I wish I was still around so I could at least stop the bullying as well." He couldn't help the full-blown smile that etched itself onto his face, truthfully it made him unbelievably happy to hear that, and he wouldn't be lying if he said a few butterflies were flapping around in his stomach.
"Then why don't you put your lips on mine again, soldier."
"Steve, please believe me he's lying!" Tony yelled. He looked into Tony's scared brown eyes, finding everything he's ever worked for right in them. He saw the love, the fear, the compassion, he saw everything Tony wanted to say at this moment, but he didn't say anything. "Babe, please I love you. I wouldn't betray you a second time. Please, believe me." Tony kept his tear-filled, trembling blue eyes on Steve's face, looking for any sign that he believed him. "Please, I love you."
"Uh... Sure, Tony, I'd like that. Now can I please get dressed?"
"Wh-why..." And he pauses, his eyes widening. That's... Never happened to him before. He's
"Wanna watch a movie after?"
"Two at the front, they won't see you, however." He takes the first few steps down the ladder, closing the hatch as quietly as he can. He touches down on solid, metal platforming, looking over the metal railing to see the two guards Friday told him about, standing guard at the door.
"Alright you two, let's cut this short. We have a genius, billionaire, ex-playboy, philanthropist to save." Natasha said. He grabbed the doorknob once more, twisting it and pushing the door open, and letting the sunlight over the mountains wash over their bodies.
"Have patience, Man of Iron. However, I understand your frustration, so it is okay to be on edge. These creatures are not similar to the Chitauri, if you were wondering, they're a smaller group of creatures whose purpose is to eliminate threats that could damage their plan to pave the way for other entities to take over."
"Then we'll do that together, too." Steve's smile widened, and he leaned forward to peck Tony's lips once more. "I love you," he said once he pulled back.
For the record, I would just like to say that, no, Steve didn't die here. Although it seems that way, I can state that he doesn't die.
"Not even with Pepper?" He gazed down into the once again bright blue eyes, reverted to their natural color that he absolutely cherished looking into. He also noticed upon closer inspection, that there was a hint of green mixed in with the blue, but it didn't overpower them, no, rather it complimented them.
serious, because if there was something terribly wrong with Steve, he would not be able to live that down.
"They didn't tell me what they were, they just knew about me and asked if I wanted revenge. They work in small groups, I don't know if that is any information considering there were only three of them at the time."
"What?" He said looking at Nat. She smiled at him, walking over towards him and placing her hand on his head, her fingers running itself through his brown curly locks. He sighed and closed his eyes, letting himself relax as she calmed him down.
"God, you're so beautiful," Steve whispered, leaning down and placing soft kisses against Tony's skin. He started at his hip bones that were always hugged by the jeans that he wore, his stomach soon being showered in kisses, causing him to giggle, his chest the last area to be touched by the soldier's lips, the area around the Arc Reactor being shown the most affection. "This thing in your chest, it's a part of you, and it's so beautiful. Everything about you is beautiful, please don't ever change." Tony smiled, ruffling the blonde's hair.
angry Tony Stark. He huffed out a breath of annoyance as he traversed the cold metal flooring. He never liked it here, what with all the super-secret spy missions and all their fancy gadgets that he could make ten times better, but most of all he never got along with Fury. It was a very rare occasion that the genius ever saw eye to eye with the guy, and when he did, it was mostly when it concerned his team and what plans they
It's as he looks at this man in front of him, that he's overwhelmed with an immense wave of happiness. It makes him get out of bed instantly, placing his hands on the genius's face and attaching his lips to Tony's. It was more than just a simple kiss; it was a kiss that held so much emotion from the blonde, so much happiness and so much love radiating into this one kiss. He ran his hands down the sides of Tony's frame, inching down his sides and over the curve of his hips, stopping only once his hands had taken their place on Tony's ass.
"I'm always picking up after you boys." She muttered sourly, but there was still a small twitch and the corner of her lips that ensured him she was just teasing. She turned her head and nodded her head towards the glass window where Bucky was. He nodded back and opened the cell door Tony was in, making him turn back around quickly and bring the genius into his loving embrace.
"Do you want to go to therapy?" Another nod, almost instantly. It brought some warmth into his chest at the mere fact that Steve
He let out a shaky breath, carefully putting his feet onto this ground. He stood up on wobbly legs, his strength not quite back yet as he fell over-similar to that of a toddler who was trying to take their first steps in life, or maybe someone who didn't have their sea legs and got seasick really easily, or even someone with motion sickness, but either way he laid there on all fours, shifting ever so slightly so he could rest on his ass instead.
He waits, and waits, and waits, but he never shows, and once again he thinks he's to blame. That somehow in the grand scheme of things it's all his fault. Even as his eyes flutter shut, and his cheeks and sheets are stained with his tears, he continues to wait, and wait, and wait.
"Bother with what?" A voice said behind him, causing him to jump a little bit in his seat. He turned around and spotted Natasha, standing there behind him, a crooked smile on her face. He swore it was hard to tell when she was being Black Widow and Natasha Romanoff, it was like the two were the same person, sneaky, stealthy, perfect posture and lack of emotion on their face. Although, with some credit to Natasha, the smile on her face was a small indication that he could tell when she was being Black Widow and herself.
"You're so silly. No, because you see me for me. You know more about me than most people, and you like me for who I am, not what I am."
being unlocked. The door opened and he angrily stormed his way into the office.
"I said, do you think Loki could be a part of this?" It was a possibility, what with Loki pulling that stunt in New York that almost destroyed Manhattan. Maybe the guy is still pissed off and wants to exact his revenge by getting rid of them one by one.
"I should be in that stretcher, Bruce. I should be the one lying there, not him. Not Steve, he didn't deserve this."
But each day he spends in the lab is each day he misses seeing Steve after every therapy session. It's not that he's wanting to ignore Steve, and in no way has he forgotten about him, but he's caught up in trying to fix the mess he thinks he's created that he doesn't realize how much he's hurting the super-soldier. Each day he sits in Shuri's lab, tinkering away and laughing with the other genius, that he does not see his lover standing outside, looking into the glass window of the lab and feeling neglected.
