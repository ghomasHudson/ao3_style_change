‘Sorry, miss,’ Peter casts a quick glance at the board, making sure they hadn’t covered anything new. ‘We were just having a short debate as to whether seeing his father’s ghost is the first sign of Hamlet going mad or not. I said yes but Ned argued no seeing as everyone else can see him too.’
A folder containing the newly agreed Accords. They would be separate from the UN as before, but would not be able to perform missions without express consent and would still be answerable to the Council. They could, however, go somewhere if the need was deemed great enough without prior consent. Tony had purposefully left that as ambiguous as possible. He’d argued for
‘We’d be better off each of us focussing on specific areas rather than trying to reach out to everyone,’ Rhodes adds. ‘You’re never going to have everyone like you, it’s impossible.’
By the time they’ve completed the team building activities that were set for after dinner Peter is ready to escape the majority of his classmates. As soon as Sam calls for everyone else to follow him back to the area they’d set aside for the school’s use, Peter grabs his friends and quick marches them towards the elevators.
I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas, no matter which faith you belong to and where in the world you are. May your Christmases all be filled with joy, blessings and love.
‘You shouldn’t be worrying about anyone but yourself,’ she reassures the younger woman. ‘How you doing?’
Natasha looks at him as he struggles to answer and takes pity on him. ‘Hydrophobia,’ she replies.  ‘From his time in Afghanistan.’
‘That was wonderful!’ Wanda enthuses as the show comes to a close, she’s beaming as she looks at him and they collect their things and start to make their way out of the auditorium. As they walk out with the crowd Wanda keeps up a steady chatter about the different moves the dancers had done, and how interesting some parts of the choreography were. Vision’s just happy to watch her animated features as she talks, not really understanding most of what she is referring to. Thankfully it also means she’s distracted enough that he can lead her down some streets to a nearby park without her noticing where they are going.
‘Err…Dr Banner can you help get me out?’ a small voice says from the middle of the room. Scratch that, hanging dead centre in the middle of the room nearly five feet above the ground.
Whatever Peter is about to say is cut off as he looks up and frowns, face determined. ‘I’ll buy you time,’ he tells them both, scrambling to his feet and planting himself between the approaching Titan and the four members of his team. Steve crouching over Tony as the inventor struggles to regain his strength with his new reactor, and Wanda and Vision not far behind them.
He sighs. ‘Don’t you think I’ve already had a freak out about this? I spoke to Wade yesterday when we were cleaning up after dinner; he genuinely cares about Pete, I’d go so far as to say he’d to
‘Indeed, I shall be happy to watch over him if you need to leave him somewhere during your travels,’ Thor offers.
A/N: Hi everyone! Sorry I'm a bit late I've been trying to get a couple of chapters into this year's Christmas story so I could post the first one today. I'll be doing that right after posting this.
I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas, no matter what faith you follow or where you are in the world. May love, blessings and all the joy in the world find you all.
‘Strangely enough, yeah. It has everything to do with the fight you two just had. Now normally I’d be all for staying out of it and letting you two sort it out yourselves-’
‘I’m paying anyway, let me get what I want. Besides Steve isn’t here to give me his disappointed eyes when he sees me drinking more than he thinks is good.’
‘Dude you were born like a century ago,’ Sam says, and there’s the sound of a scrabbling going on behind him, which he imagines is Bucky trying to take a swipe at Sam.
‘Yeah no,’ he shakes his head firmly. ‘I have trouble when family shouts thanks to sensitive hearing. I don’t need to hear two people screaming at each other about whose turn it is to wash the dishes.’ He turns to look at the mercenary. ‘Where have you been the last week? I haven’t seen you around.’
Rhodes’ hand gets pulled from his and he opens his mouth to shout for the other man, but only ends up coughing as he inhales the dust. He’s fully free from the hole and he struggles out of the grip of the other hands on him.
‘Get in the suit and use it to move this stuff, and hurry it up. Just know one thing: you so much as scratch it and I’m using you for target practise.’
‘Perfect. Think you can hold that stuff up a little longer while I try and clear a hole for everyone?’
‘Avengers? Thank god you’re here. We’ve got most of the other cell blocks shut down and contained except for cell block 8 where the explosion happened. They managed to get into the dining area and the kitchens but no further,’ the Warden’s voice comes through the comms link.
‘I shall do my best,’ Loki responds with a grin. ‘And Tony?’ he calls back the other’s attention as he nears the door. ‘Thank you.’
Steve turns Tony’s face to him again. ‘This is one that I am not going to break, not while there’s still breath in my body.’
‘I’m coming,’ Peter lands nimbly next to the soldier and takes hold of one of the ends, the two of them pulling back as hard as they can.
‘Seriously?’ Steve just rolls his eyes, unable to keep the small smile from his face as he pulls Tony against his side.
Peter lets the others talk wash over him as he does his best to eat as much food as possible, his whole body complaining at the lack of energy. He’s only halfway through when Natasha enters the dining hall, Thor just behind her.
Fury looked back at the unconscious man then at Fury. Coulson deciding he knew what Fury was thinking, resolutely shook his head. There was nothing that could possibly justify bringing Tony in and Coulson knew that now.
Steve sighed out of relief, when he made his way back to the kitchen. He took a few moments to himself and smiled. Today had gone a whole lot better than he ever imagined and he imagined things could only get better…hopefully.
“But it’s over now. No more games, no more running in circles,” Steve said. “You have no more time.”
He made excuses to the girls, telling them he would be right back. He ignored Karen looking at him as he passed through the kitchen outside.
“Didn’t know you like Stark so much,” Clint muttered darkly. “Might be why he was the one got to stay here, while we were out in exile. Playing favorites?”
Marley nodded. “They did. I didn’t fold into the pressure. Besides purple is so not my color and I don’t want my lips to be stained. Mr. Clint told William and Miles, if they said he won they would give him lollipops.”
Mrs. Thompson shrugged. “Of course you would think that I am talking negatively. I am sorry if I touched a sensitive topic for you seeing as though you are the brand image of the effects of a broken family. Perhaps that is why these two children are acting out, they no doubt know of how you grew up within your family. Maybe they’re taking after their mentor.”
“Let’s just say he won’t be driving anyone or himself ever again or speak,” Cali muttered then winced. “But I’m here to check your wounds. If you can just lie down, I can…”
“Oh, my gosh you brought the Black Widow here. Like the Black Widow,” Jaime stuttered looking about a few seconds away from passing out. “I…this is the best thing you have ever done for my life Mr. Stark. I mean besides like the tuition scholarship you gave me this is the best.”
Rhodey leaned up on his elbows and took his sunglasses off to look at Pepper. “No, not since a few days ago. I’m assuming she hasn’t found anything. That’s good though right? Right?” he questioned again noticing Pepper’s silence.
“Yes, he told me,” he whispered as though it was a secret he was not supposed to be sharing with Tony.
“I don’t know. It sounded funny,” Miles giggled squishing Tony’s cheeks in between his two hands. “I was going to show her my Spiderman toy, but she left.”
Steve’s cheeks grew warm. It was true in part. Clint had been driven out of retirement for something he could have easily ignored. Steve should have told Clint to stay home with his wife and kids. He had no business in seeking out Clint’s help. It was his fault for having Clint direct all of his anger at Tony. It was always easing placing blame on someone who couldn’t defend themselves.
“You know you’re such a beautiful person Tony,” Ryder admitted. “It’s a shame you had to go and ruin your face like this.”
Tony abruptly tried ripping himself away from Steve, but Steve’s tight grasp on his hands kept him pressed against Steve.
Within seconds everyone began walking toward the quinjet on the roof. No one said anything. However, when they began to get closer to the quinjet Steve turned to them.
The blinding smile Ryder sent his way warmed Tony. Tony felt that out of everything bad with today was washed away with that smile. Ryder looked down at him from under his eyelashes and traced his nose.
Now left alone Steve took the time to slump forward and just let the fact that Tony was safe cloak him in a sense of security. His eyes drooped and he figured he could fall asleep right there if he just took a few more steps he could be sitting at the kitchen table and take a quick nap.
“Ryder introduced me to her as the head nurse at the hospital Harley’s mom is at,” Steve told them. “Miriam.”
Steve made sure Miles was buckled up safely in the backseat and then went back to the driver’s side.
“Yeah, but I mean its fine. Harley and I don’t mind. He’s a quiet sleeper anyways. My problem is mostly Harley. Guy sleeps like its trouble breathing,” Peter said smiling. “I’m surprised Miles never wakes up from his loud snores.”
“I’m pretty sure we have to go through height check,” Steve announced looking at the height check toward the middle of the line.
“So what you’re going to court me now or something?” Tony said feeling off balance and wanting to gain some solid ground. So he hoped that he could quip some Tony Stark sarcasm into the conversation.
Steve stepped forward, following Tony as he tugged him to his friends who were now beginning a very serious and competitive game of charades.
Suddenly, he felt chills break through his body. Even though the lights were on he could feel darkness start to claw its way up the four walls. His chest heaved up and down. Trembling fingers pressed against his chest as though it could still its fast movement.
Steve nodded, before verbally telling FRIDAY yes. The volume lowered considerably and Steve could see Tony’s head raise to look around at the cause, before his eyes caught on Steve. He smiled sheepishly, though it came out guiltier as his eyes settled on the mess before him.
“Anyways, he starts getting thirsty so he reaches for a juice box. Rips the straw off and punches it straight through the box, drink spilling onto the ground. Simple mistake, sure. He does that again three different times. And meanwhile he keeps trying and missing. I’m over here wondering how he can’t make it, seeing as though he’s an archer and you know has to make his targets.”
“I apologized and I bought her like fifteen stuffed animals,” Clint added. “I felt terrible. Juice boxes are hard stuff, man.”
Ever since his talk with Natasha and Tony, aided with the words from Isa, Steve had realized how his actions had tremendously affected his relationships and the relationships of people around him. Steve had never wanted to be the one to break up a family and he had done exactly that. He had broken up the Avengers and now the Barton family.
Steve didn’t dare allow himself to look back, not even when he heard Tony’s body fall to the ground and heard sobs rack through his body.
“I like you more than baba’s boyfriend,” Miles whispered. “Julie said he’s gonna be my dad. I don’t want him to be my dad. Can’t you be my dad instead Mr. Steve? I’ll be the bestest son ever, you can ask baba!”
After Tony had dropped Miles off at his school, he instructed Happy to lead him somewhere. He quickly read of the instructions, ignoring Happy’s swift glance of worry and concern. He stared at him unflinchingly letting Happy know that he was fine and that’s where he wanted to go.
“Ms. Natasha said you aren’t supposed to leave,” Julie said biting her lip, her gaze looking hesitantly at Fury.
He had said that sometimes it was just hard for him to keep his emotions bottled in and he had tried for three days. That was much longer than what he would have usually done. He looked at his phone and realized that Ryder had tried calling him, but Tony didn’t feel like answering.
“Because last time that happened there was a war,” Pepper said warmly in contrast to the coldness in her eyes. “He doesn’t need the stress right now. So I will be helping him out with that and it may be better to do it with someone you are not personally tied to right now. Vision?”
Shuri had accepted Tony’s phone with a grimace on her face as she put her number in. Nearly three days later Shuri and Peter had gathered to troll the two resident genius, Shuri mainly. Tony and Bruce would try debating over whether biomedical engineering or mechanical engineering are better and both of them would tease them. Peter was usually just Shuri’s hype man as she teased Tony.
“That’s not true, Steve. You did all you could and even we have limits of where our skills are. But we got him back Steve. Feel very grateful for that. But don’t you dare-”
The two let the conversation rest for a little, perfectly fine with just being in each other’s company. Tony felt himself slowly falling into sleep with Steve’s hold on his hand. Steve leaned closer and this time Tony could feel Steve’s nose brush his cheek.
“You have to understand how this all looks to someone from the outside Tony. Remember when I told you about those rumors I heard about you in regards to the Avengers. They are certainly looking true right now. Did you spread your legs for them, while I was gone? That’s probably why you didn’t return my calls. Was Steve fucking you, when I was out saving kids?”
“The traitor. FRIDAY disable Cap’s code. No one gets to tell me how long I can work,” Tony huffed, rubbing at his eyes tiredly.
He sighed and looked at the kid. The boy hadn’t stopped frowning and now he was running his hands though his hair trying to calm the strands to stand down. He shook his head and gave out a brittle laugh.
“And you didn’t think to tell me,” Ryder hissed as he straddled Tony’s hips. He pressed his wet fingers against Tony’s hips and scratched at the soft skin there. Tony let out a hiss and tried pushing Ryder’s hands away from him.
Tony opened his eyes and tried to cease the shaking in his body and the tears that were falling on his cheeks.
“Are you cold?” Ryder questioned again, leaning over to press a kiss against Tony’s eyelids. Ryder shrugged off his jacket and placed it over Tony’s shaking shoulders. “I know you’re awake. You know it hurts me, when you pretend that you’re sleeping. Is my presence truly that displeasing for you? Have I not given you enough food? Have I not made sure that you are bathed?”
Natasha held him steady. He was too weak to appropriately fight her off. She hated how he kept letting out pained moans. His body shook and Natasha was worried that he was quickly growing sick with fever.
“Yeah,” Tony answered. “But the night is going well. I mean it always tends to be a good night. It’s a time that everyone lay aside their differences with one another, their egos, the competition, and everything. It’s…to put it simple it’s one of the best Christmases I’ve had in a long time.”
“Wow, that’s some um dedication,” Steve announced. “Mind telling me how you adjusted to fit the game?”
Rhodey shook his head and without even saying anything left outside. His eyes widened, scared that he had done something to get Rhodey to leave. He swallowed the lump in his throat at Rhodey’s disappearance. He wanted to ask what he did to get him to leave.
Steve pinched the bridge of his noise and handed off the tangled fairy lights to Natasha who had come in just a little while ago to bring in the sparkling cider.
“Excuse me sir,” Karen spoke. “You both know this is not how we behave. And why am I still not hearing apologies or seeing you two hug.”
A few seconds of silence passed, before Bucky spoke up. “You know I know you want to kill him. I’m not saying that he isn’t deserving of death, but Steve I don’t want you to go to a point of no return. People like me, Clint, and Natasha we can reach that point and return, because we have been trained.”
Steve slowly walked to the room. He stopped short of entering, hating the monotonous beating of the heart monitor and the near pristine walls of the hospital. He then finally allowed himself to rest his eyes on Tony’s unmoving figure.
“And we’re back,” Bucky said, this time not event stepping to stop Steve as he took the gun he had taken from Bucky and shot Ryder once in the kneecap.
And Steve had accepted all of that fairly well. He figured it was better to accept this Bucky standing in front of him than pushing him away in favor of waiting for the guy that fell off the train.
Bucky woke up, breath catching in his throat. He immediately looked at the two sleeping people on the couch and made sure they were okay. Once seeing that nothing had happened to them, Bucky relaxed his shoulders. Bucky shifted until he was comfortable and placed a hand on Tony’s ankles. Before his eyes drifted shut, he saw Ryder coming into the den.
Ryder sighed dejectedly. “I knew how you were back in the day. Hell I probably had a hand in how you started sleeping with so many different people. That was my mistake, wasn’t it? Didn’t know it would get so bad.”
“Yes, and I have no shame in that matter. Though actually just a little because I don’t want to like jinx Miles’ health because he’s been really good so far,” Tony said biting his lip. “I probably should’ve used a different excuse. Crap I probably just could’ve said I was coming down with something and needed to go home.”
Eva ran to the hospital, having left her children with their grandmother. Her eyes burned bright with tears and she felt she could collapse at any moment. She had felt faint ever since she received the phone call. She tried pushing away how her first thought was how she hoped her husband had survived. For all intents and purposes Ryder was a complete stranger to her. She had not attachments to him. While it would be sad for her husband, she was entirely grateful that the person in the hospital had been identified as her husband.
She leaned over and pressed a nail into a bruise. Tony let out a string of curses as she pierced her skin into the skin, small drops of red tainting her finger. She leaned back.
“You’re so whipped it’s ridiculous,” Peter teased Harley, who was still rambling about Julia and had now gone on to talk about her smile.
“You know at some point we’re going to have to get up and shower. I know you have errands to run. I’ll have to drop the kids off at school. Oh, and today I probably have to go to meetings since I know that…fuck,” Tony broke off as the teasing finger pressed inside, pushing back any cum that had been slowly leaking outside of Tony.
“And what has you all chipper today? Usually you come home complaining about this teacher and the next,” Steve joked, pulling off of the school campus and heading to Miles elementary school which was thankfully only a few minutes away.
Karen finally stood from her position, tickling Tony. She sat back in her chair and faced Tony, who was trying to regain his breathing from laughing so hard. Karen smiled kindly at him, allowing him a few moments to recollect himself.
Miles by then had grown bored of listening to their questions and restlessly started turning around in his seat. He once tried to get up and leave. Thankfully May saw all of this and offered Miles her phone so he could play some games. Pleased with something to do, Miles sat back in Tony’s lap and stayed glued to the phone.
Harley clenched his jaw as though remembering did him a great pain. “Flash was just being an ass. Basically he was saying how Mr. Stark wasn’t a genius and it was only through his dad’s legacy that he was able to build something. Then he said if it weren’t for Ryder, Tony would still be seen as a…” he broke off not wanting to say the word that Flash had said.
Tony pulled away and bit his lip. He lowered his eyes and said, “I think that’ll be the same night I propose to Steve. I’ve been thinking about it for a while…and why do you two look like I just told you I ran over Clint’s dog?”
“I never wanted it! Everything that you did for me. I never wanted a single touch of yours not after the first month of us dating. I never wanted it,” Tony screamed, feeling his voice bounce against the walls.
Clint waggled his eyebrows. “What do you mean by personal? Did you confess your undying love to Tony? I bet that was romantic. You probably cried.”
“Sorry about that guys. I was hoping no one would see us in this state” Ryder said smiling warmly. “Tony had a panic attack. He just got too overwhelmed and cornered with everyone coming to him suddenly…he just froze and soon well…”
you like Michelle just tell her how you feel and then you both can reach the conclusion of whether to try a relationship or remain friends.”
“I’m thinking that maybe having meetings and keeping up with the kids for two weeks straight was a good thing, if it means sex like this. I mean goodness Steve I don’t think I’ve pulled out some of those moves, since the 90s. You’re welcome by the way,” Tony laughed.
“Which is terrifying, Steve. It terrifies me that he could have the ability to take me back to that hotel room, take me away from you all and…” Tony cut off there and his breath hitched in his throat.
Natasha looked between the two and slowly smiled. Tony would have been slightly scared, if Natasha hadn’t seemed amused and slightly happy. Natasha cracked the door open a little further and motioned for Tony to stand up. Tony did so and Natasha adjusted his clothing then did the same for Steve.
“It’s not a date Tony. I have told you this multiple times,” Rhodey groaned. “This is just physical therapy.”
Steve thanked everything that he could still hear what they were saying even though their voices had grown softer.
“Hey, there’s nothing lame or boring about being Peter Parker either,” Steve inserted into the conversation.
His hands began to tremble and he felt acid burn in his throat. Everything around him grew hazy. His mind started to go back to Siberia and…
Steve left and threw on a shirt that was lying on his floor. He hadn’t a need to see if it was dirty or not. He was sure, it would get dirty with what he needed to do.
Tony, so caught up in his thoughts, simply acknowledged her intent with a head nod. Clint did the same and soon the three of them were all huddled up on the floor of Tony’s lab, backs against his desk. DUM-E whirled by them and Tony leaned his body forward, bring Natasha and Clint with him. DUM-E spun in a circle, beeping excitedly at Tony.
Miles held tightly on to Tony’s hand and urged him to go faster. “Alright Miles I get the hint. I’m coming. I’m coming.”
“Please. Just please don’t bring my son into this,” Tony slurred, hiccupping around another taste of alcohol.
“Good, job kotenok,” Nat said, moving to kiss him on his fevered forehead. She stepped back and looked at Steve.
Tony didn’t know what was happening. Ryder had never been so careful with him. Tony didn’t want to say anything to break this softness, this hesitance of touch and safety. Ryder ran his fingers through Tony’s hair that was beginning to curl at the nape of his neck.
And hell, who even got turned on by pictures of someone clearly abused. Probably this fucker right here, all smiling and acting like he hadn’t been affected. Steve was really going to have to do a cursing cleanse, once he was done dealing with this man. He sent apologies to his ma, who was probably chastising him from above.
“Excuse me what? It just sounded like you said it was you who killed my parents. Steve what the hell?”
Tony had had enough. He burst into Karen’s office wide eyed and breathing heavily fear gripping his chest at thought of Miles going away with this Evan and his wife.
Pepper stood from her chair and ran her fingers affectionately through Tony’s curling hair. She lent down and kissed his forehead, leaning back as Tony closed his eyes.
“I thought you said we could share,” Steve offered innocently and if it weren’t for the smirk setting in on his face, Tony would have thought his statement was genuine.
He wished that he could talk to his son. He wanted to hear Miles’ voice and wondered, if there was someone in this CMPNY who he could get to agree. He tried with everyone, tried baiting them to see who had just a little bit of kindness. Luka was in the running, but after his punishment from Ryder he remained distant.
“You think that anyone on this team, this composition of a self-made family will be okay with you being the only one to help Tony heal? You think this will be helpful for them, in letting just you be the one to make Tony feel home again. And you should feel thankful that you have members of your team to be your strengths when you are at your weakest. So what if Natasha was the one who found the room he was in, at the end of the day the end result was Tony is here. It would be good for you to remember, it wasn’t just you that missed Tony.”
He tried ignoring how easy it was going to be to accept Steve’s “fighting” for him because Tony would be lying if he said he wasn’t already in love.
“Tony, please don’t take the phone apa—” Steve’s voice cut off as Tony pounded the phone onto the edge of the nightstand to crack open the back so he could see inside.
“Invasion? No,” Ross agreed with a gruff laugh. “But—forgive me, Your Majesty—not even the Dark Sea can hold back an idea. Nor can trebuchets or even your mighty Jerak’ho stand against it so easily. Mark my words, the longer the Free States are allowed to thrive, the closer we all come to open rebellion. Already there are rumblings from our allies that something must be done. Etta, Ghoad, Xaros, they have all given orders to sink ships heading for the Free States. I wonder that Your Highness has ignored their demands that we order our admirals to do the same.”
“Yeah.  The companion star, it’s small.  They’re so close to each other, you can’t distinguish between them.  That’s one of the reasons it’s so bright, though.  Because there are two of them. We just didn’t see the other one for a long time,” Tony explained, a slight frown furrowing his brow.  “I don’t know what made me think of that.  Kind of neat, though.”
“Art?” Tony guessed, then immediately regretted that he’d ever said anything when Steve’s bad hand flexed, making him send the fork clattering onto the plate in what had to be the world’s loudest, most accusatory sound Tony had ever heard.
“Better,” Steve replied, pulling Tony closer. He brought his hands up, one still bound with Tony’s, and cupped Tony’s face in his hands.  Tony’s own hands covered Steve’s, holding him there.  Steve glanced around him at the soldiers, the pile of stones in the distance, his friends and family surrounding him, and Tony.  Tony, most of all.   Tony, who made it true.
“How many times did you bang yourself into your garage wall testing the suit again? I forget,” Steve replied blandly.
Tony brought his eyes  back to Steve’s and didn’t break the gaze as he carefully removed the wife-beater t-shirt he’d been wearing.  Underneath, even in the poor light offered by the muted TV, Steve could see fairly substantial scarring.  He sucked in a breath, reaching out, “Tony…” he whispered achingly, “What happened?”
“I—I guess.  I mean.  Mostly, maybe.  I’m just, you know, checking a few, ah, news sites.  Stuff like that,” Tony said, holding up the tablet in one hand and tilting the screen towards his chest so Steve couldn’t see the MIT header on the top of the page.  “Are you going in to SHIELD?”
“Well, think about it,” Natasha said.  “This isn’t all there is, Steve. And this…it can be too much, this life, if that’s all you have.  I think you know what I mean.”
Steve sighed and set his fork down.  See, this was how things started.  Now, he knew Tony had been shut up in his workshop all day.  Which meant Tony probably hadn’t eaten anything, unless you consider coffee a food group.  And this was going to nag at Steve all dinner long, like a kernel of something stuck in his tooth that he couldn’t work out.  Which meant he wasn’t going to be able to sit here and eat his meal in peace, thinking about Tony working himself into oblivion while he enjoyed his meal.
“Speaking of behind,” Rhodey said, leaning forward to peer at the phonescreen Pepper was holding out in front of her.  “Yep, that’s you.”
he flatters me,” Tony muttered, though his tone was light, and his eyes were crescents, soft and crinkled at the corners.  “Is this all it takes to loosen your tongue to compliments? I must admit, if so, I would say that I’ve never been more committed to being showered in praise in my life,” he said, brows rising as the corners of his lips tugged up into a smile.
“Sorry. Can’t be too careful, you know?” she offered by way of an explanation.  Steve thought it was all just rather sad, though he understood Stark’s need for precautions.  Especially for...this kind of thing.  “The keycard will get you into the suite,” Ms. Potts was saying. “Just swipe it over the elevator’s security panel then press the button for the thirty-fourth floor. That will be the Empathy Suite, where Mr. Stark is staying.”
Eventually, of course, he stopped going to the mountain and put away those carefree days along with the other notions of childhood.  There was the farm to tend to, after all, those fields weren’t going to plant themselves, as his mother would say, and she couldn’t do as much as she once had.  He didn’t mind the work, really, and it seemed to help, all the work and being outdoors, at least that was what Bucky said when he suddenly had to look up to Steve instead of down.  Pulled one too many weeds from the garden and decided to grow like one, Bucky would say with a grin, clapping Steve on the shoulder. Though, really, when he had occasion to think on it, feeling better went all the way back to his father’s death, he supposed, as if that had lifted some kind of pall from over him, because he really hadn’t gotten sick again after that.
'There's only three people still alive that have stuck by Tony through everything, Cap. That's me, Happy and Pepper. Anyone else who stuck around through his temper tantrums and mood swings died a long time ago. Everyone else he trusted? They betrayed him or walked away from him.'
‘You saying Loki doesn’t deserve to be happy? After he’s the reason this team was formed in the first place? After trying to take over New York?’
Natasha blinks, trying to hold back her emotions just as she’d been taught all those years ago. It’s a rare occasion she’s glad for her training.
‘What? Since when did you know Daredevil?’ she demands. ‘We’ve been trying to track him down for months.’
‘Shh, hey come on,’ a large warm hand is on his back and another glass is brought up to his lips. ‘Just take small sips, honey. That’s it.’ Focussing on Steve’s voice helps push back the panic at not being able to breathe and Tony’s able to take gradually larger sips until the glass is empty. ‘There you go.’
Before Steve can answer Rhodes raises an eyebrow at them. ‘Really? I’m going to pretend you didn’t ask that.’
Tony’s brain knows that Steve means well. But his gut reacts to the words and he turns on the soldier. ‘Did you not just listen to a word I said? The suit stays with Peter.’
‘Oh, but Wade,’ Francis reappears further ahead, ‘I think you’ll have so much more fun fighting someone you love rather than hate.’
What he sees is nothing he could have imagined in his wildest dreams. It’s a calmly lit room, and the soundproofing is obviously the best Tony has at his disposal as everything becomes muted. At the back of the room he sees a familiar young male’s face looking back at him, the picture taken when they’d known him, probably from some of the security footage taken at the time.
‘We’re on our way,’ Tony reassures him, and the four of them head back along the streets towards the Sanctum, and the sound of the other battle.
To say it had been a hectic few days would be underselling it in Peter’s opinion. When Wade had snapped with the gauntlet made from Tony’s suit and wiped out Thanos’ army the first thing he’d felt had been relief, only to have it replaced by a gut wrenching despair as Wade had fallen to the ground, unmoving, and remained like that for three days.
‘Yeah I know, I’ve had him moaning about it,’ Wanda giggles, pulling her hands away and opening her eyes again. ‘Now come on, Pete, we need to phone Happy and head back towards the facility before they send someone after us. You sure you want to run the risk of
‘I’m starting to really wish you’d grow a beard,’ Tony responds, firing up the boots so he’s now hovering in the air. ‘Don’t know why just suddenly got this urge to see you with a beard.’
Loki smiles at him. ‘I shall bear that in mind.’ As they leave the room Loki places a hand on Bucky’s arm to stop him. ‘Thank you. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t tell Thor about my worries. I don’t want him to worry or to try too hard, he deserves to enjoy this.’
‘Roger that!’ the mercenary calls and makes his way over. Only to be speared in place by Thanos’ sword. ‘Aw man! This guy’s even more of an asshat than Cable is! Hey Scott! Catch!’
‘Well boss has me make sure Miss Wanda has a cup of hot cocoa ready for about an hour after dinner because she likes to sit and relax with it; there’s also a special blend of herbal tea from Sokovia he has me fly in for her because it helps her sleep and I have it ready for her when she goes to bed. He also asked me to make one for Sargent Bucky as he’s finding it helpful too. I have to keep the temperature slightly warmer in Colonel Rhodes’ room as it’s more helpful with the odd cramps he gets from his injuries; and your room has to be a couple more degrees warmer than his. Would you like me to tell you anything else?’
‘Oh come on Brucie-Bear, don’t be like that. It’s only just happened to be fair. Apparently there’s only so long Steve could resist my dashing good looks.’
‘That’s not the point- oh for fuck’s sake!’ Wade flips him over so he’s on his back, the older man pinning his arms above his head. ‘Peter listen to me. This isn’t just about breaking the law, this is about you and me and me choosing to respect the law in regards to you, alright?’
Tony and Hope both shake their heads. ‘He came back after we got out of the whole business side of things,’ Hope explains, ‘too busy being in hiding to worry about potential business partners.’
A/N: Hi everyone. An actual update on time this week! I hope you enjoy this chapter, I think this is one of my favourite ones to have written so far to date. I had the image of Peter facing Thanos with Venom in my head for so long as I was so happy to finally be able to write it.
Vision and Rhodes are standing next to him, and if he didn’t know better he’d say the humanoid was nervous.
But no more bullets hit him. Instead a strange, grey mist curls its way towards them, spreading quickly along the ground and spreading upwards. He sees the moment Steve realises he’s no longer behind them. Sees T’Challa spin and try to head back towards them.
‘Possibly or probably?’ he asks. Vision pauses and Bucky gives a small laugh. ‘Don’t bother, Vision, that’s answer enough.’
Just before they hit the ground he’s able to fire the repulsors and right them, kicking out at Proxima and grabbing hold of Vision, allowing them to land fairly gently on the ground, their enemy staggering to her feet a way in front of them. Tony eases Vision to the ground before planting himself between him and Proxima.
‘You came back early, I know because I was looking back through the security footage and found some that had been deleted and re-recorded. Didn’t take too long to get the old footage back. You’re slacking in your old age, Clint,’ Peter teases him.
‘Not overly well,’ Tony admits. ‘He didn’t come to visit as often as the others, but when he did we always got up to some hair-brained scheme that he’d come up with. Mom caught him teaching me how to make things explode once and nearly threw him out the house, luckily Dum Dum was there to charm her and calm her down otherwise I don’t think he ever would have been let back in the house again.’
‘Shit! Cap we got incoming!’ Clint says. ‘One vehicle heading this way at speed. We need to go now if we’re going to get away without a fight.’
‘May for the last time: we’ll be absolutely fine. You and Stewart go out for your dinner, I’ve got some school work I can be getting done whilst she’s asleep anyway. If I can fight Thanos I’m pretty sure I can look after a baby for a couple of hours.’
‘My thought was we can send them in where we need to get information and then, to help with the element of surprise, either flood an area with smoke or stun our enemies before we go in and finish off the job. It’ll make it much easier for small group missions.’
Peter smiles gratefully and peels the soaked shirt off of him, shoving it into his bag and pulling on the hoodie. It’s a little big but it’s warm and soft, and as the banter starts back up again he can’t help but feel lucky he can count the Avengers amongst his friends.
‘Maybe you aren’t as well informed as you think then,’ Steve spits. ‘I’m sorry,’ he adds, ‘the soldier who has the prosthesis is my best friend, it’s not exactly been easy.’
‘It’s a travesty,’ Peter snorts, then his brain kicks in. ‘What are you doing here?’ He looks to Tony. ‘You really invited him here? Just because I mentioned it?’
you? I’m trying not to be totally shallow here, but Erskine basically went full Rhianna wink meme on Mother Nature.”
“I was thinking,” Tony began.  “Next weekend.  I have some time.  Or, well, I’ll make some time. How about you and me get away for a few days?  Celebrate our… forty-third day-iversary.  That’s a thing.  I’m making it a thing.”
He was going to hell.  That was probably a given.  Might as well just smooth the ride a bit. “Give me an infrared scan,” Tony said with a sigh.  The projection hummed to life on the console next to the bed, Steve’s warm form in red against a blue overlay of the room.  He was sitting in a chair in his living room, just sitting, facing an empty wall.  Tony couldn’t tell if he was asleep or awake, but the television wasn’t on and there was no computer or tablet near him.  “Is he asleep?”
Tony stretched his neck up and checked the time again.  Soon, he thought, scrubbing his face with his hands.  Anticipation heated his skin, lighting up his nerves and making him want to squirm with the effort of waiting.  He could feel himself loosening. Liquid heat pooled behind his balls, making his hole go all soft and pliant, readying him to be filled.  The feeling of emptiness, of being open and empty, coupled with the throbbing pressure in his cock, all deep red and dripping pre-come on his stomach and the hem of the gown, it was almost overwhelming.  Like his mind couldn’t settle on which one to feel and kept jumping between the two sensations, skipping across one, then, unsatisfied, trying the other again.
“I thought you might like to show our new friends a good time,” Ty suggested.  “I know how much you love that.  They’d really like that.  I’d like that, too. What do you say?  A little private celebration?  Just us.  You’d like that, wouldn’t you?” Ty said, running his hand down Tony’s cheek and cupping his chin, tilting Tony’s head up to look at him.  “You’d like to do that for me, wouldn’t you, Tony?”
Barnes.  Again.  Of course, Tony thought with an annoyed sigh.  Because why worry about a batshit crazy alien demigod stealing a few years’ worth of memories when all that mattered was Killer Zorro being decidedly not dead, oh joyous day.  Steve had listened to Natasha’s recitation of the events since New York and the Chitauri with stoic calm, right up until the part about the Winter Soldier’s identity, and then it was like some switch had been flicked and now, four hours and several doctors’ warnings later, Steve was still sitting in one of the Tower’s conference rooms going over everything that had been done to date in their hunt for Red October.
“Put your hands on the mirror,” Steve said, nodding his head towards the mirrored wall behind him.  Tony looked askance at him, then at the wall, tongue darting out to coat his lips.
Tony shifted slightly, wrapping his legs around Steve’s waist. That earned him a soft sigh.  One of Steve’s hands found Tony’s nipple and toyed with it, almost absently, through the gown, until Steve bent his head and sucked the hardened peak into his mouth through the silk, making Tony moan, then pulled back his head and smiled at Tony, that sweet, sloe-eyed, lopsided grin that Tony adored.
Steve followed the stream of Tony’s chatter up the curving steps of the King’s Tower, past the guards, whom he nodded to in greeting, and down the long hallway to his own room. Tony pushed open the door, then came to an abrupt halt, turning around to face Steve. A warm fire was already stoked in the hearth, and a tray of food, still steaming with warmth, and flagon of wine sat on the small, round table that stood between two chairs, clearly waiting for them.
“I thought we were the good guys,” Tony said with a flat grimace.  “I’m sorry,” he added, almost as an afterthought, though he didn’t mean it that way, it just felt like the least of what needed to be said.  “I didn’t do my job, and people died. People you cared about. People I cared about. People someone cared about, anyway, I don’t know. People died, and that’s on me.  I’m sorry, Steve. More than I can ever say, I’m sorry. I’m—I’m trying here, to—to fix it, to…to do something to make this all mean
God, that whole thing had been amazing, Tony remembered with a dreamy smile.  Well, not the kidnapping part, which had been a huge inconvenience and largely annoying.  Actual Fucking Captain America busting down the door and knocking all those goons around, swooping Tony up his arms like they were on the cover of one of those romance novels his mom swore she didn’t read.  That part had been
“It’s not like he’s gonna do anything, Buck.  Just probably yell a bit and say some stuff,” Steve shrugged, “and it isn’t like I can’t take care of myself if he did try anything.”  Were they really talking about that over eggs and coffee?  It suddenly felt so surreal to Steve.  He hung his head, focusing on his plate of eggs, trying to process what was happening so fast.
“What I’m saying is, I’m the one responsible, and if there are…consequences, well. Those should be on me,” Malcolm finished, looking down at the floor like he was hoping it would open up and swallow him.
“It’s a Kodak, as you well know, and Fallon doesn’t want to hear it.  He doesn’t think Americans will buy those ‘cheap gadgets’ as he calls them.  They got the SHIELD contract and sent it over as a thank you.  Daniel’s been making home movies. Of the family, Howard, calm yourself,” Peggy said, her rich, melodious voice, still tinged with enough of an accent to stand out, echoed on the screen.
“I know it makes you feel better,” Steve said, pulling Tony down to the bed.  “Though, I swear to God, if we go down to breakfast in the morning and Clint has that Butterball in a Baby Bjorn, I just might plug the rockets in myself.”
“You do,” Steve agreed with a smile.  It wasn’t quite there yet, but he could see it now.  How it would look when he finished.  “Glad you like it.”
He found himself pressed slowly back toward the bed, until the back of his knees hit the mattress and he was suddenly falling rather ungainly, flat on his back, Tony standing above him.  The shadows cast in the room hid Tony’s features, the glow of the moonlight showing only an outline, but Steve watched as Tony unwound his bowtie and removed his jacket.  So, apparently there was a graceful way to take off a tuxedo.  Who knew?  Tony stopped undressing for a moment and leaned over Steve, bracing his hands on either side of Steve’s head and dipping his mouth down for another kiss, licking lightly at Steve’s bottom lip before taking into his mouth and sucking, leaving Steve gripping the sheets with both hands, his cock riding high and hard between them.  Tony still hadn’t touched him there, and he spared a thought to wonder at that, since he seemed to like touching him so much.  Even now, Tony’s hands were skimming this way and that over his body, which had apparently decided to stop listening to his mind at all and was squirming on the bed, lifting and searching for Tony’s touch.
Steve snorted, and rolled his eyes, keeping up his unhurried movements. He stopped when he was eye level with Tony’s stomach, sparing a look at Tony long enough to watch him suck in a breath before Steve dipped his head and licked the white beads from Tony’s skin.  Salty, slightly sweet, like old pennies, he thought.  Above him, Tony moaned, deep and throaty, and as soon as Steve raised his head, started fidgeting, hands flying to his hair, his face, down his chest, toes curling and legs flexing with the burst of energy.
The thought made his skin heat with a prickly, tingling sensation a bit like feeling returning to a sleeping limb.  He wasn’t truly cold, he knew that. SHIELD kept everything a steady temperature and the serum did the rest. But then, he’d think about Anthony, and it would make him so warm, all over, driving away this phantom coldness.
Steve watched him go, waited until the door closed with a soft snick, then let out a breath he hadn’t realized he had been holding.  His heart was pounding in his chest.  Tony.  Stane was still trying to undermine him, and clearly not especially concerned about his supposed confinement.  He needed to tell Tony, Steve thought, reaching for the door, then stilling, his hand still outstretched.
Turning away from the sink, Tony skirted the kitchen table and started down the hall.  He was halfway to his room when he heard Steve call his name.  He stopped and twisted around, cocking his head.  Steve had shifted on the sofa enough so he was facing Tony.  His face was shadowed by light from the flickering screen still gamely trying to get them to press play or select a special feature.
Tony swam the short distance over to Steve and he, too, laid his head against the side of the rock, his gaze dark and intense as his eyes roved over Steve’s face. Sometimes, like now, Steve could feel the weight of Tony’s scrutiny. Not unpleasant. The opposite, in fact. Sometimes, it felt like Tony was the only one who
Two hours or so later, Steve heard loud voices and thumping footfalls echoing from the stairwell outside the apartment.  Brock’s key scraped in the lock, and he, Jack, Griff, Mitchell and a couple of other guys Steve recognized from Brock’s former unit spilled inside, arms full of beer and various snacks.  Steve sighed and tucked his pencils and sketchbook away.  Looked like it was time for a party.
Tony made it inside the garage, barely, before he slumped over, bending at the waist and tried to swallow enough air to get his lungs to cooperate.  It was like he’d forgotten how to breath.  How could he have messed up that badly? He felt turned inside out, exposed somehow, like one of those dreams where you show up naked and don’t realize it until too late.
“You don’t—we don’t have to,” Tony husked out, studying Steve intently for a moment, eyes narrowed, then dropped his gaze, like he had been expecting to find something in Steve’s expression, but didn’t quite want to see it.  Tony’s looked down and away, eyes skittering across the floor as he shifted back and forth on his feet, then his gaze seemed to drag back to Steve of its own accord.  Tony’s eyes were heavy-lidded and filled with a desolate sort of hope that might have been nothing more than Steve’s own reflection, except that it shifted to something harder, needier, a flash of hunger and lust glittering behind Tony’s dark eyes that sent a spike of heat through Steve’s chest and making his stomach swoop and clench.  Steve could feel himself harden, and remembered the way Tony had looked at him that first night, the feeling it had given him, a sense of power in a world where he seemed to have so little of that.  It wasn’t power that thrummed through him now, not exactly.  Something else, far more potent, he thought.
fishing before, but...why not?” Tony replied, the words coming out too quickly, like he was rushing and stumbling over them.
“Those years...it’s awful to say, isn’t it?  But, they were the best of my life.  Iron Man, he--you, God, that’s--I can’t believe it, but I--yes. Yes, it makes sense, doesn’t it?  In a strange way, it makes sense, I suppose,” Steve nodded, mouth twisting over his gums as he clucked his tongue. “Ayuh, it does.  Maybe some part of me even knew it then.  And I--I loved Peggy, too, mind you.  I did, best as I knew how, anyway, and Angie and the kids.  I loved them all, especially Lizzie.  Have you seen her?  She’s something else.  A lot like Peggy, she is. It was a good life.  A great life, when you get down to it.  But, you--I--Iron Man--”
“People are always quick to believe what they want to believe,” Cam replied, looking away again, a hint of sadness clinging to his voice.  “I want to believe you will be happy here, and that you will make the King happy, and that I shall serve you well, and that one day, the King will say, ‘Cam, you have served my concubine well, and for this, I will give you a reward,’ and I will say, ‘Your Highness, my mother is a hard worker, and she makes the best potato hash you have ever tasted.  For my reward, I would ask that you bring her here, and let her serve you for all her days.’  And he would.  This is what I want to believe.  So, I will,” Cam said, lifting his eyes to Steve’s.
At some point, Tony had changed the bedding, putting down fresh sheets, and hopefully burning the others, Steve thought with a grimace. They both undressed and slipped under the cool sheets, Tony flattening himself against Steve’s back and wrapping his arms under Steve’s, one leg thrown over Steve’s thigh. They stayed that way for some time, Tony running his hands up and down Steve’s chest, light fingertips ghosting over prickling flesh until Steve felt his body start to respond.
The Bellagio was, like most Vegas institutions, both fundamentally terrible and strangely appealing at the same time.  It was impossible to take it all in at once, which Steve wondered if that may have been intentional. The massive fountain and faux garden adorned the front where a crowd of onlookers waited for the nightly show.  Happy pulled the limo under the portico behind the fountain into a line of other cars dropping off their passengers. One of the valets opened the limo door almost as soon as Happy pulled up to the curb, and Steve stepped out onto a red carpet that had been laid between twin lines of golden ropes for the evening’s event.  He reached back to help Tony out while more cameras pointed at them, this time from behind official press tags, it looked like, though he could see cell phones held aloft behind the heads of the press line like they used to hold up lighters at concerts years ago when everyone smoked, and Steve could barely leave the apartment between that and the New York smog.
This might end very badly.  He could just let this go, take the money and figure something out in the meantime.  But, he wanted to see Tony, get some kind of answers.  If Tony only cared about the sex, then why pay for nights when Steve wasn’t even out there?  Why would he care whether Steve had other clients or not?  What he needed was a plan.
Steve nodded and put his hands in his pockets, following a half-step behind Tony across the driveway to the garage where Tony’s modern-day Keep Out sign blinked red next to the door.   Tony cast a quick glance over his shoulder at Steve, who had looked away, obviously deliberately, and for that, Tony was strangely touched.
He met Tony’s kiss with an urgency all his own, pouring everything he couldn’t quite say into it, love and gratitude and desire. Hope.  Dreams.  He would give Tony a future, a house by the sea, the thing he had lost and kept trying to regain without understanding what it was he was trying to rebuild was not made of stone and earth, but something more. Something far, far stronger.
Too many thoughts roiled around in his head for sleep to come easily to him.  The war, Bucky, leaving, the dreams, the dream-walking, the voice...come to me, it said.  Come where? To who? He closed his eyes and thought about slipping underwater in the pond over by Bucky’s house, the way they had when they were children, and thought he heard a nighthawk cry as it searched the fields for mice and shrews, then finally, sleep claimed him.
“That’s where I’m headed.  You should, too.  Sleep, I mean.  You…you did good today, Tony.  I didn’t get to thank you.  For before, I mean.  Getting me to SHIELD.  And then…well, just thanks, I guess,” Steve managed, finding himself looking away from Tony’s stare, which had turned oddly intense.  If he looked at Tony now, he wasn’t sure what Tony would see, how much was written on his face.  He was too tired, too hurt, felt too exposed.  One more quiet, concerned word from Tony and God knows what he’d say.
“Indeed,” Tony said, face going soft.  “They did.”  Steve could feel the words warming his skin, the faint tinge of pride carried on Tony’s tone making his stomach flutter like a bird’s wing.  “Off with you now,” he said, though his tone was light and encouraging, almost teasing, in that indulgent way he sometimes got with Cam that made Steve’s heart constrict. “I will return him to your able care on the morrow, young sir.”
“That’s the spirt. Have a good time,” Tony told him, secretly hoping there would be a wedding in the nearby future. He would take whole responsibility…okay Pepper would get some responsibility in this Hallmark romance as well.
Seriously, thank you everyone who is continuing to comment, kudo, and bookmark this story. I love you all and I can't wait to take you on the journey that these last ten chapters will be :)
“Yeah, I am not letting you get sick from cold spaghetti. Plus it won’t take that long to warm up seeing as though I just put it in the refrigerator not even a few seconds ago. While you wait, you can grab the two bottles of juice.”
“I’m sorry. I do love you and it was very mean for me to leave you. I thought you would like it better with your friends here and everything. I don’t have a lot of things at the Tower.”
“Yes, mother,” Bucky drawled. He craned his neck to the side. “Would you also like to know if the mouth wash I’m using actually gets rid of bacteria?”
Jaime smiled brightly. “Yeah. This is my first shift until three I think. Then I go with Ms. Natasha for the rest of the day. She told me she needed her second in command.”
Bucky nodded his head twice. He still wasn’t certain of Steve killing Ryder, but that may be more so to do with the fact that the deaths he caused were outside of his hand. Maybe if he hadn’t been brainwashed to cause those deaths then quite possibly, Bucky would be readily agreeing with Steve’s decision.
Bucky turned and Ryder was right. His neck had been hanging off. If Bucky had been paying attention, he would have maneuvered Tony’s body to a more comfortable position. It was probably best Ryder had come.
Harley’s mouth widened into a smile and he sprint toward his mom’s room. Steve watched as he entered Bekah’s room. When the door closed behind him, Steve turned away and let himself walk through the hallways. For a few moments he was alone with his thoughts and let the reality of what Bekah was asking to completely settle on him.
Call him insatiable, but in all of his life of past lovers and hookups no one could ever manage to do it like Steve. Perhaps it’s because actual love and care was involved this time…or at least that’s what Dr. Sana had ensured after he went into vivid detail how his first time with Steve was. Needless to say she had been shocked.
“Mmm, where ya goin’?” Ryder questioned feeling the body underneath his arm move. He opened his eyes slowly and peered to look at Tony who was already grabbing some things to get ready to shower.
Tony wiped his face. He didn’t want his face to be so close to Steve’s chest, when he began talking about the next part where things started changing. He situated himself so that his face was lying down on Steve’s lap. Steve went back to running his hands through his hair. Tony allowed himself a few more seconds of this, before he closed his eyes.
He hadn’t meant to say those harsh things to Tony. He had originally been excited to come back to America first to see his family, then to see Tony again. Tony made things better with his jokes, innuendos, and playful jabs at Fury and Phil. Clint would have liked to say he didn’t mean anything, but Natasha was right. At some point this wall he built to protect himself from gaining a family and quickly losing them, fell second-nature to him. Funny how this wall built to protect him was the one that actually made him lose his brother.
So sure maybe emotion stuck heavy in his throat, from how much he wanted it to stay like this forever. Maybe his head felt light from how much his body was laughing and smiling. However, none of those things concerned him, not now when these few things had been all too few between him and others.
He searched his eyes to see, if Tony would give him the answer of what he wanted. All he needed was the resolution that Tony would prefer Ryder dead and he would go back and do it, forget the consequences of marring his All-American innocent persona…those who even still believed in that image were fooling themselves.
“Mr. Stark it is such a pleasure to have you here,” the receptionist said handing him back his ID. “The kids are so thrilled that you are able to make it here. Someday we’re going to have to get you back here so you can do a presentation or speech of your own.”
“I’ll be sure to pass on those exact sentiments,” Steve said grabbing a spoon and taking some soup from Tony’s bowl.
Tony turned to her, shrugging. “Why would we tell you this and have you pinch our ears like you used to, when we did stupid shit like this?”
Thanks for all the support guys. Love hearing from you all, seeing the comments, kudos, and bookmarks. Have a great Saturday and see y'all next week :)
“Not tonight, sweetheart,” he said, hoping the term of endearment would lean him some favor in getting Tony to rest.
“Oh, every side is your best side,” Ryder said pinching Tony on his bottom and making a huge play of it in front of the person who took their picture. He leaned forward and pressed a kiss on Tony’s temple.
thanks to Clint. Steve couldn’t even follow the plot because every thought he had centered on Tony and what he was going to do once he came back. The corners of his lips tugged upward and he had to tilt his head down from Natasha’s inquisitive gaze. His thoughts were so riddled with Tony and how he wanted to kiss him later that he didn’t notice Peter barreling into the room out of breath, with Harley quickly walking behind him.
Tony broke away from Steve’s grasp and headed toward the door. “Got it. Merchant is my safe word. Now, let’s get this over with. This certainly hadn’t been in my plans for the evening.”
Tony reached down into the bathtub and grabbed a hold of the metal drainer, thankful that it wasn’t attached to the tub. He took their moment of shock and went toward them, pushing down the drainer into Rene’s collarbone.
“But the worst thing that you could have ever done to me was not the fact that you didn’t tell me you were on a mission looking for Bucky, hell if it was Rhodey I would have done the same. It was not that we argued over the Accords. But the thing that hurt me the most was when I asked did you know you looked me in the eyes and I could tell that you knew. You knew everything and…”
It would have worked if he wasn’t so drained and his hands wouldn’t have shaken so much from whatever drugs they were feeding him.
“Ah, umm actually I don’t know if you really need me for that. I’m pretty certain that hefty folder you have is actually more helpful than me. I didn’t really keep in contact with my brother. After…after everything he did to my family and to me….” Isak looked down, swallowing a lump in his throat.
Steve had been at the orphanage for nearly an hour and he had spent most of it trying to hide from Natasha’s little black widows. He was pretty sure they were avenging Tony. He knew that Natasha probably didn’t go into full about what happened, but he was pretty sure that one of the little black widows had thrown a Gatorade bottle at his head with just a little force. Now he had a matching bruise on his chin to match the one on his forehead.
“Possibly. And, to some extent, they’d be correct, but it isn’t just your situation,” Tony trailed off, a grimace pulling his mouth down. “The Ul last night… those concubines,” he shook his head, “it… well, it has been weighing on my mind for some time, I suppose. Whether a new Harem Master would be sufficient to remedy the issues, even one that met with your approval. How could I be sure what happened with you and Cam wouldn’t be repeated? The matter will have to be handled delicately, of course, and it will take time. There are a number of concubines who will need to be settled, either in retirement or elsewhere, should they desire. Change is rarely a welcomed guest at the table, but must be allowed a seat,” Tony said, then paused, head tilting as a soft smile formed, his eyes curving into half-moons as he regarded Steve. “See what you have done to me, my soldier?”
older. He’d lived through a Depression as the son of poor Irish immigrants, too sickly to do much to earn his keep, always a burden on his mom and always reminded of it by his father, his life straddled two World Wars, he fought in one, and somehow, he ended up here after only twenty-five lived years.
“I’m not comparing you to him,” Steve assured him.  “I wouldn’t know where to even start.  You’re not--I can’t compare the two of you.  Not like that.”
He thought it would be wonderful, though. If he thought about it.   Which he didn’t. But, if he did, he would think it would be wonderful.  They’d brought Omegas to him during the war sometimes. The war had been long, and the able-bodied Alphas were off fighting, for the most part.  Now, they have medications, apparently. That was what one of the Strike Team mentioned letting his Omega use. But then…he remembered how much they had needed him.  Shy at first. Embarrassed, but desperate enough to agree. Then less shy. Steve had liked that, watching them grow needy and demanding with it as they cycled through their Heat, then soft and pliant under him.  It felt good to take care of them, of course, and he’d liked it, but they’d belonged to someone else or no one at all, but not him, and they both always knew that. It was different. He knew it, and they knew it. It hadn’t meant anything, not really.  Just a fleeting moment of pleasure in between horrors.
He knew he couldn’t avoid Tony forever.  To begin with, they had that gala coming up, and he’d been so looking forward to an evening with just Tony, but now that seemed like a terrible idea.  More to the point, he didn’t want to avoid Tony, not really.  He just needed a bit of space between them while he figured out how to let this…thing…with Tony go.
“Right, Thor.  With the magical mystery cure,” Tony muttered out of the corner of his mouth.  He had almost forgotten about that.  Of course, it would be a good thing.  Really good.   Really, really good.  If he kept telling himself that, maybe he wouldn’t feel like such an utterly selfish pile of shit for not immediately believing it.
“He does not understand the harm he risks with his games,” Thor admitted wearily.  “I am sure this is naught that will last.”
Or maybe Steve knew that all too well, and just couldn't bring himself to walk away. There was a sharp, stabbing pain in Tony's gut making him want to curl in on himself until there wasn't anything left. He realized he had crumpled the paper in his fist as he was rubbing it against his leg and made himself stop.
Steve reached out a hand and ran it down the smooth canvas, then back up and over the wooden bars of the easel.  Extravagant gifts were Tony’s way of rewarding affection.  Steve knew that much by now, though it made his heart cinch to think of it that way.  He had a treasure’s worth of gems and golden adornments in his room to attest to how Tony’s mind worked, though.  Emotion was a currency for Tony, same as any other, and a debt needed to be repaid.
“I believe it was you who made the mistake of not letting go, Sir Archer,” Thor recalled with a slight frown as if he was unsure of the memory.   “It is true that you were woefully unaware that the creature would bite if you touched it there, yet I cannot say I blame the animal for its reaction.”
“You’re a terrible liar,” Natasha replied after a moment’s pause. “But you know that. And you’re trying to sell me this anyway, so I guess you have your reasons. Maybe a few days away will be good for you.” And there it was, Steve thought, feeling some of the tension that had been needling against the back of his spine leave him. “I’ll tell Clint to cover your shifts at the club. He’s got this Robin Hood routine he wants to try out that is truly terrible. Like, amazingly bad. Think ‘Men in Tights’ and you’ll have the mental image, but there’s no telling him that. Ass thinks he’s Errol Flynn.”
Tony looked out the window and saw Jarvis sitting in one of the deck chairs, sipping coffee and apparently chatting with Happy, who must have arrived to take him home.
“My Dad told me,” Tony replied in a thin, careful voice.  He looked up at Peggy, all wide-eyes and, for a moment, Steve could see what passed for a wistful look cross his childish features, like he was opening the first page of a beloved book, where he knew all the words, but they still held magic, even with the knowing.  “He flew him.  My Dad.”
The thong grated a scraping burn down the cleft of his ass as he moved.  He was already so loose and swollen, so ready, and the combination of the feeling of something rubbing over his hole while Steve tugged him up made his hips jerk, which just roughened the sensation all the more as the panties tugged with the motion.  He let out a small, involuntary cry, and watched as Steve’s eyes went wide, knowing, his nostrils flaring as more slick seeped out in response.  God, he was going to be embarrassingly wet.  Not that Steve ever seemed anything other than extremely happy about that situation, but Steve had barely touched him, and he was already a mess.
It surprised him, though Tony supposed it shouldn't, not at this point, really, but it did. The pain, the way it sliced through his skin, down into the bone and burrowing into the marrow, like it could find where he lived if it went deep enough. They were back here again, using papers with magic words to dissolve something that maybe had never been, not really, not in the way he'd thought, except now there was a box full of things that made that a convenient lie.
Tony threw his hands in the air in a gesture of surrender and started haphazardly helping Steve clean up the mess.  Before long, Steve was batting at Tony’s hand while Tony tried to grab at various things with his chopsticks.  “Would you just…geez, you’re like a twelve year old, I swear,” Steve said in exasperation, undermining his attempt at being stern by grinning widely the whole time.  Carrying everything to the kitchen, he packed it carefully in the refrigerator.   Tony leaned a hip against the kitchen counter, watching him.  Steve set the last container in the fridge and shut the door.   It hit him that the evening had shifted while he was packing away leftovers.  He felt a flutter in his stomach, nervousness mingled with anticipation.  Turning around, he lifted his eyes to Tony’s.
“Yes, definitely far better uses for him than fodder for the fighting rings,” the Lord said, running a hand over Steve’s back, between his shoulder blades, then down his spine.  Then lower, spreading him and holding him open for a long moment before continuing.  “Far better uses, I would say.”
“Ummmhmmm,” Tony murmured.  “Good,” he added, his voice slurry and thick.  He arched his neck, biting his lip as Steve pushed his finger deeper.  He stilled his hand for a moment, letting Tony’s body adjust to the invasion, then pumped it in and out a few times, stretching him.  Tony was tight and hot and
“You should’ve been here three minutes ago,” Rhodes said.  “Looked like a couple of seals fighting over a grape,” he added, giving a shake.
He looked around again, ears straining, hoping to hear something, even if it meant he had to get up and run again. Even if it meant something bad was coming.  He thought that might be better than this strange, heavy silence, as if the world beyond the road simply disappeared. That proved to be such an unsettling thought that Steve rubbed at his arms where the flesh raised into hackles. That was silly. The world was still there.  He’d just gotten his bell rung, he thought, reaching up to rub at his ear and coming away with a streak of blood on his hand.  See? That was all.
“Maybe your father knew more than you give him credit for,” Obie observed in a sharp, clipped tone.  “I don’t know what this is, this new Kumbaya crap you’re spouting, or where it came from, but you are not going to drive the company I spent decades of my life building into the ground.  If this, as distasteful as it may be, if it’s the only way to protect you, to protect this company, then I’ll do what I have to do.”
She smiled, wide and knowing.  “I think you’ve been fighting against everything they put in front of you since you got back, and you hate it.  You hate everything about all of this, but you can’t figure out if you hate yourself more.  Fighting for someone is a pretty good look on you, though.  You might try that more often.”

Which was an insane idea, obviously, and yet there was a sketch on a piece of parchment next to three types of fuse materials sitting on the table in front of him and Steve knew it would work, just the way the King said, which was both impressive and annoying, for some reason Steve couldn’t quite name.  He thought he had swayed the King to most of his suggestions, though the King’s faith in his siege engines and machines, as he called them, made Steve reconsider several aspects along the way, and now, he thought as he stared down at the table…what they had reached together was a vast improvement, even he could admit.
“It’s too late to go back to sleep and too early to get up,” Tony observed, finger tracing a pattern across Steve’s stomach, raising his eyebrows speculatively.
They strolled inside the lobby, which looked Italian the way The Olive Garden looked Italian, at least to Steve’s mind, though the glass flowers that clung to the ceiling were, admittedly, rather charming if they hadn’t been just one of a hundred different touches meant to suggest wealth and taste and managing neither.  The rope line took them all the way to the ballroom, where security nodded at Tony as they entered. Strains of music and the hum of the crowd spilled out into the lobby.
“I’m not detecting any viruses, Sir.   I am also unable to determine the sender without more analysis.  The attachment appears to be some type of scientific report by a Doctor Erik Selvig,” JARVIS supplied after a moment.
Steve was watching him intently. He said nothing, but finally tilted his head just slightly, but enough for Tony to take it for agreement. “Okay, say I believe you,” Steve replied cautiously.
“Yes, but you would likely say that if you had lost a limb, so forgive me my skepticism,” Tony retorted, making Steve huff out a startled laugh.
“What did you do to me? That night. What you did that night, that’s what all this is about, isn’t it?” Steve guessed.  “The dreams, the sleep-walking, your voice in my head...you did something to me, didn’t you?  This...claim or whatever you call it.”
They watched movies in Tony’s ridiculously over-the-top media room.  Tony went through some sort of elaborate introduction ritual for his robots that involved him basically saying, “That one’s DUM-E.  If he even looks at a fire extinguisher, throw something at him,” but clearly meaning something entirely different.
“Huh?” Steve managed, blinking at Tony in momentary confusion as his brain finally managed to get some blood flow.  “I guess,” Steve replied finally, squinting out at the Strip and putting away the rest of the paints, mainly to give himself something to do with his hands and keep his body angled away from Tony, which was probably a good idea, considering.
“Go turn your husband’s giant genius brain to mush, would ya?  You’re blocking the TV,” Bucky snorted as he rolled over to reach for the remote.
“Retreat is often the better part of valor, they say,” Steve shouted at it. It ignored him.  “Yeah...well, I was never much good at that part myself,” Steve muttered, earning a huffing snort of apparent agreement from the creature.
Tony wound his other hand into Steve’s hair, pulling his head down for a searing kiss, tongue driving in madly, pressing against Steve’s and thrusting deep, swiping wide before withdrawing.  He nipped lightly at Steve’s bottom lip as he traced a line down Steve’s jaw, shifting his hand to work Steve’s cock in a circular motion as Steve’s hips bucked.  He kissed and sucked his way down Steve’s throat to the cradle of his neck, stretched his fingers out and brushed them against Steve’s balls as his hand worked Steve from tip to root.  He felt Steve tense up, a wracking shudder running through him, and just as Steve’s whole body thrummed and clenched, Tony bit down sharply on the tendon that ran down Steve’s neck to his shoulder, hard enough to leave a mark, while at the same time squeezing and holding the end of Steve’s cock just long enough to stave off his climax, earning a wrecked sob from Steve as he buried his head in Tony’s neck.
“I believe this is the situation we have been preparing for.  You’re safe. You’re in Avengers Tower. The date is November twentieth, two-thousand and seventeen,” Friday said.
He wasn’t sure which one of them he was talking to. Both of them, probably, he thought with a rueful smile and a shake of his head.
“Tony!” Steve shouted, kneeling down next to him.  “Oh my God, Tony, what—are you okay? What happened?  What—God, Tony. Where is it? Where is it? What did he do with it?” Steve asked, looking frantically around.  “Hang on, please, just stay with me, okay? Just stay with me, Tony, please. I need you to stay with me,” Steve pleaded.  He looked up at Tony, eyes wide and wet and bright with terror.
“Did you know that Polaris is really two stars? A bright one, brightest in the sky, and a companion star that stays close to it, all the time,” Steve recited in a hushed tone, like he was sharing a secret.  He leaned close and pressed a kiss to Tony’s forehead.
“Trying to show my dearly beloved here a good time.  Obie, meet Steve Rogers. Steve, this is Obadiah Stane, one of SI’s founding fathers, so to speak and one of my oldest friends,” Tony gritted out.  Steve wondered that Stane didn’t know Tony well enough to see the tension in his profile, but the man seemed to take it all in stride.
The elevator doors slid open and Tony walked briskly down the hall towards Obie’s office, earning a few startled looks from the various assistants and managers who officed on this floor.  It wasn’t as if he never came here, he thought with a huff.  He’d been here when…no, wait, that had been a projection of the building schematic.  Well, practically the same thing.
“You aren’t going today, Small Hands,” Tony said, then tutted a bit at Cam’s crestfallen expression.  “You are to head to the stables this afternoon. I believe you will find something of interest for you there.”
“Pamper you?  See to your every whim?  Listen to you argue, since I know it brings you such joy to do so,” Tony suggested wanly, walking over to stand between Steve’s legs where they hung from the bed.
“Uh-huh,” Rhodey said as he swiped a hand across his mouth, like he could wipe away whatever it was he wasn’t saying.
“So, yes, there are certainly limitations, but a learning AI can take each decision variable into account and pick out patterns and--ah,” Tony broke off, a soft smile forming.
“It was ridiculous, is what it was,” Howard retorted.  “Making a fool out of himself.  Can you imagine what people would’ve thought if they’d found out?  Can’t even control my own son.  He’s signing up for, hell, what was it?  Intro to Computers?  What were you, learning Office for Christ’s sake?  God, that was an embarrassment.”
Steve pulled his hands from his pockets and turned to the railing again, leaning forward enough to make Tony want to remind him what the sign said.  Then, he pivoted on his heels and walked around the opposite side of the car.  Tony had time to wonder if he was getting something out of the trunk before there was as a loud crunching sound that made him immediately think ‘Rocks!’ and hunch over, one hand going to cover his head because that was going to be the difference in an avalanche, sure. This incongruous sound was overlapped by the squeal of metal, the sharp, splintering crash of shattering glass and a roar that sounded like thunder, if thunder arrived on a train. Tony’s eyes and ears were processing input that his brain summarily rejected because none of it made any sense.
“What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Tony demanded with a flare of annoyance, though he was fairly sure it was more directed at himself than Rhodey.
Tony was certainly fine with the situation.  Really, the whole set-up, maybe sans the Friday the Thirteenth cabin of death, was actually rather ideal, at least for however long this little interlude of guilt or lack of interest or whatever it was on Steve’s part managed to last. He’d take what he could get.
“Well, still,” Steve insisted with a light shrug. “Doesn’t seem right. Besides, can’t say I really want to be tabloid fodder myself.”
Steve glanced over at the boy.  Wide, watery eyes stared back at him.  He took a deep breath and followed Zola, while two guards took to his heels.  A jittery nervousness lapped at Steve’s spine and dug into his stomach.  It had been a long time since he felt fear.  After a while with Rumlow and his ilk, it had been too hard to sustain and devolved into something akin to numbness, a hollow victory when he stopped responding to their torments, but those kinds of victories were all he had.  Now, he had the boy’s life at stake, too, and the sudden weight of it was almost too much.
“You realize that you are literally making my point for me.  Anyway, I’m not saying it wasn’t funny,” Steve said quickly, holding his hands out in surrender.  “Not sure I’d shoot for refined, though.”
“Can’t Help Falling In Love With You,” Ms. Potts replied, forehead crinkling with a frown as Steve slid past her into the elevator.
“I’m fine. Really. It’s fine. I’m—“ Steve broke off, looking over to the mismatched shelves where the line of not-bowls sat.  Tony reached out and covered Steve’s fisted hand with his own, giving it a squeeze, and drawing Steve’s gaze back to him.
“I—Steve! Wait.  Damn it,” Tony cursed as Steve grabbed his backpack and brushed behind where Tony sat, headed for the door.  Tony got up too quickly and sent the wobbly chair clattering to the ground, then nearly tripped over the legs.  Well, the furniture was clearly on Steve’s side, Tony thought dully as he raced after Steve’s departing back.  He didn’t know what to say to Steve’s outburst, except that he’d take virtually any crack in Steve’s carefully-crafted wall of neutrality—fucking hell, that was from the lecture.  God, he hated accidentally paying attention.  Felt like he was giving the simpering blowhard a win somehow.
Steve felt the silence hang heavy over the line.  He wanted to offer some explanation to Ms. Romanov, some way to make that seem like no big deal, but was at a loss as to how to do that because he really didn’t know what it meant himself.
‘So,’ Rocket’s voice breaks through the conversation, ‘what is this Christmas crap that Quill has been going on about for like the last month?’
‘I just did,’ Stark replies, shutting the door in Blane’s face. ‘You,’ he jabs a finger at Belinda. ‘Go and get Doctor Strange. Now!’
Really it was a thoroughly chaotic couple of hours, with noise levels higher than those Peter had experienced dealing with a baby.
‘I thought you were going to tell us if it got worse,’ Bucky demands, looking down at Peter, his voice still deadly, as was the look in his eyes.
Thor, in his usual dramatic fashion, lands in front of Tony, the Space Stone is glowing on his armour, and he reaches up and takes hold of it, ripping it from his chest and handing it out. ‘Take it, and I shall return to the battle,’ he says.
‘You’ve had a lot of choices taken away from you, especially recently,’ Steve says quietly, ‘I don’t want to take away any from you here.’
‘Your power is based around the changing and warping of reality, similar to the stone,’ Strange explains, ‘you may be best placed to counter its power should someone get hold of it.’
‘You want to make sure it’s done this time so you want someone to come along and help take out the trash?’ Bucky’s voice comes from the doorway. Both of them turn to look at him as he walks further into the room. Steve notices Bucky’s focus is solely on Wade, and he leaves the two to have a silent conversation. Eventually Bucky looks towards him. ‘I’ll go with him.’
‘Uh….not sure. Maybe? There’s been so many changes I just gave up keeping track,’ he shrugs in response.
Peter frowns in confusion, then goes to pick up the box, his eyes go wide when he opens it. ‘Wow these are for me? How did you get them with the web design?’
‘Is there anything we can do, Tony?’ Steve asks. ‘You’re doing so much for us, there must be something we can do in return?’
is the infamous Wanda Maximoff,’ the woman says, tone cheerful. She has long black, wavy hair with a round face and a friendly smile; dark eyes that send a shiver down Wanda’s spine as they assess her. The woman is wearing a long dark dress with a high collar and walks in a circle around her. ‘I hear you’ve worked out my runes make it impossible for you to cast your spells. You see, Wanda dear, in a given space only a witch who cast the runes can use her magic.’ Wanda sees dark blue light dance across the woman’s fingers. ‘I was quite surprised you didn’t know the fundamentals. Though I will admit to being impressed that you worked it out, toots. I thought you were going to give yourself a migraine keeping up with that magic for a while.’
‘Alright I’m sorry. But seriously, it’s obvious you like him I can hear your heart beat over the phone.’
Bruce shakes his head, turning to look at him and then his eyes widen. ‘Uh…is there something you guys forgot to mention?’
There’s an awkward silence for a couple of moments, then he hears Deadpool sigh. ‘I left a job unfinished once,’ he says, and Peter turns to look back at him. The merc’s head is down, looking at the street below them. ‘It was fucking stupid, but I was running late for meeting my girlfriend for our anniversary. So I left it unfinished and didn’t take out the last target, thinking I’d just deal with the bastard another day.
Although I do have to make a huge apology: one of my readers on FF.net pointed out I'd been spelling Rumlow's name wrong the whole way through the first two chapters. I'm changing it on all future ones first and then I'll go back and edit the previous ones. Sorry everyone! And big thank you to Silvertikal for pointing it out.
‘Much appreciated,’ Nick nods, then heads towards his own car with a wave at the others. T’Challa and Okoye had already left that morning to return to Wakanda, the king wanting to ensure that his people were ready for whatever might come their way.
‘So can I make a request?’ Peter says as he and Matt dodge some shruikens that lodge themselves in the wall behind them.
Tony and Steve creep from the bedroom, quietly closing the door behind them. ‘You got their nightlight on J?’
‘What, no scotch?’ At Steve’s glare Tony holds his hands up in surrender and takes the medicine. ‘Sorry,
‘No you’re here to stare at my ass,’ Peter mutters to himself, glad he’s on the ceiling cleaning up the globs of dough so no one can hear him.
‘Well, I didn’t want to get your hopes up,’ Steve shrugs. ‘Plus it was only yesterday so I haven’t exactly had chance to tell you.’
Peter pauses. He knows he shouldn’t. He knows he should keep going. Tony doesn’t have long. But for just one second he considers it.
Sorry there's no sneak peek this time because I've not finished writing the chapter! What I can say though is: Tony and Wade bond, Tony has 'the talk' with Peter, and there's more Spideypool action!
As a couple of assistants get the drinks sorted, Tony takes the seat at the head of the table and waits for the squad to get settled. Steve clenches his fist as he sees Rumlow take the chair on Tony’s left and points Andrew to take the one on Tony’s right, he and Bucky settle with the chairs near the other end of the table, Sam joining them. As the rest of the team get their drinks Steve takes the opportunity to study Tony, noticing the apparent easy-going attitude on his face, but the slight tension in his eyes and the way his fingers are tapping out a rhythm on the table are confirming Steve’s suspicions that there’s something more to this than Rumlow supposes.
Wade fidgets, then takes a seat on the sofa opposite Steve, looking down at his interlinking fingers when he answers. ‘I need someone to come with me.’
Vision explodes, and Loki covers his eyes, and wishes he could cover his ears at the scream of despair from Wanda.
It starts as a black dot in the sky, then slowly grows into a smudge and, before they know it, the plane is gliding to a stop down the runway. Vision fiddles with the cuffs of his jumper and Tony resists the urge to smack his hands down. He briefly wonders if Pepper ever acted like that, then shakes those dangerous thoughts out of his head.
‘Why are we still watching this?’ Tony asks as Rhodes turns the volume back up on the chat show once Wanda and Vision are out of the room.
There’s a small smile back on Natasha’s face. ‘You really are turning into Papa Stark,’ she teases. At Tony’s frown she lets out a laugh. ‘We need to get all the team together and see what they can come up with.’
‘The Maw is dead, as is the Cull Obsidian,’ Loki says, apparently ignoring what the alien is saying to him. ‘I know Proxima is never far from your side, Glaive. Where is she? Tell me and I shall ease your suffering.’
They look down at the dark haired man, his head resting on one arm, the hand still clutching a screwdriver; the other one is reaching across the desk as if he’s fallen asleep in the middle of typing out an idea on one of his many screens.
‘Well this is what happens when you set up competitions,’ Rhodes laughs, taking a seat next to the girl.
‘Representatives from fourteen UN countries,’ he replies, furiously typing away on his phone. ‘Majority of them are pretty reasonable; they’ve been willing to find middle ground with me. Ross is the primary antagonist in the group, but I imagine he’s been put on the naughty step after his stunt yesterday. They’ll be wanting to show you that they’re willing to work with us.’
‘I’ve met him a couple of times,’ Peter admits with a sigh. ‘When I’ve been on patrol. He’s not causing any trouble-’
Scott and Hope had arrived with Sam just in time for lunch and the team were now all chipping in to getting lunch prepared and the table set while they made plans for the afternoon.
do. I see that wormhole almost every night, I see what was coming for us through that thing almost every night. It’s one of the reasons I don’t sleep well,’ he notices Loki grimace and look down, ‘and the one who made it all happen is finally ready to bring his big guns. This guy has been in my head for ten years; I want him gone and I want us all to still be around to celebrate when he is.’
‘We’ve seen you as part of the team for a long time now, Wade,’ Steve replies, ‘you just didn’t seem to be accepting that. So I figured I’d make it official so you’d believe us. Merry Christmas, Avenger.’
‘No you’re right to be worried,’ she reassures him, rinsing her mug out in the sink, ‘there’s definitely something more to it, but I think it’s something more on a personal level.’
‘But the physical course is also good for agents to learn where our weaknesses are as well,’ Steve brings the conversation back on track, ‘for example Wanda and Doctor Strange are incredibly powerful magic users, however they are not physically strong so have to use their powers to compensate that. For agents to know where physical abilities end and powers then need to take over is another key piece of information for field work.’
Deciding not to take any risks, he grabs the handgun from down the side of the sofa cushion, slips his mask over his head and heads to the door. ‘Who is it?’
As they gather their things to leave Wanda finds she suddenly understands why the others all have a couple of different groups or individuals they train with: training with someone else is much more fun and pushes you to do more. The other plus side, as far as she’s concerned, is it means she gets a little more time to spend with her adopted brother. As always there’s a slight sting of pain and guilt when she thinks of Peter like that. She wasn’t entirely sure how they’d ended up becoming so close, it had just grown naturally over time, and she never thought of him as a replacement for her twin. At one point the similar name, the energetic personality, the joking nature, it had all been so painfully similar that she nearly had looked to him to replace Pietro. But it was remembering what he’d been like when they first met, when he’d been held hostage and used against Tony, how frustrated he’d been with himself, how he’d tried desperately to prove he could do what the team needed him to, how he’d been so determined to protect his friend but he’d doubted himself the whole time. It reminded her so much of how she’d felt when she’d first joined the team after Pietro’s death.
He sighs and goes to the sink to rinse out his now empty mug. ‘I just want things to be the way they were between us, Nat. But I’m not sure they can be. I think I betrayed him more than I realised.’
Steve presses a kiss to his head, cutting him off as his breathing starts to get ragged again. ‘Tony no one is going to take that reactor from you while there’s still a single breath left in my body,’ he promises.
‘Guys, I think Bruce isn’t feeling right, he just said Wade can’t be that annoying,’ Peter looks to Natasha and Steve.
‘Hey kids is this the Decathlon?’ a voice says from the doorway of the classroom they’ve met in. ‘Because I’m looking for a baby genius.’
‘Loki’s a good bet though,’ Natasha says. ‘He could mask the others there, and is a pretty heavy hitter himself.’
The rapid gunfire makes it almost impossible to tell which of them is making the shot before they’ve all shot their first round.
‘It is under control,’ Tony turns to make himself a cup of coffee, trying desperately not to look at anyone and resisting the urge to run out of the room and into a suit. ‘Well mostly under control. I can go for a swim as long as I have time to psych myself up for it. I only freaked out yesterday because I wasn’t ready. Besides it’s only gotten worse again recently because I’ve been getting slightly less sleep than before.’ He manages to catch himself before saying ‘because the nightmares have come back’. Nightmares that now feature a phantom shield in his chest as the arc reactor flickers out.
Just then another machine breaks through from the barrier entrance, obviously one that had been left behind, and it barrels towards the Jotun army and their defenders. Bucky opens his mouth to form a warning when the machine suddenly turns, instead of trampling its enemies it instead turns on its own people, spreading confusion through their ranks and distracting them from attacking the Jotuns.
‘Brother,’ he pauses, then continues, expression unsure, ‘you have not returned to this form because you think that is what I want have you?’
‘Actually,’ he rubs the back of his neck, ‘I don’t. I mean, if you want to then obviously we will but…I’d rather keep it. If that’s alright with you?’
‘Hit me with a sedative,’ he says, feeling the strength returning to his limbs already. ‘I don’t think they know I’m Spider-Man so they only gave me enough for a normal person. Already starting to wear off.’ He looks around and notices one man out cold on the floor, another is lying not far from him, his face is turned away but there’s a suspicious looking red patch starting to grow underneath the body. ‘What did you do?’
dirty, and his feet aren’t sticking to the floor yet so he considers that a bonus. His spidey-senses are telling him to be wary, but nothing that suggests he needs to run out the door.
He doesn’t have chance to say anything else before they’re in a large executive board room, around the table are sat thirteen men and women from a variety of countries. He follows Tony’s example and takes a seat at the bottom of the table.
Pepper rolled her eyes. “As I have told Rhodey, I am going to tell you. You are not leaving until you are discharged. You still have injuries that need to heal a bit more, before you are released. Also we need to make sure whatever stuff they pumped into your system is completely gone, before sending you home.”
Isak raised an eyebrow. “Oh, then who was? Was my dear friend close to the scary man with that shiny arm or that devilishly beautiful woman opposite of him? Please do not tell me wife, Eva, that I described you as such,” he said with a wink to which Natasha pulled out her dagger and discreetly took pleasure in Isak paling.
“No, let’s be honest Steve. Right here with just you, Sam, Natasha, and me. Your love for me made you go against the world, but your love for Tony isn’t strong enough to go against Ryder? If you truly love him, you wouldn’t let a note get in the way of things. I never knew the great Captain America would give up on a fight just because of some words on a piece of paper.”
“We…ah we need to stop before this gets out of hand,” Steve said though didn’t loosen his grip on Tony or stop from mouthing openly at Tony’s neck.
Steve sat down on his bed and stared at his hands. His mind seemed to be at unrest yet his body stayed unmoving. He leaned back in his chair and sighed with frustration. Turning his head, he looked at the time. There was a second where Steve wondered if he had ever been a man worthy to carry the shield. In this moment, he decided he was not.
The three of them left and still made sure to leave behind a generous tip for Harry. Steve walked in front of them as they left so he could lead them to where they were going next.
“Hey, let’s not wake up your baba okay? Let him sleep for a little bit longer, yeah,” he said. He was trying to hold onto Miles’ squirming body, but it was a hard feat to accomplish when one hand was being occupied by Tony’s…not that he was complaining.
“I don’t think that a letter is the best option.” Natasha sighed. Steve looked at her imploringly. “Fine. Write the letter and I’ll send it to Tony, since I know where he is right now. But that will not be the end. That is only the beginning. ”
That meant Tony was abused and boy guess it just seemed he attracted all the right people, first his father…
Instead he choose to lean languidly against the door frame, arms crossed loosely against his chest. There was a moment of stillness as he looked at Tony’s face lit by the cool hues that radiated off of the StarkPad and listened to the muted voices on the television. Tony only became alert to his presence as Steve rasped his knuckles gently against the door frame, alerting Tony that he was here.
As he focused on the door, he noticed it open more slightly. He raised himself on his elbows, defenses already high. He wondered if somehow Ryder had come back and now was going to take him again. Thankfully, before he could allow himself to become submersed in that strain of panic, he saw blonde hair that accompanied a body.
“It wasn’t a healthy relationship? Pray tell me what you mean by that? I distanced myself from him, but from what I heard he had at least changed his behavior what with all his service as a doctor.”
Cali bit her lip and played with her fingers. “I can’t. Last time I get in so much trouble for letting you escape. And the driver that I sent you to, Ryder found out and he got punished more severely. I only got a light tap in comparison to his punishment.”
“Tony.” That time it was Natasha’s voice breaking through and knocking against Tony’s head like a warning sign.
“Alright, then tell me what you’re bringing to Italy or what you have planned,” Steve broke away from a moment to instruct, before licking a stripe at the underside of Tony.
Clint looked at the ceiling. “Ah, I remember when Laura would give me the silent treatment. She could last up to a month. But I have to say it made the making up part a whole lot more fun, if you know what I mean.”
“Because the next day he got back with Pepper. Didn’t really seem like something to tell you anymore. Plus he was drunk and I didn’t want to hold that against him. But looking back there have been some instances where anyone could tell he liked you, but of course you didn’t.”
Ever since then the two could be seen coloring together in Tony’s lab, while Tony was working on some schematics for SI.
Miles didn’t answer and Tony tried pulling the covers away from Miles’ face. “Hey talk to me. Is it something that I did?”
“Oh, I am quite the opposite,” Steve said. He placed his hands on opposite ends of the chair Ryder was in. “I’m just getting started.”
Peter’s own eyes glistened with unshed tears as he watched his uncle finally get his hands on this ring that he had been going back and forth with Shuri about.
“My question to you is why you are settling on the what, instead of the why. Seems like a curious genius like yourself would want to ask more questions. I assume, that I unfortunately fell right into your trap, which made me give a verbal confession. Of course I know, if that is all you came for you would have hightailed it out of here as soon as I revealed myself.”
Natasha hummed in the back of her throat and settled for a more comfortable position. She had no idea where this conversation was going or how it was related to him not signing the Accords, but she had told him she was going to listen and that’s what she was going to do.
“I’m making a trip to the orphanage. It’ll do you some good to get out, so you’re going to come with me. I would let you go straight to the tower, but I want to actually make sure you don’t somehow be stupid and talk yourself out of it. So you’re going to be fucking attached to my hip. Also do something with that beard. You’re starting to look like a stalker out of some lifetime horror movie.”
“Thanks Happy,” Tony told Happy as he stood outside of the car. “I think you can pick us up around one, but I’ll notify you if anything changes of course.”
Ryder tried wiping his tears again and this time Tony didn’t bother refusing. Ryder leaned closer to Tony. “I’m sorry. Tell me what you want.”
“Aren’t you two supposed to be with Natasha?” Tony said trying to catch back his breath. Running away from Steve was an exercise in itself.
Natasha pushed her body forward and motioned for Steve to help hold Tony. Tony’s limbs thrashed and Steve had to wrap his arms tightly around his body to keep himself restrained. Steve could feel the tremors in Tony’s body as he slowly began losing his energy.
“But…but he can get his head stuck up in the clouds and all, you know?  Big ideas, big dreams, big risks…This…this clean energy thing,” and he said the way Steve’s mom had talked about Mrs. Rushman down the hall when she started in with selling homemade candles.  “See, we’re a weapons manufacturer, Steve.  Always have been.  That’s our bread and butter.  I helped build this company from scratch, when we were barely able to cobble together bullet casings, and now…now Tony gets kidnapped and comes up with some crazy idea and I think, I really do think, that we get that sorted out, but then…well, you come along and now all of sudden Tony’s the clean energy svengali, wanting to bring hope and change to the unwashed masses, and we’re shutting down production on those lovely, profit-producing smartbombs.  You can understand my concern, right, Steve?”
“Boss was up early this morning,” Happy reported. “Haven’t seen him up and about like that for awhile.  Has some project going.  Something big, he said.  Sometimes, when he gets some idea in his head, he’ll forget everything that isn’t those machines a’his.  Well.  Most everything,” Happy clarified, giving Steve a quick glance in the rearview mirror.  “Used to do that all the time.  Been awhile, you know?  Since he’s been all excited about something, I mean.  Afghanistan,” Happy said at Steve’s questioning look, as if that word explained everything, and Steve supposed maybe it did.
“Right. Of course you will. Some kid from Brookland with no name, no money, no lands, no nothing really, except himself to offer, marrying the King. Turning into someone with an enormous amount of power and responsibility virtually overnight?” Bucky asked, pitching the question in a high, speculative tone. “What’s not to enjoy? Nothing there that would worry you, right?” Bucky paused a moment before continuing, as if he expected Steve to offer some kind of response, but there wasn’t anything he wanted to give voice to. What was there to say? He knew that marrying Tony meant becoming a symbol, belonging to the Realm in a way few were allowed to do, and that was an honor. Of course, it was.
“If there is something you want, Tony, you know you only need to tell me,” Steve said, looking across the table at Tony, who squirmed in his seat under the scrutiny.
“Tony?” Steve asked, dropping his hands and stepping back. “Are you still hurt? I thought the cradle…”
“In the meantime, he’s locked in this dreamstate—coma, is what the doctors are calling it for lack of a better word—but the mind isn’t meant to deal with this much altered data being sort of constantly dumped into it,” Bruce said again, though slower this time than when he’d they’d first gotten Tony onto the Quin-Jet. “It’s too much.  The brain is designed to have some downtime, you know, and this constant overload, it’s…he’s…it’s not good, Steve.  Real not good.”
“Yes,” Bruce shouted from across the living room where he was eating his omelet.  “This is different.”
When he came, it hit him so hard, his vision whited, and he let out a shout that he thought might have been a name.  His body curled around Tony as Tony worked the last of it out of him.  He was shaking, he realized, when he was able to realize anything again.  Cold, all of a sudden.  Hands were on his skin, then, rubbing vigorously over his arm, back and thigh until the chill passed.
“I know,” she repeated, gentler this time, with something like sadness etching across her face as he caught her gaze again.   She pushed herself off the bench and braced a hand on the bulkhead that jutted out over Tony’s head.  “He likes it, by the way. When you poke at him,” she said, giving Tony a measuring look.
“Why am I picturing something Inspector Gadget-y?” Steve replied dryly.  “Maybe with one of those buzzer things attached to it?”
“There you go, relax for me, gorgeous,” Tony whispered, all hoarse and sultry now, like one of those old-timey singers in a smokey jazz club.  Steve preened under his gaze.  He couldn’t help it. It was so nice to feel...this way.  Whatever this was.  Tony kissed him again, hard and swift, as his fingers left Steve’s hole wide open and gaping.
“Yeah, and now he just got to see it up close and personal,” Bruce replied grimly, then shook his head slightly, as if that would dislodge whatever concerns he was clearly having.  “Look, you just rest for now, okay?  When you wake up, we’ll see if you’re up to visitors or if I need to put Thor on the door.”
“We all are,” Steve replied, a rough, choked sound that was almost broken, because it was true, and that was the hardest part.  When they made a mistake, innocent people paid the price.  You could talk yourself through good intentions all you wanted, but the job meant risk, and you weren’t the only one taking those risks.  What they were up against, it demanded that of everyone, whether they agreed to it or not, and he knew that, he did, but damn if it wasn’t hard to see it happen and know there could have been another way but they’d picked the wrong door.  “But Tony, you can’t shut me out because you don’t want the argument.  It’s just going to get harder, you and I both know that.  These choices…we have to make them impossible.  That’s the way they should be.  Wrong or right, we’ve got to earn them.  That’s the only way we’ll be able to look at ourselves when this is over.”
He had to give Steve credit for always wanting to understand the technology he was expected to utilize, or, if not fully understand it, at least come to grips with what it could do and how best he could put it to use.  God knew, Tony loved to talk about his tech, and a willing ear was a rare thing.  When they actually managed to find a shared topic, they tended to manage surprisingly productive and engaging conversations, though not without their disagreements.  Though, to be fair, he was pretty sure Steve had goaded him into the whole Star Wars/Star Trek debacle by deliberately confusing the two then going all wide-eyed innocent when Tony went apoplectic.
“So…last night, it was…okay?” Steve asked before he could stop himself.  Shellhead made a sort of chuffing sound, and one of Shellhead’s tentacles bopped him lightly on the side of his head.
--was definitely humanoid in appearance.  Head, hair, face, eyes, mouth, nose, all in the same basic places, though its ears were more firmly fixed to the side of its head.  Shoulders, arms, chest, and waist, all relatively humanoid, though, well...okay, not many humans actually looked like
This one, though, so plain and simple.  Functional, Tony’s mind supplied.  He didn’t like it, and he didn’t like that he didn’t like it.
“Why don’t you show me, then?  You brought your armor up here.  Isn’t that what you wanted?  To show me?” Steve pressed.  “I want to see you.  All of you.  Please?  Show me.”
“Right.  Right, well, as I was saying,” the professor continued, giving Tony another long look before launching into some spiel about isolationism.
“Oh, you think I should have some, too?”  Tony asked, taking a bite from the end.  “Thanks.  Yum!  See, we eat it, we—“ Steve pushed the breadstick back to Tony’s mouth.  “Yes, thanks, lovely.  Okay, Tony’s full.  Your turn,” he said, turning Steve’s hand back towards Steve’s own mouth.  Steve pointed it back to Tony’s mouth and started bouncing anxiously in Tony’s hands.
“I didn’t know what you liked,” Steve said over his shoulder as he dug a wad of bills out of his pocket and handed a few to the driver.  “Hope something here is okay.”
“Sleep,” Tony repeated, then turned and pulled Steve by the hand towards the bedchamber.  When they reached the bed, he nudged at Steve’s shoulders with a grunt, then gave Steve a satisfied look when Steve sat down heavily on the bed.  “Sleep, my soldier. Rest your mind from all of this.”
There was a chorus of agreement that Steve barely heard.  It hurt, what Brock had done, but the weird thing was, Steve realized, it didn’t hurt like it probably should have.  Instead, there was just a dull-edged, numb sort of acceptance in the space where the hurt should be.
When they did stop for the night, finally, Steve stood there, swaying.  His legs quivered and shook, like they were trying to rid themselves of the pain and couldn’t manage it.  If he looked behind him, he was fairly sure he would see a line of bloody footprints marking the rounded line of road between the wheel wells.  He sat where he was, in the middle of the road.  No one disturbed him.  It wasn’t as if he could run off.  Someone gave him a skin filled with water.  He drank it too quickly, choked and coughed some up, then forced himself to slow his swallows.  A hard hunk of bread landed near his foot.  He brushed the dirt off and ate it in small, careful bites.
“You just seem…”  Tony started, then grimaced.  “You seem like you’d be the toppiest top to ever top, okay?”  Tony muttered, flopping down on his back on the bed beside Steve’s leg and staring up at the ceiling, before hazarding a glance up at Steve, who was giving the Furrow of Disapproval a workout.  “Some guys, they don’t want to, which is fine, whatever.  I like both, and I like to make my partner happy, so it’s no big deal.”
Rumlow smiles in what he must assume is an apologetic manner. ‘Forgive me, Mister Stark, I should not have assumed you knew the structure of my squad. There are seven members including me, Barnes and Rogers are only assigned to me whilst they prepare to return to active duty.’
A/N: Hello everyone. Firstly I am so sorry to everyone who has left a comment in the past two weeks for not responding yet. I'll be honest I don't have a good excuse, just that I've gotten distracted by writing that I had completely forgotten I needed to respond. The next instalment is proving difficult to write so I've been taking inspiration where I can. I will be responding this weekend I promise.
Peter is quiet, looking out of the window as he takes in what his mentor has said; Tony lets him think, looking back to watch the rest of the team as they start tidying up the common area ready to head upstairs to the dining area when dinner is ready.
‘When they went in the owner greeted Tony like an old friend, and then made such a fuss of Wanda I hear she nearly cried. She told me the owner gave her a free slice of cake and sat with them and asked all about her time at the facility. She even joked that she needed to tell her if Tony was being too hard on her and she’d sit him down and set him straight. When they came back it was as if a dark cloud had been taken away from her. They stop there on their way back from every demonstration now, and she’s taken me there several times.’
‘Nah,’ Bucky chuckles, shaking his head. ‘I’m still going to beat him bloody if he upsets you, and God help him if hurts you.’
‘Because you’re a jerk,’ Steve says, grinning. Tony just sighs and shakes his head as the two start bickering. Who knew bringing everyone back would just give him more headaches?
‘You two should become friends,’ she points between the two rulers, ‘you’ve both got exactly the same problems.’
‘I’ll continue to look at what was in that gas they set off,’ Bruce picks up the conversation again. ‘So far, I can’t work out what it was, but whatever it is has to be strong. At the moment I’m leaning towards some form of mutation of a sedative.’
Loki sighs, casting a critical eye over the figure standing in his palm searching for any flaws. But she’s exactly as he remembers her, he’s spent a good deal of time creating this image, and even the smile is the same soft, loving smile he misses so much. ‘It’s our mother,’ he answers the question, offering the figure to Bucky for him to take a closer look.
‘I would never doubt you, sir,’ the assistant replies, and he can’t help the smile at the drops of sweat he sees gathering at the young man’s hairline. Good, if even his most loyal workers are worried about upsetting him then it will be nothing compared to what his enemies will soon feel. ‘What are your next orders, sir? Shall I speak to the scientist or to our associates in the East?’
‘Tony?’ he looks up at Steve as he kneels in front of him, worriedly taking in his quick gasps as he fights for air.
‘Even if he doesn’t I do,’ Valkyrie rolls her eyes, ‘we’ll be fine. Now can we please get this show on the road? Any mushy goodbyes and I might rip someone’s throat out.’
‘No Tony,’ Natasha cuts in before any of the others can. ‘Wanda, Vision and Strange all agree there’s no way we could have predicted this would happen, and it was best it happened now when she had better control than earlier, otherwise the effects could have been catastrophic. If she didn’t have the kind of control you’d helped her get we probably wouldn’t be having this conversation now.’
‘Then I suggest,’ comes a deep voice from behind her. ‘That this time you do not let something come between you all.’
There’s a genuine smile on Loki’s face. ‘I would indeed. I thank you for the kind offer; if I choose to stay I shall likely take you up on it.’
Instinctively, Peter reaches out to grab him, their hands locking as Peter feels the tug in his other arm, and he swings the soldier towards the end point. Praying he’s timed it well enough he lets go of his own bar.
Peter pulls her into a one armed hug, putting his own spoon back in the tub. ‘It still feels like you’ve only just lost him doesn’t it?’
Between the four of them it doesn’t take too long and they’re able to start trying to organise how to drag the tree back to the front of the facility before it gets completely dark.
‘Because it’s the only one he learnt all the way through,’ Loki sniggers. ‘He doesn’t know any of the others well enough.’
‘Captain America’s here, maybe he’ll keep him under control?’ Even Ned doesn’t sound convinced by his own suggestion.
Tony grins. ‘Oh yeah, that’s what I said to Uncle Gabe. And I was only five at the time. The tongue lashing she gave him I swear the guy was crying by the time he left, it was only the fact I was there that I think she didn’t put her shoe up his backside for good measure.’
‘Again, I’m going to try and trust the kid and see what he comes back with when they’ve done some more digging. If there’s one thing I can be certain of it’s that if Ned’s involved he’s going to be super cautious so his friend doesn’t get hurt.’
‘You’re looking pretty spry for a dead guy, Hammer,’ his voice is even, but his heart is racing. ‘To what do I owe this unfortunate turn of events? I don’t owe you any money do I? Please don’t tell me you want a job. I’m afraid there’s no vacancies at Stark Industries right now.’
His phone pings again a couple of minutes later; it’s from Weasel and Peter bursts out laughing at the message, showing it to Wanda.
Bucky lifts his flesh hand to his face and finally feels the tears falling. ‘Huh.’ Then he tells Steve the story of the mural.
‘Considering you’ve been working for HYDRA I don’t think you can be saying much on that front,’ Natasha says. ‘Any last words?’
‘You were right, Steve,’ Tony says quietly, looking at his partner and seeing the blue eyes cloud in confusion. ‘We never should have signed the Accords, we never should have let ourselves be controlled by the government. I should have seen this coming. I mean, damn it, I had the foresight to keep the Iron Man suit out of their hands-’
Peter frowns as the driver pulls up outside the building, the flags of Wakanda flying above the doorway. ‘Why are we here? We’re supposed to go to a hotel.’
‘Come in,’ Natasha calls, not looking up from her tablet as she scans some of the information Strange and Wong had brought over; Tony had gotten FRIDAY to scan all the books and upload them to the facility’s framework so they could read it in their own time.
‘I’ll fly,’ he says as he enters, stepping out of the suit and letting it fold up behind him. ‘Close the door FRIDAY.’
Tony can’t hold it back any longer. His hands grip the front of the man’s hoodie and his breath hitches as he tries to keep his emotions back. As Bucky’s arms tighten around him and he presses his lips briefly to the top of his head, Tony feels everything come out.
Stark laughs. ‘My assistant would you believe. She’s the only one who can actually get me to do the stuff that needs doing and not murder me in the process. She’s also a saint and one of my best friends. Speaking of which,’ he sighs again and comes over to the bed, ‘I had one of yours pay me a visit and tell me what was going on. I’m sorry.’
‘You know what? I don’t want to know. Don’t tell me anymore,’ Peter puts a hand up; then he frowns. ‘How many have you got left to do?’
‘Well it’s certainly been an eventful Christmas so far,’ he laughs, one arm going around Tony’s waist.
‘For making sure that Pepper was going to have the dance with me,’ he clarifies. ‘And I’m sorry for what I said before.’
‘Charming, Pep,’ Tony rolls his eyes as the woman leaves and the dark haired man sits on the space she’s just left on the bed. ‘Bucky-’
‘Well…depends on your point of view,’ he shrugs. ‘I mean he listened well enough that we never got caught again.’
Steve shrugs. ‘Bucky was happy to go with him, and Nat’s going to be support. If those two can’t handle it then I don’t know who could.’
‘See you on Monday!’ Ned waves, a big smile on his face. No one says anything until the front door closes behind him and he disappears out of sight up the stairs to his flat.
‘Well yeah, but you weren’t wrong,’ Wade wraps another arm around him and pulls him closer, reaching up with a finger to tilt his chin up. ‘You see someone like me and your first reaction is to see if you can help them, Pete, if that doesn’t make you someone special I don’t know what does.’ He leans down and captures Peter’s lips with him own. This kiss is far less unsure than any of the others they’ve shared, and Peter feels his body melt against the mercenary’s. He’s pretty sure if Wade wasn’t holding onto him, he would have fallen in a puddle at the man’s feet. And that is definitely something he didn’t need Bucky to see.
‘I didn’t say you’d get annoyed I said you wouldn’t be happy with what anyone else did,’ Steve interrupts him.
He turns, shaking his head as Deadpool wrestles with the two on the floor, knocking one unconscious and putting the other in a strangle hold.
‘Alright what did I do this time?’ he asks, wondering if he can fake an alarm to get him out of this situation. Maybe send a message to Peter asking him to call him with a pretend situation? No, the kid can’t lie even if his life depends on it.
of persuasion for the committee to allow it; and the two of them had had several conversations to make sure that any conditions put in place were only what she was comfortable with.
She pauses, wondering how best to word what she’s been battling with in her mind for years now. ‘I don’t really know their full potential,’ she admits, ‘and I don’t know if I can control them or not and I’m worried…I’m worried that
‘Well,’ he sighs as she carries some of the boxes down to the common room and leaves their sight, ‘at least you tried, kid.’
He’s overdone it. They’ve gone further along the bars than he thought so when he lets go, he smacks into one of the supports as Steve brings them to a halt. The impact knocks the wind out of him and his grip on Steve’s hand loosens.
‘Everyone is on their way, estimated time of arrival for last person is three minutes. Call coming through now.’
‘What about the people we pulled from the lab?’ Wade asks as they start to make their way to the jet, Bucky still supporting him as his leg finishes healing.
He enters a room filled with glass cabinets and lots more shelves, most of which are filled with different weapons and artefacts.
’ he gestures to his head, ‘and at the moment it doesn’t look like you can either. At least not in the time we have left.’
The boy seems to pause half way to the wall and sighs before responding. ‘I used to want to take dance classes when I was younger, street dance and stuff like that rather than something like ballet, but we could never afford it and I wasn’t what you’d call a natural either. I haven’t really tried since I got my powers, but it’s not like I need
A/N: Hi everyone! Sorry for the short chapter to finish off the story with, I hope you enjoyed it! Next week will see the epilogue and the return of two characters we haven't seen in a while as they meet up with some absolute a-holes. That's all the sneak peek you're getting I'm afraid!
Vision pauses, realising he has to weigh his next words very carefully. ‘You may find yourself hearing it more if you decide to stay here a little longer. I have found, although they tend to hide it behind jokes, this team cares deeply about each other, and if they accept you then you will be able to experience that as well.’
‘Fine,’ Tony sighs, ‘but I’m paying for the second one. I mean…’ he suddenly looks unsure, which is not something Steve is used to seeing on his face, ‘if you want another one that is.’
‘Huh,’ Bruce says, feeling a little of the guilt he feels over Ultron starting to fade away. As he turns to leave he pauses. ‘Hey kid? Nat says you’re a huge science fan, why don’t you come by the lab some time and we’ll do some work together?’
‘Anyway,’ Bucky cuts in before the two of them can start a full argument. ‘How do we know it’ll help me?’
‘Bucky why is this suddenly so important?’ Steve asks with a sigh from where he and Tony are sat on a sofa; Thor is in a chair opposite them and Sam is in another, the aforementioned soldier is the other side of the breakfast bar to him and Peter.
‘To be fair the bar is a bit crowded,’ he replies, gesturing at the area which is about three people deep. ‘I suppose a half-price bar is a good thing?’
‘I think we should help this attractive man,’ the quiet one adds, ‘he looks to be a worthy warrior.’
Pepper laughs. ‘He might have you all wrapped around his little finger, but he’s still scared of an unhappy Natasha.’
‘Oi! Lovebirds! Pass the bread rolls,’ Sam shouts at them, causing Steve to flip him the finger and the whole table to erupt in laughter.
Sam frowns and then sits on a crate, patting the space next to him. As Peter cautiously climbs down the rest of the way to sit next to him he asks FRIDAY to let the others know he’s found Peter and they’ll be back soon. ‘From what I gather, kid, you and Tony have a bit of an interesting history, and it sounds like at some point he made a rash decision that means you feel you have to constantly prove yourself to him. Am I right?’
‘Like hell I can’t!’ he shoots back. ‘Mr Stark needs help!’ Then he looks down at the phone in his hand. There is someone else he can call.
‘I believe the quote was,’ Val looks down at her notes, ‘ah yes here it is. “No one would be exempt from the registration, even if they are someone’s precious intern and think they may have protection from other individuals.” He then went on to say-’
‘They said they bet I wouldn’t drink enough to get drunk since I’m a goody two shoes. So I drank the whole bottle!’ Peter sounds very proud of himself.
Steve stop him from walking past and says quietly, ‘I mean it, Tony. No one’s splitting us up again.’
of you. Maybe the link was making you feed off each other’s frustration and hurt and that made everything worse.’
They sit there for hours quietly talking over everything that had happened with the Accords. By the end of it Tony’s feeling emotionally wrung out and absolutely exhausted, but he also feels a little lighter; the sun is just starting to lighten the sky when they finally stop talking.
‘You are right my brother-in-arms,’ he claps a hand onto Wade’s shoulder, ‘I would have enjoyed a hunt again. But it seems not everyone here was in agreement and, truly, hunts are only enjoyable when you have a group of you to partake. Besides Tony and Steve have promised me a fitting substitute, and as long as we have enough food to feast to our hearts’ content I shall be happy.’
Tony gets a message sent through, and the team find themselves having to hurry to save their youngest member.
‘Especially when Loki is joining them,’ Wanda adds, there’s a round of laughter from the other students in the group.
‘I’m sure we would have had tons of fun terrorising you together,’ he says, ‘I hear that’s what brothers are supposed to do to their sisters.’ She laughs in agreement and they both pick up their spoons again, turning their attention back to the film.
‘Isn’t it?’ Sam cuts him off. ‘Don’t bullshit me, Bucky. I’m not taking it any more. You don’t think you deserve happiness because of all the people you killed? What about the guy over there that used to build weapons for a living and got named the Merchant of Death? What about the borderline insane merc who killed more people than probably the rest of this team combined? You’re saying they don’t deserve to be happy and make their partners happy?’
‘At least you still call me “young man”, Mama,’ Tony laughs, pressing a kiss to her wrinkled cheek. ‘Which is more than most of this crazy lot do. Now, Mama Rhodes I’d like to introduce you to Steve Rogers.’
‘Aright, Pete you take your group up to their rooms, we’ll get everyone else settled in. Meet in Briefing Room Five in thirty minutes. Don’t be late!’
‘Not usually,’ Loki laughs, ‘but you are doing well for your first time. Just don’t change careers to a chef any time soon.’
, I have been overruled and the Council agrees with you. If you can find a way to communicate this agreement with all parties and get their consent, they can come home.’
Peter laughs. ‘Yeah how about no? I have no sense of rhythm at all, trust me you do not want to see me trying to dance.’
‘Seriously?’ Tony scoffs. ‘I’ve wanted to do it since you went all determined Captain America with the Accords.’
‘What can I do for you, Nat?’ he asks, not looking up from where he’s buried in the internal workings of one of the War Machine suits. ‘Ow, dammit,’ he curses pulling one of his hands out and shaking it.
A/N: Hi everyone! Hope you enjoy the start of this Christmas special. Each year I do a special I want to gift it to two readers who are some of the most loyal commenters an author could ask for, but this year I had to do three. Thank you so much for always giving me a smile each week with your wonderful comments, you have no idea how much I appreciate them!
Tony freezes. There’s only one person left with an override code, and he’s not sure he’s ready to face him either. The door opens and Bucky steps in, closing the door quickly behind him.
‘I’d hoped we still were,’ Steve admits quietly, looking down at the carpet. ‘But now I’m not so sure it’s possible.’
‘We already promised to protect your people,’ Steve reminds him, ‘and we will continue to do so. The same goes for Loki.’
Bucky nods, and closes his eyes as he concentrates. ‘He’s alright, he’s with Tony,’ he tells Steve. ‘Sounds like they went down one of the other tunnels. Tony says sorry for not having the chance to put comms in these suits.’
‘Oh man that’s better,’ the helmet stays down so Clint can see the look of relief on his face when his lower body gets the support it needs. ‘Hey Clint? Thanks man.’
‘Don’t worry,’ Tony comes to stand next to him, ‘we’ll go check out the runes, check to make sure they’re just really old graffiti, and then we’ll head back to the hotel, get in the Jacuzzi together and warm up. Alright?’
Strange sighs and holds up his hands which, Tony notices now that his attention has been drawn to them, are trembling. ‘I can’t do activities like this with these hands.’
attempt at getting this infection under control. Hopefully we’ll be able to take him in for surgery in a couple of days. Can I call you when the arm needs attaching? I assume you don’t want to trust anyone else with this?’
They continue to bounce ideas, some serious and some not, and Tony lets his head fall back against the sofa. He closes his eyes for a moment when they start to sting.
‘I’m sure we have Mr Parker’s presence in our school for the choice the Avengers have made,’ Mr Harris gives him a grateful smile, but Peter is too busy trying not to be sick to take it in. ‘We’ll be taking part in different activities, seeing how the team works, and will get the opportunity to meet most of the Avengers themselves. Plus, we’ve got a new student starting that week so it’ll be a fantastic opportunity for them to meet everyone. Now I want you to make sure you all get your parents to sign these slips, the trip is happening in two weeks…’
?’ the teen takes a couple of steps closer to the two men. It’s the first time he’s seen the mercenary without his suit on: he’s in jeans and is currently taking off a thick winter jacket. ‘What the hell is
, Cap. And if you think I’m not going to be there when we hunt down the prick who threatened Peter you have another thing coming.’
‘I wasn’t suggesting we bring them back and pretend nothing has happened,’ Tony tries to get his voice back to normal, but there’s still an edge of frustration there. ‘The Avengers had to change. We knew that, that’s why we signed the Accords. We have to show everyone that we’ve learned from our mistakes and we can still protect them. Besides I was one of the guys they were fighting. I need to know I can trust them as much as they need to know they can trust me.
‘Only thanks to you I assume?’ he asks, using his metal arm to rip aside the debris until eventually he’s able to pull Wade from the wreckage of the warehouse.
‘You should be freaking out,’ Wade croaks. ‘Why are you not freaking out? I’m going to have to fucking freak out for you!’
‘And unfortunately he has to eat at least twice as much as the rest of us because of, uh, his job,’ Ned supplies.
making a liar out of me, Wade Wilson. We’ll get the trucks and everyone on them over to the jet. Then I’m coming back for you and when I get back we are
‘I have one on me,’ he replies, ‘but it’s not got flight capacity, only going to be useful as armour. I’ll give it to you once we land.’
‘Moving on,’ Natasha interrupts. ‘Who were the suggestions for the other two? Steve was mentioned yesterday.’
Stephen sighs and shakes his head as the door closes. ‘He’s always like that. Come on Bucky let’s get you transferred so I can get back to the surgery I’m supposed to be doing.’
‘Yeah but she’s not pulled any mind control powers on you so you know you’re doing fine,’ he teases, moving away as it’s time for the man’s shot.
The team struggle to find leads to help them track down their missing friends, and Wade voices everyone's worst fears.
remotely as well. This is the kind of stuff I would have killed for when I was first starting out.’ The inventor had done more than make moveable grenades, he’d fitted them with microphones and cameras so they could be used to gather information as well.
‘Ned’s with me!’ he calls after them as Sam disappears with his friend. He crawls back up the wall and into the corridor.
‘I hope you’re all going to eating right this year, you know I don’t like relying on you and Tony looking after yourselves.’
‘In my room?’ Tony clarifies. ‘Tonight? I thought you didn’t want to move too fast,’ he teases the blond.
‘Tony, stop, this is getting ridiculous. At this rate you aren’t going to be in any shape to take on HYDRA or Hammer when we find them.’
Steve can’t help the bark of laughter, mentally reminding himself to ask Bucky about that story. Once Vision has left though, he sobers up again and looks over at Natasha.
‘Don’t you dare gang up on me with that thing,’ Strange grumbles, though he’s still too weak for it to do much to deter Loki.
Natasha looks up as another box is lowered down to her via Peter’s webs. ‘Is that the last of it?’ she calls up to him and Sam.
He hears the kid sigh, but doesn’t add anything more until Peter finally says what’s on his mind. ‘Are you sure it’s a good idea for meet the whole team so soon after everyone’s come back? I mean I did fight like half of them the first, and last, time I met them.’
She laughs. ‘I think we’re safe. For one thing Valkyrie may not have told him this, but she was not happy with the thought of him “wasting” whatever that stuff is called. I think she swapped his bottle for something else.’
‘No, I just didn’t realise that everyone has a special coffee that FRIDAY prepares for us automatically. I just assumed it was all the same.’
‘I’m done with that kind of thing, remember? Besides it’s actually much easier for it to go wrong than I realised. It’s lucky I didn’t end up keeping one of the team trapped in a waking nightmare.’
Tony shrugs. ‘I’m not going to stop you,’ he replies. ‘Just remember we have to work with them so try not to go all ‘Captain America’ on me. Right now I need, Steve Rogers.’
So I'm not intending to bring all the Defenders in to this story, but I thought it would be a bit strange if Peter ran into Deadpool but never any of the other superheroes based in New York. Daredevil also seemed the most likely to try and track down Deadpool. There may be a couple more appearances from our horned friend, but he won't play a huge role.
‘How is he?’ are the first words out of Steve’s mouth once they get back to the facility and join the others in the common area, Vision is in one of the chairs with Wanda knelt next to him trying to heal the wound in his side, both Bruce and Peter are stood nearby with FRIDAY projecting screens in front of them showing the extent of his injury.
‘I don’t have time for your smart mouth, Stark,’ Ross glares at him. ‘It was either the army or you to be called in and I thought this might be a good little test to see how your newest member is fitting back into the team.’ He turns to look at her and Wanda manages to hold his gaze. ‘The police have already tried sending in three negotiators. All of them have been sent out dead, and the perpetrators are using advanced weaponry, possibly made from alien remnants from the Battle of New York.’
Wanda smiles at him encouragingly. ‘Sure.’ She turns to Wade. ‘Come sit next to me, Wade. I’ll make sure the team leave you alone.’
It doesn’t take them long. There’s something about the pattern of the attacks that’s familiar. Steadying. And Peter feels himself calming down and getting into a pattern of defence and counter attack and, slowly, his senses return.
‘Oh my god it’s the Black Widow!’ the whispers start moving up the bus and, when it pulls to a stop and the doors open everyone seems a bit nervous to get up and leave.
‘No,’ he shakes his head, ‘He has other plans for Spider-Man, we’re not to engage unless we have no choice.’
‘Stop!’ a voice commands, as Bucky raises his metal fist. The dark-haired man pauses, stepping back and lowering his arm. Taking the opportunity to check on his teammates Steve looks around and sees both Natasha and Clint in similar positions to him. The appearance of the Winter Soldier had thrown them all off kilter.
Strange is quiet for a few moments. ‘I do not believe that will happen, Peter,’ he answers. ‘If you were able to fight off his direct influence, I do not doubt you will be able to fight against this other influence you speak of. In my opinion I would say that it is only due to your physical and mental exhaustion that you have had such large swings in personality. As you become stronger these will become less.’
‘We could celebrate Yule up to the twenty-first,’ Sam suggests, ‘and invite others to come and celebrate it with us, and then celebrate Christmas afterwards. Might be fun to do something different and may stop Wanda and Peter becoming the terrible Christmas goblins again.’
‘I don’t know,’ he admits, standing in front of the stairs and doing his best to block out Bucky’s moaning at Steve’s perfect timing of being an idiot. ‘But I have a feeling I can guess,’ he growls as Ross moves in front of the soldiers.
Steve just nods, taking the kit back to the bathroom and collecting the shirt from the floor where he’d left it folded, bringing it back to the inventor. Tony takes it from him and, with shaking hands, presses on the reactor. It opens up, revealing a hidden compartment that had never been in any of the previous ones.
A/N: Hi everyone. Sorry I'm a little late with updating this week, I hope this chapter was worth it though. I discovered a problem whilst writing this particular instalment: I find it really difficult to write decent fight scenes! Please do let me know if you have any suggestions for how I can improve them.
Tony doesn’t finish his sentence, and his face is getting closer to Steve’s; the soldier can feel his heart hammering in his chest, and his breath catches slightly as Tony’s eyes start to close. Just as Steve begins to close his own he feels Tony tense in his arms and pull away.
There’s a pause as Ross attempts to stare him down. Then the Secretary spins on his heel, flinging the pardon back in Natasha’s face, and storms off, gesturing for the soldiers to follow him.
‘Why don’t I take it?’ Carol suggests. ‘I can leave it with some trusted people, and if anyone does come for it my abilities are able to counter it’s power.’
‘I think I might take a glass to Pete,’ Wade laughs. ‘Sam and Bucky might need one too. And Quill come to think of it.’
‘Guys I am more than capable of handling my own fights,’ Steve sighs, and then proves his point by letting his shield fly, taking out numerous opponents as he continues to take out more in hand-to-hand.
‘We’re revealing Ross’ involvement in HYDRA tomorrow,’ she answers, ‘and I can’t imagine the reaction is going to be pretty over with you.’
‘What do you want, Wade?’ Steve sighs, closing the book he’d been reading to look up at the mercenary.
‘I’ll do my best,’ Peter promises, pressing a soft, quick kiss to Wade’s lips and pulling away before anyone can stumble across them.
‘He has a point,’ Loki adds. ‘It would be unwise to keep all the stones together. I would advise no more than three on any one planet.’
‘Hey, Captain sir, are you made of bricks? You’re really solid,’ he asks as they both climb off the ground.
‘They’re memories. Repressed memories, or ones that were taken from you during your original captivity as the Winter Soldier, but still memories. They must have begun to return as your mind has continued to heal.’
Peter decides it’d be more suspicious to argue so just does as he’s told, feeling slightly uneasy as Mr Nelson closes the door behind him.
‘He’ll be fine when he’s got his coffee,’ Tony waves a dismissive hand. ‘Besides I’ve got my own big bad super soldier to keep me from getting carried away.’
‘They must be to have this kind of reaction from you,’ he tries again. ‘Come on, Wade, if they’re looking for information on me too I need to know what to keep an eye out for.’
‘It is still wise to check considering he was able to organise something similar in the past,’ Vision says, landing next to them.
Whatever Vision is about to reply with is lost in the loud, ominous cracking sound that comes from across the other side of the street. Screams sound as the side of a building starts to lean over onto the street, the scaffolding around it doing nothing but bending under the weight.
Whatever Ned is about to say in response is cut off by the obnoxious voice of another male. ‘Yo! Penis Parker! No ride for you today? You finally get fired or what?’
Dinner still hasn’t been served when Peter returns to the dining room, this time with Wade in tow. For such a large man he is doing a good job of hiding behind the teen.
‘Likewise, Ororo,’ he bows and kisses her hand, ‘I hope the next time we meet will be under better circumstances.’
Bucky glares at him and turns back to the table, going to the opposite side and climbing underneath to start getting it ready.
‘You really did get a beauty of a wife, Howard. Not that I’m surprised; I’m not sure which Steve found more confusing: your technology or how easy you found it to talk to women. He told me the fondue story with you and Peggy in the plane by the way, had me laughing so hard I couldn’t see for tears.
‘Shuri this is no time to be complaining about my footwear,’ T’Challa sighs and rolls his eyes. ‘How is Vision doing?’
He’s saved from answering by Mr Harris entering the classroom. ‘Alright everyone settle down! I know you’re excited, but before we get ready to go to the Avengers Facility I want to introduce you all to our new student. He’s just arrived here and I think this trip is going to be a great opportunity for you all to get to know him and to make him feel welcome. I’d like someone to volunteer to be his ‘buddy’ for the first day,’ Mr Harris gestures for the person at the door to enter. ‘Everyone this is-’
‘Excuse me,’ they turn around in unison at the female voice behind them, ‘I couldn’t help but hear you mention Thanos. Did you say you are trying to defeat him? What has he done?’
‘Cool it, kid. I’m impressed not hurt,’ Bucky laughs, patting him on the shoulder. And suddenly the tension in the room starts to ease and Tony releases a breath he didn’t even realise he’d been holding.
‘Well I’ve managed to avoid Sergeant Barnes so it’s been pretty good. You look really nice by the way.’
‘No!’ Wanda screeches, but she’s not quick enough to stop Thanos grabbing Vision by the throat and ripping the Mind Stone from his head.
?!?’ Peter’s head swivels to look at them both, obviously his sensitive hearing as picked up their conversation. ‘You’re not serious, you don’t know- Wanda! Why would you do that?’
thing you could do better than me was be a pain in the arse. Well and look like a complete fucking idiot. So,’ he fixes Hammer with one of his stares, the ones he’s been perfecting ever since meeting Peter, ‘just how did you manage to find out about the fact Bucky had feelings for me, and that Cap and I were dancing around each other? Because not even the rest of the
Peter’s jaw has fallen open, his eyes impossibly wide and he looks between Bucky and Tony. ‘How did you know about that?’
‘Well, well, looks like you are going to play ball after all,’ Rumlow sneers when he notices the dark jeans and hoodie that Steve has on.
‘But why?’ Steve asks, fury coursing through him that someone would be that callous with regards a human life. His friend’s life.
‘Strange? Strange!’ he calls out as he continues to follow the Cloak; eventually he reaches a smaller room where he sees the doctor slumped in a comfortable, high back chair. The man gives a groan as he enters. ‘Strange? What happened? Are you injured?’
A pained groan comes through and they all breathe a sigh of relief. ‘I’m alright. Damn that came out of nowhere.’
Steve promises himself, catching Tony’s eyes and giving him a small smile before turning his attention back to the film.
As she lets the flash drive finish saving all of the computer’s files she turns to the shelves, doing a quick scan of the files and books to see if there’s anything worth taking.
‘Err not meaning to change the subject, baby boy, but my asshole senses are picking up something across the street. Two shady characters by the parked car in the alleyway,’ the man says, pointing across the street.
Before Tony can say anything else Dr Hill returns. ‘Well, Mister Parker,’ he says, ‘from what I can see I’m going to guess that you’ve not been eating as much as you need to for your enhanced metabolism through the day, and you’ve overdone it during your training session this morning. Have I got it right?’
‘How’s the sanding coming along bird brain?’ the dark haired man calls from the other end of the table. Okay maybe they were that bad.
‘I know. But she feels this is the only way she can still protect him. Although Iron Man made a lot of positive changes in Tony’s life, it’s the one part Pepper’s never really been able to accept. He’s always been self-destructive and she sees Iron Man as the accumulation of all of that.’
Tony leaves the apartment with a secret smile on his face as he hears Peter’s excitable voice already trying to convince May to let him come up to the facility more often. All previous sadness forgotten. Tony knows the guilt will come back, but hopefully, tonight at least, he’ll sleep soundly.
‘Which basically means they’re pissing around outside,’ Tony interrupts with a smile as his coffee finishes pouring.
he thinks, aiming at one of the tyres and sending a shot into it that blows it, sending the vehicle off course for a few metres, before the driver gets it under control. ‘Damn it! Alright let’s turn this thing.’ He aims at the remaining tyres and manages to blow them, but not before the vehicle launches itself up the steps with enough force to then send it sailing straight through the doors.
‘-but I didn’t think to keep the team out of them. Now we’ve got proof Ross is connected to HYDRA, and who knows how many of the others on the Council as well. I’m sorry,’ he ignores Rhodes’ comment. ‘I’m sorry to all of you that I didn’t see this as a possibility and try and stop it then.’
‘If not, we’ll soon find out,’ she replies, and launches some more energy at Agatha. Two hit her and one hits the wall behind her.
Tony holds Sam’s eye, seeing if he can get any clues from the other man’s expression. ‘What makes you say that?’
‘Tony you make every therapist you see cry. If you want to talk to someone I’m the only one who isn’t going to scream, snap or slap you.’
Rumlow gives him the self-satisfied smirk that always makes Steve want to punch something. Preferably Rumlow’s face. ‘You aren’t going, Rogers.’
Tony just scowls at the archer and throws a packet of blueberries from the fridge next to him at his face. Unfortunately, Clint’s reflexes are still as good as ever.
‘Wade this is Harry, he’s just started at our school but we were friends since we were babies,’ Peter says, dragging Harry over to the merc. ‘Harry, this is my boyfriend Wade.’
‘Maybe we should have a few more team parties,’ Steve muses, seeing how happy they all look. ‘Add a couple of our closer circle to it next time rather than half of New York.’
‘Wanda was knocked out like Sam when the attack first happened. Thor was in the car with her and was disorientated, it’s a miracle he wasn’t out cold too. Steve checked on me then went to help them while Bucky helped me get Sam out the car. Then he went to help the others when the soldiers attacked. Nakia and I got Sam into their car, then she went to help while I stayed with him. They hit us with this sonic blast, completely knocked us all, then when the others were retreating one of them shot Bucky in the leg. He was carrying Wanda and, because they couldn’t hear, they didn’t realise he was down until I managed to get Steve’s attention. By the time he turned back there was this weird mist and…it knocked him out and there were soldiers between them and us. We couldn’t get back to them. The mist was some kind of knock out gas, but fast acting. It had to be to take out Bucky that quickly. Even T’Challa’s suit couldn’t filter it enough. They nearly got him as well when he tried to go after them. If it wasn’t for Okoye and Steve he would have been.’
‘What have we got?’ Tony asks, retracting his helmet and coming to stand next to Natasha who is already furiously typing away, two bodies at her feet. ‘You know, it’s kind of scary how little having people lying dead at your feet as you work distracts you.’
The next story in the main series may take a while to upload, I'm in the process of applying for a masters degree so it might take me a bit longer to finish the next story and I don't want to do what I did with this one where I can't keep the regular updates coming. You know as soon as I start posting it, though, that it is finished.
Steve puts his friend in a head lock. ‘Buck, you keep on that train of thought and I’m going to let Tony put you on your backside.’
‘Why would you do that?’ Peter asks, frowning in confusion. ‘I mean I understand with the stuff for the team, but why SI?’
‘Maybe I should take up acting,’ Bucky chuckles, looking from Hammer’s face to the device in his hand. Steve cautiously moves backwards towards the exit.
‘That is genuinely the worst argument I have ever heard,’ Tony says. ‘Justin Hammer tries to build things, that doesn’t mean I want to be in the same room as the guy.’
Wanda looks over at the picture of her brother, a sad smile on her face. ‘He brought me here a few days after I got back. He asked if I was happy with what was on the plaque, and that he could change it if I wanted him to.’ She laughs a little. ‘I thought the superhero name was fitting. He said he’d made it so we could remember all the important people. Piotr was the first one he put up, saying it seemed fitting the first Avenger to give his life was the first to be remembered here.’
‘Well I know one thing, Stark,’ a voice says from behind him, ‘I’m still good enough to get past your security.’
‘But it was fine! Honestly. I mean yeah there was the one moment when I thought about calling him, but I didn’t need to. It’s not like I was trying to do too much, I promise I would have called if it got too dangerous.’
‘That,’ Wade declares on his return from cleaning out the vomit, ‘was disgusting. Next time can we please aim over the side of the balcony?’
‘He wanted to rebrand the Winter Soldier,’ Pepper adds quietly. ‘You do realise if anything does go wrong now it won’t be Bucky the media will be focussing on-’
‘Better. It’s been hard since May’s left, especially since Wade is still away on his assignment for Fury, he’s spent the last two nights with me and Steve.’
A/N: Hi everyone. Hope you're enjoying this chapters even though I'm speed writing them. I thought it might be interesting to do the mistletoe challenge from one person's point of view, rather than try and fit everyone in. I hope you like it so far.
Loki sighs. ‘Something tells me you won’t be giving me much choice in the matter for this celebratory period.’
‘No!’ Tony leans back to the podium. ‘Need I remind you that not that long ago you would all happily sing the praises of Sargent James Barnes, the only member of the Howling Commandos to have given his life in service to his country. When I came back from having been tortured in Afghanistan you were all full of sympathy; this for the man who you nicknamed “The Merchant of Death”.  So let me ask you a question: why can’t you give sympathy to a decorated war hero who went through more than I ever did?’
‘Let us challenge ourselves friends!’ Thor grins. ‘Imagine the boasts we shall have if we do this without them.’
‘Fortunately for you, however, Valkyrie was able to remain at New Asgard so I am still able to attend and teach you all I know of intergalactic diplomacy, including what my father Odin taught me.’
