Tony interrupted his stuttering, "How about James? That's a good strong name, and one I would think you are at least a little familiar with?" He felt his smile stretch wide. "Yeah, I'd really like to be James again."
Rhodes sighed and said, “The Howard you knew; he was long gone by the time Tony was born. Tony spent all of his life trying to impress the man.” Steve nodded solemnly and wiped his nose with his sleeve.
Tony had always been gorgeous in Steve’s eyes. Gorgeous from the moment they met and in every moment since. When Tony was happy as he laughed with Clint and Thor, mischievous as he teased Bruce and “the other guy”, kindness as he opened his space to Natasha and let her stash knives all over their living spaces so she felt safe. Even when he fought with Steve himself, Tony was beautiful. His breathtaking eyes that somehow contained all of the colors in the world when the light hit them just right. Steve felt he could own every color pallet sold and he would still never get their depths just right, and he had tried.
“Alright, alright, hold on, back you savage children!” Tony exclaimed as he held the candy bars above his head out of their reach. “I am nothing, if not a business man. So, impress Mr. Stark and sell to me. Why should I give you such delectable treats, hmm? And you’ll need confirmation this time, not like last time when you got treats after giving your mothers a heart attack disappearing from the store!” His eyes sparkled with mischief.
“What the hell did you just say?” She said as she took a step toward him before suddenly Tony was up and grabbing her by the wrist now, pulling her away towards him and holding her there.
He pointed to Clint first, "You were supposed to be giving out assistance from your vantage point. The only pointers you gave were to Falcon, Scarlet Witch, and Captain America. Not once did you reach out to the others. You saw the building begin to sway with Spider-Man still on it and said nothing."
"No, Tony, it doesn't. It seems like the public version of you." This time it was Vision who spoke up.
Suddenly, further images and feelings were torn from her as she fell to her knees on the cold floor of Tony’s lab. Her breathing was harsh as the feelings and images she had seen slotted into her mind in order, all becoming clearer with every second. They weren’t hers, she knew that, they were Tony’s.
T’Challa’s voice was quiet, but no less strong when he leaned forward slightly and said, “I do believe that we can do some good here, Mr. Stark. Is that not what we have always endeavored for? I know the rumors about you. The rumors you let be passed around. Though I do wonder why you never bother to correct them, I do not wonder if every action you take, every life you save, every piece of Stark technology you create, is not your own way of proving to yourself that the rumors are lies.”
“First of all, you are a person, not a part. Just because someone has added a part to you doesn’t mean you are any less of a person. It was without your consent and it wasn’t done out of love or care for you. You are a person, Nebula, and you deserve to be treated like one. I’m sorry you weren’t.”
“How you doin’ there, old man?” Tony whispered as he lifted Steve’s left arm and situated himself under it, wrapping his other arm around Steve snugly and hauling him upwards to stand. “’m okay.” He whispered back as Tony steadied him. “Seems to run on some form of electricity.” He joked with a wince. Tony smiled softly at him for that. He didn’t immediately let go either, instead he stayed tucked under Steve’s arm and braced him with his arm wrapped around Steve’s middle and his other palm pressed to the middle of Steve’s chest.
Immediately the group started to fire off questions at her before Steve and Thor were able to calm them down. It was Thor who stepped forward and addressed her.
Tony felt like he had been slapped. He glanced away from T’Challa’s eyes that obviously saw too much, knew too much, though how he wasn’t sure. He again fought the large lump in his throat. “Not for myself.” It came out as barely more than a whisper.
things. He could feel different textures and temperature in his fingers. No one would know it wasn't real flesh. For the first time in a long time, James Barnes pictured himself walking around crowds of people and no one staring at him or his arm. He would be just like anyone else.
He prayed that Steve wouldn’t follow him, but as he bent to retrieve the blanket from the folding crib, he turned around and found Steve leaning against the doorframe, watching him. God, why couldn’t he ever catch a break?
“Well kiddos, did you learn anything from Daddy?” He leveled his amused gaze on each of them, resting last on Steve. There was no way he could trust his voice or his thoughts right now, so he wisely kept his mouth shut and let the others take over the situation.
“You know how much I love hearing about myself, Ross. But let’s talk about you.” Tony said, his voice giving away nothing of the volumes his vitals were screaming. “You knew the evidence I gave to the UN was your death warrant. After all, human experimentation is frowned upon in civilized society. But you just couldn’t fight that itch, you wanted the Scarlet Witch, a parting gift before you went underground. She was your next Banner, wasn’t she? Study her and rip her apart to find out what gives her the abilities.”
Peter felt his own smile stretch across his face as Tony released him and he heard the others against the wall cheer. He turned toward the noise and saw Bruce, T’Challa, Shuri, James, Steve, and Sam all cheering and clapping for him.
T'Challa's gaze locked with his and the King continued, "Tony Stark had a complicated relationship with James Barnes, which he has repaired. He does not harbor the same mixed feelings for the rest of you. If you want to be a permanent team of any kind with those you left behind, I will tell you now that it will be up to you to convince them of your intentions."
He would go and see the psychiatrist that James told him about, that was a start. Branching off from what Tony had spoken to him about, how he knew how to lead a team but not work within one, he can work on that. The first thing he wants to do is make the effort to spend time with and get to know his team on and off the field. Maybe there was literature he could look into? Who was he kidding, in this day and age, he was sure there was.
Tony’s jaw clenched at that and he gave a short nod as he tipped the bottle back and took a large swig, his face pulling as it burned down his throat.
control other peoples fear.” She nodded. “How can we trust each other?” Wanda whispered into the silence of the room after their tears had subsided. Tony sighed. “I trust that you will do your best. You fought with the others and you protected them fiercely. Do you trust that I will do my best?” Again, she nodded. “That’s all we can do, isn’t it? We’ll work on it, okay?”
Steve just sat on the edge of the bed for a moment, bewildered and exhilarated at what had just occurred between them. Tony had asked him to stay the night. He removed his shoes and socks, unsure what else would be appropriate to remove before he decided to remove his shirt and pants, leaving him in his boxers like he normally slept in. He crawled his way up the large bed and got under the heavy covers to wait.
But, he had made a promise. If there was one thing his father had taught him, it was that honorable promises were to be kept and that a King focused on the greater good. So he set his mind to do just that, and kept his secret truth to himself, grinding his teeth and biting his tongue at every character slight they attributed to Tony Stark.
Tony’s face betrayed only momentary surprise at seeing them all there before the corners of his lips lifted into a small smile.
The momentary elation he felt was quickly crushed as he heard Sam report over the comm, "Cap, we got a big problem. Three more blasts have gone off around the city, there are trapped civilians."
Nebula lowered her mouth to Tony’s ear as they slowly walked. His tilted his head towards her to hear her words, but even Steve’s enhanced hearing couldn’t pick up the words she spoke.
“Is there no sense of fucking privacy with you people? Huh? Who the hell told you that you could come in here?” Everyone turned to look at him in shock. He was furious, his eyes flashing dangerously. James tried to explain, “Tony, FRIDAY alerted us you were in trouble-”
"Just tired. We had a late night last night and I woke up with sharpie all over my face, let me tell you how much of a bitch that was to scrub off, I took off the top 3 layers of my skin at least."
There was no erasing or replacing happening here, just adding. The families they had known had been pulled apart and those who were left behind had been gathered together and protected by Tony.
He made his way over to the King and spread his arms wide calling, "King T'Challa, finally, I have a friend downstairs who has been asking me to make introductions all night!"
With a quick kiss to her cheek and final meaningful look he slid past her and out into the stairwell where the other man was waiting. She felt sick. He knew the camera was watching, he knew what it looked like, and he even admitted to the physical act he was about to preform as if it were nothing. He didn't seem to want to go, yet he went with his head held high anyways with an almost sacrificial attitude. What the hell was happening?
“You want to explain why you are busting in here with a posse of private soldiers, Ross?” Tony said, his voice dark and unwavering.
With the addition of a small wire, Nebula felt a sudden connection. The electricity hit her hard, but there was no physical pain.
Currently, James was in the room with Tony alone, so Steve was alternating between sitting and pacing around the waiting area. He loved everyone there, but he felt like he needed air and some time to think in peace. He excused himself and walked down the halls until he found and empty stairwell with a large window. It was raining outside again, just a drizzle, and the sound the the drops on the glass were soothing.
"Alright, I need everyone's attention so listen up." Rhodes called. "We have a few ground rules to go over before we head into the Compound. First, you will all have your old rooms. They have been basically untouched since you left. Two of the extra rooms on the floor are now occupied by myself and Sergeant Barnes. There are many places in the Compound that you do not have access to, and it will remain that way for the foreseeable future. This includes, but is not limited to Tony's lab and the upper levels of the compound, including the penthouse. You will not be allowed outside of the Compound or its perimeter. Be careful, there have been reporters outside the Gates day and night hoping to catch a glimpse of some kind of drama. We will not be giving them the satisfaction, understood?
“Hmm… puppy eyes, that could only mean one thing. I was supposed to get you little munchkins some treats or something?”
A few weeks later he had been relieved at the happiness that had lit up Steve's face when he told him that Bucky would be coming out of his cryo-sleep. Steve had been so happy; he didn't even question why. That was slightly concerning to T'Challa, but he didn't push the issue.
," he sneered "but he didn't. He got behind that wheel and he took her down with him. And that, that is something I could never let go of. I promised myself, I promised him, I promised any God that existed, and most of all, I promised
Maggie got all of the children together and ushered them through the door to the stairs and up to the penthouse, Nate on her hip. Laura ran out of the room momentarily and came back with a huge, nearly empty, bottle of very expensive scotch. Tony quirked an eyebrow at her and said, “Is that-?” She gave him a sharp look and said, “The one I took away from you a few months ago, yes.” She gave him a hard look. “Alright then.” He answered.
He knew he wouldn’t be able to sleep, so instead he sat down on the couch in the main area and tried to sort out his thoughts. He would apologize to Tony. He already knew that he wanted and needed to do that, but tonight had solidified just how important it was that Clint rebuild the relationship they had. Rebuild and improve. He sat on the couch thinking about how he would go about it for hours, hoping that Tony would show his face at some point.
“There isn’t even any posturing. There’s nothing artificial in the confidence that Tony Stark holds, not here. Here in this corporate world, Tony Stark and Pepper Potts rule with absolute power. Between the two of them they bring the competition to their knees.”
With Tony in his thoughts he felt himself start to drift off before being brought back with the sudden ring of the comm. Again, Bucky answered and Natasha's face was on the monitor, but she looked far from the happy calm she had been composed of earlier. Before anyone could even greet her she was speaking frantically.
Sam leaned over to Steve slightly, keeping his voice low. "I'm sure Stark is really alright, Cap. That kid, too. I've fought that little Spider, and he nearly kicked my ass."
Tony swallowed thickly before shaking his head sadly and shrugging. “I’m sorry. It’s… it’s complicated.”
The Avengers all cried out in response and moved forward, but Natasha, James, Vision, Bruce, and Rhodes all quickly formed a defensive wall and held them back while the guards pointed their guns at them threateningly. Tony held his head high as the guards grabbed him and pushed him up to slam against the wall, pulling his arms behind him and securing the cuffs on his wrists tightly.
"What did I look like Nat, huh? Tell me." She shook her head. "Tell me what I looked like on that stairwell, say it. Come on, I know you want to say it so do it, spit it out, I looked…?" He goaded her on, poking at her, knowing she was already nearly angry enough to break.
"Let's take Door C, Sir and get you home instead. That saves us both from any embarrassment that options A and B would cause us." Happy replied as he opened the door for him.
, but I don't have a good enough excuse for it." His admission was met by a roll of thunder. "Bet you wish you'd changed sides at that airport now, huh?"
“It’s not real Stevie, it’s Tony, it’s in his head, it’s BARF.” Steve nodded dumbly at James. Right. BARF. He had watched the youtube video of Tony’s simulation more times than he was prepared to admit. He also knew from his phone conversations with James while he was undergoing treatment that Tony and Shuri had made huge improvements since.  But if this was BARF, it meant this was a memory. Is this what Tony had seen when he flew the nuke through the portal? No, the Earth was too far away. His head hurt and his brain struggled to wrap around what was happening.
“Well, I am glad I brought Shuri to distract him. And I am very glad he is surrounded by friends. I think Shuri and I will stay a few days longer than planned.” Laura’s face brightened at that and she laid a hand over T’Challa’s. “I think Tony would love that, thank you.”
At the mention of the gift he stood and retrieved the drawstring bag it from his nightstand drawer. He loosened the bag and let the small heavy black metal box inside drop into his palm. It was a smoothly engraved, etched with a highly intricate design, with two small ovals on each side. “What am I missing? Apart from hitting it with the shield, I tried just about everything to get it open, but it won’t budge. Guess I’m just too
Against his neck, he heard and felt Tony saying something. He tried to focus and strained to hear the words. “Peter. Oh my god, Steve, Peter is gone. He turned to ash in my hands. I held him. He was so scared. They’re gone, they’re all gone. I couldn’t- there was nothing-”
He heard the door to the lab hiss open and from his upside down vantage point he watched Tony walk into the lab. The man looked beyond exhausted.
And then that screen came on, and in a few short moments, not only did every lie that I had been told so many damn times come down on me, but so did the lie that I had built myself; that somehow I had become someone who mattered, who was part of a team, that I had a family."
Shortly after landing and getting the fuel they desperately needed, Nebula declares she is going for information and that Tony will stay on the Milan and wait for her to return. Tony doesn’t love the idea, but since he has no idea where they are, what species live here, which language they speak, or really anything else, he doesn’t argue with her and simply nods. Satisfied with his silence she stalks down the ramp out into the hazy grime of the planet’s filthy city.
He continued to nuzzle his way up Tony’s neck, his mouth barely ghosting over the skin, and pressed his nose into Tony’s soft hair just above his ear. Steve had taken his time, making sure Tony could have easily stopped him by now if he’d wanted to. With no protest so far, Steve felt a bit bolder, and continued on by pressing a kiss to the shell of Tony’s ear, dipping his head again and placing soft kisses down Tony’s neck. As his lips traveled over the skin Tony tilted his head slightly, giving Steve access to more skin. Steve moved his right hand that was still on the counter to rest on Tony’s hip, just above the waistband of his pants. He let his thumb rub small circles there for a moment before hooking his fingers through one of the belt loops and gently tugging on them, turning Tony around to face him in the space between his arms. Never once did he break from the slow feather-light kisses he was now peppering back up Tony’s neck along his adams apple and under his jaw. He let both of his hands now rest solidly on Tony’s hips.
"Alright hold on, before anyone says anything I think it's past these kid's bedtime, isn't that right squirts? Let's get that done and then we can all come back in here and you can plan how best to end my life together, okay?"
Tony clapped his hands together. “Great. Next, the healthy isle or as we like to say, The Party Pooper Isle. We gotta get Bruce his quinoa and other shit.”
The smaller man was still surprisingly light on his feet as he twisted away from a flying fist and returned with a hard blow to the back of the thugs knees. With a quick movement, Stark produced one of her knives in his hand, which he buried in the thug’s chest with a grunt.
The next hour was spent in anxious silence. If Steve thought he was fidgety and nervous before, it was nothing compared to the anxiety sweeping through his veins now.
"The op went south. Spider-Man was hit and fell unconscious into the river. Tony dove in after him and some rubble fell on top of them both. The suit got them out, Spider-Man is alright, but Tony took a lot of the damage. FRIDAY read his sustained injuries; bruising around his ribs, a sprained wrist, a dislocated shoulder, and a mild concussion. The doctor says he should be alright, but I wanted to give you both a heads up before you got in. The bruising is…significant. His face especially. I just got off the call with P-Spider-Man. He's really shook up, says there was a lot of blood."
The light on the door turned green and James wrenched the door open forcefully and they all followed. The rest of them stood for a moment, their eyes adapting to the darkness, but the serum meant Steve and James didn’t need it. Steve followed James as he ran to the door on the far wall.
Steve suddenly decided he wasn’t hungry anymore and retreated to his room. Sam looked at him suspiciously.
“T’Challa and Shuri will be here in just a few hours and they are going to be staying with us for a few days. I’ve got Peter coming over too. I thought we could have a little party and movie night.” The three children, cheered, their mouths full of chocolate.
did that. I just wanted to blame you.” She looked up at him with tear stained cheeks. “I just want Pietro back.” She whispered, brokenly.
They stared at each other for a few heartbeats more before Tony gave him a look that clearly communicated he was waiting for some kind of an answer. "Did I damage your vocal chords in that bunker or something, Barnes?"
Tony turned and deposited Nate into the nearest person’s arms before turning back to Peter and pulling him in for a tight hug. Peter looked slightly shocked for a second before he returned the hug enthusiastically.
“Mr. Stark, do you trust Captain Rogers?” Tony’s mask didn’t slip an inch. “Of course I do, he’s Captain America.” He replied breezily. “But didn’t he betray you?” Someone called out. He waved aside.
So here they were, camped out in front of the screen with the Queen Ramonda and Princess Shuri of Wakanda, waiting for the show to begin.
He had a mission though, and his actions were means to an end. They didn't have to mean anything he told himself over and over. When he finally got out of this place he would make sure to talk to her and help her understand why he did it, but first he needed to find the King of Wakanda.
. They needed to start work on Bucky if the man was going to ever recover. The one thing that Tony was adamant about was secrecy. T'Challa would not tell any of his house guests that Tony was involved in what has happening in any way, other than being ordered to help Barnes with his technology.
Steve stepped forward and put a hand on T’Challa’s shoulder. “Please, I am begging you-” But T’Challa raised a hand. “I am sorry, Steve, I cannot. We will bring him back, but you need to stay. Shuri, transmit this to our comms and send us his location.”
floor. Well. Now that his embarrassment faded he thought about things. Tony had been direct and made a fairly obvious pass at him, he doubted that he read that wrong. Maybe Tony was kidding, trying to make him uncomfortable, but maybe… maybe not. Maybe Tony’s interest was genuine. Steve glanced at the floor number he was currently on. Well. If he stared heading there now he could arrive with a few minutes before Tony would be back in his office. He could beat him there and wait for him in his office.
Tony laughed at Thor as he continued to eye Steve with intrigue. “Pepper is like a shark; she can smell blood in the water.”
"I had been so sure Buck…" A small noise that sounded suspiciously like a sniffle, "I never second guessed myself. I should have. I should have. Why didn't I? Now it's too late. Its broken. I did what I had to do in the moment, I honestly didn't see an other option. Even now, I know what I was thinking and I know why I did it. How can I be sorry, while still not being sorry?"
Steve nodded and said, “We will wait for your return. Can we listen in on the comms, try and help from here?” Tony’s face lit momentarily with surprise and relief before he nodded and started for the door, calling out, “Avengers, with me.”
Steve shook himself. Tony was right. It was a simulation but it was important. He could do this, he had to do this. With the familiar weight of the shield in his hand he felt the need to prove to everyone, but most importantly to Tony, that he deserved it.
“Don’t patronize me Tony. I just saw the news and while I am very upset with you right now, I think I’ll let Rhodey handle that. Please tell me that you got my memo so you remember you have a Stark Industries meeting today?”
. Team Captain. Finally, not Rogers, but Cap. It wasn't Steve, but it was a step that way. And it communicated, by saying Team Leader, that Tony still felt like Steve could run this team.
He was wincing in pain with each step they took. He looked exhausted and spent, covered in bruises and cuts, but he wasn’t covered in dirt or dried blood, he had been cleaned with care and his wounds dressed. He had a thin blanket around his shoulders and a hand pressed to the side of his stomach, but he was alive. His eyes were trained on his feet as they shuffled down the ramp, trying not to stumble. Nebula supported him with a surprisingly soft look on her face and gentle hands. Steve didn’t know her, but he wouldn’t have guessed the stoic woman was capable of the gentleness she was showing. One glance to Rocket’s shocked face confirmed that this was a strange sight.
T'Challa steeled himself. "Yes, there are provisions that the Council has set and they are resolute. The first is that you are to live and operate under strict supervision until it is determined whether the treatment is working."
Once he was finally alone, he let the sobs rip from his chest as he leaned forward and pressed his forehead against the back of Tony’s hand while he held it. After a long time, his sobs subsided to hiccups and sniffs as he laid his head on the bed next to Tony’s hand and traced lines of his palm with his fingers.
Bucky promised to keep in contact with him as much as he possibly could before he boarded the stealth jet.
The best night of his life suddenly took a turn for the worse, because of course it did. They all froze when FRIDAY made the announcement that wiped the smiles off of everyone’s faces.
“My friend,” came the accented reply, “I know what this has cost you. Although I cannot say that I know the pain you feel, I can tell you that after everything I have witnessed and heard, I know it must be great. I am…” he hesitated, “most impressed with you. To face the demons is difficult enough, but to overcome them as you have, that is strength of another kind. Over our time I have grown quite fond of you, and your friendship is greatly appreciated. You are honorable, no matter what anyone might say.”
Tony was silent, his body tense, and the hand on the tablet was shaking slightly. Steve could tell that was enough for now.
The reporter was back saying, "We have word that Tony Stark is pulling up now, again, this will be his first public event in months since the "Civil War" incident."
Tony felt like he couldn’t even breathe, his lungs wouldn’t open up, no matter how hard he gasped. A short cough made its way up his body and tore out of his throat, making a harsh, wet sound. Raising his shaking hand, he wiped his lips, pulling back and seeing crimson blood smeared there. Distantly, he heard James calling his name. He looked up in a daze, seeing his friend kneel in front of him, a hand bracing his back as he sat up. “Hey, hey, hey, slow down there, Tin Man.” Tony could see by the strain of his smile, James was trying to stay calm.
Cassie came running up to Scott and jumped easily into his lap, throwing her arms around him and lighting Scott’s face up like Christmas Day.
He turned to Queen Ramonda and Princess Shuri, kissing both of their hands as he bowed. The Queen had stood tall, laying a gentle hand on his cheek and leaning down to whisper to him, "We always think we have more time than we truly do. Don't let time get the best of you, Captain." He nodded and politely answered her with a "Yes ma'am."
Steve steeled himself as Rhodes approached with Pepper in tow and he and Sam and greeted them. Rhodes greeting was cool, but not entirely unkind. Pepper’s greeting was positively icy, but Steve couldn’t quite find it in himself to blame her. Being here wasn’t likely at the top of her to do list. Being CEO of Stark Industries he was sure there were a million other things that she could have been doing, yet she was here, though why he wasn’t exactly sure. Was it just support for Tony or Rhodes? He decided to try and tactfully find out.
"I-I fell in the river. It was cold. I-I can swim though, no big deal, but then I looked up and I saw the building falling on top of me. Iron Man came outta nowhere, he shielded me and the bricks all fell on him instead- lots of them- "
After Ross had finally gotten in the elevator to leave, Rhodes had tried to open the door to the stairwell again, but FRIDAY kept it securely locked, reminding them that
Natasha was still angry at Tony, but back here safe in the Compound with this little family they had created, she felt some of her anger slowly melt away. She would have words with Tony later, right now she was Auntie Nat.
Tony’s fingers closed around his and returned some of the pressure and Steve’s teary eyes filled again as he let out a sound somewhere between and laugh and a sob when Tony’s cracked voice whispered, “Steve?”
Tony brought an arm up around James’ shoulders, receiving comfort as much as he was giving it. “I just wanted the nightmares to stop.” He whispered.
After some time, Tony was shocked to see just how far Barnes had come. He had pushed himself hard and demanded Tony run the simulations again and again until they were both exhausted.
Laura Barton and her three kids along with Scott Lang’s family were the other bright lights in his life, though they hadn’t been at first. During the “Civil War” he had made a judgement call that might go down in history as the only one he had ever made without it blowing up in his face. He had arranged for the Barton/Lang clan to be relocated before anyone could even think to use them. For the first months, while he was climbing out of the bottom of a Jack Daniels bottle, he had them hidden away with special protection. Only after things started to change in his life did he decide that they deserved more than to hide out for God only knew how long. He had them moved into their own secure floor of the newly remodeled Compound.
True to his word, Happy had them pulling up to the Compound about 30 minutes later. As they pulled up to the gate Tony rolled his window down and waved T'Challa's car up along side his window.
Steve was about to argue when he saw them all pulling out wallets and swapping money with each other. Natasha grinned triumphantly as she collected the largest sums.
FRIDAY’s response was sorrowful as she answered, “The connection had unexpected results, Boss. The BARF simulation information you had stored was essentially downloaded to her memory databanks. I tried to stop it but was unable to block it all. I am sorry, Boss.”
T'Challa couldn't help himself when he sat down next to Tony and allowed himself to join in the laughter, both men wiping the tears from their eyes.
"Secretary Ross, King T'Challa, to what do I owe the pleasure?" He plastered on a nonchalant grin as he folded his arms and leaned against the kitchen island counter.
With much effort, Steve tilted his chin upwards and opened his watery eyes to stare up into Tony’s soft brown ones. “There they are.” Tony’s lips lifted into a soft smile. “God, look at those beautiful eyes. I live for those, you know.” Tears continued to pour out of his eyes and onto the bed sheet covering Tony’s chest. “Been so scared.” He choked out as he clutched the sheets at Tony’s sides. Tony’s hand in his hair moved down to cup his upturned jaw and stroke his thumb over his cheek lovingly. “Can’t leave you just yet, Steve. Love you too damn much.” He whispered.
Once alone she turned immediately and put her arms around him. Confused, Steve returned the hug before pulling away and holding her by the shoulders. "Is everything alright Wanda, did something upset you?"
“He tried to hide it from me, but even Tony couldn’t hide being that broken. He loved you, did you know that?”
“So,” Clint said as they started to move towards the doors, “Do you think you’ll get the offer you wanted?”
Finally, he looks up from what he is doing with her arm. His eyes are intense and his gaze is impossible to read as he cuts her off. “Yes,
She didn’t know how to answer that. “I’m sure I had one, once. I don’t remember it and I don’t have any idea which one it was.” She felt his gaze on her as she answered. Stomping down on the feelings that she held on this subject she shrugged and pretended not to care.
that's what he always says, b-but there was a lot of blood, man. And his face is really banged up. I took a hit, I didn't see the bad guy, he was hiding. I wasn't paying enough attention- "
"Oh sunshine, that sounds perfect, exactly what I need right now. You go on ahead; I'll be right behind you." Tony gave her the best reassuring smile he could muster without splitting him lip open again. Peter gave her a smile and an enthusiastic nod.
“King T’Challa.” he greeted as cool and relaxed as he could manage in the moment. He gathered himself and pushed off the sink to stand up from his hunched position. By the time he had fully turned to face the African King he again assumed the Tony Stark image of calm and confidence. “What an interesting place for a meeting. I do believe I answered all of the questions the panel had for me for the day, however if you have more you can speak to my people about setting up another time to drill me for more useless information.”
Tony turned to look at everyone gathered around him. “Iron Man, War Machine, Black Widow, The Soldier, Vision, Hulk.”
“To save you, asshole. Everything I did, I did in because I thought I could save you all from the nightmare that I could not get out of my head no matter how much booze I bathed in, how many joints or cigarettes I chain-smoked. I can literally hear you in my head every time I close my fucking eyes.
Word would be put out that, wherever he was, The Winter Solider was welcome back to the United States, under a very strict contract that kept him under the supervision of Tony Stark and his Avengers.
“Peter not only got an A+ on his English paper than he’s been stressing about writing for the last few months, but he’s going to be presenting it at a writer’s conference upstate!”
T'Challa had responded understandingly, with a frustrating air about him that Steve couldn't help but feel communicated that T'Challa knew more than he was willing to say. Steve wanted to call him out on it, tell him not to keep secrets, but he could only picture the response the King would give him to a statement that hypocritical.
care for him and make the decision to leave. I truly do not understand why you are both so set upon only having one or the other."
Steve called out, “Nice job, Queens.” As he moved forward with Sam and stood at the ropes next to Peter, while James walked to the other corner.
Flashes from the cameras, shouting and applause drowned out any other sounds as Tony Stark exited the car, shaking Happy's hand and whispering something to him as he stood before turning toward the crowd. He looked absolutely… well, wonderful, if Sam was being honest, and he didn't even roll that way. His suit was a bright white with a dark blood red tie and matching pocket square, the whole thing tailored perfectly to fit his frame. He had his classic dark sunglasses covering his eyes, even though it was evening in New York City.
They sat in silence for a few more minutes before Wanda took a deep breath as if she wanted to say something, but released it again after a second thought. “Tony?” She finally asked in a small unsure voice. “Hmm?”
“Alright, everyone, get over here and introduce yourselves if you haven’t yet.” Before anyone could make a noise, Peter had literally jumped over the coffee table and couch and came to a skidding halt in front of Tony, Shuri, and T’Challa.
Tony pulled back and Steve got a good look at just how beautifully wrecked he looked in the low light. His lips red and swollen from being kissed and bitten, eyes dark, chest heaving. His husky voice was equally wrecked when he whispered, “Will you sleep here with me tonight?”
“Oh James, I didn’t know you thought of me like that, I’m flattered.” Bucky threw his head back and laughed loudly. “You wish, Stark.” Tony smiled as he struggled to get up from where he is pinned, “Well, I suppose I have always wondered just how much
Natasha moved off the couch and sunk to her knees in front of him. "Tony, you can't really think the rest of us would be okay fighting side by side with them after you left."
Steve took in Tony’s appearance as his chest rose and fell under the hospital sheets. His face was a bit pale and he had bruises and cuts on his body, but nothing looked overly concerning until he saw the multitude of bruises forming a ring around each of Tony’s wrists. The sight of the bruising caused by the handcuffs brought his anger back to the forefront of his mind and he felt his hands start to shake.
FRIDAY reported. “Got it, dim the lights to 35% FRI.” Tony called. The room suddenly dimmed and Tony reached over to press the button on Steve’s bracelet again. “Remember, don’t make a sound.” He reminded Steve.
Peter slung his backpack over his shoulder and left Steve standing by the ring, high fiving Shuri and fist bumping T’Challa on his way out of the training gym.
Leaning forward, Tony gently took her hand in his own. "Laura, sweetheart, I know. I'm not done though. Please, give me a little more of your time to explain. Can you do that for me, Mama Bird?"
About an hour later the elevator arrived on the floor again and Wanda, Clint, Natasha, Vision, and Bruce stumbled out. Wanda and Vision were supporting Clint between them, who had a bit of blood trickling from a cut on his forehead.
Scott scoffed at her comment, "Are you serious, Wanda? If I can go home, I'll share the same godman bed with Stark, I don't even care. I want to see my daughter."
Frustrated, he turned his attention back to the tablet. The video feed showed Wanda call Vision for some help. Vision came floating down the hallway, completely unprepared for what he was about to step into. Peter and Shuri hand their hands over their mouths, trying to stifle their laughter. Tony shushed them, trying to contain his own grin.
Tony turned towards him and laughed. "Me? Nothing. Hopefully I still have all of you. But after the others are back, I step down. I can't do this "Avenging" thing anymore. We all know I have my share of problems, I'm a liability at this point. Also, for my own reasons, I wont be able to work with the team, I know that and so do you."
Clint tried not to let the tears fall as he smiled and whispered back, “Sleep tight, baby. I love you.”
Tony wasn’t supposed to put himself on the line like this. Typical Tony. Typical self-sacrificing wonderful Tony. Steve wanted to get mad, but he wouldn’t. A year ago he would have been upset about it, he would have stormed in to Tony’s lab and gotten upset with him for putting himself in harms way. But this wasn’t a year ago, and James was right, they were all adults and he couldn’t make Tony’s choices for him. Truthfully, he was upset, but it didn’t matter. It was done, his name signed and Tony’s name next to it. Instead of focusing on it and reading way too much into the fact Tony had literally signed his life on the line next to Steve, he was going to make it worth Tony’s time and effort. Instead of continuing to pine away and be sad, he was going to channel his energy into making sure the risk they had taken was worth the reward. He was going to be the man Tony had thought he was before everything had gone wrong, better if he had his way. By the end there would be one certainty, Steve was going to put all of his effort into making the team the best it could be. After that Tony would have two options, either Tony would decide that he couldn’t stay and be a part of the team, or Tony could decide to stay and continue to fight with them. In the end it would be up to Tony, but Steve could do his best to make sure Tony saw a reason to stay if he wanted to.
"What did he want?" She asked as they made their way over to the elevator. "I honestly don't know, he wouldn't say. But I've been keeping an eye on the news." He replied as they stepped on and the doors closed.
“I was beginning to think you had forgotten me, Kitty Cat.” He said with a huge grin. “Tonight?” Yes, of course it’s alright, you know my home is your home. One condition, though, you bring that bright beautiful tech princess.” He paused for a moment to listen to the caller’s answer. “Of course I like her more than I like you. She and I were meant to be besties.” Another pause. “Don’t be such a sour-puss. I still love you, I just like her much better. Can you blame me?”
"I look great? Well sweetheart, I am completely flattered, though not entirely surprised. I should hope that I look good since I have to impress beautiful people like yourself. What's your name, gorgeous?"
"Ant-Man, get out of that building, its about to go down." Rhodes called. "I have a bomb signature popping up on my screen."
The teen let out a shaky breath before answering, "Uh yeah. Yeah the doc says that things are okay, he seems like he knows what he's taking about. I mean he's a doctor so he should. I don't know. Mr. Stark is awake, he's awake and talking, and he told me its okay. Miss Potts is trying to make him lay down for some more tests, but you know how he hates that. He said it wasn't my fault. But you know, I-I think maybe I did something wrong. He says I didn't but, uh, he always says that, even when I mess up big time.
Then one day a few months in he had gone up to the kitchen around 2 a.m. to find food after barricading himself in his lab on yet another 13-hour project without food or sleep. He had found her curled up on the couch in the dark, an open bottle of vodka on the coffee table, watching the heavy rain fall outside the Compound. Lightning lit up the sky every few minutes and the thunder was strong enough it nearly shook the walls.
The reporter pressed on, "Sir, what do you think about all of the politics lately, can you tell us, are you Team Iron Man or Team Captain America?"
“Who-who else made it?” Tony asked as he pulled back from the embrace slightly, keeping an arm around Steve but reaching with his other hand again for Rhodes who took it without question. “This is it, Tones. It’s just us now. Thanos, he got Vision. The rest…” He shook his head, unable to continue.
The next hour was spent with Tony screaming, cursing, breaking anything within his reach, and making sure that Ross knew explicitly how he felt about the plan that the Secretary thought he had been so brilliant to conjure up.
Natasha spent almost ten minutes dodging fireballs that fell from the sky before she fell into a pit of stuffed animals. Steve had tried valiantly to stay standing as he fought hand to hand with a terrorist cell while ankle deep in peanut butter. Rhodes was left stranded on top of the Empire State Building after a very large genetically engineered gorilla managed to disable his suit. Clint fought his way through an ant-farm, Sam ended up covered in green slime, James left a shower of purple glitter every time he moved, while Wanda was covered in soot from head to toe and her hair was slightly singed in spots.
Immediately, the air in the room changed and Tony's body language shifted. T'Challa nearly felt the man's walls come back up. "I'm not sure I've had enough sleep or enough booze to hear any messages from them tonight."
Steve swore as he stood up from the couch and ran his fingers through his hair. He should be there. He should be helping them. He wanted to break Ross with his bare hands, wanted the man to feel his rage for doing everything he had to Tony.
She felt her patience with the conversation thinning. “Look, Stark, I don’t even know what people on my planet look like. With the changes that have been made to me, there’s no way to know.”
suit. That man wears a Tom Ford three piece the same way he wears his Iron Man suit. Total grace and power. When Tony Stark walks into a business meeting, he is the definition of dominant.”
, don’t be controlling. You can’t conform everyone to Captain America Idealism. From the moment I brought those kids in the house I’ve been doing my very best. But you, you don’t get to come in here and decide when I get to have a bottle and when I don’t.”
They stop to refuel at a small backwater planet that Nebula warns him is a hot spot for all kinds of illegal activity and the worst kind of criminals. Here, they should be able to get what they need and mostly go unnoticed and get out. All that matters on this planet is currency and the shady business that earns it.
From the angle of the camera, Tony's face was hidden, but everything else could be seen clearly enough. The man in the stairwell trailed his mouth down Tony's neck, latching on to a spot just above the collar of his shirt, while his hands roamed Tony's chest before coming to rest on Tony's ass, pushing their hips flush against each other. The video cut before anything more could be seen, feed switching back to news anchors gathered around a table.
Tony was Peter’s family, and family was everything to him. Rogers had that same family and hadn’t appreciated it, in fact, he had thrown Tony away. So excuse him if he wasn’t ready to make nice with the Captain.
They watched as the two men attempted to talk. Tony started the conversation, but then lost his resolve and swiftly tried to shut it down. T’Challa hummed in a small approval as Steve didn’t let him get away with it. If they didn’t just talk, they would never fix it, and if was left up to Tony, they would never talk.
They were almost ready to give Wanda the green light when Peter, who was taking a drink of his soda, started to splutter all over the place while he held the tablet. Tony rolled his eyes. “Peter, use your words!” He admonished. Instead, Peter just tilted the tablet to show Tony the video feed of Steve walking down the hallway, probably to his room. No one had even seen the Super-Soldier walk past. “Oh shit.” Tony cursed as the jumped up and ran out of the room. The others all had their heads popped out of the guest room to watch Tony take off to try and catch Steve before he walked right into the trap.
"Alright everyone," Shuri exclaimed in excitement, "It is starting! Here we go, time to see my brother shine in the outfit I picked for him."
The world was a broken and desolate mess. Half the population, gone, with no prejudice. In Wakanda, they were left to try and clean up with absolutely no idea or plan of where to go or what to do next. All they can do is clean up. Destroy the carcasses of the alien monsters that had attacked, search for the bodies that remained of those who fell, and help the wounded. To continue on, ever forward.
T'Challa, however, remained stoic, his face unchanged until he forced a small smile and answered, "I find this to be a very interesting question. Of course, there is no right answer, is there? I believe that perhaps what we are failing to see is that they are two sides of the same coin. I do not see the world nor the choices we are forced to make to be so simple. I believe both men to be great leaders and worthy of recognition and praise. In fact, I pray we return to the truth I know we are all aware of, that both men were at their best when they were side by side."
"The public is going to get to know James Buchannan Barnes and the torture he went through to become the assassin who took out Howard and Maria Stark. Many news outlets are already working on turning up information on his life, and we can no longer stop them. So, we have no choice but to give it to them. The best way to spin this is to expose Hyrda's actions. The world is finally going to get to see The Winter Soldier up close and personal. There will be public outcry in a matter of hours."
Steve noticed that the calls he participated in were always carefully timed. They never happened with Tony or any of the other Avengers around. He tried and failed to not let that hurt him personally.
“We just thought we’d play tagalong today, that’s all. Clint issued a challenge this morning and well, you know me, I couldn’t just let him win.” Natasha said as she smoothly slid out from her perch over Steve’s shoulder and began to walk over to the table with Bruce and Thor trailing after her.
Tony stood back up slowly and leaned on the counter, a hand still pressed to the middle of his chest. Seeing that Clint was eyeing the movement, he dropped his hand and straightened abruptly, turning back toward the coffee maker.
They all stood quietly and shifted their weight for a few long moments. Tony cleared his throat and Steve thought for a moment that he was going to volunteer, which was surprising since Tony had yet to train in any of the simulations with them. His injuries had prevented it at first but he had since healed, and while Tony would spar with James and a few of the others, he was always on the sidelines or absent when the team engaged in simulation training. Steve knew that his presence was the main, if not the only, contributing factor in Tony’s refusal to participate. Today though, Rhodes had all but demanded it, insisting that Tony be there with them now.
Finally, Tony cracked as Laura and Maggie were scrubbing a washcloth over Vision’s cheek, squishing his cheeks together and making him look like a fish. “Oh come on, Vis, you have to admit it was funny!” Vision’s look only darkened. “Oh really, Tony, I
“No please, Tony, please don’t. It was my fault. I lied to you, I didn’t mean to hurt you, I swear I didn’t. I’m so sorry I left you, I’m so sorry it split the team.”
It was early evening when Rocket came running into the hall in which they were all gathered. He was clutching a piece of tech in his paws as he told them he made contact with The Guardian’s ship.
Tony's face softened, "Oh? Allow me to be your tour guide, I know all the best stops. The first stop is; you don't have to be anything for anyone other than yourself. You spent so long being "Bucky" for Rogers, and then even longer being "no one" for Hydra. Who do you want to be?"
. And guess what? My answer will haunt me and hurt me long after any of the physical pain has healed."
They knew Tony had come home, Steve had watched his car pull into the garage of the Compound from his bedroom window. He had immediately excused himself after the press conference broadcast ended, going to his room and locking the door. Every time he left a room he had people follow him and tried to talk to him. While he usually appreciated it, he couldn’t help but feel the need for some alone time.
Upon seeing Steve’s pleading and puppy dog eyes, Dianne led Steve and James to Tony’s room where Natasha was sitting in a chair she had pulled up to Tony’s bedside and was resting her hand on top of Tony’s. Her eyes were red from crying but she smiled at them and stood from the chair as they entered. Steve took long strides and would have fallen to his knees at Tony’s bedside if Natasha hadn’t guided him in to her vacated seat. The whole time, his eyes never left Tony’s unconscious form. James extended a hand to Natasha and pulled her into a comforting hug before closing the door behind them and walking back to the waiting area with the others.
Steve finally tore his tired eyes from Tony and looked into Rhodes’ serious face. “I never told you about Afghanistan. I was a wreck when the Humvees were attacked and Tony was taken prisoner. I couldn’t eat or sleep and I refused to even try for days afterwards. While he was gone I’d go on stretches for days where I didn’t do anything but pour over maps and join the soldiers who were out looking for him. I was completely consumed by the need to find him. See cause I was his friend, I was supposed to have his back, and the moment that I didn’t, he was gone.”
Tony’s suit had unexplainably powered down halfway through his tussle with a large assassin in the jungle during a down pouring of rain, forcing him out of the suit, only for him to fall face first into grape jelly. Of course, the comments about Steve’s peanut butter and Tony’s jelly had been endless.
Sitting aboard the Milan traveling through space might have once been a dream come true for Tony Stark. After New York, it should have been an experience that drove him into a debilitating anxiety attack. Now, however, it provoked nothing in him as he sat and stared blankly out the ship to the vast darkness of space. He was too numb to feel anything at all. Apart from her giving him instructions how to pilot the ship, neither he or Nebula had spoken much since she helped him limp to the ship back on Titan. He hadn’t said a word, only silently let her patch him up with the few materials she found on the ship. Even when her inexperienced fingers prodded him in ways that should have easily been painful, he barely flinched.
Tony's wry smile looked a bit more like a grimace. "I never meant to blame Barnes. I did in the moment and I attacked him, yes, but I never should have. My pain was in the betrayal of my teammate for the lie and part he played in hiding the biggest loss in my life. He knew that the person he was throwing everything away for was the person who had taken everything from me. So, I tried to take away what mattered to him." He shrugged, eyes full of guilt. "I don't have anything to say worth hearing to excuse how wrong and pathetic that is, and I know that. There isn't anything I can do to change it now; all I can do is fix what I can. And I can fix Barnes."
T’Challa sat down and pulled out his phone, dialing a number and holding it to his ear as he answered. “You heard what was said at the press conference. As your guardian, Tony signed his name on the line next to each and every one of you.” Steve cut in, “I thought that was just if we did something wrong. They don’t have solid proof that Wanda did anything, and we all know she didn’t, there’s no way she left the Compound.”
Finally, it becomes clear that even in their despair, they need to figure things out. They need to understand if they can. The sudden appearance of a man who introduced himself as Wong starts them on that path. They all gather in the old throne room, the air heavy. Thor and Bruce tell their part of the tale to their gathered audience, Thor continuing from the point that Bruce was sent back to Earth. Natasha and Steve do their best to fill in the blanks of the story with their path. Bruce fills them in on falling to Earth and landing in The Sanctum, asking for Tony.
Bucky's first few days at the Compound were filled with silence, other than the few times FRIDAY has addressed him, and waiting for Stark to show up. The only floor he was allowed on was the floor that housed Tony's lab, which had been extended by knocking out some walls and setting up new safety protocols throughout the entire Compound.
Peter was far from a dumb kid though and the media had made sure nearly everyone saw a few of his more public scenes. They hadn’t talked about it together, but Tony had listened to every message Peter had left him, many of them were just the kid rambling about things happening in his life, with friends, school, and his aunt. There were a few though, where Peter would say he hoped that he didn’t let what people said get to him, that Tony was “really great man, just really really great, like SO good…and cool as shit. C-can I say that? It’s too late, I said it. Shit. Oh Shit-I said it again.” and Peter felt like he “needed to make sure Tony heard someone say it”. Tony wondered if Peter knew that he treasured those messages, saving them on FRIDAY’S private server.
Between that thought and the progress they had made with BARF, he thought he finally saw a light at the end of this long road. Tears sprung to his eyes as he sat in Tony's chair.
He came walking back into the communal area and took in the sight around him. Everyone was still gathered in the kitchen and television areas. Clint was on the couch, Nate perched happily on his knee, Laura hovering nearby. She may not have forgiven Clint for everything the family had been put through, but she seemed happy to see her kids and their father together again. Steve really hoped that she and Clint could work it out. He hoped they could find happiness together again.
“Let’s go Stark, we’ve got the press waiting for us outside. I know how much you like showing off, let’s see what they think of you in handcuffs.” Ross said as he stepped into the elevator. The guards flanked Tony and surrounded him as they retreated to split some of them in elevator and the rest taking the stairwell to prevent the Avengers from cutting them off.
Sam smiled at the mention of the princess as well, he had heard the story and laughed with the rest of them, much to the unamused glare of the King himself.
He stood in front of his exiles gathered around him on the couches just as they had done with James Barnes months ago.
Everyone stood in silence, no one moving until Tony said exasperated, "Did I stutter? Come on, go. In the next simulation we will have Bruce join us. He won't be the hulk, but he will control a simulation version of him from the balcony with me."
Tony smiled a bit as T'Challa's surprised gaze snapped back to his. "Might this have anything to do with the proposal I made to you this morning?"
“Is that all you’ve got Rambo?” Tony wheezed. “I went toe to toe with two super soldiers. That felt like a love tap.” The guard struck out at Tony’s stomach again snapping the gun upward and connecting with Tony’s nose, which the implant reported was now pouring blood.
T'Challa stayed silent, just letting the other man work through the feelings he obviously felt he couldn't confide in any of his other team members. He was Steve's right hand man, after all, his constant support and near lifeline since they had arrived.
The relief flooding the King's eyes was nearly laughable. It was like the man was drowning and Tony was his human life preserver.
Tony thought back to months ago when T’Challa had approached him after yet another UN hearing dealing with the aftereffects of what the media had dubbed “Civil War”. Things had been at an all time low.
As Steve passed Tony he was able to pull himself together enough to throw Tony a small shy smile before his eyes found the floor again. He was nearly out the door when Tony’s hand shot out to grab his bicep. The grip was strong but gentle and there wasn’t any force behind it.
“Maybe I should go for the Barton and Lang families.” Ross whispered. Tony’s head snapped up at that. “Yes, I know you’ve been playing house with them. Very foolish of you. Haven’t you learned that anyone you consider family ends up dead? Those innocent children, you wont be around to protect them anymore.”
On his knees, Steve took Tony’s free hand in his so that he was holding both of Tony’s perfect hands in his. “Please listen, please, just let me talk.” Tony looked like he was about to argue, but Steve gave his hands a short squeeze and began.
For the next few hours they all tried to get a little bit of rest, but Steve found it impossible for him to actually fall asleep. His mind and heart were racing each minute they grew closer to being home. And for him, he truly did consider it his home. Anywhere his team was, anywhere Tony was, that was home for Steve. He wasn't naïve, T'Challla and Colonel Rhodes had made it clear what he could expect, which sounded like next to nothing. Steve would take that. For the rest of his life he would take next to nothing and be happy, as long as Tony was there.
“So, no sloppy kiss yet?” She said, without beating around the bush. His cheeks heated a little bit as he ducked his head and looked away. “That’s alright, you are terribly old fashioned. A few dates first, yes?” Shaking his head at her he motioned for her to sit at his desk as he sat across from her on the foot of the bed. “What can I do for you princess?”
He stepped closer and rested a hand on her elbow before leaning in to whisper in her ear. "Nat, I made sure the camera is following me. I know this seems stupid, but its important. I'm a big boy, I can take care of myself. It's just a little make out session. I'll be careful and I promise I will explain it later."
Steve's head hung and he shook his head. "I can't tell you that right now Sam, I am so so sorry, I promise that I will, I just think that if I talk about this right now I might… God, Sam, I might break."
“All the power they wield, but they never overstep. Can you imagine if they didn’t have the morals that they do? The things and people they could take advantage of?”
The elevator bell made a ding and the doors slid open to allow the group of people inside to step out onto the floor. Rhodey was the first one out, speaking softly with Pepper who was shaking her head and making quick hand gestures at whatever he was telling her. Tony and Rhodes shared a hug before Tony turned and gently pulled Pepper into a soft hug paired with a kiss on her cheek, which she returned. They were followed out by the King of Wakanda and Princess Shuri.
A small cry from the baby monitor on the counter alerted everyone that Nate was awake. Tony sprung up before anyone else had moved and yelled “I call dibs!” as he ran for the empty guest room where Laura had laid Nate down for his nap.
“Lets play musical chairs for a second.” Tony said, as he started to come around to the passenger’s side instead. Sam stared at the keys in his hand. “Wha- Are you serious?” Tony slapped him on the back as he passed him and opened the passenger door instead and began to get in. “If you crash my car, I will have FRIDAY take over Red Wing’s system and he will spend the rest of his mechanical life bringing me coffee.” Tony said with a smile.
"I won't push you into anything, you can admit it on your own time, but we all know that you haven't told us all the entire story. Something is slowly killing Captain America, and it's doing a better job of it than any other obstacle he's encountered."
Tony raised his eyes to meet James’ inquiring look. “Are you seriously gonna tell me that you aren’t sure if that idiot is in love with you? Cause, boy, I’ve known him nearly all his life, and I ain’t never seen him do any of this adorable shit.”
The three of them sped down the streets to the nearest grocery store leaving behind the oppressive situation the Compound couldn’t help but constantly remind them of. They pulled into the store parking lot and James snagged a cart out of the cart return as they walked in.
Trying to get himself under control, Tony kept wiping at his eyes and said, “This is my favorite day!”
She watched as a camera crew followed Tony's path to the stairwell and for a moment she considered putting a stop to this whole charade, before remembering Tony's words. He had said it was important and he had basically asked her to trust him. If she put a stop to whatever plan he was in the middle of, it would make him think she didn't trust him. Sighing, she let the camera crew pass her.
He stopped in his tracks when he saw her tear-streaked cheeks. He had never seen her cry. Hell, he had hardly seen any emotions from the Black Widow that didn't end with her breaking bones. It dawned on him as he rounded the couch and sunk to his knees in front of her that this wasn't the Black Widow he was seeing; hell it was hardly even Natasha.
He wished more than anything that the others would be here. He wished Tony would come waltzing through the door any moment with that smirk on his face as he made a witty joke. Steve always rolled his eyes at him when he did those things, but truthfully he loved every moment. He loved the self assured smug way that Tony carried himself. The way that everyone he spoke to was on equal terms. Tony didn't mince words, he would say the same thing to a politician that he would say to anyone else, and he wouldn't regret it later. He didn't shy away from a fight, no matter who it was with. And his smile, the genuine smile, not the fake one that he flashed for cameras, that smile was beautiful and it was everything Steve lived for.
He had been shocked to see that Stark has actually set up a nice arrangement for him inside the secure area. He had a sizeable bedroom and bathroom, a living space with a television and other gadgets he wasn't sure he should even attempt to touch, and a kitchen stocked with all kinds of foods.
"Well, that was Mr. Tony Stark, and it sounds to this reporter like he is more than physically recovered and better off than anyone had guessed! We will be right back here at the Stark Charity Gala!"
The sleek QuinJet landed on the runway, taking Steve's breath away. Was Tony inside? The thought that Tony may be only a few moments away was both thrilling and terrifying to him. How would Tony react?
James gave Sam a thumbs up. “Honestly Sam, did you even read the thing before you signed?” He said as he walked backwards towards the elevator after Tony.
Steve had to bite his tongue in order to stay quiet now. He wanted more than anything to stand up and beat Ross to a pulp. Tony must have sensed Steve stiffen next to him, that or he guessed that this new line of interrogation would set Steve off. Either way, Tony pulled their connected hands off of the counter and under it, setting it on Tony’s knee and Tony clasping Steve’s hand tightly in his own.
Wanda and Vision were tucked into a corner together, speaking quietly. Steve’s feelings were more than a little conflicted about her. He had protected her for a long time, but after what he witnessed this afternoon, he felt a little bit sick looking at her. There was no way that Tony had actually forgiven her as easily as he had made it seem. The woman had gotten into his head, stoked his greatest fears and lit the flame into a blaze. Tony didn’t trust people as it was. Steve felt like he was on the edge of an unsteady cliff and he didn’t know which way to step.
The crowd was silent. “Layman’s terms; if the Captain screws up, its on me as well. He goes to prison; I go to prison.” The seemed to be a sufficient answer, because the next reporter was already moving on with the next question.
He sat on the bed for another few minutes before he heard the rumble of engines. Twisting around he watched from the window as an unmistakably Wakanda–esque craft rounded the Compound and landed on the tarmac. Pulling himself together he stood up and tried to compose his thoughts. Tony was right, he needed to be more than just a leader if this team was going to succeed. He could do this, he just had no idea whereto start.
After pulling into the compound and parking he dismissed Happy and thanked him for everything he did, giving him the day off tomorrow.
Both Bucky and Rhodes sighed. "Damn it, I told you guys that we should have taken those assholes out with one of Tony's long range missiles."
“Wanda-” Again she cut him off. “I didn’t read his mind or use my magic if that is what you are worried about.” He opened his mouth to disagree with her assumption, but she continued again. “Our time in Wakanda he never stopped thinking about you and missing you. His guilt is eating him up, just as yours is. Please, Tony, I care greatly for Steve. You don’t need to say anything, I just wanted to make sure you know that you have many people who love you, but Steve, he is
Tony sat in his lab blankly staring at one of the many screens he had up. He was trying to distract himself with work and honestly, it wasn’t working as well as it usually did. Clint coming to him had been a little bit of a shock. Scott’s conversation hadn’t amazed him as much, after all they didn’t have history and Scott fighting for Rogers wasn’t a personal betrayal. But Clint had come to him and apologized, not for his actions but for the pain they caused, which was so much better. The actions couldn’t be changed, but Clint’s acknowledgement that he understood and was sorry for the pain, that was a bit of healing that Tony wasn’t ashamed to admit he had needed.
"Actually," Steve said, his voice channeling the voice they all knew so well as his "Cap Voice", "I think I would like a play by play. The whole story."
"What the hell Tony, what kind of a plan involved you making out like a horny teenager in the stairwell at your Gala, huh?" Pepper was positively livid at this point. "You promised me Tony, you promised you would be on your best behavior tonight! Is this what you would call your best behavior?"
Tony turned away from him at that, picking up his tablet and swiping through some information. His silence lasted so long Steve thought he wasn't going to answer at all. He began to feel so awkward he started to turn to head towards the elevator when he heard Tony's voice.
"I should take off the news alert on my phone, the one I told you about. Every time something happens I get a news alert about it and god help me, I am always afraid it is something horrible. I'm afraid I will see a photo of him dead, only unlike my dreams, this time it will be real." He signed heavily as he continued, "In my dream it's me that kills him, I've told you this a million times, but its always me that does it. I bring that shield down on him and… Now I am so afraid that I will see a picture of him dead and it will be real and it will
He had never been in Tony's bedroom, and he had never heard Tony's AI sound so nervous. "What's going on FRIDAY, you sound worried?"
The photos made his heart swell with love and with loss. He missed these things. Tony had saved his families lives, but he had also invited them into his own home and then made it their own. He might have felt anger and jealousy, except that there were more pictures. He and Laura dancing together at their very private wedding. The day Cooper was born, Clint holding him with reverence. The day Lila was born, Clint helping Cooper hold his new sister. A fishing trip they had taken as a family, Clint and Cooper holding up a large trout for the camera. Nathaniel asleep on his chest. He and Laura, cuddled together in a blanket on the porch of the farmhouse. Additionally, he noticed all the pictures of the Lang family in the same fashion.
The people Tony had allowed to seeing footage of Siberia was one thing. To have the others not only see it but see it in the simulation room was another level that he was sure must be hurting Tony greatly, although he was being careful to hide it under his bluster and façade.
He didn’t have to wait long before the bathroom door opened and Tony stepped out, wearing nothing but his underwear as well. Steve didn’t even bother trying to hide his staring now. He took in every beautiful inch of Tony’s tan and toned body. Tony didn’t show it off very often, but Steve had always known that Tony’s body looked just as good as the rest of them, his just being more lean muscle instead of bulk.
Tony's sigh sounded tired. "He's family now, Laura, I can't imagine this place without his homework spread all over every surface. And the other kids are attached to him. Which brings us to the elephant in the room. Have you spoken to Clint yet?"
Laura Barton stood from the kitchen chair and walked over to where Tony had made it back to the largest couch before he had collapsed onto it with the three children hanging off his body. Tony's hands reached out with grabby hands as he said "Oh yes, gimme that little butterball!" and reached for the chubby baby she had in her arms. She lowered Nathaniel onto his lap and Tony's arms circled around the child protectively. After doing so she stepped back and immediately put her hands on her hips.
Rhodey softened a tiny bit as he pushed Tony’s hand off his shoulder and gave him a gentle shove away from him. “Go on then, get out of here, you stink.”
She had pushed Tony for information on Pepper and he had given it freely. When she had questioned him about Steve Rogers though, she felt his walls come back up, hard. Even with the amount of alcohol in his system, he was tight lipped about everything that had to do with Captain America. Interesting, she thought, and filed the information away for later.
Tony stopped suddenly and help very still before slowly turning to face Bucky on the couch. "Uh…No. No I don't." He sighed and ran a hand over his face. "Damn, me and my big mouth."
The unfairness was stifling to him. Here Tony was, trying to help them all, taking care of the families that Clint and Scott had left behind, offering to give Steve his friend back and Barnes his life back. It made him sick not to be able to tell them the truth.
. On defensive in an instant she felt for her knife in the strap attached to her thigh and as she turned she threw it by the hilt into the shadows. The shape barely moved in time to escape the sharp plunge of the blade.
Steve felt tears on his face as he sank to the ground with a sob. He watched James shake himself out of the trance and run forward to Tony.
"You wandered away from your teammates, would you care to explain to them why?" He said, sweeping his arm out in a gesture of invitation.
If Steve's eyes got any wider they might pop out of his head. "It's fine man, I'm not judging anything, I need you to know that right now. You are my friend and I want you to be happy, and right now man, happy is the last thing you are. I know its because of him, I know it's because of what happened. The issue is that I don't actually know what happened."
So here they are, Tony on the phone with T'Challa. He can hear the Kings smug smile from half a world away and nearly wishes he could smack it off of him.
If Tony was being truthful, the kindness from the King meant the world to him. Tony would have expected that with everything the King had seen and heard, he would have found the man beneath the armor more trouble that he was worth. There were very few people in his life these days who willingly spent time with him, let alone praise his friendship or honor. It was almost unsettling. He simply didn’t know how to respond.
They had spoken about how Tony and the others called him James and how he liked it because it made him feel like someone new. Not someone from the past but someone finding himself now. He had understood, and promised himself he would do his best to give his friend that.
Steve stepped forward and held out an arm in front of her which one of the guards struck with an object that sent an electric current through his body so strong he fell hard to his knees. He heard the exclamations from his team behind him and knew that he needed to calm the situation down before it got any more out of hand. He tried to get to his feet but his muscles were still contracting from the electrocution and weren’t cooperating.
James didn’t look at him as he put a bag of chips from a display in their basket as they walked by. “Yeah, they’re little disks of butterscotch mixed with-”
He had Rhodey and Pepper, of course, but that was different. Rhodey was his best friend, and had been for as long as Tony could remember. Rhodey hadn’t deserted him, even in Afghanistan the man had been in the helicopters that had rescued him, never giving up on the idea Tony was alive and would make it through.
Bucky's voice was gentle. "Hey bud. Widow filled us in on the situation. Tony's okay, alright? He's okay. Everything will be fine, is he still in with the doctors?"
Unfortunately for Tony, he was still stuck to Steve and Steve had the advantage of more weight. He sat where he was and wouldn’t budge. Tony’s eyes flashed dangerously. “You have about five seconds to stand up Rogers, or I promise you this wont end well.”
Steve and the rest of the team who had to stay behind gathered together in the communal area where Shuri and Peter quickly set up something like a command center. They had speakers patched in to the team’s comms and visual of the scene from the vantage of each team member’s, thanks to the camera’s implemented in each member’s outfit.
James laughed at that with a nod. “Too bad they’re both so set on guilt and blame. They could share them together.”
“I was so tired of being Captain America! I wanted to be Steve again, just for a while, and the only one who could even help me know how to do that was him. But the whole world was coming down on him. You don’t understand Tony; you weren’t on that train in 1945. Bucky died because of me, he fell because I couldn’t save him. I watched him fall off of that train. What kind of hero can’t save the people he cares about, his
"I've been keeping up with them, actually, so I know about the other changes you have already made in the past few months. Is it just a coincidence that they are all things that each of us have expressed our doubts over?"
Tony shrugged, “Alright you don’t have to admit it, but it’s true.” Next to him, Steve snorted as he covered his mouth with his hand again, trying to hide his laugh, eyes wide. Vision tuned his glare on him, which honestly only made it worse. “I’m glad you find this funny, Captain Rogers.” He said in a miffed tone. That only made Tony and Steve start to giggle again, their hands still stuck together on top of the table. Steve thought he heard a noise and looked around, his eyes connecting with Shuri, who had just snapped another picture of them. He wanted to be annoyed about that, but at her genuinely happy smile, he found any annoyance or worry melt away. Besides, Tony hadn’t noticed.
“No.” Tony answered simply. “What happened to needing to trust your teammates?” Steve pressed. “We wont be teammates.” Tony said thickly. “What?” Steve breathed out.
T'Challa nodded his agreement and Tony handed him a glass of champagne, lifting it in a toast to seal the agreement. "Well then Salem, I'll expect you tonight as soon as we can both get out of this lovely hellhole."
Tony stepped back and broke the moment, the smile still on his face as he turned back to the coffee maker.
Thor laid a large but gentle hand on Tony’s shoulder. “It is good to see you, my friend. I feared we had lost you. I am glad to find otherwise.”
Still, she refused to call him Captain. He had to admit, it stung a bit. "What happened? Why weren't we alerted?" He was already up out of his seat, getting ready to grab his gear.
T’Challa chuckled at Tony’s worship of his little sister. “No, I’m serious, you can’t have Wakanda and her, buddy, you’ve got to give up one of them. I’ll make this easy for you, I want her.”
Vision's voice in his ear appraised the situation, saying, "Captain, the dominoes were set up to trap us in the center of the city with too many civilians and no escape route."
“He did well.” Nebula continued. She continued to stare deep into Steve’s eyes as she said it. “He got in more hits than anyone else, he even made him bleed.”
Shaking his head at how truly helpful having the AI was he responded, “Thank you FRIDAY, you really are an amazing gal.”
What could he say, now faced with the Wakandan who knew too much, and yet did not set fire to Tony’s life even further by telling anyone? Just as he was trying to scramble for something close to a response, the King spoke again.
“Because you made a stupid decision! You should have left; you should have continued on! We have a mission and a purpose and-”
At the mention of Sam's name, Tony visibly relaxed a bit. "Dear Sammy, huh? Let me guess, something about not being the friend he asked me to be?"
Tony felt his patience wear thin. He was exhausted from playing the part of a different person all night. All he really wanted right now was to smoke a joint to relax and go to sleep. Since that wasn't an option with the kids around, sleep would have to be good enough.
Tony did his best to suppress a smirk as his eyes landed on the King, who was indeed trying to politely edge away from the older woman who was clearly leering at him under her pancaked makeup and claw like hand resting on his bicep. "Well, lets go see if we can offer him a way out that doesn't involve the old bag taking off his suit, shall we? Let me know if the cameras show up again."
"Wait," Steve called, holding up a hand. "So if he lashes out during his treatment and hurts someone, even accidentally, this guardian will pay the price?"
Steve spent the next two weeks following through on his new plan. He spends hours reading the books that FRIDAY got for him. Each time one is delivered he is overjoyed at seeing the package on the counter and disappears into his room. He takes them with him to see Dr. Field, and together they discuss how things are going and healthy ways to endure grief and loss. It’s the best Steve has felt in a long time. He’s hardly seen Tony, but that’s been okay, mostly. He just focuses on getting to know his team-
Next to Steve, Scott was trying to catch Cassie's eyes, but the small brunette resolutely kept her eyes on her mother.
.” Tony’s face changed instantly. He gave Peter a sidelong look and then glanced at Shuri, who’s face had broken out into what Steve could only describe as a shit-eating grin. Tony released Peter instantly and turned to T’Challa. “My good King, I beg your pardon, but I have pressing matters to attend to with my glorious science children. Science Squad, we are now assembling in the lab! You know who you are, lets go, get in the elevator!” He waved his arms in giant swinging motions to get them moving.
“Peter asked me that the other day, when I got distracted by you after your boxing session.” Tony’s eyebrow quirked in response. “I didn’t answer him, but the truth now is the same as it was then; I see someone I love.”
Flashing his best winning smile, he was about to brush past the King and leave when the King’s next words stopped him in his tracks.
Tony's eyes weren't blazing with hate, grief, or anger; they were tired, the bruising only highlighting that fatigue. Steve felt like he could drown in them.
“I’m not looking for a room, I like mine.” Steve answered. Tony made a noncommittal sound in return.  Having Steve watch him like this was making Tony more uncomfortable by the second. This was bound to come to some kind of confrontation and he would be damned if he let his emotions get the better of him while he was holding Nathaniel. Suddenly, Tony opened his big mouth.
"Tony." Natasha almost growled out his name. "Do you have any idea what you looked like tonight. Do you?"
Sam's resolve strengthened. "At the raft, we spoke and I told you where Cap and Barnes had gone. You promised me you would go as a friend, Stark. You promised me that you would go to them as a friend and help, and I don't know how- "
The next few days were full of simulations and training sessions. None of them went overly well, but none of them went as catastrophically wrong as that first one. Tony avoided Steve and everything do with with him, arriving right before they began and exiting immediately once they were over.
Sam was about to answer when Tony came strutting back up to them with his arms full of various candy and snacks. He dumped them into their basket with a large smile. When Sam gave him an incredulous look at the sheer number of items he only smiled perkier. “What? It’s for the kids. Well, most of it. The Pringles are mine, so don’t even look at them, Wilson.” He said, shaking a finger at Sam, who raised his hands in surrender.
“Hmm.” Was the only noise Tony made, his head tipped back against the headboard and his eyes closed.
Clint scowled in his direction. "Natasha and I have been friends for a lot longer than any of you have known her, Colonel."
FRIDAY was a comfort to him. He missed Jarvis, but he wasn't sure he should feel that way with Vision around. Vision had been a great friend, though often a silent presence, he was always there for Tony.
He rolled his eyes hearing T’Challa’s low chuckle. “You must be feeling victory, at least, my friend? After all, is this not what we have been striving towards?”
T’Challa found himself in awe, not for the first time, of how the pain of the past shaped the future. Even more so, he was impressed with how a person’s pain could tear lives apart, only to then mend them back together. What happened with Tony, James, and Steve was horrible, in every way. It had hurt people and broken trust, and yet, he was seeing a new level to the Avengers, one that hadn’t been there before and one that had the promise of making them so much stronger. The irony wasn’t lost on him that in order to build this trust and bond, the previous trust had to be absolutely decimated.
Tony huffed at that, “Touché. That’s Ste-Rodgers fault though.” Clint didn’t miss how Tony couldn’t say Steve’s name, but he chose not to comment.
Scott stumbled and reached for the suit, taking it in his hands and smiling. He shot Tony a look before nudging him with his shoulder and correcting him, "It's Ant-Man, my guy. Its not that hard."
Steve almost dies on the spot. What the hell? Since when are Natasha and Tony – fonduing? And why in the hell was it happening around lunch time in the shared kitchen? He feels jealousy rear its ugly head. Judging by the looks on everyone else’s faces, their thoughts are along the same lines. Scott’s face is bright red with embarrassment. Clint’s face is red, though Steve doubts it’s for the same reason, since he looks ready to kill.
T'Challa recovered from the spectacle unfolding in front of him enough to barley step out of the elevator and on to the floor before the doors closed on him.
Tony was quiet for a second before he finally said, “…Well, hindsight is 20/20, isn’t it? You recovered just fine.” Steve’s voice was hoarse as he squeezed Tony’s hand in his and said, “I don’t think I ever recovered.”
, the exiled Avengers would soon be able to return to New York. T’Challa and Tony had worked together for months to insure that everything was perfect. Or as least as perfect as this shitstorm of a situation could be. Tony had to admit, he was actually surprised it had come together this well, considering where they had started.
Flying over a large city, it was fairly obvious that things weren’t in very good condition. Tony remarked that no one reacting as they entered the atmosphere and nothing since was not a good sign. They landed on a large platform near an odd building with large grounds. The Avengers Compound, Tony had called it with a shake of his head.
One day he came back from his run a little bit earlier than usual. The rain had washed out his favorite path and left him soaking wet, forcing him to turn back early.
After that Steve barely heard or saw anything. He doubled over, holding his stomach as the violence erupted around him. He heard himself beat Tony, he heard every time Tony hit him. He felt dizzy.
"What does that mean, Stark?" Clint snapped, suddenly appearing on the ground next to Steve and James.
She nodded, "Yeah, yeah they said he's alright. Already telling them he wants to go home." Bucky snorted at that. "And the kid?"
Laura’s smile fell slightly. “They are a rollercoaster, to be honest. One second it’s alright, another second the fragile peace is shattered.” She leaned in and lowered her voice, “Something bad happened this afternoon. Natasha said that the team walked in on Tony using his BARF technology to relive memories. They’re all really shaken up.” T’Challa leaned in closer at that. “What memories?” He asked her. She shrugged. “She said Siberia and one other one, but I don’t know what it was. She wasn’t ready to say.” T’Challa raised a hand to cover his mouth in thought.
. It seemed like years ago that Tony used to make fun of Steve, asking if he ever thought of competing in Ultimate Frisbee. Steve didn’t know why she was whispering, but he wasn’t about to ask, so he leaned forward slightly and whispered back, “Do you like to play Frisbee?”
They released each others hands and for a moment Tony felt like he could breathe, like he could do this. The feeling was short lived however, when St-Rogers decided to open his mouth.
Steve felt himself tear up at that. God, he was so pathetic, but Tony standing here, even with his back to him, talking to him, it was something Steve thought he would never get again.
“Hey Peter, what’s going on?” Maggie asked, leaning against the counter and watching the kid with a fond look.
"This wasn't supposed to happen. Zemo wasn't supposed to win. I can't even begin to understand how it was that we got here. At the raft Stark- Tony- he promised to go to Steve as a friend. He
“There is no team.” He shot back quickly, his eyes snapping back to the King’s. “Only a few broken individuals trying to salvage what was left behind.”
Once they were back at the Compound they were greeted by the Barton and Lang children, all clamoring for Tony and rapid firing questions about his health and when he would be well enough to play games and go on adventures again. Laura and Clint stood in the background and Steve noticed that Clint had an arm wrapped around Laura’s waist. He gave Clint a pointed look and smile which Clint returned proudly. Tony indulged the children and gave them his undivided attention until Steve noticed his slower blinks and a growing tiredness in his eyes.
Sam and Steve now sat against the wall in the basement in silence. Steve was slowly starting to relax a little bit and the anger that had been there before now faded to simple sadness.
Bucky dove behind a car as Steve crouched behind his shield and called to Peter, "Spider-Man get down on the ground!"
"Clint, don't let anger or jealously blind you. Those kids love their Uncle Tony, so if you want your family back, don't try and take them. Try joining them. Whether you," She turned to everyone in the room, "any of you, think so or not, Tony Stark is a hero and he's done a lot for you."
Opening it and tilting it to give her a look inside, her breath caught in her throat. Inside the box was a set of the most beautiful and brilliant white pearl necklaces she had ever laid eyes on. Tony took the necklace out of the box and motioned for her to turn around. She gathered her hair out of the way for him as he fastened it around her neck.
“I am here for a criminal.” Ross barked. He nodded to the guard on his right, who held up a tablet and tapped the screen. The footage was clear enough to make out Wanda stalking down the tiled hallway of what looked to be some kind of a government building. Security guards approached her and with a wave of her glowing red hands, their necks were snapped, the bodies landing on the floor at grotesque angles. She took out the next wave of security with matching brutality, their blood pooling on the white tiled floor. Steve felt suddenly light headed watching the recording. Maybe it was old footage, from before Ultron?
He and Tony had worked well together, despite what everyone else seemed to think. They carried the weight of the team together. Steve had been shocked when Tony had casually fallen into step behind him, deferring to his judgement to lead the team. Tony had pretended that it was easy, that it wasn't a big deal. They both knew differently and it had been touching for Steve to know that a man like Tony had trusted him enough to be led. Not that he led blindly, and God knows Tony would never follow without question, but it was those qualities that pushed Steve to be better. They made each other better.
The guard tapped the screen again, which showed the date being only 2 days ago. Steve shook his head, “That can’t be right.” He looked down to Tony, who was still holding him up. “Tony, you know that can’t be right. Wanda has been here, we have all been here, we can’t leave, you know that.” He said desperately.
Okay, so I had such a good time with Science Squad, I couldn't help but have more fun with this chapter as well. I wanted a little bit more lighthearted feelings before I dump some more serious stuff on. Enjoy!
“You promised me ten missions, remember? You promised me I’d get to enjoy the view of you for ten missions. Please don’t break that promise, sweetheart.” He whispered as he pressed soft kisses to the inside of Tony’s bruised wrist while his fingers carded through Tony’s soft brown hair.
"I honestly didn't realize it at first. He used to make me so mad, it was like he knew exactly which buttons to push and he couldn't get enough of my reaction when he did. I've had people try and upset me before, but no one can do it with the ease that he did. It's like it was a game to him, 'Let's Annoy Steve', and he consistently broke his own record. He refused to listen, he refused to back down, and he was so reckless, it was infuriating."
Next he turned to Scott, "You ended up dying as well. The hostages had already been executed, you knew that."
Ross looked around at all of them as he coolly replied, “I’ve come for a criminal, Captain. And while there are many in this room to choose from, I’ve come for only one of you. This time.” His gaze settled on Wanda as he nodded to the guards at his left. They stepped forward towards Wanda who immediately retreated further with a wild look while a red glow emanated from her hands.
Now, Tony had told him that he had lived because he loved Steve ‘too damn much’ and then gave him soft looks until everyone was ushered out so Tony could sleep. Steve had only been back in the room with him while accompanied by others as well since, so they hadn’t had a chance to talk or for Steve to look for cues. And what the hell did that mean for Steve? Could he walk into the room expect Tony to welcome his presence at his bedside? Would Tony allow him to reach out and hold his hand gently like he had been doing for over a week? Kiss his bruised wrists or run his fingers through his gorgeous hair? What he wanted was to close the blinds, lock the door, and slide into the small bed to worship the handsome genius. He wanted to feel his heartbeat under his hands, touch him in any way he could think of so that he would make noise, proof that he was still alive, still with Steve. He needed to hear breathy moans and gasps, approval for his presence. He wanted to feel Tony’s hands all over him, pulling him closer as proof that he wanted Steve next to him, not that he only tolerated his presence.
Tony's smile grew as he replied easily, "Nat, you know that I do. Who else can I trust to watch over everyone, huh? We both know the second I turn my back Bruce will go power hungry and demand everyone wears matching green outfits."
"Tony, Ross already called me to impress upon me the importance of tonight. I know that you are hurting, I know you are angry, so be careful tonight."
Tony pushed himself to his feet, trying to pull Steve’s considerable weight with him. “Okay, hold on Tony, my arm doesn’t bend that way.” Steve said, attempting to get up with Tony pulling his arm the wrong direction.
"Is this some kind of penance?" Steve asked from his spot on Bucky's bed as Bucky was putting the few personal items he owned into his duffle bag. "Do you think you should offer yourself up to him because of what happened to his parents? Buck, you
Wanda was still being held by Vision when she cried, “We aren’t just going to let this happen, are we? We have to go get him!” Natasha’s voice was shaky as she answered, “If we do it without approval, we go against the Accords and we all become criminals.” Scott’s voice was beyond anger when he said, “Ross is the criminal!” He turned to T’Challa, “I thought you said that you and Tony had this handled, you said that Ross would go down with the information you had on him.”
As soon as the elevator doors began to open they all poured out and ran towards the lab doors. The lab was on blackout. James tried the door but it was locked.
Tony took another deep breath as he pressed his free palm to his chest. Finally, he opened his eyes, and raised his chin again, meeting Ross’ gaze and asking, “Are we done here? I need my beauty sleep.”
Tony wasn't sure he could trust himself to answer with an even voice, but he cleared his throat and tried, returning Scott's handshake and saying, "The pleasure is mine. She's a wonderful girl, and Maggie is one of the kindest women I've had the pleasure of meeting. I'm sure you're very proud."
His surprised sound was muffled as Steve pressed their lips together and closed his eyes, reveling in the feeling of his lips moving in sync against Tony’s. He used one hand to tilt Tony’s jaw to the side to slot their mouths together with more pressure while he used his other hand to carefully wrap around Tony and pull him closer. Tony’s own hands slid up his back and tangled in his hair as they kissed.
Tony looked affronted. "No, of course not. The kids did it after I fell asleep, the little demons." He searched his desk for one of the screwdriver heads he was missing.
In the end, it didn't matter what anyone said to him, Bucky had made up his mind. He wanted The Winter Soldier gone.
Tony’s eyebrows knitted together and his eyes looked distinctly sad as he considered James. “Of course I want him. Why the hell do you think this has been so excruciating for me? If I didn’t want him, I would have been able to either forget him or forgive him like I have everyone else. Do you think I’m being dramatic on purpose? Don’t answer that.” James smiled a little softer at his friend.
Tony again shook his head at his friend. “Alright Kat-hmandu, that will be quite enough of that. You know how I can’t stand the sentimental mush.”
The weather for the press conference the next morning is positively dull. The clouds have rolled over New York, covering the city in a dingy grey as the rain drizzled relentlessly. Steve had come back from his early morning run thoroughly drenched, the cold seeping into settle in his bones.
They sat in the lab for a while more going over details of the plan that T'Challa would propose to the UN Counsel after the reveal of
He has to release the video and then stand up and in the same breath, forgive the man. The orphan has to forgive the man who made him one.
When he opened the stairwell, he almost stepped on a blonde super soldier. “Oh, hey Stevie, there you are. Doin’ okay?”
"Why didn't you alert them to that fact? Why not go together? You left them unprotected as well and you paid the ultimate price for it."
Tony stepped up to Wanda and gently cradled her face in his hands. The tears slipped down her cheeks as Tony leaned forward and held her gaze. “Look me in the eyes, Wanda, and tell me you didn’t do this.” He whispered. A soft sob tore from her body as she placed her hands over Tony’s still cradling her face. “I didn’t do this, Tony, I swear on Pietro, I didn’t do this.” She whispered brokenly back. Tony held her watery gaze for a few more seconds before he pulled her into a brief tight hug. “I believe you.” He whispered and placed a kiss on her hair before letting her go and gently pushing her back into Vision’s arms.
It was Bucky who spoke up and took over the call, to Steve's surprise. "Hey Web-Kid, feeling up to a status report?"
“I don’t need James, Steve, I just need to take a breath.” Tony cut him off, placing a hand over Steve’s that still rested on his arm. They arrived in the Penthouse and Tony gave Steve’s hand a light pat before pushing himself upright and walking out of the elevator at a slow pace. Steve recovered from his surprise and hurried forward to place a hand on Tony’s shoulder as support. “If I didn’t know any better, I’d say that comment about James just now sounded a little bit like jealousy.” Tony said with a playful smirk as they made their way down the long hallway. Steve ducked his head a little bit in embarrassment. In front of them were a few stairs to a landing in front of very large white double doors. Steve had never seen or been inside Tony’s room in the Penthouse.
Her large black eyes turn on him and again take him in. The feeling is unsettling at the very least, it’s like she knows something and is trying to find it on or in him. He doesn’t fidget, but he wants to.
"And to hell with anyone caught in the crossfire." Natasha's voice made the rest of them jump. She and Bucky were in the doorway of the stairwell, back from wherever they had taken Tony.
Distantly, she heard Tony’s voice starting to cut through the cloudiness in her mind. His hand on her back rubbing soothing circles.
Steve lifted his gaze and met Tony's brown eyes. He wished more than anything to walk away from this right now, but he knew it was too late. The fire had been lit in Tony's eyes and it was raging at a full blaze. Steve could only steel himself, raise his chin and let it come.
It only took a few minutes to cut the webbing down, but unfortunately Science Squad had been so preoccupied with making the webbing strong enough to hold Vision, they hadn’t really come up with a good way to get the webbing
Natasha’s voice was low in Steve’s ear as she began to speak, “Have you ever been in a room and seen Tony Stark and Pepper Potts walk in side by side? The entire room goes quiet. Even those who don’t like them or who envy them fall completely silent, like a strange reverence.”
“How pathetic you are, ‘Merica.” Shuri said, but her words were soft and her eyes kind as she looked at him.
"I enjoy sharks." Thor said, "They are incredibly interesting. Tony and I watched programs about them a few days ago. Very informative. A whole week of television dedicated to them, can you imagine?"
Around the room there were a few sniffles and bowed heads as they all listened to the proof of Tony’s issues with his father.
It took everything he had to tear his eyes away and raise his gaze to look into Tony’s eyes. When he did, he found those dark pools swirling dangerously, knowing exactly what Steve had been staring at. The muscle in Tony’s jaw jumped as he clenched his jaw hard. With a last look at Clint, Tony retreated from the room, following Natasha’s steps until he reached the elevator.
Tony raised a dark eyebrow at him. “I seem to remember the Accords specifically stating that you were allowed to leave if you are accompanied by your guardian.” He gestured towards himself. “So, suit up Falcon. I’ll even strap you into your car seat.” He said with a wink before turning and continuing to the elevators.
She gave him an understanding nod and a small smile which he returned. “Come on, lets get out of here before they think we killed each other.” They stood up together and shared a last hug as Tony held open the door for her and said, “Oh hey, that reminds me. When we get upstairs check the counter. Vis mentioned that your headphones broke. We picked up some new ones for you, but I’ll be honest, I don’t know how good they’re going to be.”
. Come into my house and accuse me of wanting to do anything that might bring that shit back into my life. I will never."
He had told her about Ultron and the disaster that had caused and he had told her about the disagreement between the other Avengers that had resulted in them being split when the attack for the Time Stone began.
They wander the terrain together, his arm slung around her shoulders and her arm winding around his waist to help support him. His breath his heavy and short, he is sweating heavily, and his face contorting into a wince with each step. Finally, they come to The Milano, still in working order despite the fight. Nebula helps to guide him up the ramp and into the empty ship, where she lowers him on to a table. Only now does he notice the way she is carefully avoiding using her left hand. It’s part robotic and part soft flesh. He wonders if he could fix it for her. Yes, he probably could, if he lives that long.
The decision to open it or not was made for him when the door is opened from the inside and he comes face to face with Pepper Potts. She stops short when she sees him and for a moment they just stare at each other. She recovers faster than he does and gives him a smile that scares him a little bit. “Hello Steve. I see you aren’t still glued to the chair.” She says sweetly. He glances to the side, unsure how to respond to that. He is shocked when she is suddenly hugging him, her arms around his shoulders. It is only when she whispers in his ear he realizes what is happening. “Treat him right. You take take one single step out of line and I will make your life hell.” She steps back and says loudly and brightly, “Good to see you Steve, take care!” And brushes past him, saying goodbye to the others gathered in the waiting room.
Tony inquired into a few names specifically, and by the reaction of his FRIDAY, she knew that their fate didn’t look positive. Tony tried to contain his emotions as he hooked various cords and attachments to her body, explaining to her that he was scanning for any possible components that he should be aware of before attempting to fix her damaged parts.
Her eyes caught on a man who was watching Tony's every movement, the same man she had watched hand Tony a drink. He walked to a side stairwell and slid out the door. A few minutes later, she watched Tony head in the direction of that same door. Quickly, she intercepted his movements, stepping into his path before he made it to the door.
“Tomorrow?” She asked hopefully. Steve was about to answer when the elevator door opened again and Tony, Sam, and James came walking onto the floor. They each had way too many grocery bags loaded up on their arms as they stumbled into the kitchen and deposited them on the counters.
Tony felt a hand on his shoulder and breathing hard he glanced over to see T'Challa standing between he and Ross. When had Tony rounded the counter and gotten into his face like this? He didn't remember moving.
Tony’s gaze shifted down to their joined hands for a split second as well. Steve bit his lip and tried not to have a heart attack when Tony’s dark eyes tracked the movement. They stood together, the air between them felt charged. Tony opened his mouth to say something when Shuri stuck her head in the room, breaking them out of the moment.
After extending pleasantries inquiring into each others welfare, Tony finally came walking back down the hallway and immediately raised both hands in what he clearly hoped was a calming gesture as he came into the room.
Hearing Tony say he’d forgiven her, Wanda sobbed. Tony released James and Natasha and hesitated for a moment before reaching out a hand towards Wanda. Instead of taking it, she launched herself at him and wrapped her arms around his waist, burying her face into his shoulder. Tony stood surprised for a moment before he wrapped his arms around her shaking form and cradled her close, hushing her sobs in an attempt to sooth her.
They had all arrived in small groups until nearly everyone was there. Steve was in his outfit, but was missing his shield. He felt incredibly awkward without it but would didn't voice the fact to anyone other than Bucky –
“I told you that you made the damage worse.” She bit out as she glanced at him and pretended to be more interested in the controls of the ship.
"We had disagreements, that doesn't mean we don't care about the people we left behind." He had explained to them. Sam raised an eyebrow at Steve, unimpressed with his flimsy excuse. Sam knew that Steve was always monitoring for news on Tony, and now that there was a party being held by the man himself, complete with cameras and live footage, there was no way Cap was going to miss it.
Tony's eyes softened at the sight of the children. "Hey Cassie-Bug. 'm okay, honey. Maggie, Laura, it's alright."
"And yet you love him. He's a good kid, Tones. I spoke to May when she came over for lunch a few days ago, she says that he's never been happier. He was under a shadow for a long time, with the passing of his parents and his uncle, but since meeting you, since becoming part of this team, he's a happy kid again."
It was just after Tony’s warm up simulation had finished that FRIDAY alerted them to an emergency situation in Chicago. The terrorist cell that Tony and Peter had tried to check on the day the others had arrived in the compound had been exposed and the Avengers were needed on the scene.
Sam gave a stiff nod before exhaling a long breath and slumping his shoulders, losing the tension they had held. "You saw and heard him, then?" T'Challa nodded affirmatively.
At that, James, Bruce, Vision, and Natasha shared a worried glance and sprang up towards the elevator. Steve stood too, noticing that Scott, Wanda, Sam and Clint were right there as well. No one stopped them as they all gathered in the elevator, obviously they were all too focused on getting to Tony to consider that the other’s shouldn’t be with them. It made Steve even more worried that FRIDAY didn’t try to enforce their restricted floor rules either. Something must have been drastically wrong.
Drinking and partying, reckless behavior and avoidance that ultimately led to pain and crushing guilt. She saw unfamiliar faces of young Terrans before they were suddenly killed, followed by confusion before seeing a bomb that read
It seemed like an eternity, but in reality it had only been three weeks. Three weeks of absolute hell. The clean-up continued. Families trying to locate each other, orphans brought to the palace temporarily until plans could be made. M’Baku partnering with Ramonda and the other tribes to provide the bare essentials to all of Wakanda’s people.
He smiled to himself before launching into an abridged explanation of his thoughts and feelings from the last few months; the changes he needed to make, the person he wanted to be, and everything about Tony. He was done keeping secrets, besides, it’s not like she didn’t know. Everyone who knew him knew that he loved Tony, hell even Tony knew. He needed help, and if the AI might help him, the chance lay with him being honest and telling her the truth so she could help him get the best information.
Nat and Tony fall asleep snuggling on the couch after watching a movie in the middle of the night. Steve and Clint found them stretched out on the couch, Nat laying spread across Tony, her leg hiked up across his stomach, his arm holding her to his chest, his hand dangerously close to her ass. She was wearing a tank top and short shorts; Tony was wearing only sweats.
“Thanks, Tony.” Clint said from his perch on the counter. Tony shot him is best look of innocence as he said, “I just want to rub your nose in it.”
“Whoa, whoa, Stark, it’s just me!” He yelled throwing up his hands in surrender, the bouncy ball clutched in his left hand.
The computer showed the connection ended and T'Challa turned around to face Steve who had sunk down into a chair.
T’Challa stood behind them, rolling his eyes at Tony but smiling proudly at someone recognizing his sister’s brilliance so publicly. Tony turned around and with a flippant wave of his wrist in his direction said, “And that’s the King, he’s got a cool Cat-Suit, but that’s about it.” Steve thought for a moment that Tony was being incredibly rude, but he watched T’Challa break out into a smile and heard his low chuckle at Tony’s words. Tony gave T’Challa a huge wink and smirk at that.
Emerging from the cabinet he turned towards Tony and James. From the look on his face as his eyes landed on Tony, he was obviously expecting literally anyone else.
would he kill his favorite daughter? Because she mattered to so many others? Because she had finally found some kind of happiness? It wasn’t fair. Nebula was no stranger to pain or to the idea that life wasn’t fair, but this, this was wrong and this was different because this wasn’t her, it was someone else. Someone she loved. The only someone she had ever loved. Her sister. Pain she had felt, but only her own pain. Now, this loss, this anguish, and this helplessness to change it, that was new.
Everyone lets out a gasp, curse, or whistle as Steve disappeared in front of them. “Oh my god.” Peter whispers, “Can I have one of those?” Tony, coming back to his senses immediately cuts of that thought with an “Absolutely not, Parker! Hurry up guys, come on.” As he reached over to press the button on the bracelet and Steve is visible again.
"Turn this shit off, NOW!" Sam yelled, trying to get around Steve. Steve's arm slammed down in front of him, barring his path. It was too late, and they all watched in shock as the video continued to play out.
One by one, those who were still in the Compound make their way into the kitchen, the smell of bacon, pancakes, and eggs filling the space.
"I didn't realize we were babysitting, Tony, I thought this was a team." Rhodes said, clearly unhappy that they were being called out.
"You can choose not to sign, of course. If you make that choice, I will do my best to help relocate you somewhere safe where you must keep a low profile. I can no longer afford to risk my country's political standing. For that I am sorry. As I said, I will do my best to find the next safest place for you. Is there anyone who does not wish to sign? You are of course permitted to take some time to read over the new Accords before making a decision."
"There are a few little things I just need to measure on you and the rest of it is purely aesthetic choices that you need to make. You know, color, muscle definition, stickers, gnarly battle scars, and the like." Tony's eyes finally found his as he ended his little speech with a forced upward quirk of his lips.
"I would like to show you what I have been working on, Captain. As you know, the remaining Avengers have been operating within the Accords and in doing so I have noticed many things that need updates and amendments. I wonder if you would give me your opinion on a few of them?"
Trying to swallow his apprehension he met Tony’s guardedly curious gaze. He nodded slightly stiffly and cleared his throat. “O-Oh, yes. We are.”
“Ross. It must be Ross.” Scott said, rising from his seat. Sam answered, “The Counsel was reviewing the evidence, I thought T’Challa said they would find him guilty.”
Tony moved slowly, but eventually lifted his good hand and took Scott's outstretched palm. Scott have him a firm handshake and looked him in the eyes as he said, "Thank you, Mr. Stark. I appreciate everything you've done for my family."
“You’ve never actually seen Stark in action, have you?” Natasha smirked over the rim of her coffee cup.
T'Challa eyed Tony strangely, his eyes darting down towards his collar and back up to his face. Tony realized he had seen the hickey that had started to form under his suit.
Her eyes filled with more tears as she tried to breathe through the onslaught of memories and emotions. This was Tony’s life. A mixture of the good memories of family and love, together with the loss of said family and the pain in their absence.
Carefully he reached out and put a gentle hand on Tony's shoulder. Tony nearly jumped out of his skin at the contact, his hands flying up to grip James' wrist. "Hey, hey, hey, its alright, it's just me, its just James."
Tony scoffed. “I seem to recall you forming a little team of your own – without Iron Man – and it went just fine for you, didn’t it?” Steve hated this. “No. I lost someone very important to me.”
Upon finishing he had stood up so quickly he saw black spots color his vision and after exiting the council room made a b-line for the nearest restroom. On the outside he portrayed the calm cool Tony Stark that the media and public knew so well. On the inside, he was nearly breaking.
"Nat, do you really think I would do something like this? That's why you are all so mad right, because it doesn't seem like me?"
He ran a hand over his face and set his elbows on his knees as he sat forward and thought about what Tony had said. Was Tony right, did he really only lead a team, never being a part of it? Did he even know the difference? He thought he had been a part of the Howling Commandos, but thinking about it now, maybe Tony had a point. He led the team and god help him, he mothered the team, but did he ever just sit back and take part in being with the team. Even when he was around the closest members of his team he didn’t let his guard down very often, he didn’t know how. He was always ready for someone to need him, because that is what he was good for, that is something he knew how to do. He knew how to be a tool in fixing something. When the others saw him, they mostly saw “Cap”. Even the ones who thought they saw Steve didn’t actually see him because he didn’t know who Steve was anymore. Steve had been Bucky’s best friend, Steve had gotten into fistfights in Brooklyn, Steve had loved Peggy, and Steve had gone into the Ocean.
Tony leaned forward and whispered something in the reporter's ear that had her blushing and giggling before he turned and winked at the camera and started back up the stairs towards his party.
Bruce sighed as Tony poked and prodded the bear. They missed Ross’ reply as T’Challa thanked the person on the other end of the line and stood abruptly, “I have been given approval for a small team to go after them. We are to secure Tony’s safety and take Ross into custody with as little damage as possible.” He pointed at each person as he listed the roster. “Black Panther, Vision, War Machine, Black Widow, The Soldier, Spider-Man.”
Once the room was cleared of all of the business men and woman, Natasha flicked on the light that was overhead, drawing attention to the small corner they were all packed into together out of the spotlight. Tony and Pepper's heads snapped up and over to them at the same time. Pepper’s eyebrows shot up in surprise before her eyes narrowed at them all and she huffed in out annoyed breath.
Tony. Steve's heart felt like it broke and mended itself ten times at just the sight of the man. He looked awful. He looked beautiful. Awful and beautiful, Steve's brain couldn't decide which one to land on. Tony looked absolutely exhausted, dark circles around his eyes, although now that he thought about it, they myriad of bruises covering Tony's face blended into the dark circles.
“What reasons can you give the public for trusting Captain America?” Another called out. That one had him turn and answer, “Excuse me?”
As Tony’s car pulled up to the curb, the crowd closed in a bit and Happy could be seen exiting the drivers seat and walking around to the passenger’s back door. His face was a mask as the reporter’s flash pictures and call for Tony. Steve was suddenly hit with just how much Happy has been through with Tony. The man has literally stood at Tony’s side, silently guarding him and caring for him for years. Steve feels his heart warm in appreciation for the man. He wonders how often anyone comments on Happy’s steadfast loyalty. He knew that Happy had been injured a while back with preforming his duties. It had been on the news and he knew that it had upset Tony greatly. Why did he know that? Who had told him that? Or maybe he just knew that it would have been upsetting for Tony? How much of his information did he actually hear and how much did he just know? That thought was slightly unsettling for him, so he moved on and tried to focus on the television.
Swaying on his feet for a moment, Stark let out a burdened huff before turning towards where she was still laying on the ground.
He remembered days trying to catch up on pop culture references just so that when someone made a joke, he could participate just to see Tony's eyes widen in shock before that gorgeous smile would take over. Alternatively, sometimes he would avoid learning more about a subject because he loved seeing the fond eye roll and bright smile Tony would have in response to his confusion.
Seeing Tony’s bright smile, his face flushed, and his tank riding up his hips while his sweats rode low, Steve hurriedly excused himself from the room to go refill his water bottle before things got embarrassing for him. With a last glance backwards Steve saw James looking at him with a knowing smirk.
Steve’s heart melted, knowing that Tony had tried to keep the image of the children’s fathers positive, even after they had left them for Captain America’s agenda.
“Fuck you.” Tony spat blood on Ross’ face, earning him another punch to the gut. Silence reigned for a while, broken only by Tony's harsh breathing.
Sam nodded solemnly and hung his head slightly. His next question came as a surprise, "Have you seen Colonel Rhodes, since…?"
At that moment, in true Stark fashion, the elevator door opened and the man himself came walking out, a sleek tablet in his hand and Peter Parker bounding along at his side, wheeling in a large cart with locked metal bins stacked up on it.
Sam tried to bite his tongue, he really did, but he couldn’t just let that slide. “She seemed to take her new gloves without much of a thought.”
"The first time Stark saw that video of his parent's murder was in a frozen bunker in the middle of Siberia, standing next to you and Barnes." Sam's voice was quiet, but he might as well have been screaming, the silence was so immense. "You knew about his family and you didn't tell him." It wasn't a question.
Confused, he looked at the box in her palm and then up at her. She was already looking at him, watching him watch the box with a smile playing on the corners of her mouth. “It looks like my fingerprint doesn’t unlock it, who might have guessed?” She teased. He scoffed at her, “I think the creator of the box might have.”
Time nearly stopped as he watched himself raise the shield over his head and he saw Tony raise his hands. There was no doubt in Tony’s eyes, he saw death coming for him and he saw it from Steve’s hands.
Tony turned his gaze back to Steve. “Sam? Wanda?” Steve shook his head sadly. Tony swallowed hard and quietly inquired in a voice barely more than a whisper, “…Barnes?” Steve’s eyes filled again with tears as he again shook his head. Tony sighed and pulled Steve into another embrace. In his ear, he whispered, “I’m so sorry, Steve. I am so sorry.”
Tony’s eyes flashed, pain written across them before he closed them tight and bowed his head, stepping back he braced himself with his free hand on the counter. “You know why, Rogers.” He muttered, turning away as much as he could. Steve wouldn’t let him get very far though, using their connected hands to pull himself closer into Tony’s space, until they were nearly chest to chest.
"You wanna explain yourself, Stark?" Clint seethed. Tony was about to tell him where he could stick his anger, but Natasha's irate voice spoke up instead. "After you all broke out of jail, Ross and some other people started looking to your family. Tony and I got them out. Cassie and Maggie too. They've been here at the Compound for months now."
“You didn’t what? You didn’t know that messing around in my head would be bad for me?” Tony demanded.
She was so… disappointed. Once she made it to the curb and her car was brought around it took all of her willpower not to floor the gas pedal and speed her way back to the Compound.
She approached him where he laid on the floor and offered him her hand. As she pulled him to his feet he dusted himself off before returning the hug she enveloped him in.
“Are you seriously offering to have ‘the talk’ with me?” Steve asked, slightly horrified. “You are lucky you have me, anyone else would send you in unprepared. I’m trying to help!” James cried. Steve groaned and scrubbed a hand over his face. “Look, I appreciate it, mother, but I think I’ve got it covered, okay?”
Laura Barton and Maggie Lang were trying to contain Cooper, Lila, Cassie from running full speed at Tony.
Shuri had thrown her arms around his neck with a laugh and told him, "I will miss your lovesick pouting face, 'Merica. Give your man a sloppy kiss for me, yes?" At the mortified look on Steve's face she only laughed harder, taking his hand he felt her push something into his palm.
“Nat, look at me, it’s okay, don’t worry about it.” Her glare softened as she looked up into Tony’s eyes. “He said-”
They were so engrossed with their work that they didn’t notice Peter and Shuri sitting on a beanbag and watching them with wide grins. “They have improved very much.” Shuri whispered. Peter hummed in agreement and laced his hands behind his head as he reclined and watched.
Tony leaned over to James and whispered, “My favorite feeling, personally.” James snickered in return while Steve felt the familiar flush crawl up his neck. He needed to focus, this was training and he couldn’t have thoughts of an excited and loose Tony distract him, as much as he really wanted to.
"Happy," he called to his friend and driver, "Any chance you've been monitoring the news like I asked?"
Sweat poured down his body, as he stood in the middle of the floor, his chest heaving. He stumbled a bit before sinking to the mat in exhaustion. His angry panting slowly began to calm down slightly, turning instead into small gasps as tears began to cloud his eyes.
He doesn’t seem to take any offence or be put off by her actions, his gaze instead zeroing in on her non-functional left arm as his soft voice replies, “And if I had, you might be dead or-”
So the Rogue Avengers were pardoned, and T'Challa was flying home with five copies of the newly approved accords, the final product of all of the work he and Tony and put in over the months. Tony had joked that it was their baby, and he could not have been more proud to have fathered it with him. T'Challa could do nothing more than laugh as Laura had thrown one of Nathaniel's stuffed animals at Tony's face.
At his confused look she continued, “With the rest of us, you have found a place where your heart and your head can come together and find peace. That is why you can forgive, though maybe not trust, the rest of us. You have not been able to do the same with Steve.”
“Good, send them a message, keep them away from the Compound until we know what Ross wants. Once it’s safe to do so, alert Tony and the others about the situation here, don’t let it distract them from their mission.”
There are constant calls and requests for a comment from what seems like nearly every news station in the world. Reporters and paparazzi have taken to camping out outside of the Compound gates, hoping to catch a glimpse of anything that they can twist and sell to the public.
Just then, Cooper, Lila, and Cassie all came back in. The girls were each holding plates full of assorted cupcakes in their small hands and Cooper was proudly clutching his archery trophy.
Bucky just continued to stare at him. He could wait out Tony's attitude, it's not like he was going anywhere. He told him as much and Tony couldn't help but chuckle.
Turning around to face Ross again Tony put his hands out to the sides as a barrier between the soldiers and Wanda. He looked past the guards at Ross and stood tall, squaring his shoulders and lifting his chin, eyes flashing. “Not only did I read the Accords, I
The transmission cut out and silence reigned in the QuinJet. Steve couldn't take the silence anymore.
Steve had expected a large bedroom, but the actual room was gigantic. In the corner was another open door that led to a huge bathroom. Along the length of the room was a massive window overlooking the dark grounds with a mini bar tucked away on the side. The room didn’t look particularly lived in, but it did have a nice feel and a modern look to it.
Reporters were calling for Tony’s attention from all sides as the cameras flashed from every direction. Tony held his ground for a moment and let the cameras go, flashing his bright smile and holding up the peace sign before he turned and shook Happy’s hand before walking up to ascend the steps to the covered podium, which had a ridiculous amount of microphones on it. They don’t seem to phase Tony in the slightest though as he stands with his shoulders squared to face the reporters, cameras, and people in front of him. Behind his shoulders are a few on the UN Security Counsel, T’Challa included.
