He thinks of Tony’s lips accidentally brushing his that day down in Tony’s workshop and Steve knows that
“Hey, speak for yourself.” Tony kicks his foot gently.  He chuckles, but then lets the smile fall from his face.  He’s quiet for a moment, thoughtful and considering. “But really…we did all right.  Look how it all turned out.”
He cannot remember a time when he felt this nervous about seeing someone.  As prone as he is to hyperbole, it isn’t an exaggeration.  His whole body is in tumult: anticipation and anxiety, desire and doubt, all these different emotions tugging him in multiple directions.
“I’m still me, Steve, I’m only…” Tony sighs, turning away and looking out over the water, “trying to put someone else first for a change.”
Now he finds himself off-kilter surrounded by oppressive skyscrapers, claustrophobic in the unceasing, unyielding crowds.  Sometimes he feels like the clouds above are going to implode, that the buildings will shatter and every person will cling to him, suffocate him or tear him to pieces in their own desperate attempts to survive.
Tony is moving like a whirlwind and Steve can’t really catch up.  He barely manages to get out a thank you before Tony’s breezing toward the bathroom.
“Okay. Well, have her reach then. I want to meet with him. Make it dinner somewhere.” Pepper seems surprised at the suggestion. “Uh, I thought I’d keep it casual. Already enough heaviness there with my father and everything, right? Let’s not make it worse.”
“Wait…what are you talking about?” Tony doesn’t even remember what Bruce had been saying.  Something about some girl, and he knows he should care, but he can’t focus.  He can’t
“Hi, I don’t believe we’ve met.  I’m Jane Foster, uh, Dr. Jane Foster, I’m with Thor…you’re Pepper Potts, right?  That’s amazing, so amazing to meet you.  And nice.  Nice as well.” Her anxious blathering jars Steve out of his shock and he forces the kindest smile he can manage.
Steve loses himself in it entirely. He doesn't know how long they stay like that, wrapped around each other, but when he finally draws back to gasp for air, Bucky looks positively wrecked. His hair is a mess and his skin is flushed and sweaty; his gray-blue eyes are blown wide and his mouth looks used.
“They’re your friends too.”  Steve reads his friend’s face, hoping that Bucky really gets that and seeing that he doesn't.  “You’re one of us.”
“Any news?”  She asks, breathless, as she holds out black sweats and a pair of running sneakers to Steve.  She double takes at Steve typing out code fast and furiously.
. Below is a candid photograph of Tony leaving the party with Wanda Maximoff cozy on his arm. Her personal assistant, Pietro, lurks two paces behind them in the fuzzy background. He’s not much more than a shock of hair so blond it’s white, but Tony knows he’s scowling. Tony is grinning dopily, two sheets to the wind and winking at the camera. Wanda has her face carefully angled to show her better side, eyes downcast in perfect picture of chaste embarrassment at being caught with a lover. His wink to the camera must have helped sell that one.
Steve's body is still wet and open when he sinks down on Tony’s length, resting his weight on Tony completely in order to feel him reaching deep inside.
“Everything good?” She asks, cool and undemanding.  He stops beside her, watching as Tony sets the pumpkin down and sets about lighting it up.  Tony gives him a double thumbs up as Iron Man begins to glow.  The carving isn’t perfect, but it seems right all the same.
“Are you hungry? I don’t have any staff here tonight, but I’m sure I could manage to whip something up. I’m not as terrible in the kitchen as you might suspect.”
“It’s…it’s the hotel soap. I took a shower, I…I stank of booze and cigarettes.” Steve replies haltingly, caught off guard by the question. “And nothing
“Eh, just recently? After Howard bought the farm, I guess.  Instead of producing real bombs, the kid’s just going to make box office bombs,” Bucky quips, and Steve rolls his eyes at the lazy pun.  Bucky takes the cigarette out of his mouth and sits up, evidently having more to offer on the subject than a lame joke.  “You
“It does tonight.” Tony retorts, the statement charged with something darker and more promising than any business offer. A look flashes across his face, so quickly that Steve wonders if he’s imagined it. If it had been real, it had also been unmistakably sexual.
Tony pointedly turns away from Steve, circling around to the table where the Mark VIII is scattered in snarled pieces.  There’s nothing to be done for it but he pretends there is anyway, figuring Steve can’t tell the difference.
“JARVIS, switch to thermal imaging.”  Tony can read Steve’s heat signature and attempts to follow him, but a large blast echoes down the other hallway, powerful enough that he feels the vibration through his suit.  Steve’s out of his radius before Tony turns his attention back, and he considers trying to catch up but knows it’s useless.  Steve’s going to do what Steve wants to do, and that’s supposedly his prerogative as leader.
He hopes someone remembered to cover his rent for him while he was gone; he hadn’t exactly planned on being abducted and held hostage as a science experiment.  He suspects that if he followed the paper trail long enough, he’d find that the building is owned by SHIELD and his landlord is really Fury, so he decides he probably doesn’t need to worry about returning to find an eviction notice nailed to the door and his few belongings donated to the Salvation Army.
But it’s only a matter of time before he loses his battle against the impulse.  Steve is going to smile a certain way or say some impossibly perfect thing and Tony’s going to break Pepper’s heart.
He purposely acts nonchalant about it, treating it like an outlandish joke, even as doubt niggles the back of his mind. Maybe he
When his vision clears, he looks down the length of his body. Some spatter from Tony’s orgasm decorates his abdomen, drips down his cock and catches in his pubic hair. But most of it, he realizes with a shiver of arousal, Tony had aimed at his hole. It’s as if he was re-claiming, re-marking what he could, even if he couldn’t finish inside. Steve lets out a helpless moan at the realization, desire spiking through him again.
Steve’s been pushing himself hard enough that his flannel shirt came off long ago and his white undershirt now clings to his skin, damp with sweat. He picks up his over shirt from where it’s hanging on a rack of C-stands and contemplates throwing it back on before going outside. No one expects workmen to be dressed prim and proper, but he
“Apology accepted.  I woke up a while ago when Tony left anyway.  Now go get into some dry clothes and get some sleep, the movie can wait for another time.” She sighs to herself, running a hand through her strawberry blond hair.  “I sound like my mother.”
But hopefully Steve will have gotten the message by then, and he'll let this once-wonderful thing between them die its painful, quiet death. Steve is stubborn, and Tony's only real hope is that Steve's anger and hurt will outweigh his determination.
Tony mixes his drink with shaking hands, spilling vermouth on the bar and dropping a few cherries to the floor before one makes it into his glass. This isn’t how he imagined Steve’s first visit to his house would go.
“Steve…” Tony feels like he’s not getting through. “I know I acted like I didn’t care, but I didn’t want you to leave this morning. I wanted to sit down at that tiny table and eat an obnoxiously large breakfast with you, and then go back to bed until one of us absolutely couldn’t stay any longer. I wanted to make plans to see you again before letting you out of my sight. That’s what I wanted.”
“Probably. Sucking up to the director seems to be part and parcel of this whole producing process.” Tony leans in, rising on the tips of his toes to whisper somewhere near Steve’s ear. “I’d much rather suck something else.”
Fury takes a deep breath and closes the folder in front of him, his fingers resting tentatively on its cover.
Three shared bottles of the bar’s most expensive scotch later, he’d ordered a car and gratefully returned to the Williamsburg loft he and Steve have shared for the past year and a half.
“Oh, that’s right.  I made popcorn.  Which is brilliant, cause I’m starving.”  He snaps his fingers and heads for the kitchen.  “Steven, get changed and get back down here, we have a movie to watch.”
The scowls that Tony, Sam and Clint all throw Thor’s way would be amusing if Steve didn’t know they are on his behalf.  They can’t keep trying to protect him from this.
“And I’m talking about Steve Rogers, out there, somewhere, completely at the mercy of a band of lunatics who want to break him apart just to see how he works.”
“I was assuming I had a very short window before you either realized this was a horrible mistake and/or started freaking out, so I very immaturely brought you somewhere you could not escape.”  He gestures around them.  The Ferris Wheel car rocks a little in the wind as they reach the apex.  From one hundred fifty feet in the air, everything on the ground seems small.  The ocean stretches out into the darkness like it’s infinite.  They’re a world away from everyone and everything.
Things were said in the heat of the moment, but it’s best to dispel them now before anyone gets confused. There’s definitely a spark between him and Bucky, but without Steve, it never would have caught fire. Even now there’s little more than fading embers, and no guarantee anything will reignite. Steve is what fuses them together; without Steve, there’d be next to nothing.
But when Tony had returned from his own tantrum and discovered that no one seemed to know where Steve was, he’d gone looking.  He’s never thought of himself as particularly great at reading people – Obadiah had been plotting to kill him for years, after all, and he’d been none the wiser – but he’d at least thought he’d had a vague idea of what Steve would do in a situation like this.
“I…I may have tried to pressure him into taking a job on my film, which he clearly did not want to take,” Tony winces, remembering the increasingly disheartened look on Steve’s face when he’d kept on about it. They’d barely finished making love before Tony had to stupidly open his big mouth and press the issue.
He digs out his leather wallet and puts down a couple of bills for his drink. Nick swipes the money up and hands it back to him. Steve starts to protest but Nick shoots him down with flat stare.
“That was about to get good, I resent that.” Tony, petulant, points at the wall.  Natasha’s face is carefully schooled into blankness; if she hadn’t taken out her feelings on the button, he might not have thought she was invested in the outcome of today’s proceedings at all.
“Or I can set you up a cot down here if you like.”  Tony replies.  Steve’s face must show his confusion at the offer because Tony clarifies.  “Since the gym seems to be the only place you ever visit.”
“I think I need to tell you…” He looks up at Tony demurely through his lashes. “Your Brooklyn jokes weren’t funny the first time we met either.”
Steve’s heady gaze shifts toward him, hearing his curse, and even though he looks too far gone to stop, there’s still apparent shock evident in Steve’s eyes at seeing Tony there in his bedroom.
Pepper looks at Steve with a frown and Steve does his best to look contrite.  She hands him a towel.
Steve tilts his head toward him and presses a gentle kiss to his lips. The angle is a bit awkward so Tony fixes it, rolling on top of him. They kiss contentedly for far too long, Tony letting himself get lost in it for what seems like minutes, but is more likely the better part of a half hour.
“I know, it’s wretched, we can go.”  Tony assures him with a knowing smile.  Steve tries to hide his confusion and disappointment as quickly as he can, but Tony must catch it.  “Oh, shit, you like it?  Rogers, this was supposed to be a joke.  Like a go to Vegas, see Wayne Newton and the Elvis impersonators and the guys with the tigers kind of a kitschy thing to do.”
He pauses, the flash of bare flesh, the curve of Steve’s ass enough to make his pulse start pounding like the first time he ever opened up a Playboy.  It feels just as thrilling and just as wrong.  The way he slams the door shut with too much force only draws attention to the fact that he’d stopped to look.
She studies him awhile longer, still unsure whether or not she believes him, but she eventually sighs and holds out the phone again.
“This one’s pretty self-explanatory.”  He runs a hand over the intricately carved backs of each of the ten chairs lining this side of the long, mahogany table as he crosses the length of the room toward the library.  “And here in the library-cum-lounge, we should also find someone you folks already know.”
“Sir, it’s fine,” Steve assures him, just glad that they’re not being recognized as the ones who took part in the destruction.
“Out with it, Stevie.  Don’t tell me, milk man? Paper delivery boy?  No…please tell me that you worked at the corner soda shoppe and wore one of those funny white paper hats and a red bowtie?  I bet the girls just loved you.”
“Yeah…that’s classified,” Clint pipes up, digging into his own heaping portion of food, unbothered by the tense face-off between his best friend and Tony.  Steve realizes no one else is that concerned either, helping themselves to dinner and setting about the room picnic style, grabbing seats on the floor around the coffee table.  “She could tell you but then she’d have to kill you.”
He and Tony strolled the immaculate gardens of the public grounds surrounding the nearby tennis complex as they waited for the crowd to dissipate, and had wound up sitting together in the shadows of Arthur Ashe Stadium for much longer than planned.
Nevertheless, here he is, nerves ragged as that car climbs slowly up the hill. Only a few more minutes until he's face-to-face with Steve for the first time since that horrible encounter at Jan's.
He doesn’t know whose sick, twisted thought it is to kill Tony when he’s underneath Steve in their bed. How he wants to kill Tony just as he comes, to see his eyes go from hazy with lust to glassy and dull, to see the life drain out of him just at the moment he thought he had it all.
lose track of time whilst in the throes of absolute genius and revolutionary invention,” Tony circles the island and takes up a spot directly opposite Steve.  He hops up to sit on the counter.  “My insane working hours have a point.”
“I’ll look into it.” Tony lifts his glass to her in a toast, and then downs more of his coffee. He’ll need it to get through this day. “But for right now, could you look into some aspirin, because my head is –”
“If Bucky had come to you before the war and told you he loved you, that he wanted to be with you—what would you have done?”
He certainly has it easier – he doesn’t have to walk in heels, after all – but even so the panic is setting in.
Rhodey thuds his head against the metal a couple of times before rolling to look back at Tony. “I should really
“Shall we find our seats, Miss Maximoff?” He tries to sound smooth and flirtatious, but the words choke in his throat. Wanda doesn’t comment upon it. Instead she takes his hand and leads him into the auditorium.
“It’s…it’s all so blurry, coming here.  I only knew that I couldn’t see Steve.  I could feel it…in my bones, you know, that I had to…I had to keep myself away from him.  Any time I tried to dig deeper there was nothing – just darkness – a blank.  I didn’t know why.  I didn’t know this is what was going to happen.”  Barnes stares back at him, direct but unchallenging.  Tony nods.
He twitches his face purposefully once to try and get rid of whatever’s happening and then responds.
. His breath catches in his throat; the sight and sound of Steve Rogers lost to sexual abandon hypnotizes him completely.  Never in a million years did he ever think he’d see this anywhere outside his own lustful fantasies.  It’s more amazing than he could have dreamed.
“Ah ah ah, I’m a drunk, but I’m not a mean old one. I actually think I’m quite fun. Not to mention young and devastatingly handsome.”
- makes him inordinately proud.  A rudimentary understanding of popular culture probably shouldn’t please him so much, but it does.
“You can call him Happy, Pepper, I know you two are dating.” He kicks back, propping his feet up on his desk as he shoots Pepper a knowing wink.  “Courting. Going steady. Whatever you kids call it these days.”
“No, no…think I’ll stay here a minute.” Tony suddenly sounds tired, and he takes a seat on the sofa. He tugs his shirtsleeves straight underneath his suit coat as he leans back into the cushions. “Make a few more of those calls before heading out.”
“I’m going to go to London in the morning.  We both need some space.”  It sounds final.  It doesn’t sound like ‘space’, it doesn’t sound like ‘time apart’; it sounds like a break up.  “I’ll stay at the Waldorf tonight.”
He then supposes that Bucky is going to jerk off over Steve’s face or that he’s shoving his cock past Steve’s lips, but Bucky moves up too far for that.  Steve’s hands grab Bucky’s hips and hold him steady and that’s when Tony realizes they’re following through on their earlier plans for Steve to lick Bucky out.
Rhodey at least has the decency to look sheepish, but he doesn't exactly apologize. Tony waves him off before he tries to obfuscate.
Even with his eyes closed, Steve’s vaguely aware of a few telltale flashes of bright white light that mean photos are being snapped, but if Tony doesn’t care, he doesn’t either.
“Things between us have been so shitty, Buck, since I changed back to this.” He makes a sweeping gesture down the length of his body. “I didn’t understand at all but then Tony said that and…” He looks at Bucky, meeting his gaze. “It all made sense. At least, it does if it’s true.”
Steve can’t really believe the words coming out of Tony’s mouth right now.  He should’ve known better than to open himself up to this.  To
“This one’s going out to the lovely redhead standing in that pile of goo in the middle of Herald Square:
“I’ve got Hill over here!”  He shouts, bending down and lifting the chunks of shattered concrete quickly.  Her face is stained dark with blood from a head wound and she’s wheezing, but she’s alive.
He tosses the two items onto the bed beside Steve and turns the note over a few times between two fingers, holding it up in question.
Steve does, adjusting his blazer to hopefully mask the indecent bulge at the front of his pants. Thankfully, he’s not entirely erect, but even when he’d been small and delicate, that part of his anatomy had been disproportionately large. It unfortunately doesn’t take much for it to become an obscene embarrassment.
Steve reaches out and turns off the water. He doesn’t break with Tony’s gaze as he steps out of the tub. The tile slicks under his feet, water dripping from his hair, down his arms and legs. He steps forward carefully, slowly, until Tony’s only inches away.
“Since Vegas.  Aspen.  Not really sure.” Steve gently touches the arc reactor with the tips of his fingers, and Tony’s astounded by how the light plays across Steve’s handsome features and that Steve’s attraction to him isn’t some newfound revelation.
Looking in the mirror, it should feel irrefutable. He’s the spitting image of this “Bucky” Barnes, so much so that Steve Rogers believes it to be true. It’s not until he finds tattered medical records from his eighth year, haphazardly stored in the basement of his family doctor’s great granddaughter’s house, that he accepts his former identity.
Tony finishes with a choked off groan, tension waning as he sags at the middle, bending in over himself. The moment is brief, however; Tony slowly begins to stroke and rock over him again, Steve’s length yet hard in his grasp.
“No, no, I want this deal. I want to be on this lot as much as humanly possible,” Tony replies quickly. Pepper’s eyes narrow.
“Is it because of me?”  And yet despite what had nearly happened, Tony hadn’t really thought Steve was
“I think you two need to talk.  And I think you need to pack up anything you have here that’s yours and get back into the tower permanently.  No more running away.”
“Okay.”  Tony takes a deep breath, totally out of his depth.  He considers calling Pepper and asking her what to do, but calling her in front of Steve doesn’t seem right and he doesn’t want to leave Steve here alone so he can call her in private.  He starts composing a text message to her using Extremis but gives up, not knowing how to explain this whole mess succinctly.
“Was it the noise?” Tony asks, and Steve wonders how he knows what this is and what may have caused it. But he only wonders for a moment.
“Doing here?” Tony gestures around them both, hands and sketchbook waving back and forth.  “Well, I heard a rumor this is where you were hangin’ out.”
Being “broke” while actually being supported by middle or upper class parents is the new normal, especially in Williamsburg, and Clint accuses Tony of it often.  Steve finds the accusations baseless.  Tony never pretends he’s anything but well off; he’s very aware of what he has and how he uses it, and while he is always quick to offer a helping hand, he stopped flaunting his wealth long before they ever got together.
“Take fifteen!” Victor adjusts the timeline, his broad shoulders hunched in frustration as he lowers his megaphone.
“Yeah, there’s a bit of that going around lately, isn’t there.”  Tony sits up, ignoring Bruce’s questioning look, and pats his own pockets in a search for his phone.  Checking his messages, he discovers Pepper’s looking for him; figures, since over three hours have passed since he said he’d be making a “quick stop” at Banner’s lab.  “Don’t you like your new digs?  I know it can get a little noisy during the day with all the reconstruction, but it can’t be any noisier than that squatter’s slum you had in Kolkata. And I use the term ‘slum’ generously there.”
“That’s just…” Bruce ducks his head, almost abashed. “It’s just something I’ve been tinkering with.”
Their bodies slip and slide smoothly, the squelch of lube slightly audible underneath their heaving breaths and muttered curses.  Steve’s balls seem huge from this angle – huge and full and on display between his spread thighs as his cock pushes into Bucky again and again. Bucky’s body, though willing, still strains to accommodate that impressive girth, his slick hole stretched obscenely around it. Steve’s hips snap up, driving hard enough to bounce the mattress, and Bucky clenches around his cock. He forces a loud moan from Steve that practically reverberates through Tony’s body.
“Fantastic.”  Tony mumbles, tilting his wrist to swirl the ice in his glass.  “If you’re going to tell me how wonderful he was, I’d rather get a few more of these in me first.”
They don’t speak as Tony guides them back through his bedroom, down the stairs, across the vast foyer and out to the driveway. Happy is indeed idling in front of the garage, turning his headlights back on and stepping out to circle around to open the front passenger door as he sees Tony and Steve step outside.
“No you haven’t.”  She says, picking up the now ice cold plate of eggs and bacon he’d ignored.  Pepper turns to Bruce.  “I heard about Dr. Ross.  I’m terribly sorry.”
“Looks like you’re stuck with me, then.”  Tony slams back his last shot and lets Pepper pull him in.  There’s really not much room for dancing and Steve’s only a few feet away as he sways with Pepper to the thrum of the upright bass.
“He told me what happened.  Or rather, I forced it out of him after three days of self-indulgent wallowing and binge drinking.”
“God, Steve, it wasn’t about that.”  Tony runs both his hands through his hair.  “And just so you know, if there’s someone after
“That simple, huh.”  Tony chimes in skeptically and Steve starts.  He hadn’t forgotten there were other people in the room, certainly, but it’s like he’d forgotten they could speak.  “Zangief just woke up this morning and was like, ‘Hey, today’s as a good a day as any to turn myself into a super secret spy organization’?  Or, what, he had a hankering for an incredibly uncomfortable interrogation in SHIELD’s super swank prison block?”
“I’d get inside you, fuck you nice and slow and hard.”  He can feel a surge of pre-come drip from his dick as he speaks the words, the thought more than enough to bring him near the edge.  Steve’s face darkens in the best way, his eyes dilating with pleasure.  Steve turns and pulls out his nightstand drawer halfway, leaves it hanging open.  He then stretches out across his bed.
But Tony doesn’t have a clue why he came, or more to the crux of the matter, what he hopes to gain from being here.  All he knows is that he was in his lab and he felt like he was crawling out of his skin.  After a few weeks the excitement over the plans to reconfigure Stark Tower for the Avengers’ use wore off, and even the prospect of the work he and Bruce might be able to complete together, their two great minds combined, faded as nighttime minutes ceaselessly ticked their way into early morning hours.  Not even repairs and re-designs to his suit could release the pressure building up inside of him and he could feel his gears rattling, gaskets getting ready to blow.
Steve glances off set, locating Tony almost immediately. He’d only arrived an hour previously, right on time for his daily check-in on his big investment, and it’s unfortunately been nothing but chaos since. His look goes unnoticed, as Tony is pulled into discussion with an exasperated Erik Lensherr and the cinematographer, Bruce Banner. Bruce is as rumpled and stressed as ever, Lensherr is positively apoplectic, and Tony is grimacing at them both. He looks worn-out, some of the usual mischievousness drained away from his countenance, but Steve’s heart still skips at the sight of him.
“It’s simple, not easy,” Rhodey corrects. “Track him down and do it before you let it go too long.” He pats Tony’s knee twice more before standing up. “Make it right – you know that I’ve always wanted to meet Captain America.”
“Tony…” Steve pulls his shirt back down around his waist and looks around for his sweatpants. Tony picks them up from their crumpled pile on the tiled floor and hands them to Steve, who slips them on and lowers himself down off the counter. “You don’t really mean that.”
“I take it he’s not always this lovely?” Bucky smirks.  “I don’t really know the man.  And apart from the couple of scans and tests he’s run so far on this messed up mind of mine, I haven’t spent much time with him.”
“Steve.” Tony pats a hand against Steve’s broad chest, and then unknots his tie and starts unbuttoning his shirt.
"Shouting ‘Irrrrrrrrrrrrr-viiiiiiiiing!’ at the top of her lungs--" Bucky joins in, remembering the shrill call so clearly.
“Stark has a treadmill in his own gym, on his own floor,” she says quietly, lips still brushing his face, and then ducks past him toward the exit.
“Forgive me for saying so, Stevie, but the wounded male ego is quite possibly the most idiotic thing I've ever seen. The 'stronger sex' is quite the pathetic joke.”
“Tony…” Steve groans. A drop of pre-cum drips from the slit of Steve’s cock to pool just below his navel, and Tony thinks maybe he’s not the only one who finds this standstill arousing.
“I…” Steve frowns, and it’s an expression Tony is very familiar with, having seen it on so many other lovers’ faces before. Disappointment. Regret. Doubt. Even if it wasn’t intentional, Tony had still stood him up.  “It’s fine, Tony.”
Steve’s lips part in a silent moan, legs spreading and hips arching as Tony wraps fingers around his cock.  His length swells further in Tony’s loose grasp and it gives Tony a powerful, heady feeling that nearly makes him dizzy.
“Fuck, you two are beautiful.” Bucky says louder, and in English, and Tony confidently returns to what he was doing.
“I want to do everything with you, Steve. Everything.” He kisses Steve deeply, groaning at the taste of himself in Steve’s mouth. When he thumps his head back against the couch, he seems to be in a daze. “Can’t believe you made me come already. There’s so much I need to…”
“He’s not ready to face you, Steve.”  Natasha’s voice is soft.  She sets a gentle hand on his shoulder.  “Give him time.”
Taking off without saying a word to anyone hadn’t really been a scenario Tony had run down.   He shouldn’t be surprised he knows less about Steve than he thought he did, considering how hard he’d tried to avoid getting close to the man.
“All the better.” Bucky locates three wine glasses, all mismatched, and sets them on the table in front of Jan before setting to work with the corkscrew. Jan watches him work one-handed with a spark of interest, her eyes following him keenly.
“Come on, Jan, time to head out,” Nat urges her, trying without much luck to get Jan up on her own two feet.
“Anyway.  Banner’s floor is the one below yours.  Stark’s got the top floors of the tower to himself.    You know the main floor’s on fifty-three, gym’s on fifty-two, but there’s a chart in your kitchen as to what’s where if you need it.  Also Pepper’s doing.  Labs are forty-eight through fifty, his workshop’s fifty-one, but Stark’s got ‘em all on lockdown.  No visitors.”
“Gray’s Papaya is better,” Tony comments, wiping ketchup from his lips, but Steve doesn’t really care if Gray’s is better or not.  They can keep their recession specials; he’ll take the Coney Island boardwalk any day.  “I’m glad we already did the Cyclone, I don’t think I’d enjoy it after this.”
He climbs two steps up toward Bucky and Steve but stops when Steve glances away, his eyes seeking Nat and Jan as they cross the street to Jan’s bungalow. The low-key glow from the pendant streetlamp illuminates the side of his face and for the first time, Tony can see the tension in the set of his jaw.
“Uh, well…” Tony comes all the way out onto the landing, shoving his hands into his front pockets.  “I know you got the kids in the divorce and all, so I just wanted to make sure that it was cool I was here.  It was Pepper’s idea.  So…blame her.”
His next thought is that Steve should not be out here, not when he’s recovering. He’s god damned barefoot, for Christ’s sake.
“Yeah, anyway.”  Steve sighs, pulling back and sitting on the edge of the curb.  He runs a hand over the scruff on his neck, the gesture of a man clearly not used to going unshaven.
“You might want to check that soundproofing,” Clint then mutters to Tony out of the corner of his mouth, clearly forgetting Steve’s sense of hearing is sharp.  Tony, already on his way back to Steve’s side, hesitates slightly in his next step.  He nods quickly to acknowledge Clint’s advice and keeps on going.
“Yeah, probably hard to, over your Rocky impersonation,” Tony gestures first to his own ears and then to the punching bag.  “Adrian…!” He Stallone-mumbles, even though he knows Steve won’t get it.  He tries to keep his own expression as level and easygoing as possible as he saunters toward the center of the gym where Steve stands.
So what if Bucky’s alive but doesn’t want to see him.  He should be thrilled over the fact of Bucky’s survival alone.  It defies logic.  And while it would be indescribably amazing to have his best friend back, let alone back here in
“But I wasn’t wrong, was I?” Tony lays it out there, and even if Bucky doesn’t answer, it would still be an answer, so he waits a beat, trying to find the right words that won’t make everything so much worse than it already is.
aren’t going to call Stark, can I keep this?” She retrieves the business card from Jane’s grasp and examines it. “A big get like Stark for our client list might mean someone might actually have to start paying me to do this job.”
“Ah.”  Tony’s jaw tightens.  He shoves his hands in his pockets as they continue on, falling suspiciously silent.
“I do agree, sir.  I do however understand the inclination.  Many have expressed frustration with Master Stark.”
Steve picks up the book that’s splayed over his stomach and puts it aside on the coffee table, not bothering to mark his page.  Then he reaches and runs a hand up Tony’s arm, sitting up just a little in order to get the leverage to pull Tony forward.  Tony goes easily, settling himself on top of Steve.  For someone who is basically a solid wall of muscle, Steve’s body is surprisingly comfortable underneath his.
That he’s even here at Fashion Week at all is entirely Pepper’s doing.  For the past few days, she’s been dragging Tony to red carpet events and parties, but tonight she’d suggested he tag along.  Apparently the Diane von Furstenberg show and after party were not to be missed.  The invitation had been phrased as a polite request but it was clear the only acceptable answer was yes.
He looks around slowly, almost like he’s sizing everyone up and gauging the overall mood.  Steve hates how wary Bucky remains, identifying threats and exit routes in every room he enters.  He hates that he can’t do anything to make it better, because he and Bucky still feel all jumbled and strange and awkward in a way Steve never dreamed possible.  It’s only gotten worse since he’d officially began dating Tony, like Bucky has even less of an idea how to be around him now.
The lumber yard is just across the way, and Tony wonders if that’s where the man ducked into. The tool belt and the sawdust on his pants clearly mean he’s a workman of some kind. They’ve already seen the lumber yard, but Tony debates asking to go back and hurriedly tries to come up with a good reason for doing so.
“Gee, thanks.” Bucky mumbles and falls into line behind Steve, clapping a hand over Steve’s shoulder and playfully shoving him out the door, nearly pushing him into Tony in the process.  Tony hits 3B on the elevator as they get in and Steve shoots him a questioning look.
“What would be the point of that.” It’s not really a question. Bucky turns, putting his back to the city, his gaze again coming to rest on Steve. It’s like seeing him as a painting or on TV, perfect but distant. He looks comfortable,
of Steve’s frankly incredible size Bucky had taken in.  The flushed skin of Steve’s thick length is slick with lube and come and he’s impossibly half-hard again, or maybe half-hard
“I don’t think he’s up to standing,” Bucky interjects, his head filling with visions of Steve getting dizzy, knocking himself unconscious and bloody as he falls, head smacking against unforgiving porcelain and brass. It’s not something he has to pull from his imagination – happened winter of ’37, the year after his ma passed. Steve almost didn’t make it back from that one.
“It’s a beautiful place,” Sam replies as Tony leads them all out of the foyer and toward the dining room.  “I always thought this joint was a museum or something.”
“Bruce?  You know Dr. Banner?”  Steve’s head is swimming and he draws in as deep a breath as he can.  He focuses on her long enough to see her running her hands over the controls of the helicopter, mouthing something to herself.  “Dr. Ross?  Do you know how to do this?”
“I’ll play you,” Jane offers, clambering up from her place on the floor.  She’s probably just eager for a real seat.  Steve had run out of room rather quickly.  This gathering hadn’t exactly been planned and his – and now Bucky’s – apartment isn’t equipped for this much company.
“Now you believe in privacy?” Tony mutters as she closes the door behind her. His thumb hovers over one of the missed calls, and he hesitates for a few moments before finally pressing down to send the call back.
“Gorgeous.”  Tony hefts the pumpkin up.  “Grab those candles, Cap, and follow me.  Barnes, you come too, you can destroy your pumpkin later.”
“Are you sure about this?” He forces himself to ask, shocked by how wrecked his voice already is.  Steve’s fingers flex and then tug a little at his hair before he lets go to use both hands to pull Tony to stand.
“You want to talk about it?” The offer is surprising but that doesn’t mean Steve’s about to take Tony up on it.
“Well, you don’t have much choice.  Now you have your own space, and I can finally have my workshop back.  It all works out great.”
“It’s me.” Tony whispers, toeing off his shoes as he makes his way across the room, letting them stay where they fall.
It hurts that he’s made Tony feel that way, but Steve knows enough to realize that any reassurances now, Tony’s going to write off as false platitudes.  Even if they are the truth.
Bucky runs his thumbnail over his bottom lip, his gaze trained toward the windows, out at the night sky. His book lies forgotten in his lap.
Natasha had ceded their vigil to him alone only an hour ago, the days of nearly non-stop running and fighting finally catching up to her.  She’d reluctantly given in and curled up in one of the jump seats, using his coat as a shield against the pervasive chill of the hold and wadding up his hoodie for a makeshift pillow.  It’s a sign of how far the two of them have come that she’s able to sleep unarmed in his company, trusting him not to betray her when she’s vulnerable but also to protect her if the need arises.
Something like relief washes over him as they tumble back onto the sheets in a jumble of limbs. He’s feverishly warm and sweaty and his dirty skin sticks to Tony’s, but he doesn’t care. He can’t fathom anything else right now; all he wants is to stay in Tony’s arms.
“You’re hilarious, go away.” Steve doesn’t open his eyes as he bats off the hand Tony is running through his hair.
Instead, he finds Steve, standing over the stove.  It’s been over two months since the whole crew moved in yet seeing any of them in the house still registers as a surprise.
He draws his hand back too quickly, he knows. This is what Pierce must have been waiting for. Something unwanted and unbidden. Something against orders.
The way the saleswomen fawn over Steve is worth the minor annoyance.   He sits and watches the floorshow as he teases Steve into trying on about six different outfits.  All of them look disturbingly good.  He makes a grave error in judgment and barges into the dressing room when Steve gets stubborn about outfit number seven.  He’s got his hands on Steve’s belt, insisting that Steve try on the darker wash of Diesels, before he thinks about what he’s doing.
“I know near everyone on the film is one of your little compatriots, but don’t forget it's still my film.” Tony doesn't slam the door behind him as he goes, but he might as well have. Steve stares at the empty space where Tony just was, wondering how exactly things between them could have changed so much without him partaking in a second of it. It's like Tony went to New York City and came back a different person all together.
“Can’t get through to anyone,” Steve reports.  He’s been standing behind him the whole time, one eye on what Tony’s doing and the other on the phone as he tries to call the Avengers, anyone he knows that’s at all connected with SHIELD.
Nigel sorts through the large number of keys on his ring and selects one carefully. Steve doesn’t even
Instead, he faces forward to find that Tony is taking the seat in front of him, Pepper to his left and buxom bombshell Susan Storm to his right. Her last picture,
“I know, gross over-simplification of a far more complex matter, you’re Shrek, you’re a big green monster of an onion, you’ve got layers.” Tony waves Bruce off, wondering how long it will take Bruce to realize that when he says he gets it, he really does
Tony chuckles darkly to himself.  If it were only a bit of personal risk, he might tell Steve how much of a mess he is and why, but he doesn’t want to put Steve through that.  It’s startlingly obvious he’s last in a growing list of people who clearly love Steve, and he knows that it’s only a matter of time before Natasha or Bucky take their place by Steve’s side.  Hell, he’s helping Bucky get there.  It’d just confuse Steve if Tony suddenly threw all his bullshit down on top of everything else.
“JARVIS, light the fire, would you please?”  Comes a voice from behind him.  Steve hurriedly rubs his cheeks and nose, wanting to erase any trace of sadness.  It’s the second time Tony has snuck up on him today and it’s odd, because no one except Natasha has been able to get close without him noticing.  Natasha can do it because, well, she’s been trained to do it, it’s what she does.
“So now that our fugitive friends are back in the fold…Steve and I worked some stuff out.” Tony doesn’t explain further, though there’s clearly more explanation to be had.
The Land of Dreams, people called it. Just another lie in a life full of lies. He wishes he had never come back to California at all.
Walking to the hotel with Steve has that weight, that importance, but Tony’s unfamiliar with the feeling that things are taking a turn for the better, not the worse. He’s never had his life change right in front of his eyes and been brimming with hopeful anticipation like he is right now.
“Here is Bruce!” Thor waves out the window, gesturing for Bruce to come inside.  Clint opens his mouth to try and withdraw his acquiesce, but Natasha smirks at him.
Steve bolts upright, automatically reaching for the knife he keeps inside the night table. His hand hits solid wood – no handle, no drawer. This isn’t his furniture; this isn’t his bedroom.
, but the thought crosses his mind that maybe Steve’s sick of being asked these things.  Like he’s a human time capsule only here to compare and contrast the now and the then.
.”  Tony teases but Steve doesn’t placate him with a smile this time.  Tony leans back on the bench, stretching his arms out along the back.  He taps his fingers against the wood, giving him a silently appraising look.  “I get it, it’s cool.”
Natasha slips by him into the backseat, but the thought of spending a fraught car ride uptown makes Steve hesitate in following.
Tony just about swallows his tongue as Bucky lifts himself off of Steve, cock sliding out slowly, slowly, slowly, emphasizing just
“Dunno, I’d think of something. You sold war bonds, maybe I need your help to charm the investors, ever think of that?”
“You vouched for him, didn’t you.” Gabe doesn't phrase it as a question because everyone already knows the answer. Steve shrugs a little, not about to explain himself. Scott’s a decent fellow, and when he came to Steve, desperate and broke, and asked for any help he could offer, Steve had been glad to go to bat for him with the producer of this picture.
It’s not comfortable, exactly, but it’s the same amount of empty he feels when he’s at his own place so he figures it’s just as well.
The memory is so vivid that he wakes with his heart beating wildly in his chest, Steve’s name echoing in the empty room.
“Looks like the Starks are comin’ back to Hollywood,” Bucky announces as he barrels in through the front door.  He tosses a folded newspaper directly at Steve’s face.  Steve can’t help but startle, and the line of his drawing jerks askew.  Bucky flops onto the sofa with a self-satisfied smirk. He loosens his tie and then unbuttons his shirt collar, making himself perfectly comfortable.
“Steve,” Bucky says softly, and they tumble back onto the couch, Bucky on top of him. Bucky’s body covers his, head to toe, enveloping him in his warmth and his comforting smell. When Bucky had remembered what scent he used to wear,
“Yeah, and all that,” Steve smiles at Tony’s blasé description of the great outdoors.  Tony looks straight out across the mountains, the corner of his mouth curving upward.
“Forgive me if I’m mistaken here, Natasha, but your writing partner just went to the office. Shouldn’t you be there as well? I was under the impression that was how this all worked.” He keeps his tone carefully casual as he searches for the carafe of milk. The glass is slippery with condensation as he takes it out and turns back to face his unexpected guest.
“Whoever they are, they’re bad enough news that Fury warned off the city’s emergency personnel,” Clint states.  “He called for backup from other SHIELD locations but either the message never got out or no one showed.”
Tony takes a quick step back, mustering up a look of contrition as best he can. He casts his gaze about Bruce’s small workshop. There are three workbenches arranged in a U in the center of the space. Bruce sits in the center on a wheeled chair, bent over the table to the right. On top of the left table is an old Bolex, deconstructed to all its component parts and pieces, surrounded by cannibalized parts of another camera that Tony can’t hope to identify from its scattered remains. The table at the bottom of the U is covered in battered light fixtures, Fresnel lenses, power cords, and empty bulb boxes. All this assorted detritus weighs down a stack of curling and wrinkled blue prints, drawings, and schematics.
No one else will ever get to see Steve like this.  Touch him like this.  No one else will share his bed, or share those easy early morning smiles or late night embraces.
Before, when the silence between them had been loaded and awkward, like Steve was accepting Tony’s presence reluctantly but was too polite to tell him to shove off.  Tony had taken advantage of that knowingly.
Namely that Tony Stark wasn’t waiting for him the last time around.  Tony is leaning lazily against the side of a sleek black town car.  Steve’s heart lifts a little, hopeful, until he gets close enough to read the closed expression on Tony’s face, eyes hidden by dark purple shades.  The gold frames glint in the late afternoon sunlight.
He wraps his legs around Bucky’s waist and rubs against him. They lose time, somehow, minutes piling up into half an hour as they passionately neck on the couch the way they might have if they’d given into this back when they were kids.
On the Tuesday morning after his return to the tower, he enters the studio to find Tony already there, studying the hologram with an interested look on his face.
“A lady doesn’t like to be rushed, Rogers.” Natasha unfolds from her seat, the robe of Bucky’s that she’s borrowed dangerously loose as she saunters close. A smile curves over her full lips, her green eyes bright with mischief. “You’re just
“Do me a favor, set up a meeting with Odin Borson over at the Citizen News for this afternoon. He still owns that whole set-up over there, doesn’t he?”
“When I saw how late it was, I panicked and hopped in the car and came right over, I wasn’t thinking all that clearly. I guess I hoped you’d still be up.”
He keeps waking up screaming, sure that the dark, gaping maw of the Chitauri’s portal above his once-beloved building has swallowed the city whole.
Knowing and feeling are two entirely different matters and somehow he wakes up with that clear distinction in his head every time.
Bucky allows the topic change, following Steve’s cue. He picks up the plastic container and edges closer to Steve, offering him a spoonful.
“Pepper!”  Tony supplies the woman with a name.  His smile is sloppy; her answering one is tight and grim.  Despite that, she’s still quite beautiful…elegant and slender and carrying herself with a clear sense of purpose despite the tired look in her eyes.  She’s pretty much the opposite of Tony, as light as he is dark, carefully held together whereas Tony is some kind of elaborate mess.
Tony shivers sympathetically and presses a kiss to Steve’s temple before snaking his left hand out to grab Steve’s nearly empty coffee mug. He backs away and goes to the coffee machine to re-fill it, so Steve will have something hot to wrap his hands around, and to prepare a cup of his own.
Apart from the teakettle on the stove and the toaster on the counter, the kitchen is unsurprisingly free of gadgets and appliances.  The drying rack by the sink implies Steve’s never bothered to open the dishwasher.  There’s decaying vintage art of the American flag on the pale green wall and Tony suspects that apart from the cross hanging by the door, that’s as far into decorating the place as Steve will ever get.
“If by plunge, you mean the initiative, then yes,” Carol nods, shooting a look over her shoulder at Rhodey as Tony finally lets her pull away, disentangling herself from his messy embrace. “I thought it about time that Jim and I stop waiting for the whole world to catch up to us.” She runs her fingers through her long blonde hair, the golden strands ruffled from Tony's ecstatic embrace. “I never was very patient.”
“Jimmy here is more fun than you, Stevie,” she coos, and then leans toward Bucky in a jokingly confidential aside. “That boy over there blushes if you even
Tony waves Steve off, knowing from the earnest look on his face that this is going somewhere touchy-feely and not wanting to visit that particular land of marshmallows and sunshine tonight.
Tony’s hand shakes as he unlocks his door. He glances at Steve, hoping he hasn’t noticed the sudden bout of nerves, but he finds Steve gazing right back at him with this soft, open look that takes his breath away.
“I don’t.  I’m a little confused, to be honest.  I thought maybe you and he…but then he…And now…” Steve stops, not comfortable with talking about this at all, much less with Tony’s ex-girlfriend.  He turns the stove back on and picks up the spatula, eager for a distraction.
“You didn’t even tell me you had a meeting with him. Since when do you keep secrets?” Bucky runs his hand through his hair, clearly exasperated. Steve's getting there himself.
How many hours, days, weeks of his life had he spent simmering and stewing in his jealousy of that man? Tony seethed with it to the point of being sick and spent, exhausted by the force of his own envy.
“To be honest, I’m surprised they didn’t lock us up together somewhere.  This is positively tame considering the players involved.”  Tony comments.  He walks to the line where the kitchen floor meets the living room carpet and waves his arm across it tentatively, testing the imaginary barrier.  “Nope, we’re good.  We can totally get out of here.”
“I am?” Steve has to laugh, loudly and honestly, at that. “You’re going to be so disappointed if that’s what you think of me.”
Tony tilts his face up to look at him as he moves in to wrap his fingers around Tony’s collar. His wet hands dampen the deep red silk of Tony’s robe as he tugs it open; his palms warm Tony’s cool skin as he skims his hands down Tony’s sides to settle on his hips.
He’s opening Steve’s pants, though, shoving his underwear down to his thighs, and Steve’s already got both their cocks in his big, strong hand, stroking and rubbing their lengths together.
Still, Steve has to admit he might get a little more touchy-feely whenever he’s in the presence of Tony’s ex-girlfriend and current business partner, Pepper, so it seems neither he nor Tony are really as imperturbable as they pretend to be.
“Tony’s a bit of a blabbermouth, seems like.” Bucky comments, pushing out a short, airy laugh. He lifts one hand to his hair, running his fingers through it slowly. He looks at Steve shyly as he does it, perfect teeth worrying his bottom lip. “Saying all the things for us before we can say them ourselves.”
“What do you think, Dr. Banner?” Thor inquires as Bruce enters the room, having decamped upstairs earlier when he discovered that crafting of any kind made the Other Guy frustrated and antsy.
Tony lets his arm fall; he walks backward for a few paces until he’s sure that Steve is actually moving to follow. Once Steve has closed the gap between them, Tony reluctantly turns and faces forward.
Sam circles the couch and does his own quick investigation of the titles on offer, snorting in amusement.
As Steve starts to collect his clothes, scattered all over the room from the night before, Tony leans idly in the doorway with his arms crossed over his chest.
“Okay.”  Tony grinds out, putting some space back between them.  “Well if you ever decide to overhaul that 1940s tendency to unhealthily repress your huge amounts of man pain, Banner’s a
“Did you honestly bring me to 21?  That’s not…I never once in my life came here, Tony, there’s no way I could have afforded it.”  New York has always been a different city for the rich than for the poor.
He settles into a booth and waits for Steve to stop talking about the good old days with the geezer at the counter, and come back and join him in the real world.  He suddenly feels annoyed and perplexed, the blurred events of the last few days starting to become clear.  And the facts are these:
It’s odd, because as much as Darcy claims to be humiliated, she’s enumerating her perceived failings very plainly without any semblance of embarrassment. Steve isn’t quite sure what to make of her.
“Figured. It’s the only thing he doesn't mess up,” Bucky stage whispers to Jan. He pops open the fridge and grabs himself a beer.
But then the light turns on, goes just as quickly off, giving him enough of a glimpse to know that Director Fury has made contact.  His information was on the money; the blond man would lead him right to his mark.
To be fair, even without Tony it would’ve been a lot to handle.  There are too many lights, too many people, and too much noise.  It’s an assault on his already hyperactive senses and it leaves him constantly tense, incessantly on his guard.   After only a few hours inside Caesar’s Palace watching Tony gamble, Steve quietly excuses himself to their room.
“I’m fine,” Tony reclaims his drink, finishes it with a long swig, and places the empty back in Steve’s grasp.  “But you’re right, it’s late.  I should go.”
“I love you.” Tony whispers desperately against Steve’s lips, not giving Steve time to reply before kissing him again. Steve makes a small noise like a whimper and starts to pull back, but Tony chases his lips.
important. Tony felt it imperative to milk the night for all it was worth in case another opportunity didn’t immediately present itself.
Tony picks up his pace and somehow winds up a few steps ahead.  He stops at their door, his key card in the slot and his hand on the knob, and looks back at Steve.
Pierce arrives and pontificates about his larger purpose, but he can’t think of anything except the man on the bridge.  He doesn’t care what Pierce wants him to do, he only wants to know why there is suddenly this gaping hole in the center of his chest, this insurmountable amount of longing and pain unlike anything he’s ever felt.
Not having expected such candor, it takes Tony a beat to wrap his mind around what Steve said.   Steve sips his tea in the meantime, watching Tony over the rim of the glass.
– he does this, goes after Steve, it’s going to mean losing her for good.  It’s a huge risk that he doesn’t want to take, especially since being with Steve is beyond wishful thinking and Pepper’s so real, and so very much his.
“Don’t think I’d be like this if it wasn’t with you,” Steve murmurs, rotating his hips as he thrusts.  Tony tightens around him, giving as good as he gets and making Steve moan.  “Never expected it to be this way.”
There are faint marks on both his shoulders and his collarbone. Not deep enough to be bruises, but enough to remember Tony’s hands pressing hard for leverage as he rode him to completion.
Their intentions had been kind.  Clint, Natasha, and apparently Bruce went through a lot of pretense to bring him here tonight, but it doesn’t matter.  He’ll never fit in here without Tony.
Steve belatedly notices there are two guards inside the room, posted on either side of the closed door.  He doesn’t know them but he can tell they’re SHIELD down to their very cores.  They stare at Bucky and make no move to alert anyone of anything.
“At high tide, this whole beach is under five feet of water.” Steve breaks the silence that’s reigned between them since they parked the Cadillac and carefully crossed the Pacific Coast Highway, and walked down a long, steep set of concrete stairs to reach the wet sand now underfoot. The afternoon high tide has already partially receded, but the shoreline is still narrow. “All you can see are those big rocks out there. Water comes right up to the houses.”
All at once the droll tones of JARVIS explaining how Thor’s encounter with a medicine ball went horribly awry are drowned out by an avalanche of noise. Steve rounds the corner first, Bucky less than half a step behind him.  It’s like a merry band of brothers piling into his kitchen, everyone boisterous and smiling.  Even Natasha looks mildly happy.  Only Bruce and Betty are absent; but Thor has evidently brought Jane and Darcy along this time and Darcy’s loud enough to make up for four people, much less two.
“Oh, yeah, sure, right, this is common courtesy…” Tony growls out, looking like he’s ready to give Fury a go.  Bruce puts a hand against Tony’s chest and tries to steady him, catch his gaze and tell him silently to calm down.
“Don’t take your shit out on me, Barnes.” Natasha snaps back, her voice moving further away from the bedroom. “Just wake him up if you’re so damn worried. I’m going to go call Sam and let him know Steve’s been found.”
He tugs down the waistband of his black sweats, fingers running along a rough line of stitches leading across his stomach from his hip toward his navel.
“That I do.” She stands on tiptoe and presses a kiss to his cheek, chaste and sweet. She may like teasing him, but they both know their relationship isn’t like that in the slightest. Before he got healthy, he never would have thought a woman like Natasha would pay him any mind and even if she had, he wouldn’t have known what in the world to say to her. Now they are the closest of friends and he could tell her almost anything.
He’s been awake and in the world for enough hours now to read the image as old. The man in the picture is young.
“I apologize for the unusual arrangement. Tony insisted I pick you up in the Delahaye. Between you and me, pal, I think he might be showing off a bit.” Happy actually nudges him with his elbow good-naturedly, and Steve tries to loosen up.
“Just don’t like it there much, if you forgive me for saying so.”  Steve turns away from the fragmented view and back to his comrades.  “It’s not for me.”
and he speaks of the role reversals – The woman is the kickass police detective!  The man’s her sidekick! – with such excitement that Tony sometimes needs to remind him these characters aren’t real.
Adrenaline is still ripping through his veins when they finally reach the mansion.  Tony paws at Steve as they stumble upstairs from the underground garage; neither one of them seems willing to break contact for even a moment.  Steve pins him against the wall in the kitchen the second they enter the room, swallowing his surprised grunt as they kiss.
He’s ready for more, and as Bucky hesitates, Steve realizes maybe Bucky is waiting for him to take the next step.
“Why are you nervous?” The knot of anxiety that’s been coiled inside Steve’s stomach relaxes as he recognizes something akin to vulnerability in Tony for the first time all evening. It’s even more winning than that armor of self-confidence.
“Huh.  I didn’t get any messages.” Tony shrugs, hitting a few buttons and sending a text to himself.  It dings on arrival and he holds up his phone as evidence of pressing matters.  “Hey look, I gotta go.  Catch you cats later.”
The hatred that wells up within him is real and raw and different from anything he’s felt toward the man before.
her lover, nor does he plan to be, but he can’t blame Wanda for playing it that way. Men in this town want what other powerful men have, and millionaire businessman Tony Stark is probably a nice stepping stone to the ones who can open the right doors for an up-and-coming actress like Maximoff.
Tony sidles down the row in front of Steve this time, plopping himself down in Steve’s direct line of vision. Steve blinks at him slowly, as if his own vision is just coming back into focus.
Steve pauses to consider his route, opting to avoid the tourist hustle and bustle of Times Square and head east for two blocks before turning to trek up Fifth Avenue.
“Yo, bitches, dinner’s almost ready!” Darcy pops her head in from the kitchen.  “Wash your hands and stuff, don’t make me mommy you.  Unless you’re into that.”  She winks at Bucky and Clint before ducking back.
He takes a deep breath, shoring himself up.  He still seems shaky though, and Tony finds himself moving in closer yet again.
,” he whispers, his gaze moving rapidly over the swirl of colors and delicate glass, trying to take it all in at once.
Bucky sighs, and Tony can imagine him pulling at his shaggy brown hair, tension tangled in his fingers.
me to call her Nat, and I like being irritating.  I’m guessing that my reasons aren’t exactly in line with your reasons.”
“But at least you have a nice view of the stars.” Steve cuts Tony off. He tilts his head back a little to look up at the dark night sky. “Away from the city lights and smog and all of that.”
“They’re not dead.”  The woman says, stopping in front of a closed, solid sliding door and hitting numbers quickly on the access pad.  “They’re only unconscious.  It won’t last for long.  That’s why we have to move.”
If Fury says anything more than that, Steve doesn’t hear it over the roaring in his ears.  The man’s mouth is still moving but it’s like being in Times Square all over again.  The overwhelming tidal wave of
Tony sets down his wine glass and then pulls his money clip from his pocket. Steve should protest but instead all he does is watch Tony’s deft fingers peel off a number of large bills and place them face up on the table. Then Tony signals to their waiter.
“One thing’s funny – I don’t know if you’ve looked in the mirror lately, but you aren’t that man.  In fact, you could walk up a random woman on the street in the middle of the day, ask her to dance with you, and she’d be more than happy to.”
Tony leans his forehead against Steve’s for a moment and they share the same air, letting a few quiet moments pass as they just breathe together.
“I know where it is.”  At least he assumes he does, unless the Starks moved the familial home to another place on Fifth since the forties.  He used to pass by it on his way to the Met and he wondered at the size of it, both amazed and appalled at the thought of one single man occupying the city block sized house while he shared a single room at the orphanage with fifteen other boys.  When he and Bucky finally got their own apartment, moving out of the boarding house to a place on Plymouth Street so small they had to share a bed and take baths in the kitchen, they’d still thought they were living like kings.
“Not a fink, Cap. Far as Fury’s concerned, I’m playing craps and getting disturbingly drunk in Monte Carlo, still rip roarin’ mad about being lied to about your pal Barnes.”  He takes the wrench from Steve, leaning in close to point out the problem.  “That’s not what you want to be doing.  It’s routed to the back of the air plate and something’s probably come loose, that’s why the oil’s misting from where it shouldn’t.  All new cycles are built this way now; it’s an EPA thing, that’s probably why you don’t know-” Tony stops himself mid-ramble.  His face is dangerously close to Steve’s.  “Anyway.”
He makes a strange whimpering noise when Tony pulls back, opening his eyes at the sudden loss.  Tony is staring at him, breathing hard and heavy, his own dark eyes wide.  Steve stares back, wondering why Tony stopped.  It’s all he can focus on.
He hasn’t been to a game in years, maybe even a decade, but he’s pretty sure there must be a better way to get to their suite than this.  Down here in the throng of be-jerseyed misanthropes, the yeasty smell of beer and soft pretzels is overwhelming and awful.  He maneuvers Steve to the escalator, not noticing until halfway up their ascent that his grip is white knuckled on the hard black plastic bannister.  He tries to let go but finds he can’t until they reach the top and it disappears from under his hand as the escalator cycles down and he’s pressed forward against his will.
rich that bothers Clint now.  He doesn’t know what Clint wants, but he suspects that in his mind, to be appropriately upfront about his wealth, Tony would have to parade around like Tony Curtis as Junior in
“Fuck, Steve…” Tony whispers under his breath, awed.  He slowly massages up and down a few times, relishing the moment, making sure he’ll always remember how this feels.  All it takes is one delicious whimper pushing from Steve’s throat and Tony’s eagerly shoving his hand through the keyhole fly to touch bare skin.
“Under no circumstances tell that man what this all costs.”  Tony instructs Cynthia, the leggy blonde at the counter who’d turned remarkably friendly when she’d helped Steve find the right fit for the dark blue sweater knit polo he’s now wearing.
“You had it removed, that’s not the same thing as temporary,” Pepper points out coolly.  “And since you’re going to have a glib answer for every other thing I bring up, I think I’ll just skip right on down to the omelette and stop there.”
“We could revolutionize the whole damn industry, if we wanted.” Tony arches an eyebrow. “I want. You want?”
Sure enough, she places a steaming cup in his hands. He breathes it in, sighing at the heavenly aroma.
“How was the walk?” Clint interrupts, reminding Tony that there are other people in the room.  He looks at Clint and Natasha, finds Natasha tight-lipped and purposefully quiet with her eyes trained intently on Steve.  If Tony’s not mistaken, she seems slightly peeved, although with her it’s really hard to tell.
“I appreciate the thought, Tony.  I do…but if it’s all the same, I think I’ll just go back to the hotel.”
“I’m your jerk,” Tony retorts, digging into the leather camera case that he uses as a satchel.  “Speaking of pleasing you, however, I picked up the Voice so we could look at the housing classifieds.”
“Wasn’t kidding.”  Steve gets it then, that maybe Tony responded this way because he knew better than to argue.  Knew better than to insist that Steve was wrong, or that Bucky’s mind could be changed or things could be talked out.  Tony knew he needed to feel something other than pain and self-recrimination.
“No, I mean, this.”  Steve interrupts, gesturing between them.  “I’m not going back with you.  I can’t.”
Pepper knows that as a kid he used to have Captain America figurines, that Cap was his childhood hero; she doesn’t know that the toys were rare personal gifts from his father, or that on the occasional, special nights that his dad was home and
Steve groans as Tony begins to move and without thinking Tony shifts forward, shoving deep and hard as he clasps his right hand over Steve’s mouth. Steve’s hips hitch and a stream of pre-come dribbles down his length. Tony’s unsure what specifically is setting Steve off here, being physically forced to stay quiet or the hard fuck, so Tony keeps both up.
Tony watches the numbers light up on the way to the top of the Tower and contemplates how he’s going to pass this day away without driving himself crazy.  Even though he hasn’t the faintest idea what he’s going to say to Steve, he wants to say it
Tony’s tongue insistently laves every inch of him with attention, lapping and licking as his dark head bobs between his legs. Steve’s never really cared about size and all that, but he has to admit he thrills at how Tony’s lips strain around his girth, how Tony occasionally and willfully chokes himself on his length, and how much Tony seems to love every second of it.
“That’s the thing. There’s gonna be a point where it’s not going to be enough, I can see that plain as day. For you, for me, for Tony. Not like we are now.”
from somewhere.  He spent enough of his life refusing to run away that that’s one thing he’s sure of.   You either stand up and stay, or you run.
Tony Stark’s been many things, and broken many rules, and people can lay any number of grievous misdeeds at his door, but he’s never been a cheater.
The disbelieving question reverberates in his mind, over and over and over.  The man on the bridge, the blond man with that defiant set to his chiseled jaw that seemed oh-so-familiar, the blond man with the red, white and blue shield and the punch that would dent metal…
Through the haze of his rapidly rising arousal, a stray thought about the costume catches at the end of his mind. Not taking his eyes from Tony, Steve manages to unbutton his shirt and ruck up his undershirt as high as it will go without breaking from Tony to actually remove it, his tie thrown back carelessly over his shoulder.
Steve dashes to the rescue this time, taking her by the elbow and easing her back from that accident waiting to happen.
He opens up the bag and pulls out a steaming hot container of soup, along with some napkins and a metal spoon he’d grabbed from the kitchen on his way in.
“Exactly. And tolerating each other ain’t gonna cut it if we’re really gonna give this a go. So…I mean, I know you're quite literally the middle man, but when Tony gets back—much as I hate to say it ‘cause it’s gonna be awkward as hell—we should all sit down together and talk. All three of us.”
The feed of Tony and Steve’s bedroom is live when Natasha slips soundlessly through the broken window, landing softly a few steps behind him.
He inhales deeply as he walks inside, trying to get a lid on all of the roiling emotions threatening to overflow.
“I can’t wait to be in my own bed,” Steve says as he reluctantly forces himself upward.  “I’m dead on my feet.”
“There is no telephone in my trailer, Mr. Stark.” Steve replies, lowering his voice tersely as he quickly closes the space between them with two long steps.
He needed to come home to re-charge.  To find his balance.  He’d created Stark Tower as a kind of beacon of hope for the future, but really it was his own North Star.  He needed this place, even if he didn’t want to admit it.
“I say if you’ve got it, flaunt it,” Darcy announces, carrying in two pans from the kitchen, steam rising from them in waves.  The smell is amazing; his stomach rumbles.  She places the food on the table and then puts her potholder-clad hands on her hips, pushing her ample bosom forward with a knowing smile.  Her bright red brassiere is pretty plain to see through the thin fabric of her purple v-neck tee.  Steve respectfully looks elsewhere but Clint lets out a hoot of approval.
Steve musters up a smile. He genuinely appreciates Sam’s offer, but the last thing Sam needs is to spend the only half hour he gets away from the piano tonight listening to Steve’s problems.
, it seems. Within a matter of days the situation escalates into something near uncontrollable – an army of robots and an
Tony completely believed Steve when he’d said there’d never been anything romantic between him and Bucky, but it’s easy to doubt when the man stands protectively by Steve’s side, so enviably and so comfortably in Steve’s space. The lines of the man’s body are hard, the planes of his face sharp, and in the dim light Tony can see no love lost for him in Bucky’s cool blue-grey eyes. Even still there’s a soft curve to him, something yearning and tender that radiates from him and envelops Steve.
“Huh, what?” Tony snaps to at the sound of his name. Pepper is standing beside him, her hand on his shoulder. The film is over, the screen bright white and the tail of the film thwapping wildly as the projectionist sets about shutting the machine down. It slowly winds down to a stop.
Steve doesn’t call after him or ask him to stay.  He doesn’t return the next day and Steve thinks maybe things have finally changed, but the day after that, Tony’s back.  He brings his own work and camps out all day long.
“You’re already falling to pieces, Steve.  Let me finish the job.  You can even blame me, if you want to. ”  Tony offers this with the practiced ease of a man used to being hated and it makes Steve’s gut twist painfully.
Tony ducks behind the bar to make himself a Manhattan. It’s not something he usually drinks, but since it requires a bit more time to make than guzzling scotch straight from the bottle – which is what he really wants to do – he figures it’s a good call.
“Sometimes in the middle of the night, or in the morning, I’d wake up and he’d be…” Steve shifts back against Tony, but the movement seems to be rooted in the memory, not about him.
The back door of the kitchen opens, the cool breeze blowing through and demanding everyone’s attention.  Steve feels Tony tense up beside him, stopping mid-action with more popcorn halfway toward his mouth.  The entire room is conspicuously quiet for a beat too long.
Tony gives him a look, one that says he knows more than Bucky suspects, but doesn’t say anything aloud.
Steve dips his head to press a calming kiss to Tony’s temple, pausing to breathe him in.  His scent – coconut and mint organic shampoo and expensive scented body oil and a vague hint of gasoline - is infinitely better than the stench of the stuffy subway station.  Steve considers just continuing to nuzzle his face against Tony’s soft hair until the train finally arrives.
Tony’s pretty sure Steve heard what Bucky said out there, and he doesn’t quite know how to handle it. On one hand, he’s sure that Steve loves him. It’d been a long, hard battle to believe that, but he won it. He’s not surrendering that crown. It’s his, and he earned it by slaying his own demons and defeating his insecurities.
Tony’s tried to fire him twice already, but Pepper always hires him back. He wonders what people would think if they knew his secretary secretly runs his company. Or maybe they already know and are just playing along with the great farce.
“This morning I was an ass.” Tony pushes his sunglasses up off his nose, perches them on the top of his head. It leaves him squinting in the sunlight like Steve had been before he turned from the water. “I pushed too hard. I do that. You should know that about me right now, up front. I’m not likely to change. Lord knows I’ve tried.”
Tony moans as well, head dropping down between his shoulders, one arm snapping out to steady himself with a hand against the mirror. His fingers scramble for purchase, streaking the lower part of the mirror clean of steam.
“Oh.” Steve feels his face heat again, and he ducks his head in an unsuccessful attempt to hide it. Jan sighs, this time cupping his face gently, her fingers dancing over his cheekbone. He glances at her, caught off guard by the shift in her touch, and finds she's looking at him with a mixture of affection and pity.
“I’ve tried to get them to change it to my name, but no dice,” Tony comments when he notices Steve looking.  Steve runs his hand over the deep-set lettering, feeling the engraved ridges of
A committee is commissioned to investigate the Winter Soldier for crimes against the United States. The Hague wants him called up on war crimes. Steve fights for his friend, and Tony cannot.
“I found their new album underwhelming, James,” Natasha states, looking like her estimation of her quasi-boyfriend is withering with every passing moment.
He needs to stop looking backward with such longing, needs to stop trying to fit these new pieces into an old puzzle.  It’s not a good idea and does everyone, both the living and the dead, a grand disservice.
“This seems highly unorthodox.  I feel like we should either have the food tested for poison or have Nat tested for alien infiltration,” Tony suggests, wincing when Pepper elbows him sharply in the ribs.  She takes the pastry box from Tony and squeezes past Steve, a kind hand resting fleetingly on his shoulder as she goes by.
.” Tony snaps so harshly that Pepper actually starts, taken aback. She stares at him, eyes wide with concern. “Just call Borson like I said. Steve can’t help. It’s Loki’s damn
He pours a triple espresso into a mug of coffee as JARVIS fills him in on what mess awaits him in the gym because Clint had challenged Thor to some kind of indoor clay pigeon contest of sorts, lightning bolts versus arrows.  Tony doesn’t want to think about it.  That’s the kind of stuff Captain America should be putting a stop to if his attentions weren’t otherwise occupied.
“And if I knew tonight was the night that you were finally going to cave, I would have worn something better than these old rags and I would have bothered with my hair,” Darcy snaps back, touching her lustrous dark curls. To Steve, she looks perfectly beautiful, but he suspects that doesn’t actually matter.
“He’s in Washington, Tony, and no, we cannot go there tonight.”  Pepper doesn’t turn around to look at him from her place in the front passenger seat.  She murmurs something to Happy, something like
“I made you a mix, darling.”  He holds a cassette case by her face, rattling it in offer, and she takes it reluctantly.
“Fuck, fuck, sorry. Tony, sorry.” Steve’s hands shake as he lifts them to briefly cover his own face as he winces, ashamed of himself for pushing too far. Tony’s glad for it, though, because he finds himself leaning over Steve, pulling away his hands and reassuring him with a kiss before he has time to second-guess his actions. He might have gone the whole night without daring to kiss him, otherwise.
“That’s for us to decide. But you need to understand that whatever we do decide, Tony’s a permanent part of the equation.”
“You’re doing that thing again where you’re talking in pop cultural riddles and expecting me to understand.”  Steve packs up the tools and slowly follows Tony, bringing the rusted metal box with him.
He feels more scared now than he had two nights before when he’d first gone up to Bucky’s apartment. Somehow
“We’re part of the same business,” Steve replies by way of explanation. What he does and what Tony does are really worlds apart, but maybe he can learn something.
Pepper’s sitting on the couch, papers strewn everywhere as she signs off on plans to begin construction on a clean energy powered tower in Los Angeles.  She’s completely unaware that he’s watching the way water slip slides over Steve’s sleek muscles as he strokes gracefully across the pool.  He can swim the whole length twice over without lifting his head to breathe.
“Natasha cooked?”  Tony blurts, his surprise evident.  As if on cue, Natasha appears in the kitchen doorway, bread knife in hand and a hard, unwelcoming look on her face.  Tony takes a huge step back.
With the return of this particular tease, Sam makes it clear that he is letting him off the hook. Steve plays along gamely, even though he knows Sam’s just tabling this conversation for a later time.
He wants to hold Steve down with his weight, lie in his arms and kiss him until the sun comes up. But his mouth is dirty and he shouldn’t stay, so he sits there, panting, as he gently eases Steve’s legs down, unfolding them along either side of his hips. He rubs his hands over Steve’s thighs and watches as Steve calms down and comes back to himself.
“Probably haven’t eaten anything in days, have you.”  His voice is shaky and Tony wants to beg him not to deny this, not to
“You’re such a dick.” Steve’s retort is muffled as he bewilderingly moves closer to Tony, practically snuggling against his side.
“Where are you?” Tony demands, simultaneously directing JARVIS to track Rhodey’s signal now that it’s live.
It’s ludicrous, when he thinks about it. He and Tony have been tangled up in each other for a month now and despite learning every inch of the man’s body, he’s never even been to his house. Tony’s only been to his the once, after that fantastic first night and disastrous morning after. For them it’s stolen moments on set and illicit hotel room rendezvous, and, one memorable night, the backseat of one of Tony’s fancy cars like overeager kids parking after a high school dance.
Light laughter and murmured chatter flows out onto the landing deck like soothing white noise; the piano player is tinkling out some version of “Rhapsody in Blue” and someone’s turned on the big flat screen above the bar.  Times Square is a riot of color and noise; a crowd full of happy faces waiting to chime in the New Year.
– I find your suggestion intriguing and therefore worthy of further investigation.”  Tony turns Steve’s hand so his forearm faces upward, then pushes up his sleeve and trails his fingers over the pale, soft skin there.  It feels fragile under his fingertips even though he knows it’s not.
Steve refuses to lose it in front of him.  In front of the team.  He disentangles his fingers from Natasha’s and folds his hands on top of the table.  He swallows around the choking sob that had been building in his throat and corrects his posture, straightening up and directing his attention to Fury.
Tony looks to Bucky, expecting the other man’s gaze to be still locked on Steve, yet he finds himself staring right into Bucky’s blue-grey eyes.  There’s a warm fondness there, a spark of desire, and something dark that’s always lurking in Bucky’s countenance – even when he looks at Steve. Tony has come to think of it as a razor’s edge, a sharpness that people like him and Bucky have because they’ve done the kind of terrible things one can never take back.
“Fuck you, Barnes.”  His long, bony fingers curl into fists at his sides but Bucky knows he’s doing it to hold back his anger; he’s not spoiling for an actual altercation. Steve stares up at him for a long moment, the heat in his gaze cooling to disappointment.
“Bucky or Natasha?”  Tony inquires as he crawls onto the bed, straddling Steve’s waist.  Steve reaches up and takes the paper.
“It’s not being unfaithful if your partner gives you permission, Steve.” Tony holds up his hand before Steve manages to open his mouth, stopping the protests before they happen. “You need to talk to Bucky. And I mean, really talk. No more repressed 1940s bullshit. And I know that sounds crazy coming from me, given how much of my life I spent thinking of ever more creative and terrible ways to ignore my problems, Steve, but see, I don’t want to do that anymore. I
It’s not like there’s anything there for Tony to taste, to see. Steve had made sure to wash thoroughly when he came home, but somehow Tony still knows. Maybe he and Bucky were just predictable.
However, it doesn’t seem to bother the man standing beside him.  Steve can hear England in his accent and suspects he may be a fashion model, but he’s been unable to focus long enough to learn much more.
“Even less like you,” Cap adds softly, leaning in toward the tapestry hanging on the wall.  He speaks in an offhand way like it was just a passing, unimportant thought, but the delivery doesn’t keep it from landing heavy and meaningful between them.
“All right as it can be.” Steve squeezes Tony’s hand lightly and then disentangles their fingers. He folds his arms, leaning on the railing. “It’s hard, being reminded of how little of our lives we actually share. ”
Admittedly, Steve Rogers, the actor playing Captain America, is quite fit; his tight costume clings to the sharp lines of his muscled body in a way that borders on obscene. His face is mostly covered at all times by a silly mask. If his strong jawline, full lips and piercing eyes are anything to go by, covering that all up was a really poor decision.
It’s a safe answer that still leaves the ball in Tony’s court, but Tony lets it pass without comment.
Pepper sighs.  Tony can practically hear her frowning over the line.  He crosses the litter-strewn parking lot and jaywalks across the nearly empty street, the sign of the Motel 6 a thoroughly depressing beacon.
“More like Plan Z, Steve, didn’t really think Fury would use me.  Bruce wasn’t supposed to find out about it, Fury figured anything Bruce knows the Hulk does too.  I’d rather not be on the Other Guy’s shit list, personally.”
“Hmm.” Tony nods to himself, impressed. He rifles through more of Bruce’s papers, officially interested. Bruce gets up and comes to his side, reaching out to stop him.
With Jarvis on his mind, when Tony comes up to the first floor and sees lights on in the kitchen, his first thought is of the butler and the way he’d be up before the sun everyday, without fail.  When he turns the corner, Tony half expects to find him there, puttering around the kitchen, polishing the silver.
But sure enough, Tony sidesteps his question with a lighthearted joke, completely missing or choosing to ignore that Steve’s question had been serious.
The lights of the sculpture seem to grow brighter as the sun goes down.  Tony sits on the marble floor and watches as it all seems to change in front of his eyes, studying it as if it will eventually give him the answers he’s searching for.
The pain helps him shake off some of the fogginess.  And whenever he moves, there’s more pain, so he keeps moving, each stab of discomfort clearing his brain of debris, bringing reality into sharper focus.  By the time he manages to maneuver into the wheelchair, his body hitting with a dense thud, he almost tells her he doesn’t want or need to sit.
He is so turned on right now, it is wildly embarrassing. Just the thought of Tony stripping Steve of his clothes was enough to make his face heat, but then he had to go and think about both men naked and kissing, and writhing, and thrusting, and—
He shifts, spreading his legs just a little, and rubs a hand over his knee to distract himself from the need to inappropriately touch Steve in front of the entire team.  He’s sure he and Steve will have their fair share of problems as they continue on – after all, he’s
“Then he and I talked for a little while about what we were considering doing and what that meant, and then…”
“If we’re being honest, I’m sure Natasha thought I’d make excuses not to come if given the opportunity. Nothing against Miss Lewis – I’m just against the general idea of being set up at all.” He’d been done with that even before the war, thanks to the thoroughly unsuccessful double dates that Bucky would arrange.
But it wasn’t the end of the line.  Bucky – in that moment, he felt like the name, perhaps even like the man – grabbed onto Steve Rogers’ shoulder and held on tight.  On the riverbank now, he stares down at the man that he has saved and he can only feel terror, dismay.
“Well let me tell you…” Tony starts, and then quickly realizes that he has no idea how to verbalize exactly how beautiful Steve’s work seems to him, or why.  “Okay, nevermind.  Just know that your evaluation of the piece has vastly underwhelmed me.”
He draws back quickly, guiltily, when he feels Tony’s gaze resting upon him, and casts an awkward glance his direction.
“I’ve been ridiculous and I’ve been defensive on separate occasions, but never both at the same time. I feel this is an accomplishment,” Tony jokes sardonically, tilting his chin up slightly as if he’s proud.
“Before you got hit with the super juice, before you became Mr. All-American Hero.  You did something, right?  A job?  A hobby?”
“You should talk to him tomorrow, Cap.”  Natasha murmurs drowsily, adjusting her head so it’s pillowed against his shoulder.  He doesn’t ask her who she means, or how she knew.  “He was really scared.”
, but it makes no difference.  The panic fades because he’s hopeless to stop it and then comes darkness.
His gaze follows Nat as she slips across the kitchen and deposits the empty container in the trash and the spoon into the dishwasher.  He wonders if she intentionally means to move like this all the time or if it’s been drilled into the core of her being like so much else.  She turns to face him as she pushes the dishwasher firmly closed behind her.
,” Bucky curses as Steve works all the way down his length, nose pressed into the dark thatch of curls between Bucky’s legs. With his other hand he rubs gently at the sensitive spot behind Bucky’s balls, and Bucky makes a strangled, beautiful noise. His thighs tense, legs spreading wider, and where Steve has his other hand flat on Bucky’s abdomen, he feels the twitching and clenching of muscles that warn him what’s about to happen even before Bucky can get the words out himself.
Tony hates it when people press him when he doesn’t want to talk, but he so often finds himself crossing the line in the other direction that he doesn’t think before pushing the matter.
Bucky tosses the cap into the air and snatches it open palmed, holding his beer tightly with the metal prosthesis that serves as his other hand. With his thumb he sharply flicks the cap in Steve’s direction, his aim impeccable as always. Steve deflects it easily toward the threadbare throw rug. It rolls down onto the worn hardwood floor with a metallic rattle.
"No worries, Pete, I'll keep this just between us." He's serious, not teasing, but only for a moment. He pushes off Peter’s thigh as he stands. “But, uh, you really might want to hit the men’s room, cause that doesn’t look like it’s going anywhere anytime soon.”
“Hey boss.” Happy shakes his shoulder as Tony pries his eyes open, the bright morning sunlight streaming into the atrium absolutely blinding.
“He’ll have a headache, sure, but the Other Guy usually bears the brunt of the bad stuff,” Tony explains as he squints in the bright sunlight, looking around.  “Whoever our guardian angel is, he or she is a hell of a shot.”
alive,” Jan greets him dryly, with the type of attitude Steve only wishes he could muster. Instead, he stands there, silent and staring, as Tony ambles into the room. Tony's gaze drifts over Steve with barely discernible interest, like a man window shopping for something he doesn't really need. Those beautiful brown eyes of his don't have that usual spark, his expression dimmed.
“Hey yourself.”  Tony replies. He presses his hand to the mattress as if testing the springs, and then he shrugs a little, waiting for Steve to ask him why he’s here, tell him to get out,
“I guess I…” He closes his eyes tightly, trying to block everything else out so he can concentrate on finding the right words. “It’s not that I thought you were lying,
“Well, I never needed a flashlight,” Tony says, smirking.  “But it really made getting to sleep a bitch.”
He even makes Steve turn around, checks out the way the jeans snugly fit his ass, and then declares the pair the winner.  The casual yet over-the-top ogling seems to push the tension away, convincing Steve that Tony’s jokingly pushing his buttons, because Steve just rolls his eyes at Tony and tells him he’s impossible.
He ignores Pepper and storms into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him so hard that it knocks one of the framed artworks off the wall. It hits the floor with a satisfying crash of glass.
It had been around midnight when he came down to the kitchen for something to drink; he’d found the idea of returning to his room unbearable.  In truth, he’d been half-hoping to find Tony awake too, but he’s happily ensconced in the master suite with Pepper.  As well he should be.  Steve can’t begrudge the man that.
Steve feels Loki’s eyes on him like he would a hand on his face and he has to turn away from Loki’s intense stare.
Nothing comes back that isn’t about Steve Rogers and it feels as much a burden as it does a blessing.
Old-fashioned, virtuous Steve, standing here in his foyer with his pants around his ankles with one of Tony’s hands gently fondling him between his legs, another jerking his cock, and Tony’s tongue licking at his weeping slit.  It’s downright pornographic and Tony’s sure he’ll be going to hell for corrupting Captain America.
“Well, let’s hope the twenty-first century can knock that out of him.  Being polite gets you nowhere.”
“We’re just looking,” Steve hedges, but Clint has already grabbed the paper from him, crumpled it up, and tossed it in a nearby trashcan.
He closes his eyes, thinking of his last night in New York, reflections of neon lights streaking and shimmering over wet pavement, wind whipping down the sidewalk and around street corners.
“If you think that was poetry, Rogers, I think I’m beginning to understand the state of your love life.”
He wonders at what point faithfulness becomes mere semantics, an arbitrary line drawn in the sand.   Thoughts are thoughts and actions are actions, and there
He tilts back slightly, gaze inadvertently moving toward the ceiling.  He wonders if Tony’s upstairs now, or if he’s still down in the lab.  The ache he feels when he thinks of Tony isn’t physical.
“Hollywood heathens! This is not how one treats genius!” Then Lensherr storms out of the soundstage, shoulder bumping a rack of C-stands as he goes.
He almost asks why Tony would ever risk that, why he would want another man to tell his boyfriend that he’s in love with him, but he luckily realizes the arrogance of it before the question makes it out.
There’s no hard copy file with a dossier. There’s no folder on a laptop with images and lists and other data. But he collects it just the same, keeps it stored in his mind. It’s the only thing that’s organized in the muddle. The rest of his thoughts and feelings are an amorphous mess, a tangled mass of sharp objects and dangling threads.
“Your father’s film collection. The negatives and prints from his wartime work?” Tony knows what she means, but he keeps his face blank, feigning disinterest.  He folds his arms behind his head, leaning back and pretending to stifle a yawn. “The
“As you’d expect.”  He rubs his face, feeling tired.  “I awkwardly vomited out inappropriate things until the Captain just as awkwardly made his excuses and beat tail outta here.”
.” Tony hangs up, shaking his head to himself and tossing the phone aside as he flops down across one of the long banks of leather seats along the side of the cabin.
“What’s the point, indeed. Do your other bosses encourage this recklessness?” Tony asks, gesturing to the work that Bruce has spread out along the table. “They just give you their cameras to do with as you please?”
Tony doesn’t know what he dreads more: the dreams or the nightmares.  It’s a crushing disappointment when he wakes to remember his Iron Man days are done.
There’s noise behind him as a canister is uncapped and the film loaded, looped and fed through the gate to the uptake.
Tony half-wishes Steve would apply that tone to him, and order him to get his shit together.  Something about the way his voice shifts into Captain mode is just so damn effective.
He’s so earnest that Tony’s natural instinct is to poke fun, and he steps in close, patting the center of Steve’s chest, right where the star of his uniform usually lays.
“Clint, take position on the top floor, see if you can get a good angle.  Get as many tranq arrows in him as you can.  It won’t knock him out but maybe it will slow him down.”
“You’re not going to believe me, but he started it.”  Tony replies and Pepper shakes her head, turns to go back inside.
“I didn’t know you were expecting anything,” Steve answers honestly, having thought until just minutes ago that any romantic feelings between them were wholly one-sided.  Tony’s whole body stiffens slightly at Steve’s words, but before Steve can ask what he said wrong, Tony’s taking a step back, grabbing Steve’s hand, and leading the way back toward the bright, flashing neon lights of the amusement park.
“Ok, so if it’s not your father that’s the problem, and the guy is apparently some kind of Adonis –”
“I drive past this beach all the time, but I’ve never been down here.” Tony focuses out toward the water once more, but not before sneaking another look at Steve. He shoves his hands in his pockets and rocks back a little on his heels. “This is a little out of the way for you, isn’t it?”
“Cap.”  Tony musters up a bright smile and a bit of manic energy, pushing away painful thoughts of Steve and Natasha in compromising positions.  “You’re here!”
Steve can’t think of what to say so he just stares back at Tony, like maybe if he looks long enough he’ll be able to discern why things are so different between them when he hasn’t been awake for
He’s glad that Pepper and Tony have remained amicable, as he knows that SI demands much of both their time.   Steve’s not exactly jealous, but any hours Tony spends with her always pass by slower than they should.  Perhaps Pepper thought that including him would help.
“Including the romantic ones?” It’s a shot in the dark, something he’s been wondering about for awhile, and he figures now is as good a time as any to find out for sure.
“Didn’t much like my parents either, so I don’t know who or what else to swear on.” He closes the space between them, reaching over and running a finger down Steve’s wrist, the action blocked from the street view by the balusters of the railing. He dances his fingers against Steve’s lightly, and when Steve doesn’t stop him, he tangles their hands together. “I’m sorry I screwed up.”
“I’ll have to think about the deal,” Steve states, and feels Tony tense in his hold. He reaches up to cup the side of Tony’s face reassuringly. “But I don’t have to think about us. All I need’s a pen, and I’ll sign right now on the dotted line.”
“Everything’s fine,” Tony waves him off, pushing past him through the doorway and inviting himself inside.  His shoes click on the hardwood floor.  He glances around, taking in his surroundings quickly.  It doesn’t take long; Steve’s entire place is the size of his childhood playroom.  It smells incredibly clean yet musty, like age is clinging to the wallpaper and can’t really be washed away no matter how many times Steve gives everything a fine military polish.  The rooms are sparse and tidy, bordering on bare.  There’s little furniture, all of it battered but sturdy, handcrafted.  Not the kind of cheap modern furniture put together on the quick; more like furniture bought at an estate sale.
“It’s a bit more complicated than that, but yeah, for all intents and purposes that’s about right.  Repaired the old ticker too,” Tony replies, tapping his fingers against the center of his chest where that strange blue light used to be.
“Very.” Bucky agrees, setting his work bag down on the couch and tossing his suit coat over it. Steve winces, wishing Bucky would be less messy and informal when they have company, but Bucky doesn’t seem to notice or care. “And what are we having for dinner,
“Eh, you’re right.  Thor’s an I can eat fifty eggs kinda guy, I doubt he’d be daunted.”  Tony gets up too, tossing his tablet rather carelessly back onto the bed.  He picks up his suit coat from the back of the nearest armchair and slides it on, fixing his collar.  “So, what do you feel like?  Steak?  Lobster? Both?”
Bucky must have been close by enough to hear the timid knock because he opens the door almost immediately. He must have been waiting. The sight of him takes Steve’s breath away, reminding him exactly why he’s here.
“Women like Pepper use Ms. instead of Miss now, and dame isn’t exactly PC either,” Tony corrects.  “But yes, I’m still wondering what in god’s name she’s doing with someone like me.”
“We’ll get you cleaned up and into some fresh clothes – I got more of those cheap-ass pajamas you like, the t-shirt jersey cotton ones –”
, Tony thinks. He puts it into his kiss, too frightened to say it aloud. He’s angry with himself for nearly messing this up. He could have had Steve in his own bed tonight, could have laid him out and kissed every inch of him, spent all night long making him fall apart underneath his lips and his hands, felt him inside his body.
“What I should have asked but was always too chicken shit to say, was: were you in love with Bucky?”
Tony pops two aspirin and finishes the last dregs of coffee. Then he leans his head back and closes his eyes behind his sunglasses, hoping to forget the rest of the world for at least the length of this drive.
“Speaking of Italians…” Tony smiles nervously.  Pepper’s smile is more grim and determined, if smiles can be such things.
Without a word, he walks to the wall and pulls the plug out of the socket.   The machine whirs down to a pitiful stop.
“Well, these days it’s getting harder and harder to lock the good ones down under contract. I’ve even been hearing whispers of back-end deals.” Those last three words trip off Tony’s tongue knowingly. “Stark Pictures would like to protect its potential…assets.”
It’s strange, because the Avengers have been a team without him for much longer than he was ever with them, but it still feels wrong whenever they leave him behind.  He itches for his suit of armor.
“It’s you.” Steve doesn’t sound like he really believes it. Bucky relaxes into the gentle hand that comes to the side of his face.
“Really. God, why?” He turns fully in his seat, screwing his face up in puzzlement. Coulson leans forward, resting his elbows on the chair back in front of him.
Steve’s bewildered now, and it begins to feel like it used to, before Colorado, before Vegas, before everything.  Steve’s perplexed, and he’s pissed off, and no one almost kissed anybody.
“I figured the view of the park would appeal to your artistic sensibilities.”  He must look surprised, because Tony gives him another shrug, rubbing the back of his own neck as he continues.  “Dad used to say you were always doodling.”
He lets his fingers drift down the sharp line of Steve’s sternum, feeling the notches of bone under Steve’s skin. He’s so fragile, Tony was almost afraid to touch him their first night in bed like this, terrified he’d fall apart under his hands.
“And why the hell not?”  Tony sounds frustrated and Steve doesn’t even get why.  This isn’t his problem and it’s none of his business.
“Before doing that portrait, you should clarify that it’s a ‘clothes-on’ kinda likeness, Cap.  I might get jealous if you’re staring for hours at a naked Thor.”  Tony leans in, angling in front of him to get a look at what Steve’s carving.  Steve turns the pumpkin a little so Tony can get a better view.
“I don’t get it – what is it that you’re you scared of? It’s not just about someone finding out you like my dick, I know that much.” Despite himself, Steve’s cheeks flush at Tony’s crude attitude. “You were against this whole idea before we ever slept together.”
His relationship with Bucky, whatever it had or hadn’t been, was conducted in private and never openly acknowledged between them – a barely-kept secret but a secret nonetheless.  While Tony had been all right with what happened at Coney Island, when they weren’t under anyone’s watchful eyes, Steve’s not sure what to do now.  So he’s been following Tony’s lead, afraid to do much else.
that just happened.”  Tony’s challenging, somber mood has been split wide open; he’s giddy with glee now.  “You were…and suddenly, you weren’t, you were gone, you were-“ He makes a whooshing, splashing noise, accompanied by a visual demonstration with his hands to show the explosion of water.
“I know.”  Then they’re kissing. New York continues to pass by the large plate glass window in a waterlogged blur of trench coats and black umbrellas, and the rest of the café becomes nothing more than warm light and a murmur of chatter and clinking dishes.
“Banner’s on seventeen.  Can you get him back to the tower safely?” Clint doesn’t wait for Tony to acquiesce before he and Natasha drag Barnes towards the door.  Natasha pauses a moment as they pass.
“Definitely.”  Tony agrees, reaching out and chucking Steve on the chin.  Steve laughs a little, pushing his hand away.
“Yes, today.”  Steve remains silent, glancing up at him but still seeming lost. “Today…you know…” Tony looks at the date on yesterday’s Times because he doesn’t actually know the date himself.  “Monday, March 4, 2013?  You might be able to keep better track of time if you went to bed once in awhile.”
“So…You and Bucky…” Tony trails off, knowing Steve will get his gist. Steve turns his face toward him, confused for only a moment.
“Good.”  Tony grabs his water and storms out, leaving Steve’s old best friend, lover, what the hell ever, behind.
“Guessing this Mr. Adams has quite the beard?”  Steve takes the razor from Tony with an arched eyebrow and a smile.  He tears open the difficult plastic packaging like it was tissue paper and turns on the sink, fingers swishing through the stream of water to feel its temperature.  He lets it run as Tony hands over the can of shaving cream.
“You’ll figure it out,” she snaps at Tony, then turns to Steve.  “I’ll grab you some decent clothes and meet you both downstairs.”
Steve really is beautiful, for lack of a less corny word.  He’s wearing dark, broken in jeans and one of those faded grey t-shirts that accentuate his bulging muscles, but it’s the bare feet and slightly mussed hair that do Tony in.  He looks
“Like a black hole.” Pepper drains her glass, trading it for a new one as a server passes by with a silver tray.  Steve can’t tell if she’s upset or bored, but he doesn’t know what to do about either.  He just knows he doesn’t agree with her, not about Tony being a black hole.
Steve crosses his arms over his chest and manages a terse nod, feeling oddly wounded by Clint’s words.  Rationally, he’s aware they’re not a pointed exclusion, but it feels like he’s been barred from everything that matters.
“JARVIS, how about something that doesn’t make my ears bleed.”  The next tune is one Steve doesn’t recognize, but it makes Tony pull out his phone and hit the off switch with a violent shudder.  “Aerosmith?  Christ, JARVIS, I wonder about you sometimes.”  He fiddles around for a minute, then presses a final button and then sets the phone aside on one of the end tables.
“Seriously!  What the hell can I do?  I’ve been sitting here running data and comparing timelines and using this incomplete bullshit rundown on the Red Room’s activities to try and figure out
Selznick came up through the ranks at RKO, MGM, and Paramount, and had more than proved his chops by the time he went independent. He was a movie man, not an imposter, an invader. And studio heads still resisted, still gave him trouble.
“I apologize, that sounded bitter.  I’m really not.” Her voice turns lighter now, less dry, and Steve doesn’t know her well enough yet to know if her small smile is real or forced.  “I always lean a little too heavy on the sarcasm where Tony’s concerned.”
“If this is a dream I’m going to cry when I wake up,” Tony mumbles half to himself, half to Steve, kicking off his shoes before they both step out of their pants and fumble toward Steve’s bedroom.
hardly seems polite. I’ll have to talk to the PAs about the proper way to fetch the talent.” Tony’s laugh is weak. He runs a hand through his hair, and Steve unconsciously mirrors him, rubbing the back of his own head.
“It’s ‘Steve’, for you now?” His eyebrow lifts higher.  He may refer to Cap as Steve sometimes in his head, but he usually doesn’t get that familiar out loud, and he hardly expected Natasha to either.  “Okay, so are you going to fill me in on what went down over the past few months or is this just something I have to go along with?”
He hangs up the robe on the back of the door and lets the sheet drop to the tile, cool air hitting his naked skin. He pulls aside the shower curtain a bit too sharply, the metal rings screeching against the rod. His nerves haven’t settled yet, clearly.
“Steve was just on his way out.  Pepper, would you mind walking him down?”  Tony bats his eyelashes once at her, looking as innocent as possible.  Pepper and Steve both look at him with surprisingly similar expressions that call bullshit.
Dissatisfied, he tosses it back onto the pile and picks up a couple of empty test tubes instead, rolling them between his palms.  Bruce glances at him warily.
“Yeah…I have a feeling Natasha hasn’t been drunk since she was twelve.  At least.”  Tony chuckles, pointing at Steve knowingly.  “She certainly knew how to work you.”  He lifts his phone out of his pocket and hits a few buttons on screen.  “I’d like to know how they got JARVIS to notify me that the communal kitchen was on fire, though.  That’s a pretty neat trick considering it’s my own highly classified programming.  It had to have been Bruce.  Quite the duplicitous gang of friends we’ve got.”
“So.  What are you even doing?”  Tony asks, well aware he sounds accusatory and combatant right off the bat.
“If there’s one thing you’re not lacking, it’s charm, Tony.” Steve’s voice is fond, but Tony hears the underlying subtext. Steve has no outwardly apparent, logical reason to jet off to New York on a moment’s notice. He won’t be coming.
The door sticks and he has to put his shoulder into it to get it open.  The room smells of bleach and air conditioner fluid and it’s dark, save for the faint blue glow of his arc reactor and the sliver of warm yellow light that’s seeping from the bathroom door.  It’s cracked open about an inch to let steam escape.
“Tone, I gotta go, but try to calm yourself the hell down.  You sound nuts and you gotta be driving poor Pepper crazy.”
“Well, you shouldn’t.  If Bruce were here right now, he’d back me up.”  The train jostles as it rises slightly, air pressure changing as it finishes going under the East River and Tony slips his hands downward to steady himself, palms warm against Steve’s stomach through his thin Kill Rock Stars t-shirt.  Steve looks down, vaguely amused, as Tony’s voice trails off, finger tracing down the centerline of his ab muscles.  “Okay.
Peter turns this all over in his mind, wondering if all the turmoil between the Avengers during the past two years had really been the result of a lovers’ quarrel. He can’t believe that Tony and Steve would risk that, let that all happen, just because they broke up.
“It’s there, in the penal code, somewhere.  I could look it up, but I’m too busy thinking about the various things we could get up to like this.”  Tony wriggles suggestively but only succeeds in making Steve laugh and squirm underneath him.
