No, Loki's hesitancy reminded him more of a child in an orphanage or one found in a war zone. What little he knew about Loki from gathered knowledge here and there, he supposed both of those things where in a way true – at least if the things trickled down through the grapevine where to be believed.
Stark nodded gently prying Steve’s hands from his shirt and placing the larger mans palm flat over his heart. “It’s me Steve, alive and…for the most part well.”
Tony held him so tight, burring his face in Steve’s neck just breathing him in. He was there, he was really there, really alive. Maybe that hurt all the more, because now it hit the inventor… all the hell he had been through. All the hell their family had been through. He wanted to scream or cry - mostly he wanted to wrap his hands around Fury’s neck.
Howard nodded and folded his hands, “I see, then you have never seen a miracle nor known magic.” The old man had a bittersweet smile as his mind played over images of his younger self and new bride, the happiness of those early days and the life within her. The birth of his son and then… then nothing but horror and pain. The bitter taste of being robbed of his soul and every last ounce of joy until there was nothing left but a man filled with wrath and fueled by bottled spirits. “When you are granted a mere glimpse of heaven only to have it taken away… then you will know what sorrow genuinely tastes like.”
Maybe even six if there was an accident- and wasn't that just awful that he was sitting her hoping for a fender bender or a damn pile up just to get some time to huddle alone in a corner and scream.
"Son we can talk when you come back down. Also I peeked in your room." Steve continued with an exasperated sigh, " hun I know you're going to be moving in with Wade when He comes back but we've talked about this. As long As you're under our roof I expect you to keep that room clean."
Peter groaned and went cutely limp over his omega, burrowing his face in Steve’s chest with a mumble.”
“Here it is baby, fuck…fuck here it comes…” Tony groaned slamming his hips up, the feeling was blinding and perfect and the only thing he could think was ‘claim claim CLAIM’. Pulling Steve’s head back by the hair and sinking his teeth into the gland. The omega shouted and came untouched.
The elderly man looked up with a smile. “Because, before there was no one capable of protecting Captain America…and now there is.” Rockwell stated simply as the elevator doors opened to ground level once again. The old man stepped out and tipped his head to the now stunned Tony. “Enjoy your day Mr. Stark”
And like that the moment was gone, round of applause ladies and gents for the elegant tact of Tony Stark.
Loki had smiled then so freely, back before time had taken that from him. Slowly turning the sweet, sensitive, happy boy into a bitter, broken man.
Loki shivered as he rested his forehead against the cold metal door, knowing he deserved every bit of suffering. He just didn't want it.
Surprisingly, there wasn't a push back to his words. If anything it was like the other team members damn near rolled over. Then it occurred to him the entire stink he was kicking up right now and the gravel in his voice. “Damn it....”
Steve looked over the papers and tried to force a smile, he had been trying for months to get into the army. They wouldn’t even let him into the recruitment office most times. He was an omega; therefore, not allowed to serve. Not to mention he was small and sickly, even when he was able to mask his scent he couldn’t pass the physical. “Hey that’s…great…really swell.”
“Loki wait!” The mutant omega  followed behind him only stopping once to wave to an older student to please gather up the little ones once their recess was over and take them to the canteen.
Steve woke up to a lie, for the first few seconds he even thought that maybe he was dead. It would have made sense to be dead, after all he dropped that plane filled with bombs into the water … it was the last thing he remembered. In truth if he tried a little harder, he might remember more but that was something he didn’t want to touch now. More than likely not ever. Because if Steve closed his eyes and tired he might remember the feel of water flooding his mouth and burning in his lungs as it strangled the life out of him.
The words hung in the air like an ominous web, home to some jet-black creature with piercing fangs threatening to eat him alive. IT was a nightmare, one he couldn't even wake from to escape the stabbing aching in his chest. Howard and Maria had been so happy; everything had been perfect. It made no sense that a thing like this should happen. What had he done? Why her?
So perhaps Loki had grown lax on his stance then? Maybe just no noticeable magic among mortals. What they won't know won't hurt them.
May interjected from her fallback position keeping Hydra away from the jet. “Let's give him a chance Daisy, There is a lot more at play here. We don't know what Loki is feeling through his bond with Barnes and getting in front of him might be more trouble than it's worth.”
Jemma shook her head, “No, my mate Leo … he is very sweet but the last few years have been Difficult, shortly before we bonded he was injured during a mission. He is getting better though, maybe in a year or two we may talk about it.”
The ravenette seated on the sofa hadn't acknowledged his entrance but hadn't outright told him to leave - so Bruce was going to call this a win. “I brought some tea. It's an oolong blend with cinnamon; I thought you might like it. Bucky says you have quite the tea collection back home.”
For once, Barton was faster. Crossing the room and pulling his omega into a breath-stealing kiss. When they parted, he brushed his fingertips back through the silverette hair. “We should get started then.”
In those days we we're ships sailing in the night, you had your life..your mission. I watched you from a far as much as I could. It wasn't enough and i knew the risks you took.
How long had it been since Loki genuinely felt this whole as a person? This protected? The contentment in that private moment was almost terrifying.
The idea wormed into Steve’s head…What would it be like to kiss Tony? He quickly dismissed it. “We won.”
Maybe now he could find some peace, maybe it would be enough. Tony pulled up a photo from the memory system, looking at the image with a painful throbbing in his chest. It was just after they adopted Peter, they had the photos made and for some reason this had been Steve’s favorite. It was black and white with only subtle touched of color. The blue of Steve’s shirt, blue light of the reactor and the soft blue blanket wrapped around their son.  He could never go back to that; he didn’t deserve to hold his son when his hands were stained in blood.
Other days he would just sit on the bed staring out at the alley way between the tenement buildings, occasionally one of the tom cats would climb the fire escape and he would pet the wayward creature, they didn’t have milk most days but he would offer the felines water on the hot summer days. Wishing he could be outside like other boys his age, unfortunately his health prevented him from doing much aside from the fanciful lines gleaned  from his pencil.
Steve did not think Tony Stark was an exceptional anything when he first met him. Stark was nothing like his father. Howard, he remembered Howard, they had been friends, Howard while a little off putting sometimes was enthusiast and brilliant. Howard was… he was kind to him even knowing what he was. Peggy used to poke fun at them and say Howard was just smitten, Steve didn’t think to though. That was the man Steve knew, and while he could see that same sparkle in Tony’s eyes, it came off more as arrogance.
Barnes pauses in front of him, probably to defend him, how kind of him to do so even now. Loki doesn't want that kindness though. He’s angry and sick to his stomach.
Steve fumbled with the paper until Daddy helped him. The little gasped looking down at his present, tears gathering in the corners of his eyes as he lifted the bear up. It wore a blue double buttoned jacked and a little black mask. The little one hugged it to his chest. "Bucky bear..."
“That's not what I want!” Tony found himself shouting at nothing. Screaming and pulling his hair. His panic somehow shaken by a sudden banging on the shop doors.
“Much appreciated my love.” Loki spoke softly and leaned into his Alpha for comfort. “I think, I wish to focus our efforts on finding a child who needs us rather than one of our own blood. I know that Bruce said this could pass and if by rare chance one day we are so endowed by the Norns, then I will accept it gladly.”The omega looked up and traced a slender finger along his mates jaw.“However, I will not allow this pain to snatch me away from you again. Nor ferry me from the family we make.”
At the end of their little getaway Steve would tell Tony how much the little gesture meant, and how much he loved him for it. This thing between them was different but it was solid. Tony could not have cared less what anyone might say because he felt like he had everything he'd ever wanted in Steve, a partner, a lover, a friend, and a sweet baby that needed him.
The omega turned his back and brushed away the traitorous tears. “Oh it's nothing dear heart, just something in my eye.”
Arriving at the tower, they headed up to the common floor – surprised to find the room less occupied than normal. In fact, the only people there at present were Steve and Loki.
Steve enjoyed being seen as an equal, having a place to feel like he belonged. Even if it meant hiding a secret from his new friend. In over 70 years it had not been an issue, no one needed to know he was a genetic anomaly because of the serum. For all Tony knew he was an Alpha and Steve wanted to keep it that way. He didn’t want to lose this fragile friendship because he was a freak. Because at the end of the day Tony had been right when he said everything Steve was came out of a bottle, that he was a lab rat. Sometimes that weighed on Steve, that he could never be honest. Never tell the alpha how difficult being near him was because still in his heart of hearts Steve was become attached in a way that he knew he shouldn’t.
Like the curve of the Captains lips and the shape of his jaw, how young and innocent he looked laying there all scraped and bandaged. Not to mention his hands, Tony didn’t even realize he had been reaching out until his fingertips brushed over Steve ruined knuckles. He imagined they must have looked horrible hours ago.
It was a few days later when Steve decided to tell the rest of the team, or the team minus Thor who was still in Asgard.
Alexander played well the part of devoted husband, caring for his ailing wife day in and day out. He mourned her loss when she passed not six months after her mysterious sickness began. Pierce stood there in the churchyard with his sons, looking the entire world as a bereaved man lying to rest his beloved. Yet, behind closed doors Alexander showed his true face.
The farther Loki tried to go the more persistent Wagner proved to be. “Why? Why are you doing this?” He said finally, turning around to confront the other once they were out of student earshot. “Do I appear to require pity from you? I can assure you that whatever mission of good faith you think you are on it is both unneeded and unwanted.”
Tony was able to prefect it and was holding it as a last resort. He knew the moment Mallen was able to overpower the suit it was going to end this way. There was to much to risk, it was either get the competitive edge on this psycho or both Barnes and he die.
“I know baby. That's not your fault. But you can get through this, just think about how far you've come and all that you lived through to get here.”
“That what you really come out here to say big guy or did my manly prowess just change your mind?”  Tony smiled the lines around his eyes crinkling pleasantly and Steve felt that same stutter in his heart.
The man in question sprung up flipping form the couch with an ungraceful thump. “Damn it Pep! Can’t you see me wallowing here? Can a man not mope in peace!”
Steve got the shield up and dug his feet into the snow. Still the blast forced him back a good 8 feet. “Damn it Stark!”
Steve sat alone just soaking up the silence for a while, he would need to get used to this. He was going to have to leave the tower and find a place of his own. Someplace far enough that he wouldn’t be tempted to see Tony again, or the media wouldn’t find out about the billionaires illegitimate child. Maybe he could go back to DC, find a new place and a day job. He could ask Sam, the alpha was nice enough.
In the workshop, things were easier to digest. Tony could lose himself in the work, it had always been that way. When life became to hard, or things at Stark Industries was too frustrating. He could always count on the workshop to take his mind to a kinder more ordered place. Building and dismantling bits of machinery or working on circuits was like therapy. It was easy to understand and there was also that element of discovery. The amazing feeling when he made something faster, smaller, or more efficient.
Bullets flew past and Steve rushed forward, the shield clanging off walls and enemies.  He rounded a stair well and saw it, a flash of a long dark coat and red skin.  His blood boiled and jaw clenched running after the villain from his past.  Steve could hear a roar from outside the compound and a loud boom as an exterior wall no doubt met the fists of an angry Hulk.
Rogers nodded, he could work with that. Tony could come back from this physically- he knew that, mentally…well Steve would be there for that no matter how long it took. “Tones, I’m gonna put a cool rag on the back of your neck ok? It’s just me baby; we’re in the quinjet and were going home.”
We meet people in this life who are born into darkness by no fault of their own. They are handed a legacy and succumb to that darkness no matter how hard they fight to be unlike it. Among them are those who can crawl out of their circumstance and become leaders and saviors. Others who failed and yet through that failure learned that there is more to life that what you are granted at the start. Such a extraordinary gift it is to find redemption, to stand on the precipice and say - “ No more”. Those we make a conscious effort to change, though the road may be arduous and fraught with slings and arrows, survive.
It wasn't just James who had noticed, everyone had seen the broken once prince passing through the halls.
“You what?” Tony just thought his brain broke, was Steve seriously confessing feelings for him. If that didn’t just make him feel like shit, he didn’t think anything else could. “Steve, I need you to calm down for me. Ok can you do that for me honey.” Did he just call Steve honey…damn those all American doe eyes…damn them right to hell.
He thought of going down to the workshop but did not want to be a distraction. In addition, he was tired, Steve did not feel tired often but when he did, it hit him hard. This was no exception, he felt worn down to the bone for some reason. Therefore, the soldier had climbed in bed alone and slipped off to sleep. It wasn’t until the wee hours before dawn that Steve’s eyes flickered open again. He was warm so he pushed back the covers; it was more than just a slight rise in surface temperature however, he felt like this was coming from inside. Like the fevers of illness from his youth, the ones that left him drenched in sweat and delirious while his mother sat by his bedside praying for him to live.
Yet even when Loki was away, he heard the whispers, people looking at him so sorrowfully. The quiet words of Amora’s betrayal and how sad it was that Loki would have to raise a child alone. Others spoke viciously of the prince for mating with such an unsavory siren and tainting the king’s bloodlines with his bastard. Loki would wrinkle his nose wanting terribly to lash out, to tell everyone that that thing suckling at a servant girl’s breast was no blood of his.
The day the war ended, Steve tore the Captain’s star from his lapel and threw it into the ocean. After all of the fighting, all of the death, everything he had lost. It all came down to a bunch of old men sitting around a table somewhere and just…. agreeing to disagree. Some sort of understanding of peace that made the years he spent seem trivial.
“No Tony, no you’re going to listen even if the truth hurts. I am leaving your son with you tonight because he needs his father, and you are going to sober the hell up and take him to the park and spend time with him tomorrow instead of hiding away in that damn lab or going off slaughtering people and trying to get yourself killed!”
Tony struggled up to his feet and out of the scattered remands of his suit. “I get that bird brain I need to get Jarvis to tell Steve I’m fine because he was watching the news before I went for that little swim.”
Flexing his fingers, the burn eases to a dull hum, he breathes in and the air has never tasted cleaner in decades. How could anyone live with out this?
“Yeah…I’m hungry too.” Steve groaned, he didn’t even care knowing what a mess the alpha had made of him. “n’sleepy.”
"Alright...I'll go with you." Perhaps agreeing to this was a fools errand, but even if he could feel that once more. Even in fleeting... even unreciprocated. Maybe there was something left after all.
Thinking about it now he realizes how natural it was, the situation had gone ass over elbows so fast that Loki must have felt it. If their roles had been revered there would have been nothing to keep him from finding his lover and protecting him. James lets the guilt sink in, Loki was only like that because of him, only felt it because he couldn't hold it back.
AN: Ok I know in the comics/films Extremis is a 'days long process' but for the function of this story- I'm speeding this up. I hope that's cool with y'all, if it's not....well I don't care lol smile and have a coke cause that's how this shit is playin out today. Additionally, I want to apologize for the gaps between posting. There has been a lot going down in my personal life and sometimes it just sucks the life out of me. In unrelated news, for any of you Harry Potter fans out there. I have started a HP one-shot book. Not going to lie it isn't great as I have never written for that fandom before. I don't know all the tiny details some super fans of that series may know. However, I do have love for the world and it's characters so I have been giving it a go. If I get a lot of positive feedback on it there may be a full length fic. Probably Snupin Ship ans Severitus .  There is also some possibility of a Marvel HP crossover GammaFrost Fic. So keep your eyes peeled for that. Ok, enough of my yammering on, on with the story!
The pair continued up to the common floor where they found much of the team seated as the pups played in the center of the room. However, Loki was missing from the social gathering.
Steve also had the added sadness of being a part of ‘the last great generation’ but having to watch all his contemporaries fade away and die. While he stayed behind - ‘the man out of time’ as Loki had once called him.
Tony was 12 years old when he heard those words, it was the first time his father ever looked proud of him for absolutely anything. It wasn’t even as if it was something he had done, it was just genes and hormones that just so happened to chemically balance one way over others.  Yet Howard was grinning from ear to ear as if his boy had just reinvented the wheel. It made Tony wonder what would have happened if it had not turned out that way. Would he have been seen as inferior? He was still clever, smarter than most kids his age in-fact. What did it matter how he fit into the grand biological scheme? That was the first time Tony really understood how unfair life really was.
Phil pinched the bridge of his nose and walked down the hall, oh yeah Clint totally did what he was told. The coats where all dangling from arrows in the drywall. Their property owner was going to love that.  Oh and look at that bookcase it matches. Shelves balanced on arrows, on guess at what the guest bath looked like.
“Calm down let me just go see if their awake ok? Why don’t we turn on your cartoons and wait?” Bruce spoke trying to calm down a likely fidgeting child.
Would Tony kick him out of the tower when they got back?  Had all that sweetness earlier just been a mask for the anger, maybe after having time to think it over - what Bucky had done to Howard and Maria, the fact that Steve knew.
The initial excuse had been because Steve had to go out for a mission and Tony could not sleep alone. Then there was more to it though, the fact Steve knew there were things Bucky was going to have to do when he was away. Things he worried Tony wouldn't be ok with because despite how much help Bucky was everyday - Steve was the one who bathed and dressed Tony.
Loki approached as if the bundle would turn to flame. “My son?” Amora had not looked about to birth when he had last seen her. So then how, before he could question or analyze however; Thor was filling his arms with a tiny warm body. Loki found himself frozen in place looking down at the baby with red and gold scales. The coloration was a hind of his own bits of gold and similar in pattern, the shape of the long delicate fins was all Amora. The red seemed a more vibrant than the hints in her own mostly olive colored tail.
Tony turned to see Peter standing at the door, the inventor glared at the ceiling a moment - Jarvis should have warned him.
Brief, uncomplicated and if not followed...well- nothing actually happened unless you account for a royal puppy face from the over dramatic Alpha.
Stepping out of the shower the solider heard the soft playing of the piano in the foyer. Curiosity piqued he pulled on a pair of shorts and headed down the hallway. The nursery was empty, not that he thought Tony would ever leave peter alone. This though…he hadn’t expected.
He looked over magazine articles over the years- the commandos as they passed one by one. Interviews Howard had given, Steve even found a video of a very young Tony at one of his fathers expos.
Steve sat up in the darkness as the piercing pain made him sweat and ground his teethe. Something was very wrong; he groped through the darkened to try to switch on the bedside lamp.  When the gold light flooded the bedroom, Steve looked down in horror at the red soaked sheets. “Oh god… oh no. . .No…”
It's a quiet Sunday morning when Steve finds Loki sitting alone in the common room. Finding the ravenette gazing out into the fogy morning isn't particularly new. Even so, as the days drag on it's not hard to see the once regal looking man change. Like a shroud of gray settled over the omegas soul and drank up all the color. Loki appeared so ill that it was heartbreaking.
Pepper smiled when the melody flouting through the workshop met her ears. It was one she added to Steve’s Play list, clearly, Tony wasn’t fooling anyone by listing to something so uncharacteristically not him. She slipped off her shoes and tip toed inside, Jarvis in silent agreement had not alerted his creator to the woman’s presence. Clearly, the AI had had enough of this foolishness as well.
While working with the mutant children Loki had come to see that even those that the public at large saw as 'cast offs', still had a community. Not all hope was lost because of the color of skin or designation. When doors closed because of the X-gene, windows opened in the form of fervent hope for a brighter tomorrow. Loki had helped a number of frighten children with talents similar to some of his own and felt...completed. When had he forgotten that?
When Tony entered the room, he noticed someone else was already taking vigil by the Captain’s bedside. Call it instinct but the engineer pulled his shoulders back and stood a little taller in front of the other alpha.
Loki scoffed. “I am not a mortal creature agent, I doubt very much any would have proper knowledge to tend to me. As for James, I do not wish to worry him, he had enough on his mind with Shield's demands on his time. To add to his already monumental tasks with additional strife of my own would be a true lack of care on my part.”
Steve’s cheeks flushed and he couldn’t meet the alpha’s eye, thankfully, Tony knew and smiled. “If you want to, anything you want  honey.”
It seemed like too elegant of a term, it made him think of Natasha with her long slender limbs and deadly grace.
Meanwhile, the director of shield was none to happy to hear about what was going on at the avengers tower.  Fury had been patient with Stark for far too long and knowing that the billion dollar burr in his ass was now housing an ex criminal and ex assassin (regardless if Barnes worked for Shield now or not).
“Tony…” Steve wrapped his arm around his alpha that night in bed, snuggling up to the inventors back.
Maria always believed in him, always said he could do anything with that big brain of his. Looking down at the tiny boy slumbering in the monstrous contraption before him, Howard vows to do whatever it takes to make sure Anthony lives.
Then came Peters very first science fair. First grade and man that kid was jazzed up for it. Maybe Tony was too...secretly..ok not so secretly. The two of them spent hours in the workshop working on plans and projects - spending waaaay more time than necessary on a 7yr olds homework.
“Siren…with…golden hair…she’s…so angry …” Tony groaned his head tossing back and forth. His whole body ached and screamed, like lying in a pile of prickly urchins.
He could hear the smile in her voice, Widow was one to plan for the worst and then compensate for the best. “What can I say, I’m sentimental.”
I wake up in Tony’s bed, I know because I have woken up here enough times before. Ma would be so disappointed. She raised me better than this but Stark is so damn persuasive and attractive. He reminds me of Clark Gable and I always had a thing for him. Weak excuse I know.
There was a time when he was broken too, after hydra weeks James ‘Bucky’ Barnes spent staring at walls.  He came out of it though, he came out and this was the life he found. He had to believe that Loki was going to come out the other side of this. He would be here waiting.
Thor: BROTHER ARE YOU NOT PLEASED WITH THE WHIMSICAL RETELLING OF YOUR COPULATION WITH THE STEED????
There was a brilliant blur of red hair as Natasha Romanov swung from one deck to the next, using her pistol and cutlass alike. She flew with ease around the mast - kicking other men from the narrow ledge as they attempted to board the ship. For a brief moment she had lost sight of the others but did not worry, her boys were smart. They were the elite among the ships sailors, a special group renowned for their prowess in battle both on land and sea. Natasha having earned her place among the very few women fighting on the battle fronts. Some among their enemies had taken to calling her ' Black widow'. Comparing the woman to the deadly female spider whose colors she often wore.
When Tony watched a man die, he could feel it to. Part of him said ‘that will make it enough.’  ‘I will feel like I have done some justice.’ It did not do that at all.
The omega summed the strength to pull away howerver. “Oh I'm sure you could sweetheart, but I'd rather safe all that.” Steve side steped with a smirk over his shoulder “After all, I was always taught to save my desert until after dinner. Good manners ya know?”
“What? Barton? No ‘that’s what she said?’ I’m disappointed in your lack of frat boy humor. Did someone take away your dartboard and make you all pouty?”
Once their food reached the table Bruce smiled and thanked their server and dug into his own dish with out issue, sipping water only occasionally while asking Loki if he had fun today.
The break came when one of the idiots made a call to their boss.  Apparently, ‘interrogation’ wasn’t going as well as they’d hope and they ‘didn’t know how much more the so called first avenger could take.’  Someone named ‘Corvus’ was ‘really putting the boots to the guy, it’s getting messy.’
“Tony no.” Steve wrapped his arms around his alpha. This was Tony, if anything this was more so the man he loved than he had seen in days. The stubborn alpha that always tried so hard to hide how badly he was hurting. “I should have been with you. Maybe if I had been there you wouldn't have needed Extremis. I let you down and I swore I would never do that.”
There had to be some sort sin the billionaire had committed (and there had been countless) to disserve this kind of fate.  “Please baby its ok.” He tried just as Steve started to hiccup and curl around his stomach between them.  “Come on sugar, its fine I’m not mad. I don’t care if you want to have dinner in the tub.”
“No… I …it is but a coincidence The Norns… they work in mysterious ways? How does the youngest son of Odin have such dark hair then! It…it means nothing!” She grew angry and desperate.
Steve smiled, preening a little under the appreciative eye of the Alpha. “You bringing me food for once. Now I’ve seen everything.”
They slowly made themselves out to be ‘the voice of the people’ when really they were gas lighting an entire country. ‘Trust me’ says the left hand of a right handed killer.
Male beta - boy parts, not that impressive tho.. again shy follower personalityMale Alpha --- yall know..come on now  Above average disco stick.
“Correct-o-mundo my metallic armed Buckaroo; she’s using this experiment to fuse human mater and electronic interface.”
The truth of it he was still the same kid standing shirtless in the line at the recruitment office. Glaring with stormy eyes just daring anyone to let their eyes linger too long on his thin chest and curved spine. Bucky used to describe him  as 10ft  man in a 5ft room. His friend would laugh and wrap an arm around his shoulders jesting about what a ‘firecracker’ Steve was.
Tony opened is eyes and felt himself sinking, Darcy was drifting limp in the water a tendril of red creeping into the water from her temple.
Unfortunately, he had other obligations that could mean life and death, not only for him, but for the world at large. Barnes had promised to keep an eye out for Stark and looked like he was about to make good on that, if the reports from SHIELD were anything to go by. The late night call had only confirmed the worst – Mallen had made a play and was able to shake the agents tailing him and his lackeys. A group of terrorists in the wind was never what you wanted to have on your hands. Of course no one had been able to station a group at AIM. Barnes wanted to kick himself for not going rouge on that one. They knew where Mallen was headed but still Fury insisted they would scoop up the threat after Mallen had obtained whatever he was trying to get from the pharmaceutical company. 'Two birds – one stone', yeah they see how well that worked.
Still, if she didn’t take it the outcome would be worse still. If she rejected him, Thor would hate her. Therefore, with a thin reluctant smile she took the damnable trinket.
Thor found him, that hadn't been the intention at all. Loki had intended a quiet exit into oblivion but then again there was his brother botching things up for him yet again.
Steve leaned back on the elevator walls, “Tony I’m not really in the mood. Not everyone thinks about that all the time. Can’t we just have a nice meal together with out one of us ending up on our knees.”
Tony wants to say he's not a soldier, wants to come back with any number of quick witty retorts, but all he has is static in place of words. Like rebooting a computer, his brain was just fuzz and colors while only the basic systems were online. What he wouldn’t give to tell Barnes that he doesn’t want to give up, he won’t give up. They just need a little more time.
Aiden James Barnes was healthy and happy, and he had the biggest most beautiful green eyes his father had ever seen.
Checking the power control for the building had Tony scratching his head yet again. Those unseen levels below the old meat processing plant were active, well one was active for climate control and the lower level space it self was receiving power. “Why corner yourself like that.” He asked no one. Truth be told Tony could guess why – Extremis.
For a time, the raven-haired prince entertained the notion that perhaps Amora had found a dead child and somehow necromancer them back to life using the gem as life conduit. He checked the little mer pup over daily for signs of decay, there was none. If anything the little one was flourishing. Anthony grew stronger every day and it hurt Loki even more. All of the baby’s gummy little smiles and reaching hands…they were a trick. To know that Amora never loved him, he was only a tool to get to Thor. To know that this child would never really be anything to him than a reminder of that false love.
Blue eyes shot up meeting the face of the former SHIELD director, Nick Fury.  As much as Steve hated to admit it he was glad to see his former boss that meant it had not been 70years.  It meant there was still a chance that everything was fine.
The tactic was a good one, the because the more that Tony thought about it…no he hadn’t. They said it was bad…that he didn’t need to see that. The story had been that Steve was shot; there was a shield operative that had seen it go down.  A good woman that Hill said she trusted. After that the building exploded, Hydra made sure the super soldier was finished. They killed Steve, burned him.  How many nights had Tony woke up screaming wondering if Steve had been alive when the fire got to him.
AN: I love music, as previously stated so I challenged myself writing each section inspired by a different song. I will list these per-section So if you have any of the songs handy and want to curl up in my thought process with me while reading then there ya go. I also thought it would be an interesting way to set the mood behind each scene. Let me know if you feel this enhances your reading experience and I will do it more often!
Tony stumbled back, the force of reality hitting him like a slap. “Christ...is that what I am...NO…I…” He was desperate to prove that Extremis was just a tool, just another upgrade. He was still himself. He was just the same as he always was only better; he was the man that Steve fell in love with. He was the man that carried around Peter and Wendy and tucked them in at night.
He couldn’t do that, because if he did his heart would break. He didn’t want to think, he wanted to do something. Break something…someone…yeah, someone needed to pay. Someone needed to hurt as he hurt, he could not sit back and let those bastards get away with what they had done. The team had no idea what Steve would have wanted, they didn’t know him like Tony knew him. The more he thought about it the more that cold heavy feeling spread.
“She took him Pegs…you gotta believe me. She took my son.” Howard broke down falling at her feet. “She took him and drowned him, she killed my boy, that monster killed my boy.”
So, any and all prenatal care would be giving inside the tower and at such time when the Captain’s condition became ‘noticeable’, Captain America would take a much needed ‘sabbatical’ and as far as the public would be concerned, America’s first Avenger would be some where in a cabin in one the nations beloved wildlife sanctuaries .  Cap had that salt of the earth image; it was not hard to picture him outfitted in flannel doing something ultra Alpha like Fly-fishing and wrestling bears in his down time.  That was the plan for now at least.
“Go slow… just….I think I can.”  Steve wasn’t 100% on that. He just wanted it, he felt like it wouldn’t be enough it they didn’t. He’d always heard when he was a kid that when a pair bond its better to do it during knotting. Something about endorphins and hormones at their peek, it was all a bunch of scientific mumbo jumbo back then and Steve wasn’t even sure if it was right anymore.  All he knew is he needed to feel it, needed to feel full and surrounded, needed Tony to chase out all of that doubt that hung over his shoulders like fog.
Thankfully, he always got up a bit earlier than strictly necessary to plan for these little interruptions. Steve would be cutting it close if the kids were fussy about getting in the car though, Wendy more-so than Peter. . He toyed with the idea of taking one of Tony's cars instead of the trusty SUV that he insisted on when the twins were born. Maybe he'd take the mustang, Wendy loved that car, even though Tony had insisted they not use it frequently when the kids where still infants. The alpha firmly stating that 'a vintage mustang is not a car you put a car seat in Steve.'
Yes, it was good to be away now. One day they would return and make better memories. Maybe they could redecorate and wash the slate clean?
Tony gotten concert tickets for their third date, but unfortunately the baddy of the week showed up and spoiled their date plans. Therefore, instead of rocking out, the team was busy being knocked around by rock monsters…yes rock monsters.
"No I won't, go home Stark...there's nothing left here for you. There's certainly nothing left here for me."
“Very good Captain, might I suggest rest? Sir would like to schedule some test if that is agreeable.”
Tony glazed at the filthy water swirling on the shower floor and down the drain, “You don’t know anything about comfort Jarvis…you’re not even real.”
Peter looked surprised but then laughed along with her, he was too sweet to be sad about loosing the game. It wouldn't take the little pair long to sniff out their omega and dash behind the curtains to attack Steve's legs.
“Big man in a suit of armor. Take that off, what are you?”  Steve said staring down at the slightly shorter man.
“Oh no! No no no! I will not have your ass in my face the whole way there!” Sam protested, not that it mattered, and he should have known this would happen. “I hate you guys…so much.”
They love him... Not me. Never me because I'm a liar, I'm strange, I don't think as they do and therefore- I am wrong.
Stark leaned in pressing their lips together softly. He felt Steve reach up tangling his large hands into his tank top as he pulled away. “See big guy? That grade A USDA Stark, no imitations.”
The next step, was Tony putting Vengeance away and starting work on a new armor, this became something like  ‘therapy ‘. Whether or not Iron Man would be returning that remained to be seen. However, Steve was glad to see Tony working on the new specs with Peter on his lap.
“Yeah yeah, speak for yourself grease monkey. I can still see Steve’s Apron strings hanging off your helmet.”
Bruce opted to stay behind; the situation began to weigh on him considering the possibilities and percentages. He could risk an incident.
The young man was so pale and his breathing labored. The young Mers gill slits trembles and flushed a brilliant red. “Dad…. there…there’s a woman…she…” Tony whimpered his eyes blinking open those glazed with pain.
Breathing deeply the omega relished in the last few moments of solitude. They needed to go back, the appointment was not over and if they were really going to do this the right, way they needed to give the baby every chance at health.  “Tony, I think I’m ready to go back.”
Barnes really wished this was a joke, or an over exaggeration that Loki was so prone too, but there was something in the ravenettes voice that said he was telling the honest truth. An edge of desperation that colored his words that sent a chill down the alphas spine. Loki wouldn't actually cause mass destruction with out him...but he wouldn't survive it either. “Baby, listen to me okay. I will always do my best to come home to you. Even if ...I don't want to jinx it but you know – Even if, you got so many people who will be here for you. You ain't alone anymore doll.” He caressed one of those sharp cheekbones with as much tenderness as he could pour into a simple touch. “I gatta go now sweetheart.”
( Tony can still remember the almost vacant look on his fathers face as he sat by the fire in that big brown leather chair. The way the golden light flickered over the mans gray hair and the shadows seemed to dig the lines in his face even deeper. All the while whirling the glass of amber liquid in hand before taking a deep drink. Scotch would later be the first drink to pass an impressionable 10-year-olds lips as he sat alone in the dead of night before his fathers liqueur cabinet.)
However, Natasha knew the answer. He hadn't noticed because Loki hadn't wanted his mate to notice. Chances were that was a contributing factor to how done in the man looked. Faking was hard. “Do you think it's what I want?” she asked.
Between Loki’s physical and mental state, Bruce was at a loss. He or someone, needed to examine the omega properly if they had any hope to get ahead of the mans suffering.
“It’s just…” The soldier struggled to say.. He was supposed to be a leader not someone so weak as to worry about trivial matters and yet, looking back and forth between the kind eyes and open acceptance he felt maybe it was ok. “My ma… she didn’t raise me like this ya know? We didn’t, omegas didn’t just sleep around and share what Tony and I shared with out some kind of commitment. There was this moral understanding that you were supposed to save yourself for your alpha. I know not everyone did but…I wanted to believe that too.”
“You won't believe me when I tell you.” She brightly said snapping the chains in place. “We aren't done yet pretty boy, Cap's on his way back now with our distinguished guest.”
Pulling up the police report for aforementioned shooting, Tony knew he had a winner. Apparently, someone broke into a house upstate thinking it was empty. It was not. A woman was shot and killed in front of her four-year-old daughter. The police never found the suspects.
“I'm not abandoning him! We don't leave a man behind!” Barnes nearly screams as Natasha jerks him away from the port side.
The former director wasn’t going to have Hydra digging their claws in even deeper now that Shield had gone underground. He wasn’t going to have their sickness winning over the hearts and minds of the people. All the years he and others had spent out in the field, all the agents who died - it would all be for nothing if they lost now.
Tony grasped at his finger and held it while his father gently placed the smooth stone on the baby’s chest. The light glowed a vibrant white blue and appeared to phase into the boy’s skin as Howard looked on in half horror half fascination. The glowing circle just under his son’s skin faded and the baby let out a brilliant cry.
“Easy.” Tony said One of the gantlets unfolding and now the alpha was touching him with his bare hand. Moving his face left and right before looking down to survey the damage.
“Perhaps I should have rephrased that.” The older man said looking like every bit of his years. “How is Loki fairing? The children have dearly longed to see him.”
Tony leaned back against the elevator wall shoving his hands in his pockets. His fingers flexed biting into his palms, all the while the rest of the alpha showed nothing but stoic interest. “A lie, sorry but I find it hard to believe spangles would be dishonest, he’s more wholesome than 2% milk. Now if you’re saying that this serum my old man helped cook up wasn’t all the bells and whistles they sold it as… that I might believe. However, I’ve seen Cap in action so I know that’s not true. So what are you getting at here, what in this shiny all American legend is the candy coated horse shit?”
“See that you do Buck.” Steve pats his shoulder before moving over to Stark who's standing there in his gleaming suit of red and gold. Early morning sun dancing off the armors angles and curves. It's a new model and usually Stark would be bragging about all the new bells and whistles before a mission. Not today, today he stood there with an unreadable softness settled around his eyes. Eyes that were only for his omega.
Barnes squashed the thought before it could take hold. This wasn't about him; this was about his friend and...Pack mate? James hadn’t officially joined up with the Avengers but he imagined it was a similar bond on some levels. He honestly hoped Loki would one day change his mind about the rest of the team. It would help them all to have people they could rely on.  Natasha specifically was the kind that would go to hell and back for you. Teeth bared and eyes on fire before the devil himself. She was just like that.
It was difficult for Bruce to hand the case over to someone else – but at this point Bruce was just spinning his wheels. He was having more luck on Extremis, and he couldn't devote time to both Tony and Loki. “Yeah, I know I just...”
He huffed out a sigh of pent-up frustration. Dr. Banner had said that it was likely he would not go into a full heat with all the recent stress. Chances were, he’d just feel uncomfortable while any active hormones fluctuated as his body returned to health. The order, while tentative was clear, Loki had to give himself a break. This was often easier said than done, but he was trying.
He feels his heart beat quicken and sweat prickle over the back of his neck. “No I need J, I made him to help me. He’s …he’s always been there. I need Steve, I Love him. I love the kids. The team. I need them.”
When Deadpool made it back stateside. He got an iron fist to the face. It's not like that was unusual but he had hoped to at least see Peter first before his maniac mechanic father in law kicked his teeth in.
However, his words lacked the amount of venom his brain wanted to pour into them, he felt sick and tired and it terrified him. The serum should not take this long. It never took this long.
Looking back, Tony would blame himself for being preoccupied with first words and first steps. Maybe if he had turned on the news more or paid more attention to the headlines instead of Dr. Seuss. He could have seen the connections, could have had Jarvis monitor the activity. They could have gotten ahead of this and then maybe...
The volume of the music lowered automatically as the inventor sat up rubbing his eyes once more. “Steve, you’re home… That’s, that’s good. No I mean, that’s great so. .no problems then right?” Tony cleared his throat at the end of the awkward greeting and glanced around like he wasn’t sure were to look.
“Bent out of shape...I’ll show him bent out of shape. I'll bend his fucking neck outta shape. “Barnes grumbled, rolling his shoulder as he made his way through the towers garage. He had already tried to call home three times and got nothing but the voicemail. In another world he would want to believe Loki was just annoyed or in class. However, none of those possibilities was true, as he'd already checked his mate’s gps. Therefore, either Loki left his phone at home or he just wasn't answering.
When he sits down wordlessly, she can almost taste the bitter sulking, he's holding back but just barely. There is something else he's hiding to, it familiar because she's scented it on others. Pain...but not just any kind of pain, this is anguish and self-loathing. It's the kind that destroys a person from the inside out like a cancer. A burned rotted kind of pain. James was right to worry too.
She watched her son finally come up from one of the deep trenched, curing to himself and tossing off an overly friendly jelly that found itself at home in his hair. He looked down into his palm and smiled thoughtfully, he had found something worthy. “I pray for your heart my sweet one…you deserve some happiness.” She said, watching him weave through the coral beds to find a quiet out of the way place to work.
Steve placed a hand on his aggravated mates shoulder, "Peter we just want you to be happy and with someone who is going to love and respect you. Deadpool... he's just so unpredictable. We just think you deserve better that's all."
Tony glared at the ceiling, “What! No, you do not say no to me I made you now find me some god damn day care!”
Tony didn’t know what did.  “11 Steve…Spinal tap. No... ya know what - movie night is happening as soon as possible because if we are going to reside under the same roof I’m going to need you to be up to the 21st century and all its pop cultural glory.”
“I don't see him, whatever happened he isn't here!” Sam shouted shrilly from the mast ladder. “Nat's right though, something big is happening look!”
The lift doors opened and Bruce clambered out into the living room and headed straight for the bedroom. but it was too late.
“You’re head hasn’t been in the game for the last three days.” She spoke pointedly cleaning her sidearm, “Plus, we have what we need from you. Sam can handle any additional hacking now that we’re in the system. It’s all recon for the next few days.”
“Oh yeah, total dad move.“ James stated with a laugh turning around with a fork and butter knife between his knuckles and lowering his voice. “Alright bub, I hear shit from the elf and he's worried. What the fuck are you doin over there, step it up!”
They had gone to bed that night wrapped in each others arms. Making love had been soft and kind and all the things Loki would have preferred to say he did not adore. He rather liked that others viewed him with a hard light – thinking him to be too cold for such sentiments. There was strength in the fear of others; you never had to be as strong when people feared you. If you could manipulate perception, you could be as weak as a kitten and no one would know because they would be too afraid to test your fortitude.
“Right, ok that great that’s. …” Her words trailed off as Tony grabbed for her hand muttering nonsense. “Whoa, hey Tones it’s gonna be alright okay? Your Pops is here and he’s got the best mojo around!”
“Sir is…” he sighed and looked toward the staircase that descended beneath the mansion and into the master of the house’s workshop. “His heart has died…that’s all I can call it.”
Phil had witnessed it coming, Clinton was very forgiving when he wanted to be and over protective of those he cared for. Having seen how Natasha and Steve had more-or-less looked after Loki when Barnes wasn't around had inspired the archer.
“He was having cramps, Jarvis said it was fine just a stress reaction but…Tony it worries me. I told him to lie down; Jarvis is reading to him and watching him. Just come home ok?”
"I want to warn you Loki, some of this can be very spicy. Do you want me to order for you?" Bruce offered.
The box of baked goods in the passenger seat and the false smile would get her through the door. “I know how much James loved Steve's cookies. Ya know with Tony being away the big guy kind over goes overboard. We're up to our eyes in snicker doodles.”
Tony looked somewhere between wanting to lock the soldier away in a room with filtered everything and padded surfaces and trying to remind himself that no longer was an issue. If Tony took a few steps closer then he could blame it on biology.  “So, that all you need from us for now?”
“Holy shit…” Stark mutter slapping both of his cheeks, “Alright alight I’m up let’s do this. Stevie honey, sugar, muffin how ya doing over there?”
Tony looked up at the ceiling, any other time he would have scolded himself for doing so but he was completely confused. “Distress, J show me vitals and pull up a video feed.” For a moment Tony hoped it was just a nightmare, a nightmare he could understand - he could handle that. This though…this was a lot worse than a nightmare if Steve’s pheromone output was anything to go by.
Loki leads the way to the sitting room, delicately placing the box of sweets on the coffee table. “Out doing some shopping.”
Steve pulled the little one into his lap, he knew soon she’d be to big for this…not that it would stop him. “Well, you remember when we took you and Pete to see Doctor Simmons, and she said that you were an Alpha and Peter was an Omega?
The lights where dimmed and a garment bag hung on the back of a chair at the bar. The long black bag had a little card with his name on it. Steve turned the little square between his fingers, the writing on the back wasn’t Tony’s and on the front was the address of a tailor. He unzipped the back and saw a suit, expensive - Brooks Brothers, a name that even Steve knew from his day.  This had to be a thousand dollar suit if not more.
“Did he say something to imply other wise?” Phil said, fiddling slightly with the volume dial on the radio.
“Tony this isn’t a time to joke.” Pepper said, standing up from the sofa. “Please come and sit and listen to us. We all care about you.”
The table went quiet for a moment before Natasha spoke up, “Before I might have believed you, but now it’s different. He isn’t who he used to be Steve. He attacked Rhodes not 48 hours ago, almost killed him.”
“Ok Loki, I want you to rest for now. If you need anything I won't be far, just let Jarvis know. Even if you just want to talk.”
Thor pulled back the blanket and his brow furrows at the appearance of ink black waves around the little boy’s crown. “How dare you, how truly cruel are you?” Thor looked up and helped the child carefully as she backed away from the sirens imploring reach.
“Never said you were now arms up or you walk out of here shirtless. I’m fine with option B.”  There wasn’t much room for argument and if Steve was being honest, he didn’t feel up to it right now.
Getting the ravenette out of the room was another trick. She's be able to look around if just for a few moments, she hadn't been overly concerned that Loki would use his magic. In the few dealings she had with him since his and Barnes return, the omega seemed to take a “lets not give the mortals anything to comment on” stance. Never using his talents in any of the Avenger’s presence.
He would have never met Tony.  He would have never met any of them. He would have never found Bucky.
It pissed Mallen off all the more how over confident the avenger was. Good doesn't always win, life was unfair and cruel. He'd rip Stark limb from limb and show them, he'd show them all. Hydra would string the bodies of those gilded 1%er's from the roof tops and tear down the establishment. Chaos was the only motivator, the spark they needed to hit restart on society.
James knew when he made it back to his floor, that something was wrong. The scent lingered out into the hall where there elevator was located - it was familiar but sour. Tinge with fear and loathing.
They had problems with that in the past and the last thing Tony wanted was to hurt Steve, especially now that the serum was devoted to the development of the twins and Steve’s ever changing body.
They all knew that of course, but did Steve? Maybe that’s what made this whole thing worse, Tony could see it in his friend’s eyes - Steve thought that this could all be taken as easily as it was given. That if something went wrong he’d go right back to being that sick kid. Tony was reminded of his own cruel words, ‘everything special about you came out of a bottle’. That wasn’t true and right now Tony ached knowing he’d ever said it.
Charles hated seeing Loki this way, it remembered him too much of another troubled young man he formerly knew. Normally he would have never sought out Loki's thought's but At that moment looking into those lack luster green eyes the Professor saw no other alternative. He dearly wanted to assure himself that Loki would not give up on the life he had here.
The idea to simply stop his suppressants and wail the request in the throws of ecstasy did cross his mind. That seemed a little trite though. The speedster even thought about dropping hints with parenting magazines or pregnancy books. Clint didn’t read anything unless it was comics or porn. Therefore, that was out.
AN: I am..not great with action so I had a friend help me with outlining the action in this, she’s awesome! Check her out on wattpad - ReneeIrish.
Loki hadn't been fussing with his hair or tweezing his brows. He wasn't glaring at the mirror or changing into yet another shirt. This wasn’t just a matter of ascetics or a quiet need to be annoying because his alpha did something two or three days ago, that set him off – ‘revenge is best served cold James’.
“Tony…” His hand shot out instinctively to the side of the bed to try to wake his alpha only…the inventor was not there. “Jarvis… someone…”
“Serious who makes a robot of their dead friend? That’s just some shit, nick needs to have a serious talk with his little bro.” Tony said blasting one of the many versions of Capricorn.
“I promise, if I saw anything concerning I would let you know. Now go enjoy the rest of your day with your family Cap.” Bruce assured.
Now the three of them sat in the quinjet buckled up side my side. Barton and Stark kept looking back at them laughing.
The inventor had been itching to get some readings on the mage’s mojo. He’d seen Loki’s siedr flow from the raven’s fingertips in the field. This time though he was determined to catch the sorcerer in the act and study what was really going on? There had to be something more solid than just hocus-pocus.
Ever since they entered Siberian airspace, Steve had been practically vibrating. His hands fidgeted against his knees, imagining all of the horrible things that could happen if they didn’t arrive in time. What if Tony had attacked the base, what if the forces were able to overwhelm him…what if they…NO. He squeezed his eyes shut and rebuked the thought. When they spotted the base and started looking for the armor, it seemed to take even longer.
It had been so long since he felt this that he’d almost forgotten, now trying to stretch out and breath through the discomfort he could remember this all to well. He should have noticed it; of course, he hadn’t back then either.
Thor did not believe his father’s words, not so much the strategies but that this was just a beast as another. Not as he looked into the monsters large, blood colored eyes there in the garnet pools were nothing but hate festered. The new king did not think this monster to be dull at all. “Guards find all you can and fan to the bests left and right, and someone find my brothers!”
Sitting alone in the reformed avengers compound he listened for distant conversation and footsteps as they came and went. A pair of familiar steps paused at the opening of the common room. He indeed wished that the foolish mortal would give up.
Looking around the room, everything seemed well enough. Clean and orderly, everything has its place and everything in it's place. More like a photo from a prominent decorator magazine. It was too nice, too...shiny.
As the palace rocked with the first collision, the screams came …the sounds of bodies being gnashed and broken by mighty jaws. The clap of those jaws reverberating through the halls as the royal guard assembled and tried valiantly to push back the throng from the rampaging creature outside. It felt like such a vain effort, as their forces were tosses about the sea by the chaos-filled creature.
Seeing the tears brimming in his friends citrine eyes, Loki leaned forward and hugged him. “You will both be wonderful parents. Even Logan ..the big bear he is.” he chuckled offering a handkerchief.
The noble Captain made his way through the blood murky waters as his team and the mer folk battled fiercely the thrashing behemoth. It was challenging to navigate beneath the waves where light refracted through the liquid heavens and played tricks on the eyes. Even so Steven did his best to determine the specific location based on Natasha's precise directions. Before long he was with in eye line of the Stark-mer look-a-like. If Howard Stark's son was still alive perhaps, the old inventor would let go of his genocidal plans.
“I’m sorry daddy!” Peter whined and abandoned Steve to fling himself onto his other father. Tugging at the blanket and fretfully whining.
Steve slipped on his training uniform, a soft smile on his face as he thought of how blessed his life in the 21st century was. Still, he knew the world wasn't always a beautiful or safe place. People still needed heroes and organizations like Shield to ensure the safety of the next generation. The world at large was ever changing and expanding as the human race advanced in leaps and bound. Things were so much better today than they had been in when he was growing up.
The inventor leaned into his alphas advances, feeling the cold metal fingers sliding under the band of the back of his jeans. Tony arched let out a little gasp, he loved Buckys arm, there was something so taboo about the synthetic appendage. The sound of the gears moving as the solider manhandled him sent a chill down his spine.
Steve shook off that idea. Eating in bed was lazy and he hated crumbs in the sheets. “I want fires I think…with gravy on them. You know the ones we had when we visited Doctor Xavier’s School to talk to him about that information Hydra had on mutant kids. Logan was cooking, it was really good, fries with gravy and that cheese curd stuff.”
Considering all the work his arm would need (that only Tony could fix) It was just easier. Not to mention his obvious aversion to the SHIELD med-lab. James more than trusted Bruce whom he considered pack, rather than some nameless faceless SHIELD agents. No thanks, all those cold tables and lights were just a recipe for disaster with a mind like his.
In his desperation Howard left his home, his child in the care of his butler, Howard made his way through the village to the local tap house. Perhaps if he soaked his anxiety and sorrow in the bitter spirits, around men more pathetic than himself, he could forget. What he did not expect was to overhear mad narrative from just across the dining hall.
"I know you are sweety but sometimes even big boys need some help. You wouldn't want to have an accident in your doggie jammies would you?"
He wished he could disagree, to say 'no dear you were' but that wasn't true. They both took the easy road for too long, “You're here now though..and..I want you to be. I won't...” Tears brimmed in his eyes and halted his voice. Loki was so tired of running. “I won't lie..I ..I'm so..afraid. I don't know what to do at times and I have always been so self sufficient. I feel like I wake every morning and lose myself. There are times I can't even breathe for the things in my head.”
“The love a father has for his son is much different that the love a mother has.” She continued, “A mother holds her child within her long before that child’s Father. That child learns her voice and feels her presence, Fathers start with a clean slate. Your son must look in your eyes to know you; he must feel your hands and hear your voice when you speak kindly to him.” She smiled and stroked Anthony’s cheek, the little one favoring her with one of his toothless smiles. “He will also know when he is unloved, maybe even more because he has no mother to feel so connect to. All he has is you.”
“It takes a while Tony..” Steve rolled his eyes watching his alpha hover around the plastic test strip.  They had hoped get the good news from a home test. Regardless of the outcome the pair had chosen not share the news just yet. Steve worried it might not be a good time with things how they are in the tower with Bucky and Loki.
Loki wanted to scoff at the idea of needing anyone. Even so, he knew better than to discredit the words of Asgard’s Queen. Frigga’s magic was special even among their people. She had what some might call ‘sight’ of things not yet to be, or not yet set in stone. While she could not direct this magic, specifically she did have visions from time to time. Her intuition was also unmatched.
Thor was up and pushing his friend, scolding Fandral for hurting Loki. The other boy’s face ad gone red with embarrassment and a touch of fear - vehemently apologizing.
Now, with the broken bond – Tony was just starting to feel the distance that Steve had been suffering all along. This new body didn't want him to feel it but it seemed at least that much of him was still willing to rebel.
Thanos had been disappointed by the performance of Asgard’s fallen prince, perhaps he didn’t need a noble to seek out domination; perhaps what he needed was a General. One that would incite the rage of Midgard’s heroes and bring them in close before delivering the killing blow.
“See, Tony’s going to be ok.” Pepper tried to sound soothing as she laid her hands over Steve’s trying to lead him away from the chair he was very close to breaking.
"Someones happy." Tony smirked as heavy hands settled on his hips when the lift doors closed and lips found their way to his neck. "I saw you Spangles, it was a wonder we didn't have to say the pledge to flag ya got."
Not to mention hearing that Bucky had found someone, it was amazing and he was so happy to hear that.
“I notice the winds picked up over the last hour.” He said, seeing the other man at the wheel eyeing the horizon with trepidation.
“I've got eyes on him.” He relayed through the coms and cautiously approached the mermaid and her heavy cargo.
The mood of the room grew somber as the elder man spoke. “May I ask you Captain Rogers, do you have any children, a wife perhaps?”
Loki's face twisted and crumbled. "He...he did this on purpose to  make a fool of me. I have done nothing but try my best to show that i am reformed and still still he plays such cruel jokes! If i wished to be made a jest of I would have remained on Asgard!"
“It’s ok, I am here and I swear to you I’m going to be here for a long time Tony. Can’t get rid of me that easy.” Steve tried one of his lopsided smiles and received a soft one from his husband in return.  They were going to be fine; it was just going to take some time.
He could feel the rough stretch of Buckys face on his skin, the way those strong hands touched him everywhere as he spoke. Reaching under each and caressing his belly when Bucky talking about ‘breeding’ him. It’s not like Steve really had the equipment but when Bucky talked about it like that. It made him believe, made him want to be stretched and swollen with Buckys babies.  It made him painful hard that Steve feared he might come right then and there. “B-bucky please!”
Feels like Thor watched alot of CSI: Miami while he was visiting Jane....DArcy..we blame you for this.
That was all he needed. Steve's shoulders slumped and he hurried inside, dropping to his knees when in reach. His head rested on Tony's leg and he hugged his partner around the waist. A little whimper of "Daddy " falling from his lips.
Natasha looked over the skeletal remains for any flaw or sideshow trick of bone fusing and found none. She wanted to find something, to prove this was just a hoax because if this was real..what else was out there? “It looks like the real deal.” She said looking up at the group. Her face appeared passive but a subtle twitch of her lips betrayed her nerves and she felt James place his hand in the small of her back.
The apple clearly did not fall to far from the tree. Bitterness was all he had to keep him warm, that and the anarchist cookbook.
He felt like a fool waiting on the mezzanine, while the servants prepared a room for his ‘soon to be mate’. They looked at him oddly when he had requested separate sleeping quarters. Whispers among the rubes ‘maybe the prince hasn’t the taste for fair things’, ‘perhaps he is Ergi’. Loki had never loved or even felt love for another before Amora, if Loki was perfectly honest he had never even had carnal urges for anyone. The idea of it seemed…complicated and messy. Another reason he was such a disappointment to his father he supposed.
Loki was about to turn to go when a large hand closed around his bicep. Turning to the shining blue eyes that reminded him far too much of his own brother, he fought the urge to pull away. Steve didn't deserve his anger. Not on a day like today when there was likely no one else who understood so keenly what this felt like.
One reason was the twin’s second trimester growth spurt. At 24 weeks  the omega felt every ache and stretch as his protruding belly now made it self known at all hours of the day and night. The twins constant rolling and kicking was in some ways a comfort and in others an annoyance.
“Not as yet sir, Doctor Banner is on site and has determined the creature seems to be a culmination of several other creatures and enhanced with an unknown element. Should the beast make landfall - I assume the hulk may be added to limit property damage.” Jarvis replied.
The trip from the tower to the ice cream parlor wasn't terribly eventful, aside from the usual city traffic and idiot drivers. Loki put on a movie for the children while they headed out of the city.  He found himself watching them in the rear-view mirror, Wendy little blonde pigtails glinting like spun gold in the sun, Peter concentrating so hard on the film with his big brown eyes. For a split second, Loki replaced those features in his mind’s eye.
The terrorist snarled as long black claws split his glowing fingertips. “It ends with me killing the future.” Mallen had come to far for this and just because Stark had somehow gotten hold of the very same edge that he had didn't mean a thing. Stark was just another one of the governments lap dogs in his eyes. Another industry fat cat out playing hero, he could never understand what it was like for the underdog. Never see that this world was nothing but a cesspool waiting to be drained. There was no going back now, it was all scorched earth or nothing.
Steve smiled and reached down to help haul the slighter man to his feet. His hand not letting go immediately, unsure what to say or if there even was anything to say.
Stark rose from his chair and walked over to the fireplace. “Sergeant, I have no illusions about getting anything back. I can tell you however, that you can regain anything if you work hard enough, if your smart enough- even if it’s just a scrap of dignity. If only you know where to look.” Stark pressed a button on the mantle and the framed painting above the fire turned to revel a darkened case. With the flip of the switch, the case lit and showed its contents - A metal arm.
It was clear to Tony that he could not do this without Steve; he’d call Pepper in the morning. He had to do what was best for Peter.
“I don't think that's it. Loki would have said something after his physical if that were the case. Banner's a smart guy I would think something like that would have stood out ya know.”
Loki was shifting into fighting form now and shouting down the line. “Oh yes! The savage frost giant! The murderer of the nine realms! Such a horrid bitch I make! “
“How ya feelin?”  The soldier’s voice rumbled behind him, punctuated by a kiss on the gods shoulder.
Rhodes had hoped to settle this on land, but upon entering the workshop, it was clear that wasn’t going to happen. Tony was no wear in sight and flight doors were open.
He wanted to hit something and that was immature, Steve knew that but really, if he could have gone down to the gym and broke a few heavy bags he would. He couldn’t though, laying a hand low on his stomach he wondered if he was doing damage even now.
“Rambling Tones.” Bruce quipped gently tugging the alpha away. “Why don’t you come with me while Ms. Simmons cleans up Steve?
The entryway opened and they were greeted by the butler, an elderly man named Edwin Jarvis. Not at all an imposing figure in relation to his surroundings. Jarvis was a small kindly looking man with a British accent and twinkling blue eyes. “Thank you for coming Sir’s, Madam; please follow me to the parlor and Mr. Stark will be with you shortly.” Jarvis said, leading them inside and subsequently offering the guests afternoon tea.
The guard raised an eyebrow but nodded in understanding. Enough people thought poorly of the youngest prince that to believe him capable of infanticide.
“No dice J, they know the rules, Daddy gets one hour of work time before we feed the gremlins. I have things to do, magnificence to build. No sticky fingers allowed.”
Tony had what some would coin as a “love /hate relationship” with his omega’s mood swings. Mostly because Tony was awful with tears. He loathed them in fact, his tactics ended with ‘diversion’ and ‘cuddles’. Beyond that, he would just beg for help or fake having something to do that was extremely urgent.
Standing over a body, carefully hidden behind the overgrowth of foliage, Phil poked at the exposed wires that certainly shouldn't be poking from a human neck.  “An LMD, why would hydra be using LMD's when they a perfectly good pack of goons to pick from.”
She had expected Phil, but there was someone in the passenger seat. A man in a ball cap and shades his face was turned away but there was something  about the shape of his jaw. Something that made her fingers twitch around the paper tube of her overpriced coffee.
Tony scrunched up and little face and launched forward hugging the bewildered creature’s neck. “Sorry you lonely:”
Wrangling the rambunctious pair to get dressed and be calm as they headed down to the lab floor had been a remarkable feat in and of itself.
“Christ...” He felt sick, true there had been a point that Tony toyed with the idea of including bore bio-elements into the suit. He had already been using dermal implants for months now but this.  “Tell me you haven't done this to someone.”
“What. Did. You. Do. Tony.” Her arms are crossed and right now even if he says the right thing it won't matter.
The alpha poked his head into the bedroom and watched as the omega turned from one side to the other and curled up around a pillow. Steve looked like he’d put on a bit more weight in the last couple of week when Tony was away. That was good; it meant the babies were healthy and if the side effect of filling out those all American thighs was a factor…well Merry Christmas Mr. Stark.  Tony watched a bit longer before slipping away to shower away the sweat that had no doubt left him a bit ripe even in the air circulated suit.
It's not ok though and that's what's so terrifying because all he can feel is how much Loki hates himself. How deep this feeling of failure has sunk in with razor sharp claws. Part of him wonders if he can even do anything to fix this now. Loki is so bad about holding in everything until he breaks. James had been so sure they were past that. He had done everything he could to let the other man know he was safe and loved.
“As I said before Captain, when you lose something that precious you will do anything to get it back.”
Amora had her time among the shallows reveling in the so fragile and foolish creatures. She loved that look of hope in their eyes before she damned them. A hobby those in power would look down upon and yet never publicly denounce. It was that power she desired more than the delight of pain, to be someone respected and feared. Therefore, the siren looked closely at the sons of Odin and with a heartbeat found her purpose.
Tony was grinning like the cat that ate the canary the whole ride, his inner alpha purring with delight at seeing an omega take comfort in something of his design. Call it old fashioned but this was like bringing home the buffalo - or as close to it as Tony would come because while he did love Uncle Ted’s sweet guitar riffs, he did not share the outdoorsman trait.
“Sit down! Sit Down! How can I do that Tony!” Steve’s eyes flashed and his jaw clicked, “Schmitt was dead! I saw it! I saw the fucking cube zap him into nothing! Now he’s back and he had Bucky!”
The soldier chuckled, carefully shielding Starks eyes as he rinsed his hair "Yeah I do, smug bastard."
“You look beautiful.” Darcy said, placing a few more gems along the dorsal grooves of Jane’s tail. Each little bauble sparkled as it caught the light and reflected off the Mers teal colored scales.
Pepper looked up at Happy, her husband shrugged his shoulders and spoke into his ear piece, discretely asking Jarvis to watch Tony and alert him if the genius did anything harmful.
Steve had never felt to free, never felt so wanted as when Tony pressed his hand down between them and asked in breathy tones for the omega to please touch him. For once Steve didn’t mind his too big hands or too wide shoulders, he felt like he fit here with Tony.
Report her findings? “Loki there's nothing I could say that would result in you having to leave, I know you're not doing anything sinister here, you aren't a danger to anyone”...aside from yourself, she wasn't going to say that though. Taking a jab or two now wasn't wise. He was trembling even more now and Natasha knew he could see it but even the overly self-conscience omega wasn't even trying to hold it in. Adrenaline – her mind supplied. It was the fight or flight response and Loki was intent on fleeing it seemed. This prompted the alpha to push more comfort and ease from her end. If you had told Natasha a few years ago that, she would be trying to comfort Loki. She would have suggested a number of medications you might like to try to handle those delusions.
Tony knew how to deal with that type, even later on when those types were just starting to thin out – leaving sons Tony's age or a decade or so older to take the reigns. The second generation had been Tony's people! He could take those people to the trendiest club and schmooze until the wee hours. They would drink and go to parties, make a few bad decisions and a few memorable nights. He even managed to cultivate a few friendships like that.  Now, not so much.
When Tony walked into the bedroom, he was welcomed by the low amber light and his AI’s voice reading in a kind voice unlike he’d ever heard personally. It was in times like this he wondered if Jarvis was just lines of code or if something special had happened along the way. Because only something with a true soul could read a children’s book to a grown man so sincerely.
Likewise, hearing the possessive grown in his alpha’s voice sent a shiver along the soldier’s spine. Steve let out a little breath when the alphas pheromones started to spike. “Tony… Tony are you..Ah..Are going into rut?”
Coming home after a mission was not as it used to be. There was no revelries or joking, no pizza in the common room. …No Steve to peel out of that deliciously tight uniform. No rough hands that could turn to satin on his skin. No full lips brushing his jaw and smiling against his pulse point. It felt offensive to the senses that he could still feel it if he closed his eyes tight enough. The muscle memory creating a tingle at the base of his neck. Looking down the hall out of the corner of his eye - still expecting to see blue eyes shining in the low light under dripping wet blond hair.  If he tried... Really tried, if he drank just enough, Tony could see him standing there. One hand poised on the wall and a towel hanging dangerously low on lean hips. How Steve’s skin always looked a little pink because he tended to turn the hot water on full blast. The little freckles on his shoulders or scar just behind his ear hidden along his hairline. Something before the serum, something only Tony knew about.
Loki's arrival on the scene wasn't unwelcome, truthfully –his power could easily turn the tide. Coulson wasn't going to stop the Hail Mary pass by any means, but it was unusual.
She had assured him it wasn't selfish at all to find a way to decompress once he came home, be it from SI work or Avengers missions. Steve had a similar ritual that mostly consisted of staying at the Compound or Shield for a few hours just letting his mind get out of  'soldier mode'. Tony didn't have a problem with that yet somehow things that applied to other he had a hard time of applying to himself.
With Thor's arrival, there was a chance at obtaining a bit more knowledge. Bruce asked if there was any documentation about the Jotnar that Thor could get his hands on. Naturally, Thor was more than happy to do so if it meant supporting his brother. Assuring Banner that he would contact Asgard and request that the royal library be searched for any and all documents. Additionally, he would send his Shield Brothers, Fandral and Hogan to neighboring realms to see if they might have any knowledge of the Frost Giants.
Loving someone isn't effortless and it never will be, it's those nights that you can't stand the sight of someone – but saying ' I love you' anyway, because you want those to be last words they hear if god forbid they never hear anything else.
Learning to love yourself felt like a grand joke. Self care nothing more than a feel good money pit, popular with the youthful masses seeking to be 'woke'. No one could possibly understand.
The omega chuckled raising his bottom in presentation, “You don’t mean that shell head…you’re hooked now.”
Stark, years later say that that was the first night that opened the gate to the best sleep of his life. "Temprapedic doesn't have shit on a soldier sandwich." he'd laugh and watch his partners blush
Perhaps he was even more selfish to feel such pain at the thought of all the features such a child would lack. It wasn't some poor child's fault, it was his.
However, Thanos had not counted on Schmitt’s own agenda and lust for power. He didn’t just want to destroy the avengers and have Captain Rogers head on a pike; he wanted Hydra to rise from the ashes of obscurity.
Stark let out a harsh laugh, “no, see you used to be there Pep. I loved you remember - but it wasn’t enough. It was enough for Steve; it was always enough for him. He was the one that was there when things went to shit after you left, he was the one that picked me up off the floor - literally and forced me to get my shit together. I’m not saying this is your fault, hell you are one of the few blameless people in this. What I am saying is don’t you dare presume to know me like you used to.” Tony turned away moving his hands over the suit specs, “ I don’t even know myself anymore, so just do me this one favor and keep my boy safe, even if its from me.”
On the second trip she paused in her gathering, “He needs you right now. He may not say it but he does.”
"Sir. I believed you wished to be informed of any and all action involving Mr. Loki, that you might find....worth of broadcast?"
He had always been a believer in the greater good, things like - don’t leave a man behind. He wasn’t going to leave Tony. Not again. Steve wasn’t going to watch another person he cared for fall and be forgotten. Left to become a monster.
Bucky cooed and knelt to kiss Steve’s lower back, “My sweet girl, your such a good honey you can’t say those nasty words can ya? Can’t tell me how bad you wanna be stretched out and filled up. Breed up for me. Hmm?”
The few goons who exited the doors on the side of the building didn’t even have time to dispatch into their comrades about the lone soldier before a bullet lodged in their heads.
They were happy, weather either one of them deserved such happiness.... Well that was up for debate.
. Lovely, nothing says professional like a cartoon cow telling you to come take a hunk out of his ass. Delicious… “The point is we shouldn’t have to stop.”
"I don't want anything Loki...I don't even know why I just..." Tony's eyes flitted down to one of the aliens pale slender hands and on impulse, he reached out and took it.
Even when he was a little guy, maybe it was worse then being tugged off to the omega ward to be looked over by some old nurse with cold hands who would tisk at his weight and then poke and prod with instruments while jotting things down on a yellow steno.
He wants to correct the man but knows that the director is right, Hydra has a strict 'no tattle tale policy'. Death before dishonor and all that. It was the same back in 41 and it's the same now, only now instead of false molars and hidden capsules it's time released dermal implants. If Hydra's assets don't return to the nest by the time allotted – dead as a doornail. Until then all they have to do is keep their mouth shut. Really, what’s the use talking when you’re going to die anyway?
One of these days his luck would run out, he'd be too slow, too stubborn or just in the wrong place at the wrong time. That's how it would be, getting his ticket punched on a case of obvious oversight.
The inventor held up a hand, “Lemme correct you right there Rocky, Steve…. I doubt has ever been ordinary or unexceptional.”
“but you didn’t come home…you didn’t.” Tony looked up and god he wanted to believe. Then If that was true, if all of this had just been an elaborate lie. Look at everything he had done since. How could he live with himself ever again?
Even James was crying now and that hurt even more. Loki found himself reaching out for the man and sure enough his alpha was there climbing into the bed and hold him. Holding him like he was worth something, telling him he loved him and that it was all going to be alright. Words came spilling out him that were once hidden in the darkest reached of his own mind, words he never wanted to give the alpha. Yet he couldn't hold them back now as that weakness reared it's ugly head and tore down his carefully constructed walls. “I ache inside, I feel it every time. I want to give you children, our children. I never thought myself capable of that but with you...I want them so badly. I know it is so selfish given all I have done...all the lives I have taken – to want to feel life with in me. James I can't take it.... I can't take feeling this pain anymore.”
“Like watching a film where two people can control the volume and can't agree.” Jemma looked down sadly. “Is there anything we could do to help?”
Words from Steve’s past suddenly came to mind, long ago when they were hunting the Winter Soldier. “He’s not the kind you save… he’s the kind you stop.”
“Yes well, she will be speaking with Kurts' group. He's taking those more interested in physical service. I'll be in charge of the group more interested in research and development.” Loki replied, frowning slightly at the sight of the alphas breakfast. There were somethings he would never comprehend.
If Tony headed up to the penthouse and spent the following hour furiously jerking off in the shower, well that was no ones business.
Steve knew what that was; the lobotomy was just coming in to practice when he was a teenager. “T-that’s not …What you mean is it?”
When Steve got back in it was late, he walked into the penthouse and down the hall to the bedroom. Bucky was asleep with Tony curled up on his chest, his metal arm wrapped protectively around the engineers back. Face pressing into Tony's hair as they slept.
That was the thing though, Loki didn’t trust her. He wasn’t as jaded by her as she thought, but he was hungry to feel something other than second best. Even if her love was a thin veil to her ambition. It was something, it was someone and perhaps the danger was a risk he could take. Maybe she would learn to love him as he had begun to love her. To crave her approval and presence.
Tony frowned and tossed his phone to the motel bed, “And let you and Sammykins have all the fun on this little three hour tour?”
Tony chuckled and nibbled at the back of his omega’s shoulder, “So sassy even like this, how about I fuck all those smart remarks right out of you , Mmm shit, god yeah. You’d like that wouldn’t you. My filthy little omega, look at you taking my cock so pretty, you’re so wet and I love how you blush for me when I’m talking like this.”
She doesn't say anything and maybe thats worse cause all he has is the harsh click of her heels on the floor when she leaves. Tonight is going to be a monster when he gets back to the penthouse.
After the Madam had taken control of Hydra, she began to reform her forces. Gone where the days of pedigreed soldiers who were raised for the cause. Madam Hydra wanted killers, madmen. Most of all - she wanted monsters.
Alpha was caring for him. Steve felt his body relax even more as he drank down the offered water.  When the bottle was drained, the omega sighed and turned his head to nuzzle against his alpha, a content little purr rumbling in the back of his throat.
Bruce made it there before him, thankfully, the beta had the good sense to wait, Bruce knew Tony and Steve had something going on and walking in on an omega on the edge of heat with out their alpha present was just asking for a bloody nose. In Banners case, it was more likely to result in bringing out the other guy.
All the same, there was always that little voice in the back of their minds that recalled the mission reports from New Mexico. Loki wasn't some innocent little lamb. The omega had committed sins long before he fell into the hands of Thanos. How did any of them know what really went on in the fallen prince's head. Especially when he was so secretive?
“What is he doing…?” Steve moved to the edge of his seat watching as Tony circled behind the creature darting precariously close as the inventor maneuvered between the lashing serpentine limbs. “He’s to close…Jarvis tell him to pull back.”
Natasha needed more information, seeing Loki in his own element would give her an edge. Some might think that was exactly the wrong thing to do, that isolating the enemy in unfamiliar territory was the only way to get the truth. That wasn't wrong; it was a tactic that could be employed depending on ones query. However, getting Loki to come to the tower for a sit down was not going to happen.
“Aida.” Coulson said looking up as the play back fizzled out to static. “We need to tell Stark and Barnes what their up against.
Steve looked up from his book and smiled, he knew Bucky was coming by today and he’d been so nervous. Tony had paced around and then scented him aggressively…followed by a round of Stark classic self-loathing for ‘being a typical knothead’, Steve thought it was oddly amusing.
“Everything you are feeling is perfectly normal Steve.” Jemma assured over the video feed. “It’s very common for unmated omegas to experience what is called a ‘mini’ heat during the third trimmest of their pregnancy. Considering some of the other issues you have had, I’m surprised it didn’t occur sooner. The mini heat is your bodies attempt to seek comfort in bonding. It’s honestly nothing to worry about or feel pressured by.”
Tony and Steve tended to be a bit overprotective and Loki still wasn't Tony's favorite person. Honestly, he just tolerated him for Bruce's sake.
“Natasha’s right, I’d go for spiral staircase myself.” Phil chimed in as he pulled a gun from a fallen hydra agent and climbed into a jeep after tossing out a body. “If its metal it also adds to resell value. Have to think about future property values.”
Clearly Stark was keeping himself busy in the last decade. Even in peace time it seemed there was always a market for war.
Barnes unholstered his weapon and pulled the mask up over his face, true he didn't need it anymore but there was something about it that made this part of his life feel separate.
Tony leaned over and kissed his neck, the alpha always liked physical contact. Especially after a mission, it was like he couldn't keep his hands to himself the moment he made it to the penthouse. Which is what led them to this little bundle of joy in the first place. “Poor papa, did you miss Daddy too?”
The Winter Soldier had gotten away and Steve had taken a dive off the helicarrier and into the Potomac. Reports said Rogers had been shot multiple times before nearly drowning.  Tony didn’t even realize what he was doing, suiting up as fast as he could, would Steve even want to see him, or anyone. It didn’t matter of course because at that point Stark had a single objective, to get his ass there as soon as possible.
“I stopped the project last year; there were too many problems with the subjects. I realized that Extremis was just to volatile and even if it wasn’t…the risk out weighed the reward. I was willing to walk away from it all but Killian insisted I stay on. He said I was an asset, I was a fool to believe him. He just wanted the virus…that’s what it’s become Tony, that’s the only word I can use for it at this point.  Worse, I think Killian has been working with it behind my back. I'm not sure what he's doing with it but it can't be anything good. I'm risking a lot just by telling you this. I just... didn't know who else to call.”
He knew that Bucky knew it too. Part of Steve really hoped that was how Bucky felt about Loki, that Bucky could see that… ‘Heroic stuff’ that no one else could because, everyone deserves a love like that.
Tony tried not to laugh but he had to, more ‘captain America doesn’t approve’ glares for him. “Sorry, not sorry.” He quipped getting up and exiting the nesting room. “I’ll make it up to you later ok baby, daddy will ride you hard and put you away wet.”
There was so much wrong with this, it couldn’t be and even though it was, there was no sign it would be for long. Bruce had explained that to him once day in the lab when they were looking over the unstable state of Steve’s internal plumbing.
Tony could see now why Pepper would be reluctant to leave him alone at times, after New York, he got those same looks. After Malibu, there was a lot Tony didn’t say, and he had tried a time or two. It was too hard to open yourself up when you’ve been under the impression that only bad could come from it.
The face he uses to get out of trouble, it works on Steve, bruce and tony...not so much Natasha or Phil
Something told the widow this wasn't because he had a brain washed x-man tied up in the closet. This was something else, something in that tremble and this grand show of ' I'm okay you're okay'. He spaced out to and let her retort slide, she knew his wit was faster than that.
When the door opened Tony steeped put walking leisurely down the dark hallway as fluorescent light above him lighting the way. This was what he called the “Fire Lab” For some of his more contained projects; the area also offered the added privacy of being inaccessible to anyone other than himself. No one was allowed access unless there was a life and death emergency. In which case Jarvis had a protocol for who would be allowed down.
The bedroom was empty and nesting room was locked up tight. “Loki, I need you to open the door, can you do that? Loki?”
She snarled, her features twisting into something grotesque and hate filled. “I desire what I deserve! If you do not want it, then hack off its tail and feed it to the sharks for all I care! I can give you heirs Thor! I can give you everything!”
Wade had been thrown out of a lot of places but none as nice as Stark Tower, or from that many floors up!
Things would be stressful for a while and Steve just needed a little breathing room to figure out how to handle the fall out. Even with the battles over and them both home this wasn’t the end, they couldn’t just pick up were they left off like a fairy tale.
High polished black jackboots clicked over the concrete floor. The sound followed by a steadier paced modern combat boot. The pair stopped before a mass of soldiers, faces obscured by masks.
Bruce doesn't seem alarmed when revels the hidden differences in Loki's anatomy . Nor does the man seem disgusted as he explains what he's found.
Footsteps on the back deck catch his ear, Duchess would eat an intruder no ifs, ands, or buts about it, and so Loki is out side...but at this hour?
Moreover, he’d be sharing it with Tony; there was  warmth in that thought. Having someone to share something so personal with was so new. Something Steve never thought he’d have or deserve. Yet here he was, comfortable and cared for just waiting for his alpha to return and…oh.
The trio decided to head up to the command floor to talk, Tony pretended it was for less noise and privacy, although it was really because it was about time for Steve mid afternoon snack. Neither of the alphas batted and an eye when the blond waddled off to the kitchen and came back with a large sandwich loaded down with everything but the kitchen sink.
Even with all the cheers and now special teams arriving to sweep what was left of the base for information, there was one spot of stillness.
Steve was evading, but he gave an inch and Tony was willing to take it, “Bruce knows…but what about everyone else.”
“J, when did this happen and has structural integrity been compromised in anyway?” Tony asked feeling a tinge of nerves. Considering his walls were now gone and he was looking at a forest where there should be a bedroom.
The team always teased Cap on his eating habits, the man could put away enough for three people. Steve would always fluster and blame it on the serum. Bruce had once hypothesized that while the serum likely was the culprit for physical need for calories, more than likely the way Steve approached food had to do with how he grew up.
This was all a shameful tactic but Loki just needed to be alone right now. He needed time to breathe and he couldn't do it with James so close. The alpha would know instantly something was a miss and then they would have to talk... no he just wasn't up for that right now.
After Steve’s shower  Tony meet him with his prenatal protein shake and kiss on the cheek. No sooner at Steve taken a sip as he steeped into the walk in closet did the assemble alarm go off. He looked over his shoulder to see Tony tugging on his armor under-suit with a regretful look on his face. It couldn’t be helped really, they both knew that.
There is reference here to Agents of shield LMD, and the Framework arc in that series. This chapter will be a good deal shorter than what I normally post; sorry for that but it is within reason. The following chapter to this one will have a lot of action and I wanted to devote more writing time to that one. I hope this one will be a good frame up for the action packed chapter 8. So enjoy the respite for now kids. We are going to be treading water.
Who could blame the Alpha; chances were that Tony had spent his whole life trying to avoid this sort of thing. How many money hungry omegas had already tried to sling a paternity suit at him? Surely, he didn’t think the same of Steve, but at the same time didn’t that make it worse? Because it wasn’t like Steve was lying for the hell of a payday. This was real and Steve didn’t want to be the man who ruined Tony Stark. “Just go home Stark.”
Stark bit the side of his fist. Whatever amazingly great thing he’d done in a past life to deserve this… he was thanking his lucky stars. Or in this case Stars and Stripes
Perhaps he was so in trawled with the ancient inter workings of the old machine and the melodic tones reverberating around him that he didn’t notice the subtle footsteps crunching along the gravel path between the barn and the farm house.
“What is going on…Jor heel this instance.” Loki remanded the creature, Jormungand hiss and snapped his jaws at the girl before curling around the prince’s tail. The serpent still eyeing the young mer with a measure of distrust.
Small fish of different colors, glowing jellies, and various items found in the wreckage. It seemed odd to keep them in such a way but he was sure she had her reasons. “Amora.”
The swab was as Bruce said- quick and painless. While they waited for the test to finish Tony vacated the bed to go get some ice packs from the kitchenette on Steve’s floor. Bruce trailing him as he set the kit on the counter. “It should take around 5 minuets.” the beta said with a sigh running his hand back through his bed-rumpled curls. “You might want to have a talk with him about …you know…”
Natasha tilted her sunglasses down the morning sun sparking the gold rim of the ray bans. Her gaze settling on the red corvette that pulled up into the trendy little café in Riverdale, Bronx.
“I think maybe Loki pushed things aside to quickly? I really can't say. I've been so busy with my extensive research, Pepper calls me to let me know how things are going of course. He's... he's not okay.”She lays a hand on the worried blondes forearm.“James is working hard not only for Loki but for himself too. These things take time Thor.”
“I’m thinking about our children’s nutrition Steeeeeb.” The billions whined and proceeded to place the bra on his head.
Honestly, it was cute in a strange sort of way. Bruce just sat down and cuddled the sobbing man until Loki fell asleep. The warm mass of blankets and limbs was impossible to move at that point. So the good doctor just accepted his fate. Curling up with his boyfriend for an afternoon nap.
It was like looking at the hands of a stranger. Flexing each digit and thinking, 'these are mine...but not.' A little voice in the back of his mind answered his worries
The little one eventually screamed himself horse and left only pitiable little hiccups against her breast. She was not his and perhaps he knew it.
There wasn't much Bruce could do at the moment, he needed to speak with Barnes and see if there was a way he could suss out how Loki ended up like this.
Barnes didn't seem to mind, saying as much as he sat down in an adjacent chair. He didn't have the look of a man with something to hide, then again – Bruce thought Darkly – Neither did his father.
“Genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist….merchant of death. Check it out dad, I finally lived up to your name.”
“Steve!… Shit…” Tony threw his arms out to catch the larger man as he pitched forward. Stark was thankful he hadn’t decided to take the armor off when he first found Steve or he wouldn’t have been able to hold the omega up under his own power. “Steve come on, Steve open your eyes baby. Come on Steve.” Tony’s voice came out in hurried shouts as he tried to maneuver the soldiers dead weight around as they both went down.
“Coming.” Dry your eyes, just don't say anything. Remember how disappointed he was last time. You don't want to hurt him like that again. Loki slipped on his mask heading out, looking as perfectly groomed as ever. Hair glossy and neat, brushed out of his face, wearing a black buttoned up shirt and well-fitted slacks. James always-said Loki looked like he was one-step from the runway at all times.
Steve followed the sounds of giggling and found the little ones curled up on either side of the gingers stomach listening intently. Bruce sat on the other side of Wendy and waved at Steve as he entered. The beta was quick to stand up and offer a hand with the baked goods – cookies and pies.
“Don’t fucking touch me? You got that and by the way, nice kiss Judas. Coming here to tell me how to run my life. Et tu Bruce?” Tony called into the living room. Banner not meeting his eyes. “Yeah thought so, ya know it’s funny all of you seem to know what’s best for me, and how to help me. Where the hell were you when Steve was out there dying? Barton, you and your sister assassin pal just stood around with your thumbs in your ass while Hydra killed my husband. So you will all kindly understand if I say fuck you and fuck your opinions.”
“Babe, you are not your parents. Any kid of ours will know without a doubt how much we love them. No matter where they come from or who their parents are.”
It doesn't take long for trousers to join the collection of garments on the floor. Skin against skin, teeth grazing over supple flesh and breathy moans escaping onto the night.
“What took you so long Stark.” Barnes voice piped through the helmet. Tony glanced over at the security feed and watched the soldier make his way to the main operation floor.
The morning would come and find the three of them wrapped around each other, Tony graded on both sides by his soldiers.
Loki rolled his eyes, “Cute Stark, your quips are ever so witty. Things at the school are going quite well. My students are all skilled beyond their years, in fact, I should suspect that the future crop of super powered villains will be even better than the last. “He smirked.
Bucky walked around him surveying the fit and fall of the garment. He reached out unbuttoning the blouse by one, two, three closers. “You know honey, moral girls remember to wear their bras. How can I let you go out like this? Have other guys eying up my dame cause they can see her tits through her dress? What kinda joker do I look like?”
She thought it over, he wasn't going to give up that much was easy. "If I say yes. What did you have in mind."
They found their way wrapped around each other, sharing warmth and the soft glow of the reactor, all the while Tony hummed the soothing bars the song until he felt Steve lax against him.
“I have to ask, am I the only one who feels a little weird about mass genocide?” Sam asked as the group sat on the main deck, drinking and enjoying the sunset.
Tony didn’t realize he was crying until little hands pressed his wet cheeks. “Why daddy…why” the little boy hiccuped and wept.
“Pepper and Bruce have all the kids on the common floor since it’s closest to the command office. Natasha is in there keeping in touch with Clint since he's back up support for now. I wish Sam or Thor were available, it would make me feel a lot better.” Steve said motioning off to a hallway just beside the kitchen.
“Congratulations. It’s Twins,” Simmons said smiling as she taped the screen. “They are monoamniotic so baby A was probably in front of Baby B in the first image we took at shield. You can see them both clearly now.”
Steve took a deep breath; he couldn’t worry about it right now. After Tony left he would look at his chart they left at the foot of the bed, make sure, it said what it needed to say and if it didn’t then he’d deal with it later.
“It doesn't have to be, you don't have to carry this. I used to think I had to carry things alone, sometimes that's too much for anyone, even a god.”
Watching the cloudy yellow of the lemonade swirl around the little cubes of ice, Loki listened to the question. His composer waning as the outside of the glass began to frost over in his hands. Placing the tumbler on the counter he glared at his palms tinged blues. “I see, surely they can't have missed all of my assignments. I was frequently the instructor that gave the most homework you know.”
When the eldest of Odin’s sons arrived, he was shocked to see his brother’s paramour in such a state. “Amora… what has happened? Whose child is this?”
“What about Natasha or Clint? Would you lie to them to, would Fury?” What Steve really wanted to know...was if they lied to him. They had been with him at the time of the ambush, it wouldn’t be hard to believe that one of them could have doubled back and followed him. In fact no one would be better suited to track him than a member of his own team. That didn’t mean that Steve wanted to face the possibility that one of the them… people he saw as family. That they would have betrayed him like that, hurt Tony and Peter like that.
Amora watched the ship sailing through the dark seas. It was a modest craft of wood and copper, the smoke from the engine rose into the night sky from a flue just behind the cabin. The ship itself was second to what else she saw, or perhaps ’who’ would be the better term. The siren noticed the captain of the tiny vessel was a handsome man. His dark hair and eyes gave the man a piercing gaze. The kind of man who thought much and acted swiftly.
Howard dismissed his boys reckless life, they never had that well of a relationship to begin with and it wasn’t as if Tony was that heartbroken when Howard would yell and preach, threatening to cut off his son’s funds and send him into the military. “Make a real alpha outta you, put a gun in your hand and straighten out that damn attitude with some hard work.” Howard would say.
Loki doesn't speak and that's okay with Steve. Baby steps, he tells himself as he takes a seat beside the other omega. “How long have you been up?”
Then there was his sweet spidey. His baby boy looked so tired and sick that it broke his heart.  He would have never dreamed that something like this could happen. Peter put the doctor slip in his hands and asked him not to be upset.
His calluses were gone, that scar on the back of his right knuckle from where he first built Dum-E back at MIT was gone. He was so proud of his goofy little bot, even if Dum-e could try his patience most of the time. Tony remembers how the school paper took his picture and he cut it out to send home.
Steve felt the sudden rush from several of the shots Bruce administered in the jet. Shaking his head to clear away the mild nausea that accompanied the inoculation. Strangely, Tony was right beside him.
“NO I will not! “ Steve shouted furthering his tirade. “I am a grown man and I can take care of myself or have you forgotten that? I don’t belong to you Tony, you can’t order me around, or did you forget that too?” Steve seethed turning around and tugging the collar of his suit aside to show his now slightly swollen, but very much, intact gland.
The alphas face softened. “I don’t care about that ok? Why don’t we forget about that and chalk it up to it all being birdbrains fault in the cosmic scheme of things. I’m more than ok with that personally. You should have something other than chips though.”
“No you won’t” Natasha quipped hopping into the one and only driver seat, “Haven’t you heard the term ladies first?”
Steve rubs the side of his neck absentmindedly feeling the warm smooth skin. The only scar his body hadn't rejected had been his bonding scar and now. Now it was gone.
Beck did not have a chance to answer, not with a hole the size of a fist shot through his chest courtesy of the suites new precision blast.
Steve lifted his head and tugged at the thick chains around his wrists, vabranium maybe?  His back was aching from the position but he wouldn’t tell them anything. It pissed them off to, every time he was asked anything about, Shield, the avengers, Stark Industries, hell even the weather. He just repeated the same over and over.
Taking a deep breath the ravenette stepped into the spacious closet. It was much grander in the tower than the one back at home in the cabin. Frankly, it reminded him of his room on Asgard. Not so much in the design but the grandiose feel of the place. Stark was not one to do anything by half. In a way, it was nice to be spoiled.
Steve stood but kept one hand on Tony’s shoulder as he maneuvered to fold and wring a rag with one hand. He had to keep touching his husband, had to ground the man because right now Tony looked so far away.  It hurt see him that way, one thing Steve never liked was feeling powerless and right now that’s all he felt.
First, they sliced off his clothes and doused him with ice water, perhaps, which was the one thing he hated in all this. That sudden rush of frigid water that made his heart pound in his ears with memories of crashing into the sea. Then the real world came back in a blinding color as a hand griped his hair and pulled his head back. A sharp blade slicing across his cheek, “TELL US OR WE WILL KILL YOU!”
“Thor good to see you!” Steve greets cordially and allows the alpha a brief hug, thankful that the god did not squeeze him.
He shook the thoughts away before easing his way out of bed. His nose wrinkling at the sensation of being naked in the tie back gown. He really needed to stop ending up like this, or at the very least have, a spare set of clothes in the quinjet.
“I’m fine Bruce thanks.” Steve grunted and forced himself up from the sofa.  “Just a little twinge, I’m sure the serum can take care of that.”
Loki looked down at the filth sodden floor. "I do not want to make up for anything. I cannot undo anything... I want it to end." His voice was raw and broken. The truth was there in the broken edges, the window to the hear of it as those words escaped like a whisper. "I want to die"
“Jerk”  Steve laughed, a hand unconsciously settling on his swollen abdomen. “I’m glad to see you doing so well, really glad Buck.”
Tony hadn't realized the cracks in his words or the tears that came until large warm hands wrapped around his back. “Tony, I know. I felt you go and it nearly broke me. Then seeing you but ...not. This is you, for days this is the first time it's been you. I've missed you so much do you know that? I couldn't bare the thought of losing you all over again, waking up here everyday and seeing you – but not the real you was like torture.”
Stark jumped at the chance to rip Hydra a new one and not just in the way Iron Man always had before. This time it was personal and brutal, there wasn’t going to be any thing left.  Stark was a man on a mission, Pierce thought his Asset was ruthless? The Winter Solider had been little more than a drone; Fury had a one man kill squad - Iron Vengeance readily available.
“Feeling a little hot under the spandex pretty baby. I could help you out with that.” He’s pressed up against me and damn it if I can feel my face burning.
Steven Grant Rogers, he was typical as far as omega went. Small, thin, kind and in the 1930’s there were few opportunities for a boy like him. He went to art school, since it was one of the few educational avenues available to omegas. Moreover, he loved escaping into the pages of his sketches, creating a world that was brighter and kinder than the one he was born into.
Now with a head clear of heat and under the unbiased and sober light of day, Steve felt like he‘d done something terrible. All those years of repression and self-internalized shame that mass drilled into him about pre-marital relations was bouncing around in his head. Sure times had changed and even back in the day, he had gotten close to crossing that line a time or two. Maybe if he had been healthy he really would have. Still, there was that doubt every time he looked in the mirror. He could almost picture the disappointment on his mothers face.
“Patch me through to Coulson, Sam any one…. Someone needs to get in there and find him.” Steve ground out before another crap coiled in his stomach.
Pepper felt a lump in her throat, there was nothing she could do for this and in a way, she believed in Tony‘s reasoning. Believed in his right to be angry, to be sad, and to hate everything for a while if he wanted to. Still, part of her would always love him and it was that part that wanted him safe. “You’re all Peter has Tony, I know it isn’t fair. I will protect him; I wish I could protect you to.”
Three years later, as Loki slept in there bed, and James looked down at the little bundle of blue blankets in his omegas arms - he knew they had made it out the other side. Through the pain and heartache, through all the tears and worry. They made it and they tired again. All those late nights and milestones, crossing their fingers and Loki’s fretting over every little kick and flutter.
Loki opened his misty eyes and smiled softly, his therapist had said one of the most beautiful things about growing up was realizing your parents were flawed. Realization that they where once just like you, scared and young and doing their best and in those good intentions mistakes are often made. The beauty in this is that you receive that lesson and theirs. You have the unique opportunity not to make their mistakes.
The gloves came off next; he needed to touch Tony, needed to feel his skin. “It wasn’t because I didn’t want to, as soon as I was awake…I thought” He swallowed the lump of fear that crawled up his throat. “I thought it happened again, I was so afraid that I would have missed 70 more years. That would come back and you would be gone or …or like Peggy was. Or that Peter would be an old man and hate me for leaving you both. I came to find you as soon as I could Tony, you have to know that.”  He said touching the inventors face.
“Go away!” He heard Darcy shout and now his sore chest felt even worse. Something was happening, and he wanted to push her away. Something..something...
The plans were final, Stark and Barnes would go in. Barnes taking point on ground infiltration, they had the warehouse plans and a rendezvous point. Coulson's team would be behind Barnes and run interference to get him in the building. Tony would work his way down from a roof access point and they would meet inside and secure Mallen and his group. Outside Sam and Natasha would be on standby should Hydra have anything special up their sleeves. After securing Mallen Barnes would circle back to find Madam Hydra.
“No I’m not,” Tony snapped and grabbed Steve’s hand, holding him firmly by the wrist. It was no secret Steve could have pulled away but he didn’t. Tony could feel him shaking,  he knew better than anyone what this felt like. To feel the world suddenly tilt and everything you believed become false. To look up and see someone you trusted trying to kill you. “I’m asking you to Steve.”
Steve signed and leaned into the offered shoulder of the metal clad alpha. It was over now; at least Skull didn’t have Bucky. It didn’t mean it was going to be easy from here but it was something.  He sagged slightly as the slowly made there way down the stairs. Tony’s arms wrapping around his waist and one hand coaxing his chin up.
Musing over motivations could wait however; right now, they just need to make it out of this alive. With luck, they might even weed through this onslaught and get into the warehouse. The problem was they needed a game changer and fast.
“It's earl gray, I have a preference for stronger blends.” Loki said, having returned from the kitchen with two steaming cups on a wooden tray. Ever the proper host. The cups were bone china with a fine filigree of gold vines.
“Less Loki? I'm not sure I follow.” She replied, drumming her fingers on the high curve of her stomach.
Once inside and alone Tony stood a few passes away and waited for Steve to take off his boots and shield harness. These were important facets of who the man was and Steve needed to shed this constructs before he could let everything go.
“Wonderful. Do you think?” Steve hesitated, he knew it was excessively soon to tell. They wouldn't know at least for another few weeks at best.
He wanted to believe the omega, but if he did that opened up a another set of complications. It's hard to save someone who doesn't want to be saved. For now, he had Jarvis monitoring Loki and at the ready to alert him should the man take a downward spiral.
“Check this one out, her name is Elda and her hobbies include: Watching reruns of Jag and bingo. Ever watched Jag Cap?”
Loki sniffed over his bowl of ice cream, he thought of Odin's words, how the old man had felt it a waste for Loki to entertain the Midgardian. How the All-father had plans in motion to marry Loki off to a noble family and then revel his species to all of Asgard. It was meant to heal the Jotnar in the eyes of the people. Well, Loki wanted no part of his -not fathers plans. There would be no way to wed him away if he was no longer chaste. “I...I want you, please alpha.”
Natasha even offered to help bring-in the shopping. Another helpful gesture that made the entire thing feel more domestic than James would have ever imagined possible. However, when she stood to follow him and gently patted Loki's hand, with out the former sniping at her.  That diminutive action had been enough to raise James' brow in question.
“Because it would be like Chihuahua attempting to mount a pitbull?” Natasha said before sipping her water.
When they finally reached the tower, Bruce of course was the first one out to check on them. Tony looked around for Steve or Pepper, hell even Natasha to be swift on the betas heels.
“Brucy, so nice of you to stop by. So how are things?” Tony spun around sipping his coffee, Irish of course…actulay more booze than coffee at this point.
She thought it over a moment, “Cherry blossom is a light cake flavor with a hint of salt. If you want something sweet but not bug your eyes out.”
Left alone with his thoughts, Steve knew this wouldn’t be over until all the cards had been played. He had heard the heavy locks on the door fall into place when Fury left. Nick was not a stupid man; he wouldn’t go to the trouble of locking doors that Steve could simply yank of the hinges.
Loki felt his spine chill from the mention of the avenger, perhaps a lingering reminder of having it crack on the penthouse floor of Stark's Gilded Tower. “I see, how fortunate for your students.” he said turning away. “If you'll excuse me.”
The road ahead was going to be a hard one maybe that was the story with every chapter life. The best things were never easy and the right things where always the hardest to do. Yet, it was worth it. Through all the sorrow and all the hurt, that Steve had lived through, he did not regret the time spent in those endeavors. Even now as he walled toward Tony’s lab able to hear the man speaking loudly to the bots about their ‘new little brothers or sisters’. Steve just shook his head; this was going to be a wild ride.
“Oh Steve I’m sorry!” She backtracked when Steve leaned forward with his face in his hands mumbling something about hormones and damn Stark.
Loki would have told his child anything to see that smile, to glean just a fraction of the sparkle in those big bright eyes.
“Of course, that’s my little princess.” The proud father took the baby girl as Jemma placed the little blue bundle in Steve’s Arms.
“You always have a much kinder way seeing life.” Loki said sitting down on the settee across from him.
“I wouldn’t ask ya to Bruce, I’m just saying… mm…” Steve stopped to rub at a harsh kick under his rib cage. “Damn…”
As the call, ended Tony was touching down on the balcony landing, the suit disassembling around him.
“Yeah… that’s great…ok so… lets get this show on the road right?” Tony made a move toward the door but Bruce stepped in his path raising a gentle hand.
Natasha pulled out her phone with a nod. “Clint, how’s it look?  Yeah.. Let’s just say the cavalries just arrived. Can you get me an ETA for Riverdale park?  Yeah that’ll work, oh and… see if you can get your hands on the Shield.. don’t ask just do birdbrain.” She snapped the phone shut with a soft smile.  “We roll out in 10, ever been to Kroyak mountains Cap?”
That’s where he found the cash of Love songs, all so sappy and unrequited like a fourteen-year-old girl. Still it was somewhat adorable; Tony told Jarvis to shuffle and play and got back to work.
The group had been careful, not using any names or terms that might give them away, to switching cars every few days. Obviously, they were paranoid or had made some of the previous agents tailing them. Both of which made watching them for little crumbs of information – boring and difficult.
The siren congratulated herself in such a fine find on this moonlit night. The spell itself had not been too difficult. The boy was only a few days old and his form was easy to manipulate with her magic. With those eyes and that darling little face, she knew exactly how to use the baby to her advantage.
The drive back to the tower was uneventful, usual traffic in New York. Familiar sights and sounds of the city welcomed her, the building and familiar facades of restaurants and shops passing by the tinted windows of the sleek black town car. Let it not be said that their Pack Alpha didn't believe in style and comfort.
She had a point, but was Tony worth the risk? Would Steve end up blaming him when all of this blew up in their faces. “I don’t know what to do Pep.”
“Alright spill it before I call Katniss in to come in there and tell you all about Phil’s last heat, trust me he loves telling and you wont want to know. Literally it’s like having acid poured in your ear and stirred with a drill.”
Barnes was allowed to go in and see his omega after Bruce had done the best he could to make Loki comfortable.
“Earth to spangles! I know I’m sexy but your pouring milk allover the table.”  He shouts at me. Oh, this is nice….
Steve hummed and eased his legs over the side of the bed. “Won’t be long now. I want to go ahead and move before I can’t.”
Maybe it was a touch too pessimistic a view, he would not argue that. However, when you find that the things you have always wanted are consistently dangled just out of reach – you tend to gain a less than Pollyannaish perspective on the world around you. You become accustom to disappointment and maybe that was Loki's greatest strength, he knew not to hope for too much. Having gleaned so early that he never was quite as deserving.
Didn’t that just twist Tony’s gut; he was never under the illusion that his father loved his mother completely. Howard cheated enough to prove that wasn’t true. Yet children want to believe that their parents love each other, or at least did at one time. It wasn’t as if Tony could look at Steve and see any similarities that could suggest Maria had been some sort of replacement. His mother was olive skinned with dark hair and pale blue eyes. She was different, in every way.
Something in Steve’s expression went cold, something that told Tony what he already knew was true. That Steve knew SHIELDS files were wrong and said nothing. Captain America wasn’t as virtuous as everyone believed.
Steve looked back at Tony lying so still in that hospital bed. "I can't leave him... He means too much to me."
In the following days Loki wasn’t giving much away but he did seem to take comfort when offered and even seek it out so James was hopeful that the omega would come around on his own time. Loki had even gone back to work and Barnes was back in training rotation at Shield. Life was headed back into the realm of restfulness, but of course, it couldn’t stay that way. When you're the worlds first line of defense against all that extra-ordinary shit that seemed to crop up out of nowhere, you didn't get to pick your days off.
Being here rather than home in the cabin helped to also separate the feelings in his head. Right now his home- only reminded him of countless days alone. The small tile bathroom left him with only memories of sitting on the chilly floor while staring aimlessly at a locked door.
That mental image seared into the back of his mind. Steve imagines what that must have been like. To be given the shield after his supposed death. Steve remembered back in the day when had stopped in the war office, watching them packing up dog tags to be sent home just behind the notification telegraphs. In some cases that was all that was left of some boys who died out on the battlefield. When their bodies couldn’t be retrieved. He could never forgive Fury for this. Even if the man had had the greater good in mind – this was too much.
Little Peter sat on his knee and looked at him with big glittering honey brown eyes. "Pweety!" The child cheered patting at loki's hair. This wasn't soo bad being complimented on his good looks and rightly so. "Pweety! Pweety Lady!!"
Loki sincerely wished he could still muster up the fortitude to hide behind snide remarks but he couldn't. All that time he spent carefully packing away his guilt and anger had only crippled him in the long run.
“No Rogers, I gave them a hero fighting for revenge; I gave them a cause and a man to lead it. You know all about that Captain, only there were no back dancers for this one.”
The cold creeps under his skin and Steve knows it’s not real, knows there’s no reason for it and his mind races.
That put Tony at some ease, not much realizing for those sensors to be damaged Steve would have had to take one hell of a hit. “Right ok, yeah ..Everything’s going to be fine.” He said more to himself, leaning down to place a kiss on Steve’s brow. “We’re gonna get you outta here and everything’s going to be fine.” He spoke softly hearing the quinjet approaching, Tony hadn’t wanted to risk carrying Steve because if the Alpha was honest with himself he was too shaken. Seeing Steve go down brought back memories that the inventor did not want.
The bottle however was torn from his hand by a large blonde. Thor looked at him not with anger put pity, which was worse.
The blond nodded pressing his face into the pillow and pressing his hips back. “Please..” he mumbled, wanting the release only his alpha could provide.
Honeyed words ring in his ears in the afterglow. These last few days had felt like heaven on earth and Steve didn't want to come down just yet. He rolled over and smiled at his alpha.
Thor and the rest of the family always liked to remind the raven-haired mer that he had been just as bad in his youth. Frequently the Queen would chuckle and say ‘He’s his father’s, you can tell by the trail of chaos in Anthony’s wake.”
“ You look thin, am I going to have to come to that fancy tower and make sure they feed you?” Kurt joked, his tail flicking nervously behind him. He truly had been worried for his friend.
Stark smirked wolfish and ground his hips down against his husbands. “You're right, I'm lying...big Tony.”
There was a time Tony would have scoffed at the idea of following rules, if anything he had been the type to tell you that rules are meant to be broken. Really the whole idea of rules where more-or-less, suggestions. Thankfully, Tony did manage to grow up over the years.  Finding at least a modicum of value in having some guidelines in life.
McCoy chuckled and opened up on of the gilded books. “Well then, Bruce it is. Now, I do hope Thor had these translated or we will have an even larger mystery on our hands.”
Bruce was just coming back from getting lunch  when he heard the Pa system on the roof hanger going at full blast. He assumed it was Tony up to something so he decided to see if his fellow scientist might want to come in for food. However, instead of blaring classic rock and a grease covered billionaire - Banner got something waaaaay better.
He just felt uncomfortable under that sure and steady gaze as the other man stood there in the door way. They hadn't seen each other in a while (Tony had been drink out after a particularly nasty encounter with his father which ended in the youth sloshed on cheek whiskey for days.) Pepper had covered for him while he sobered up enough to face Bucky.
Yet as Nick sat there looking at the framed vintage poster circa 1945 of Captain America ‘in memorial’ he had an epiphany.
Tony couldn't help but laugh out load when his mate flipped back the drapes with two excited pups hugging each leg.
Pepper cut in “Thor isn't a fan of exams either, or really anyone around here. I'm sure everything's fine. I mean...this is Loki – right?”
I didn't have time, and there wasn't even a body left to bury. Your soul was lost and my heart left to morn once again.
Empty sheets greeted his wandering fingers and that was certainly not right at all. Loki shouldn't be up at least for another hour. Tuesday Thursdays were his 9:00 to 2:00 pm scheduled day with office hour included. James had committed this to memory for his own peace of mind, it made him feel better being able to recognize where his mate should be during the day. That in mind, it was most likely around 6:00am – judging by the dusky light filtering through the curtains.
Tony smirked and climbed onto the bed. “Ah don’t worry marshmallow puff; I still think you’re sexy. Oh by the way!  Jemma left you this little beauty!” Tony fished a nursing bra for male omegas out of his pocket with a leering smile.
When thin little Steve stumbled out of the bathroom in that white satin slip his cheeks flushed from the booze and lips red with balm. The mumble of words in that little confession. “Please Bucky... I know I’m...I’m no dame but I... please Bucky...”  He should have said no but the whiskey said yes and then… well then he couldn’t stop because maybe he always wanted this. Maybe all those years he spent protecting Steve- all he really wanted was to pin the blonde down and take everything.
Loki took the box from her hands; she flicked her eyes down to the omega's hands. Nails perfectly glossed and trimmed, skin well tended and soft. Yet... there was a slight almost unperceptive tremble.
Hydra and their Allies could hide in a world where the masses stuck their heads in the sand. However, turning the anger of an entire nation on them, all in the name of vengeance. They would have nowhere to hide; no veil to conceal there acts when the public took their blinders off. Moreover, who better to tap into a world that ran on technology and social media, than a man who built the finest tech in the whole world?
They had been bonded for nearly three years now, and Pietro was ready. Things had been quiet for a while and if he was being honest, he loved watching Steve and Tony’s son. Peter was so cute and it made the omega yearn for child.
He promised, every time he left and suited up he always promised he'd do his best to come home. “M' sorry…m' so sorry.”
‘You love me right darling?’ she would say, stroking her hold fingers through his hair. Those smoldering blue eyes staring deeply into his, she was such a skilled Liar. Surely, she had put the silver tongue prince to shame with her greatest ruse.
“We found Stark's kid. Same said hopping out onto the expansive deck and looking back over the choppy water. “Steve's got the kid and is escorting him in. In a couple of shakes we'll be adding active support from above for the mermaids.”
“Oh shit Steve, fuck… are you really purring now? Is it Christmas…this feels like Christmas…?” Tony groaned rubbing a hand up and down the omegas chest. The fever had eased off and Steve’s scent was growing sweeter and heady by the moment.
Focusing less on the grace of Loki's movements and seeing them as usual, he watched them for what they were – practiced. He saw more this time – it was an act. A carefully crafted act but an act none-the-less. Loki no longer had an effortless air about him, each dismissive sign and fluid hand gesture seemed to take no much concentration. When had that happened?
The omega hesitated,  that would cost him. The Winter soldier grabbed the top edged of the shield as he dropped down - rearing back with a metal fist and striking the blonde squarely in the face.
The omega didn't seem to care enough to answer, just turned away and tried to curl up away from the Doctor.
Ok so, I know it’s been a min. BUT! This was a lot to write (srsly...longs as fuck) and I got shit to do, but yeah here it is! *wink wink nudge nudge* There will be sexy times  in this one, and more of my fake science.. well not all of its fake its just re-appropriated and bastardized for my purposes here. ANYWAY! I hope you enjoy this chapter and its all the steamy love that you have been waiting chapters for! As a side note to that, I was listening to a few songs while I was porning up this fic, lol. My musical inspiration for those scenes are as follows, feel free to check these out or let one roll in the background with you read. 1. Forevermore -by: Broken Iris, 2. Gorgeous- By X Ambassadors, 3. Lay me down - By Sam Smith.
“He’s…well, he’s … Okay, I’m not going to stand here and lie Prof. He’s not doing great. Better, but still not great.”
Taking a breath, the mortal turned away tacking his son into the small cabin and laying the squirming infant down.
He had been so sure that Tony was gone and it was as if part of his soul was dead and then... then Loki was there with that empty expression and cold tone saying they were fine. That Tony and Bucky were on their way back and everything was well. However, it wasn't well was it?
“Safe…oh yes I forgot, you are just so intelligent that that ample brain of yours surpasses all understanding. Tell me something Anthony, how safe was it when Darcy had her dorsal fin nearly mangled off last spring during one of your little adventures? Alternatively, Clinton’s broken arm when you were children, not to mention all the messes you have pulled poor Bruce into. Were your calculations perfect then?”
“Tony…..damn… just…” Steve unbuckled and pulled off his helm, tossing it to the side before prizing his fingers under where he knew the release catch fro the visor was. Hoping it would be the same on this armor as it had been on those before it. Sure enough, the plate released and he was looking down at Tony, there was a look of confusion at the action. The soldier smiled, “See, only I would remember how to peel you outta one of your tin cans… please Tony.”
He just wanted to help, just wanted to show his father something to make the man proud. Any little thing to show he was worth something.
“You need to talk to him, he’s hurting right now because you didn’t bond him and before you say anything I know why you didn’t. I’m sure you just wanted him to be sure and able to fully agree to something like that. It’s just how he was raised. Right now, he’s feeling a little worried that maybe it didn’t mean as much to you as it did to him. He really cares about you Tony.”
Another voice chimed in as Baldr’s wife swam up with her own little pup, “Mother is right, take heart that your new brother will guard her.” She smiled and laid a hand on Jane’s shoulder, “We need to go now before the catacombs collapse, there are those waiting for us and they will need their new Queen to lead them.”
Coulson paused, the mug halfway to his lips. “I know that May, look I'm fine with Loki. I know that sounds strange but he has been living in the tower and been around the kids. You've read the report the same as I have, he was controlled just as Clint was, even more so.”
Steve looked down and felt his heart stutter, he was as he once was. Thin limbs shaking in the blood soaked pajamas. “no…this isn’t” His voice failed and he looked up to find Stark now standing incredibly close, leaning into his face with those lifeless black eyes.
Below the waves the world was a kinder place,while it still harbored it's own dangers – those were dangers it's inhabitants could defend. While the world above was brimming with war and with that war came weapons, each more deadly than the last.
Peeking in once more on his alpha, still drooling into the pillow, The Captain gathered up his duffle bag headed down to the garage. Hopefully by the time he had the pups fed and a dozen of Tony's favorite pasties in hand, the alpha would be wake enough to handle them for the day when he dropped the little ones off and headed off to the Triskelion.
They left the theater pulling down their caps and shades, incognito Tony had said. Steve felt a little silly but didn’t mention it. That night Steve did come back to the penthouse- though nothing so scandalous took place and the pair of them slept in each others arms.
Stark looked up from his desk and ran a hand through his hair, “Yeah I know, hell, even I can't take reindeer games like this. Not to mention what this is doing to Barnes.”
By the time Steve was undressed Tony was already in bed with the covers  turned down. The brown-eyed Alpha was striped to a pair of boxers and tank top. Tony was laying there with one arm extended across the bed just…watching him.  With a single glance to the pillow, Steve took it at his next order, climbing in and pulling the blanket up.  For a moment, they just lay there sharing space, sharing breath. It was so intimate despite how non-physical it was.
Coulson looked over at the pair, noting the way the former mad prince was draping himself close to Hydras former Asset, clearly the choice to send Barnes to Asgard for treatment had some… unforeseen consequences. “So you two…”
“Damn would a hello kill you? You know I thought your generation was all about manners. Steve would be scandalized.” Tony replied on the other end of the line.
Tony didn’t reply to the AI, in his mind they were all against him now. He was just trying to do something right, to do what he needed to. Why couldn’t they see that?
“I know…” The alpha said peeling off his own shirt, the light of the reactor glowing and filling the nesting room with a soft bluish white hue. “I know.” He said again touching Steve’s face. “I’ll be honest babe, I’m scared shitless. I don’t know what kinda parent I could be and I don’t want anything to happen to you.”
Steve didn’t say anything, folding his arms waiting for what nugget of nonsense the other man had for him.
Looking equally frustrated, Bruce tossed his pen on the desk, “No, not that I can see. With the serums cell regeneration I don’t even thing a sterilization surgery would correct anything. Excising the gland is an option but typically, that’s  only done in cases of cancer because of the after effects. Any thing we do or give you is going to be running a gauntlet against your body.”
That made it worse, because perhaps that was another facet Bruce had already considered. If there wasn't an outside force causing the man such harm – then it was an inside one. Loki had done this to himself and had clearly been willfully neglecting his own needs for some time now. Weather it was a passive means of suicide or just poor habits due to depression that had gotten out of hand? That was the question. What was clear, was that Loki had fallen into a dark place. A place that even Bruce's medical expertise might not be able to pull him out of.
Pepper crossed her arms looking at the man as he tried to decide between several pairs of sunglasses in the hall mirror. “I would have thought a near death experience would have made you more responsible.”
Steve charged up the stairs, it was on the second landing when shots rang out just over his head. Glancing to the twin bullet holes in the wall then back up at the sniper - the captain felt his heart sink. “Bucky…”
"My name is Natasha. I think you know that. By the way, you look better with out that whole crazy glare going."  She smirked over her glass. "Drink?"
“Fair Jane has also brought me, Mighty yet not as impressive as these sugary delights.” Thor laughs as he seizes the sturdy box from her hands to place it lightly on the counter.
Steve fell back losing his footing and tumbling down the stairs, he flailed - the shield embedding into the wall and pausing his fall. Gazing up the other soldier was already descending the stairs, blade in hand.
Mouse in question flicked his tail and narrowed his red eyes. The other slightly larger brown mouse sounded as though it was laughing with little rapid squeaks.
Bruce took off his specials rubbing at the lenses, “I suppose so, I have a few tests to run and documents to look over. Maybe tomorrow sometime before I have any definitive ideas on anything though.”
That’s what Tony thought anyway, he figured if Steve had been awake, he would agree -given the raised gooseflesh on the blondes forearm.
The soldier gingerly walked out on his own, moving a bit more confidently in his strides. Tony assumed the blond would be well enough by the night if not by tomorrow morning.  Watching the larger man slide back into the bed Tony couldn’t help but wonder if now was the right time to say anything about the information he had. On the one hand, Steve couldn’t really run away from him. On the other hand, the man had been through enough right now without having to have his past thrown in his face yet again.  However, Tony thought waiting wouldn’t be ideal either, Cap was the kind of guy who would have felt betrayed if Tony had held that kind of knowledge. It would be harder coming out later.
Barnes wasn’t typically a worrier, though something about becoming a father had given him a healthy addition of caution. So far, the first few months had been easy for his omega, not much had changed in Loki’s habits - save for lessening in his use of siedr for common activities. There had been no sign of illness of fatigue in his alien lover up to then.  “Ok, go back to sleep baby doll.”
“Not finished Steve, now sit. Phil would you be so kind as to make some tea?” Pepper’s tone easily shifting from scolding to cordial.
Starks face washed with relief, confusion and a little irritation all at the same time. “Then what…”
He tried to shake off the feeling, of course, they hadn’t bonded. It was the first heat they shared, and why would Tony ever want to bond with him. Even if they could be together the public would think it strange since no one knew Steve’s true nature save for the members of their team.  Plus, Steve was…wrong, where the serum had given him so much it also mangled him in a way that he could never be like other omega…never give Tony what another omega could.  They knew that.
It was three weeks later when the avengers with there newest member - Thor’s reformed brother Loki, received a call to assemble.
“Steve!” Tony came barreling in the room “They said you were ok. God I was freaked out… You ought to know with your metabolism to eat when you get up in the morning, what if you had pulled that shit in the middle of a fight! Ya know how you’re always preaching to me about risks. Well…” Tony gestures wildly. It was somewhat cute to see him so worked up. “Risk Steve!” The alpha huffed out a few breathes before perching on the side of the bed and kissing his omegas forehead. “I’m serious…don’t do that, I have enough wrinkles these days sweetheart.”
When Stark made it back and climbed the stairs to his son’s nursery, he felt his heart breaking, all the more, Maria had spent so much time on this nursery. Entering the room, he noticed the chimed hung in the window, silver bells on delicate chains - she said they sounded like the whispers of angels.
“He's been turning cartwheels all day and spent a good two hours tap dancing on my bladder. So if you want to measure missing you by annoying me. Then yes, terribly.” Steve chuckled and felt himself relax under the welcoming touch. It was little things like this that made up for the hours he spent alone.
They dried off and Steve made no qualms about picking the other man up and setting him on the sink. Even if Tony did scowl at him, muttering about being manhandled. That was nice to, because if Tony was feeling up to his little jokes, he was clearly doing something right.
“You said, ‘I have never loved anyone or anything the way I love you, if ever anyone says I don’t have a heart their wrong…because its you.’ and I said  ‘ then I better be more careful, …”
Maybe they could find some peace at the end of all this, but not every member of the avenger family could, and hell hath no fury like a red head with time on her hands.
Charles smiled and folded his hands in his lap. “Yes, I suppose that is true but often it is those who challenge us the most whom we learn the most from.”
Natasha, having spotted the two from a distance, walked up to see if they were all right. Only to see something she. was not to sure about. “Thor…um, what’s that you boys have up your noses.”
“Right, yeah sorry about that. Ya know we could just start using that service that Stark does. I mean if they can stock the tower and the compound…”
Tony wanted to tell her it wasn't going to be fine. His chest felt like it was collapsing in on itself. “Darc..Darc I can't..”
Steve couldn’t help but feel partially responsible for that. Reading words that were laced with an affection he had never known, it made him feel…guilty.  That wasn’t all Steve was feeling though, he was terrified. If this was right... then who knew what would happen to him.
“Yeah I know, I just have this feeling you know.” He smiled to himself, it was like when he was carrying the twins. After he found out he had a feeling, this warm rightness that settled in his chest. It felt like sitting in the sun when you've been cold all winter or that first sip of coffee after a brisk run in central park. Maybe it was just wishful thinking.
The Ai chirped back completely ignoring his master’s ire, “There are also stairs Sir, perhaps a bit of cardio?”
A third ring of the bell made his jaw clench. Spelling himself out of the worn joggers and oversize shirt of his alpha and into something more fitting of his stature. If the Widow came to see Loki, she would damn well get her trips worth.
“Almost honey, god you look so good.” Tony said running a thumb over there joining then up to Steve’s little pucker to tease at the blonds rear. “Maybe I’ll go here next huh… Or do you wanna keep me right here.” he asked bucking his hips forward making the omega moan.
While making her way around, Natasha notices a female mer with what looks like an injured male of their species on her arm. This wouldn’t have drawn her attention except for one very noticeable feature. The young man’s chest…was glowing.
Natasha emerged from below deck with two totes over her shoulders. Swaggering across the creaking floor the redhead shifted the bags. “I say we give some of Stark's toys a try” she says tossing the bags up onto a table in the main cabin.
Paired with that look Cap was giving him. The "disapproval is over 90000" look. Wade knew something was up.
A large smile breaking across his face as he took a few hesitant steps toward the glittering mirage that slowly began to solidify. What a sight it was, all the glory or leather, green and gold. No one could say that his guy couldn't make a damn grand entrance.
This was not the first time Tony had gathered this little marry band of mer for some obscenely dodgy game. There was always ‘the next thing’ with Tony, he loved to try everything and push just far enough till something broke - often times that something was him.
When she entered the workshop, she realized that someone with their dark intention and beady eyes was already there.
Of course this offer had been extended with all thoughts toward kindness and chivalry, it was however accepted as a direct challenge. He really should have seen that coming.
“I see. “ Charles nodded thoughtfully. “ Might I suggest you come by the school and talk with Dr. McCoy. Hank has quiet a few interests including collecting documents on any and all topics. As they say two heads are better than one.”
James Barnes might not have been an Alpha, but when it came to Steve, he could certainly act like one. Reaching out to cup the slender Youngman’s face, he smiled. “I promise I’ll come back and ya know what? The Military said that betas with service records will be able to legally mate with omegas after the war so…so…” He fumbled over his words.
She inclined her head as the man came near and tugged the blanket aside just enough to see the babe’s eyes.
The task seemed easy enough and Peter was so ready to help. So sitting at the table and watching an egg timer seemed like an obviously important job. It would also leave Loki with his back facing the child where Peter couldn't see his face.
Natasha nodded and they engaged the door. The captain stood taking a step forward as the wide bay doors opened. He could see Tony, that black armor standing out like ink on a page in the frozen landscape. He had to believe that this would work, that he could get through to Tony somehow.
Her hand shot out grabbing an angled wrench, before Howard knew what was going on the metal slid in front of his wrist and swiftly pulled his hand away. Out of reflex, he pulled the trigger, the bullet embedding into the ceiling as Peggy grabbed for his hand. She was quick taking the gun from him and soon had Howard on his knees with his hands behind his back. He screamed at her to let him go but she didn’t, she just kept telling him how he was going to get through this, how she wasn’t going to let him die.
The volume lowered as the AI’s voice came over the Lab’s sound system. “Sir, a notification has come in concerning Captain Rogers.”
AN: Ok so because I destroyed your hearts I thought I’d pick this back up and mend all the painful lil bits.  Just for ambiance, I wrote this listening to Wax Audio mash up (Beatles/Massive Attack)  “Golden Teardrop” something about it really resonated with me for the scene with Loki and Bucky .
“I know..” Her voice strained and it broke him into a thousand pieces. “I saw the news...their calling you a traitor.”
Treading carefully, the alpha took a seat. His shoulders slumping under the steady blue gaze across from him. “Steve I...I'm not okay. I know that but...I wouldn't take it back. I didn't want to die there and miss out on all this. Please understand that I never meant to hurt you I just wanted to come home. I was so afraid...”
The Asgardian promptly began plating their dinner as his mortal poured two generous glasses of delicious wine. Loki spied the full glasses and naturally wondered if he should have more than one tonight and perhaps later come to James with a unique desert in mind.
Suddenly, Steve was reminded why he hated hospitals, being shot had been a walk in the park compared to this. Then he had to write down everything he remembered about his medical history. that took eleven pages, and by the end when Tony read it over, the alpha looked white as a sheet and asked him why he ever left the house.
He didn't have friends, not really. Loki simply found himself in the orbit of Thor's friends. The only lengthy conversations he may have had, had been with chambermaids or the occasional chatty palace guard. However, that wasn't the same as having a friend.
“Jane and Thor I think took her to your mom for now.” Bruce thought that if Loki was concerned about his pet or even missed the animal that was a good sign. “I'm sure once you're feeling better you we could arrange something. Maybe you and James could even go for a visit.”
Steve lifted his palm to look at the little makeshift bandage. “I hope you’re feeling better. I brought you all some dinner by the way. It’s not much but I think between the four of us we will be ok.”
“Tony, we aren't bonded anymore…don't you get that? I'm so happy you're here I am but, it's like I don't even know you.”
Somehow, Peggy just couldn’t believe that Howard had finally snapped. Though now seeing the smashed liquor bottles that littered the foyer and main staircase. She could see how it looked. She knew that from the outside looking in that this place reeked of whiskey and madness. All she felt on the contrary was sorrow.
Steve found him self-breathing heavily as Tony took him in hand.  For a moment, the inventor just knelt there stroking him slowly.
“In position.” he spoke quietly, crouching behind a shipping container – the heat from the metal soaking in past the layers of Kevlar to warm his skin. Taking a look around the large unit’s edge, he could spot the movement of shadows in through the warehouse's grime covered windows. Two guards patrolling the west hall, neither man making chitchat as they marched dutifully, back and forth passing the windows. Once the distraction was in place both men would likely exit through a side door 20 feet ahead of the window. This would take away the blind spot given to him by the container should they glance to the gate.
“Is this what you want then?” He shrills throwing his hands wide ending his falsehood. The room is still tidy though less than perfect. She cannot understand why going to the trouble of hiding a bit of dust or a haphazard pile of unguarded papers. Maybe he just couldn't bear not having everything perfect. In truth, those sorts of things would have made her far less suspicious. Worst about all of these lies isn't the home, but Loki himself. Seeing him clearly, now she realized this wasn't the man that had invaded New York, or even the man who returned with Barnes. This was someone else, a man worn to the end of his rope with nothing left to give. The logical question would be to ask how James hadn't noticed this.
Steve remember the last fight, Tony's face..the letter he left. It was thin half assed apology and he hoped Tony would just call but he never did.
The soft scurrying of tiny-clawed feet scratched inside the walls before three little balls of fur dashed out of a small crescent shaped hole in the baseboard.
“I should hope you have the decent to allow me to collect my things before you go and report my failings.”
Pepper’s expression melted from anger into worry as she glassed over her shoulder. That suddenly left Tony feeling cold as the woman chewed on her lower lip for a few beats.
“Right, Loki. This isn't something you can assign blame to. Your feelings are valid and should be treated as such. You have undergone some very traumatic experiences in the last few years and are only now starting to find a place to feel safe in. I know you are feeling stress from trying to conceive but the most important thing right now is giving yourself time. I know hearing that might not seem helpful but from everything we've studied it may be the only answer.”
“Bucky, .James…” Steve blushed; he still didn’t understand what Bucky saw in him. The older boy could have his pick of any of the lovely betas in their neighborhood. There were even a few female alphas who had made their interests known in Barnes. It never seemed right to Steve that his friend was so stuck on him.
“That's very sweet honey.” Steve said and placed a kiss on his sons head before taking a seat at the table.
Tony jumped when he thought he saw a rat scurry along the baseboard. All the while Loki simple lit an oil lamp and collapse into one of the less worn old settees.
This entire time of course, Tony had been going over in his head what a horrible father he was going to be, how Howard had been distant and even at the best of times little more than tolerant of his presence. He could count on one hand the times his father said
He was polite, but distant and when Xavier asked, he declined to aid in the X-men's activities. Teaching was one thing, but he had no wish to pledge himself to any cause, he wouldn't spend any more of his life being a soldier under anyone's banner. Not Odin's, not SHIELD or the Avengers, and not the X-men. That wasn't to say he would walk away from a fight. Loki had been very clear with the professor that if the school was ever at risk, he would protect the students with his last breath.
Tony nodded and helped as best he could to ease his pregnant mate onto his feet. Steve breathed through his nose as they made their way around the bed heading toward the nesting room.
“Let me try Virginia.” Phil interjected taking a step toward the door. “Steven, It’s Phil.. Listen I know you thing this is a terrible thing but I can tell you from an omega prospective I think its great. Thing of all the kids out there that look up to you, I know if the truth had been out when I was a child it would have meant even more to me as far as omega empowerment is concerned. Why don’t you open the door and we can all sit down and talk about this. Ok cap?”
Simmons was not laughing, “No, actually I  wanted to make sure that you both understand the risks associated with Mr. Rogers’s unique physiology.”
Now the raven-haired prince looked out on the vast hidden kingdom of Asgard and felt nothing but hate. Nothing but cold churning rage in his belly. They did not want him, but she had…even if it was for nothing more than a plaything. Did they all know that? He suspected as much, he had been the laughing stock of court many times before - but now. Now he would never be able to show his face. The trickster had fallen for a trick. Some would call it just deserts, others would call it penance. Despite any ill action Loki had inflicted upon another, he never went as far as this. Never dug those liar claws in so deep that the wound would never heal.
The most surprising support came from the silent couple on the other side of Natasha. Clint and Phil.  Barton wiped at his eyes, maybe he understood better than most. Despite his past feelings about Loki, having seen the omega looking more like a ghost as of late had changed his perception. Loki wasn't this thing of nightmares that his mind had supplied, he was just damaged. That was cold hard truth of it, Loki was damaged just like the rest of them – he just hid it a lot better.  “We'll all keep an eye on him. You need some time to yourself to work through your own stuff. “
Tony’s hands were so much larger in the armor; Steve hesitated for a moment before resting his own there. The metal articulated gauntlet shifted and curled harmlessly around his fingers.  It seemed…warm in a way, maybe by the energy that flowed just below the surface.
AN: So.. I saw this line in a panel featuring a reincarnates kid Loki and Thor. It was so feelsy and this just came to me.  Incidentally I was listening to 2cello’s cover of Hurt while writing this so if you have that handy for the read I recommend it.
There were more pressing matters at hand however than what was going on in the mind of James Barnes, perhaps after all of this was over it would be time to bury the proverbial hatchet with the other half of the Barnes household. Until then though, Phil had work to do.
The wake of victory the country would mourn the loss of another hero; they would all believe the narrative passed down that the brave young, Alpha, Steve Rogers. Gave his live to save the world from the destruction brought about by evil. Because that was the story they wanted in those days. It was the only story that would have been accepted. So that was the story they told.
“Tony watch out for those tanks and take out that torrent!” Steve crouched behind his shield as the bullets sprayed the snowfield.
