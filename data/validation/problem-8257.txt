He couldn’t hear, but could see his Pappy teaching Harley how to properly punch. A memory surfaced as Steve drifted off for a moment.
? Just cause she wanted a maternal figure right now?
“My dad’s home!” she whispered harshly, kind of defeating the purpose.
"Goodnight wonderful parents," she said with a smile as she turned to go to her room. He turned back to Steve who was smiling fondly at their kid, eventually turning back to look at his husband. A wicked smile spread across the taller man's face as his blue eyes suddenly got darker.
"It's so cute!" Helen piped in as she reached over to high five Pete. "Well done!"
“Oh sweetheart, you can call me Sarah. Or Mom.”
Emerson fell asleep in his lap on the plane ride home, mostly because the genius had forced her to and she eventually gave up and fell asleep. Steve was putting Miles to bed as Peter nodded off in his chair, the blonde tucking a blanket around him as well before he made his way back to his husband.
When they were alone, the man’s demeanor changed.
“Steve, say one bad thing about me.”
“Sucks not being the cute one anymore, huh?” Bucky teased their sister, who maturely stuck her tongue out at the Alpha.
“I can't fucking believe–” Steve started.
She shook her head no, not wanting to hate the man who accepted her from the beginning.
"This the blonde?" Steve asked, stiffening Daci further when she realized her father had talked to Steve about the woman. She also turned and noticed Clint scowling and taking a few more drinks of the alcohol.
The one he’d heard about from Tony early on - who explained how toxic his ex was and how she’d only been after his fame and money.
“I invited them,” Tony said from behind him, carrying a sleeping Peter in his arms. The Omega carefully passed the pup to the older Omega, who cooed and walked over to sit on the couch.
“Slow down, son. What do you mean she…are you sure…” he looked up into his husbands eyes with a fear Tony had never seen before. “Emerson’s been taken,” Steve said to him before turning back to the phone to try to calm their frantic son, who Tony could hear several feet away. He felt his heart stop, the wheels in the genius’ brain no longer clicking as he couldn’t process Steve’s word. Taken? Who on Earth would take…
Emerson pulled away from his embrace, still teary eyed as she smiled at him.
Clint brought his hand up and began signing
“Well, that’s very sweet Petey. But not everyone has step-parents. And I love that I get to share that day with Daddy, it just reminds me I’m your father too. Plus your Daddy is spoiled enough and needs to learn to share…” he teased. Pete laughed in the backseat, getting a chuckle from Steve as well.
She didn’t need anyone protecting her.
“Rogers,” Fury said quietly, waiting for Steve to look at him before continuing. “You’re one of the best medics out there, being gay doesn’t change that nor does it deserve any judgment from your coworkers. Although off the record, I am judging you for your choice in partners,” he finished with a smile, getting a laugh from the blonde.
“Woah, what’s wrong Jo?” Kristen asked with concern.
“Yeah, they’re alright for younger siblings,” he teased.
And he never wanted to find out if she was ever actually serious about that particular threat.
"You'll have fun, babe," the blonde said as he grabbed the jumpsuit for his husband and held it out to him. His love grumbled but grabbed the suit to wear, making sure to add an over dramatic sigh. He leaned in to kiss his love's cheek before whispering in his ear.
“Tiberius,” Tony said flatly back, or at least he hoped so…he’d had a few drinks, before leaning into Steve’s side. The man blessedly wrapped an arm around his waist, which he also noticed Ty’s face form a frown from that.
The braver of the men reached a hand out, resting on her shoulder before he lowered the strap on the dress she was wearing. Luckily, her self-deprecating thoughts were interrupted by a familiar voice.
look.
did!” Tony called to the ceiling, confusing the blonde further. But then something poked up above a desk in the corner, and Steve found his curiosity growing.
Best New Years, EVER.
“Hey!” Tony giggled out, playfully squeezing their hands together. “I seem to recall someone requesting to see me in yoga pants…” Steve yanked his hand away, though he was still smiling. “I’m kidding!” Tony said with that gorgeous laugh of his as he grabbed Steve’s hand once more. “How did it go with your bestie?”
“No…”
Her Tati had been showing her the English Alphabet, and she suddenly had the urge to learn how to write on top of learning how to read.
I can’t believe I said anything. I shouldn’t have, it’s not like they can do anything about it anyways. Maybe then can? They are two badass superheroes. And they seem genuinely interested in our well being. Pssh. Probably just a guilty conscience …her intrusive thoughts stopped abruptly as the door to the guestroom opened, revealing Tony and Steve. They came in and sat on the bed with her, Steve holding a small tub of ointment in his hand.
,” he said with a small snarl towards the blonde Alpha, knowing he never arrived on time to a thing in his privileged life. He couldn’t help but actually snarl a little when his ex just scoffed at that.
“Oh damn, that sucks.”
“Baby boy is that what this is about? You had a bad dream about your Daddy?” Tony cooed to the toddler who nodded his head yes while rubbing his face in Tony’s chest. Peter reappeared and joined the others on the couch, sitting on Tony’s other side and cuddling close to his brother.
“I think he likes it,” Steve said, feeling warm all over and desperately wanting his mate here to enjoy this moment. “Should we go tell your Grandpa and Nonna to come meet Peter?”
“I convinced him he was worth it,” Steve said with a smile.
“Sir is currently in his lab passed out on the floor due to the copious of amount of alcohol he consumed this evening.”
"Mama said color doesn't matter. She said it doesn't matter if they're different colors, or different religions, or if its two mommies or two daddies. As long as my new family loves me and lets me be me," he finished with a smile and a bounce - obviously having memorized what that amazing woman told him on repeat.
“Isn’t the kid gone? You should take advantage of that and have fun for once, Rogers. I’m serious, I’ll be your wingman if you need help finding some good pussy.”
He laughed a little as his own joke like the dork he was, glad to see Dr. Chase had already moved to exit and didn’t see him.
“Her and her friends jumped you, didn’t they? Lord knows you could have handled that little cunt on your own…” Tony said, trailing off as he looked deep in thought; Steve threw a glare his way for the unpleasant word.
They agreed to wait until Peter was asleep before going to Joey’s room to talk to her. The boy had asked for his Daddy to put him to bed that night, his husband quickly obliging as Steve made himself busy cleaning up the kitchen. Jo was already in her room, where she’d been most of the evening, so Steve tried to be patient as he finished wiping the counters down.
One final punch had the door break under Hulk’s fist, eliciting an excited noise from the giant.
Tried – as in before she could do so a certain super soldier lifted her off of the stool and proceeded to throw her over his shoulder.
Joey realizes something that suddenly makes her feel worse.
He looked up at the older man, partially wanting to tell him to fuck off and partially thinking he had a point. It helped that the man was being so lenient about his actions.
When she was ten, she remembers asking her Dad where the rest of her family was. He was confused by the question, glancing at her in the rearview mirror as he drove her home from school one day.
“Harry?” he calls out, realizing he hadn’t heard any groans in a minute. But then he heard another groan that caused the teen to breathe a sigh of relief. Which only exacerbated the pain.
“It’s cute! Your dad obviously loves you…Joey, right? I’m Helen, Helen Cho,” the brown eyed beauty said while extending her hand out in greeting. Joey returned the gesture, praying her palms weren’t as sweaty as she was imagining.
Twenty minutes turned into an hour...and a half. But the genius eventually had the boy back in bed knocked out next to him; Tony grateful as his own eyes slowly closed.
“I...I’d love that,” Tony said, wringing his hands adorably before pulling his phone out and handing it to Steve to put his number in. After they exchanged their numbers and before they could say anything else, the pup was running back with an ice cream cone in his hands.
“Is it okay? I wasn’t trying to imply…” his insecure husband began before Steve shook himself of his senses enough to close the gap between them and kiss that brilliant man. After a moment he pulled away and leaned his forehead against his love’s.
"Peter, I love you. I'm sorry if these last few months have been weird. Some of it was actual missions, but some stuff I had to figure out and while I was doing that, I also worked on planning this entire thing.
“Where are my favorite nephews?” Tony’s oldest friend in the world asked as he made his way into view, arms full of presents for the kids.
Emerson shrugged a little, unashamedly smiling back at him.
“I...I swear I haven’t pressured Clint into anything like that!” Bucky interrupted, shouting in panic at the thought. Cheryl just put a hand on his shoulder and squeezed gently.
“Hm…maybe I should go with you to make sure you don’t get scarred for life?” the genius offered.
“Yeah, I’m just being silly. Your name was her first word, I’m just jealous.” Daci stared at him in confusion with a quirked brow.
“No,” he smiled and poked her in the side. “I missed you too much, only made it five weeks,” he said, cheeks turning a little pink at the confession. She felt herself blush a little as well, hating herself a little for ever doubting how much he loved her. She instinctually turned to curl further into him, preparing herself to ask him what’s been bothering her.
He found himself chuckling fondly when Steve turned around to offer her a piggyback ride in reward for her behavior, the family ignoring the shouts as their friends helped them finally exit the hospital.
Again, how fucking selfish was she to want a mom when these two literally cleared their entire day to stay with her? She had already considered the possibility of having the ‘c’ word or at the very least a tumor…and knew she would just be a mess physically and emotionally today.
“So,” his Dad began as Peter turned around to face him, “you wanna talk about the fight you had with your husband?”
to be here,” she choked out a few more sobs before continuing. “…I’m sure you guys feel differently now and want to talk about putting me up–”
“Mama,” Tony said quietly. “I’m sixteen, I’m not ready to have a kid.”
“Oh Buck,” he said fondly, walking over to his brother and clasping a hand on his shoulder. “You should know better than to try and negotiate with terrorists.” Bucky reached for the leftover bubbles, scooping up a large handful and smashing it in the blonde’s face.
“Because you’re...incredible, Clint. Because you’re strong, and kind, and sexy as hell. And yeah, we’re young and dumb...but I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life. And besides, this way you’d have more access to me in the army, better insurance...tax breaks,” James ended with a chuckle that had the blonde joining in.
“I’m so proud of you bambino! How excited were you when Poppy picked you up from school?”
She dragged herself out of bed and used her adjoined bathroom to get ready, considering just asking JARVIS but honestly a little too tired to care. All she knew was that it wasn’t her wife.
“Just let me mourn in peace, Pop,” she said, unable to see the blonde throw his hands up in exasperation.
“Mazeltov, Tony!” the doctor called as Tony left to drive to Steve’s apartment.
of their educations by using what tiny power you have to manipulate their grades? Cause I looked over her essays and exams, you’ve been cheating her of her grades.”
“What’s life without a little magic?” Thor asked before pointing to the door, the crowd cheering as Rumlow finally stumbled out and away from them. After he left, Thor turned to Clint and James with a sad expression. “I’m sorry about that, friends, I hope he hasn’t ruined your fun.”
Tony wasn’t a superstitious person, having grown up around science, but he wonders if that was something Ty was capable of doing…his thoughts are interrupted when she buried her face back in his neck.
“Excuse me? I have plans with -”
“You bastard…”
“Joey
“I’m here for the weekend!” Peter shouted excitedly as he ran to jump into Steve’s arms. The blonde caught him, but not before he got a bony knee to the stomach. Joey groaned next to him as he felt her shift away on the couch, the blonde kissing his son’s cheek in greeting and withholding his own grimace in favor of hugging the boy.
“Um…” she started, looking back and forth wearily between the two. “Cara?”
"I don't know what you're talking about, I don't see any Jamie here," he said teasingly as his grandson laughed and his daughter simply glared at him.
“I didn’t ask, but the timeline between…Samantha’s death and hers seems like enough to plot a fake overdose to escape…plus she didn’t really offer any other explanation.”
“Daddy!” he heard Harley call as he quickly went back to the living room.
Oh yeah, those drugs definitely kicked in.
“And what’s that?” Cheryl asked, genuinely curious and not sounding judgmental.
A door opening caused Tony to swiftly turn to what he hoped was everything he had wanted, smiling at seeing his husband walking in.
“Wait, what did she just say?” Clint asked with concern, or at least it sounded like it, since her eyes were shut tight as she willed the tears to stop. She felt gentle hands on her shoulders, recognizing her father and jumping into his embrace.
“I don’t like this,” the blonde said before turning back to his husband.
“Now, with Steve…I’d probably be a bottom…” he continued.
And she didn’t even do anything wrong this time!
you dumb fuck. Stevie you coming or not?” Steve took that opportunity to turn back to Tony who was smiling at the interaction.
“No, I’m sorry Jo, I should’ve been more supportive…” Xavier said quietly.
Steve opened his mouth for an apology, but then changed his mind as she continued throwing horrible slurs their way. He turned his back to them and made his way back to the car, hand clutching around the bottle.
“Aren’t you the same man that fell flat on his face from the rings last week?”
After everyone had finished their breakfast and gotten dressed, Steve drove them to a barber shop Sam had recommended. The man had offered to do it himself, especially since he "finally had a kid who loved him." But Steve wanted Miles to have the experience, plus they could also do Emerson's hair. Win win.
She didn’t listen to either.
“Sorry! It’s just…it’s been a while since I’ve seen you Uncle Phil,” he offered as he gave him a one armed hug before joining his dads on the couch. “I thought you were off planet for a while?” he hoped his voice sounded normal.
“I don’t think I understand what’s happening…”
“Jesus, you okay Joey?” he asked as he pulled the teen back to look into her eyes. She nodded yes, though her eyes told a different story, which brought her right back into the genius’ clutching embrace.
What also did not help...was the boy’s reaction upon hearing this.
He couldn’t help smiling all the way to Peter’s room.
“Well...honestly parenting is hard and sometimes...it feels like I need a break, you know?” Tony froze in his tracks, fear shooting up his spine and paralyzing him. A break, he wanted a break.
"Please do not bring my children any more weapons," the genius said as he gave their friend a look. Thor smiled sheepishly as he shrugged his shoulder in response, clearly not promising anything. Steve guided the group back to the living room, unsurprisingly finding the two in their original position.
“Oh? ...should I come back?” Steve asked, very confused.
“What?! No Daci no,” the blonde said, followed by the sounds of the couch creaking. She pulled away from her father to look at the blonde with hope. “Kiddo, that was on me. And my dumb...ness. Of course I don’t hate you. You can hate me though, for asking you to do that.”
“Daciana!” Tati barked out, anger written across his face. She wasn’t thinking when she broke the rule of no powers in public. She just wanted to make sure nothing bad happened to Peter.
She could fix this. She knew she could.
“Well, then I’m glad. I like her too,” she said sincerely as she watched Morgan push the white stuff around. “She sure likes baths,” she added with a frown.
“Steven Rogers...you are not calling me a goddamn cannoli!”
“He’s not worth it, Steve. Come inside, your mate and pup need you.”
“How’d you do that?” Peter intrigued.
“Why are you assuming I’m dating someone?”
“Okay, can I be Josephine Renee Rogers-Stark, then?” she asked. Instead of responding, he quickly wheeled his chair back around his desk to type some things up on his computer.
Tony had explained to Harley what ‘bonding’ meant, frowning at the pup’s glare and sudden outburst. He had taken that attitude with them as the three went to Tony’s childhood home.
“Save whatever paint we have leftover and I’ll show you just how
“Oh, I am well aware of that,” Wade said matter-of-factly, drinking more of his punch.
“I need to apologize for what happened and…everything else,” she said sincerely to Joey after sitting across from her at the small table.
, literally told me she wanted
"Bring her over," Klaue said as they followed orders. She groaned in pain as they dragged her over to the man, sitting her in a chair with her hands still painfully tied behind her back.
So Steve stood there looking at Tony hungrily as the shorter man slowly brought the shirt off his broad shoulders and rested it on the counter next to them.
“Yeah,” he muttered in disbelief, thinking about earlier in the week when his foster son literally told him to ‘fuck off.’ He felt his Pop squeezed his shoulder in comfort as they heard voices approach.
He took a deep breath before continuing.
Well, at least to Peter. To anyone else he was still his smart-ass self, currently wise cracking as the two walked up to the Tower to join the family for dinner and game night.
Before she could leave the bathroom, she heard a window open in the bedroom. She looked out wearily, wondering why Jarvis hadn’t set off any alarms. Her eyes widened as she saw a figure
Steve only chastised him once, but Tony used that momentum to quickly propel them out of the car, into the hotel and up to their room.
He knew what it was like to have an abusive father…something they unfortunately shared.
Instead all eyes suddenly turned to the sound of a gun cocking - where grandma Helen was holding a twelve gage on the top step.
She’d been with them about four months at this point. As luck would have it, everyone was home this Sunday afternoon which prompted the four to watch a movie. Tony sat in the corner of the large “L” shaped couch, hogging the best seat, Em noted, with his tablet in his hands. Emerson was sitting on his right, straightening the blanket out to share with Tony, who gave her a quick smile in gratitude. Steve, who surprised both Tony and Em with a “seat check,” was in the bathroom while Peter came in to join them, popcorn in hand.
“Whatever you need, kiddo; whatever it takes to prove to you that you aren’t going anywhere. Your Stark-ass is stuck right here with me…and you are a
“’m no better than’m” he slurred as Em came back to his bed side, her eyebrows furrowed in concern.
“Yeah there’s good reason for that,” he said as he made his way around the couch to join her. As he was plopping next to her, they heard the elevator ding. They stole a glance at each other before they heard quick tiny footsteps and greeted the energized child.
“Hey Joey!” Cara said with a smile as she brought the kid half-way to meet her.
“You know...I don’t know why he would say something mean like that. I think Tiberius might be jealous of Steve since he gets to be around you all the time. He’s also an old fashioned Alpha and probably doesn’t know how progressive Steve is. I can’t tell you, baby. But what I can tell you, is that I love you, Steve loves you and your little brother or sister will love you too.”
“Papa always keeps his promises,” the boy happily hummed.
“I’m not pretending anything, Leonardo. If I didn’t care, I’d let you go,” he answered with gritted teeth, tears forming in his eyes when the boy started crying for real and just continued with his harmful accusations.
What did Steve have?
As his step-pup asked for more stories, the Alpha found himself feeling more love for his mate and son, and how well they got along with his family.
“And you?” he said in anger, pointing a finger at his daughter. She could literally see him bite his tongue in restricted fury. “Get your ass home and to your room, while I have words with Mr. Anderson here,” he finished with his arms crossed.
“You know I didn’t make it the whole three months, right?” he asked her as she looked confused back up at him. She was six at the time, so however long it took to see her uncle again was basically a lifetime…hearing he didn’t make it the three months was new.
“Is it making rules though if we’re just addressing the emotionally scarring elephant in the room?” Emerson said with a tease.
“Calm down, Batman. That’s not justice, it’s revenge. Which, Pep, remind me again why we’re stopping him?” his less-obnoxious and way smarter friend pointed out.
“I told him about how you taught me,” Em spoke up, smiling fondly at the man who was smiling warmly back at her.
She didn’t respond to the knock, staying curled in on herself and only bringing the blankets over her head as she heard her bedroom door open.
“DUM-E, this is Steve, Steve, DUM-E,” Tony said as he waved a hand between them. Steve stared in wonder a moment longer before reaching a hand out to the claw, chuckling when the curved metal prongs gently curled around his hand in greeting.
“Tony...wait you’re suggesting I go?” Steve asked him curiously after chiding his husband a little.
“Relax kid, you’re in my neck of the woods,” the man quipped, walking around him to check the kind of weapons the men had and grab his stick back.
“Okay?” she asked again, brows raised and hands on her hips.
“Alright, first of all, you know I consider Harley as my own. And yes, it seems
She threw a glare his way, glare deepening when a group of passing girls laughed at that. Xavier threw her an apologetic look before leaning closer to her. She waited for the nosy girls to keep moving before answering him.
“He made it as far as our house,” Steve explained to Tony, enjoying the way his brown eyes sparkled when he laughed.
“Please?” she asked, putting her bottom lip out like she had seen the Stark children do to get their way. It worked immediately, the archer conceding with a huff before leading the way to the weapons area.
Her thoughts were interrupted by the crinkly old bastard in front of her slamming his hands on the table to get her attention. Fucker knew she had PTSD, laughing at her slight jump from the noise.
FLASHBACK
“No you’re right. You caught me. I’ve been lying about being gay all these years. I secretly love vaginas,” he deadpanned. “And also wear porn-staches in my spare time.” His husband finally burst out laughing from that.
“I’m sorry Bambi, my memory must be failing me. Did I not already tell you this? You’re grounded.”
” Natasha said through the comms.
“That’s weird,” Tony pointed out, Jo nodding with him in agreement.
She soaked in Cara’s words as she walked to the elevator. She sounded genuine in her apology and kept the rest of the conversation light as she took them to the arcade next door. Joey kicked her ass in skee ball. That thought brought a smile to her face as she watched the numbers go to up to their floor.
“I didn’t think you even knew what pokemon was?”
“Is the
That's when she heard strange voices coming from somewhere in the lab. She grabbed her brother and hid behind a table, having taken a glance and seen white men that definitely didn't belong there. White men with strange looking weapons and explosives started filling the lab. She heard a familiar voice, unable to place it as the sounds of machinery winding up overtook the room.
All he had to do was convince his dads that putting off college for a few years
about the baby,” Tony said, pointedly looking at the man who simply smiled back at him.
“Hi Steve,” Daci said as she walked around him to see what he was making. She stood on her tippy toes but she was still too short to see what was on the stove.
“Careful, you’re a-hankering for a spanking there my friend,” the vigilante said as he waved the knife in Peter’s general direction.
to me. So…apparently I can’t escape the phrase between fathers,” she said with a smile in reassurance. Tony looked like he actually might cry this time, before surprising her and throwing himself at her in a bear hug.
“Uncle Bruce?” she asked as she gently squeezed his ankle. The scientist stirred a little, eyes blinking open before he jerked awake. “You’re okay Uncle Bruce.”
"I love you too, sweetheart," the blonde said with a smile as he handed her a warm towel. Her Tati returned a second later and couldn't dodge the full body hug from her Daddy, who now got the brunette wet. They laughed and changed and soon enough she was snuggled between the two on the couch for movie night. But she must've fallen asleep, cause the next time she woke up, she was in her bed.
“She came to apologize…and to…tell me she forgave me.”
!” she hissed as she chugged the water jug close to her.
“Will you help me talk to her? Maybe explain sometimes the people that are supposed to love you just…don’t?” he asked, wincing a little at the implication. They both knew he was talking about Howard and Steve just always felt bad even mentioning him.
“But, you’re so hot?” he said as James’ brows shot up, looking the blonde up and down before scoffing at him.
Tony laughed fondly when he heard his husband scoff at his tactics, watching the two teens blush red without looking at each other.
“Yeah…um. I’ll be home in…thirty minutes?”
Then there was an explosion in the lab.
"I like you, Emerson. I've liked you since I met you three years ago.
“Sorry, it’s just…please don’t make me stay with her again,” she pleaded to the two. “I thought Pop was an old fashioned grandma, but she literally washed my mouth out with soap!” Tony tried holding back his laugh, covering his mouth with his hands. Steve, did not, and openly laughed at that.
“Say, Moe Curly and Larry, why don’t you guys go back to whatever shitty music video auditions you just came from, and leave the lady alone, huh? Or should I play some Ting-Tings for you stooges?” The leader scoffed, standing tall but still a good two inches shorter than Wade before looking behind him at Emerson.
“Um, it’s really nothi-“
“I think you’ve helped in here enough, sweet pea,” Bucky said with a brow raised while she turned to giggle mischievously back at him.
“Wait, Miles? Leo? What are you guys going as?” Steve asked them with a small smile.
She was standing in front of a giant.
“You know how I feel about you drinking…”
“You sound like a fortune cookie, grampa.” Steve instantly dug his fingers into his son’s ribs, smiling at the laughter it produced.
Tony stayed seated a moment longer, smiling when Peter threw an arm around Emerson’s shoulder as they walked down the hall. He felt Steve shift on the couch to stand up, offering a hand to the billionaire. Tony took it gratefully, accepting the warm embrace his husband pulled him into when they were both standing.
“I’m almost seventeen Peter! Is a year really going to make that much of a difference?” the child asked as Peter stared back at him in shock.
“NO TIRED!” Hulk cried with a pout, which Daci didn’t know he was capable of, and let out a laugh.
"Yeah, he told me about you," she said as she looked up at him. The man smiled at her, staring at her a moment longer before saying something to his men in their language.
“I love you too, Alpha,” Tony cooed in reply, jumping a little when he felt someone else requiring his attention. “Oh, someone’s feeling left out of the love fest.” He grabbed one of Steve’s hands wrapped around their son to put over the place he had felt a kick.
“S-Steve, Steve the baby,” Tony wailed out, confused by the sudden happiness that was pushed through the bond.
“Come watch movies, Daddy!” Harley said again, breaking Tony out of his stupor as he joined his family for some snuggle-movie time. His middle child climbed onto his lap while his husband wrapped his arm around him and pulled him close. They had chosen The Lion King and Tony only knew because of the sounds of the opening credits, since his eyes were closed. He didn’t even realize he’d fallen asleep until a noisy commotion woke him up. As he slowly opened his eyes, he found the cause of the commotion.
“Alright, thanks J,” Steve said as he stepped out onto his floor. He put the bag on the kitchen counter and fished out Tony’s favorites. His husband had a coffee machine in his lab and was no doubt drinking it without eating any breakfast. Steve ate an apple fritter and chugged a glass of water before plating his husband's donuts and walking towards his lab.
He patted her shoulder in comfort as the three rode the elevator silently to Bruce's lab.
“Thor, there is still a child obviously in this room. Plus Daci is still here,” Natasha said with a smirk, pointing to Clint with a smile. Everyone but Clint laughed, who just pouted with a mouthful of pizza.
"Life works in mysterious ways, baby bro."
He stops by a nearby floral shop to get daises and tulips, his Pop and Dad's favorites, before picking up chocolate covered fruits - blueberries for his Dad. The cherry on top was a trip to the post office, picking up the custom travel mugs he had ordered. They both said "my husband is better than yours," and had each other's hero memorabilia plastered over them. He texts his dads a reminder before he drove over to the Tower.
The brunette seemed to absorb those words, sighing before nodding his head in concession.
However, those thoughts were interrupted when she suddenly grabbed his face before pulling him into a fierce hug. She hugged him so tightly he actually felt the air leave his lungs. She continued crying while she clung to him as the genius shifted them more comfortably on the bed – and to allow himself to actually breathe in her iron grip.
“You don’t want to talk to Nat. You don’t want to talk to me. And you aren’t ready to talk to a therapist,” James said matter of factly, cutting Clint to the core. “So...I brought something that I think would help…”
…and tried to keep that in mind as he waited for Tony to pick him up to look for her.
It was a short ride to the country club that was hosting them, the teens all filing out and talking amongst themselves in excitement. Buck had never even wanted to go to prom, skipping on the chance last year to sleep with some freshman.
“And I’m so sorry I haven’t made that anything but obvious to you, Tony. I love you so much…I want to spend the rest of my life with you.”
“Come on, I think Papa has a snack waiting for us,” he said, ruffling those adorable brown curls as he walked the two to the elevator.
“Oh, it’s my father’s lab. But I use it when he’s out of town,” Tony said as he held one of the doors open for Steve to walk through.
Emerson was already there, tears in her eyes as she squatted next to her crying brother, holding his phone to her ear. She looked up, helpless, as the two superheroes made their way to comfort their crying son.
“You wouldn’t,” she said hesitantly; Steve unable to stop the smile from spreading across his face when she brought his attention back to her.
“Oh, hey Sam. I’m sorry I’m actually not eating dinner,” she said before turning to exit the kitchen.
“Yeah but you should get your own day, not have to share it with Daddy.”
“So…how did this happen?” Steve asked with a smile, noticing Buck was trying to stifle a smile of his own.
“Yeah, cub. It’s me,” Barnes said, lowering his arms and squatting down as the girl slowly approached him.
She was dead.
His words...
“Hey Clint, is Steve here?” Tony asked, panting a little from running.
"Yeah?" James asked with a smile. "Wait till we say
When the elevator opened, they were just getting to the end of the electric guitars rip when Emerson noticed she no longer had a singing partner. Her air guitar began to falter and quickly die out as she looked at her brother in confusion. They were standing in the entrance-way to the living room and Peter was angrily glaring at something. She followed his line of sight, trying to figure out what he was so mad about when she noticed something weird…
The coffee and food finally woke her up, since she didn't sleep at all last night from having more nightmares. She was up and had heard her Dad comforting Miles last night, so glad she found the boy as she knew her Dad would finally get some sleep too.
,” she quietly whined in protest as he pulled her across his lap. Sometimes it worked, and he definitely did pause, but ultimately he tucked her under his arm.
Vinyl and everything, which Tony enthusiastically helped add to his collection.
“-no, no! You can call me that you just surprised me is all.” She felt her shoulders relax as he kept smiling at her. “Do you want to finish reading to me? Looks like you have one book left.” Too stunned and happy to do anything else, she grabbed the last book and turned to sit in his lap once more.
“Emerson,” Steve said quietly, holding eye contact with her. She may be a stubborn kid, but he was a seasoned vet – both literally and when it came to dealing with stubborn individuals.
“Okay,” Clint said quietly as he moved his head to kiss his boyfriend on the mouth. James pulled away first, smiling back at him.
"Well, I think I know where some is, give me a second," he said before Emerson could interrupt. She tried anyway.
“What’s her name?” Clint asked as he kept looking at the pictures. This home had a warm fuzzy feeling to it, and Clint couldn’t decide if it was overwhelming or heavenly.
“Mr. Stark…”
The words were meant to comfort him, but being reminded he isn’t technically her parent also hurt in a way he couldn’t describe. Emerson picked up on this when he got quiet, smiling to herself before speaking again.
“I understand,” he said quietly, standing up tall like his Mama told him when making a proper apology. “I’m sorry for what I said Clint. I didn’t mean it, any of it. It’s not an excuse, but she -”
. His Pops was always put together and always good at holding it together. Even the other times in his life he remembers his Dad ended up in the hospital from injuries. Pop was comforting Peter, speaking to doctors, debriefing the team with grace.
“What are you doing here?” he asked as Susan suddenly appeared by her husband’s side, looking just as angry as Trevor.
“Of course, Sir.”
She hadn’t talked to Xavier since the mall, which did not help her anxiety since she didn’t have anyone to talk to the day of her Dad’s surgery.
“Can Xavy and I eat in the living room? Away from mister inappropriate over here?” Joey asked pointedly.
“I can help!” Peter added, standing up next to Daci.
“…Emerson Smith? What about that? I like that name.” For the first time, she smiled at Wendy, nodding her head in confirmation. “Emerson it is. Welcome to your new life, Emerson.”
"Emerson!" he shouted as she looked up in glee, unfazed by his tone. Two of the lambs had settled on her lap, as her face lit up as she silently screamed. Miles had wiggled down from the blonde's hold, following his older brother as the two raced over to pet the lambs.
“No,” he admitted with a pout, even crossing his arms for good effect. He broke with a smile as she fondly rolled her eyes at him.
Peter heard several teachers yelling at them as John shoved Emerson – who was quickly caught by Peter.
“JARVIS, inform my husband of what just happened!” Tony called to the ceiling.
She wakes up with a start, body drenched in sweat as unwanted tears spilled down her cheeks. She can’t control her breathing, which is rapid even though she feels like a car is resting on her chest. She throws the blankets back, not helping her feeling of suffocation as she throws her legs over the side. Her breath continues to get away from her, chest heaving as she does her best to control her hyperventilation.
“Oh don’t worry, I am not holding it together,” he said truthfully – smiling at the way she laughed and shook in his embrace. “But having you here helps.”
“Sorry," she said to Tony before turning to the boy. "Peter? What about you? What’s your middle name?”
His husband curled his arms around the brunette, who figured he’d start the conversation since he established earlier – they are both stubborn mules.
He chuckled when the man growled in his embrace and mumbled something about ‘mind-reader.’
Tony didn’t mind, trying to put his worried thoughts about his pup’s opinion out of his mind as he followed his love to a delicious lunch.
“What? No Steve, I'm not bonded, remember?” Tony asked, pulling his collar to reveal his unbonded gland. “That man is his godfather, my oldest friend in the world and is already bonded to an amazing woman. But...yeah that um, that pup is mine...and is also the reason I left without a note. He was with my parents that night and my mom had called to tell me he had a fever and was taking him to the hospital. I mean he’s clearly fine, but yeah...that’s why…”
Her wife was gone, left her.
, is what hurt,” he explained.
” the boy whispered to the blonde, who rolled his eyes before curling back up into the brunette.
Clint stared at his boyfriend, anger shooting up his spine as he waited for the man to explain himself.
“Tony, would it be okay if we crashed with you tonight?” he asked, both smiling when they heard the teen sigh with relief.
“Morning Papa and Daddy! It’s time for breakfast!” the almost five year old shouted as he scrambled his way onto their bed and proceeded to hurl his tiny body on top of them. Tony groaned before burying his face in his pillow as he felt his husband shift next to him.
So there he sat, alone in the living room as he continued watching cartoons and trying not to think of his boyfriend. He snacked on his popcorn as he heard the elevator ding, his sister walking in and joining him.
“Relax sweetheart, he is with his grandparents. I’ll send them a text to bring him back.”
So, incredibly damn proud of their girl.
Off in the distance, she hears people talking and the sounds of metal doors opening before tall creatures loom over her.
“Oh, that fucker is going down,” he growled out, crossing his arms as he looked like he was plotting the most evil demise ever. His expression quickly softened as he looked back up at her, demeanor changing as well.
he heard May reply.
“I just asked if you were okay, you seemed really upset.”
Peter giggled at her before giving her that signature Tony smirk.
“Morning beautiful,” Steve greeted the sleepy teen dragging herself to join Peter at the kitchen island, only getting a grunt in reply. He put the plate of waffles in front of her, earning a small smile from the girl.
It earned a glare from the cheerleader, but before she could open her mouth Steve was back with two drinks in his hands.
"You'll understand one day," Buck said as Steve tried his best not to roll his eyes.
“DON’T CARE. NO ONE LIKE HULK.”
She turned around instead, mumbling “faggots” under her breath as Tony felt his insides coil. Nothing ever good had come out of that word.
on wearing
“But you’ll be okay, right? I looked up heart valve replacement and people die from it–”
“Well Sir, with this physique it was either that or stripping.” Emerson choked on her water, hands covering her face to prevent any further laughter. Peter closed his eyes, hoping his dads understood he was joking.
“Pop,” Steve whined, turning to his Ma for help.
“Please do, little girl,” he said with a cheeky grin. She stuck her tongue out at him, which he of course returned maturely as he watched her go to her room.
The blonde’s face whipped up in shock, secretly hoping James would tell him he’s wrong. That everything was going to be okay. That they could make it.
"That's why you don't want me?" a tiny sad voice asked next to them, startling the Colonel and trained superhero. Tony looked down at the boy, feeling his own eyes get misty and his heart break at the sight of him. He quickly moved to squat down next to Miles, one hand resting on his shoulder in reassurance.
need to
“I’ve seen it, she’s fast. Maybe even too fast for you Hulk,” Clint teased.
“Kid?!” Miles asked in offense. “I’m Spider
She took a breath before she spoke slowly, “Tony, it’s okay that you drank this evening –”
“They saw your picture on the internet and…called you by some homophobic slurs…made fun of you. So I told them to go fuck themselves and came back early. That’s what happened, Steve.”
“Come on Captain, we don’t have all day.”
It gave him the confidence and love to kiss the man one more time, the two men laughing when their audience suddenly groaned in annoyance before joining them in the room.
“Emerson, could you wait for us in your room?”
…” Steve teased back, interrupted by a group of guys in front of them.
“Yeah well, I wish you could’ve come to my 4
“Daddy I want you to be here,” Harley said, tears forming in his eyes.
PETER
“Jo, you okay?” Steve asked with concern. That seemed to shake her out of it, turning to smile at the group and walking over.
A week after his surgery and her Dad was back at work. Not even in his lab, but back at his office at SI. She was thankful she and Peter had worked things out – and that her Pop was being more trusting with her after their long talk.
the girl whispered in answer as Peter opened the door more. The fathers shared a look before their son continued.
The genius scooted over after settling Pete on his chest, making room on the small hospital bed for his husband to join them. The taller man quickly obliged, carefully curling up around Tony before kissing him sweetly on the lips.
Tony quickly pulled her into a hug, ignoring the weak threats the wounded creature was shouting at them.
She grumbled in response, still conscious enough to complain. He chuckled before leaning down to kiss her cheek.
“I got distracted,” she said as she tried to reach around his giant frame to grab a piece of chicken. He saw and blocked her again. “If dinner’s not ready by six why can’t I be a little late?”
“I guess uh…” she began to say, pulling back her covers.
Steve’s expression was comical, the way his eyes bulged and his jaw dropped.
She took this time to look at Peter, Steve and Tony individually before addressing the others. “Because they don’t look at me or treat me like everyone else does.”
This was real, this wasn’t some stoned illusion or day dream. This was the man he was crazy about -
“Aw hell yes!” her brother exclaimed as he turned to his sister. “Come on Em, I know you love hash browns,” he said encouragingly as he walked over and elbowed her.
He was finishing up putting the Hershey’s kisses on the peanut butter blossoms he made for Tony when the man slowly joined him in the kitchen.
Ulysses Klaue was a weapons dealer who primarily got his weapons from stealing and killing. Her Dad had told her about him, how they had known each other long ago and even worked together - before her Dad realized what Stark Industries was doing and vowed to stop it.
“Not an excuse to assault a teenager,” Tony muttered.
wanted to go down on
"So Barnes, JARVIS told me you had a lady friend on your floor earlier," Tony said, causing Daci to stiffen. She noticed Clint's brows furrows while the blonde took another shot.
“Actually, it’s his birthday today,” the traitor friend replied, not looking at all bothered when Steve sent another glare his way.
“I think I’d rather be a Rogers. Not a fan of the whole “conditional love” thing; hasn’t worked for me in the past.” Steve immediately snorted and used the blankets to cover his face that was smiling and blushing from her words. She raised an eyebrow as a challenge to Tony, who could only smile back at her.
"Sup?" he asked innocently after trying to control his panting. She visibly cringed before asking.
“It’s…perfect. I can’t even articulate how much I love what you’ve done; but I promise you…” he said as he took a step closer to the brunette, towering over him with a predatory grin, “…I will show you this evening just how fucking much I love it. And you,” he finished as his hands grabbed the smaller man’s waist to pull them closer.
He snuck out early the next morning, leaving Steve a note that he’d be back later and pinky promised he’d talk to him about all of this. Currently, he was avoiding that by staying late in his office and yelling at his legal team.
She ended up spending the entire weekend with Nat and Clint. They were awesome, and way more fun than her family had been lately. Plus it was a nice distraction from all the bad luck she’s had recently.
“Giraffes normally live in Africa and they use their long necks to eat leaves up in the trees,” Clint explained, still at her side as she held up two hands against the glass. “They’re pretty cool, huh?”
“Well still, that’s a fantastic idea. Let’s go this weekend.”
“Oh here we go again,” Xavy piped in.
“- no we can’t James,” the Omega growled, possessively wrapping his arms around Bucky who only smiled in response.
Tony didn’t have anyone, only an abusive father and checked-out mother for twenty years.
“I love you, Pop, even if you’re naïve.”
“What? It’s a free country. I’m allowed to check out your asses if I want to. Honestly? It’s a shame you don’t play baseball, Barnes. You’ve got one of those asses made for baseball pants.”
The blonde used the opportunity to shove his boyfriend back to catch his breath, unable to hide the smile on his face as he waited for Bucky to ask him whatever it was he wanted to ask.
"They're all so cute Emerson! How are you going to decide?" Miles asked as he giggled at the kittens playing with the feather toy her was swinging around. She smiled as well, wondering if she could somehow convince her parents that they do actually need six cats. The tuxedo kitten had woken up but was still cuddling in her lap, almost instantly winning her heart as she thought of what kind of name would fit...him? Her?
He thought about this as he pulled into park in front of the Mansion, four joyous children in the car with him. (yes, he was counting his husband)
"Were...were you talking to me, Pete?" Harley asked in disbelief.
“That’s amazing! Tell Zoe we said congrats!” Tony replied, smiling at his daughter also awkwardly standing there. “Alright you two, do I need to play mediator here, or are you two ready to apologize and make up?”
“Hey babe, you know I can pay people to do that, right?” he asked, smiling as he leaned against the door frame.
Tears quickly blurred his vision, which had the brunette scrambling to wipe them.
“Grant?” she asked, feeling bad when Tony started laughing from the ground. “Tony what’s your middle name?”
He rolled his eyes as she took a few more seconds to settle down, sitting her back against his chest as she reached over for the book on top of the pile and handed it to Steve.
“Loooooove youuu,” he said still embarrassing his kid. He immediately let out an “oof” when she swung her legs up, using the momentum to tumble backwards off to the other side of the bed. He curled up a little, hands protectively around his groin as she smugly walked out of the room, weirdly proud of that move.
“I...um...maybe I’d be up for round three if you ate more chocolate. There’s a little on your finger, maybe you should lick that off…” And Tony watched in amazement as his husband put the finger in his mouth before pulling away at the last second.
“Not if said thing involves basic human function…”
Her arm clocked back to hit him again, but this time the super soldier caught her.
"Oh! Guess what? Last night! Guess what? Daddy and I built robots in his lab!" Her attention immediately turned to her other father, whose eyes were bulging from their sockets as the color slowly drained from his face. She turned to her brother, both realizing their Dad had broke one of Pop's rules.
“What cream?” she asked after crossing her arms over her chest.
"Hm, I wonder, father, if you would feel the same way if
“And a million aunts and uncles,” Peter reminded, the three men smiling when she did. They sat in silence again until Steve spoke, asking the question the other two had asked when they realized she had left.
"So you really think you and Buckaroo will have a pup? You'd make a great Mama bear, you know. It's part of the reason we made you godmother," Tony said with a smile to his friend, loving the blush it got from the blonde.
“-You didn’t! You didn’t tell me you signed up for the army! How long ago was this? Jesus you ship out a few weeks after graduating?”
“Alright, come on,” her Tati said, carrying Morgan to the kitchen.
...but he was able to make out James...kneeling in front of him?
“Double duh, Daddy,” the boy said in between giggles.
“I only have her because of you. Otherwise...I don’t like to think what could have happened…”
“We all heard from Dr. Chase, Stark. Don’t think you or your mini me over there can get away with milking this. We’re actually all just here for Peter’s birthday,” the smartass assassin teased with a small smile.
But then she remembered she didn’t really deserve their love right now, and gently shoved them off of her.
Emerson made her way to her room, changing into a one piece before making her way to the indoor pool. She didn’t use it often for exercise, but she could be alone the longest there. The other option is going for a run around the property and though it was beautiful - she still hated running. And walking wasn’t rigorous enough.
earlier. You showered
“Sam…” the blonde said tiredly.
“No,” Bucky growled out. “I think that bitch took my kid.”
“Oh honey, I am already
“Yeah so should we head to your place so I can see a few samples of your work or…?” Steve felt himself blush again as Tony just smiled wolfishly at him.
The taste was weird, and the smoke burned a little…but overall?
She sighs heavily for the third time before her blonde father slams the spatula down on the counter and turns to her abruptly. He had been making breakfast and paused to look at her in annoyance and with zero empathy.
“You are! Before you, he was so far in the closet Narnia declared him a citizen,” she said as Tony bellowed in laughter at that. The laughing woke up Peter as Jarvis alerted them the delivery person had arrived.
…that our fathers were being so…careless about our feelings?”
“Oh, well no. The only thing I haven’t shown you was something HYDRA taught me…”
“I almost died and this is the respect I get?” She laughed along with her family as she felt her Pops wrap his arms around her; chin resting on the top of her head.
"Is Asgard safe for a five year old to travel to?" Emerson asked skeptically, the two fathers sharing a knowing smile at her confusion.
“Joey,” Peter said astonished. “That’s not very nice. Papa always calls you a good girl when you’re not around.” Her eyes sprung open at that, looking up at Steve who eyes were equally wide – though his cheeks were also blushed pink.
"Would you let my child decide for herself?" Tony piped in as Steve moved to hug that man, resting his chin on top of the brunette's head.
“Yes I can, I’m an adult,” she mumbled again, realizing how pitiful that sounded as she heard her little brother join them.
He was still going to make an effort to hang out with him and Sam more often.
“Yeah I was worried it was something like that. She might have faked her own death to get away. She could also maybe be from a different multiverse? I don’t know…why would she leave her behind though? She must’ve known what that would do to her,” he felt his eyes get misty when he looked back down at the angel in his lap. He smiled when he felt his husband reach over to kiss his cheek in comfort. The blonde extracted his arm from around Tony’s shoulder before settling his head on his shoulder, also cuddling into Tony.
“But not alcohol?” Joey asked half-jokingly. May was actually kind of the perfect person to talk to about this, and she’d be lying if she said the offer wasn’t tempting.
“Thanks for the vote of confidence, Dad. But
“Makes more sense than Joey doing something that stupid again. She knows what happened last time…” he teased to lighten the tension, glad to see Steve’s smile at that.
The memory of the car crash slowly returning to his mind. And with it, the pain and fear and anguish he felt from it. As Tony looked around he noticed something that broke his heart.
“Daddy!” she said as she ran to him, almost dropping Simba in the process, before she jumped into his arms.
Sam - who apparently could knit like a grandma - made them a baby blanket.
Their third date was at Steve’s apartment, the blonde insisting he cooked for the man – who sounded incredibly giddy over the phone at the prospect. Turns out it wasn’t even for the easy access to the bedroom…Tony confessed no one had ever cooked for him before. The thought made Steve sad, and so he made sure the man had dessert to go along with his meal.
“Just an older brother,” Clint answered honestly, stuffing his face more with this delicious chocolate cake.
Joey simply pouted and remained sitting. She even threw in her best puppy eyes.
"Come on, Em, I think you could use some hot chocolate," he said as he opened the door for her, an invitation to keep each other company. She followed him with a smile, even though she knew her Pop would probably tattle on her later and tell her Dad.
She really didn’t want the big party her dads were insisting on throwing for her adoption ceremony. She’d much rather just sign the paperwork and go back to the way there were living, except she was beginning to thoroughly enjoy calling them “Dad” and “Pop.” But this big party would be overwhelming and unnecessary, facts overlooked by her new parents, who were simultaneously collaborating with Pepper on the phone while bickering over each other.
“The very one,” Steve said with a sigh. “Emerson’s been a little short with us lately and extra distant. Keeps saying she’s “not ready to talk about it.” Maybe if Tony and I reached out to Kimberly then–”
“Yeah...so...could I maybe...take you to dinner sometime?” Steve asked, nervous even though they had both shared how wonderful their one night stand had been.
“Are those crepes?” she asked in excitement as she couldn’t help bouncing a little in his arms.
“Oh yeah,” she said with a laugh, “two peas in a pod, partners in crime and all of that.” Peter stirred a little as they waited for the food to arrive, the two focusing on him in silence before Joey spoke in a hushed tone.
It was so easy for Tony to get lost in happiness around Steve and their friends, he sometimes forgot about the real world. Otherwise known as - Howard. Since he’s been spending so much of his free time with Steve, he hadn’t been paying attention to his father...or his father’s company.
It was his tattoo for Joey, which he let her pick out after the wedding/adoption ceremony. It was a tiger lily with a ‘J’ on one of the petals.
Emerson gently moved to sit next to him, legs still resting on his lap as he heard Steve call out asking if they were ready. He looked at his daughter who realized they weren't ready, calling out to let Steve know before moving with him as they cleared some space in the living room to walk. She grabbed a nearby tablet to adjust the lights and prepare the music as Tony told Jarvis to record the whole thing.
“I know, but still. We have to be extra considerate about her. The men she’s had in her life have been…sexual deviants and it wouldn’t do any good to show her we’re no different.”
“…next week!” the brunette pointed out. “Come on, a spontaneous romantic trip is just what we need!” Steve couldn’t find a single argument against that, humming in approval as he closed his eyes to finally sleep.
“No, I don’t,” he said with a smile as he kissed the blonde’s neck. “You know me so well.”
The very cunt who Harley eventually confessed hit him. The reason Tony finally ended things with her. The woman who hurt their pup so much he had been skeptical of Steve since the day they met.
“Want me to move that box for you?” she asked with a coy smile, smiling brighter when the blonde let out an enthusiastic laugh. Man, she really liked Clint.
“Well jeez, Rogers, don’t sound so desperate,” Tony muttered, desperately trying to save face. The blonde saw right through him, a warm smile on his face.
The blonde looked incredibly proud as he nodded to him, as though he was reading his freaking mind.
Kimberly had reached out to Tony to leave her contact info in case Emerson wanted to speak with her. One of Tony’s assistants had been the one to relay the message. He remembers showing Emerson – but she tore up the sheet with her contact info before he had a chance to say anything.
"You're such a sap. Don't forget about your adult presents you still need to open. I'll even let you pick one to use tonight after our pups are asleep," Tony said with wiggly brows, teasing the Alpha who mock glared back at him.
“There you are Rogers! What the hell man you said you’d buy me lunch,” Sam said accusingly, and without any ire as he also sported a huge grin.
“FuckFace McNoStones flaked and had his secretary call Tony to tell him. Pup’s been at school waiting for an hour,” Steve explained, some of the anger returning to his voice. He could smell the change in his brother’s scent, anger leaking out of the other Alpha who nodded in approval.
Sure enough on the front, was yet another Steve look alike.
He didn’t get a verbal one, but felt his boyfriend’s hands immediately begin running through his long hair in answer.
“They’ve been gracious enough to let me stay with them, and…and (Peter noticed her shoulder flinch from anxiety at the honesty of her statement) I’d like to continue staying with them. I feel safe with them and Peter. My records show that my grades have improved, too. And if Mr. Piggs over there was any good at his job he would have made note of my clean urine test and lack of self-harm since staying with them.” She finished glaring at the man, who in turn was glaring back at her.
The Omega wasn't worried, though, even as the Alpha shouted empty threats as he left. Tiberius used to have power over Tony, but that was a long time ago.
make you her father,” the vile mother spit out condescendingly. “Besides, everyone is well aware of her
but confessed his love for Captain America
Regardless, it wasn’t long before she made it to her destination, thanking the man as she got out. It wasn’t hard to hack JARVIS to find the woman’s address. She approached the stairs, taking them slowly as she ascended and considered what she would say. Stopping in front of her apartment, she took another breath before knocking loudly.
When Clint had first come out (to his brother, that is), it was about three weeks after Barney became his legal guardian.
“Peter, son you’re going to have a panic attack if you keep this up, you can’t breathe like this,” Steve said as he tried to calm down the screaming child.
Tony picked him up in his favorite Jaguar, the two doing minimal groping on the way to the theater. However, in doing so, Steve only realized he forgot his phone as they stood in line for popcorn.
Fuck he loved this man.
But then said husband reached his hands around to grab the shorter man’s ass and Tony found himself moaning louder, pulling back to glare a little at the smirking beautiful bastard.
“Well,” Steve began as he continued kissing him, “we’d lay out in the sun, rub sun screen on each other…”
“What if you read to her?” Bucky suggested. Steve rolled his eyes as he saw Joey sit up at that, turning to the blonde.
“Maybe it’s a big shit, that happens,” he said with a grin. Steve swatted him again for good measure. He recognized those beautifully frustrating brown eyes turn mischievous as Steve turned his attention away from the horndog to finish plating the dishes.
“Hey Peter! How was your day at school?” she asked, moving to the boy before Tony could warn her.
Before she knew it he had wrapped his arms around her and drawn her into his embrace. Fresh tears in her eyes, she returned the hug and settled a little more comfortably in his lap. The tears increased when Tony whispered back “good, cause I really like you as my daughter.” He squeezed his eyes shut as he kissed her hair. She hadn’t felt this loved in…well…ever. She settled her head on his shoulder, unable to hide the smile etched on her face.
She felt the color drain from her face as Klaue and most of the men left; leaving behind four large men who looked hungrily at the eighteen year old. She once again tried to break the zip ties, panicking as the men smiled and closed in around her.
“Sir’s blood pressure is one ten over sixty, his cholesterol is one-thirty, he has a resting heart rate of ninety, though that is currently accelerating due to this realization-”
“I’m good, Joe,” the shorter brunette said earnestly, easily accepting the hug the older man pulled him into.
“What was that, doll?” the cheeky bastard sing-songed, making Clint reluctantly pull back enough to be heard more clearly.
His laugh was infectious as he carried the two to the kitchen, gently placing his son down on the tile floor.
What Miles didn’t expect, was for the two teens to be on different pages about this whole thing.
“It was supposed to be a fair fight…” she started, stopping herself quickly when she realized what she had said aloud. She didn’t look at either of them as the wheels clicked in Steve’s brain.
,” she whined at him with her bottom lip out as she reached her arms out to the chuckling brunette; who quickly wrapped his arms around her in understanding. She could hear her blonde father scoff at the two.
“- I’ll know if you just want him for his money, too,” the six year old said, interrupting Steve’s train of thought with new vigor. The Alpha just stared at the tiny blonde for a few seconds before shaking his head to respond.
“Yeah well, what these two aren’t telling you is that Peter was joined at Tony’s hip and had Tony immediately wrapped around his little finger. Started calling him Daddy way before calling me Papa.” Tony took the opportunity to look at Peter, his son, before standing up and wrapping his arms around the boy.
So he smiled and nodded as he gently put Emerson on Steve's lap.
“Hey!” Peter called at him.
James returned a moment later with bags upon bags of things; toys, food, more toys, treats, a bed, pee pads and even more toys.
Now, two things stuck out to her Dad when she was diagnosed with epilepsy. Alcohol and marijuana both trigger seizures. He had lectured her over and over again the dangers of those things. Not only what it would do to her adolescent brain, but what would happen if she seized around people that could take advantage of her.
“Yes, I know, I believe you,” he reassured her as she still looked warily at him. “I just wanted to run something by you…something about my job.” This did not help her look of worry, the blonde waving his hands to try to clarify himself.
“That you’d kick their asses? Yeah, I would’ve loved to have seen it,” Steve said with a smile as Joey hugged Simba close.
Then just more blinding pain, so much he couldn't think he could take anymore. And just when he thought he would die from it...comfort. Ease. It let him relax enough to feel sleepy.
“You know, you say this everyday and yet everyday you take a nap and feel so much better after,” he pointed out as he kissed the pouting boy on his cheek.
"Just one Peter, we'll be having dinner soon!" Joey shouted and frowned when she simply heard the pair laugh at her.
“It ends at like eleven.”
And sure enough, a butt naked toddler zoomed in to rejoin them in the living room. Tony and Steve burst out laughing as they saw Joey look at her son in horror.
“I want my Daddy,” the pup said pitifully as he walked out and followed Steve to his truck.
"What'd you make, babe?" he asked as he looked through the clear top at some orange liquid. Wade took his backpack off, taking out some hot and fresh bread and setting it on the counter by the soup.
Too soon voices filled the mansion as Miles stayed by his friend’s side, feeling guilty enough to confess what had happened. He stood up, walking to the entrance with his hands raised in surrender.
“It’d be too weird, honestly. So I figured I wouldn’t confuse my little brother…
“No thanks.”
, not your completely fictional fantasy," his Pop quipped back, getting a laugh from Peter and Emerson. His Dad huffed before turning around to Peter, crossing his arms as he pouted.
. So. Get off my property. And stay the hell away from my son,” the Alpha growled, fist curling and preparing to be the one to rip out the other man’s neck with his teeth should he try anything stupid. Luckily Stone had an ounce of sense left in him, not saying another word but instead scrambling up and leaving in his ugly car.
Didn’t he already shut you down at lunch the other day?” Tony’s eyes widened in amazement, unaware of that little fact as he sputtered a laugh.
“Can I buy you a coffee?” Sam over dramatically brought his hands to his chest.
“Yes, but that doesn’t mean we’re replacing you. We’re just adding to our super cool team, okay? And you’ll get to have so much fun as a big brother!”
“Your bestie told me,” Tony admitted, thoroughly enjoying the flush from the other teen.
Right now, he was carrying his pup into his house and offering him quiet words of encouragement. Which was getting harder to do with his pregnant belly.
“I’m serious.”
He had been holding the frozen lasagna their mom had made, and handed it back over to his mom who was failing at stifling her laughter.
“I’ll be right back,” her Tati said with a groan, getting up off the couch and heading to Morgan’s room. It was also at that moment that an alarm went off and the ceiling robot spoke up.
“Babe, you said she was in the bathroom taking a shit. Maybe
“More fun than a moody teenager I can tell you that.”
“–sneaking behind your parents back to see your estranged
"Yeah? You happy with yourself, smartass?" Tony asked quietly.
“You’re twenty-four minutes late Jo,” he said. “That’s twenty-four minutes of me keeping your Pop from call the police. Or the president.” She stifled a laugh at that when Steve just squinted at her before he turned back to his husband.
“Well, it’s said that the first time you touch, you feel a spark of electricity. The sex is beyond amazing. But from what I’ve read about it, it’s a ‘feeling’ not otherwise specified.”
She growled before rolling her eyes and stomping away, Bucky laughing as he watched her go. That was one of the many secrets he knew but would never tell. He wasn’t raised like that.
"I'm not, I'm worried about you and your diet of coffee and coffee."
"You realize I will have to murder you now?" Shuri asked incredulously as T'Challa rolled his eyes.
If his husband had met the kid before they adopted the toddlers, then yes - it sounds like something he could handle. But he had two little people to worry about now. Which meant putting their safety first.
“Jarvis, review the security tapes, when did she leave?” Tony asked as he cradled a now terrified and crying boy in his arms, standing up to help.
She sat a moment longer as she watched her brothers race each other to the game room, turning to smile at her dads.
BUCKY
“Josephine,” Bucky tried reasoning with the tyrant. “You’re not potty trained yet, you have to at
“Please, Daddy?” he asked with his puppy eyes as he lowered himself so he could look up at Tony. The man pouted at his son before turning to pout at Steve. Peter turned his attention to his Pop as well and also pouted with his Dad.
.” So Jarvis wrote it down and promised he’d email him with good news soon.
not going anywhere… though your other dad could use more sleep and less caffeine…” he said pointedly, getting a small giggle from the teen and a scoff from his husband.
“You’re right, Kimberly, you didn’t sell me. But you did abandon me…for something I felt was right at six... And up until a year ago I had to suffer getting beaten, raped, starved, burned, whipped…passed around for years because you were too fucking stupid at seventeen and whoring yourself around to have an abortion.”
“No, Steve. I have it too. I noticed a weird mark on the back of her neck earlier. I just. I honestly don’t know what we should or can do in a situation like that?” Peter had made his way back to the kitchen at this point, adding to the conversation.
"I saw him kill like a million guys! Just chopped them up with his swords!" the little boy explained as he put more food in his mouth.
“It’ll be alright, cub. I won't be gone long, okay?” he reassured, squeezing her hand when the door opened before walking the two to the sounds of the Starks - minus Steve - in the living room. “Thanks again, man.”
“Ten years?! Oh my god! That is…injustice in its highest form! A travesty! Well…it will be quite the challenge to assist you in playing catch up. But dammit that is a risk I am willing to take,” Tony said seriously, smiling at Steve when he snorted in laughter.
“He’s not the one I’m worried about.”
AMAZING!!!!!
“Yeah, she’s great. You, on the other hand, can kindly fuck off,” Clint said as he held up both hands to flick him off, and again almost falling off the bed. Buck grabbed him around his waist and easily lifted the teen back onto the bed, in the middle away from the edge.
“Yeah, I think so. When’d you know?” she asked, turning to curl up and face him. He had to think about that, wondering if he should tell her the whole truth to that story.
But he was really tired of his friends giving him shit about bonding.
One Saturday morning he was making breakfast, enjoying the silence in the Tower before everyone started waking up. He opted to not shave this morning after his run and shower, deciding that maybe he'd try to grow a beard out. Just to see if he could pull it off.
“Nothing, actually. I have been behaving, I’ll have you know, sir. Anyway last night I had a bad dream, so I went to the kitchen, you know, to grabs me a snack,” she said, smiling as he nodded in agreement.
“Yeah, well it’ll help you feel less like shit tomorrow morning,” the blonde reiterated after failing to attempt to hold back a laugh.
, but she had broken the picture of her and her Dad. Steve gently grabbed her hand to also inspect it, bringing it up to look closer while she stayed comfortably laid on his lap.
“Shit,” he said aloud, grabbing a towel to clean up as he heard the elevators ding. He tried to remain calm, waiting for Joey to join him in the kitchen while he finished making Tony’s drink. When he heard her go straight to her bedroom, he began to worry again.
“I think so buttercup.” She smiled at that, also appreciating the fact that Tony was leading this conversation.
“Ah. I see. Well there seems to be something else wrong with this picture…” Tony giggled before responding.
She ignored the upcoming lecture in favor of a delicious treat as she followed her Pop into the kitchen.
"Yeah Daddy and Papa, quit being gross!" Harley added, clearly having spent too much time with his Uncle Clint. Tony chuckled as he turned to his Alpha to grab his hand, only to find the sap looking dreamily back at him with one hand extended.
“That’s cause you’re a bigger baby about it than the teenager,” Rhodey said as he gave Sam another plus four after they reversed. Sam threw his hands up in frustration, only proving her Uncle Rhodey right.
Other days Clint was short-tempered and distant, lashing at anyone that got too close.
“Oh good, you’re home,” he said with his usual amount of snarkiness. Steve didn’t say anything at first, just looked sadly at his husband. He spoke after a beat.
“Sure! Do you mind helping me carry a plate?” She nodded yes and walked with him to the living room, trying to ignore the sounds of Harley and Peter screaming with laughter as they chased each other around the coffee table. She was still getting used to the noise and tried to focus on the delicious crepes instead of the screaming children.
Taking care of her is what’s been grounding him when everything got too loud.
,” the redhead said with a glare before turning on her heel and heading towards the elevator.
The three sat in silence for a moment, Steve just enjoying holding his kid in his arms, chest filled with warmth at how happy Bucky would be for them.
birth mother?” Sam interrupted.
“Princesses,” Peter clarified with a smile of his own.
…” the brunette tried.
. You will talk to Kate and your new psychiatrist about
She rolled her eyes with a smile, glad they changed their topic of conversation while she focused on drawing with her brother.
“So, Tony..which one was it? You ran away with the president’s daughter? You went to rehab for a secret drug addiction? Got knocked up by a teacher? Ran away to join the circus? Come on tell me why you left high school,” Natasha said, the only evidence that she was intoxicated by how much she was talking.
“Yeah, me too,” Steve said with a shrug, trying to be nonchalant. The laugh he got from the Omega told him he wasn’t successful.
“You see Bruce or I call your husband and tattle,” the Colonel threatened. The genius frowned at that, pouting at his friend for using such a reliable threat.
"Uh oh, that tone can't be good Thumper," he said with a pointed look to his daughter, whose face was red in embarrassment.
She continued singing quietly, not protesting even when he washed her face. After he rinsed her off, he sat back a little to just let her play some more. She put more of the bubbles on her face before turning to the blonde.
Steve wisely kept his mouth shut but couldn’t help a smile crack from his lips, which only further infuriated his husband.
“I think the power of king has gone to your pretty blonde head,” Tony continued purring, watching as Steve looked confused for a moment before rolling his eyes in understanding.
“Yes! He makes you so happy, Tati. And he makes me happy. I love Clint.”
things?" Tony pulled back at that, gently wiping his thumb across the boy's cheek.
“What?” Peter asked as he buried his face in his hands.
He thought he heard Tony’s breath hitch from the action, but assumed it was just a dream his husband was having and settled in to join him.
“Nakey like Daddy!” the toddler proclaimed as she suddenly stopped running in favor of dancing. Steve looked over to his older brother, who was smiling down at his daughter.
“Good,” Steve said with a smile.
“Shh,” the father said, “I’ve got you now, little Thumper, no one is taking you from me.” He was relieved to feel her relax a little at that – shooting a quick thanks upwards that he had said the right thing. She maneuvered herself a little until she was curled up in bed facing him, no hint of leaving the man or the bed. He smiled as he laid back down, pulling her close to his chest and wrapping his arm around her.
"Having a kid does something to you. She makes me want to be a better man, not just for her, but for myself. Do I wish the circumstances were different? Sure. But everyday she surprises me, and it's...I don't know. It's a privilege getting to watch her grow."
He shook his head fondly at one of his favorite people ever. She smiled back at him for another moment before addressing him more seriously.
“Well…Ty will be there…” his husband said quietly and Steve found his body going rigid at the thought.
But definitely not expecting him to panic, scream, and slap her hand away.
, getting out of his fucking shell.
“And with Tony, obviously I’d let the genius choose, since he’s kind of my hero…”
“Okay, I admit this is pretty damn good. And if memory serves me, just as good as Mama Rogers’. Now...that being said…”
He’s snapped out of his thoughts when he hears Tony speak to their girl.
"Our fathers have done more for this world in the last week then you two bible-thumping hypocrites have done in your entire lives. And what's
“I know Peter walked in on you guys talking in private. I know it wasn’t on purpose and I didn’t mean to make you feel bad when…you’re already
She came over every day after school for a week. Steve couldn’t help but notice her slight discomfort and obviously scared nature. She rarely made eye contact and Steve was beginning to wonder what had happened/was happening to this sweet kid. She finally met Tony, who returned from a business trip and was happy to provide embarrassing stories about Peter over dinner. She had stayed for dinner every day that week too. Steve sat quietly at the dinner table, noticing new bruises on Emerson’s arms. His eyebrows furrowed as Tony finished up the story about when Peter almost got run over by a bicycle when he was five because he was chasing a turtle. The old nickname, “Bambi,” was thrown around about Pete to further embarrass his son. When they all laughed, even Peter with his red face, Steve smiled at them as well, growing concern behind his blue eyes. As she did every other day, she refused a ride home and left, thanking her hosts for the delicious meal. Steve decided to talk to Tony as they were cleaning up the dishes.
"So, you like me?" Emerson asked again in clarification, bravely taking a step forward to the smiling woman.
“Yeah...so...maybe you should just leave then,” Clint growled out, shrugging his shoulders as if the words meant nothing. As if it didn’t break Bucky’s heart to hear his boyfriend dismiss him so easily.
“Steve’s a great cook, I get plenty of home-cooked meals. What I don’t get enough of is Chinese take-out,” she said as they finally passed the wreckage.
“That guy isn’t in the gift shop anymore. Daci? Kiddo are you okay?” Clint asked, suddenly appearing by her side and squatting down next to her. Anger and confusion were battling it out in her chest, but the latter won out as she just shook her head no before allowing Clint to pull her into a hug.
“Actually, I’m thinking of law school…” she said nonchalantly as Steve found himself gawking at his teen.
He made his way to the kitchen, trying to decide if he wanted to start breakfast or go for a quick run before they all wake up. He opted to at least get a pot of coffee going, still feeling pretty emotionally exhausted from last night.
“Steve!” Harley cried, jumping off Howard’s lap and running over to the older blonde. He’d never initiated a hug before, but luckily Steve’s reflexes were automatic as he grabbed the boy and pulled him up into his arms, reminding himself the pup was safe. “It’s my fault, Steve! This is all my fault.”
. Tony had shitty parents, Steve had one shitty parent and not enough time with the good one.
“But Papaaaaaaa,” he whined out, making sure to drag the word out as far as possible.
"Maybe," he said as Steve said "no." The blonde shot the brunette a glare but Tony ignored it, piercings - unlike tattoos - can fade.
Tony, practically fell off the bed hearing the news.
“You’re a terrible influence,” Tony teased the blonde as he helped put the groceries away.
“It’s...it’s been really hard. Apparently Ty told Harley that Steve wanted to have a pup with me to then push him out of my life. I want
Emerson stood up and stretched out a little, nodding to the other end of the pool and waiting for her nephew to stand up before leading the two to the shallow end. They sat in the water, which still came up to the boy’s chest, watching the others splash and throw the toddlers around.
“Shh no baby, that is not true at all,” she heard him say with a waver in voice. “Your Daddy would be so proud of the young woman you’re becoming,” he said, pausing to tighten his arms around her further.
“Ow! Hey! What do you expect of me when an Adonis shows up in my house?” the brunette said, smiling as he heard Sam laugh next to Steve. He shot his partner a glare and was disappointed when the man just kept smiling.
“Feel free to check my references, but
“I don’t know about you…but I could use a shower, Captain,” Tony said, looking up at Steve with those soul-stealing brown eyes. Steve lost a little control then, not exactly letting Tony lead when he easily grabbed the man’s ass and brought him up into his arms.
– Hairs on the back of his neck pricked up as he quickly dodged a small yellow object fly over his head – the
And inevitably kick their asses in Mario Kart, of course.
She started walking down the hallway to the elevators, when she spotted a woman who made her heart stutter.
“Please? Just let me go to sleep,” she whined when Steve reached a hand out to gently grab her arm. His husband didn’t initially let her go, carefully helping her wrap the blanket fully around herself and rest on her shoulders when she was failing to do so.
“My hero,” Bucky said in a low possessive tone, kissing him fiercely again until they heard Rumlow groan in pain. “Come on, I think it’s time we head to the hotel I rented for the night…” He grabbed Clint’s free hand and pulled him along, past a grumbling asshole and out towards the limo.
The next thing he knew, his husband had unwrapped from his arms and was out the door, leaving Tony in a giggly mess.
“I’m going to head back to the gym now. Call me if you need anything, okay?”
Tony’s gland ached and reminded the genius why he’d rushed over to Steve in the first place. You know, besides the whole baby thing.
“Wait...what do you mean he dumped him?”
“You know…I’m not sure there is really anything I can say right now that would change your mind,” Steve said honestly, “but I’m willing to do whatever it takes to convince you.” He smiled when she genuinely laughed a little at that.
The two genius' were sipping on what he assumed was coffee for Tony and tea for Bruce.
“Oh honey, here’s Stevie running naked in the front yard when it rained!” Pop cooed and handed Tony the picture as Steve felt himself blush more. Especially when his sister found the ballerina picture and handed that to Tony as well. It got a laugh out of Harley, who looked back and forth between the picture and Steve before bursting into giggles.
“Peter?” Tony asked with a small smile, body slowly relaxing as he felt the tears come down for a different reason.
Knowing those two, they were probably canoodling and taking their sweet time doing so. Her stomach rumbled as she lazily searched the kitchen for the right ingredients. She was happy Steve was back, happier still that Tony had Steve back. Not that she hadn’t enjoyed the little sleepover, she was still getting accustomed to “good touch,” as Steve put it. She just always felt like it was a sign of weakness, seeking physical comfort. She had learned at a young age to fill that void in other ways; not bashing her foster family who gave hugs like they depended on it, but rather thoughtfully comparing what she thinks a healthy happy family is supposed to look like. These thoughts were interrupted as she heard footsteps approaching the kitchen.
They laid together on the bed for a few more minutes as Bucky contemplated leaving to go find Steve again.
Those words were like a dagger to Steve’s chest. His face crumpled in pain as he brought his hands to his face in agony.
“Yay Papa!” he shouted as he hugged Steve’s legs. The blonde leaned down to pick up his son, pulling him into his embrace as he stole a glance at his husband.
She could only find cranberry cocktail and that was basically just sugar. She really really didn't want to interrupt their love fest and ask, but so far her only help had come from the AI - and Jarvis' suggestion was to check the kitchen.
“Dammit Emerson, your wife isn’t dead. She is
“Are they done yelling?” Peter asked as Harley plopped down on the floor and began playing with his blocks.
Tony didn’t actually have the choice, when the mother of his future child had screamed at him to get out after he may have had a mini panic attack hours ago.
"I can do that?" she asked before shaking her head, startling her brother as she opened the door and motioned for him to go inside. He glared at her a moment before obliging, walking in to a sight he hadn't expected.
“Pops,” she greeted back, taking deep breaths and kicking her legs in the water. He kept staring at her with a stupid smile, making her quickly lose her patience and snap, “
“Alright cub, let me help you wash your hair,” her Tati said as he wiped his own bubbles off before moving around to sit behind her. Feeling courageous, she didn’t wait for his help, just dunked herself underwater before popping back up and wiping the bubbles from her eyes. “I’m so proud of you baby girl.”
Then they made it to the dinosaur museum, the Alpha feeling close to bursting with happiness when the pup grabbed his hand to show him his new favorite dinosaur - the T-Rex.
"Nope, I need a longer one since I finally came around to it."
STEVE
she answered quietly.
“I don’t believe we’ve met,” she heard him say with an anger that made her shiver, “I’m one of her faggot fathers,” he said stomping his combat boot onto the injured hand, eliciting more screams from the dying animal. “The genius standing over there, the one who did this little number to what’s left of your hand?” he asked as he squatted down and pushed more weight onto the broken limb. “That’s her other faggot father, who made me promise not to rip your heart out in front of our baby girl.” He straightened back up as he sported a confused expression. “You know,” he continued with hands on his hips, “I feel like I should in some ways thank you, for giving us that perfect girl right there,” nodding at Emerson. “But unfortunately,” he said smiling back down at the suffering man, “my friend has already called dibs.” Steve raised his index finger to his ear to access his comms.
He didn’t have any doubts about that, but he was a little weary that a puppy could help. He actually thought it’d probably add more stress.
...what kind of fucking family was this?
“I can only apologize for him so many times, Dad,” Tony said with a smile, aware his Dad was just teasing him at this point. The smile faded from Howard’s face that made Tony’s disappear as well.
“Okay, well you be good. Talking to you Sam,” Steve said with a wink at an even angrier falcon. Emerson sat up and turned to her father.
“Please, for the love of God, do not encourage his behavior young lady,” Steve said before joining them to eat.
“You get the hell away from my son and grandpup! If I ever see your sorry ass even in the same
“Definitely man on man,” Peter responded with a smile, moving to follow his sister out into the living room.
[Sweet! Thanks Dads ♡]
Sam got a football scholarship, but wanted to use it for his pre-med degree.
“Right. Well, how about I pick you up around seven tomorrow?” Steve asked.
“Chocolate chip pancakes then, huh?” Steve asked her with a mischievous grin.
"Tony!" his Pop said before turning his attention to his eldest. "What's up Pete, why all the gifts?"
"Congrats Jo!" Tony said as Steve offered his own congratulations.
“Baby…” Tony started as he curled himself on the other side of Peter, circling his arms around the shaking teen.
"No," Peter said with his best press smile, "he's my little brother." The couple practically laughed in relief to each other, Peter feeling his boyfriend go rigid next to him, still holding Miles in his arms.
“You challenged me, didn’t you?” she sneered back, her pride always getting the better of her. Too much like Steve in that way.
He just gently shushed her in response, rocking the two back and forth until her tears eventually subsided.
Tony hadn’t let her say another word. In three quick moves he was in front of her and bringing her into his crushing embrace before quickly sitting down in her spot. She was frozen in his lap, unable to see Steve move behind her to embrace the bear hug, lips resting on the back of her head. Peter had flipped around the couch to join on Tony’s side, snaking his arms around to cling to his crying sister – also partially in the billionaire’s lap.
“I take it back, you’re an evil genius,” Tony murmured while Steve turned him around to lean against the wall, squatting behind him to use his mouth to open him up. Steve used his hands to spread those gorgeous cheeks apart, the blonde smiling at the cute pink swirl waiting for him before answering his husband.
Well, as screwed as a millionaire could be - which meant his father paid his way out, with the agreement he would leave the country and never come back.
“Yeah, not something a lot of people know, but yeah. He’s three and lives full time with his mom.”
Now he stood, taking deep breaths as he willed himself to try not to be so furious with her.
“Regardless, you won’t need to worry about him anymore. He signed away his rights.”
She squeaked in protest and couldn’t help reaching a hand back to protect herself.
“I thought I would offer something...that takes anger out in a more satisfying way.” The statement confused her for a moment before realization fueled the flame in her chest.
He’d never noticed this about Clint before, but he realized he wore a flesh-colored hearing aid.
“And you? How are you doing Joey?” her Pop asked as he reached over to tussle her hair in playful greeting.
“You don’t know what you’re talking about! You have no idea what you’ve done. SHE made me happy, and you decided to take that away from me!”
He approached her quickly, which startled the teen enough to jump back, even when he raised his hands up in surrender.
“If you think I’m going to let a selfish little whore like you destroy the very company I built…” Howard growled out just as the sounds of a truck pulled into the driveway. Tony never thought he’d love the sound of truck tires on gravel, but it was currently music to his fucking ears.
“That’s so sweet of you, Petey-pie! I was excited to hear I got to pick you up too,” Steve said with a smile once he got seated in the driver’s seat. “How was school today?” he asked as he began driving them home.
“Really?” the Alpha asks above him, insecurity in his voice even as Tony could feel the Alpha hardening at the prospect.
"The teachers, I heard them say...they said I was a charity case. A publicly stunt."
“Lunch is ready!” he called to the people in the living room, smiling at the sound of tiny pounding feet joining them in the dining room. Even though Nat and Clint joined them, they kept themselves fairly clean and after lunch everyone migrated down to the gym floor - minus Tony and Bruce, who were still down in the lab.
“Hey!” he barked out to the red devil, suddenly angry for his ego’s sake. “What the hell man I had them!” Miles had never even heard of this guy, so he wasn’t sure if he was friend or foe.
He was distracted by these thoughts when he heard people talking outside his thin-walled room.
“How’s my favorite future-employer doing?”
“It’s not just that, it’s also the way he parents her…like he won’t listen…”
She stole a glance at Tony, who somehow not only was still asleep, but managed to roll himself up further into a blanket burrito. She smiled again before answering, “we survived.”
“Laugh it up, buttercup,” he said without looking at her. She knew there wasn’t anything behind his anger, catching him smiling from time to time. They waited in silence the rest of the way, still remaining silent as Sam led the way to the closest exit on the ground floor. She smiled at his childish antics as she turned away from him once they were outside. There was a beautiful blooming tree with purple flowers she wanted to get closer to. She ignored Sam’s “hey!” as she continued walking.
Telling everyone else was easy, since everyone’s reaction was ecstatic.
Even if she did look cute curled up on him, occasionally pointing a finger at a picture on the page and garbling a response around her thumb. He still would’ve liked to have drawn in peace…just once after she’d been born.
“What?” Tony asked, head cocking to the side in confusion.
“You went to see your mother?” Steve inquired as she maneuvered herself to be able to see the three people – still sitting on Tony’s lap. She only nodded in response.
He was seething with rage, sitting on his bed and trying to control his breathing. Vi had just called to tell him that SHIELD had found out about the two and promptly fired her. He could feel his blood pulsing in his veins, and even though his mind felt a little fuzzy, he definitely had a one track mind right now. And that mission was to find whoever is responsible for hurting Vi’s feelings and making them pay.
“Come on Jo, now walk to Uncle Steve,” his brother said. She looked up at him, pure excitement in her eyes as she waved her hands excitedly at her uncle.
“Xavy, your sister was giving birth to your first nephew. And she needed you to drive her. I’m not mad at you ya goober.”
“Oh honey, do you know who his father is? It was his fourth word,” he admitted, laughing with her. “But yes please try, see you soon.”
"I'm sorry, did you think our hard working, incredibly smart and beautiful daughter does
“I have a right to meet him, Tony. Here, take my card. When you grow up and realize that pup deserves to meet his Alpha parent, call me,” Ty said as he handed Tony a card before finally walking away. The Omega took a second to collect himself, putting the card in his pocket before turning back to head towards his boys.
Jo felt old feelings resurface as she guided the two out of the gym and into the girls locker room.
The running warm water cascading down their bodies only added to the pleasure of the whole experience. As it usually did.
Several pictures of her in what looked like her partaking in drunken shenanigans with her fellow classmates.
“Touché,” he said, ruffling her hair to annoy her and laughing when he got the desired results. She quickly unbuckled to exit the vehicle, racing him up the steps with her bottle rattling in her hands. He took a minute outside the steps, glancing up at the clouds and thinking of his big brother.
"Alright Petey, what are you trying to butter us up for?" his Pop asked as he accepted his bouquet of daises and chocolate covered pomegranates.
have discussions with my son, I don’t start by throwing him down some stairs,” Joe growled out as he crossed his arms over his chest. That’s when Tony noticed Sarah at the door, phone against her ear as she spoke softly to someone.
“Is Mr. Rogers…?” she inquired.
He couldn't help think about it though, when the three of them were playing video games and joking together. Both dads were off on an Avengers mission so Wade and Peter agreed to stay at the Tower until they got back. Emerson had left to bring back some take out for the group, arriving home as Jarvis informed the boys of their sister's arrival while they continued playing. She brought the bags in as she joined them in the game room a few minutes later.
Happy left the bags on their floor before riding back down, having other jobs to do today. The father and son grabbed the other bags to drag them in to the living room, joining Steve and Emerson as they sipped on some of Steve's hot chocolate. Emerson shared her cup with Miles who abandoned the bags to sit next to her, carefully sipping the mug as Tony moved to sit next to his husband.
“Nuh uh. I covered for your ass, you owe me a straight answer,” she said as she stared him down, chipping away his resolve.
“Sorry, your place is more overwhelming than I thought it’d be,” she explained as she made her way to sit on the other side of Tony and Peter.
“Exactly my point!” Tony startled Emerson and Steve by quickly standing up. He turned his full attention to Emerson. “How should we exact your revenge? Get them expelled? Have their parents fired and relocated to Utah? Have Iron Man pay an unexpected visit?”
After a few rounds, they decided it was time for presents and cake. The only clean ones were May, Pepper and Peter - all who opted out. Everyone else was covered in dirt and paint splatters, sitting around the wooden tables under the canopy.
“Thank you Howard,” Steve said instantly, meaning every word as he kept his father in law’s gaze to drive his point home. The older Alpha gave a small smile in return before turning around, heading towards Maria to switch places with Pepper. “It’s going to be okay, Harley. I promise.”
was the only thing she could currently focus on…
“I’m going to the game room,” she said after pulling away from her father. “I think I could use a distraction,” she said as she turned from the pair.
“Yes, well…this is my
“I got a letter from my birth mother, inviting me to her wedding and to meet my little half sister,” she word-vomited out before she could second guess herself. Her brother in law hummed to himself, looking deep in thought over her words. That was something she’d always loved about him, both as a King and a brother in law - he always thought long and hard before he spoke.
“Jesus Clint,” Barney said with a laugh, “get your scrawny ass off me, you’re squishing this cute little puppy.” Lucky barked in agreement, running over to James to greet him.
All eyes turned to Emerson, who was visibly failing at keeping a straight face. “I was simply asking Peter about his…linguistic choices…then asked Steve if he approved…of said…linguistic ch-choices” she finished laughing. Tony looked to Steve for confirmation.
“Right, um, Emerson wants to talk to you. I was just here to play naked referee.” With that, his husband smiled before he left the two, shutting the door behind him. The super soldier made his way to the bed, sitting down and leaving space for Emerson to join him. And she did, after another beat.
“How’d you do it?” he heard her mumble, causing the genius to smile.
“Are you even gay?” Joey asked bluntly, not really wanting an apology.
Fingers on his pulse...he finds a beat. It’s weak and slow, but it’s there. He lets out a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding. That’s also when Miles suddenly hears sirens approach them.
"No," he said as he slowly moved her to see her face better.
– which he should be focusing on! Considering the two men had turned to him and were currently trying to get his attention.
“No, no Harley Daddy isn’t mad at you bambino. I’m mad at Tiberius. Now, you’re not in trouble, but I need you to tell me what he said.” The Omega focused on tampering down his anger to hear his son out.
“I...goddammit. Fine. I overheard him talking to Bucky about having second thoughts about our marriage.”
Tony caught the crying boy who had flung himself at him, quickly scanning his body for injuries as the boy pointed behind him.
“No. I honestly didn’t,” he said, hands up in surrender. “It’s just…after being frozen for seventy years…well…if I let every unbelievable thing shock me, I’d have lost my mind a long time ago. Plus, being married to your Dad for twenty years, I’ve learned to accept chaos.” He smiled a little at the thought of his husband as she continued staring at him.
Instead, to Tony’s disappointment, they headed to the mall the following Saturday.
“What’d I do?” the brunette asked cautiously as he protectively crossed his arms across his chest, still staying away from his angry husband.
Which, he reasoned that any high school would treat him this way, but at least in this school the people were slightly more interesting.
“So, Emerson,” Tony started, waiting for his husband to sit on the other side of her before continuing. “We’ve been talking. And since you’ve been here a while, it only seems right to…” the genius found himself suddenly lacking words, thankful his husband spoke up.
anymore. And tapping my foot is turning into a nervous habit, and habit forming shouldn’t be encouraged – you’re still laughing!!” she said accusingly as she playfully shoved him back. His head landed on the pillow behind him, smiling as he rubbed his hands over his face – honestly not sure what to say as he looked up at the ceiling.
What happened next, Miles will be the first to admit he could’ve handled it differently. It’s just, Harry lunged for the spider, so Miles felt compelled to do the same. However, the spider wasn’t the only thing on the table. There was the chemicals they had experimented with.
Wave after wave of sadness washed over her as she laid there crying, unaware that the punishment had even stopped. Steve had been rubbing her back and whispering words of encouragement, but she didn’t notice anything until he reached down to pull her underwear back up – her pajama bottoms long since kicked off.
“Yeah, sorry my negotiation does not include trade. I’ve always been the big brother, it’d be too weird to suddenly have one. Plus, and I would never say this to her face, she’s a decent big sister.”
That was, until the pup got sick.
“He raped me, Steve. Got me drunk enough so I couldn’t say no,” pausing to gage the man’s reaction. Steve felt anger growing in his chest but did his best to contain it. The laugh that Tony choked out next broke his heart.
“What? Wait, where are we even going there’s like three hours left of school?” she asked as he continued dragging her right out the front door.
“She won’t be here long enough to sit down,” Steve said evenly. He ignored Nat ‘ooh’ing in encouragement behind him and focused on the one with the information.
“Don’t!” his uncle shouted, stopping Peter when his mouth opened to try to reason with him with a finger point. “I’m calling your dads and then giving you two a ride back to the tower – where they can adequately punish you. Cause if you were
He was thankful when his Pops opened the door, bending down to pick up his excited granddaughter. The blonde welcomed them in and led the way down the hall to the living room, giving the seven year old space as he hid behind Wade. Pete walked over to his Dad sitting on the couch as Isaac clung to him, slowly waking up, rubbing his face in the man’s neck until he realized where they were.
Okay!
“I’m sorry, are you
"I want Iron Man pj's," Miles said with a small smile, earning another cheek kiss from the father. Tony gently put his son down to look through the drawers, smiling as Miles got undressed without being asked and used Tony's help to put on a fresh pair. The genius then stood up and went to strip his bed, throwing the soiled blankets in the hamper. Then he moved to the bathroom to grab a few towels before haphazardly throwing them on the boy's bed. He knew he didn't have the heart or the energy to put the boy back in his own bed, opting to pick the boy back up and lead them to his own bedroom.
"He-who-wants-to-leave-me makes a good point though," his Dad added more seriously.
“That I am. Now, let’s chat about our mutual friend Xavier.”
“He’s in custody Rogers,” she reassured, “Joey’s safe inside with the medics as a precaution.”
PETER
“I appreciate you trying to spare my feelings, my love…but I’m your
I saw somewhere online the idea of the Sarah Rogers foundation, where Steve starts a non-profit that helps single moms; homeless, victims of domestic violence, immigrants, etc. Too cute not to include <3
"So wait, why didn't you trust us with that?" Steve asked, a confused look on his face.
The sun felt good on his skin, as did the sand he had dug his feet into. He kept his eyes closed, listening to the sounds of the waves along with his family. After the party was postponed it was later canceled, the fathers deciding they’d commemorate twenty years by spending some time with their kids. Pepper helped them book a vacation for the next two weeks, promising she’d take care of everything else.
Steve couldn’t help laughing at that, warmth filling his chest at how absolutely ridiculous this man he loved was. Still finding a way to make him laugh when their shit bricks keep piling up…
Her birth mother.
She takes shuddering breaths that quicken beyond her control, hyperventilating to the point that she feels like she’s suffocating.
“Stahp!” Clint laughed out when the brunette added his devilish hands to his ass, pinching in all the ways that made the blonde shriek. Lucky took that opportunity to continue his own assault, making Clint feel more loved and happy than he had in a while - even covered in slobber and unable to breathe.
Xavier released her arm once they got inside.
“Does it suit her majesty?” the blonde asked her sarcastically with a smile.
He extended his hand before asking, “how bout some hot chocolate?” glad she returned his smile and offer, standing up with him and following him to the kitchen.
“It’s nice to meet you little monkey. You too Rhodey,” Steve said, sticking his hand out in greeting to the other Alpha, who’s posture had slackened as his expression turned mischievous.
The Hulk, however, she hasn’t seen in weeks! Daci rushes off to the elevator, sprinting into the gym with her aunt and friend waiting for her.
She would try to give this woman a chance...but there was just something about her Daci didn’t trust.
“I called Dr. Strange, he said it should wear off in a few hours,” Bruce spoke up as they breathed a sigh of relief.
is in timeout and
“I think I was seven,” Steve said, not fond of this memory. “I was watching TV and Speed was on. I…got excited about Keanu and my body showed…” When she giggled, he reached back to grab a pillow and gently smack her with it.
“Father?” Tony asked Ty, hearing his son show Steve his other bags of toys while the blonde Alpha shrugged smugly.
.” Steve patted Emerson and Peter on their shoulders, ushering them to follow him out. He ignored their shocked faces, similar to the ones left behind in the office, as well as the screeching that began once the door closed as continued their journey to the car.
“Yeah, so...I thought at the very least you deserved an explanation. I’m glad I ran into you and um...anyway, you’re free to go. I know an Omega with another Alpha’s pup isn’t exactly most people’s cup of tea.”
was indulging
“Alright, enough Tony.”
“How’s our boy doing?”
“Not a problem,” he said as the waiter came forward to take their drink order.
“No it is, you just shouldn’t believe all of them,” he offered matter-of-factly. He let her playfully shove him for the sarcasm.
“Right...so...you know Norman Osborn?” Miles asked as Peter felt the color drain from his face.
“You’re officially ungrounded for the next twenty four hours, Petey,” Steve said remaining on the bed. Emerson was standing next to her brother with a smile on her face. Peter, on the other hand, only offered a small smile as he looked at his sister.
“Where’s Dad, huh squirt?” she asked the boy as she grabbed a blank page and some crayons to start a drawing.
“Do you know who I am?! Tell me where he is or you’ll lose your pathetic receptionist job.” Tony felt his blood boil as fury burned completely through him. He heard his husband off to the side speaking to him, but he ignored everything in favor of finally confronting that piece of shit.
Warning: the following chapter contains police brutality. I, as a white person, will never understand the struggle POC go through. I do not mean to make light of racial injustice or systemic oppression, nor do I mean to portray Tony or Steve as 'white saviors.' I wrote this chapter several months ago, but would like you to know the name Ahmaud Arbery, an innocent man out for a jog who was murdered by two white men on February 23rd - only recently charged due to public outrage of seeing the video.
“And why would we break up at all, cutiepie? Don’t tell me there’s someone else,” Tony said in a teasing tone, though Steve could hear the underlying insecurity. Steve quickly shook his head no in reassurance.
She was
When they got inside, Buck grabbed a coke and followed Steve, leaving Sam to his own devices. The music was loud, but that was expected at any party. Although, if Bucky had to guess...it seemed Stark went more all-out than he normally does.
She studied his face, not liking how he was still looking at the doorway she exited with a dopey grin on his face. He took a deep breath before sighing and eventually turning his attention back to his child. Who was just glaring back at him.
"I love you too, my beautiful soulmate," Tony replied, pushing as much love as he could through the bond as they shared another heated kiss.
Shit.
“We’re doing some yoga, I’m not letting you fall back into depression when you’ve made so much progress with your mental health,” he said – completely calling her out.
It was two hours before his oldest woke up, sleepily joining them in the living room before perking up at the mention of donuts. They were technically related by blood, but Steve was starting to suspect Peter would be a clone of Tony. And since Harley was starting to copy Steve’s mannerisms, it was probably safe to say nurture won out over nature.
It involved a lot of fucking.
It was literally by the week with this kid, last week Steve was the only one who could make him feel better.
It was Trevor, Susan’s husband, whom Steve never really liked from the beginning.
“I can do it.”
Her Pop doesn’t say anything on the ride home. She kind of feels guilty, sure that Peter never put them through anything like this. No back-stabbing prostitute relatives from his past to show up out of the fucking blue. She momentarily remembers they were going to eat, then realized he must have left the food on the side walk by accident, dropping it when she grabbed his hand to exit.
“Wait, Steve! I need another kiss. I can feel darkness approaching,” Tony said with a smile and his eyes closed. He opened on eye to see Steve look up at the ceiling before moving to accommodate his husband’s request.
, she thought to herself as she grabbed her loosest pair of pajama bottoms – which she happened to steal from Steve – before gently taking off her undies. They were way too snug for her current condition.
“What?” Bucky bit out at the billionaire, quickly snapping at attention at the mention of his daughter’s name. “What are you talking about?”
. Apparently Emerson lied yesterday at dinner when she told fake stories about how her day at school had been.
It was him, probably writing some equations based on the concentration on his face. His brows were furrowed and his tongue was sticking out, drawn in pencil with astounding attention to detail. Tony stared at if for a few more seconds before flipping to the next page.
He really loved this kid.
Everything was looking great with the pregnancy, prompting the pair to decide to start telling people.
“What? No? But she wasn’t calling me that, she was – “
“Lunch?” he whispered aloud, causing the older woman to look genuinely shocked at the news.
“She beat your ass!” Rhodey laughed out.
, it wouldn’t be worth it,” Cara quipped at the boy. Most of the cafeteria had started to quiet to listen in on this interaction, so an uproar was heard of laughter and ‘ooh’s that chorused alerting the rest of the cafeteria.
So who was…?
“Could you help me make some coffee?” Steve asked before she could answer, ignoring the frown Tony gave him. The brunette relented, standing up to walk to the kitchen. Steve followed behind, happy to explain once he made sure she went to do as he’d told her to.
PETER
He hears his sister scream in the distance, mind fuzzy but able to see the man in red run in the direction of the scream. Regardless the man’s intention, he needed to get to his sister,
"Miles. Miles Morales."
“You stupid fucking cunt! I’ll kill you for this you fucking whore!”
“Thanks cub.”
“Up to you, kiddo. You can color for a bit while we fix you guys a snack, or we can do the tour and then color and eat a snack, or we can do snack first, that’s always a fabulous option,” the man said as the toddlers giggled and an actual smile appeared on the boy’s face.
"In fact," the usually-less-gross father added, "I think he and I need to have a quick word about that kind of behavior," clearly enjoying the loud groans coming from his two eldest.
“Nightmare,” Bucky said quietly with a sad voice, gently maneuvering the boy’s face to turn towards the men. “Pete, wake up. Look who’s here.” Steve watched as their son blinked himself awake, his eyes bulging comically when he realized who he saw.
For a brief moment, he considered taking the coach up on his offer to talk in his office. Even though Coulson wasn’t his gymnastics coach, he’d always looked out for the shorter blonde.
“You’re a good man Leonardo!” her Dad called after him before turning back to Emerson. “Not jumping in?”
The almost twenty year old smiled along the way, glad for the chef since his family otherwise would've had to rely on take out till his Pop came back. The elevator ride was short as he made his way to the living room where his sick family was waiting for him.
Which is why the Alpha did his best to comfort the pup without holding him. He set up pillows and blankets in the living room, grabbed the pup’s teddy bear and put on a dinosaur movie marathon. He brought tissues and a trash can, since the pup had already thrown up once at school. He also grabbed him some juice and gave him medication, making the same face as him when he drank the yucky red liquid.
“But you are already there for him. Sweetheart, as harsh as it sounds, he needs more than you. And the reality is it might take him a second to come to terms with that. I went through a few shitty boyfriends before I met your dad. When I met him, he was still mourning your mom but still gave me the patience as I figured out my mental health. I saw a therapist because I finally felt ready to do so. And your dad slowly healed from losing his wife. We were good for each other...” she trailed off with a smile, looking off to the side like she did whenever she talked about her husband.
,” Steve whined as that bastard just kept teasing the blonde, standing up off the bed and grabbing the blue bikini cut.
“He won’t think differently of you,” Pepper the Fucking Mind Reader said, a small handle resting gently on Tony’s shoulder. He still scoffed, his insecurities always getting the better of him.
Tony scoffed, wondering who on Earth still used land lines. Steve, obviously. He was about to run the idea by Peter – as he knew his friend was just being polite at this point; Rhodey may have mentioned when he first got there that he couldn’t stay long but could never say no to Pete…which Tony of course took full advantage of to exact some revenge.
“I don’ wanna,” Lilli complained as Tony walked over to sit by the toddlers and pull their granddaughter into his lap.
“You don’t owe me anything, love. But...I would never turn down any appreciative gestures from you
“JARVIS, what are Tony’s vitals?”
The Captain drummed his fingers against the counter, wondering why the two had gotten into a fight on the first day of school.
“Hey baby, did you tire out your Uncle Rhodey?” the Omega asked as a dark skinned Alpha quickly joined them.
“I’ve actually got a date tonight, and no I’m not giving you any details,” Sourpatch said to Tony pointedly. “But I look forward to the cobbler when I come back tomorrow,” Rhodey said with a smile, standing up and stretching out. Tony stood up to walk him out, smiling when his family wished him farewell before walking the taller man to the elevator.
"What if you intern at SI during the day and patrol most nights? I won't even grumble about turning down the ten colleges you got accepted too," his Dad said in compromise. Peter's brows furrowed as he opened his eyes a little, skeptical of the other father. His Pop just rested his head on top of his Dad's head after wrapping his arms around his husband's waist; surprisingly smiling at Peter.
“Oh, I have a way to make it up to you…” Tony said with a sing-songy voice. Curiosity getting the better of him, he shifted around to face the man with a quirked brow.
"What's going on?" Sam called from the grill, the others all turning their attention to the ones in the pool.
What did surprise her, was one of the girls walking alongside her. Cara Sams, the gorgeous teenager Joey was head over heels for. They were actually friends once upon a time, back when they were in second grade. The one who recently started dating a jock and apparently was now friends with Staci – the skinny bitch set on making Joey’s life a living hell.
“They are?” she asked hesitantly as she inched closer.
He parked his car outside of the school, stepping out and looking for a mini-Tony amongst a crowd of tiny kids.
Her fist was raised to knock, but she can’t make herself do it.
“It was good! Guess what? I made a hundred on the spelling test!”
Familiar arms wrapped him from behind, blaming the loud coffee machine for not being able to hear his husband join him.
She didn’t have to say anything, just gave him a look that was both sympathetic but also threatening. Kind of a -
"It took you like thirty seconds, you attention whore," the brunette said getting a genuine laugh from his daughter and a glare from his husband.
"No one's looking, let's take this one."
“Huh,” the Beta said aloud as his face formed into an inquisitive expression.
“I’ll ask Leo, your both being called to duty,” Em said with a smile as the two men reluctantly joined their toddlers in the pool. She watched them for a moment, smiling at her ridiculous family as Leo made his way back around the pool and sat next to her. “Hey Leo, do you need any floaties or a life jacket?”
“You know why they do that right?” Bucky asked in his ear, wrapping his other arm around the blonde to squeeze him. Clint could tell what he was hinting at, but went for feigning innocence.
is ready to talk about it. That might take time, and I’m not saying that won’t suck. But if you love this boy, and I think you do, you’ll just need to be patient.”
“On the phone with his boyfriend, last I saw.”
“Hey Pete, why don’t we all go down to the gym and play until your dads get back?” she suggested with a smile, knowing Tony had sanctioned off a small corner for a jungle gym and swing set.
“Dear god, please disregard everything that man has said about me.”
“I never said that, and we are not having this conversation right now.”
“Yeah? Then let me take a look to confirm,” he said, having a stare down with his teenager.
“I could make a few guesses, sir,” he said hesitantly. Fury leaned back against his chair, face unreadable as he sighed heavily.
"We were just talking on the ride up here how much you've grown, and what a beautiful young woman you've become -"
"We got called to the Stark Mansion...and Tony Stark was hitting on our Steve. I’m telling him to take the compliment,” Sam said matter-of-factly as he went to grab his food from the fridge.
“But I want him to be happy,” she said with a frown as Steve finished up the sandwiches. The blonde took that opportunity to wipe his hands with a towel before moving to stand directly in front of the girl.
"Oh that's right! Miles, you remember how you didn't get to meet all the Avengers at your adoption party?" waiting to continue until the boy nodded, "well your Pop and I want to take you guys to meet one while we go on vacation."
Honestly, it was detention that got her thinking. If Mr. Jefferson wasn’t such a colossal dick, she would’ve gone straight to May’s. And…it didn’t help that she’d spent the whole week babysitting her adorably annoying little brother.
Steve felt himself smile at that.
“Jo…”
Steve didn’t love it, but he promised if it ever meant speaking one on one with the pathetic excuse for a man, that Steve would be in the same room.
“Keep waving that knife in my face and you’ll be the one facing punishment, pal.”
And he didn’t feel like ending up in the hospital.
Tony had always been straight forward with her, earning her trust very early on. Maybe he really meant that.
that the same man tried to give me to her immediately following my father’s death, like that bitch seriously threw it in my face to get me to hang out with her. Her guilt of being a shitty person for sending her son to suicide made her reach out to me before she…dies….of breast cancer. Which is genetic. So yeah… add that to the list of medical concerns I have – on top of motherfucking epilepsy. Plus…the girl I’m in love with is a closeted coward and to top it all off - !”
EMERSON
“Oh, okay. I see where you were going,” the blonde said absently as the older brunette shot him an offended glare. As his two ridiculous parents began arguing, he took their three empty plates to the sink to start cleaning them.
When Cara found her alone and started talking to her.
“Oh, so you humiliate and talk down to all of your students? Do you also fuck with
He pulled his tablet out, sure he wasn't going to sleep after just drinking that sweet nectar of the gods. Miles remained silent through Tony moving them to settle more comfortably, and remained silent even as the genius heard movement in the kitchen. He recognized his husband's footsteps instantly, reaching his cheek out to accept the kiss the super soldier had leaned down to give him.
Steve and Tony shared a look before grabbing their plates to eat as well.
Harry.
“He’s getting it done quickly to put everyone’s mind at ease. It’s not because we couldn’t put off such a procedure for a while, he’s not dying from this – I promise,” Steve said as he took a drink of his water. She looked back at Tony who smiled at her in response.
“Yes! Thank you baby girl,” her Pop said as her Dad reemerged out of the water, sputtering and shooting her a glare.
Or showing them enough.
She sat there frozen, realization settling in her stomach.
“You pay your legal team the big bucks for a reason, give them a chance to do their job, alright?” He glared at her for a moment, hating how damn smart she was.
“Yeah,” she said agreeing and turning to smile at him in his rearview mirror. “I guess I was just wondering about my mom’s family. What happened to them, Dad?”
“When’s the last time you took your meds?” Steve asked Joey gently, running his hand through her hair.
“Hey you two, why are you guys hanging out in the shallow end?” her Dad asked as he swam over to sit next to them. Emerson looked over at Leo, giving him a chance to answer before she made something up for him.
He nodded to her when she looked back up at him, smiling with her as she put on the glasses.
PETER
“I don’t like it when people lie to me or talk down to me,” she began – continuing when she saw Kate taking notes, encouraged by her sincerity. “If I don’t want to talk about something in that moment, I ask you don’t push it. I can…maybe…in time…but, sometimes it feels like my brain shuts down. Like, whatever I was thinking about is ripped away from me…” she trailed off, feeling it happening again.
(seriously, it was still weird that they got married)
Unfortunately for her, a flashback also decided to join the party as her vision quickly went black.
But he did, so he decided to make it right with his best and oldest friend.
“Yes, that is exactly why you can’t meet him,” Peter snapped. He grumbled to his Pops who was taking a million pictures on his phone when Tony turned to the smiling girl next to him.
“Rumors?” Steve asked with concern on his face.
“Uh, does Leo need floaties?” she asked as her brother and brother in law suddenly sat up in alert.
“No, of course not. But you’re going to MIT in the fall…” Steve trailed off, as if that explained everything.
she said before the line clicked. He put his phone in his pocket, excited to go tell the news to the easily excited toddler…and release his friend from his temporary prison.
“Say, Petey-pie, now that you’re up…wanna show Uncle Rhodey all the songs you can do on your guitar?” He laughed when his friend’s eyes went wide in panic as the boy cheered in his arms. The toddler squirmed his way down and took off running as his oldest friend glared heavily at the man.
“Not that I in any way want to stop you…” Tony said with a smile, “but what exactly are you doing there, hot stuff?”
“He’s at your service if you need anything else, right J?”
"Emerson, I understand that you are upset right now, but I think you are misdirecting your anger. What you are about to experience may re-traumatize you and I think you actually want your father and I there," he said firmly.
“Yup! So we gotta get you out and dry you off,” his brother said as he got her out and dry with little protest. After he mostly dried her off, he reached down to drain the tub – which she took as an opportunity to run past the two, shouting at them.
STEVE
[I’m not sending you a dick pic when you’re sitting next to our kid]
To the next chapter of their lives.
Well, that and his life was about to get even more busy than the grand opening of the new Stark Expo four years ago. He had slept a total of three hours that week.
Fuck, she almost wishes she wasn’t gay cause she genuinely loved this guy.
"I already told you yankee doodle, a princess would not be interested in a peasant," she said smugly. Kori spoke up before the father could reassure her.
She even resorted to try crawling away, which tightened his hold as his rhythm never failed.
“Alright Buck Morgan should wake from her nap soon. Her teething toys are in the freezer, just stick one in her mouth when she starts crying. There’s pasta sauce from yesterday if you just want to boil some noodles for their dinner. We’ll be back around midnight. Only call us if you’ve already tried Bruce, Clint and Tasha. Alright boys, you be good for Uncle Bucky, okay?”
“Daciana! Hey remember us?” Stark asked as he suddenly hovered next to her.
“Of course we’re not, doll. Steve is a freak of nature! Soulmates are destined by the universe to find each other. We did that without destiny getting in the way, You know why? Cause the universe doesn’t decide our fate. We do. I love you with every part of my being, Clint.”
“You watch it, he’s the one implying incest,” she said with a glare Tony’s way.
Steve couldn’t help the snort of laughter, nor the subsequent full on bellowing at the purely astonished face his big brother was sporting.
“And you couldn’t
(See the end of the chapter for
Well, apparently he didn’t.
“Nope! This is my Petey!” Clint said as he blew a raspberry on the baby’s neck, making him shriek with laughter. Tony sat down on the side and let his feet dangle in, watching the other Omega fondly play with his baby. Steve settled against his legs as Harley swam over to Bucky, latching onto his uncle and watching his little brother closely.
“Thanks, bro.” For the first time since meeting him, she opened her own arms for a hug. He quickly obliged, wrapping his arms around her much smaller frame. He added a “especially if it comes to dealing with a bull’s shit.”He felt her freeze in his embrace, knowing she really heard him. Heard that he was saying he knew if that fucker of a biological father ever tried to get close to her again, he’d help her in whatever way he can. Though he was the son of a genius, he was quite the genius himself, having realized El Toro was her biological father; Robert Sanchez, Peter had seen the name in passing when they were signing the documents to officially adopt her. He had looked up that name later, researching him. Found dozens of criminal records for his alias, “El Toro,” the bull.
“Your mother was my daughter,” the woman said, causing the teen to turn back to her.
“Glad she told the truth then,” she mumbled to herself. She felt her Pop shift to gently lift her chin to look at him where he had an unreadable expression on his face.
He felt his heart pang in his chest, frowning at her also shedding tears thinking of Bucky. Steve reached his arms out to her invitingly, having an idea that would help the two out.
It was also easier to throw, which is exactly what she did to her brother in law. He caught it easily with one hand, quirking his lip at the state before smoothing the paper out so he could read it. Emerson sat back down on the couch, tapping her feet as she waited for his response.
Peter immediately followed, ignoring the agents outside demanding he stop. He rounded the corner and steeled himself.
“- just answer the question,” Tony said patiently.
"The dean of one of the colleges I'm looking into is a huge fan of Stark Industries and I was hoping you could butter him up a little, now move stinky Pete," she said as she used her foot to push him in the direction of his room.
“My sincerest apologies, Sir has pr–”
“What’s for breakfast?” Miles asked their Pop as the man turned back around to the stove.
“Did Steve tell you we got smocks? They’ll keep you clean,” Tony said with a smile, walking around to sit next to her and eat some of the crepes.
He loved Wade that much more when the man didn’t cop a feel, but rather snuggle next to the (used to be only) arachnid and add a kiss to his forehead.
“He’s cute,” Pete admitted quietly, not enjoying the giant smile spread across his love’s handsome features. “But I’m going to need more convincing than his looks. I learned my lesson from you,” he sassed the man who smiled mischievously back at him.
“Me neither,” she added, “we got an A.” He saw the way her smile turned into teasing grin, rolling his eyes at her as she stood up to leave.
“You’re a smart cookie, Stevie. Must be why you’re the one going to college.” Steve returned the hug with a fond eye roll of his own.
Especially not spineless sperm donors.
“Hi,” Hulk rumbled quietly, much different than the roars she heard when she first entered.
He looked up into his father’s eyes, feeling just a little less stressed about everything.
“Your sister, Samantha. She wasn’t Robert’s. Her father was a man named Jerry who had fell in love with me and tried to convince me to run away with him. I was furious at you…because she was our ticket out. You, me and Sammy…we were going to have a new start. And then…she…died.” Emerson froze from that.
“Wade did you pick her so you could wear a seashell bikini?” Steve asked, laughing along with his husband.
“I warned you against insulting the love of my life,” James said with a shrug.
He suspected foul play as she dodged his questions, namely where they were meeting this guy at as she drove them somewhere near the outside of the city.
He wrapped his arms around her as she slowly relaxed into his embrace, slowly feeling the warmth grow in her. He whispered words of reassurance as she maneuvered her arms to cling to him. He started rubbing her back in comfort, stopping when she yelped in pain when his hand moved to her lower back. He went rigid below her, pulling his hands up in fear as she sat stiffly on his lap. She carefully reached her hand down to feel her back, sure she'd feel fresh blood from the belt marks. She didn't feel anything and trusted her father better than her own mind, shifting on his lap so she could lift her shirt up to show him.
"Yup! Papa made your favorite breakfast!"
“Even with how I reacted to your heart?” she questioned as she brought her knees up to her chest in defense. Tony felt that
“Oh really?” Steve asked with a raised brow, their flirting interrupted by the loud and obvious coughs coming from their kids.
She was so dead.
“In the game room, Sir.”
Which would prove necessary, since the next words that came out of Stark’s mouth were “JARVIS activate snow globe” followed by the chest plate and arms of the Iron Man armor flying in and attaching to Bucky. The brunette growled in anger and tried to lunge for the billionaire, but was frozen from the armor - then everything moved in slow motion. He could see Steve out of the corner of his eye reach for Bucky as his husband cocked his fist back and squarely punched Bucky in the nose.
what all of this is about? All that bullshit about me cheating on you or...finding your replacement?” the blonde stuttered out, still in disbelief. “Because you think I regret retiring?”
“Punk.”
“Oh yeah,” Clint remembered with a smile, snuggling into the teen and practicing letting his anger go.
“Honey can you grab her a glass of water? I’ve got some pain meds here,” Steve asked quietly, not wanting to break the silence he had managed as he finished with the bandage and gently pulled her shirt back down.
After a few more shots, he was feeling tipsy and significantly better.
“Who told you that, Pete?”
“Your friend Nat asked me to keep an eye on you,” he replied, reaching an arm out to help the shorter teen steady himself.
“Great!” Daci replied enthusiastically, jumping up to change her clothes and put on her shoes. She knew her father didn’t like this idea, but she didn’t like the idea of Vivienne. So if he wanted her to spend time with Vivienne, it didn’t mean she had to be
As they drove back to Steve’s apartment, they saw flashing lights.
"I thought so too!" Wade said with a little exasperation, smiling at Emerson. "Little man must be cheating or something," the older man said as he suspiciously looked at the gloating five year old.
“That’s not funny.”
“The nurse is bringing him, Tony. Just hang on a second he isn’t far. I’m sorry I wasn’t here when you woke up my love. I was telling Peter how amazing you are.”
“Where’s the Frosted Flakes?” he asked his brother. The man rolled his eyes at him, putting Joey in the kid’s seat before pushing the cart along.
and adopted a five year old with his husband without hesitation. Took in a fifteen year old and
“He asked you…wait…so you KNEW?!” He was not amused by the giant smile on her face, nor the fake-innocent shrug she offered. “Why wouldn’t you just tell me?”
, neither violence
property.”
“I had lunch with a woman I have every right to see, and you decided to wait to tell me I could lose another dad.” The words tasted like acid coming out of her mouth, her fear of everything that’s happened finally getting to her. But she still couldn’t stop herself.
“Jarvis, can you tell Joey to come to the living room please?” Tony asked the ceiling – making Steve wonder if he’d ever get fully used to the AI technology.
"No, I trust you guys! On...most things. This is just. I'm not," she rambled.
“I appreciate the offer, but I’m just working that day. Have a good shift man,” Steve said as he made his way out, thinking maybe Rumlow wasn’t as shitty as he thought.
“Fine by me,” Daci said, feeling her competitiveness come out as she turned to Peter. “Count us down Pete.”
It was terrifying enough not to have control over her own body.
“Oh yeah? You’d kick his ass for me?” he asked with a smile. She pulled away again to look at him before answering.
“You’re right,” Sam continued more seriously, “in a perfect world we wouldn’t need to defend each other over shit we don’t have control over. But we don’t live in that world. We live in a world that hates difference. So if anyone,
"Jaaaaaaaames," Clint whined, cuddling Peter close as he addressed his Alpha. "I want ooooooone."
“What happened with the friends you were supposed to be hanging out with last night?” Steve asked, concerned.
Banner hummed in agreement before turning to Clint.
good.”
She deflated when the nurse frowned at her and added, “I’m sorry ma’am, but if you don’t have any ID then –”
“You heard the man,” Wade said, nudging the boy in the man’s direction, “to the kitchen!” he said as he led the two out of the living room. Emerson and Miles got up to follow, leaving just him and his Pop as the blonde got up to pull him into another hug.
The man who held Miles scoffed as he handed him to another man who took Miles away. Hopefully going to release him and not harming the five year old. She couldn't tell, as three men approached her with huge smiles on their faces.
“Then why are you in my room, Romanoff?” Tony teased back.
She giggled when he grabbed her face in his hands and kissed the top of her head, muttering a "thank you baby girl," before moving back to his seat. She continued laughing when she saw her brother throw his hands dramatically in offense.
"You made my baby face plant," Steve said with a mock glare to the other blonde.
RDJ has individual tattoos for his wife and three kids - thought it was cute so I had Tony do it too <3
And then shit hit the fan and now she’s going to have to endure Steve’s barbaric disciplinary methods, which he got from her Dad and Nana. She angrily thinks to herself if she ever had kids – which was looking less and less likely the older she got – she’d never hit them.
Maybe Vi would know what to do?
“That was to the dance! That wasn’t necessarily to continue-”
Her Pop rolled his eyes at the two as she shot him a glare.
And if using humor as a defense mechanism wasn’t something the genius was all too familiar with…
“We’ll be fine, Mama Bear,” he said. “And I’m sure you and Petey will get to video chat whenever he’s missing you, right monkey?” he asked the boy nodding with a smile. “See May, you have nothing to worry about.”
His smile spread wider across his face, “I hope so.”
, she thinks. Typically Happy gave her about thirty minutes to walk, but she got a text from him that he was picking her up after three.
“Yeah,” Tony said lamely…probably should’ve left that part out. But hey, he had tried to make it a policy to not lie to his kids, and she was basically an adult anyway. “I think I’m going to have to have a meeting with him to…‘
“Oh, yeah that’s a good one. I haven’t seen any of the sequels, though.”
?" Peter asked, maintaining eye contact with his Dad but smiled when he heard his siblings laugh. His father quickly conceded and grabbed the cup before immediately chugging the medicine. The man grimaced before over-exaggeratedly groaning and throwing his hands up dramatically.
“With the best…” Tony cried, dramatically fanning his face, “the BEST cock–”
“Make it fast, Tony, I’ve got a few contractors I need to call back,” his father said before sitting at the head of the table.
But hanging with her pseudo aunt and uncle was always fun. The two always stocked up on junk food and took her out for fun grown up stuff.
“You just explained your side, you disobeyed my direct orders to go to May’s after detention – which! Was that even the truth? Or …”
His voice sounds far away as her brain tries to put the puzzle pieces together.
EMERSON
Steve remembers calling the woman the day after that sweet angel was born. The day after her own daughter had passed. And that bitch actually blamed that baby for her daughter’s death and told Steve never to call her again.
After dancing for what felt like hours, the two went to sit outside at one of the small tables.
“Why are we going to the gym floor Daddy?” Peter asked.
“If he’s so busy, why is he here at the museum, with her?” the pup’s voice cracked at the end, prompting the Alpha to gently pull him from his shoulders and back into his arms. Hugging him close to his chest and guiding his bear’s head to his neck to scent.
“Obadiah Stane, his niece Sunset Bane, and love of my life Steve Rogers,” Tony said quickly, pointing to each person in turn, before facing forward to address the ringleader of this little circus. “Now, Obie. Why did you want this meeting?”
“Thanks for staying with him, Ms. Lewis,” Steve said to the woman already walking away before turning to the pup who was still sitting on the concrete. “Hey bear, you okay?” Harley didn’t answer him, just stood up and began walking to Steve’s truck.
“I think that’s plenty for me, I’d rather not drink in front of Daci.”
“You saw it! It tried to lay its eggs in my ear,” he said defensively.
“The same man that I thought was straight forward with me since day one, only to find out you also made sure to tell your
It’s just.
“Yeah, great. Let’s go upstairs. I’ll show you the kitchen so you can eat something while I go shower, sound good?” Tony asked as he shut some of the machines down. “DUM-E, go charge,” he ordered the bot before leading Steve back up the stairs.
He pictures Bucky smacking the back of his head, like a light bulb going off as he thought of how his brother had told him once he’d make a great dad.
sucks, dude. I can’t even imagine what that must be like for you. That is like, a horrible tornado of bad luck bullshit. And who the heck can you say all that to? I love your dads. But if you tell Steve, he’ll freak out and probably say something he’ll regret – whereas if you tell Tony, he’ll only focus on the last name thing because that precious puppy is almost forty and still insecure – when what you need is someone to talk to about each of those things…maybe a third party person who happens to be sitting right in front of you?” she asked with a smile and wiggled eye brows for good measure.
“All dem!” Emerson shook her head fondly, still no idea which toddler as she started to throw everything in the pool.
“Seven and a half months,” still not sure where his husband was going with this.
She didn’t return the gesture.
“I know all of that,” he said more calmly, “but last I checked SI was doing significantly better than Stone Inc in the stock market, my technology is light-years ahead of there’s and I
Peter’s eyes nearly bulged from their sockets, he could see his Pop’s eyes close out of the corner of his eye.
The laughter immediately died out after her fist collided with Staci’s face, the skinny girl instantly collapsing to the ground.
“I am sorry to interrupt ma’am, I just wanted to talk to Rhodey about Tony,” Steve said with a bashful smile.
“What do you mean, Jo?” he asked with a small smile.
“Oh I haven’t even
“Tony what the actual fuck?” he heard Steve demand as Bucky still laid on the floor, brain doing weird things in his skull.
“Daddy!” Harley cried as he ran into the kitchen, the two adults separating and continuing unpacking the groceries.
But it was not so much at the time.
“Uh, the second one,” he scoffed, as if it was obvious before joining his mom in laughing and following her to the kitchen.
“Daddy? Who was that man?” Harley, the innocent six year old asked, breaking Tony’s heart. Tony looked over at Steve, who was frowning as if he were putting the pieces together, before remembering he always tried to be honest with his son.
Something happened, something happened to Tony. He could hear his Pappy, who had been in the room with him, speaking and could feel hands on his shoulder, but it was all muffled over the pain in his chest.
happened to me, statistics on date rape, and a ‘creative writing’ assignment about why it’s important to listen to your parents.”
“Tony. We wanted a moment of your time to chat…”
Especially with his husband. When they’re alone later. In their bedroom.
," Clint whispered to the cup, drinking and almost spilling his coffee when Bucky pinched his side in retaliation.
“…what?” he asked quietly as his brain short circuited. A sneaky grin appeared on her face as the blonde’s brow furrowed in confusion.
“You hungry Harley? Grandpa ordered your second favorite kind of noodles,” his mate asked their pup who seemed to stir again at the mention of food.
“I’m losing this long gorgeous hair of yours,” Clint pouted with his bottom lip out, running his hands through the long brown locks.
“No, Steeb lissen! Lissen. I
? James, how dare you accuse us of such a thing,” her blonde father said, acting scandalized and sending Daci a wink that made her laugh.
“What do you mean?”
“I...I heard the conversation with you and Barnes.”
' into his chest. Warmth surged through him, inspiring him to begin a speech about how proud he was and how much he loved him...
“Stark isn’t that bad, he just gets a bad rep.”
because I met
“I don’t like her! I don’t like who you turn into around her, I don’t like that she takes you away from us and when she does come by the tower she brushes off the other Avengers. She’s mean and I don’t trust her,” the child bit out, tiny arms crossed over her chest that matched Bucky’s.
“Of course not Morgan, I was just teasing,” Clint said as he plucked Morgan up out of the stroller and into his arms.
“Daddy!” Harley cried, fresh tears in his eyes as he ran to the brunette. “You’re awake!”
[Home by six, Jo] Steve reiterated, surprisingly agreeing automatically.
"So, you're okay with this Daci?" Clint asked, Bucky hating the pinch of doubt in his voice.
Peter felt incredibly lucky and didn’t mind some of the sideways glances at the couple when they entered. Wade, ever the rebel, noticed some of the stares and simply grabbed Peter’s hand, interlocking their fingers. “We are just too damn sexy,” Wade whispered as they made their way to the dance floor.
He placed a gentle hand on the door, savoring the feeling of love before turning to walk back to his car.
“Alright kiddo, wanna see if the water is how you want it?” She didn’t answer, just stared at the water as she began to feel herself chickening out. “How about I go get your Tati?” he asked gently after a moment, earning him a smile and a whispered “
“Wha?”
“Yeah, yeah I did. But...in the end it brought me here. And I wouldn’t trade that for anything.” She smiled warmly at the boy who was staring at his feet, giving him the time to respond.
“Actually it’s about damn time, I’m Natasha,” the beautiful red head assured, extending her hand in greeting as well.
His Dad looked at his watch before adding, “I realize you’re both teen boys, but maybe next time one of you can keep an eye on the time instead getting lost in video games? You’re half an hour late Peter.”
Peter moved to sit next to his sister as he fondly laughed at the two boys.
“No, you apparently don’t know,” he confirmed, meeting her gaze when she looked back at him in surprise.
“Art school isn’t technically–”
“Who said I didn’t like her?” he responded, handing the plate of burgers to Steve to carry back inside. “She’s still my niece. My niece who is also a terrorist. Now come on, you said they should be back from school by now.” Steve shook his head smiling as he followed his friend back to the kitchen. Sitting at the small table were his husband and his son while he noticed Emerson was filling a glass of water at the fridge.
“Because touching your father would only encourage his behavior. His punishment is no touching.”
Turns out they didn't have half an hour, as the norse gods apparently arrived while the dads were occupied. They walked into the living room to find Emerson and Loki sitting crossed legged and facing each other on the couch. Emerson was concentrating on her hands and didn't hear her parents walk in.
“You did that for me?” she asked quietly. He nodded in response, not thinking it was that big of a deal at the time that he did it.
Clint gawked at him for a moment, thinking of someone able to walk away from him after a week and a half.
"Can we see our rooms Mr. T'Challa?" they heard Miles asked excitedly, smiling as they turned to the kid jumping up and down.
“Even better!” Tony amended quickly. “Come on Steve you know I love your work.”
“Hear what, Buck?”
“Every goddamn time!”
“Ooh, bitch you got some nerve,” Xavier growled as Joey gently pushed him back.
Wait, why was she on the floor? And…wet?
“Honey, you’re past the point of exhaustion. Your parents are here so we can catch up on sleep, spend some alone time with Harley, maybe have a date night where you and I go out and enjoy ourselves.” Steve’s inner Alpha perked up at that, his body making an involuntary grunt at that prospect before his mate quickly shut that down. “Oh no, my body is nowhere near ready for that, I mean just us, no kids, enjoying each other’s company.”
"We're meeting a dean in a goddamn warehouse?...are you finally going to kill me to get my part of the inheritance?" he asked, stopping when she did in front of the door.
Well that did wonders for Steve’s ego. He looked around, hoping for at least a note and finding none. Last night was...incredible. But apparently he was the only one who felt that way.
? Jo, I’ve never tried to give you away. Ever,” he said, sitting closer to her to address her more seriously. He felt fury grow in his gut – yet again – because of this woman. “Jesus Christ that
“Can we talk, sweetheart?” he asked gently. Tony was always careful with his words, she appreciated that.
“The bruises…” she began, looking up at the super soldier. His face suddenly got more serious, unsure how to tell Natasha. He should’ve known someone with her past would’ve immediately recognized them.
“Thank you Buck,” Steve said, feeling hoarse from his crying in the car.
So…while it confirmed his suspicions…it also raised several.
“That Carolyn is a disgusting hag and doesn’t deserve Joey,” he said, enjoying the laugh it got out of his husband. “And…” he continued more seriously, “I want to tell her it’s okay to lose family members that don’t love you. That she gets to decide who her family is from those who actually love her.”
“Well…what do
“The day I turned eighteen I moved out and in with my boyfriend. And once I told him what had happened, he treated me like a wounded animal. Tried to get me to talk to him before I was ready while also trying to get into my pants before I was ready…”
He had also swatted the brunette for that earlier. He secretly loved his husband’s reaction…but enjoyed teasing him entirely too much more to act on it. Especially when their kid was joining them for dinner.
“Sorry Barton, you’ll have to figure out another way to get a boy drunk enough to make out with you,” Tony said with zero empathy, the jerk.
“I …I didn’t mean it!” Em managed between fits of laughter, wrestling under the blankets over Tony’s lap – WHO, by the way, had simply raised the tablet above his head, the unhelpful bastard. Peter had managed to grab some blankets for a counter-attack, throwing them over Steve’s head before yelling his battle cry – jumping on the super soldier to help his sister. The three, tangled in a mess of blankets, rolled onto the floor laughing hysterically. Tony, now without a blanket, simply put his arms back in his lap and continued on his tablet, mouth smiling but eyes still on that damn screen.
Despite Steve’s offer (as well as Aunt Peggy’s, Sarah’s, Rhodey’s and Pepper’s offers), he decided he was going to see Obie alone. He was ready...he could do this.
His thoughts are interrupted by the sounds of his parents joining him in the kitchen. The blonde walked over to the stove before turning back to the arachnid.
“So, has your old man taught you any new tricks?” Clint asked.
The man Clint decided then and there he’d never risk losing again.
“Honestly, I’m not even mad at that. I’m definitely the Cher of the two of us,” Tony said fondly.
“It’s a theory, they’re super rare...”
“Yeah know, for the son of a genius, you’re really an idiot.” He looked back at her confused. “This morning he asked me about the color of your tux; and if I may add my two cents – don’t let him get a matching one.”
“Right Petey,” he said in confirmation.
“Clint how fucking dare-” Rumlow growled before shrieking in pain, Clint having shot him in the crotch without taking his eyes off Buck. Bucky watched Rumlow cry out in pain and curl into a fetal position for another moment before turning back to Clint. Not able to hold back any longer, Bucky yanked Clint closer by his jacket and kissed the man he was madly in love with.
“Ma’am, you have the right to remain silent. I suggest you do so.”
she teased.
And of course, because his ex was a piece of shit, he had to wait an hour and seventeen minutes before seeing him again.
"I love you, my perfect mate," Steve murmured against his lips.
“Hey there Daci, want me to show you what I’m making?” the tall blonde offered, which Daci took with a nod and raised arms. He gently lifted her up by her armpits before settling her on his hip. She had gotten better with physical touch and had begun to trust the Avengers, starting with Steve and Tony.
“Yeah? And what do you want to do about fuck-face?” He frowned as Tony’s smile dropped, his husband’s demeanor changing at the mention of that man.
He instead used his thumb and stuck that in his mouth, giving the blonde a taste of where the night was leading. It had the Alpha waving a waitress down for the check, which had the Omega laugh in delight.
The love of his life.
“Well, you guys let me know if you need anything. I have an entire art studio and you guys are welcome to use whatever you need, okay?” Peter stood to guide Emerson with him to the art studio before adding a quick “thanks Pop” over his shoulder.
"So that was a flashback, then?" he asked as he pulled her back into his embrace, gently rocking her when she nodded yes.
“No, Harley we aren’t getting a dog,” Steve answered for him. “You’re Daddy and I...we’re having a baby.” The Omega nodded and put both hands on his belly.
Steve and Bucky were both at eight, staying with their Pappy as their Mama and Papa were at the hospital having their little sister.
Another reason not to like this trip.
"Do you really think that's why I came for you? My entire country was basically just under attack and I went straight for you. You can't think of any other possible outcomes?" the woman replied with a little annoyance.
Shuri stepped forward into the light, both arms raised as her hands sported some badass looking weapons. The men laughed as they turned to face her, focusing on the war-face painted princess in a suit of armor. Emerson was as well, practically drooling at the sight. The men pulled their guns out only to be knocked back by some kind of energy force, stumbling to stand back up and fire at the woman.
“What about Clint?”
As gently as he could, he sat down on the bed, not wanting to interrupt or intrude on this special moment. Also, knowing Tony and now Emerson, both of whom sleep like damn starfish, there wasn’t room for him to try and curl up with them. Content, he just gazed on them, hoping to etch this memory in his brain.
Life was good.
Steve just smacked his ass in response.
“Don’t be cute, explain yourself,” he said as he rested his hands on his hips.
“Do you think you could...make me one of your baths?” she asked in a small voice, but feeling brave and confident after how she did today. And the affirmations from the adults that immediately followed only made her feel even better about her decision.
“He’s handsome like his Daddy,” Steve commented, finger swiping through the pictures and smiling at every one of them. “I’d ask why you didn’t tell me but then I’d be a hypocrite,” he said with a smile as he handed Tony his phone back. “Do you get to see him often?”
She sat there torn. Part of her thought she deserved to pout alone in bed, hours before she could finally see Tony. She didn’t deserve comfort right now.
“LeeAnn! That is QUITE ENOUGH!” Mr. Campbell snapped, obviously having had enough of this as well. Steve glared in disbelief of this so called “Christian” woman whose sons were attempting to shift their chairs as far away from their mother as possible. He took a moment to take a deep breath before turning back to the Principal who should be
He thought about that on the ride over to the mansion, which was a shorter trip than when his family used to live at the Tower. The sounds of his twins babbling put a smile on his face as he glanced in the rear view mirror, noticing Leo take everything in. His husband reached over to squeeze his knee from the passenger seat as they pulled in to park.
“Really?!” flabbergast – one of his new favorite words – Steve stepped out of the elevator, heading towards their bedroom.
“I realize you are like, the whitest white man to ever…white – but you gotta put more on a burger than salt and pepper,” his friend chastised, moving to take over for Steve.
“She’s cute, Coulson, but wanna tell us why you’re really here?” his Dad asked, handing the tablet back to his uncle.
“The doctor said you could hold him for a few minutes because of the importance of exchanging scents,” the nurse explained as he carefully took the pup out. “So I’ll come back in a few to take him back to observation. Congratulations,” she added with a smile as she carefully put the tiny pup in his arms.
The blonde quickly stepped away with a laugh, throwing a mock-glare at his husband as he walked over to Joey – cheeks always pink when he was tickled.
"Bubba!" Peter cried, tiny arms thrown in towards his brother as everyone cheered again. Steve lifted the baby out of the water so he could hug his brother, who enthusiastically hugged him in return.
“My favorite is the pachycephalosaurs!” Harley said carefully, clearly having memorized the long word. Steve smiled watching the pup interact with his family.
“That makes sense…”
Before she could step any closer, Peter yelled at her.
“Sorry, it’s just…I’m not exactly ‘out’ and…fucking Rumlow –”
Steve jerked when a hand landed on his shoulder, unaware that they had arrived, parked and his brother was trying to get him out of the car. He limply followed along, knowing that his brother was trying to talk but unable to process anything that was being said.
And only really loved one. The linebacker sitting next to her who by all accounts was too loved by the rest of the school to be her best friend.
“Oh yeah, never apologize for awesomeness,” Clint piped in. Steve sent him a look before addressing the girl again. Inwardly sad she was still skittish about expressing herself.
“Mom, come on it’s not like that-”
He only smiled back at her, arms wrapping around Peter to hug the boy.
