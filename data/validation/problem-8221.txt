Not wanting to intrude, Tony made himself busy. He pulled open the curtains and cracked open the window, breathing deeply as the first gust of sweet summer air broke into the study. He wasn’t sure if it was the dust or just the room itself that made him feel like he couldn’t breathe.
Tony’s eyes cleared and he looked away, his expression dropping wearily, guilty. “Why are you here, Steve.” He asked softly, not meeting Steve’s expression. He looked so fragile, curled into himself in his oversized clothing, shivering weakly against the cold.
“I do.”
Steve went where Tony had pointed, tugging at a moth-eaten sheet. It pulled away easily, leaving a little cloud of dust that made Steve's eyes water.
The boy remained silent, looking more distrustful.
“Do you want me to get Papa?” Daddy asked sounded almost desperate.
“I think we need to talk about what you saw, it wasn’t what you thought. Papa didn’t mean to hit me; he didn’t mean to hurt me. He was having a nightmare and thought I was someone from his dreams, he thought I was trying to hurt him. “
He didn’t understand.
Steve stared at Tony, alarm bells ringing. “Who showed you the truth?”
“It’s just the doctor, sweetie.” The nurse holding him still said, her tired eyes and fading, peeling lipstick wavering into his line of vision. She had been using the same voice all morning, an affected coo that grown-ups used when they were uncomfortable with children. It didn’t fool Tony for one second, there was a warning firmness to her hands, a disinterest in her face that threatened to verge into irritation. Tony went limp in submission, not wanting to annoy the only familiar face in the room, no matter how unwelcoming she might be.
“Doombots.” Natasha said simply and there was a groan throughout the tower even as Steve ordered them to suit up. Tony remained silent as he to his feet, neck cracking at the sudden stretch.
Steve nodded, his head spinning. The A.I. had mentioned Stark Resilient. But Steve didn’t know what it was, or at least he didn’t think he did.  But after everything, if Tony said they were safe here he was inclined to believe him. Automatically, he reached down to his wound, surprised when he found it was wrapped up, bandaged anew. His suit had been peeled off once again.
They sat quietly for a few moments, Steve struggling with a question that had been lingering in his mind since he had seen the future where he and Tony were together. Across the room, a machine beeped, making them both jumped.
“Men are like that, they eat and drink and fuck like animals, unable to control themselves. And I’m left to pick up the scraps.”
Tony hesitated, continuing with a sigh at Steve’s fierce look. He ran his hands through his hair, blue pixels blurring together, jumbling up before they reformed. It made his hair look like it was floating, a halo around his face. “The Chitarui were coming. Steve sent our most powerful fighters to space, to intercept them before they came here.”
Tony snorted, running his hands through his hair. “Sorry, a message from the other me. I better go and see it.” He stood up, stopped by Steve’ hand curling around his wrist.
“You’ve been gone a long time,” Bucky said. He held out his hand, palm up, fingers spread. It was a familiar gesture; one they had done a hundred times throughout the war and after. A signal of their friendship. Steve only hesitated a second before taking Bucky’s hand. The man dragged him closer, squeezing his hand hard. “I’m really glad you’re back Stevie.”
“What was that? Has he ever done that before?”
The coffee machine pinged distantly in the background and Tony remained still, fighting with himself.
Running a frustrated hand through his hair, Steve continued on.
Peter threw himself desperately into his Daddy’s lap, pressing his face into the man’s soft t-shirt and fisting his hands into the material.
Tony rolled his eyes. “F.R.I.D.A.Y., the other Steve Rogers.”
“Tesoro.”
Steve looked down at his hands, remembering his previous time jump and the loving if the uneasy relationship between himself and Tony that he had found there. He remembered Tony’s fragility, the self-doubt and neediness in him. It would be easy for Hydra Cap to manipulate that, to twist it. He clenched his fists together. “Tell me what I need to do.”
Peter didn’t know why but as Daddy leaned into the hand on his cheek, pressing the bruise against Papa’s fingers even though it must have hurt, he decided he didn't need to worry so much.
“You haven’t been yourself lately and you haven’t been sleeping…”
“Tony, Tony,” He said, reaching out and righting the man so he was slumped against the slimy alley wall behind him. He had to keep his hands on Tony’s biceps, the man lilting dangerously to the side without his support. Tony’s breath, Steve realised, stank of stale alcohol. Steve’s heart sank.
Tony hesitated. He could feel his mother watching him, her eyes focused on him from behind the big dark lenses of her sunglasses. He shrugged, wriggling in his seat.
Peter had thought his Papa could make everything better, that he’d protect them all because he was Ccaptain America, but he’d been wrong.
Tony felt his mouth fall open, shock robbing him of his words for a second. Whatever he thought Steve was going to say, he hadn’t expected that. “Excuse me?”
Tony blinked up at Steve, his eyes wide and shocked. He was holding himself, arms curled defensively across his chest and rubbing at his bicep where Steve had grabbed him. “I don’t think hallucinations are meant to be so corporal.”
Steve breathed slowly, pain clenching through him angrily. He gave the Tony is arms one last longing look. “I will fix things.” He promised, the words fading as he was dragged away once more.
“Whoo! What did you do?” one the of the men asked, even as he stomped down hard on Steve’s bent leg.
“Are you benching me?” Tony asked.
Steve entered the lab slowly, each step carefully decided upon and stolen like a dancer entering a stage. “Hey, Tony.”
“It will keep you safe.” Tony retorted sharply. The A.I. was watching him, eyes narrowed ready for a fight.  Despite his fierce expression Steve couldn’t help but think how small and very alone he looked in the otherwise the huge, empty workshop. Who did the A.I. talk to when Steve wasn’t here? Did any of the other Avengers come and visit, did they think of him as Tony or was he just another machine to them, to be used and left behind?
Tony couldn’t help but smile back. People had very particular ideas about how Captain America should act and think, and the intensity of those expectations often made Steve clam up like an oyster, retreating to blank stoniness. It was sad because the real Steve Rogers was a little shit, sarcastic and pushy, competitive to a fault and with a mouth like a sailor when he was annoyed. Tony much preferred Steve Rogers to Captain America.
“Only a little. It might feel like a little scratch.” Doctor Everette’s face appeared in Tony’s eyesight. The man bending down to smile at him. “You can be brave, can’t you Tony?”
At home, Maria ordered Jarvis and the chefs through the changes needed to ensure Tony’s safety. All of Tony’s food had to be specially prepared and stored. Gone were his ice cream trips, the thoughtlessly stolen fruit from the fruit bowels, his fizzy soda. His mother caught one of the maids slipping him a jelly snake one afternoon and had fired the girl on the spot, holding the candy against the crying woman’s face and asking in near hysterics if she was trying to kill Tony. After that, the staff were much more careful. There were locks on the fridge, on the cupboards and all Tony’s food had to be overseen and approved by his mother, provided alongside his medication and new happy coloured vitamin pills.
“He is in his bedroom. The floor above where you are currently located.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. said finally.
“I’m still the same man that you love, that you believed in. I’ve not changed that much” The Hydra Supreme continued, his grasp on Tony softening to a caress, fingers gently tugging through Tony’s mused curls. He leaned closer, almost unable to control his excitement. “I don’t want anyone with me more than you. Stay with me, Tony. I’ll you out of here, you can do anything you want. I trust you.”
Tony turned back to the coffee maker. He pressed his finger to the button, watching as it whirred into life. A vision of his mother, coffee cup in one hand, cigarette in another rose like a spectre before him, uncalled and Tony faltered.
“What’s a little attempted murder between friends.” Tony rolled the word friends over his tongue, drawing out the vowels until it the word was soft and stretched out like toffee, slippery in his mouth. It felt like a challenge, a dare.
“I know. Steve’s memories were rewritten. Reality was changed. They made him think he was a Hydra sleeper cell.” Tony’s voice was slow, controlled as if this was an explanation about just another one of the enemies they had faced together. But Steve could hear the edge to his words, the curtness to his explanation. This AI version of Tony may have had more time to acclimatise to the reality of a Hydra loyal Steve but it didn’t mean he was dealing with it any better than Steve was.
“He can share my pot of coffee. You’d like that wouldn’t you Tesoro?”
A weak laugh escaped Tony and he looked up at Steve, “Now I know you’re a hallucination. Steve would never say he wanted me.”
Tony reached into his pocket, holding out a sad looking photograph. It was the same one he had been looking at in the park when Steve had first seen him. “You are,” he said as he handed it to Steve.
“I’ll leave you to think about my offer.” The Hydra Supreme told Tony, tugging his suit back into place. At the door he paused, his expression calm. “I do love you Tony and I will have you.”
“Didn’t you hear? I drank away my company.” Tony mumbled, chin still tucked down into his chest. His tone was scathing, dripping with self-loathing. They had reached the end of the alley and bright fluorescent lights flooded the main road, illuminated Tony’s sunken, haggard looking features. Tony came to a stop and looked across the road, his mouth twisted unhappily, his face crumpling like wet paper. Steve followed his gaze.
Maria beamed at him over her sunglasses and Tony smiled back, warm from knowing he had made her happy. Her hand, cigarette still smouldering between her fingers, reached out and cupped his cheek. “I know you are, baby. You’re my perfect little angel.”
“Have you asked him?!”
Steve took a step backward, suddenly cold. Tony was still playing this game, still messing with him just as he had been doing in the white room with F.R.I.D.A.Y. “That’s not possible.” He retorted.
Tony glanced back at the screen and it flickered to life. The human Tony’s face filled up the screen once again, his eyes moving back and forth rapidly beneath the delicate skin of his eyelids.
Even as he spoke, the avengers were dropping into formation around him; Clint found a perch on a nearby car roof, Natasha and Cap had landed behind him, herding the doombots together.
The nurse holding him down had been with him all morning. She had greeted Tony and his mother when they had arrived at the hospital, ignoring Tony’s silent, wide-eyed confusion as they were taken through the maze-like building. Tony had thought they were going back to Doctor Carter’s kid-friendly office and had been cowed by the never-ending windowless hallways and the stark, bleached waiting room. What seemed liked hundreds of people moved around them, uninterested and purposeful and Tony had spent the morning clutching at his mother, trying to hide behind her.
The AI frowned, mouth twisting, “A little offensive.”
“But what if he hurts you again. Even if it is by accident.” Peter insisted and the thought of his Daddy on the floor, looking small and hurting made the tears come again. He looked up into dark eyes and that hateful bruise and his vision blurred.
“Steve…” Tony’s voice was barely audible. Hydra Supreme leaned down to hear him. And then Tony struck. He threw his head forward, slamming his forehead into Steve’s nose. Bone crunched, the sound sharp and painful.
Steve looked around. He was in some sort of rural, park-like area, the ground beneath him was gravelled but beyond him was grass, neatly trimmed and surrounded by tall, imposing trees. Aware that he was laid out in the open air with his hands tied behind his back and blood soaking his uniform, Steve forced himself upright. Between his injury and the handcuffs, it was a struggle and sweat dripped down his forehead, stinging his eyes. Steve flexed his arms once again, cursing Tony as the metal groaned but remained unbreakable. Feeling exposed, Steve made his way for the cover of the trees, each step sent jolts of searing pain through him. Until he figured out where he was and how the hell he had got here, Steve had to assume everything was hostile. Considering that it had been Sharon who had given him the wound in his torso, that didn’t seem far-fetched.
“I’m not a good man,” Tony said, breaking free of Steve’s hands. He stumbled to his feet, batting at Steve’s hands as he tried to help. Tony gestured around the dirty alley, voice pained, angry. “Does this look like a where a good man would be? No.”
“I mean, the science is a little bit questionable admittedly,” Tony said dismissively, uncaring in the face of Steve’s panic. “But by science or magic, here you are.”
“Tony I am really sorry,”
Steve panted, sweat stinging his eyes as it dripped down his skin. He stared up at his own face, twisted with anger and cruelty. Steve smiled. “He’s behind you.”
Peter suddenly wished he’d thought to use felt tips, the red colour was much better for Iron man than his crayon had been. He frowned angrily down at his page. “I’ve done it wrong.” He muttered.
“It’s Star Wars.” Tony corrected automatically, but he was already trailing after Steve to the TV area.
“This is very confusing for me right now,” Tony told Steve after a moment. “You’re you but not you and the other you is Hydra.”
Tony blinked; somehow missing Steve shuffling up next to him until he was pressed close. A muscular arm stretched out behind Tony, resting across the back of the sofa and fingers trailing down to rest on his shoulders. Lightning quick, Tony’s mind took him back to his desire to drink once again; drinking and sex. Just making out would do. The thought made him tense beneath Steve’s hand and the man glanced down at him.
“Don’t worry, baby.” She would say, smiling soothingly when he cried. “I’m here. I will look after you.”
“No in as many words, but he’s talked about getting Tony to join Hydra, to join him.” The AI paused, choosing his words carefully. “I need you to get Tony out of there before he manages it.”
Tony snorted, his lips twitching in amusement. For a moment they were both transported, the alleyway dropping away at the easy, friendly banter. A reminder of the old times, the good times, of working side-by-side as friends. Of being better because they had each other.
Tony rolled his eyes, unphased at Steve accusation. “I gave the people what they wanted.”
Steve struggled to his feet; a hand pressed to his side. Tony darted towards him; he was slower than usual but steady, stronger than before. He reached out to Steve, inhaling sharply as his hands came in contact with the blood seeping through Steve’s uniform.
It was dawn.
Daddy had loved the gold glitter on his Ironman suit and told Peter that he was very clever to create a rainbow of colours to represent JARVIS. Peter felt a little guilty as he hadn’t exactly meant to draw JARVIS like that. Later that night, he’d told JARVIS the truth, but JARVIS said he didn’t mind. So Peter stopped worrying about it so much and promised himself he’d draw JARVIS his very own picture to make up for it.
“Steve, please-“
Steve made a noise of frustration. “I don’t understand.”
“Obadiah Stane,” Steve said with understanding.
“Nothing is going on. And even if it was, it’s none of your damn bus-
“Steve, you don’t want to see this….”  The AI was saying, voice rising with warning. Steve ignored him, batting the A.I. away as if he was an annoying fly.
Tony laughed and looked over at Steve, “I don’t think it counts when you’re my hallucination.”
Steve was going to die.
Maria swung her gaze to Tony. Her tears were gone and her eyes were bright, fevered. Tony folded himself into the bed, empty stomach clenching.
Steve ignored him, running towards the Hydra Supreme. At the last second he leaped, twisting in mid-air to land a kick to the man’s face. Or least that’s what he planned. The Hydra Supreme grabbed Steve’s ankle, using his own momentum to throw him hard to the ground. Steve landed awkwardly, only just managing to roll out the way of the Hydra Supreme’s boots. Pain rippled in icy fingers up through his torso, his wound throbbing warningly.
“I think Captain America would think that was really swell,” Steve told him.
Tony pushed his thoughts away, and looked back at Steve with a shrug, “It’s not your fault. I suggested we go and look, I just wanted to make you happy.”
“What did you do to me,” Steve asked him breathlessly. Tony ignored him, his features sharp, intent as he examined Steve. Steve reached out, grabbing Tony’s wrist. “Tony, what did you do to me.” He repeated; his voice hard.
None of it mattered though. Tony still kept getting sick.
“You’re drinking again?” Steve asked horrified. He had seen this before, seen how it nearly destroyed Tony.
Then he was gone, the door beeping in warning as it locked behind him. For a moment there was silence, calm after the storm. Then Tony seemed to curl into himself even more, folding himself as small as he could manage. One huge desperate, shuddering sob escaped him. Tony gulped air unevenly, his breathing wet and rattling, painful to hear. He pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes, rocking slightly like a child trying to soothe themselves.
“Tony…”
“It’s been a week and you still don’t know anything!”
“I don’t want any breakfast,” Tony said finally.
Steve’s jaw flexed, he could feel his hands shaking, anger thrumming him. “This isn’t you. It’s a spell. You’re a good person. You care about people.” He stretched out a hand, “You know something is wrong. Let me help you. We can fix this together. Like old times.”
“These aren’t my clothes,” Steve said, his fingers pressing hard into the white star on his chest.
His mother watched him calmly, smiling when he stuck out his empty tongue. “Well done, baby.”
Tony nodded.
“Go on then. Do what you’re going to do.” Tony hissed: defiant, defeated.
“Whoo!” Whoo!” Steve called hands out in front of him warily. The rest of the kitchen had gone silent and Tony could feel the other Avengers staring at him, watching. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to startle you.”
“I would never...” Steve turned the face, Tony, blinking at weak blue light pouring off the AI. He shook his head, jaw clenching. “I would never willing join Hydra.”
“There’s something else, you’ll need it to get into the Triskelion.” Tony gestured to a small black band resting on the table. “It’s a hologram generator. It will work with your suit. Make you fit it.”
“Oh, is it only for special occasions?”
Then Tony was gone, moving fast out of the room. In the distance, Steve could hear the blast of repulsors, air whipping as Iron Man flew to meet his enemy.
“Yeah, I don’t think so,” Steve said and charged forward. The Hydra Supreme smirked and ran towards him.
“I know. He has special nightmares, sometimes they carry on for a little bit when’s he’s awake. He didn’t know what was happening. It was just an accident.” Daddy placed him on the kitchen counter and got a paper towel to mop up his face. Peter grabbed an extra square and twisted it between his hands.
He stalked closer; eyes bright and hungry in his golden, inhuman face. “You’re an ant to me.”
Tony stopped vomiting with a gasp of relief. He turned around stiffly, his eyes streamed and laughed at Steve’s expression. “Gees, even my conscience is disgusted with me.”
Steve placed a hand over the wound, silent as Tony stepped closer, encroaching into Steve’s personal space. Up close, Steve was captured in the blue of Tony’s eyes, they were so bright, electricity captured and sparking inside his irises. Steve had never noticed Tony having such blue eyes before
Energised by a surge of annoyance, Steve pushed himself upright. Pain jarred down his torso, icy fingers tearing into his flesh. Steve gasped in surprise, clamping his hand down across the source of the pain. His side was heavily bandaged, packed with gauze. At the touch of his fingers, something rippled under his hand, a monster beneath the surface. Steve jumped in surprise, snatching his hand away. “What was that!” He shouted into the empty room.
Tony nodded, the curiosity in his features melting to concern. Steve couldn’t help but compare the man to the others he had met. His eyes judging the lines stretched faintly across his forehead, and the creases pressed into the corners of his eyes. His eyes were normal, familiar warm blue instead of the electric blue but there were lingering hints that not everything was natural. His skin was golden, radiant, his hair thick and threatening to curl around his ears. Steve felt like he had been given a series of puzzle pieces and was trying to piece them together, to figure out the order. He and Tony hadn’t been together during Tony’s time in San Francisco but this Tony hadn’t mentioned the commander's outfit indicating it matched the one the Steve from this time was wearing. That meant they had fixed the red-eyed Tony, broken Wanda’s spell.
From the car, four men emerged. There was the twitchy, scrawny man from the passenger’s seat, his gun waving in his hands as he gestured angrily. He was strung out on drugs, his pupils blown wide. From the back emerged two silent muscle men; Steve assessed them quickly – they were strong and trained, light on their feet despite their bulk. The driver’s door opened last, a slender, slick, haired man stepping out lazily into the sun. The driver watched Steve carefully, he had a scar on his mouth that had twisted his top lip and made it look like he was permanently sneering.
Tony made a noise; his eyelids drooping closed slowly.
Steve, threw himself sideways, rolling away. He got to his feet, wiping the sweat from his eyes. “I could do this all day.”
He had thought he was past this.
“Always. Now run.”
Jarvis didn’t reply, standing still next to their table. He was frowning again, mouth moving as is he wanted to speak.
Tony hesitated; half turned with uncertainty; his face twisted with uneasy. “Will you find me after?”
“You’re...”
“Tony, stop.” Steve’s voice was rising, edged with anger. “What is going on? Friday says it’s March 2015 and we’re in San Francisco and I’m not healing. Am a criminal? Are you my jailer? What happened to my trial? To the SHRA? How long have I been asleep? You look different and you’re sleeping around again? You’re sleeping with men?”
Through most of the fighting and the SHRA, some part of him had clung onto Tony, clung onto the belief that their friendship could weather anything. He had believed that the bond between them – stronger than brotherhood, more complicated than friendship would always be there. But after Steve had almost killed Tony, after seeing the violence, the ugliness they inspired in each other Steve had realised he was wrong. There had been too much anger and violence. It had poisoned everything between them and they had nearly ruined each other. So, Steve had let Tony go and given up the belief that they would ever be able to return to how things used to be. But now….
“Steve, Steve, wake up.” Daddy’s voice was soft and Peter felt a rush of relief as he spotted him, a step away from the bed and calling Papa’s name. Daddy would make everything better. The arc reactor would make Papa’s bad dreams disappear like they did for Peter.
“Well, maybe he should,” Steve told him, realising that there was some truth in Tony’s words. He should have told Tony how much he meant to him more often.
“Why didn’t you tell me.” Steve asked, “All these years and I didn’t know.”
Steve nodded and started out into the corridor.
“No Sir, my apologies.” The agent replied quickly, stifling his momentary surprise. He spun on heel, marching purposefully out of the room.  Steve spared the empty pod one final glance before following the man.
“Did it hurt Tesoro?”
“Please just a little change? Anything” One man was asking, he was hunched in on himself, hands held out beggingly.
Tony had levelled himself upright, his eyes hardened even as his arms shook under the stress of holding him up. “Fuck you!”
At some point, there had been a press conference; Tony standing in a smaller version of his father’s suit as he held up his circuit board to the flash of a hundred cameras. Howard had been stood next to him, grinning. Tony had tried to smile too but his mother’s pinched, pale face was staring at him from the side of the stage, and Tony felt off-kilter as if he’d been caught doing something wrong.
“Steve you have to go back.”
Despite the softness between them before, there was nothing gentle in the way they touched each other. They were frantic, clutching at each other with the needy desperation of two people about to lose each other forever. At some point, the flame in Steve’s gut kindled into a fire, burning through him. It was easy, instinctual to move Tony; to pick him in order to bring him closer. Tony didn’t seem surprised, his legs hooking around Steve’s hips with easy familiarity and Steve had a lightning flash of jealousy, wondering if Tony had practiced that move on other men, on another Steve.
Steve hesitated. “I’ve got another idea.” He pressed the button on his wrist band, a wave of Hydra black swallowing his suit. Tony’s eyes widened, betrayal creeping at the edges of his expression. He was getting ready to shout, to fight. Steve slapped a hand over his mouth, just in time to muffle Tony’s scream.
“What?” Steve said, lost in confusion. What was Tony talking about? He had never died.
Daddy ran his fingers along Peter’s scalp for a moment and Peter looked up to watch his familiar face as he spoke. “No sweetie, I’m not going to leave him. Amy’s parents had a different situation. It wasn’t an accident when her daddy hit her mommy. Your Papa would never hurt me or you on purpose.”
“We had lots of food allergies in my family you see, my older brother dropped dead from a nut allergy when we were children – it broke my mother’s heart. Can we test for that?”
Steve scowled, “Tony would never join Hydra.”
Tony tried to say as his knees crumpled beneath him. Steve called his name, catching him before he could hit the ground. Tony’s head lolled, dizzy with pain and he found himself cradled, neck resting in the crook of Steve’ elbow. Steve’s other hand was pressed against his stomach, holding the blade in place. It was burning now, a deep, painful ripping, and Tony could smell the metallic scent of his blood, feel it seeping through the thin layer of his t-shirt.
Steve's fingers were brushing the edges of the picture up and down, unable to look away. They were so young; things had been so easy between them. So good. A tanned hand reached out, gently resting on his moving fingers, drawing his attention. Tony was stood next to him. He was close enough that Steve could feel the heat coming off his skin, see the movement in the dip between his collarbones as he breathed.
Peter struggled against unconsciousness, rolling sleepily towards the warm body next to him. A hand came and petted his hair and Peter opened his eyes to smile up at his Daddy, knowing who it was from the way he ran his fingers gently back and forth against Peter’s scalp.
“It makes sense.” Sharon admitted finally, “Osborn is a snake. Even Stark knew that.”
The familiar sound of repulsors shattered the quiet park and Steve looked up as Iron Man flew over his head. The suit was unfamiliar, metallic and sleek. But Steve had been watching Tony fly at his side for years and the man’s movements were as familiar to Steve as his own. He predicted the little seal-like twist that Tony made in the air. A smile threatened, tweaking the corners of his mouth. Steve couldn’t remember the last time he had seen Tony fly as if he enjoyed it. Iron Man swung upright; one leg outstretched as he descended. He landed close by, merely feet away.
Peter skidded into the kitchen at a run. Neither of the adults in the room saw him, they were too busy focused on each other. His Papa was looming over his Daddy and both of them were scowling and shouting. It was going to happen again.
“Definitely not his best work,” Tony repeated, nudging the robot with his booted toe. A long shadow moved across the sky, accompanied by a familiar whirl of engines. Tony risked a look away from the waiting doombots to see the sleek crisp lines of the avengers’ jet hovering above him.
Tony looked like he was going to say more when a sharp alarm sounded around the room. Steve jumped to his feet, wincing at the pain the movement caused him.
The crowd waiting for him at the courthouse was overwhelming.
“Hey, hey!” Tony skidded into view, hands held out and waving fanatically. “You’re safe. You’re safe!”
“Right, let’s get this over.” The doctor said suddenly, looming behind Tony.
“Jesus Stark, what the hell happened to you.”
Steve lost time, finally submitting himself to the throbbing, unrelenting pain in his side. Darkness crept at the edges of his vision and when he blinked, he was lying flat on his back, somewhere new. He shot upright, fists swinging.
Steve twisted, the sharp movement sending a faint warning twinge running up his side. Tony had changed, clothed himself in something tightly fitted and dark. It covered him up to the neck and yet it seemed somehow indecent, clinging to every curve and muscle the man owned. It seemed to Steve that every outfit this Tony wore was vaguely indecent.
He’d managed to twist the sheets around him and was clawing at them desperately. They weren’t a match for his strength and he ripped them apart easily, writhing in the torn remains.
Tony flipped his mask up, assessing the damage around him. Robot parts were scattered on the tarmac around them, sparking and spasming in some sort of robotic death throes. Clint had dropped down from his perch and was poking a sizzling arm with his bow.
Tony looked at him, his face thoughtful. “Is there a reason we wouldn’t be?”
“The asset’s room. And the viewing room.” The man said gesturing the to the two doors.  “Is there anything -
She smiled and the expression stretched taut across her beautiful face. “Close your eyes, Anthony,” she told and then she was reaching down and wrapping a blanket around him, tucking it tightly around his legs and arms and right up to his chin. Tony wiggled uncomfortable, quickly overheating. Her hands were firm, holding him still, biting hard into the narrow delicate bones of his arms.
Tony laughed; the sound almost human. “Right put it on, let me see if it fits.”
“You are wearing them, Commander.” Came the lilting reply.
Pain flared up through Steve’s torso, hot fingers ripping through his inside. Steve bit his lip hard enough to bleed, not wanting to scare Tony. His mind raced. With his injury, it was unlikely he would be able to protect Tony and stop a group of men with guns.
“Yeah. Yeah. It’s me.”
“I feel fine.” He yanked his arm down sharply, breaking Steve’s grip and spinning around.
“Now, now Mrs. Stark.” The doctor said soothingly, patting her hand. Tony could see that unlike before, the reassurance didn’t please his mother. Her smile was pinched, frozen and uncomfortable on her face. “Tony seems like a perfectly healthy young boy. Children get colds all the time and plenty are picky eaters. He will probably grow out of it.”
Steve dropped down on the bed, clutching the picture and staring down at it intently. This was a romantic picture; he and Tony were in a romantic relationship. Steve looked around the room, still holding the photograph tightly. He and Tony were sharing a room, sharing a bed. Heat flared across his cheeks, his mind reeling. It had only been seconds ago that Steve had even realised that there was something more to how he felt about Tony than friendship. This was too much, too fast. Panic scratched at his throat and he swallowed, shoving the photograph back onto the side table. His fingers had left little bloody prints along the silver edge of the frame and Steve cursed, rubbing at it only to smear the blood into faint pink strips.
Without warning, Steve’s knees slammed hard into the ground. Almost instantly his legs gave way. He dropped gracelessly forward, managing to twist just in time to avoid face planting into the dirt. Fire blazed through his stomach, moving snake-like through his gut. Steve fought hard against himself, pushing past the almost unbearable pain, past the desire to let himself relax back into darkness. It was mostly stubborn determination that made him open his eyes. Steve would be damned if he was going to die with his hands tied behind his back like a common criminal.
The morning after another sleepless night Peter wondered downstairs, the floor was cold beneath his bare feet and he curled his toes up trying to keep them warm. In the hall he carefully avoided the splits in the tiling. After a while he gained some confidence and leapt over multiple stones, swinging his arms back and forth to gain some momentum. He kind of knew how kinetic energy worked, his Daddy had explained it once, but mostly he just liked the giddy feeling of almost flying across the floor. Peter knew he shouldn’t be having fun, not now that his family was going to get a Divorce but sometimes it was hard to remember since everything seemed so normal.
“How did you know?” Steve asked, cold and curious.
He twisted, tried to fight the invisible force holding him. His fingers scrambled, trying to cling onto Tony who still sleeping against his bare chest. His hands slid right through Tony’s back as easily as Steve was made of pixels.
“Could you lay off the sarcasm for once Tony? I’m trying to figure out what’s wrong with our son and all you’re doing is making it harder!”
Tony hummed. His gaze slid down Steve’s body, “You can tell the wound in your side isn’t normal.  It’s not healing like a bullet wound, right?”
Steve fell.
Tony looked at him, expression soft, warm despite the wetness at the corners of his eyes. Steve reached out, cupping Tony’s face so his thumb could brush his tears. Tony’s eyes blinked shut slowly and he leaned into Steve’s hand, rubbing against him like a cat. The heat in Steve’s chest spread, kindling low in his stomach. He could barely breathe, his gaze laser-focused on Tony’s face in his hands.
“Is this the Stark kid?”
Steve thought about the A.I. uneasily. He had been so human, so full of emotions. Being an A.I. had been lonely and frustrating for him, a painful experience for one who felt alive, who wanted to touch. He had been as self-doubting, dissatisfied as any human, driven by loyalty and guilty and love to do whatever was needed to save his Steve.
Peter glanced up to see Amy staring at him curiously. Her face was smudged with red felt-tip pen so bright it almost matched her hair.
Steve blinked, not expecting that reply. “I’ll come back after I’ve taken Tony to Stark resilient.” He offered gently.
The room sharpened into focus; shadows retreated to reveal a small, bare, white room. Steve’s first thought was that he was back in a jail cell but the room was too luxurious, too expensive. The cotton sheets beneath his skin were as fine as silk, almost slippery as he moved. The thought luxury had Tony written all it. And Tony would never let S.H.I.E.L.D. get their hands on his A.I.s. Steve must be in Tony’s personal custody. The thought made Steve feel cold.
It took Tony a few long moments before he realised the doctor wasn’t coming back. The medical team had left him hunched over his knees, tense in anticipation, and his backside exposed to the room. The familiar nurse was packing up the nozzle and the canister of pain relief, uncaring to Tony’s searching eyes. Tony’s cheeks burnt, his stomach squirming in a way that felt almost just as bad as the pain of the procedure. Their lack of acknowledgment left him feeling small, his embarrassing position barely human. Tony reached around himself miserably, dragging the cover back over himself; his backside ached as moved, bruised and tender.
“F.R.I.D.A.Y.  make sure they leave,” Tony ordered.
Steve’s face felt like a mask, hiding who he was. Any moment, Tony would look at him and see it, know that he wasn’t right. He smiled, the expression stretching tight and painful at the corner of his lips. “Just tired, it’s been a really long day.”
His stomach made a sudden, unexpected gurgling noise, loud enough to be heard. He could feel himself blushing, embarrassed that he was already like his grandfather and father, his body betraying him.  “Sorry,” Tony mumbled, curling his arm over his torso.
“I know you’re awake,” It was Steve’s own voice; echoing as he stepped into the light, shadows melting away to reveal Hydra Supreme. The Hydra Supreme was wearing black, stiff Kevlar stretched taut over his broad shoulders. His eyes were almost dancing with excitement as he approached Tony’s bed, vicious cruelty lingering at the edges of a barely controlled smile. But the Hydra Symbol on his chest was missing. The A.I. had been right, he was planning on lying to Tony.
“Tony, Tony. Stay with me. Come on Tony.” Steve was frantic, his face pale and contorted with fear. Tony wasn’t sure he’d ever seen Steve look scared before, not really.
Her hand skimmed across his forehead, pushing up his curls gently. “Oh dear, you’re burning up.” She exclaimed, her voice rising like a musical scale. “Do you feel too hot, tesoro?”
“Oh.” Steve breathed in understanding. “You want me to save him?”
“Tony?”
There was a prodding, a pressure against and then in his bum, pulling apart the muscle uncomfortably. A whine built-in Tony’s throat and he quivered, tensing – too surprised to do anything else. Then almost as soon as it started it stopped. Fuzzy, limp with confusion and relief, Tony didn’t notice when something small and hard slid back between his buttocks. The first penetration stole his breath, more in surprise than pain. The tube inserted in him pressed forward, and Tony could feel it worming its way forward, a snake slithering through his guts. He panted as the pressure and pain built up, his muscles locking up.
Tony winced, “Apparently? I can’t say I remember any of it. The only copy of the SHRA was in my brain, I had to stop Norman Osborn from getting his hands on it. It’s a long story.”
Peter froze as the voices reached him, his muscles locked and his ears strained trying to figure out where the sound was coming from.
“Not dizzy?”
The doctor smiled, the movement making his moustache curl in a happy white comma. Maria was almost vibrating behind them, fingers interlocked so tightly her knuckles were bulging and white with blood loss. She made a noise of distress as the doctor packed away his thermometer, snapping his stiff leather bag shut.
“No…” Tony dragged the word out. His eyes when they met Steve’s were piercing, stripping away the walls Steve had built up around himself.  “but from what I’ve seen, being Hydra hasn’t changed Steve’s feelings for Tony.”
“Treason?” Steve shook his head; the pain was spreading behind his eyes.  “but that doesn’t make any sense.”
“Sorry,” Steve said quietly, not sure what he could say. He had taken advantage of Tony, manipulated him, betrayed his trust. Again. “Sorry.”
If possible, Steve’s frown deepened. “You never ignore my calls. You should have waited for the team.”
It was a short walk to where Tony was being kept. Steve tried to remain calm as they walked, his blood was pounding so loudly in his ears he couldn’t hear anything else. Steve half expecting his cover to be blown at any moment. The agent walking in front kept glancing at him out the corner of his eyes, pupils darting with fear and curiosity. Steve needed to get rid of him quick before he got over his fear and realised that something wasn’t right.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you Tesoro.” She told him, voice catching. “I was just upset. You made the doctor think you weren’t sick and I’m worried for you.”
And yet. Some part of Steve –  some small, betrayed, angry part of him was still so mad at Tony. Furious enough that Steve still wanted to fight, to beat him all over again. Tony had betrayed what the Avengers stood for, he had betrayed Steve. Tony had talked a lot about struggling with SHRA, struggling to figure out what the right choice was but he had turned his back on Steve easily enough.
Steve didn’t say anything, settling down next to Tony in a lumpy office chair that groaned worrying under his weight. He resisted the urge to reach out for the A.I., to soothe away the obvious frustration lingering behind his words.
“You should just be able to walk into the Triskelion. Find Tony. There will be an extraction 2 blocks away, it will take you to Stark Resilient. He’ll be safe there.”
Tony blinked, cheeks colouring with embarrassment. “I guess what I’m trying to say is thank you for rescuing me.”
Tony sat down next to Steve, close enough that Steve could feel the heat of his skin. He was relaxed, skin crinkling at the corners of his eyes.  “I’ll try to remember that for the future.”
“Yeah, Yeah.” Tony nodded, unquestioning in his loyalty. He followed Steve to the door, picking his way on unsteady feet through the glass.
“The Avengers.” Tony said, and his lip quirking slightly, “the Defenders. Pretty much anyone who isn’t fighting Hydra’s forces directly.”
The muscles in Steve’s jaw twitched, spasming in anger. “Do not compare the two.” He snarled, his hand came out, finger jabbing into Tony’s chest. “I took the serum so I could serve my country. You got an entire city addicted to extremis so you could make a profit.”
The shock on Tony’s face disappeared like a mask falling away. He mouthed Steve’s name once again, his lips twitching, twisting: a smiling snake.
That’s what he was going to say if he got caught anyway.
“Are we friends?” Steve blurted, his cheeks heating at the sudden burst of emotion.
Steve reached out towards Tony’s face. Despite his translucency, there was something so human about him, Steve could see the minute movement of muscles beneath his skin, see the lines under his eyes. He couldn’t, refused to believe that the man before him wasn’t real. His hand came up to Tony’s face, ready to cup the man’s cheek. Steve’s fingers fell through Tony’s face, scattering a waterfall of blue pixels. Tony turned his face away from Steve’s gaze, something flexing in his pale blue jaw. Steve felt something in his chest break and took a step backwards.
“Well, you are sat by yourself in the kitchen at 3 am… but mostly it was a wild stab in the dark,” Steve said, there was a gentle mischievous glint in his eyes just waiting to come out.
Tony glanced up abruptly at the doctor’s words. He didn’t want to do it again, the thought of it made him feel hot and nauseated. His mother’s face was turned up towards the doctor, beautiful and glowing and Tony found for he couldn’t look at her, that he couldn’t bear to look at the bright excited light in her eyes. He
“You shot me!” Steve said before he could stop himself.  Sharon recoiled; she looked stricken, blood draining from her face. Steve’s hand had automatically gone to his side, stuttering when his fingers met smooth, unblemished skin. He kept patting his side, seeking something. There should be blood. His mind was fuzzy, he couldn’t’ remember why he thought there was blood.
Tony smiled, the silence stretching out between them.
Steve let himself fall, knowing there was nothing he could do to stop the move. He could almost feel the time bullet dragging him onwards, keelhauling him at the red-eyed Tony had mockingly called it. Steve slammed hard to ground. He choked on dusty, hot air, blinking as floating light danced in his vision.
Tony jerked his head.
“I know”
Steve pressed the heel of his hand into Tony’s sternum hard, flattening the man to the bed. Tony went silent, breathless under the pressure. “Actually, this is me. The real me. There’s no magic, no spell. This isn’t something you can fix. It’s real.”
“Tony.”
“Sir has worked extensively on your wound. He asked that you do not exert yourself in order to avoid undoing the repairs made by the nanobots.”
Steve faltered. The small white room didn’t look like a jail cell, and yet Steve had assumed it was a cage, just a pretty one. After all, Steve was a criminal, an attempted murderer. It didn’t make sense that he wasn’t being confined. Especially if he was in one of Tony’s houses.  Not daring to protest, Steve reached for the door. Despite F.R.I.D.A.Y.’s assurances, he was surprised when it opened.
“Steve?” Tony’s voice was quiet.
“I was fine! You said yourself it was just doombots.”
“Peter?” strong arms came and wrapped around, rocking him back and forth until Peter found himself sniffling weakly. “Sweetie what’s wrong, I can’t help unless you talk to me.”
“So, I’ll come back in 48 hours and hopefully we will have some answers.”
“Superior?”
“That is my shield.” Hydra Supreme said lightly, one pale eyebrow raised. He seemed unsurprised by Steve’s presence, more amused than anything. He had started to move around Steve, circling him. In his hands was a baton that fizzed with electricity as he twirled in, blue sparks flying around him.
Steve was shaking his head again but his expression was soft, fond. It was easy to convince him to take a break for a couple of hours.
Steve’s hand went to the wound at his side and Tony met his gaze, his eyes burning brilliant, blue hot.
Tony’s first memory was of lying, curled up in his mother’s arms as she sat in his nursery’s rocking chair.
Tony looked up at her. She had pushed her sunglasses to perch on the top of her head and was leaning across the table, cigarette dropped and forgotten by her feet. Her eyes were intent, bright with concern.
The pod sat gleaming and huge in the otherwise empty room. Steve sighed in relief and strode towards it, hands coming out to rest on the glass.
He produced a big white mug of coffee, placing it delicately on the table before Tony. Tony nodded, looking at the cup. Steve often brought him coffee and usually, it left a warm, fond glow in Tony’s chest. Today, he felt repulsed.
Tony’s bedroom was a huge sprawling mess. Half empty glasses and bottles were strewn carelessly around the room, littering sideboards and abandoned on the floor. Only one crimson curtain remained covering the windows. The other had been ripped off its railing and dragged like a blood stain across the floor, exposing a starburst of cracks and fractures in the uncovered window. Clothing lay scattered across the floor, dropped between wet footprints and obviously thrown off in a hurry.  Steve’s lip curled up in disgust as his foot met a pair of lacy red underwear.
“He was just like you,” Steve said eventually. He glanced at the atrium once more.  “Wait here.” Steve straightening his shoulders and took one deep breath before standing up.
Tony hesitated, stomach curdling but he took the cup and the pills obediently. It was easier this time to swallow the pills and Tony gulped them and the coffee down quickly, wanting it to be finished. His hands were shaking when he sank back into his seat and he wasn’t feeling so good. His stomach rolled, letting loose another gurgling noise but this time it was quieter, painful and Tony groaned quietly.
“Can’t you-”
Maria was a beautiful crier. He eyes got bigger, more lustrous with tears and the enticing fragility that had drawn Howard and a number of other men to her seemed to get more pronounced. The doctor, when he arrived spent the first 10 minutes cupping her tiny hands in his and reassuring her that he would fix things, that she didn’t need to worry anymore.
Maria deflated. She dropped to the floor with a sob, prostrating herself next to his bed as she might start praying to him. Tony flinched at the movement, nervousness churning into worry. He knew that this was his fault, that his mother was upset because of him, for him. He struggled an arm out of the tight covers and reached for her hand. She snatched up his fingers, kissing his hot little fingers with a miserable desperation.
“M-Maria,” Everette repeated her name breathlessly. Doctor Everette, was the youngest Doctor Tony had seen. He was barely out of medical school with a face marred by fading acne scars and big hands that hung from slender wrists, like a puppy with oversized paws. Howard had called him a flop and refused to meet with him, but Maria had liked him instantly, her eyes lighting up as he stammered his way through introducing himself.
Tony snorted, “Yeah well, this Tony Stark is a pathetic alcoholic with no money and no friends. I’m nobody’s role model.”
Steve blinked. Tony could see his curiosity and confusion forming a question, could see the words coming together on Steve’s face.
Tony looked at his mother blankly, wincing as he realised his attention had wondered. Maria sighed but didn’t scold him, repeating, “You’re not like your grandfather or father are you? You’re not going to eat and eat like an animal?”
“Did you find out what was wrong?”
“I didn’t need help, though,” Tony told him imperiously. “I got away by myself.”
The way Steve said his name had both Tony and Clint winced. Steve came to a stop before him, pulling off his cowl with one quick sharp movement.
Steve reeled Tony in towards him, gripping the man’s clothing tight. Tony hung limply from Steve’s fists, tilting his head up towards him, eyes watching him from under the heavy inky sweep of his lashes. Steve swallowed. “If you don’t stop extremis, I will stop you.”
Tony shook his head, “The Triskelion is a fortress, hundreds of guards and DNA scanners at every door.  We don’t have the manpower or the resource for a rescue mission.”
“You always did underestimate him,” Steve told himself and turned away, Tony pressed tightly into his side.
Instead, he flew, invisible hands dragging him up, wrenching him from the ground. The sudden movement jolted him from his sleep, his body automatically fighting as he struggled to understand what was happening. Around him, the world was blurring, dissolving,
“Why did you show me this?” Steve asked, “Shouldn’t you be trying to keep this a secret, stop me messing up the future?”
“I think you must be missing some memories if you think that Tony would blindly follow me.” Steve snorted.
“Shit!” Steve gripped Tony tight and rolled, diving off the road and into the ditch between the tarmac and the corn. A snap of air whipped past them, the bullet hitting the dirt and sending a cloud of dust around them.
“If you press the button on the side of the band it will stop,” Tony said, arms held tight into his sides.
It was a child, barely bigger than a toddler with a head of wild dark curls and big, tired looking eyes. He was curiously not wearing shoes and had to keep hopping from one foot to another, trying to avoid standing on the molten tarmac too long. Deciding the child wasn’t an immediate threat, Steve relaxed and sat up gingerly. Other than the road he was lying on, there were no visible landmarks. Sandwiching the highway were fields of swaying corn, stretching out as far as the eye could eye see.
Tony looked unimpressed. “I forgot how poorly you adjust to time travel.”
A blow caught him hard on the back of the knee, sending him down into a crouch with a cry. Steve raised his shield just in time to block the baton.
Ahead of him, a guard glanced back, his eyebrow raised at Steve’s language. Steve didn’t wait. He surged forward, breaking away from the SHIELD agents easily. In one stride he had twisted, shoulder coming down like a battering ram as he ran straight at the guard’s torso. The man went down fast, dropping out of the sniper’s range. And then the bullet hit Steve. It cut deep into his neck, just missing his carotid artery. Fire cut through him, spreading like glass fractures through his skin. He gurgled blood and stumbled, knocked off balance by the force of the blow. Around him, people were screaming, running. Panic hung in the air, almost tangible.
“Just ten minutes.”
“It itches,” Tony replied, his voice was scratchy. It was a struggle to get the words out, they were stuck to the roof of his mouth like toffee.
“Then why?”
“Where am I?” Steve asked, peering through the bright sunlight.
Ahead of Steve, face tilted towards the rising sun was Tony.
“I surprised you this morning and the other week, I pushed to go into Howard’s office. I’m sorry. It probably brought back some memories.”
Tony’s expression wavered, blue pixels rippling. “Neither actually.”
Steve faltered, realisation making his understanding of the man before him shift again. This Tony was like sand, impossible to get a grip on. Impossible to understand. “You want to make a serum for your Steve.”
“No.”  Steve breathed.
His Daddies room was down the hall from his. There was a bathroom between their rooms with a tub big enough to swim in, but it didn’t take him long to run past that and to his parents’ bedroom door.
Tony nodded weakly.
Steve made a noise of frustration. His anger spilled over and he grabbed Tony by the arm, reeling him in. Tony seemed amused rather scared, tipping himself forward into Steve. Steve’s fingers dug into Tony’s bare flesh hard enough that he could feel the heat of the bruises already blossoming beneath his fingers. “Stop messing around. What are you playing at!”
“Not forever, just for a while.”
“Nothing. I just. I guess, I just wanted to say goodbye.”
“No, but he would follow Steve.”
Steve exhaled unevenly, and closed his eyes for a long moment, the anger draining out of him. When he looked at Tony, his eyes roamed across Tony’s face as if searching for something. “I’m worried about you, Tony. I know you’re not sleeping lately; you barely eat anything. And half the time you’re completely zoned out. It’s like you’re not with us anymore. If you tell me what is going on, I can help.”
“No…”
“You ignored protocol and went into battle alone.” Steve wasn’t shouting but it didn’t in any way make him sound less angry, less fearsome.
“You should have gone for a ‘kiss the chef’ apron,” Tony told him and they grinned at each other, a delicate rose pink blush seeping across the tops of Steve’s cheekbones.
Steve’s eyelids were stuck together, tacky with sleep. He peeled them open slowly, hissing at the prickling sensation. In the background F.R.I.D.A.Y. continue to run through statistics, her lilting voice soothing as Steve wavered on the edge of consciousness
“Dammit,” Steve said softly, his hands were tied behind his back. The cuffs, another gift from Tony, wouldn’t break even with his super strength.
Alongside the diet changes came the epi-pens. They were, his mother explained, for Tony to use when he ate something he shouldn’t have. She coached him through their use –  “Blue to the sky, Orange to the thigh” – and watched with dark, loving eyes as Tony brought the pen down hard into his leg, wincing at the stab of the needle and the rush of adrenaline that ran through him. Almost immediately he felt dizzy, nauseated. He had a rabbit heart, straining against his ribcage. Maria soothed him as he lay panting, stroking his sweat-soaked curls. She had pressed the second epi-pen into his slick palm and told him to keep practicing.
Papa’s arm swung up and then sideways. His hand came back down, twisted so the back of it slammed into Daddy’s face. Daddy cried involuntarily as the hit landed, the noise choked off as his jaw moved. His face was forced to one side and his whole body twisted to follow. He stumbled and fell to the ground, his legs splayed out around Papa’s bare feet. Peter's stomach twisted horribly at the sight. He Daddy didn’t look right, he looked small and frightened and when he turned his face upwards there a big red mark on his jaw and moisture pooling in his eyes.
“Don’t poke it too hard. It’s a high-tech band-aid, not a miracle cure.” Tony grumbled as he came back into the room.
“OK, OK. I’m sorry.” Steve made to take a step forward, stopping when Tony hissed involuntarily.  “I’m just going to stay here. I won’t touch you, just tell me how you are feeling. You don’t look right.”
Steve made a quiet noise of surprise, his fingers tightening longingly around the photograph. t was a picture of him and Tony back when they had first started the Avengers. He and Tony were pressed in close, eyes crinkling in laughter. Tony’s face was directed outwards, towards the viewer but Steve’s attention was on his companion, his expression soft as he watched Tony laugh.
Steve looked up; his mouth still curled in disgust. The AI had taken a step back, his expression pained, wary. Steve went still, taken aback by how much this obviously hurt Tony. The more time he spent with the A.I. the more it became apparent that he wasn’t just a machine, just code twisted into a replica of Tony Stark. He thought, felt as Tony did. The A.I. had mentioned that Steve and Tony were together and Steve had never stopped to consider what that meant for the A.I., not until he saw Tony’s stricken, heartbroken expression played out in blue pixels.
Steve looked up. Tony’s head stretched out over his head, blue eyes peering down at him worriedly. He smiled reassuring up at the child. “I used to be. I’m not sure anymore.”
Tony stepped closer, footsteps loud against the polished floor. The liquid metal around him was blurring, disintegrating. “You tried to kill me, remember. The violence, the possessiveness. It’s not normal.  That is what we do to each other.”
Tony reached for Steve as Steve stood upright. A moment to slow.
Peter’s mouth twisted as he pondered the question. It was a serious one. He knew it has been an accident, and from the way Daddy was staring wide eyed over Papa’s shoulder Peter knew that he should say yes. But Amy had said no should hit anyone, no matter what. Did it not matter because Papa hadn’t meant to? But Daddy had still been hurt.
“Does it hurt?”
“It really would be best not to disturb him.” F.R.I.D.A.Y. continued, her voice lost as Steve closed the bedroom.
“Chaotic scenes continue throughout San Francisco following the introduction of a daily fee for Stark’s extremis 2.0.”
Laughter filtered uneasily through the group. One of silent hired muscle flicked a brief look towards to the scrawny passenger. The look only lasted a second, such a small movement that most would have missed it.
The morning Steve had been led up those courthouse steps, he had let go of Tony. Given him up, like one would release a bird to the wild.
“They are fighting in the streets; people are killing themselves.” Steve snapped, voice climbing, “they don’t look normal, they look –”
Tony’s fingers traced his face, a feather touch against his lips. “There are other ways of shutting me up, other than with your fists you know.”
He started walking again, straight out into the road. Steve lurched after him, grabbing Tony’s arm and dragging him backwards as a car horn screeched angrily past them. He pushed Tony back, almost throwing him against the wall.
“My favourite superhero doesn’t have any powers,” Steve told him. “He’s just really smart.”
Tony pulled away, eyes opening slowly. He looked at Steve smiling and then winced, turning away from Steve’s gaze. Steve put his hands in his lap abruptly, embarrassment lingered between them as the realised what they had been doing.
“I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but you’re not the most open about your feelings.” Tony replied, and then winced, “Except when you’re the Supreme Leader of Hydra apparently. Then you don’t shut the fuck up.”
Tony smiled, stepping into Steve’s personal space once again. He leaned up, his lips pressing a fleeting, feather-light kiss to Steve’s mouth. Then he was gone, walking back towards the door with purpose. “I’ll be right back.”
He was polite but Tony could hear the want in his voice, the desperation to find something familiar. Tony remembered the emptiness, the nothing he had found in this room after Howard’s death and felt a stab of concern. This could end up being an exercise in cruelty and Tony and Steve had spent too long being unknowingly cruel to each other. Tony didn’t want to hurt him again.
“I think you – oh hey!” Tony said excitedly, sitting up straight. “I see another road. It’s busy” He pointed to the left, through the cornfield. “We’re nearly there!”
Steve obeyed, tugging off his shirt gingery. Tony turned away from him politely making Steve wonder to what his actions were driven by coding and what was a distinct choice made the A.I. Steve had often wondered the same about J.A.R.V.I.S. and F.R.I.D.A.Y. – both A.I.s had acted so human that the rare glimpses of their true, machine nature had always felt like a troubling surprise. Tony’s AI was another level beyond them, he was so, so human. Troubled, unhappy in a way that neither J.A.R.V.I.S. and F.R.I.D.A.Y. had ever been. Steve scoffed, smiling to himself. Tony would call him a pessimistic if he tried to explain that humanity was evident in their ability to be dissatisfied. Distracted by his thoughts, Steve was careless as he undressed. A sound of discomfort escaped him as he jarred the wound at his side.
“I did.” Steve agreed placidly.
They came to a stop just before the atrium. The single exit out of the triskelion required them to leave through the atrium: a huge, open space crawling with Hydra agents.
Sharon stared down at him; her face was perfectly blank, doll like. Clutched in her hand was a strange-looking, still smoking gun.
“You seem a bit rusty,” the Hydra Supreme taunted.
“Oh sorry, I can move-“ Steve said.
“Yeah, like you’ve ever done anything wrong in your life,” Tony replied dismissively.
“How convenient.” Steve snapped, and gingerly pressed his fingers against the wound again. It remained normal this time, feeling firm and clotted under his fingers. But he could tell he wasn’t healed. It felt hot and painful like a fresh wound and that it itself was unusual. If F.R.I.D.A.Y.  was correct and he had been here for at least eight hours, he should have healed almost as good as new. The bullet wound on neck had faded to a faint, tender red scar that would be gone completely by nightfall.
“You either join me willing or I make you.” The Hydra Supreme growled, ignoring the choking, soundless cries escaping Tony. “I’d say I don’t want to hurt you, but we both know that some part of me always wants to hurt you.”
“Sorry, sir I did not mean to… interrupt you.” The way the agent said ‘interrupt’ sent the hairs on Steve’s arm upright. He wondered sickly what exactly the agent thought he was interrupting.
Steve winced at the exchange, watching pitifully as the beggar put his head in hands, every line of his body was line with misery, hopelessness. With a sigh, the man rolled upright, unsteady on his feet as he turned in Steve’s alley. Steve tensed as the man staggered into view.
“I know. I’d still like to see.”
The nurse told Maria that she couldn’t enter the operating theatre and would have to wait outside until it was over. Unlike most of the other staff in the hospitals, the nurse had seemed unmoved by his mother; indifferent to her wringing hands and tear sparkling eyes. Maria had watched as Tony was wheeled into the theatre, a slender figure in a sunflower yellow dress, silent but almost vibrating. Tony had almost forgotten his worries about what was about to happen to him, his attention focused on his mother’s bright, feverish eyes. She had smiled at the nurse easily, her expression pleasantly vague and Tony knew she was furious.
“Only one has come up.” Maria murmured, her nail taping one particular sore patch of skin. She sounded disappointed. Tony flinched at the contact, twisting his head to see the hard, raised hive spreading across his back.
Tony shook his head, grabbing Steve’s wrist before the man could pull away. “No, it’s fine. It’s nice.”
The Hydra agents scattered, boots stomping across the marble floor. Steve remained still, trying not to let his desperation, his nervousness show as the men streamed past him. Tony, who had been watching this from his safe nook appeared at the edge of the atrium, moving slowly out the corner of Steve's eye.
Steve’s tried to remember how the Hydra Supreme version of himself had spoken. He tried to emulate the other’s cruel, sneering drawl. “Good. Now take me there.”
Tony slapped him away, his hand striking Steve’s with enough force to make his own skin sting. He threw himself backward, lips curling into a snarl. His legs moved without his consent until was pressed against the fridge, the bones in his back stinging from how hard he slammed into the chrome door. The tremors in his hands had grown into full blow shakes and he was aware he was all but vibrating, coming apart with his teeth bared. A feral dog cornered.
Tony scoffed, his eyes rolling. “Firstly, you assume Hydra Steve would be honest. And secondly, things are different now. Before Tony went into the coma, he and Steve were together.”
The Hydra Supreme rolled with the hit, landing an arm’s length away from Steve with a laugh. “You know, I expected that A.I. to send someone here. But I didn’t expect him to send another me. Where did he find you?”
“He didn’t even touch his coffee.”
Tony smirked. “Wanda. She changed a lot of us.”
Steve laughed, “Well this is going to make things much, much harder.” He reached down, picking Tony up by his collar like he was a disobedient dog. He carried the man back to the bed, dumping him roughly onto the mattress. “For you, anyway.”
“Stop being Hydra!”  Tony retorted, hands reaching behind him.
His Papa stumbled away from them. “Peter, I wasn’t going to…. We just having an argument.”
“Come here,” Steve told the boy, holding out his arms. Tony froze, looking at him wide-eyed and confused. “Your feet are hurt; I can carry you.”
Maria could have been a model. Would have been, if she’d had been taller. But there hadn’t been enough food in her house growing up and what little there was went first to her father and then to her brothers.
Tony pulled his t-shirt on gingerly, his back stung at the touch of the material but he didn’t care, he felt exposed, vulnerable and his shirt offered protection if only a little.
It had been Jarvis who had prepared him for those visits, who had taken him away afterwards to soothe him and provide reassurance. His mother had grown jealous and cold at the encroaching interference of Howard and would ignore the summons, taking Tony off to ice cream parlours and doctors’ appointments instead. She would ignore Tony afterward, looking at Tony as if he had betrayed her somehow. The first time his parents had ever argued it had been about those visits. All their subsequent arguments had been him too: about who got to have him.
The crowd image changed, replaced by a video of Tony in his sleek silvery suit hovering over the crowd. He was smirking, white teeth sharp and predatory in his face. The crowd pressed towards him, they weren’t fighting like the last video, they were happy, adoring. And yet Steve could see the edges of desperation straining their eyes, the fear in the shakiness of their hands. They worshipped Tony but were scared of him.
“I know you don’t want to talk about it, but I can tell you’re going through something.” Steve continued.
Steve turned around slowly, cold with weary anger. “Tony, what have you done?”
“Stark?” Bucky scoffed, “Why do you care about him. He’s the reason you died, Steve.”
Tony swallowed, his breathing stuttering with feeling. He clenched his jaw shut, staring up at the Hydra Supreme silently. His eyes were huge, reflective with unshed tears.
Steve reached out slowly, half expecting his fingers to slide through the shield like it was an illusion. He touched the cool viburnum, feeling it vibrate through his fingers. He smiled at it, heart lifting. It felt like home. He looked back over at Tony; the A.I. had his hands to face, almost vibrating with expectation. “How?” Steve asked.
“Tony-,” Steve ducked, narrowly missing a glass thrown at his head. Glass shards rained down around him. Steve cursed at the noise, quickly stepping into the room and closing the door behind him.
“Of course, there are blood tests and we can do a food elimination diet that –“
“What’s your point? Do you know how long I’ve been awake? I must be due a meal soon.”
Steve sat up carefully, flexing and stretching gently. He had been laid out across Tony’s bed, left alone to sleep. The wound in his side was radiating heat, hardened by the nanobots but the pain was reduced, the injury smaller. Steve poked at his side gingerly.
Tony remembered waking up in his bed, his mother leaning over him, her eyes still full of tears. The covers had been drawn around him tight, heavy winter duvets overlaid with blankets despite the hot summer day and he squirmed uncomfortably.
Like a hare released from a trap, the boy ran. Scrabbling through the cornfield. In seconds he had disappeared into the cornfield. Gone as if he had never been there. Steve sighed with relief and stood up just as the car skidded to a halt before him.
“Tomato, Tomatho.” Tony huffed, unflinching as Steve stepped forward into his space.
Steve grimaced in agreement. They glanced at each and started to laugh, agreeing to separate in order to peel the wet clothes off, dropping them in sticky wet piles to the floor.
Tony slowly shook his head, waiting for her to inject. “I feel sick.”
“I don’t know.” Steve groaned and tilted his head to face his attacker. A small, dark-haired figure was stood off to one side, holding a branch between them cautiously. At Steve’s recovery, he jumped back, stick raised aloft warningly.
“So, what – going off by yourself was just some childish tantrum because I told you something you didn’t like?” Steve pressed; his eyes were so blue, electric fire as he stared down at Tony.
Steve looked down at his hands, seeing the other Steve’s withered, liver marked fingers overlaid over his own. He was wearing the other’s man suit; a Commander’s suit.
Tony never saw the doctor with the white moustache again. Maria told Tony that he was too old. That he was senile like Tony’s grandfather and unable to remember who he was talking to. That was why he hadn’t recognised that Tony was sick.
Tony grinned. It was as if his smile triggered something. The remaining floating metal snapping onto to Tony, hardening into an Iron Man suit.  The strange crown settled across his forehead, reflecting Steve’s furrowed brows back him. Tony grabbed Steve’s wrist, keeping Steve close.  Tony’s eyes were half-lidded, almost flirtatious, his lips twitched. “Let’s see you stop me now.”
Tony shrugged, “Mess it up. It sucks anyway.” He threw himself onto a huge leather couch, sprawling out across it like a cat. “I’m telling you because you asked me if we were friends.”
Steve hissed. He tried to flex, to fight against Tony’s hold but he was unmoveable, a mountain against his strength. Tony grinned, amused and then like a shadow he was gone, leaving Steve abandoned, a broken toy on the floor.
“Please call me Maria.” Tony’s mother said softly, reaching one white-gloved hand to rest gently on the doctor’s crooked arm.
I'd love to hear your thoughts. Hopefully, I have made Maria a strange, complicated figure of contradictions.  Poor Tony.
“I could help you stop him, fix him,” Steve said instead.
Tony pulled a face. He was leaning casually against the wall, one long leg crossed over the other. “You’ll have to be more specific, I’m afraid.”
Peter slammed his hands against his legs, frustration making his words hard to get out. “You were. Just like last time! I saw you hit him. You were going to hit Daddy again and make him cry and….” Words suddenly failed him and sobs took their place.
“Sorry, Mama.” He whispered, his voice raspy. His eyes were burning as if he wanted to cry but he found that the tears wouldn’t come. “I won’t do it again.”
“Not me. For you. Captain America means a lot to people, they want to help fix things.” Tony had turned to face him, moving so close that if he had been human Steve would have felt the heat off his skin.
Steve smiled back, his hand coming to rest on Tony’s shoulder. Steve’s hand was big enough to make Tony feel small, fragile in his grasp and Tony shivered at the contact, nerve ending lighting up.
Tony wiggled sleepily, nose pressing into the dip of Steve’s neck. “Will you be here when I wake up?” he asked, voice husky with sleep.
Everyone else was easy. The little Tony-Stick-Figure was hot red and highlighted with golden glitter. Little Steve-Stick-Figure was covered in white sticky stars, complete with matching shield, and the little stick figure that was meant to represent him was purple, because that was his favourite colour. Jarvis however…
Tony found himself eating alone, away from his family and Jarvis, picking at beige bowels of oatmeal and chicken that had gone cold waiting for his mother’s approval. There never seemed to be enough to fill him. Tony would take tiny bites in an effort to make it last longer. But it was always gone too quick and he would suck at his cutlery long after the meal was over, trying to make the taste last longer.
“There’s an extraction point two blocks away; we just have to make it out the front door.” Steve glanced over at Tony. The dark-haired man was panting hard, his face pale, apart from the two pink dots high on his cheeks. He hasn’t complained as they made their way through the Triskelion but it was obvious to Steve that he was nearing the end of his capacity, shivering and sweating with exhaustion.
Tony could feel his own eyes burning again with the threat of tears, his lower lip wobbling. Her panic was infectious, was he sick? “I’m sorry, mama. I didn’t know…”
Tony smiled, something sharp and dangerous in the curl of his mouth, “There’s time yet.”
Doctor Everette disappeared as quietly and unremarkably as all the doctors before him but his legacy was long-lasting. The test had revealed a multitude of allergies: eggs, lactose, fish, red meat, almonds. His mother was ecstatic at the news, vindicated. Tony spent hours with his mother at various dietarians and nutritionist. He would sit forgotten and bored in the corner of the examination rooms, swinging his legs while his mother chatted amicably to the health professionals, laughing together as she took notes and made plans. Like Doctor Everette they were all captivated by her beauty, by her dedication to Tony and his complex health problems and praised her selflessness, making sure Tony knew how wonderful his mother was. She glowed under their praise, a sunflower feeding off their worship.
Steve didn’t recognise the Iron Man suit Tony was wearing. It was fitted close, silvery and somehow slightly obscene. Tony had removed his face-plate but metal lingered across his brow, almost crown-like. Over the top of suit, Tony was wearing his old bright red jacket. Steve hadn’t seen the jacket in years, not since those early days back in the manor. A memory of Tony, eyes twinkling mischievously over the edge of the jacket’s turned up collar came to Steve suddenly and he breathed deeply, chest hurting at the memory. Tony hadn’t smiled like that in a long time. He hadn’t smiled at all recently.
Tony laughed, his eyes were already half lidding, sleep threatening. “Please don’t apologise after that. Although I am really regretting the decision to not take off my jeans first.”
Tony wavered, “I don’t have any powers.”
“Looks like you need a few more tweaks before you’re roadworthy,” Tony told him, fingers skimming Steve’s sides, measuring the wound lightly. The strange monster under Steve’s skin flexed, rippled at Tony’s touch like a dog wagging its tail.
“There was nothing immediately identifiable. However, we will go over the footage in more detail and be in touch with you with the full results in the next couple of days Mrs. Stark.”
“Alright, what have we got this time.”
Papa was yelling and thrashing about in bed.
Steve couldn’t breathe. It was if his asthma had returned, stealing the life for him. He could almost feel the puzzle pieces falling into place. The oddities of his and Tony’s relationship suddenly coming into focus. Steve had taken the needling, the joking from the other Avengers for years, brushing off the ‘mom and dad’ nicknames. He had told himself it was a future thing, that the 21st century just wasn’t used to affect between male friends. But for the first time, he truly understood. It was as if the scales had fallen from his eyes.
“I broke the ropes and crawled out the window. The bad men didn’t think I would do that because it was so high and they had taken my shoes but I did. And I cut the fuel lines in their truck so they couldn’t come after me.”
Peter darted towards the kitchen and towards the sound of the shouting. His Papa’s voice echoed through the corridor as he got closer.
They remained like that, kissing and grinding against each other, clothes still on like teenagers. Steve’s suit was too tight, almost painful on his erection but his mind was too dazed with arousal to do anything about it. He panted, breathlessly into Tony’s mouth, moving faster. Tony’s nails were scratching long desperate lines down his back, urging him on. Steve captured Tony’s wrists, pinning his arms above his head easily. Tony whined, twisting and fighting against him, his eyes dark, needy.
Tony nodded and when the coffee came, he did as he was told, forcing himself to breathe through his nose to stop himself gagging at the bitter taste. The pills were big, hard to swallow and they got caught in the back of his throat, leaving his mouth powdery and sore. He had to try a couple of time before he managed to get the correct timing of taking the pills in his mouth and gulping down coffee to make everything slid down his throat.
Tony had been born a sickly child and stayed that way. Undersized and thin for his age. At three he could still fit as easily as a toy doll into his mother’s lap. She was humming a tune, each note rising and falling with the movement of the chair. Every now and again she would break out into song, a whisper of Italian that stroked across the top of Tony’s head. “Dormi, Dormi bel Bambin.”
“Tesoro, come on.” Maria interrupted him, holding out a hand. She was wearing gloves, neat little white things that felt slippery in Tony’s hand. He let her lead him on, peering around distractedly at the waiting room. They had only recently started venturing beyond the manor to find a paediatrician who “knew what they were talking about” and Tony was still intrigued by the clean little white offices he found himself in and the brightly coloured picture books and toys that filled the waiting rooms. He didn’t have anything like that at home, his father said he was too smart for rubbish like that but Tony’s fingers betrayed him, itching to touch.
“Stop!” He cried, his voice was loud enough to make them pause and they spun around to see him.
“I have to leave,” Steve said. It was the truth at least. He didn’t quite know when but he could feel that he had another time jump coming. There was static across his skin, prickling across his tongue. He would be gone before morning.
Sharon was fighting her way through the crowd, battling a surging tide as she called his name. Steve tried to shout out to her, to tell her about the sniper but his throat was a mess; skin desperately knitting back to together but not fast enough. Sharon threw herself down next to him, arms shielding him from the stampede of people around them. Steve looked up, wanting to smile, to reassure her that he was going to be fine. He could already feel himself mending. He would be fine.
“You’re wearing my suit,” Steve stated flatly.
Tony pushed his mug away; the movement made the coffee slosh over the rim of the cup and flood across the counter. Tony cursed, shooting to his feet but then hesitated as he stared at the spilled coffee; suddenly unsure what do to. He could feel Steve watching him silently, eyebrows curling up in worry. Tony knew that he was acting oddly and a strange thrum of nervous energy started to crawl through his limbs, lightning running across his muscles.
