Stevens nodded, smiling back.
It was time. The bittersweet feeling rolled in his stomach, and he nodded helplessly, biting his lips while his eyes burned. There was a list of things he wanted, but he would settle for just one for now. He gave his teammates a shaky, closed-lipped remnant of a smile. “Let’s go home.”
You know what’s hard, asshole? Coding. Coding’s hard. Writing in code is harder.
“No,” Tony agreed. “I was stopped by a nutjob with a police box in the middle of Killian Court.”
🤮 Where did you get the recipe from?
The door slammed in his face.
Wear a fireproof suit because I’m hot as hell not because MY BANANA BREAD IS ON FIRE OH GOD!
- Sincerely, A Rocket Scientist
Steve barked out a laugh and glanced sideways again. “I had a really, really terrible date the night before we left.”

And now he was dead because of Steve.
A squirrel stole the last donut! 😡
“How about that…football game?”
Should I be wearing a fireproof suit to our date?
Oh, how Tony wished this was real. “Will you be there?” he whispered.
Damn, him and his mouth. But really, in for a penny, in for a pound – might as well put his entire foot in his mouth. “You’re still parked out here, even when I told you to move it because it is a college campus, which means that your ship, or whatever this thing is, has issues. And I’m good at fixing issues…mechanical ones that is.”
Tony laughed bitterly, but didn’t bother to reply. He didn’t believe Yinsen - he didn’t think he deserved a second chance. He had no way of escaping. He went from one hell right back to another, and he didn’t know which hell was worse. Each one was terrible in their own way. But there was also a frisson of hope within himself at the prospect of knowing that there was a mate who was waiting for him. He let the fire of hope burn within him before he tamped it firmly down. No, he couldn’t.
His face was scrunched up as he sipped his coffee, and he was smacking his lips together as if he tasted something funny, looking down at his mug with confusion. “Does your coffee tastes weird to you?” he asked.
Tiny Steve was more expressive than his larger counterpart, and his face scrunched up in thought before it smoothed out and he nodded. He trilled, and Steve smiled. He placed his hand into his cage, palm up, and Tiny Steve leapt directly onto his palm before he folded his legs under him, settling comfortably there in the center of his hand.
Tony brought the single feather to the light. “Your feather reminds me of a raven’s. And besides death, do you know what a raven also symbolize? Creation and knowledge.”
Tony nodded. “I suppose you’ve heard of me.”
He regretted it, plucking it.
For the sake of their friendship, Steve swallowed down his selfishness (because he wasn’t selfish at all) and pushed away. He felt untethered, but he had to be patient and take one step at a time - he had nothing left to lose, and all he had was up. “I’ll be okay, promise.”
Steve’s eyes burned. With this revelation and a third perspective, Steve began to realize that

“I just want to keep you, always.” Steve looked up at Tony again, eyes twinkling. Tony was utterly helpless under his gaze, mouth open in a daze as Steve took him. Tony’s cock was encompassed by the heat of Steve’s mouth, hot and heated and too much and not enough. He cried out, closing his eyes in pleasure, and it was hard not to thrust forward into that heavenly heat.
It was a weird feeling, feeling emotions that weren’t his...but it also felt right, as if this tiny creature filled an empty section of his soul that he didn’t know he was missing before. Tiny Steve was grinning at him, and Steve couldn’t help but send warmth back towards him.
“No, sir.”

Stevens’s eyes widened. “Your workshop?” he breathed.
I promise Tony will still be there.
The Doctor totally took offense. “See if I show you the inside then,” he replied petulantly, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Oh my God, you did it!” Tony praised. “Can you open your eyes for me baby?”
Steve couldn’t breathe. There was this amazing man in front of him who shredded everything he believed in himself for nearly a century and...loved him for what he was.
It was too easy to fool into the Ten Rings demand once Tony did have a plan in mind, but it took a waterboarding, whipping, and a broken leg for Tony to get to that point. He healed, much too slowly for his liking, and much slower than his normal werewolf speed. But it must have been all the wolfsbane that have been coursing in his body. Being crippled by the fact that he could no longer shift because of the terrible mess he had in his chest forced him to think up solutions in ways he hadn’t thought up before.
By now, Steve and Tony were merely inches from each other, glaring with angry eyes. Steve opened his mouth but nothing came out as he tried to come up with a response.
“Yeah,” Tony replied, grinning. He had Stevens’s attention. “Robots and metal and all, lots of fun.”
He loved it so much.
Tony rarely blushed anymore; he was usually the suave and confident one, but with Steve there and complimenting him at every turn, he couldn’t help but be flat-footed. “Fuck, and you’re so beautiful too,” Tony said, giving him his best even as his brain was leaking out of his ears.
It was a victory, but Steve felt like Fury won anyway.
“Hey, no, Deb’s really sweet and nice. She wouldn’t hurt anyone.” Tony took a step backwards and turned around, bringing Stevensn’s hand with him. Thankfully this time Stevens followed. “Let me take you home. You look like you could use some rest.”

“Thanks,” Tony said in relief. Stevens was a guest; he shouldn’t have had to do his work for him. Regardless, he was glad that he didn’t have to do the task. “Sorry you had to see this dumbo while he was on critical battery levels because he couldn’t get around to his charging station
Tony pressed back. “Yes, ah, it feels so good.”
“Okay.” They couldn’t really spare people, but Steve agreed with her. They could use another hand to help, and Clint was still family. “It’s going to be just you though; we can’t spare more resources.”
Steve shushed him. “Save your energy. We’re coming as fast we can to find you. You’re smart, you must have left a signal on, right? We’ll find you, and we’re bringing you home, Tony.”
But Tony was already gone.
And Tony staggered into Steve’s waiting arms – the barrier had broken; Steve looked on in shock and horror as they collapsed to the ground.
“Don’t stop,” Steve begged, and his wings fluttered around Tony’s fingers.
Steve laughed, leaning forward to press another kiss against Tony’s lips. Steve tasted like the sweetest red wine that he drank during the party, but underneath was all him, all apples and cinnamon, like the sweetest apple pie. He liked the taste of the man and he wondered why he waited so long before to kiss him in this way.
Zola was right: for every head that Steve cut off, two more took its place.
I think he knows exactly what he’s missing.
All of his students had already left, as did all of the other graduate students and professors, rushing home as quickly as possible to avoid the worst of the winter storm. Only Tony was left to lock up the building doors, and he did it with clumsy grace, cursing loudly as he pushed the door open and received a face full of freezing wind. Over the screaming wind, he couldn’t even hear himself, and wasn’t that his worst luck? Tony braced his entire body against the door, taking three tries to put the key into the keyhole and locking up for the night.
But as soon as his grin appeared, it disappeared as the supersoldier serum kicked in and shedded the bleach from the feathers, as if his body knew that he was ill. The feathers molted and fell to the floor of his bathtub; in their place were a new set of blackened wings.
Tony slumped, feeling defeated. There was no way Tony would be able to overcome this obstacle.
Tony hoped that he wouldn’t have to bond with his captors. That would be a punishment even worse than captivity. He shuddered, and the low aching in his chest turned into sharp stabs of pain. He gasped, struggling to get his breath back. Even this injury was nearly too much for a werewolf to take. In the ensuing silence, the fire crackled, and then there was a
“Blwbbe?”
Down below deck felt a lot more personal than up in the cockpit – remnants of the Guardians belongings were strewn all around the room. In this quietness, it felt only like a pause, like a sentry watch. It didn’t feel like a final silence for the dead. Tony stood still at the base by the ladder, gazing slowly from one side of the room to the other, taking stock of everything within his sight. Unfamiliar technology was intermingled with more familiar earthly ones, and Tony slowly, cautiously walked forward, brushing his fingers lightly over a shelf. “Awesome Mix Vol. 1” the cassette player said when he reached the Walkman, just one Earthly thing familiar in this unfamiliar room. It felt wrong to touch something that didn’t belong to him. It was unlike him to care about it, but knowing that he was touching dead mens’ stuff felt taboo. Still, he was drawn to the obsolete piece of tech – it was one connection to home. So Tony pressed the “play” button, letting the prongs roll and the stereo crackle to life.
When the first robot heard the news, him stopped in his tracks, leaving the second robot to crash ungainly into him. The second bot beeped confusedly, tilting its claws in curiosity.

Tony lifted his hands in the universal sign of surrender. “I’ll be heading over to see mini-me,” Tony said instead. “You coming?”
He had to. There was no choice. Here he was, a man out of his time, forever outliving others. Back then, Steve thought it was a blessing, and he’d do good with the gift he was given. Now, he cursed upon its very existence because he never stopped fighting battles.
“We’ve got to move on.” Nat was sympathetic. “We need to move forward because we can’t change the past. Not in this way at least. We don’t have the resources to change the past right now, so we need to move on.”
His back twitched in sympathy.
He turned to look over his shoulder again.
. He had too much on his plate to even work out the problems between them. “For once, can’t you just leave me alone? What is it this time? A shield to the chest? Strangling me with your bare hands? Poisoning me with your sad puppy eyes? What do I have to do
Tony looked at him. “They can try.” He turned back to the Alpha. It was a suicide mission, refusing, but he didn’t care. “You want the Jericho? You can’t have it!”
And he was horrified by his actions – even more so when Tony took a step back in surprise, a belated second after his fist had been already stopped in midair. They looked down at Steve’s fist, pressed against the invisible wall between them. Guilt swallowed Steve whole.
His face exploded into pain. Blood dripped down his face, bleeding from the claw marks that went from his temple to his cheeks. The Alpha’s fingers narrowly missed his eye - any closer, he would have definitely been blinded. Werewolf or not, it wasn’t easy to heal from that injury. Tony gasped in surprise, stumbling back and tripping over his feet.
The Doctor rolled his eyes. “Why don’t you tell me your name first, and then I’ll decide whether that is true,” he said. “This was the second time I’ve caught you trying to break into my TARDIS.”
And just like that, the spell was broken. Stevens drew back, eyes hooded.
Tiny Steve trilled and looked up.
“But, can’t you stay?” Tony stood up as well and faced Stevens, pleading, hoping that he would break and concede.
He didn’t mean to do that.
“Understandably. You nearly died.” Yinsen mused, “I don’t know the real reason you were kidnapped, but you are a very high value target, and an omega werewolf too.”
When Tony looked over, Stevens had a giant grin on his face. “I know someone else who loves blowing stuff as well.”

“He said it was Gallifreyan technology, created by his people.”
When there was no expectant reply, Stevens turned to see Tony beginning to frown.
He felt out of place, out of time, and he, after all this time, still really hated his wings.

The man rocked back on his heels of his high-top sneakers, looking nonchalant at the fact that he just said that something was broken. Tony considered him before he glanced back at the TARDIS.
“Well,” she pushed her hair behind her ear - a move Bucky had long ago tracked as ‘Pepper Means Business’ - and padded over to the couches in the corner of her spacious office. “How well do you know Carol Danvers?”
that he didn’t create Butterfingers at all. He just didn’t know where the bot came from. It literally just appeared one day while Tony was either bleary with sleep, or drunk, or both, but he was sure that he was working on stuff for SI, not...something so useless and permanently angry, destroying everything he touched. But no matter what reason that engendered Butterfingers, the bot was here to stay for good.
“Tony…” Steve whispered.
“Harbinger of death, harbinger of death,” the kids chanted. “Black like a raven, harbinger of death.”

Steve glared, and Clint laughed before he said, “First place Thor, I’m gonna get first place!”
Only the new kid, Bucky, stayed. “Mean punch you packed there,” he remarked, staring down at Steve’s split knuckles.
Tony reared back in mock-affront. “Me? Break him? Aren’t you supposed to threaten him instead?”
The man blinked. “That’s a new one,” he mused. “But if we’re going the technicalities of this, I am a doctor of everything.”
But now it left escape. Between Yinsen and Tony, only Yinsen had the ability to shift. Tony was a fucking liability, unable to do the exact thing he was born to do. He couldn’t be fast; he was essentially human. He needed something like an armor to protect all his fragility.

“How did that go?”
At one point, Tony promised that he wouldn’t fall.
Broken wire, scraps, and equipment spread out across the table, waiting to be used. Tony needed to fix the ship up as best he can up first so that it could take them home. A scan of the engine showed that there was a crack that leaked fuel out into the negative zone. He sealed the crack, but he gnawed his lips in worry all the same. Who knew how long fuel had been leaking out of the engine? It didn’t bode well, especially with the fact that they had little fuel left to begin with.
“Sixty-two hours.” Nebula followed him as he grabbed water and food from the kitchen. “We’re six hours away from the outpost, and when we get there, it won’t take too long to refuel and get more food. Then we can head towards Earth.” As Tony munched on dry biscuits, Nebula asked, “What are you making?”
So here they were, a Wednesday night, Tony had retreated to his bedroom and so had Steve. The walls were thin, however, so they could hear each other as if they were in the same bedroom and that was unnerving. Tony had forgotten to take his anxiety medication this morning and felt a panic attack creeping upon him. He tried to inhale through his nose and exhale through his mouth for half an hour and in the end, he did felt better and after another half an hour he nodded off.
'Tony, let’s do a few of those breathing exercises. In and out like I do. You're safe here and you are allowed to enjoy yourself. Nothing is going to happen, just focus on me and your breathing. Come on, in and out.'
Tony nodded and closed his eyes for a minute, letting his head lean against Steve's shoulder. He slipped his hands around Steve's tiny waist and settled his hands on Steve's lower back.
'Well good morning to you too Pep.' He stood up and hobbled into the bathroom. He honestly didn't look that great, his hair was a curly mess, bruises all over like he assumed and there were streaks of dirt all over him. He shrugged off his clothes and stepped under the warm water of the shower, it soothed the deep ache in his bones.
Rhodey had explained that Steve was in surgery and because they were running the risk of Steve waking up Sam and Bucky were with him. Turned out Steve had woken up while they were amputating his right arm. A stale beam had crashed down on him, through his upper arm. The damage could not be repaired, even with Steve’s super-soldier serum. Bucky had to pin him down so he wouldn’t be moving too much, while Sam had tried to distract Steve.
Tony tried to stand up which prompted a pitiful moan from Steve.
"I missed you too, Tony."
Tony woke up with a gasp and grabbed at his chest. The lights flickered on and Tony scooted back against the headboard to get away from the piercing bright light.
“Thanks, Tony. I really enjoyed myself back there.”
1,5 week later
'Such a gentleman,' Tony smirked at him, 'but that's not what I asked.'
“And how would you introduce me? Not as playboy, philanthropist, billionaire or genius I hope? I hope you’ll pick something more meaningful than that.”
Tony's cheeks turned a little red and Steve felt like he succeeded in life, he made Tony feel flustered. Maybe he could do this without making a mess?
-----------------
Scott and Wanda seemed indifferent and he couldn't be more glad he assigned them room on the other side of the compound. Vision would keep Wanda busy he had promised.
'You sure Steve? You sound unsure. Who did you dance with? I'm sure someone wanted to swing around with Captain America on the dance floor!'
The bartender just gave Steve his cocktail when Tony appeared at his side. Steve grabbed his drink and took a swig.
Tony ordered a mocktail and leaned against the bar. He shifted his focus on Steve and Steve felt like running, all his tact went out of the window when Tony looked at him. He wanted to impress the man and make him smile and feel comfortable, but he had no clue how to do that. He only stumbled over his words and gave the most basic answers. Tony didn't seem to feel like that about it all though, he seemed to feel exactly the way Steve wanted him to feel.
“I’ve been meaning to ask you, and well since I tend to wait too long I hope I’m not too late, but if I don’t I’ll never know and I really don’t want to risk that. Do you want to go on a date with me? Dinner and movie I mean.”
Tony took Steve to the dance floor and put his arm in the position so Tony could lead Steve. Steve appreciated that since he still couldn't dance, besides the several steps he learned from his mum and Bucky. Slowly Steve picked up on the steps and the rhythm.
'Are you sure? I don't wanna hurt you, with the… the prosthetic I mean and… it's- it's not the best yet with fine motor skills.'
"I definitely won't mind, I would gladly celebrate it with you. I missed you, you all, but especially you." Tony whispered.
It was nine months after the battle against Thanos and his army, nine months after they obliterated the villain and his immense army, nine months after Tony snapped with the six Infinity Stones. Steve still could not believe he was standing here, in a brand-new velvet suit, at the gala to celebrate that they had won and repaired the damage done. Everyone who battled those nine months ago was here as well, even Natasha who had sacrificed herself at Vormir thinking she would not return. Steve had returned the Soul Stone and The Red Skull had granted Steve the option to get one person back and Natasha had returned as Steve had wished.
“Rogers?” He wheezed.
Two weeks later they would have to leave for the mission and after a week Tony called Steve down to the shop.
“Thank you, Tony, that means a lot and I will come to you if you’re really okay with that. I don’t want to bother you.”
"All those fat cats, they exhaust me. It's nice to have the Avengers, Rhodey, and Pepper close by though. Way more bearable than SI gala's." Tony took a swig from his glass and leaned against the bar giving Steve his full attention in that way which made him feel completely exposed. Those damn big brown piercing eyes, they saw everything it seemed.
They both looked at each other and laughed.
“Hey Steve, come on, let’s rearrange so I can finish all these little tasks. I’ll sit in your lap, okay?”
“You are not joking, right?” Tony sounded almost apprehensive.
"Steve, will you dance with me?"
Steve breathed a sigh of relief, took a swig from his drink and sat down on the barstool. Tony grabbed his hand and squeezed it softly.
Tony stood up from his chair and Steve sat down and pulled him into his lap. Steve wrapped his arm again around Tony’s waist with a fistful of his shirt in his grasp and he leaned with his head against the nape of Tony’s neck. Tony covered Steve’s hand with his hand and grabbed his pen with his right hand so he could finish signing some papers.
“Says you…” Steve peered up at him opening one eye.
(See the end of the chapter for
They then went to grab some food and talked about all the mistakes they had made themselves looking back at the situation. For the first time Tony opened up to someone who wasn't his therapist about the vision Wanda had shown him and the following disaster of it all and Steve opened up about him still feeling disconnected despite all the tries from his friends and when it finally seemed to work Peggy had died, Bucky had appeared, Ultron happened and then the Accords resulting in the airport fight and Siberia's bunker fight. Steve apparently thought of himself not being worthy of happiness and that was where Steve and he seemed to connect the strongest.
“Yeah, I’m fine. Just go to bed, we have another two days of this mission and then we can both go our own way again.”
Tony was looking at him with huge eyes like he had just asked him to do something impossible.
'Tones, I am worried. Pepper and I are worried.'
Steve retreated to a table with his drink and looked around the room. Most people who fought along with him in the battle were at the gala as well.
Goodbye red and gold, hello black armour!
“Yeah, let’s do that.” Steve smiled back at him.
“I just wish you would have come to me about it. You’re doing really well in this odd new era despite only being here for less than a year and I just forgot for a minute you might not know things.” Tony rambled to him.
Tony had been on this complicated stealth mission with Steve for three days now. They had to check up on five bases in the west of China. Really just checking if the signs they got from that area would become something troublesome or false alarm. It was mid-July so approximately 15 ℃, so their dingy wooden cabin wasn’t too bad to stay in. Tony had shot a prayer at the God’s above for the cabin having two bedrooms, the god being Nick Fury, Maria Hill and Phil Coulson. If it were up to the other Avengers they would put them in the Hulk room and not let them out until they finally kissed and made-up. Tony was not feeling that method.
The dark side of Iron Man comes out
“A Long Island Iced Tea?”
'Don't worry about it genius, I would tell you if you hurt me. You know that, and you would have to squeeze real hard to hurt me, which you won't. You would notice and I'm sure the R&D department of SI with Peter and you isn't making anything that is the absolute best of quality. Let's go, okay?' Steve searched Tony eye for any signs he didn't want to. He didn't find it, so he pulled softly and they walked to the floor. Steve rubbed Tony's prosthetic arm softly, knowing the sensors would pick up such subtle touches, and he heard Tony sigh and lose some tension.
“Just ask Jarvis if you need me, and… feel free to come down to the workshop if you want?”
Bruce and Steve were the outsiders in this case. Bruce felt too uncomfortable talking about donating money, talking about science was fine but he still seemed to want to run home to the tower.
Tony gasped, "Captain, I am hurt!", he exclaimed. Tony laughed and took another swig from his drink.
"Steve, you're not supposed to look at your feet. Look up, like you’re sure of what you’re doing."
Steve hissed a little but shot a grateful look at him. Steve slumped into the couch as soon as they arrived at the cabin. Tony locked it down and asked Friday to keep up surveillance of their surroundings.
Tony had given the team the limited information he knew and then passed out again. He woke up roughly half an hour later when the team had reached them. Tony had stumbled towards Steve, pushing away anyone who tried to catch him and stop him from reaching his boyfriend. Tony saw a rescue squad lifting his Steve onto a stretcher and into a trauma helicopter. All alarm bells started ringing in his mind. Steve looked so unnaturally pale and he hadn’t moved at all, Tony sunk to the ground on his knees, somewhere distant he felt rubble puncturing his hands and legs and his ankles were throbbing, but he did not care, his probably lifeless boyfriend was getting carried away into a trauma helicopter. A body had sat down next to him, wrapped his arms around him and let him sob into his shoulder, the distinct perfume of Rhodey he noticed. Tony had passed out from shock, which resulted in him waking up in a hospital bed. Rhodey and Nat sat next to him and Rhodey had given him a glass of water while Nat had asked a nurse to come and look at Tony. He had gotten some saltine crackers, later when the shock had completely worn off he got an actual meal.
“Bruce, do we know the exact number of bodies?”
The water washed away the quiet sounds of his tearless cries (that were only audible to God’s ears).

“No,” Steve said quickly. “No, Tony, but I wanted to.” The blond man chuckled. “I left her at the bar. I went to the bathroom to text Nat to ask what to do and Nat told me to just leave through the kitchen, so I handed money to the bartender to cover our bill and I left. Like a coward.”
Someone was shouting at him in a language he didn’t know, and Tony cringed at the tone. Even though he couldn’t see him, the sheer Alpha-ness the man in front of him emitted stole the oxygen in the room, and not in a good way. If Yinsen was right, that they were being held by a pack of Alphas, and unmated ones at that, there was no way Tony would get out of this unscathed. Beside him, Yinsen replied softly before he addressed Tony in English, “They want weapons.” The Alpha said a few more words, and Yinsen translated, “They want the Jericho.”
His wings shifted uncomfortably within the confines of his back brace that meticulously hid his wings from sight.

“Code names,” Steve said, fighting two bots and smashing their heads together, aiming his shield at two other bots that were coming towards him ominously.
The bubble of laughter burst through, and Steve laughed and laughed and laughed, eyes crinkling at their antics. He enjoyed their easy banter and admired the way Clint’s purple wings tangled with Natasha’s blood-red ones like children.
Steve sighed and flexed his hand, feeling the pain radiate down his arm. “You should go away. They’re not wrong. I’m a bit of a freak.”

“You’re totally blushing,” Deborah interrupted. “He’s been here every day for a cup of black coffee and nothing else. He doesn’t even finish his coffee.”
His eyes slipped shut, his mind whirling at a thousand miles per hour, reminiscing moment by moment of everything that came to head in this apocalyptic event, revisiting every decision that could have been changed so that the tragedy could have been avoided.
“Take point?”
“Stop trying to cling onto the past that is no longer there.”
“If you help me,” Nebula said when the silence dragged out for a long time, “if we defeat Thanos and take away the Infinity Stones from him, Earth can be protected. We can reverse his damage, but I can’t do this alone.”
“I wasn’t ever going to, honest, I was just going to keep to myself and be over here making your uniforms look really good on your ass so that I could fantasize, goddammit I am still drunker than I want to be for this call, but I wasn’t going to say anything. I was just going to keep fucking people who weren’t you to see if I could get you out of my system. I mean, it hasn’t worked yet, but maybe I just need to keep testing the hypothesis. You deserve better than me, Steven. You always have and you always will and Carol is so great, so so great, so that’s it. I love you, you have a great ass, and I’m hanging up now.”
But he could help Yinsen escape. Tony may not deserve to live, but Yinsen did - there was a mission for him to accomplish, an admirable one. “Okay,” Tony said aloud. He would help Yinsen live. He nodded and repeated, “okay.”
There was an odd look on Vision’s face as he pulled away. “Of course,” he agreed. “I will take good care of him. Please do not worry.”
Barton’s shoulders slumped. “I’ll get him.” He staggered to his feet, swaying a little. He put the cup of ice chips down on the little table beside the ever-present pebble. “He was - he’s
(I love M'Baku, that is all.)
They walked back companionably, Tony with the child in his arms, Vision by his side.
He left her to it and stepped back outside, to where Minoru and Mordo were still arguing.
Possibility two was that the ritual wasn’t designed to kill them, per se, so they’d still been alive when the whatever-it-was - “I’ve decided that we’re going with ‘temporal event’, mostly because I’m the one that found it, so no, Barton, you can’t call it a fucking ‘time door’, this isn’t Doctor Who,” - did its thing and turned them back into kids. Rogers must have been close enough to be affected.
"Yes, boss?"
Crouched beside the pallet, Barton narrowly escaped getting punched by virtue of toppling backwards on his ass instead. “Hey, steady!”
Rhodey reached over and grabbed a hold of his hand, squeezing gently. “He’ll be fine,” he said quietly. He glanced up at Wilson, who was scowling, then back at Tony. “He’s in and out of it, a lot. Clint’s been sitting with him a little bit, you know, in between getting everything ready for - uh, later. He’s been asking for you,” he said after a moment. “Steve, obviously, not Clint.” He paused. “Although Clint has, as well, but mostly he said to tell you to quit lazing around and get dressed, so.” He shrugged.
He looked back down at the small form on the bed and swallowed hard, remembering the small bed with its Iron Man bed sheets and the box of toys left in the living room. Everything a growing child could want (and probably the least that could be expected a king’s hospitality). Wouldn’t Pepper have done the same if Tony had ever had Harley over to stay? Wouldn’t he have come back to the Tower to find a playroom made up, and meals arranged, and Harley’s mom’s number programmed into his speed-dial?
“Why does it always have to be the costumed lot,” Tony muttered, staring with appalled fascination at the attacker, who in addition to holding up the guard with one hand, was also wielding a
The doctor didn’t even looked at him as she tapped away at her tablet, perched on the edge of his makeshift hospital bed. “You’ve never had brain surgery before.” After a moment she relented and looked up. “Look, Dr Stark. As I said, I believe the surgery was successful and we were able to repair all the damage without any lasting effects.” She grimaced. “But there is a protocol for these things, and despite how unorthodox this entire procedure has been, I would be remiss if I were to discharge you without ensuring that you are fully recovered and able to care for yourself -
Tony watched him go, noting the line of Barton’s shoulders and the slight stagger in his step. He’d been in a fight himself, he realised. The black eye, the stiffness in his movements… they must have run into some trouble out there before they’d been called back. He still didn't know what they'd found, where everyone was. Why hadn’t Barton gotten his injuries seen to? If the Wakandan medics could carry out keyhole neurosurgery in a fucking
Tony thought uneasily,
Tony thought about being difficult, but - much as he liked winding up SHIELD in general and Hill in particular -  it really wasn’t a smart move to put his people’s backs up. Hill might be Fury’s woman for the most part, but she was still - at least a little bit - one of Tony’s. He rubbed at the bridge of his nose and grimaced. “I missed the Board meeting, huh?”
tell Rhodey, clear?"
the whole hysterical mother bit. No sign of her at all.” He looked down at his folded hands.
Barton was right about something else, too - Tony opened up the HUD the moment Barnes and Maximoff left, Steve sat next to him at the little table, his red crayon clutched tightly in his grip.
Rhodey looked at him for a long moment. “Tony? What’s this about?”
and hadn’t there been something about a perpetual flame? Or serpents? Something fairly unforgettable, as images went, anyway.
“Boss. That goes from me as well. You don’t have to do this. Whatever you decide, we have your back on this.” Happy reached over and took her hand in both of his and Pepper shifted so that her shoulder was pressed against his; an army of two at his back, standing against the world.
Abruptly, the events of the last couple of days slammed back into sharp focus and Tony bolted upright in the bed, his chest clenching. They must have put him under for a bit; he’d probably been running on fumes. How long had it been? And where was the kid? “Is he okay?” Of course he wasn’t, he was in
He was fast coming to realise that, when the chips were down and he had to make the hard choices, he also had an order of priority. And most of the Avengers?
Okoye shook her head. “Photostatic veils leave a trace signature on electronic equipment; we are compensating for it. We may not be able to see the face beneath, but we will b able to know if the image has been altered.”
First, though -
Awareness returned abruptly.
get to make that choice? Mr Infallible. Who died and made
Rhodey brought his wheelchair around to the nearest bench and hesitated. “Let’s pause here,” he said, not looking at Tony.
Wait.
bitter because goddamn Rogers and his bullshit confidence. He’ll pay it?
Content warnings: some mentions of child death, canon-typical violence.
He'd need to leave a note, make it clear that his trip was unauthorised and that no one in the US military (or the UN Accords Council) had any knowledge of his entry into Georgia, let alone the restricted South Ossetia region. If anyone spotted him...
“How are the others?” He didn’t even have the option of setting Steve down somewhere and going back to help; not if the guy could just magic himself back to the kid whenever he pleased. No, he needed to keep them out of reach and moving, and the best he could do was hope that there hadn’t been any further casualties. “Have they checked in?”
“Um…” Steve looked up, panicked, from where he was attempting to spoon the spilled jam from the floor back into the jar. “I can put it back in!”
, Tony had thought at the time.
It turned out that not even the most advanced nation on Earth had been able to do away with post-op recovery times.
Tony thought. Or maybe it was because Tony was a known quantity. Well. A
“We have no wish to kill you.” T’Challa leaned forward, his most conciliatory face on. “You are the one who attacked us. Who are you? Why are you trying to hurt the child?”
M’Baku smiled and looked away, making a big deal out of examining his fingertips. “Hmmm. Ask me again later, mzungu.” He laughed at Tony’s expression then leaned in again, expression softening as he pointed at Steve’s drawing. “That is an interesting picture, Steve. Who’s that?”
He could take the child. He could take the child, and try to find out what was happening, for good or ill. Surely even Steve couldn’t fault him for that. And besides…
But Mordo hadn’t known they’d been aware of that little factoid, had he? That was surprise in his face. So what did that tell them?
They watched the children in silence for a little while. After a moment, Tony became aware of another presence and looked up, surprised. “What are you doing here?” He hadn’t noticed anyone else headed this way.
Wanda said sadly. Her face was wet.
“You know, you haven’t asked me what happened.” He reached out and poked one spindly arm. “How I know you, where you are.”
Steve didn’t seem to hear him, finally letting go of the death-grip he had on his ribs to worm his cold hands around Tony’s neck instead, letting his head fall on Tony’s shoulder.
- had oversight over the companies supposedly suing them, then they could drop the lawsuit whenever the danger was past. It did have the downside of denying SI itself access to the data, but if the Avengers were suspended, there wasn’t much point to it anyway. (And it wasn’t as if Tony didn’t keep off-the-book back-ups.) Tony paused for a moment, then turned to Barton. “Well?”
He forced himself to unclench his fists and breathe out slowly. It wasn't bad advice, per se. He looked back at Barton, at the tense line of his shoulders and the careful way his hands cradled the controls. He remembered the frantic movement of Barton’s eyes when he’d been under Mordo’s spell; wondered just how much it had cost Barton to put all his worry and panic and pain to one side and wrap his arms around his kids and smile as if he meant it.
"Boss, you have an urgent call, you need to wake up."
“Is there literally any way I can talk you out of this?” Barton asked. He sounded… tired.
! Steve was -
Steve sniffled, and wiped his nose on Tony’s shoulder.
“... Sure.”
“Probably not.” Rhodey was silent for a long while. Finally, he shrugged. “Anyway, everyone got back okay. It was fine. And seven months ago, one of the guys in my unit hung himself in his garage.”
All he could offer her was neutrality. They weren’t friends - they never had been, probably, because they were both too good at this; Tony too good at putting up walls and Natasha too good at wearing masks - but they didn’t have to be, not for this. They could - maybe, possibly,
“Some parts. Many parts - look, what I mean is, thank you for, you know.” He waved a hand vaguely. He still wasn’t clear on what the politics were here, other than Barton’s previous comments that there had been a whole lot of shouting (and his own private conviction that T’Challa owed this guy somehow). “... Everything.”
“Just in case,” Nat echoed, her face expressionless.
“So there is no one who could vouch for you?” Romanoff asked, almost apologetically. “You must know that nothing you have said would mean we would give you access to the child.”
So there’s no lozenge, there's no juice, there isn't any chair. In fact, there's really nothing he can do except hold on to the edge of his worktable and focus on keeping himself upright. He swallows, dry, and it hurts like sandpaper. “Alright,” he can hear himself say, as if from very far away. “Alright, Rogers. What you're asking is possible, yes. But there's a price for my time these days. Some of us have to pay for the roof over your head, you know. I can't just give away my time and inventions for free. And what you're asking for… it'll cost you.”
he thought, but did not say. Even if Barton had gone to ground, it wasn’t as though Rogers was running short on back-up.
Tony managed a smile at that.
At that, Rhodey flushed a little. “Physio,” he said under his breath. “The flight was… not the best experience.”
“There is such a fixed point,” Mordo said from behind her, expressionless. “It is a person, now in his child state. He was caught in the flux from one of the portals several weeks ago. He has been in their care since then.”
Rhodey reached out and grabbed hold of his wrist, squeezing reassuringly. “Steve’s just down the hall,” he said quietly. “They put him in the PICU for the time being. They hope to move him to a normal ward soon, but…” His grip tightened. “How are you doing?”
Tony believed that oversight was necessary. No - he
She inclined her head to one side and met his gaze finally. Her eyes were very green and very clear. Her lips had drawn back, showing the sharp points of her eye-teeth; a challenge, he recognised dimly. “If you do not think there is a reason to,” she said quietly, “then let me wake up Steve right now. I can start to work with him; I am sure that I can bring out what he remembers-”
The journey itself was blessedly uneventful, albeit excruciatingly long-winded. Even with the quinjet it took the better part of 18 hours. Barton and Barnes took turns piloting - Tony pitched in with a 3 hour stint when even Barnes was starting to look a little rough around the edges - and Steve dropped off somewhere over West Africa and stayed that way for pretty much the rest of the flight.
As they sat down, Wilson reached over a hand over Rhodey’s knee, not squeezing, not even looking at him for any length of time, just letting it rest there. After a moment, Rhodey settled his own hand over Wilson’s.
“To kill her.” Mordo said softly. He looked away. “You are wasting time in detaining me here. All I need is the child, and I will be able to track her down.” He spread his hands and tried for a smile. “Surely we can agree that allowing her to continue is not acceptable. The child - he is a link back to he. I can use him to find her.”
anywhere, despite the automatic doors swooshing open periodically. Surely the wind outside would blow in plenty of debris? Where did it all go?
“He OK? Barnes?” Or was he sequestered away, having his own world and sanity falling apart…
“Two days at the very minimum,” the doctor said oppressively. She scribbled something on her tablet that Tony strongly suspected included the words,
On the whole oversight/decision-making issues... Tony is still not in a great place re: the Accords. He believes in oversight, dammit, and he believes that being held accountable is the right thing to do. (And I agree to be honest - I'm a humanitarian aid worker and I'm used to working under stringent standards and frankly if you have access to vulnerable people you should be held accountable because people are awful and without accountability there is abuse.)
This seemed to amuse Mordo rather than disturb him. “As you say.” He seemed to be doing his best to pretend that Wanda wasn’t there, looking back down at the hands he held clasped loosely in his lap. “And when we land?”
She folded her arms and leaned against the closed door, watching him silently.
Tony stared at the closed door, shifting Steve in his grip. The child had gone limp with relief the moment he was back in Tony’s arms, the exertion of his lunge across the bed exhausting him. He was visibly slipping into sleep, his breathing wet and pained-sounding. “Are you kidding me? I’m offering, and he -”
“Will you be able to assist him?” T’Challa said, looking a little put-out to have to say it aloud rather than have Tony offer unprompted.
He left Tony at Steve’s bedside, watching him sleep.
Likely needing medical attention, anyway.
What, that was supposed to be news? Steve’s self-flagellation was supposed to be something new and shocking to him?
“Yeah, and look how well
(Or maybe whatever had happened with Vision had been an unexpected spanner in the works, and he was no longer as fixed as Mordo had assumed. Maybe now that the floodgates had opened, the adult Steve would keep returning, a little longer each time, an adult mind in a child’s body, slowly breaking under the strain.)
as Maximoff’s bracelet suddenly opened in response, clattering to the ground, and she reached for the swordsman with her magic.
going to need to talk to Jane Foster.”
Barton looked up from the briefing pack he’d pulled into his lap. As he slid it back onto the table, Tony caught a glimpse of the photo he’d been looking at and swallowed. It was a little brown-haired girl, Lila Barton’s age, lying in a pool of blood, her face turned away from the camera.
He was in Germany, and Rhodey was falling, falling,
But his own aborted attempts to make peace with Wanda Maximoff were neither here nor there where Steve’s best interests were concerned. Especially not when he had other options he could explore. He sighed. “Look. I’m not going to rehash a discussion that’s already settled. It’s not because of you, it’s -” He stuttered to a stop, unsure of how to articulate his feelings. There was a lot in there, and most of it wasn’t stuff he was willing to share. Things about whether Rogers might actually
“Rhodey,” he whined. “C’mon. Everyone’s acting so fucking weird, I’m starting to wonder if I’m not concussed.”
“So.” A couple of hours later Barton sat down next to Tony and looked across at where Steve was still sleeping quietly. It was an hour or so until dawn; not that they’d be seeing the sun, of course. But the artificial lighting would brighten automatically then to simulate it. That was, if D'Artagnan didn't choose this time to launch his big attack follow-up. “Was the big confab everything you dreamed it would be?”
Tony thought faintly.
- his actual sword, which was not, unfortunately, a stage-safe plastic one.
to social services and let them place him with strangers. (Because the one man who might place the child’s safety above the world’s was the one man that Tony didn’t trust around a helpless child,
He looked at the tear-streaked face and wiped a hand over it gently.
If reasoning with him didn’t work, if finding common ground wasn’t possible… well, they could always find out who the madman loved, and… “It’s like the whole concept of humanity has passed you by entirely, hasn’t it?” Came out of his mouth before he could call it back.
Would he even know if there was a difference? He thought he remembered someone - Maximoff? - there with him during the surgery, or maybe just after… but maybe it had been a dream. Maybe he just hadn’t been able to separate out one nightmare from another.
The door crashed open, Okoye and half a dozen similarly-uniformed women running in, Barnes and Maximoff hot on their heels. Maximoff’s eyes were glowing red.
This was precisely the reaction that Tony was hoping he wouldn’t be confronted with. “It’s not permanent,” he said irritably, aware of just how close he was to pedantry.
(He breathed out.)
Something unclenched in Tony at that. “Good, that’s - thanks, Vis. That would be good.” Rhodey and Wilson, they’d both put Steve first. And Vision could get him out of danger if it all turned sour. It would be OK. M’Baku felt confident enough in the security to let his kids play with Steve, didn’t he? He’d hardly do that if he thought Steve was being actively targeted. It was fine. It was
“Our love’s more 24/7 than 7/11,” Tony snapped back automatically, then made himself take a breath. No reason to take it out on Wilson, no matter how much he wanted to cry, or to wring Steve’s (or Nat’s) neck. “Sorry. Habit. I can’t get through to Rhodey, and Barton said he was in surgery - is he out, yet? How’s he doing?”
“As opposed to my normal disposition these days, which is sunshine and roses.”
. He’d thought that he could simply say his goodbyes and be on his way; he hadn’t counted on Maximoff’s earnest attempt to be conciliatory and meet him halfway. Maybe this all had something to do with Natasha, who was sat on Wanda’s left side, not having said a word since he’d announced his intentions to leave in - he checked his watch discreetly - fifteen minutes from now. He sighed.
The child nodded, his little fingers tight on Tony’s T-shirt. He didn’t seem surprised to hear that, and by the familiar set of his jaw, he was clearly trying his best to be stoic about it.
“So that’s it? That’s the plan? That’s -”
me!” It was a rhetorical question. Of
And… look, he was never going to be Barnes’s biggest fan. Once the kid was gone and that asshole Rogers was back, things would be a lot simpler; he could be angry and hurt and assholish to both supersoldiers without any twinge of his conscience. But until then, the best solution would be to hand Steve over, and go and figure out how to turn him back.
There was so much
“Hmmmm,” M’Baku said, which seemed to be neither here nor there. He sat down in the chair beside the bed, on the opposite side from Steve, his hands relaxed by his side. Tony did not fail to notice how carefully he positioned himself, so as to look non-threatening. (He did not delude himself into thinking this was for his benefit. No, if he’d been on his own, this conversation would perhaps be going differently. But with Steve by his side…) “I have not kept myself as informed of the outside world as perhaps I should have,” M’Baku said slowly. “But I have heard of you, Tony Stark. I had thought that you did not have children.” His expression shifted minutely.
He’d been brave and selfish when he’d built DUMM-E, when he’d laid down the groundwork for JARVIS. When he’d kissed Pepper, when he’d co-opted Rhodey into his life wholesale. He’d opened up the Tower to a team of strangers, and then built an entire new facility for them. He’d eaten pizza with Clint, and watched films with Nat, and sat up late talking with Steve and -
He thought about keeping his mouth shut, but… “You should take your own advice a little bit. I get that you’re angry at Rogers - and me - and I get

at his lowest and make Tony sit through them so he’d develop - what? Fucking
“Because… OK, you remember what happened when I was away, right?”
They’d be lucky if they didn’t manage to accidentally kill the kid with all these frequent bouts of exposure.
Which also explains why Tony had such an atypical medical experience in Jabariland. Based on my recent re-watch, the medical facilities in the mountains were basic, at best. I'm guessing that one of the things that both T'Challa and Shuri would have felt strongly about would be to extend medical tech to the people who saved T'Challa's life, so let's assume that a Jabariland Clinic was in the process of being established when Tony et al crashed on M'Baku's doorstep.
It wasn’t even that Steve was - technically - sleeping a few feet away. Or that Tony wasn’t entirely sure he wanted to hear what Rogers thought worth recording, half a world and a broken promise away. It was simpler than that: he didn’t want to have to find out this way. He didn’t want Romanoff to choose for him, to have the decision be taken out of Rogers’s hands. Romanoff had combed through the recordings for useful data already (and, depending on the length, possibly she’d had help from the others) so it wasn’t as though there was anything in there that wouldn’t have been pulled out and indexed in the data packets that sat neatly piled to one side.
The blinds, Tony realised suddenly; Wilson must have been sat in the chair near the window and he’d closed the blinds when Tony had complained about the light. “What’s he doing here? What are
Shuri blinked at him. “To see - what would disrupt the existing signature? We needed to know how to hide him, if the tracking was active.” She looked at him a little uncertainly. "It's why I suggested taking him to M'Baku - the mountain would cloak him..."
Steve looked up at Tony from his position on the floor - surrounded by loose paper and his favourite crayons - and nodded. As long as Tony remained in his line of sight, everything was fine; no tears, no screaming.
“Nope.” Wilson stepped away, his face suddenly bland. He reached down and pressed his hand against Rhodey’s shoulder. “I’ll see you back at reception when you’re done, okay?” He left before Rhodey could answer.
targeting you?”
“I said it was fine,” Tony snapped.
T’Challa was doing what every good host would do for a child visitor. And Tony...
Barton’s jaw clenched. “We didn’t have a lot of choice,” he muttered, visibly trying not to fidget. “And with everything - there wasn’t time to reach Rhodes, so…”
Romanoff’s eyes flickered to the bundle of blankets in Tony’s arms - and the spindly, bare arms that poked out to cling to the raised collar of the Iron Man suit - and she raised an eyebrow. “I was in the neighbourhood.”
Tony had no illusions about the state of his own soul. He had not stepped away from weapons manufacturing because he intrinsically objected to the theory behind them. Weapons were - always - only a means to an end. When his father had founded the weapons manufacturing division of Stark Industries, that end had been victory in the war. (And money, always money - but money through ethical means, money through a moral industry.) An objective good, achieved by millions of little evils. The dead immolated in the torched cities had not been soldiers; it had not been self-defence except in the grandest of ways. The war had to be won in order to prevent a greater evil from prevailing. And so, someone - somewhere in a little room, thinking about the ends and not about the cost to his soul - had said,
She fled before he could get another word out.
he thought desperately.
Tony threw him a dirty look. “You are not allowed to speak, like,
He took the long route back to the PICU, taking his time. The rest of the hospital looked pretty much like every hospital around the world, although the floors did look suspiciously clean. Tony was privately wondering whether Wakanda had mastered the art of forcefields, because there was no
Wilson was frowning at him. “So you were respecting Steve’s privacy? What if there’d been mission-critical stuff in there?”
“How’s it looking?” He asked Barton, yawning and inching into the cockpit to peer out of the window. Barnes was already awake and getting himself ready in the back compartment.
Well, there was only one way to find out, he supposed. “It’s about Steve,” he started.
“... that bad, huh?”
Barton shrugged at that, looking a little uncomfortable. “He’s fine. Tired - he wouldn’t sleep. Wouldn't let go of you. Screamed every time we tried to coax him away. Holding on to him while you were under was a piece of work, let me tell you. If he wasn't full of supersoldier serum, Barnes would still be sporting the scars.”
That wasn’t the worst plan Tony had heard. Unless Ross could pass emergency powers he wouldn’t be able to yank anything out of escrow, and if Hill - and more importantly,
Tony stared at the child-sized bed - and the colourful Iron Man duvet cover - for a full minute before he managed to look away.
And Tony had shut up. Because it wasn’t
What would Rogers have done? Maybe nothing. Maybe. Or maybe…
And, like the idiots they were, they’d all decided that there was no chance of the bad guys coming back to finish the job and cut up one last kid.
It had been too late for quite some time.
, progressed through,
Steve was a really lousy liar, Tony had no idea how the fuck he’d grown up to be so good at obfuscation when he’d had so little to work with.
“Stark…” Barnes grabbed his arm. “Wait, Stark!”
“Are you certain you have the right place?” Okoye asked, looking around. “I do not see an entrance.”
The swordsman turned to face him, one hand still closed tight around the neck of the guard. “Now why would Iron Man be in Birnin Zana?” The man asked in a cultured English accent, shifting his stance slightly. He tightened his grip, his hand jerking sharply to one side, and the guard went limp in his grip. “How interesting.” He let go, the guard’s head hitting the ground with the heavy, wet thud that Tony knew far too well. “I do not wish to hurt you, Mr Stark. Please stand aside.”
“I do, and my point is this: you might not have the money or the equipment, but you have a knack for getting other people to just
,” Tony grit out. He could feel something hot and wet trickle down the side of his face. Then, a moment later, “sorry, baby girl. But I can’t land. Not until it’s safe.”
She took a deep breath. “It is as I said. I … apologise. For what I did to you at the base, when you first came.” She swallowed, looking a little green. “I should have said something before. That I did not… It was… cruel.”
Barton paused by the door and shook his head slowly. “No. Looks like Dr Foster’s theory might be right.” His lips quirked in a tired smile. “Get some rest, Tony. I’ll be back in a few hours.”
In the silence that followed, Rhodey seemed to want to look anywhere other than at Tony, his gaze finally settling on the child-sized bed and its sole occupant. “The Red Knight, huh?”
reassured, not
Mordo’s new modus operandi seemed to be focused on making peace with Tony, probably so his sudden yet inevitable betrayal later on would have some dramatic tension. At least, that was the only possible explanation Tony could come up for why the guy had chosen to sit next to him on the flight over when there was a perfectly serviceable seat next to, say, Barnes. As it is, Barnes had sat behind Tony and Wanda had sat in front of Mordo, beside Barton in the pilot’s seat. Okoye rounded off the team, busily examining her knives in the seat beside Barnes.
The briefing was mostly a rehash of stuff he already knew, with some added horrors thrown in. He’d already figured out that the likely scenario was that Rogers had interrupted the ritual killing, or had maybe not even reached the room before the whatever-it-was had happened. After all, other than being turned into a shrimp, he wasn’t injured. Unless the time pocket - or whatever it was - had healed him? It was a possibility, he supposed, but if that was the case, surely the time pocket would have healed the other soldiers as well? Unless…
but hadn’t he wanted Barton to do that? Wasn’t the whole point to deposit the kid at casa del A-Team and then get back to a full schedule of nightmares and anxiety?
That was a bit surprising. Clearly someone had managed to get him changed out of the grotty pajamas he’d had on the call with Tony, and had given him a bath. But why was he wearing Tony’s T-shirt? He had plenty of other pajamas. Had Steve asked for it, or had one of the others offered? It didn’t seem like the sort of thing that either Vision or Natasha would have known to do. (Tony’s mom had done that for him when he wouldn’t quieten down.
Well, OK, probably that was more for the kid’s benefit than Tony’s; and sure, Tony could probably stretch to that for half an hour or so. He’d never done it before, and it might even be fu- “Is that an
“Is it a safe dosage for someone his age?” Tony asked, suddenly anxious. “I thought you weren’t supposed to give the adult stuff to kids.” He’d read that somewhere. Hadn’t he? Wouldn’t Barton know this stuff? He’d managed to raise three kids, surely that meant he knew what he was doing...
Tony had tried to settle him down, he honestly had. He’d told him it was OK, and he’d told him that everything was going to be fine. He’d told him that it had just been a bad dream - for all that it had been during the day, with Steve wide awake - and as he'd spoken, he’d run through all the options in his mind, frantically, trying to gauge the threat at the same time as he’d soothed the child. It had to have been the mind stone, that was the only explanation. They knew that Steve was connected to the portal, and that the connection had re-established every time it was open. They knew that Mordo wanted access to Steve as something more than just a way to find Umar. And Steve had not been around Vision before, he hadn’t been anywhere near the mind stone while the portal was open. No, that was the only thing that fit all the facts. The mind stone, plus the portal….
“Your majesty,” Tony said evenly. “A pleasure as always. What can I do for you?”
“... yeah,” Tony said, his voice hoarse. “Yeah, Steve. Whatever you want.”
He rested his hands against Rhodey’s back, feeling the smooth movement of his ribs and spine, and said nothing.
“Steve? Come on, kid, don’t do this - FRIDAY, get the heat cranked up - Steve, come on -” He half-fell out of the suit as the heating elements suddenly powered up to almost scalding, lifting Steve inside and cushioning him with his body against the icy blast that slammed into them almost immediately. “FRIDAY, where the hell is Okoye’s welcome party? She said -”
“I’m fine, stop fussing.”
It usually starts off with a rushing sound in his ears, his vision graying out in spots. Low blood pressure, his doctor had said, with a touch of wonder in her voice. She had expected his blood pressure to be through the roof, given everything, and it was. Mostly.
The expression on Hill’s face told him all he needed to know. “It can’t be both?”
Barton sighed and sat down on the edge of the table. “Well, my plan did involve the mountain, but it also involved Scott sitting on you in his giant form until the rest of us figured out a way to track down both D’Artagnan and the crazy shish-kebab lady, and then, you know, have a traditional fight,” he admitted. “None of this trap malarkey. I was voted down.” He shrugged. “I still think my plan was better. Less chance of you doing something stupid, for one thing.”
He scrolled down to the entry tagged ‘Siberia’, staring. Two minutes. What could it hurt?
Tony winced and tried to extract an arm from under the blankets so he could pet him. “Yup. 100% alive, 99% of the time. You OK?”
The child turned in his sleep, blinking his way back to wakefulness and shifting under Tony’s hand. “... you’re here,” he said, soft and pleased.
immediately
“Steve. I’m not stealing him.” He’d waved the tablet - Barton’s note still on his notification screen - accusingly.
Barton tensed beside him.
T’Challa stared at him for a short while. “What sort of threat?”
She glowered at him and turned to Barton, who was busy examining his shoes in an effort to give Tony the illusion of privacy. “Agent Barton. Can I trust you to notify us if his condition deteriorates? He is cleared, but the risk of blood clots without the anticoagulants cannot be eliminated entirely.”
” He laughed again, watching Steve sleep with that same soft expression on his face. “She was completely unrepentant. See, she’d remembered that she wasn’t supposed to cross the road on her own. But Laura hadn’t explained that ‘don’t wander off’ also meant not going home by herself.” He reached out and smoothed down Steve’s rumpled hair, soothing him as he twitched in his sleep. He turned slightly and met Tony’s eyes. “You keep them as safe as you can, as much as you can, for as long as you can. And then you trust that you gave them enough sense to shout if there’s a problem. That’s all you can do.” He shrugged a little. “It’s all anyone can do. You’re not screwing this up, OK? You’re doing fine.”
“OK,” Pepper sighed, as if all the fight had gone out of her. “I’ll arrange it. Send me a list of anything you’ve decided on, and I’ll figure the rest out.”

Obie had asked him the first time he’d OD’d and ended up in hospital after his parents had died. (He’d OD’d before, of course, but it had never been quite as bad - or as calculated - as this.)
Tony blinked at him, still on his knees in the hospital hallway. “What?”
“Off,” he muttered, and tried to get to his feet.
“A magic user?” FRIDAY voice rose in concern. “Boss, is there any chance they’ll come back?”
Rhodey had confessed to him, sleep-slurred, back when he’d still been in hospital. They’d given him the run-down, and they’d still been holding out hope that a lot of things would go away as the spinal shock faded. But
“Was it something I said?”
“Yes, ma’am,” Barnes murmured.
Tony had not stopped weapons manufacturing because he had stopped believing in weapons. He had merely stopped believing in the effectiveness of the safeguards of the system. He would make the suits, and he would re-design the helicarriers, and he would make Barton better arrows, and Romanoff more effective electroshock bracelets, and he had not deluded himself that he was doing this because they could not be misused. All he had thought was,
“But why didn’t it affect the non-organic matter?” Rhodey asked, frowning.
thing I never wanted -” Her voice broke. She brushed away the tears on her cheeks angrily, scrubbing at her eyes with the same furious, helpless gesture that -
For a mad moment, Tony thought that Barnes was talking to him, and tried to stagger to his feet. But -
Tony couldn’t spare her a look, too busy staring down the silent Barnes. Maybe he could persuade T’Challa to assign some guards to accompany Barnes whenever he was with the kid. Just to be on the safe side. Just in case...
“It’s not that I don’t trust you,” he told Mordo unapologetically. “It’s just that I want to make it as easy as possible for Wanda to put you down like a rabid dog if you put even a foot out of line.” Or to hold him still for long enough for Okoye and Barnes to gut him, which he was also surprisingly OK with.
“No,” he whimpered. He couldn’t hear himself, but it didn’t matter. He stared back at the cold, hungry eyes, and as the wolf prowled closer, a predator towards his prey, it spurred him into terrified action. He shifted, snapping the seatbelt that held him to the seat, and he ran out of the Humvee on all four legs. Howls rose out from behind him, and he ran faster.

, and he couldn’t bear to shut him down when it was all he had left in this place. Still, he was glad that he could emulate some of Steve’s snark in STEVE. “And how many times do I have to tell you to call me Tony?”

“Steve?”
“Talk to him,” Natasha said gently as they got up.
Steve imagined that they were accusing them of being unable to stop this death and destruction.
After a moment, Steve looked up at Tony. “What’s a dick?”
“I think we should get him the action figures,” Rhodey said, watching the interaction with no small measure of amusement from the far side of the room. “Or maybe the plush toys.”
“Captain Rogers is flying under the radar,” the king said, looking a bit bemused. “You are here on a personal visit. I cannot simply choose to leave a child in the extended care of anyone other than a family member, Dr Stark. There were certain safeguards that needed to be followed. But now that we have satisfied ourselves that it is appropriate to release Captain Rogers into your custody, we are able to proceed with discharging him from the PICU. I would have thought you’d be pleased; you have been most vocal in checking on his progress with the doctors.”
he’d said in his little boy’s voice.
For one brief, brilliant moment, Tony considered not going. Just saying,
“You didn't answer my question,” Steve said, waving the knife menacingly. His voice had gained a shrillness normally associated with missed naptimes or the loss of favourite toys. “Are you a bad guy?”
“I assume you know why I’m here.”
Her hands - and bare wrists - were clearly visible from Tony’s viewpoint.
Tony tipped Steve back, angling his head so that Barton could see. “His lips are going blue.”
(The shield flashed silver and red as it swung down.)
Hearing the sword guy’s yell of rage as he sped them out of reach was possibly the most satisfying thing he’d heard all week.
“FRIDAY, if you don’t have something useful to say, you need to stay
That was gonna go over like a lead balloon. “D’you have fun with the other kids?”
- frightened out of his mind. So be gentle with him, OK?” His hand landed on Tony’s shoulder as he turned away.
Steve looked back up at him with those same blue eyes and smiled.
The boy nodded hesitantly. “But - but the man -”
Steve hesitated, looking quickly up at Tony, then back to Lang. “Yes,” he said in a small voice. His grip on Tony tightened, as if he was afraid that might be the wrong answer.
being somewhat mangled in there. Okoye has the voice-activated release for Wanda's bracelet, and she opens it using the Xhosa for 'let go' or 'release'. My knowledge of Xhosa is limited to google translate, so if anyone has a correction, it would be very welcome.
For some reason, hearing a stranger put it like that -
Tony thought uncharitably. “Sure. Looking forward to it. Just like old times, right?”
“Sure. He’s having a lie-in, huh?” He’d been aiming for some vague note of innuendo, mostly by reflex, but judging by Rhodey’s expression he’d fallen somewhat short. “I mean -”
” he said finally, savage. “How is that - that guy tried to
He reached out and carefully took one of the little hands in his, mindful of the needle. “Hey, kid,” he whispered. “You’re doing great. I’m here, okay? I’m not going anywhere.” He looked back over his shoulder. “Did they say when they need me at the debrief?”
Rhodey chewed his lower lip. He had his hands in his lap, clenched tight enough for the skin to be grey and thin on the knuckles. “I keep saying this,” he said hollowly. “It’s nothing to do with you.”
His head fucking hurt.
The Red Knight, of course. Tony rubbed his eyes with the heel of his hand. “I told him my name,” he said. Hadn’t he? He thought he had… But with everything going on, maybe the kid had forgotten.
Tony had managed to avoid talking to, at, or near Maximoff for the most part, but… “Shouldn’t you be working on a way to turn Rogers back?” That… was a bit blunter than he’d intended. “I mean, as our only magic user, your skills may be better placed there…” he trailed off. Maximoff was looking at him, her eyes wide. “What?”
Lang shrugged, as if this settled things. “Well, then. Look, I get that this makes things a little bit more complicated for us. But…” he shrugged again, leaning back. “It’s not really our call, at this point.”
They moved into the clinic, Wilson taking up place behind Rhodey to give him a break from maneuvering the wheelchair. Tony watched them go, thinking. Hadn’t Wilson also lost a teammate previously? He seemed to recall something like that having happened. It had been in his file. Robert? Roger? Something like that.
he waiting for?” She didn’t respond. He turned to look at Romanoff. “Nat?”
he’d thought all those days ago, and it was true. There was a gulf between the child and the man that yawned ever wider with every trauma the child suffered.
He stared back at her for a long moment. “No, Agent Hill,” he said quietly, venomously, “no, I don’t need to ask that.”
Hill paused, surprised. “All right,” she said slowly. “We can do that.”
It’s not entirely selfless, that instinct. It’s not just the memory of Steve’s terror, or the echo of someone else’s voice reverberating in his chest; no, not at all. It’s also the wretched covetousness of his dreams, of the bloodied blue blanket and the uniform-clad Steve staring at him with beseeching eyes, and the lives of both in the palm of Tony’s trembling hand.
“Sort of.” He looked back at Vision, taking in the faux-human guise. “Was he really OK with you?”
Tony felt a prickling of dread crawl down his spine. Steve had been drowsy for a while; he’d woken up to meet Barton, but he’d held on to Tony the entire time, and he’d slumped pretty heavily once he’d been carried. Was he dropping off because he was finally somewhere properly warm, or… “Hey, come on now. Steve, you okay?” He tugged the blanket away. Steve’s head lolled against Tony’s shoulder, heavy-lidded and lethargic, his cheeks red and his blonde hair plastered to him with sweat. His breath came out of him in whistling little gasps, louder than it had been only a few hours ago. His lips, Tony thought, and he suddenly couldn’t breathe past the knot in his chest. His lips were tinged with blue. “Oh,
She did not seem overly bothered by it. “They are shy at that age.”
Comments are love.
Tony looked around. He’d been hoping that there would be at least a little bit of tech in here so he could get a sneak peek at the famed Wakanda great leap forward, but there wasn’t even a TV in sight. The room was neatly furnished in pale colours, with a box of colourful-looking toys propped against the far wall. The large windows overlooked the gardens below, and a fan spun lazily overhead, stirring the humid air rhythmically.
“Oh, good, something to look forward to,” Tony muttered.
name. “We’re going to stay by the beach. There are some people there who might be able to help, and I think it’ll be better for you to be back in the US.” It occurred to him, belatedly, that he hadn’t asked Steve’s input into any of this. “Would you like that?”
“I’m keeping him,” he said again, his voice steady. “Until he turns back.”
“Yeah,” Rhodey says. “Yeah, at least I can get Pepper processed.” He can’t do anything for the others. No one had seen Happy disappear. No one could find Rhodey’s family (all of them, any of them). And Tony…
Slowly, she nodded. “That could work.” Her lips quirked in what could be mistaken for a smile.
He looked at Rhodey’s retreating back.
Content warnings: mentions of child death and torture.
After a moment, Tony reached out and put his hand over Rhodey’s.
a massive formative trauma. So - not excusing, but explaining -I'd like to think that she could be given a second chance to redeem herself and fix her earlier mistakes. That said, I don't think that putting her on a combat team with zero therapy was the best approach. And I really disagreed with Tony bringing Peter to the fight, when he had every reason to expect the Winter Soldier and/or Wanda to be there.
“Wake up,”
He gaped at her. “What?”
Oh, wait. Huh. An odd feeling when his mind isn't the dirtiest one in the room. “Not
get the stone to apologies for the inconvenience afterwards. Bastard hadn’t ever met a power move he’d disliked.
Yinsen said to him, reaching into Tony’s chest once more. His hands were gentle as they nudged Tony’s heart to one side, cushioning the magnet in its new home.
“Tones, come on,” Rhodey said, his mouth twisting in a wry smile. “You know it doesn’t work like that. Honestly, I’ll be plenty happy to have a working dick back. I’m relying on you to get me walking again, but trust me, getting me anything else below the belt -” His smile suddenly dropped off. “Crap, I keep forgetting - the kid -”
Because the eyes of the teacher were on the woman, and so were the eyes of every trainee.
This did not seem to perturb Mordo as much as Barton might have wished. “Perhaps,” he said quietly. He looked back at Tony with that same open, sad look in his eyes. “Perhaps I should have asked him to choose instead. But you need to understand something: he would have made exactly the same choice.” Tony tensed at that, and Mordo shook his head in response. “Perhaps not the guards; maybe he would have taken a different approach. But the child? One life would not hold this world hostage. One life could
“Maybe we should pause here,” T’Challa broke in smoothly. “We shall consider your offer, Mr Mordo.”
Steve peered up at him, his face creasing into a determined - and familiar - frown. “I could!”
He scrubbed a hand over his face. “Did something happen?” He asked, his voice softer. “Did you hear something? Is that why?”
. I was worried he’d have to sedate him. Seemed to think you were a gonner, no matter how many times we tried to reassure him.” Barton bit his lip. “Before the med team arrived, before we could get you under, you were panicked, moving around a lot. We needed to restrain you to stop you from injuring yourself, and we couldn’t risk sedation with surgery looming. So Barnes and I were holding you down until they could get some restraints set up, and - you didn’t react well to that, or to the restraints -“ Barton’s lips were thin and white, his hand trembling as he rubbed slowly at his jaw.
Tony didn’t know this guy from Adam and wasn’t in a particular mood to be friendly. “I could do without being kept locked up like a fairy-tale princess, frankly.”
“Mhuh,” Steve agreed, sounding half-asleep.
job is to protect you.”
“Somehow I doubt that.” Tony grabbed a handful of Mordo’s tunic in his left hand, lifting him bodily, the repulsor in his right hand at full power inches from Mordo’s face. Wanda wouldn’t have let this guy go; hell,
Steve nodded. “The scary man was in my head.” He pressed a hand to his sternum, to the memory of remembered pain.
She shook her head, a small smile on her lips. “You’ll like this.” She pointed to the screen Wanda was sat in front of, which had a split-screen of the swordsman’s wrists, the bracelets still crackling with power. “Wanda?”
, he thought with a sigh. For one thing, travelling with a small child seemed to be more complex than he’d originally envisaged; for another, Barton had left him a snippy note which simply said,
(In the way that she had told him what sounded good, what sounded positive, what sounded
“...yeah.” He knew the nurses were keeping a close eye on the kid, so it wouldn’t be that they’d held back pain meds through neglect or to ration them. But, still, he’d speak to the doctor and see if there was anything else they could do. Tony was the one who’d screwed up, not getting him squared away quickly enough; the kid didn’t deserve to suffer because of it.
He managed to force himself to leave the bedroom a little while later.
Pepper’s eyes narrowed. “And, what, she’s allergic to planes? Why can’t she come to you?”
his expression seemed to say.
(He drank the damn shake. It was actually pretty good.)
He made eye-contact with Okoye, who had similarly gone absolutely still, her hand on her weapon.
“It means he has weak spots we can reach,” Barnes said from Steve’s other side.
Oh, Tony was definitely going to hell.
Wilson looked back at him, his expression stony. “Yeah,” he said finally. “You have an hour or so before we need to be there, there’s one more person who needs to be - who needs to arrive.” He looked down at the small hand in Tony’s and seemed to hesitate. “Don’t screw this up,” he muttered finally, turning on his heel to leave.
Steve, and for a moment he wasn’t sure whether he meant the child or the man, but in either case he didn’t have him, he
“I’m just sayin’, the arms are impressive. How much do you bench, d’you think? More than Barnes? I’m betting it’s more than Barnes.” Tony whistled to Barnes as he walked into the conference room. “Hey, Elsa, d’you think you can out-bench his lordship?” In Tony’s defence, he hadn’t slept since… well, it’d been a while.
Steve’s brow furrowed in thought. “Sort of. But he was also scary. He’d had lots of bad things happen, and they hurt, and they didn’t stop hurting. And then he’d also done bad things, and they didn’t stop hurting, either.” His voice dropped. “It was scary, and it
“Because we do not have any better ideas,” Maximoff said from the door.
Okoye stopped at a 4-storey tong-lau building at the apex of the intersecting Lai Chi Kok Road and Tong Mi Road. “This must be it. Lui Seng Chun building, yes?” The street outside was bustling with end of the day choppers and tired commuters, the neon signs already bright in the fading daylight. Okoye was frowning. “It does not look especially… holy.”
In his defence, he’d expected Pepper to look a little less like he’d dropped a dead mouse in her glass of wine.
the security perimeter.
Tony and Nat, aaaah, OK. So, this was one of those relationships that I really had a lot of background thinking done on, and then Tony just... kept forgiving her and regretting it. There were about six versions of that before I managed to get him to a state of treading water. And Nat... I think she gets that this might be a burned bridge too far, but she also gets how effective she is with Tony, and how hard he has to work to not just fall back into old patterns. (Old patterns of affection, I guess, rather than necessarily trust - because I don't quite see trust there, although I do see affection and respect.) And she's pushing him a little, and he can see it and isn't keen on it. I think he trusts Clint more because Barton is a little less good at what he does, a little more exposed.
With each word, Barnes’s expression crumpled a little more.
that Tony said, staring up at him, betrayed. Blood spilled down from his mouth.
His eyes slid to her and away again, taking in the tension in her frame. She clearly hadn’t entirely bought his show of acquiescence, if the tightness around her eyes was anything to go by. Well, he hadn’t held back, had he? He’d gone in for the jugular himself, both times.
That… that had not been what he had expected. Rage, regret, maybe even guilt - sure. He had his own fair share of those. But this…
Vision volunteered to re-review all the available data alongside Barton and see if there was anything that could be drawn out that wasn’t immediately apparent on their first pass.
Barnes didn’t even look at him.
“Yeah. Wasn’t pretty. Barnes - he didn’t have too good a time of it, either. I think whatever it is Steve said to him really upset him.”
“I’m fairly sure she’s part of the king’s bodyguard,” Tony said absently. Not that Tony minded having someone nearby who could put Barnes down, by any means. The suit was a silent statue in the corner, and although he wore his repulsor watch, it would be a poor defence if Barnes were to snap and go after the kid. No, better to have someone here purely for defence. “Are you sure you should be doing that?” Even from this vantage point he could tell that Rhodey’s positioning was putting a lot of pressure on his lower back. Why would he do something like that?
“‘m not frightened,” Steve said in a small voice, his entire face against Tony’s thigh.
Steve stared at him, calculating. “Like a knight?”
“Rhodey, Christ. It’s good to talk to you.”
Not something that Tony had encountered before. Unless he wasn’t just conscious, of course.
Tony thought, and his chest ached again.
He was in the hospital. His arms ached from where he’d fallen asleep on them by Steve’s bedside, still clad in his glamorous open-backed hospital gown. No one must have checked on Steve during Tony’s nap, or they would woken him, surely. And Steve -
He wondered if his choice to leave Mordo and the others back at the jet was overly cautious. But - no, no, it was the correct decision. If the Hong Kong temple was just as fanatical as Mordo was (and what temple did
“Why,” Tony said slowly, each word carefully enunciated, “are you irradiating Steve’s blood with gamma rays?”
Prompt ideas are not only allowed and accepted, they are
“Tony, you’re scaring him,” Steve tried again. He tugged on Tony’s shoulder, and thankfully, Tony backed off willingly.

amazing.” Tony was excited all over again thinking about it. “How does it work, with the fact that the TARDIS is one particular size, and the inside is filled with so many things? It should be scientifically impossible.”
“Please,” Tony whispered. He turned the paper around, nearly ripping it in his haste, looking at the picture again. “Don’t lie to me. This is worse than when you stuck a shield in my chest. You walked away from me.”
Tony opened his mouth to respond when the door to his bedroom flew open so hard that it embedded itself into the opposite wall.
“Take a break,” Nebula suggested. Rustling suggested that she sat in front of him.
Did you just like your own tweet? SMH This guy’s a total yolk.
Tony resumed stroking his wings, and Steve sighed happily, burrowing deeper under the covers.
The squirrel is now trying to steal my man. Steve, stop feeding the squirrel! OMG, I swear, don’t give it junk food; it’s bad for them! Also, think of the diseases it could carry.
There he was, running towards him at full speed, sheer relief in his eyes, and Tony pulled away from Nebula to stumble towards Steve. Steve held him up in waiting arms.
Tony sighed in relief when the blast of hot air from within greeted him when he opened the door.
“I have no idea,” Steve admitted, cradling his tiny counterpart carefully in his hands. “We really need to figure out how the got my DNA and Tony’s as well.”
Spoiler alert - It’s food poisoning
Steve bought a bottle of bleach from the pharmacy. Two bottles (perhaps a third, if he was truly honest with himself), taking them home in the reusable bag that the cashier had somehow sold to him after she mentioned “saving the environment!”
“My room,” Tony said, guiding Steve to his bed. He gently pushed him down until Steve was laying freely on top of the bed covers. “I can’t wait to ravish you here. You’re so gorgeous baby. You’re always gorgeous, but you look especially gorgeous now. Your wings even, spread so gorgeously.”
. It was a quick inhale, merging on a sob, and…
I sold myself out to Steve. His smiles are to d i e for. The donuts are just a bonus.

“He’s going to shoot you!”
Steve takes one look at Tony and promptly bursts out laughing.
Tony pushed him back. “Oh my God, DUM-E! You need to charge, you idiot! Next time you move off your charging station before you’re fully charged, I will donate you to the labs, and see if you like that!”
Oh come on!
“Hey, I needed a break too, and if you weren’t here, I would have probably been in my workshop all day working on projects instead.” Tony looked at Stevens. “You’re actually doing me a favor too.”
Steve gathered up the bleached feathers, and the tears leaked out of the corners of his eyes.
He thought back to it. A dream, no confirmation of which Tony was alive or dead. Yet, Steve felt like he wasn’t dead; he was alive and out there, somewhere. And perhaps his dream wasn’t just a dream.
Bucky was off in the war, and he was still back in stateside, finally getting his opportunity to do one good deed. The only thing that kept him going and not give up was the timer on his chest. He stood there beside all the manly men, buff and strong, while he himself was weak. He was going to do this, no matter what. He everything to gain when he came here.
An omega on the run was bad - it spurred an alpha’s instincts to chase after him. But staying there was worse because then he would be dead meat. He ran across the desert despite the fact that his equilibrium was all shot to hell; at least he had a fighting chance when he ran, however small that chance was. He couldn’t stop; he wouldn’t stop, but he chanced a look back at the many wolves that chased him. Those eyes were all but red. Tony put on a burst of speed, running even faster to get away from them. But so focused on what was behind him, he failed to see the threat in front of him until he tripped and landed over it. Then, he sprawled ungainly on the hot sand, panting hard. Time slowed down as he turned his head towards the pack of Alpha wolves closing ground. It seemed inevitable, with the fact that he was an Omega wolf, being chased by Alphas, that nothing good would come after. Resigned, his eyes slipped down.
Because when Tony looked back at Steve with grudging admiration, telling him that “Dad loved you and spent nearly his entire looking for you. And I loved you as a hero, but I hated you as a person because you took my dad,” Steve could understand a little bit of where he came from, but also -
They looked past each other, not exactly meeting eye to eye, but just off to the side in silence, sitting there on the mat as the sweat cooled on their body. There was no way they could believe that; they couldn’t move on, no matter how many times Nat tried to convince themselves that it was the best solution. It was fooling no one.
Perhaps…perhaps these dreams
Yinsen gave him a sad look. “With the way the Alphas are looking at you? It is perhaps a good sign indeed.”
“Hi Tony,” Steve said. He was sure he had a silly smile on his face. He was so very fucked, he couldn’t deny it. He needed to stay away from Tony, but he couldn’t help but reach out. “I brought cookies.”
“You never answered my question, guys,” Steve groaned, sitting up. “Why were you looking at me that way?”
If Steve was a little nicer, he would have excused them to retreat to his room. It was overwhelming to meet someone new, and Steve
Natasha smacked him, drawing a yelp from Clint’s lip. Steve laughed when Clint reached up to rub the back of his head. “Of course he did. Look at him, he has a backpack of his stuff.”
“You’re so messy,” Steve said fondly, curling his hands around his waist. A little harder, and Tony was sure that his skin would bruise, marking him being owned by the most amazing man. “I love you like this.”
Steve shook his head. “I—”
A small shrug, a frown. “I don’t know,” Yinsen said lowly, honestly.
“It’s probably your own fault,” Bucky replies as he walks past him, padding after Natasha. Peter and MJ has not slipped down like before when the dogs (and cat) prepared to leave, and they don't seem inclined to leave their positions either.
“Dunno,” Tony said. “Can we just get this done and over with because I had plans.”
“But, it’s all gone now.”
Tony moaned around the first bite, closing his eyes for a moment to savor the taste. The flavors of onions and garlic burst into his mouth, mellowed by the taste of tomato and basil. And when he opened his eyes again, he could see a faint dusting of pink that graced Stevens’s cheek.
Robotically, he shrugged off his coat and sweater, walking briskly through the bedroom and into the bathroom, chasing the warmth that a shower promised.
Although Stevens looked like he knew something that Tony didn’t, he didn’t elaborate further. Tony wanted to ask, wanted to push, but all of that fell away when Stevens looked at him heatedly, eyes piercing him and took his breath away. Their faces were merely inches away from each other. It was like fate was pulling them together, and Tony was helpless under its whims. But he didn’t care; he wanted this, wanted to be closer to this interesting, unique man and learn more about him. He didn’t care that Stevens was a man out of time; he wanted to understand everything.
The feathers were not silky soft like regular feathers, but Tony’s metal feathers were so...Tony, and they were so very special and unique. As Steve traced his fingers down them, the feather clinked softly together like wind chimes.
instead because you are an utterly useless robot who can’t stay on his wheels.”
Once was a happenstance, twice was a coincidence. He didn’t need a third, because with them came destruction. And if one Arnim Zola was
not a playground, and this isn’t even the subject I’m studying! What did I do to deserve to be the TA for lab?”
“Whenever you’re ready to go,” Tony said.
That is his whole world now.
The scientists looked at him like deer in headlights, frozen in their places for two beats. Steve gave a heavy sigh, unbuckling his shield from his arm. The scientists chose to flee. Good choice. Steve tapped his earpiece as the last scientist passed him. “Hawkeye, the scientists are heading out.”

Tony matched his smile. He still hurt, what with the way the past two years had treated him, but there was also a sense of blooming sense of hope that grew within his chest. He breathed back, “Hey Steve.”
His body burned when he woke up, the agony so vicious that he couldn’t even scream. He couldn’t breathe, and he couldn’t curl up to roll away from the pain. Tony wanted to die with the way that the fire encompassed him, but there was a slight breeze that washed over him before a cold, damp towel pressed against his forehead. Tony forced his eyes to open into slits. There was a blob in the shape of a human hovering over him, but in the dim light and his blurry vision, he couldn’t make much out.
But the miniaturized arc reactor was done, glowing a soft blue in the dim cave, and he smiled. He did it. Yinsen helped him put the arc reactor in his chest, eyes concentrated and hands steady, turning the thing with a “click.”
“If you can figure out how to stop shedding DNA around the world Steve, then we wouldn’t have to worry about this. In the meantime, however, all we can do is take down HYDRA as they come up and hope that they haven’t figured out how to weaponize any blood you’ve spilled during our fights.”
And then he leaned forward again to say lowly in his ear, “And when we’re done with this lesson, I’m going to take care of that, as many times as you can take it, reward you for taking this first step.”
Finally, Tony turned to look at him and raised an eyebrow when he saw Rhodey already dressed in his ROTC workout clothes. “Early morning workout?”
Then the man dropped his hand from the surface of the TARDIS and stepped away. “Good luck getting in. She likes you, but she also likes having fun. Try asking her, it’s as simple as that.”
“Bits and pieces.” Tony frowned. “I think there was a ransom video at some point, but I’m not sure. Everything is very foggy.”
Rhodey groaned in exasperation, throwing his hands up in the air. “Tony! Are you kidding me?”
“While you guys were here smooching your faces off, we did cleanup,” Natasha said. Steve and Tony drew back, blushing before they turned to look at her. She smirked. “You’re welcome.”
With a sigh, Tony formed the chestplate into its proper shape. It would protect him from most arms when they made their escape. The armor was crude, basic, plain, but it would work for the job. With a sigh, arms aching more than it should, Tony put down the hammer and dipped the chestplate into the barrel of cold water. It was the final piece to his armor.
Steve stood in the open doorway, face flushed and breathing labored, as if he ran all the way home from the event. His tux was wrinkled, his face slightly sweaty, but Tony had never seen anyone hotter than him, at that moment. Steve brandished his phone. "This. True? Are you too drunk to know what you're saying?"
how about a picnic in bed?
“Fuck.” Tony flopped back ungracefully, bouncing on his pillow and throwing his arm over his eyes.
Stevens ten feet behind, staring through the window of Deborah’s cafe, eyes wide and face pale.
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL
Tony took a seat across from Stevens and Rhodey sat beside him. “Give up Stevens. Deborah always does this.”
“Of course,” Steve vows, eagerly licking along his back again. But they both know better: Tony loves to be groomed by Steve once he gets used to the wet dog drool, and Steve loves spending time with the squirrel whenever work doesn’t get in the way. And Steve had been out for nearly four days, so this is a cherished quiet moment for them. They sit on the grass under the tree, everything falling into the wayside as Steve cares for him and protects him. He doesn’t need all of this, but it’s nice to be taken care of once in a while.
Tony swallowed. “All I subsist on is Deborah’s meals and coffee. This is so delicious!”
I need your guy’s help: cook at home or take him to a restaurant?
Tony slithered down, unbuttoning Steve’s pants and taking his pants and his underwear off in one smooth motion. Steve canted his hips up to make the slide easier. With his cock freed, it slapped up against belly, dripping copious pre-come. It was so hard and red, and Tony leaned down to press a kiss upon the underside of his cock. Steve whined, bucking his hips slightly when Tony licked a heated stripe from his balls to the tip, licking up the precome that had dribbled onto his stomach.
Stop being dramatic Tony.
Steve was unsurprised to find that Tony slept like an octopus when he woke several hours later completely wrapped up in the limbs of his favorite genius.
...apparently, he looked into creating a non profit to raise awareness for early onset hair loss once
Steve finally noticed that his breaths were harsh and loud in the dead silence, a silence that is similar to the one in his dream. He couldn’t take this. Tony had never ripped him apart in his dreams so viciously in his dreams. Those words…they were new, and Steve had never imagined the situation that way.
, he thought, but Tony was grinning anyway. That was a resounding success. “Love you too, honeybunches!” he called through the door.
Tony wasn't surprised to see the broken sadness on his friends’ faces. They again hugged him and if they felt him trembling in their arms, they were nice enough to let him cry it all out, instead of consoling him and saying 'it would all be alright in the end' because even they couldn't promise that.
Steve had grown out a beard and his hair was long! Tony thanked God's above for his immense self-control.
The villain seemed to be a mutant, some unidentified powers, which he could protect himself with mostly, not for attack tactics necessarily. His army wasn’t strong, it was a large army however and the monsters were big, the collateral damage was devastating. The evacuation of civilians went fine until Cap and Widow heard cries coming from another building. It came from a dingy flat and apparently several families were stuck in the building. Cap had barked orders out, they had to distract the army from coming closer to the building, it was already unstable. Iron Man went in together with Cap. Apparently it wasn’t people in the building, the villain had somehow found a way to produce sound coming from the building and the villain let more of the army come down to overwhelm the Avengers in the field, so two flying objects, reminding Tony off the Chitauri army, came at the building and it collapsed on them before they could even think about an escape route. They were both knocked immediately. Iron Man woke up first because of Widow and War Machine screaming through their comms. A huge headache was coming on and his legs felt trapped under a beam. The suit protected him from breaking anything, not from bruises and sprains, however. Tony could not locate his boyfriend immediately, Jarvis identified a body laying 9 feet away from him though.
'We care about you and your health and happiness Tony, please talk to us?'
“I don’t think I will. I know that Steve is still here and I know how to handle nightmares when they come back. I might try to find something like how to reduce stress and exercise to relax, like PT. That might help both of us, I hope. And Steve needs his sports to calm down so he needs to find new ways to do that, at least stuff like boxing I mean.” Tony rambled a little incoherently.
After their dinner, they went up to the penthouse, showered together, Tony helped Steve change the compression dressing for his arm, pulled clean shirts on and went to lay in bed. While softly kissing, Tony told about his day. Occasionally Steve tensed up with a new wave of pain coursing through him, Tony comforted as best as he could and eventually they had fallen asleep. Tony thinking about a possible service dog, a prosthetic arm and that he needed to speak to Bruce about making the phantom pain manageable.
'Let's get some drinks!' Bucky pulled away from Sam, shot him a bright smile and grabbed Steve's jacket and walked straight to the bar. He ordered their favourite drinks. Steve and Bucky couldn't get drunk so they got mocktails and Sam got a simple coca cola with Bacardi in it.
Tony had felt bad about it until Pepper had pulled him along to the two meetings. They had eaten lunch together in his office, Pepper trying her hardest to distract him from thinking about Steve. She had gone to the bathroom and when she returned pulled him out of his stupor when the door closed a little harsh.
'I don't know what to tell you. I had to step up as a leader for the new group, while I didn't want to. I want to not be in the public eye for once and not have people getting suspicious of it, but that's just not going to happen, is it? I lost the majority of my friends and people want me to confidently lead this group I barely know. I just… I hoped with this new armour… maybe it's just really naive, but I just wanted to try to get rid of all this attention, focus and harsh criticism. I can't keep people around, except for you two and lord knows why you are still here, and everything I do just gets torn down, despite meaning it well. I just-... I just can't anymore! I just want to disappear for a while and I don't know, do something which feels good you know? I want to feel like that first time I flew in my armour, Mark ll.'
Tony took the lead for several minutes, dancing the easier version of the waltz. Tony’s eyes were sparkling with joy and Steve had never felt this right at a gala ever. All their friends were there, they were celebrating a successful battle and everyone was enjoying themselves!
“Come on Steve, you’re crushing your boyfriend and you need to breathe as well. Come on, let go for a minute.” Bucky had pulled softly, trying to avoid actually hurting him even more.
It had all went pear-shaped pretty fast. A megalomaniac villain wanted to take revenge, he said he had connections to Hydra. Captain America, Falcon, Winter Soldier and Black Widow had teamed up to take out the villain, while Iron Man, War Machine, Thor and Wanda had teamed up to take out his dodgy army. Bruce had stayed behind, which he did not mind at all.
“I am not going anywhere without you, come, let’s go lay on the couch for a minute sweetheart.”
‐-----------------
"Come on, wash up a little!"
“What happened?”
Tony repeated his order to the barman and ordered a Tom Collins for himself.
Steve understood for the first time, Steve could see why Tony had always been so self-sacrificing. He understood that when something hurts so bad, that the only relief could be dying, and if it was even considered a 'heroic death' well…
Tony had cried until he had passed out from exhaustion. Rhodey had woken him up for dinner and then had gone straight back to sleep. The next morning, Thursday, Sam had entered his room, after breakfast, and told him Steve was asking for him. Tony had freshened up because Nat had threatened him and pulled on new clothes before he had gone to see his boyfriend. Bucky and Rhodey were the only ones with them in the room. Steve was still sickly pale and had been writhing from the pain, his jaw painfully clenched. Tony had rushed to his bedside and climbed into the bed on his left side. Steve had smushed his face into Tony’s chest and sobbed his heart out, the bed was nearly shaking from it. Steve had mumbled Tony’s name over and over while Tony reassured him he wouldn’t be going anywhere and trying to let the younger man relax a little because he was squeezing him so tight it was bruising his ribs. Bucky had intervened after five minutes because he wouldn’t let up.
"You know, I think the team was conspiring this plan to get us to talk and I think they'll be celebrating it."
“What? Why would I do that? No, of course not, I’m completely serious!” Steve sputtered bewildered.
'Close your mouth Steve or you'll catch flies.' Tony said while sauntering over to him. Tony took off his glasses and smiled up at Steve.
Tony woke up with an immense headache, a great way to start the day. Today was the long-awaited day. He felt a panic attack lingering, he hadn't minded his anxiety medication ever since he heard about The Rogues wanting to return. It all felt wrong but he refused to show how much it scared him. Repairing broken relationships was not one of his talents. Steve, Natasha, Clint, Sam, Wanda, Scott and Bucky all signed the Accords. T'Challa and Tony had had many calls discussing the amendments demanded by The Rogues and now 5 months later, they would move into the Compound in up-state New York. He had five hours to entertain himself and try to avoid spiralling. Rhodey, Pepper and Peter were at the Compound for that exact reason. It was a Saturday so he could tinker around with Rhodey and Peter in the shop, work on the Spiderman suit and Rhodey's War Machine armour, a dark blue version with better cushioning and support for his lower half.
And so on, they went back to how they were together before it all fell apart. Steve washed up while Tony not-so-secretly admired the well-sculpted abs, back muscles, arms and legs. All over he just looked strong and steady and it was rendering Tony speechless. He quickly retrieved the bullet from Steve's left calve, stitched it up and swaddled it.
Before Yinsen could say another word, the gun fired, sending a bullet towards them. It embedded into the ceiling, sending dust down on their heads. The Alpha fled, and as soon as he disappeared, “Lousy shot,” Tony said after a beat.
Tony paused, looked up, and thought, eyes twitching as he pulled pieces of information from his mind like fractured pieces of a puzzle. “I think,” Tony said slowly, “that all technology may not have been created, the fact that we are still learning things about the world, et cetera.”
Clint cheered. “Avengers sleepover party!”
“I’m not good enough for you,” Steve whispered, feeling his back twinge with agony at the prospect.

, can you work on that?”
“Oh my god, Tony,” Steve said, leaning back against the titled shower. “Your mouth, it was like it was made for this.” Steve brushed his hand against Tony’s cheek as he sucked, hollowing out and licking the underside before he let his cock drop out of his mouth and nuzzled it.

Tony, no
Tony shook his head.
Rhodey laughed. “Whatever you say, Tones, whatever you say. I know that most of them like you and the way that you’re patient with them during office hours. You’re a better prof than Dr. Smith anyway.”
For years, Steve had been careful in keeping his wings strapped tightly to his back and hidden away from curious and prying eyes, but even the most careful consideration could still trip up when a single black feather shed without him noticing.
was also their only ticket to ride away from here, so Tony stamped down his emotions and trawled after Nebula, walking up the ramp into the ship. Already she had almost disappeared, her feet taking her up into another level of the ship. Tony followed her into the cockpit, and he took a seat in the back row. Normally, he would fight for the pilot’s seat, but now he simply watched her manipulate the controls, starting the ship and taking them away from Titan.
But for now, Steve fell over the edge as Tony pressed against the place that made lights spark behind his eyes. It was entirely too much for him, and he shook, flying, flying, flying.
There was a blue police box in the middle of Killian Court.
Why couldn’t Tony see that?
That guy from last week still hasn’t messaged me back
Steve nodded. The skin on his knuckles were no longer broken, and he still could use some more release. “Let me wash my hands first.”
His head was pounding as he stepped out into the desert sun, squinting despite the sunglasses that shaded his eyes. Still, a hangover never stopped him from accomplishing what he needed to do, and his task was, in Obie's terms, wow the brass. He couldn't disobey that order even though he was on the opposite side of the world. He stretched out his arms dramatically. "I present to you," he announced, grinning with his media winning smile, "the Jericho." It was his best work to date; he was proud of it because it would end the war faster, bring Rhodey home sooner. For just a time, he could avoid thinking about Obie because he was with his best friend instead, and a work of art he was proud of. Tony's hair was windswept from the presentation; it was a heady, powerful feeling to show it off.
“You’re so good,” Steve said at last, sliding down the wall and gathering Tony into his arms. They sat there for a moment, letting the water continue to wipe their sex escapades away, and Tony grinned happily. He loved this - he’d never get tired of this. And as his body settled more heavily, coming down from the heat of their throes of passion, Steve turned off the water and bundled him off in his soft fluffy towel.
He couldn’t comprehend. Even though he wasn’t thinking clearly, or even at all, there was some instinct to fight against the bonds that held him down, to breathe through the fire. He inhaled the flames and screamed, like a wounded animal falling to its basest defensive instincts. There was no escape, and he was too weak to break the bonds that held him down.
The next three days went by in a haze. They felt like the longest days Steve ever experienced. Not even marching into a war felt remotely like what he was feeling. In the war he didn’t know what to expect exactly at least. Right now it was rather like coming home from war. Not knowing what to feel, too many or just no feelings at all, like not belonging.
“Hmm.. you might have a point there. Again. So, an Army thing, huh?”
“I think this is getting too far,” Steve told him.
“I’m so sorry, Tony. I wish..”
“You’re pretty blind for being called Hawkeye, you know?” Natasha chuckled.
Closing his mask, Tony grabbed Steve by the waist and before anyone knew what was happening they hovered over the street. “Sorry, guys. We’re outta here,” Tony announced before he flew off, taking Steve with him.
“Yeah, still.. That’s just so.. I don’t know.” By far, this wasn’t the first strange answer they had heard on that show, but it still confused, yet still amused, Tony to no end.
Tony pretended to be offended, until he probably realised that this meant he wouldn’t need to make excuses to not go to the museum anymore and then smiled at Steve, who just chuckled.
And then there was the sadness. The sadness even overshadowed the hurt. Steve had really thought he’d reasoned out the whole thing, but the truth was far from that. His plan had sounded so simple, no matter how hard it was to go through with it. Walk up to Tony, tell him about his feelings for him, get a response, walk away and continue with everything like usual. There hadn’t even been different options for various reactions he could get from Tony. If he would’ve told him he liked him, they would’ve figured it out. If he would’ve told him he didn’t have feelings, they would carry on being good friends. Simple as that, at least that’s what Steve thought. Even though it had crossed his mind, he kind of ignored the possibility of completely destroying their friendship.
Steve paused for a moment, staring into space. And finally he understood. Tony. He hadn’t described his type, he described Tony. And that's exactly why he didn’t think of Lincoln as perfect. Because he thought of Tony as perfect.
The movement caused them to break apart for a moment, but Steve instantly brought their lips together again. Tony raised his hands to Steve’s lapel, trying to push the jacket down his shoulders, but Steve suddenly stopped him by putting a hand on Tony’s chest, gently pushing him away. “Tony, wait.” He kissed him briefly as if to comfort him. “I just.. I can’t do this if we’ll go our separate ways tomorrow. I’m not that kind of guy.. I’ve had feelings for you for quite some time and I need to make sure that this is not a one-time thing for you. Otherwise I’d rather leave now.”
Anyway, cancelling wasn’t an option with Natasha and he really wanted to see something else than his work, his bed or the inside of his coffee mug. So he made his way to one of their favorite little restaurants a few minutes down the street.
He heard Steve laugh just as much as he felt it the way his upper body moved with the sound. “Of course I did, I’m Captain America!”
“We were supposed to go on a date when I..” “Oh shit, Steve. I’m sorry,” Bucky immediately interrupted him. “I wouldn’t have called if I had known.”
With deep breaths Tony enjoyed the aftermaths of his orgasm, but promptly reached for Steve, grabbing at his shoulder. Apparently he understood, because he crawled up until he was laying next to Tony who turned on his side, snuggling up against Steve.
“Sorry, I.. yeah, I’m fine. It’s just.. I actually came down to talk to you,” Steve stuttered.
Steve’s voice was almost pleading, that didn’t sound too good.
But the other reason why he shouldn’t have done that was that now Tony knew what Steve’s ass felt like under his hand. And damn it was buff. Even before he tensed, probably in surprise, Tony could feel the defined muscles. If he hadn’t been surprised by his own action and therefore withdrawn his hand pretty fast, he probably would’ve never let go, because the feeling of touching Steve was just too good.
"Yeah, right. And as friends we trust each other and.."
Looking down at the blanket Tony was standing on, Steve tilted his head in question, asking, “what is this?”
“I’m hoping that’s bringing the tiptoeing to an end?” Tony had asked sheepishly.
But he didn’t seem to be sportive either, so Tony told him about the conversation he overheard. “And you know, I just thought if they want rumors, we should give them something to talk about. Hence me calling you ‘Sweet Pea’.”
Tony had to suppress a laughter, the mental image of Captain America being intimidated enough to hide in a bathroom stall was too much.
But when he was about to turn around Tony grabbed his arm. He stopped and saw the pleading look in Tony’s eyes. “Steve, please.”
Tony had caught him by surprise and of course he could have easily withstood him, but Steve couldn’t help admire his strength. Sometimes he just forgot how strong Tony actually was. Mostly because of his smaller frame and because compared to Steve every human was rather weak. But what strength he might lack he made up for in keenness. Which was pretty hot, actually.
Tony wasn’t sure if this was the good kind of being pushed inside an abandoned room or the bad kind.
“So far you did everything right,” he reassured him with a bright smile. “Seriously. Thank you for doing this, Tony. It’s very considerate, but to be honest, all I care about right now is that we’re
Steve laughed but got up and put on his sweatpants. When he picked up his t-shirt from the floor, Tony cleared his throat and shook his head when Steve looked at him. “Uh uh, you don’t need that.”
“Tony.. What.. Hey,” he stuttered. So much for looking unsuspicious.
“You should do that. Come on, I’ll escort you to the elevator,” Steve offered with a little chuckle, making Tony laugh as well and made his way to the door.
Steve’s initial smile faltered when he realised that Tony taking the cup didn’t mean he would pause his work and he sighed. “Aren’t you hungry? How long since the last time you ate?”
Shifting in his seat Steve leaned forward, bracing his elbows on his knees. “Look, Tony. Try not to interrupt me, okay? I just wanna get this off my chest, even though it doesn’t have to mean anything.”
Steve let his fingertips ghost over Tony’s upper body before another trail of kisses followed until they were on eye level. Bracing his arms next to Tony’s head, he lowered his head, bringing their lips together once more.
Thankfully Lincoln didn’t seem to be angry or anything, he smiled at Steve, patting him on the shoulder. “Well, good luck then. Go get him. And thank you for being honest. ”
“Fuck,” was Tony’s immidiate answer.
It took Tony two days without any real sleep and with more or less non stop thinking about their phone call, until he was able to decide what to do. At first he didn’t even know if he was happy about the outcome, he was too baffled that Steve had really confirmed that he meant what Tony had read in between the lines. Then Tony wanted nothing more than to see Steve and talk it all out, but his anger returned just as fast as it was briefly forgotten. Why did Tony always feel at least twice as much as usual when Steve was involved?
They were watching yet another Disney movie. Everyone kept complaining whenever it was Clint’s turn, because he always picked Disney movies, but Steve knew that they secretly loved them just as much as he did. His favorite so far had been Beauty and the Beast and it was unlikely that any of his choices could change that, but Frozen wasn’t too bad thus far. Other than them being good movies, Steve took advantage of the circumstance that they didn’t need his full attention. Instead of concentrating on Anne, Kristof and Sven searching for Else, he repeatedly took a peak at Tony who was sitting next to him on the couch. Whenever his lips curled into a soft smile or he chuckled at something, Steve had to force himself to look away, the urge to lean over and just kiss Tony too strong. Which was the exact reason why he needed to talk to Tony, but made it even harder.
Tony is sleeping, Extremis is still coursing through his veins, but he can't access it - he doesn't have any ability to get any form of electronics in this room. He's essentially blind, locked out to the rest of the world, and he's going mad with the fact that he can't do anything about it. People get hurt when Tony is left to his own devices, so he takes it, even though he doesn't want to.
Steve’s heart shattered to pieces when Tony stared back at him, eyes filled with betrayal. Steve took a hasty step back, mouth already forming to apologize.
In some dreams, Tony’s skull was crushed against the cold concrete wall, and Tony could only watch as Steve chose Bucky, cradling his friend’s broken body while Tony slid down ungracefully, smearing a trail of blood in its wake as he slumped downwards and hemorrhaged to death. As his eyes glazed over, the shield from Steve’s hand carelessly, rolling at its side before it stilled besides the broken armor.
He failed Bucky once; he wasn’t going to fail Tony.
(Tony doesn’t mind, not really.)
(✿◠ᴗ•)八(•ᴗ•❤)
“You can have one,” he graciously offered, grinning back as he took out the cookies out from the oven and moved them to a cooling rack, where there were at least four dozen other cookies sitting out to cool.
The sounds of fighting were much closer now, shaking the cave. Tony and the Alpha looked out past the prison doors. Tony couldn’t see anything, but the way the Alpha tensed up beside him told him that the fighting wasn’t going well. The Alpha turned back to him, bloodlust in his eyes, and he struck much too fast for even Tony’s heightened senses could register.
You’re just jealous you came runner up, but I guess you’re used to coming second place to a superior genius.
did that to Tony, made him afraid of
“Less talking, more doing,” Steve replied, tangling his fingers between Tony’s digits. Then he untangled them and ripped his shirt, buttons flying to the floor and the pants following after it. And Tony couldn’t help but look down at Steve’s flexing abs, rippling as he hurriedly stripped; even though he’d seen them before, it never failed to take his breath away to see how strong Steve was.
The adrenaline high dissipated into thin air as they continued to climb higher into space and Tony’s eyes closed involuntarily, unwillingly, his body succumbing to his tiredness.
“Is that why you’re hiding from me?” Tony asked. “Because you thought you couldn’t be loved because of a superstition?”
The feeling of the bag pressed against his knuckles loosened the jittery feelings within his chest, and his muscles relaxed, finding solace in a familiar motion. Thoughts of his dream faded away like an ocean breeze, and he focused on the flow of the swinging bag, jabbing on one side, then on the other. Huffs were interspersed between hits and sweat dripped down his forehead. It was a good way to release the stress of the past several days.

“Copy that.”
Tony stroked his naked back again, “I know.”
With all this downtime, he could draw, and he drew anything that caught his eye. Sometimes it was the cat that judged him from the balcony, sometimes it was the Stark Tower in the distance as he sat in the cafe.

“And you can sure believe that I’m going to tell you that your wings are the most beautiful things I have ever seen,” Tony said. “And I’m going to tell you that as many times as you need to hear it to believe it.”
over yours truly. Do you remember when
“I don’t care. You should have left me to die.” Steve looked down at his freed wings. “And you took away my brace.”
he didn’t say.
“I know Steve, I know.”
Steve stared at the holograms as if they would hold the answers to his problems. It was worse than he thought. Countries would topple entirely with the lack of stable infrastructure, if they hadn’t already.
Steve nodded. “I didn’t think of it like that.”
Tony turned around and pointed behind him. “Do you see the missing feathers back there?” he asked.
, Buck. They’re not days, which means that it could be anywhere from three thousand weeks or months or – “ he shuddered – “it couldn’t be possibly years. But no matter what, I don’t even know if I would even live that long.”
“I’ll be in my workshop if you need me,” Tony said, sighing.
When Clint’s back was turned, Steve snatched a handful of cookies from the cooling rack before squirreling out of the kitchen.
Steve was bigger, stronger, healthier when the chamber opened, and he opened his eyes, awed by the clarity of everything.
“Oh, is that why you chased Bucky down all these years? Because you live in the present? Grow a pair, Rogers. You’re stuck chasing the past, and you know it– “
“Open your eyes Steve,” Tony said. Tony carded his fingers through Steve’s hair, and it was a comforting feeling.
“Okay, sweetheart,” Tony said, and there was a deeper pressure in his ass where Tony was fucking him with two fingers, and Steve moaned through his tears. He felt full as Tony stretched his ass, and his entire being felt raw as his tears continued to leak out of his eyes.
Steve looked at himself in the mirror one last time, stroking them smooth. He preened. The ache had slowly dissipated once Steve had finished molting, and all that was left was the slightly sensitive sensation that rippled down his spine when he touched them.
Hottie: Did I well I definitely meant cow. Yup cows for sure
“But, he’s...she’s…” Stevens stared, stunned. “That’s...not possible.”
“Well, Parker’s puppy dog eyes are working hard,” Carol snorted beside Steve. “I’m going to find us another drink. Captain, you good here?” At Steve’s nod, she wandered off, pressing a kiss to Tony’s cheek before moving without a backwards glance.
, Steve wondered, settling into a fighting stance. The woman had a uniform on: she wore a red and blue suit with a gold star adorning the center of her chest, her posture was confident, and her hair still billowed slightly from her unheard and unseen entrance.
“Tony!” Steve smiled broadly as Tony approached. “I think we’re having a great night.”
"I know you're not sleeping," Steve whispers in his ear.
“We’re coming up into an era where heroes are needed. I’m putting together a team of extraordinary people…”

“It can’t be me can it?” Tony winked playfully.
drift home at a snail’s pace. Tony settled in front of the monitor.
He may have not spoken their language, but they knew exactly what he meant.
Perhaps, in time, Steve could believe it.
Tony’s fur puffs up where it isn’t plastered down with dog drool. “Stop it! I can groom myself!”
The computer pinged, signalling its completed upload.
“Who’s the one with language problems now?” Tony asked, voice teasing and light. Steve didn’t rise to the bait, choosing instead to cautiously walk towards the desk.
“Thanks for the clarification, sweetheart, it’s nice to hear,” Steve whispered, and Tony swore he heard Steve’s voice catch as though over tears.
Rhodeybear! BETRAYAL.
Tony wasn’t sure that the Alpha wouldn’t pull the trigger.
They lost – they couldn’t protect what they sworn to protect. In an instant, millions of people died because of a force greater than what the Avengers could handle; they’d lost friends and teammates because they couldn’t keep their promise. The ashes lifted into the blowing breeze, leaving only dead silence in its wake. The grief hadn’t settled in yet, but in time, it would, and Earth would grieve for all the people she lost.
“That’s definitely a way to reveal something,” Nat murmured, and Steve laughed wetly.
made from metal. It didn’t stop him from loving the absolute artistry of those wings.)
Tony closed his eyes, inhaling Steve’s musk, ducking under to mouth Steve’s balls. “Fuck,” Steve groaned, gripping onto Tony’s hair. It was painfully tight, but he needed it. Tony moaned in return, mouth wide around the balls, sucking and massaging them. “I’m going to come. I’m going to come on your face, Tony.”
because he wasn’t pack, Tony couldn’t deny that his panic only simmered instead of consumed him. Tony swallowed, but he let the man place his hand gently back to his side. “What’s wrong with me?” he asked finally.
“The President and the Vice President are both gone. The Secretary of State had taken over.”
Steve moaned, making small aborted thrusts as he rubbed his cock against Tony’s leg.
, Tony. I couldn’t just leave him behind; he was my best friend and he was a victim here!”
Steve thought he was beautiful.
“Tony," Tony said. “I think, after all that we’ve fought together, we should be on a first name basis.”
“Fuck, you’re so delicious sweetheart,” Tony praised. “I’ll never be able to get enough of you now that I’ve tasted you.”
as he got up and stretched, snatching his sadly empty mug from his desk. He followed the aroma of freshly-brewed coffee once he exited his workshop, and he grinned tiredly.
“They’re beautiful,” Sarah said finally, but the words were a bit shaky, a bit too late. Steve took a step back. His face fell.
“I’d love to.” Tony grasped the clasp in his hands. “Are you ready?”
She licks a paw. “I can’t?” she challenges, before she extends her front legs and arches her back.
Indeed – none of them have been sleeping all that much post-Snap, and it was definitely taking its toll on their bodies. Even Steve was feeling the weariness of it, although every time he looked in the mirror, he was still as perfect as ever. He was jealous sometimes of the fact that everyone else could show their visible exhaustion while he couldn’t. It was a blessing, but it was also a curse.

So he argued, “No, I don’t,” tearing his heart to pieces and denying it. Because he couldn’t have Tony.
“Well, she slept with the owner of her company, who took completely advantage of their power discrepancy to fuck with the man he’s really in love with, so let’s not shame her, shall we?” Pepper cocked an eyebrow without moving her eyes from Steve and Carol.
Cooking and baking might not be skills Tony possesses, but at least he has other outstanding skills.
“I’d like us to be,” Tony replied. “If you’ll have me, that is.”
Except Obie. But Tony couldn’t think about him right now - he wasn’t here.
Tony shrugged. “Electricity went out for a good thirty seconds in the middle of lab before the generators kicked in, and the kids were idiots. One even dropped acid on himself because he was too busy staring at his classmate. I’m running a
Yeah, I don’t think “Most Unintentionally Lit Fires” is something to aspire to. All fires should be deliberate or it’s a waste of time.
The flames swallowed him up, and he succumbed to the darkness.

“Of course. I’ve always wanted you, I’m not going to give you up now, now that I know what’s at stake: this beautiful, gorgeous man who is amazing and smart and kind. I’m not giving that up for anyone else.”
“Hey.” Tony crouched down until Steve was forced to look at him in the eye. “Is that why you’ve been hiding them?”

Tony knew a lost battle when he saw one, but far be it for him to give up now. His curiosity was overwhelming, and he needed to know what was in that TARDIS. And now he knew that something was wrong with the ship, Tony had time to figure out how to break in and fix it.
Steve’s not complaining.
Steve clung to Tony. “We lost,” he mumbled back in Tony’s ears, which confirmed everything.
“Stark,” Nebula said, interrupting his musings. She turned her head and looked at him with a steady gaze, her grief carefully hidden in her eyes. Titan was just a miniscule speck behind them, the planet melding with the other stars and planets as they traveled further and further away from it. One of her hands was resting gently on the gear shift, although Tony suspected that it wasn’t doing anything. “Course has been set to Earth. We can make it to the planet in good time if we do a couple of strategic jumps. However, we do have a problem: we don’t have enough fuel to make the journey currently, and the nearest outpost is out of our way.”
“It’s nothing, Tony,” Steve said quickly, the furrow of his brow deepening.
Stevens nodded, refusing to look at Tony. He looked embarrassed, and Tony stopped, turning to Stevens fully. “It’s nothing to be ashamed about,” he said gently, squeezing Stevens’s palm. “I know the most innocent things can be triggering.”
All of his fur, because Steve is dumb.
The man was gorgeous, to put it lightly. In reality, he looked like a Greek statue, with blond hair slicked back without a strand out of place and a well-groomed beard that made him look older and wise. His chest stretched the red sweater he wore, hugging every inch of muscle that was not covered by the well-worn black leather jacket. Tony had to stop himself from undressing the man after he reached the waistband of his pants and drag his eyes back up to see his blue eyes twinkling with curiosity and then with amusement. Tony blushed; the man looked like he knew what Tony was doing to him.
Six doctorates couldn’t save you from a Mario Kart drop item?
“Stop,” Tony commanded. There was trepidation in his eyes. “If you’re going to say what I think you’re about to say, please don’t. Please don’t give me hope.”
The plunger moved up and down, and Butterfingers turned completely around to show that he had been cleaned. Tony grinned. “Good boy. I’ll let you exterminate.”
Tony squirrel likes it! Look at his face!
“I thought you lost your wings in Afghanistan. I read your file,” Steve said. “I never thought to question it.”
You really should dump Stark and go out with me, at least I know how to cook. I’m an amazing chef, I’d have you drooling before the first course.
With Tony by his side, he felt he could stand up to the world, no matter what they said. Especially if they mocked him for his wings.
Steve’s breath rattled in his chest when he inhaled, and there was a tightness in his throat that wouldn’t go away; thank God they were finally home. “You gonna be okay?” Bucky asked when Steve turned the doorknob.
“You know I do,” Steve said, “trust you, that is.”

“Yeah,” Steve said, and he smiled at the Bucky told him all the stories about his sister flying in the air with him.
“I hate it, looking out of the window and seeing nothing but stars and blackness. It makes me feel insignificant and small – it reminds me of when I sent the nuke into space.” Tony sniffed and closed his eyes, trying to tamp down the panic of thinking about the powerlessness.
wasn’t good enough for
“But I killed ma and Bucky,” Steve said. “I...I can’t lose you too.”
Steve punched through the punching bag with more force, shattering the chains that held it and sending it flying. “I told you I don’t want to be a part of it.”
"Do you really want me to stop?" Steve asks lowly, biting his ear. "Do you think you can even tell me to stop?"
“Okay, well, the chameleon circuit is broken, that’s for sure, but it’s okay,” the man explained rapidly. ”And what that is is a TARDIS, T-A-R-D-I-S, Time and Relative Dimension in Space. It’s a ship that travels across time and space.”
“Language,” Steve absentmindedly said, throwing his shield ahead of him. He cringed when the words caught up to him. “Sorry, I – “
“I know you can, but I like doing this for you.” Steve gently shoves his wet nose under the fur on his neck and nuzzles there, scenting him and claiming him as his own. Tony hardheartedly bats at the offending nose before he turns around and presses his own nose to the dog’s.
Tony looked up from the image, staring at the figure in front of him. Suddenly, he couldn’t bear seeing Steve, so he turned around, walked a few steps away from the image of the man. “This got to be a new form of nightmares,” Tony mumbled, “This is my head showing me what I can’t have, ever.”
sorry, sorry. but how about a picnic in bed after?
(See the end of the chapter for
“By all means, Captain. At your leisure,” Tony smirked and was quickly on his way to seeing stars.
But divided, they fell. Perhaps if they were banded together like before, they would have succeeded in pushing back Thanos, but they would never know for sure. As such, the universe was numb from the utter devastation, facing the consequences of a judge, jury, and executioner.
“I believe that.”
“What—” Steve began to say when he found his voice again, but Tony cut him off with a “Be quiet for a second.”
Tony opened his eyes, expecting to see an angry version of Steve Rogers, the one that left him back in the cold bunker of Siberia. It was the typical version of him these days when he dreamed of him. Sometimes the dreams took on the form of Steve raising his shield high above his prone body, eyes glaring at him in utter disgust as the edge of the disc gradually gained momentum in its downward trajectory before finding its home deep within his chest. It normally stayed there, held up in the dent of armor and between broken ribs while Tony gasped his last breaths around the foreign object in his body, looking up at Cap’s cold eyes.
The cave shook again, and the explosion was much louder, echoing loudly inside their prison. Tony was limited in sight by the metal eye pieces he had, and he hated the selective blindness. Yinsen snapped his head towards the door, scowling.
“Does it hurt?” Tony asked, continuing to stretch him.
He wished he could do the same, let his wings flow freely and tangle them among those he cared about.
As soon as Butterfingers settled beside DUM-E by the charging station, Tony stared after the bot, and he sighed. He turned back to his mental checklist, a never ending list of tasks that seems to grow longer every time he thought about it. He just wanted a good night’s sleep for once…was that too much to ask for? But with the imminent shareholder’s meeting, he had no choice but to work through the night so that he could at least make a dent in his work.
Steve couldn’t stop grinning when Clint’s outraged yell travelled after him, and he raced down the corridor. He didn’t know what possessed him to get onto the elevator, but as soon as he realized that he was already in the elevator, he realized he didn’t want to get off either.
Tony’s smile warmed him to the core. “I’m going to teach you how to fly.”
“We made it,” Nebula said, crouching down in front of him. “We’re back on Earth.”
“There’s no way to tell,” Bruce replied. “I’m compiling the list, but it is by far not comprehensive. However, we’ve catalogued most of the key figures. King T’Challa and Princess Shuri are gone, as you know. China’s president is gone. Canada’s president is still alive, as well as the prime minister of the U.K.”
Stevens smiled. It was infectious, and Tony found himself grinning harder in return. “I’m ready now.”
There was a fleeting hope within his chest as well as slight despair.
Dreams. That were all they were. Yet, Tony craved them every time he closed his eyes because those were the only times that it felt like home. When he stood there in front of him in his dreams, Tony could breathe more easily because it was
Bruce’s back was to the door when Steve approached, but he turned just as Steve reached his hand up to knock. A movement of mouth, and the door opened to let Steve in. Bruce looked haggard.
“I don’t know why I’m your friend!” The muffled voice yelled back.
Steve thought dully. “Wha – “ Steve started, stopping when his voice cracked. He cleared his throat. “What’s the status?”
Steve blinked. “No, she was supposed to go with Bucky, who was running late, though I never found out why, so Pepper had me escort her, even though I think she left with Rhodey.”
Pepper’s calling me now. Oops, sorry Pepper. Back to work.

“Fascinating. Not sure if the Guardians would appreciate the modifications of their ship.” Nebula’s voice was flat, but Tony had an inkling that she was attempting dry humor. “But they’re not here, so I guess they can’t complain.”
“Yes, sir?”
Steve grabbed her palm, heated and sweaty with fever, and she looked at him with her eyes at half-mast, shiny with unshed tears. “Don’t blame yourself for this. This would have happened anyway,” she insisted.
“Because we were both idiots,” Steve murmured, answering his unspoken question like he said it aloud. Oops.
“I think about six seconds after you did.”
...Tony screwed his eyes shut, trying to block out the rapid thoughts that connected logic together. He hadn’t seen Vision before he left Earth; he knew that Vision sometimes disappeared. Vision was his own person, able to move as he pleased, so Tony respected that independence. But now, had he known that he would be out here alone, he would have cherished the rest of his time with the rest of his family. No JARVIS, no FRIDAY, DUM-E or U to keep him company.
“Thank you Widow,” Steve said, embarrassed. But he didn’t let go of Tony, because he realized he didn’t care if they found out that he was so desperately in love with the man he held in his arms, the man who saved him from himself and from the hatred he had for himself.
them.”
“I’ve been having these dreams. I’m in this room, and Tony’s in it too. He’s been telling me…things, and one of them was the fact that I’ve been stuck chasing the past. I don’t know if I’m just crazy or...I’ve never really thought about these things before.”
Steve tentatively opened his eyes to peek, and then his eyes widened in shock. “Woah,” he said in awe.
Cook at home
“Great!” Tony walked back to his work table and picked up something. When he turned around, Steve realized that what Tony was holding were his metal feathers.
The man chuckled, his eyes crinkling with mirth. “She tells me that you tried breaking in. She didn’t very much appreciate that.”
“Well, it’s not the first time we’ve seen weird things,” Rhodey pointed out. “Remember the time –“
“Yeah,” Steve replied as if he knew what Tony wanted. He probably did, after knowing him for this long, and he pulled Tony’s pants down so that his cock sprung free from its confinement. It was hard, aching, and red, leaking come down his shaft. Steve stared at it, mesmerized, leaning forward again to kiss the tip of his leaking cock. “God, you’re beautiful. Delicious too.”
“Bucky came in no more than three minutes after you,” Tony said slowly, making deliberate eye contact with Steve as realization hit both men at once.
They couldn’t change the past; they can only hope for the best for the future. Hence, once Tony had finished making his routine checks of the ship, all he and Nebula had left to do was to sit, wait, let
Going back into the old and familiar routine of creating helped keep his mind off the fact that he was still in the middle of nowhere and creating a sensor that could help the search drew his attention away from his dire situation and into something he could control. Tony rolled the pen between the fingers of one hand and absently drummed his other hand against his thigh. Both legs were on the seat crisscrossed, and blank pieces of paper were strewn about at the base of the chair. The pages were blank – they would be for a while yet because paper on the ship were spare and Tony had to conserve for the final product – but already Tony had an idea in his mind, not only to use the sensor on the ship, but also improve it to extend its range as far as possible. He built upon the idea, bringing the pieces together. Finally, he grasped the idea and blankly reached for a sheet of paper, drafting his design by hand.
It’s called an upgrade. At least he listens to me.
“SHIELD’s medical bay.” Fury stepped in front of him, hands behind his back, standing straight and confidently, looking like the director he was. “Some fishermen found you in the ice, and we brought you here so you could recover.”

Asshole: do you want to go and come back?
Steve took another bite of his burger, chewing it and swallowing before he said, “
For once, Steve woke up not feeling like he took a crowbar to the skull. He felt a slight upturn at the corners of his mouth, and his heart felt light. It was an unfamiliar feeling after all the events that had happened, and for a moment longer, he laid in bed clinging to it and remembering the small smiles Tony gave him in their dreamscape.
“But, I can’t.”
The tongue pulls away, and he moans at the loss. In its place though, Steve's clothed body drags against his hole, and he whimpers because the feeling is intense, too much, battering against his nerves.
If what he thought what Steve was going to say to him in the dreamscape were the same words that he thought about Steve, he needed to get home. He had something to look forward to, walking down firma terra to face Steve and have him tell those words face to face. It gave him an inkling of hope.
“Come on.” Bucky tugged Steve lightly, but Steve couldn’t convince himself to move. He wanted this last moment with her. “You’re going to get sick if you stay out here any longer.”
Still, he couldn’t stop absentmindedly pluck the covet feathers like a scab. It was just...he needed some pain to alleviate the guilt.
And Steve pressed his entire weight forward, trapping Tony between his body and the glass, holding him softly and gently as the heavy, stiff weight of his cock pressed into Tony’s ass. Tony cried out as his ass accepted the intrusion, arching his back and taking more and more of it until Steve stopped, his balls pressed against his buttcheeks.
“I just got home,” he said, “let me get coffee first and then maybe, just maybe, I’ll let you blow up some of my projects.”
Tony stood next to him, and that pressure by his side eased some of that fear, but still. Flying with his own wings. He hadn’t even taken his back brace off yet.
“It’s what’s going to replace this thing.” Tony tapped the center of his chest, biting down a moan when the thing rattled painfully in his chest. He gasped, “Bad idea. Regardless, I am not going to remain stuck to a car battery. This is an arc reactor.”
Steve was there when Tony opened his eyes to his dreams. He stared, and Steve slowly took one step towards him, giving him a hesitant and watery upwards twitch of lips.
Bucky tossed his arm over Steve’s shoulders, his wings fluttering behind them. They were a gorgeous blue that reminded Steve of the ocean, rippling beautifully in the fall breeze. “I’m a freak anyway for being the new kid. Might as well be freaks together.”
Tony pursed his lips, and his hand weakly twitched towards her outstretched hand, letting her pull him up to his feet. “We’re home,” he breathed back at her, and she nodded.
And done! Dreamkist, I hope you like this. Please let me know if you guys like this as well with a comment and a kudos. You guys are amazing sticking with me.
Take him out to dinner
“With pleasure, sweetheart,” Tony said, leaning over him again to kiss him sweetly. Steve moaned softly at the feeling of the press of his lips. “It would be an honor to do so.”
“So do you trust me to tell you that your wings are beautiful?” Tony’s were dark, but they held Steve steady, grounding him.
Steve came back to himself after an indeterminate amount of time. He was on his side, and Tony was behind him and spooning him. His wings were placed carefully behind him, and Tony’s free arm circled around his body, protecting him.
Tony pressed back, breathing hard but relaxing, trusting Steve not to hurt him. “I’m ready,” he breathed. “I really want you, everything. Bare. I want nothing between us.”
“Your wings are marvelous, friend Steven!” Thor said, clapping his back. Steve noted that he refrained from touching his wing muscles, and for that, he appreciated Thor more. “Truly, I did not understand your choice, but I have heard Natasha’s explanation. Tis most vexatious that a color so exalted in my home should be loaded with such spurious meaning!”
They fell into a comfortable silence, and Tony shivered hard as the chilly breeze blew by him. Without looking, Stevens put his arm around Tony and tucked him closer by his side. Tony couldn’t complain; the man was a radiator, and sitting next to him was comforting
“Tony, Tony, Tony,” Steve babbled back, gasping and heaving while Tony lifted his thighs and raised them over his own spread ones. Steve felt opened and exposed, completely vulnerable as Tony looked down at him with love in his eyes. Steve felt his cheeks heat from being so open.
He...Steve loved it, and he wanted to sob because he loved it so much. And it was so hard that he couldn’t have this, that he couldn’t keep Tony for himself because he wasn’t good enough.
“Fuck that noise,” Tony dismissed.
“Is this yours?” Archie repeated.
Reed Richards deserves an award for most pretentious and unnecessary use of a thesaurus. That was like listening to a half-plagiarized essay from a high school teenager.
“Some of my feathers fell out during our last fight, and I can’t put them back myself. I don’t trust DUM-E to put these feathers in place, so if you can do it—”
Steve stared at them as they grew in. Then he looked back. His fingers, unbidden, reached over to touch them, and he shuddered slightly when they were too sensitive for his curious touch. But they were soft, and Steve admired them.
