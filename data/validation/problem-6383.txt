Cap offered up this account like it was nothing, as if it didn’t have the potential to change everything Tony knew about Steve Rogers. Their entire war over the Accords had practically revolved around Rogers’ refusal to see the issue as anything with more nuance than ‘government bad, individual liberties good.’ Tony had definitely made his own mistakes along the way too, but every time he’d tried to get Cap to see that there was anything resembling a middle ground, he had entirely shut down. Tony knew the Civil War hadn’t happened here, and that Rogers was somehow the head of SHIELD, but this was the first bit of real, concrete evidence of just how different this version of the man was. For just a few seconds, he let himself mourn the fact that this version of Cap had absolutely zero romantic interest in Tony. Apparently, said mourning may have lasted beyond a few seconds, because eventually Cap’s expression began to morph from patient neutrality to something more resembling concern. (Tony still kind of hated subspace right now. It was making him too slow and way too obvious.)
Ah yes. While it is a very Stark-like thing to do, the dying-but-not-really-dying shtick, I'm afraid this universe's version of Tony Stark is indisputably deceased. But no need to take my word for it: take a look for yourself:
“To be able to answer that I have to tell you both something that very few people know. I’m not who we’ve been telling people I am.”
Indeed, the presence of orientation in the D/s sense makes the type of binaristic thought that often shapes mainstream discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity all but impossible. Take something like the assumed (and obviously problematic and just plain unscientific) links between something like dominant behaviours and masculine gender identities in universes like the MCU; they are even more transparently absurd in the D/s verse because Domination crosses all boundaries of sex, gender, sexual orientation, etc. This is not to say that this universe has perfect, progressive gender politics, but the privileging of orientation in their sense of that term, coupled with the comprehensive and mandatory orientation education most individuals receive at age 14 does tend to make for more nuanced understandings of the web of intersections between gender, sexuality, and specific kinky practices which may or may not be tied to either of those factors.
“It wasn’t like that! We just…at first we were just two subs fooling around. It made its way into something else, we both needed more, but all the Dominants in the Tower were occupied. So we just handled it ourselves.”
,” Sam says, deciding it is in his best interest not to let either of them finish. “Cast the deciding vote here.”
Coulson didn’t ask who ‘he’ was, nor did he attempt to lecture or persuade. But his lips tightened and his breath became shaky and shallow, and when Steve finally dared to look, he found the man staring back at him with a disappointment Steve had never witnessed before. The dual blow of letting down his handler and his partner was almost too much. He didn’t risk looking up again until the landing pad had been entirely emptied of people.
“I…yeah, I think I am. I didn’t think I wanted to, or that I even could, but secrets destroyed a version of you and I before. Killed it before it even had the chance to be anything. And if you’re serious about this—”
“That’s convincing,” Bucky opined, seizing the opportunity to steal a handful of caramel corn from the bowl in Sam’s lap. For once, Sam didn’t bother rising to the bait.
“He’ll need aftercare obviously, but there are no wounds or injuries requiring attention. If you want to be extra cautious maybe start off with a bath; throw some Epsom salt in it, and be extra thorough washing him and he’ll be all set. What else do you need this morning, Steve? How’s the drop?”
“Yeah probably! Look, the two of you—especially you—waited so long to do this that it’s practically reached mythic proportions by now. You gotta bring it back down to Earth a little bit, otherwise both of you are gonna be on edge the entire night.”
Tony squeezed a generous portion of lube onto his fingers. He pulled his knees up to his chest and released a breath as he slid his index gently inside; it had been a long time since he’d indulged in anal play (it hadn’t been a particular kink of Pepper’s, and he hadn’t trusted many of his previous partners to top.) But he imagined that he was doing exactly as he’d been instructed, playing with his hole not just for the sake of it but to prepare himself to be…to be used later that day. He moaned, and his other hand crept toward his cock, wrapping it in a loose fist.
For so long, SHIELD HQ had been the stuff of Peter’s nightmares. He’d always assumed that if he ended up here he would be facing hours of interrogation, maybe even disappearing off into the Fridge or one of the other prisons for enhanced people, never to be heard from again. In his mind, it had been a cold, sterile space full of stuffy people in suits who all resembled the version of Captain America Peter had grown up knowing from gym PSAs.
Breakfast was horrible. Not the food, this version of Rhodey was a way better cook than his counterpart in Tony’s own universe, but the last thing Tony really wanted was to chance eating. Rhodey ignored each and every protest, laying the table with a protein and fat-heavy meal; he did, at least, pair it with a green smoothie, which Tony seized first with a grudging kind of gratitude.
The news that the other Steve had selected Sam rather than Bucky as his successor didn’t shake Steve the way he might have assumed it would’ve. Bucky was a wonderful man, but he had fought long and hard to emerge both from Steve’s shadow and from the equally weighty legacy of the acts he had been forced to commit as the Soldier. Sam, though…Sam embodied so much of what the Captain America mythos valued. He was brave and kind and moral without being inflexible; he’d loved his country enough to keep fighting for it after it had claimed the life of his Dominant,  but when his personal belief in Steve had conflicted with SHIELD’s messaging, he’d made his own choice. He forgave, he offered support to anyone who needed it, and he still seemed to have an endless well of optimism, humour, and faith to draw from.
For all his assurances that he wasn’t after some kind of elevator-shenanigans, Clint made a point of stepping right into Tony’s space the second the doors closed. Tony had a ridiculous vision of some medical drama Pepper had used to watch where the male lead had sniffed at his counterpart’s hair in elevators a lot, and laughed nervously.
There are a host of potential reasons for this, but I would assume that much of it came down to the complicity of several members of the company in covering-up the study Howard had conducted. The combination of these actions on top of Stave’s betrayal made him deeply distrustful of the senior members of Stark Industries, and less able or willing to remember that there were others at the company who wanted and perhaps needed his time and attention.
submissive.) “He made me promise, Stevie, that if there was even a shred of hope left that I wouldn’t let you give up. I swore that if he was missing, or if the evidence we were given could have more than one meaning, that we’d never stop looking, never abandon him to something like what he faced in Afghanistan.” (Tony had dreamed of that cave just a few nights before, curling into Steve’s chest and begging for assurance that he’d really made it out.) “I also swore that when it was over, without any doubt or possibility that he could be saved, I would be the one to take you in to see him. Even if it made you hate me. I promised that man, that man we
“Why are you out of pyjamas? It’s Saturday morning, shouldn’t you be watching cartoons or something equally wholesome?” Steve looked down at his dress pants and teal button-down shirt and shrugged.
“Let’s maybe take a break with this and practice the interview stuff?” Tony suggested. Exchanging one kind of torture for another wasn’t exactly a relief, but at least he’d be the only one in the metaphorical hot-seat. Pepper blew a stray piece of hair out of her face and nodded, folding her legs underneath her to sit in one of the large armchairs. Next to Tony, Steve let out a grunt of relief and high-tailed it to the kitchen, muttering something about making tea for everyone.
Steve though of the submissive sleeping peacefully upstairs, a man who had chosen them, who trusted them so absolutely as to voluntarily leave himself without the protection of a suit whose entire purpose had been to be with him always. He knew Natasha’s fear, understood the impulse to draw away from all the risks that came with loving and hoping, but Tony had called them his home. As far as Steve was concerned, the rest was mere details.
May exchanged hugs with several of the others, and an especially long one with Steve. Tony seemed as surprised by this as Peter felt, though nothing came of it until midway through dinner.
“Good. What feels positive about that?” Tony shrugged, already disproportionately exhausted by the process of finding one damn word to write down. “Want me to tell you what’s valuable about this part of you for me?”
As the battle went on, the confusion and fear grew amongst Taskmaster’s team. They convinced themselves constantly that they were seeing various members of the team, especially Tony, usually several levels away from where those people actually were. At one point, a particularly hysterical member of the force declared that Tony must have created ‘techno-ghosts,’ and that none of the Avengers were actually present at all. Steve felt almost bad for the guy when Bruce, who hadn’t even needed to Hulk out yet, easily took him down just by yelling ‘boo’ and then cracking him on the head.
“Just..team never did that stuff with me before. Still getting used to having people. S’nice though.”
“If I were you I’d be climbing the walls wanting to get out of here by now. Since we can’t actually escape the Tower, I thought we could at least pretend for the night. To be totally fair, though, the rest of the team and JARVIS are the ones who actually put it together; they wanted me to be able to play without being spoiled.” Mistaking Tony’s silence for some sign of discontent, Clint started to babble. “But it was my idea, I swear. We also don’t have to do it if you don’t—”
“You’re a real fan of the passive voice, aren’t you?” Reaching distantly for long-forgotten grammar lessons, Tony blinked back his incredulity.
The natural decision would have been for Steve (and therefore Talia, who was here primarily to shadow and learn from him) to join the UN forces. While they enjoyed a friendly relationship, SHIELD had no real jurisdiction in Wakanda. It made the most sense for them to proceed as if the arms deal might still happen, and then return to the US if (when, Steve privately felt) nothing came of the matter. And it was certainly not as if Wakanda really required their assistance; when it came to something as important to the nation as protecting the Princess, Steve was sure any outsiders would be superfluous at best. It was just, well…
this house.” For Tony, whose tastes and interests had never been as well-reflected by a space as they were by the Malibu house, this was at least as good as a declaration of love to himself. Maybe even more meaningful in some ways, because Malibu was everything people tended not to like about Tony: opulent, excessive, luxurious, brash and unashamed. He wrapped his arms around Clint’s neck and kissed him, letting the shoes and socks he’d carried back to the house fall to the floor with a wet squelch. Clint met every touch with no hint of the awkwardness that had existed between Tony and just about everyone after the news about Peter had dropped.
Tony closed his eyes, as if that would somehow ward off the memory; instead, his mind offered it in blaring technicolour: the harsh, reverberating thud of Natasha’s paddle, the way it had felt to be bent over her lap, held there. How his desperation and desire to escape the pain went up and up and up, reaching a pinnacle and then, just when it seemed like it would be too much, they fell away entirely, leaving behind nothing but bone-deep certainty and acceptance that he would be there until his Dominants deemed the price paid. He remembered it all, but the part he’d hidden from most had been the memory of how it had been afterward: how light he’d felt, how freeing it was to hear Bruce and Natasha tell him over and over again that it was done, over, that he was forgiven.
Eventually, the group decided on Natasha. Her previous scene had involved bathing Tony, so they had good reason to believe he wouldn’t be upset by her washing him again, and of all of them she also seemed the most reluctant to consider leaving. (Probably still upset with herself for missing the earlier signs that Tony had needed more attention than he was getting.) Before he turned down the hallway toward the bedroom, Steve’s eyes found Bucky’s, seeking…well, he didn’t know exactly what, but most of his answers could usually be found in Bucky’s steady, even regard. Tonight was no different.
“I suppose we would both be a disappointment to them now,” he finally said in stiff, stilted Russian. (Once, they had spoken to one another in Natasha’s mother tongue with far more frequency, but it was a rarity now.)
? Was he giving up on Tony already? Steve’s hands were back on him, Steve’s Dominant voice in his ear, and that was the only thing keeping Tony from descending into real panic.
It was the type of thing the other version of Tony never would have done at a public event, too conscious of ramping up the mania around his and Steve’s relationship. This Tony was also the one to ask Steve to dance first, though it was Steve who did exactly as Pepper had already given him permission to do and brought them just slightly closer together than seemed to be the general rule at these things. Tony flashed him a wicked little grin in response and laid his head against Steve’s shoulder. Cell-phone cameras flashed from multiple sides, and Steve heard the woman dancing next to them give a wistful sigh. He wished, somewhat absurdly, that he could pause the moment long enough to draw it for himself. He had spent so long not wanting to be in the present that he was greedy to capture it from every possible angle now.
“It was fine actually. I sort of thought it would be weird, but the fact that I don’t want to have sex
First and foremost: don't worry. I know that ending seemed like things are wrapping up. They're not. This was a big step for Steve and Tony, but it was also a complicated one that everyone is going to have complicated feelings about one they're out of their headspaces. We're not done this story.
There was an ominous series of noises which included gunfire, angry yelling in at least three separate languages, a repulsor blast, and then the unmistakable sounds of the War Machine armour taking off. (Rhodey wasn’t panting, and the screams hadn’t sounded pained, which meant it had probably been some kind of training thing, or maybe a really low stakes op. The gunfire and repulsors had been used to frighten or instruct, not wound. Phil had been muttering something about Italy recently—)
Memories generally didn't assault Steve with no warning these days. He'd learned strategies to keep the onslaught of treasured moments at bay, letting them become something he occasionally sought out rather than a constant overlay that muted his present. But occasionally, like now, they came without warning.
“I think you’re quite aware that I am listening to you, and that I will always listen to you—anywhere, at any time, but especially in this space.” Tony wished Bruce sounded the slightest bit angry. He knew what to do with anger, knew both how to stoke it and turn it into rage and how to quell and gentle it into forgiveness. But this dispassionate refusal to be provoked left behind no cracks to put pressure on, no buttons to push.
, Steve. I thought I was going to die, and he didn’t spank me or cut me or humiliate me or anything! Most of what he did was fucking talking! I mean, what the fuck?”
“Mild concussion; SHIELD and Bruce insisted on a CT and I’m clear of any other head trauma. Second degree burn on the arm.” She reached out her uninjured arm to scrape the remaining all dressed chips from the bowl on the coffee table, and then jerked her chin toward Rogers in wordless question.
Last night with Bruce, even to some extent with Rhodey, he’d struggled not to hide from this kind of scrutiny. Tony didn’t want to think very hard about the stories etched on his skin. The large and barely-healed scar from Thanos stabbing him with a piece of his own damn suit was still a vivid, angry red in some places; he’d ripped his stitches and flirted with infection frequently after the Snap. The marks from the impact of Steve’s shield in Siberia were higher, and more faded, but still clearly visible. Higher still was the neat incision from the surgery to extract the shrapnel and the original arc reactor; underneath, the cluster of jagged, colourless blemishes, evidence of Yinsen’s frantic efforts to save Tony’s life. And that was just his chest.
“I mean, I wouldn’t put anything past him at this point, but no, not to my knowledge. I don’t feel I should divulge all of the reasons since they’re not just SHIELD’s secrets, but please believe me when I tell you that none of us wanted to do it now. I heard you during our previous sessions. I know…I know I’m not ready, no matter how badly I wish I was.”
He didn’t make it through his pancakes this morning, and from Steve’s faint look of disapproval, Tony guessed that his time before they had some kind of Conversation about eating and rules and shit was numbered. But he had to get out from under those stares, and the weight of the expectations behind them. Because truth was…it hadn’t been quite as amazing as the box had promised. Oh it had been fun of course. Steve was a generous and capable lover, and more confident in his Dominance than Tony had expected. But for all the hype…maybe even because of the hype, he’d felt curiously underwhelmed in the aftermath.
Stepping backward into the shadows slightly, Tony simply watched. While the shock of encountering a solid wall of green when he’d been expecting Bruce had pretty much dulled his other observational senses, it was clear now that Hulk was…well, not agitated in that pants-wetting way that meant anyone in the immediate vicinity needed to clear out, but not post-battle exhausted either. (These were basically the only two states Tony had ever seen the Hulk in—again, he didn’t count the Bruce/Hulk mash-up that Bruce had turned them into.) His head was in his massive green hands, fingers occasionally pulling at strands of his and Bruce’s curly hair; every half a minute or so, he made quiet sounds that sounded like a cross between an angry grunt and the little humming noises that Bruce made when he was thinking.
You all are rocking it with these questions, seriously. I have so much fun spending Saturdays on these!
“It’s quieter. Only my assistant knows where I am, so I can actually manage to get more than five minutes of work done at a time without someone coming in to interrupt me with endless requests for meetings or complaints about God only knows what.” Tony had wondered more than once in his previous universe if putting Pepper in charge of SI had been the right move. Not for the company, oh no, Pepper’s competence and her commitment were never something he’d ever had cause to doubt for even a second. Even the maneuvering and the manipulation of corporate politics, which ran somewhat counter to Pepper’s generally kind and frank nature, were something he’d known she’d master quickly. But he’d worried about whether or not it would bring her joy and satisfaction on its own terms, or whether it was still Pepper trying to care for him, just in another way. He looked at the tense line of her shoulders and the squint that her eyes always got when she’d been staring at screens for too long, and wondered it again.
That had to be Steve or Phil, they were the only ones who called him by his given name. It felt unexpectedly good that he knew that, was becoming familiar with their patterns and habits.
“What if I throw in some pyjama pants and promise to keep it strictly PG?” Steve eyed him doubtfully. “I’m serious! No funny business, Rogers, not even if you beg.”
“There’s kind of a few ways we can go about this, and since you and I don’t know one another very well in this capacity I don’t want to make any assumptions about which will be the best option for you. Your access history indicates you’ve already familiarized yourself with the team’s suits and weaponry, so you’re welcome to continue on with that and I’ll provide any feedback I can from the perspective of their handler. You could also spend some time catching up on past and active missions assigned to the Avengers Initiative; this would serve the dual purpose of also helping avoiding awkward questions about why you don’t know some of these things once your presence in this universe goes public.” Coulson gestured to a nested set of holoscreens, which Tony could see now were comprised mostly of after-action reports. He pointed at another stack of screens, the front image of which bore a symbol Tony didn’t recognize.
Clint’s grin was wide and toothy, though when he realized Tony was looking at him he attempted to feign a neutral expression.
“I…don’t know, Clint. I didn’t have time, the last few years, to—” Clint’s hand shifted, pressing down on a knotted muscle near Tony’s left shoulder blade. He yelped, though by the time the noise had escaped him, the touch had already turned into more of a massage, Clint working some of the tension out of the same muscle he’d just punished with clever, confident fingers.
“I require no honorific at this time, Talia; the boundaries of consent are muddled enough, particularly from your context. Now, you also realize, I’m sure, that if we proceed we shall encounter several major barriers, the most significant of which is that my style of Dominance, which involves orientation-based interactions in the workplace, is not legal in your country. You are only starting out in your career, and while your skillset would undoubtedly be valuable to Wakanda, I am not sure I could permit you abandoning your life at home to remain here.”
“Look, some space sounds like it might be the right call for both of you. We’ll get you set up in one of the guest rooms here—but just for the night. Tomorrow you and I are going to go see your Aunt together. We’ll give her an Intro to Spiderman, and before she can get too upset about you having kept her in the dark on all of that, we’ll tell her about the internship. We’ll let her know that you won’t be working alone anymore, which is undoubtedly going to result in way fewer emergency room visits and a generally higher standard of living for both of you. Compared to what you both have been through recently, it’ll probably sound like heaven to her.”
“That’s the Spiderman! This is great! We’ve been trying to do an intake with him for ages, but he’s surprisingly slippery when he wants to be. Let’s go!” Natasha’s grip on his arm tightened, and Steve glared in exasperation. However untrained and unpolished Spiderman might be, he was incredibly fast and resourceful. If they didn’t hurry they would lose him and it would be weeks before they got another chance like this. Natasha was way too smart and savvy an agent not to realize that, which meant—“You know something.”
Did I mention your comments and kudos give me life? Because they do! Thank you all so much for how fun you're making it to share and discuss this story. You're great. There was also an #AskStrange question this week, so feel free to check out the reply to that as well. And if you want the good Doctor to answer your question...well, just ask!
“That…that would make sense. Tony alluded to the fact that they almost never trained together the way we do, and that’s a lot of what we got up to back then,” Bruce said.
I hope it was worth the wait. I had an absolute blast writing it, and I'm so excited to finally get to share it with all of you. Thank you so very much for your comments, kudos, and questions, which have fueled and sustained this long journey.
With the abrupt release from that particular burden truly beginning to sink in, combined with the experience of witnessing Phil and Natasha interact in subspace…it had been as close as Tony would probably ever get (sorry, Bruce) to anything resembling meditation. The four of them—well, mostly three, Phil had mostly been pretty quiet—had talked and joked through several soap operas, the local news, a kid’s movie (which had been a great chance to witness how the non-sexual aspects of orientation were represented in this universe), plus a beer commercial that had triggered a detour through several other memorable ads on YouTube. Tony hadn’t been brave enough to ask any more questions about the team’s dynamic directly, but he’d learned a lot from the low-pressure task of just watching. Far from the usual hell it was to try to draw information out of either of them, Natasha and Clint had been free with their explanations and encouragement. Even when Tony had managed to completely misread things—like when he’d been sure the switch on a soap opera would end up being a villain simply for displaying both Dom and subbish traits—they’d been gentle in their corrections, and genuinely interested in where some of his assumptions came from.
“Oh fuck you, I know it’s safe. I made it. Well not me, but, whatever. I think if I call him Mark 2 to you, the way I do in my head, you’ll probably be offended. Hold on…I said that out loud. Damn.” Steve tried not to roll his eyes. It wasn’t that he was against alcohol; when Tony drank safely, and for the right reasons, he was just as funny and charming as ever. But drinking like this made him clumsy and foolish and
what he’s saying you fucking—ugh. Steve. Sit down. Now.” When Steve didn’t move, Natasha nodded at Thor who physically lifted him into a fireman’s carry, set him on the couch, and then sat in his lap for good measure. Steve wiggled uselessly for a few seconds, then sighed and crossed his arms over his chest. “We want your input. We need it; we’re all working very hard on our relationships with him, but we’re not whole without you there, and neither is Tony. We need you with us, especially if we’re going to start working him through the aspects of this that he’s going to be inclined to fear or resist.”
the Hulk instead of the amalgam that he and Bruce had formed to fight Thanos. It was also a sudden and harsh reminder that Tony had no idea at all where Bruce and Hulk stood in this universe. They functioned well enough in a fight, that much Tony had been able to tell watching them the other day. Outside those situations where they agreed to focus on an immediate threat, though, what was their relationship like? Did Bruce still despise and resent the Hulk, the way he had those first few years in Tony’s universe? Was he working on different ways to reign in the Hulk’s power and rage? Had this version of Bruce taken another approach entirely?
“Nononono MJ it’s not like that. I mean, it is sort of like that. But I would have done it anyway, and I’m pretty sure he said, not during the fight but after, that Steve probably wasn’t even trying to hurt me anyway.” At this point, Peter inexplicably decided the best way to make his case was to show MJ the vlog entries he’d made on the trip. They did not have the effect he had hoped. MJ was incandescent with rage, and she alternated between cursing Tony’s name and berating Peter for ever having given the man anything except a series of lawsuits. Her fury was terrifying and magnificent. Peter’s drunken, syrupy brain couldn’t decide whether the ferocity with which she was ready to protect him eclipsed the impulse to defend his mentor. At least, he didn’t until MJ spat something about how Tony’s death had perhaps been some kind of cosmic karma.
Moving through a space and a life previously inhabited by another version of himself often felt to Tony like a curious mixture of violation and recognition. Nothing so far, though, had felt so intensely like both those things as opening up the other Tony’s schematics for his team’s suits and weaponry.
Still, it was different when you were the submissive in question, and you’d just brought a scene to a grinding halt. After the word yellow fell from his lips, Tony felt as if he was in some kind of suspended state; time stretched on endlessly while he waited to find out if he’d gone and ruined everything. The first thing he registered was Coulson taking two long steps back. The demanding set of his features softened instantly, and when he spoke most of the the sharp, prickling edges Tony had learned to recognize as Dominance had retreated. They were still there in the background (and perhaps that was the difference between a yellow and a full safeword), but more than acting as a Dominant, Phil was just…Phil right now. Tony happily turned his back on the mirror, confident he wouldn’t be prevented from hiding from his reflection now.
Sadly, there was still several minutes worth of conversation after Tony gave this admittedly impulsive answer. Bruce had him verify his safeword, and reminded Tony again of all the terms of its potential use. Then he insisted on completing the rest of the usual check-in exams, which included a pointed reminder for Tony to actually wear the wrist braces Bruce himself had made to help with Tony’s carpal tunnel. (He really had been pushing this week, he could see it so clearly now.)
It was not really a tradition Phil’s proud of. Hell, it wasn't something he intended to become a tradition at all. It started out as just he and Clint poring over the data they’d collected about Tony’s universe one evening. It was shortly after the archer’s first date with Tony, and Clint was still reeling about the news that his counterpart had a wife and kids.
“So, I’m going to get this part out of the way first, so that there’s no unnecessary drama later,” Rhodey declares. “I knew about Tony. And before you get in a snit about it, Rogers, I’d ask you to remember that Tony himself gave Peter permission to tell anyone he wished. He chose to inform Pepper and myself, and given that we are his oldest friends, I certainly hope that’s something you can understand.” Steve nods stiffly.    “Good. You should also know that it was Tony’s suggestion that Peter not tell you he was still alive, and that when he asked me I totally agreed with him.”
Tony had taken more selfies in the past several days than he had for the rest of his life in total. It was one of the weirder aspects of his new routine: the team had asked him to send pictures at regular intervals to update them about his day, especially if they were spending most of it apart. He’d expected it to wear off quickly, and had tried to at least manage the silliness of it by sending the pictures to a different person every day instead of bombarding them all in a group message.
“I was not in direct contact with Stark, but my counterpart was. He is, by all accounts, as well and healthy as one could expect.”
“Tony needed correction this morning. I milked him, and it brought him down extremely hard. He’s pretty much nonverbal right now, and he reacts badly to even the sight of clothes let alone the prospect of being fully dressed. There’s no way he can train like this, and while I initially planned on just the two of us skipping out, I think it’s actually a better idea for us all to take the day. Steve mentioned that he seemed unsure of how to handle having more than one Dominant around at the same time, and exposure’s going to help with that. Plus, honestly, he’s never been down this far that I’m aware of and I’d appreciate help caring for him. He doesn’t want me out of his sight long enough to even get him some food and water, and he’ll crash soon if I don’t.” At the mere mention of Bruce leaving, Tony made a discontented whining noise.
In terms of research, there’s been a fair amount, especially in working out the scientific end off things. I knew early on that I wanted to kind of flip the narrative and upset Tony’s (and reader’s) expectations of what Dominance and submission might look like—like when he expects submissive to be pegged as overly emotional, for instance—so then it was a matter of trying to figure out how that would actually play out within the body.
It was annoyingly hard to stay self-reighteously angry, Tony reflected, when people in this universe kept being all reasonable and clear. He stuck his tongue out at the guy’s floating cloak to try to make himself feel better, and the thing ruffled in satisfying annoyance.
Steve wanted, frankly, to tell Tony to fetch his own damn snacks and blankets and whatever other comforts he required. Even without being oriented, how could the man have so little awareness as to fail to recognize that Steve was in distress here? But he gritted his teeth and, after a moment of consideration, dug Tony’s—
Tony accomplished the things he did. They were interested in the results, not the process. More than once they’d actively shut Tony down when he’d tried to explain the logic or mechanics of his actions. And here Clint was, looking utterly bewildered and almost hurt at the notion that Tony hadn’t planned on offering that information.
“No,” he denied quickly. It might have been easier and more expedient to let Pepper believe that, but everything in him railed against the suggestion.
“Clint and I got a little too ambitious with a particularly intricate bit of bondage, that’s all.” The airiness in her tone was the polar opposite of the hard lines that suddenly formed on Bruce’s face.
have, brought him to his knees and made him feel not only like his friend and teammate was pissed at him, but like he’d been a bad submissive.” Steve had known all of this already, of course had. But there was always something about hearing his mistakes methodically laid out in front of him like that that made them real, let him feel their weight and effects in a way that his self-righteous tendencies often shielded him from. Again his only reply to Bucky was silence, but the other man seemed to realize it was a very different kind of quiet this time. “If you can’t be around him we would all understand. But Stevie, you don’t get to make that choice for the rest of us. You don’t get to drive him off when we
Several members of the team booed Steve for this one; Bucky threw a slipper at his head. Phil just took another swig of his own drink (a martini made with some of Natasha’s stash of Russian vodka) and sighed. Tomorrow was going to be another rough morning.
Peter was halfway to the school’s main entrance, grateful, at least, that the day was finally over, when he remembered with a groan that he had one more stop to make. He pivoted on his heel, narrowly avoiding a collision with two senior girls. One glared poisonously at him; the other, someone he recognized distantly as a friend of Liz Toomes’, managed something closer to a sympathetic kind of grimace. (That one was worse, Peter thought. The last thing he needed was for people to start feeling sorry for him.)
Hello! I have a question for the doctor :D (may have more later, but just one right now) Whatever you can tell us without spoiling would be appreciated. I'm curious as to how the Infinity War ended in the non-bdsm verse, and what situation that verse's Tony is going to be coming out of. #askstrange
On the evening of Rhodes’ arrival, Sam finally corners his jackass friend in the gym. Bucky offers to spar, and Sam considers taking him up on it, because releasing the tension of the past several days feels appealing. But he knows damn well that Bucky will use that opportunity to avoid the topic. They’ll fight, they’ll argue, someone will probably end up getting ‘accidentally’ hit in the junk, it’ll be a whole thing. So Sam goes for the direct route.
Time and his forced acceptance of Bucky’s help made everything else slightly more bearable. Steve could see it so clearly now, how foolish he’d been to think things could work out between he and Tony. Tony would always be Iron Man, would always throw himself on every live wire he could find, and Steve simply wouldn’t be able to accept it. And seeing as he wouldn’t dream of trying to separate Tony from Iron Man, the solution was simple: they could never be more than what they were now. It would take time to accept, yes, because even Steve’s therapy had been based around an understanding that he was aiming to eventually be capable of offering Tony more. It might take a few more days to let the sting of disappointment wear off, but it wasn’t like Tony’s friendship was nothing. It was far more than Steve had dreamed he’d have just a few months ago, after all. He could learn to be grateful. To accept what he could have, and stop grasping hopelessly for what he couldn’t.
“You—this—I don’t understand you at all! You never do what I think you’re going to! And it makes me fucking crazy Steve, it makes me clumsy and foolish and totally incapable, and I am not any of those things. Stop making me like this you asshole, and go back to being predictable and simple!”
Tony would later cheerfully decree that Steve had finally learned the value of making an entrance. Steve would insist it was the sight of Taskmaster tossing the arc reactor from hand to hand like it was nothing more than a mildly entertaining glowing ball that he was juggling that made him unable to wait any longer. Whatever the case, it was that moment when Steve gave the signal to JARVIS, who opened up the armour Steve was wearing and allowed him to step out of it. Taskmaster’s face showed equal parts surprise and rage.
“Borrowed, Rhodeykins, borrowed! And I actually fixed the damn thing, it was a disaster. The arrangement of the sensors was asinine, it had less spatial reasoning than a Roomba, but when the guy found me and got pissed I was. Well. I was allegedly slightly less than clear about what I’d done and why I’d done it. But some nosy guy had been watching me work for a while; he stopped me from getting my ass kicked by explaining to PhDofus what modifications I’d made and why they made it better. And then mystery guy took me back to his dorm, let me throw up in his best pair of sneakers, which I later replaced, and the rest was history.”
“He told me he was with Thor. It seems safe to assume he’s been lying to all of us. The fact that he changed Ms. Potts's access codes also suggests to me that JARVIS was a party to the deception.”
,” Phil had ranted, forgetting momentarily that as Bucky’s handler it was his job to be listening, not adding to the other man’s stress. “And it’s not like I expected him to drop his life story at our feet, but getting it in bits and pieces like this just makes it all the more challenging to put it all together into something coherent. Steve texted me something from Wakanda the other day about watching that no one makes any gestures or comments that would suggest a willingness to try to
“Tell him to stop fucking babying me,” he demanded. Steve frowned as he set the heaving bag full of food from the deli on the floor. He was surprised that Tony would try something this blatantly manipulative, but then Tony hadn’t been confronted much with the reality of a poly relationship with multiple Doms and Switches up to this point. He’d dated and scened with most of the team of course, but rarely more than one of them at once, and never in a context where he’d ended up disagreeing with one of his Dominants.
“I wanted to provide you with some context before you speak to Sir, as I do not believe he is in the best shape to provide you with a clear account of what has happened.” Steve assented, trying not to permit too much of his impatience or anxiety to bleed through. “Sir recently learned of the existence of Ultron, and it has greatly disturbed him. He has not spoken in much depth, but from what I have been able to gather, the Ultron experiment was not a successful one in his own universe.”
“JARVIS. Lights fifty percent.” The voice came not from Steve’s left, where Tony had been sleeping peacefully only minutes before, but away from the bed entirely. When JARVIS obeyed the instruction and coated the room in soft yellow light, it revealed Tony half dressed next to one of the walk in closets, slipping a pair of sweatpants over his narrow hips.
After some extended discussions and negotiation, Rhodes had decided to stay too. Like during Tony’s punishment he had elected strictly to observe. A glance (not Steve’s first, he couldn’t quite seem to stop looking Rhodey’s way) revealed that James had made himself comfortable in an armchair, which he’d pulled over to beside the aftercare area. He was still dressed, but he’d changed into a pair of form-fitting jeans and a clinging purple shirt, both of which were so unlike his everyday style that they were nearly as affecting as if the guy had turned up naked. When Natasha glided over to hand Rhodey the rope for his own inspection James grinned. For just a second Steve was positive Natasha actually blushed in response.
Whether Pepper was planning to admit it or not, it was obvious that they had succeeded. There was a tremor to her voice that hadn’t been there seconds before, one that reminded Tony painfully of his own Pepper in the early days of Iron Man, when his coming home covered in bullet holes or being attacked on a raceway in Monaco was still new rather than the latest in a long line of potentially fatal absurdities. For just a few seconds he longed with painful intensity to fold her into his arms, comfort her the way he used to back before Ultron, when she’d been able to suspend disbelief at the notion that Tony might ever one day truly separate himself from Iron Man. The temptation faded after a few seconds, leaving behind only a bittersweet ache beneath his ribs. (It was better this way. For both of them.)
“I haven’t been leaving snacks out for you to graze on the way I was in the Tower, have I? I’m sorry, Tony.”
that’s not a challenge for you,” Clint complained as he made a beeline for a table set up with a host of food and hydration options. The neurotic level of organization of said roughage practically screamed Coulson, and Tony was unsurprised to find the man himself seated behind the table like a parent at a bakesale—except for the fact that he was in a suit bespoke enough to be confused for one of Tony’s less expensive pieces, and taking notes on a tablet while shooting Clint that dry, bemused stare.
I think that's it? As always, though, feel free to let me know if you have questions or concerns, or want to see additional tags added to the list.
“You. You’re exactly what I need, actually. Muffins in exchange for an assist, Cap?” Steve gulped, hand nearly tearing through the cardboard carton of orange juice he’d just picked up. (
The one good thing about somehow having managed to be humiliated by his own intelligence the day before was that he was already devoid of fucks to give when he arrived at Avengers Tower on Friday afternoon. JARVIS greeted him by name, which had already become disturbingly familiar, and glided smoothly down to the workshop levels.
“I’ll get your coffee, and I’ll even text Phil to bring up the gluten-free bagels I’m positive he snuck out of the Tower for this morning, if you tell me us why you’re limping and what it is you’re looking for.” So Natasha was still annoyingly observant—the consistency was oddly comforting in the face of so many upsets of his expectations. Though his version never would have offered Tony a trade; she would have continued watching and learning in silence until she had the intel she need, then clobbered him with it. (Fuck, it was so much harder being around these two than it had been to be with Bruce the day before. The latter’s only real crime had been his absence. These two…how was he supposed to stop seeing their uncanny counterparts with the same faces, the same mannerisms, who had lived with him and fought with him and still never really cared for Tony at all, not until the end when it had been too damn late…)
“Colonel Rhodes has indicated that you are not to consume more coffee until you have eaten a full meal and drank a litre of water, Sir. He has used his override commands and if you attempt to turn on the pot I will be forced to shut down power to the outlet.” Rhodey, Tony decided, was an interfering snoop. When he went back to the bedroom, which he’d be doing as soon as was damn possible, he was gonna—
They loaded their bowls with cereal. Tony would have guessed Coulson would be a strictly one cereal at a time kind of guy, but he turned out to be a master of combining flavours that should never have worked together, like Reese’s Puffs and Cap’n Crunch. Tony happily followed his lead, and then settled onto the loveseat next to Coulson. Phil kept up a dry commentary about what he’d do if he were the Scoobies’ handler, his suggestions so entirely Agent Coulson of him that Tony very nearly spat cereal onto the floor on three separate occasions. He countered with ideas about their tech, and the unlikely crime-fighting duo potential of Scooby and Dummy. It was exactly the kind of irreverent, fluffy conversation Tony hadn’t realized he’d been missing until Coulson had provided.
While Natasha glided soundlessly to the table and removed a place setting, Steve pulled out a chair for May. Clint, who had come to absolutely adore May in recent weeks, served her a heaping plate full of anything she so much as glanced at. The conversation limped forward a bit awkwardly at first; both Tony and May were so occupied with trying to pretend not to be overly affected by Peter’s absence that they were neither of them at their social best. But eventually Steve started a conversation about medicine. May loved her work enough that she couldn’t help but be drawn in, and soon they were trading podcast recommendations and bemoaning the rise of psuedo-scientific ‘treatments’ like old friends.
After their scene, Tony and the rest of the team appear to be on cloud nine. Naturally, Steve panics.
“Not sure I want your cast-off breakfast,” he stalled for time. Tony grinned and pulled a cloth from the top of a basket of homemade mini blueberry bran muffins. Steve's stomach growled.
“Sir, I believe you meant to contact our HR department. The CEO of Stark Industries is not directly involved in—”
“Any further actions will be negotiated as they are required, Princess. I suggest that we not get ahead of ourselves.”
I have to admit my own role has left me more conflicted than I had anticipated. I have done precisely as I should have, protecting the Stones, reality, and the greatest number of people possible. Yet I wish there had been another option. Stark’s sacrifice should not have been necessary, and many of those he sought assistance from in the early days of Thanos’s efforts know this, and have no choice but to live with that regret.
Tony made made it through the entirety of the conversation without displaying much emotion. Exhaustion was good for that, sometimes, making tears or panic too difficult to generate. But that…that wrenched a single, dry sob out of him.
Ah, Ms. Everhart. Now of course, we know from previous visions that Christine Everhart was unintentionally involved in the outing of the D/s version of Tony Stark.
“They’re gorgeous,” he said honestly, reaching out and running his fingers over cool glass and brushed metal. There was a wide range of styles and, likely, price points. It was nothing at all like his own carefully curated collection in his own world. But there was something oddly beautiful about the chaos of what he was certain was a $20,000 watch lying next to one that had all the numbers jumbled at the bottom of the face and text reading 'Whatever, I'm late anyway' printed across the top.
Sam mostly leaves that bit of domestic drama alone for the time being, though he does insist that every one of them eats dinner together every night. He decides to focus his attention on the wildcard in this scenario: Bucky, who is utterly furious with Steve for reasons none of them seem to fully understand.
Despite the innuendo, Tony turned out to be entirely serious about showing off the suit in action. After allowing himself a few moments of stunned silence, Coulson organized it: they took Tony on one-by-one, each for fifteen minutes.
Peter was still downstairs when Steve finally made his entrance. The guy looked exhausted the way he always did these days, and Peter could see the outline of the EDITH glasses in the pocket of his plaid button-up. From what Peter could tell Steve never went anywhere without them, and he seemed to spend the majority of his days tracking down any and all potential problems flagged by the system.
This project is a coordinated global and multi-institutional effort, designed to follow-up on and extend the work completed in the 1960s under Howard Stark’s supervision.
“No, I want to try it,” Tony interrupted before he could lose his nerve. “But you’ll help me, right? I still don’t want to hurt anyone, and if Thor doesn’t want this—” Clint leaned forward and kissed him again, and Tony let himself become a bit more aggressive in response than he normally would, thrusting his tongue into Clint’s mouth and biting at his bottom lip. When they clawed their way apart, Clint’s eyes were sparkling with mischief.
Two hours later, Tony swept his way onto Steve’s floor with blustering anger, which was already somewhat undermined by the fact that he was flanked by Dummy on one side and Drama on the other. The t-shirt that he’d taken off into the shop wearing that morning was also covered in some kind of bright and viscous purple fluid that made him rather resemble the dinosaur from a child’s TV show Clint had once made Steve watch. In short, Tony made a thoroughly unintimidating and rather adorable sight, and the fact that he seemed to know it only made him angrier.
After that rather depressing thought had occurred to him, Tony couldn’t un-think it. His mind obsessed about nothing else, making it rather difficult to concentrate on what he knew was a crucial conversation about his and the team’s future. Eventually, Pepper halted mid-sentence and stared at Tony. He braced himself for any number of difficult questions, none of which came. She turned in her seat and addressed herself to Clint instead.
Though usually much less predictable about timing, the rest of the team had already been gathered in the expansive living room for forty-five minutes, ostensibly to have breakfast together, but mostly because none of them wanted to miss it if Tony happened to arrive early. By silent consensus, they’d agreed not to acknowledge their own absurdity, which at least meant no one (Clint) ended up throwing food at anyone else (Thor.) Poisoning attempts (Natasha) were also thankfully absent thus far, though Steve had definitely planned to stop accepting any food or drink from her should Tony end up late for any reason.
When they touched down on the roof of the Tower, Coulson and Tony were both waiting. Steve let the others disembark, and watched from the window as Coulson indulged in a rare show of semi-public affection long enough to lean down over the stretcher and press a kiss to Clint’s forehead, and then another to Natasha’s. He meant to get up and follow them, he really did. But every time he tried to make his legs bend to stand, his eyes found Tony.
“It’s partly a power thing, of course. A way for you to start to get into the right headspace for a scene. I also like my subs naked whenever possible because I read people’s body language for a living. You’ll tell me just as much with what makes you tense up, or cringe, or shudder, or get hard as you will with the words you use. Sometimes more if you’re being recalcitrant.”
“I tried to tell them that you were feinting about the bloodwork. But even Pepper was fooled this time.” He pitched his voice high in an imitation that would undoubtedly earn him a smack if Pepper were ever to hear of it. “‘Oh James, he’s just scared, don’t you understand?’ None of ‘em seemed to get that the first thing any version of Tony Stark is gonna do when he’s really scared is gather as much data as he can get his hands on.”
“I mean, he wasn’t always bad. He was able to lift Thor’s hammer in the end, and that’s supposed to be some sort of magically-objective measure of worth, right?”
Tony was charming, dammit, and his commentary was excellent. Last week he’d gotten Steve to do a spit-take when he’d hacked the accounts of the senator Steve was arguing with and started reading from the GoFundMe page the guy had made to attempt to fund his lavish wedding. And yet somehow he still found himself looming around outside Pepper’s office, trying to decide whether he would get in trouble for invading the R&D department for the fourth time in as many weeks.
“Natasha, none of you are going to be left behind or forgotten because there is a full-time submissive back in this Tower. I know that once upon a time all you and Clint had to rely on was each other, but you will never be back at that place, not ever again. Do you understand me?”
“I know you would. I know. And having that option is kind of fucking incredible. But now I have this whole Tower full of people all working so hard to ensure I have something outside the suit. I’m Iron Man, but I’m not
in the in the simpering, honeyed tones of an adult playing at being a guilty child, and Tony’s teeth felt like they were about to start rotting in his gums. Idly, he wondered whether this long-game thing was really the way to go when there were so many excellent assassins in the Tower.
“You’re not intruding. Do you want to talk about it, or just pretend I’m not here?” Clint didn’t give a verbal answer, but his arm darted out to wrap around Tony’s waist, so moving really wasn’t an option. “What’d Phil ask you to do?”
This time, Bruce offered a piece of cut up bell pepper accompanied by a buttermilk ranch dip. Tony at least succeeded at not gnawing on the guy like an animal this time, though when a bit of the dip came off the pepper he reflexively swiped it off Bruce’s finger with his tongue. As soon as he did he glanced at Bruce in apology, but the other man just smiled and repeated,
Rhodes watched the entire exchange with an inscrutable expression that Steve suspected covered a thought process very nearly as complex and multi-layered as Tony’s.
Like all forms of submission, it was a gift that he was offering Steve, one made even more precious for its relative rarity. Certainly any other member of the team would be thrilled to have Clint like this; they definitely wouldn’t be fighting the urge to slip away into their own heads even while working a thick dildo into Clint’s ass the way Steve was.
(The loss of her prints didn’t seem to bother Natasha, or cause her any pain. Hell, it was an undeniable boon in the business they were in, which was why the Red Room had done it to her in the first place. But Steve had often wondered whether that wasn’t worse in some ways, to lose a primal marker of identity in such a way designed to erase the trauma of the loss itself. No scars, no bruises. Just a blankness where a something should have been.)
There was nothing to say to that, no words of comfort Rhodey could offer that wouldn’t seem trite or ludicrously insufficient. So he wrapped a heavy arm around her shoulders and held her, the same as he had for countless nights when the other version of Tony had died. Just as she mostly hadn’t then, she didn’t cry now, but the depth of her feelings was no less apparent in the harshness of her breath and the lines on her face. After a while, she leaned up to kiss his cheek and then stood, preparing to return to her own floor.
Clint’s hand darted out to encircle Tony’s wrist. (He wondered if Clint was even conscious of the way that his fingers automatically found Tony’s pulse point, or if after so many years at SHIELD it was more an involuntary reflex than anything.)
“I just…how does anyone do this when they haven’t done these things? It’s asking about specific implements and tools and really raunchy sex that even I haven’t had the chance to fool around with yet. And I…Rhodey suggested….I mean, I watched some porn, but I still don’t know. It’s totally possible to like watching something happen to someone else, or even imagine it happening to you, but then not want it for yourself, right?”
As for Captain Rogers in the so-called MCU, well…it is probably for the best that I show you. Thinking about Stark in a romantic context always leaves me wishing for some kind of decontamination shower.
“So he can argue the repairs fall under his company’s jurisdiction too. Fuck, I hate this guy already. Gimme the ramrod. Gotta clean this mess up and make sure it doesn’t explode on us before I rip this shit off my beautiful suit with my bare hands. See, Agent Agent? Safety first!”
The thing people didn’t understand about so-called True Dominance was how completely powerless you were so much of the time. Steve’s entire world, filled with a complex array of concerns just moments before, narrowed in an instant. There was nothing that mattered beyond reassuring his submissive, nothing that could possibly matter more than keeping him here, soft and sweet and devoid of worry, for as long as possible. He peeled off his workout gear (he still wouldn’t permit anything sexual without a date, but skin to skin would be better when Tony was down this far) and strode further into the living room.
All other members of the team are switches. Clint Barton, as you know, was classified as a switch at category 6. Natasha Romanov and James Barnes are both officially classified as 5s, though Captain Rogers had voiced a suspicion that his experiences with HYDRA may have forced Barnes down a level. He has never been tested to confirm. Phil Coulson is ranked at a category 4, and was the closest the team had to a submissive after their Stark’s death.
Otherwise, nothing else I can think of. As always, feel free to let me know if you have questions or concerns about tagging or warnings.
“Look, I’m pretty tired from the move. Thanks for the pizza, but I think I’m going to take the rest of it and eat in bed, then pass out watching TikTok or something. Goodnight, Steve.”
They went several rounds like that, Natasha trying to calm him and redirect his attention and Tony focused on the only thing that felt like it might actually help. Seeming to realize her efforts were pointless, Natasha’s look of frustration morphed into the calculating, thoughtful expression Tony recognized from missions.
“No. Saw a video though. Watched that big metal arm crush my mother’s throat. And then when I went after Barnes for it, Rogers put his shield through my chest and the two of yo-them left me in Siberia to…well, die sounds dramatic, but with a disabled suit in the middle of a Hydra base I’m not sure what else they thought I was going to do.”
“If you messed with my Tower or my AI—” He stopped mid-sentence, recalling with a start that neither of the two items he’d listed could accurately be referred to as his, and that doing so might piss his date off. Clint, however, just laughed and nudged him through the door.
“Best I can figure, Taskmaster’s backers are starting to get antsy. Tony put them on watch last week. He told them that he knows what they’ve been doing, and that he’s going to expose them one way or another as soon as he can.”
“We’re supposed to wait to scene, so that you know we value you regardless of what your relationship to submission is. I know that.” Tony blinked, fighting back a bit of hurt at the strength of Steve’s aversion to scening with him.
“You’re evil,” he informed her. They’d been trying to talk Steve into joining them for a team movie night since he’d gotten back from Wakanda, but that had been a tradition they’d held with
“We haven’t been on a date yet.” He gestured vaguely at Tony, who took longer than he probably should have to realize he was clad only in boxers. To be fair, he’d never been a particularly modest guy to begin with, and when you’d lived as he had with his insides basically on the outside in the form of the arc reactor, a few scraps of clothing here and there ceased to mean much by comparison. Still, the temptation to mock or snark he might have once felt was largely eclipsed by a painful fondness for the very fact of Steve, someone still capable of blushing at the mention of a new partner’s near-nudity.
By the end of it, Pepper looked exhausted and exhilarated, the exact way Tony felt after a particularly generative session in the workshop. As they said their goodbyes and made plans to meet again later in the week to begin the long process of turning the half-formed list of dreams into an actual workable set of objectives, he wondered why he didn’t quite feel the same. Oh he was more excited about the future of SI than he had been in a long time, and he looked forward to exploring so many of the areas that his people had listed. These were the kinds of projects he’d dreamed about, and then promptly had to abandon in his own universe once the looming threat of Thanos and the War had begun to monopolize all of his time and energy.
“You’re seeing a Dom these days, right?” he couldn’t help but ask. Pepper nodded. “Good. Call them.”
Though he was repeatedly assured after the fact that he didn’t entirely lose consciousness, Tony’s memory of the next hour and change following the scene with Steve was hazy at best. The next thing he was really aware of was the sound of a vaguely familiar movie, and of  being held in a set of arms that, while extremely familiar, didn’t make sense in this context.
“I…the team. I was imagining them here. Want them to see you like this, remember that you need the Dominance too, that you’re so goddamn good at it. And I want—I want—”
,” Peter spat with a betrayal and a hurt so strong it made Steve weirdly optimistic, because if Peter was as disinterested in a relationship with Tony as he’d been trying to pretend, he wouldn’t be this upset. “I should have fucking known there was a catch, good ol’ Parker luck, there’s
“You start. I know you two have been spending a lot of time together lately. Tell me everything that’s happened in the last week, whether you think it’s relevant or not.”
“I know, Tony. I understand.” Clint almost never called him by name; especially when Tony was anywhere near subspace, it was Sugar Cookie or some other absurd endearment that Tony despised almost as much as he loved. What felt like a formality from Clint was enough to signal that whatever this was, it was something else. Something different. “Way back at the beginning, we discussed giving you the opportunity to experiment with Domination. But at that point we had so much other stuff going on, and since you didn’t seem to feel particularly urgently about trying your hand at Domming, we put it on the back burner. You seem like you need
, really. So the idea of getting to do it somewhere like this, that’s part of the city but sort of—I don’t know, softened a little? That feels really good to me.”
This time Clint couldn’t mask his surprise, or his interest. Tony’s stomach dropped at the eager way the other man abandoned his pencil and leapt to his feet, because he really didn’t want to get into the whole thing with the stones, or inventing time travel, or what it had been like to see his Dad…god, why had he brought this up?
“Quit it, brat. Ain’t nothin’ going on right now that requires you to see. And trust me, if you push too much too fast you’ll end up with a vicious migraine. Just sit up a little—yeah, perfect, that angle’s fine. Open your mouth for me now.”
“Steeeeeeeeeeeeeve—”Sam hopped up onto the island and took a long swig of beer as he smirked. After a while of the team harassing Steve to try to pick up Thor’s hammer, Sam added,
“You can do this, Tony. Just close your eyes and lay back against me for a second, okay?” Tony did as instructed, moaning low in his throat when Steve’s hands combed through his hair. “What’s something you want to make, just for the sake of it?”
And to top off the truly horrible day he’d had trying to put fires out at SHIELD all day over the Wakandan orientation program, his therapist had given him
“I’m not interested,” he growled. He knew he was being unfair, but Steve was beyond caring. He wished absently that he’d been allowed to shower before the ssesion; he felt like he could still smell traces of the salve he’d put on Tony’s side last night, and his brain seemed to be taking this as an invitation to keep replaying remembering what it had felt like to put hands on Tony after so long. He was tired and angry and defensive and confused, and not remotely in the right frame of mind for this.
Tony felt himself flush a deep, splotchy shade of scarlet, and let his head hang. He still loved handfeeding just as much as he had that very first time, but god was it embarrassing, especially since it always put him into at least a low level of subspace. And the food thing in general, it was just plain shameful to need to be monitored like this. Now Bruce or another member of the team was going to be forced to abandon urgent and important work just to fucking feed him twice a day?
“And why bother explaining them, right? Way easier to just threaten to have an Iron Man suit carry me home!”
Much of what he seems to value about submission and about how the team operates with him is how very seen and known he is. So much of his time with the MCU version of the team was spent with them talking around one another, and Stark especially fell prey to others making assumptions and projections onto him rather than actually taking the time and effort involved in getting to know him.
Content Notes: There's a semi-graphic description of what active starvation feels like; folks with disordered eating or other triggers around this area might want to give it a pass. (Just skip the paragraph that begins "The thing Tony had learned about starvation...")
Tony had somehow managed to extricate himself from the multiple pairs of arms that had held him through the night without waking anyone; given that those limbs belonged to spies and soldiers who could be brought from dead sleep to full consciousness by the merest hint of a whisper, he felt this deserved some kind of recognition. Instead, he cast a fond look at the three figures on the bed (Nat, Steve and Clint had been the only ones to claim they were tired at the absurdly early hour that Tony had been shuttled off to bed), who were already reaching out to one another in sleep to fill the gap Tony’s exit had produced.
“Phoenix. Right. Well, there’ll be no risin’ up for you this time, but that’s for the best, hmm? You obviously didn’t come back all right this time. I’ve known it for weeks, tried to convince my ‘sponsors’ to come at you on that front, but well, none of you rich bastards want to take input from the hired help. Anyway, way I see it, I’m puttin’ you outta your misery. The massive payday I’m gonna see is just a bonus, that’s all.”
“Sounds like a standard exploratory contract. We teach kids how to fill ‘em out in their teens, Tones.”
“Yes, Sir,” she whispered. Bruce petted her hair until the tears stopped, and then helped her sit up.
As the team’s handler, Phil had been selected to be the first to read and review the file Tony had sent over the previous afternoon. Given that spies were essentially professional snoops by nature, he had been undeniably relieved by the choice at first; now that he had the entire team staring at him, rapt and anxious, he was rethinking that reaction. He had held actual magical artifacts before that made him feel less like he held the fate of the universe in his grasp than he did right now.
The shop was the best place in the world. There was always something incredible happening; Dad would work on new designs for the shield (for when he found Cap), and he’d talk to Tony about vibranium and everything that made it such a unique, unreproduceable substance. Or he’d work on his flying car, which was going to be perfect one day as soon as he stabilized the repulsor technology. Or he’d make new weapons that helped keep kids like Tony safe in their beds at night. Tony liked all of those things, but what he liked most of all was how his Dad was down here: attentive, happy, alive in a way he never really seemed to be anyplace else.
“I apologize for intruding,” he greeted Steve. “I required your attention without our submissive, and as you are rarely apart these days, I chose to act when I could.” Steve was rapidly leaving the 'mildly' part of 'mildly concerned' behind, his mind already spinning potential options for the source of Thor’s upset even as he sat down on the bed and patted the spot next to him.
Dummy completed another lap of the penthouse, ending up at the elevator doors with a truly pathetic little whirring noise. From the couch, Barnes made an answering sound that sounded as if the air had been punched from his gut. This was the final straw.
“If you’re going in the suit is going with you. That’s the deal. There’s no way those goons that attacked the Avengers a couple of weeks ago saying they were practicing for me weren’t backed by SI. They’re coming for me because they think I’m the way to get to Steve, and if that’s the case then there’s no way someone hasn’t put together that you’re a way to get to me, one that has the added benefit of removing a powerful dissenting voice at SI. I failed you—her once. Fucking up twice the same way is just plain laziness.”
“The prep we did with the toys made me want to try an extended fingering scene. I’ve been thinking about it since Bruce milked you, actually, but seeing you play with yourself like that…yeah. I’d love to keep you over my lap for a couple hours, just playing with your pretty ass and seeing how many times I could get you to come just from my fingers. Maybe let some of the team watch.” Tony yelped as his hand slipped out from under him, but Steve had him gripped around the waist long before his face even came near the water. “That a yes then?”
“The General anticipated you might decline her invitation, and asked that I remind you of the time-sensitive documents you requested that the two of you review together.” Steve drew a blank for a long few seconds (another bad sign, cognitive processes starting to slow down), then nearly smacked his hand to his forehead in a gesture belonging far more to his 40s self than his current status. Masdee and Talia’s contract.
I am obliged to note that this same sense of being known and seen is also what Stark struggles with the most with regards to submission. In a matter of months, all of his regular defenses and masks have been effectively torn away. Hiding himself in all the ways Stark once did was exhausting, of course, but their loss amounts to nothing less than a seismic shift in his way of being in the world, and he finds the vulnerability involved in not just scenes but his day-to-day life as challenging as it is rewarding.
“No,” he said, half surprised at how sure he was at the answer. He had some work to do (didn’t they all?) but he trusted himself enough to do it.
War hero. Genius. Philanthropist. For decades, the legend of Howard Stark has been used as a yardstick by which American ingenuity, innovation and business-savvy have been measured. Even Stark’s critics have been willing to concede that his alleged personal failings were far outweighed by the numerous and substantial legacies he left behind. How, after all, could the man who gave us Captain America as well as aiding in the country’s decisive victory in the Second World War, truly be anything but a hero?
This week was a little rough, and the editing quality of this chapter may very well reflect that. I'll likely come back in and edit goofs in the next couple of days, but it was a choice between getting the rough version up today and not posting, and several of you have remarked how comforting you find the routine posting schedule of this story, so I'm doing my very best to stick to it.
“You’re letting yourself feel all of it now. It’s going to take time; remaking yourself always does.” She didn’t offer anything else, nor did Natasha ask any questions about what had precipitated the panic attack. She just stayed there next to Tony, her grip on his arm solid but undemanding, and let him collect himself.
Whatever the case, Tony appeared to be entirely on his own, which was probably why he was seated not on a chair, but on the island that dominated the centre of the kitchen. His legs dangled loosely off the edge, and he looked, there was no other way to say it, thoroughly well-fucked. His hair was mussed in that way it only got when Tony had spent a lot of time writhing against a pillow, his bottom lip was swollen and raw from where he’d bitten it, and he wiggled in place every few seconds as if unable to comfortably remain still. Having a sight to accompany the passionate soundtrack he’d heard the day before was more temptation than Steve had anticipated when he’d chosen to venture into the penthouse, but he was still confident that he’d be able to make it through. (Even if Tony was wearing Steve’s sweater. Again. Still. Had he been wearing it when he’d touched himself the day before?)
“Go back to sleep, Tony. I’m fine.” It was not, Steve could admit to himself, his best attempt at a cover-up, given that he was still visibly shuddering despite the perpetually elevated core body temperature ensured by the serum. (Natasha, who had spent all that time training him in espionage, would be downright shamed of the effort.) To be fair, this was the fourth time in as many days that Steve had woken with a start like this, a scream that was a torn, broken version of Tony’s name still on his lips. He was pretty much out of excuses.
He quickly grew less fond of her methods when it became clear that she was lobbing the easiest questions Peter’s way. Doubtless it was another attempt at making Peter feel included, asking him questions that he was almost guaranteed to know, but it was humiliating to realize that Liz thought so little of him. After the third such softball (“The first colony to gain independence in Africa in 1951 was…”) Flash began to clap sarcastically every time Peter responded correctly. Liz looked miserable and defeated; Peter began to wonder whether or not being forced to transfer schools would really be so bad. There was a rustling of papers and a disgruntled ‘hey!’ in the background, but he didn’t pay much attention until a pair of fingers was snapped in his face. The fingers turned out to belong to a girl with long, curly hair and a t-shirt featuring a scowling woman on it. She had been late for the round of introductions that had started off the meeting, but she was the only one (aside from Peter) who hadn’t gotten a single question wrong during the session.
Tony wanted to cover his own face and hide from the disapproval he knew was coming. He was still fuzzy on some of the more nuanced rules in this universe, but one thing he was crystal clear on was that subs were not supposed to go down into any kind of serious headspace, especially one involving any kind of tools or scenes that could be harmful, without a Dom or a Switch in the right headspace present to supervise. Natasha appeared to know she was in trouble too, because despite the lightness she was forcing into her tone, she had started to squirm on the bench.
Hulk grunted out a skeptical ‘pah,’ but thudded in the direction that Tony had instructed and deposited his handfuls of civilians. Tony intended to shut up after that, content in the knowledge that the most visceral parts of Bruce’s psyche still trusted him. But then Clint got that look in his eye that meant he was under a minute from jumping off something high, and neither Thor nor Rhodey were near enough to catch him.
He felt nauseous by the time he finally made it through them all. Of course he was glad that Tony and the team had been able to find a balance that allowed Tony the submission he needed without sacrificing any of the wonderful things that made him who he was. But did people seriously believe that if Tony had decided to pursue another option, rejecting his submission while remaining physically and mentally well, Steve would have tried to stop him? Sure he would have been heartbroken, but it wasn’t his decision to make for Tony or for anyone.
“If you want me to go, man, I will. We all want you comfortable, alright? But like I tried to tell you when you were stayin’ with me, it’s perfectly natural for a sub to need to let their skin breathe. I’m not gonna find it weird or feel remotely uncomfortable to be around you when you’re naked, Tones. Your call.”
Rhodey woke Tony up at an obscenely early hour. This, Tony felt, could and should be grounds for treason, especially given how late he and Natasha had stayed up playing Splatoon the night before. However, his more violent impulses were tempered somewhat by the fact that said wake-up involved Rhodey sliding into bed next to Tony and letting him cuddle up against him like a heat-seeking missile. (So sue him, Tony had gotten used to sleeping with at least one person. The chance to starfish in his huge bed every once in a while was nice, but he did tend to wake up chilly the next day.)
Steve didn’t have time to take in Natasha’s cryptic news before his own phone was sounding an alert. When he was on holiday, almost all of his notifications were turned off; it took what was classified at SHIELD as a major or significant event to override the revised chain of communication and push a message through.
“Tony was never trained to be ashamed of his submission,” Bucky had said early on in the process. “He can be conflicted about particular scenes or tools sometimes, but that’s not ultimately about the submission itself. He’s…if anything, his biggest fear is people being ashamed or reluctant to love him. The worst thing we could do is make the collar small and easy to hide.”
Tony looked overwhelmed by the positive assessment; Steve’s smile threatened to split his face in two.
“No. I just don’t need a goddamn sweater.” Far from getting Steve to back off, this was enough to have him crossing the room and tilting Tony’s head up by the chin in a silent demand for eye contact. Tony stared obstinately off to the side, though this backfired slightly when Dummy rolled into his line of sight and issued a long, curious beep. (Ugh. Tony really couldn’t get away from the questions in this place.)
“Yes. I’m ready. If he wants to rabbit, I plan to let him. Backing Tony into a corner almost never works. He just gets defensive, lashes out. But he’s also too honest to lie or avoid an issue forever. I won’t let him stew for long; if I’m wrong I don’t want him to end up working himself into a panic or another workshop binge. But I don’t think he will. He’ll come to me; JARVIS, make sure to find some kind of subtle way to let him know I’m working from home today, yeah?”
“Sweetheart, you need to sleep,” Steve tried anyway, because how could he not? How could he possibly leave his partner and submissive in pain so acute that even bearing witness to it was one of the most difficult things Steve had ever done? Even if Steve weren’t, as most people who knew him would attest, the most stubborn bastard alive, he didn’t think any decent person could just walk away after seeing Tony like this. “All his vitals are stable, and the doctors are all saying they should remain that way. He’s going to be okay. I promise I’ll watch the monitors while you rest and wake you up if there’s any changes.”
Containing Peter’s body only seemed to intensify his anger, so Steve loosened his grip just enough that the boy could feel it and act. In seconds they were both their feet, and Peter had slammed him against a wall.  (They would be lucky if they made it out of this without having to pay the motel for structural damages.)
“Yeah, Bruce mentioned you had a few misguided ideas about how sexism and orientational discrimination might intersect,” Natasha said. Her voice was oddly gentle, not a hint of anger even though what Tony was implying was probably considered deeply offensive. “It’s not all hearts and flowers over here, but you have to realize that about 70 percent of the population requires some degree of submission in their lives to function properly. It’s not considered a weakness. Arrangements like ours, where a Dom or dominant-inclined Switch works directly under their sub or sub-inclined Switch during the day might be more rare, but still no one would ever question Phil’s ability to do his job simply because he needs to be at our feet sometimes.”
Clearly, Peter thought wryly, the multiple discussions that all of his nearest and dearest had been forced to endure about enhanced cybersecurity in the wake of Peter’s outing as Spider-Man had not been lost on Ned. MJ had replied to this with an eyeroll emoji, but then added,
“Oh good, there are witnesses,” Peter grumbles. His half-hearted efforts to escape become a bit more forceful, however, once he realizes where they’re going. “This is Steve’s room! I’ve never—shouldn’t we at least have FRIDAY ask if he’s available?”
Sam was silent for a few agonizing seconds where Steve wondered if he'd managed to overstep. Then he brushed the sand off the seashell and slid it into his pocket.
The extent to which it is likely that Stark will, as you put it, overindulge in his headspace is likely going to be tied to how quickly and how far the subtonin in his system goes on to rise. Currently, he takes a full day off from the submission on Thursdays, and this would be exceedingly rare for a ‘true’ submissive. However, we are already seeing some ways in which his needs as submissive are not quite as intensive. Stark himself noted, for instance, that the aftercare the team provided didn’t feel as urgent as the way it has in the past.
Some not insignificant part of Tony had truly believed that after he admitted to Barnes that he’d probably be sticking around in this universe, things with the team would start to change. It wouldn’t be anything overly dramatic or sudden. They’d start pointing out all the ways in which he was failing to live up to his dead doppleganger, maybe, or start hinting about how Tony could start making himself useful around here with weapons or tech upgrades. He wouldn’t honestly blame them, especially for the latter; hell, even if he was still kind of enjoying this unexpected vacation, it was only a matter of time before Tony was going to get bored and have to find some way to fill his days.
And that was the million dollar question, wasn’t it? Some of the team had been in favour of giving Tony a collar before they’d left the Malibu house. Steve himself had been all in favour, in fact. But then Tony had needed time to recover physically and emotionally from his first major punishment, and there had been Rhodey’s joining them to handle, and then Peter’s injury, and Tony’s ongoing efforts to learn about his own submission. It just hadn’t felt like the right time to ask for another major commitment, no matter how crazy it was starting to drive Steve to see Tony’s throat bare. (He at least still always had on one of the watches they’d given him, which did soothe the deeply possessive parts of Steve’s Dominant hindbrain.)
He could, of course, just stay out on his own. Tony was still learning how to navigate the truly absurd amount of press attention his every move attracted, though, and much like the Tower, the New York of this world was exactly like his own except in the ways it wasn’t. He didn’t want to risk getting lost, or trying to get somewhere that didn’t exist and drawing attention to himself. No, he wasn’t quite brave enough to face this universe alone yet.
The point was, what Tony Stark was doing was decent and all. Peter certainly appreciated his help with the mounting pile of medical bills that had been threatening to swallow May and him whole. He’d also used the rather flimsy excuse of the internship to get them both on SI’s benefits plan, which meant that any future Spider-Man mishaps would be covered. The idea of being able to just walk into an emergency room and get treated when he needed it, rather than waiting with growing desperation to see if his injuries would become manageable without any external interventions, felt like an almost unfathomable luxury. Unfortunately Peter couldn’t rid himself of the suspicion that this was all happening too late. Too late for him to catch up in school. Too late to repair the relationships he’d strained and in some cases broken. And definitely too late to be building something new, some kind of makeshift family, with the Avengers. Sometimes it was enough to make him resent Stark. Why couldn’t he have just stayed forever fixed in Peter’s memory as the larger-than-life hero who had saved his life at the Stark Expo and then flown away, all while letting kid!Peter believe he had been the one to do the saving? Why did Stark have to make Peter hope, when its absence had been the one constant these past few years?
For several long seconds, the two of them stared at one another. It was unclear which of them was more surprised by Peter’s outburst. Peter was considering what it would actually take to dig a tunnel through the floor (it was Hulk-reinforced, so unfortunately probably a lot) when JARVIS alerted Tony to the fact that the vibranium they were heating into an ore was currently in danger of burning. The fact that Peter’s tantrum had distracted Tony to the point of nearly ruining the most expensive and precious material on the planet was almost unthinkable, and it made Peter’s concerns about losing the guy feel suddenly laughable.
“You can offer pleasure to whomever you’d like, whenever you’d like. It doesn’t even have to be to one of the Dominants that’s actively involved in the scene. But to give it, you have to be willing to accept it in return. Until you are…” She gestured again, this time to a large bench that hadn’t been in the room that morning, at least not unfolded and in the centre of the space as it currently was. In basic function, it looked to be similar to the spanking bench they’d had him on in Malibu. But where that had been a fairly functional piece of furniture, this one practically oozed comfort. That felt like a strange thing to think about something designed for positioning a person to receive pain of one form another, but it was true. The leather looked softer and thicker than the other bench, the padding more substantial. There was nothing metal or harsh; even the buckles on the restraints were covered. They’d had this made for him, he was sure of it, and it definitely hadn’t been cheap. Bruce stood next to the bench, a brown leather riding crop held in his left hand.
“He’s not joking. Most of us live in perpetual hope and dread of him performing that little bit of witchcraft,” Clint said wryly, not a hint of concern or pity in his voice. “Un-pretzel just a little bit for us, honey, let Thor get a cloth in there to clean you up. I promise you can go right back to your koala impression as soon as we’re done.”
Ah, an excellent question. Part of the reason that the testing will take such an extended period of time even with the advanced nature of Wakandan medical technologies is that no one is entirely certain what they will find, or what the differences between the two universes might be. The Wakandan contingent is aware that Stark is not of this universe, but have not been told that he is not oriented in the ways that govern their universe. They will therefore not necessarily be looking specifically for those markers, but rather performing a broad sweep for any and all markers that indicate a variation between the two version of Tony Stark.
A loud crinkling of plastic wrapping from across the living room reminded Tony abruptly that he wasn’t alone. Thor was sprawled across the armchair, eating leftover Halloween candy and playing video games. (Even this was far too close an echo to the version of Thor he’d left behind.)
"Am I honestly trying to decide whether we screwed up the fate of the world for a second time based on Cap’s facial hair?" Or: the Tower receives an unexpected visitor.
The rest of the team assumed Tony had some kind of emotional hangover after the conversation with Peter. He let them believe it, mainly because the fact that Bucky had told them he had a headache that prevented him from joining in on that morning’s conversation made him fairly certain that the other Tony had never acknowledged the significance of this particular date with them. Several of them had to have known—Steve’s memory was a steel fucking trap, and Natasha and Phil always seemed to just know stuff—but like a lot of his deepest hurts, this appeared to have been something Mark II had preferred to cope with in private.
“I…have no idea what you mean,” Steve confessed. She smiled, but there was no joy in the expression. It was full of a resigned sadness that reminded Steve oddly of his mother.
chair.” It was the acceptance in Ned’s voice that did it. He’d already made peace with being supplanted by a man that Peter had known for all of five minutes, and even though he’d come here with the intention of keeping Ned as far away from the riskiness of superhero life as he could, Peter couldn’t just let that be true.
“That’s harsh,” Peter commented, before it occurred to him that perhaps a SHIELD employee important enough to just walk up to the Director and start rambling would not be interested in the opinion of a random kid.
“Same here—without the ankle, obviously. He and I and Bruce had a really intense scene that we wanted to let him recover and get a bit of distance from before we tried anything else,” Natasha confessed. Her hand was tracing the outline of the spot where one of her blades would be if she had her tac suit on, a sure sign that she was far more distressed than she was otherwise letting on.
Tony fought the punishment at first, which came as no surprise. Rhodey watched him try like hell to refuse to give Steve anything, saw the cocky curve of his lips and the stubborn set of his jaw as he steeled himself against the blows, too inexperienced to realize that the tension he was holding in his muscles would just make it hurt worse. Not that Steve needed the help; every hint of the hesitant, overly-polite man Rhodey had always known was vanished now under the smooth and absolute press of Dominance. He should have expected it of a True—after all Rhodey knew how completely the other Tony’s submission used to take him over when he finally let it—but the transformation was still a little startling.
He considered apologizing, then, for bringing them somewhere that might have been painful, but decided against it. Tony couldn’t keep being sorry for not being someone else; it was hard enough to stop screwing up on his own merits. He opted instead for pulling Bruce’s cool feet into his lap, holding them between his sun-warmed thighs as he took another bite of parfait. The absence of their usual routines still made Tony feel itchy and anxious, but Bruce clearly was not in any hurry to get away from him, and he was quiet in a way that suited Tony’s reflective mood, and eased his adjustment back to speaking after a night of silence. He was also terribly ticklish on his feet, which Tony couldn’t help playing with a couple of times once he made the happy discovery.
“I thought we could discuss how we’ll be spending the next few weeks before we all break off and start heading off to bed. Are you in a place to be able to do that, Tony?” A low, lazy grunt was the only reply their submissive gave them. “We thought a lot about how we would spend this time if we were lucky enough to get it. There are a few priority areas, we think, that all deserve some dedicated attention while we’re here, so we tried to develop a schedule that would see to all of those needs. In the mornings, you would have your check-ins with Bruce. For the first week you’ll spend the hour that follows with me, completing the homework you owe me as well as some additional writing tasks.” Tony muttered something anxious-sounding about Phil not needing pain to punish, and Coulson nodded unrepentantly. “In the afternoons, we thought we’d spend some time exploring your submission with you. Some days those might just be conversations—updating your contract, giving you space to ask any questions you have—but a lot of times we imagined more hands-on training. The kind of thing you would have received if you’d grown up here.”
He’d been absolutely foolish to let it get this bad. Masdee had warned him, had tried to send him home days ago, but then the Ssenjovu brothers had broken the perimeter of the palace. They’d gotten nowhere near Shuri, but T’Challa’s rage had been nearly beyond reason. It had taken Steve and several members of the dora to prevent him from ripping the men apart in their holding cells. And then there had been the details of the exchange program to finalize, and several meetings with other Wakandan officials that the government had asked Steve to take in exchange for promises to fast-track said program. Steve hadn’t fully realized just how severe the dep had gotten until Talia had stormed into his rooms and begun throwing his belongings haphazardly into his duffle bag.
He stretched out on his bed, groaning as a spring creaked audibly underneath him. He was just as frugal as his parents had raised him to be, and always insisted on staying on base for these kinds of trips rather than being put up in hotels, but his body was definitely missing the perfectly firm mattresses and expensive sheets of Tony’s house. Rolling his eyes at how soft he’d apparently become, Rhodey considered his options. He hadn’t been planning on having what amounted to a group chat with the entire team when he’d started this; he’d just wanted a quick update on Tony, really. They’d probably understand if he backed out, maybe even be grateful for the lack of a distraction.
So, good news! The fact that I am kind of living and breathing this verse at the moment combined with my having recently completed the other major story I was working on means I'm able to commit to updating this story every Friday for the foreseeable future. Yay!
“Can you at least tell me my options?” he tried. “If is it…I mean, I’ve been working with the assumption that I can’t return to my universe without screwing up all the things that sent me here in the first place. And now there’s the whole subtonin thing…is this whole choice thing really just academic?” Strange steepled his long fingers; as he considered his answer, a cup of what looked like perfectly-prepared coffee appeared next to Tony’s right hand. He swallowed it in two gulps.
“What, being threatened away from my own fight like a child? Why would I find that frustrating?” Peter snarked, unable to help himself. Rather than calming Peter down, Tony’s unprecedented vulnerability seconds before had him furious all over again.
