“Since when am I your hero?” Steve asked, curious in his expression, and, despite his earlier tension, he moved into the intimate space made available for him between Tony’s torso and his arm. Whether he intended it or not, Steve rested a hand against Tony’s arm, close enough that his thumb could absently brush across Tony’s bicep.
Someone in the back raised their hand and identified the author as Brené Brown. Stromwell gave her usual nod of acknowledgement, but as she turned to get the day started, she faced Steve. Unlike her characteristic intensity that demanded the very best of him, Stromwell looked pleased to see him.
that many days, it was a smaller part then. But let me tell you: every time I saw him, as often as he could, Steve would moan about how this was it, he was done. Loudly. Obnoxiously,” he added with an accusative glare at his unrepentant co-star. “No more Captain America, no more Captain America movies. So, when Coulson called and said they were interested in bringing me back for number four, I thought it was a prank.”
“Your best friend, you said?” Tony teased Steve, pulling back to watch him with an adoring smile. “So delightful.”
“The Ranger Challenge? That’s what you were doing this morning, the fucking
If Sharon or her friends thought of a comeback, Steve didn’t catch it. He turned on his heel - swinging just enough for the pteruges to lift without unintended flashing - and made his way through the crowd in search of his man.
“So, this is all science?” Tony wondered, enjoying a languid stretch before rolling closer to rub himself against Steve’s body. “I like science.”
“What are we even doing here, Buck? This is wrong, this is very, very wrong.”
“Let me, uh. Let’s get you out of that, yeah?” Tony murmured, trying not to freak out. Steve had to be in a bad way to willingly crawl into the wall-bed that nearly made him cry the day before.
If Tony hadn’t still been recovering from the night before, that alone would have worried him.
Besides the fact that the four victims were all young, attractive men interested in other men, there was little else that connected them. One was a part-time service attendant at a car wash who lived a closeted life at home with his parents, until he’d disappeared eight months ago. The next victim was an extroverted bartender at a grungy gay club in Harlem, until he, too, disappeared without a trace. Their remains had been found recently in the city, and written off as the inevitable end for queer runaway kids.
Tony stared after Steve, dumbfounded. “I guess thawing out is serious business.”
“Stark!” Steve snapped in a sudden rage. “Those are people! Living, breathing people like you and me. Hurting people is not a good time. Well, okay, sometimes it is…” he conceded quietly before returning to his point. “But they didn’t look like anything more than a bunch of desperate people trying not to starve. This is a future you’re celebrating?” he snarled at Tony and the Governor. “Shunning people in need because they’re not like you?”
Rhodey’s words caught in Steve’s mind like a flare, and he immediately looked up at Tony. Tony looked paler, and he wasn’t meeting anyone’s gaze: he stared down at the bar top with unseeing eyes, clearly off in his own thoughts.
Steve paused in the act of stirring the frosting, and sure enough, he could just make out the familiar tune of his ringtone. He excused himself quickly to the living room where he’d been staring at all the Stark family photos not that long ago.
“I don’t—uh,” Tony floundered, visibly struggling to find the words. “I didn’t mean for that to happen, Steve, I promise. Yesterday wasn’t some grand scheme to rope you into marriage. I wanted to show you the lighthouse chapel and then ask you out for a date sometime after the case, maybe to dinner somewhere on the water or, but I guess - all those young people in love, and your smile in the moonlight, I, I—”
Thor nodded solemnly, “My brother—he may not have been the best, but he was still my brother—he’s been trapped in the Underworld for centuries, given the task of overseeing the souls of the dead. He and Fury had a disagreement, we’ll say. That was his punishment; he’s trapped there. I tried to defend him, but Fury . . . he wouldn’t hear any other sides. His mind was made up, and the consequences for insubordination are always disastrous.”
“Tell me about yourself, kid,” Tony spoke abruptly, not looking up from the suit. “I like to talk while I work. It’ll be nice to have someone to talk to that’s not the fucking walls.”
“What do you know about where I’m supposed to be?” he asked, his voice halfway between incredulous and furious. “Aren’t you Olympus’s favorite hermit?”
sorry to keep everybody waiting, but this chapter is special to me. if you've read the tags, then you know what's (or who's) coming. if not, get ready for a little surprise!
Tony scolded himself for not answering, but he made a mental note—he would call him tomorrow. He had four text messages from Steve and he couldn’t help but roll his eyes. It was probably something about that stupid new team building exercise that Captain Handsome wanted to try. He scrolled and scrolled, looking for something, anything from Pepper: a missed call, text message, email. Hell, he would take a business email if it meant that he could talk to her, but it didn’t look like anything at Stark Industries required his immediate attention. Go fucking figure.
“Having a son should be reason enough to stay,” Tony said, still digging around in the chest piece of the armor.
“For amusement?” Natasha suggested, and Steve felt physically sick at the words. Someone who caused bodily harm to someone else for no reason other than entertainment. “Rhodey knows to lay low after one of Fury’s outbursts. He’ll take care of it.”
Tony pulled his feet up under him, sitting on his couch and studying the image on his phone. Steve’s blonde hair was almost brunette with moisture, and he had probably just gotten out of the shower. His mouth was shaped into a small smirk; it was obvious that asshole knew how good he looked. His stomach muscles were rigid, and Tony couldn’t tell if Steve was flexing or if the serum had truly pulled the skin that
“A plan,” Rhodey confirmed, nodding once with conviction. “It looks like your boyfriend is good at making friends. And if those new friends are willing to reevaluate where their loyalties lie, we can finally get some sort of offense together. We can get you back to Olympus.”
The boy looked at Tony, and looked away just as quickly. “Sorry,” he muttered, still gripping the necklace in his hand. “Sorry. I just—I don’t have her anymore. I don’t have anyone.”
At the edge of the cave’s opening, Tony stood for a moment, seeing the city below him and the mountain on the other side of it. He glanced at the skies, wary of any weather change that could take place as quickly as Fury could change moods. For now, there wasn’t a cloud in sight, and Tony didn’t hesitate any longer before throwing his body from the ledge.
A shadow came over her face, and Steve didn’t know why he’d brought it up. But he’d resented Natasha for not showing up when the city was under siege; he’d resented all of the Olympians for abandoning their people. But after seeing the look on Natasha’s face, Steve wondered if maybe they had wanted to help. Maybe Fury’s pride had kept them from aiding the Athenians. “There was nothing we could do,” the goddess said, and her earlier carefree demeanor had vanished entirely. “Tony was out of Pyra, we were not to leave Olympus.”
, come find us. We’ll help.”
Steve gave him a firm nod, his eyes shut tightly as he tried to control his breathing. He turned to Thor and Natasha, who had been watching Fury, but turned at the sound of the hurried conversation behind them. Nat watched them with dejected eyes, and Steve was sure that Fury’s leadership was not something that she approved of. Thor didn’t look surprised either, but his jaw was set in a hard line as he turned back to them. Steve met their gazes with a daunting look, and he regained his composure, suddenly more sure of himself. “You still think we shouldn’t do anything?”
,” Tony interrupted, going on as if Rhodey hadn’t even spoken. “The only thing I have left to do is bring the weapons system online. Then we can—”
Rhodey flashed a smile at him, but it was tainted with the bitterness of his departure. He kicked his feet up and flew through the volcano, turning his body to fly though the opening at the top.
“I needed to be ready,” Tony answered, his voice just above a whisper. “I needed to be ready, and now I’m not. I’ll have to rebuild.”
Rhodey veered to the left without hesitation, his chiton beating painfully against his legs as he flew. Lowering himself to the ground where he’d seen the reflection, he made sure to land beside the suit and not on top of it. Rhodey’s hands hovered over the cold metal helplessly, unsure of what to do next. He pulled at the face mask with caution at first—he didn’t even know if he would be able to remove it without Tony’s help. But the suit creaked under the pressure, and Rhodey pulled harder at the mask, his fingers finding a grip and refusing to give until he’d succeeded in ripping the faceplate clean off.
again, for the safety of both of them. For all Steve knew, that last part could be true.
“Never get to leave
“He’ll do the same for you,” Natasha told Steve, holding his gaze as she spoke, her voice lower than it had been. “He knows your weakness now, or at least has a guess. He’ll hold that over you. Be careful. There are no lengths he won’t go to.”
“Trust me, friend,” Thor cut in. “My brother has been thrown from Olympus, just as your Tony Stark has been.”
“Welcome to Olympus, Steven,” Fury said, never batting an eye at the other god’s exposure.
Rhodey flew close to the ground, low enough that he hoped nobody could see him from the clouds above. He kept his eyes down, scanning for signs of Tony in the low light. The sun had long since gone down, and if Tony hadn’t made it back to Prya, he could have landed anywhere in the stretch between Olympus and the volcano.
“So, what does the Big Guy have to say that’s so important?” Tony asked rolling his eyes, his words dripping with apathy. He really didn’t care what Fury had to say to him, and he could guess that this fact had something to do with his expulsion from Olympus.
Rhodey cleared his throat, bringing Tony back to the workshop. “Yeah, back to Olympus. But before we need a plan, we need to fix your suit.”
Although Tony was dangerously keen on testing Nick Fury’s authority, Tony knew that if he were to fight him, he would have to go up against him alone.
Before he could deny Clint’s request again, he felt a large hand clasp him on the back. He turned the slightest bit to see Thor at his left side, his ever-present trident in his hand, and Natasha at his flank. “Yes! We should all go together,” he insisted, urging Steve forward with the firm grip on his shoulder.
“Now look what you’ve done,” he laughed. “I’ve got to go find something else to shoot at now. You’re coming with me.”
He went to work with the wires, untangling the blue ones from the yellow ones, words bouncing around in his head as he did. “My mom used to tell me about my dad,” he began. “I–I mean did
“Don’t. Move,” Rhodey hissed under his breath. All of the attention was on Fury, and he turned to look over the crowd that had begun to gather in the throne room. Rhodey dug his fingers into Steve’s arm, making sure that he was listening before he continued. “You don’t leave Olympus. I’ll go check on him after everyone goes to bed, and I’ll tell you what I know. If Fury knows that I left, I can tell him that it was to warn Tony again. If you go with me, he’ll know that’s a lie. Do. Not. Leave. This. Mountain.”
“Hi, uh—Thor, god of—?”
Natasha nodded solemnly. “Yes, that we knew of,” she allowed. “But after he left, there were whispers around Olympus, and people were saying nasty things about Tony. This was centuries ago, and the whispers haven’t stopped. Whatever rumors Fury started about Tony—they’ve just kept spreading for hundreds of years. Whether they’re true or not, he’s been feeding them to all of the Olympians, and with Tony unable to defend himself—who do you think they’re going to believe?”
Rhodey walked with purpose to the edge of the mountain, and Steve followed at a short distance behind him. Turning on his heel at the exit, Rhodey sent Steve a heated glare. “You’re not coming with me, Rogers,” he said with finality.
of his volcanic workshop, but no human would be able to wield the weapon of a god—and Mark III was perhaps the deadliest of them. But Peter ran his hands almost lovingly over the chipped red paint, and his eyes glazed over in wonder.
Steve circled the throne room, nodding his acknowledgement to those that greeted him. He smiled slightly as visitors welcomed him to Olympus, never knowing exactly who was speaking to him, and never stopping long enough to ask. He was used to being the center of attention, but that didn’t mean that he had ever grown to like it. Steve came to a halt where Rhodey stood, reaching out to shake his hand. Rhodey was the only one on Olympus who Steve had decided he wanted to befriend, and he was relieved when Rhodey took Steve’s hand, giving it a firm shake. He threw Steve a tight-lipped smile, and Steve guessed he was always tense when Fury was near. Steve may have been new to Olympus, but he hadn’t seen Rhodey relax once on the Mountain.
“The seas,” Thor affirmed, clasping Steve’s shoulder as he did. “And all that comes with it.”
Steve turned to leave the dining hall before any of them could give him a response, and he let out a grateful sigh when he realized that no one was following him. He finished what was left of the barley bread in his hand, and he ate his last couple of figs in a few quick bites. Steve kept walking, but instead of wandering among the clouds of Olympus as he had done the night before, he began to make his way down the side of the mountain. He was headed back towards earth.
“I guess he realized who I was once we were in the air,” Steve said, and he wasn’t sure whether he was lying at the moment. It would make sense for Tony to return any humans he picked up outside of Pyra, not bring them into the pit of the fire. Maybe Tony had known who he was when he flew toward them, and Steve pushed the thought to the back of his mind. He didn’t know how to feel about that yet.
Natasha met his gaze once more, though her tone was still disinterested. “I don’t agree with the way that he rules Olympus—he rules with fear. But I have no choice but to obey. You aren’t understanding me, Steve.
Steve shot up, his eyes scanning the dark room, searching for the source of the voice. Natasha stepped out of the shadows, and Steve scrambled to pull the sheets to keep more of his bare chest covered. He had to figure out a way to keep the other Olympians out of his corners.
“No clue,” Rhodey shrugged again. “But I can tell you that the new god is there already. Well, he’s not a new god, but it’s his first time on Olympus. Steven, god of beauty, love, and desire. He’s an older, major god, but he’s been living in his temple in Athens among the people. Been there for thousands of years, but it was getting harder for him to live in the city, what with him being the most beautiful man on the planet and all.” Rhodey shook his head, scoffing at the thought; he had seen Steve himself, he wasn’t

Steve returned a cool gaze to Clint, but Clint was grinning from ear to ear. He laughed shortly at Steve’s alarm, his face contorting into a mischievous smirk. “You really don’t want to have some fun at target practice with me?” he asked, his voice more playful. For a split second, Steve couldn’t tell what Clint’s intentions were—if he was being seriously threatened, or if this was just the way that the god interacted with others.
“Dum-E...” Steve muttered under his breath. Tony had told him as much already—Fury had seen what he could do. And he didn’t like it.
Tony sat back down on the bed after successfully discarding the rest of the scratched metal of the suit. “There’s Steve, right?” he asked, and his voice carried just a hint of yearning—Rhodey knew that voice. He recognized the wistfulness there.
gods—it could
The silence in the throne room was overbearing to the gods that were gathered, but Steve was enjoying this a little too much. He didn’t want to tell everyone else what he and Tony had talked about; he wanted to keep their conversation to himself. He would rather have kept the whole thing to himself—it was the only thing that had happened recently that didn’t leave him with a hollow feeling in his chest. Steve had felt full when he left, the butterflies in his stomach alive at the thought of returning to the lonely god in the mountain. But with all of the Olympians staring him down in this emergency council meeting or
Peter sat in silence for a moment longer before taking in a shaky breath, doing his best to keep himself together. Whatever composure he’d managed earlier was fading fast. He shut his eyes, pressing the palms of his hands against them, not wanting to cry—and if he did cry, not wanting Tony to see him do it. Tony kept his eyes on his work. The loneliness that had pushed Peter to dangerous heights, unsure of what exactly he was searching for—that was something the fire god was all too familiar with. Seeing the kid struggle with it held a deathly grip on his heart. A grip that wouldn’t let up.
Tony went back to his work, fiddling with the metal armor in front of him He had created one suit before, and it sat, barely used in the corner of his workshop. He stared longingly at it, knowing that all he needed to do was put it on to fly after Rhodey and out into the world. But it wouldn’t last a second against the wrath of Fury if he disobeyed direct orders, and in the end, it wouldn’t be worth the risk. The old suit worked, but it wasn’t
“I care about everyone,” Steve retorted, automatically defensive. “I’m the god of love. It’s sort of my job description.”
“Was Tony banished for insubordination?” Steve couldn’t help himself, the question had tumbled from his lips before he’d even had a chance to think it through. Natasha’s mouth quirked upward to one side, but she schooled her features into a hard blank stare with ease.
Peter hummed in agreement, his fingers still pulling at the tangled mess mindlessly. “I didn’t believe her at first—that he loved us, I mean. But something about my mom,” he mused. “I—I don’t know… She never doubted him. I think that takes strength—to never give up on someone like that. Even after they’re gone.”
Tony Stark:
Steve crossed his arms in front of his broad chest. “I don’t give a damn what Fury is. I’ve been on Olympus for a day and a half and he already despises me.”
this was, he needed to give them something.
“So you’ve met the bot then,” Natasha mused, cutting off Steve’s train of thought. “I think it’s more than that, though. After Fury kicked him out, everyone was confused. No one knew why Tony was gone all of a sudden. All Tony took with him was his bot, and he left. There was no big blow up, no fight, no threat on Fury’s part.”
Tony stood on shaky, metal-clad legs, and began to tug at the suit, pulling the dead metal off of his body. The suit had powered down in the fall, and at this point, the only way to get it off was to pry it off.  “Look, I know—I
Attached was a picture of Steve’s cum splattered across his broad chest; his lips were in frame, twisted into a smug grin. That was enough to send Tony over the edge, his orgasm wracking his whole body. He came in his hand, his breath coming in ragged moans and his legs trembling uncontrollably. He scooped his discarded shirt up from the floor to wipe himself clean and typed out a response to Steve.
“No, you’re worried because he’s
“You want to be the leader of your company?” Peter asks, a little bit surprised. Harry shrugs.

“No,” Steve retorted, and there was no room for debate in his answer. He would not give on this; he could at least do that for Tony. Rhodey sat stiffly to the left of Fury, and though his head was bowed, his eyes searched out Steve. He offered him a sly smile in support. Steve uncrossed his arms from his chest, aware that he looked defensive, and spoke again. “You tossed him in that volcano, forbade everyone from seeing him, and forbade him from ever leaving. Where would he find the supplies to build something? He’s got his automaton that he left Olympus with--that’s it. He’s

wanted to. He knew that Rhodey had to appease the god for the sake of both him and Tony, and Steve was sure that he’d wanted to tell him how he really felt more than a couple of times.
Steve nodded once, still appraising the situation. He may have been new to Olympus, but he’d heard what the mortals said about Fury on Earth: a man whose anger was matched only by his own power. He’d kill for something as insignificant as a disagreement at the dinner table. “Yes, it’s very different from Athens,” Steve answered. “Clint and Natasha showed me to the house earlier, but I haven’t met the other gods yet. So far, everyone has been cordial.” Steve leveled his stare at Fury in silent defiance, as if to say, “go ahead, prove me wrong.”
Steve corrected her mentally. But he wouldn’t argue this any further in front of the rest of them. All he would do is infuriate Fury and Hill further, and none of the other gods would come to his defense. Steve wasn’t naive enough to expect that. “I don’t think that he does,” he muttered, “but I’m telling you, I couldn’t see anything that he was working on.”
“Right,” Steve murmured. “I knew that.” He really did know what the Olympians were gods of, but matching names and faces to people he’d only ever seen in statues before was more difficult than he’d care to admit.
“Yeah, I don’t know how I feel about this place yet,” Steve said, and he shook his head as he spoke, a visible portrayal of the exasperation that he felt. If he felt vexation towards anyone in particular, it was with Fury, but mostly Steve was just annoyed with the whole place. Between the way that all of the Olympians tiptoed around Fury, the constant tension on the mountain, and Steve feeling like he had to constantly look over his shoulder, he wished more than anything that things could go back to way they were in Athens. But all he could do now was make the best of this new situation.
Tony wondered vaguely if that was why he was so automatically drawn to Steve, because of Steve’s enchantments or whatever it was called. He’d thought that, technically being an Olympian, he would be immune to it, but he’d never come in contact with a god like Steve before. In fact, the
“I’m sure Steve has become acquainted enough with Fury already to know that he should be taken seriously,” Rhodey cut in, and Steve was thankful for him filling the silence.
“My mom was my best friend,” Peter began, and his lower lip trembled as he spoke. He shook his head once, sharply, cursing himself for the emotions that were slowly overwhelming him. “She really was. My closest friend. She was all I had, and she always knew exactly what to say. Especially when—well, when I would get like this.” His shoulders sagged, as if he was trying to make himself smaller—to take up as little space as possible.
Pepper left him.
“Come on, we need to take those cables out!” Peter tells Tony. Otto screams as well, as if something is hurting him. Tony doesn’t have time to listen, instead grabbing one of the cables Peter pointed at and pulling along with him. When he doesn’t seem to have much success, Steve finally joins in and helps Tony along. Sparks come flying, burning Tony’s hands on some spots. He grits out in pain, but doesn’t say anything.

Steve doesn’t look that convinced, but then he sighs again. “Just take out the suit, and we’ll fly up to the Helicarrier.”
“From what I’ve known from Spider-Man these past few months, I know that he wants nothing else than to be an Avenger. And, I know they haven’t been as active lately, but they’re not disbanded.”
“Buzzkill,” Peter mutters. “But you’re right, I should get some sleep. Tomorrow I need to figure out a way to get Karen back into the mask.”
The outfit fits. To keep it hidden, though, he’s given a pair of sweatpants and a loose hoodie. It’s something he would absolutely not wear in public, not to mention live TV, but he figures the ends justify the needs. When he gets shown where he needs to wait, Tony goes to stand there, putting his hands in his pockets. He’s quickly joined by Peter, who looks like he’s ready to just die on the spot.
“Ståopp, beiskaldi!” Get up, bitch, she heard the woman whose face was hanging right above her own grunt in Norwegian. Yaël blinked a few times and saw a few features of the face that looked like her own change. The ochre eyes turned brown, the colorful hair turned blonde.
“Amongst things, yeah,” Tony returns. “Listen, son, I’m tired and I just need to go to bed. You’re still here tomorrow?”
“Uh, I sure hope so, since we’ve been in a relationship for the past year or so,” Tony explains. He wonders why the kid looks at him like he just gave him the biggest news in the world. That’s nothing new, isn’t it? The whole world already knows about this.
Tony smiles before leaning forward and kissing Peter’s forehead.
“That suit; you made it yourself, right?”
he suddenly hears Ned groaning in the background.
“I’m just glad you’re alright,” Peter answers truthfully. He can’t lose his father before the man even knows they’re related. And he would rather not lose him afterwards, either.
It’s an unspoken agreement when they move it along. There’s preparation, there’s a lot of long stares and grunting. When Steve pushes inside, Tony almost cries it out. He puts his hands on Steve’s back, nails scratching his skin. Steve doesn’t seem to notice it; not when he’s feeling like he’s about to break apart like this.

Tony grinned up at Steve’s regretful tone and brought Steve’s hand up to brush a quick kiss across his cold fingers. “I don’t know what you’re talking about, Steve. I did everything I wanted: four days with the hadron collider at CERN, and four nights with the hardon collider at—”
In the end, Steve gave up and returned to his room. After all, if there was one thing that Tony shouldn’t be surprised by, it would be Steve’s overeager cock.
Steve rolled his hips forward and Tony groaned under his breath, arching his hips eagerly. “Oh, Steve,” he moaned, “is that a belt buckle I feel, or are you happy to see me?”
“Yes, but—”
“Coke, no ice,” Steve repeated dutifully, then shuffled down the aisle to go get it for him. He ran up the stairs, down the hall (and god, why was there a line?), and when it was finally his turn, and he had finally paid, and the old man behind the counter asked if he’d like a straw with the drink, the buzzer rang throughout the stadium.
“Tony, I’ve missed you,” he whispered then, and Tony turned his head back towards him, his eyelids fluttering open in his sleephaze.
“I,” Steve choked out, struggling to form words as if he’d just sprinted instead of driven from campus. “Manicure, please.”
Steve closed his fist around his old dog tags.
Tony stopped walking and stared at him. Steve slowed to a halt once he noticed and spun on his heel to give Tony a look.
“I think they’d gone straight to voicemail,” Steve replied, because that did make the most sense, after all. “There’s only a few people whose calls come through when we’re sleeping—we have friends all over the world, nobody can keep track of who is in what time zone, so our phones don't ring at night unless it’s our parents. And dad is… well,” Steve trailed off, then quickly changed tack. “Let’s put it this way: for the longest time, Tony wasn’t sure my dad even liked him. So I wake up and it’s dad calling at five in the morning—immediately I’m thinking the worst has happened, because why else would dad call before dawn? I’m asking if mom’s okay, if he’s okay, and at the same time I’m shaking Tony awake and telling him to get us the first tickets back to Boston when dad - in his typical calm, serious voice - just says, ‘I want to talk to Tony.’ So we switch phones: I finish booking the tickets while Tony tries to wake up enough to talk to my dad. And I don’t know what my dad said to him, they still won’t tell me,” Steve wryly observed, a quick interjection in his own story, “but at the time, all I could see was Tony starting to cry. So, of course, now I’m thinking that dad’s heard something about Tony’s mom and we should really be going to New York to see her, so I book the first tickets out to New York, just in case.”
“If you wish, you could go first,” Yinsen suggested gently, “then take the remainder of the day remotely.”
“—Steve!”
cherished. Already he couldn’t wait for Tony to come back to New York so Steve could show him exactly how happy the surprise had made him.
“The guy may be a god, Tony, but he also looks a lot like George W. Bush,” Steve said with a helpless shrug. “That’s not really flattering unless you can make a career out of it.”
Fun fact: In Portugal I learned that some apartments are designed so that one can safely jump from one balcony to the other in case of emergencies. I believe it is intended so that one can escape in case of a fire (i.e., if your exit is blocked because of the fire, you have a viable alternative exit). My impression was that it isn't a national law, but that it's a prevalent part of modern buildings. That said, that's not what Steve and Tony deal with here (mostly because I pictured them in the Altis Avenida Hotel, which is from the 11th century and clearly predates structural fire safety).
“That’s part of the problem, I might have lost it,” Steve admitted sheepishly. “Just got back from a business trip and a few things are missing.”
“BAD DOG!” he shouted, sprinting after her without any hope of catching her. “MARPLE! Marple! Get back here!”
The rope turned out to be a makeshift halter and lead for the horse. Tony called over his shoulder to Steve that he’d be just a minute, but he might have been even faster than that at getting Dummy strapped in. He leapt up the porch and made his way to Steve with a grateful kiss.
Tony is a boxing manager with a past, someone who was once great, but has for reasons of his own doing ruined his own career. Steve's a young gun who really had no experience, but Tony saw something in him from the start - or maybe just, no other boxer with a lick of insight would trust themselves in his hands anymore, and since nobody else was really seeing much promise in Steve and Tony had nobody else who'd work with him, they came together - professionally, nothing romantic yet by far.  With Tony's guidance and training, Steve fights his way to the top, to the heavyweight title match against the current defending champion, Vanko. But when Vanko enters the ring with Steve for the title match, as soon as Tony see's him his instinct from years in this damn business tells him that something is wrong. Their damn opponent is too optimistic, too pleased to be there. Nobody should be so confident climbing into the ring with a fighter like Steve's, even if he's technically still a nobody - even a defending champion knows how scary a young, hungry competitor is, so why is Vanko and his team smirking? And by the second round, Tony's pretty damn sure the other guy is cheating, either by wearing reinforced gloves or knuckledusters under them, because that's not the right sound and that is not how Steve's body would react if it was a clean hit. And when Steve comes back to the corner at the end of the fourth round, not even a third of the way through but so badly bruised and bleeding, Tony's tells him his suspicions and that he's throwing the towel in.
“Be well, and be gone,” Fury barked at the nurses, and like frightened sheep, they jumped away and hustled out of the room.
Two against one. Tony conceded Paris. They all went back to their milkshakes with varying degrees of enthusiasm while they tried to think of reasonable alternatives.
Two years ago, Versace designed a perfume advertisement campaign around the blistering heat of summer and the glorious history of the Roman Empire. Beautiful women in modern silk togas and woven sandals walking through the ancient cobblestone streets of Rome watched with bated breath as the victorious gladiators emerged from the arena, fashionably disheveled in sweat and dust from the fight.
“It’s not just
Of course, the moment Steve turned to Coulson and asked if he wanted to take Tony’s place Tony changed his mind. Nobody was going to squirm against his future husband’s body but
“Easy, Steve—what’s; you’ll choke, babe,” Tony said in gentle, soothing words that Steve wanted to hug to his face and dance with forever. Tony’s voice was so beautiful and it was the best sound in the world.
We're going into extra stoppage time! I kinda get the sense y'all knew that all along. Hope you're liking it so far - and the next chapter
Even now when Steve knew without a shadow of a doubt that it was his Tony, it was still so strange to have someone who looked, sounded, and smelled so different pressing up against his body.
The door handle gave way easily under his touch and the door swung inwards. No pets, no roommates, no partners: an ideal door. Steve made a mental note to thank Sam for his great work; they’d been an unstoppable team this past month, and with a little luck, they would finish at the top of the board this time, collect their bonuses, and wipe the smug looks off Natasha and Clint’s faces once and for all.
,” he rushed to say. “Steve, I’ll—thank you, Steve. Thank you, I can’t wait to see you on Monday.”
“I might have… insisted?” Tony finished with an playfully innocent tone that had Clint and Maria laughing. Even Howard smirked at the memory. “You know, looking back, I don’t even get how all that was legal. It took what, a week? Ten days?”
The phone went to voicemail, but before Steve got a chance to leave a message, he noticed Tony was calling him back. Steve connected the call, already smiling, when Tony croaked out, “Steve? Y’kay?”
Tony stiffened at the comment, and a silence fell over the family as they all seemed to realize who was in their company all at the same time. With varying degrees of subtlety, they turned to look at Steve, who had taken to the stove to make the eggs.
Q’s faithful minions took turns providing support and cover in that three-day period, and Tony was no different. He, Sam, and Bucky made sure to be there for the same shifts - they knew and trusted each other well enough that even Q recognized that they worked more effectively together than apart. As a team, they put out the fires Q didn’t have time for until 006 was found, dead or alive.
“You know,” Steve said with an encouraging smile, “mixers, formals, trips to the Cape? Ways to get to know each other.”
Tony’s look of excitement and shock eased further into a warm adoration with every added confession. He took two small steps closer and leaned in farther still on the balls of his feet until they were so close Steve could feel Tony’s breath against his lips.
Their one-man audience only smirked back.
The second pop wasn’t as readily forthcoming, and it took a few tries to really get a good crack. A few times of rocking his whole body forward, with nothing but his boxer shorts between his early morning erection and Tony’s tight jeans.
“Duty calls,” Tony said with a smile, and they both got up to get going. “Come down and help us test out some hoverbikes? Five o’clock.”
“Thank you, I love Mr. Fang,” she whispered, then promptly smushed her face into the plush toy and hid her blushing face against her dad’s shoulder.
“Those live far from your galaxy,” Steve promised, “in acid baths, their scales bleed. We use it to make a popular candy our young eat when they feel unwell.”
“Tony, if we take that step on our wedding night, I want to bottom.”
Tony nodded in understanding. “Didn’t want to stand out,” he filled in, and Steve hummed quietly in agreement. “Go on.”
It took a while for Steve to realize that Tony was standing silently in the little lounge.
“There is one more toy, if we get to it tonight,” Steve told him in an absent whisper. “There’s no rush, sweetheart. I’m in no rush.”
Confirmed Foster for Ellen. Danielle Yin manuscript received and under review. Finalized Sitwell transition, re-assigned his work. Priorities on my desk for your oversight, final five accounts distributed to Wilson and Lang as you wanted.
Tony blinked up at him, surprised but pleasantly so. He had felt that Bucky’s competitive side came from a good place, but he was blindsided by what that could mean - how rare it might be, or how it would affect his Steve. Emotions he wasn’t ready for rose in his throat, and it was by sheer will power that he pulled it together. After all, they were still in public.
Tony grimaced quietly, but grudgingly agreed. “Except Rhodey.”
With the first post free enough to turn, Tony tossed the shovel aside and crouched down to get a good grip. With a grunt and more effort than he ever remembered, he pulled the post out and threw it aside.
Steve pressed his lips together in a blatant attempt to resist smiling back, but it shone through all the same, his whole face warming as he smiled. He tried to hide his face against Tony’s leg, and Tony laughed before he could help himself, tugging gently on his hair to encourage Steve to bring his smile out of hiding.
“Relax, Stevie. I’m sure she doesn’t remember the times you ghosted on her niece,” Bucky assured his partner and best friend, who suddenly floundered to remember how that relationship had ended (twice).
Smirking, he made his way out of the crowd and easily found Brock and Sharon still celebrating their win.
Steve’s teeth flashed in a predatory grin. He squeezed a handful of Tony’s ass hard enough to sting, and in a low, husky voice, he growled, “How did you know? You’re what I’ve always wanted.”
With a full-body shudder, he dug through his bag for toiletries and clean underwear before rushing to the shower. The white noise of the water filled the void around him, and if he closed his eyes and focused on only that, he could imagine himself back in his own apartment, in his own shower, in the middle of a city where reliable security was ready to respond from every floor of his apartment building at every hour of the day.
, not purple,” Bucky corrected, and he quickly reclaimed the once-offending nail polishes as if they need rescuing from Steve’s judgmental reach. “And… alright, sometimes, she likes to get creative with her toes, okay? Like, wearing unicorn print underwear, or Power Puff Girls socks. But you didn’t hear it from me.”
Steve chuckled to himself and pushed his full glass of water closer to Tony. How Steve knew he was thirsty was a mystery, but Tony accepted it gratefully and took a long drink.
“Yeah, not gonna believe anything you say about that guy until I see his dick myself,” Tony reminded her, which he said often enough that Jane either waved him off, or assured him it might even happen some day. Apparently, Thor loved saunas.
Four years ago, Steve would only ever sound cheerful and happy when Tony opened the door and came home. ‘Tony, is that you?’ would be an expression of excitement, a thrill to have his husband home from meetings or the workshop before sundown.
Tony rushed to his side, his face bright with gleeful excitement.
He couldn’t stop smiling.
“Yes, sir,” Jane confirmed. “Burritos are on their lunch and dinner menus.”
“Woman, we mean you no harm,” the most decorated warrior declared. “The donkey is a coward who deserted a mating, and the other is an unclaimed man. We will take them, in the name of Chief Talia.”
Steve blinked at him, suddenly bewildered. “Kissed you? When?”
No-one was going to take from Steve what he had worked so hard to achieve - not Brock, not Sharon, and certainly not those unscrupulous assholes who didn’t care if he heard them negotiating bets on how long Steve would last at Harvard with and without spreading his legs. He’d show them; he’d show all of them.
“I understand you’re hurting, angel, but no man is worthy of taking your happiness from you,” she said quietly.
“Call my friend dumb one more time, Rogers,” he said coolly. “I double dog dare you.”
“That?” Tony smirked, perhaps a lot smug. “Nothing but a lifetime of bustin’ broncos, my love.”
Steve stepped away from the delicate, artfully folded underwear and did his level best to ignore where he was. Unfortunately, he wasn’t great at multitasking.
“Breathe,” Steve reminded him gently, pumping the lubricant from his gloves further into Tony’s body with every thrust of his fingers.
“Merry Christmas to
Steve couldn’t look away from the rink, but he was still aware enough to frown at what Tony said. “Now? There’s overtime, they—it could end any minute.”
“This is,” Steve began, but he couldn’t find any words to say.
Who are you?
“That’s it, baby. Easy,” Tony purred, his legs still stubbornly locked around Steve’s hips and he rubbed his hands across Steve’s shoulders in absent, soothing gestures as Steve came down from his high. Steve eased his weight down on top of Tony, taking comfort in his affection and gentle touch.
“What the hell?” Tony muttered, mostly to himself. Steve frowned a little at the unexpected response, because of all reactions Tony might have had, Steve had not expected him to be impatient or upset. Though, given the cost of this consultation, Steve could sympathize.
The spell of companionable silence was broken with the buzzing sound of Tony’s phone. The distraction was a godsend, and Steve quickly got to his feet under the guise of putting their plates away and getting more comfortable so he could slip into his bedroom and get his shit together.
Tony groaned in pleasure, deep and shameless and indulgent, and let his head fall back. In these last weeks, Tony had quickly learned to love Steve’s fascination with his body. He could happily have held his legs open by his ankles all day for Steve to fondle and study, learning all the different ways he could make Tony come, and how each method affected a harvest.
As soon as she could, Stephanie rushed to the small, stone building where Tony and Clint were held in separate cells. It was still dark outside, but dawn was approaching. She did not have much time.
“—the hotel, what?” he asked in a charade of innocence, batting his eyelashes up at Steve to fan the flames of exasperated laughter that Steve was trying (and failing) to keep to himself. As if Tony wasn’t leaning in so close that he could feel the tremors of amusement against his side, or recognize the shameless affection in Steve’s eyes.
He was just about to snap at Tony to mind his own damn business when Tony beat him to the punch.
“It’s okay, Tony,” Steve replied, but Tony struggled to understand his response. The way Steve’s shoulders slumped inward was telling of his nerves and anxiety, but Steve was still leaning into Tony’s embrace, still trying to smile back at him even when it couldn’t reach his eyes. Something had Steve on edge, but for the life of him, Tony couldn’t put his finger on it. His mother was more talk than bite, and his dad had kept his word about keeping his distance. All he could do was hold Steve closer and do his best to communicate to Steve that he was safe.
Tony could have thanked him. He could have assured Steve that he, too, was uninterested in popular games of bumbling mating rituals. That he, too, knew what he wanted. That Steve could very well be what he was looking for.
“The most important, difficult fucking decision of my miserable life, you don’t think I thought about it?” Tony all but hissed, trying to speak quietly even when he couldn’t contain his heartache. “I just—I couldn’t do it, Steve. I, the risk? What’s my fucking life compared to thousands?”
He needed to get Tony to the hospital. If he was hurt, if his head—if he—
“Don’t worry,” Maria told Natasha with a meaningful smirk. “I won’t let him out of my sight.”
“Isn’t it great! It works, it even feels real,” Tony insisted, rushing over now to bring him the mannequin so Rhodey could see it up close. Rhodey stared at it with wonder, caught somewhere between horrified and genuinely amazed for the level of detail and realism that Tony had managed to develop in his disguise.
Steve caught his flailing, outstretched hand, and brought it to his lips. “I’m right here, sweetheart,” he whispered against Tony’s fingers.
“And then you made the natural leap from modeling to law school?”
“Uh, I mean,” Bruce said then, “do you prefer blondes or brunettes?”
Tony bit his lip to keep from snickering at Steve’s sudden lack of control, but it would take a stronger man than he to deny Steve. He ran his fingers over Steve’s skin as the shower water washed over him, until there was no arguable reason to delay.
The creature was not so easily deterred. “Is it male?”
Steve, on the other hand, didn’t bat an eye. “Nice to meet you, Chris.”
“The next time I tell you to turn left and floor it,” Tony whispered, “don’t hesitate.”
The doors slid open just in time, and before Steve could finish his sentence, Tony shouted a “thank you London, bye!” and hauled his co-star off the train to laughing applause and one excitable soul who waved madly after them and shouted
Tony and Clint both stared at her, unsure of why she was there, and how they should feel about it.
“It is getting kinda late,” Rhodey admitted with a yawn, and he sat up with some difficulty to stretch and force himself awake. “What’re people even doing here? There’s work in the morning,” he muttered, eyeing the thirty or so people still lingering in the bar.
“He asked me to come out for a day and play the kid’s teacher,” Steve continued to say as if Tony wasn’t busy staring at gulls and gaggles of teenagers pretending to be hip. “Apparently, he wants my best impersonation of Charlie Brown’s teacher.”
Tony rolled his eyes, and instead went to pick up a rope like he had used the day before. “We’ll be fine.”
“It’s like talking to a brick wall,” Bruce muttered, only nodding in the affirmative when the waiter came around to ask if he’d like the menu and a cup of coffee.
19 student in Boston too
“Only when medically necessary,” Steve promised with smile, and across from him, Tony snickered as he pulled the car through onto another road. “I’ll eat anything twice.”
Artillery and gunfire had long prepared Steve not to flinch, but the multiple blasts and raining concrete didn’t visibly affect the four filthy, shabbily dressed figures dashing for the truck either.
lovers. Passionate—”
“I’ve been trying to find you everywhere to show you; hi, sorry, totally barging in here,” he momentarily acknowledged the women as he scrolled through his phone for a video to show Phil. “Here! Victoria didn’t have your number, or she’d sent it to you.”
“The city’s small and concentrated, and the hotel can send the car as late as seven tonight,” Tony said as he resumed their earlier conversation and turned his phone around so Steve could see the map.
Tony interrupted him with a wave of his hand. “What did you tell me when Coulson offered me a bigger part? Steve?” he promoted when Steve was silent for too long.
“I don’t know if you’re interested, but Barton, Barnes, and Carter went out dancing. They said to send you their way once you got in,” Tony said easily, finally coming to a stop and facing the door to Steve’s suite. “They’re expecting your text.”
Steve’s expression pulled down in a slight frown, and in the end, he couldn’t resist asking, “Even though I got knocked out?”
It wasn’t until he looked over his shoulder to catch his reflection in the mirror in his next break to show off his fucked out ass to the camera that Tony lost it. He reached back and lined the dildo up again and thrust back onto it like this toy would bear his salvation. He braced himself on his forearms and rolled back on the dildo with reckless abandon, his heavy cock bobbing wildly between his thighs with every thrust until finally, clawing at the floorboards, he threw his head back and came with a strangled, breathless groan. Come splattered over the floor and his abdomen, but as Tony crawled off the dildo on wobbly arms, he couldn’t care less. He planted right on top of the mess, panting and rolling onto his side as he luxuriated in his high and tried to catch his breath.
Steve glanced at his hand and reluctantly reached to shake it. “That’s not a question, is it?”
“Won’t there be some big party tonight?” Tony asked even though Steve had crawled into Tony’s unmade bed several minutes ago and stretched out like he belonged there. Steve turned his head and cracked an eye open to respond with droll disbelief with a finely articulated arch of his brow.
“I’ll come visit soon, dad,” Steve said in response to a question that hadn’t been asked. “It’s just been really busy at work.”
“Do you - no, but do they know it’s you?” Jimmy pressed, still giggling to himself, “do they know they’re talking to Captain America?”
Tony sucked and salivated over Steve’s thick fingers like a man possessed, and once Steve wrapped his free hand around Tony’s heavy, aching cock to jerk him off, it was only seconds before Tony’s whole body seized around Steve with a violent climax. Tony’s moans and drool spilled out in equal measure over Steve’s fingers and down his forearm, and Steve curled his fingers in Tony’s mouth, stuffing it full and leaving Tony panting for breath as Steve continued pounding into him through Tony’s body spasms and involuntary clenching around his cock, until finally,
“They’re going to eat me alive,” Steve confided to the holographic projection of his husband later that night. Midnight was well past Steve’s bedtime, especially after such a tiring day, but since their wedding they hadn’t gone to bed without talking about their respective days. Tony’s vibrant holoprojection was so detailed and clear that it was easy to imagine Tony was cocooned in blankets and smiling back at him from the other side of bed when in reality he was in their bed at home in the palace.
The lamp of the lighthouse shone brightly from a distance, and Steve remembered sitting on a bench with Tony and bundled up together in a blanket from his car. The sea-facing side of the chapel was made out of glass, and from a distance Steve and Tony could watch one couple after another stand and commit to their love before an affable priest.
“I don’t care if it was good or unflattering, Stark: it was told in confidence. The world doesn’t need to know everything about me. You know how hard Fury and Coulson had to fight for them to even let me compete here?”
“These arrived for you today,” Howard said and held up two ring boxes. One was large and square, the other round, and more demure. “Why don’t you tell me what’s in here, Steve.”
“Did your dad finally get there?” Steve heard his mom asking through the phone. “What took him so long?”
“You’ve done enough,” Clint told him absently, busy getting the grill started. “House never looked cleaner, Steve, you did good. Take it easy.”
Steve facepalmed and tried to muffle his whine of embarrassment, but Tony must have heard him anyway.
“Rogers.”
Steve read the card over and over again as he waited for Tony to pick up the phone.
“He’s coming: turn around!” Maria whispered urgently, and Steve immediately turned his back and focused on his water.
Wherever he was from, Steve was perfect and Tony’s loyal, reliable, hard-working partner. If the kiss hadn’t left him reeling already, the potential consequences of all this sure did. Steve had ruined him for anybody else, no other partner would do if they were separated. Tony had refused to work with a partner until Fury hoisted farm-boy Rogers on him eight months ago, but Tony was a different man now. They both were.
“Dinner and a movie is the classic choice,” Sam said while loading his egg roll with guac. “Can’t go wrong.”
Panic licked at his shaken thoughts, but Tony willed himself to stay absolutely still and give himself a chance to move past the shock of the fall and pull himself together. He didn’t dare move his leg yet, too worried he’d do so hastily and make a bad situation worse. A torn ligament or a broken bone was the last thing he needed.
Tony got out of his seat and without looking away from Steve, he kneeled at Steve’s side.
in the 80’s and Neil deGrasse Tyson’s continuation later in the 21st, and over Tony’s chrome rimmed, white finish tables hung framed posters of
“You,” Tony whispered in a tight voice, his body already vibrating with disbelieving laughter, “
“Hey, don’t joke about Mitcham,” Steve pouted without irony. “He’s a hero of mine.”
It had taken Q-branch two hours to realize they couldn’t do it. Steve didn’t have much hope, but maybe they’d get something here. All he needed was a lead.
Steve plastered on his USO smile and told himself he had punched Hitler for the two-hundredth time. “Oh, lucky me!”
They quickly learned that the letter writers ranged from mildly irritated to wildly unstable. Some were only irritated by the ‘gay agenda’ or the erasure of women in a Western novel, while a handful of people were outraged by explicit sexual relations between humans and androids. But the nastiest letters were from those personally offended that Tony did not return their affection and interest. Many such letters detailed precisely how they would be the perfect partner for Tony, and what sins they would gladly perform for their favorite erotic novelist.
“We got this room ‘til five!” Sam called without looking up, while Steve automatically turned to march on the door with every intention of slamming it shut on someone’s toes, until he realized who that someone was.
“I’ll do it,” Steve said before anyone had a chance to brainstorm alternatives.
“He’s got a point,” Bruce seconded before Tony could disagree. “But rich people read our magazine, too. We write about Elon Musk all the time; Tesla owners have relationships, too.”
Carefully, Steve picked his way through the workshop in the dark until he stood in the open doorway to Tony’s lab. It was the biggest space in the workshop with a door and a lock. Tony had several work benches in his lab, each of which had been dedicated to some unidentifiable step in the robot and AI developing process with which Steve was only conversationally acquainted. On one of the first occasions Tony had showed Steve his lab and introduced him to Dum-E, Steve had realized that standing in the workshop and trying to make sense of the organized chaos was a window into Tony’s mind. The idea should have been cool at best, or overwhelming, but instead it somehow made Steve feel deeply attached to the discarded scraps of metal and homemade tools that cluttered Tony’s lab on a daily basis.
There weren’t many pets like Tony in the crowd, but he could see some. They were easily identified them by the similar robe, buttoned at the back, but none of them were recognizably human, and they weren’t all off-leash like he was.
Steve glared at his friend and did his best to sound normal as he rushed to assure Tony he wasn’t intruding. “No, no it isn’t,” he promised in a rush, “it’s—we’re just, Bucky and I are at Shield, we’re watching the game. You want to come join us? I’d actually really like to introduce you, if, if you have the time.”
A few fleeting seconds were lost to him until he heard Steve calling his name. It was only then Tony realized he’d been holding his breath. He hadn’t said a word or made a sound.
left him reeling with vertigo.
“You should see him Bruce,” Tony said, his voice bright as he tried to muffle a sudden burst of giggles against his hand. “Every time I say
“What, really?”
They were nearly at the 50s when Tony couldn’t feel his legs anymore. He started stumbling into the stairs, and when he inevitable tripped, Steve was there to catch him. Of all the things he could have said to rub this in Tony’s face, Steve didn’t do anything besides get an arm around his partner, and help Tony the rest of the way.
“What movie were you thinking of taking me to, boo?” Tony whispered playfully.
Slowly, Steve turned to face his friend and offered him the file. “We’re aging,” he said without any preamble. “The serum doesn’t affect normal cell degeneration.”
That’s just okay with you, for your assistant to call me a good for nothing?” Tony shouted without warning, and Steve startled so badly he had to clutch at his heart. Tony didn’t seem to notice, or maybe he did and he didn’t care, but he didn’t stop shouting. “What is—why,” he interrupted himself mid-speech with an unnatural calm, “no. What am I saying. No, this is over. We’re done. If that’s how you treat me, how you let others treat me, we’re done.”
More often than not, they were at Steve’s place. Steve lived in a two-bedroom out in Bushwick, eight stops down from Tony’s apartment on the J line. With the two-bedroom came a bay window, a real kitchen, and a living room. There was enough counter space for them to cook together, a coffee table virtually made for puzzles and board games, and cable TV, so they could both watch the Knicks lose from the comfort of Steve’s very big, and very comfortable, couch.
, but then Steve swallowed him to the root and hummed deliberately around his cock, distracting him enough that he almost didn’t feel the momentary pain of being stretched opened on Steve’s slick fingers, and Tony struggled to remember why or what he refused to do.
Clint’s ears swiveled forward in his excitement, he clomped onwards with newfound energy, further into the unknown depths of the cave. They traveled slowly but steadily, moving through the darkness even while daylight shone above the surface of the cave. It was not until dusk fell and the sun disappeared into the west that they finally emerged on the other end, and found themselves in a world foreign to anything either of them had ever known. Here, the forests were so tall that they could not see where the tops of the trees ended, and they were so wide that even three grown men could not have reached each other’s hands standing around the trunk. Cold, heavy clouds hung low in the air, billowing out between the enormous evergreens so near the earth that sitting on Clint’s back, Tony could have stretched and caught wisps of the corporeal haze in the palm of his hand.
“Tony, as big as you think he looks in pictures or in movies,” Steve said dryly, “double it. The man is bigger than a truck. Real nice, though.”
Steve could practically feel Bucky peering back at him over his safety glasses with a pained expression. “…now why the hell would I do something like that?”
“Thank you, Tony,” Steve exhaled with palpable relief, “I, I won’t let you down. Day or night, Tony. Whatever is available, as soon as possible, schedule it and I will be there.”
Steve glanced at Tony and wondered if he should break the news that palm scanning was a thing ‘back in the 21st.’ But rather than disillusioning Tony’s romantic view of the archaic 21st, Steve took his gloves off and gently pressed his open palm to the scanner.
If you google it, the first "notable alumni" that shows up is Jeffrey Epstein, but rest assured: he switched colleges by the second year. Turns out he is (and I'd argue for many, many reasons) not Cooper Union material.
“I thought I just said,” Steve said, still valiantly trying to channel cheerful friendliness despite the irritated and unwelcoming looks he was getting.
After their wedding and the subsequent unification, Eisenturm was named the capital of Consone and Steve moved into the Royal Palace. What had been King Howard and Queen Maria’s wing was remade for them, leaving Tony’s apartments vacant for their future heir.
Steve opened the door without knocking and entered Sharon’s office with his usual strut. He did not limp, he did not favor his right side, and his sunny smile did not falter.
“004, welcome back,” he said, attempting to affect a tired sigh despite his racing heart. “What’s the status of your bike?”
“What can I say?” Steve said with a much too innocent shrug. “I live to confuse my ma.”
Steve tried. He closed his eyes and he tried. Tony washed his chest (slowly and repeatedly), then worked his way down Steve’s torso to his legs. His gentle touch calmed Steve’s racing thoughts somewhat, but peace was hard to find. The hand-off to the FBI kept creeping into his thoughts, and if he was honest, as bone tired as he was, a part of him wished he had enough energy to work on the new potential lead Tony had found.
When Steve only looked at Tony like he was crazy, Bruce cleared his throat and tried to help explain. “Captain Steven G. Rogers, our society has evolved since your time. We have not had any MDKs in New Yorseylvania in the last forty years.”
“Sit. Stay.”
Steve closed his eyes, took a slow, steadying breath, and privately wondered when the hell he’d catch a break.
Tony blinked up at where Sam and Sharon were promising to be together until death do them part in front of all their friends and family.
Warmth radiated off of Steve’s body like a gentle summer breeze, and Tony did his best to focus on its comfort as Steve reached around his body to guide his legs apart for the masters’ benefit. Steve pressed a gentle paw against Tony’s thigh to widen his stance, then swept his warm palms up Tony’s flanks until Tony stood spread eagle before the other aliens with his hands behind his head and his legs wide apart. By now Tony was past the embarrassment of his cock hanging between his legs, exposed, disinterest, and limp. No-one cared about his cock anyway; to them, it was only a means to easily drinking down his come.
“Want company?” Steve asked as casually as he could. “I’m practically asleep as it is, but I haven’t eaten since breakfast in LA.”
“One bouquet, Tony.”
All, except for one.
Tony pressed his lips together trying to repress a smile. “I’m doomed.”
” Tony hissed, mortified. It wasn’t as if Clint had lied, but hell, he could have at least put it more nicely than that. To save himself the shame of meeting Stephanie’s pitying look, Tony stared down at his fried eggs and tried to shrug casually.
Tony frowned to himself. “I got this, if you need to, I don’t know, question people, knock down doors, examine clues. Isn’t that what detectives do?”
“People don’t… pay. Not for me,” he mumbled. The mattress shifted as Steve pressed up on his hands and knees, but Tony didn’t dare look up. Even when Steve got his arms around him and drew Tony into his lap, Tony wouldn’t meet his gaze. Instead, he curled closer and pressed his wet face into Steve’s chest.
“It’s not that difficult,” Steve promised, “I know how to do it. I’m even good at it.”
“Don’t you own an umbrella?” he complained while taking the take-out bags out of Tony’s hands, and before Tony knew what had happened, he’d been divested of his jacket, his scarf, and his sweater that was sopping wet at the sleeves.
Sensing a tension from his new ward, Tony lowered his voice to address him urgently.  “Captain Steve Rogers, enhance your calm. This will not take long.”
Pretty sure they used padding. Sorry.
For one fleeting moment, he entertained the idea of sabotaging his own defense and staying on for one more year. One more year of his life together with Steve, being there for him as Steve finished his degree. That way Tony would even be there to see Steve in his graduation robes, stand in the crowd to watch him walk across the stage to accept his degree. His heart could burst with pride just thinking about it.
“Ye—sure,” Brock stammered, and without another word, Steve spun on his heel and walked on, full of confidence.
“They only dug up three posts, we just got unlucky with where they hit the fence. There’s only two good posts between the damage and the watering hole, so we gotta replace them, too.”
He had already caught up on the most recent update, which featured Tony looking handsomely disheveled the day before for a sunrise jog along San Francisco’s waterfront. It was far enough north that Tony had to bundle up against the winter chill, and while Steve’s appearance on The Late Show hadn’t taken him away for more than two days, it wasn’t all that easy to accept that he wouldn’t be waking up that morning to make Tony’s coffee and hold him while he thawed out in a warm shower.
“Thank you,” Channing still replied with genuine gratitude and a smile in his voice, and by some awful, poorly timed luck, Tony finally intervened.
“That’s only point one,” Steve interrupted him to say.
“This is Star-Lord, the eleven week old Boxer mix. He’s a really sweet little guy looking for a family to love.”
Two soldiers elected to walk back to their posts so that Steve and Bucky could make the return journey on horseback. They were both quickly directed to the showers and given all they needed to wash up, including fresh clothes to wear. The limited availability of spare clothing at the outpost meant that both Bucky and Steve were left with the green and gold colors of the cavalry and their unmistakable insignia, the crossed sword and trumpet.
“Shotgun,” Tony mumbled, dangling the car keys at Steve. Steve came to an immediate halt.
A prim and preppy blonde dressed in pearls and a sweater-set looked up at her name.
,” he whined as soon as the door closed behind them. He dropped his plate of food on the workbench and shuffled immediately for the bed, where he belly-flopped with a groan.
Steve stacked two smaller boxes on top of a big box in the corner with his books, then turned to give Tony a wry, long-suffering look. “I told you it was a mess. I can call you a cab if you—”
Most of the six kids in his group guessed variations of “hot!” and “sunny!”, and Tony told them all they were correct.
“Oh, that’s rich coming from you—come on! Clint, you could do so much better than Laura Cooper!”
“And he lived to see another day?” she noted, mildly impressed.
If he thought long enough, maybe Steve could have thought of a plausible excuse. When he was honest with himself, he knew he wasn’t ready to be friends with Tony yet. One look at him, and Steve would be right back to that summer day he stood on his stoop in New York, listening to Tony say they were done. He’d beg for Tony to explain, to reconsider. What problem could they not overcome together?
Cem stood in front of her one day, he made himself comfortable next to her and all she could do was cry. Once again he started braiding her hair, but this time he was whispering calming words in Sil.
Pepper says after a while. Peter snorts at that.
“Whoa, what happened?” Sam suddenly asks, coming from somewhere behind Tony. Given the sound of a toilet being flushed, Tony figures he went to the bathroom.
“Do you seriously expect me to believe this?” she asks angrily. “So, what, you put on some make-up to make yourself look older, bleach your hair? I know you’d do a lot to get what you want but I would never have expected you to sink so low.”
“Right, uh,” the kid mumbles out, taking his audio-recorder into his hands and pointing it at his own mouth. “Mr. Stark. Yesterday, the Avengers have once again finished another battle against yet another deranged mad scientist. What is your comment on this battle?”
Steve just grunts without raising his head. Harry finally has his coffee and takes a seat as well, grinning widely upon seeing Captain America in this situation.
“Peter, I don’t think this is a great idea,” Ned continues, looking actually uncertain about this. “I mean, what if this is illegal?”
“What do I want to do for the rest of my life?”
“He’s not my dad,” he mutters out. “I mean, biologically, yeah, but… I don’t know him all that well. And I can’t really find a way for me to talk to him about it.”
Stark had offered Steve to stay at the tower once it was finished. He had offered it to everybody, claiming that he had big plans. Clint and Natasha agreed to check it out once it was finished. Thor promised that he would come by one day and check it out. Bruce immediately promised to join, which was why he hopped into the car.
In the end, Tony does take Peter along to grab something to eat. It’s not a chocolate bar, but it’s still a good restaurant. Dressed again as himself with the suit safely tucked in the hotel room, Peter finds himself at the table with Rhodey, Vision and Bruce. They’re all talking to each other about the accords, discussing what they think is good and what they figure isn’t really a good idea. Vision is adding his comments in between eating his portions.
And after a whole lot of thinking, he figures he’s ready.
Miles enters the subway. Heading towards Harlem with headphones safely put upon his ears, he looks down at his phone to check the latest news. Disaster-wise, not much has been happening. There haven’t been any reports of the Avengers being called on scene, which is probably good. The ‘smaller’ heroes who limit themselves to saving a city rather than the world stay busy, though. There’s been a report of Dr. Octopus escaping prison once again, and it had been everybody’s surprise when Electro re-emerged last year and still hadn’t been totally taken care of. Next to that, Miles remembers being terrified when a hulk-like Russian guy that called himself Rhino came up on the scene and nearly destroyed Midtown. Sure, school had been cancelled for the days that reparations were needed, but having your life down the line like that never really felt good.
They stop when Steve’s phone suddenly goes off. The loud noise cuts into the air, revealing to everybody outside that he’s here. Natasha lets out a curse, and Steve hurries to take the phone. Nobody’s coming, he thinks they’re safe for now. Quickly, Steve presses the green button and puts the device against his ear.
Sometimes she felt her heart pound so fast and hard, she needed to sit down. Sometimes her sight started shaking and she had to wait a few second before it stopped. It was like her body was trying to tell her something, but Yaël didn’t seem worried as she never fainted or anything. Maybe she just had a lack of some kind of vitamin.
“Wh- you
Dropping the tablet on the couch, Peter starts walking to the kitchen to get some breakfast ready. It’s there that he sees Steve standing in front of the window, holding a cup of coffee in his hand as he stares out into what must be the nothingness. It’s not the city he’s looking at, obviously.
Was that the reason why he had been hesitant to join his brother and father? Yaël knew that Loki’s relationship with Odin had been complicated. Maybe the two brothers came here to say their last farewells to their father. She didn’t know how Asgardians handled stuff like death.
And he’d seen the pain in Stark’s eyes, and the way his breath caught when Peter confessed that she’d died years ago. That expression was not one of a stranger learning somebody he once knew passed away. This look was one of complete distress and agony. This was the face of someone learning that somebody he
They’re divorce-papers, he comes to realize. Looking down, he can see that one party has already signed. All there’s still needed is Tony’s own signature. And the urge to sign is strong, extremely strong. But he can’t do that to somebody’s marriage. He doesn’t know this Tony, doesn’t know his reasons for doing what he’s doing.
“What’s going on?” Yaël asked him while they were both sitting in the sofa’s in front of the window in her bedroom.
“I didn’t! I got someone chasing after me, but I saw you two holding out your hands like idiots so I figured you could use the drive. Come, come and follow me into my absolutely safe adventure. If you’re lucky, you might get to see an angry mutated wolverine, but don’t worry, he’s harmless!” Oh, that sounded extremely legit. Yaël looked at Peter, what should they do? Drive with this maniac friend of hers or being late on the interview?
Might be better, anyway. The tower is probably evacuated during the attack – and whatever was that about, anyway? It seems a bit foolish of Harry to attack the minute he’s out, right? Or maybe they’ve been chasing him the moment he got out? He wonders if he would be allowed to join the briefing to find out, but they’ve never asked him to join; that would mean he isn’t allowed, right?
Now, there's still a part of the series I need to finish before the next timestamp will be posted! Let's get to work!
“Now, what makes these gardens so special at three in the afternoon?” Tony asks. Looking around the place, he finds nothing but the beauty of nature. With the sky blue and cloudless, and the plants as green as is possible, he finds himself in some sort of utopia.
They’re greeted by a lovely woman when the door opens. She introduces herself as Rosie Octavius, so Tony figures she must be his wife.
“Maybe…But I’ll take your sofa.”
. Not to offend or make fun of her, but because they knew Yaël was able to have a good laugh with them. At least it was better than Space Girl with the continuous Spice Girl-music added to it every time Wade made his dramatic departures.
Anyway, that’s in the past. Eventually, Ivan Vanko happened. Pepper went from personal assistant to CEO of Stark Industries along with Tony Stark’s girlfriend, aka the only one who can kind of keep him in check. And it worked for a little while. But then the invasion happened, the Avengers started moving him. And Pepper didn’t mind at all. She rather enjoys her conversations with Bruce, or her discussions with Clint. And sure, she has trouble trusting Natasha after that whole Natalie-business, but she’s still kind of fun to hang out with.
“He did? What did he want?” Tony asks, surprised by Natasha’s reveal. Pepper sees the spy shrug, clearly disinterested about it.
still together. “Just… Peter hasn’t called yet, and I’m a bit worried.”
“Oh, is there something wrong?” Yaël asks with a frown. Peter shakes his head.
Johnny and Peter's mouth fall open, just as their eyes open wide as well. Tony, too, falls a bit silent after that, stopping mid-movement while he was stretching his arm. Then, both Johnny and Peter burst it out in laughter. Steve and Tony startle, turning towards the two teenagers who are getting tears in their eyes and aches in their stomach. After that, Tony stands up, taking his cup of coffee and kissing Steve on the cheek.
. There are hands holding him underneath his armpits. Peter coughs out some water, and then tries to look up.
“Whoa, you’re friends with Black Widow?” Flash gets out, and Peter rolls his eyes.
“Yeah, cool, right? We should team up, become Spideypool!”
She doesn’t know what happened in Sokovia. Tony came back changed, probably realizing he was in a big part the cause of all that destruction in that little country. The Avengers had left for the compound, Thor was back in Asgard or where-ever else in space, and Avengers Tower slowly but surely started to change back into Stark Tower.
“You do realize you left my crutches in the workshop?” Tony then asks with a raised eyebrow.
“Before he’s gone, right?” Tony returns. He tries to pull out of Steve’s hold, but the man doesn’t let him.
Peter rolls his eyes again before closing them once more, trying to enjoy the moment of peace.
“Hey, Flash!” Michelle shouts as a distraction, and that’s Peter’s cue. In just a matter of seconds, he’s balled his hand into a fist, and then without a warning he pushes up, punching Flash straight in the groin. The teenager lets out a surprised shout, and then the pressure is gone from his chest and Peter can jump up again as Flash drops down, already putting his hands down in a protective gesture.
Peter tries to smile as well, just so he’s not too much of an ass against his good friend. “Sounds great,” he says to him. “Oh, and Felicia wanted to hang out with us again, soon.”
“Yes, you once told me you liked his none-judging, joyful attitude.” He pulled out a bottle of water. Steve knew that Yaël was about nervous about meeting these people as she didn’t really remember them, but they did remember her of course.
Only, the moment his locker is closed, he bumps in against somebody, causing for the two of them to land on the ground. The other person lands with his head on an open locker, which must hurt a lot, Peter figures. He quickly stands up.
“Dad, it’s college! Nothing is going to happen to me!” Peter laughs, taking his Dad’s hands into his own. “I’ve survived high school, how bad can college be?”
This is what happens when you mess with the Eye of Agamotto
Eventually, because Tony is the best protected of all of them, he suggests going first. With his right hand raised and ready to shoot, he walks ahead of them to where Barnes tells him to go. They pass some more rooms, finding some broken windows and destruction at some places. Tony can see Barnes is feeling extremely ill at ease being back here.
Yaël walked up stairs. “You have to be kidding me…”
“Here’s my champ,” he says, kissing him on the head, very much as if Peter’s his own son. And Peter loves every minute of it. He doesn’t even mind when May, who has taken out the camera, makes a picture of them standing there. “I’m so glad to be back.”
“Umpf,” Tony complains, leaning his head forward until it’s resting on the counter, right next to his still-full plate of scrambled eggs and bacon. Steve gives him a poke in the arm to get him back up, but Tony slaps his hand away automatically. After that, he decides to just ignore him.
“I already have a part-time job…what if I fill in the other part by working here?”
“Most things are more fragile on Earth, we’re not as strong as you are,” Bruce clarifies. Brunnhilde just inspects the glass for a bit before Tony arrives with the cooled bottle. When he fills the glass, she smiles.
“I suppose that would be alright,” Steve says, giving Wade a small push until the man lets go of Steve. Then he readjusts his shirt for a bit, putting a hand on Wade’s shoulder. “But… you need to understand that killing people just like that is something I’m not tolerating from you anymore.”
“Hey, fuckface. Let go of him,” somebody suddenly says behind him. The hold on Peter’s shirt loosens a bit as Flash turns around. When Peter tries to catch a glimpse over Flash’ shoulder, he finds a young girl standing there. She looks slightly familiar. She has red, full lips that are put into a wide grin, and brown, neat hair with straight bangs that cover her forehead. Her eyes are playful, blue. She looks pale, but has reddened cheeks from her make-up.
“And who are you again?” Fury asks. Tony shrugs.
“Tony?” he asks. There’s no answer. Peter decides to leave them be. He just lets Steve do his thing and resumes his work on the program he’s working on. Mr. Stark gave him a code earlier today, and then told Peter to try and finish it. According to him, it’s supposed to be an AI, much like FRIDAY is. Peter isn’t really sure what he’s supposed to do – especially if Mr. Stark is spacing out again today – but he think he’ll manage.
Of course, that’s not taking in account the sudden blue explosion he’s seeing from a good distance away.
“Peter… You told me a few times that you thought it was strange how the Infinity War passed, didn’t you?” Peter nods, his eyes wide at the realization that Tony’s finally going to tell him. “Well, you were right. A few of us actually lived through the war once before. It lasted for… what, maybe three days? We were just about defeated.”
Formulating a speech and having prepared himself for it all day at school, Peter thought he came to the Compound prepared, only to see that Tony
“Hela, enough!” Thor’s voice rumbled into Yaël’s ears. The God of Thunder finally managed to get back up again, but didn’t look that healthy either. Meanwhile, Brunnhilde was crawling towards her sword. “You want Asgard? It’s yours!” Thor sounded breathless.
Where Flash at first hated Peter’s guts, it seems like he’s warmed up to him ever since Peter defended him from Eddie’s rage. He’s not going to complain. Sure, Flash still throws out some slurs like ‘nerd’ or ‘geek’, but it’s never meant in an insulting way, rather than teasing. Despite that, though, Flash is still pretty much a spoiled ass, of course.
He goes to school, gets back to the tower – even answers some questions from Francis, who had been wondering where Peter went – and then starts on adding the final touches to the device in front of him. He’d been going on a good pace, too, until he got to the final part.
“Hey, Johnny,” Peter greets his roommate, enjoying the guy’s misery a bit too much here.
“Bruciebear, if you wanted to get close, all you had to do was ask, darling,” Tony jokes. Bruce rolls his eyes.
Silence from Tony. Wow, this must be a new one.
Hela grabbed Yaël’s throat before Brunnhilde or Thor even had the chance to jump onto his sister. As soon as Hela pulled Yaël closer, recognition flashed in her eyes, followed by a smirk.
“Well,” Yaël scratched her head doubtfully, “I admire the effort!”
“PETER!” he shouts the moment he catches Peter walking away. Peter’s all too aware of Jessica watching it happening curiously, but he can only hope for her not caring enough about it.
Because Steve is here. And he’s kissing him, and they’re together.
May Parker doesn’t expect much trouble when she gets back to work. It’s been a bit crazy after the move, but after they’ve finally settled in, she’s feeling rather confident in getting back to work.
“Put him through!” he almost shouts, wondering if he should be getting dressed to help him out.
“Something… Wait, you don’t even know what happened? Let me take a look at you.” It seemed like Steve finally acknowledged her presence. He grabbed her shoulders with both hands. He checked her for something, probably wounds or scars, and then he mumbled “How are you even still alive…?” He let go of her shoulders and stood there like that for a moment, frowning, thinking. Yaël decided it was best to give this man the time he needed to process this weird happening.
glad the walls are soundproof, too, otherwise I would never get a night’s sleep when I’m here,” he complains. When a door in the hallway opens up again, Peter looks behind him in surprise. Has Tony
Steve wants to talk. Tony wants to leave. Neither get what they want when suddenly a cellphone goes off. It’s not Tony’s, so it must be Steve’s.
“I want you to understand that you can’t be alone,” Steve says. Then Mr. Stark falls quiet, rolling his chair back a little bit. Peter watches it all happening in the corner of his eyes.
Mr. Stark seems impressed as he looks at the base of the reactor. So far, it’s not working because of the missing ‘badassium’, but Peter is sure that even like this Mr. Stark can figure out if it’s good or not.
“Alright, well, it starts in half an hour or so. Everything is ready. As you know, there’s just one round for each instead of two since there’s three of you.”
And then there’s the rain. Or, the water… And while Peter gets soaking wet from it, Tony can only just stare at his son’s moves. When did he ever learn how to move like that? Because Peter’s got serious rhythm.
“Aren’t they always? Sometimes I wonder if they’re truly happy together, with the way they go at it sometimes,” Peter complains. He looks around the lab, finding that Bruce must have been in the middle of research.
“Is Steve there, then?” he tries then, not having mentioned the man since London. Tony stays quiet for a long time. “Dad?”
Tony is careful, gentle, keeping an eye on Steve’s reaction to everything. He takes preparation well enough, takes every touch with as much enthusiasm as always. They feel each other, love each other, silently promise each other. Tony works steadily, reminding Steve every once in a while, with a soft whisper, how much he loves him. Steve constantly seems like he’s about to lose it. When Tony suggests to stop for a while, he refuses.
“Now don’t go running off with it, it’s like my third phone this year,” she mumbles out, a bit in annoyance.
“Are you alright?” Lopt’s whisper sounded from afar while he was just standing next to her. After blinking a few times, she noticed a drip of sweat running over her face while she was leaning with her arm against a wall. How long was she already standing there like that?
Suddenly there’s another weight on the mattress. A foot kicking him softly in the side.
But now Peter is free again, and the first thing he does is put back on the suit and swing his way through the streets of New York.
And after that, it’s obvious who won. Chrissy hands the belt towards Peter, and the kid takes it with the biggest grin he can put up. He then holds up the belt above his head.
“You’re going with me, like it or not. And otherwise, I start attacking, hurting, even killing these friends of yours.” She grabbed Yaël by her hair, to which Yaël grunted. “So, what’s it gonna be?”
“Hey, uh, what are you doing here?” Peter asks the man that has been driving Peter everywhere for the past fe weeks. Happy, wearing a suit, puts his hands in his pockets and nods at him.
- Arguments
Bruce shudder. “I wasn’t there, but I can remember how he was when I came back. I’ll try and keep it contained.”
He had just come back from the gym, not bothering to get washed to get that sweaty look they were going for. Then he lay down on the bed, with his sweaty clothes still on. Natasha had positioned the camera until only his upper body was visible.
“Stop being so nervous, I’m not going to eat you,” Mr. Stark then says, jokingly. Peter laughs quickly before nodding again.
“Uh, thanks, bye!” Jason waved back at her with a kind smile.
Peter’s not stupid; he knows Tony’s suffering from Steve being gone. He’s seen how badly Tony had taken it the first few days after returning from Siberia with no Captain by his side. The few nights that he does spend in his bed are plagues with nightmares, and every small mention of Steve just gets him to shut down completely. It’s probably why the man wants to distance his life from the Avengers now.
“I live with my Aunt May. My Uncle used to live with us, but he passed away a few years ago,” Peter says, stumbling a little bit over his words. Tony takes another deep breath, wondering how many family-members one kid can lose at such a young age.
Wilson nods, holding up the book to show it to Tony. Last month, Tony passed along a copy of the Accords to Natasha, which she was to pass back along to Steve and his gang. It had been suggested by a few members of the UN – the ones who had pulled Ross off the whole business and assigned a new secretary of State. They haven’t been happy with how everything has happened, and they agree the Avengers are
“Nothing I want to talk about now,” Peter admits. He needs to have a conversation with Harry’s doctors first about how he should handle this. “I’ll tell you later, alright?”
“I, uh, I need to speak to my Aunt for a moment,” he says, uncertainly. The nurse looks back at May, and then nods.
“I guess I can’t just go blame you… You have been acting really strange and I never really did anything to help you…” MJ shakes her head again before turning back towards the door slightly. “Bye, Peter.”
“Oh, that’s too bad,” Natasha states. It’s not really the saddest news there is, but Harry’s been living under this roof for a while now – under
“Steve let me in, he just came back home when I arrived,” Harry explains before Peter can ask. Then he throws himself on the bed and goes to lie down on his back, eyes looking at the ceiling. Peter clears his throat as he inspects his friend.
, the poor Peter Parker who can’t even afford new clothes, managed to get an apartment? You really think I’m believing you?” Flash hisses at him with dark eyes. Peter grabs on to Flash’ hands, trying to pry himself loose, but not trying too hard.
He goes to the teacher, offers his apology. She only remarks that he’s still a bit pale, and that he should maybe go and see the nurse. Peter assures her that he’s doing better
“You pay me new plates!” she growled at Wade as soon as Peter had left. She wasn’t finished with Wade just yet. It surprised her that nobody came knocking on her door yet to check if she was still alive after all the noise of gunshots and shattering plates. But she guessed everyone just minded their own business in this building.
By the time he’s arrived at the Pizza-place, he quickly changes into his uniform and greets the boss, who only grunts at him in response. Deep inside, Peter knows he’s a good man. He just has trouble showing it, sometime.
“Yeah, well, uh, you better keep your hands to yourself this time,” Peter warns her.
The days go on like any others; at school he’s mostly just doodling in his notes instead of paying attention, every day of the week Peter still finds himself working the evening shifts at the pizzeria (with on Friday once again having the creepy guy stalking him), on Saturday he finds himself stuck with ironing the laundry and cooking dinner as Aunt May is lying sick in bed. Sunday he’s going out of his way to capture more shots from the heroes to sell at the Daily Bugle, and in the end all he gets is more shouting from Mr. Jameson. Still, after more than a year of working with him, Peter has gotten used to it.
“Karen, can you connect me to the comm link of the Avengers, please?” Peter asks.
- badly written sex scenes
Mr. Stark might behave like there’s nothing wrong right now, but Peter saw him yesterday. Even if it was the alcohol mostly talking for him, whatever he spoke about must be something that is bothering him to this day.
“I will,” Peter assures him.
“That’s, uh, how long did you, you know, have, you know, feelings for the, you know, friend?”
“Yeah,” Yaël said loudly, so the two women would surely hear her, while keeping on rolling “And I’m sleeping with Thor too, so I have two shower stalls to choose between!” Idiots. The women looked at her in shock and they hurried off to get as much distance between them as possible.
“Actually, I need to say one last thing about it,” Steve quickly adds, pulling his head back. Tony raises an eyebrow. “I, uh… I’ve spent some time with, uh, children. You know, in the other universe. And, you know… if you really want them I wouldn’t mind… you know, wouldn’t mind too much, I guess.”
“Hurry, we gotta catch him before he leaves town!”
“I-,” Peter starts, taking a shaky breath while shaking his head again. “I killed her.”
“The boys,” Yaël answered, “Were being real dicks.”
“You get in when you’re ready,” Tony tells him with a smile. He squeezes Peter’s shoulder once, gently, before letting go. Peter nods, clearing his throat and opening the door. A few steps inside, but all he sees is what appears to be an empty interviewing room. Only one of the chairs is occupied. The stage is clear, the sky visible from the windows is dark.
“Welcome back.” There he was, the black-haired dude. This time, he had a braid tucking his hair back. It looked kind of awesome, though.
Natasha pulls away as if Tony’s skin is suddenly burning. With eyes open wide, she stares at him, her mouth fallen open. Just when she’s about to ask how he knows, Tony shakes his head.
While walking towards the automatic doors, Yaël understood that what she was about to do, was lower than low. It was going to be repulsive, no wait,
Wait a minute… that’s…
Peter answers.
! I don’t need the talk! I’ve had it with May already!” Peter throws at him. Besides, it’s too late to have it. It’s not like Peter hasn’t done anything yet!
Tony and Bruce did their computer-business. Steve, Clint, Natasha and Thor worked out in the gym, trying out the newest equipment Tony made them. There were some moments where Bruce would join them for lunch or dinner, and there were occasions where some of them would help out the two geniuses as much as they could, but frankly the only one with a bit of skill in that department was Natasha.
Yaël’s worried voice asks. Peter clears his throat, feeling suddenly extremely hot in here. Why is Tony looking at him with that smile on his face? Is he on to him?
“Elizabeth, right,” Steve gets out. When one of the guards turn to look at them, he waves at him with a smile. Toomes does the same thing. They might be arm wrestling, for all they know. “Now, just imagine if somebody would drop a building on Elizabeth’s head. I doubt you would like that, would you?”
“Don’t worry, you’re not the first who’s tried. The hammer’s in public like this, so everybody in here can try it out. The person who can wield it can help granting protection to the realm so everybody’s pretty much hoping somebody other than Thor can pick it up.”
“Say it, Tony!” Steve reminds him, voice raised a bit.
“Right, okay,” Strange continues, looking down at the chart. “I don’t normally practice medicine as much anymore, but Dr. Cho called me in for this. I’ve looked over mister Parker’s MRI and there’s just some things that I want to discuss with you if that’s alright?”
. You’ve all made a game of it.”
Miles heard rumors about his return, but never really believed it until he saw it. Now, looking at the green figure mid-fight with the red-and-blue hero he feels another shudder going through him. To him, it’s like the world has never really been without the supervillains. He was only a month old when the attack of New York happened, and 6 during the invasion in 2018. While to his parents the idea of superheroes had been something abnormal once, to Miles it’s just the most ordinary thing.
DNA so that they would only show results in his bloodline,” Tony explains.
“You two are going to lead us, right?” Korg turned to the saved gladiators for an answer, who all started to cheer. Was everybody on this planet as ingenuous as Korg or had that something to do with being locked up for years?
“Do you resent me? For the kid-stuff?” Steve asks then, all of the sudden. There’s an obvious fear in his voice that gives Tony some shudders.
The kid – Raido, Tony remembers, almost appears to fit perfectly in the crook of Tony’s elbow, almost as if that part of his body is just simply
“That sounds so crazy! Let me try it!”
“He’s at home now, with his aunt, recovering,” Wanda added.
Yaël never really liked taking a cab. There were weirdo’s out there, driving around, being…weird. So, after Steve said some encouraging words to Peter before he took off again, the two of them stood outside, waiting for a taxi. It was silent for a moment, so Yaël started daydreaming a bit, making mental sketches of the cottage she lived in in a former life.
- Tony's usual self-hate
And Steve couldn’t help but feel some bitterness at the idea that Tony went behind his back. He didn’t really know
going through him. He remembers last time a girl took his hand to put down her address, a little more than two years ago now.
“Rhodey’s here, too. So is the Princess; she said she wanted to try and help with getting the suit off.”
“Me as in Spider-Man? Or me as in the hidden child?” Peter wonders.
“Who would have thought Tony Stark to be lame?” Peter mutters jokingly, and Tony puts a hand on his chest, pretending to be shocked and insulted by it. He throws his hand on his forehead, leaning his head back as he acts like he’s fainting. Peter just snorts and turns around until his back is leaning against Tony’s side.
She knows Steve would never do anything. He’s never been anything but kid towards Pepper, and he clearly doesn’t look like the kind of guy that would just go and steal boyfriends. But Pepper’s territorial, and Steve having a secret crush on her man… it eats her up inside a little bit.
He had to be kidding her, right? He read her files, he helped her through the tests once she woke up in that hospital-ish place. He must’ve got some info about her birthplace.
Peter snorts before following Johnny inside. There’s an elevator, though it looks like it’s about ready for retirement. Knowing that, if it gets stuck, they’ll find their way out of it, Peter and Johnny risk the elevator without any hesitation.
Peter can see Tony stumble through the portal. It’s a relief, the biggest one he’s felt in the past few weeks, to see him get through unharmed other than a few scrapes, looking dusty and dirty. Peter wonders in what kind of world he was sent to.
“I’m not sure…Any suggestions?” Heimdall raised his eyebrow with a little smile. The new king was, obviously, still a young one. “Miek, where are you from?” he asked to the unmoving purple creature in Korg’s hands.
“That’s not all, is it?” Steve suddenly asks, eyes resting on Bruce who looks like he just wants to be away from here. Tony swallows through a hard lump in his throat, realizing that this might not be the best news he’ll hear.
Chapter warnings:
“Then talk to me.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Of Adaro, I see,” he said while wandering around, looking for the right buttons to open the cells. “You know, I was already wondering why there was a trail of frozen guards this way-”
“I might have realized, in these days that you were gone, that things might have gone a bit too fast between us,” Tony admits. And it’s true, too. They kissed once, and the next time they saw each other they were in bed together! Not that they’ve done much other than making out, but it comes out to the same thing; they’ve been acting too much like an actual ‘couple’ instead of actually working up to it.
“The kid signs, or he quits. It’s as simple as that.”
“That’s not important now. What is of importance is that you break out of that cage.”
“Who? You can’t mean the Avengers, right?”
Happy drives them there. Just when they arrive, a quinjet lands. Peter only sees it shortly in the corner of his eyes, mostly through the reflection of the windows. He can’t see the ship in itself, not being in the right position for it.
the trash-container this time. After that, he pulls himself up into the air with a well-placed web.
It’s around half through the third week that Pepper Potts actually came up to find Mr. Stark, only to see that he
“I, uh, you, uh, we-“
Then she hurries off after grabbing for her bag. Peter feels his mouth fall open from the surprise, and Ned, too, seems just as confused about what just happened. Harry sighs with a stupid smile on his face, sounding like the cliché love-struck fool from those movies.
“No! I don’t need to-“
He understands venom a little bit now. Eddie’s always been strong, he’s a jock after all. But he’s not agile, not fast. Venom heightens the person’s powers, meaning that Eddie’s not as fast as Peter. The best thing he can do is keep on moving, then.
The noise stops. Peter goes lying back down on the ground, feeling breathless and aching. His ears are still ringing, his muscles burning. As he tries to regain his breath, he’s barely aware of May running back towards him.
“You are a reckless one, let me tell you that,” the man says, sounding kind of frightened. How adorable, the guy is thinking about his safety. Peter feels honored, if it wasn’t for the fact that the Captain has no idea who exactly he is behind the mask.
“He still is, right?”
He recognizes the blue glow of the Arc Reactor everywhere.
“Yaël,” Steve said. She looked up and saw Cap giving her a dangerous stare. Great, he was going to play daddy Steve again? Yaël held her hands in the air and rolled her eyes. Sure, she reacted a bit sassy, but that she needed no protection from someone called Tony. That name didn’t sound horrifying at all and it belonged to the mystery-dad of her one friend and to the crush of her other one. So, the guy couldn’t be a complete monster, right?
After that, Peter is gone, and as if an unseen force has pushed him, Tony falls down onto his chair and his whole body just becomes so heavy that he feels like he might sink through the floor. His chest is hurting; from his quick breathing or his fast heartbeat, he doesn’t know. He’s actually sweating, and he doesn’t know if he’s imagining his muscles tensing and relaxing continuously.
“FRI, can you start up the files for Extremis?” Tony finds himself asking.
“Jane Foster,” Thor starts, loud voice blooming all over the hall. Steve smiles without realizing it. There was never a doubt that Thor really
He steadied his breathing once more, and for the first time, Tony noticed the leather cord around his neck. Peter reached up and played with the necklace at his collarbone, unconsciously. He pulled at it, and the charm that had been hidden moments before fell out of the collar of his tunic. The stone glinted a vicious red in the dim light of the workshop as Peter turned it between his fingers, still staring at the wall ahead of him. Tony watched the reflection of light dance across the wall and he knew at once what it was. It was something that had come from an Olympian—a necklace charmed to always reflect light, even in the darkest of the places. It shone unnaturally in the depths of Pyra, and Tony knew without question. Peter was a demigod.
Before he had a chance to come up with some sort of explanation, his phone buzzed again. This time with a picture message.
“You’ve been with Tony Stark,” Fury said, and again, it wasn’t a question.
Steve sat up a little straighter in his bed, the sheets pooled at his waist, but he couldn’t be bothered with them this time. This new information gave him a glimmer of hope that he wanted so badly to grasp on to and run with—the hope that there could be some sort of  unity among the gods, something to persuade them to rise up against Fury. “So what did you come here to tell me?” Steve persisted, looking at the goddess in front of him with an unspoken challenge in his eyes.
okay,” he said, his voice still weak and bordering on pleading. “It’s just—you’re up there, and now—now Steve is up there. Anything could go wrong at any moment. At
With his message, Steve sent another picture. This time minus the underwear that were barely there to begin with. Tony groaned to himself and threw his head back on the couch. He put his feet on the floor in front of him and spread his legs wider than necessary, palming himself over his boxers. He snapped another picture of his hand around his bulge, this time making absolutely sure it was at an angle that flattered his size before he sent it.
“He’s in here?” he asks, pointing at the toilet. Is Tony already back in New York? That was fast! He must be
“Well, eh, this kind sir needs to meet the king.”
“Could be Osborn’s? Heard they were friends in the past?”
“What did he do?” Natasha asks. Tony shakes his head. Natasha doesn’t know about Peter being Spider-Man. Nobody does. Tony figures it’s his own job to tell them that.
Tony just laughs and taps his back a few times.
Yaël heard the secretary’s voice coming from the intercom-telephone-thing on Stark’s desk.
“It didn’t happen, okay?” Steve mumbles against his ear. “Peter’s alright. He’s in class right now, he sent us a text only an hour ago to say he was headed to the campus.”
“Boys! Time for dinner!” May shouts in the background. The two look up towards the hallway. Peter’s bedroom at May’s apartment is a lot smaller than at the penthouse, but Peter’s pretty much used to it by now. He hurries out of his room with quick steps, gently poking his father in the side before getting into the hall.
“Don’t tell me you actually plan on watching this…?” Sam asks with clear disgust in his voice.
His ears feel like they’re exploding. It hurts so much, his first instinct is to just put his arms right back and protect them. But he can’t; he needs to make sure Eddie’s out of there before Johnny can continue on their plan.
It’s obvious that there has been as much attention put into Jane’s hair. It has grown a bit in the few months that she’s been here. It’s been put into multiple little braids, decorated with small white pearls. A big part of the braids is put together in one bigger braid. Her loose hair is curled, hanging over her back.
“Shit,” Steve had muttered.
, something that won’t cause any harm.
“As if, you just want me there so you can eat my stuff,” Peter mutters with his mouth full.
“Come on, Peter. I’ll introduce you to a few other members of the family.”
sex in our lives!”
Peter chuckles a bit. “I’m fine,” he says. “Nat took me out.”
“Again, thank you, Wade. You’re great!” Yaël hugged her friend.
"Sounds cool," he says. Then he moves away, getting back to his own desk to start working on his homework. After pulling out his papers, he can hear Tony talking behind him.
I'm quite happy, I saw a baby be born today! Oh joy!
Peter clears his throat and offers the phone back to Michelle before collecting his papers together and putting them into his bag. With his wound still stinging as he tries to get up, Peter attempts to get more distance between him and the girl who seems intent in finding out what exactly Peter is up to. What he wasn’t counting on was her following him the entire time.
“Well, there is this squirrel wandering around in the city, and it’s the size of a girl. A girl-sized squirrel!” he answered excited while paying the driver too much money. Well, that sounded like something Yaël had to see, too!
“Of course, Peter. I’ll see you soon.”
Peter scoffs. As if… For a moment he just wishes he could tell her, but the only three persons who know are Harry, who is still in Paris, Ned who is in MIT, and Johnny who is currently still pissing Peter off. Having a roommate was never supposed to be easy, everybody told him, but Peter’s just about ready to just buy a place of his own and stay there alone.
Tony looks up and then nods. He doesn’t speak. His dinner has been brought earlier, but he hadn’t taken much of it, really. It’s a distraction after all, and he doesn’t need that. Besides, the idea of eating makes him want to puke on the spot.
“Until next time, Spider-Man,” the girl greets him with a wink, saluting him. “Oh, and the name’s Black Cat, in case you were wondering.”
Underneath, there’s a text. Quickly, Peter reads the title.
“Yeah, uh… you have any idea why?” Cap asks. Peter shrugs.
Steve is quiet when he steps forward. His arms are resting behind his back, and now he, too, is looking at the rain falling down on the landscape in front of them. There are a few people outside trying to run back in with their jackets high over their head. Tony wonders if he could excuse himself from going home with this weather, but Pepper wouldn’t buy that.
Peter blinks, his head aching from all the confusion. “Because I saw him die? He got shot by a thief I didn’t stop out of pettiness. He died because of me…”
Peter smiles at her, and then gives her a little wave. He remembers the day he had been introduced to her as Tony’s son. At first, there seemed to have been surprise on her part, but that didn’t take too long before she started slapping him on the arm, saying ‘I told you there was a mini-you somewhere!’ for about five times. She’s the one who helped them out during the entire ‘legal father-and-son’ thing, and has been kind of an unofficial distant aunt of some sort. He doesn’t see her too often, but when she’s there she’s always making sure that he’s doing alright.
“No, according to her Odin is dead. Thor is the new king. They said that, whoever this new enemy is, he threw Thor away into space like he was nothing. Loki then used some leverage to convince him to let everybody go.”
“Why do you even care?” Yaël mumbled while pushing herself a bit up so she’d be able to lean against the cold, metal wall.
They’re making a plan of attack. Peter’s not all too sure about it. For a reason, he’s glad he’s all the way over here, while they’re all in a whole other part of the city. The others are probably right; he’s not ready to get back into a fight. He’s too distracted, too low in his head. Peter looks up at Harry and nods to indicate that they should keep moving.
“Don’t touch him!” somebody’s voice says through the headphones. Peter realizes Hope was reaching out for him. It’s Shuri who’s talking, probably through an intercom. “The suit is going to attach itself to you! Peter has to repel it on his own!”
“Oh, no,” he muttered. He walked towards his family and wrapped his arms around them. Yaël saw him making Tony lean into his arms. A tear made a way through the dirt on Cap’s cheek. He closed his eyes, like he was testing if this was just a bad dream. But apparently, it wasn’t.
“Mama, Spider-Man saved us!” Toby says proudly, pointing towards Peter. Andrew doesn’t move at all, still deep into his embrace with his mother. Peter can’t blame him, he’s extremely young and probably thought the entire time he was going to die.
“I don’t know what’s happening? Did something happen? Did they drop the charges?” Peter asks. Steve lowers his gaze and Natasha shakes her head.
“Jeesh, the nerve of that guy,” Harry mutters out. Once he’s turned around to check after Peter, the boy is already running.
“Sorry to burst your dream-bubble. I mean, I get you, I really do, but that hot piece of ass is already taken,” Tony says while picking up his cup and taking a large sip from his coffee. Darcy pulls her hand away, groans and drops her head onto Steve’s shoulder.
- Stony Date FINALLY
,” as soon as the photograph showed up the screen, Yaël gasped and dropped the money she was holding ready to pay as soon as her sandwich was ready. There she was, on the screen, in front of a whole store, no wait, in front of the whole city. A fragment started playing. Someone had filmed her, clearly with a cellphone, seen by the terrible quality, floating down from some sort of… uh…spaceship. Beneath her, weird alien-looking creatures were attacking everything that crossed their paths. Yaël saw herself steering flames into buildings, freezing people, slowing people down by sending gigantic waves in which they tumbled away.
“South Park, huh? That’s cool,” Peter remarks, making the two men look up. Tony’s head is resting against Steve’s shoulder, who has an arm resting on the head of the couch, another on Tony’s leg.
“Good,” Tony says, and Natasha sighs.
Peter shakes his head, until he realizes what the girl just said.
“My blood’s not a good idea,” he admits.
“Yeah, I called around. Someone is coming to get her out. They’re bringing her to cells in the compound.” Yaël nodded as she closed her eyes again, good. “I’m going to bring you to the compound too.” Her eyes flung back open.
mom was all about sapphires, because unlike most stones, they appreciate in value.”
“What was it you said you did for a living?”
“You’re going to be in the lecture,” Steve told him in a gentle tone while they lay together and let Tony soak up his reward. But content as he was, Tony still couldn’t help frowning at Steve’s news. He bit his lip and struggled to keep eye-contact with his master, but in his rush of anxiety, his traitorous body clutched around Steve’s softening cock. On top of him, Steve moaned softly, and he rolled his hips again, indulging in the soft, wet heat of Tony’s body.
“A peanut butter lasagna.”
The minute the three of them were all free from their respective meetings, Thor, Tony, and Bruce all hustled into Tony’s office and shut the door behind them.
Tony wouldn’t let that weigh on his mind. He straightened his back, pushed his shoulders back, and held his chin high, and with deliberate confidence, he told the Scraps, “Steve Rogers is not to go without me, I am his ward and his mentor. It is my duty to ensure his safety and integration into society. Besides, as Steve Rogers suggests,” he added with a little smirk, “I have matched your meat.”
Then, more quietly, Steve carefully said, “I didn’t want to mess this up.”
With Mr. Perfect effortlessly bracing his weight and Marple leading the way, they made steady, if lumbering, progress. Soon they reached the trail, and Marple confidently directed them to the left.
In his hurry to get Steve all to himself, Tony pushed the tray in to back Steve further into the suite so he’d have enough space to throw his duffle to the floor and shut the door behind them.
“That is not fair, and you know it, Buck,” Steve said before Bucky had a chance to finish his thought. “She loves what she does, and her work matters. Not just to her, but to others.”
Somehow, it worked. Tony backed off the porch and swung himself onto Dummy’s back with such ease that Steve’s mouth fell open at the sight.
“No later than 9am, Carter,” Steve reminded her before hanging up.
A chilly tingle of excitement ran down Tony spine.
The hand over his mouth muffled Tony’s first, breathless moan of pleasure, and Steve angled Tony’s head back to bite into the shell of his ear, releasing it slowly past his teeth before he clamped down over Tony’s earlobe again and sucked on it with insatiable delight.
“Gentle,” he whispered, but Tony barely heard him. At the first smell of his musk, Tony dared to open his eyes, and seeing the gift presented to him, he
“Is that a problem?” Tony asked in a careful voice. “I thought you knew I was into guys, too. Is that—”
“I’ll grab some popcorn, honey, no need to worry,” Tony assured him, “it will hold me over.”
A loud knocking on the door woke Steve the next morning before his alarm ever had a chance to ring. Sluggish and still disorientated from sleep, Steve stumbled out of the bedroom, through the sitting room, and down the hall to the front door.
“That’s always a good choice.”
no. You can nurse me back to health at my place, come on.”
Thor frowned, but Bruce threw his hands up. “It wasn’t even the first date!”
The tension around the man’s eyes eased as he started to smile. “Thank you,” he started to say when his phone suddenly buzzed to life in his suit pocket. He excused himself quickly to check what it was, and frowned to himself.
“That is not an apology,” Steve pointed out as the man tried to explain.
Steve’s eyes must have bugged out at the question. He missed one assignment, did that really warrant public shaming? He swallowed down his discomfort and turned to Sharon with a small (mortified) smile.
“You should be,” she said over him. “They are highly competitive, you need to plan ahead. Build up the right experiences, and the right connections. Developing these connections takes time and investment, you have to demonstrate your character so people know you are reliable. A team player.”
Tony was fucking himself on Steve’s cock with such skill and such nimble dexterity that Steve forgot to breathe, forgot to do anything except hang on and try to commit every second of Tony’s performance to memory. The combined effect of seeing and hearing Tony’s full ass cheeks slapping together and feeling the intense grip around his cock every time Tony threw his hips back was all that Steve could take. He tried to grunt out a warning before instinct took over, but Tony only squeezed down on him harder, snapped and wiggled his hips faster.
“What—what are,” Tony tried to say, clearly aware enough to know Steve normally wouldn’t be so forgetful but too groggy still to form complete sentences. “I’m, I’m up, Steve, I’m—what’s up?”
Steve caught Coulson and Bucky exchanging looks, but try as he might he couldn’t catch their meaning. He tried squinting at them for answers, but when he was ignored on both counts, he found himself too tired to care. Three weeks without a good night’s sleep made a man care less about the world.
A tall, broad man with long blond hair opened the door, wearing a red tunic and gold-wire glasses. Tony spun around in a coughing fit, and Steve reached out to gently pat him on the back.
Hammer looked him up and down with an unintelligible expression. There was no telling if he was checking Steve out or had other intentions, but eventually he heaved a dramatic sigh and looked Steve in the eyes. “When they said some bookworm figured out the pattern, you weren’t what I pictured… Guess you got some brain for that brawn, am I right?”
Steve made it far in the hammer throw competition, and then to Tony’s endless relief, he was quickly eliminated in the caber toss. They spent the next hour or two wandering through the crowds, and Steve comforted himself with roast lamb and a platter of grilled peaches and figs with ice cream for all his effort and losses. They paused here to watch young children competing in agility courses with their bunnies, and there to see the older kids doing the same with their dogs.
“I care for him, too,” Stephanie confessed quietly, but with a nervous excitement. “Should I tell him? Should I tell him first, or should I only ask? What if I tell him, and he tells me, but then I am—I am, I am to take the Chief as my bride, this could only be for a mating, I—”
wants to get out, but he’s not really feeling like starting to explain that crap to them. They wouldn’t understand, either way.
“Andrew,” the little red-haired boy says, grey eyes giving him a sad look. Peter lets out a short breath before squeezing his shoulder shortly.
Harry’s the first one to arrive. Technically, that’s not hard, since he still lives here. He comes in the room with his bags from the store. Before Peter can ask what he bought, he opens it up.
She figures, the first strain on their relationship must have been the Ultron-disaster. They had a fight about it, before everything went down. Tony blew up all the suits, Pepper thought their lives could finally get a little bit back to normal. But she should have known Tony couldn’t let go of Iron Man. She should have known that he would want to join his teammates on their mission to take care of HYDRA, and their pursuit for the scepter. Thor came back, and gone they were.
Peter doesn’t know what else to say, knowing that a lot would have been different hat Mr. Stark known that Peter was there. Even thinking he was Richard Parker’s son, Peter is sure Mr. Stark would have looked out for them.
Norman just looks so young back here. To Tony, he died years ago, leaving his son with a terrible, uncurable sickness. He’d been grey and faded as far as Tony could remember. Here, he looks good, still. Well enough not to need tons of make-up to hide away the degeneration of his body. His reddish-brown hair neatly combed back, his chin cleanly shaven.
