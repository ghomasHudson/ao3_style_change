The suit is in various scenes, but never Tony's face. Never his hands. Never him.
He pulls up the viewable PDFs for the statistics for the team before sliding the tablet back to Cap.
like even his cells know.
”Almost took us too long,” she says over the clammer of the battle.  “But we finally got the last two back from Coulson’s team today.” Her eyes flick up to the big plane coming in.
He heads back to the table and picks up a StarkTablet.  Bruce follows as he continues to the screen, changing the display until it show a directory of files for his different files.
Steve sits in the lab a lot after that.  They share space and silence.  It's comfortable, an ease Steve hasn't felt in a long time.
I can’t tell you who or who not to trust.  I’m not so great at picking the right people.
Because when he peeks through the doors, his mother, younger than he remembers, is sitting at the piano.  Her hair is darker than he can ever conceive it had been, except in pictures he has kept locked deep in the manor in New York.  Her face isn’t lined, and her eyes are closed, lifted to the sunlight.
Steve ends up doing three shots from Natasha to ignore her knowing smirk before heading up.
"Be careful," Nat murmurs, while Bruce and Tony argue about math again. Steve watches them with a small smile.
From 54985-466-8653
Steve remembers looking for Bucky and only finding dust. He remembers watching Tony fall. Both Tony's.
From 54985-466-8653
Steve finds him after and says, “You know I don’t hate you.”
The elevator door shut, but both ignores it.  Tony pulls his feet away from Rhodey’s death grip and crosses them under him, tablet discarded on the armrest and a decorative pillow in his hands instead. “Okay it’s not the best,” Tony acknowledges, ignoring the Hulk sized issue in the room.  “But we both know it’s better than Mr. Stank, which is just childish and annoying.”
He rolls his shoulders and nanobots replicate more missiles and give him an increased shoulder area to launch them at Thanos before shrinking down again.  Then he hurtles down to Thanos, hoping to grab him unaware.
Tony gets off the bed, tugs the IV out, and puts his hands on the windows.  He doesn’t know this place. This location. He looks out into the brightly lit night.  There are brightly colored holograms, showing two women talking before leaning in close and shifting into text
(Especially after Natasha hands him a paper with the victim list of the Winter Soldier and sees
“That was a personal choice,” FRIDAY reminds him.  “And thus a personal problem.”
Steve looks up from where he is packing his supplies to Tony walking in a few hours later. They both freeze for a moment before Steve looks down at the case of paintings he was boxing up. "I'll be gone soon," Steve offers, eventually.
“But the stepkids are a lot,” Tony finishes fondly.
“FRIDAY,” Tony barks.
Keep me in the loop if they start doing something shady
Tony is gasping for air, breathless as he says Steve’s name like it's the last thing he will ever say. Tony loses all speech the second Steve pulls back, fingers readying Tony with only spit and not enough time, but he wants this to hurt, wants this physical reminder that Steve is here, Tony writhing under him.
“I think I’m too drunk to care,” Tony replied, now leaning against Rhodey, “Someone walk me with me. It wouldn’t make sense for me to be alone, y’know.”
Tony could hear Clint snicker not too far from him. Bruce and Natasha were probably rolling their eyes beyond annoyance right now. Tony couldn’t help himself; he liked rousing up the guy. It was refreshing to see that seemingly perfect streak slip up a bit.
------
“Getting high behind the bleachers again, Stark?”
“See you, Coulson,” Steve plainly said, before watching him leave.
Tony could see Steve in the process of zipping his backpack closed before glancing up at Coulson. Yep, he looked really confused. They must not have told him about this whole situation beforehand, especially since Tony was suddenly thrust into this project.
“You’ll be helping a team of other students and construction workers build a daycare center for the school. Don’t worry too much, the volunteers are more than happy to teach you the rounds as you’ll be working closely with some of them too,” Fury answered, Tony could practically sense the condescending sound to his voice, “Oh, and you’ll actually be reporting to your first day of work after school today. They desperately need an extra pair of hands since there’s such a small amount of volunteers working right now. You know Steve Rogers, right?”
His massive array of projects, inventions, quick-learning, and his excellent grades without having to apply himself into his schoolwork unlike most of his classmates, substantiated that fact. He was guaranteed to get accepted into MIT, his dream college – not only because of his family connections but his perfect ACT scores, his engineering prowess, and his high marks.
“What are y’all doing without me?” Tony spoke up, making his presence known.
“Shirts looking a little tight there, Rogers.”
“Can we not talk about him?” Steve said, a sudden bout of annoyance in his voice.
Bruce wasn’t currently with them; Tony guessed he had found another group of his friends to mingle with for the night.
“I was wearing boxers…” Tony mumbled. Sweat pooled at the edges of his forehead. Now this was absolutely humiliating.
Tony opened the door.
Oh, shit, he was talking to his mom.
“Sit down, Stark,” Fury said, in his deep, intimidating voice. God, was he always so uptight and unsmiling?
“…Yes.”
Tony crossed his arms.
“What exactly am I going to do in this construction project?”
------
“Good,” Tony replied, “Did you ask her out yet?”
She pulled out a lighter from her pocket and lit her own joint first before proceeding to light up Tony’s and Clint’s.
Right at 3:59, Tony entered the room, his heavy steps catching just a couple of the students’ attentions. He did a once-over of the people in the room, a lot of them enthusiastically chatting amongst each other as they were clearly acquainted with each other through this volunteering opportunity. The desks were arranged in a circular formation, creating an open, collaborative environment. As expected, he saw Steve Rogers sitting in one of them. He wasn’t aware of Tony’s presence as he was busy speaking to the person who sat next to him.
“S-sorry force of habit. That’s what all my friends call you-”
He nearly cackled; he could practically read the exasperation from her reply.
Tony saw a middle-aged man approach him. He recognized that to be one of the guidance counselors, Phil Coulson. He had an approachable, amicable air about him, yet he was stern when the time called for it.
At the sound of Bruce’s voice, Tony shuffled around in his seated position. He did not want to stand up.
The four had found a relatively hidden location behind the bleachers of the football field. This was where they would sometimes congregate and do...whatever recreational activities that weren’t so school friendly, such as...
They were the star students, always coming to class obnoxiously early, sucking up to the teachers, and seen as model pupils of the senior class. They always acted as if they were one step ahead or even superior to the more rebellious students like Tony, Clint, and Natasha. They participated in many school clubs, played sports, had decent enough grades, and were just all-round liked by everybody. If Tony counted, Sam Wilson probably had more than six extracurriculars racked up on his school resume, just for this year alone.
He placed his phone back in his pocket before walking again.
Wait.
Steve’s attention diverted towards them, suddenly interested in the conversation, not that he would ever admit that.
------
“Oh my god, this is classic,” Clint said, within laughing fits. He was seated and leaning over on the trunk, unable to keep it together.
He tossed his coat on the couch before walking to the kitchen area.
well off. What salary did school principals make these days?
Pepper gently cupped the sides of Natasha’s face. Natasha held onto the other’s wrists with her hands, securing them in place. There was a whistle or two amongst the silence before Natasha leaned in and pressed her lips against Pepper’s. Seconds later, they removed their lips from each other, amused grins on their faces.
The building they were working on became closer in view with everyone working on it, construction workers helping the volunteers making sure they were doing things safe. Tony continued to follow Steve, making sure to stay on the bulldozed area.
“Ah, maybe it’s cause you’re not attracted to men.”
“Tony, Steve. Can I have a word with you both?”
Shit.
“What’s the difference?”
“Yeah, that’s okay,” Steve finally said, in a neutral voice.
“Holy smokes. Has P.E already started?” Clint said, shooting upwards from his laying position and peeking outside from the corner of the bleachers.
“Please, Gamora,” Tony begged, slightly jutting his bottom lip out in a pout, “I fell asleep like a dead weight and my alarm didn’t work for some reason. The teach won’t even tell me if I ask him at this point, c’mon pleaseee–”
After a few last words, Steve hung up. He looked down at his phone in silence, caught up in his own thoughts. He didn’t like lying to his mother, but having her constantly concern herself with his problems 24/7 wasn’t any better. She had much more important things to worry about; she didn’t need to worry about Steve slowly unraveling over the mountains of work he had ahead of him.
Before Tony could say anything, he felt an object hit him square in the face. He briefly glared at Steve before eyeing the uniform that was thrown at him. It was a standard orange vest with a couple of yellow stripes strewn across it. They came with a pair of dark, durable work pants.
“Shh!” Pepper shushed him, earning more snickers and laughter from the others. She handed Tony his outfit, “Now put these on before you catch something.”
He stepped outside, using one of the backdoors to enter the expansive outdoor living space. Next to it was the spacious back lawn. His eyes lit up and he grinned, seeing some of his fellow friends surrounding the giant bonfire he had help set up with them earlier.
“Am I wrong?”
“Ok, fine, I’ll wear the stupid hat,” He said, in defeat, “What about my shoes?”
“Completely naked, mind you,” Fury added.
“Good Morning, Mrs. Hill,” He said, his voice peppy and upbeat.
Tony almost let out a triumphant smile when he heard a few scattered laughs at Quentin’s expense.
Steve’s eyes darted to Tony’s footwear, a pair of red leopard print Chain Reaction sneakers, “There’s extra pairs of work boots you can try on for today. Coulson will order some new ones for you once you tell him your foot size. Same goes with the rest of the uniform.”
“Yeah, I guess,” Tony could only say, “I’ll cook you guys up a fattening breakfast. It’s the most I can do right now.”
“Damn, that obvious, huh?”
“It’s true and you know it, babe,” He countered, only causing her to angrily glare at him.
“Bruce, I can handle it. I call them and they come clean up the mess,” He replied, knowing what he was about to say, “And we have homework to catch up on, cause god knows we didn’t finish all of it.”
“What are you doing here, Tony?”
He couldn’t believe this was actually happening. Maybe this was worse than being expelled. Or maybe not. Maybe this was a horrible, horrible dream or maybe he was hallucinating. He didn’t sleep so well last night.
He saw Principal Fury, signature eyepatch and all, sitting at his pristine mahogany desk, as usual. But on the other side, his father, Howard, and mother, Maria, were sitting in separate chairs, probably in the middle of a long conversation with the principal before Tony knocked. This was something new, absolutely new. He had never seen them physically here. He had only ever made phone calls whenever he needed his father to vouch for him.
Before it was time for the volunteers to leave for the day, one of the construction workers had Steve help Tony screw the edge of a drywall sheet that was hung. They worked closely with him in case the first timer would make any mistakes.
Tony waited as he noticed the words “typing…” periodically appear beside Peter’s name. He could sense Peter’s excitement through what was probably his sporadic typing.
“He’s just a kid depraved of attention; you shouldn’t let him get under your skin. He’ll move onto someone else to annoy if you ignore him.”
Outside of the apartment complex, he took quick strides, his hands in his pockets. It was extra chilly today, at least chillier than he anticipated in the morning. He hated this weather. At least winter break was coming soon. He could wind down a bit as there wasn’t as much schoolwork and extra-curricular commitments for him to worry about.
“You said you’re good at building things. You like to tinker with stuff all the time, right?”
“Don’t worry, you worrywarts, I’m not going to go completely naked,” Tony retorted.
“I won’t make a habit of it, only cause you worry about me Bruciebear.”
The construction site looked like…well…a construction site. It was isolated behind the school, a quarter of a mile from the building to be exact. The field was vast, the soil neatly paved and the rougher edges away from the building that was being worked on. Tractors, excavators were neatly dispersed throughout as the volunteers were getting ready to continue on with their assignment for the day.
Tony could hear the dispersed laughter from the others once he was done parading himself. Fuck, he was freezing. That was when he speedily made his way towards the truck, jumping onto the trunk bed. His harsh landing on the truck’s bedliner didn’t help his initial discomfort.
“Asshats that are eye candy, Clint. I’d let the blonde one have his way with me if I could.”
The first one was for his persistent tardiness to school and the second was for his "conduct" in class. Apparently his “attitude towards the teacher” was what earned him that one, whatever that meant. He was just asking an honest question, wasn’t he?
“Got it,” Natasha replied, in a knowing voice. Bruce wasn’t so keen on smelling like weed for the remainder of the day. His parents would easily pick up on it and he’d be in huge trouble.
“What? What’s he doing?” Wanda said, entirely puzzled.
“I figured,” Tony mumbled.
Tony quickly glanced towards the front of the classroom, seeing Coulson clap his hands together to get everyone else’s attention. He looked back at Darcy who was itching for an answer. Now, she looked kind of perplexed, rightfully so. Why would Tony Stark willingly volunteer for a long-term school project like this?
“I swear to god I’m going to hurl those across the field if you shove them in my face again,” Natasha said, roughly pushing Clint’s bag of cookies away.
Once the classroom was devoid of the other students, it was just the three of them alone. Tony was right next to Steve and the tense environment around them was never more apparent. The air around him felt thick and suffocating. This was pretty humiliating; this wasn’t how he wanted things turn out. Partnering up with uptight Steve Rogers was the last thing he wanted right now.
“I’m just saying, Nat. She punishes me for the dumbest things,” Tony replied, “Clint could talk up a storm in that class and she wouldn’t say anything, I utter a single word and she goes all Defcon 1 on me.”
“Come on, Dad. You know what types of projects I do in there,” Tony retorted. He only huffed when his father wouldn’t respond to that.
He came from a well to do family and had a good enough relationship with his parents. His father was a little impatient with his troublesome antics at school, but he let him off easy. It helped that his job kept him out of the house and often out of the country, so he didn’t have enough time to pay much attention to Tony’s little school infractions such as “showing attitude to the teacher”. His mother just full on spoiled him. That was the consequence of being a rich only child.
His friends. God, his friends.
“What do you mean?” Tony said, wiping his palms across his lap. He was uncharacteristically nervous, yet impatient at the same time. When was he going to get to the point? He had a class to get to.
“I’ll see you after class, by the way,” She said monotonously, clearly more than used to this whole type of situation at this point. Tony just grunted in affirmation.
,” She replied, “
“Just follow me,” He finally said, beginning to take quick steps. His irritation was not going away anytime soon. Tony narrowed his eyes, trying to burn a hole through Steve’s back before beginning to tail him.
-----
“What makes you think I’d know anything about your personal life?”
This was scaring Tony.
“What? My phone?”
Steve’s jaw only twitched before he looked away from Tony and focused his attention on his friends again. He didn’t want to fall for the bait, not again.
“Thanks, Stark, I really, really owe you one.”
Word of his party really did go out.
putting this on,” Tony held onto the helmet like it would singe his fingers any minute.
Tony once more flipped both of his pink detention slips before shoving them into his pocket.
“Mom–”
“You’re so self-absorbed.”
“Hey, uhh, Stark, what are you up to?”
Quentin’s words once again were in the forefront of his mind. That ingratiating fuck really did struck a nerve, to his own admission.
Hopefully, nobody stole anything. That would be bad. Especially after he made sure to lock away any valuables and rooms that were off limits.
“Is that supposed to be a bad thing?” Tony scoffed.
“Tony?”
Coulson had to pair him up with Steve.
“When did you guys get here?” Tony asked, utterly confused. For Christ sake, wasn’t his dad supposed to be at the office today? And his mom was supposed to have an early doctor’s appointment. Before anyone could answer, he quickly took in both of their expressions. His mother had her arms crossed, her stare glued to her lap. Her lips were frozen in a downturned slope. His normally vivacious mom never looked like this. His father had a barely restrained anger, his tight expression speaking volumes. He was absolutely still, trying his damned hardest not to lash out at his son.
“Shit…” He hissed to himself. Tony shut his eyes, trying his best to remember what happened after the streaking. After several minutes passed, his mind was still a blank slate. He couldn’t remember a thing.
“You’re here now, so just tell me,” Tony said, hoisting his backpack up to his shoulders.
“Word about anything I do gets around
Speaking of activities, he was quick to realize that many, if not most, of the school had heard about his “streaking” incident by now, being that information like that gets around quick. Much to Tony’s displeasure, there was also the abject humiliation which came along with the ordeal, especially being sober. But knowing himself, Tony would try his hardest to take it in stride if anyone brought it up.
“Tony, I know you would rather be anywhere than here, but please don’t test me.”
“Okay, now you can test the flashlight on it.”
“Hey, I’m just surprised you don’t know! Then again, it’s kind of embarrassing, so I’d prefer it stay that way,” Tony said, suggestively wagging his eyebrows.
“Okay, I’m next,” Natasha said, “Tony. I dare you to do a run around the neighborhood and sing ‘Hit Me With Your Best Shot’ at the top of your lungs.”
“Did you connect the red wires yet?”
Tony briefly pursed his lips to the side. He could tell that Steve was trying to keep it together, for the love of all things good and holy. This was probably a nightmare for him, but it wasn’t like Tony chose to do this.
“This is disgusting, Clint.”
“You manage to surprise me every single day. I seriously don’t know how you do it.”
“He’s not bad once you get past his eccentric-ness.”
“Who wants to go first?”
Finally,, more interaction between Steve and Tony
Tony was able to get the hang of it quickly. He built things all of the time and used all sorts of power tools such as the ones the volunteers used to screw in the dry wall.
“Yeah, and they’re burnt to no return.”
“What?” Tony glanced back up.
He was supposed to meet everyone else at room B4 of the school building before they were to head outside to do the actual project. Tony briskly walked from his locker before continuing on with a sprint. He couldn’t be late.
“Let’s play another game, I’m kind of over this,” Pepper replied, “I think all of you know my entire life story by now.”
That elicited a few giggles among the class.
“I’m just complimenting you, no ulterior motives,” He replied, he sat up from relaxed position, “I just missed this class last Friday and I wanna know what chapters you guys went over.”
And I am sorry it is taking so long. I hope to do better.
"Hey!" Toni smiled as she saw Peggy smile again. "So you want Steve."
"I would never turn down a bed," he smiled.
Giving up the fight for control, Clint leaned back in the pilot seat. "And there's no fighting JARVIS. He's Skynet and going take over the world, and I don't want to be on his bad side when he does. Right, JARVIS?" he asked with a chuckle.
Until next time. :)
Peggy eyed her before copying Toni's pose. "It's something going around the camp." She didn't explain.
"You're the one who started to act strangely," she stated, getting to her feet. She dusted the snow off her chest and her knees. "But we shouldn't talk about this now. Lead the way," she said as she waved him to go.
The name was familiar to Toni, though she had no idea as to why this lawyer was here. Yes, she was aware that her father used Pearson Litt for his personal attorney rather than the Stark Industry fleet of lawyers for a great many things, but she wasn't sure why that mattered now. Her father, though it was yesterday for her, died a long time ago, when she still attended MIT. "I am aware," she said. "However, I am not sure why you're coming to me now?"
Toni glanced up at Colonel Phillips, who was staring at her. Her eyes drifted to the metal suitcase that was handcuffed to his left hand, knowing what was in the case. She also knew that he was going to hold onto it until the very last second. "What's up, Colonel?" she asked with no interest in referring to him as Salty anymore. Sure, the nickname started out of annoyance, but it grew into fondness, which was now gone.
The Asset knew what his handler meant, but he didn't move. He didn't respond, just stared. His eyes were on the television and the images that flicked by. Rumlow nodded and replied, but the Asset wasn't paying attention anymore. His eyes were glued to the image on the screen as he noticed
"We'll save her," Barnes corrected
In his thoughts, he failed to take account his surroundings, as he walked into a pile of rocks, kicking them over. They tumbled a few feet, crushing leaves as they went. The leaves, even in the wetness, cracked and crumbed under the weight; they crunched loudly, and there was no doubt that she had heard it, even in the rain.
"Ssh." Toni hushed with a finger to her lips, as she tried to calm the man in front of her.
I also hope that you wish to continue this journey with me with Part two. I hope it have it posted in a week, so you might want to keep an eye out for it. Hint hint. You can clink the alert button to follow me or the series.
*O*O*
"I cannot allow that, Miss. Potts," the AI stated. No one could get use to the disembodied voice as it came out of nowhere.
Taking a few deep breaths, Toni reached for the payphone. It was cold against her hand, though she paid very little attention to it. It was nothing compared to what she was already feeling. Without a second of hesitation, she dialed the Stark Secure Server, not knowing who else to call. Considering her house was just blown up, she doubted she would be able to reach Steve, as she knew what the SHIELD's protocol was. Yes, she could call the Pirate, but she didn't trust him, not at all. He was a spy, the spy of all spies, and he was always be up to something.
"Miss," JARVIS started, "It would be unwise for you to go out in your present state."
Something roared inside of her, hearing Steve say that. "NO! I knew he was going to die. I came from the future."
"Me? I talk to much?! I think you're confusing me with you."
Like the night before, two pair of eyes were missed. Like before, they just watched the two women, though one grinned like he was the devil himself. Like a hungry lion, they watched as one of the women settled on the sofa under a heavy blanket to watch TV, while the other prepares a bowl of popcorn. With the plan nearly complete, there was a look of satisfaction on their faces.
When she opened her eyes, she noticed someone run past her. She glanced at the guy before turning back to the alley. "Who's he running from? I know it isn't Steve," she said. It only took her a few steps before she came upon a beaten up Steve and a fit Barnes in a uniform. After getting over the shock of seeing him alive, she looked him over. Just like any other woman, Toni loved a man in a uniform, and she was not against admitting that; however, this was not the time for that. "Barnes."
As she laid there in agony, Toni felt stupid. She, one of the smartest people on the planet, felt like the stupidest person on the planet. It was laughable, which was just what Toni did. For a good few seconds, she laughed as it poured on her. She was really an idiot, wasn't she? She twisted her ankle, chasing after a ghost. A freaking ghost. She was going crazy, driving herself crazy, as she kept seeing things that weren't really there. What was wrong with her? Did she—
"- Cane?"
"I'm great." She put on the biggest smile that she could muster, but Peggy was still giving her a look. "I might've broken my hand on his fugly face, but I'm good. I swear." She flexed her hand to see how bad it was. The skin on her hand was cracked and it was bleeding slightly, but she was able to flex it. "Now, it matches my face," she stated as she brought it to her discolored face which was returning to its normal color.
Rogers looked taken back. "I just need one name. Sergeant James Barnes from the hundred and seventh."
Twitching in pain, Toni struggled in her restraints again, as she tried to pull her hair away from the crazy bitch. It wasn't until a few seconds later that the commander let go, and Toni let out the breath she was holding. After a deep breath, she turned to the Captain. She couldn't let this happen to Rogers… No, she couldn't let anything happen to Steve, her shrimp even if he wasn't her shrimp anymore. This was all her fault, and she couldn't let him die for her, but what could she do? She was tied to a chair, but she had her brain which was all she needed.
"Ouch," he replied, placing his hand on his chest. "So much love in this room. I would ask you to pinch me to show you something, but I think you would do more than just pinch." He was flirting with her again.
She knew he was lying, because she had seen it in his face and had heard it in his voice; however, she wasn't going to call him on it.
"If you want to know, you can have the report, but it won't help." His voice was soft.
"N-no," she cried out, tears running down her face. "Not Perfect."
Clint turned to Natasha, giving her a nod, and without saying a word, the red head disappeared into the apartment with foul expression on her face. Though Toni couldn't be sure, she was sure there was a knife in the assassin hand, as she made a beeline to the super soldier. "I can't…I can't believe this shit," Clint hissed, holding the genius in place. "When Nat is done with him, I'm putting an arrow in him. I don't care who he is. Captain America be damned. He deserves m-"
Oh, she knew. She didn't need them to tell her that. She didn't need for them to tell her anything else. She just needed them to get her back to the tower. "How did he know what time I would sure up in?" She ask, thinking about which time she had selected. Today was not the time she was hoping for. She was shooting for March 18.
Toni smiled and laughed. "I can agree with you on that one. That is–"
Steve smiles softly as he watches the two. Anyone with eyes can see how much Rhodes cares for Tony, and they would be a fool if they think they can hurt Tony in front of Rhodes. "Don't give him any idea, Jim," he says. "We don't need dinosaurs roaming New York."
"Fine, later," Toni said, waving him off. "But definitely later." She would so like to continue this in her room.
"Captain Rogers and Sergeant Barnes."
Toni looked around, and if the hallway was used to judge, that apartment wasn't going to be a million bucks apartment, but she wasn't going to complain. She was out of the cold and she was very thankful for that. Maybe, she could sleep in the lobby instead of a shelter. "This seems like a nice building," she said, forcing out the words.
Though her left eye was useless making it difficult to make anything out, she was able to see that this man was not Barnes or Rogers. It worried her at first, because she had no idea of who this was or the where the hell Barnes or Rogers were. Why would they leave her alone with someone she didn't know? She tried to glance around but the muscles in her neck hurt and she couldn't muster it through the pain.
The former Russian spy wasn't the only one annoyed at the touch. Even if he reasons were different, Steve was as well, and he couldn't hold back his annoyance. No one noticed though, which was probably good as he couldn't help but glance down at his own arms before looking back to Thor, who was still eyeing the genius.
For those interested folks, I want to go into Captain America: Winter Soldiers, though I would have to get through this story first. :)
"Relax."
With Morita and a few unnamed soldiers trailing behind her, Toni made her way toward the control room to see if she could find anything out. After finding her device and making sure it was still function, some time had passed and she had no idea of how the battle was going. Plus she had no idea what happened to Schmidt. Did he get away? As she hated this not knowing, she was on a mission to find out what was going on. She couldn't let anything happen that wasn't supposed to happen, and that would include making sure that nothing happened to Steve.
When he asked her to dance, she wasn't paying attention to him or his face as she was too distracted by Barnes who was talking to some dame. She had no idea of why Barnes was flirting when some chick in front of her. All it did was make her mad, which was probably why she said yes to the dance, but she refused to say that she was jealous of some ugly woman. She had to like someone first before she could be jealous and she didn't like him like him. However, when the man spun her around and started to speak, she froze. Though she couldn't be a hundred percent, he was the man who pinned her against the wall in the alley. As fast and sneaky as she could, she bolted from the man and left the bar.
"Never said you couldn't."
Even though it was a direct question, the Asset knew better than to answer. The Asset didn't speak. He didn't disobey, even if it seemed like he was doing. He did nothing but what he was told. Besides, the Asset didn't know what this woman meant to him or why he wanted her. He didn't even know who she was besides her name.
Again, let me know what you think through the reviews. I hope the end didn't seem rushed. Don't want to drag on forever, and it seems to work to end it here.
"Just admit you're jealous, which would make things simpler?" Toni teased, knowing full well she was playing with the beast. She hoped that someone would notice the fallen guards and check it out; however, she told Salty that she was leaving, so he might think that it was her device that had misfired, knowing how dangerous and wild it was.
The Ring from Steve was simple with a single diamond in a traditional setting; however, it was a show stopper in her opinion. It was simple and classic—not like her, but sometimes, it was the simple stuff that caught your eye. So even if Toni never thought about a ring for herself, she supposed she would've picked something like this…No, she wouldn't have. She probably would have picked a rubber band. Granted, she would have probably been okay with a band of something kind. Toni wasn't picky, especially over a ring.
Toni slowly looked up at the ceiling, thinking about JARVIS. Though the AI wasn't human, he-yes, he- had always kept a close eye on her, making sure she was well. Even now, Toni could tell JARVIS was looking out for her, even if it was just his programing. "You'll be fine," she said, not worried. It was a low risk with JARVIS' watchful eye, though Toni really wasn't worried about her death. Her death didn't scare her, as she would probably welcome it.
"Why didn't you tell him?" she asked, knowing this would upset the Shrimp. Rogers and Barnes were close, and it would hurt him to know that his friend was going to war and could possibly lose his life, while he couldn't do anything. There was also the fact that Barnes was keeping it from him.
"Hey, Salty! What's up?" Toni asked as she hopped to him. She didn't know what it was, but she was happy to see the Colonel, who was a thrill to tease.
"Toni."
"You changed the code."
With the cargo bay open and the boat appearing beneath them, Steve stepped to the edge. He could admit that he felt slightly better, but he still felt like there was another shoe waiting to drop. "I'll gladly hold still for you." He didn't wait for response, and he just jumped, his nerves getting the better of him.
Steve sighed. "I can tell when you're mad."
She turned back to the bed and took her normal spot; however, it wasn't long before she was disturbed again. This time it was by the Colonel, who looked like he was hit by a bus. If he hadn't had thrown her in a cell, she would've been worried about him.
If that wasn't bad enough, she had to deal with the Sassy Agent. She could handle the cold shoulder from Peggy, but it was draining. That woman never let up; she kept going and going and her insults weren't direct, but Toni knew they were about her. At first, Toni didn't blame her, but now, it was annoying. She had no idea why the agent was such a bitch. Was it because she brought up Rogers? Was she as close to him? Was she jealous? Why in the hell would she be jealous? There was and would be nothing going on between Rogers and her. Toni took a deep breath as she thought about it. Maybe, it was wrong to bring up Rogers, but Peggy shouldn't be taking it so seriously.
"You have me," he said, as he ran the tips on his hands up and down her back. Once he calmed her down, he would take her to bed like he had done before, and like before, he was going to crawl in with her. He needed to sleep just as much as she did. "And I'm not going anywhere." The genius didn't respond, only nodding against his chest. "Not leaving you for the world." It was a dangerous statement, considering who they were, and what they faced daily, but he wasn't going to leave her unless it was the end of the world.
Growling, Barnes marches toward the group as anger grows on his face. "No," he barks, his voice ice cold. "We have every right to check on him. Every right!" His hands are balled at his side as he eyes the room.
Toni glanced at Phillips before she turned to Howard, who had taken a step next to her. "Comfy seat?" she asked while wondering why he was sitting next to her.
Bruce let out a sigh, because there was no denying that Toni was a child at times. "Maybe, but we should give her time."
That had Toni laughing because she hadn't been quiet about her distaste for the city. Granted, it could be because she was sleeping
she thought as she took a few steps toward her. She hated when Peggy was upset. "Hello, Agent," she stated as she held the bag over her shoulder.
"…dumb…plan worked…" The first voice says. "Why….aren't…gloating?"
Toni breathed in sharply. This was nothing new, having heard this speech many times after becoming Iron Man. Before she hadn't been scared to hear it, but now, it scared her, as it sounded like she meant it this time. "This sounds…" Toni asked, drifting off.
Not unexpectedly, the Brunette had pissed someone with that threat she made, and she had suffered the consequences because of it. If she was his, this wouldn't have happened, as he would have kept her safe and away from people who cause her harm. He would've kept her in line, kept her quiet. He would've controlled her, forced her to listen to reason unlike that useless Beefy Blond. Why did the Blond let her do such a stupid thing? Did he not understand why it was dangerous for her to do? Besides, why did the Brunette do that? Why was she so careless in giving out her location? Why was she so willing to go into battle? Did she like warfare like he did?
Phillips stepped away from her and the device, putting some distance between them. After eyeing him for a few seconds, Toni set the welding tool in her hand down on the ground and followed. Once the Colonel was sure they could talk in peace, he turned back to Toni. "How are you really?"
"I'm starting to believe Clint."
Howard narrowed his eyes, studying her. "That's not what I expected."
Rhodes gave her a hard look. "This is the President, Toni," he replied.
"So why don't I take you home and you show me how much you like this accent?" he teased, resting his head against hers.
"He's Rogers again?" Peggy asked, eyeing her. Toni took a deep breath as she slipped off the bed and onto her feet. "It makes things easier," she replied. It would've been simpler if she had followed her rules in the first place and hadn't gotten close to them.
However, it was more than just that. Her fingers were also…burning? Though she knew the side effects of long exposure to the cold, this burning sensation took her by surprise. Almost taking over her senses, it took her everything she had not to remove her lays, as Toni knew that her body was lying to her. That shook her to her core, revealing how much she couldn't trust herself, and that scared the crap out of her. True, her judgement was shaky at best, but she never truly doubted her own senses. Yes, she doubted her decisions, but she never doubted herself—her body.
She closed her eyes and allowed her mind to drift. During her daydreaming, the plane had taken off and was currently over the ocean. She could hear the wind violently and ferociously strike the plane as it flew through the ruff air. She took a deep breath as they went through a bumpy patch. Lately, she hadn't been a fan of flying unless she was the one piloting. Her
"What was that?" Clint asked over the phone.
After disconnecting the scanner and pushing the reactor back into her chest, Toni headed back to the camp, knowing that someone would be looking for her. It was about halfway when she noticed someone following her, and for a split second, panic overtook her; she was able to calm herself after a few deep breaths. It was clear that her stalker didn't know that she spotted him. Not learning from past experiences, she circled back to get the drop on her tail, and after a few minutes, she confused, which was something that she could tell from the distance, the man by laying a few false tails.
And yes, more guilt in this chapter.
not being kidnapped again. One, she was not a kid. So adult-Napped? And two, she was Toni Fucken Stark, and she did not get Adult-napped. She did
"Mute," she ordered, knowing she had been muting JARVIS more than she had ever done before. She had been cutting the AI off, stopping him from doing his job. She knew she was being stupid, but she couldn't allow herself to fall apart now. If she did, it would be the end for her. No coming back. If she had to pretend everything was okay to be okay, then she would do it. "I don't have time for this."
"Miss, I would advise against a battle at this point and time. The risk to the general public would be high."
And I want to thank my Beta for getting this back to me. :) She says she really likes this chapter, so I hope you do to.
Steve had a love/hate relationship with Howard Stark. There had been a few times that Steve wanted to punch Howard out, while other times he wanted to hug the man. That was nothing on Toni's relationship with her father, which Toni had described as a roll coaster. She had better memories of him now, especially after the time travel, and she was devastated when she learned her father still died bloody.
Steve stepped toward the door as he tried to stop her; however, he should've known better. He should've known that would only cause a fight.
"I'm sorry to have do this, but I had no place else to crash." Fury said, while writing another text. There was no hesitation in his voice, lying as easily as breathing. He turned the phone, showing the text to them: 'SHIELD compromised.'
The sound of bullets rang though the ship as another explosion rumbled through the ship. Steve could hear people yell and shout, even as the alarms sounded. He could hear someone kill orders over the speakers, but it was all mumbles to the Captain, who was forced on the woman he loved. Fear flooded him as he imagined her death, which almost made his heart stop.
"I have to get ready for the next base," Steve said. He glanced at Toni before he turned to leave. His tone was hard.
"Am I interrupt something?" A female voice asked.
Tony shrugs. "How am I supposed to know what goes on in his Serum filled head? And besides I turned him down."
"Oh, you are," she said, her voice shaky and raspy.
*O*O*
Toni narrowed her eyes at him, and before she could ask what the hell he was talking about, he reached for one of her hands and brought it to his lips. His lips lingered for a few seconds, leaving a wet mess on her hand, and it took everything that Toni had not to punch him. "Geez, what a wet kiss! Good thing I never have to experience the real thing, which I so don't want to experience," she said, yanking back her hand. She mockingly joked that she was vomiting as she wrapped off her hand.
She didn't know what to expect from the Rogers of this time, but she wasn't expecting a messy as hell apartment from Rogers, who never had a hair out of place. He was as neat as they came. "No, girlfriend to help clean?" she asked, knowing that he didn't have an important other. He was innocent as they came to love, and she wasn't even sure he ever kissed a girl before.
"Oh, you have some sass, Captain America. I would have-"
"So no fun," Toni responded when she was ignored. She hated to be ignored.
"Just got it off." Toni waved her arm in the air. "I can move it! It feels so great." She paused as she noticed his smile, which seemed to take up his whole face. "Anyhow, I need to get to work."
Tony doesn't know when the Brooklyn Twins had brought him back to his room, but he can recall them crawling into bed with him and pinning him between them. He recalls feeling completely warm and safe laying between them, and he can't help but sleep a whole 8 hours, which hadn't happen in years. It's total heaven sleeping between those two, and he has no interest in sleeping anywhere else for the near future.
Kicking off the blankets, she leaned forward, almost on her hands and knees. The wires and IV strained as she reached for him. "Don't go there."
Steve calls out. There's something in his voice. He sounds worried, but there's something else in his voice like he's been caught with a hand in the cookie jar.
"Leave him alone," Toni ordered, marching into the room. She was ready to call for Suit if needed. "You've gone crazy, Romanoff."
"I guess," she stated, not really liking the name. She wanted her name, and there was no way in hell that she would give up her name by choice. If she ever got married (no chance in hell she would), her spouse would take her last name. That was not up for debate.
"Which is?" he asked as he was looking through some paperwork.
Before Toni could respond, Rhodes ripped her out of Pepper's embrace into his own. "Rhodes, can't breathe," she muttered in his chest. His grip on was tighter and stronger than Pepper, and there was no way she could break from it.
Ramming his shield into someone's chest, Steve shoved his target back several feet, most likely stopping the man's heart from the impact. "I might take you up on that," he replied. He didn't have
"What?" Steve snapped.
She closed her eyes, as she picked up her head and leaned back in the chair. There was the cold a draft in the room that assaulted her when she titled her head back. It sent shivers through her body, but she couldn't find the energy to move. However, the air was a shock to her system, keeping her awake. "Can you prescribe me some sleeping pills?" she asked, knowing full well that he couldn't.
"I do. With the items taken, it would've been possible for them to affect Stark's Device." Fury with his one eye was able to look at both Romanoff and Barton. If they were surprised or taken back, they didn't show it.
Phillips stepped passed Howard to the open metal case. He reached for the device and slowly started to put it away. "I have a place in mind," he said, catching a look from Toni. "However, I would supposed it would be best for Stark to rest first."
"It's like calisthenics. You might have missed a couple things, you know, doing time as a Capsicle," Toni replied, with a chuckle.
Peggy glanced back at the use of the word Salty. "He still does, but Dr. Erskine doesn't think so. He believes you are no threat."
"We haven't labelled it…" The agent said, slowly as if she was hesitant to speak about it in front of Toni.
Shaking her head violently, she tried to get
And oh, I lied. I said, this was going to be a two shot, but as I was proofing this, I felt it helped the story better if I cut the final half into two chapters.
"It isn't my concern," she stated hastily as she waved it off. Peggy rolled away to hide her face.
Toni's head bobbed in her exhaustion, and it hurt like a bitch. She so wished Roger would come soon and beat his ass, because she couldn't deal with it anymore. "Why would you need me?" she asked.
Pierce pulled back his arm and put the picture back in his pocket. "Scrub him. Double the voltage. I want it deep and through. I don't want him to remember anything."
Dugan grabbed his cane and used it to push himself up. "And how they look alike?"
*O*O*
"Rhodes," Steve called. There was a soft warning in his voice, but it was firm. "Easy."
*O*O*
Howard's eyebrow rose, his lip curled. "Did you forget the promise you made Barnes? You said you would do anything for him? I'm here to help you with that. Have you already gone back on your word?"
"No...NO!" Toni objected. She did not want that. "You keep it."
Okay, that did it. That took his very breath away, though it didn't curb the happiness bubbling through him. "Toni," he utters.
"No need to worry about me, Cap. I can keep up, can't let anything happen to our loud mouth."
"That device won't help you," he replied.
Toni took a deep breath as she stared at her device, which she hadn't tested yet as she hadn't been able to find a safe place. She didn't want to test it around people as there was no telling what would happen; however, there was another reason why she hadn't. She was afraid to, not sure of what it would do and what would happen. She had it hooked up to a core, but there was no way of controlling the core. Once she turned it on, it had a mind of its own, which she learned from the last time she had activated it.
But now I leave you with wondering what Loki is up as he is always up to something.
Upon hearing him, Barnes went for the Private again, but Toni wouldn't let him. She pushed the Private, who was very unstable on his feet, back and stepped toward Barnes, putting her arms up to block him. "Barnes, stop. I don't need you to defend my honor," she snapped. "Now calm down."
that wasn't good. She knew it was a bad sign. No, she didn't have one of those fancy degrees—A fancy degree for the head. She did have a few other fancy degrees, though none for the head. She had nothing for the head, not that she believed in that crap. Maybe, that was the real reason why she was struggling with this, though she did know she felt extremely guilty over Barnes' death. At times, it was overwhelming, and it stopped her in her tracks.
She tried to smile, but the grip around her neck started to tighten and she was struggling to breathe. Black spots started to enter her sight, clouding her vision, and she knew it wouldn't be long before she was out.
she told herself. She had a task to do and she couldn't allow herself to drown in her guilt.
*O*O*
Clint let out a sigh. "I'll get it," he said, shooting a look at Steve, who was still eyeing the suit. He turned and headed toward the door. "I'll get a few. She's probably a drowned rat right now." Natasha shot Clint a warning. "What? She probably does. It's pouring outside. The hobo down the street probably looks between then she does!"
Trip laughed from the driver seat. "My Shield paycheck can't afford your style, besides I like this car. It's the kind of car that no one pays attention to."
Now didn't that sound special? On one hand, SHIELD would have the tools she needed, but on the hand, they were all snakes in the grass.
Shoving her comeback down her throat, Toni gave the man a once over before crossing to the window. The curtains were drawn, and though she knew Fury probably preferred the dark—playing whatever game he was playing-, she reached for the heavy curtains and pulled them open slightly. From the corner of her eyes, she could see the man's eyes on her. She could feel the silent order in his eyes, but she didn't let that stop her. What was he running from that got him so nervous? Whatever it was, it couldn't be good. He was the Director of SHIELD, nothing should scare him.
The jack landed in the corner just as the doors to the elevator opened. "Home sweet home," Toni cheered as she stepped out of the elevator.
"Phillips? He said you would call him by that stupid nickname. I'll tell him you are up. Just relax," the nurse ordered, getting impatient with her.
"Okay," Bucky replied as he watched his roommate turn and run back to their apartment. After he was out of sight, he spoke, "Of course, he would think of a coat when we're almost at the lobby."
"This plane is one of the safest plane you can be on," Peggy stated.
Peggy let out a sigh. "Are you always like this, Sark?" she asked.
Toni pulled back her finger and looked at it. Staring at the fine cut on her finger, she eyed the blood droplets forming. "I don't understand," she uttered. How could the device survived the first transport, but not the return? It wasn't that she didn't trust the aged Commandos, but it didn't make sense. The return trip should look like the departure, should it not? And the device should've been survived, shouldn't it? And if it did, where was it?
that there was nothing that she could. What was the point of being super smart and rich if she couldn't save one of the most important people in her life? Yes, she made sure that Peggy was well taken care of—which Peggy's kids and grandkids were extremely grateful for-, but it still felt like she was letting the amazing woman down.
"I. Never. Dated. The Captain. And. His Sidekick," he says slowly as if she's stupid. He knows she'll beat him, but he doesn't care. He isn't in the mood to play. He isn't in the mood for company. He isn't in the mood to keep up a happy face.
After fixing the clock, Pepper turned back to the door. "Come eat, and I'll come get you if you don't come up. I mean it, Toni. Don't test me," she said with a smile.
look at that arm, once she subdued him.
"No, but that's a warning sign." He walked to the door, leaving the photos on the tables. "We'll talk later," he said with a smile as he walked out of the room.
Even now, that still surprised her. Who would've thought the Hulk would like anyone, especially her? "Well, look at me," she said, gesturing to her body in her oversize sweatshirt.
"How long can she survive without the reactor?"
Toni opened her eyes and looked up to him. Their eyes met, and he could see that this was anything but an insult. "I insulted you and was cruel beyond belief to you. In fact, I made it my goal to anger you, to frustrate you, just to see your temper. I want to bring you down to my level, but nothing. Sure, we yelled, and our fights are epic. Just ask everyone, but you never take it personal, always being the bigger person."
"A few hours or so. It shouldn't be much longer."
Toni turned back, looking at the shields. Though she wasn't a fan of the shield, she knew it had its pros; however, she knew Rogers wouldn't pick any of those ugly shields. They were all too fancy for him.
Steve didn't say anything as he watched Fury disappear through a door that he couldn't follow him through. He just stared at the glass doors, wondering why Fury left. What did that man want to show him? He wasn't even sure that he trusted this man. Why would he? This man showed up and told him nothing. There was no proof that he could trust him, besides the fact that he was a part of SHIELD which evolved from the SSR.
"You see what?" she asked as she stepped away. She needed to calm herself.
Jones pushed down against the couch as he struggled to stand up. He glanced toward his silent grandson, who was watching the room silently. "Steve, stop." He called as the Super Soldier headed toward the door.
"I won't," she responded, fighting the urge to pull him closer. "I won't. I mean it." She had never seen him like this. Even before the serum, she didn't think he had this in him; she didn't think he was capable of breaking down like this. It broken her to hear him like this.
Peggy reached into her pocket and pulled out a bag, which held Toni's communication device. "This device is no longer in working order. Though it doesn't look like it, Stark said the core and the battery were cooked by some kind of wave." She looked it at before offering it to him, but he didn't reach for it.
"But I do-"
"Toni," Steve said, giving her a look, but he had done nothing to discourage her.
"Not so fast, Buddy," Iron Man bellowed, landing hard in front of the man. The ground cracked under the weight of the suit. "Why don't you tell me who you are?"
It hit her.
"So how are Steve and Bucky doing up there? Cuddling fine without me, FRIDAY?" he asks, not really wanting to know the answer. They probably don't notice he isn't there. They probably don't care.
She knew what he was feeling. "Is there a point where you're going to give up?" she asked. She knew he had already tried to enlist a few times, but each time, he was turned down. "The odds are against you."
He took a deep breath. "Toni." He paused. "I followed you as this isn't safe."
That wasn't what Steve wanted to hear, but he would be stupid to disagree. "What are you inferring?" he asked. "That's she knocks herself out with pills?" His voice was anything but kind.
The AI responded seconds later. "Scan complete, Miss. Besides a common brown mouse and five chipmunks, I detect no other life signs."
"She lives," Schmidt stated as he pushed himself off the wall. "I was worried."
haha, what do you think?
I have no words. I have been working on this chapter for months... Yes, Say it with me. Months. I have spent countless nights on this one chapter. So it goes without saying that I'm not completely happy with this chapter. However, I wanted to get this chapter out- had tried to get this out a few days but system issues.
Howard smiled as he pulled her into his arms. "I got you, Baby girl. I got you." He rubbed circles into her back. They remained like that for a few long minutes. He whispered sweet words into her ears, as she buried herself into his chest. "You'll never to fear losing me again. I am right here."
"Hey, Hey," he said, softly. "That wasn't him. He would never say those things. Never. Even with someone he hated, he would never."
I used some of the lines from movie (I think you can pick out those lines :p.
Steve didn't answer right away, taking a few seconds. "Just hurry."
"I don't like being handed things." Toni narrowed her eyes at Phillips, who only stared back. "That's what I have an assistant for." However, after a few long minutes of just staring at each other, she sighed and reluctantly took the box from his grasp. "If you're proposing to me, what took you so long?" she asked, as she stared at the box. "You know what they say."
Plus, it was quiet with the moving trees as the only sound echoing through the valley… Well, plus her heavy panting. However, if it wasn't for the water bottle, she would've thought she had imagined the odd, heavily clothed man… Imagined it, which she had seemed to be doing a lot lately and people had started to notice. Started to notice her strange behavior… Noticed her exhaustion. Noticed she wasn't herself.
*O*O*
Steve stepped closer to Toni and put a protective arm around her. "We can do this later," he said, in his Captain's voice. It was a voice that very few disobeyed. Toni leaned into his touch, and Steve couldn't help but smile at that. However, it did nothing but drove his protectiveness. He knew Toni could handle herself, but he couldn't help it.
"Stark," he started, taking a deep breath. "I know what today is." Nope, it was about her father.
"There was a man, making a lot of noise, and he wouldn't stop, so your boyfriend asked him to step outside."
"I had enough rest," Steve countered.
Bucky didn't speak right away as he thought about what he was going to say. "I've been worried about you for a while now, because you haven't been thinking. Also, you never brought a woman home before," he said as he took a seat on the bed. "Plus, why would she come home with you?"
Toni closed her eyes are she tried to think. If she remembered correctly, this was when the howling commanders were formed, and that was an interesting group so she heard.
Erskine picked up the pill bottle and put the cap back on. "Against popular belief, I do not hold the same ideals of Colonel Phillips." He stood up and picked up the clip board. "I don't believe you're a spy." He walked toward the door and stared back at her before leaving.
She did a chuckling sigh. "I would love to see you fall on your ass." She took great joy whenever he failed or fell on his face. It meant he wasn't perfect.
The man stared at Toni for a few more second before he turned and walked. Just walked away without saying a fucken word. She knew he must've heard her. She knew it. "Wait!" Toni yelled, as she walked after him. He turned slightly, giving Toni another look, before he took off. Toni's heart thudded rapidly at the slight of this man running from her. Why was he running from her? Was this a trap? Why not stay and explain who he was? She couldn't understand, but she couldn't allow him to leave without her seeing his face. She
"All men are assholes," she muttered as she took a seat behind the front desk. When she got the cast off, Nick had agreed to let her do more tasks, but for now, he had her seated behind the counter to ring people out. It made her the first person people see when they walked by, which annoyed the hell out of her. Since they were located a couple of blocks down from a few bars, a lot of drunken man walked by, and nine out of ten times, they would come in just to bug her. She didn't know what it was or what gave them the idea that it was okay to sexually harass her, but it really needed to stop. It was making her go crazy, and if she didn't need this job, she would pick up the hammer that she had just put back and bang their faces in with it.
Steve popped straight up, soak in sweat. He had that same nightmare many times before and it always felt real to him, but he wasn't sure if it was. There were so many past memories in his mind and it was hard to tell which was real or which was not. He hoped to hell that that memory wasn't real, because if something were to happen to her, he would die. "Maybe, Banner's right," he muttered to himself as he sat up on the couch, which he didn't remember falling asleep on. He had to give it to Toni, as she knew how to pick the most comfortable couches to sleep on. He hadn't been able to really sleep since Toni had disappeared, and he wasn't the only one.
"What happened?" Rogers asked, shock presented on his face. He took a few steps toward her, but stopped when he noticed the pain look on her face.
"Can't wait," Bucky says, stepping away from Steve and shifting Tony's weight completely to him. He's now holding him bridal style as he stares at him with a goofy smile. "Let's just get you to bed."
Toni felt her mind start to go a little as the meds started to take over. "A hideous uniform."
Steve turned to her. "What do you mean you have nothing to lose?"
She turned her head ever so slowly to him. "Yes?" she said with a sigh.
"…Again, your lack of a record is odd, and I went to Phillips many times, but he never gave me anything and told me I was reading too much into this," he said. "I thought you were fooling us, pulling the wool over our eyes, but as I got to know you, I knew that wasn't the case. Sure you're annoying and immature at times, but you're honest and caring."
She was in haze, barely paying attention to the world: however, there wasn't much going on. She was just guided into a quinjet and back to Stark Tower with any fight. She didn't say anything as she forced onto a sofa and a heavy blanket was thrown on her, almost covering her whole. She knew Steve and Bruce—when did Bruce get here?- were saying something to her, but all she saw were their mouth moving. Were they speaking another language? She could even hear JARVIS in the background. It was mumbled, and it took everything she had to pay attention to the AI. After a few long minutes of staining, she could hear JARVIS ask if she needed something—not that she could answer.
Trying not to look at him, she stared at the sidewalk in front of her. The bag was starting to get heavy and it made it awkward to walk. "It's coming back slowly." She was annoyed at herself for that lie. It was stupid and it was hard to believe anyone fell for it. Out of the corner of her eyes, she eyed him. "It's…weird."
"Rumlow's correct. Easy," Alexander Pierce stated, as he stepped into the room. When he had entered, the entire room had turned to him giving him their full attention. There was no doubt that he was the boss just by his stance; however, he was also put together from head to toes, wearing an expensive suit that cost more than all of their salary combined. "And we need Stark."
"My nickname for the Colonel," she stated.
Everything started to spin as she felt sick. Toni knew that Peggy didn't hate or blame her for what happen to Steve, but Toni still did, and to hear her say that, it was too much. "Peg, you don't have to," She said slowly.
Toni couldn't keep the laugher down, because Peggy was her babysitter for much of her early life.
Toni jumped, not hearing that someone had entered the room. She looked up to see Agent Carter walk toward the table and sat something down. She didn't say anything as she reached over Toni and unlocked the handcuffs. "Do you want medical attention for that?" Peggy asked as handcuff fell from Toni's bleedy wrist.
Danger in the playground
"You don't need to know. Just get ready."
she thought to herself. "You have more to lose if Stark goes out," she stated as her eyes flicked to her father, who was sitting away from the table. "If I die, no big deal," she stated, regretting it a few seconds later.
"It is an elite team of SHIELD agents," Steve answered, staring at Toni. He was trying to read her. "Whenever Fury sends Natasha, Clint and I out, Rumlow and his team are also sent."
"Captain Rogers." Sharon greed as she walked toward him. It was a simple greeting, mostly due to the fact she knew how mad he was for that bullshit. His captain face could be seen a mile away.
"I figured Salty wouldn't want it visible."
Her eye started twitching as he winked at her. "You're ridiculous, you know that?" she snapped as she stood. "Why in hell would anyone want to be with you?" She unlocked the suitcase and slid her device out.
Rollins glanced at her, ready to lash out again; but he never got the chance. With adrenal rushing though her, she lunged forward and took hold of the steering wheel, and using everything that she had, she jerked it toward her. Rollins tried to push her off, but Toni was on a mission. Not willing to give him the upper hand, she headed butted him—though that probably hurt her more than him, but it worked. It stung him enough for her to get the upper hand. Her jaw locking, she tightened her grip and yanked one more time with everything that she had. Her arms may be screaming as Rollin tried to get her off, which included a few good hits, but she wasn't giving up.
Not caring about the scene that she was causing, she bolted from Rhodes and passed the many Stark Employees, each giving her a look. She didn't care about the whispers or the stares, as she just needed to get out of there. Everything felt so small, so compact, and she needed air. She needed space to breathe, as she was about to have a full blown panic—no, not panic attack. She
Toni couldn't lie to Rhodey, not that he would believe her in the first place. "Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?" she replied with a weak smile. It wasn't like she didn't want to sleep; she just couldn't. Every time she closed her eyes, she saw nothing but blood and destruction.
Toni tried to pull away but she couldn't break his grip. "I'm not from this time. I'm from the future. The year I'm from is 2013." She looked him in the eye, trying to show him that she wasn't lying.
"Steve," Natasha uttered. Her voice softer than he had ever heard. "We will find her. We will not rest until we do. I can promise you that."
Toni pulled away from her father and glared. "I can't rest. I
"If it was unsafe, you would have not been let in, Captain," the AI stated.
"I want that ankle looked at," he said, eyeing his uniform. There was a twitch in his hand, as it looked like he was trying to decide something.
Toni eyed the man's hand before she took it. She could feel her shoulder throb as he pulled her up without any warning. "Thanks," she muttered, flinching. Unlike before, there was very little chance that she could defend herself- not with her bad ankle, but she could feel her body relax slightly, noticing her Iron Man Suit heading toward her.
Taking a seat at the same table from earlier, he opened the file and dropped it immediately. The woman in the photo was Toni,
not your favorite person."
"Running away from your problems, Stark? Seemed like you."
Even after repeating it, she couldn't bring herself to believe it. It sounded just like him, down to his Brooklyn accent. Why did it have to be his voice? Why couldn't it have been anyone's else? She had failed quite a few people in her life, like her father who she couldn't save (Damn letter!), but she didn't regret anyone more than Barnes. With a hard, deep lungful, she tried to slow her rapidly firing heart. Why was this worst here? Why was his voice so strong? It was pounding in her heart, threating to rip her apart.
The name snapped his focus back to the woman in front him, and he found herself staring at her with large eyes. She was still shaking, but her fear was replaced hope and…desperation. She was inching forward, trying to get a look at his face for some reason. As no long one had ever had so much interest in him, he wasn't sure what she was looking at or what she wanted, but she was staring at him with such an intent look. It was different than how his handlers looked at him; it was nicer, and he liked it. He could stare into her eyes for hours.
morning as he was annoyed with her. Rogers didn't know what had happened, but he wasn't going to get involved. "Toni," he uttered as he looked up into her eyes.
It started to make sense to Toni. A military man. She should've guessed that, because he reminded her of Rhodes, though Jim was one of a kind. He was her rock. "I told him it was a boring name. He didn't listen. Shame on him."
"You did make it clear that you wanted your device back," Phillips replied. "And I had you followed. Did you really think we wouldn't?" He looked down at the papers in front of him. "So tell me what this device does?" he asked as he stared down at a picture of it.
Toni felt a tremor run through her as she leaned back against the gravestone. How could three little words affect her so much? Why did he have to say
The young man blushed as Toni's attention was fully on him. "T-thanks."
Steve's face lit up as he looked at her. "Toni," he greeted, putting down the pan. He didn't spare it another glance, as he crossed to his girlfriend, who was the most attractive woman he had ever seen. With the speed and agility of a super soldier, he pinned her to the wall and placed a dominating kiss to her lips. It was hungry and demanding.
Waving him off, Toni let out a sigh. "Okay."
"You fainted from sheer exhaustion," he replied. "Are you sure you don't need anything?"
"Yes, they are." Came a respond from the door, startling the two. Both Clint and Toni quickly turned to the doorway to see had joined them. "Steve's not backing down, so I came to check on you," answered Bruce, who looked just as tired as they did.
Steve and Schmidt walked toward each other on the long bridge. "I'm a great fan of your films." He paused as he looked him over. "So Dr. Erskine managed it after all. Not exactly an improvement, but still impressive."
to make sure she never felt pain. Do
"Not anymore," he stated. His voice was strained.
"You don't see an issue?" Rumlow questioned, as his eyes glanced to the techs readying the chair.
Toni felt her eye twitch as Trip mentioned her mother. Why did everyone always mention her mother in regards to her manners? "JARVIS, mommy's home."
Natasha stood up. "Not all." She did not want to be included in that.
this did ended- and it will-, it could or would divide the team, and she couldn't let that happen. Couldn't. "I have no doubt in that," she said. "And she'll hide my body where no one will find it."
Both the Soldier and Toni were surprised, but that didn't stop him as the soldier shoved her out of the way. She landed on her ass had, but that wasn't going to stop her. Getting back on her feet, she went to tackle him but she was grabbed from behind. "Not so fast," she yelled as she threw her head back, nailing the other soldier in the face. Ignoring her daze, she picked up her right leg, and as hard as she could, she kicked him in the shin. He dropped her, and before he could get his baring, she spun and kicked him in gut, sending him to the ground.
"Toni."
The genus paused for a second, pandering the question. There was a bit of embarrassment growing up inside of her. She wasn't embarrassed of her relationship—never!-, but at times, she felt like a wide open book for the world to see. She didn't like that, though her public facade glistened in it, but there were a few things she wanted to keep to herself. It was certain parts of her relationship that she wanted to keep to herself. It was-
*O*O*
Her mind started to go to the dark side. Someone should've come to her; JARVIS should've alerted the Avengers that one of their own was down, but they weren't there. Why did everyone abandon her?
"I don't see anything," he said in annoyance.
*O*O*
"That's strange," she uttered as she took a long look around. She had seen the stalker come down the alley and there was no way out, so he had to be here. Sure it was dark, but it wasn't that dark, and she should've seen him leave if he did leave. "How could I have lost him in the first place?" she asked. This stalker was supposed to be sucky. He was better than what she gave him credit for, and that worried her.
"I'm fine!" she yelled back, finally realizing how to rotate the bra. After a few minutes of struggling, she was able to get it on properly. "There, we go." She smiled as she looked in the mirror. "See, I look much better."
However, Toni could tell it was more than just playing hurt, which struck her, and for a few minutes, Toni's nerves left as she took in her father's guilt. She wasn't sure what he was feeling, but she had no doubt he was thinking of his short coming. It was no secret that they had a bad relationship, which she had made clear with her actions. She even admitted to him that she had lost her father to his company. Now, he knew that she lost him to the company.
"Why do you push people away?" he asked softly. His back was against the wall and there was nowhere to go as Toni had him pinned. His hand grazed her arm as he was unsure of what to do with it.
After stopping at a store to pick up a few items for genius (Something that Steve took great joy in paying for), the couple found themselves at a small out of the way diner. Steve hadn't said much after leaving the apartment. Try as she might, Toni could only get a few words out of her boyfriend, who had been silence even with her jests. "Steve," she said, as they sat down at a table in the corner. "Talk to me."
However, this woman brought something out inside of him, and it would be foolish not to figure out why that was. In order to follow his programing, he had to learn why, so he could be an effective tool. He needed to be an effective tool again. He didn't want the chair, and he was willing to do whatever it took to escape the chair, the pain. However, he wasn't sure there was anything he could do about the woman as the very thought of her hurt made him ill. Though he had no of why, he knew what she was: his
"I got work to do, so if you can leave, that would be nice," he says, turning from the Captain and sitting back down. "And take that plate back up. I'm not hungry." He nods this head toward a plate a few feet from him. The plate's no longer warm as Tony had pushed it away, refusing to eat it. He doesn't need Barnes to take care of him.
Peggy crossed to the door and looked out. She didn't see him in the hallway. "He must've gone back to the medical bay for something." She stepped away from the door and toward the Colonel. "How long are you going to keep her in there?" she asked, knowing how long she had been in the room.
"I see."
"Geez, Rogers, just kiss me already. I'm dying over here." She was beaming now as she spoke. "This is what I get for falling for an old man."
She took a step into the alley and froze. Her nightmare returned, almost forcing her to her knees, as she could only see a hand around her neck, choking her. It was getting hard to breathe and she thought she was going to faint. "It's just an alley," she told herself as she tried to relax herself. She focused on the voices and not the images in her mind. "Just listen."
With a shake of his head, the Captain leaned back in his chair as he wondered why he was here. Sure, he was useful, but surely they didn't need him with the fake god around.
He had never felt so helpless in his life, and he hated it.
"Toni," Rogers called, banging on the door again. Judging from his voice, he was out of breath and was sitting as well.
"What are you talking about?" Toni asked.
Again, she knew her singing sucked, but no one else was allowed to say. "I tried," Toni teased, as she studied him. Though she was unsure of the time-lapse since she last saw Salty, he looked older. "Did something happen, Salty?"
"Yea, I bet he wasn't happy to hear that," he chuckled as he kneed down next to her. He grabbed her face and turned softly to look at the bruise that took up half of her face. "Doesn't look pretty. Maybe you should go see a doctor."
"What do you mean? What rabbit?" Toni pushed herself up and glared at him, but he didn't say anything. "What do you want?" she asked, her voice cracking. Her throat was dry, aching with every word that she was saying.
Barnes took a deep breath. "You frustrate me sometimes."
With Steve's proposal in her head, she wasn't sure if that was true anymore. No, she knew that she didn't feel the same about marriage, but that didn't mean she knew how to answer him, or what she wanted. And, she hated that. She hated that she felt like a Lifetime movie. Hated the look on his face when he realized she wasn't going to say yes. She had never wanted to pouch herself more in her life than right there. She wanted to say yes just to get
"Why don't you walk away with your tail between your legs before you get hurt?" She said, glaring. With the dropping temperature and a raw shoulder, she now wanted to go back to the tower.
Sounding nothing like JARVIS, Zola uttered, "Accessing archive." His face disappeared on the computer screen, showing old footage of the Red Skull. It was sickening, videos playing in front of them like a home movie. "HYDRA was founded on the belief that humanity could not be trusted with its own freedom. What we did not realize, was that if you try to take that freedom, they resist. The war taught us much. Humanity needed to surrender its freedom willingly."
"I don't see Stark doing that," Rumlow replied, looking back to Pierce and the Asset.
"I wouldn't say rundown," she replied. It had a homely feeling that she wished she had at her place. She took her deep breath as she continued her walk.
Shaking her head in annoyance, she spotted him a few yards away. "Steve," she yelled.
"Why would you be doing that?" Rogers asked. "Is something going on?"
"Was?" he asked, eyeing her.
Yes, she knew it was okay to feel emotional, especially after losing Bucky, but she didn't want to feel these emotions. If Bucky ever came back to life, she was going to kill him again, because no one should ever be able to make her feel this way. NO ONE.
Bucky gives Steve a look before the two Super Soldiers chase after Tony. They aren't going to let the brunette escape from them again, and unlike last time, they aren't going to give up. For the first time, Tony realizes this and he's smiling as he's being chased through the tower. He probably looks like an idiot to everyone around them, but he doesn't care. He's happy for once, and he can't wait for what comes now.
"Then why are you out here without a coat?" he asked, softly. There was worry in his voice, which shocked her, as she was a complete stranger to him in this time. "It's very cold out here."
That was a loaded question if she had ever heard of one. Plus, there was the fact that she was seeing things. Barnes alone scared the crap out of her.
With a deep sigh, Toni leaned back in the CEO chair as she had signed something for the nth time. She had lost track of how many forms she had signed, which was plain exhausting in and of itself. Yes, she had been CEO of this very company before, and it had done it successfully for years, but this was exhausting. Even if it was just because she thought she was going die at the time, the genius was glad that she had put Pepper in charge of the company. Stepping back had been great for the genius, and there was no doubt that she would've gone crazy— well more so, if she had to do this job for any longer. She just wanted to build and invent things, not run a whole company.
because she refused to do anything. Her fault as she let it happen.
"I wouldn't say it was without cause," he stated as he opened the folder and revealed photos of her device, which was taken apart. There were wires connected to the device, trying to power it up.
The door to the room opened to reveal a tired Bruce, who had a weird expression on his face. "Banner," Steve greeted. "Find something?"
It wasn't like Steve didn't know that, as Rollin took her when Fury died, but to hear it? God, it felt like someone stabbed him, especially when they had no idea where they took her. "Clint," he uttered.
"I want to talk," she stated, ignoring the looks from the other officers in the hallway. She felt herself falter again, but this time, she was unable to stop herself and she fell forward. She put her arms out, ready to brace herself, but she found herself in a pair of arms. Toni glanced up at her savior and smiled as innocently as she could. "My hero."
"You were captured too," she stated as they walked in the direction of Rogers.
"Then what?" He gazed over her face, stopping at the bruise. It was such an eye catching injury. "I don't have time to play games. Why did you leave?"
Natasha makes a face as she moves toward the empty spot on the sofa next to Tony. "What about a movie without aliens who want to enslave the planet? I had my fill of aliens in my life time," she says, honestly as she eyes the empty spot. There's a smile on her face as she inches over to it.
"And you think that's a good idea?" she asked. There was no anger in her voice, but he knew she was pissed that he was trying to get help from Loki, who had almost destroyed New York.
Like always, she smiled and greeted him back. "Hello, neighbor."
She reached for the file in her back pocket and threw it on the table in front of him. "There you go. I'm done with it," she said. "And you were correct… but don't let it go to your head." Howard didn't make any movement toward the folded, bent up file.
Phillips looked at her. "I want to know why you were in that field and how these devices works." He placed two photos in front of her. One was of her unnamed device and the other was her reactor, which made her glance down at her chest. It wasn't visible through the black shirt she was wearing. "And I want to know who you are." He eyed her. "I don't believe Sark is your name."
"Why don't you stay here? The team could use you here," he said, as he glanced out the door.
"You sound mad."
she thought as she noticed two empty corridors. She turned around and took off in that direction, knowing that she had to hurry while she kept an eye on the feed to make sure she stayed out of view of the cameras.
," he says, scooting as fast as he can. He can't be this close to them, because he can't think straight with them close.
Phillips turned back to her, and Toni could see the shock in his face. He wasn't expecting that. "Was that how you got that thing in your chest?" he asked, poking to her chest.
At sound of Rogers' name, Toni's heart started to race, and she had to take a few deep breaths to slow it down. She knew JARVIS would detect the change in her heart beat and alert Bruce like the traitor the AI was if she did not slow it down. She didn't need that, and she especially didn't want him to know it was because he said a certain Super Soldier's name. "Just tags," Toni replied, calmly.
Just as Toni was about to disconnect the motherboard from the device, it somehow sent a shockwave through her arm without even being connected to a power source. "FUCK," she screamed as she dropped what she was holding. She cradled her right hand close to her chest as she rocked. She couldn't feel her arm, which didn't scare her too much. Her frustration of being bested by her own damn device was overshadowing the shocking pain. Why couldn't she fix it?
Toni's head snapped up and to the left, eyeing the man at the door. "Cap," she called, noticing the Super Soldier at the door. He was leaning against the glass door frame, as he eyed the scene in front of him. There was an interesting, hard look in his eyes, but Toni didn't care. She was just happy that he was there. Without her realizing, there was a smile on her face as she looked at Steve. For some reason, he could always brighten her day. It was like he was her
"Well, I'm not the type of girl who need a gentleman," she answered, mad at herself. She didn't want to be the type of girl who needed to be rescued. She wanted to be the knight in her own story.
Natasha stood back. "I remember Stark telling me about this. She told me that if the lab closed itself off like this, it wouldn't be good." She took a deep breath. "She said, while laughing, she would most likely be dead or worse." There was a grim expression on her face.
He let out a snort. "You're just as bad as Bucky."
"I don't think it'll be on purpose, Rogers," Rhodes said. "You and Toni are like oil and water. Like cats and dogs. You're going to fight. Going to yell, and whatever this is shouldn't work, but-"
Hearing someone walk in, he turned to the door and gave a weak smile to Banner. "How's it going, Banner?" Steve asked, turning and resting his arm on the back of the couch.
"So are they still fighting upstairs?" she asked, changing the subject. Her tone changed slightly.
He couldn't understand why she would do such a careless thing. Was she trying to get herself blown up? He could say she was suicidal, but she didn't seem like the type: her ego too big. He could say that this was strategic, but he knew this woman. He knew this woman didn't understand the word strategic, couldn't understand the word. She acted without a second thought, and she acted with no hesitation. After studying her for weeks and watching past videos, the Asset knew she didn't plan and just acted. Her plan was to attack, no matter how stupid it was, even if her actions were suicidal. It annoyed the Asset to no end, and he wanted to…to do things to make her listen.
"Enough," Howard interrupted with an annoyed look on his face. "Let's get back to the task at hand." He took a deep breath. "Carbon polymer. Should withstand your average German bayonet. Although, Hydra's not going to attack you with a pocket knife."
"You don't like music?" Rogers asked.
*O*O*
And just like that, the wind started to pick up and the device started to spark. Toni knew there was no stopping this now, and she needed to brace herself for impact, but as she watched her father, she stared at his smile, knowing she couldn't do this, not again. She couldn't allow another person to die as she did nothing. She didn't care about the future, which she thought was damned to begin with. Maybe, the world would be better with her father alive. "Damn, it all," she yelled, though she wasn't sure if anyone could hear her over the device.
That wasn't what Toni wanted to hear, and it only scared her more. What if this didn't work out? What if she screwed this up? …Wait, who the hell was she kidding? She would mess it up. It was her after all. "Am I getting the shovel talk?" she asked. As she was a screw up and didn't do commitment, she never got the talk before. No one was stupid enough before Rogers to try a relationship to her. Serious, was Rogers stupid? "If so, you better make it good!"
Pepper stepped to Steve, who was looking everywhere else but her. "What did you say?"
"Good, you're learning. Good Boy."
Surprised, Pepper spun around quickly, stepping back to Toni. "Toni," she called, as the tension died in her shoulders. In a few long steps, Pepper pulled Toni into her arms and hugged her tight. "I love you, and even if I can't be there next to you, I will always love you. Always."
*O*O*
Toni didn't care what meeting she had interrupted when she burst into his Salty's tent. She didn't care about the nasty looks and comments she received from the officers when they exited the tent. She didn't care that the Colonel looked pissed. She didn't care about anything besides getting into that Hydra Base. She knew she wouldn't get the Tesseract itself, but that cube was used to create Hydra weapons. Maybe, if she get her hands on those power cores in the weapons, she might be able to power her device.
- looked up, and their eyes met. He could see the color drain from his face as fear took over. He faltered a bit as Toni stepped away. The Asset was met with conflict as he wanted to go after her, but at the same time, he wanted to show this individual that touching what was his was unacceptable. This was the only thing he wanted, and he wanted to protect her. And like Hydra had done to him, he had to teach his man a lesson. He had to teach him what happened to those, who disobeyed.
"You sleep?" Came Bruce's reply.
Taking a few deep slips, she leaned back in her chair and stared out the window. Pepper's office had a nice view, and Toni could see for miles. She could also see her car from this view. Not wanting her new Driver or Happy to see her so drained, she had been driving herself to work for the last week or so. Though if she was this exhausted, she shouldn't drive herself to work. Well, she could always test fly the Mark 42 into work tomorrow if she could get it to fly.
Seeing this, Salty jumped and reached for Toni, trying to stop her. "Stop, Toni," he ordered.
Toni almost tripped over feet, hearing a familiar cruel voice. "Oh, god no," she uttered, her voice breaking. When she was already feeling like crap, she didn't—couldn't deal with James Barnes right now. She couldn't take his angry words. not when all she wanted to do was give up.
*O*O*
She didn't think that would work. She took her head as she exhaled slowly. "Mistake of the tongue. Not sure what I meant," she smiled. She tried to hide it with a laugh
Barnes took a step forward, which Toni didn't like it. "I've seen you sneak out countless times into these woods, Toni. You know how dangerous that is? I wanted to make sure you were okay."
Tony laughs. "Why don't you go bug Barnes if he's such a good cook. He'll probably do it if you keep giving him that face."
Bucky turns to him ever so slowly with a scowl. "No, the Punk belongs here with us," he snaps. "He belongs right in this spot! Not with him!" he yells, waving at Rhodes.
"I try." Phillips shook his head, but he didn't say thing. "So where's Rogers?" She didn't remember much before passing out in his arms as she cried. It had been the first time that she had completely fell apart in front of him both in the future and past, though he had seen a few tears from her before. But it had been completely different now. She had broken down in his arms and she found it hard to believe that he would leave.
Toni glared, not liking the look that he was giving her. Why in the hell was he looking at her like that?
"...the device…she…awakes."
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know Howard Stark, and he doesn't care easily. I can count on one hand the number of people Howard genuinely cares about," Peggy said.
"So the Iron Patriot…?" Toni asked, teasing Rhodey. She was really shocked to see Jim, but it was a nice surprise, even if the meeting was in the office and not in some bar getting hammered. Even if she promised herself not to break her promise to her father, she couldn't help the desire to drink.
He looked at her funny. "Accompany them where?" he asked as he picked up a file.
Toni's heart started to race. "I think I know my last name," she replied, trying to hide her tremor.
"…But…" She started, closing her eyes. A few second passed by before she took a few deep breaths and continued. "…After everything that I had said and done, you're still here. Still willing to be here for me, and I don't know why. Why would you come back after everything? Why?"
If Toni wasn't in so much pain, she would laugh, because no fucker would believe that load of crap. That was 101 in the rule book: never believe the villain, especially when they say they wouldn't kill you. They would always kill you in the end. "I would say bit me, but you might do it," she said, trying to ignore the sweat running own her face.
The smile disappeared on Maya's face as she got to her feet and strengthened her clothes. With decisiveness, she stepped away from the worn laptop and toward a small set of steps, leading to a lower level.
"I'll save her," Steve stated.
He had no idea why she kept calling him Salty but it was pissing him off. That wasn't his name and she should respect him enough to call him by his name, considering it was up to him if she would be freed. "She has a mouth on her," he stated, annoyed.
"Yes, I am, Eye Patch," Toni replied, giving him a look.
Wilson laughs as he pokes the chicken. "This is too frozen to cook. C'mon man, buy us some food."
"Relax, Sark," Peggy stated, realizing something must've set her off. She reached a hand out to steady her, but Toni shoved it away. "Come on." Her voice rose. "You need to sit back down. Don't be so hard headed."
The Genius hated that he kept asking that. "Peachy," she replied. "Just check this over so I can take a hot, long shower. I so need a hot shower. I don't remember the last time that I had one." It was true. She didn't recall when the last time she had a shower.
"Miss," JARVIS started, "It would be unwise to-"
"I'm not babying you," he said as she put her weight against him. "Just worried." He held her close to keep her on her feet. "You had us all worried." He glanced at her, focusing on her discolored face.
Sharon gave her a hard look, but she slid herself back, giving Toni some space. "Rogers won't be back until morning. Do you want to…" She paused for a second as if she struggled to get the words come. "Watch a Star Trek marathon with me. There's one on TV right now."
She closed her eyes and melted into him, refusing to go. She focused on his heart beat, counting each beat that she could hear. He was the only thing in her world at the moment. The only thing. She had no idea what she would do without him.
"Why do you have to be so hard headed?" Barnes asked.
"Toni," Steve called, interrupting her thoughts, as he spun her his arms. "You're thinking too loud." He gently place his hands on her cheeks and held her still. "Listen to me, Toni. I have no interest in being anywhere else but here. So for once on your life, stop using that big brain of yours and kiss me."
There's a reason why he's okay with the Avengers believing that. For one, he's too damn old for this shit, and he has no interest in them knowing the truth. Besides, if they do, it will only cause trouble and drama, and
"I kind of put that together." He said, waving at the two. "Must've freaked you out coming home after the whole defrosting thing," he replied, taking his hand.
Toni's eyes switched again, which was quite painful as her left side of her face was sore and any movement hurt. Her face was turning into a deep shade of purple and black. "Figures," she stated, glancing at Peggy. Right now, that Agent was pissing her off. Sure, they didn't get along to begin with, but lately, she was pissing her off just to piss her off. If Rogers was Mr. Perfect, Peggy was Mrs. Perfect and she couldn't take that.
"What?" The Private stated. "She's either one of those or promiscuous slut."
He looked into her eyes. "I am still in Asgard with Thor." He said it with such a distaste that she thought the room would catch fire.
How did he know this woman's expression so well? How did he know what her tells were? How did he know what the tilt of her head meant? How did he know what the blank stare of her eyes meant? The Asset didn't know, but he counted it toward the amount of time that he had been watching her. It wasn't abnormal for the watcher to get know his target after a few weeks, and he would say that was the case here. However, this feeling was different than what he normally felt from watching his other marks; this time went deeper somehow. It was more than the familiarity of just observing a target. It was different; it felt personal. It felt like he knew her, but how?
With a deep sigh, Bruce closed his eyes and rubbed his forehead. "That doesn't make sense," he replied.
"That is correct. And if needed, it can be done again."
"No, you don't."
Toni laughed as Steve turned bright red. "Unfortunately, Stevie and I are fully dressed," she replied, tugging at Steve's cotton blue shirt. "But we can fix that."
Bucky just laughed. It was chilling, and it was a strike to her knees. "Why would he answer
Toni shook her head in a no fashion, because she hadn't gotten it pass it; however, she understood it. He was following someone that could've been a criminal. "Do you have any idea of who attacked me in the alley?" Though little by little she was getting over it, it still woke her in the middle of the night in a pool of sweat. She was beginning to believe that Peggy was noticing.
He stared at her confused. "Why would you go to a shelter?"
Steve let out a laugh. "I already call him that. You can't steal my nickname for him."
Toni exhaled harshly as she glared at him. "I'm not being emotional," she said through clenched teeth, though knowing that she was. However, she knew this was for the best, even if her emotions were running wild. She didn't belong here.
Toni stepped to the right of the Super Soldier, glancing around the room. Dugan, Jones, and Trip were sitting on one of sofa, and not too far from them was Bruce. They were deep in conversion about something, but their voices were too soft to make out. Every once and awhile, they would glance over to the bar, eyeing the group there. In the corner by the bar, Romanoff had separated Rhodes and Barton by stepping in between them. She was giving each a deadly look that only a fool would cross.
Then there was Bruce, a close friend. Did he just let Toni leave to? Did anyone try to stop her? Pepper wasn't sure why she left and no one stopped her, but she was going to get some answers. She needed answers.
"But I do," the Agent responded with a weak smile. "I will make it up and be there through it all." Before Toni could respond, Peggy pulled her into a hug. "Just imagine all of our girl nights together."
If Toni learned it was Hydra, he was scared he might lose her for good. "No, not possible."
A slight pink shade formed on his cheeks. "Maybe," he said, slowly. "But it's true."
Steve let out a sigh. "You don't trust anyone."
Howard glanced at the now opened box and focused on the metal tags inside. "Dog tags," he said, staring at the engraving in the metal. He was unable to read the names, but he didn't need to read the tags to know who they belonged to. "Rogers and Barnes?"
Frustration filled Toni as she stared down the barrel of the gun. What was his point of him taking it? Was it just to show her how weak she was? Or was he going to take her back to Phillips and call her traitor? "Don't count me out," she said through her teeth.
"Did…I miss something?" Rhodes asked, as he stepped into the room. With a raised eyebrow, he glanced between Clint, Bruce, and Pepper, who were all glaring at each other. The tension could be cut with a knife.
“Looking good, Gamora,” Tony spoke, glancing at the girl who sat to the right of him. He wagged his eyebrows the moment she faced him. Tony only gave her an innocent stare once she rolled her eyes.
“Don’t take it lightly. I don’t usually say stuff like this to most people.” He regained his composure in typical “Tony Stark” fashion.
“You are
“A.M to P.M, I hope?” Tony joked, a modicum of relief in his voice. Well, that wouldn’t be so bad.
Steve opened his fridge, eyeing the compartments up and down. He sorted through the sparse amounts of condiments and drinks to check for any discernable leftovers. Unfortunately, there weren’t any. They must have eaten the last of it yesterday. Fuck, he should have bought takeout or something when he was coming home.
“Away from the noise,” He replied; he looked over towards the Foyer, “We can help you clean it up.”
He tried looking for any familiar faces, ones that weren’t Steve Rogers.
Tony followed Steve inside a shed. Inside of it was dimly lit, extra supplies and uniforms lying around.
“I was asking what page we were on!”
“Clint, don’t encourage him,” Natasha said.
It was a complete mess.
“Like what? Getting blackout drunk with your friends? Vacationing over the weekends? Spending all day locked up in your lab?”
There was a longer silence between the two which shockingly garnered Tony’s attention back.
Tony sat up as well while Natasha remained lying on the ground, her hand now blocking her face. Bruce was at a far corner, meticulously writing down notes from his calculus textbook. He wrinkled his nose at the foul weed stench, hoping to god he didn’t smell like it.
Steve heard an obnoxious car screeching sound. His eyes quickly darted back to the road and noticed that Natasha’s car just drove off.
The group of seven gathered around the enormous front lawn of Tony’s home.
“Lucky for you, your father was able to pull some strings,” Fury said, absolute contempt lacing his words. The privilege just oozed out of this boy, it almost enraged him.
He could hear her repeatedly call his name from the other line.
At the corner of his sight, Tony could see Darcy head out after glancing at him once more.
“He got caught streaking the Principal’s house!” A new voice said, quite loudly. Tony could hear a few stifled laughs nearby. Darcy looked on in shock, putting two and two together.
Tony had to restrain himself from rolling his eyes at the empty platitude.
Tony immediately dismissed that thought. He wasn’t going to resort to that. His desperation didn’t go that far. Either way, Fury would find something else for him to do, probably something insanely boring.
“Like I said, I know you find much more enjoyment in things other than this,” Coulson continued, “But if you come in every day with the negative outlook, expecting the worst than that’s how things going to feel.”
“Sorry,” The other plainly said, placing his hands over top of each other between his knees. His posture was slightly relaxed.
Tony slightly relaxed, lowering his shoulders.
“Peter?” Tony said, after he didn’t get a response. From the speakers of his phone, he could hear a slight scuffle. Next came a clicking noise.
“Thanks, Honey-bear,” Tony patted Rhodey on the shoulder.
“It isn’t?” Tony said. He figured it wasn’t. The fact that he was called to Fury’s office and his parents being here clued him in pretty quickly. His heartrate was noticeably quicker. He tried to keep his voice neutral, cool, whatever, “…What am I here for then?”
If it wasn’t clear by now, Steve Rogers had a low opinion of Tony. He thought the kid was obnoxious, loud, entitled, and even arrogant at times. Being the son of a businessman and scientist with a multimillion-dollar net worth clearly did him no favors in that regard. People like him thought they were gods gift to the world because they were raised to believe so. People like Tony did not care about the consequences of their troublesome antics because their parents would scoff them off and everything for them would go back to normal. Steve was
“Oh, well–”
Steve begrudgingly closed his fridge and grabbed his coat. He was going to order takeout, lots of it. He was too tired and lazy to cook something from what little they had.
“I meant giving him the complete silent treatment,” Bucky retorted.
“I guess everyone’s weekends were great,” Coulson began, “I’ve never seen you guys so talkative before.”
“Speak for yourself, Tony,” Rhodey said, earning some more laughter from the others, “I’m worried you’ll get alcohol poisoning from this.”
“Aw, you guys…saved my life,” Tony said, a giggle escaping his mouth.
Tony momentarily frowned, but quickly remembered that was probably for the detention he skipped. He could explain himself and call his father, as planned. He was good at that.
“Okay, explain the specifics from beginning to end.”
“For the rest of the year.”
head off once he got carried away.
“Guys, get your butts over here. We’re not done yet!” Darcy shouted, interrupting Tony.
“Fuuuuck,” Tony groaned, repeatedly slamming his head on his locker. He ignored the weird stares he was receiving from passersby. His anger was more important. Right now, he would have been on his way home to coop himself up in his lab, his classic rock playlist blasting on the highest volume while he created updates on the rocket-like thrusters he started on a few weeks ago. Instead, he was going to do, with very much reluctance, manual labor for free.
“So it’s about the automatic solar tracker Ned and I have been working on, last time you said I should reinstall the software connected to it, but that turned out to be a bust, so I disassembled and reassembled it like three times and there still wasn’t any change. Mr. Harrington couldn’t even answer my question and everyone else I ask seems to be completely stumped about this so…who knows better than you when it comes to this stuff.”
It was probably a huge deal for Peter to hear those words come out of Tony’s mouth. Tony felt an usually warm pang in his stomach, he didn’t throw around compliments like that cause he often became flustered from people’s reactions, however well he hid it.
“Easy for you to say,” Clint said, his laughter still apparent. He wiped the corners of his eyes with the tips of his fingers, “You’re practically one of the most disciplined people I know.”
Tomorrow was his second day of the construction project and he’d probably need as much energy as he could muster.
“I– it’s– nevermind,” Peter fumbled, getting ready to turn around and head off. Tony grabbed him by the shoulder.
Tony almost wanted to mock Steve’s words, but quickly concluded that would be incredibly childish. He eyed his whole uniform once again before speaking.
Oh, shit.
“You think she’s the type to let something like this destroy a nine-year friendship?”
“Seriously?” Steve said, the side of his lips opening up in what Tony guessed was a half-smile. That was the first time Tony saw the guy amused, at least with something involving him.
Obviously, Tony never thought about it that way. Though, his sour mood was just about dampening everything he heard or saw.
“Yeah, they had me work until 9:00 cause Gabe became sick.”
“Maybe you wouldn’t need to ask if you’d make it a habit to come on time. Plus, I’d much rather prefer if you asked me.”
After they both changed into their uniforms, one waiting for the other to finish as they did so separately, they were finally heading towards the inner part of the building.
,” His mother’s tone became noticeably worried, “
Tony kept up his running, sometimes skipping as the harsh, cool air hit him. His singing was off-key, screechy, and loud enough for the others to hear clearly from the vehicle.
Tony thought he was insane for going with this.
“Cheers,” Tony said, extending his own blunt towards Clint’s and Natasha’s whose were also extended.
Unbeknownst to Tony, Steve was staring at him, now only realizing his presence. His stare was expectantly a befuddled one, his eyebrows pressed together and lips slightly parted.
It was the reason why Tony dismissed the notion of regular public school. It didn’t stimulate his brainpower enough. The repetitive, memory-based assignments just didn’t do it for him. He’d rather divert his attention onto different things he deemed more fulfilling like his lab, his friends, and the activities that went hand-in-hand with his vivacious social life.
“This whole…situation…is just the pinnacle of your record infractions,” Fury continued, “Your parents and I had a long talk and realized that this means expulsion.”
“My neighbors aren’t the most social types,” Tony said, he stifled an irritated sigh while he stared at Clint’s doubled over position. Instead, he gave the blonde an annoyed side-eye, “I’m glad I could make some of you laugh.”
Natasha “Nat” Romanov was never one to be easily impressed. Her absolute disgust was very much evident on her face, her red lips twisted into a frown and eyebrows drawn together.
“It’s kind of funny,” Bruce shrugged. When Tony’s expression wouldn’t budge, he gave him an assuring pat on the shoulder, “At least you didn’t get expelled. Knowing Fury, I think he went really easy on you.”
Inside the building, Steve stopped close to an area where a group of four was working together. Tony proceeded to do the same, eyes darting to the group. Lucky for him, Darcy was amongst them.
Steve had shown Tony around the area, describing the general layout of the construction site, introducing Tony to some of the construction workers who aided the students, and showing the broad assortments of tools that were held in the supply closet. Much to Steve’s surprise, Tony wasn’t as flippant or even talkative. It was a stark contrast to how he was before Quentin told him off, maybe his words might gotten to him. Quentin was an asshole and Steve could barely stand him on a good day, but he was glad Tony was brought down a few notches.
“Thank you, and that’s probably the last time I’ll ask, cause I won’t miss this class anymore. Can’t afford to.”
The teacher rolled her eyes at Tony Stark’s fake, saccharine tone. She motioned for him to take a seat.
The two began to walk down the hallway, heading to the entrance that would lead them outside.
After half-heartedly taking Coulson’s words in, Tony was allowed to head back home. The first thing he did was go straight to his room, closing the door shut. He slipped off his shoes and flopped down on his bed before pressing his face against the pillow, savoring the new founded comfort. It was warm, cozy, and just what he needed. Tony was surprised at how tired he was, he barely even did much at the construction site, mainly just watching...and watching...and watching, minus a little bit of practice.
“I’ll go,” Clint shrugged. He glanced around the area thinking of something bold enough, “I dare Romanov to kiss Pepper. Right on the lips.”
“If you want to get a concussion from a falling object, then I won’t stop you.”
“Tony, can you not go one day without interrupting my class?”
Tony then reminded himself. He had to make the best of this situation. It wouldn’t be of use for him to be a constant ball of negativity. He would be doing himself a favor if he remained his normally charming, outgoing self.
“I told you it was embarrassing,” Tony replied, then continued in a louder voice, “Oh, and Becky, it’s not streaking if you do it with underwear on!”
There were a few stifled laughs among the group.
Wait, what if he “accidently” tripped over the rougher edges of the ground and got a horrible injury from that? He wouldn’t have to do this, for a while at least!
“So, what do you want me to do, soldier?” Tony spoke up, hands on his hips.
“Yeah, I know,” Tony sighed, sinking down in his seat, “It’s just…I’m not looking forward to working with Steve Rogers of all people. Four entire hours with him. I don’t think it’s possible for me to work with someone so uptight, boring, and up their own ass.”
He wiped his mouth and flushed the toilet before catching his breath and leaning against the wall. Tony walked– crawled, rather, outside of the bathroom. Before leaving his bedroom, he saw Clint, Natasha, and Bruce in the room. Clint slept on the other edge of his ginormous bed while Bruce and Natasha slept on separate sleeping bags. He must have let them sleepover with him, after everyone else had left.
Steve stifled a sigh.
Steve barely held his scoff.
It was a pain in the ass, but he knew it would be worth it all in the end if he got accepted into UC Berkeley.
“Careful, Tony. You can barely walk,” Jane said. She had consumed some of the vodka as well, but she was nowhere near as intoxicated as Tony was.
He was completely hammered.
wow this chapter was a lot longer than planned; i hope yall enjoy this one cause its a ride
When Bruce was about to open his mouth, possibly to retort, he was interrupted by Tony.
“Nick– Mr. Fury, I didn’t even–” Tony stumbled. He was completely befuddled. He had no idea principal Fury lived in his neighborhood! He knew the principal was well off, but not
There were easily over 100 people at the Stark mansion.
“Just ride it out. Before you know it, we’ll be graduating and spending the entire summer together. Just the four of us,” Natasha reassured, “And it’s not like your entire time is taken up by all of this.”
The further away his steps got, the more tense things felt. It was completely silent between the two boys, Steve remaining in his spot and unmoving. Weren’t they supposed to go out to the construction site? Tony slightly frowned, he wouldn’t let himself shrink under the blonde’s imposing stare.
“Just don’t injure yourself again on another one of your projects,” Bruce plainly said, eyeing his textbook. Tony often took his engineering escapades or projects rather seriously to a point where he nearly sliced his finger open with a heavy duty saw from not sleeping for a whole two days.
As the hours ticked by, Tony’s party became more erratic. Alongside his friends, Tony drank more and more, not taking into account of how out of control it was getting. Whatever was happening, he could deal with it eventually. He would have it under control tomorrow, if not today.
“It’s my property, Stark, so I can discipline you for that.”
He actually found it quite therapeutic to multitask, working on his own project while helping Peter. It was a much-needed challenge for his brain. Plus, he loved the solace of isolating himself in his spacious workroom after a long day at school, having time to do what he was most passionate about.
“Yeah, if he doesn’t freeze to death,” Natasha replied.
On the other hand, people like Tony Stark thought Steve’s do-gooder nature…contravened with his more nefarious behaviors. They would clash with each other with their limited interactions and Tony, being his wisecracking self,
“Just ignore him,” She said to Tony.
Tony frowned.
“No excuses this time?”
“No, no you’re not,” Steve replied in a haste fashion, wanting Bucky to quash down the topic of Tony Stark or anything having to do with Tony Stark, “I’m just trying to keep my sanity intact before we graduate.”
“Great.”
Tony’s heartbeat was practically drumming through his ears. No, he couldn’t get expelled!
“Fury told me someone new would be joining us today.”
“Pepper, I don’t know how you dated this one for nearly two years.”
“Late again, Stark?”
“Okay, so they look kind of bad, but that was because of the green food coloring. It only makes sense since it’s mint flavored.”
The voice belonged to one the guys among Darcy’s group. Tony instantly recognized him as Quentin Beck, a senior who shared a class or two with him. He was a smarmy son of a bitch. Quentin’s father had a withstanding grudge against Tony’s own father, as the former got fired by the latter for releasing confidential documents outside of the workplace years ago. For that reason, Quentin took the lasting effects of that ordeal to the grave with him and created a longstanding resentment against Tony by association.
Tony walked again at a normal speed after he was slightly ahead of Steve. He turned around, walking backwards instead to face the other.
When Steve gave him one more glance to possibly tell him to buzz off, the dark-haired boy gave him a wink before heading back to his friends.
Tony crawled over to Clint, slightly pushing him aside for a better view.
“Have a nice day, Cap,” Tony said, “If you’re looking for a date to the winter formal, hit me up!”
“Mom? Dad?” Tony said, “What are you doing here?”
“Buck–”
“Shucks, why are the hot ones are always unavailab–”
“I know, you always tell me this–”
The teacher’s aggravated voice caused Clint to quiet down. The entire class’ focus shifted to the student at the classroom entrance. He sported messy pitch-black hair, large brown eyes with prominent dark circles, and a wardrobe that looked like it was put together in the dark. His backpack was clumsily attached to his side, papers begging to fall out of its partially unzipped condition. He was slightly crouched over, his cheeks somewhat flushed, probably from running so fast to reach the classroom.
“For once in your life, please be quiet and listen,” Howard scolded.
“Then it wouldn’t hurt to try,” Tony said, “Maybe you guys could go as friends and then continue on from there, maybe start asking her to hang out, just the two of you. If it’s meant to happen, then it will happen.”
Ulrich nods before retaking his seat.
and then there is a moment where he doesn’t even have that.
Even though Reed told him there was three Skrulls, he only sees two other people when he hovers over the edge of the ice.  It’s Black Widow and Falcon, costumes from a few years ago. Their faces are unlined, younger in comparison to their counterparts.  It reminds of him of the times before the Registration Act, the fighting, and everything.
he thinks as Tony laughs so hard his shoulders shake. It’s worth being honest.
"Of course," he replies before giving his review on the latest version of the treadmill, about the jerking in the belt when he goes to level 20 or beyond.
Tony puts an arm around him.  “Oh yeah kid.  I’ve got about a million more from where that comes from.”
Tony wakes up in a series of moments.
Steve takes them to the bed, holding up Tony one handed as he pulls back the comforter before depositing Tony on the bed with a soft bounce. Tony stays there, vibrations still there, buzzing until his skin feels like a swarm of bees about to take off, head feeling like something is closing in on it, and chest too tight.
The inside of the old black cadillac.  It gleams in the light, and Tony closes his eyes against the sudden brightness.  The shade of blue around the edge of the engine is unnatural, and Tony leans back as the car begins to move on it’s own.  It rolls to the edge of the table before stopping. It slowly morphs into a small flying vehicle, a little similar to Howard’s stark industries prototype way back in the 40’s.  Tony smiles, soft, and remembering his father talking about flying cars when he was small, too small to really remember but more like remembering stories he had been told and reimagined over the years.
Then all the images around him start at once, the singing that sounded so far is suddenly too loud and just when Tony is going to let go to cover his ears, the other tightens its grip and waves it’s free hand.  Everything shatters and begins to fall and so do they.
If Steve closes his eyes he can see how Clint rolled his eyes at him. "I was on a mission and you know that but you also know exactly what I am talking about here."
Please don’t look up the footage
The room is littered with parts, tools, and small things that look like Captain America memorabilia.  Tony remembers that was a part of what kept SI afloat in the early days.
“Playing the odds,” Tony replies softly as the elevator door opens.
She looks up in the mirror, face young and eyes heavily lined.  “Oh Tony,” she whispers. “I wondered when it would be my turn.”
Tony feels impossibly fond.  "I would rather be caught with my friend Steve."
Steve’s sharp intake of breath tells Tony he heard something of that, maybe felt it more.  The connection’s shape still changes from time to time.  He still gets it, and leans close.
good job
“Ugh,” Tony groans.  He breaks the web slinger apart until the parts are scattered in front of him.  His fingers dance over the different pieces.  “That department has been useless from day one.  I need to dissolve it and just throw those guys in mobile software.  They are not hardware geeks.”
“Not for you,” he returns, calm.
Rihan’s mouth drops.  “Oh, thank you Mr. Stark,” she stammers.  “I know a few people who would love to try out the prototype.”  Tony knows she does.
All five bulbs light up.
Noise erupts in the room. “How?” Steve shouts over the dull roar as he steps closer. Barnes comes off the wall in corner of her vision, and Natasha turns her attention to Steve, but keeps an eye on T’Challa.
He had smiled then, he remembers.  "You're a good friend Vision."
(DUM-E is the first.  It means something to be the first.  To stay.)
“Thank you for the time sir.”
T’Challa follows as the walk down the hallway to the frosted glass room.  The table is smaller than the one at the Avengers Compound, but it does fine for this meeting.  “I confess,” the man behind the Black Panther announces.  “I did not suspect you would have conference room in your home.”
"You'd test it on yourself but no one else?"
Dad leans down and scribbles another note.  “What do you need a drill for Tony?” he queries to his paper.
She didn’t mean it like that, but she doesn’t push the topic. Coulson accepts the report and files it away, which is what she needed him to do from the get go. Whatever it took to get it done.)
Steve stills, thinking about the canvases he has littering Tony's lab. "I'll have the lab cleared out this afternoon."
Tony goes under the water screaming the first time.  He’s shouting things, Yinsen is shouting, the men are shouting things.
They continue on like this for a while. Chirps are exchanged, there is a moment where Clint's perch explodes and Tony is too far away to catch him, only to have Thor to snag him right before he hits the ground, and Hulk gets a little too enthusiastic about tossing parts that he snags Natasha in the temple with a stray piece of robot armor and Steve in the gut with a robot arm. Tony probably has a head injury from how hard one robot smacked him in the head.
Steve looks up from the sketchbook balanced on his knee and over at Tony who is watching him with clear eyes. He’s been awake for a while, and Steve never caught it.
I know that's what you want too.
The hand releases as T’Challa takes a step forward.  “Follow me Tony.”
"Patch Rhodey in, Fry. Secure as possible."
He’s giddy as they get head out, taking a pod, zig-zagging through downtown until they end up on the 23rd level of what used to be Avengers Tower.  His Avengers tower. But even now the feel is different. It’s like the last vestige of something he knows is slipping through his fingers. He’s truly all alone here.   And there is no way back.
"He's breathing," Bucky murmurs as he hauls Steve up and makes him cross the space between him and Tony.
Rhodes helps the medical unit get Tony situated on the stretcher. "What about drawing?"
There is a thought in his head, floating.  He uses that as a lodestone in the water.  Unraveling the idea until it’s a fully formed thought.  Until that is a hair brained scheme.  Until it’s a fully formed plan.
Some days, this happens when they have a mission in a few hours.
He reaches for the decanter to his right at first before grabbing a water bottle instead.  “I knew we were screwed a long time ago T’Challa.  I was just trying to limit the number of people who would get hurt.”
He had missed it.)
He lands on the balcony of the palace with guards approaching from every corner.  Tony stands there in the suit until the face plate pulls back.  “Woah,” he says, hands upraised.  “I’m just taking a buddy up on an offer to drop by and visit.”
It was never inevitable.
The heart monitor is flatlining, an angry noise.  Steve looks up to the camera, frustration written in every line of his face, and Tony thinks, maybe uncharitably,
She breathes for a moment before saying, "You deserve to be happy."
"Tony," she states, quiet.
Tony has also mastered the skill of ignoring Steve in the long months after Germany and Siberia.  T’Challa’s wandered away a while back.  Steve is leaning against a wall, using it to support him, used to watching Tony work.  Tony flicks his eyes to him, calculating the distance before going back to the tablet.  It’s far enough.
Not well.  But Wilson is handling him.
"Boss," FRIDAY whispers and she sounds wrecked. Tony huffs laugh, because she is an AI and
“Bad dreams?” Tony asks, even though he knows the answer.
Bruce smiles softly, checking his conversation with FRIDAY, before typing out a final reply.  The list of groceries is finalized.  He looks up, and Tony is staring at him, smoothie almost finished, with a bit of wonder in his eyes.  Bruce meets his gaze, smile lingering.  "You know you don't..." Tony trails off, before looking over at his hologram at the other end of the room.
Tony’s lips twist, because it’s true but he still thinks he is getting foot traffic because he’s the undead freak.  The second exhibit will be the true showing.
How is Rhodey doing?  Really doing?
Jan sniffles behind him, and Tony lets the paper fall from his suddenly nerveless fingers as he looks down the metal box hovering in front of him.  This is Steve’s new home, forever and until the end of time. Tony had built it for him, but wishes this isn’t the last home he had built Steve. Hadn’t left this as the last room he had made for his friend.
“You had to take the side.  You were trying to protect us from ourselves,” Steve replies, leaning as close as he can without Tony moving away.  “And that was Red Skull. It was all Red Skull.”
"So you're either sleeping around, or you sleep somewhere else," Rhodey observes.
wooow.  is the leg fritzing out because of the power surge or the water?
Tony tightens his grip on the kid for a second before releasing him.  “Come say hi to Rhodey, eat your weight in food and then come back down here and make sure everything is good.
The lens on the suit get large for a second, taking in the empty room, before narrowing to slits.  "But Cap said you were the one who decided to recruit me."
That’s why he was so surprised that one night, after Ultron, after some of the initial runs to find the Winter Soldier, Steve says, “I don’t remember much of the ice.”
“No,” Tony bites out. “Get over here.”
and as he is about to close his eyes, red and gold fills his vision.
“I hate you,” Tony says with a passion that makes Barnes chuckle, before adding, “Where am I dropping you off?”  There is another whale coming towards them and Tony would rather get on that now rather later.
“I know you,” Steve whispers, and it feels like an incantation. Tony meets his gaze, and Steve holds it. “I believe in you.”
.  He thinks about how far away that desperation feels now. “There are worse ways,” he retorts mildly.
His feet take him to the curb, and he remembers he had hijacked Happy into giving him a ride while Pepper was safe and sound in the office.  Tony looks for a taxi, unwilling to call the suit to him in the middle of New York.  But his Mercedes gleams from it’s place at the curb, Rhodey leaning against it in careful study of nonchalance.  Bruce and Vision are beside him.
“Come on,” Steve says, hand on his shoulder as they start walking through the living room.  “Let me introduce you to everyone.”
A quick smile will be needed here. He’ll say,
Tony leaves early in, bracketed by Rhodey and Pepper. Steve watches from one of the many tinted windows as they ease him into the car.
There is roar, and the Hulk has joined the party. "HULK SMASH."
Nothing to hide behind.  Nothing to fear. It’s disconcerting, but he can’t help but feel warm and comfortable.
“It’s nothing!” Peter rockets out of his seat and starts looking at the exits for the best escape.  “I’ll just talk to Fry.”
“It’s all connected,” she huffs, still marveling at the complicated mess. Tony had been playing 4 dimensional chess, and it’s almost beyond her, even with him leaving her hints along the way.
(Steve had laughed when he had come on comms, just before he leap out of a plane, and Tony tries to not memorize how the way the laugher had melted into the whoosh of the air.  The agent on the other line, and then Hill, hadn't been so happy.)
There are pictures littering her vanity, of her and Howard.  Her and Peggy. Of him, around age 4, 7, and infant sized. Of Jarvis and Ana.  Of Daniel and Peggy. Of Howard and him. It’s his family, his childhood strung across this table with her make up and lipstick.
Some things, he’s learned while he’s unlearned hope, are too hard to remember.
Tony picks up his water bottle again.  “I’m not the one in a corner.  I felt like I should be honest and open with you before I show you my entire hand.”  FRIDAY minimized Steve’s face and brings up the new version of the Accords for T’Challa’s perusal.  “Here’s every change my lawyers proposed.  Tell me what you think.  FRIDAY download it to his smart phone right now.”
He doesn’t turn until she shakes his arm and says, “
once to Rhodes, who watches him so closely, Steve is only a small percentage sure that Rhodes can’t burn him alive with his gaze alone.  A very small percentage.
He trains, watches the news, set adrift because while there are problems that need solving, but there isn't anything he can do. He'll only make it worse as Cap, and as Steve...he's always been pretty useless.
Steve surveys the battlefield and catches Thanos advancing on Wanda in between other superheroes jumping in and out of the way, trying to slow his assault.  “Wanda,” he answers.
Steve hums for a moment, before quietly telling him the story about some kids who tried to pull everyone in earshot into singing "Let it Go".  Steve had had to hurriedly look up the lyrics before they set their eyes on him.
It's disorienting for a moment, there are two sets of thoughts, seeing himself in his own memory. The future yet not dancing before his eyes. It's too much and his brain stretches and his skin feels too small.
It’s in Wakanda that Steve admits it, shapes the words to the trees in barely a whisper. But he does it, pushes the words past the lump in his throat, the swollen feeling of his tongue. He says them, finally.
There is a shadow lurking in the corner of the kitchen. Tony knows it’s Steve because he’s the only one in the tower right now, between missions to find Bucky. They’ve fallen into a comfortable rhythm since SHIELD went down in a splash. Usually, Steve finds him after his workout loose limbed and water still clinging to his hair. They talk about anything or nothing until Steve reaches out, and Tony follows until they find the nearest surface and work through everything in their systems.
“We train for many things,” T’Challa responds evenly.  “When you live in secret, you prepare for all sorts of scenarios.  Mostly an enemy intent on destroying everything you stand for.”
Steve laughs, soft and light.  “Never change Tony.”
He grabs a discarded tablet and sits on the conveniently placed couch near the new workout room. With a few swipes, the device is projecting a mini version of the exoskeleton Rhodey is currently wearing. After placing the tablet on the ground so he can manipulate image he duplicates the prototype design with a flick of his wrist before sliding the original away. "FRIDAY," he calls. "Save any changes done here as the Mark 17."
"That was you Tony. Not me."
He barely remembers Steve not angry - what his face looked like when he was happy to see Tony.
He’s cut off of the blaring noise of a news alert.  Everyone looks at the screen, as a blonde news anchor says, “There has been an attack in South Sudan. The civil war has been escalating since 2013, two years after the country established independence, when the Vice President and a majority of the new government’s cabinet.”
She turned from the mirror looking around the room for something that she could use. On the window, she noted a rubber band, which she knew would rip out her hair, but she had no choice. Though she wanted to put it in a bun, she settled for a low pony tail, which wasn't all that neat. However, she was happy with her work and headed to the restroom. She noticed Barnes eyeing her, but he didn't say anything to her.
Barnes' hand dropped to his side. "Steve," he greeted.
*O*O*
The pain started to die, and words started to make sense again; however, she still felt like surrounded by a heavy misty. Her mind felt weak, exhausted. She felt like she had been awake for…god knows how long.
He turned back to Rumlow and the Senator, as his hand went to his belt, mindlessly playing with a hunting knife. He balanced the blade with his fingers as he swirled it around, while his eyes drilled into the Senator's eyes. If the Senator wasn't already shaking in his pants, he was now.
Steve's glare only deepened. "Did I not tell you to shut up, Stark?" he said, as he finally took a step to her.
"Even if Steve and I sat out, Clint," Bruce started, "you still don't have a chance." He glanced toward the sleep Brunette in Steve's arms. She was balled up against Steve with her head on his chest.
He went down faster than he cared to admit, not that he had must time to think. With his mind so focused on the brunette, he had been distracted and unfocused, allowing someone to come up behind him. Unforgivable in his eyes. For that he was angry with himself. How could he allow himself to be weak over a woman?! Over anything. He was a weapon with a weakness, and a weapon with a weakness was worthless. He was worthless. How could he be worth anything if he couldn't produce? He was useless. No wonder his handlers were angry.
The man cracked a smile before holding at his hand and saying, "Sam Wilson. There. Not a stranger anymore."
"Anyhow, it's getting colder. Let's start walking again," she stated.
Steve left out a heavy sigh. "Why do you keep doing this?" he asked, clearly annoyed.
"That's why I'm letting her go," the Colonel stated, surprising everything in the room.
"It would depend on Miss Stark's instructions. I cannot go against her order."
"My master doesn't want her hurt," he said. That sounded weird to Toni, considering how harsh and brutal this man had been back in the alley. There was a point that she thought he was going to severely hurt her, but now, he seemed almost scared. Did his master threatened to kill him if she was? But how would the master know how he treated her?
"Fury gave it to you. Why?" Natasha replied, her voice laced with confusion. As if to take the whole picture in, she took a small step back, putting herself fully against the wall. Her eyes scanned him, trying to get a read.
"Hey, wait up! Wait, wait."
As Howard connected the Tesseract, Toni stepped back to her device and got down onto her knees. The interface that her father added would help her control the device better, allowing her to transport to the correct time. Though this was all a theory, Toni had faith that it would work. There was no way that both her father and her calculations were wrong. Now, she just needed to pick a time, and she had a day in mind.
"What power does that bitch have over you?" Rollins asked, eyeing the assassin. "We should have killed her."
him. Yes, she knew she was being selfish, putting so much on Steve, but she didn't care… Okay, she did. She didn't want to be a burden. She didn't want to be selfish. She didn't want to be that person, who forced him to choose between something he loved to do and her… but she needed him. She needed him at her side. She needed him to hold her, to tell her that everything was going to be okay. She needed him to be there.
There was a strong look in his eyes, protective and loving. "You need to get out of your own head, because let me tell you something, I knew Bucky since we were kid. And even as a kid, he stood for the little guy. Heck, I lost count to how many times he jumped into fights to save someone and that isn't counting the times he had my back when I found myself in a fight." He let out a small warm smile. "He would go to war for the people he loved, and that included you. Toni, he loved you. He loved you more than you know." His voice dipped slightly.
"And the Colonel?" Clint asked, giving her a look. It was clear that he was not a fan of the nickname.
"Toni," he spoke, softly, as he reached forward and pulled gently into his arms. Without wasting a second, she nestled her head on his should and buried her face in his neck. He could feel her hot breath on his skin, as he held her firmly in his arms. "Toni."
Steve had to admit that Toni was adorable when she was like this. He also didn't mind how clingy she got when she was like this. She was a squid, as she wrapped herself around him, refusing to let go for anything. "Did either Clint or Natasha asked you to?" It wasn't exactly fair to ask her these questions, when she had no filter, but he had to know. He didn't need their pity. He didn't need her pity.
kind of rest," she replied, coldly, as she glared at him. She also didn't like him touching her device, but she didn't make any move to stop him. It was useless without the core anyhow.
"Don't give me that shit. What's wrong?" she asked pushing his hand off her shoulder, and using his arm as an anchor. Seeing the scared, depressed look on his face, she kept a grip on his arm and she squeezed.
and Extremis." Reaching into her pocket of her sweater,
"We would never. Why don't you just go with Rollin?"
Toni felt the air leave her lungs. "W-what?" she asked, shocked. Her brain couldn't wrap itself around what he had just said.
"Oh, you want to bet?" she asked. "I b-" The genius didn't get to finish her sense as Steve grabbed her by her waist, picking her up and place his lips against hers. They didn't break apart until he heard the room groan.
"So Stark isn't coming up?" Natasha asked as she left the well-stocked bar.
"Stealing the USA Flag doesn't count," Toni stated as she stared at the paper.
As he took down the Quinjet, he forced his mind away from Toni, a woman that he would find no matter what. Though he would need to locate her first, he doubted that Rollins would take Toni to SHIELD;s headquarters, not if they wanted her for something. Wherever she was, he would not allow anything to happen to his genius.
"I am anything but old," he countered. Yes, he was over 90, but he wasn't sure if he considered himself a 90 year old. He had a body of a 25 year old, and he wanted to use it.
As if in a horror move, the doors started to close. Acting immediately, Steve attempted to stop the doors by throwing his shield to act like an opposing force, but it just bounced loudly against the metal before returning to him. Forcing himself to remind calm, he turned to Natasha. "Any how way out?"
*O*O*
Rogers looked at her before turning away and staring at the wall. He stayed like that for a few minutes before he turned back. "Where did you go that night of the expo?" he asked, stepping to her. "You disappeared with no good bye."
He watched her body language as she moved. "Why don't you come back up to the apartment? It's chilly down here." Though the door was close, there was a cold draft.
Harley stepped to Toni, eyeing her shaky form. "What did I say?" he asked, looking someone had kicked his puppy. He looked heartbroken at seeing Toni like this.
He sighed. "Just as I remember. I will try, though that bruise on your face makes it difficult."
Banner glanced at Steve before looking back to Toni. "He got to heat the cube to a hundred and twenty million Kelvin just to break through the Coulomb barrier," he said.
Zola crossed to the table and stared at the Arc Reactor. "I do not want to see a woman tortured like this. Please tell us what we want to know." There was some hesitation in his voice.
