"Hey!" Barton called out. "You said you'd take full responsibility for whatever shit we did or said!"
"I know you were kind of horrified by that photo they got of you at Shake Shack, so maybe you might want to set your fork down now."
He tilted Tony's head up just the slightest and brought his mouth down to Tony's, hard, fast, possessive, like he was a man drowning and kissing Tony was the only way he could get air. Tony startled a bit and tried to pull back, but he was sick of arguing, and he was sick of fighting, and he just wanted to be
Tony snorted a laugh, eyes still closed. "Maybe we should—"
But Steve just shushed him and said, "Just dance," as he began to sway with him to the gentle rhythm. Tony put his arm around Steve's shoulders and reached up to press a cheek to his, and he closed his eyes and let the mood overtake him, forgetting for a moment that he was both angry and upset with the man holding him in his arms.
had problems with sharing, clearly you do not know Steve as well I as I do."
Steve just nodded and sat up, yawning and scratching his chest in the dim light of early dawn. He settled and watched Tony a moment then said, "It really doesn't hurt?"
"—I don't think Olivia is the only thing you have left of Steve."
"New crayons?" she asked, excitement coloring her voice. "Eh," he said and hit the button for the elevator, "close enough."
Tony just gawked, and Steve shrugged, sheepish but still amused.
Tony snorted out a laugh and rubbed his hands over his belly. "Fuck, and I thought that was just a bad dream. I didn't think it was going to be prophetic."
Steve grinned as he nestled the baby closer. "That 'baby' smell or whatever they call it. It's nice."
Bucky made an airy motion with his hand. "Sort of," he conceded. "There was…what was his name? Phil."
Tony made a 'hmm' sound and looked at the picture they made in the mirror together. Not bad, but then, even in his other body, he and Steve had always 'looked right' as a couple. "So, you won't be embarrassed to be seen with me?"
He blinked to clear his thoughts, and Wilson directed his attention to him and said, "I wasn't sure if you'd show after Nat said you weren't piling into the limo with us."
"No, Tony, I'm not, uh… It's fine. I'm fine. I'm just going to go brush my teeth. Stop being so paranoid."
At that, he bounced the little gummy-mouthed infant in his arms that — Steve didn't care what Tony said — was never going to be a graduate of MIT, but Steve glanced over and couldn't help but smile at the gurgle of laughter his little baby girl let out.
Tony frowned at him. "Sorry, boo-bear. I know we had our little 'if neither one of us is married by the time we're fifty' pact—"
Tony huffed out a breath and said, "Well,
"Oh," he said, recognizing the signs of what he knew was Steve's public foreplay, "
He set the plates and the flatware down, and Natasha and the other two began to serve themselves, and as he took the last chair at the island, Tony said, "You know what? We'll make it interesting. If it's a girl—"
"What? Does everyone need to know my business?" he asked without thinking, his tone admittedly a bit snappish, but the guy just nodded at the door and said, "This is the men's room."
"And people think
Glass houses, man. Glass houses. Stones. Get off my lap."
"Five-eight," she murmured to herself then went to write it down, and Tony looked at the little metal rod ahead of him and squinted at the tic marks and said, "Are you sure? I thought I was five- nine."
Steve snorted a laugh — it wasn't true, but yeah, OK, maybe he could be as corny as that sometimes — and Tony finished shaking sugar crystals onto the cookies then slid the sheet into the oven to bake. After he'd closed the oven door and set the timer, Steve smiled more fully at him and said, "Come on. It's not that bad is it? Celebrating Christmas, I mean."
"Steve!" Tony's voice called from downstairs, and, startled, Steve nearly dropped the frame. He set it down and went over to the door.
But Steve was nothing if not tenacious, and he slid his hands down Tony's arms then wrapped his own arms around Tony's waist and reiterated, "Why shouldn't I find you attractive in this body?"
"Sure, kid. It's yucky-stuff-free."
"Whatever. Look, if it makes you feel better, it's not like we're going to pretend I'm someone else. Just act like I look like myself. We'll make them think they're the crazy ones. Come on, that asshole Barton has it coming to him."
that we talk about? How come it's never any of you?"
Tony couldn't sleep.
Bruce clicked on the last empty tube to fill, and Tony watched the blood seep in slower than it had on the first tube and said, "Is this your way of trying to tell me something?"
And yet, the man he'd dreamt about bore such a striking resemblance to the one now staring up at him from the SHIELD dossier that he could be forgiven for thinking they were one in the same.
Tony hummed a bit then said, "Honestly, I...kind of enjoy doing it? Weirdly. And it doesn't...
"I'm happy to hear that," Steve said and set the other half of the bagel down on a plate in front of him before we went about fixing another one for himself.
" Tony sputtered then looked from Rhodey to Bruce and then to his disappearing fiancé, who was gnashing his teeth together, his jaw doing that thing it did whenever something was really pissing him off.
just fuck me!”
"Probably. These are ridiculously lame. I mean, I get I'm talking to the man that thought 'Lady Liberty' was a good counter to 'Jabba the Slut.'"
"Like you mean it," Steve said, and Tony raised an eyebrow.
Steve just glared at him and said, "You know, maybe this was a bad idea."
"Uh, she's our kid, so clearly, she's going to be a genius."
your property. I am not someone you own. I have had my body fucked with against my will. I've been forced into being a fucking human
Barnes just blatantly ignored him and turned his attention to Natasha. "You want to come to Arlington with us?"
He sat up some and reached out to grab his phone, and Tony watched over his shoulder as he thumbed through the contacts.
Now it was an even more terrifying ever-present fear in the back of his mind because he had a life here now. He had a reason to stay. He had friends and a job and a purpose.
He could keep his mouth shut. He could keep his mouth shut and let Steve kvetch about the gala and his wish to stay home and how much he hated those things, and they could go about their business, friends and nothing more, and Tony could continue to nurse this painful crush of his that was most definitely more than a crush at this point and— Look, no one else outside of him treated his helper 'bots as anything but helper 'bots, but here was Steve, stupid, beautiful Steve, playing with DUM-E and talking to DUM-E and treating DUM-E like an adorable, over-excited puppy, and could he help it if Steve was just,
But, of course, Steve didn't listen, and once he got clear of it, he made a dash for the gaping hole in the side of the building, disappearing into the smoke and flames. Tony cursed a blue streak that earned him a huge laugh from Barton, blasted a few more goons, and then blasted his way into the building (which…was stupid, but he was pissed at Steve for pulling this bullshit again, and better blast the building than Steve). He did a scan, wondered how that idiot was even surviving the heat and the smoke, and then found the two closer to the center of the building, beams creaking and glass shattering and destruction raining down all over them.
"You're like a child sometimes," Bruce muttered. "Steve isn't here, and I can't carry you up the stairs, so, Thor, if you'd do the honors?"
Steve flipped to the next section of menu but said nothing.
"That you're…a little less than average for a man."
for him.
"I was at an orgy. Once," Tony admitted before Steve could spiral any further down into his self- pity. "I mean it's not... I guess when you're young and horny it's kind of...exciting. I'm not— I wasn't—"
"Meaning he did curse out the players," Barnes said. "Kicked the seat, almost broke his foot, threatened never to attend another Dodgers game in his life—"
"Me, hooking up with a fella from the city. And a rich one, too."
— before he handed it over to his wife. "Sure, yeah," he said and smiled at Tony. "My dad's an accountant. He'll know what to do."
Tony cocked his head to the side at him. "Really?
you," she said. "
He had a dream that night that he was planting flowers in front of a tombstone. It was warm out, sunny — he got a sense of it being late-afternoon. For whatever reason, the name was partially obscured on the stone, Steve only being able to read Anthony Edward and nothing beyond that. The dates were also a bit fuzzy as well, his eye only able to make out the months. A woman with dark hair came up beside him and crouched down to his level just as he'd finished patting down the soil and pouring a little water over the flowers, asking him "Almost done there, soldier?" and after complementing him on the flowers added, "I know he'll appreciate them."
"Thought it sounded kind of exotic and mysterious. I could totally pull off being a 'Natasha.'"
"Four. At the museum. I don't have any classes on Fridays."
The one that was clad in purple overalls, her hair pulled back into a ponytail as she clutched what looked like a plush Captain America doll tight in her arm. He wasn't good with ages, but he'd peg this one at about three — maybe a little older — and his stomach did a somersault as her mother said to her, "Emma, come on, over here," and beckoned for her to follow over to another row of chairs near to some children's play sets.
Barnes had sat up some, and he had a look on his face like he was trying to figure out the easiest and fastest way of getting out of there so he wouldn't have to deal with Tony's tears. DUM-E just beeped and whirred like he wasn't sure what to do, magnifying glass still in-claw. But Tony shook his head and waved off their concern.
Natasha just pursed her lips and raised her eyebrow at him as the cab pulled up to the curb. "Trust me," she said and swiped her card to pay for the ride, "no one's going to know it's you."

"But the King needs an
"When's that?"
He took a breath and struggled to his feet for an entirely different reason than he'd become accustomed to the past several months. He was achy and sore and fucking
"Good," he said, and Tony felt him get back up off the bed. It was another moment before he sensed that Steve was standing in front of him again, and then Steve's hands were at the back of his head and undoing the tie that held the blindfold on.
But Tony just stroked his hair some more and said, "Sometimes I worry I'm not enough for him. I'm not enough to keep him happy."
with the child of a super soldier. There was no guarantee that this child would be in any way affected by the serum, but on the off-chance that he was…
He went back into the bedroom and looked around. He didn't see any suitcases lying about, so he went over to the dresser and pulled open a couple drawers until he found one filled with socks and underwear. It wasn't too hard to figure out which belonged to him and which to Tony — God, just the fact that… He shook his head and ignored the pile of colorful briefs and instead grabbed a dark gray pair of those snug boxers he'd awoken to find himself dressed in. He grabbed a t-shirt and found another set of those pajama pants with the strange faces on them and went into the bathroom to get himself cleaned up.
"Are you sure you want to know that?"
"Well," Steve said and poured the egg mixture into the pan, "they didn't have them back in my day, and modern-day technology can be so gosh-darn confusing sometimes—"
"We don't have time for that now," Steve said, not even bothering to glance back at Tony. He just

"You know, at least Pepper
"Oh, don't worry," she said, smiling, giddy like she was thrilled even just to be in the same room, "I know who this is." She stuck out her hand to Tony and said, "It's so nice to meet you. I've heard so much— I mean, I've read so much about, uh…"
"What are you doing?" Steve asked.

"What about me?"
"It's
He heaved out a heavy breath. "One slice?"
"It's corny as hell, but it's a holiday classic," Sam said. "Right up there with the Grinch and Charlie Brown."
"Hey!" he cried through a mouthful of doughnut and jelly. "That was mine, you son-of-a-bitch!" Steve just licked his lips and said, "Not anymore."
"You…didn't believe him?" Tony asked slowly, not sure where Barnes was going with this.
"Kind of has it in that big, blonde head of his that you don't really like him anymore," he continued after he finished thinking about getting his hands on his husband's ass.
Tony bit his lips a moment to keep from smiling too hard, and when he'd gained control of himself, said, "Hmm? No, I don't. What did I say?"
"Still OK?" Steve asked before he fully pushed the plug in. "
"Yeah, that's great, Steve, but all I see is more of my choices being taken away from me. I don't even have fucking autonomy over my body anymore, and you cannot even

"You really want to do this?" Steve asked, arms folded on the table as he looked at the bottle like an obstacle to be overcome.

"Fuck off," he said and shot a look at him. "I'm speaking 'old man' so the fossil I'm married to knows exactly what I'm looking for."

She stopped just beside the introductory panel featuring what could only be a self-portrait of a gorgeous blonde with long hair and dark eyes — one of those taken-in-the-mirror photographs that people even in the modern day used for selfies. Beside the photograph was a write-up on the photographer, more gloss than actual fact, and Tony noticed two years in parentheses next to the name: 1944 - 1968.
would I have had time?" He looked at Natasha. "Have I had any time the last six weeks to blow fourteen thousand dollars at an arcade?"
"You might be retaining some fluid," Bruce murmured from the back. "It happens. Have you done…
Natasha remained silent but kept up the pressure on his back as she kneaded her fingers in.
"It's not like that," Bucky said with a laugh and shook his head a bit before he went back to turning the peg on the head of the guitar, attempting to match the tone of the string with the app on his phone.
Something cold and hollow shot through him as he felt, for the first time, that Barnes might actually be
story about what happened. I didn't want to freak him out. But he knows about her in theory — that I had an alternate-universe daughter. He just doesn't know that she was his daughter, too."
"Fuck."
The serum had begun to work its magic by the time they arrived back in New York, and Tony didn't feel bad about shaking Steve's shoulder and urging him to wake up because no one was carrying his ass off the jet. Steve was groggy and grumbled as he sat up, and Bruce disconnected the intravenous lines and said he would be OK and just needed to take it easy for a while, and Tony rolled his eyes and said, "You know who you're talking to, right?"
Tony rolled his eyes and slumped into the bed. "That's the whole point of the checkup here, Brucie. To find out what's wrong with me. Why do you have to be so difficult?"
But Steve just closed the trunk, and he leaned down and smacked a kiss against Tony's forehead. "I'll protect you," he said then gathered the rest of the bags up in his arms and nodded his head toward the door.
"Dude!" Wilson cried.
"Which is your flighty way of saying 'yes.'"
"The hour of our departure is upon us," Thor said, "and I believe it is time for our brothers-in-arms soon to be united in the sacred bonds of Midgardian matrimony to bid their farewells to one another until the dawn of a new morn."
"Completely his choice," she agreed with a nod.
As Steve slowed the car to a stop at a red light, he glanced over to Tony and said, a smirk tugging at his lips, "Well, good. I don't feel so bad for marrying you for your money now."
"No," he said with a slightly defensive shrug, choosing not to look at Bruce. "But I'm sure it's what he's thinking. It's what everyone that's ever met me thinks — anyone that knew Howard and gets stuck with me, anyway."
"—then maybe you should just own it, you know?"
," against his mouth, and that seemed to be all the reassurance that Steve needed.
But the man just said, "Don't look like much of a 'Spare Parts Man,'" and turned to the woman beside him, who picked up an oversized purse from the floor and unzipped it, pulling out a thin box that would have fit a stack of 8x10s.
"Uh," he said and scratched at his forehead. "Where do you want to start?"
Natasha shrugged a little, and the designer, done berating the assistant for the time being, turned her attention back to Tony, but Natasha and her ensemble caught her eye, and she took a sweeping gaze over Natasha's red, strapless A-line and said a slightly smug, "Off-the-rack?"
Tony nodded. "Yeah, OK, I will."
"With SI, is something up? Pepper sounded a little more frazzled than usual."
Tony thought about this for a moment then said, "Yeah, but that's not what I—"
"Yeah, not really." He poured himself another glass, threw it back, then slammed the glass on the bar and started to make his way back to the elevator.
"No, I got it," she replied and finally got herself situated. "Unca Bruce, is An' Pepper mad at me?"
Steve, still sitting with arms folded, scuffed a booted foot against the floor and glanced over to him. "Thought it was because the license was only good for sixty days, and you said it would take longer than sixty days to plan the wedding bash you'd always dreamed of."
Tony waved him off. "I get it. Yeah, it's… It's an adventure. I make for a hell of a knockout dame."
"No," he said with a tired pant, "I'm good."
, to the girls' applause and accolades.
He trailed off without explanation, and he pulled Tony in a little tighter to sway with him. Tony, finding no means nor any desire to fight it, went with the motion, putting his other arm to Steve's shoulder and reaching up to press his check against Steve's.
"Is that sass? Are you sassing me at a time like this?"
Last night had been… Who knew Steve could get so worked up just

Barton glanced back toward him and motioned at him with the spatula. "You've got tells."
"No, see, I still am Tony, I'm just not physically male." He took a breath and let it out and said, "Long story short, Steve knocked me up."
He hung up the towels and wiped down the mirrors and straightened up what little he'd messed then crossed back into the bedroom and said, "We got anything good to eat here, J, or did my little wards eat it all?"

The ringing in Tony’s ears is loud, shrill and hysterical, his heart beats fast and painful, like it’s pulling too tight, nearly imploding inside his ribcage.

like a son to Jarvis. He does not like to be disrespectful, but Howard Stark was not always a good role model for a child, and Jarvis tried to fill more holes in Anthony’s education than any person in his position should have. For all intents and purposes, he was a butler, not a teacher. Not a parent. He had no authority over young Anthony Stark, but he loved him like a son anyway, just like his wife and Maria Stark had, and his loss hit him much harder that it should for a mere family acquaintance.

From his point of view, the sequence is rushed and confusing, just as it felt when he was up there, fighting. There are odd turns of his head on some occasions, and it’s weird to watch and not be there, because it feels like being inside a helmet someone else is controlling the direction of. Somewhere deep inside, the part of Tony’s brain that sometimes makes weird associations with no rhyme or reason, thinks this might be his very own Blair Witch Project –

Again, he has a point. Tony feels… oddly comforted, at the same time he feels chided, when he realizes he is not the only one second-guessing his decision in partaking this mission. He knows he was the one who suggested it, so if he backs out, it’s the worst kind of hypocrisy; But he is not the only one having

Tony sighs, tired, all of a sudden feeling like his soul is being sucked out of him, like the mere negative feeling of the room hits him like a physical blow, and he says, knowing that what will follow will not make it better. “She wants to go out there with us. In an armor, like me.”

This is… This is one of those nights. The nights where Steve’s hands itch for the need to grip something as hard as he can, making sure he’ll keep himself grounded, for his thoughts seem to go so far away he can’t be sure his body isn’t being dragged along with them. The nights he regrets he can’t forget, because now he has to live with what he has done and with what he has

You know what? Steve decides to risk it.
Just like that, the red-hot pit of fury stinging inside him floods over, and the bits he cannot contain spill out in his words, venomous and wounded, bitterness staining his tongue and teeth, tasting of copper and iron. “Because it’s
Dum-E also makes a noise, shriller and scratchier than U, and turns around ungracefully to follow Nebula’s request as she crouches in front of Tony, pushing his shoulders back so he can straighten his spine and she can open his ruined shirt.
“Did you manage to sleep?” Tony asks in the general direction of the room, to all of them, and they all give varying uneasy nods, eyes skirting away – even Nebula and the raccoon, when Tony shoots them a glance a little more intense, worry burning in his guts.

They are sitting at a table inside a tiny and cramped shop, at early hours in the morning, after a night making rounds and fighting off some gang members on the east side of the city. They sit by a dimly lit corner of the room, behind so many other tables full of people taking their first coffee or eating a sandwich, all of them so sleepy and distracted that Steve, Natasha, and Sam are only kind-of hiding behind baseball caps and cheap sunglasses, and nothing else. It’s a bit risky, but they don’t care. Well,

“What’s wrong?” Rhodey asks, alarmed.
“Right.” Rocket drawls. “An’ you got Anulax batteries?”
(May Parker.)
“Yes.”
Steve tries to tell Tony it’s fine, but he never gets the chance. He wonders if the Iron Man boots are meant to make him faster when he runs, or if he really is that fast on his own, but he also never gets the chance to ask.
"I wouldn't call it an absurd amount of money," Tony replies, safely back in his cocky persona as he rolls his eyes for show. "In fact, the Doc refused to let me compensate him. Insisted on it over and over."
Want is coursing through Steve's veins, and he’s longing to hold Tony's hand, at the very least. To take him in his arms and kiss him if he's lucky.
"Hi," he replies softly. "This is real, right?"
Steve is dozing off in the sun, enjoying a beautiful summer day. Or actually, he's
"He'd offered, I refused," Tony says. "I'll contact him."
His heart starts beating faster because he didn't hear the alarm. Shit. Pepper will be disappointed again.
Yon-Rogg bristles at the nickname and Anthony throws a jab that is unfortunately blocked.
Tony smiles and leans in for a kiss to seal the deal.
He'd left explicit instructions in his will… which yeah, Tony must be legally dead now, that will be a hassle.
"No, you’re not, because I'm back." Tony squeezes Rhodey’s nape. "Surely Iron Man by your side will help, right? We'll convince them to come in easy."
"Okay, okay, you've got this," Rhodes says while putting the smoothies on the tray. "Finally."
A planet with lots of blue appears, but also with some green and beige parts and white clouds.

Steve has a moment of moral weakness where he wishes for the foul to hit one asshole in that group in the face. In the end everyone is safe, apart from spilled drinks. Bummer. The Hydra fans have been rowdy all game long, from throwing trash on the field to insulting Steve by calling him a cheater for constantly playing in his Fully Shifted form. It's fine, Steve's used to it. Shifters and Regulars have coexisted forever, but there are still debates about what is acceptable or not in the name of 'fairness'.
Thor throws back his head and laughs, and Tony relaxes; he might tease, but Thor wouldn't put them in danger.
"Hydra probably gave him the serum when he was tortured in Azzano. We figure it's the only reason he survived the fall from the train." Steve pauses, looking down at his lap. "I should have looked for him."
"Maybe," Tony says with a wink that makes Steve shake his head, amused.
"I flew for hours. In fact, I realized I was over Nevada before turning back because I didn't want to face Pepper in California at the time. She would have had one look at me and made me talk about it."
"Ciao. See you!"
The suit that looked so normal a second ago, once finished forming, immediately changes. It's closer to the body, more streamlined. What Tony can see on the hub shows that it's advanced beyond his wildest dreams. FRIDAY is showing him steadicam footage of what must be a lab test, where Tony's morphing the armor continuously. One moment it looks like Veronica, then has big flight stabilizers, only to change to hovering cannons separate from the main suit, and so on. It's mesmerizing. It's also a lot of info for his recuperating brain, and health vitals pop up about his blood pressure. The video immediately stops.
Clearly, Tal finds the revelation to his taste because he's right in Tony's bubble again, daring to put a hand on Tony's lower back for an instant. It's been a while since Tony's been hit on this bluntly by a stranger, and he won't lie and say it's unpleasant.
"Yes." Steve offers his left hand, not letting go of Tony with the other. "Thank you so much for bringing Tony back."
Carol grins as they shake hands. "My pleasure."
That draws a loud bark of surprised laughter from Steve, who's now sadly hidden in a tent while changing.
Carol's face lights up. "Oh, Tony doesn't know about Rocket!" He wonders what’s exciting about that. "Does anyone have a picture? Or better, a video?"
"Ready?"
Tony has traveled all over the globe, from deserts to jungles and forests just like this one. He's been in multiple strange situations, and learned to trust his gut instinct. Which is why he's confident that this place feels off. For a moment he considers going back towards the encampment, but then chides himself. He doesn't need to run for protection like a frightened little boy. He picks up the pace and continues in the direction of the village.
"So fierce," Tony says with an amused huff. "Shush, you, keep your strength. It's going to be okay."
The babies are small, but they're fiercely determined to live, of that Steve is sure. In between meals, they sleep contentedly.
Carol seems perfectly at ease as she leads them deeper into the room. Tony wonders if she's an actual regular or if she's just faking it well. Steve follows, then Tony, while Nebula closes their ranks. There's a maturity in Steve's stance and walk that Tony hadn't noticed until now. He looks good, his steps wide and powerful, and it speaks to his experience and confidence. It's very sexy, and for the first time since Iantus, Tony lets himself openly admire the man. He'd despair that his libido is the first part of himself to get over the hurt, but he's self-aware enough not to be surprised. Frankly, Steve's strut wouldn't be out of place on a catwalk. When Tony averts his eyes from Steve's amazing ass, he notes that they've caught many patrons' attention.
"I know, I know. Can we not talk about it?"
Indeed, Zemo might look even more surprised by that than by Tony's earlier powers, which has him snort in amusement. Since he hasn't kissed Steve in what is criminally too long—okay, since they exited the Quinjet—and it's fun to rub it in Zemo's face, Tony gets on his tip toes and does just that. Steve doesn't miss a beat, taking Tony in his arms and deepening the kiss. It's very nice.
"Absolutely certain." He looks resolute, so Tony takes him at his word. At one point you have to let people be in control of their own agency.
"Yeah, we can go."
"Got it," Viv says, smiling. "Good luck with the babies."
"It's such an honor, Mister Stark! I am so happy you are back. I'm Peter. Peter Parker. Well Spider-Man, too, of course. Oh wow."
"Got it, DUM-E," Steve says. "I'm on time, no worries."
Yes, okay, that's Sharon Carter, but she's a good fifteen years older than the one in their reality.
"Daemons interact with other daemons as their persons would do. They sometimes touch each other, and are playful if friends, but will sneer and fight if they are enemies. But people touching each other's daemon is completely different. It is repulsive if your daemon touches a stranger, or even a friend. But it is quite intimate with partners or lovers." Thor inclines his head towards Lilly, who while listening hasn't moved an inch, still firmly on both Steve and Tony.
"Oh," Steve says in a little voice. Hell, he seems ready to cry, and it makes Tony worry again.
"Oh," Tal says after looking over. His smile actually widens, so he's not intimidated by Captain Marvel. Good for him. "Welcome to Knowhere then."
Tony must see the longing on his face because he hums. "I'm afraid I'm too wound up right now to fuck your magnificent ass as you deserve. Next time?"
"I'm Tony." He offers his hands to shake, which Steve does with enthusiasm—his big palm dwarfing Tony's—and a beaming smile. God, he's handsome.
"Germany?" Tony asks Rhodey.
"I'm working on it! It won't happen again, I swear. I will make a backup power source with emergency thrusters that will have a shielding against electronic disruption so secure that they'll want it for Fort Knox. Metaphorically."
"Check with Tony first," Steve says as he enters the Compound, looking for a water bottle.
"Buck-" Steve protests. Now's not the time to tease since Tony is in earshot, but when has that stopped his best friend?
(Or do you just endure it, for the sake of

So that’s not it. It’s not. He’s not trying to purposefully put himself in danger this time.
Ross affirms with a confidence so crystal clear that is honestly kind of hard not to feel a little swept away by his conviction.
Tony shrugs, and bites his lip, shifting his weight from foot to foot just to keep himself doing the slightest bit of movement – dreading that, if he stays still, he might actually start crying again.
Like he’s witnessing something he shouldn’t. Like he has stumbled upon a secret too big to ever be spoken about out loud.
He puts it inside the machine.
“Not without alerting people who might be watching.” The man says begrudgingly, suddenly feeling enough at ease to pull up a chair to himself. Jarvis’ hand never leaves the gun. “And we don’t want to show them our hand just yet. We don’t have the resources we need.”
?” Steve asks, rudely interrupting a conversation he simply happened to stumble upon, but the surprise burns so strong he couldn’t help it.
But Tony is not paying attention to it.
What the fuck is going on here?
It is not something he kept in his mind because it was useful. It is something far more fragile, more irrational and sentimental, because Steve is a sentimental fool and, sometimes, these things sneak up on him, and they take root in deep, dark corners of his mind so silently he doesn’t realize they are there, until they have already consumed everything.
severely injured, his entire torso stiff and aching, his body still torn from the attack of his own blade; And two, because Nebula is the less helpful partner for a stealth mission in the world, considering that she is, you know,
He has been gentle, he has been kind. They do not understand each other, not yet – they don’t speak each other’s languages, but the Captain’s voice is always low and unthreatening, and Antonio finds himself oddly transfixed when he talks. He did not scream, and he did not growl, as rumors he had heard so often in the South said; This man is no beast. Not in the sense he had been made to believe, at least.
Still.
? People know she’s here, right? She’s literally right by his bed, even though the corridor is empty. People have certainly seen her. How did no one freak out by the sight of a blue android alien walking around with Tony wounded, after all the shit New York has been through? Did Nebula fight anyone so they’d let them in? It sounds like something she might’ve done. But nothing seems broken, not as far as Tony can see, and Tony definitely feels the heavy, sluggish feeling he always feels after a night or two at a hospital, the weight only a drug-induced slumber can cause, so he’s been here for a while.
And Tony’s stupid heart flutters.

He reaches up towards his shoulder, and put his hands over Pepper’s and squeezes.
(Yeah. You always stop feeling anything else when you’re furious.)
“Okay.” He babbles, running his hands through his hair in clumsy gestures. “We might have an option for our Gauntlet. Okay. Okay, Okay.”
, something Tony has no time to overanalyze right now, not when he feels like there’s molten lava running through his veins
“Alright. Permission given.” Tony waves a hand in the air, shaking his head. “Hit me.”
“When you get through, send Romanov and Barton inside the House to check for hostages!”
Tony feels like his heart is going to explode – and Rhodey teases him endlessly.
“And they use it in Project PEGASUS.” Barton confirms.
and Tony fucking – Tony
“It’s nothing, really.” Tony laughs a little. “It might even help me get back on a regular schedule, for once. Eating, sleeping, and whatnot.”
“It seems to be holding him down pretty well. Can’t we get some more of those?”
“And May Parker.”
Both Nebula and Rocket seem deeply,
“He wasn’t mine.” Tony says, to the room at large, mostly because he feels the need to hear the words said out loud, because maybe they’ll sink in if he hears them coming from somewhere that’s not the deep crevices of his head, even if they do resonate in his voice.
he made it. For a split second, just a tiny moment he allows himself to be selfish, he’s not thinking about the war, or the serum, or anything other than the rapid, strong beat of his heart, thumping loudly, powerful and amazing against his ribcage, and he relishes on the feeling so new it actually disorients him.
Nebula gets up from the chair and moves to the side, the panel illuminating her from behind like a holy image, a halo of bursting colors and shifting brightness, a display that is almost mockingly beautiful for a scene so sad. Tony watches her move curiously, forcing himself to focus on her movement and not on the shadows that lurk behind his eyes, burning in his retinas, the memories that will fuel his nightmares forever, if he ever gets to sleep again.
"Yeah, whatever. Seriously, you people act like you live here—"
Steve sighed out a pained breath, and he squeezed his eyes shut and put his hands to his hips and said, "Buck—"
"We have those pajamas," he said. "Clint got them for us. I remember you said you went out and bought a dozen pairs so we'd never run out."
Tony sat back a little, and he put a finger beneath Steve's chin to tip his head up so he could look him in the eye.

Steve shook his head just a little. "Didn't make a mistake."

Steve stood next to the dresser, a pair of black socks and a white dress shirt now covering his body in addition to the underwear, and Tony went over beside him, smiling a little smugly at the fact that there wasn't
"You know that's going to slip out in the field one of these days, right?"
Bruce continued to ply Barton with actual, genuine questions about his supposed house-flipping, but Tony became distracted once Steve sighed a little in what sounded like relief and said "He's right. I mean, I think he's right," then turned to Tony. "You feel OK otherwise, right?"
The other two hummed their responses into their drinks, and Tony rolled his eyes and said, "Whatever. Can't say I didn't warn you," and picked up his soda. "Also," he said and swirled the ice around with the swizzle stick, "fuck all of you and your cocktails."
God, he really hoped he hadn't just spend thousands upon thousands of dollars on fakes. And was it him, or were Other Tony and Tracy kind of weird? Like

"First of all," Tony said, "thank you very much for that image. Whenever I try to imagine Wilson in my head, now all I have to do is think of a large, honking goose. I think it fits. Second, look, I didn't want to—"
"She was a kid! She didn't know any— She thought I had amnesia again or something! Look, it doesn't matter—"

any problems with Lang – which he doesn’t. Lang’s eyes are wide with sincerity, completely bare in their intentions and holding no secret intentions back, just his pure, unleashed desire to help and eager drive to do good. Irrationally, it almost makes Tony feel a little sad. A little sad, because he doesn’t know what it’s like to feel this intensely hopeful anymore, and Lang might be the only one among them who is still capable of it… But maybe that’s what they need. Maybe just one person is enough. One that is just as motivated, but not as desperate, to push them forward when all becomes too much.
if she did. She saved him.

“You do use a lot of references.” Steve comments, between bites of his sandwich, but he’s smiling out of the corner of his mouth. He used to find strange the sheer amount of nicknames Tony is capable of producing for one single person, but now, he kind of likes it. It always comes with a new movie session or a book recommendation attached these days. Last time it happened, it developed into a Fast and Furious marathon, that, although ridiculous, was extremely entertaining.
what he imagined it would be. He gets defensive, but not nearly as much as he used to – what would be the point, if they’re both here, in bed, and they have been over and over again? Denial is only as effective as the strength it takes to keep yourself away.
When you're on edge, you sometimes say things you don't mean. And sometimes, you say exactly what you mean. Whether it's fair or not, whether it's mean or not - whether it's true or not.

“No, no.” Tony stops her with frantic gestures, stealing the cables from her hand, hiding them behind himself. “I’ll do that. You go to the chair and get ready to get the coordinates. No one messes with my nanite compartment besides me.”
His hands are far too big for such delicate work, however. Thoughtlessly, he leans forward and grabs a toolbox from the side of the panel, pretending he doesn’t wince when the skin over his ribs pulls taut and the edges of his stab wound when he does, swallowing his whine back down to avoid alerting Nebula and making her turn around.  It’s not very effective, because he still grunts when he shifts back into a seated position, but Nebula doesn’t turn around anyway, and Tony feels a rush of something that is far too close to
You might think, from the way I talk about her relationship with Tony as being one with unspoken issues, or from the way this is a SteveTony fic, despite the setting I proposed so far being totally capable of allowing Pepperony to grow closer instead of further apart, that I dislike Pepper. I don't, actually. Pepper is a great character, she has clear morals and objectives, and I respect her. I might not ship it madly, but that doesn't mean I don't understand it, or can't imagine why people do; After all, canonically, Tony does love her, and wobbly as it is, it is the first romantic pairing of the MCU.
“Hey.” Natasha greets them as she slips into the room, silently closing the door behind her.
it had never been like this.
And Tony is not the one who came out of their disagreement with lower-body paralysis, so what can he possibly be so resentful about that he can’t handle ignoring their differences and just working together again? To beat the common enemy once more?
Eventually, she will meet Daniel. She’ll fall in love. She’ll get married and so will Howard, and they will work together for many, many years, reaching for the future so restlessly the adrenaline will never really fade. And Peggy is going to be happy every step of the way.
But how can this get any worse?
“I have no way of getting there.” Pepper reminds him, harshly. “Every single road is blocked! I’ve been in this area for days, no one can leave. I can’t walk all the way back to the Compound.”
they’re here. He most likely does. But there are no alarms blaring, no guards coming after them, so Steve doesn’t know what to think of it.
“That sounds exactly like the kind of thing he would expect.” Nebula adds, with a curt nod and a sneering expression.
“Pep, is everything alright?”

(Why are you being weird about this?)
But he knows that’s not normal. Hell, Pepper has said it to his face.
He heaves, fast and broken, the air never quite reaching his lungs, his brain desperate for oxygen and going hazy all too fast, shutting down everything; Full of white noise and fear and hopelessness, of sadness and guilt and shame and pain, and Tony can’t stop
“I’ve realized I have to be thankful for the time I had with her, even if it was short, and even if I miss it now. Because I had it, and that has to be enough.” His sad smile grows wider, pulling at his cheeks in a way that looks a little painful, but there’s something so unbearably fond in his expression that Tony finds himself unable to look away. “I knew I couldn’t have her forever, given the very nature of our lifespans – but now, even the smaller moments are things I cherish deeply. Because I did love her, and if I don’t have good memories to keep me going forward with my battles, I would have nothing.”
But he wonders if the opportunity will ever come; and if it does, if he will be courageous enough to take it.
Maybe that’s all he can do for her. To sit here and hold her, as she holds him.
Vision hesitates for a second, looking around the apartment to give them all a calculating glance, but he lowers his head respectfully and gives it a light shake, in a very polite refusal. “I’m grateful for the offer, Agent Barton, but I should be leaving. There is no need to endanger you with my presence any longer than necessary.”
“There is—” Steve chokes on air, suddenly feeling overwhelmed, and he has to discretely clear his throat and look away to keep his composure as he tells Bucky about this. “There is a prison there. For superhumans. A hidden place in the middle of the ocean. It’s…
Watching him walk closer is both relieving and grating. Tony doesn’t – Tony doesn’t wish anyone to die, that’s not the sort of person he is. He wouldn’t do something like that. And no matter how angry he had been with Rogers, how many hours of sleep he lost because of the selfish asshole, Tony has never wanted him to suffer.

“I see him.” Rhodes had choked out, despite the ash and the gray, despite the haze of dust floating in the air like the thickest of winter fogs, scratching like sandpaper every time they do so much as breathing in – past it all, past the dust of the fallen who has swallowed the world whole in less than a few seconds, Rhodes had
"He just needs a minute," Steve says, though clearly he's not convinced.
. But it's not the time to prod his own mind since they have a mission to finish.
"Fine, then. Show me my bunk."
Tony smiles. "Good, I am glad. I had a pleasant time too."
Nama's hand dwarfs his, maybe four to one. Tony acts as if it's not unsettling while being a little thrilled at the same time and keeps on his friendliest smile.
"Hello, Anthony," tall, blond and handsome says.
"Sorry, I'll put it back," Steve says, searching on the right side of the bin.
"Wherever you did, it's working," Steve says, smiling at him. "You have such a way with kids. Peter also worships the ground you walk on."
"We have first class tickets!"
That's a surprise. "Me?"
The bad news Steve acknowledges out loud for them both: "That doesn't look like Richard's lab."
The kiss works wonders to unwind Tony. He experimentally starts moving his hips, and yeah, that's it. Less gripping, more sliding, and it goes from almost too much to really fucking good in no time.
Steve fucks him faster and harder, ratcheting up the sweet tension more and more for Tony.
In Leipzig, they concluded that they needed to set the trap away from New York City and possible civilian casualties. Therefore, Avengers Tower was out. Tony suggested building a new compound for the Avengers in upstate New York, but the timeline was too uncertain to make sure there are enough defenses in time. Instead, after negotiating with the Air Force and NASA—Rhodey is a super-star at that—they go back to the rebuilt Joint Dark Energy Mission Facility in the Mojave desert. It's where they used to keep the Tesseract before Loki stole it in 2012. It's also a nod to Dr. Lawson's participation in the P.E.G.A.S.U.S. project, and where Carol relearned her history with Fury. As for Carol herself, she stays on Talos' ship that is cloaked behind the moon; they're worried that her presence, if obvious, would be too much of a deterrent for the Kree.
"Yes. Yes, I am. Actually didn't think I'd make it this far," WIM-Tony says.
Tony blinks. "Really?" Before Steve feels self-conscious, Tony drags him down in a heated kiss. "Oh, Sheriff, it will be my pleasure to rock your world," he purrs when they separate and it makes Steve's body hair stand on end.
Tony is pretty certain of where this conversation is going, but he needs it to be without ambiguity. "What are you offering, exactly?"
"Yeah, that summer I spent some time with Bill Gates – Dad's idea. Bill was, what, nineteen? He was in Harvard if I remember correctly, and he didn't quite know what to do with me at first. But he showed me about computers and all that. And then I built a circuit board," Tony says.
"Sounds like you adopted a new excitable genius," Carol drawls at Rhodey.
"I sure hope we turn things around.”
"On science?"
It's only once they reach the dance floor that the loud music hits them, which is quality sound design. At first they mimic the Iantusians around them, who look thrilled that they joined, and it’s a blast. No one looks self-conscious; they’re just getting their hands in the air and partying as if they don't care. The bass line is excellent, and Tony lets the music and buzz take over, eyes closed as he sways to the rhythm. It's addictive in its own right and Tony has always loved dancing, but when he opens his eyes, he's bowled over by how Steve is watching him. There's no mistaking it: for a second there, before Steve realizes Tony is looking back, there’s pure want written all over his face. It makes Tony's heart thud, hard, and he's rearranging everything in his head once more.
There's a sustained murmur from the crowd.
"You said you went to 616?" Reed asks, intrigued. "I find it captivating how bad that one turned out. The death of Captain America sure-"
Tony rolls his eyes. He doesn't need someone to defend him or give Steve a shovel talk. "Come on."
“Thank you, friends. It is an honor to count you as Shield-Brothers.” Thor embraces his mother again before they leave Frigga’s chambers.
Tony rolls his eyes. "Oh, come on." He turns to Steve, exasperated. "I ran away instead of talking things out like an adult. I'd say that's not on you, Steve."
"Hey, look!" Johnny Storm has spotted them and excitedly shakes his brother-in-law's arm. He's grinning widely, and not for the first time it strikes Tony how much Johnny looks like a young Steve sometimes. "They've found us!"
"It's alright. It's the risk of the job; we all know that. Though admittedly I seem to almost die a lot." Afghanistan, the reactor theft and fight with Stane, the palladium poisoning, the Battle of New York, now this...
"He did," Nebula confirms. Tony can't see her face as she's behind his left shoulder, but there's pride in her tone.
"Yeah," Steve says. "Is that why she's your favorite?"
He hears Steve answer, but it's already distant as he drifts off.
, by the way. Captain Carol Danvers."
Tony laughs, his eyes crinkling in the most adorable way. "If you put it like that."
"Yes," Tony says. "DUM-E's vocabulary is limited, but they manage."
"You're going to be a handful, are you?" Tony murmurs, cupping Steve's cheek, but then grabbing his chin firmly. A reminder he's in charge here. Steve wasn't expecting it, and it's a thrill. "It's not a problem," Tony adds. "I like a challenge."
Leading the Avengers doesn't allow Steve to spend all of his time at the Tower. He tries to get back into a regular groove, the one he'd carved for himself at the Compound once Tony had left, but his heart isn't in it. He seeks to sublimate his boredom with training, asking more from himself and the team, pushing harder and stronger. When the others start grumbling about it being too extreme, Steve relents and takes to running several times a day. The rhythm of it clears his head a bit, though never for long. Spending so much time with Tony has been like a drug; he's in withdrawal and has to shake it to be functional.
It blows that Tony has so little information himself, but at least he has pictures. He almost laughs. He's already one of those people who want to show off photos of their kid to everyone, and he hasn't even met the little tyke yet. Since Chancellor Almar explicitly asked, he figures it's not cruel to offer to show them.
The boy beams as if seeing Tony is the best thing that has ever happened in his life. He walks to him, grabs his hand and starts shaking, huge brown eyes never leaving his face. The grip is surprisingly strong.
Over Tony's shoulder, Rhodes huffs and tries to read the papers scattered on the table.
"We'd all love to have a little chat with that asshole," Nat says, standing at his elbow. Tony hadn't even noticed her approaching. "But it's best I don't, because mine would involve knives."
"We fought him together?" If they at least were able to put aside their differences when the world was about to end...
"It's good to have you back, Cap."
Tony deliberated if he should start the battle in the Iron Man armor or not, but decided against it. If he needs to go binary, better not have the suit in the way. Anyway, for now he has to wait until the scout team reaches them.
"Then white it is."
"No, no you didn't. It's true the name doesn't seem to fit. It's the ginger root," Tony says, turning to grab it.
"God! You're killing me." Tony licks his lips, eyes searching Steve's face. "There's so much, if you're willing. I want your mouth, your fingers in me, your cock eventually—"
"Do you want me to call Fury, see if he knows anything?"
"Says the man who named a robot U and another DUM-E," Steve teases.
Whoa, that's harsh.
"Not bad, considering," Tony says. "I'm surprised I don't have a headache."
Tony whistles out slowly. Wow, it's been years since he's been so productive. And it's not because he has less work, though he's getting better at laughing in Fury's face when he asks for the impossible. He still has Stark Industries and the Avengers, as always, so the only difference is certainly the time freed up by not having a personal relationship. Which also comes with, amongst other perks, the freedom to sleep only four hours a night if he wants to, with no consequences other than his own exhaustion.
Tony feels the need to chime in. “Pardon me for saying this. I mean no disrespect, but for some people I can see the link with the animal form of their daemons more than for others.”
It's marvelous that these two men can even climb up a hill, in the snow, with what they went through.
“It’s not like we
That's all he needs. He doesn't care much for mechanics or specifics; he's sure it’ll be wonderful either way.
"That's him!" Carol says with a smile. "How's he doing?"
Tony winces as he looks at Talos. "Yikes. Sorry man."
Steve didn't realize he was nervous until that answer. He doesn't know if he's into kink yet—and if he'd want to explore it—and it's reassuring that it won't be a deal-breaker for Tony.
"Perfectly fine," Tony says, kissing the side of Steve's head. "As I said, I'm a Dom. And my thing, what makes me hot, is giving my Sub what they need. If it's pain, I can make it hurt just right, I promise. It doesn't have to be a lot, but if you're into harder stuff, I can provide, too."
"I will monitor the babies to ensure maximum comfort," FRIDAY says, with a sense of gravitas that has Steve smiling. He wouldn't be surprised if the kittens are now even more of a priority than the Avengers for Tony. Which Steve doesn't mind at all. It's adorable.
"Steve!"
"I'm Hildr," Thor's winged lioness says.
"Hi, Cap!" Tony asks. "I'm not waking you up, am I?"
"Exactly!" Tony agrees. "Plus, the notes were in another language. It was fascinating! Fury had partial blueprints too, and the tech was
“Yes, as far as we know.” Frigga touches the shoulder of the massive boar sitting next to her chair. “An intrinsic part of all of us, whether or not they manifest.”
Steve had approached slowly, as if Tony was about to get spooked, and he'd gently grabbed his hand.
"Tony, Tony, I'm so close, God!"
"Steve, there's a remote! On the far right! Get it instead, please!"
"What happened?" Steve asked.
Steve watches Callie being dragged, as previously described, like a fluffy mop on the pristine – thank God! – workshop floor. Meanwhile, Snowball is army-crawling like a goof. Heart full to bursting, Steve shakes his head.
Tony perks up. "Coffee would be great."
Tony said what he enjoys is giving his partner what they need, but Steve feels the same way. Isn't it what Tony called him earlier? A Service Top?
"Come here," Steve says, opening his arms.
"I'm not going anywhere," Steve says, jaw set.
"You can say that. But Nebula could also bring us back to Earth."
He's turning to leave when Tony catches Steve's arm. His face is soft and open, so beautiful, and Steve's heart thumps.
"Can you do it here?" Tony asks. "In case I fuck up?"
But—and that would prove to be an issue later—the fact was that Steve hadn't said anything. He hadn't let Tony know if the reason he made a move was just attraction and desire, or if there were feelings involved. What he wanted from this, from Tony. But frankly, Tony didn't care. He craved more. If he had the chance to have Steve, in any capacity, he'd be crazy to refuse (no matter that when Steve had had enough, Tony would certainly end with a broken heart). So he jumped right in with both feet.
"You like giving," Steve asks. "But is there something you crave for yourself?"
Steve feels like he watched the scene long enough, and that it's time to let his presence known. Once he's at the top of the slide, he cries out.
"Yes." Tony raises a hand and makes it charge up so it glows. This time Rhodey doesn't tense at all, just whistles.
"Right," Carol replies. "Listen up! You might have heard about us. We're the Avengers, from Terra. There are more of us, a whole team. We reversed the Decimation, and we killed Thanos and his army. No one else, not even the Krees, will mess with Terra. Is that clear?"
"I should leave, give you space," Steve says, already moving to get off the bed.
Steve fetches his half-empty bottle of whiskey in the same cupboard under which the bullet rolled earlier and hopes that Tony understands it's as an olive branch. That Steve is trying not to judge, assuming Tony noticed that Steve's testiness was because of his drinking. When he grabs two glasses and raises them in question, he's surprised when Tony shakes his head no.
Steve and Tony look at each other, surprised. This is news for them both, and clearly for their daemons too. Steve's ears are pinking in embarrassment, but he doesn't protest. Tony is perfectly aware he's been carrying a torch for the good captain for months now, and he suspects Cora knows it. But is Lilly being touchy-feely and affectionate with Tony in return a sign that Steve likes him back? It's an intriguing and exciting possibility.
"Well, he asked," Steve says while smiling in return. He's still thrilled that it came from Tony and that he didn't have to awkwardly ask to go back.
"Should I recolor the remaining tasks in order of importance?" Friday asks.
Tony must guess the mounting irritation in his tone because he looks up at Steve, now concerned.
Carol has joined the fray, not using her powers at the moment as far as Tony can see. The Avengers are back to back and fighting those who dare come for them. Kol has decided to vent his frustration onto Nebula, maybe thinking she helped Tony cheat, which won't end up well for him.
"I'll put it down for him," Tal says, extending his own card to the dealer.
"They deserved it." Not realizing Hydra was still active for seventy years is outrageous. "Did you save Bucky?"
On his right, Steve curses. Tony glances over, surprised to see that Steve hit a shoulder on a door frame. To be fair, the openings are smaller than usual, and Steve is pinkish as if embarrassed he forgot about that.
"I bet." Steve then turns serious. "Speaking of, how did you get stuck? Are you okay?"
After a small woofing noise, the wolf starts to approach, which makes Tony instinctively recoil in fear. It stops the wolf, who looks… hurt at the reaction, clear as day. His big head droops and he lies on the ground, looking at Tony with widened eyes. He shuffles forward a bit, slowly and with a whine, then once more when Tony stays immobile.
It's probably cruel and selfish, but he hopes that Steve misses him too.
Both Steve and Cora turned their heads to look at Tony, which was confusing until he realized Lilly was curled in a ball against his shoulder, sound asleep.
The low blow, that Steve hid this huge thing from him to protect his friend, hurts in an unexpected way. It's different from the grief; it ignites a blaze in Tony's chest that makes him jump out of bed and pace, furious. Fuck.
"Yes! Finally!" Tony exclaims, a grin splitting his face. How is it even fair to be so beautiful?
"Sure."
"Of course. Not the reveal I was aiming for, but I guess it's one way to do it."
"Really," Steve confirms. When the silence stretches (Tony's jaw isn't hanging open, but it's close), panic creeps in and Steve begins to backtrack. "It's fine if you're not interested--"
"It's fine." And it does sound like she’s fine. Thinking of it, she wouldn't have done the dance if she found it offensive.
"Yes. So you'd miss me, if I died," he teases and Tony rolls his eyes.
"The little black gremlin is more Stitch than Lilo, though," Tony says.
Thor laughs. "There is a gray area for legendary heroes," he says with a wink, before turning serious. "I am ashamed that they captured you in my home, without being detected."
"Excellent," Steve says as he starts kissing down Tony's chest. Tony mentioned wanting Steve's mouth earlier, which he can do (with great pleasure and enthusiasm, even if he's not as skilled as Tony).
"I'd love it!" Tony exclaims. "How about tomorrow night? At seven?" he asks Steve.
Steve tilts his head, puzzled. "You'd have wanted me to stay?"
"I think I've got the hang of it.”
Steve blinks, surprised. "I'm not sure—"
"I'm sure that you can tell me more than that."
When Kol reaches as if to take the glasses, Tony steps back, which has him smack into someone. The unmoving wall of muscles turns out to be Steve.
"She doesn't like it, huh?" Steve says.
Tony could protest that he's fine, but it would be a lie, which he avoids doing as much as possible with people he likes. But Steve is new on the scene, and if the file Nat has helped build is true, he always focused on healing spells and potions. It's a talent he inherited from his mother, and might have also used as an Army medic. Steve looks capable enough, his magic is strong, but bringing him along would be a liability as Tony wouldn't totally focus on the fight.
"Thanks Cap!" he quips, throwing his arms around Steve's torso and rubbing his jaw against Steve's affectionately.
"Oh yes," Carol replies, cackling.
"Yes," Steve says with enthusiasm.
"Please," Steve says, after swallowing what landed on his tongue. He's so, so close to orgasm too.
Steve's voice is a threatening rumble, which is pretty sexy. But the posturing is also unnecessary as Tony can take care of himself. He sharply pushes back so Steve gives him space and raises his hands up placatingly.
He's clearly touched by what is going on. Is it because he always wanted to marry? He adapted pretty well to the future, but at the core Steve holds traditional values. As far as Tony knows, he's never been in a serious relationship. Unless Barnes was one of them, which Tony still isn't certain about.
Unsurprisingly, Snowball responds, making everyone laugh. Being completely wet showcases even more how tiny she is, still.
"That's horrible." Tony can't help the shudder that goes through him and rubs at his sternum. That amount of torture for so long... He can't even imagine.
"Yeah. We went to you because we knew if someone could figure out time travel, it was Tony Stark." Steve offers him a small smile. "And you did, of course."
Tony hums but then has a sudden realization and perks up.
Okay, so maybe Steve won't stomp Bucky until he's pulp, after all. Steve takes him in a bone-crushing hug, laughing when Bucky squeaks.
It's a surprise when Steve sits on the sofa. The other Avengers never want to re-watch movies they've seen before. After a second of hesitation—he has the perfect amount of butter this time, he skipped lunch, and he'd planned on eating the entire bag—Tony extends his bowl to Steve.
Steve is about to ask what for when Tony winks and raises his right hand, now configured with a repulsor. Once it's lit up and used to propel them, it's not long that they are flying on the snow and rapidly gaining terrain on Peter and Morgan. When they double them, going incredibly fast, Steve sees Peter's jaw drop.
"From what I've heard of Earth, it seems similar to Iantus two centuries ago."
"Thanks, Tony! Will you come back tomorrow?" Tal looks hopeful, which is quite the ego boost.
This is for the best.
But he has to admit, as they make their way towards a beautiful golden city in the distance, that the place has style.
It's a low number in blue, though, so Tal doesn't know what he's talking about. The card is perfect for Kol, who is squirming in envy and will therefore leave Tony's hidden cards alone.
Tony debates whether he should push on with the idea and maybe approach the camp to speak to these soldiers who have been on his mind for months. But he doesn't have a good excuse to be here apart from being nosy. It's one thing to invite yourself to a table in a bar and pay a round, but quite another to pop out of the woods at night. They're having fun, but these men are fighters and might not react well to an intruder. Speaking of, it surprises Tony that no one is keeping watch, not even a little. They haven't spotted him, and Tony didn't hide his approach at all. Maybe he should say something after all, as they're not exactly being careful. On the other hand, they're grown men and have been fighting as an elite combat unit for years. They know how to take care of themselves. After hesitating another minute, Tony decides to return to the village and go to bed.
"Thanks for the help," Tony says. "Very appreciated."
"True, true." Steve licks at the tendon of Tony's neck, pleased when it makes Tony tilt his head to the side to grant better access. "It wouldn't be fair of me to make you wait too long."
"Anthony!"
It feels like years, but he finally sees the Bayside Cemetery, Crescent street, the house itself, and there's even light at a window upstairs. Tony's flight is uneven and inelegant, but he manages to land on the porch's roof next to the second-floor windows. He groans in pain once immobile, every muscle aching. He wants to lie here, face down, and close his eyes to rest, but he can't or he will die. Gathering the strength he has left, he crawls until he smashes his nose against the window plane.
"Iron Man, there's a fight going on here," Steve interjects. They're back to back, having fallen into that position instinctively to protect each other.
With all the heart-churning revelations of the last twenty minutes, Tony had almost forgotten about Steve's crush. It seems inconceivable now that they were kissing earlier. As Steve said, they had a huge rift for years... but they eventually made up. Tony doesn't want to experience deep resentment twice; it's already hard enough as it is. He needs to trust that he'd let go for a reason, and do that again as fast as possible. But he's not sure that he's ready to lock lips with the man again, as gorgeous as he is.
"I wanted—" Tony starts, then squeezes his bicep. "Thank you. For saving them, but also for helping out. I couldn't have done it without you."
It's 8 o'clock, but he's been out of bed for three hours already, including a complete thirty-mile run. Steve crashed right after they got home the previous afternoon, but he woke up ten hours later with his mind racing. Now that he's back, and they’ve earned several days of downtime to compensate for two weeks of absolute madness, how can he manage to go back to the Tower? Hopefully, he'll find an angle through this call, maybe even for today.
"They tell the Krees that the Skrulls are terrorists and coming for everything the Empire stands for, when in fact they just want to be left alone and live in peace. It's the Krees that persecute them."
"Yeah," Tony says proudly. "Hell, even if they don't come, this is pretty fantastic."
He didn't even try to say that he understood why Tony was angry. Not a peep about how he might care for Tony and not just for Barnes (did he, really?). No offer to send someone so Tony wouldn’t be alone. Steve just stood there, doing and saying nothing, and Tony might have hated that more than anything else.
"Don't diss my children's names," Tony replies seriously, "They fit then, and they still do now."
Oops. Tony winces. "Ah, sorry. Just us."
to count cards; it's that his brain does it naturally. Calculating the odds is as automatic as breathing, and he's really, really good at tracking who has what and the cards that are put aside. Or, in this game's case, tiles flipped over and moving between players.
"Made for me."
That's a good sign, isn't it? It means that his memories are just locked somewhere inside his head, ready to come out. He turns to Steve, hopeful, but finds him looking sad again. There’s a story there, surely, but it’ll need more investigating another time.
"Nice to see you too, Danvers." Carol links their arms together as they walk closer. Tony was aware that they knew each other, but they're friendlier than he'd thought. "Same for you, Tony," Fury adds as they reach him. He really looks happy about it, which is unexpected but welcome. "Glad to know that your death was as much a front as mine."
The blowjob is a little sloppy because of Steve's enthusiasm, but he gets nothing but compliments and revels in it. To avoid jerking off since Tony asked him not to, Steve grabs the back of Tony's thighs with two fistfuls of his perfectly cut dress pants. The contrast of Tony being fully dressed with just his cock out while Steve services him almost naked is hot as hell. It's that power play Tony was talking about, expressed differently, and yes, Steve likes it too. He might be a submissive, after all. This is a nice day for self-discoveries.
even if he doesn’t
And yet he keeps doing it. He does it again and again, because it’s his job, because it’s in his blood, and no matter how many times he loses, he keeps coming back, almost as if he is addicted.  He doesn’t know why. He feels obligated, but he doesn’t-- he feels like it’s right, but it isn’t.
Steve can wait.
It sounds… final.
He knows by the sounds of footsteps that the others are following him, and he leads them through the side stairs, just because they are faster and give him an excuse to move instead of going back to the elevator, and he tries to gain some sense of familiarity and security on the way.
This will not be the thing that takes him down. Tony Stark is a force beyond Steve’s comprehension and control, beyond
And suddenly, he realizes.

After some time, the exhaustion starts dragging them down – and they uncomfortably doze off occasionally, still half listening to the news, when Natasha finally decides she has had enough and turns it off, commanding them all to sleep.

And the world seems to go dead silent.

How can he know what he should do next, when he feels like he has only half of the information? Sometimes, not even that? How— Fuck, he sounds so
“Like that was the craziest thing I’ve ever done in a fight.” Natasha raises one eyebrow at him, cockily, before stopping and shaking her head mournfully. “Trust is difficult for people like me, Steve. For people like us.”
A pause.
“I wasn’t planning that far ahead.”
“This way.” Wong gestures to the side, and offers no other explanation for what he has just done, for what kind of door was that they just crossed, or
“So, what, they took it out and now it’s cool?”
Tony halts, confused.

would’ve listened, and they would’ve found a way out. Tony is a genius, Steve is a tactician. They could have come up with something.
Not quite. And Tony knows it.
Like a flash, echoes of this conversation reverberate within the many corners of his memory, still feeling fresh and tender despite how old some of these memories are, how long they’ve been living inside him and repeating over and over like a broken record, an issue they can never get past, a pattern that is destined to be a stone in their way for as long as Tony fails to meet a middle ground between his instincts, and Pepper’s request.

When Tony stops speaking, there’s only silence filling the air, silence and dust, and Tony feels incredibly exposed for some reason, almost as if his chest is open in a wound, and anything could come too close and hit him in a very bad way. He’s honestly almost surprised by the feeling – the

Maybe Steve is not the only one getting far more out of this than he should. Alright? Tony’s in this too. And Tony doesn’t want to leave.
Tony heaves as he climbs up, heaves as he dashes as quickly as he can towards the private areas, and it’s horrible, how quickly he falls out of breath, how much it hurts for him to exert such force, how numb his arm and chest feel even though his legs and stomach hurt like hell from his sudden movement.

If we wish to continue to our initiative while making use of public funds, we must oblige to a work contract. It is only logical.”

” Nebula points out, firmly.
There is a group of sharply dressed and heavily armed women waiting for them when they do, and T’Challa introduces them as the Dora Milaje, the royal guard, and the way they greet the man exudes respect and admiration, almost tangible in the air, unwavering trust and loyalty.
Much less, twenty-eight people who refuse to move.

(He wanted so badly to do this right.)

Nebula keeps wrapping him up, her gaze focused on Tony’s wound, avoiding his eyes.
Tony laughs, and grabs his hand. “No, we won’t. And I think it’s worth the risk. What’re some minor injuries between us anyway?”
“Stark.” Nebula warns, startled, and she extends a hand fast enough to grip him by the shoulder, pushing him back into his seated position, and the entire world goes white for a moment before it shifts back into place, except now it’s all rotating around him.
Not just because – not because he will not sit by and watch it happen. He won’t. He would

“I’m not sure about the details myself, Ms. Carter. Mr. Stark was a very wary person, even of those close to him, and this computer was the most safely guarded object in the mansion. It contains secrets that will most likely outlive us all. Only Mrs. Stark and myself had access to the computer, and even then, my access was extremely limited in comparison to Mrs. Stark’s.”
“He’s freaking out about Tony’s Reactor.” Natasha suddenly says, and her words echo through the walls the same way Steve can hear the glass shattering under his shield—
He had forgotten about Pepper for a moment. Longer than a moment. Almost an entire day.
Until then, the room is cold. He’s alone. She’s downstairs, finishing her report from Agent Carter, or Agent Ross, or maybe something else. He’s not sure. He was too keyed up, too rattled to fully grasp what she’d been doing when he finally saw her on the hangar after so many hours of simply… not thinking of her. Of long, excruciating moments of fearing she might’ve thought he didn’t care about her. He came up because she assured him it was fine, and he trusted her, he left her to finish her job because the trusted she’d come to him soon and they’d… talk, maybe, or just sleep. Just hold each other. He’d have taken anything. He simply trusted her, and waited, even if the room is cold, even if it’s too empty without her.
How was it possible that he had survived when so many people, when Bucky and Tony had been ripped from the Earth just like that. Why was he the one who survived every time? Why – Why.
But Tony has made his choice.
And the raccoon had been down here this whole time, and he didn’t know.
“Well, you didn’t say it, but you really think I can’t tell what you’re thinking when you have that look on your face?” He looks down, and she leans forward to she can still look in his eyes even though he’s trying to escape, undeterred. “Hey. Listen. I’m not blaming you. I’m not blaming anybody.”

The sound that tips him off is the sound of footsteps. Very close. But not close enough.
was the cause…
“I realized, after our encounter with the Sorcerer last night, that there might be something I failed to mention that could be helpful, or some stories that might be old tales for me, that actually hide important truths. It’s not unheard of, to have secrets hidden where everyone can see them, in our history.”
, that this isn’t true.
Clint stops and they all look at him, they look at him and Steve can’t stand it, he knows what they’re waiting for – and he wonders what exactly do they think they’ll do, what are they expecting him to do,
"OK," she murmured, almost like she was humoring them. But she sobered a little and directed her attention at Tony and said, "Tomorrow, why don't I show you a few things you can do to protect yourself? I know you know how to fight in your other body, but this one's a little different. I don't know if you've got the hang of certain things yet." She shrugged a little. "Might be good to know."
why he dreamt about him. The only question was why would his subconscious cast this fantasy as Howard Stark's
He stopped and looked at Tony like he was trying to figure if Tony understood what he was trying to say. When Tony just stared right back at him, he sighed a little and continued.
"What?"
"Yeah."
. I think it was just kind of implied."
"Hey, yeah," Barton said, completely ignoring him and presumably talking into the comm. "Someone want to send Thor out here? I need a pickup... Huh?... Mouthy as ever. He's fine."
He sighed and flopped a little to try and get comfortable, but it was kind of hard to do without a super soldier there to be spooned by, and he thought about going down to the lab to work on some stuff, but he was sure Natasha, at the least, had JARVIS spying on him and set to inform on him if he so much as glanced in the direction of the elevator.
He felt Tony's arms stiffen, and he pulled back some and went to check to see what was wrong when Tony mumbled out, "There's a lot of things Howard would never believe."
"I am sorry for all the pain and suffering the Goddess Esmeralda has caused you," Thor said, and Tony could tell he truly meant the words he spoke. "She did not mean it in that way, I assure you, though would smiting her in any way remedy your misfortune, t'would be something I should hesitate in no part to do on your behalf."
"Look, J, now is not the time to play games—"
," and the opening notes of a song began to flood the expanse of the lab. It was slow and maybe even a little sultry, and as the lyrics began, Tony said, "OK, this is where we start swaying to the rhythm."
in this position were he not somehow 'soul bonded' or whatever the fuck it was to Steve, but still, this wasn't the worst experience he'd ever undergone, and being with Steve made it so, so much more bearable than it might otherwise have been.
"No, it's not. It wasn't. It was a big deal. I'm sorry, Tony. I thought… Doesn't matter what I thought. The point is I hurt you, I know now that I hurt you, and I'm sorry. Nothing I ever say can make up for that. You asked me to marry you once. I said I would. And then I broke your heart because I thought letting you go was what you wanted. I thought you were just too afraid to be the bad guy."
if it made me look fat but if it was pulling just a little too tight on me. What does the bastard say?"
"Well, there's no time to lose!" he said and walked at such a brisk pace that Tony struggled to keep up.
"Last he knew, Siberia…with the other Winter Soldiers."
He'd killed his mother. He'd taken his mother away from him.
Tony grit his teeth and didn't even hide the fact that he was rolling his eyes, and the other three all glanced to the loser standing behind Tony rather than to Tony himself.
"Have to wait twenty-four hours unless you receive a Judicial Waiver."
"Dunno.  Never… Dunno."
"Is it?" Steve asked, an amused little smile on his face. His arm propped up on the back of the couch, he extended it so he could reach out and brush his fingers against Tony's hair.
"Unfortunately."
Steve smiled a little at him. "Well, I don't think we can blame Esmeralda for that."
Tony hummed and went up on his toes to nuzzle into Steve's neck. "Well, we wouldn't want Captain America getting fat now, would we?"
"Why?"
"All right," Steve said then motioned between himself and Tony. "We'll talk about it. Let you know what we decide. You had anyone asking for interviews?"
," he said, drawing out the word, "promise you won't get upset."
(That building wasn't even there any longer. He'd checked.)
Natasha nodded then noticed the hand he had on his back. "You OK there?"
"No, that's one employment decision I
Rhodey whistled low and said, "Jeez, now I feel bad for Aunt Millie."
Barton just made a face and motioned over him like it was obvious, and Tony raised an eyebrow and folded his arms and rested them between his breasts and his belly and said, "Excuse me?"
So he reached up and put a gentle hand over the back of Steve's head and brushed light fingertips over the short, soft hairs there and said, "We can put them out on display, if you'd like. Or we can keep them locked up tight somewhere that no one can get them. Totally up to you."
, ending with his fervent belief that she would be delighted at seeing Tony becoming a parent and becoming a grandparent herself.
"Hey, man, don't hold that against him."
"So, wait, let me get this straight. You and I

"Yeah, so? Are you saying he didn't deserve it?"
"She's not a
"That sounds like it doesn't taste very good."
"Would serve that bastard right," Tony said and nestled closer just as another wave of nausea hit him. He made a face at it and said, "But yeah, maybe not right now?"
Tony swallowed and nodded, and he stared down at the baby a moment before he said, "Evidently, there is a way to control the Winter Soldier."
"Well, you're wrong, but I don't expect you to see it. You probably thinks he looks at everyone the same way he looks at you."
"I don't see that there's any need to," he replied airily. "She never claimed that I did. It was her friends — if you want to call them that — putting those thoughts in her head." He stared pointedly at Steve at this and added, "And her
He turned just as Steve sucked in a breath to probably say something to that, and he followed Hill out into the press room, Rhodey, Pepper, Natasha, and Steve following behind. There was a crescendo of murmurs that began at one end of the crowded room and echoed into the other as the audience members recognized the woman now stepping up to the podium, Hill, Pepper, Rhodey, Natasha, and Steve standing just behind him, and several of them got up to try and get a better look. Several flashes went off, the red lights of TV cameras glowing in the back of the room, and Tony motioned for everyone to be seated and to be quiet, and once the murmurs had gone down, and with his friends and family gathered behind him, Tony cleared his throat and said, "Uh, so, I guess you're all wondering what I'm doing here. I'm sure you were expecting to get some news on Tony Stark after all these months, and here I am instead. But the thing is—"
"Well, clearly I know where you stand on the me-being-a-woman thing."
Steve didn't wander back into the kitchen until Tony had finished the fifth waffle and had also browned some sausage links he'd found for good measure. Steve carefully, and seemingly reluctantly, set Olivia back down in her carrier then turned it so that when he took his usual spot at the island, he could watch her while he ate and she slept. He sat, barely taking his eyes off the baby as he settled in, giving only the barest of glances to the food as he pulled two waffles and half-a-dozen sausage links onto his plate. He drenched everything in maple syrup, haphazardly drizzling the sticky substance from one side of his plate to the other, and Tony watched him a moment before he said, "You know, you can take your eyes off her for a moment. She's not going to go far."
"And it was very thoughtful of you. You're still more of a bother than a help in the kitchen though."
Maybe he didn't want to know.
Tony snorted a laugh. "Sure, honey," he said and reached up to pat Steve's cheek. "Of course they do."
," Barton said. He turned his attention to Tony. "You could do something radical and pick a completely different name."
take your shield?"
Steve shook his head some. "Not worried about mystery. Maybe some fellas don't want to know about that, but I want to… I don't want to be ignorant of what's happening to you."
He must have fallen asleep not long after he'd curled up on the couch because he awoke to the most glorious scent of broiled steak and potatoes, and when he opened his eyes and looked out at the vista beyond the plate glass, it was evident the sun was beginning to set. He yawned and sat up, and he rubbed at his belly a little then pushed himself up. How long had he been out for?
The clerk put his hands up like he thought Tony was going to continue to name names, but honestly, Tony had hit the end of his list. No one else knew about his…predicament — no one that could be of any use to them, anyway.
Thor frowned at him, sympathy adorning his face. "I'm sorry, my friend. I trust your mother would have purchased one for you if she had had the means."
"Fuck 'em."
"I'm not sure I deserve you," Steve said, but he didn't pull his hands away from Tony's.
too much, but not an asshole."

had sex and didn't even think about using a condom?"
"My info's correct. Is yours?"
It wasn't his form. He was, now and forever, physically female. He would take that over… It wasn't his child. He had inexplicably birth to a daughter, and he wouldn't trade his tiny bundle of fury for the world. Granted, that now meant he now owed that asshole Barton fifteen thousand dollars, but to a billionaire, that was a small price to pay. Well, in dollars. Pride was another matter entirely.
"Pep," he said and put a hand up to quiet her, "honestly, I'm
Look, he just
"She will," Tony said definitively then yawned.
"Whelp," he said, "that answers that question."
badly. Fucking figured. It was a ballad.
Barnes stared at him a moment before he yanked his shirt off and tossed it aside, and Tony paused a moment to look at the pink puckering at the shoulder joint where metal was fused to bone-and- flesh. Immediately, he was reminded of his own reactor scars, and, unthinkingly, he reached up and rubbed at his chest where the reactor had once sat, his hand meeting nothing but smooth flesh atop an unbroken sternum.
"Can I still go?"
He followed Steve into the bedroom, and that was where he saw two suitcases set by the foot of the king-size bed.

I find her sexy."
"You know there's caffeine in chocolate, right?"
He glanced back in time to see Bruce's face contort into a look of utter and abject confusion before he shook his head and said, "The flirting."
Thor chuckled, loud and hearty. "My friend, there truly is so much about the universe you have yet to learn."
— was the same, that of 'Iron Man,' but the Iron Man of that other world, so far as he had been told, wasn't just an 'Avenger' (it
Steve flipped to another page in the book. "I didn't know Clint was in the business of guessing about that sort of thing."
Tony panted a few times to catch his breath, lying back against the pillows as he looked up at the ceiling and put his arms out on either side of him to brace him before he fought to push himself to a sitting position again. He struggled a bit, and Steve finally let go of his ankle and helped him to sit upright once more.
She frowned now, like she wasn't sure if she should say what she was thinking. "What?" he finally asked because he didn't think she'd say anything unprodded.
it's a boy. Even though we
Tony rolled his eyes. "Yeah, how 'bout we cross that bridge when we get to it?"
What a waste of money.
"Thicker than I thought it would be."
Steve just stared at him a moment before he crowded into his space, backing him against the car, making him stumble a little and catch himself on the fender, and he made a weird, strained sound as his ass hit the automobile.
"Would it negate the effects of the serum that flows through your body? Not entirely. You won't suddenly turn back into the sickly, ninety-pound man that you were, but it's possible you may find in years to come that your strength and your health begin to, well, come more in line with that of what your kind normally experiences."
Yep, there it was.
"Not particularly."
cook."
"I, uh…" He cleared his throat. "You're not my first fella."
"Indeed," he said, sitting up a little more as he bristled in Tony's defense. "Our friend Anthony is quite the masterful chef in the kitchen, and these cookies are as delectable as any to be found in your numerous Midgardian sustenance shops."
He shook his head a little then turned and began the ascent, moving over to his bedroom once he'd hit the landing. He stepped in and carried Olivia over to the bassinette, and as he set her down, he murmured, "You know, one of these days, you're going to have to start sleeping in your own room."
"Yeah," Tony said, "if she thought this was a
"Yeah, well, corner him on the way to the john or something, not while I'm getting my dance."
, and they always will be. They follow each bonded from lifetime to lifetime. Each lifetime affords the bondeds to grow and strengthen their bonds. It is… I suppose the term for it is that is it fated to always be."
Barnes snorted a laugh at this.
"I don't know! I don't know why rich people do what they do! You saw that woman standing there with him."
She blinked at him. "Why would you think it was me?"
Really, he hadn't doubted Steve had been the sandwich-bringer for a second.
. I explained to them very calmly and rationally how stupid they were being with their insistence on us following bullshit 'traditions' that were outdated thirty years ago."
He swallowed. He could continue to lie, continue to keep up the charade and pretend, but the longer he did that, the more time he was wasting and the more lives were at stake. He hadn't scoped the house out. He didn't know if they were the only two there or not. He didn't even know where he was. He didn't have any shoes on, and that snow outside looked pretty damned real.
"I told you. Wore out my welcome with everyone."
Tony scoffed and rolled his eyes. Bruising? He'd be fucking lucky if it wasn't cracked.
This year, he wanted something kind of different. He wanted a party — but not like the parties of yesteryear. He wanted one with just his friends and his family, maybe something nice and simple like what they'd done for him and Steve when they'd gotten married.
He allowed himself to relax into Steve's embrace, and he put his arms around him and closed his eyes.
, Steve!" he cried. "The
Steve came with a choked groan, and Tony felt the warm flood of release filling him inside. Steve worked himself through the jerky and arrhythmic thrusts of the aftershocks until he couldn't hold himself up any longer, and after a few moments, he collapsed to the side of him, his softening cock slipping out of Tony with a rather unsexy squelch. Steve gasped and panted a few times, and Tony reached over and said, "Feel better, old man?"
"Slightly more presentable," the woman muttered then barked at her assistant to pick up a different swatch of color and material. As the younger woman did so, the designer sighed and muttered, "Miss Potts thinks I'm a
He closed his eyes and shook his head, and Tony must have sensed that Steve wasn't as happy- go-lucky as he'd been a moment before, as the next words out of his mouth came in the form of a very concerned, "Babe? You OK? You still with me?"
convinced it was just part of a long-running scheme.
He pulled the tablet away and sat back down in his chair, setting the tablet on the tabletop, and Steve frowned at him and said, "What's wrong?"
Tony melted into the touch, closing his eyes and relaxing as Steve nipped and sucked at the skin where his neck met his shoulder, one hand resting at his side while the other was firm against his back. Years ago, he might have stiffened at the very idea of belonging to someone — of being just a plaything or a possession — but it was different with Steve. It was always different with Steve. He didn't just feel like a possession with Steve or a plaything or someone to just build things or buy things or do things for Steve. Steve had a possessive streak a mile wide, sure, but Steve took very good care of those things that were his, the product, he was sure, of having grown up with scant few things to call his own. Steve was a slob with material things, but with the things that counted — the people and the family and friends he'd come to rely on these past couple years — Steve was nothing if not careful with them, understanding them to be fragile and able to be taken away from him in the blink of an eye. Steve did not put his faith or his trust in people easily — especially not after that whole thing with Hydra and the government — but Tony knew that once he did, it was very difficult to break that. Steve was loyal and dependable, and sure, perhaps a little too stubborn or self-righteous for his own good, but it was a stubbornness and a self- righteousness that Tony knew he could live with.
"Wait," Tony said and jerked a thumb at Rhodey, "even the part-time Avenger knows?"
"Yep," Tony said, hoping to god Steve wouldn't dwell on it for too long. God, he did not want to get into his past dealings with Ty tonight. That was definitely not a sort-of-honeymoon conversation to have.
"Talking," Steve said, some of the strength going out of his voice and being replaced by what sounded like slight embarrassment.
you, Thor! They know how to swim! They just wanted you to 'rescue' them!"
"That's not an answer."
He shrugged. "I don't know. We're kind of in uncharted territory here. I'm not insulted, if that's what you're worried about. I mean, that…mind-melting orgasm aside — seriously, that was, you have no idea — it's nice to hear that the man I want to spend the rest of my life with still finds me attractive in the form I plan to spend the rest of my life in."
"You promise?" He turned to Steve. "You heard that, right?" He turned the group. "You all heard that? If I continue to be an unrepentant ass, you'll stop making yourselves at home here?"
your problem?" Steve mused and reached out to snake an arm around his shoulders. Tony let him, and he let him use that arm to pull him close so as to smack a kiss against his forehead. "It is…a
"Nat's Pepper Potts's PA, remember?" Bucky said then turned to her. "OK, 'fess up. What sort of dirt did you get?"
Steve sighed and dropped his head once more before he looked back up at Tony again and said, "Do you
Tony, mature person that he was, nearly fell off the bed laughing as Steve cried out a surprised, "Holy
," Steve told him over the comm line, a little too smug about it, to be honest.
"You will more than understand in due time," she said, and Steve moved to step in between them as she reached out to touch his face again.
He loved them. He could honestly say he loved them and could truly, honestly, not imagine having to go back to a time when he didn't know them, when he didn't realize what he was actually missing from life. A time when, as a very wise man had once said, he had everything and nothing. He didn't want to go back to that. He didn't ever want to lose this.
," the witch said. "You wish him to have an heir, there is no other way. Not so long as the Chancellor has breath in his body and the two remain united as one."
The High Chancellor's father, Joseph, had also been a knight of the King's army, but his mother had been of common birth. His father died before he was born, and his mother died early in his childhood, and the King had taken the young, penniless orphan under his wing. He'd had him educated and trained in battle, and Steven had proven himself to be a quick and intelligent young man as well as a formidable leader. By nineteen, he was leading the King's army, six-foot-two with dark blonde hair and eyes that changed from blue to green to grey depending on how the light hit them. A favorite of the young ladies at court, he was said to have been propositioned by several well-meaning noblemen eager to marry off their daughters to such a worthy 'catch' but had turned them all down because he was looking for 'love' not 'alliances.' And Steven, being the King's favorite, could do so. Howard had long wished he'd had a daughter of his own to marry off to his favorite knight, but he respected Steven's wishes to seek out love rather than forge a political alliance that would continue to help stabilize the kingdom. The birth of his own son had put to rest any wishes he may have had of leaving his kingdom to his favorite knight, but there was no doubt in the mind of any man on the King's Council that Steven, Earl of Brooklynd (a present from Howard on his eighteenth birthday), was conspiring to take what he felt was rightfully his.
Oh, god. What did
For a brief moment, he wondered if he was some perverse form of a kept man.
"I don't know why it's not..." he said, the words sounding as clouded as he was sure Tony's mind was right now, and deciding they didn't have time for that, he switched his comm back on again then ordered JARVIS to fly the Iron Man armor back to the Tower.
"I'm not short!"
"You have then?"
"Fine," he said and went over to the stairs. He stopped at the bottom and yawned again then rubbed his abdomen and added, "I'm going to bed." He pointed at them. "No talking about me while I'm gone."
know what to tell you. That's why I asked you. Haven't you been listening?"
But Steve just grabbed his tuxedo pants from the bed, and as he shook them out and went to step into them, he went a little serious and said, "You know, there's really no going back after this. Everyone's going to know. Not just people at an art gallery or Twitter. They're going to have camera crews there and everything."
"Uh, Thor?"
"Well," Tony said, hoping to put the off-topic bullshit to an end, "that was an enormous waste of time."
could pass for Steve Rogers." He then pointed at Tony. "
"Yeah," he said, the word sounding sad and wistful to his own ear. Hopefully, Tony didn't notice. "Yeah, sure." And then, because he was a glutton for punishment. "Now?"
"I think I missed something here," Sam said, and Barnes and Barton nodded their agreement.
, you can carry even more stuff that you need but you don't ever have on you because you don't have any way of carrying it. I was going to make man bags a thing when I got changed back, but since that's evidently not happening, you guys have to pick up the slack for me." He glanced to Steve and said, "Seriously, Captain America goes around town with a man bag? Sales would go through the roof."
She groaned and rolled her eyes once more. "My goodness," she muttered with a shake of her head before she looked pointedly at him. "Did you feel yourself age before you were turned into the peak of human perfection?"

"'m fine," Steve muttered again and, unsurprisingly, tried to sit up.
Steve shrugged and cut into his toast. "Dunno. More sex?" he said, his tone lilting upward into a hopeful question on the last syllable.
"Yeah, I heard that," Bucky said with a roll of his eyes. "Who the hell are Pepper and Happy?"
"Don't bother. Don't really care."
"I'm sure they have him," Natasha said. "I don't think they put him on a boat and set it on fire. They know better than that." And with a pointed look at him, she added, "They know if they did anything like that, they'd never hear the end of it from certain people."

Bruce frowned at her. "You don't call him 'Daddy'?"
Because this Tony was

Stark choked out a desperate sound at that, his face scrunching some in need and want, and Steve kept hold of his chin as he used his other hand to unbutton and unzip his uniform pants, and he reached in to free his—
he considered himself. Physically, he was a woman, yes, but inside? What he considered himself?
"I'm not sure if it was better or worse when they thought I just was a gold-digging whore," Tony said one morning a few days after the press conference, after Steve and the other Avengers, half-dead from lack of food and lack of sleep, had just returned from a mission. As they gathered in the kitchen looking all shades of exhausted, leaning on each other and the island for support, Tony held his tablet in his hand as he read over some asshole political commentator's editorial on just how much
Tony took her into his arms, checking her over and looking for bumps or bruises or anything that would—
Barnes nodded then said, "Well, you're Steve's, and for all intents and purposes, that makes us family."
"OK, and what am I supposed to do about that?" He motioned over himself. "Can I really go to the Board looking like this and say, yeah, I'm still alive. I'm a

Ella laughed and clutched a hand at her chest. "Oh, my goodness," she said, blushing, "never in my wildest dreams did I ever think I'd get a 'thank you' from Captain America of all people!"
Bruce took the photo from Barton, and he inspected it just like he had the other two and again gave his assessment.
He missed some of what was said after that, but he didn't miss the next line from Carrie or…what was her name again?
"What?" Tony asked, not liking the look.
"Then do it! Damn the press and whatever they say about us. We know the truth. Who cares what they think?"
He grabbed a slice of toast and spread some butter on it. "Yeah, but Steve Rogers
"Well, that, too, but the 'knocked up' part. Do you have to— Can't you just say 'pregnant'? Or 'expecting' or—"
"Not in a

He jumped up and snatched his phone, leaving the browser open to the page about Tony Stark and his bid for matrimony. Whatever Tony was up to, it was not going to end with the cracks in his heart being repaired. Not after all this time.

They do not sleep.
It’s… It’s incredible. It is absolutely breathtaking. It’s sleek and tight, but in all the right ways, the kind of fit that would make him agile without restraining his movements. He knows jus by looking at it, because Steve has the terrible habit of not checking the sizing of his clothes when he buys them, and he always has clothes that are too small or too tight for his now too-large body. So he knows about fitting. The suit is darker, much more minimalistic, no longer cluttered with pockets and straps and lines, perfect for stealth, discreet enough that he could wear it under his civilian clothes and no one would ever know.
“Yeah, me neither.” Bruce frowns, and steps forward in a way that Tony can’t ignore him unless he turns his back completely to Rhodey and him, to face the table where the Gauntlet is. “What

“No, I get it.” Bruce reassures after a beat, even if his tone is still dripping in sadness. “Short-term, it makes more sense to prioritize rescue missions. I get it, I do. It’s just… I looked through some old papers.” He shivers. “And it doesn’t look good, Tony. It’s bad.”
Tony watches, frozen in his place, eyes wild and mouth forced shut like he’s trying to break his own jaw with the force which he presses his teeth together, lips tight, trying to hold back any pitiful sounds that might threaten to escape in a sobbing breath. His head pounds with a terribly familiar sensation of holding back tears when he looks closer, and realizes that even in the fast-paced rewind FRIDAY is making, he can make out the flowy movement of Strange’s sentient cape, and the gray, bulky blur he sees on the corner when the camera shifts is most definitely Drax.
Tony’s eyebrows raise almost all the way to his hairline and he blinks, confusedly. “At all?”
As the weeks pass, the others slowly start coming in too. Bruce comes back after a short trip to Calcutta to grab a few of his belongings and moves into the Tower with an ease that is heartwarming to see. Thor drops by to see his quarters, but says he’s gonna be on and off for a while, because there’s a girl he’s seeing in New Mexico and he wants to spend more time with her now he’s down here.

“We’ll get them back.” Tony tells her, tells them, tells himself.
“Absolutely not.” Tony insists. “I refuse to eat the cheap imitation when I can have the best Italian in the country whenever I want. C’mon. We’ll take the Quinjet.”

She shrugged and leaned forward onto the tabletop again. "Yeah, 'ventally." She gasped and sat back up on her knees again like she'd remember something important. "That's right! You weren't there! That's when Papa said you were in—" And she stopped a moment like she was trying to make sure she got the exact wording her papa had used. "—a piece 'f shit rat-hole on th' Ganges."
"Nothing," Natasha replied. "Let him cool off. He's not trying to hurt you. He thinks he's doing the right thing. And you know how he gets when he thinks he's doing the right thing."

just ridiculously hormonal. He didn't really know, but what he did know was that he just… He just wanted his friends to care that it was his birthday, that's all.
"Just kissed?" he asked because that was about the only thing he could wrap his mind around at the moment.
The table was fucking uncomfortable, and after ensuring that the placenta had been delivered intact, his uterus was contracting the way it should, and he had been sutured up properly, Bruce was able to snag a gurney from somewhere. He didn't say where, but he did make Barnes and Natasha promise to say that, if asked by some of the hospital staff floating around, that they had no idea where the bed had gone. The gurney wasn't all that more comfortable than the table had been, but it did allow him to relax a little more, and it allowed him to more easily cradle his new daughter in his arms, one that hadn't let go of his nipple from the moment she'd latched onto it.
"Yeah, that sounds like Steve." He paused and considered Tony a moment then said, "I'm not really surprised Steve got himself mixed up with a fella that's kind of a woman, too, for reasons I still don't really understand, but I— I'm glad Steve found you. I'm glad he's got you. You seem— You actually seen like you actually love him and, honestly, that's all I ever wanted for him. Was never sure if he'd get it." He shrugged. "Shame the poor bastard had to wait seventy years for it, but better late than never, right?"
The unease vanished and was replaced by annoyance. "What? Of course you do."
"I feel soaked and gross. Yeah, a shower. You have one of those here, don't you?"
But that didn't mean he wanted to
"I don't eat
"The Iron Man faceplate. Kind of our way of being ridiculously possessive of each other. Nat thinks we have a problem. Wilson thinks it might be unhealthy. Banner just sighs a lot over it. Barton calls us 'Stony' like he thinks he's the cleverest son-of-a-bitch ever to walk the face of the earth. Rhodey thinks you're either an idiot or a saint. Pepper and the One-Armed bastard, strangely enough, seem to be the only people that don't give us any grief over our life choices.
"Oh," he said and tried to hide his disappointment. It sounded kind of interesting, actually, and he kind of wanted to see what it really looked like. "So, there's more of us?"
Tony shrugged, but Steve said, "A little. Yeah."
Tony grinned at the little dark red onesie with 'Future MIT Grad' printed on it, and Steve made a face and said quietly, "What if... What if she doesn't want to go to MIT?"
The clerk took in the exchange and remained quiet a moment before he said, "I remember that day, a couple years ago, when that alien wormhole opened up and those alien creatures were destroying Midtown. Nothing's been the same since that day. So many crazy things out in the world anymore. Guess I can't really be surprised that something like

fifteen minutes of argument from you. Instead, you just tell me 'fine' like you don't care."
Steve's voice cut out, and Tony was left only with the hum of the road noise and the quiet rumble of acceleration. And the heavy silence of JARVIS's disapproval, he was certain, but whatever because fuck.
Tony just paused, mid-sip of coffee, and said, "Yeah, sure, whatever. Just tell me how many tickets you need, Mad Max."

Unfortunately, not every fussy night was cured with a slurp of milk, and Steve — darling, wonderful Steve — was the one to get up and walk the floor with her, doing what he could to soothe her and get her back to sleep. Tony wasn't too proud to admit that he didn't feel bad in the least for falling back asleep when Steve would work his way out of the bedroom and down the stairs. Sleep was so hard to get nowadays that he relished any chance he had to catch a few winks, even if it was at the expense of his husband's sleep. He just assumed Steve only walked the penthouse floor with her until the one time he said, "I don't think DUM-E quite knows what to make of her."

"You will. I promise."
He wasn't sure how long he was at it before he fell asleep, and, of course, he fell asleep bent over the worktable, cheek pressed against the cool metal. And he wasn't even aware that he had fallen asleep until he was awoken the next morning by a chipper four-year-old that remembered that she had been promised waffles.
"What—? You—? But they said—"
"Yeah."
do you think the Winter Soldier was, Steve?"
"I know."
Tony just squeezed his hand again, and that was when a door opened and a nurse stepped out and said, "Natasha Carbonell?"
too stupid to even think of fucking
Bruce came out of the bathroom, wiping his hands on a towel as he did so, and Barnes disappeared out the door and went over to the elevator. "You didn't really think we'd let you bring a baby into this world with nothing to even dress her in, did you?"
"Always," Steve said without hesitation, and Tony just hummed and said, "Yeah, I'm not so sure about that, given that
Tony stopped short and frowned at him, and Steve smiled a bit sheepishly.
"Believe it or not, it helps the uterus contract," Bruce said as Barnes and Natasha draped a thin, white sheet over his lower half to give him a little bit of warmth. He'd begun to shiver and shake not long after delivering, but Bruce had assured him — and he was pretty sure he remembered reading somewhere — that it was perfectly normal. "I take it you plan on breastfeeding her?"
"Oh, well— Steven, if you would be so kind as to procure that delicious tomato condiment you Midgardians enjoy so much?"
" he snapped as though Bruce had just levied the highest of insults upon him. "What the hell does that mean?"
"Will it make you feel better if I tell you maybe all the sex helped?"
"How is that even possible? That I'm that old but look like this?"
Tony stroked his hair again. "Don't mention it. We can all help. I mean, hell, I've been salivating from the moment I met him to get my hands on that arm."
"I mean, they're not real, right? It's just a propaganda gag?"
Steve just shook his head and muttered something under his breath, and Tony glared and said, "I'm sorry,
— his imagined fantasy more like) correctly, the 5'9" was a bit generous.
But Steve just glanced around and muttered, "Great. What the hell is he doing here?"
"How little?"
To pump him full of his...his... What did Clint say they called it now? Jizz?
Bruce just turned and sighed when he saw Tony advancing on him, tablet in his hand and what he could only assume was a look of abject horror on his face. He watched as Bruce directed some medical personnel to take a gurney over to another part of the room then said, "Don't tell me. You
"Anyway, Bruce, thank you so much for coming," she said, taking hold of his hands as though she was saying her 'goodbyes' to him. "I do hope you'll pass the good word along."
Barton choked on the remains of the juice, the excess dribbling down the sides of his mouth and chin, and he pulled the glass away and coughed a few times then grumbled, "Thought it tasted a little funny," as he grabbed a napkin to wipe up the mess with.
voice back in his throat where it belonged. "Honestly? I feel… I feel…"
He yelled at JARVIS to change the station before the movie ended. He knew these particular movies being played at this precise moment was just a coincidence, but it was a hell of a coincidence considering. As, he was sure, was the fact that the channel JARVIS changed it to was showing
The woman just hummed some more, and she reached out to brush her fingers at some tendrils of hair that had fallen out of his ponytail and said, "You do make for a very pretty woman, don't you, Mr. Stark? Or is it
Tony didn't even have the strength or the desire to curse him out. He just pressed he heels of his palms into his eyes and wondered once again why something so 'natural' was so goddamned painful.
"I'm nervous."
"Iron Eyes Cody!" Barton said like he'd just remembered something, and Wilson nodded at him and said, "Yeah, that's right!"
"Someday, you're going to wish you never said those words. But, no, this is
being traditional and conventional. Wedding. Tomorrow. Downtown.
"Steve, don't—don't do anything stupid, all right? Don't do anything… Just be careful. Those fuckers play dirty."
"Just didn't think about it. I said, you two are old and married and…pregnant. The rest of us are single and definitely
(Bucky, of course, already had, and was seemingly actually a little upset that he wasn't even considered a possibility for caregiver in the event of his and Tony's death; Peggy he had every intention of introducing her to come the spring when she was a little older and better suited to traveling.)
"It's a GE ultrasound machine," Bruce said, earning a dismissive scoff of, "
"Wait, so
"Oh, shut up! You never know! They might just be friends."
Steve sat up straighter at that if it was even possible. "It's not a super soldier."
"But I think my concern here is…do you prefer me this way?"
The man — Wilson — laughed and clapped a hand against his back and said, "Some crazy-ass family," then pulled away and turned to Steve. He pulled him in for a one-armed hug — presumably because Steve had Olivia in his arms, so it was hard to do the full-hug as he had with Tony — and Steve made some unsure utterance and put a hesitant arm around him, and Wilson frowned at him a moment and looked at Tony.
"You can't be that bored that watching me is that interesting."
and I are a little, ah, confused by what's going on here, and, uh, you fell and hit your head a little bit, so would you mind if I asked you a couple questions to make sure you're OK?"
"Yeah." He shrugged. "Anyway, it…didn't take long for it to get around to the other girls in the chorus line, and—"
Tony shrugged and decided to take it for the ass-backwards compliment it was. "He's good at what he does."
"'m fine, Brucie," he mumbled and went to close his eyes until he realized there was a weighty lump in his arms. He looked down at his little newborn, and he frowned when he realized he couldn't very well fall asleep with her in his arms, no matter how much he wanted to.
But, not wanting to dwell on that, he let it slide and instead, abruptly changed the subject, asking Pepper if she knew of any designers that had any experience with maternity evening gowns. She seemed startled by the change but still was able to get control of herself enough to say that she did, and two days later, two people in tailored and expensive wear appeared at the Tower to take measurements. Not particularly enthused about letting them into the penthouse — or any of the Avengers' personal spaces — Tony instead met them in a lower floor conference room and stood there in his underwear (which he was
