to talk. But Tony’s tired, miserable, and pathetically in love with someone who doesn’t love him back. And if this is going to be the first and last time Tony could have Steve Rogers like this, he’s going to savor it.
Tony would’ve buried his face in his hands and let out the loudest scream, let out a stream of curses. Maybe even thrust his fists against Steve’s broad chest. But thanks to Miles and Kamala, his armor is a goner.
Steve’s nowhere in sight when Tony returns to their booth. He’s outside, leaning against the wall with his arms crossed. His eyelids are shut, his head tilted upwards as a light breeze sweeps his hair back.
“Come back to me,” Tony murmurs when he’s calmer. “Please. Just— I can’t. I need you, Steve. I can’t—”
Tony snorts. “No offense but you were asleep. You wouldn’t have known even if an asteroid hit the satellite.”
“I’m actually not surprised,” Tony says, taking another swig from his whiskey glass. “This place seems right up Thor’s alley. I mean, it isn’t every day an Asgardian god pops into your bar. You gotta have to commemorate the moment somehow.”
Tony’s breath catches at the reverence in Steve’s tone. “Figured you’ll like that kind of sappy thing.”
Tony does a double-take. “Hold up. Is that the same week you couldn’t come to class and missed midterms?”
Sometimes, they’d head to a bar and drink until they’re pink in the face. Other times, they’d go to a diner or a hole-in-a-wall. Both times, they’d talk about everything and nothing before Steve would fight him for the bill and offer to join him on his walk to nowhere.
“One day,” Steve says for the millionth time whenever Tony asks and all Tony could do is try again another day.
“As much as we would all love to be regaled by your tale, Thor, I think ‘tis best Anthony and I take our leave.” She grins. “Come, Man of Iron! I have much to show you. Do not fret. I will return your comrade soon.”
Steve couldn’t help but chuckle at that. “Too well.” He pauses, trying to piece his thoughts together. “But why... Why him?”
It’s one thing to wake up seventy years into the future but another five more? Steve’s starting to wonder if he’s always meant to be propelled forward in time, meant to be a nomad, a traveler. Destined to be a Man Out of Time.
“Well, I figured it’d be rude of me to forego going this year,” Steve replies ruefully. “I’d be a terrible boyfriend if I didn’t go.”
Tony waves a hand in dismissal before cupping Steve’s jaw. He couldn’t help but lean into the touch, basking in Tony’s touch, Tony’s warmth.
Clint lets out a low whistle as they watch the spaceship disappear into the horizon. “Damn. If I were Tony, I’d never come back from Asgard.”
“I don’t need super soldier memory to remember it,” Steve replies, sounding oddly petulant and mournful at the same time. Then again, Steve has been petulant and mournful since the first moment Miles pulled him out of his box. Acting like Tony’s biggest enemy and regret simultaneously.
Tony nods. “Howard always thought music was a waste, especially on someone like me. Which is funny considering how much he resented me for being smarter than him.”
Carol rolls her eyes, elbowing Tony’s side. Steve fights off the small glimpse of annoyance ignited in him.
Tony imagines a young and tiny Steve seated in front of a dusty piano, his eyebrows knitted together as he stabs his fingers onto the keys. A faceless woman hovers over him, teaching with a kind murmur. “She sounded nice.”
“Uh, yeah. Clint ordered Indian for everyone but blueberry pie, you know. Craving it. And I figured you’d want to tell along since you love pie too.” Tony frowns. “Unless you want to invite someone else—”
Tony had let out a frustrated sigh, his jaw clenching. “Whatever. They’re idiots. You’ll find the right one soon enough. I mean, you’re the whole package. Blue eyes, heart of gold, hair of gold—”
“I was, uh…” Tony clears his throat again, tugging at the collar of his T-shirt. It’s one of the many band T-shirts Tony seems to adore. They’re mostly of classic rock bands and grease-stained. Today's Band of the Day is Coldplay. Surprisingly, there's not a single grease stain in sight. “I was wondering if you could help me pick something.”
“Well, I guess it’s better than Johnny’s wish,” Tony mutters, who somehow thought it’d be a wonderful idea to write, ‘Congrats on the sex!’ in flaming letters. Tony doesn’t think he’ll ever live that down.
Steve feels his heart hammering in his chest, knowing deep fucking down that he is right. That Howard is so fucking right.
Steve just breaks into laughter and takes him around, rambling about each piece in embarrassment and love. Tony lets him. It feels like old times.
“Because you’re going out with Tony,” She shoves a couple of shirts into his chest. “Here. Try these on.”
Steve frowns, his eyes roaming, searching. Probably for a lie. Tony lets him. He has nothing else to hide.
“This isn’t about quitting,” Steve snaps. “This is about common decency. I’m not going to come between their relationship just because of—of…”
Steve takes a long sip from his coffee, fighting off a wince at the scalding liquid. “Oh. Uh… He hasn’t mentioned you before.”
“I brought you here to ask you something. I thought it’d be symbolic. And rom—” Tony cuts himself off, clearing his throat. He jumps to his feet, Steve following suit. “I mean, uh… God, I had this whole speech planned out in my head. It’s supposed to be smooth and well-constructed. Like I even asked Rhodey to help and Carol—”
He doesn’t know which of them moves first but suddenly Tony’s pressed against the door and Steve’s kissing the life out of him and he’s fumbling with his key and they fall onto the floor with their lips and bodies still pressed onto each other, as if eager to meld their souls into one.
Endgame Steve, with his big blue eyes and blond hair slicked back, just quirks his lips to one side, his eyes twinkling. “Sorry.”
Besides, what’s the point? Some wacky shit would happen or someone else would drag him into another conversation. It’s like a sign from the universe telling him that Steve and Tony aren't meant to be.
But since Steve’s scrawny and little, he has to fight off the urge to punch Howard in the face and not to show his heart breaking in two.
The stranger hums, handing him a business card. “You know. I got an exhibition coming up in a few months. Think your work would be perfect for it.”
Besides, Asgard’s filled with magic. Tony hates magic. He wouldn’t move to Asgard and live among magic. He wouldn’t.
Tony’s played for so many people before – his family, board members and strangers when he’s drunk out of his mind, Rhodey and Pepper when their schedules align. He’s always played alone though, never with another. He always meant for his mother to be his first and last partner.
By a second. But it’s a win, nonetheless. He never doubted he’d lose for a second. Definitely not when he narrowly squeezes his way through the Grand Canyon or almost got lost in thick clouds.
Tony snorts, shaking his head fondly as he lifts his mug to his lips. “It was great. We had a wonderful time. We had dinner in the capital and then went dancing. Jesus, the dip she made—”
All his life he’s been told he could never be enough to be like Steve. What makes him think he could even compete to be enough
Steve’s lips are soft and warm against him. Tony can’t remember the last time he’s felt this good, this thrilled, this warm.
Tony shoots her a half-hearted scowl as he takes Steve’s hand, letting him guide him down to the dance floor. There's something empowering about holding his boyfriend's hand in an ocean of elite bigots.
Stark Industries’ Public Relations team insists they hold press conferences and interviews to satiate the public and the media. Tony reluctantly agrees.
For the first time tonight, Tony finally takes Steve in openly. For the first time tonight, Steve lets him.
Steve being bisexual is old news, given how he came out to the press after being bombarded with questions about Tony’s sexuality back in the early days. But the fact that
Tony’s waiting for him in his penthouse, conversing with Natasha and Bruce. The three of them swerve their heads in his direction as he approaches.
“Of course I’m here. Where there’s quality art, I’m there.” Ty frowns, giving Steve’s painting a once-over. “Though I’m having second thoughts about that. This is ugly. Who the hell—”
Yup, this is bad. So very bad. He can’t afford to be tempted. Not now. Not when Hammer’s slimy arm is on him. Not when Hammer’s pungent breath is harsh on his cheek. Not when all Tony wants to do is
eyes making him catch his breath. It’s moments like these that Tony wonders about the what-ifs, on the possibilities, on the many ways he could tell this man the countless times he’s fallen.
Tony groans, burying his face in Steve’s neck. Steve runs his hand down Tony’s side, as if to comfort him. “You’re telling me that this whole thing was unnecessary?”
Steve’s Captain America and he doesn’t even get a smidgen of respect. What the hell is up with that?
Tony clasps his hands together, jabbing his finger at Steve. “Ah ha! I knew you’re into Bucky! There’s no way—”
Steve perks up at the question. He does it a lot whenever Tony tries to make conversation with him, which is hardly ever. “What’s weird?”
Tony isn’t much for talking. He ducks his head a lot, fiddles with his pencils, and flinches at any sudden movement. A lot of kids find him weird. Steve thinks he’s just shy.
He hopes it’s enough to fool her. But judging by the number of cookies she ends up baking and the movies she queues up, it’s not.
Sometimes, his friends forget. They slip his name in conversations. The places he’s been to. The things he’s been up to. How happy they make each other.
Natasha arches an eyebrow, peering over her magazine. “Did something happen between the three of you?”
A stranger – tall, blond, and beautiful – sits next to him, dressed in a button-down and khakis with the softest smile he's ever laid his eyes upon.
Tonight, there seems to be less bustle around them. Vehicles roam at a snail’s pace instead of a standstill. People don’t move in compact crowds. Tony can hear himself breathe. It’s a good night.
Steve steels himself, taking in a deep breath. It’s fine. He’ll get over it. He’s always pegged Tony as unattainable, anyway. As long as Tony’s happy, Steve’s happy.
A knock on his door interrupts Steve’s train of thought. In a flurry of panic, he shoves the ring back in the drawer and dashes over to the door.
Everyone’s in disbelief at that (Steve has a feeling Natasha knows, judging by her smirk) but quickly acquiesces when Bruce’s neck turns into a sickly shade of green.
Tony hums as he snakes his hands around Steve’s neck. “This bloodsucker is also in the mood to suck something else.”
A holographic trash can pops up in front of him. Steve crumples the virtual note into a ball and tosses it inside, deleting it.
“As friends,” Tony says. He shrugs his shoulders. “Apparently our relationship is best left platonic.”
“That’s not what I meant. You are a team player. Don’t you—” Steve heaves a sigh. “I’m intruding. The least I could do is listen.”
He drops his head onto Tony’s bare shoulder, nuzzling the crook of Tony’s neck. “And then I saw you. Met you as Cap. And I know me. I know the way I act around you. I could’ve given myself away if I acted the way I did.”
Tony snorts. “I wasn’t crying to Inception. I’m pretty sure the rest of the gang said all that to make you cave in. Or jealous. Maybe jealous.” He frowns. “I just realized that you’re a crazy jealous bastard when you want to be.”
Tony’s eyelids flutter, his expression still in disbelief. “I— I must be going deaf because it sounded like you just told me you’re in love with me. Which can’t be right because—”
“I can do fun,” Steve mutters to himself as he towels his damp hair, heading for the bedroom door. “I can be fun. I can—”
“I’m not trying to stop you from—from falling in love,” Steve says, the words heavy on his tongue. “I just— Well, I— You know—”
Tony’s already dressed down and flipping through holograms when Steve drops into the workshop with a couple of mugs of hot vanilla.
Of course. Of course, he knows. Even if he is a stranger, he’s a Steve Rogers. He wouldn’t be Steve Rogers if he isn’t perceptive.
Steve clenches his jaw the whole time. Tony could barely hear his teeth grinding over his own anger.
“I had to,” Steve says, his face blazing. “I mean, have our first kiss. And last kiss before we get engaged.”
“Do I need to remind you of last week?” Natasha remarks. “You guys have barely spoke to each other since.”
“Huh. Guess I do have to handle the introductions—” A short laugh tumbles out of his lips as Carol playfully swats him. “Anyway, meet Carol Danvers.
She engulfs Tony in a hug when they first meet, insists on him to call her ‘Sarah’, and shoos them into Steve’s bedroom with cookies with promises of a good dinner.
“Clint Francis Barton,” Natasha whispers. Steve’s certain he wouldn’t have heard her if it wasn’t for the serum, “you’re insane.”
. It’s only that when they do pause for Steve to catch his breath, Tony realizes he’s in Steve’s lap, his thighs clamping Steve in place and his cape pooling at his feet.
Ty’s smile turns sharp. “Steve, huh? You’re still hung up on that idiot? After all this time?” He steps closer until their noses brush, his breath searing and sour. “Tell me does he know how much you begged for it that night—”
“Yup,” Endgame Steve continues under his breath. “Definitely dense.” He claps Tony on the back, tugging him to the side. “C’mon,” he says, raising his voice. “Kamala has a set of Lego Avengers. Let me introduce you to them.”
“Don’t you worry that pretty little head of yours,” he says, poking Steve in the ribs. “I’m a big boy. I know how to handle a little date. Nothing I can't handle.”
Steve looks exactly the same since Tony last saw him. His hair is the same shade of blond when it’s damp and his blue eyes are still undeniably piercing in the firelight. There’s even the same spread of freckles across his face, the same spread of freckles Tony used to trace once upon a time.
When they kiss this time, it’s as open-mouthed and unhurried as the last one. But it’s also sloppier and wetter. Their hands paw over exposed skin, tugging at their clothes, and then they’re tumbling onto the couch.
Then again knowing him, Steve probably felt bad about leaving Tony alone since the rest of the Avengers aren’t around to go with him this time, with Natasha away on a SHIELD mission, Thor in Asgard, and Bruce on a date with Monica.
Every time Steve excuses himself to his floor for a moment, it’s like a stab to the heart. It makes sense that Steve would want time away from Tony. It makes sense that Steve couldn’t, wouldn’t love Tony the way he wants him to.
Thor puffs his chest like the arrogant Asgardian he is. “Well, I am a god. It is to be expected.” Steve barely suppresses a snort. “It is good to see you both in good health, especially the good captain.” His grin broadens, trained on Steve. “Though he doesn’t seem to feel the same.”
Tony shrugged his shoulders, as if he didn’t just hand all of Steve’s wishes on a silver platter. “I mean, why not? I don’t see you as Cap. I see you as Steve. You see me as a dumbass behind—”
Tony nods, grinning. “Really.” He gives Steve a light punch on the shoulder. “See? It all worked out. You finally got me back.”
“Will heal it. I know, I know. I wasn’t going to bring that up.” Tony sighs, glancing away for a moment. When their eyes meet again, Steve almost shrinks back at the blaze behind his eyes.
“Oh. I get what you mean about the rampage thing.” Kamala pauses to sip her lemonade. “Did I ever tell you of the time Hulk chased me on the helicarrier?”
Tony frowns. “Hey, you definitely deserve shit. You don't have to keep repenting and apologizing for your past.”
Tony twists his head to his side. It’s a little uncomfortable being inside Miles’ backpack, sandwiched between Miles’ Math homework and a tuna sandwich.
But then, Obadiah Stane is whisking Tony away and as quickly, Howard’s at Steve’s side, his eyes drunk with anger.
Neither of them makes a move nor a sound, save for their shallow breathing. Steve’s expression isn’t just soft now. It’s filled with wonder. Hope. Fear.
Tony shrugs his shoulders, taking a sip of his coke. “Don’t be. Never wanted to be a part of that. Sides’, it’s not SI anymore.”
They take their leave with their jackets in hand, not before Tony leaving a hundred dollar tip. Next to him, Steve breaks into a smile that looks surprisingly fond.
Tony smirks. “Yeah. Good thing you didn’t meet Jen ‘cause let me tell you. She’ll kick your ass right there and then. Bruce would definitely help out. And the Hulk.
Tony breaks the spell by taking a step back and dropping his hand. Steve is not disappointed at all.
Here he is on the brink of death and he can’t even say his goodbyes to people like Rhodey, like Pepper, like Jarvis.
“Do I need a reason to play?” Tony counters half-jokingly. Once again, Steve’s eyebrows frown in suspicion and concern. Tony almost caves in. “Needed a distraction and I didn’t feel like tinkering. This is the next best thing.”
“Yeah, well. You did. So. Life’s weird like that sometimes,” Tony holds out the bag of gummies. “How did you learn to play? Your ma?”
Steve stills next to him. “Me too.” He pauses to suck on his cigarette and then quietly breathes out, “There wasn’t a day that passed that I didn’t think of you. When I didn’t miss you.”
“Good. Very good.” Tony tosses his wrench onto one of the worktables before heading for the door. “Fuck, fuck. Okay, okay. See you later, bald brain—”
Hank and Bruce look on fearfully as Steve storms away from them. Tony’s about to follow after him when a hand stops him in place.
Tony freezes. It’s only then Steve realizes that his hands are resting on Tony’s shoulders. He pulls away quickly, hastily apologizing as he buries them in his jeans' pockets.
Tony ignores him, fixating on the hundredth tabloid headline about him and Steve on the screen in front of him instead.
Natasha leans over to whisper conspiratorially into Steve’s ear. “Ignore him. He’s incomprehensible. No point wasting your brain cells on him.”
Steve has never heard of the restaurant, let alone seen it. It doesn't stop his mind from drifting though. He lets himself imagine Tony sitting opposite Jennifer with a lit candle between them, lets himself imagine violins and piano swelling in the background as they bend their heads together to share a laugh, lets himself imagine their faces and their lips inch closer and closer—
Thor strides over with a flock of people tailing him. There’s a broad smile plastered on his face, one that promises mischief and challenges.
“Let me just say if I was there, I would’ve totally jumped in. No one messes with Peter. I’m glad you were there.” Tony exhales and fuck, their faces are close, so close that Steve can feel Tony’s warm breath. “And your boyfriend.”
It’s times like these that he wishes he could drink. But then he remembers the promises he made to his friends and he slumps his forehead against the machine.
“Uh-huh, sure. I’m not the one who insisted I go through ten pairs of shoes.” Tony's eyes rake over Storm, drinking him in. “Wow. You look… Wow.”
Tony lets out a laugh and god, it's so pretty too. It's bad enough that he looks pretty. But his laugh? Sounding pretty? It's downright criminal.
Thor’s brow furrows. “Why not? In Asgard, it is not unlawful to court former lovers of comrades or friends.”
Kamala had invited Miles over to her place for a playdate and Miles had agreed, packing up his toys for his visit, including Steve and Tony. To say Tony’s excited and curious is an understatement.
It’s a tight fit but they manage to make it work. Tony slots in easily between Steve and Natasha, his face buried in Steve’s chest. It’s everything Steve dreams of.
Even Tony seems to think so. He slides into his usual seat between Steve and Natasha the day after his date with Bobbi, pulling a plate of omelet towards him.
An all-too-familiar voice creeps into the room, interrupting Tony mid-song. Before he knows it, he’s switching from Sinatra to Orbach, the melody under his fingertips turning wistful.
“You always talk about how amazing I am,” Tony breathes out. “For some reason. It’s about time I do the same for you.”
Rhodey. Good old Rhodey. Rhodey, who’s been with him since forever. Rhodey, who deserves better than being friends with someone like him, a nothing.
“I see you met Steve,” he says, sounding more energetic, like he always does when the caffeine seems to be working its magic on him.
Party Pooper rolls his eyes. Tony might not know who this girl is but he really, really wants to punch Party Pooper for acting super patronizing towards her. “That’s one time. What about other times?”
“Just tired. Today has been a long day, you know? Picking Barnes up, helping his ass and not to mention—”
Even so, Tony has been unattached for as long as Steve has known him. Or at least, to his knowledge. He’s never seen Tony have company over, save for Pepper and Rhodey whenever they could spare a second out of their busy schedules.
Tony’s eager to argue, to ask Thor to ease the weather for them. But one look at him and Tony knows that wouldn’t be the best idea.
“Yeah.” Steve musters a grin, hoping it’s genuine enough to hide his broken heart. “Good luck with uh… With your Valentine.”
Even so, being here, surrounded by his friends, is the lightest he felt since he got here. It doesn’t lessen the pain in his chest though.
It’s not the first time Tony’s glad that they can’t see each other. From the moment Tony laid his eyes on Steve, he’s been subjected to one too many puppy-dog eyes and one too many poor attempts at making conversation. Like he’s begging Tony for forgiveness, which Tony has no right to give to Steve because
“Tony,” Steve interrupts, trying to sound as gentle as possible despite himself. His heart is thumping hard against his chest, the sound deafening in his ears.
Not that their friends are against their so-called relationship. In fact, they’re enthusiastic about the whole thing.
Speaking of Johnny Storm, he swaggers inside the gym like he owns the place, his smug grin ever plastered on. He has an arm around Tony’s shoulder, a detail Steve tries hard to ignore. Thankfully for his sanity, Natasha trails in after them.
For a brief moment, he lets himself lean into the touch, bask in Tony’s concern before he meets a pair of azure blue eyes behind Tony.
The next day, Steve leaves him a drawing between his locker, of Tony with head thrown back in laughter.
He can’t remember the last time he’s felt like this, the last time anyone could make him feel so warm, so safe, so
“And… And I’m okay now. I'm fine. Alive. You can go now. I'm sure you’ll rather be with him right now. You could call Nat in or Bruce or—”
Touches as light as a feather begin to creep up Tony’s right arm, leaving goosebumps in their wake. He would’ve jerked back in surprise if the scent of Steve’s mint shampoo hadn’t wafted through the air. The music slowly dissipates the higher Steve climbs, ceasing when his hand rests under Tony’s chin.
Oh, who is he kidding? His level of fun barely reaches Johnny’s level of fun, let alone eclipses it.
“We’re flirts, Steve,” he points out. “And single. Single flirts like us communicate by flirting. Sides, Johnny was just playing with you.”
“She offered to help,” Steve finishes, feeling stupider and more embarrassed as seconds go by. “But why was she staying over? I’ve never seen her hanging around the mansion before.”
Steve rears back, crossing his arms in front of his chest as he shoots Tony a look that’s both ruffled and impressed. “Tony!”
Mrs Burke's grin turns predatory. Tony has to hold in the bile that’s threatening to spill out. “It’s been so long since I’ve seen you. The last time was, what? Last year’s gala?” She leans forward, resting a wrinkled palm over Steve’s arm. A flare of jealousy and anger ignites in Tony’s stomach. “You look absolutely dashing tonight.”
Tony laughs. “You make him happy. And that’s all that matters.” He pauses, something terrible crossing his thoughts. “Does anyone—”
His lips twist into a smirk, taking a couple of steps backwards. He probably noticed Tony forgot, the bastard.
If this is some odd way of cheering Steve up, it doesn’t work. He’s about to toss his cards in the air when he loses for the seventh time in the row when Tony strides in, zeroing in on Clint.
Sucking in a breath, Tony’s eyelids fall shut as he crosses his arms on the balcony railing, all the moments that’s happened in the last couple of hours flooding his brain.
“Nonsense!” Thor cries gleefully. “It’s not every day that the good Captain Rogers willingly volunteers to participate in an arm-wrestling competition!”
They play like this for a while. Tony leads him through several nursery rhymes, with Steve following not far behind. It’s nice. Sweet. Soothing. Domestic.
“I know,” Steve replies softly, drawing him closer to press their foreheads together. “You always come for me. No matter what. You would’ve found me eventually.”
“Nope,” she says calmly. “You’re gonna help clean the place up. In fact, all of us are. Except Steve, of course.”
As much as Tony hates to admit, Hammer’s not wrong about that. Whenever there’s a black-tie event or gala, Steve tries his best to worm his way out of going. Even when he does end up going, he always tries his best to blend in with the walls, which Tony finds highly amusing.
“Dumbasses," she mutters, rubbing her temples wearily. She pins him with a scowl, her emerald gaze inciting fear in Tony's weak heart. "Seriously. You boys need to talk. Clear the air. I promise you. You'll like what you hear.”
“We do not mean to insult your intelligence, my friend,” Thor replies. “We assumed you will not be amenable to our proposition.”
It was also the last song his mother played and sung to him. December 16th, 1991. The day Tony had been home for the holidays. The day his parents had decided to leave for the Bahamas.
Steve’s eyes narrow, pinning him with his signature Look of Disappointment™. “We’re toys. You very well know we have our own free thought and will.”
Steve sighs, dropping his hands in his lap and hanging his head in resignation. “You know, it’s okay if you don’t feel the same for me. I get it. It’s just that you said something about confessions and I just thought—”
Tony rolls his eyes before giving Steve a light shove. Like the brick wall he is, Steve doesn’t budge. His eyes twinkle with mirth under the moonlight. Just like that, Tony’s putty again.
He remembers the first time he heard the song on the piano. Six-year-old Tony had been in a corner in tears, his father's drunken screaming still ringing in his ears all because Tony was singing.
He won’t let all his effort go down the drain. Not over something like this. Not for anything ever again.
There are many things a lot of people don't know about Steve, one of them is that he isn’t very fond of the Fantastic Four.
His hand's shaking as he tugs the blanket down to check on his heart, his repulsor pump, before resting his fingers at his pulse point.
Tony always looks good to Steve. And yet here he is, silently losing his mind over the fact that Tony is all dressed up.
Again, Tony’s train of thought disappears. Because this can’t be real. Can’t be at all. Steve can’t be in love with him. Steve can’t—
Maybe it’s a good thing his mother isn’t here. She would’ve laughed at how stupidly lovestruck he is. Or maybe tease him about how stupidly obvious he’s being.
At some point in the night, Jan’s pulled into a conversation with some big-name designer, leaving Tony to explore the gallery alone.
Steve looks absolutely breathtaking with hair slicked back and dressed in white, from his blazer down to his dress shoes. Other people would’ve looked like a Backstreet Boy reject. Steve looks like an angel, untouchable and beautiful.
Natasha silences him with the Glare. Steve should not be deterred by the Glare. He’s Captain America, after all.
“Hey, Thor,” he says cheerily, as if he wasn’t just making out with Steve seconds ago. “Fancy seeing you out— Oh hey, we can actually hear you.”
Tony leans forward. For a split second, Steve prepares himself to be kissed. But then, Tony veers to the side, tickling Steve’s ear with his breath.
Steve Rogers is a ball to be around with. He talks and laughs and listens and spins intricate tales about the life he once had and the life he has now. Even when Tony laughs a little too loudly or makes a joke that falls flat, Steve just grins and looks at him like he isn’t Tony Stark, billionaire, genius, monster.
, bad idea. He should turn him down. He should tell Steve to watch it with his boyfriend. He should—
He thinks of leaving it on the ground for the dust to consume it. He thinks of shredding it into a million pieces. He thinks of taking it inside and turning on the stove to set it on fire.
Steve exhales, holding his hands up in surrender. “Fine. You guys do whatever want. It’s not like you planned on even listening—”
“Of course you are, my friend,” Thor exclaims. “Any friend of an Asgardian is welcome in Asgard. Why, I have had taken Jane—”
All of his friends stand on the other side, clutching bags of takeout and fiery determination radiating from them.
Steve tries not to think about it as he throws himself into his work. Dwelling on it, wondering about it, would just make the whole thing worse.
“Brock’s ugly,” the boy replies before freezing. He looks like he broke the class' cookie jar. “I mean, I think he’s ugly. Only ugly people are mean.”
Steve hadn’t been there for that, having been on a mission for SHIELD. It’s hard for him to figure out whether Clint’s lying, considering everyone else is murmuring in agreement.
Even if she has blue eyes a couple shades darker or smiles at Tony like he hangs the moon and the stars in the sky and makes him feel like he’s worthy.
“Oh, I know. She told me about your...thing a couple of years back,” Bruce says flippantly. “I’m fine with it.”
“It was,” Tony agrees, his hands splayed over the keys in front of him. “Remind me to show you The Fantasticks one day. But if this is your plan on getting me to sing again—”
Tony shrugs his shoulders. “Yeah, but where’s the fun in that? I need to stretch my legs. Plus, it’s more fun to scare the humans.”
They’re quiet as they navigate the streets and the crowds. New York City has always been a place Tony has both loved and despised, full of shadows and ghosts. But he won’t deny that it’s a place where he can just
“Or,” Steve begins, slipping his hand in Tony's, “we could get everything done, order takeout, and maybe hang out. In my room. If you want.”
Something warm covers his hand. Once, it would’ve brought him comfort. But all Tony feels is the endless pit of despair.
gone. Just ask Nat or Carol. Heck, ask anyone. Even Sam can tell you I’ve been gone for you and he hasn’t been on the team for long.”
It doesn’t make sense. Steve’s the paragon of righteousness and truth. He never lies. Why he would start doing it now, over something dumb like this? It’s beyond Tony.
But all he can hear is his heart shattering into a million pieces in the deafening silence called heartbreak.
“If you think I’m going to let you go without a fight,” Steve says, dangerously quiet, “you got another thing coming.”
Fortunately for Tony, Hank doesn’t bother pursuing the subject. “No, I—I get why you kicked me out all those years ago. And I just… I’ve accepted it and I’ve moved on. I’m not mad about it and I’m just… I’m sorry about Monica.”
Tony groans, wiping his face with his grease-stained hands. “Fuck! I can’t believe I— JARVIS! Why didn’t you tell me?”
He almost snorts out loud. He can imagine what Tony would say if he knew what’s going on in his mind right now. A drama queen, he’d call him. Or maybe just this once, he’d indulge in Steve’s overdramatic musings. He would.
Steve huffed. Another reason why Tony would never, ever go for him. Because they met as Captain America and Iron Man, not Steve Rogers and Tony Stark. Not to mention the fact that Tony grew up as a Captain America fan.
The speed at Tony whips his head around is absolutely comical, even more when his eyebrows start climbing up his forehead.
“I know. But I still didn’t want to take the chance.” Steve pauses. “And I thought— I thought you moved on—”
Steve’s face is now a deep shade of crimson. It’s a wonder he hasn’t burst yet. “Yeah. I told everyone to stall you so I could… I could kiss you first.”
“But she was fun,” Tony continues. “It was fun.” He shakes his head, slapping Clint upside his head. “God, I can’t believe you fucked that up.”
Steve’s only managed to wrangle himself out of the terrible company he’s in when he hears footsteps pause behind him.
Just like that, everything breaks and before Tony knows it, tears are rolling down his cheeks and all he can taste is salt and his head hurts and he can’t stop, he just can’t stop—
Tony grins, leaning over with his arms on the counter. He has several inches over Steve, his gorgeous brown eyes boring into Steve’s. Just the thought of their height difference does funny things to Steve’s pathetic heart.
Steve’s cheeks turn a deep crimson. “I just thought— When you asked me to be friends-with-benefits with you, I just felt lucky, you know? Flattered. That you liked this.” He gestures to his body. “And I guess I was just happy to take whatever I can get.”
Not that Steve actually is Tony’s boyfriend. Not that any of this means anything. Not that Tony does wish—
“Where is everyone?” Steve asks as he works to free Tony. “Last I saw, Jan was trying to rope everyone into decorating the place.”
“I know,” Tony replies, a smirk playing on his lips and a twinkle behind his eyes. “I read your diary.”
Johnny waves his hand around in dismissal. “Oh, you know. Thought I’d get Tony to take a break. Figured he needs some fresh air, maybe some eye-candy to ogle.”
He nods, unfastening his tie. Steve doesn’t stare at Tony’s skilled fingers working their way through the knot. Neither does he watch Tony pop the button of his collar, or his Adam’s apple bob or—
Tony can’t remember the last time he’s stepped inside. He probably could count the number of times he’s been here on one hand. Considering the cleaners’ weekly appearance, it shouldn’t be surprising that it’s neat and dust-free, from the wooden floors to the ceiling.
Captain America would’ve wrinkled his nose in disdain and chastise him for smoking. At least, after reading up on modern healthcare and diseases. Steve Rogers would’ve plucked it from his fingers, slipped it between his lips, and offer to light Tony’s.
Steve’s in his apartment, far away from the chaos. Despite the panic and worry he feels, he can’t help but be in awe at these people, these
“I thought you were dead,” Tony begins quietly. “I thought— I looked everywhere for you. Called in so many favors. Asked everyone I could think of. I got a hold of some records. None of the Steve Rogers that enlisted were—”
Steve blushes. “I mean, he was touching you. He touched your butt. I couldn’t just stand there and let him touch my fiancé’s butt.”
Maybe that’s why their friends and some of the press always thought they were a thing. Maybe that’s why Fury barely bats an eyelid at the news.
It’s not to say that Tony’s always huddled up in his workshop. Like sure, he’d pop up from time to time if there’s Movie Night or Game Night Tony barely comes out of his workshop, refuses to even take a step away from his worktable for food and sleep. Even back in the early days, Steve had to hoist him over his shoulder and carry him out just to make sure he was staying healthy.
For the third time (or fourth, who knows at this point), Steve basks in Tony’s compliments. “Yeah. Wanna know something?”
Tony frowns, glancing around the room. “Huh,” he says, tossing his wrench up in the air. “Yeah, where did everyone go?”
Right now though, he’s having very uncharitable thoughts about Bobbi, more so when she pulls the helmet off and shakes her blonde tresses like some model from a Pantene commercial.
He thinks that should be the end of that, this confessing thing. That this is how it ends between the both of them – together in the confinement of a stranded escape pod, floating in space, surrounded by the second most breathtaking view he has ever laid eyes on.
Honestly, all Steve wants to do is curl up in a ball under his covers and hope for the best. Knowing that wouldn’t go down well, he reluctantly agrees to his friends' enthusiastic decision and spaces out throughout the whole viewing.
“Wouldn’t be the first time.” He sweeps his cape behind him, spreading his hands. “Well, how do I look?”
“Aye. She is looking forward to meeting with you.” She nods at Thor. “Your mother sends her love and requests you return for a visit posthaste.”
Instead, they break up on a Tuesday, with the rain pelting the windowpane and the midnight silence stifling.
Despite himself, Steve couldn’t help but grin as he listens to Tony ramble on about his date. There's a part of him that hates how Tony goes on about the sights and wonders of Asgard, about how advanced Asgardian technology is, how delicious their food is, how beautiful and friendly the people are. But how could he be mad when Tony’s smiling like that? If Tony’s happy, so is Steve.
“I never wanted that,” Tony says fiercely, dropping his tablet onto his lap. “I never wanted to be CEO of a company with blood on its hands. I never wanted the spotlight. I never wanted…” He sighs, raking his fingers through his hair in frustration. “I never wanted anything or anyone but you.”
Whenever they’re in Central Park, they would settle under one of the many shady trees, basking in the sunlight and cool air as they enjoy each other’s company. Or Steve usually does, at least.
And that’s how they wind up at their usual diner with their usual order that for some reason, is doubled. It’s usually only doubled for one reason and one reason alone.
Fuck, Thor’s got him there. Tony would never turn down opportunities to prove that magic is nothing compared to science and technology. Thor’s feeding the competitive streak in him. Judging by his cocky smirk, he’s aware of it.
“It’ll be a nice distraction,” Tony says after a beat. “It’s pretty overdue, anyway. Probably good for me to get into the dating game again and try to—”
, he wouldn’t have turned out the way he is. Rebellious. Rude. Uncouth and unfit to be heir to a company like SI. You are nothing, you hear me? When you both graduate, I expect you to be gone from our lives. He will be attending MIT and I will not have him join some community college with you. He has ruined his life for you one too many times and I will not stand idly by once again. Are we clear?”
Looking back, Tony wouldn’t say it’s Miles’ fault. He puts the blame solely on Kamala for letting Miles put him in this predicament.
Just like that, Steve’s taken back to a time when he was younger and kinder and learning about the planets and stars and the enigma named Tony Stark.
Tony leans his head against the wall, trying to catch his breath. “Never pegged Captain America to go for guys.”
Clint makes a retching sound. “You know what? I’m glad you guys kept it on the down-low. Don’t think I could take any form of PDA from either of you.”
Tony glances out of the window, nursing a mug of hot chocolate. It’s two in the morning. Ten at night somewhere else. The perfect time to pop into the nearest liquor store and purchase their finest bottle of whiskey.
“I know,” Tony replies, his nerves getting the better of him. “I know this isn’t really your scene—”
“Oh god,” he blurts out, noticing the envelope and paper bag in Tony’s clutches, “is there something wrong with the card? Is there a defect? I could whip up something—”
“Wait,” Clint cuts in. His bickering with Thor seems to have resolved, with everyone’s attention now on Tony. “You
Surprisingly, Steve isn’t the most fascinated by the art hanging in the hallways. He’s much more taken by the planetarium, especially the space theater.
dating Steve? He’s pretty certain he isn’t. He’d know if they are. Steve’s as subtle as Doom is with his plans on conquering New York when it comes to well, anything.
Tonight, his dreams are neither of those instances. Instead, it’s one of his favorite memories – the both of them playing the piano in the old Stark Mansion. They don’t do it very often, his mother usually away on business and Tony himself at school. But they always manage to squeeze in an hour or two whenever their paths cross.
Dreams of his mother usually give him some semblance of comfort and ease. They remind Tony that there was some form of love in his childhood home, that there was a parent who loves him with their whole heart. This time, however, it leaves him rattled.
Steve huffs in frustration as Link swerves off the map for the millionth time. He doesn’t usually suck at Mario Kart but for some reason, he’s finding it hard to concentrate.
Miles’ savior hardens, hands on her hips. “They don’t. They like each other. They went back in time together.”
Steve heaves another tired sigh, running his fingers through his hair. “For a genius, you’re so stupid.”
Another round of bullets and screams cut him off, this time louder and closer. Before Tony knows it, the door shatters, showering Tony and Zola with splinters.
But that kid needs to stop treating him like he’s an old man. He’s not. He’s in his forties, not seventies.
So with that thought in mind, he fixes his tie, squares his shoulder, takes a deep breath, holds his head high, and—
“Not my best comeback, I know,” Tony admits as he crosses his arms. “But whatever. Not the point. How can you guys be together? Isn’t he—”
Steve’s worked on a couple of SHIELD missions with her. She’s wonderful to work with – strong-willed, friendly, and professional. He has nothing but praise for her in reports to Fury.
“It was,” Steve agrees. “Going from being deaf in one ear to actually being able to play along to a song without any trouble was just…”
“Ten months,” she corrects. “And no. I don’t think so. Don’t get me wrong. He was great and what we had was great but he’s not over you.”
Maybe Steve would’ve included a short letter detailing everything. About his stupid pining and feelings. About how much he desperately likes Tony. And his mussed-up hair and sleepy eyes and his obsession with coffee and his quick snark. About how much he’d love to get to know Tony better.
“In that case,” Steve pulls away, much to Tony’s protest, but keeps their hands clasped together, “let’s go.”
Tony lets out a yelp, scrambling to his feet. He probably would’ve tripped over himself if a strong arm hasn’t curled around his waist, tugging him back on solid ground.
Tony shrugs his shoulders. “Managed to ignore it the whole time. Being in good company helps, I guess.”
Tony chalks it up to a one-off thing. But no matter how many times they lie on opposite ends of the bed, they still wake up tangled the next morning.
He could still feel her skeptic gaze on him as he dashes off. Good thing she doesn't try pressing him for details. The last thing he wants to talk about is that he just lost Steve to a fucking ghost, anyway.
He breathes a quiet sigh of relief when the credits begin to roll and moves to make his exit. He would've succeeded if Clint hadn't decided to play pinochle.
“He didn’t tell me a lot of things,” he replies as he gets to his feet, tossing his phone away without hanging up. He doesn’t check where it lands or if it’s even intact. That’s not his priority right now.
For a moment, Natasha is silent. Natasha’s silence is always uncomfortable. Steve opens his eyes, meeting her curious gaze. It’s as unnerving as the silence. He turns away, hastily pulling on the rest of his clothes.
They had gone out for lunch like they usually do when both of their schedules align. Their lunches usually differ depending on who’s craving what. Since Steve was in the mood for a good old-fashioned hot dog, they snagged some from their usual hot dog stand and headed to Central Park, snapping up a couple of milkshakes along the way.
The walk home is languid and serene. Tony presses himself against Steve, his arm looped around Steve’s as they take each other and their surroundings in.
Sure, Steve’s thought about it over the years, thought about it the moment he laid eyes on Tony, came up with various scenarios on how it’d go down, what they’ll say, what they’ll do.
Tony rolls his eyes before swallowing, guzzling it down with a gulp of coffee. “Did you at least tell Nat what’s eating at you? I mean, if you don’t wanna tell me—”
Steve pauses, glancing at the jar of cookies on top of the cake display. “Yeah. Ma thought it’ll be a hit during this time of the year.”
Because this is Steve Rogers he’s talking to. Steve Rogers, one of the very few people he can be himself with. Steve Rogers, who’s one of his best friends. Steve Rogers, who he’s in love with.
At some point, Steve excuses himself to the bathroom, pecking Tony on his cheek before taking his leave. Reed Richards takes his place.
Endgame Steve beams. “Thanks.” He nudges Tony in the ribs, a hint of playfulness in the gesture. “You should tell him.”
Even Hammer doesn’t seem to buy the statement, his eyes narrowing in suspicion behind his glasses. “Oh. I didn’t know you two were dating.”
Steve makes quick work of the remaining wires and not before long, Tony’s free. Tony takes Steve's outstretched hand, letting himself be hoisted to his feet.
He expects a slap across the cheek, a punch to the jaw. Instead, Tony kisses him back with equal fervor.
It’s bad enough that the actor for Sherlock looks exactly like Tony, but the fact that a guy that looks like Tony is blatantly pining over his married best friend is just…just…
Instead, he says, “That’s the thing. It’s not the thought of us dating bugs me because fuck, I’d break a limb to even hold your hand and kiss you and I just hate that you’ve been going around waxing poetic about me like I’m your boyfriend because I’m not your boyfriend and this whole relationship shtick is a shtick because Hammer blabs and everyone will have our asses if they know you’d lie. And sure, maybe some people would have the common sense to not listen to that idiot but he has friends who are idiots too. And don’t get me started on the press. Why the fuck did you say that in the first place? Why the fuck you would say that and wax poetic about me when I’m in love with you—”
The painting is nothing special, just a painting of the street Steve grew up on splashed in brown and gray. Two kids are speeding past an apartment, one blond and one brunet.
Heaving a sigh, he turns off the faucet and steps out of the shower. He winces as he pauses in front of the mirror. The bruise blooming on his cheek is big and purple. At least the serum will take care of it.
“My boyfriend,” Steve repeats warmly like he’s genuinely talking about the love of his life. “Tony looks beautiful tonight, doesn’t he? I mean he always does but you know, tonight's—”
This isn’t right. Steve doesn’t love Tony. Steve shouldn’t be in love with Tony, who’s loud and obnoxious and too much. Steve should be in love with someone who’s just like him, kind and sweet and good.
This is the moment Tony expects Steve to freak out and realize what he just said and done. It’s one thing to out yourself as bisexual. But to say you’re in a relationship with the Merchant of Death?
Steve barely registers his fingers moving, barely registers opening the envelope as his body thrums with anticipation and nerves.
Tony’s eyebrows shoot up, almost dropping the wrench in his grasp. “I thought you weren’t gonna set me up with anyone.”
“Not just sharp,” Clint chimes in. “Absolutely jaw-dropping and heart-stopping. Tony will definitely not say no.”
Tony can say all he likes but Steve knows that he’s the reason Tony’s leaving. Howard should be leaving, not Tony.
Tony rolls his eyes. “It’s nothing. Don’t be such a worrywart. Take it from me. Frowning will age you—”
Steve blinks, meeting Natasha’s cool gaze as the pain in his side ebbs away. She has an eyebrow raised knowingly.
That he wishes to travel the world with Steve by his side. That he longs to disappear somewhere no one could find either of them.
Tony stumbles, almost tripping over his own feet. Sharon steadies him with a tight grasp. After all this time, she’s always there to catch him when he falls.
And when Steve finally sinks into him, Tony feels like his heart's going to burst with both happiness and anguish.
“C’mon,” Natasha says, magically appearing in his workshop at three am like the ninja she is, “we’re watching Star Trek.”
“You were jealous,” Tony says, a smirk forming on his lips. “Steve Rogers was jealous of Justin Hammer.”
“So,” Natasha says as Steve and his friends dig into their takeout boxes after seeing Tony off, “what kind of date did you plan for them?”
“Um, yeah. You too.” Steve blinks, racking his head for something. Anything. “I, uh… I like the shirt. The blue. You don’t wear blue often but it looks, uh… You know—”
But it doesn’t matter what they think. Because Tony’s dressed up. Tony’s dressed up and absolutely gorgeous. Just for Steve.
“The stocks have skyrocketed. And you know how often the board’s been on my ass since I became Iron Man.”
“Hey there, Avengers,” Bobbi says cheerily, striding over. Her face clouds for a brief moment when her eyes meet Clint’s. “Barton.”
They go to a nearby hole-in-a-wall tucked on a quiet street. They talk about everything under the sun but mostly about everything that’s happened to them since they last spoke. They talk about work and friends but not love. They never were good at talking about love.
It’s also why he lies in the bathtub, water soaking his clothes as he listens to the banging on his door grow louder and louder and—
He doesn’t think about how Tony should be sitting across him, stuffing his face with coffee and waffles.
It happens again and again and even when Howard herds Tony off to some party against his will, Tony finds some way to escape to Steve and all Steve could do is brace himself for the fall.
“I can go,” Steve says. “If you want me to. I’m not supposed to be here, anyway. Just wanted to check in with you. See if you’re okay.”
But then Steve remembers the last five years, five more years of his life wasted, and decides that this is it. He shouldn’t take this to his grave, take
For the rest of the day, Steve feels like he’s floating on air. Everyone else mercilessly teases him about it. He could barely give a shit.
Tony expects Steve to deflect the question again, maybe finally take off. Instead, Steve just shoves his hand into the bag, pulling out a handful of bears.
Oh, how he longs for those quiet moments. The thought of laying his head on Steve’s lap as Steve reads and Tony works sounds like heaven right now.
Tony whirls around, clutching his heart. “Jesus fuck, Barton. The hell are you doing here?” He frowns. “And why’re your clothes not stained with grease? Hell, why’re you even dressed up? I didn’t even know you own a button-up.”
Tony drops his head back onto the mattress. “Asshole. You’re an asshole, you know that? I’m going to—to—”
Everyone’s heads whip in his direction, various expressions  of shock written on each of their faces. Out of the corner of his eye, Steve sees Natasha’s lips quickly twist into a gleeful smirk.
Tony doesn’t notice him, too transfixed on the painting in front of him. It’s a mixed media, watercolor and oil pastel and took Steve a week to finish. Tony’s in his armor with his helmet in his grasp as he sits on the edge of a building, staring up into the night sky.
“Taken lessons, have you?” he asks quietly as they continue to skate across the floor with surprising ease.
Tony doesn’t notice him at first. Not at all. He’s too busy staring down the bottom of his glass, too busy wallowing in his loneliness and misery to notice the world swirling around him.
But then, it doesn’t make any sense either. Steve isn’t close to having Cap’s built, not to mention—
Steve gulps. He had more to say, to tell Tony, to declare. But after Tony interrupted him, all the words he’s been wanting to say shrivels up.
The kiss this time is longer but as soft and warm, and so much better than Steve imagined. He is one lucky,
“She helped me choose the ring.” Tony peers down at the ring box in his hand, a fond smile playing on his lips. “Well, technically
After several heated debates (which involved a cheese grater, a broom, and a Q-tip), Bruce ends up going first. According to him, his pick would help Tony ease himself into things.
The response changes. Most of the time, Tony would say, “I hate it there.” Sometimes, it’s, “The kids hate me.”
The rest of the week passes in a blur. He spends his time avoiding Steve and Barnes by throwing himself into his work and distancing himself from group activities.
“Tony,” Mr Burke interrupts in disbelief, his eyes snapping over to Tony as if he’s finally noticed his presence. Typical. “Stark?”
When the Stark name begins to mean something, Steve and Tony hardly have time to themselves. There’s always someone by Tony's side. They ask for tutoring lessons, offer up their lunches, bat their eyelashes.
It’s hilarious seeing the reactions they’d get, ranging from discomfort, disgust, mortification to genuine happiness.
“No!” Steve exclaims. “I do! I really, really like you. I’m—”  He exhales, schooling his features into one that’s full of determination. “I’m in love with you.”
Steve watches him disappear, watches Tony take his heart away with him, watches Tony walk into the arms of someone else—
Steve can’t help but grin as he watches Clint dash out of the room, Hulk hot on his heels. Just like with every single Hulk rampage, there’s a lot of crashing and screaming.
It’s not like out of the ordinary weird. Not for Tony, anyway. He’s well aware he doesn’t make friends easily. Bucky tossed him into Miles’ stack of color pencils when they first met without any explanation.
It could’ve been him and Tony together, could’ve been Tony by his side as Steve watches his friends bicker.
Months after his twenty-first birthday and getting his second Master’s degree, Tony Stark takes over as CEO of Stark Industries. He’s the youngest CEO of a Fortune 500 company ever.
“You know all that shit in your head?” Natasha begins as the credits begin to roll. “They’re not true.”
Steve inwardly scoffs. More like his unconscious volunteered for him. But he’s definitely not going to back out now. Not when Carol is his opponent.
Steve blinks, following his gaze. The chopsticks in his grip are in pieces. His cheeks begin to heat up.
“And lost,” Tony echoes kindly. “But you did, anyway. You stood up for Peter. And all the other times you stood up to the bullies at school. It’s amazing.”
Steve blinks through his tears as he cups Tony’s cheek. “If it makes you feel better, you ruined me for anyone else too. Fuck, we wasted so much time. So much fucking time. We’re fucking forty-two, Tony. I can’t—”
Steve’s well-acquainted with the unknown, learnt to stop fearing it over time. But sitting next to his best friend, the man who he loves with all of his heart, waiting for said man to tell him how he feels for Steve, is on a whole other plane.
“Of course not,” Tony lies. “Why would I be disappointed in seeing one of my favorite people around?”
Eventually, they break apart to catch their breath. Tony’s fingers ghost his reddened lips, his eyes wide. “What—”
Hearing his name out of Cap’s mouth now sounds different. It isn’t the stiff and disapproving baritone that Tony’s used to hearing from him. It’s warm and gentle. Just like how Steve used to say his name.
Dinner feels like an eternity to sit through, made even worse when the rest decides to rewatch the Lord of the Rings trilogy.
“Hey!” Clint exclaims. “I can totally keep a secret. I wouldn’t be one of SHIELD’s best, otherwise.”
Tony stares at it for a brief moment before gingerly taking it from her. From where Steve's standing, they look like ordinary daisies but Tony immediately brightens up at them. “Wow. Honestly, I’m not much of a flower guy but these look amazing.” He buries his nose between the petals, sucking in a breath. “They smell amazing too.”
And like she said too. If Tony isn’t meant to be his, Steve will just have to live with it. He’s done it before. He’ll do it again.
If Steve has to compare them to paint, he’d say Tony’s like watercolor – free, iridescent, and all-too consuming.
does. Even if there’s a part of him that’s still fuming over her betrayal, (and yes, he has to remind himself every now and then that they’re toys and not their movie characters) he’d rather have Rhodey or Pepper, or Carol, or Peter to talk to about this. Maybe even Sam, despite the fact that Sam’s been spending most of his time ranting about how much of a fraud Freud (haha, fraud. Freud) is, nowadays (thanks, Miles’ parents). He’d definitely take that rant over this.
Steve lets out a quiet chuckle, drawing away from the doorframe. “Sorry. Didn’t mean to sneak up on you.”
How could’ve he been so stupid? How could he have fallen for Steve? For Captain America? It was supposed to be just no-strings-attached, sex. Feelings weren't supposed to be involved. Ever.
Clint snorts. “It’ll probably be a bunch of bullcrap. We definitely have to have Rhodes over for the deets.”
Steve can barely pay attention to what JARVIS is saying, his right arm aching. Carol had put up a good fight. Hell, she was much better than Steve thought she’d be.
If Tony still has a pulse, he’d be pretty sure it’ll be racing right now. “That’s different,” he says slowly. “We’re friends. Just friends. Friends with a capital ‘F’.”
interested in Tony? Why would Johnny even consider dating Tony? For one, Tony’s way too old for him. Johnny’s in his early, mid-twenties? Sure, Steve’s younger than Tony too but he’s closer in age (and no, his true age doesn’t count).
Of course he doesn’t. Steve isn’t a superhero with alien blood running through his veins. He isn’t the one who used to be one of the best officers in the American Air Force. He isn’t dating Tony either.
Tony’s grin turns smug. “I know things.” He pauses. “Well, Nat told me. Nat told me a lot of things about you. About your art and uh… Yeah.”
jealous. And I’ve been jealous for a very long time of Johnny. I want to be the one you flirt with.”
“Gotta admit,” she says, cutting through Steve’s train of thought. “Kinda hurt he didn’t recognize me.”
Thor beams, his hands on his hips. Tony half-expects lightning to shoot the space behind him. “I challenge thee to a race across the country!”
“Sure,” he replies instead and tells him about the constellations and the galaxies, of the way his mother’s curls framed her soft and weary face and the bright smiles Tony and Tony alone gets to see.
Then again, Tony’s a hypocrite for not letting Rhodey know he isn’t buried under all that rubble at his family estate. But still.
“I don’t think he’s angry,” Peter’s voice suddenly pipes up next to him, snapping Tony out of his reverie. “I mean, he keeps giving you these sad puppy dog eyes, which are by the way—”
And just like that, Steve’s mind wandered and his chest ached and his mouth unconsciously clamped shut, ending the conversation he was sharing with Tony abruptly. He didn’t know how long he was wallowing on missed opportunities and what-ifs until Tony waved his hand in front of Steve’s eyeline.
Steve nods, squaring his shoulders in preparation for what Tony has to say. He doubts Tony would have anything bad to say. Then again, he’s been proven wrong before. Steve might have a crush on the guy for most of his life but he wouldn’t hesitate to fistfight Tony if he has to. Because no one—
Which is good. Very good. After all, Tony was going to talk about how lonely he was and how much he’s been pining over Steve’s sad and pathetic self the moment he popped out from the box. Before then, even.
Tony accepts the mug of coffee with a quiet murmur of thanks. He takes a long sip, watching Cap pick his shield up.
“Or at least someone you’re attracted to. ‘Cause let me tell you, nothing kills the mood better than—”
Tony shrugs. “It’s one of the few things, skills, I don’t flaunt. Not something people are interested in, anyway. Not gonna sway any board members by playing fucking Für Elise for them. Sides’, there’s a high chance I wouldn’t even play. Well, maybe if you get me drunk enough and near an instrument.
A good thing considering the predicament he got himself in. He really isn’t in the mood to explain to her about how he’s helping the boy he’s half in love with for years pick out a Valentine’s Day card for someone else.
He spins on his heel, eager to storm off to will his racing pulse someone quiet. He’s stopped by a pair of clear azure eyes.
A faint blush begins to spread across Steve’s cheeks. It’s downright adorable. “Uh, I can’t build an arc reactor?”
It’s times like these that Tony wishes he wasn’t born into this life, a life that neither Steve nor Captain America would never, ever see himself in.
Tony hates this, hates how the one thing he wants is totally out of reach, hates Howard for not telling him this one fucking little thing, hates how Steve—
A flash of his best friend’s face pops up in his head. Steve banishes it before he gets more grossed out.
Tolkien. But he'll sit through the whole trilogy with me. For me. He did that eight times this month.”
Pushing away every thought in his head, Steve forces himself to focus on detangling Tony from the clutches of pumpkin lights. Thankfully, it isn’t as complicated as Steve thought it would be.
“Yeah. I can imagine.” Tony clicks his tongue. “That means you shouldn’t have any problems following along to Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star. Wait, you
Tony should say no. He should haul Steve to his feet and tell everyone to scram, tell them that this is all a misunderstanding. He should toss the ring far, far away and make a run for it.
There’s a letter addressed to Steve, written in an all-too-familiar scrawl. It talks about how boring school is, how mean people are over there, how the food sucks.
Steve’s a different story though. There are moments, moments when he watches Steve’s gaze wander and linger and tighten, his eyes darkening. It’s probably nothing.
, Steve!” Tony yells. “Years! I never heard from you! I called and begged and fuck, you could’ve sent me a letter or two! Could’ve told me you were alive—”
“Nope. My music teacher in elementary school taught me. Ma used to work long hours at the hospital so I had to walk home alone. The bullies figured I was an easy target and I didn’t have Bucky at the time so I’d hang back for an hour or two until I was sure they weren’t around. My music teacher saw me loitering around once, invited me over to the music room, and gave me piano lessons to pass the time. Been a thing we did ever since.”
He won’t deny it though, how it still hurts when they approach him and try to strike up a conversation because all he can think of is Steve’s arms around his two best friends and—
“Huh.” She tilts her head to the side, squinting up at him. “What’s with the long face? C’mon. Turn that frown upside down.”
“I know. I just… I’m a coward, Nat. Tonight’s the perfect time for me to gauge how Steve feels about me without me telling him about my feelings in detail and embarrassing myself and not be the laughing—”
“There you are,” Steve says, relief evident in his tone. “You ran off pretty quickly. I was worried about you.”
They’ll notice absence soon and Tony’s definitely going to be yelled at later, but he’s fine with it. If he gets to kiss Steve tonight, it’ll be worth losing his hearing for.
“Am I boring you, Mr Stark?” Zola intones as he saunters over to Tony’s side, a syringe in hand. “You haven’t said a word since you were brought to me.”
He didn’t plan on this. They didn’t plan on this. Tony could tell the truth – that he grew up loving and then hating the man, that his heart almost stopped when he heard that Steve was still alive, that the first time they met when the city was on fire, Tony almost drowned in those, blue
The man just looks at him with sad, sad eyes and suddenly Tony hates him. Hates him for pitying him. Hates him for choosing Tony in the first place. Hates him for having the same blue eyes as Steve. Hates him for giving him orgasms that couldn’t make him forget.
Much to both Steve’s delight and displeasure, Tony’s dressed in his usual combo of tank top and jeans. As much as Steve loathes Tony in pressed suits (Tony in a suit and tie shouldn’t leave Steve speechless, it’s horrifying), this outfit is so much worse. Tank tops always do an amazing job at showing off Tony’s lean body and toned arms.
“And that’s the problem. People only see me as Captain America. No one bothers to get to know me behind the mantle.”
He doesn’t see much of Bucky and Sam after. Tony gets it, understands even. They’re Steve’s friends, after all.
He looks good. Ridiculously good. His hair longer, combed back. His skin glowing. His eyes the same bright shade of blue the last time Tony saw him.
Steve winces, his whole face now turning crimson red. Hell, even the tip of his ears is a bright shade of blush. It’s goddamn adorable.
Party Pooper turns his attention towards her, sneering. “Have you seen the movies? They hate each other.”
Tony scoffs, motioning to sit on the edge of his bed. “That’s what you said six decades ago,” he says, rubbing the rest of the sleep from his eyes. “And what happened after?”
Judging by the looks the rest of the team sends Steve and Tony for the rest of the meal, Tony has a feeling that he’s been set up.
“I’m in love with you,” Steve confesses. “I’ve been in love with you for years. Probably since we first met. I’ve loved you before I knew what I feel for you is love. And even after all these years—”
Carol doesn’t say anything for several moments. “God, Tony,” she finally says, massaging her temples. “Only you idiots. You could’ve cleared it all up.”
“Well,” Tony begins, tilting forward until their faces are inches away from one another. “I can totally manage that. But first. Coffee. Nat told me you like the diner down the block. I was gonna get you a slice of pie from the place but then I’d figure we could make a date out of it. I mean after you’re done closing up, of course. And if you want to.”
Thor takes it in stride, barking out a hearty laugh. “Nay. We have never courted or married. Your Midgardian myths are utter nonsense. Preposterous! We are friends and warriors in arms. And that is all we are.”
Besides, Steve can handle things. Steve with the broad shoulders with arms that could probably bench press Tony if he asked. Steve who could tear limbs apart as easy as breathing because he’s a freaking—
Tony grins. “Yeah. It was fun. Jen’s just as fun as the last time we—” He blanches, his eyes darting away. “I mean—”
Steve’s shoulders sag but his blue eyes are still stormy with anger. “Jesus, Tony. I told you to drop it.”
“I have all the time in the world,” Tony cuts in, his insides turning into goo at the smile that’s spreading across Kamala’s lips. “Hit me.”
For a long moment, neither of them breathes a word out. Tony keeps his gaze trained on the horizon and hopes his fingers would stop shaking soon.
The resounding slam coming from the bedroom door snaps Tony out of his reverie. It seems to do the same to Steve because his eyelids flutter rapidly, his cheeks darkening further.
“Don’t be a spoilsport, Tony!” Carol exclaims. She returns to her knees, leaning against the coffee table as she cracks her knuckles. “If Army here is game, so am I.” Carol bares her teeth, radiating smugness. Steve is eager to wipe it off her face. “Always wanted to arm-wrestle Captain America.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “Cut me some slack, Steven. I’ve been dead for centuries. Excuse me for not remembering. I figured that was your regular heartbeat.”
“Uh-huh. Sure it doesn't,” Clint drawls, propping his legs on top of the coffee table. Bruce immediately nudges it off. “Us thinking of setting up the guy you’ve been pining—”
Steve lifts his head, a disarming smile gracing his lips. “Yeah,” he says simply, like he’s breathing for the first time.
“My mom loved everything about space,” Tony whispers as they watch planets and star clusters float above their heads. “When Howard wasn’t around and the skies were clear, my mom would take me outside. We have this telescope out back and she’d let me take a look. We’d just lie outside and stargaze and she’d tell me about them.”
“Kamala,” the teacher finally chides (took her way too long in Tony’s opinion, but whatever, it’s still better than nothing). “Sit back down.”
Tony barks out a laugh. “Well, that’s Howard for you. Mom gave me lessons whenever Howard wasn’t around.” He sighs. “It was one of the few times I saw her at peace.”
Tony sighs, placing his hands on his hips. “Jeez. Steve Rogers and their stupid, stupid—” He pauses, whirling back. “Wait, did you say you and your Tony—”
Tony smirks as he watches the two dash out of the ballroom. Maybe this time, the Burkes will finally leave them alone.
Tony chews on his bottom lip, hoping Sharon and Jan would come back from the bathroom right now. If both of them didn’t need to go to the bathroom, he wouldn’t be stuck in this situation.
“No!” Tony exclaims so loudly that his voice startles the both of them. He clears his throat, bright chestnut eyes shining as they roam Steve’s face. Once again like the delusional optimist he is, Steve lets himself hope.
“Good. Good.” Tony takes another stab at his sausage. “So, guess which part of the Tower needs repairs?”
“It can’t be as embarrassing as me,” Tony replies. “I was trying to get you alone all night. So I could kiss you when the ball drops.”
But Steve can’t be here. He can’t. The brass wouldn’t let him in the army, let alone on a suicidal mission to rescue Tony.
“Apparently, you look at him with, and I quote, ‘A glare so deathly that it makes Scott Summers’ optic beams look harmless.”
But then he realizes he’s an idiot for thinking that when he steps inside the diner and finds Steve cradling Sharon Carter’s cheek.
An uncomfortable silence fills the room. Steve looks torn between staying and hightailing out of there, his eyes glancing to the side and his posture a little stiffer than before.
Tony’s probably laying it on too thick (why, Steve has no clue), but he’s going to take all he can get because he’s a weak,
He’s been through enough to know that a situation like this calls for the public spotlight. But it’s worse when it’s just Steve and him together, sitting on a lumpy couch in a stuffy room on a late-night talk show.
Steve hums. “You don’t have to feed me to get me to talk, you know? You usually either poke me with a screwdriver or tickle me until I cave in.”
“Come back,” he whispers as the man with the hammer rips the and Janet van Dyne presses her lips to Tony’s.
Tonight, he’ll give it as good as he can give. Tonight, he’ll give Steve anything and everything he's ever fantasized about and wants.
“I should’ve said something,” Steve says into the dark much later, the glow of Tony’s arc reactor illuminating the room.
The night before was great. Him and Tony had spent it playing chess and playing video games and they were going to watch the whole Lord of the Rings trilogy until Tony abruptly excused himself and hastily dashed off.
His gaze drifts, narrowing onto Jan, who’s thankfully out of Steve’s line of sight. Her smile dims as soon as their eyes meet. With graceful poise, she saunters over.
“Yeah, ‘oh’.” Tony shakes his head. “I know I said you’re cute when you’re jealous but you’re also kinda mean when you’re jealous.”
The anguish on Steve’s face is downright palpable. Tony doesn’t think he’s seen him this pained. Then again, it could be the painkillers and wishful thinking addling his brain.
If Steve hadn’t lied, maybe Tony wouldn’t be straddling the line between hope and despair. Maybe Tony wouldn’t be out here wishing that Steve meant it when he called Tony the love of his life.
“This is my first time seeing you play,” Steve replies quietly. “Of course, I have a few questions. But you don’t have to answer them if you don’t feel comfortable.”
“Sides',” Tony continues, “he was the one who mentioned the possibility of you being interested in me—”
He can't find it in himself to finish that thought without his stomach churning. Yet his traitorous brain won't stop imagining Steve kissing Barnes the way he kissed Tony, touching Barnes the way he touched Tony, telling Barnes—
“Uh huh. Sure, you weren’t.” He claps Steve on the shoulder. “Come on. I’m craving blueberry pie. Let’s go get blueberry pie.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “Very funny. I hope you’re not taking me to an open mic performance. It’ll be embarrassing for the both of us.”
But then he hears a quiet baritone next to him and then suddenly, he’s seized with the need to hear, see, know.
Steve is perfectly content with keeping up with the charade, sticking by Tony’s side and openly holding his hand and nuzzling his cheek and looking at Tony as if he’s his whole world.
“Yeah. I mean, you finally know my secret room now. Might as well make yourself comfortable and stuff.”
“It’s fine, you worrywart. Go give Steve your present.” She flashes Steve a warm smile. “Happy birthday again, Steve.”
“I actually came up with it while I was eating a jar of Nutella. The large one. And before you ask, it’s not the humongous one. It’s the… The medium-sized ones? They’re bigger than the thirteen ounce ones.”
you. I’m in love with you for a very long time now. So, no. No, I don’t want to forget about it.” He pauses, the fear creeping back in his eyes. “Unless you do, which is—”
“Steven Grant Rogers,” Natasha begins, a hint of amusement in her tone, “never thought I’d see the day you quit on going after what you want.”
Tony rolls onto his back, his eyes glued to the ceiling. “I think you already know the answer to that.”
Now they sit in the same booth, waiting for their order in awkward silence as some indie song spins above their heads and drunk patrons scream at the top of their lungs.
A lump forms in Tony’s throat. He swallows it down before he bursts. “You barely spoke to me since we sent Thor and Loki off.”
Well, it was until a couple passed them by, their fingers brushing and their heads bent together as they giggled softly to themselves.
He tears his gaze away and gets to his feet. He probably doesn’t recognize Tony yet. And he shouldn’t. Tony definitely doesn’t look presentable enough to be recognized, doesn’t look—
He shouldn't have kissed Steve while he was high on adrenaline and rage, shouldn’t have let Steve fuck him against the wall of his workshop, shouldn’t have offered Steve to do it again and again and again because Tony’s been in love with Steve since New York burned and he never could resist fire and pain.
The other three are much smugger about the whole thing, clapping them on the shoulder and telling them under no circumstances can they have sex anywhere but their own bedrooms. Steve has never felt this mortified and turned on in his life.
For a moment, Tony pretends that he’s on one of his adventures with Steve at his side. That he and Steve have decided to seek refuge in a cave for the night. That Steve is quietly going over the events of the day next to him and not polishing a shield. That Steve isn’t bulky and cold and square.
The moon hangs high in the night sky, casting the music room with a silver glow. It takes Tony back to better nights, nights when he’d sit next to his mother as she fills the lonely mansion with song. Nights where Jarvis and Ana would join them with a tray of steaming tea and chocolate chip cookies. Nights when Tony’s heart settled for a brief moment.
It’s a nice night out, the cool spring air a welcoming feeling on his face and the Big Apple lights a dazzling sight. It would’ve been calming if some sugary pop song isn’t blaring from the ballroom but hey, it’s better than nothing.
She’s as beautiful as ever, dressed in a dress shirt and jeans, her blonde hair tied up in a ponytail, and a smile that could light up a whole city. Out of all the few people he’s dated, Sharon’s his favorite. It probably helps that they started out friends before Steve asked her out.
“Tony Stark,” Sharon replies when he asks and suddenly all Steve wants to do is to take the next flight out to California, apologize for being cruel, and never let him slip away.
No, he needs a distraction. A real and proper distraction. Something that could consume him whole, that could make him forget. A last resort.
They try their best to navigate their way over to Tony’s bed without breaking their make-out session. It’s a little difficult considering the mess, but they manage to tumble onto the bed without any injury.
“Anyway,” Tony says as he pushes Steve out of the elevator, “I’m going to go back to work. Okay? Okay. JARVIS, workshop.”
“I have orders, Tony!” Steve retorts. “I’m a soldier. Everyone was sworn to secrecy. I couldn’t just—”
Natasha rolls her eyes. “Alright, alright. Party pooper.” She pokes his shoulder before sauntering away. “C'mon, you big lug.”
Rumlow teases them for it. Steve punches him. Tony bursts into tears when Steve gets in trouble. It only stops when Steve gives him a hug and gifts a drawing of Tony to him.
Considering his friends’ habits, it’s weird for the place to be void of people and noise. Even at this time of the day, there’s always someone hanging around. Thor and Clint would be perched on the couch, playing some video game. Natasha would be leafing through a book or magazine.  Steve would be curled on the loveseat with his nose buried behind his sketchbook. Bruce is an occasional sight but when he’s around, he’d be scrolling through his StarkPad and quietly talking to himself.
Thor grins. “The most. It is missing the delicacies and mead from Asgard. Fortunately, the food is excellent enough by Asgardian standards. Give my regards to the caterer! However, that is not why I am here to speak to you both about.” He tilts his head in Kamala’s direction. “I was wondering if you could spare Tony for a moment.”
“Steve,” Sharon says, sounding serious, sympathetic, and amused all at once. “I love you. I really do. But you’re an idiot.”
“I’m not a Skrull,” Steve huffs. “Or an LMD. Or under the influence of magic. Or mind-controlled. I genuinely do think we should stay engaged. At least, for now.”
“This is amazing. Damn, Rogers. I heard you’re great at art but this is so much better than I thought.”
Fuck, how could he forget? He’s been planning this shindig for days, weeks. Not to mention the fact he has a very important plan to carry out at midnight. It’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity (well, yearly but whatever).
Tony frowns, his eyes roving around Steve’s face before softening. “Alright, guys,” he says, clapping his hands. “Clear the room. Steve and I are gonna have a lovely chat alone.”
“Uh, sure.” Steve’s eyes trail over to the person next to him, almost freezing at the sight of Tony clad in a black tank top. And judging by the light sheen on his tanned skin and the way the cloth clings to his lithe frame, he must’ve been down in the workshop before this.
Tony ignores the sharp pain in his chest, the voices in his head agreeing, and fishes his keys from his pockets.
“That shirt is definitely not going to work out,” Natasha says disdainfully. “Doesn’t show off your abs.”
Cap never made his hatred for Tony a secret. He hardly acknowledges his presence and always makes excuses to not be in Tony’s vicinity. Whenever he and Tony’s team cross paths, he would gladly speak to everyone but Tony.
Natasha doesn’t say a word as she watches Steve pluck the ring box from his drawer. The smile she sends his way does.
Tony barks out a laugh and pulls her into a tight embrace. She smells like jasmine and old books and sweet peach tea.
Judging by his damp hair, Steve must’ve just taken a shower. It’s unfair how gorgeous Steve looks, even when he’s dressed in a simple T-shirt and sweatpants.
To be fair, today's their anniversary. The occasion is basically screaming for cologne and hairspray.
He warms up with a couple of simple tunes before transitioning to any song he could recall from the top of his head. He bounces between more difficult classical pieces with practiced ease, occasionally adding a more modern tune or two. Schubert’s Ave Maria to Billie Joel’s Piano Man. Debussy’s Clair de Lune to The Beatles’ Blackbird.
“I emailed your agent,” she replies. Her hair’s silver now, tied up in a bun. She’s still as beautiful as the last time he saw her.
“I used to resent you,” he says quietly. “You didn’t write back. You didn’t bother to reach out to me, even when Howard—”
“Your art is more recognizable than you think it is.” She pauses. “Tony loves your art too. I don’t know if he knows it’s you but knowing him, he probably does.”
“Please don’t tell me you only found out when I was on a date with your doppelganger.” Something must’ve shown on Steve’s face because Tony pales. “Jesus, Steve.”
“It’s fine. You don’t have to—” Tony cuts himself off, his mouth moving before his brain could stop it. “You think it’s weird?”
Tony doesn’t say anything for a long moment. “It’s a mess. The whole thing’s a mess. Imagine when everyone finds out that this is all fake. They’ll kill us.”
Much to Steve’s surprise and hidden disappointment, Tony doesn’t seem to have noticed, brushing everything off as terrible pranks. Which is fine. Very fine. Steve never thought Tony would reciprocate his feelings, anyway.
Carol chuckles, rubbing circles over Tony’s back. Steve quickly glances away. “Let me guess, happens every day?”
Steve nods, his head frantically bobbing like his Funko counterpart when Funko Tony kissed him that one time. “Yeah. I meant that you weren’t supposed to hear that and I didn’t mean to say it since you’re in love with Kamala’s Endgame Steve and—”
“I know,” he interrupts. “I just— I just thought you were saying it to make me feel better. And everyone said you were! They said you were crying to Inception!”
It’s agonizing how wonderful it is to have Steve as his date. He’s polite but won’t hesitate to be firm with assholes. He holds him and kisses him and feeds him as a good fiancé does.
Tony should storm over, shake Cap's shoulders because it doesn’t make sense. Nothing makes sense. He can't be the same Steve Rogers Tony's in love with. Steve Rogers was funny and warm and everything Captain America isn’t. He’s full of light and love and deserved more than being a country’s propaganda.
Steve arches an eyebrow, his cheeks warming. “And why do I need to wear something that’s showing off my abs?”
Steve doesn’t know how much time has passed and he’s pretty sure he’s nodded off a couple of times when he hears the door open.
Steve’s first instinct is to yell a resounding ‘no’ and an ‘over my dead body’ before hightailing out of the building. There is no way he’s going to help Tony get the person he’s been pining for.
“You know,” Tony says as he twirls strands of pasta noodles with his fork. “I was at Sarah’s funeral.”
Steve rolls his eyes, his smile thinning. “Acting like I hate you was one of the hardest things I’ve done,” he whispers, as if afraid of his own confession. “You have to know that. You don’t know how many times I wanted to rip my cowl off and tell you.”
But that’s the thing about the imagination, they’re just figurative. Most of the stuff that swims Steve’s brain has a very,
“I know you’re not sick,” Aunt Peggy says much later when everyone has left. Or at least that’s what she says.
Like the angel she is, Sharon helps him slip away before the exhibition ends. Steve’s definitely going to give her a raise. Or set her up with an Avenger.
Tony whips his head around, staring in horror as that giant egghead aims his lasers in Barnes’ direction. Barnes who's moving too slowly for an assassin.
Steve blinks, finally noticing the hand Johnny’s been waving in front of him. “Sorry, I was just...just wondering why the both of you are here.”
Steve scoffs. Sure, she's pretty and regal and all that, but what’s with the get-up? She’s taking Tony on a date, not to war. He wouldn’t put it past Asgardians to bring bouquets of flowers along with them during battles.
Since Steve’s identity is a secret, he doesn’t attend any of his exhibitions without a disguise. Neither does he do physical or verbal interviews.
Hammer’s frown deepens, pouting like a three-year-old getting kicked out of the sandbox. “How long?”
Hammer casts his eyes to the ceiling thoughtfully. “Seven months?” He pins Steve with a reprimanding look. “With all due respect, Cap, I—”
It’s been a while since villains showed up in New York. The last time Tony could remember, Doom had decided to go ape shit and send in his Doombots to terrorize the city a couple of months ago.
So to see Tony willingly lounging in the living room, chatting animatedly with everyone and looking fresh as a daisy puzzles Steve.
He squeezes his eyes shut because he can’t look at her, can’t let her know how much he fucked up, how much he—
In the beginning, Tony chalked it up to nerves. Or wariness. Maybe even initial disdain. It’s not the first time Tony’s been treated in those ways. They always warm up to him, eventually.
“Don’t ‘Carol’ me,” she says, hopping onto the kitchen island and crossing her arms. “How could you?”
Then again, Steve supposes five years is better than another seventy. He doubts he can go through all that again, of the possibility of losing his loved ones to time. Not to mention the fact that the reason he even lost those five years is because of Monica Rappaccini. Monica who was once on the Avengers’ side (or he supposes, used them for her own needs), who captured him to harvest his blood, who kept him hidden from the world for five years. Just the thought of her sends him reeling.
Tony hopes that Steve has the sense to stay far away from the war, that he’s somewhere safe and sound. Happy.
It’s already bad enough that he was rouse from his sleep at two, three in the morning for this. It’s too early to deal with this. Or well, ever.
Natasha flashes him a knowing look, propping her legs over Tony’s. She’s the latest addition to their merry band of misfits, modeled after her Endgame appearance. Which also makes her the worst person to talk to about this.
Tony barks out a laugh, a retort on the tip of his tongue when Steve silences him by brushing his lips against Tony’s. Just like the kiss before, it sets him on fire.
Tony snorts. “I highly doubt that. I mean, he finally got Barnes back after years of moping. He probably forgot I existed by now.”
Steve shakes his head. “If I was on the run, I would’ve shaved my hair off. Or maybe dye my hair blue or something.”
Gingerly, he props the bag of gummies next to the music rack before dropping himself onto the piano stool. He opens the lid and hovers his fingers over the keys.
Steve doesn’t remember drifting off but he finds himself stirring at the sound of retreating footsteps.
The smile gets bigger. That’s when Tony excuses himself to break down inside his car, the scent of sandalwood and vanilla lingering in the air and his smile seared into his brain.
Steve heads over to the cupcakes display, trying to make himself busy by rearranging them. It shouldn’t take long for Tony to pick a card and bail and write to the love of his life—
“Fuck, did you really forget?” Clint gestures around him. “Like didn’t you realize why you’re the only one left?”
Steve doubts any villain would be standing in their kitchen and not committing any crimes besides breaking into Avengers Tower, let alone cooking and humming.
Which is embarrassing. Sure, it’s fake and sure, it’s all Miles and Kamala’s fault. He’ll never hear the end of it from Rhodey, or Pepper, or Carol, or well, anyone else. He’s going to be the laughing stock of the toy community.
Steve tells him about the comics he’s shelved out, how Bucky and Sam finally got their shit together, that tonight a local art gallery is exhibiting his artwork.
Steve crosses his arms in front of his chest. “We do get along, you know,” he points out, sounding like the petty child he secretly is.
The smile he gets in return is brighter, broader but no less pretty. His eyes are a bright shade of brown.
There’s an exhibition at the MoMA being planned in celebration of the superhero community, from the Fantastic Four to the X-Men to the Avengers.
Like usual, they end up grabbing their usual order of hot dogs and milkshakes before making their way over to their usual spot in Central Park.
Sif trades pleasantries with Thor before training her gaze on Tony. “It is a pleasure, Man of Iron,” she says, tilting her head in acknowledgment. “Thor has spoken much about you.”
Heat begins to spread across Tony’s cheeks. He’s grateful for the shitty lighting they have. Otherwise, Steve would’ve definitely noticed how deep his flush is or the yearning emblazoned behind his eyes. Hell, he probably could now, thanks to that serum of his.
Slowly, Tony finds himself growing accustomed to the dates, even though he knows he shouldn’t treat them as real dates.
Steve isn’t one to make a deal out of his birthday. In fact, he rather not celebrate it at all. Despite Tony coming to his defense, the rest of the team insisted on a big birthday bash this time just because he was going to be a centenarian.
“Don’t. I don’t care about all that,” Tony insists. “I don’t. I’m happy the way I am now. I have a business that’s doing fine. I have friends who care about me. And I have you. And that’s all I need. As long as you don’t regret it. Regret everything.”
Once again, all eyes are on him. A snicker fills the awkward pause. Steve makes another note to triple the drills for Clint.
“Great,” Clint groans as soon as the elevator doors shut behind the Fantastic Four. “Clean up duty.” He perks up, his shoulders taunt. “Dibs on not doing clean— Ack!”
On the way home, he curses himself for chickening out again. Then again, there’s always next time. He has time.
Because of course Captain Wholesome America hates Tony. Of course, he loathes Tony with every fiber in his body. Iron Man is good, a better man than Tony could ever be. But right now, he stands in front of Captain America as Tony Stark, a man who’s worse than nothing.
As hilarious as it is to watch Hammer pale and cower, Tony would rather avoid a scandal. Though then again, that’s definitely unavoidable given that one, Hammer’s a snitch and two, there’s probably reporters and journalists moonlighting among the rich and famous right now.
Steve's eyelids flutter, gaping like a fish. Tony would've found it hilarious if his heart isn't tearing itself to pieces.
It’s genuine and warm and full of love, the kind one directs at someone who holds their world in their hands. Never before has Steve seen Tony look at anyone that way. Not even towards Rhodey and Pepper.
Tony clears his throat, his gaze to the ceiling. “Look, can we forget everything that happened the moment I woke up? ‘Cause the last thing I need is Barnes’ fist in my—”
Tony’s as beautiful as the last time Steve saw him. The only sign of aging on his face is the heavier weariness behind his eyes. Despite the front he tends to put up, Tony always seems weary, be it from the all-nighters he pulls or from carrying the weight of the world on his back.
With a heavy sigh, Steve settles down on the edge of his bed before pulling open his bedside drawer and plucking out the box and opening it.
Steve doesn’t know who moved first but before he knows it, there are chapped lips pressed against his, arms snaked around Tony’s armored waist, and Tony’s gauntlet-covered hand cupping his cheek.
No one should look this good after five years. No one should look like a lumberjack and still look this good after five goddamn years.
“So, before we were so rudely interrupted,” Steve continues, “I was gonna say that I’d like that, you know. The date, I mean. I’d like that very, very much. Let me just head to the back and grab my stuff.”
Tony follows Steve’s line of sight, pointed towards a small glimmer coming out from the cracks on the sidewalk. Steve edges closer, getting down on one knee to pick it up.
“It was love at first sight. The first thing I saw when I was defrosted was his eyes. I don't think I've ever been more enchanted.”
They’re in bed when he says it, after another quiet bout of lovemaking, shrouded by the smell of sex and sandalwood and vanilla.
Steve’s gaze falls on him. He’s already dressed down in a tank top and shorts. Tony does his best to avert his gaze.
God, why did he invite everyone from SHIELD and the Resistance over? The Chimera itself isn’t that big. At this rate, it’ll take a miracle to find Steve.
“Isn’t it weird?” Clint asks as the Avengers sans Tony pass Bruce’s phone around. Steve almost crushes the device in his hands at the sight of the picture.
Jesus, how the hell is he going to move on? How the fuck is he going to survive seeing Tony arm-in-arm with his new boyfriend on Monday?
Tony feels the words in his throat shrivel up, all of the memories of the past days, weeks, months, years, flooding his mind.
. Be swallowed up by the honking and the shouting, the cold, by the nameless bodies and neon lights. Swept up in the moment like he’s the nobody he always wishes to be.
“Please. You always act weird whenever Johnny’s around, even during fights.” Tony exhales, running his fingers through his hair. “Look, I know it might be weird having someone who looks exactly like you running about—”
She purses her lips. “We thought you weren't acting on your feelings because you were afraid,” she begins softly. “So we thought that this might give you a push. We all thought you knew he’s pan.”
“Sides’,” Tony barrels on, “you’re a quick learner. I’m pretty sure you picked up a few things from watching me just now.”
Tony steals himself and does his best to keep his mask on for the whole session, charming everyone in the room and swerving the attention away from Steve as much as he can.
Tony puts on a thoughtful look, whistling lowly. “I won't lie, you got me intrigued. Sure. I'll do it. Just name me the time and place and I’ll be all theirs.”
Tony’s well aware that it’s not true. Not all of it, at least. He’s met their comic counterparts back at the toy store he used to live at. Their bizarre closeness had rubbed Tony the wrong way, since he was too busy nursing his hatred for his own Steve Rogers at the time.
But he’s never thought it’ll ever happen. Tony fucking Stark shouldn’t know of Steve’s existence. Tony fucking Stark, son of one of the richest people on the planet and one of the most popular kids at school, shouldn’t know of scrawny, weak Steve Rogers’ existence.
me, Rogers. I will not tolerate Reed Richards’ slander. He is my friend and you will give him the respect—”
Maybe it is meant to be. Maybe Tony isn’t meant for Steve. For all he knows, Steve found someone to kiss, someone he genuinely likes, someone who isn’t a total disaster.
Thor returns the gesture. “I will as soon as I am able. However, not at the moment. I do not wish to intrude on your arrangement—”
Steve rolls his eyes, wrapping his arm around Tony’s waist and pulling him close. “We figured you guys would just hound us about it.”
Steve might've found the comparison amusing, if Johnny isn’t such a hot-headed brash asshole, a self-centered flirt who can’t, for the life of him, take anything seriously. In fact, Steve might've found Johnny tolerable or god forbid—
He still holds onto that thought when that faithful evening arrives. Just as the clock strikes six, a spaceship lands onto the tower’s helipad. A woman dressed in armor steps out of the spaceship, one hand resting on the pommel of her sword, the other holding a bouquet of flowers.
Tony’s phone is overwhelmed with messages and missed calls. His inbox is full of lengthy emails. The press is divided. So is the board.
Steve meets her halfway. Despite her willowy frame, Carol’s grip is steel-like, like she lifts weights. Maybe she does.
So like the idiot he is, Steve spends his time recalling the names and faces Natasha might possibly know and call upon.
Natasha pins him with a look that’s both comforting and knowing. “I can’t tell you what to do. But I do think you should give it a go anyway. Tell him.”
That’s the last conversation he remembers sharing with her. Because suddenly her lips are on his and her hands are in his hair and his are under her shirt trailing higher and higher and—
Steve’s already on the rooftop, sitting on a picnic blanket with a basket by his side. He flashes Tony a broad grin, all canine and bright. In all his six hundred and eleven years of living, Tony’s never seen such a beautiful person be this dorky.
He scoffs, shaking his head. “Nah. No way. Not even if you pay me a million bucks. Which I don't need but—”
So all he can do is hide in the bathroom that was once theirs as Steve packs the last of his things. Tony doesn’t want to know. See the truth of it. He doubts his heart could take it.
This time, someone clearing their throat jolts them back to reality. Fortunately, this time, neither of them end up tumbling to the ground.
If he isn’t a vampire, he probably would’ve chalked it up to him hearing things. Then again, being a vampire hasn’t stopped him from hallucinating and hearing things.
He does keep a diary, several even. His current one tucked behind his encyclopedias while the rest are kept in his bedroom back in New York. As curious and nosy Tony can be, Steve doubts he’d go as far as to snoop around his room.
Once, Tony would’ve chalked Steve’s behavior up to the alcohol. But then he remembers those blue eyes staring him down in the middle of New York, a man with gold running through his veins, and clenches his fists.
“Yeah, yeah. I know,” Tony says, shutting down the conversation. He’s already gotten weird comments from other toys. He doesn’t need anymore, least of all, Steve’s. The less he dwells on the matter, the better.
Steve’s lips part, his mouth dry. It’s a wonder that he could even open his mouth. “You should’ve said something,” he mumbles, taking tentative steps forward, to close the distance between them. “Before.”
Tony wrinkles his nose. “No thanks. You’re one of the last few people I’d fuck. Even if you’re the last person alive, I’d rather die of blue balls.”
Tony sighs, taking a large gulp from his glass. He almost moans at the clash of flavors swirling around on his tongue. The irony of a werewolf brewing one of the best vampire drinks Tony’s ever tasted. “Alright, alright.”
Tony whips his head back at Steve, alarmed. “Wait, what? Did you have nightmares again? JARVIS, why didn’t you tell me? You’re supposed to—”
Tony swallows down a hysterical laugh as the good captain tears him into pieces. Howard was right, after all.
After Miles and Kamala are done bingeing the whole series, Kamala introduces Miles to another animated series featuring Bambi-eyed Tony and chunky Steve and then a movie where ugly Steve and ugly Tony flirt with each other for seventy-one minutes. And don’t get Tony started on the awkward reenactments Miles and Kamala force upon Miles’ toys. Embracing Steve was like embracing a brick wall. Times ten.
Steve couldn’t help but preen at the flirty tone directed at him before quickly reeling his pleasure in. Tony flirts with everyone. It’s how he communicates. Steve shouldn’t be happy about something like this.
Just thinking about the whole thing sets him on edge. The self-satisfied grin on Carol’s face as she downs Steve for the fifty-eighth time, Thor’s roaring cheers, Natasha’s disapproval, and Tony’s—
Steve scowls, annoyed at both Tony and himself. But mostly at himself. This is what he gets for having a crush on his best friend, his best friend who he so happens to work with and live with and knows him in ways Steve doesn’t know himself.
He should’ve been there, should’ve called, should’ve texted, should’ve written back, should’ve asked Tony to run away with him all those years ago, should’ve, should’ve—
“Don’t you get sassy with me, Rogers.” Tony takes a long sip, letting out a low moan. Steve tries to not think about it too much. “Okay, never mind. This shit is good. You’re excused.”
“About time you kids came out with it,” Clint says between mouthfuls of cake. “Felt like you kids were taking forever to tell us.”
“Seven, sweetheart,” Steve corrects gently and wow, that should not do things to Tony’s chest. Nopeity nope nope.
Steve groans. “God, I keeping saying the wrong things,” he mutters before raising his voice. “I thought so. At first. I mean, what else can I offer? I’m just a kid from Brooklyn. No one special. You could have anyone. Why settle for me?”
The feeling of Tony's goatee brushing against his skin, the hint of coffee he tastes, the warmth spreading through his chest. It’s both everything and better than he ever dreamed of.
Party Pooper has the decency to look chastised, his cheeks reddening. He does end up apologizing, albeit reluctantly. A part of Tony bristles at the half-hearted attempt, but Miles seems eager to wrap things up so he lets it slide. For now.
There’s nothing special about Tony’s outfit (sweatshirt, dark jeans, and a pair of high-tops). In fact, it's a getup he's seen on him many times before. Yet Steve’s heart stutters as if he’s seeing him for the first time. At this rate, his heart is going to give out before he could take Tony out.
“That’s one thing but I—” Tony laughs, running his fingers through his hair. Steve has never wanted something as much as he wants Tony right now. “I thought you were straight.”
The rest of the night is spent in Steve’s bedroom, ordering in pizza and huddling together in a pile as they talk about anything and everything.
Steve exhales exasperatedly before reaching over to lace their fingers together. It’s not the first time he wishes Tony would shed his armor, not the first time he wants to know how it feels to have Tony's hand in his.
“Uh, morning.” His eyes narrow as a mug of steaming coffee is pushed his way. It’s not his mug, the standard white one that they have on standby. “Thanks.”
“I thought… I thought I was going to lose you, Tony,” Steve murmurs, giving Tony’s hand a squeeze. “I couldn’t… Please, don’t send me away. Not again.”
With that, every toy in the vicinity hustles over to the toybox reluctantly, muttering and grumbling under their breath. The only two people who don’t seem to mind are Peter, who flashes them both a thumbs-up in turn and a soft and assuring smile from Natasha. Tony’s heart warms at the sight of them.
Now that he thinks about it, Tony probably has told Steve about Carol. Maybe. It must’ve slipped his mind.
This whole night better not be a dream or AIM or some stupid villain playing tricks on him. Because this—this—
Tony wonders if Barnes knows of Steve darkening Tony's doorstep. Tony wonders if Barnes feels the same way about Steve's touch, Steve's kiss. Tony wonders if he’s tasting him on Steve’s lips.
Tony exhales heavily. “I’m not saying it isn’t. God knows that everyone needs all the support they can get. It’s just that we shouldn’t. It’s not right. I may be pan but you’re—”
It shouldn’t be surprising that Justin Hammer would be here considering every single freaking billionaire in the city was invited (thanks a lot, Pepper). But still, that man shouldn't be here at all, no matter what Pepper says.
But then he remembers that Steve’s from the Infinity War line and Tony’s from Civil War and pushes his thoughts away. Steve is stubborn. Steve would think he’s lost his mind.
They take to the street aimlessly, soaking in the present. They pass by shops and cafés and restaurants. They window shop and muse. They whisper and laugh. It’s not the first time Tony thinks of the time before, before everything unraveled.
“Here!” he calls from under the Mercedes he’s fixing up. He rolls out and gets to his feet. Picks up the nearest cloth to wipe the grease from his fingers. “Anything I can—”
A part of him is happy, happy that his friends are happy, that he’s proven his father wrong yet again, that he’s becoming himself again, to the man he was before Howard pushed that glass of whiskey into his grubby, six-year-old hands.
A deep blush starts creeping up Tony’s neck and covering his cheeks, but he doesn’t seem fazed by the action.
And also to absolutely no one’s surprise and Tony’s irritation, Miles brings Steve Rogers along with him too.
But it’s fine. Tony has found someone who makes him happy, right? Maybe it’s for the best. Carol seems wonderful and Tony—
Watching Tony’s retreating form had left Steve feeling cold. It shouldn’t. He’s used to Tony cutting things short with him to handle things related to Stark Industries.
Kamala sags her shoulders in relief. “Gosh, you don't know how relieving it is to hear that. Thank you so much, Tony. You know you didn’t have to do all that for me. I’m just one person.”
“I— Er—” Tony harrumphs, his face a deep crimson and wow, Steve did this. Steve made him blush this intensely. It’s something. “Marry me?”
“Uh-huh. Sure.” Tony flashes Steve a crooked smile. “Well, don’t you worry that pretty little head of yours. I’ll let you know when I’m gonna die. Learned my lesson and all that jazz.”
Tony’s lips quirk to the side, his eyes glinting under the ceiling lights. They’re so much prettier up close. So much prettier, holy shit. They're so
“You do know the party’s inside, right?” she begins as she glides up next to him, a red solo cup in one hand.
Tony snorts, crossing his arms. “Again with that shit. Yeah, yeah. You got me out of the workshop. It isn't something to gloat about.”
He’s debating on whether he should take a quick nap when he hears faint rustling coming from the other end of the backpack.
Fuck, why did Steve even say that? What was the point? He could’ve easily stared Hammer down. H didn’t need to lie at all. He didn’t need to lie about the flecks of hazel in Tony’s eyes when sunlight shines down from the right spot, about how he finds Tony’s sleepy rambles adorable, about how he’s been in love with Tony the moment they met.
But of course, Tony wouldn’t. He’s not dating this Carol. Carol who seemed to have shared the same bed as Tony. Carol who’s definitely wearing one of Tony’s shirts. Carol who—
Someone’s calling his name. It sounds familiar and distant. Tony moves to open his mouth, to answer back. All he can do is gasp for breath.
He’s made Steve forget one too many times before. He can do it again. It’s one of the few things he’s good at.
Tony exhaled, crossing his arms in front of his chest. “Not the point. The point is, we should get married and—”
His mother is thankfully nowhere to be found when he ducks into the back office. She’s probably in the bathroom.
“Well,” Tony says, breaking the silence before Steve could, “whenever you’re ready. I’m here to listen.”
He’s glad it's Natasha keeping him company. She always seems to know the right words and things to say and do. Rhodey and Pepper would just nag at Tony and try to strangle Steve. Thor, Bruce, and Clint are great and all but they’re not the best at things like this. Steve and Barnes are out of the question.
But it shouldn’t be weird, right? Like, they’re just friends. There’s nothing weird about noticing how many gloved hands Steve seems to have and how amazing it is to watch Steve swing himself onto Miles’ desk from the door and—
Steve’s blush darkens. He rubs the back of his neck, his eyes drifting to the ceiling. “Oh. I thought… I thought we could go in together since we’re both supposed to give a speech. So I thought—”
It's stupid how a dumb comment like that sends him spirally. Hell, Barnes didn't sound mean-spirited or anything. He doubts Barnes is capable of being mean-spirited.
So when they come to a stop in front of the tower, Tony braces himself for the other shoe to drop. It always does.
“Your safety and well-being will always take priority,” JARVIS interrupts. “If it means obeying Captain Rogers’ orders over yours, so be it.”
But Tony keeps waking up to an excruciating headache and a broken heart and maybe, the songs had lied to him.
Steve couldn’t be jealous of Johnny Storm. He just couldn’t. Sure, he’d love to be on the other end of Tony’s sultry smiles and honeyed words and heated gazes but he can’t— He just can’t—
They break apart after what feels like an eternity. Steve doesn’t let him go far, resting his forehead against his.
Despite opting out of Operation: Get Tony To Stop Moping By Finding Him True Love, his friends insist on Steve being at every single meeting of theirs. Apparently since he's the leader of the Avengers and the operation is a team matter, he has to be present.
It all happens in a flash. One moment, he’s watching Tony endanger himself, the next, he’s dashing to cushion Tony’s fall.
Tony doesn’t see the kiss coming, tumbling onto his back at the force of Steve’s lunge. Steve always kisses like Tony’s his lifeline and holds him like he’d fade away if he let go. It always leaves him breathless, always gives Tony no choice but to surrender.
Carol seems to ignore Steve’s words, pinning Tony with a pointed look. “I can’t believe you haven’t told him about me.”
“Not my fault you can’t tell the difference between a joke or not,” Tony replies, injecting as much mirth as he can. “How long have you been there?”
Fortunately, Tony doesn’t seem to register Steve’s dejection. “Yeah! Yeah. I was thinking of getting a card and I—”
Ben’s a blast to have around during Game Nights (how he wins every single time during poker, Steve will never know) and while Reed might talk circles around Steve’s head (not on purpose, of course), he can’t help but admire his intelligence, only second to Tony. He doesn’t have anything negative to say about Sue and not just because he’s afraid of losing a limb. She’s a total sweetheart and fun to gossip with.
Tony doesn’t get it. Like sure, Endgame Tony’s helmet can flip open thanks to the button by his thigh. And sure, the armor comes with cooler upgrades (the fact he has an energy blade and a nano shield irks Tony) and sure, age might be a good look on him but—but—
“I’m pretty sure we’re the only ones who noticed.” Tony opens his mouth to interject. Natasha doesn’t let him. “And Fury.”
Tony rolls his eyes. “Fuck, I forgot how pig-headed you are. Now, please get naked so I can hold you and keep you warm.”
The man who pushes Tony against the bathroom stall. The man who pulls him into the nearest taxi. The man who fucks him into the mattress.
“It’s cute to see you blush. Your ears get all pink and you duck your head like—” Steve’s grin widens. “Yup. You’re doing it right now.”
“Good.” Steve gives Tony's palm a light squeeze. “You want to invite the rest of the Fantastic Four over? I’m feeling like showing my guy off.”
He’s angry at first. Of being lulled into a false sense of security. Letting every inch of him love and be loved when he was always second best.
And it’s nice, sharing a couch and greasy pizza as they catch up. During his miserable life in high society, Jan was the only bright spot in all of it. She, with her bright blue eyes and auburn curls and dazzling outfits, and wonderful smile.
Steve frowns but his tone is still a little teasing when he replies. “I didn’t think the thought of us dating would upset you.”
Steve nods, swallowing the last of his hot dog before cracking a smile. “And the time Sam thought it’ll be a great idea to have a picnic together and then you and Clint got into a fight because he stole your sandwich that one time and then that time when you got slammed—”
Tony looks relieved at that, his lips curl upwards. “I don't have a brother so I can't really say,” he snorts. “But I get you. I get that shit all the time with Rhodey.”
But then Kamala’s smile wavers with each passing second and Tony’s heart clenches at the sight of it.
The gala is in full swing when Tony steps into the room. Immediately, he’s overwhelmed by the cacophony of sounds and sights around him - the clinking of wine glasses, the soft chatter, the blinding lights, the people dressed to the nights.
For some reason, Tony insists on going on some weird trip down memory lane. He first takes Steve to brunch at the diner they first ate at, then drives him down to an indie theatre showing the whole Lord of the Rings Trilogy, the first set of modern movies he’s seen, before a quick trip around MoMA where they have spent hours admiring familiar artworks and the latest collection.
Tony sighs, waving his hand around. “I don’t know. I just— Isn’t this something you do with your mate?”
“Not like, right now,” Tony clarified hastily. “I’m talking about, you know. Down the line. Say, five years? Definitely not ten. Or fifteen. Way too old. Uh… Maybe If we’re not dating someone else, we should get married.”
Reed hums. “When Susan first asked me out, I remember being puzzled. She could have anyone but she chose me and she continues to choose to stay with me after everything. After what I’ve done to her. The mistakes—”
He glances over to Steve who also has a shit-eating grin plastered on. “You’re enjoying this,” he accuses.
“Sure,” Tony replies cheerfully, his eyes dropping down to the array of food scattered around their table, most of them Steve’s. “You totally don’t eat more than usual when you’re upset. Nope. No sirree.”
Tony shakes his head, a smile spreading across his lips. “I like you too, you big dork. I’ve liked you for over a year.”
“Then what’s with the cold shoulder you’ve been giving me these past couple of years?” Tony demands, shrugging off Steve’s embrace. “You couldn’t stand the sight of me. I— I know I fucked up the last time we met. I know I coddled you too much. I shouldn’t have done that. Shouldn’t have smothered you. You deserve better than that. But I just— I know you don’t love me anymore—”
This is the perfect time for Steve to tell Tony, to tell him how his heart skips when he’s near, to tell him how much he adores his boisterous rambling and his sleepy eyes and arresting smile, to tell him how his soul longs for him and only him. Time is running out for the both of them, after all.
If he hasn’t been savoring his time with Tony, well, he’s going to savor it so much more now. His borrowed time with Tony might be shortened very soon.
Unlike Steve, Carol, yet again, takes it all in stride. A fond smile graces her lips as she turns back to her pancakes.
Something floods through him but Steve pushes it away before he can figure out what it is. “Then shouldn’t he be here instead of you?”
“Fucking MODOK,” Tony mutters as he shoots another beekeeper down. “Goddamn fucking floating head. Fuck, when I have his ass—”
New York City is a big place. Tony doesn’t even need to try to avoid anyone. He could stride down the street without anyone batting an eyelid or calling his name.
Tony isn’t one for musicals. But his mother had been such a fan of them, especially The Fantasticks, that Tony was practically raised on them.
Hell, the only reason why they’re here or even donating to the foundation is only because they’re huge Captain America fans. Or in Mrs Burke’s case, a huge Captain America
Sharon throws her head back and laughs. “Let it not be said that Steve Rogers doesn’t do anything half-assed.”
Warm light gradually begins to fill the room as Steve shuffles inside. Tony could guess what it must be like to step inside the room for the first time. It must feel foreign, considering he’s a Stark. Starks are all about science, not art.
Tony’s in front of him again, flashing a nervous smile, one that Steve couldn’t help but clumsily return.
They go to many places – diners at the break of dawn, art galleries on quiet weekdays, parks on noisy weekends. Tony’s favorite outings, however, are when they roam the streets aimlessly on nights.
Immediately, Steve crumples the newspaper, strides over to his canvas, and paints a nameless person drowning in an ocean of people, choking on gossip and despair, spiraling as they lose grip on everything.
He can’t seem to look away as Steve and Bucky embrace, can’t seem to spin on his heels and hightail out of the room. Maybe it’s the masochist in him cementing him in place to remind him why he could never, ever call Steve his. It’s already terrible enough that Tony offered to help Steve search for Barnes (he's weak for Steve's smile, sue him). But to be one of the people to help pick Barnes up? To help wipe away the triggers from Barnes’ mind? All because Steve flash those pretty blue eyes of his? All because Tony gave up his pathetic little heart to Steve?
Steve nods, his gaze dropping down to his wringing gloved hands. “True. But, I mean, that would be hypocritical of me too.”
They chatter away with ease as they take their leave. There's an ease in their dynamic, their body language. Like they’ve been friends for years. They might be, considering Tony’s longstanding friendship with Reed Richards. But then again, he hasn't really seen Storm hang around Tony whenever the Fantastic Four cross paths with the Avengers.
Thor brightens as he continues to stuff his face with Cheerios. “There was the once when we fought the Wrecking Crew and you said—”
Steve squashes that thought, returning his attention to the present. “I’m actually pretty proud of this one,” he says, handing it over.
Just as quickly as the anger appeared, it vanishes from Steve's face, replaced with hope and caution. He's looking at Tony as if his heart is in Tony's hands and not the other way around. Which can’t be true because in what world does Tony have Steve’s heart?
“You did not tell me to not tell anyone of this place, sir,” JARVIS replies like the little shit he is. “Captain Rogers had asked after you. Considering that the both of you were in distress, I felt it was imperative that you and he shared one another’s company.”
The living room looks as if a hurricane of Halloween decorations came through. A couple of skeletons with witch hats propped in a corner. A scattered bunch of paper black cats, spiders, and bats webbed to the walls to the carved pumpkins scattered everywhere. There’s even a large banner hanging over the fireplace with the words ‘Happy Halloween!’ printed in orange against a glitter black background.
want to be there when Hulk goes on a rampage.” Tony shakes his head, shoving another mini fruit tart between his lips. “And don’t get me started on the renovations and damages I had to pay for. I think I had to beg the board members to not make me drop the Avengers.”
The air hangs heavy between them as Tony resumes playing, his gaze trained down. “My mom and I usually played together. She’d be on the higher pitch and I’d be on the lower. This piano’s actually my mom’s. Had it moved from the mansion when I moved out to Malibu. Had it moved again when I moved here. Yeah.”
Steve doesn’t even register what’s happened until he feels callused but warm hands cupping his face and a voice frantically yelling in his ear.
), grew out a gnarly beard, and goes by the name of ‘Nomad’. Steve’s a toy. It’s not like Tony could begrudge him.
It’s weird to have Tony flirting at him this blatantly. Not unwelcoming. Just weird. Steve can’t remember a time where Tony did this with him.
She sighs. “I know. It's hard sometimes. To stop feeling that way. But really, talk to Steve. Tell him.”
Barnes’ eyes roam over Tony’s face, sizing him up. A retort is at the tip of Tony’s tongue but he beats him to the punch.
much. There’s not a day that goes by that Tony doesn’t wonder at the what-ifs – what if Steve wasn’t besotted with Bucky freaking Barnes who is insignificant in other media and not the MC-freaking-U, what if Disney and Marvel had competent writers who know their own lore, what if Tony wasn’t such a big idiot pining over someone he can’t have, just like he was in the movie.
Tony doesn’t move a limb until the door shuts behind the kids. When it does, he immediately pushes Steve off him, breaking the kiss.
“You don’t know how much I wanted to kiss you tonight,” Steve murmurs against his lips. He moves to caress Tony’s cheek with his other hand, stroking gently. “And every single day and night before.”
After all, he’s Tony Stark. And Tony Stark always makes sure he has a safety net installed in his armor for emergencies, so it wouldn’t be out of commission before the building decided to collapse onto itself.
As much as Steve’s ravenous and eager for Tony’s company, he’s pretty sure that accepting Tony’s invitation would include having Carol tagging along. And honestly, that’s the last thing—
The melody eventually peters out as Tony’s fingers begin to still, the ache in his heart getting the better of him.
A heavy silence shrouds them. For a moment, Tony feels stupid. Exposed. He shouldn’t have said that. Fuck, he really should’ve kept his mouth shut and—
‘Ours’ become ‘his’, ‘hers, or ‘theirs’, and ‘mine’. Old haunts become memories until the time is right. Nostalgia hits in waves until it just fades altogether.
Surprisingly, Steve’s more put together this time the last time they met. “Mr and Mrs Burke,” Steve says smoothly, shaking Mr Burke's hand. “It’s good to see you.”
He doesn’t get to finish his sentence because Steve’s burying his fingers in his hair and kissing the life out of him.
Tony gets sent to a prestigious boarding school, gets himself expelled after some time, comes home to yelling and Steve.
Tony feels himself wrap his fingers around Steve’s wrist, his heart pulsing against his ribcage and on the brink of ruining everything the both of them have carefully built together.
“Guess we know who she likes best,” Carol remarks smugly, gesturing towards the mini shrine of Carol Kamala seems to have, before breaking into a quiet snicker as she avoids the playful swat Sharon sends her way.
Sometimes he wonders what he did wrong to land himself in this situation, in this era. Not wholeheartedly because the thought of not meeting Tony is just ab—
“I just thought you wouldn’t like it,” he explains when Tony trains his curious gaze on him. “Going on blind dates, I mean.”
Thor's choice is an Asgardian by the name of Sif, a close friend of his. Steve doesn’t know much about Norse Mythology but he swears he’s heard of her before. And not because Thor mentioned her.
Bruce chuckles. Natasha hides her smile behind her cards. Clint looks downright horrified. Steve can’t imagine what his expression is because what the
Steve elects to watch him at first but eventually motions to join him, the tinkle of his keys melding with Tony’s timbre. At one point, he edges closer to Tony’s side, their fingers almost brushing.
Tony doesn't realize his body's shaking until a pair of arms snake around his waist, pulling him close.
“That’s not what I meant. You’re not jealous because Endgame Tony was interacting with Steve. You’re jealous of the relationships all of Kamala’s Steves and Tonies have. You want what they have.”
But the high wears off and Tony’s train of thought returns and all he can think of is his blond hair and soft smiles and softer touches and just like that, he breaks.
Tony ignores the jab, placing his hands behind his head. “The point is, I’m not in love with him. At all.”
If Steve excuses himself up to his room to lick his wounds in his room, no one has to know that but himself.
Tony couldn’t even bring himself to care. After all, he’s engaged to the man he’s been in love with for years and his fiancé loves him back.
Natasha doesn’t even look up from her book to acknowledge him. “Don’t worry. I have just the person in mind.”
His mother rolls her eyes, returning her gaze back to the cake display. “Alright. I know when I’m not wanted anyway. Have fun, boys.”
Tony shakes his head as he unlocks his balcony door and steps outside. There’s no point dwelling on that right now or ever, even. Steve’s a werewolf. And werewolves wouldn’t be wasting time on giving people like Tony a second glance. They’d be focused on finding mates.
He should be happy for them. Sharon’s his cousin, after all. She deserves everything and good. So does Steve.
Steve’s pretty sure his supposed death has a hand in it this time. He’s not sure what to make of that. Neither can he comprehend the odd flicker in Tony’s expression before it’s gone.
If Steve didn’t already know about Tony’s feelings for him before, he definitely knows now. Tony might as well be holding up a neon sign screaming, ‘I THINK I’M IN LOVE WITH YOU’, by the way he’s acting.
Without another word, Steve snatches his mug off the counter and zips off to the elevator, eager to hide in the confinement of his bedroom.
“Of course I do,” Tony mutters. “All of them are in love with each other. My— Our Steve? Zero. Zip. Nada—”
“You should. You deserve them.” Tony glances away before Steve could reply. “These cookies any good?”
“Don’t be silly. Only a fool could not love you. And my son’s no fool.” Her eyes drift down to his acrylic-stained hands before glancing behind her. “You should tell him. When he comes back.”
He’s out of the room before anyone could stop him, making a beeline for the elevators because fuck, he fucked up so bad.
Steve’s lips quirk to the side. “I’m serious. You’re amazing. The best hero I know. No one else could compete with you.”
“I am making sense,” Tony insists as he stares up at Steve, dazed and awed. “You like me. Romantically.”
“Shit. Fuck. No. Steve—” Tony runs his fingers through his hair, desperate and angry because he needs him, needs him to know. “Captain America isn’t the person I fell in love with.”
“I don’t think I’ve seen a red velvet cookie before,” Tony says as he hands a five-dollar bill over to Steve.
Steve cocks an eyebrow, feigning ignorance. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Now come on. Two people down, hundreds more to go.”
Tony couldn’t help but snicker. “Sorry. Couldn’t resist. Wanted to test that super soldier memory and reflexes. Turns out they aren’t as cracked up to be.”
Once, Tony rents the American Museum of Natural History for the whole day. Steve’s frantic when he finds out.
Tony stills, his heart freezing in his chest. Steve seems to share his shocked sentiment, his startling azure eyes wide under the warm sun rays. Tony inwardly curses Hasbro for giving Steve his signature baby blues because, god. Just, god.
“Why’d you do it?” Steve asks as they lie in bed, their legs intertwined. “You could’ve gotten hurt.”
Tony winces. “Okay. Not just that. It’s just good publicity, you know? Apparently, people think that engaged to Captain America is a good thing.”
Dates and sex never go any further than once. There’s no point in them trying to compete with a phantom.
Because this proposition could be a joke. Must be a joke. Tony must be treating this as a joke, or at the very least, a half-heated promise offered as an odd way to comfort. He might not mean anything by it. After all, who offers to marry their best friend just because he’s lonely?
“I couldn’t get you anything before ’cause dad’s always around,” Tony says, holding out his gift. “But he’s not around now so. Here.”
Tony hums, eyeing the motorcycle with approval. “Good choice. Always found people on motorcycles hot. People in leather too.”
All he can think of is that Tony isn’t pressed next to him playing. Tony isn’t cursing and yelling along with everyone else. Tony isn’t flashing that smirk of his at Steve when he overtakes him.
Steve freezes, his brain finally registering the palm pressed against his cheek and the light sting.
“I know what you mean,” he hastily amends. “But… We— Uh, the MCU us. We’ve never… We’ve never been that open with each other, you know? Free, I mean. Not in the way alternate versions of us are. Free with our affect— I mean, l— Feelings. You know, like—”
Tony couldn’t help but snort as Steve zips away. Sometimes, Steve would be reduced to a stuttering mess out of the blue for no explainable reason. There might be an explanation though if Steve doesn’t wear scent blockers.
Hammer barks out a laugh, waving a hand around. “Oh, Tony! Such a comedian!” His eyes roam, taking Tony in with barely concealed want. Tony fights off the urge to squirm. “I should’ve said it right off the bat but wow. You're a knockout, Tony. Absolutely stunning.”
Steve’s leaning against the wall next to the door leading to the Crew’s Quarters, raising a glass in Tony’s direction.
Hammer slides up to Tony during the afterparty of the annual Stark Expo, offering to keep him company for the night.
“I never—” Steve swallows, doing his best to refrain from screaming. “No one’s gotten me a Valentine’s Day gift before.”
Tony takes Steve’s hand in his, his thumb worrying Steve’s ring. “I mean, we don’t have to. We could just tell everyone—”
Tony files that information away for later. He’s one step closer to having a mental breakdown and processing the revelation that Steve’s bisexual wouldn’t help matters.
At some point during the thirteenth round, Tony manages to sneak out of the room. It’s surprisingly easy, considering Clint and Kate are too busy snarking at each other as they shoot down countless holograms.
Jan grins, his eyes shining as she declares, “Well, congratulations are in order. You both finally got your heads out of your asses. I should’ve known the moment you both turned up dressed like that.”
Tony hasn’t even spoken a single word to him yet and he’s already ready to die of embarrassment. Once again, the urge to drink is strong. Which is bad considering he’s going to be two months sober next Thursday.
He doesn’t recognize who it is. Though then again, whoever it is has their back towards him, too focused on cooking what smells like pancakes. The only thing he could register is that the stranger’s dressed in a T-shirt that’s a size too big for their frame and golden blonde hair that comes up to their shoulders.
The first time they go out on a date since their fake engagement is to their usual haunt – a cinema downtown and the diner a block away.
Tony knows he’s saying more, probably trying to let him down gently. Telling him it’s all Steve’s fault. Telling him they’re truly better off this way.
One day, he’s sitting on the couch, watching some stupid soap and a bowl of popcorn in his hands when he realizes that he hasn’t thought of Steve the past couple of days.
“Tell me,” Tony begins, when the food is polished and the waiter has disappeared with his credit card. “When did it happen?”
telling anyone about his size kink. It’s already bad enough his own friends tease him mercilessly about it. He doesn’t need to add Tony to the mix.
Steve mirrors him, pressing Tony closer to his chest, his heart feeling like it's about to burst. “Now you have me.”
Steve felt his stomach churning at that. The thought of actually having Tony close, to have him bonded with him in matrimony, to actually indulge in the hope that this was Tony’s strange idea of telling Steve that he’s interested in him too, is dangerous.
His heart skips a beat when Tony's lips are close to his. It's hard to ignore how kissable they are and how warm Tony’s calloused hand feels in his and how much he wants to—
He knows there’s more to the story, more he needs to know, should know. Then again, maybe he doesn’t need to know. He’s going to die soon.
“I don’t mind,” Tony blurts out. “I mean, we got the rings. And the team’s been calling us married for years now. Not to mention the fact that we’ve been in love with each other from the moment we met. And—”
It’s a great time, overall. It’s always fun meeting new toys and swapping stories with fellow Tonies is always a blast.
Natasha’s features soften but she still doesn’t look convinced. Fortunately for him, she lets it go.
“Sure you can. You definitely can get away with wearing hot pink flannel.” He pauses. “If you don’t wear them with khakis.”
Tonight, he isn’t Iron Man or a member of the Avengers. Neither is he Tony Stark the inventor, the genius, the friend.
Once again, Tony’s blanketed in darkness, save for the dim light filtering from the outside. He could feel Steve settle down next to him, their thighs brushing. Tony barely suppresses a shiver at the contact. “Any particular reason you’re playing on the lower pitch?”
“Aren’t you guys… You know.” Steve flails around helplessly because he’s an idiot. “Aren’t you guys dating?”
“Have fun, boys!” Clint calls over his shoulder. “Use protect— Okay, okay. I’m going. Jeez, Bruce. Chill—”
Tony mirrors him but just as quickly, the smile slips off his face. He blinks his glistened eyelids as his grip on Steve’s cheek slackens. “Jesus, Steve. I really missed you. I missed you so much. I was so lost without you. Those five years… Fuck. Steve, if I knew—”
She’s just a friend he needs around, another friend to keep him sane, to keep him from reaching for the bottle.
Tony should’ve taken a leaflet out of Steve’s page. Move away. Get an apartment. Find someone else to fall in love with. Or at least, move on.
Sif breaks into a grin of her own. “You are much too kind. Ah. Before I forget.” She brandishes the bouquet in her hands. “For you.”
A part of Steve is relieved that Tony would be meeting with Jennifer at the venue itself instead of she coming over. The last thing he needs is to see her waltz up to Tony and watch them chatter about whatever businessmen and lawyers talk about.
Steve hates the swell of joy and hope coursing through him. Just because Tony and Sif didn’t work out, doesn’t mean he has a chance. Tony’s straight, for god’s sake.
“You boys can go ahead,” his mother’s voice pipes up from behind them, jolting them both apart. “I can close up. The sooner Steve stops talking about how gorgeous your brown eyes are, the better.”
Maybe in another life, Sharon and him would’ve worked out. Maybe in another life, Steve’s feelings for Tony wouldn’t overwhelm his feelings for Sharon.
Tony cocks an eyebrow, setting his screwdriver down. “What? Why’re you all staring at me like that? I agreed to it. Isn’t that what you guys want?”
His crush, who doesn’t know about his existence, is going to be standing in front of him in a second and he
Hank speaks after a tense pause. “Steve found out about the messages I sent to Monica about you. Before A-Day.”
Sharon flashes him a smile that is void of bitterness or anger. “It was never that serious between us. Not in the way the both of you were.”
The last thing Steve expects to see when he comes home from his evening run is Tony Stark tangled up in a mountain of Halloween lights.
Something heavy settles in his chest, something Steve knows all too well. Something he has feared all these years of secretly loving Tony from afar.
They lapse into an awkward silence, which is unusual for them. Steve hates it when this happens. They barely even got into a disagreement.
Finally, Tony breaks the tension, his eyes flickering down as he sighs heavily. “Steve— You… You don’t—”
Steve mentally files that information for later. He won’t lie, he’s one of the many people who thought that way. Good thing he’s proven wrong from the source himself.
When Steve gets honorably discharged, he goes back to Brooklyn. Back to a world he barely recognizes.
Carol and Tony finally seem to snap out of their little flirtatious bubble, their eyes glued onto him as Steve gingerly lifts the chunk of marble he’s grasping, the chunk of marble that happens to belong to the countertop.
a journalist asks him once. It’s an interview done via email about an upcoming exhibition he’s participating in. The theme is ‘Love in Color’.
Thor huffs, picking up his video game controller. “I speak the truth and only the truth. Anthony will greatly appreciate your choice of clothing.”
Reed inclines his head. “She loves me. It never fails to astound me that she does. I used to think that I didn’t deserve her, that she deserves better. That’s how you feel now, am I correct?”
A part of Steve knows that they’re trying to cheer him up and possibly distract him from thinking about Tony’s date. But it’s hard to focus on the movie and his friends’ colorful commentary when the space next to him is empty and all he can think about is
When that faithful night comes, Steve dresses up in his best clothes, straightens himself, and braves the outside world.
“You can’t tell me how I feel,” Steve argues. “And I know what I feel about you. I've known for a really long time now.” He pauses, leaning forward to cautiously slip his hands in Tony’s, and lowers his voice into a whisper. “Hey. Look at me.”
It’ll take some time, a lot of time, but Tony’s sure he could get used to being held this way, being loved this way.
He could go back to sleep and hope for the best, hope that his dreams won’t be fueled with painful memories and his worst fears. Painful memories like Pepper leaving him and Yinsen dying in his arms. Worst fears like the world ending and Steve—
“I was,” Tony admits after a wordless puff. “For a while. But then I figured it’d be hypocritical of me.”
“The Invaders were hitting a Nazi convoy not far from where you were held. Fury got hold of us, told us that you lost communication with your team.” Cap ducks his head, pulling away. “He asked me to get you.”
Tony holds up a hand. “Let me finish.” Steve presses his lips together. “We were debating about it a while back so I was like, 'Well, I need proof' and he went, 'Alright, I show you proof'. So we got Nat to spar with you just to see if you'd be…distracted.” A light blush spreads across his cheeks. “It’s hard to argue with what I saw. Even if I had doubts. Lots of them. I still couldn't believe it but Johnny and Nat insisted I get my ass up here and ask you myself and well... Here we are.”
“You got expelled for me. You lied to Howard for me again and again. You ruined your future for me—”
“You know. What he…” The sound of plastic clashing together, followed by a heavy exhale. “What James said. About us not being friends?”
Natasha immediately curls her fingers around Clint and Thor’s wrists, tugging them towards the elevator. Bruce hurries after her. “And there’s our cue.”
And because Reed’s his friend and Tony loves him, the words tumble out of his lips before he can stop them.
A gasp tumbles out of Tony’s lips at the realization. Steve takes the opportunity to deepen the kiss, pulling Tony closer towards him as if he’s eager to meld them into one.
Why Johnny Storm? Why someone who’s blond and blue-eyed? Why someone who’s funny and flirty and confident and everything Steve isn’t?
Clint rolls his eyes, leaning against the doorway with his arms crossed. “I’d take more offense to that if I didn’t know better.” He raises an eyebrow, giving Tony a once-over. “You chickened out again?”
“Of course I was,” Steve replies, wincing immediately after. Tony doesn’t know what to make of that.
Steve shouldn’t be upset. Shouldn’t have been upset. Tony has the right to date anyone he likes. It’s not like he’s dating Steve or anything of the sort. Heck, Tony probably doesn’t even see him as other than his friend, ally, and fellow Avenger.
As always, Steve is early. He takes his usual seat, whips out his crayons, and tries to ignore the empty seat next to him.
To his credit, Steve doesn’t recoil. Instead, his smile widens. “That’s kind of you to say. But I think my boyfriend here is so much more dashing. Wouldn’t you agree?”
“And when you woke up, when your faceplate lifted, I was just— I was stunned at how beautiful you were. Is. And I wanted to know more about you. And I’m just glad that I got to learn how kind and funny and smart and amazing you are.”
Not that Tony is living in a graveyard right now, but the notion still stands. They’ve been going strong for five hundred years. Why try ruining things?
Kamala’s still giggling as she replies, “Wow, I didn’t know Hulk loves them so much. Wish I was there to see it all happen.”
“Dad said no,” Tony replies the day after. “But he’s out of town next week and Mama said I could come over.”
One moment, Kamala’s dramatically having Tony blabber on about how grateful he is to Steve for saving his life and that he missed his stupid face even though he looks like a caveman now and then she’s pressing—
“I know,” Carol says, her smile bright and blazing. She turns on her heel, slipping the pancake onto an empty plate. “But knowing you, you’ll just end up rambling about the time I saved your ass from MODOK—”
It’s only when they’re sitting in the escape pod, staring into the vast depths of the galaxy, does Steve let everything sink in.
He shrugged his shoulders, casting Steve an odd look. “Maybe. One day. Besides, never say never. You guys have gotten back together before.”
He does. She helps him sober up and offers to be his wall for the night. Not for a second does she judge him.
“Why me?” Tony asks when the conversation begins to wind down. They’re at the end of Steve’s exhibit, staring up at a painting of Iron Man floating in space. “Never pegged you as a fan.”
Steve purses his lips. “I enlisted. Or at least tried to. A few times. Got rejected every single time like you said I would. Then, I met this scientist at one of the centers. Emile Erskine. Said he could get me in. Or had a place for me, anyway. It was an experimental program. I could’ve died. But you know how desperate I was to serve.”
It boggles Tony that Hank hasn’t been in contact with his daughter since his escape from AIM’s clutches. Fuck, Tony’s heard of Hope’s implore to the public, offering monetary rewards in exchange for information on her missing father. Hank could’ve at least had the decency of sending a coded message to her. Hell, even a fucking smoke signal would've sufficed. Anything to let her know he’s alive instead of worrying her to death.
This is one of his favorites. Her favorite. It was the first song his mother played to him and taught him to play on the piano. It was their song.
, it says in that scrawl he knows all too well and just like that, his world is turned upside-down once again.
Tony waves his hand. “Don’t worry about it. They’re chicken. Chicks in a blanket.” Kamala giggles at that. “There’s no pork in the food. There's no alcohol in any of the food either. Or drinks.”
Steve smirks, leaning against his doorway with his arms across his chest. “You say this now but wait ‘till I drink all your blood.”
Clint smirks, dropping his cards onto the coffee table to rest his hands behind his head. “I mean, am I right or am I right?”
“It might’ve gotten to a point when you couldn’t,” Steve says quietly. “Howard could’ve snapped and… I didn’t want you to do that. Not for me.”
“I was reluctant, sure. But I could’ve put my foot down. Insisted. But I thought it was the only way I could have you— God, I was so stupid.”
And then suddenly, Tony’s falling. Falling and falling and then suddenly he’s lying on his back, Steve’s broad frame sprawled over him.
for once. Nice to see Steve throwing his head back and laugh at one of Tony’s dumb jokes. Nice to be the center of Steve’s attention for once.
“Do I?” Tony repeats, letting out a short snicker as Steve playfully prods him with his fork. “Besides, you looked like you needed food in you.”
When Steve exits the bathroom, one of the last things he’d expect is to find Natasha sprawled over his bed, reading a magazine.
Usually, Steve would throw on his usual outfit – a T-shirt or a plaid shirt, layering it with a jacket depending on the weather. A pair of jeans. Boots.
He slowly inhales, braces himself, and turns. There’s a soft smile gracing Steve’s lips. The mid-morning sunlight filters through the curtains, casting Steve in a soft glow.
Tony cocks an eyebrow. “I wouldn’t have kissed you if I don’t. I don’t give out pity kisses. Even if they’re pecks.”
Steve’s so screwed. Not only is Tony smart and hot, but he’s also considerate as fuck. It’s a tragedy that he can’t have Tony, more so that he’s going to lose him to someone else.
Tony doesn’t know what to do with that. Instead, he turns away, his gaze glued onto the record store across the street. Steve loves vinyl records.
Tony chuckles, leaning over to press the keys at Steve’s side. He tilts his head, meaning to grin at Steve, squeeze a joke between the notes from across the stool. He’s greeted by a pair of starry eyes and a tender smile. Their noses barely ghost one another’s.
He almost tells Steve this, tells him how annoying it was to hear ‘Winghead’ and ‘Shellhead’ every minute, tells him how much he wanted to squeeze those stupid bobbleheads who wouldn’t stop making squealing noises at each other, tells him that their Legos counterparts are the worst at flirting because god—
Kate side-eyes them and says, “Pfft. Knew that already. Pro-tip, don’t out your relationship to one of the biggest blabbers in the tri-state area.”
Sure, the bullies are rougher and sure, their schedules barely align now. At least now, Tony and Jarvis would wait to take him home. At least now, he and Tony can catch the subway home by themselves. At least now, they can go out to diners and arcades on Friday nights. At least now, Steve can lean over and k—
“What? I can’t be the only one that could feel the tension between the both of them. Which by the way, you can cut it with a knife—”
Tony rolls his eyes, flinging the covers off his body. “I’ll be there. Don’t worry your pretty little head about me being— What?”
“Yeah. But I still hate that I did that.” Hank sighs, running his fingers through his hair. “I’d like to put it all behind us. Friends?”
“She used to own an apartment downtown but back when the gang disbanded, I convinced her to move out since she’s hardly around on Earth. It gets lonely sometimes, you know? So whenever they’re in town, she and Rhodey come to stay with me.” Tony flashes him a meaningful look. “Carol and Rhodey, who happen to be dating each other by the way.”
“Nah, it’s no biggie. Anything for my favorite Avenger. Besides, there are Muslims in SHIELD and the Resistance and well, I’m pretty sure you know I don’t drink anymore.” He leans forward to whisper conspiratorily. “We don’t need everyone getting super rowdy here, anyway.”
Steve wonders how long has Carol and Tony been together. Was it after the Avengers reassembled and Carol and Tony were friends before that? Was it during the dissemble when Carol and Tony fell into each other’s arms? Or was it before everything when Tony proposed that he and Steve—
The good captain looks terribly uncomfortable in his sodden uniform. Tony could imagine how he feels, especially with that ugly cowl plastered to his face like a second skin.
Reed cocks an eyebrow. Tony forgets that Reed knows him way too well. He both loves and hates him for that.
Tony’s eyes drift to the side, roving just like they were back when Tony first laid eyes on him today. Again, Steve feels heat creeping up his neck.
“Uh-huh, sure. Whatever you say. Liar.” Tony takes a chance to bury his fingers through Steve’s hair, amazed at the shiver that he elicits. “This isn’t like… You weren’t caught up in the moment, right? I mean, moonlight and pianos? Very romantic. We could just forget about it. If you want. I can totally—”
“Damn. You thwarted my plan,” Steve jokes, bubbling a laugh out of Tony. “Guess I’ll have to try again later.”
Steve would say something like, “He's the man who revolutionized green energy,” or “New York not being underwater right now? All Tony. He saved the city on his own,” and Tony would be shambles, blushing beet red.
Tony pauses, poking his head back into the laboratory. “Wait. How the hell did you know about the kiss? Let me guess, Nat.”
Steve’s features scrunch up. Confused Steve looks like a puppy. It’s adorable. “Yeah. I mean, you always make speeches at parties like these. What’d you—” He pauses, a smile slowly creeping up his face. “Huh. Clint was right. You did forget.”
Steve’s friends have always told him how transparent he could be with his feelings. If Tony doesn’t know how he feels before, he knows now.
“Danvers,” Steve says shortly, his brow creased. It’s the same frown he shot Reed and Hammer not long ago. “I didn’t expect you to be here.”
Fortunately for them, Thor has enough energy to ease the flight over to the motel. The motel is a cozy little place with a diner attached to it. Steve and Natasha go to get their rooms while the rest of them head over to the diner.
“A splendid idea, Barton!” Thor cries, a little too enthusiastically. “I am certain we would have the most fun!”
How could he think he could ever have a normal conversation with him and be okay? How could he let himself be close to him, be near to him when they’ve turned to strangers?
Steve steals another kiss from Tony, sweet and tender. Tony couldn’t help but smile into the kiss. “For the right reasons.”
He didn’t bother leaving his post from the vending machine. All he did was think about all the ways things could go wrong if he confessed his feelings to Steve like an idiot.
Tony would shoot him a witty remark if he had the strength to. Instead, he flashes him the best smirk he could muster.
Tony nods slowly, as if it physically pains him to do so. “Yeah. James Barnes, right? I think you call him Bucky?”
From the moment they’ve met, Johnny seems to have taken a shine to Tony, following him around like a lost puppy and flirting with him like there’s no tomorrow. It's bizarre. It's not like Tony's friendship with Reed, which is built on science and research. They barely have anything in common, besides their reputations as ‘playboys’.
Steve ignores the sting that hits his heart. Because of course, that’s how Tony knows him. How could Steve forget about his own little reputation? No one ever takes notice of scrawny little Steve Rogers unless he’s getting beaten up.
Steve trails after her, throwing a backward glance at Tony and Johnny as he goes. They’ve taken residence on a nearby bench, their heads bent together as they murmur to one another. Judging by the blush on Tony’s cheeks and the self-satisfied grin on Johnny’s face, it’s saved to say that they’re flirting.
“I love you,” Tony whispers into Steve’s hair. “And you deserve better than being stuck with me. That’s why I’m letting you go.”
Tony steps into the common room, which is almost as crowded as the hangar. Thankfully, he meets a pair of familiar blue eyes across the room.
Tony protects the world as Iron Man and changes the future as CEO and later, Head of R&D at Stark Industries.
“You do know there’s a perfectly functioning elevator, right?” Steve drawls out as Tony lands on the edge of the rooftop.
As much as Steve hates to admit it, but he has to give credit when it's due. Lately, Tony hasn't had the time to let loose and have fun. An amusement park would be a perfect place to forget and indulge in his competitive streak.
It’s gone on for too long. It doesn’t matter what Reed said. Tony doesn’t deserve Steve and Steve doesn’t love him and he deserves better than to be stuck in a loveless relationship.
Tony groans, throwing his hands up. “What’s with everyone with challenges tonight? This is a party, for Christ’s sake. Not a—”
Steve scowls. Scott Summers, one of the last people he ever wants to think of is Scott Summers, especially now. In fact, he’d rather not think about Johnny Storm either.
Tony cocks an eyebrow. “Storm? I’ve never gone out with Ororo before. You know what? If things go south—”
Tony’s well aware of Steve’s short temper. Hell, he’s been on the other end of Steve’s anger more often than he’d like. The thing is Steve hardly loses his temper or even swear, especially in public like that.
Tony straightens. All of a sudden, he looks nervous. Steve can’t remember the last time he’s seen Tony nervous. In fact, he doesn't think he's ever seen Tony nervous.
“Mr Stark is my father,” Tony corrects and god, he’s dialing up his stupid charm that is irresistible to none and Bobbi is falling for it. “Call me Tony.”
When they finally tumble into Tony’s penthouse, he lets a sigh out of relief and undoes his tie. Steve doesn’t take his eyes off him.
As soon as he’s off the dance floor, he sprints out of the ballroom, making a beeline for the nearest vacant balcony. He’s pretty sure Pepper would have his head for hiding. He’s done it one too many times before. He wouldn’t be surprised if she’ll show up behind him and haul him back inside by the collar. Right now though, he couldn’t give a shit.
Steve arches an eyebrow, looking both curious and outright devastated at the same time. “Get along?”
Tony feels himself nodding meekly. “I, uh… Yeah. I think. Uh…” He yanks his head back, clearing his throat. “I thought you hated me.”
Eventually, the party winds down and before he knows it, everyone who isn’t an Avenger is out of the door.
Tony’s heart stutters again at the odd look Steve’s fixing him. It leaves him breathless, ready to pull him closer and press his lips onto Steve’s. To tell him that he couldn’t give a shit if he stepped on his foot for the rest of their lives.
For some reason, Tony seems nervous. Fidgety. Like he’s hiding something, which makes sense since he has another present for Steve. But that can’t be it, right? They always grab breakfast and watch movies and take strolls. This isn’t new.
He averts her gaze, tears threatening to spill from his eyelids. Warmth on his shaking fist forces him to meet her halfway. “He loved you,” she murmurs, her own eyes glistened. “Loves you. Misses you.”
A thought crosses Tony’s mind. He flips Steve onto his back, catching Steve by surprise. Judging by his dilated pupils, it’s also a turn-on. Tony makes a mental note to do it again next time.
Tony’s face molded into something akin to empathy. “Well even if it’s not her, you’ll find someone. Don’t worry about it. I mean, you’re Captain America.”
“I lied,” Steve echoes against his lips. “About the rescue. It’s true that we were attacking a Nazi convoy around here. But Fury didn’t wire us. It was Jarvis. He asked if we’ve seen you. Said that you went to attack a Nazi base and never returned. And I just— I had to find you. I needed to find you.”
Steve hums. “I didn’t know you could play. Or sing. Don’t think I’ve heard anyone mention it before.”
But he remembers the promise he made to himself a long time ago so he goes to the funeral with his head high and lets Bucky and Sam stand at his side as he tries not to fall apart.
“We both know you don’t think that,” Steve replies. “Tony Stark to you is a monster. Iron Man is a hero. A tin can. But you’re wrong. You’re Tony Stark and Iron Man and they’re both two of the most amazing people I’ve ever had the pleasure of knowing. And whatever you say won’t change that.”
“I don’t doubt that,” Tony replies, casting Steve a side glance. “But I’ll admit, I’m actually surprised to find Steve in one piece and not, well, ashes.”
convinced me to make my own ring, because you know, it’s supposed to be more meaningful or something. The ring’s made out of vibranium, by the way. I know, I know. Cliché. And yeah, blue’s cliché. But in my defense, your favorite color’s blue so I thought, ‘why not’? And—”
In some weird and twisted way, it makes sense. Months after Steve disappeared, Captain America made himself known to the world. They’re also both white and blue-eyed. It also doesn't help that Cap's identity is a secret.
Steve’s brow furrows. “Is it so hard to believe that I’d be mad at him for talking shit about the guy I’ve been pining for years?”
“Wait,” Steve says, pulling away from Tony’s neck, “before we go further, I need to tell you something.”
“No,” he says against Steve’s lips. “I— I love you too. I’ve been in love with you for a long time too.”
She flashes him an incredulous look. “Because you’re my cousin. You deserve better than secrets. And I love you.”
“Fuck. No. I wasn’t serious. I just—” Tony focuses on adjusting his watch strap, doing his best to ignore his heart that’s breaking in two. “I was joking. Chill, Cap. Chill.”
As he steps away from the spotlight, the crowd before him shifts, masking Steve from his sight. But Tony has his spot pinned down the moment he gave his speech. He’s pretty sure he’s—
Steve licks his lips, the flush on his cheeks darkening. Tony’s never wanted anymore as badly as he does now.
“Honey, I’ve been hearing this for twelve years. Don’t you think it’s time your old lady’s ears get a rest?”
“I’d never kid about something like that. Ever.” Steve’s thumb brushes the back of Tony’s palm. “All the things I said tonight? Everything I said was true. Is true. I did fall in love with you the moment we met. Your eyes were the first thing I saw and I remembered thinking, ‘Wow, he’s beautiful’. You showed me everything about the world today. You were my anchor when I felt like drowning then. You still are. You make me laugh in a way no one else ever had. How could I not fall in love with you?”
Steve's probably misjudging Johnny’s character. He did the same to Tony once upon a time, after all. But it’s a struggle to look past his bias this time when one: Steve doesn’t have the pleasure (or displeasure) of living with Johnny, two: Johnny seems determined of proving Steve right, and three: Tony seems to prefer Johnny over Steve in terms of romance. Just hearing Tony defend Johnny with such heat, such determination, makes his stomach clench.
That’s when Tony realizes that he’s dressed in a similar manner as Steve, except all in black. As if he isn’t feeling upset enough, this makes him deflate even more.
“Yeah, yeah, it’ll be on me,” Tony interrupts, quickly continuing before Steve could interject. It’s weird how he can be a little too earnest about certain jokes, especially when Tony gets all self-deprecating. They’re just jokes.
Steve shakes his head. “I think I can remember enough to chime in. It was… It was really nice. I like it.”
Steve doesn’t know what to make of that. There are so many questions on his tongue and scenarios playing out in his head. But then, Thor spins a tale of a mishap between him and Loki and then Steve’s too busy drinking in Tony’s laugh to care.
A huge part of Steve is elated. Floating. Soaring. Because Tony meant what he said all those years ago. Because Tony isn’t Carol’s. Because Tony might actually love him back.
He’s not surprised at the endearment. He’s heard Tony call lots of people ‘sweetheart’, including the waitresses at the diner they often frequent.
“You totally are! Sif, Bobbi, and Johnny mentioned that you kept glaring at them. Not to mention how rude you were to all of them. Bobbi was ready to throw hands. Sif and Johnny wouldn’t stop laughing about it.”
Usually when Steve returns from his morning run, the main living room and kitchen are deserted, save for the occasional sighting of Tony grabbing his seventh mug of coffee or Bruce at the stove, whipping up breakfast to feed a whole army. That is, if he isn’t Hulked out. Then, he’d be out like a log.
Steve shakes his head sheepishly. “No. That wasn’t planned. Hank accidentally let it slip that you... And I, uh… Yeah.”
Maybe Steve could protect Tony from his dad if he isn’t scrawny and little. He supposes if he couldn’t stand up to his dad all those years ago, he definitely can’t to Howard.
“I think he had enough,” Tony admits a month before freshman year. “Mama finally convinced him to let me go to school with you.”
“Ugh, you know what. Pretend I didn’t say that.” Tony’s grin melds into something softer, which definitely doesn’t make Steve’s heart skip. Not even in the slightest. “Anyway since we’ve been kicked out, wanna head up to my place? We can play chess or watch a movie or—”
Steve doesn’t look convinced at that. With an eye roll, Tony scoots to one end of the stool. “I really don’t mind, Steve,” he says, patting the empty space next to him. “Really. Lights, J.”
Tony directs his screwdriver in his direction, grinning. “Right on the money. I’m not saying you guys aren’t fun to be around because you are—”
Miles’ smile fades and god, if only Tony wasn’t six inches tall and made out of plastic, he’d shove his gauntlet in that kid’s face. It doesn’t matter if he’s six. No one makes Miles sad.
He comes to a stop, willing his anger to a small ember. Tony shouldn’t be upset over this. It’s out of his hands. It’s Hank’s prerogative if he wants to keep Hope in the dark.
Steve’s lips tug to the side, eyeing him with hope. “I mean, I’m guessing you feel the same way too? Hopefully? I mean—”
“You sound upset,” Steve counters, sounding serious now. “If you want me to stop, I can. I would’ve stopped if you told me before. We can go back in and tell everyone the truth.”
Tony should feel at home here, surrounded by the riches he grew up with. But watching Steve squirm in his seat, watching Steve stare down his cutlery like it’s going to stab him in the eye, makes him feel so goddamn uncomfortable.
“Sorry for the tardiness,” Tony says. He juts his thumb in Natasha’s direction. “Blame her for the holdup.”
He glances around, blearily blinking as he takes in the pile of blankets and tangle of limbs. The credits are rolling on the screen. Carefully, he turns the television off, pulls the covers aside, and quietly shuffles away.

“What the hell?” Tony exclaims, staring at the empty space where Steve once stood. He cranes his neck above the ocean of people in for any sign of Steve. Somehow, he’s vanished into thin air.
