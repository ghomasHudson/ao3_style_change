"Calm down jeez stop taking everything to seriously I just said friends and you and Rhodey are my person you know so chill nothing to worry" Tony replied.
"There is a No list?" Tony asked and Peter just nodded. He turned his head towards Nat and she gave him a strong glare and he knew it wont work. Carol wont be affected even if he made his puppy eyes. He could see Barnes laughing at him and he threw grape at him.
"Hi Tony we were wondering what will you like for dinner? I will be cooking tonight" Sam asked. Sam knew Tony was a good person at heart and after he knew what happened in Siberia he did not blame him at all. He knew anyone would have reacted that way. Somewhere he was disappointed in Steve but he knew the damaged had been done.
They reached the tower soon. Happy was driving Laura and Nathaniel, whereas, Tony was driving the other car which had all the kids including Peter.
Steve seemed in a good mood and Tony thought that it seemed like a nice time to bring shield up. "Babe, I made something for you look" Tony said moving away from the bench. The shield had a new design and a new colour. It was red with a capital 'A' in the middle representing Avengers. Tony just stood there waiting for Steve's reaction. Steve just sighed and turned towards Tony "Tony I really appreciate this effort but you know I cant" Steve just looked down. He was disappointed in himself. Tony moved forward and took his face in his hands and forced him to meet his eyes. "I am sorry I did not mean to make you upset but you dod not know how I feel when you are out there without this. I know you are capable of handing yourself but this is a aprt of you like the suit is a part of me. Please Steve" Tony said.
"Pete you ready to work in the lab" Tony said and Peter was smiling. They both went down talking about the nanotechnology and suits. A few minutes later Barnes went down and saw Tony and Peter busy.
"This feel so much light and it feels like there is still blood flowing through it" Bucky smiled. He was so grateful for this.
"Reminds me of old times" Steve whispered.
"How is everyone else? Pete saw me like that is he okay?" Tony whispered making sure this conversation wont wake Steve up. He was worried, he did not want Peter to see him so broken.
As soon as Bucky was out everyone move towards Tony. He was still struggling to breath and Rhodey was making everyone back out so he could have some space.
"Carol can I speak to you for a second" Steve asked.
"Guys this is Dr Stephen Strange. He is the Soccer Supreme also the Mater of the Mystic arts" Tony introduced him
"How bad is it doc?" Tony asked.
"Guys they are on their way to the tower, all I know is that there was an explosion and I want you guys to check up on others. Nat check up on Clint he isnt in the tower and probably went for a vacation, Sam can you check up on Scott and Stephen can you check up on Peter?" Tony turned towards him. They all nodded and Nat and Sam left. Strange just stood there and touched Tony on his shoulder comforted him and left. Bruce, Wanda, Vision and Steve stood there.
"I spoke about you being in the room with me for Bucky I know you were upset-" Tony was cut off by Steve.
"Yeah baby its me you were having a nightmare calm down you need to take deep breaths okay. I am going to take your hand and keep it on my chest so you can follow my breathing pattern and count with me okay?" He gently reached for his hand and suddenly all he could remember was Steve slamming his shield into his arc reactor.
Bucky couldn’t put his finger on it, and Steve, the lump, hadn’t even seemed to notice. Yet something smelled off, too sweet, too sugary, and Tony had never been so absent in the time Bucky had known him.
“Tony, it’s fine. I didn’t mean to–”
Tony almost misses Steve’s whisper of a response. It’s so quiet and gentle, so unlike the Steve he thought he knew. He’s been expecting Steve to be angry, because Tony’s failed, again, and with such a heavy cost.
He slips a thumb past the rim and tugs, stretching wider so he can fuck Tony on his tongue like he means it.
“What’s that supposed to mean?”
“Hi,” Past-Steve whispers against Tony’s mouth, nosing at his jaw. “What are you doing down here? You’ve been gone for hours.”
“I’m not sure I’m going to make it back, Steve.”
He breezes out, leaving Tony alone in the middle of the massive circular room, chairs askew and quiet as the dead. The ache in his chest flares with heat and radiates down his arm. Numbness follows, prickling quickly along the tips of his fingers and bile rises in the back of his throat. There’s a very, very good chance he’s going to be sick.
“I wasn’t focused.”
The morning bled away into midafternoon and Steve left Bucky to his workout, losing himself in the comfort of his sketch. As colour flowed between the sharp black lines, Steve smiled and finished his work with a neat signature across the bottom right corner.
“I don’t know,” Steve answers honestly.
In the beginning, it had helped. He still hadn’t slept, but he had survived.
In the crowd, Tony sees a vision of Maria, dressed in emerald green with pearls around her neck. She gives him a sad smile, rife with pity and unspoken hopes and dreams but when he blinks and glances back, she’s gone and an old woman in a sea of grey fabric is sitting at one of the extravagant tables in her place. Something sad and hollow strokes a hand down his spine and Tony avoids looking at Steve when he drags his eyes away from the Avengers at the signing table and listens for the cue at the end of Steve’s speech.
The pungent smell of sour milk curdled through their apartment for almost an hour as the clock crept closer to eleven and Tony still hadn’t returned. It was giving Steve a headache, and desperate to sooth his mate and bring out that beautiful scent of clotted cream, Steve had forcibly pinned Bucky down to the couch.
“I love this kid, Stark!”
Steve is immobilized in the automatic restraints keeping him secured to the armchair, the visor over his eyes hiding his face. There’s a distorted grimace smeared across his face, his jaw clenched tight, and his hands are shaking where they grip the arms of the chair. If Steve had truly wanted to, he could have been out of his seat in a flash. The restraints weren’t meant for anything more than a gentle reminder not to move and jostle the visor when the participant was immersed in the display.
What the fuck?
Hope and a deep, unwavering love blooms across Steve’s features, his cheeks flushing with delight and a metric ton worth of relief. Reaching out to him, Steve pulls Tony into his arms and holds him on the right side of too tight.
The look Steve is giving him alone, guarded but openly hopeful, is enough to make his stomach rebel.
“I don’t want to talk about it. I want to do something about it, and I need you to tell me everything you know about your buddy’s whereabouts.”
“Well what are we gonna do?” Bucky demanded, letting Steve lead him by the elbow back towards the elevator and up to their shared floor.
“So you’ve said,” Tony’s lip curls up at the side and he offers Steve a sad, sardonic little smile. “It doesn’t change anything. It’s not enough anymore.”
God, Steve is so beautiful.
Every time he gets close, Tony backs off, keeping him braced against the desk while his eyes droop closed and the body that’s long since gone limp under Tony’s hands slumps forward again and again.
Tony stops listening.
Soon he was going to feel that in his
Barnes stands apart from them all.
“Hi, Tony.”
Tony huffs. “Don’t make promises you can’t keep.”
Palm trees disappear like a sea of green below them, between the road grids and buildings. The clouds are close enough that Steve could reach out and touch them, and the wind is frigid against his face but the sun is high and warm. The ocean stands out against the horizon, and Tony could keep going. They could keep going forever just to see where the ocean ended at the curve of the edge of the world.
For a moment, Steve paused, trying to steady his thoughts and avoid taking Tony the way he had longed for every lonely night in Wakanda. Steve wanted to
It flared hot in his stomach when Tony was bent over his arm, performing routine tests as he made his way through the third model, he’d created for him. That smell surrounding him, drawing him in like a ship in the night.
Tony’s head jerks up to something off the recording, and Steve watches, ripe with sadness, when Tony’s face brightens into a smile. A cup of coffee appears in Tony’s outstretched hand, and Steve sees himself step into focus with arms already reaching to wrap around Tony’s waist and tug him out of the chair, reeling him in.
At that moment it feels like it’s just the two of them in the room, despite the gaggle of Avengers old, new, and Rogue, more bureaucrats than Tony can shake a stick at, and a half dozen high-security spectators. Ross’s scowl deepens but it’s better to meet him head-on.
Some of it was real.
And Tony believes him. Just like that.
“Oh fuck,” Steve mutters, getting a firm grasp on Tony’s hair and pulling him in. He starts to move his hips, just little hitches into his mouth until Tony flicks a look up at him again, and it’s all the permission Steve needs.
They stumble into one of the hallways of guest suites, more than Tony had ever needed or would ever need, and JARVIS agrees to ensure they aren’t disturbed though there’s a reluctance in his tone that Tony shrugs off.
The thought that maybe Tony had died not knowing how much Steve had loved him curdles in his belly and he forces it away. There has to be another explanation.
A dark, uncertain thought creeps into the back of his mind, remembering how Steve had gazed out into the horizon only minutes earlier.
Steve quirks an unusual smile, the right corner of his mouth quivering before it tips up and he shoots him a genuine flash of teeth.
Bucky knows him better than Steve.
Bucky stripped out of his shirt and boxers, gloriously naked before crowding back over him. The gland at the curve of his neck was swelling slightly where it could beneath the metal shoulder joint and Tony traced a finger over it, eyes heavy.
“It is true! Tony, I know you.” Steve looks torn somewhere between furious and devastated and, well, they’ve always been two sides to the same coin, haven’t they?
Steve doubles over from where he’s collapsed to his knees and retches onto the pavement. Natasha tries to wrap an arm around his shoulders but he shoves her off with too much force and sends her sprawling backward, not processing what she’s saying. What does it matter? What could she possibly have to say to him now?
“It’s not going to be like that, and you know it,” Steve says with a stubborn purse of his lips. “You’ll be back at the Compound in a month and this is going to happen all over again.”
There’s a long pause before a firm whisper, “no, you haven’t.”
Happy averts his eyes and turns around, feigning an alert on his phone needs attention as he coughs and wipes at the corner of one eye. “Of course, Boss.”
Bucky and Sam pull up the back, a hand on each of his shoulders.
Steve took the plate with him, wandering down to the workshop. The door didn’t immediately open, and though he loathed to use his override codes unless absolutely necessary, it felt like the right time. He owed Tony an apology.
And then Steve went silent.
“Don’t, you’ll upset him.”
“It’s not.” Steve searches his useless brain for some sort of explanation but there’s nothing he can do to explain this away. There’s no way to know how much Bucky has seen. “I’m just—I’m trying to figure out how to let him go.”
“Tony, I am sorry. I love you, and I know you know that.”
. Steve stumbles backward but takes Tony with him, arms immediately coming to wrap around his waist and pull him in despite his grunt of pain.
Nothing will ever be the same. After all their options run dry, they stop talking. It’s been days, and Tony hasn’t said a word.
Tony pulls on his clothes then crosses his arms over his chest. “What is this, Rogers? You die and
Tony knows that he’s not fighting fair, and Steve plays right into the palm of his hand. “I want you. God, do you have any idea how much I want you?”
Hot kisses punctuate each word before Tony nips at his earlobe, and a hand drifts down to grip him through his pants, squeezing him with a firm grip until Steve’s gasping and shoving his hands down the back of Tony’s jeans to draw him in. They fall into an urgent, desperate rhythm with Tony’s breath ghosting over his skin, and Steve can’t remember a day in his life better than this moment, right here.
In the distance he could see it—the ship. He’d done it! They’d made it. They were going to be alright. They were going to live!
How would Steve know? Last night they hadn’t even talked at all.
“Tomorrow?” Tony’s willing to bargain. “Talk tomorrow, I promise. Promise, Steve, I swear. Come on, sweetheart, please. I just want to feel good, with you. I haven’t felt good in so long. After we can talk until, you’re sick of hearing my voice again. I promise.”
“Shut up! Shut up JARVIS. Fuck, fuck, fuck. Steve!” And then Steve was falling, limbs limp trailing behind the rest of his body as the water reached up to welcome him to its depths. “No!”
“Sir, if I might interrupt?”
“I love you.” Steve brushes the hair off his face and to Tony’s distress, he slows down. Steve kisses the corner of his mouth, the edge of his jaw, dipping lower to suck a light bruise into his throat. The urgency dissolves and Tony’s cock doesn’t know what to do with this new development, still straining up seeking contact and the warm hollow of Steve’s abdomen.
Tony huffs out a breath. “Not the way you think you do.”
“You didn’t really give me much of a chance, Tony.”
A hint of teeth scraped against his sensitive rim leaving him gasping and shoving at Bucky’s shoulder. Tony was rambling, repeating his name and rattling closer and closer to begging him to just move, get inside him. Give him something more.
Tony’s eyes flick frantically between Steve’s. His pupils are blown black and wide, and oh. Tony’s drowning in them after all.
There’s a particularly impressive bite mark over one of his nipples, and hickeys sucked into the top of his chest, no doubt scaling higher up his throat. He’d forgotten what a force of nature Steve could be in bed and Christ, how he had missed that.
this. He deserves to feel numb and forget, just one night, before everything changes. In mere hours, everything will be painful and difficult all over again and right now, relief is as simple as a sharp, tight burn down the back of his throat.
For the briefest of moments, he wishes the end of days could hurry along so he can move on to whatever comes next. Whatever that might be. Anything except this limbo where everything hurts and nothing makes sense.
“Bruce is pissed all the time and does a fine job.” Tony takes a look at the point, then misses it on purpose.
Pepper is quiet for a brief moment, giving him a calculated look before her gaze flickers over to the pile of letters. There’s no way she doesn’t know, because most are marked in the top left corner, sharp handwriting spelling out the return address of
“They won’t find me here,” Clint promised, but Tony was already on his feet and running to the east-facing window. He pushed the shutter out just enough to peek out over the horizon. The night was dark and the wind treacherous; nobody would be foolish enough to approach his little cottage this night.
Steve levelled a withering look at him. “You want to help the man who outlawed kissing?”
Tony half expected Steve’s lips or his tongue. He hadn’t expected Steve’s
Warning: mention of past trauma (physical, sexual, emotional). Sexy-time tags apply here.
“Home with you,” Steve echoed in agreement. That was where he wanted to be, back home where he could sleep in Tony’s arms and they were safe. Steve would never let all they’d built slip from his hands again without a fight, but for now, all Tony said he had to do was sleep. So he settled in, let go, and let sleep carry him home.
The paper was of fine, weighted stock, and had a subtle scent of Bergamot.
Hay duty took no longer than an hour, but by the time Steve made it back to Tony’s room, he was tired and his body ached in disturbingly unfamiliar ways. Howard’s words weighed on his mind, and the two ring boxes in his pocket were bloated with too much shame to carry, but he managed to shuffle into the room all the same.
“Did I do good?” Tony mumbled under his breath once he could see and hear Steve again. Steve smiled in surprise  - how he was still awake enough to speak after all he’d been through was a mystery. Clearly, the answer to his question was so important to Tony that he needed to hear it before allowing himself to rest.
“Is that before or after you ‘expose’ Rogers?”
Steve had not yet regained full motor control of his body, but he fought to lift his arm and pull off the heavy cloth covering his eyes. Tony dropped his jacket over the Captain’s lap at once and rushed to put pressure on the cloth covering the his eyes.
Tony released his arms and guided them under the blanket. He left Steve to rest for a minute or two, and when he came back, Steve’s senses filled with that familiar lavender scent of the anointing oil. Tony cradled Steve’s neck in both hands, and with the firm, steady pressure of his thumbs, he worked the tension out of Steve’s neck and shoulders until Steve was no better than putty in his hands.
“I will sleep over the covers,” Tony explained, already getting up to adjust his robes before walking to the unoccupied side of the bed. He was about to get in when he noticed Steve’s handiwork rumpled on top of the bedspread. The sweater Steve had started hours ago was tied off and finished, and Tony held it up with blatant admiration.
. Steve shook the thought away aggressively, swallowing down the nausea.
“Who makes that kind of a call on April Fools!” Tony all but shouted before Steve could get his hands on the proverbial wheel. Steve’s quiet, contained snickering burst into outright laughter, and with a dirty look, Tony made a big show of scooting his chair a few inches to his right to put more distance between them.
“I like that!” Steve said with a big smile, “he’s incredible, yeah. I’ll call him tomorrow so he knows, or you know, I guess, ask if he’ll have availability then.”
“It's not him, Buck,” Steve said with a sigh. The interdepartmental task force pulled together for this investigation had officially been turned over to him forty hours ago, and Steve needed to finish delegating responsibilities and familiarizing himself with update memos before he could get to his own part of the investigation.
She nodded to herself as she processed his list. “Speak up in Hawley’s class, she likes people with an opinion. For Donovan, try to get a seat in the back. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability. And for Levinson, make sure you read the footnotes. That’s where a lot of her test questions come from.”
“Whoa, buddy,” he snickered, more tickled than bothered by Tony’s minor meltdown, “did you give your car to the wrong agent or what?”
At first Tony was absolutely silent in his surprise. For a man whose only physical contact had been limited to family all of his life, being so intimately touched confused him deeply, until it was over. Then, more than in his first moments of shock, did Tony recognize what he wanted.
He pulled out the pan of cinnamon rolls out of the oven and sat it down on the marble counter. Giving the frosting a final few turns with the whisk, he turned it out over the pan to all but drown the rolls in the maple frosting.
“Sorry, darling,” he whispered, leaning in to kiss the bridge of Steve’s nose. “Didn’t mean to wake you.”
“I work for the government,” Steve said, casting around for answers that Tony might swallow. “It’s classified, but mostly my job is… dealing with international negotiations that other people don’t want to deal with. It’s tedious, but I get great miles.”
Steve wasn’t entirely sure what a hog was, but by the look of concern on Tony’s face, he assumed Babe wasn’t an accurate reference point.
“No, Tony, not all of them,” Steve promised, and finally, carefully, released Tony’s ankles. He helped him lie his legs down at last, giving Tony time to find a comfortable position before taking Tony’s soft cock in hand.
“First of all, the gifts you give me I can’t wear on a daily basis,” Steve started, and before Tony could argue, he quickly added, “and second, you’ve always had something of mine. That’s how I like it. In college it was hickeys. Then you wore my dog tags. You don’t know how hot that makes me, Tony, seeing you wearing them. But then that summer you were going out into the real world with people like your dad and his shitty business partners, and hickeys and dog tags didn’t feel like enough. The only way this ring would make me happier was if it was on your finger, sweetheart,” he admitted ruefully. “I don’t care about a marriage half as much as I want the world to know you’re off the market. That you’re with me. If they want to touch you, it’s through me.”
“What, cause he’s pushing 50 and still has an eight-pack? Sure,” Tony conceded, because he’d just made his own point. “He’s smart and charming and sexy and single-handedly responsible for employing half of Gotham. But he’s kinda sketchy, don’t you think?”
Cold or not, the eggs tasted better than anything he had eaten in a long, long time. The very best part about the eggs was that Stephanie had made them for him, and he cherished every bite.
It wasn’t until Tony was hauling his two duffle bags, computer bag, parka, and rolling suitcase through several inches of grimey snow that it occurred to him that he might have overpacked. Grouchy and irritated, and so very, very cold on his walk from the curb to the steps of the apartment, Tony was sorely tempted to dump everything in the dirty snowbank and find a ride back to the airport when Steve appeared in the doorway like the hero in some fever dream.
“You have a fiance?”
Sharon clicked the first link that popped up, something called
“Second, hell no,” Tony continued emphatically. “We’ve been dating for five weeks; this is not a marriage. I’m not buying a fucking pot.”
“Did you just say ‘busy’?” he asked quietly when Steve reluctantly pulled back to listen.
“You had a long day, sweetheart,” he whispered. “Stay in bed, I’ll come eat with you.”
“The second chance you gave me wasn’t genuine, Tony,” Steve reminded him, quietly. “You were going to use that conversation for your article. I shared parts of my life with you that I, that I don’t tell people, Tony. I trusted you.”
The audience lifted in cheerful applause, drowning out the sound of Tony’s racing heart and his lingering anxieties. On set, the cameras were there to capture your character, or whoever you were trying to bring to life. You could play around, you could make shit up, but there was nothing to hide behind during talk shows. Millions of Americans were tuning in to see
As if needing the confirmation, too, Tony glanced down at his own hand. “I think we did. But it’s okay, Steve,” Tony said in a gentling tone, doing his utmost to ensure Steve that he didn’t need to worry. “Nobody knows about it, we can just keep it quiet and file for divorce on Monday.”
No warnings apply. Here be sick Steve (most likely Bucky's fault).
Steve spun around on the bench to see Brock walking up to them. “Brock, hi! I,” he stopped talking immediately and turned back to the redheaded woman visibly studying his fiancé without saying a word. “Thank you again, I really appreciate all you shared with me. I hope I see you again!”
“And can bench press me without breaking a sweat,” Steve added, this time to the delighted shock of the audience. Steve gave them a look, as if to say ‘no, but
“No problem,” Steve promised absently. Then, after a short beat, he quietly asked, “How’re you? What’s it like being Dracula?”
The only difference was, Queen Sarah never told him what to do: Tony had made intentional changes after seeing her, and he chose what to adopt and what to leave out. He couldn’t take that power from Steve, and, selfishly, he would never see the leader his husband could grow to be if he went back on his word now. In so many ways, going to a crowded and badly lit Christmas market without security was the worst idea he had ever heard. But not all of Tony’s decisions would ever be as easy as the choice between respecting his husband, or fearing the remote (and admittedly infinitesimal) possibility of being assassinated in his own city.
Steve gaped back at him like a drowning fish, until he dropped the act with a big sigh. “Closer to eight, but sure, whatever. You made your point.”
“You remembered,” he whispered, quiet in his disbelief.
If Tony had any remaining concerns about how the night could go wrong, he was no longer able to communicate them. His lips were parted in silent wonder, and Steve kissed him soundly one last time before pulling away to help Tony to his feet. Wandering hands and kisses turned the short and simple walk to the front door into a whole procession, but finally Steve sent him off with the waiting driver and watched him go see a life-long dream come true.
“Your cello solo last night was inspiring,” they heard him tell one of the women. He sounded hopeful and overeager as he hesitantly asked her out; blood in the water for most overachieving women. Steve and Maria slowed to a halt in the shadows and listened as the women laughed and called Phil a dork.
“For what purpose?” Bruce cautiously asked, though Tony had already jumped up in his excitement. He clipped on his polished badge and picked up his gloves, then hovered at Bruce’s desk, eager and brimming with energy, until his partner gave up and stood to join them.
“Enhance your calm, Jane Foster,” Tony said gently, giving Jane a moment to gather herself. “In another time, in a world much different than ours, they were as real as you and I,” Tony promised her then in a calm, sobering voice. He might understand why a guardian might want their child to believe such hatred could not occur in the human mind, but Jane was an officer of the law. Soon, Jane would be invited to a stewardship and mature to gold class adulthood. She deserved to know the truth.
Steve gave him a strangled look. Sometimes he wished there was a third person around just so he could have someone to validate him. “Tony, even Donald Trump’s done it.”
Tony didn’t say anything for some time. He continued leaning against Steve’s side, resting his head on Steve’s shoulder while they observed the spectacle.
As if on cue, a seating chart was passed to Steve by the girl on his left, and he realized with a rising concern that he was signing to make his front-row seat a permanent commitment. Steve was still signing in as he felt the attention in the room shift towards him. He looked up, and once again Professor Stromwell was staring back at him.
For a second, Steve was lost. A show? He slowed his hips again, not sure if Tony was hurt and needed to show him something. They were building to the inevitable release, and as tough as it was to stop, Steve pulled out ever so gently and watched his cock slide out of Tony’s ass with great care to be sure there was no signs of bleeding.
Tony’s face lit up with delight, and he got to his feet at once. “If that will make you more comfortable, I will endeavour to do so for the time that we have sex. Allow me to get ready.”
“You’re not wrong,” Tony said quietly, keeping his voice low and his tone gentle so the dog wouldn’t notice a change, “but I’m pretty sure I’ll need your number for that.”
“His name is Captain Steven Grant Rogers, retired from the US Army,” Tony whispered with reverent wonder, staring at his computer terminal with unblinking eyes as he absorbed every ounce of information from Captain America’s case file. Under the circumstances, he had been provided with exceptional clearance to read all the recorded information about Steven G. Rogers - everything that he’d never had access to before. He read the available facts about his life from the 30s and 40s in the 20th, and also later in the 10s and 20s of the 21st. Some information corroborated the legends Tony had studied, while others defied them entirely, but either way, Tony was spellbound by all he was learning about his greatest hero.
“Scraps are not like us, Steve Rogers. They are people who have elected to denounce Governor Alexander G. Pierce’s generous and inclusive way of life. Not one of them would be turned away should they register and assimilate to the Governor’s rules. They would never know hunger or thirst. Instead they choose to live underground, defiling our government buildings and pilfering scarce commodities.”
“This is stunning, Steve Rogers,” he whispered, turning it over in his hands. “The attention to detail, the craftsmanship—you truly are a gifted man.”
. Steve, they call physics on Wednesdays.”
Steve held up his small bundle of shortbread biscuits then gestured for the unoccupied chair. “There are no other seats. Cookies for a chair?”
“‘Tony Stark, World Champion Bareback Rider, 2004,’” Tony recited without having to look. Steve’s grip of his waist tightened, and Tony pressed his hips forward to indulge Steve’s greedy hands. “My first world championship prize. The rest are in drawers with the other stuff, but this one’s my favorite. I was so damn nervous,” he sighed to himself, almost as an afterthought.
“Ever the gentleman,” Tony said with a put-upon sigh, and when he passed Steve to join the short line of remaining first class passengers, he made a show of a haughty, exaggerated sniff. “Make sure your eyes stray, Sparky. Don’t let this show go to waste.”
“If you will have it, madame,” he said with a smile, briefly getting up to help Agneta reach her glass of water when she stretched for it. In an effort to help her get comfortable, Tony started the conversation. “I notice your preferred language is not Cimbri. How long have you lived here?”
Tony followed his pull easily, nuzzling into the crook of Steve’s neck, where he took a deep, steady breath. If he wasn’t careful, his feelings for Steve were going to spill right out of him, and he couldn’t afford that. It was just too soon. Steve was really rolling with the punches, but some things needed time, even if he didn't.
and he didn’t have a costume of any kind. What was an acceptable costume anyway? Didn’t masquerades mean fancy dress like Louis XIV and Phantom of the Opera? And here was Steve, perfectly average bachelor with no eccentric flair who didn’t even have white bedsheets to cut up for a ghost costume.
“And you don’t think the rest of your family gets star-struck? How would you keep it together when you’re having breakfast next to Spider-man?”
If only it was that easy.
“Nothing,” Orfeo whispered, then very carefully reached under his blanket to pull out a soggy bag of ice. Judging by how he’d pulled it out from between his legs, Tony could only grimace to himself in sympathy.
What was
With the party in full swing, Tony hauled his gift-wrapped partner off the dance floor, through the mingling crowds of networking semi-professionals, until they came out into an unoccupied hallway unseen.
“You,” Tony gasped, touching Steve’s face like he just couldn’t believe what he was seeing. “Are—you’re real,” he whimpered, and then he couldn’t stop touching Steve, from his broad shoulders to his tapered waist, to his long, thick erection that was unlike anything Tony had ever seen. And the camera was supposed to add ten pounds, so that was saying something.
“Tony, where…” he breathed, staring at him and the four bodies littering the floor. “Where did that come from, Stark?”
Speaking in Cimbri was funny, in its own way. All other languages Steve had studied and practiced were learned with the finest tutors available to the crown. Native speakers and specialized linguists coached him on how accents and mannerisms conjured different social connections in each culture, and he spent days memorizing which to adopt and which to avoid. While Steve modeled most of his accents after Tony, whether in German, English, or Spanish, his tutors always impressed the importance of perfect elocution, mindful vocabulary, and polished accents no matter what language or message he shared.
They got the steak, they made it to Tony’s place, but they never got to the movie.
? On two hours of sleep?”
To Tony’s dismay, Steve guided the canister away. With the firm grip still around the base of his cock, Tony could only coo and mewl when he felt his master’s thick fingers pressing into his ass, first two, then three, until he stretched Tony’s sore hole over four fingers.
“Have you done this before?”
“Uh,” was all the young man could say at first in his shock. “But… you’re the King?”
“Well, you did alright with today’s surprise,” Tony said, as if having to think this over out loud. “Why not. Next surprise, tomorrow at four thirty… where?”
,” she said with meaning, “or coffee would magically affect your genetic potential.“
“I need an Editor in Chief. He is the only person in the building with enough experience,” Fury continued to speak over Steve, “if there was any way that we could make this work, we—”
, everyone knows that,” he pointed out, in case Clint thought he could guilt Tony into sacrificing his own safety somehow. “And running from a Chief? What were you thinking? Chiefs have magic, she’ll find you one way or another. They’ll never stop hunting you.”
“Just got here,” Steve answered while Tony toweled his neck and face intermittently and leaned in closer to peer at Steve’s key card slip.
Tony watched Steve punch in the code from memory and pull through to the gravel driveway with the confidence of a man who had been there many times before. There was just enough time for Tony’s blood to boil before he noticed their destination.
Bruce did not move for a long time.
It took Steve so long to comply, that Tony called his name again and repeated himself. Tony was asking Steve to get on his hands and knees, to trust Tony enough to turn his back to him and hope not to get hurt.
Steve watched her, overwhelmed with different thoughts and feelings. On one hand, he was a little jealous she’d had the good sense to dump his ass and Steve didn’t. On the other hand, he felt an unexpected sense of pride in her for never doubting what she’d heard, for believing that the blame was fully with Professor Hawley, and for taking a stance where others could easily have shrugged it off and moved on. Steve imagined a lot of people would for a six-carat diamond and lifelong financial security.
Steve was still trying to peel his lube-coated gloves off when he looked up at the large board overhead, and he couldn’t contain a pleased grin at the sight of his own name climbing the charts well ahead of Natasha.
“I am unharmed, I assure you,” Tony said with a practiced pleasant smile. “I am here to bring you supper, and to see if you would like some company.”
“A lot of people treat it as another adulting milestone,” Steve said as he sat back in his seat, watching Tony rinse off their dinner plates before putting them away in the dishwasher. “They probably think about marriage like it’s another superyacht, and they don’t understand why you’re not interested in the superyacht, too.”
Steve stared between the two blue-blood women ganging up on him like the high-class bullies they were. He fought back tears of humiliation, desperate not to let them see how their words hurt him. He wanted to speak up, to say something in his own defense, but the way Professor Stromwell looked at him made it clear he had no room for argument.
His choices were simple: allowing SHIELD to run tests on him for a clear answer, or doing it on his own, and there was no way he trusted SHIELD with Erskine’s serum. They hadn’t even been able to keep him safe back in the 40s. So Steve accepted his fate as ‘a man out of time.’ People used the phrase fondly, as if it was romantic - as if his destiny defied time and space to bring him where he needed to be.
, gonna leave you gaping, leaking my come, and aching so good, sweetheart, aching for me to fill you. Think they’ll notice?” Steve whispered then with a covetous drawl. “The way you walk… how you sit? Everyone will see then, Tony, everyone will know—”
Two slick, black shoes were on his doorstep, and as Steve slowly straightened, the shoes connected to the expensive suit, broad shoulders, and pencil thin mustache of Howard Stark. Steve stared at the man, half-convinced it was an early morning hallucination. The other half of his thoughts weren’t quite as convinced of anything, divided as he was between wondering if it was too late to cover his junk, and why a billionaire had taken his morning paper.
“Whether you’ll be joining me or not,” Steve whispered, impish in his confidence.
“I haven’t,” Steve said honestly, and Tony’s face warmed with excitement, thrilled as he always was to introduce Steve to something new.
Tony huffed and tried not to splutter in his shock. Looking at Steve was no help or comfort either; the damn rat was laughing so hard it looked like he’d fall over any moment.
Steve was still scrubbing his hair dry when someone hammered on his hotel room door and demanded to be let in.
He continued begging and fighting the urge to seek friction against the plush cushions when finally -
“Want to talk about it?” Steve asked in a gentle tone of voice, but Tony only shook his head no.
“Jane Foster, don’t!” Tony shouted immediately, and all eyes turned on him in disapproval over his rude exclamation. Tony was pale and harried, but he pressed his lips together to will the nausea at bay and stubbornly stood his ground at a computer terminal. He had already beaten Foster to the punch.
Thankfully the vest had been lost quickly that day (or sent back to the palace while Steve wasn’t looking). By the next year, Tony conceded to Steve’s one day of traditional wear and left his suit at home. He didn’t go as far as the traditional German suspenders, but stuck to a silk vest with red and gold embroidery that matched the detailing of his lederhosen. Grudgingly, he later admitted that the leather had been more comfortable than his suits, and Steve gleefully kissed him silly for his promise to do it again in years to come.
“I have two guest rooms,” Steve chimed in, but it was Pepper who smiled at him first and agreed that that would be a great idea. His lips curled up in a stilted smile in return, but it didn’t quite reach his eyes. It wasn’t like he’d said it for her.
Steve huffed wryly, but somehow Tony sounded too sincere to brush aside. What was he supposed to say, ‘keep your psychedelic sex helmet away from me?’ Given Tony’s reaction, Steve had no doubt he’d blame himself, as if Tony had in any way known that the ‘sex’ could be harmful, or that Steve suffered from PTSD. After all, their society was so irritatingly peaceful that there was a chance Tony didn’t even know what PTSD was.
“Therapy?” Dr. Odinson asked in a gentle tone.
” he sobbed, stalking to Steve’s side immediately as if hypnotized by the rolls. “What is—is that what I think it is? You’re—oh,
Clumsy with sleep and struggling against his own covers, Tony tried his best to roll onto his back and toss the covers away to reveal his nude body to his dream come true. Steve bussed his cheek in an expression of gratitude even though Tony had fallen back into a deeper sleep, and slowly he slipped down the length of Tony’s body until he faced his half-hard cock. He nosed at the coarse hair at the base of Tony’s cock, exhaling warm air and encouraging him to grow harder, faster. Without moving away from Tony’s crotch, Steve reached around with his still-dry fingers to scoop up some of the lube trickling out of Tony’s stretched ass so that he could cup and massage his balls again, rolling them in his hand leisurely and lifting them so as Tony instinctively spread his thighs again, Steve could reintroduce the canister to his hole.
“Not so much,” he admitted. “I know what to do, on top, but if I’m not in control, I… I don’t know.”
- Steve relented. Tony coughed through the last of his laughter while scrubbed half-heartedly at the tears on his face and tried to grumble through something snarky when Steve caught his hands.
“This is Tony Stark,” he said into the phone, already pressing two fingers against his other ear to hear the caller better.
“Listen, Steve. I know what I said… it’s a lot to accept. If you want to keep this, whatever this is between us strictly to the case, I understand. I mean it,” he added more emphatically, in case Steve hadn’t believed him the first time.
“You sure you’re alright?” Steve asked before Tony had to say anything. “We can tell them you caught something on the flight, or maybe something with your food, whatever, if you need to sleep.”
“Remind me to tell you about Taco Bell,” he called back. “I’ll be right back!”
Mirroring Tony’s behavior, Steve found himself sitting up and growing more alert. The night was still too dark for him to be able to see much farther than the car’s headlights, but as Tony slowed in preparation to park, he thought he could make out the general outline of a solid structure in front of them. But if this was the house, there was no sign of life: no lights were on, and beyond the sound of the wind and wilderness around them, Steve could hear nothing to suggest a family was awake, waiting for their child and his partner to come home.
,” Steve said with slurring, uncoordinated words through his post-orgasmic haze. Tony could feel the gust of his breath against the raw, tender skin of his ass. With increasingly bold grips and strength, Steve spread open Tony’s ass cheeks and then his hole, marveling at his own handiwork.
But Steve dug his heels in and did his best to pull himself together. As he reminded himself to give Tony the benefit of the doubt, it quickly occurred to him that Tony’s side of the room was equally bare. After all, hadn’t Steve just mistaken the space for a hotel room
Tony looped his arm around Steve’s again and steered them away to put more space between them all. “Bad example,” Tony said with Steve in an apologetic tone, sliding his hand into Steve’s and tangling their fingers together. “What about something harmless. A strawberry. When is a strawberry dead?”
“It’s not just you anymore, Tony,” Steve heard Jim say. “I get it: the more you get done before he gets back, the more time you can take off. But Steve doesn’t need you to work as much as possible, Tony. He needs your support. Until you can do that yourself, I’m assigning Natasha to stay with you so he will see you’re eating and sleeping again. But if you give her trouble, so help me god, Tony—”
“It, what?” Tony looked up and shot him a pained look. “It’s not meant to hold an avocado, Steve. Put it down. It’s been five minutes, I can’t do this with you: stop helping.”
Tony hummed softly in the affirmative and licked his dry lips, unintentionally catching Steve’s lips, too. The unexpected touch caught him off guard, and he gasped in his surprise. Steve laughed quietly to himself, and with his lips still curled up in a smile, Steve brushed his lips against Tony’s in a chaste, tender kiss.
“She said something about a baker, right? They’ve got great bakeries here.”
“I don’t know what to say,” Tony eventually admitted. “Steve, this is… a lot of money.”
“Traffic literally killed me,” were the first words out of his mouth. “Have you been waiting long?”
Apart from the rare occasions of having friends over, Steve and Tony rarely spent time together on the first floor. There was their living room, dining room, kitchen, and two guest rooms in case friends needed to crash. The second floor was entirely dedicated to their bedroom, and much like their reluctance to be downstairs together, they rarely lingered in their bedroom alone. So even though Steve left for work well before Tony ever wanted to crawl out of bed, Tony usually trailed after Steve to doze in the guest room downstairs while Steve made breakfast. They spent those mornings in silence, with Tony napping in the guest bed while Steve sat at the desk in the guestroom and enjoyed his breakfast.
“You think Steve still remembers your face?” Sam teased while Q had a final check in with Bucky on 002’s mission. “Is he even home yet?”
“Oh, gods—if you only knew—”
“Nothin’ will hurt you,” he eventually said, and he squeezed Tony against his side. “Safe Tony, sleep, shhh…”
Tony pressed a kiss to the back of Steve’s neck, and despite himself, he shuddered with delight. While Tony was distracted with coffee, Steve took a moment to steady himself, to remind himself of why this was something he needed, not something he wanted. This was no time for romance, this was all hinging on the end game.
“Don’t tease him, ma,” Clint said with a straight face at the same as Tony cried, “Every inch counts!“
“Damn. That’s rough,” Steve said quietly, not sure what sounded worse - getting your dick chopped off, or an existence where you wanted to have children without ever seeing them.
Steve smiled at him as if he wasn’t scared. As if he wasn’t worried. As if Bucky and Sam’s words weren’t still echoing in his thoughts.
Tony chuckled quietly at his guess and shook his head. “You wouldn’t walk straight after thirty. It’s ten on a mechanical bull, eight live.”
“Dad, you’re gushing again,” Steve muttered in a tired voice. Clark furrowed his brow at his unusual mood, then pulled out a chair for himself next to Steve to listen.
Why would I possibly be upset!”
“I—yes,” Tony stammered clumsily, “five days is plenty.”
“Now get out of here before it gets too hot,” Steve said, even taking a step back into the house, as if Tony was more likely to leave if Steve stood further away.
“What?” he asked the room at large. “Wait, you thought I’d be shocked that he likes blonds?”
“Sugar babies can be muscular,” Tony said, a touch defensive, but it was Natasha who shrugged their concerns off the best.
“Hi, good morning, I’m Steve Rogers. It’s my first day, I’m so excited to be here—”
“Tony Stark! Urgent salutations, my friend, I must speak with you. I received communication from Dr. Moses da Graça—”
Tony let out a tired sigh, but when he spoke again, he sounded more understanding than Steve expected. “Listen, these people are in a closely knit, elite network. They are smart, they have extensive resources; homes in multiple countries, and ways to get the hell out of dodge within hours. Maybe we can get away with pulling one of them without raising flags, but multiple? They’ll disappear, they’ll change up their MO. And if there are more victims?” he added more quietly, “We might never know.”
There was a shuffle of indistinguishable noises in the distance before he heard Tony’s incredulous voice. “Who the—”
Tony was the first to break the silent stand-off with a burst of laughter, blushing even with the stage make-up.
Quickly, Steve cleared his throat and looked down at their joined hands long enough to re-group.
Some intrepid soul had gotten close enough to set to get a shot of Tony at an opportune moment when Tony was leaning to hear something Patty had said from her director’s chair. The tailor had taken no prisoners in the cut of that suit, and the shape of Tony’s ass was unmistakable.
“Chief Director, the Captain has not yet had two hours to adjust to our social constitution. I formally request you to be patient. Captain Steve Rogers,” he added, turning to face Steve. “Every minute counts. This is not rude, it is protocol, and this argument you raise is not worth the lives of the citizens we serve.”
Tony blinked at his phone, then slowly turned around. Sure enough, the blond he had run into earlier was still standing two or three yards away, his own phone to his ear, and he was watching Tony with an air of self-satisfied mischief.
Instead of answering, Tony crawled on top of him, straddling Steve’s hips and lowering himself to nuzzle at his ears. Shivers ran down Steve’s spine, and his hands came up to grip Tony by the hips. He held on while Tony mouthed and nibbled down the shell of his ear, until Tony reached the fleshy lobe and sucked it into his mouth. Steve’s deep gasp of surprise filled his senses with the heady smell of Tony’s natural scent mixed with his cologne.
While Jenna fawned over the pictures of Sarah’s most recent foster kittens, Bucky leaned closer to Steve and asked, “So, what did Stark want?”
The intercom on Sharon’s desk buzzed to life. “Carter, in here.”
“How about joining me for a late lunch? Or early dinner,” Steve asked after a beat of uncomfortable silence. “If I’m going to eat alone, I might as well eat at home.”
“Just doing my job, Nick,” Steve said with a pleased grin. “This isn’t about my second raise, is it?”
With a sudden but effortless heave, Steve braced Tony’s weight with one arm and all but bent Tony's body in half until his knees brushed against his shoulders and his ass, stretched around the full girth of the canister, was up on clear display. Steve leaned back and pulled the canister out far enough that he could angle it just right so that every roll and thrust of the knobbly, bruising device landed directly against Tony’s prostate, milking rather than coaxing Tony’s next orgasm from his body. He wrapped his free hand around Tony’s heavy cock, plump and hard again almost immediately after the second orgasm, and rather than letting it beat wildly with every hard thrust, he jerked Tony off with a rough twist at the head at the end of every stroke. Tony whimpered and cried under him, struggling in vain against the weight of Steve’s body as his impending orgasm drove him wild with lust; Steve forced the canister all the way into his body for a third time, where it lodged and locked in for the final collection as Tony’s climax rocked his body like a barreling train, wrenching a breathless scream from his dry throat.
“Who isn’t?” Natasha rhetorically wondered, while Sam crossed his arms over his chest and, with a little less sympathy, muttered, “Who isn’t?”
“Oh,” Steve whispered quietly, his cheeks coloring in his embarrassment. Tony felt his heart take an ill-advised tumble as he witnessed this man push the frail boundary between
Across the sky the stars and the water all became one, smoothed under the cool moonlight. Steve remembered those last, desperate seconds when instinct took over and his eyes slipped shut, and as the pleasure consumed him, thundering through his parched body and brought him back to life, Tony pulled his hands free to cradle Steve’s face like a treasure, chasing his uneven gasps with tender, loving lips until Steve forgot about all the world and the light around them and lost himself in Tony’s soft lips and breathless kisses.
“Hey, Special Agent Hammer, Justin Hammer,” Bucky called out before Hammer had a chance to finish his sentence. “We’re right here.”
“Talk, right now,” Steve demanded over Tony’s indignant outrage. Tony smacked him on the shoulder, but that only turned Steve’s smirk of amusement into a wolfish grin.
“It’s my mana-tee. Get it?”
“Save it,” he told Buck before the arguments burst out of his friend. “Sally’s after the meeting?”
“...oh,” was all Steve managed to say.
“Hawley, Donovan, and Levinson.”
“What is going on, Buck? I’d never take you for drinking, not like that. Not around your children.”
“Shouldn’t you be in the hospital?” Tony whispered, “do—do you need me to take you there?”
“I thought it would let me sneak in to see you, but I’ll develop it for skin grafts. With a little work, it could be, uh. Useful,” Tony finished his confession lamely, clearing his throat to sound less obviously embarrassed by the plan. He did his best to keep his eyes on the mask and away from Steve’s sharp eyes, because the last thing he needed was for Steve to laugh at him. They hadn’t known each other that long, and this was only their second night together. Being laughed at was not on the night’s agenda.
), as if they’d arrived at a funeral procession instead of an exceptional place of learning and growth. How hard had every one of these people worked to come in here and sit with their sombre faces and tired eyes?
“Then let’s begin with you,” Steve said in a gentler voice, “do you receive any threatening letters or messages from—”
“You hold on to those.”
Tony spun on his heel, beet-red in the face, and marched away from his cackling little brother.
Except, he, too, was at a loss for what to do. He stared at the computer, his fingers hovering over the keypad at the ready, but between the adrenaline and shock, he couldn’t bring himself to act.
This is for the sweetest cheerreader I could have ever asked for,
“It means another man frequently resided at the address where we believe the letter originated from,” Steve tried to explain, but Hammer rolled his eyes and turned away to whatever one of his agents had brought up to show him.
“Sorry,” Steve said to his friend quietly, and as much as he wanted to reach out, he didn’t exactly want to draw attention to them either. Both of them watched Tony leaf through all the papers until he got to Hansen’s birth certificate.
“And you know for a fact that something needs to be revealed? He has no right to privacy ...because he’s rich? That’s pretty thin, Stark. Even for you.”
“Mom’s probably going out to get the eggs for breakfast,” Tony guessed, given the time. Then, out of the blue, he popped up with excitement. “Steve! How’d you feel about making those cinnamon buns of yours?”
“But dad ate everything,” Steve replied, sitting down on the edge of his desk before someone caught him pacing like a fool. “He made the best grilled cheese sandwiches. With the pears.”
Tony rushed down the stairs in his excitement to see Steve’s new clothes, and with both pride and admiration he paused here and there to settle the robes right over Steve’s silk vest and fix the starched folds of Steve’s high collar.
Steve rattled off some words to calm Tony and make up for his obvious slight, but Tony didn’t listen or even care to listen. He clambered over Steve to get out of the car, and with unsteady feet he stomped his way towards the indicated doors.
“Finally feel you, so good, baby, so big—so big inside me,” Tony panted against his lips, so close Steve could feel Tony’s mouth curled up in a mischievous grin. “Can feel you watching me… you missed me, didn’t you, Steve? Missed this ass?”
A rumble rose from somewhere deep in the woods, and all around them, the towering evergreens trembled and shook as a out of the mist rose an immense and mighty dragon that was so big that Clint had to turn his head to see the full span of her leathery black wings. Not that he could really pay attention to anything but her gleaming red claws, all of which were easily taller than he was long.
“Professor, I don’t see what that—”
That quiet time together was the closest Steve ever got to meditation, and privately he wished they could find an arrangement that let them start most of their days together.
“Okay, sweetheart, you’re starting to sound a
All that bullshit for some blue-blood dick.
“I’m sorry, Sparky,” he whispered into Steve’s hair as his laughter eased into a smile, and he pressed an affectionate kiss to Steve’s temple. “You really are my hero tonight.”
Tony rolled his eyes with good natured exaggeration. “I wasn’t aware we were co-parenting,” he said with a little snort of amusement. “Next kid, I’ll be sure to ask for your input first. Deal?”
“I’m—I’m up, stop—!” he complained through spluttered laughter, doing his best to protect himself from her spike of energy as she climbed all over him, licking his ears and trying to get at his mouth with enviable enthusiasm. It was the wettest, most effective wake-up, and even now - forty minutes before dawn and closer to Christmas than Easter - Tony wouldn’t change it for the world.
“Hello, hi,” he said and shook Steve and Tony’s hands in turn. His skin was clammy and his grip cautious, but he shuffled some papers in his hands, regrouped, and took his seat. “Sorry, traffic, and all these rooms end up—anyway, whatever. Hi, my name is Chris, and I’m with Bark Magazine, the coolest dog magazine ever, where Dog is my co-pilot.”
It was almost by luck that he glanced up and noticed the two hosts across from them. “Galvarino is a legendary Mapuche warrior in Latin America,” he said as the question came back to him. “He fought against the Spanish invaders. But, you’re not wrong, I would really like to be a pirate someday, too,” he added with a lopsided smile. Whatever had been on Steve’s mind seconds ago faded, and Steve only smiled back easily.
“Latch’s broken,” Tony told him when he realized what Steve had meant. Steve frowned at his words and shied away from the window, sitting back on the mattress.
Steve sat down in his bed before he fell over and grinned down at the phone like a fool. He waited to see if Tony would follow up with some sassy remark or punchline, but nothing was happening, and slowly Steve started to believe he really meant it. Tony’s words warmed him in a way he didn’t know he had missed. Tony missed him, too.
“Oh,” Bucky said after a beat. “Why didn’t you stay in New York? You love New York.”
“Man, you should’ve said something sooner,” Sam said with a doleful pity. “He’s got you believing his lies—”
Steve wasted no time. It wasn’t a position he could hold forever, and it was only a matter of time before Tony’s breathless mewling grew into heedless cries of ecstasy. With quick, aggressive snaps of his hips, Steve fucked into Tony with brutal abandon. Distantly, he felt Tony clawing at his shoulders and breathlessly crying Steve’s name, and in that moment Steve recognized that the sound of Tony’s shrill, desperate voice crying his name as he neared orgasm was the most beautiful he had heard. Hearing the man he had loved for so long teetering on the edge gave Steve the strength to step away from the wall and cradle Tony’s body tightly against his own as he pound into him viciously. The force of gravity bore Tony down on Steve’s cock over and over again, impaling himself with the weight of his own body.
“For the first round…. the initials are,” Carl said slowly, every pause full of dramatic showmanship. “GP.”
“You mean, do I know enough about you to know you’re a confident reader who doesn’t need a dog to calm your nerves?” Steve asked with a mischievous little smile.
“But it’s ten months tomorrow,” he said quietly, hoping it didn’t sound as pathetic as he suspected. “I graduate… I graduate next week. Defense, papers signed. I’m done.”
And that’s what Steve did, letting it all out in one rushed confession. “I worked really hard to get into law school—I gave up a good job, turned down the best parties, even blew off Spring Break to study for the LSATs, all so I could get my boyfriend Brock back and now he’s engaged to this awful woman Sharon so it was all for nothing! I wish I’d never come to Harvard.”
“A nap, Steve. I was drooling into my mattress—”
well. Hell, we’ve been living together now for a year and a half and I’m still waiting for the other shoe to drop.”
Maybe, after all, there could be compassion and understanding between men and Women.
Instead, small, daily rituals became their foundation. Every day that they were available at home, Tony carved twenty to thirty minutes out of his lunch time so they could take a walk together. For them it wasn’t as easy as letting themselves out to wander through the White House gardens, so ‘a walk’ usually meant wandering the halls and visiting historic rooms and artwork, or bowling a few rounds in the basement. On the weekend, they watched TV and movies in the family theater so it was more like an intentional date than falling in front of a TV in the Residence, and they only kept a TV in the dining room for emergencies.
The conference room door opened and revealed the mysterious redhead Steve already considered a friend. She acknowledged Hawley with a nod as she took her seat.
“Yeah,” he agreed, in a whisper. “You’re right, that wasn’t my call to make. I am sorry,” he said, making himself look up at Steve for those words, even if for a second. “For… for messing up your life, or career, or—anything else, you know, that I can’t think of right now. I’m sorry.”
On the screen, new footage taken from a great distance showed the king’s red and gold jet getting shot out of the sky. It fell to the earth in a lifeless arc, trailing smoke and fire.
“You… you are too much,” Tony whispered, his voice trembling with a touch of delirium.
Behind Steve, Bucky was looking less and less angry, and a lot more uncomfortable. He cleared his throat and gently patted Steve on the shoulder. “Hey, Stevie, maybe, you know. Maybe you should be happy you got out?”
“We are aware of two women, both of them high-end prostitutes. One of them has agreed to testify.”
“Hi, this is Steve Rogers,” Steve was saying before he realized Tony may not remember his name. “We shared, um. We talked over Sno Balls on Monday? Is there any chance I could talk to him? It’ll only take a minute.”
“More like, the flight,” Tony said and reached in for some peanut M&M’s he’d already opened; he took a few for himself and offered the bag to Steve, who declined. “The closest store is two hours away back home, so whatever you need… better stock up now.”
is a hipster. Second,” Steve continued before Bucky challenged his own inclusion in that category, “Ms. Potts corroborated everything he said. She provided invoices for his alibi, she even brought the whole catalogue of his fan letters from 1994.”
Calmly, Clint got up to his feet and brushed himself off. The tunic and trousers he’d been provided with were now the only changes of clothes he had, and he intended to take good care of them.
Steve stared at his friend for a long moment, then calmly raised the phone to his ear again. “I take that back, sweetheart, it looks like Bucky’s having a meltdown. I’ll call you back.”
All around him, his cotton candy hugged him again in fresh waves of painless peace. He was safe from her now, and he could feel Tony’s hand in his, and the world was so perfect and fuzzy and sweet. Sleep weighed on his eyes and quieted his thoughts, but Steve didn't want to go if Tony wasn't sleeping, too.
Which brings us here: back to the Present.
“Ma’am, I don’t understand—”
Tony was waiting outside of the restaurant when Steve arrived. He wasn’t on a call, or off in his own world solving the impossible. He just stood on the sidewalk, trying to seem casual. At a glance it was clear there was nothing casual or relaxed about him, though. Tony couldn't stand still. He shifted his weight on his feet restlessly, bouncing a little on the balls of his feet; his fingers were tightly wound around his phone, spinning it between his fingers and fiddling with it endlessly to check the time every second and, even in the short time it took Steve to walk up to him, Tony couldn’t seem to decide if he wanted to keep his hands behind his back, or shoved deep into his pockets.
“I looked at four estates here, a condo in San Francisco, a beach house in Malibu, and the two rings that had sapphires—”
“It was good stuff!” Tony insisted, visibly struggling to keep his hands to himself. “Steve, please. I was careful—there was nothing unflattering—and you, you got picked up by LA.”
“Christ, look at all this,” Tony muttered to himself, staring at a great bas relief depicting Assyrian hunters firing arrows at lions. “These belong in museums.”
“Then, invite her to attend the theater? ‘Villains’ is still playing.”
Steve felt so terrible about putting Tony in such financial limbo that he insisted on addressing it immediately. Luckily, Tony had already planned to walk Steve back to Chelsea to be sure he wouldn’t hurt himself going home.
Of the three machines Steve had acquired for him, Tony’s favorite was the one that took him from behind. Sometimes, when he was left there too long, his knees ached even with the padding, but it was the only machine that had a second attachment with a suction cup to milk his cock while he was being fucked. Practically speaking, he was relieved that his ejaculate finally counted toward filling his quota of canisters, but in practice, it was all about that silky, slippery tight sleeve milking his cock for hours to distract him while his ass was continuously fucked open on fresh canisters.
This was it. Steve knew it, this was his chance. He looked at Tony one last time, then made up his mind.
Yes CHARMING is that so hard to believe?
Tony grimaced with disgust at Stephanie’s words, and finally, he looked her in the eyes. “And why would she do that? Because Women are so much better than men? Because Women are a gift, and men could never be?” he spat. “I heard you,” he added with a snarl, and Stephanie fell back in a terrible shock. “I heard you, last night with Clint. I knew I should’ve known better than to trust you, to think you were different. To think I cared for you, that I could—that I could even love you. I’ll spare you the trouble of asking me to make you with child; my answer is no. Death or freedom, Stephanie, but I want nothing more to do with you.”
“Nicer clothes?” Steve couldn’t help but blurt out. He looked down at himself and picked at his perfectly good button-up in genuine confusion. When did slacks and a collared shirt become the wrong choice? “What’s wrong with my clothes?”
“Cut the bullshit!” Steve snarled, and in the near distance, a morality box whirred to life. “Outside the museum, I saw you and Rumlow together. He had a full ten seconds to think about where to put a bullet in your head, so why didn’t he?”
“Captain Rogers, Sergeant Barnes: Sir wishes to know whether he may intrude to speak with Captain Rogers on a private matter.”
It took a minute or two for an elevator to get there, but when the cab got there, at least it was empty. Steve pressed the button for the sixth floor and leaned his weight back against the wall. He could finally breathe again.
“Steve? It’s this way.”
“That’s
Tony knew exactly what he was doing, and Steve had no reason to resist. An eager, covetous growl rose from somewhere deep in his chest, but when he pressed his long, firm body down to pin Tony under him, he didn’t ravage those tempting, parted lips beckoning him to do anything he pleased. The first touch of their lips was gentle and reverent, a man worshiping at the altar and savoring a gift so divine. They rolled together, slowly and eagerly, and as Tony’s thighs closed around Steve’s body for better leverage, Steve forgot all time and space and lived only to exist in Tony’s love.
Aware of his inferiority relative to all gold class Lieutenants in the room, Tony waited for Fury’s attention before answering his partner’s question.
Sam and Erin echoed their support for Paulette’s wisdom. Steve slouched further into his hair chair wondering how his life could be so good and so rotten at the same time. He had kind, dependable friends, he was doing well in his program, and he’d met a really great guy, but he’d also married a one-night stand and broken his ma’s heart.
Tony bit at his lip in an effort to quiet himself, but it was no use. He groaned softly under his breath, sinking further into his seat while palming his cock through his jeans.
“You’re right,” he said after taking a moment to quiet his initial reaction. “I’ll get my phone and answer her. Don’t wait for me,” he added, pushing Tony’s plate closer before going to do what he said. “Eat while it’s warm.”
“I won, didn’t I?” Steve teased him in return, and Tony barely gave himself the time to roll his eyes before he was on his husband again to kiss the cheeky smirk off his face.
"Tony-I-its like I am back and I am making everything worse for you. Your health and when he-when he threw you across. I thought I would lose you forever you know. I felt helpless that I couldnt get to you  and if something would have happened I would I cant forgive myself Tony" Tony had taken his functioning arm and pulled Steve close and Steve just hugged him and he could feel his shirt getting wet.
"No No I-"
"Ill pick you up on Friday at 7 pm" Tony said and suddenly they were paused outside there old room.
"Is there something wrong I mean do you require anything else I can ask Nat or Friday to make necessary-"Tony was cut off by Stephen
"Let him in" Tony replied and cleaned his hand.
"Thats great" Steve said. Steve continued eating. Tony and Stephen were talking about so many things that Steve couldnt keep up and he focused on his plate. He could see Stephen touching Tony's eye or his hand to examine him and Steve almost bended his fork. He sighed. He had to calm down. In front of him he could see Carol, Nat and Pepper secretly laughing at him. They were having at his misery. Peter offered him another fork which he took and thanked him. tony just looked at him for a second and gave him a weird look and went back to speaking. Soon they both got up and Stephen announced he was leaving and took Tony into lounge.
"Vis what the hell"
"Just breath Tony" Steve whispered and took Tony towards the table.
"This is no way of talking in front of a lady Rhodey Bear"
"Yup, Steaks are almost done"
"So Dr Strange how long ill you be staying with us? We will be hosting a dinner tonight followed by movie as Vision and Wanda are back. Please join us" Bruce said.
"Guys I will sit with Tony you guys can go and I will keep and eye out on Steve as well. Jim will stay with me" Carol announced.
"How can I stop worrying about you when you do this" Steve said as he caught him. He helped him to the bathroom and left Tony as the door. He waited as Tony came out and took his medicines without arguing.
"Well I was planning to chill on your couch any way so yeah cool now I will have better place to chill and sleep"
"Nothing serious Brucie-Bear, its all sorted" Tony replied. They all had continued watching the movie and went to bed.
"Okay so I have to speak to you about something. I know you care about me a lot but just give them all a chance Carol please" Tony said.
"No No Tony please dont say that it was my fault and I am sorry I did not think about the consequences of my action and I am just paying for it. Dont you ever be sorry for. You were right things will never go back to normal and I am at fault for that. You must hate me and you should because that is what I deserve. I am really sorry for everything and I will respect your boundaries" Steve said softly.
"I would like to see my room Tony would you?" Stephen said giving Steve a look
Steve prayed that Tony will listen to him once he had so much explaining to do and all he wanted was Tony back and he would do anything to get him back. Whereas Tony sat in his lab panicking about the whole morning. He couldnt believe how he had managed all that. He was angry at Steve. How dare he come back and start asking to talk to me. But Tony knew he will have to talk to him as the Team had to be one and he did not have enough time left.
"You know Steve use to tell me that you speak a lot about the things you are passionate about" Bucky said
"Yes boss"
"That was not your decision to make" Sam said.
"Yeah sure" Tony got up and sat on the comfy mattress on the floor which looked like a sofa bed Tony thought. It was comfy with pillows and blankets. Steve made sure Tony was bundled up as it was getting chilly.
"Mr Stark did you like the decoration me, Harley and Cooper did it" Peter said smiling hoping to impress him.
"Oh man this is confusing, my work on gamma radiation is simple than this" bruce replied and Nat just smiled at her idiot.
"Only if you talk about it too" Tony replied
"Wait-What? hospital? why do you have to go to the hospital? are you okay?" Tony asked panicked. Pepper just smiled.
"I would like to sleep in your lounge if that is okay with you?" Steve said. Steve knew if someone came up through the stairs or lift the lounge will be the place they will have to pass.
"Never mind vision you can chill on he couch"
"I just wanted to know who she was" Wanda replied
"Why?! you think I cant handle steve? is that what this is about?"
Half an hour later Widow and Hawkeye brought a guy who was passed out and frankly he wasnt very much alive as Sam noticed. They locked him up in one of the basements to interrogate later. "All we know is that the person who paid for this knows us well, he knew where we live what we do and he knows our methods of research. He did not have any name, just a paper with a picture of Stark mansion and o blew it up for money that is it. The money was was paid in cash and was dropped by another person who picked it up from a tunnel and the cameras weren't working so we have no idea who set this up" Natasha briefed. "Or maybe we do" Steve replied "We have pissed off a lot of people but who out of them would go to extreme lengths to destroy us?" Steve asked.
"You know I have dreamt of this so many times just holding you and feeling you Tony. Are you really here Tony in my arms?" Steve asked kissing Tony's forehead. Tony just softly kissed him on the lips.
"I know what you are doing"
"Oh shut up Tony I just missed you and No you are not about to be an uncle stop imagining things, We cam here to tell you to get up in the common room everyone is waiting for you"
"You too Steve" Tony said and smiled.
"I am okay Steve you know just the usual nothing to worry about" Tony replied.
I hope you guys enjoy!!!
"Uncle Tony when can we work on our project I am looking forward to it" said Cooper.
"No its alright Tony" Steve replied. He did not want to bother Tony anymore.
"Boss we have an incoming call from Mrs Barton"
"You forgot Billionaire and Philanthropist Strange" Tony replied and Stephen just rolled his eyes.
"What will we do about Ross" Steve said.
As soon as the reached the medical floor they could hear them fighting. "-doctor you have to look at him before I am lightly scratched his leg is burned pay attention to him" Carol replied to something. Before the doctor could speak Rhodey spoke up "I have 2 people already patching my leg so let him look at you or I wont let them do mine". Tony mentally rolled his eyes as if Carol would be threatened by that. "You do that and I will blast your head off James this is serious and-" Carol was cut off as the door opened and they all entered. Carol had a few scrapes on her face and arms but Rhodey's left leg had received a third degree burn and you could easily see the flesh. As soon as Tony saw them he went towards Carol and hugged her. He was so glad that they both were alive.
"Ton-" Steve started but was cut off by Carol
"Lets watch Shrek" Tony said and everyone nodded. Steve knew that movie as Tony had made him watch it. The movie ended and everyone was informed that the food had been delivered. They were settling down for dinner. Steve was about to sit on one of the empty sides with Tony and suddenly a orange bright circle opened and Strange walked out of it. Steve did not like this guy and here he was again. He knew he was Tony's friend but Steve knew the way he looked at Tony. It was the same way Steve looked at him. Steve could see the smile on Tony's lips and he sighed. He just wanted Tony happy and if this guy made Tony smile Steve just had to suck it up.
"Hey T'Challa has agreed to help Bucky. He can leave tomorrow. I have arranged Quinjet to be ready" Nat told Steve.
He was wrong. It had been 2 days since he last saw Tony. His bones were almost healed and still no show from the genius. He went down to the lab twice and after 5 minutes trying to get access Friday had told him to leave. He knew that Tony came back to his floor really late at night as his door would be slightly opened when he woke up every morning and Steve had the perfect plan to ambush him. He sat in Tony's lounge in darkness. It was 2 am when the elevator opened and he saw Tony coming out.
"Coop what are you doing here?" His mum said defeated
The thought of Steve made his heart ache a bit the way the soldier had begged him. He remember begging as well to come with him ,however, shit had happened and Steve left him not the same way Tony left him. Tony wanted to be busy.
"Jeez Doc give a guy a warning. I have a heart condition" Tonys said and instead of a reply he was gently hugged by Stephen. Steve chose this exact moment to enter and saw Stephen and Tony hugging. His heart broke. He knew this was it. Tony had people to look after him and the Doc guy who Steve knew liked Tony was with Tony instead of him. He started walking back to his place to pack. He would tell the guys in the morning and leave quietly without hurting anyone anymore. Tony was okay and Bucky was home he did not want anything else.
"Nah Mechanic and I need to work on Potato gun" Harley said and came to hug Tony.
"Tony? you okay?"
"It does not matter, you are here and safe thats all that matters. Did you speak to Nat?" Tony asked
"Where is Strange?" Wanda asked. Everyone looked around but no one knew and Steve was about to ask Friday when a yellow circle appeared and he walked in with a scared Peter. Tony rushed towards Peter and Peter hugged him. The kid was almost in tears and he held tightly on Tony. Steve came forward and started rubbing circles on his back.  Tony looked at Stephen and Stephen replied "He wasnt answering his phone. His aunt was working the night shift when few people came in and tried to kidnap him, they injected him with something and he couldnt use his spider powers. It kind of paralysed him. Dont worry I gave him the antidote thats why it took so long. I have explained to her to come to the tower after her shift" Stephen explained.
"Can we have this conversation later when I am not too drugged up" Tony said and was falling sleep again. Steve nodded and was about to go  get the doctor when Tony held on to his hand tightly.
"Nat?"
"So you are Steve" Stephen said looking him from head to toe like sizing him. Steve just stood there thinking what does that mean.
Tony had upgraded the equipment for everyone and he had told everyone to meet in the common room. Bruce was with him and helped him carrying all the stuff.
"Why didnt you call me Steve? Why didnt you come back?" Tony asked.
"Thanks Strange" Tony smiled.
"Why are you here?" Steve asked. He knew Carol did not like him so why was she here.
"Well I mean Rhodey and Carol will probably be back around 10 pm so-"Tony was interrupted by Sam
"Just give me time just a bit Steve" Tony said and Steve just smiled.
The next morning when they all met for breakfast the lighting circle according to Steve, appeared and Wanda, Vision and Strange walked out. He was happy to see them back. Wanda had completed all her test set by Strange and was back with the Avengers. Tony hugged them all and smiled when he saw Strange in normal clothes instead of his outfit. "What is the occasion Strange you getting married or what?" Tony said as they took the seat at the table. Strange just rolled his eyes and replied "If you are the groom then yes I am getting married" Steve just narrowed his eyes at him and Tony just rolled his eyes. "Okay boys behave lets eat" Nat said. Steve was jealous and he was not ashamed to admit it.
"Tony" Steve nodded back but his eyes had more words.
Tony was working in his lab as usual, the little amount of sleep was enough specially when it reminded him of his Steve. His? really? what is he thinking he thought. Steve was not his and he had made that clear when he left him and picked "Bucky". No he needed to stop thinking and work on these new braces for Rhodey so he can have better movement. It was all his fault for loving him. All he can dream about was Steve crashing his shield in his chest. All those promises of I will never hurt you were lies. No Tony thought he is thinking again.
"Cooper stay please" Clint spoke
"But I didn't even complete my sentence" Tony said pouting.
"Tony I am worried and hear me out before you start giving me I am fine bullshit. I care about you and I do  not want to see you hurt again. Rogers is obviously expecting or trying to get you back and I wont stand on the side to see you hurt. I have seen enough" Tony opened his mouth to defend Steve and Stephen knew Tony well and before he could speak Tony was cutoff "Before you defend him tell me he knows that you were about to die twice. Does he know what his shield did to your heart and how it sopped beating twice on the table. Did you tell him this?"
"Good luck Wanda I hope you will have a nice time at Kamar Taj. If you dont you can come back if you dont like it there" Tony said softly. He knew Wanda did not like her and somewhere still blamed him for her parents death. Suddenly Wanda just hugged Tony. Everyone was surprised including Steve.
"So yeah where was I, Clint you better get your shit sorted because honestly I do not know how long Laura will want to stick around with that attitude of yours and do not interrupt. Steve you are pass the pissing point I can put a bullet in your head and wont even feel bad about it. The only reason you are alive in this room is because of Tony. He made me promise him not to hurt you or anyone else in this room because trust me nothing will make me more happy than getting rid of you from his life. You have hurt him enough for a life time. If I would have been late in retrieving him he would have been dead because of you. If you would kill your boyfriend for you friend imagine what will I do for my family to you and you mean nothing to me. Last warning Rogers stay.." Carol was clear on her words. She has to protect Tony. Rhodey would not say this to all of them because he still considered these people friends but she did not know them at all. All she knew was how Tony took her in when her parents kicked her out. How he sat with her and helped her through nightmares. He was her brother and if she knew he needed them earlier she would have been there. Before she could complete Tony came up.
“Tony—” But Tony’s already in motion, pushing back through the screen door and snapping orders to FRIDAY to seal down the workshop before he’s even in the elevator.
“Shut up, jerk.”
It felt… like a betrayal to go there.
They don’t talk about it.
Tony slides the picture out of the envelope. It’s the new team, looking comfortable and relaxed out of their uniforms. The picture is broad and the photographer is standing far enough back to capture everyone. No one is looking at the camera but they’re all smiling, some standing, some kneeling down in the grass in the warm, bright sunshine.
Dinner is a quiet affair.
Maybe Steve should give him the chance to decide for himself instead of trying to hold him still.
Steve pries her hands off his face and sets them in her lap. Both of their fingers are wet. Steve wonders if his eyes are as red as hers, sparing her a slow blink as he stumbles up off the couch and towards the elevator on legs that shouldn’t be able to carry him.
Tony groans, nails raking over Steve’s back in a hot and cold trail leading to the curve of his ass. “Fuck me. Come on. Don’t make me wait, Steve, please.”
It’s a valid question because Tony remembers how destroyed he was after the last time. Which was supposed to be
“Okay, but like, really though?”
Steve shifted, pressing Tony’s thighs higher. Fingers teased where Steve’s thrusting into him – Bucky – and Tony was hit with an intense wave of lust as Bucky’s fingers disappeared again and Steve arched forward.
Tony glances at him, frantically, as Strange all but glares down at his wristwatch with impatience. Master of time, Tony’s bare ass.
Steve holds the door open for him and Tony steps through. They don’t touch, he’s careful of that. They haven’t touched since the last time Steve laid his hand over the whole of the arc reactor and pressed his fingertips into the scar tissue he helped to create. Sure, they’ve seen each other. A handful of times before everything went to shit.
“Let me make myself incredibly clear,” Tony says quietly, breath wafting over Steve’s face. He smells like mint with the undernotes of rich, decadent coffee and everything Steve’s ever loved about their life together. With a deliberate motion, he lets his tongue dart out and lick his bottom lip, rejoicing at the way Tony’s eyes darken and stay transfixed on his mouth. “None of this, not one goddamn second, has ever been about Barnes.”
“Give me a chance,” Steve says in a low voice as if one of the nurses in the hallway could hear and come rushing in to stop him. “I’m not saying that this is us working it out or reconciling, because it’s not. But give me a chance here, Tony. After everything that’s happened.”
Steve’s eyes flicker with recognition, and he’s very gentle when a few moments pass and he finally says, “I knew.”
.” Giving voice to it makes his chest ache, and Steve tightens his fist in the blankets. Tony, still teaching him lessons in vulnerability.
It wasn’t nearly enough. Fuck, he was so desperate for it already.
Damn it, he’s been lying to himself and will always lie to himself when Steve’s involved. Talking about it could change
Natasha snorts into her coffee cup. “Men.”
Over Sarah’s shoulder, he sees Natasha and he can’t help it. A sob escapes him and he pitches forward out of his mother’s arms and straight into Natasha’s. “Did you miss me too, Avenger?” She asks.
He’d given that to Bucky.
“Get out.” The command was little more than a broken whimper, slipping from Tony’s lips.
Tony just laughs and laughs.
Clint stole the rest of Steve’s eggs from the pan. “And what’re we discussing?”
“Yeah, yeah, Rogers, we all know that already. What part of quick and painless didn’t compute for you?” Tony grouses, earning himself a room full of scowls and barely hidden disdain.
Those first few nights, Steve had still been sleeping in a cot, shoved between Bucky’s and Sam’s, waking up screaming from the raw terror of his nightmares. Every night, Tony died again and again, screaming while he stared into Steve’s eyes. It was only natural that he’d picked up the puppet. People did bizarre things to deal with their grief, and Steve told himself this was no different than curling up in one of Tony’s old sweaters or the way Morgan kept her arms wrapped tight around the helmet of the Mark LXXXV.
“I don’t feel well, Mr. Stark. Cap. I don’t—”
“Don’t,” he says, before Steve’s mouth connects with his own.
Steve groaned against his back; forehead pressed into the space between his shoulder blades. “Tony, please.”
“Miss you too, Pep. What’s up?”
“What’s your favourite food?”
“That’s not what I–” Steve groans and runs a hand through his hair. “I just meant that, he’s going to be looking out for you. The kid’s loyal. So, it’s the least we can do, as a team, to look out for him, because he’s new to this and, uh, like I said, he’s a good kid.”
Still, the feeling lingers.
“So, steaks then? This Saturday?” Clint demanded.
Out of the corner of his eye, he sees Steve flinch and Tony’s jaw clenches. Don’t look at him. He’s not worth it and he’ll see right through you, idiot.
Thor starts to force the portal closed; a malfunction in the Bifrost that Steve can’t care less for, as long as he shuts it down and the aliens stop coming through. The whole situation is far too similar to New York and Steve finds himself shoving aside the visual of Tony falling, limp from the sky.
“He’s not going to like that.” Steve grumbled low in his chest, concerned, but still scrambling up after him and rooting around in his dresser. It was two pairs of shrunken sweats tossed towards the garbage before he came up successful.
“We’re just calling about Tony.” Bucky explained. “He’s been acting a bit off the past few days and he’s not down in the shop. Our codes don’t seem to be working. FRIDAY says he’s at Stark Industries. Have you heard from him?”
Tony and Steve were lying in each others arms. Tony's head was placed on Steve's chest and Steve's fingers were moving up and down Tony's back. He knew Steve was in deep thought and maybe they were thinking about the same thing but Tony was sure this was too early to think like this he trusted Steve but he really did not want to ask him. But Tony being Tony he knew if this thing would bother Steve he wont say it and this will create a rift between them.
"Take acre of yourself Tony and call me if you need me" Stephen said while making his way back in the circle.
"Bucky listen to me you cant blame yourself for something you have no control over. You tried your best and you did great as well" Steve replied.
"What is your point Nat"
"I dont want to he left us behind"
"Put her through Friday"
Steve was lying in his bed after ages he felt happy. Tony had agreed to be his friend well that meant Tony will talk to him. He also said his name today. That was improvement and Steve was content at the moment. He did not like how Tony had told him about this guy. He sounded irritated but there was something in his eyes which made Steve scared. That was the look Tony gave him the first time they made at the helicarrier. Steve still remembered Tony looked annoyed ,however, his eyes had a bit of shinning or it was something he imagined. He still remember how after the nuke everything had changed. Steve did not think he could love anyone after Peggy but Tony made him fall for him without even knowing. Tony had opened his home to all the avengers and invited him to stay there after his trip and he did.
"I love you, Tony, you know that right?" Steve said.
"Captain follow me I have to go soon so can we talk whatever you want to talk about" Tony said walking towards kitchen.
"How about you get fresh and I have your medicine here" Steve said.
Steve woke up next morning and went for his run. He was deciding what to wear. Usually he put on whatever he saw but today this Stephen guy was going to be there and Steve just wanted to look good. It was stupid but Steve just wanted to be ready.
"NO NO MY FAULT TONY IS IN THERE BECAUSE IT IS MY FAULT I DID THIS" Steve started shouting and everyone knew he was having a break down.
"Yeah I am fine" Bucky replied and they tried again. Bucky looked in to Tonys eyes the whole time and Tony just smiled at him.
"What?" Steve asked them.
"Its in the past okay? just let it go" Tony said and walked towards the elevator. He reached his floor. Cooper and Peter were watching some movie Laura, Lila and Nathaniel were in a room probably sleeping. He picked his phone and called Nat.
"Yes, he did Tony" Laura replied. She was smiling but Tony could see she was anxious.
"Hello Everyone" The voice was a bit cold Steve thought.
Tony removed the cloth covering all the equipment beneath. There were new guns and widow bites for Nat, stretchy pants for Bruce, Sam's new wings, Peter's updated suit and Steve's shield. Everyone had a smile on their faces Steve however just stared at his shield.
When Tony entered Peter's room he saw Steve running a hand through Peter's hair and Sam sitting on the chair. He looked at the sight and thought if Steve didn't leave they probably would have adopted a kid and they, he stopped right there he did not want to think about what could have happened anymore. It still hurt sometimes. Right now his main focus was keeping Peter safe. Steve saw him and gently moved out of the bed. Peter was in deep sleep. He placed a kiss on his forehead and they all left instructing Friday to alert them.
"Tony you have your watch right?" Steve whispered worried. He did not want Tony to go in there at all but he trusted Tony and he knew the genius would have a back up. Tony just nodded.
"I know Kid, I love you too" Tony closed his eyes in the elevator hoping to reach his floor and throw his stuff in a bag, have the dreaded talk and leave.
"Bring up file Alpha Roger five echo X-ray, we have work to do and DUM-E, don't start being happy and chirpy yet you are with me, YOU go make me a good healthy drink and Butterfingers help me with the space and if anyone of you annoy me I will donate you to the local community college"
"Yeah i attached some sensory system which will it feel like there is a flow of activity which will help the psychological neurons in you brain also I attached a system which will keep your hand warm like not always warm but will me the same as the rest of your body temperature and the metal is really light and i have weighed it accordingly to the weight of what a human arm is suppose to be" Tony just babbled like always. Peter listened to it and went over to entertain Dum-E and YOU.
"Steve you gave me these when you told me you loved me and I dont want them anymore because I just know this does not belong to me. I cant keep it and its best if this stays with you" Tony pushed the Tags towards him.
"Clint that is enough you are not in you right mind. We will talk later."Tony argued. He was calm he knew the kids were around and did not wanted to say something which will upset them anymore. The kids had gone up with Peter. He had made an eye contact with Peter to take the kids to his floor.
"One of us needs to be in the room. I can go with Bruce" Nat said.
"Tony does not hate you. He didnt even hate you when you left him behind. You just broke his heart Steve. He died on the operation table twice that day when I got him back. He almost died when Happy and Pepper found him. He hated himself but never once he hated you. I told him you were a mistake and you know what the genius said he told me you were the best mistake he ha made. He knew where you were and he protected you. I hated you for destroying my best friends life but I knew he would never hate you. He will live okay? a very long life" Carol said and got up.
"I am here and Rhodey said to go on without him he has some stuff to do" Carol replied
"I thought I would bring you up here and we can have just a quiet meal and maybe talk later if you want. If you dont like it I mean we can-" Steve was rambling and Tony just smiled at him.
"Jerk"
"Hey Rhodey bear" Tony said.
"Bye Tony and dont do anything you normally do" Tony just rolled his eyes and cut the call.
"What happened?" Tony asked. He was worried for Steve now. He knew Steve would get in the past.
"Okay Ed. Remember your family is waiting for you" she squeezed his hand and gave a nod to Sam and Bucky and left.
"Ross wants Barnes and Bruce because he has always been after the super soldier serum. Barnes the only good option I see is that you do not go the Trial and live a normal life. Same for you Bruce. We have asked for a few days and meanwhile I am hoping to get that video from Ross somehow. You both can go public and retire-" Tony was cut off by Bucky.
"Sure Steve" Peter just nodded and sat with Cooper.
They were sitting in the kitchen and Steve was cooking breakfast with the help of Rhodey and Sam. Bucky and Scott were arranging the table and Tony was being guarded by Peter and Carol so he wont sneak some coffee. Nat and Carol just sat beside Tony. Clint and his family decided to go out for breakfast. Tony was stuck in between them and no one was getting him coffee.
"No Nat and stop waning him about me. Carol had a word with him and you know how he goes into guilt. Just leave it the way it is. I will speak to him" Tony replied. Tony knew he had to apologise to Steve. Nat just nodded
"Yeah I think so. I just hope this works out for Bucky" Steve sighed.
"Hi Mr Stark" Scott came in looking around the lab and greeting Tony.
"Bruce your stretchy pants for you as these are more comfortable I updated the cloth" Tony said giving him the pants. Bruce took the pants and just side hugged him.
"Listen Punk you getting dressed like this and trying to impress. You and the Strange guy looking at each other. We get it. In other words you have competition and we understand" Bucky said
Everyone saw Tony leaving and Steve coming out with red eyes. They had an idea but no one said anything.
"So Rogers I heard you and Tony are back together" Strange said and Steve looked at him. Nat was glad that she was in the room and if these 2 idiots decide to fight she would just throw them both out of the tower.
They both started speaking all of a sudden.
"No, thank you Tony and I mean it. I am sorry as well for everything" Scott said and left.
"What about me Mr Stark?" Peter said.
"Move aside Steve" Carol shouted.  She blasted the door and for a second everyone looked at her and ran inside. Steve was the first one in followed by Nat, Carol and Rhodey. Sam and Bruce were the last and guarded the door not allowing any of the guards sent by Ross in. They could see Ross standing with other members looking shocked. However, there was a glint in his eyes.
Tony opened the door to the storage room and saw Steve looking in to the boxes. He clearly knew that he heard someone coming towards the room and had just started to look for information. "Oh Tony its you, I have found this box and it might-" Steve was silenced by a long kiss. When Tony's mouth left his he was still dizzy.
Tony was shocked was Steve asking him out. He did not know what he wanted to do kiss him or laugh but he knew how nervous Steve was and he felt ready but was he really ready? He wanted to be with Steve but those 2 years wont go away. Steve was nervous, he should have not asked about this right now when Tony was hurt. It was just Tony's words which made him crazy. He sighed after a while. Tony was still staring at him.
"I know I know and I am so thankful" Steve replied.
"Morning Shellhead. Don't ever scare me like that okay?" Nat whispered and moved closer to place a kiss on Tony's cheek.
It was only Steve and Tony. Steve set beside Tony in the chair. He took his hand in his and it felt so right there. He had not touch that hand in 2 years. He brought it up to his face and kissed it. A tear made its way down Steve's cheek. What had he done to his Tony. He just held his hand and cried for the way he hurt him in the cave, for the 2 years he spend without him and for making things the way they are. He just wanted Tony to be healthy. He wanted him to be okay.
"Yeah, she is fine and has probably learnt her lesson" Sam replied
"What you thinking about?" Tony whispered and Steve stopped moving his arm and stilled. "Nothing really I am just thinking about Pepper and Happy. I am happy for them" Steve replied and placed a kiss on Tony's head. "I know I will be an uncle Steve and I will spoil the kid although I am sure Happy and Pep will kill me but who cares" Tony said smiling. He had already made a list of what he was going to buy and what he had to create he could make a baby's walker and-his thought process was interrupted. "Do you want kids? I mean we spoke about this before but I just wanted to know if you still want to raise one with me" Steve asked. Steve held his breath he knew he always wanted to have kids with Tony but he wasn't sure after all that happened Tony would want kids. Tony wasnt sure how to reply Steve it should be a yes but they werent ready to have kids right now and he did not want to hurt Steve but he knew he had to reply. "Yes I mean I want kids with you but like not tomorrow like one day you know" Steve just replied hmm. Tony sighed and he knew this was a big responsibility and they couldn't bring a kid in the current situation. They need to be more stable but he just couldnt say this to Steve.
"Its okay kid I am fine. I am healthy as a horse okay?"
"Wanda is going like Kamar Taj so stop telling her to come back here Stark. Always trying to steal people from me" Stephen said. He was standing beside Carol.
"Tony-" Carol looked at him.
"Steve look at me he is going to be fine Steve look at me" Nat made Steve look at her. Making sure she kept the eye contact. Rhodey was moving towards Steve but Carol just stood at her place.
"Thank you. You did more than anyone" Steve replied.
"Stop laughing grandpa" Tony said.
Steve came close and gently kissed him. "You okay? want me to come with you to check on Pete and Rhodey?" He asked. Steve could see the trouble in his sweetheart's eyes but he knew Tony if you push him he will run away.
"We just wanted to have a nice time with you Tony" Nat smiled.
"I am fine" Tony whispered as Steve kept staring at him.
"That was hell of a speech" Tony whispered. Steve just looked down and nodded. Tony reached out and lifted Steve's face up. Tony could see the tears.
"It has been long" Tony whispered.
They arrived at the tower on time and saw Clint, Laura and the kids were missing. Steve wasnt there as well which was weird. Vision had flown himself in the morning hoping to convince Wanda about Stephen. Everyone gathered around and were waiting. Wanda was there but she was giving Carol the stink eye and carol did not back off and returned the hatred.
" I need some help" Tony replied.
"I wont take long dont worry. I have realised we have limited time Steve and I do not want to spend that time fighting with you" Tony said.
"Strange for god sake get your Cloak away from me. You Cloak make up your mind one day this thing is hitting me and next its hugging me. Tony said annoyed but he was not that annoyed. Strange just rolled his eyes and it came back. Steve just stood there. He was not liking this at all.
"Well I think i control them fine but apparently Stark here thinks he knows it all" Wanda replied.
"Tony calm down you are breathing really hard"
"Yeah Jerk. Bucky are you sure you want Tony with you in there? I know I am not allowed and I will be watching from outside with everyone else but T'challa can do it" Steve said.
"Well you left me no choice, should I go and kick his Ass" Stephen asked.
"Well as soon as we go to the tower kid"
"Hi and its Doctor Strange" Stephen corrected him.
"I am fine you guys" Steve said.
"Steve stop getting Jealous over Stephen he is just a friend, you need to stop this. I had a panic attack and he was helping me. Go on tell me that you are jealous about it. Do you even trust me?" Tony replied. He was frustrated. Steve had never been jealous like this before over anyone.
"I am glad you liked it Tony"
"I am so sorry Steve I-" Tony was interrupted by Steve.
"He just have a couple of fractures and a concussion, with his fast metabolism and serum he will heal in 2-3 days. He can leave by tonight" The doctor explained Tony.
"I dont know if you will agree or not but in worst case scenario I am willing to take the blame. It will keep the video away. I know Tony was stressed about the video and I will plead guilty if that means the video will never come out" Steve said.
"Thanks Tony really appreciate it and stop calling me Sammy" Sam replied smiling. Tony knew he did not like the name but he enjoyed pissing him off.
"Thank you Tony it means a lot I know we did not have the best start I mean I-" Scott was interrupted by Tony
"Well I am planning to take her with me to Kamar Taj for a month to test her ability and provide her better control. Do you think she will agree?"
"Welcome Avengers. We are prepared for the Trial. We will have Bruce's Trial first. There will be 2 other people with Ms Romanov in the room. We will evaluate what Hulk does around them and see the threat level. Mr Barnes you will have Mr Stark inside with you. Mr Ross has designed these task and he would be administrating them with his team." The council members explained the whole process. Ross stood there with a smirk which they all noticed but didnt comment.
"What are you guys up to anyway" Tony asked
A doctor was waiting for them as soon as they arrived. Bucky was transferred to the Hulk room to make sure the person who woke up was Barnes and not the winter soldier. He was taken to the hospital floor and it turned out Tony had one dislocated arm, a dislocated rib, a sprained ankle and some bruises. Peter was unaware of the whole mess. When they entered the common room was half decorated.
“FIX HIM NOW!” Tony screamed, stepping closer and pressing the gun in the doctor’s face, unable to bring himself to look at Bucky.
“I told you before I wasn’t going to leave you, right?” Steve smiled back at him, seeing no reason why he shouldn’t stay there with Bucky. And if he changed his mind down the road, Steve knew he’d leave with him then. Bucky was his life now, he didn’t want anything else. Even if that meant moving in with Tony Stark. Though he had to admit, Tony made it look like a very good option.
“…do you have cards?” Steve asked, figuring it would be an easy thing to buy if he didn’t, and there were countless games they could play.
Bucky didn’t say anything, slowly getting out from underneath the blanket, sitting up and hugging himself tightly as he nodded a little.
“What?” Bucky’s question was lost as Tony kissed him hard again, pinning him down against the bed. Closing his eyes, he felt Tony’s fingers encircling his wrist, pushing it down against the mattress as he slid partially on top of him. The weight of being pinned down under Tony was enough to elicit a weak groan from Bucky, though he didn’t break the kiss.
“I’m going to admit, I’d like that too,” Sarah laughed, hugging Steve’s arm closer as a couple of people pushed past them. “It would be nice to not have to worry about you, too.”
“It’s not that I’m not happy, it’s…” Steve swallowed hard, feeling like he had to make this decision right here and now. It was either his safety, or Peggy’s, and there’s no way he couldn’t pick her. If Stark was going to kill him for this move, at least Peggy wasn’t going to get caught in the crossfire. “Peggy…we need to talk.”
“Bucky??” Tony got out of bed quickly, grabbing a t-shirt and a pair of sweatpants off the chair in their room, running for the stairs. “Bucky, where are you?” Rushing down the stairs, ready to throw his clothes on once he hit the bottom, he was momentarily relieved to see Bucky until he realized that he was on his hands and knees on the floor. “Steve!!”
“What did the Princess do?” Steve asked, unable to help his curiosity. “I don’t imagine princesses get thrown up on much.”
“It doesn’t all look like this, but it is a nice country. We can take a vacation one time, do a few of the cities, whenever Bucky’s feeling up to travelling,” Tony said as he looked out the window at the mountains, surprised by how green this place was, that hadn’t really come up in his research. Though he supposed some things were just that much better in person. “No rush, though, we’ve got lots of time.”
“I still can’t believe I’m a King, but I couldn’t picture my life without you two in it,” Bucky smiled as he looked down at his hand in Steve’s, reaching to take Tony’s with his other hand. “It’s been so surreal, I still can’t believe this is all happening, but we’ve really helped people. We’ve done a lot in not a lot of time, and I think we should be proud of ourselves for it.”
“And I don’t feel like waiting either. Too much is at stake,” Stane pointed out. It was more than just comfort that was concerning him. Though at least he knew Steven and James were actually dead this time, even if it had taken a few of his own guards to do the job. At least one came back to tell him it was done.
“No, we won’t,” Sarah admitted, adding a splash of milk to the hot tea, bringing it over to her son with a smile. “How was your day aside from helping ladies with their shopping?”
“I don’t know exactly, I think it’s like fifty percent.”
“So…so I should wait until after the funeral?” That would make keeping the act up easier, he could pretend to be sad until then, and after that he could concentrate on being a good ruler with his husbands by his sides.
“Can we do it right now?” Bucky asked, brightening a bit as he looked between them. “Right now, in this bed, it’s perfect.”
“Am I taking a turn?” Bucky asked, not touching the cards, looking over them into Steve’s eyes.
Howard makes his move, and Tony is forced to act.
“And you shall have them,” the priest said as he turned from them to the rest of the congregation. “Children of the Gods, rejoice, for we are about to see the creation of one new family from three. We will witness as these three men pledge themselves to each other, and the future of our kingdom. They will learn from the successes and mistakes of the past, and move forward to write their history in our books, and more importantly, the tomes of our Gods. Blessed are they.”
“Do you think this guy knows what he’s doing?” Bucky whispered to Steve as he did his best to walk like an old man towards the doors. The hood covered more of his face than he realized, he had to follow the sound of Fury’s footfalls in front of him.
“Sure, what is it?” Bucky said as he stopped outside the guest room, the sound of the shower coming from the closed bathroom door.
“Basically,” Tony admitted, figuring there was no need to hold back now. “But it worked out a lot better than I thought it would, I’ll admit. I didn’t know who I was going to end up with but…you two have to be the best candidates out there.”
“I’m sorry,” frowned Tony, swallowing hard. “Is it hard for you to be here around them? I didn’t mean to…I mean, how could I have known, but…you know what I’m trying to say.”
“I have to admit, it would be nice to have real paints and brushes,” Steve agreed, letting out a long, slow breath as he looked up at the green lantern hanging from the post beside him. “I’d like even more for you to not have to work.”
“You sound a lot better than most of the soldiers out there,” said Tony, unable to picture Steve as being a bully. He seemed gentler and more peaceful than the others Tony had known in that profession, and he was thrilled for that. The last person he wanted to marry was an asshole who beat up people for fun.
“Your thirty fifth-“
“Cupcakes, four of them,” Steve said, opening the box to show them off. He’d gone to this shop before, and he’d always been happy with what he brought home, especially the lemon vanilla ones, though Peggy swore by the red velvet. “I got a lemon vanilla, chocolate raspberry, carrot cake, and coffee creme. I had no idea what you’d like, so I got my four favourites and figured you could have first pick of them.”
“…can I hold them?” Bucky asked, looking back and forth between Tony and Steve, desperate to see his babies now that he was awake and clear headed enough to know what had happened.
“Nothing you do is terrible,” Steve sat down in his armchair, lifting his glass to his lips. “I think we’ve all established that you’re incredibly wonderful and brilliant all the time.”
“Can I bring my friends? Two of them, or one, I don’t know about the other,” Bucky said softly, looking up at Tony, afraid to make eye contact, though he managed to.
“Please don’t drag the past into this,” Bucky said softly, closing his eyes.
“I hope they’re something good, he deserves some happiness after today,” Tony turned his attention to the fetal monitor, not entirely sure what numbers were good or not. He was going to have to get filled in by the doctor. “I hope he doesn’t wake up until we know they’re okay.”
“If you say so,” Bucky picked up his second piece of bread, taking a bite, looking at his visibly nervous friend. “…what is it? We’re not being kicked out, are we?”
“Windows…I know what they are but I’ve never really seen one,” Bucky said, laughing dryly before taking a drink. “They look great.”
The guys have an emotional morning and find out what they're having.
After hours in the air, most of which Bucky spent airsick, curled up, and avoiding the windows as Steve and Tony sat trying to think of something to talk about that didn’t remind them of their current situation. They’d talked about their childhoods, taking time to describe everything Bucky didn’t understand, before moving on through high school and college, laughing when they realized they both had a crush on the same famous women at the time. It had been lighthearted for a while, but things inevitably went dark again as time passed. Even though they had the time and privacy, Tony hadn’t wanted to discuss the pregnancy, choosing to lean back in his seat with a scotch instead whilst Bucky slept against Steve. When the plane finally touched down in the smallest town Tony and Steve had ever seen, they woke Bucky for the next stage of their journey.
“My patience with you is growing thin,” Von Doom seethed, his eyes practically burning with anger. “I want the Iron Kingdom, I want to strip it down like I did Latveria, and I want all the money and resources in my hands.”
“Exactly,” Tony said as he walked over to it, resting Bucky on the bed, and leaning in to start undressing him. “You’re in good hands, baby.”
Bucky opened his mouth, looking between them, and past them to their children who were all playing together peacefully for once. Around him was their home, in the middle of nowhere, though no one ever complained even though he knew it was with him in mind. In that moment, there was silence, except for the sound of the wind in the trees and a bird in the distance, and everything seemed so perfect that it couldn’t be real.
“So they’ve threatened you if you say anything, I assume?” Sam asked, keeping his voice low. “How closely are you being watched?”
“He’s just a soldier.”
“There’s two moving things, that…” Steve said as he leaned in a bit, furrowing his brow as he tried to think of what that could be.
“Is that your way of telling me to leave?” Tony asked flatly, raising an eyebrow as stared down Fury’s good eye. “I am your King, you know.”
“I’m not talking about Pepper. Pepper is an awful choice,” Stane said with as gentle a voice as he could manage. “She’s a very good assistant, she’d be impossible to replace. And you can’t have your wife acting as your servant, that won’t…no, I don’t think it’s a good idea at all.”
“The client is here on the premises, you’ll be dealing with them face to face,” Ms. Carr said, knowing that this was where it was going to be harder to keep Steve. “Your client is a young man, he’ll be eighteen in a few weeks, his name is James Barnes, and he lives here where we can monitor him. He’s very special, and we want him to be happy and comfortable, so we have a member of staff take care of his more social and emotional needs.”“O-ooh…” Steve blinked, a little surprised that they picked him to babysit a teenager. He used to babysit the boys next door growing up, but he had a feeling this was going to be very different. There had to be a catch to this, it all sounded too good to be true. “Where will I be doing this?”
“I’ll be fine,” Bucky said as he walked awkwardly away, trying his best not to waddle as he headed up the stairs, hanging tightly to the railing.
“No no no,” Steve was about to grab a hold of him again when the hatch to their attic hiding spot opened with a bang. Before Steve could grab something to fight the intruder with, a tall, imposing figure with a bald head and an eyepatch came into view.
“We’ll never know, will we?” sighed Steve, hating whenever his past health was brought up. It was so long ago, and he barely got ill now, so he preferred to not think about that night or the sacrifice made for him.
Bucky took a hold of Tony’s arm, reaching out for Steve’s as they left the room to go to Tony’s. He loved how he felt between the two men, like nothing could hurt him, and that he had everything to live for. And as Tony lead them to the end of the hall into a large red and grey bedroom, Bucky couldn’t help but stare at the floor to ceiling windows, not to mention the view behind them.
“He’s the King, he can take as long as he wants,” Steve reminded her, straightening his new royal blue outfit, feeling awkward wearing the white fur lined cape that went with it. He’d never work clothes like this before, he didn’t imagine it would be possible to do anything but stand around in them. Even the black leather shoes pinched his feet. It wasn’t his toes that he was concentrating on, though; the object of his attention was sitting on the other side of the room looking gorgeous in black.
“I seriously hope not,” said Bucky as he took a seat next to Natasha, looking over at Clint and raising a hand. “I don’t have an issue with you, man, it’s the situation. I kind of figured marrying Tony would put a target on my back. I just didn’t think it would be this fast. I probably should have.”
“You’re going to do so well, Bucky. I’m so proud of you,” Standing up, Steve took the bucket from Bucky, setting it on the chair behind him so he could take his hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze. “You’re amazing, and we’re going to be right there. Our family is going to be perfect. I love you all so much already.”
“He’s never really wanted to talk about that,” Natasha said, keeping her arm across the door, not moving an inch. “You have to understand that I’m not about to let you hurt him.”
“What do you think they would have put in there?” Tony asked, shifting on his stool as he reached out to take Bucky’s hand in his own.
“Steve,” Sarah said sadly, reaching across the table to touch his hand. “He might win, you never know. You’re right though, he would deserve it, but so do you.”
“Don’t touch me…don’t TOUCH me!” Tony pulled away, staring at Howard in disgust, nausea rolling over him. “What have you fucking done??”
“Tony, this isn’t up for discussion, this needs to happen,” Stane was going to shut Tony down before he could even start to argue. “This visit is a blessing from the gods, and we’re going to take it as such. I hate to say that Steven and James died for fate to play out this way, but this is really for the best. This will give you the life you want.”
“Come on, it looks like we’ve both had crazy mornings, what would you like to play?” Steve asked as he walked over to the games, looking for the titles Bucky liked more. “How about this one? You can laugh at me when the bosses scare me. Or we can play a driving game and you can see if you can beat me by a whole lap again.”
“Wakanda knows, I told King T’Challa. He wished me good luck,” Tony swirled his whiskey in his glass as it was handed to him, picking up a piece of cheese from the accompanying platter. “And I came up with it. I didn’t want to marry some high class snob, I wanted to marry someone with some substance. And you two fit that pretty well, I think my lottery was a success.”
“You wanted to speak to us?” Steve asked, a bit surprised to see that Bucky was there as well, though he wasn’t upset about it. The two had met in the hall outside, and, guessing what the meeting was about, had wished each other luck before coming in.
“Believe it,” Tony gave them a tight-lipped smile, realizing that they probably had no idea how boring this opulence was. They would soon, they’d probably leave this place to go back to a normal life if they knew what they were getting into.
“No, I like pineapple, I’ve only had it a couple times though, so I was wondering if that’s what it was,” Bucky said as he took another drink, holding the glass in both hands as he looked at Steve. “…so what’s it like living here by choice? It’s got to be different than this.”
“Bucky, holy shit, get up!” Steve hurried to his side, wanting to pull him out of there so he could finish the work himself. He wasn’t denying that this was a good idea.
Steve wasn’t prepared for Bucky to turn his head towards him, gasping a little as their lips brushed. When Bucky didn’t pull away, however, Steve decided to ignore the nervous voices in his head and take the plunge. Pressing his lips tightly against Bucky’s, Steve closed his eyes and moaned softly, melting in the familiar embrace. Kissing Bucky was like coming home; he’d missed this more than words could say.
“No, please don’t leave, I don’t…” Tony got to his feet in a hurry, fumbling with his hands before he finally put them behind him. “I don’t think I’d have the nerve to call you back in here if you went.”
“I can do that, of course,” Tony grinned, putting a hand over his heart. “I promise you, I’ll be on my best behavior.”
“You fucking tease,” Tony moaned, looking down at him, and breathing hard. He hadn’t expected Bucky to be so bold and playful in bed, and he was enjoying the prospect at more of this behaviour. “Does he do this with you too, Steve?”
“I’m okay with doing this now,” Bucky said, figuring there was no point putting a shirt on for a woman that was going to see him naked soon.
“Yeah, it’s great. Uhm, what are the rings of yellow sweet fruit called?” Bucky asked, wishing he hadn’t eaten it all so he could show her.
“Don’t worry, we’re no going to the big airport, this is a smaller one, no one’s going to be looking for us here,” Tony said, driving away from the city towards an airport just outside of it. He didn’t want to be anywhere with cameras, he didn’t know who was watching for his father, and he wasn’t going to risk being followed. “There won’t be crowds, you might not even meet with the pilot, you don’t have to worry about that.”
“No, I’m not marrying some snob. It’s bad enough I have to spend my days surrounded by them,” Tony shook his head, not paying close enough attention to his uncle to notice the man tense up. “I want to marry someone nice. Someone that will want to do their own thing so I can do mine here. Maybe they can help Pepper run this place.”
“Natasha, seriously, look at me,” Bucky said, standing up straight and taking a drink of beer, doing a slow turn around. “If I win, they’re just going to pick another number.”
“Let’s get you out of here,” Tony said, leading the other men up the stairs into his father’s office, hoping that Howard had made himself very scarce. He still needed to figure out what he was going to do with him, he had to make sure he couldn’t get out of it somehow. “Bucky, do y-oh no, are you okay?”
“Do the other kingdoms know how you’re choosing your spouse?” Bucky asked, wondering if anyone else had ever done something like this before. “Where did you get the idea?”
“I promise you, Mom, you’re not holding me back,” Steve reassured her as he went to take his seat at the table across from his mother. “I should invite Sam over for your stew one day, I’m sure he’s sick of whatever they’re serving in the barracks tonight.”
“What did my mother know? What did you know before you came here?” Tony shrugged, taking the fresh coffee with a smile.
“You view things too negatively,” Stane chastised as he finally got his wine, wasting no time drinking it. “There are many good people in those courts.”
“What do you have that could make me forget the concept of chance?” Tony asked, letting out a long breath, not moving an inch otherwise.
“Hey…” Steve said, getting up from his chair to sit on the bed next to Bucky, pulling him into a hug with one arm. “Don’t worry, I’ve heard Tony is nice, just kind of weird. Not weird, that’s not really a nice word, but…quirky. I haven’t met him myself, but I know he’s really smart, and that he’s charitable. Don’t worry about it now when it’s just speculation, okay? You’ll drive yourself insane.”
“I promise,” Bucky said softly, reaching up to rub at his eyes, wiping them on his flannel pants when he was done. “I really love you, Tony, I really do.”
“Have you slept at all? What time did you get in?” Howard asked, ignoring his smart mouthed child, wondering how he turned out like that between him and his late wife.
“I’m not talking to you,” Bucky replied sharply, looking at the neatly pinned sleeve where his left arm should be. It was nice to not have to knot the sleeve and cut it off himself.
“I love you too…” Bucky murmured in reply, not moving an inch.
“That’s very optimistic of you,” Stane kicked himself mentally for sounding too sour on the occasion. He’d had a few drinks, and it loosened his tongue. “Which is a good thing, you’re willing to keep an open mind.”
“That means he will be leaving here and moving on to his new home, where your services may still be required,” Ms. Carr said with a tight smile as Steve went back to reading the contract. “If you choose to end your employment when he turns eighteen, you will be rewarded handsomely for your silence in this matter. To put it lightly, you won’t ever need to worry about money again whichever path you choose.”
“Y-yellow I think…” Bucky said as he sat up, watching as Tony walked over to his door to open it. “Like…if orange was an option, I’d say orange.”
“I hate being called that, you know it,” Bucky snorted, looking down at his hand in his lap.
Pepper gave Tony the flattest look she could muster, not moving an inch as her arms fell at her side. If her expression was an action, she’d be throttling Tony at the moment.
“I was never at the bottom of that list,” Steve protested, pressing a kiss to Bucky’s shoulder, nuzzling the spot. “I was right up at the top. I was just a fucking idiot that couldn’t tell you that.”
“I felt bad, Bucky, I was horrified. I stayed back because I thought you’d hate me,” Steve said weakly, still hating that he’d been such a coward. Bucky would have needed him them more than ever, and instead he stayed back out of fear of his anger. “I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, I never meant to make you think I was using you. I was a kid, I didn’t know what to do, I’d just seen you lose your arm and I was a chicken.”
“It’s stunning,” Bucky said after a moment of stunned silence, shaking his head. “You even got the spot on Bess’s head right. It’s perfect, it’s…it’s being hung in here, right? I want to look at this a lot.”
“Right now, that’s what I want,” Bucky reassured them softly. “All this running today, and all I could think was that I didn’t want your dad to get me because he’d kill me, and he’d kill this baby if it was Steve’s, and…and I want to protect them. I want this. I know I might lose it because my pregnancies will all be risky, but I want to try. And most of all…thank you to you two for letting me make this decision because I doubt it was easy to sit back and wait for me to say something.”
“And hello to you too, Steve,” Tony grinned, bringing out his hand from behind his back, holding a long, flat box. “I come with gifts.”
“You don’t know the Asgardians. They’re a rough bunch, the Princess fights as much as the Princes do, and drinks the same,” Tony realized he was going to have to coach them both a lot about the other Kingdoms. “But she still didn’t appreciate me doing it. I thought she was going to knock my teeth out.”
“Uhh, no, not really, I mean, I came out around then,” Tony said, turning his head to look at Steve again, wishing he’d met him under very different circumstances. “I left home to go to school around then too, I wasn’t around my dad to see if he was being evil.”
“No? So you do want me to show you the others.”
“Hey, if it’s your arm, I don’t think it’s cheating. It’s not like you’re bringing in a ringer or something,” Steve said, wanting to ask about it, but not feeling like it was his place to get too personal at this point.
“Why? It’s nothing to be ashamed of,” Tony smiled as their eyes met, having caught Bucky looking at him, and vice versa. “I mean it. You don’t think you have a disadvantage with me because of that, do you?”
“What are you going to do, set them up?” Bucky asked, pouring another glass for himself from the selection of bottles on the little table near the bed.
“There’s lots of shades of blue material, I’m sure that we can find you both something you like,” Pepper watched as Jarvis combed out Steve’s hair, his scissors seeming to have a life of their own as small blond hairs floated to the floor. “For now, we’ll have some comfortable clothes brought to you until yours are finished. But knowing our tailors, it won’t take long.”
“So what are you doing here yourself, Sire, if you don’t mind me asking?” Fury stood up from his seat on the cold stone, walking over to Tony. “It’s usually your Uncle I see if things aren’t going quite right. Is he well?”
“Can you marry us both?” Steve asked, handing Tony his glass and wrapping a strong arm around Bucky’s shoulders to pull him close. “Is this realistic? Can this actually happen?”
“The doors open on both sides for each floor down to the sixth floor, but it only opens on this side on the eighth floor because of your clearance. If someone gets in the elevator with you and requests a floor, it will go straight to their floor and the door on the eighth won’t open until you request your floor again with your badge and scans,” Ms. Carr explained as the elevator descended, turning to exit through the back into a hallway lit only by emergency lighting. Leading Steve down a hallway of offices empty save for stacks of old boxes here and there, she stopped at the fifth room on the left. “Your pass works here as well, even if the scanner looks old, it works just fine.”
“I have something to tell you, and I need you to really listen to me, because this isn’t something small,” Howard said, clearing his throat as he thought about the careful speech he’d been planning for fourteen years, thought for the life of him, he couldn’t remember a word of it right now. “Tony, I have a solution to our heir issue.”
“I think you’re right, I think this is the best place for him, even if we have to pay for our own doctor to live nearby,” Steve frowned a little, looking at Bucky’s face as he flinched a bit. “I think he’s dreaming…”
Putting the piece of wire down, Tony took a long drink of his coffee and turned towards his walking table on the table with him. His father was right, he did need to work on the joints so it could walk more fluidly, he just didn’t want to admit that the man had been right. He also didn’t want to admit that Howard had found someone he’d like, someone he could fall in love with, and someone that could bring him children. In that moment, he wondered how much of Bucky’s personality was Howard’s programming, and he felt even sorrier for him.
“But you took that risk?” Tony asked rhetorically with rueful shake of his head. “My own mother.“
Steve hummed as he finished his last bite and washed it down with some Coke. “Won’t happen to you, Buck. You got me.”
she needed to hear everything. “I’ve had one night stands, sure; even friends with benefits occasionally. But… a date, a relationship? I’ve never… needed that. What—how do you ask someone out on a date?”
How Steve resisted shamelessly preening over his unexpected special delivery in front of all his envious colleagues was anybody’s guess. But since he had no better place to put the flowers during the work day, Steve left the full vase with reception and only took the card with him when he went on break to make the happy call.
Tony was heedless to all the spit he slobbered up and down Steve’s crack in his wake, and when it first started dribbling down to wet Steve’s balls, Steve reacted with a full-body shudder. The mounting need was driving him wild, and without thinking Steve reached back to grab one side of his ass to pull even harder, a silent demand for Tony to fuck his thumbs into him, to fill him, to cure him of this sweet, hollow ache.
When they get to the car, Happy and Pepper sit together in the front seat and leave Tony alone with his thoughts.
Steve scratches at his wrist, the burn licking halfway up his arm now. Something wasn’t right. Tony has taken more hard hits than Steve could count and though the soulmark has ached and prickled before, it hasn’t burned quite like this. For a moment he’s grateful that medical is on standby, and Tony would be there first.
“I think you’ll find you like me cocky.” Tony grinned back, thrusting against him from where he sat up on his knees, one hand under the hem of his shirt, the other buried in Steve’s hair. Tony was hard, rutting into the divot of his lower back and setting his stomach alight with desire.
“How are you?”
“Happier than a pig in shit. How are you? Happy keeping you busy? I bet he is, that old dog.”
“Let me go! Damn it, let me go!” He fought, thrashed against the grip that held him fast with as much strength as a day-old kitten, prepared to bite his way free if he had to.
“What?” Steve asks, flatly, trying to focus.
“What do you want me to say, here?” Rhodes asks in a tone that makes Steve bristle. “If this doesn’t have your daddy issues written all over it, I don’t know what does. Do you want a supportive best man? Or a getaway car? Whatever you want, it’s yours.”
There’s no time to respond because Tony comes face to face with the rest of the team and the planning starts. This time, there’s no excuse for time alone which is a small blessing and allows Tony to focus on the work. This time, he can avoid being trapped in the past.
The muscles in Tony’s back shifted and bunched as Steve urged his body into his lap, lifting Tony effortlessly across his thighs to wrap an arm around his belly. With his face still turned against the pillows, Steve could watch as Tony’s eyelids fluttered again while he slid his palm over the length of Tony’s erection. It wept over his fingers, already a mouth-watering shade of red and begging to be touched.
“Don’t go.” Steve watches, numb, when Tony crosses the room only to linger in the doorway. “Let’s—Tony, can we talk about this?”
“Thank you. Steve told me what you said and–”
Then the kid appears behind him on a delicate strand of webbing and the day gets impossibly worse.
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers to the ceiling. They’re lying together, weeks after half the world disappeared, in the too-large bed with the too-wide space between them. They aren’t touching and haven’t in longer than Steve can remember in all the time they’ve been together.
“He wouldn’t want this.” Bucky’s voice is already softening but it wavers with carefully checked anger, as if he thinks Steve can’t tolerate being yelled at now.
“I told him you would.”
“I wish I could stay here forever.” Steve lets his head drop back against the pillows. He curls Tony closer to his chest. “Is that selfish of me?”
“Fuck, I love you. I missed you so much, Tony. Wake up, love,” Steve gasped out, flattening a hand over Tony’s lower back and forcing him down into the mattress where his cock could rub up against the sheets.
“Everyone already knows you belong to me. The way you walk around like you own the world, with my marks all over you. The man who has everything. Mine.”
It was ridiculous, really, to have such an attachment to something so meaningless and trivial. And couldn’t he see just picture himself: admitting the truth, bulky shoulders crammed into Father McCarthy’s confessional box in the heart of Brooklyn.
It doesn’t escape Steve that Tony hasn’t offered an affirmative on whether or not he’ll help, but he pushes that aside.
It’s a hammer to his fingertips, and Tony starts to shut him out. He closes the door where Steve can’t reach him, throws up the wall meant for everyone else. Everyone else, not Steve.
“It would have been better than this. Do you hear me?” Tony grips the hair at Steve’s nape and tugs until Steve’s looking at him, yanking with enough force that he should be ripping Steve’s hair at the root, but doesn’t. “What you’ve done is worse, Steve.”
Tony gets a sharp twinge, nothing more than a glimmer of a forgotten feeling.
“The Accords have been suspended until the threats have been dealt with. Apparently, politics don’t matter in the face of a universal emergency, go figure. As for your little girlfriend, I’m assuming someone there must be assigned to his care. We’ll make arrangements for them to continue to do so when he’s back in the US.” Then, as an afterthought, “is he even safe enough to be here, or should I be preparing for some sort of containment?”
He must, if he’s gone to this length to break these memories.
They meet at Tony’s private airstrip a half hour later and spend the six-hour flight curled up in each other’s arms. Tony seems set on seeing how worked up Steve can get before the plane touches down, leaving him awkwardly rearranging in his jeans when Tony is hauling him up out of his seat and down the gangway.
Tony flushed hot.
“He looked me over and told Pepper, ‘I want one’ after he finished drooling all over my shoes.” Natasha laughs. “God, you were such a pig, remember?”
Whatever Peter has said to Steve has had a significant impact. Steve keeps his head down during drills, barking orders and relaying Bucky’s observations clearly and efficiently only as much as is needed to improve performance. Bucky still doesn’t fight with the team, but he’s agreed to give it a try when Tony’s done working on a new arm.
has an opinion.
“Why don’t you give Bucky a call and let him know the arm’s almost ready?” Tony nudges him back towards the holograms waiting for his attention.
He’s home.
Tony might have felt exposed, belly up, head thrown back revealing the swelling gland at his neck, but he couldn’t feel anything more than desperate, heady desire.
Tony draws a long breath and tips his head back against the thin hospital pillow. It’s unfair that he’s thinking about this again, but then, when has life with Steve Rogers ever been fair? Tony gives and gives and gives of himself, always has, to a fault really, and Steve sits back and basks in the glow of Tony’s charity.
Sometime late in the night, Steve woke up cold again.
“Goddamn it, Steve. What the hell are you doing to yourself down here?” Steve barely sees Bucky as tears mix with the blurred specks now dancing across his vision.
Shirt tossed to the floor, Steve’s hands glide through his hair, tracing the lines of his jaw and pet down his chest in a sweeping arc that should warm him from the inside out. It shatters everything,
“And then you came here and you still picked Captain America over everything else. You’re a selfish man, Steve. Everyone always thinks it’s me.” Tony draws soft fingers over the head of his cock again and Steve flinches away. “I love you anyway, Steve. How fucked is that?”
“I can’t believe after everything, you’re just going to walk away.”
Steve looks like Tony’s kicked the living crap out of him (again).
Well. That was unexpected. Tony doesn’t quite know what to make of that.
He hasn’t been called away on any more missions, but all of a sudden, he appears more preoccupied. Tony tells himself that he doesn’t care, but that’s clearly a lie, because where on earth could their fearless leader be sneaking off to for long periods of time?
A sob breaks free and Steve hadn’t even realized he was holding them back. His throat feels perpetually raw these days because when the sobs come, they don’t stop. He presses his fingers into his eyes but when he closes them, Tony is still there.
“Everyone wants to see the arm, no one wants to get to know the guy attached to it,” Bucky grumbles, but there’s a softness in his tone that puts Tony at ease. He must have come along way, he thinks, because he trusts Bucky with the kid.
It’s shameful and he feels humiliated, as if he’s willing to just get down on his knees and beg Steve to take him back so he doesn’t have to be so alone anymore. Its reminiscent of a dog, begging at the corner of the table, happy for any scraps that might be tossed his way.
The battlefield starts to fade away and Tony’s body drifts into nothingness. The last thing Steve sees is the blank, unseeing darkness of his eyes before the scene peels back like the nanites of the Iron Man suit, leaving the room a crisp, stark white.
“You should know that Sir considered removing the protocol last year.”
There’s a series of gasps and
Before Steve even opens his eyes, he knows he’s back in Avengers Tower. The thick, old blankets curl around him and a lifetime of memories drifting through the apartment. Of all the places his mind takes him in his sleep, Steve hasn’t been here in years.
“Then I guess it’s time for dinner, isn’t it Platypus?”
“I’m not sulking, Tony. I’m grieving. I’m happy that this is so easy for you, but I’m not like you.” Steve shakes his head and slaps the envelope against his knees. “This—maybe this meant—maybe we just meant more to me.”
“And you didn’t say anything? You didn’t think I deserved that much?”
“Perfect. You better start packing then, your flights leave first thing tomorrow morning.” A notification pops up on his cell phone notifying him that the documents are already in T’Challa’s possession, and that’s that.
” Comes Steve’s stiff reply. “
Steve groans and strong thighs squeeze at Tony’s hips. “Now you want to be a sap? Now?”
Anger sparks underneath his cool composure and the tick in his jaw tells Tony that he’s on the right track. He’ll push him further if he needs to, if that’s what it’s going to take to. Steve doesn’t reply, but his breathing changes and betrays him.
When Steve inevitably drifts off, Tony will be there waiting for him with a smile on his face and his arms wide open.
“Not my kid.”
“I don’t need you to
Natasha pulls away but she doesn’t go far, tucking in against one side as Tony rests a hand on Steve’s other arm, squeezing his bicep lightly to draw his attention behind him.
“Tony. I won’t. I’m in this. Whatever you need, whatever I have to do to show you that. There’s nothing else, and there won’t ever be.”
He pulls back, rasping around a throat already rubbed raw by Steve’s cock. “Come on, Steve. Let me have it.”
“I love you too, Tony. More than you know. Thank God you’re still here.” Pepper hesitates when she turns away, closing the space between them again to kiss his face one more time, as if he might slip away before she gets back. He tries to reassure her with a light smile, letting the fingers on his good hand brush the inside of her wrist.
He watches with his breath in his throat as Tony pry the gauntlet off Peter’s wrist. Tony slides it down his own, Peter half collapsed against his chest.
“I don’t know, Tony—”
“Fuck. Fuck that was—”
The door pushes open impossibly slow and that’s exactly the sight that greets him, eyes red-rimmed and hidden in shadow, hair askew. He must have showered at some point and changed into fresh clothes but even that looks like it could have been days ago, now.
It doesn’t take much, just a hand in Steve’s hair and the almost-black depth of his eyes peering up at Tony around his cock in Steve’s mouth paired with the persistent drag of his tongue and Tony is coming in seconds. The air is punched out of his lungs, and his body curls upward with a desperate whine and a flurry of
The dining room table became a battleground, plates shoved off to the side when bellies were full and bets were thrown into the middle of the table.
Until Steve was introduced to the most arrogant, egotistical Omega he’d ever met. An Omega who strutted his way through life as if he hadn’t a care in the world. An Omega who had strutted into
“Fine. I’ll call him.”
Tony leaned back against the workbench for a minute, shovelling another bite of pasta into his mouth. A wistful look fluttered across his features, as if temporarily he belonged somewhere else.
“You can’t be serious.” Tony grits his teeth.
after all this time has his burrowing closer, desperate to climb inside Steve’s skin and stay there forever.
The chiming of Steve’s phone in his pocket draws him away before the exchange goes any further. Tony doesn’t watch him stride out of the room, exchanging sharp words with someone on the other end.
Steve groans and jolts forward, cock leaving a damp trail along the back of Tony’s thigh. Is this really what it can be like for them? The rest of their lives?
Watching Steve and Tony dance around each other had been a unique form of torture, especially after he’d caught on to what Steve loved about the Omega. Tony was a force to be reckoned with, all harsh words and cutting remarks. When he laughed, which had been rare in the beginning, Bucky felt it down in his toes.
Peter ducks in from his left, and before he can warn Peter off, his hand is inside the gauntlet, molding to his fingers. Beams of light travel up his arm, and Peter shrieks, eyes wide with horror and bright, sharp pain.
She can hear him. A small mercy. Maybe he’s not dead after all.
“What?” Steve demands, going for disparaging, but Tony’s smile is infectious. Before Steve can help himself, he’s returning it.
He’s a weak man. For Steve, for the booze. For all of it. Tony just wants to feel good, that’s all he’s ever been after his entire unfortunate life and every twist and turn the world throws at him threatens to steal that away.
Bucky doesn’t bite. “This isn’t processing or reliving memories Steve. I saw what you were… creating. It’s not even half of what happened and this is just—Christ, this is torture.”
Tony looks at him. He stares right into Steve’s eyes.
Howard is shouting, berating one of the staff, Jarvis maybe, Tony can’t see past his turned back, and Maria steps between them to tell Howard to stop.
The shop owner’s face morphs into a look of mild irritation when Tony inevitably places another massive order. But then he nods and steps behind the counter to get to work. A younger woman approaches with a plastic container, pushing it towards Tony, and he thanks her with one of those dazzling smiles.
His eyes flicker across the newest memory. Steve is in the yard outside of Clint’s farmhouse, dripping with sweat and glistening, all bronzed god in the sun.
them, as clearly as if they were all sitting on the bed with him.
Steve hesitates in the doorway and doesn’t speak. He opens his mouth more than once, but the words don’t come.
“You made this?” Steve asked, an odd cocktail of surprise and awe, marked with notes of reverence Tony hadn’t been anticipating. He tugged the blanket up over his face before Steve added, softer and with more finality, “you made this? For
Tony shakes out his shoulders and wills himself to remember that it doesn’t really matter because Steve has apologized and they’ve had some mind-blowing make-up sex. Steve has said things are going to be different. They’ve
Today they speak cruelty to each other like a love language.
Tony closed his eyes, worming his way deeper into the cozy pile. “Love you too.”
God, Tony loves when they can laugh like this. When sex is playful and meaningful and so incredibly deep and they don’t need to fuck each other fast and dirty. Not that he complains when Steve fucks into him like it’s their last moments on earth. But this… this is something else entirely.
“Tony, why are we here?”
FRIDAY had said he was going through a rapid fire of sequencing before getting stuck into a feedback loop. So, if all the memories were like this, somewhere, Steve was hitting a dead end. As long as the scenes keep switching, they were only repeating of memories that Steve had been successful in altering, be it enough to cope, or put it behind himself.
on his face. It can’t be a smile, can it?
Steve groans and heaves his massive bulk sideways, crawling back up until he can curve his arms around Tony’s good side and pull him in close. He lays there with his hands stroking over Tony’s chest and belly and traces little patterns in the wiry hair he finds there.
If Steve could just admit that maybe, for once in his life, this had been his error and not Tony’s. It couldn’t always be Tony. There was a hell of a lot of things in this world he wasn’t certain he deserved, but he definitely knew he deserved better than this.
What if Steve had miscalculated? What if he’d, oh, what if he’d—
As Tony sucks on his tongue Steve realizes he never thought he’d have this again and his body lights up, buzzing with excitement. He’ll take whatever scraps Tony will give him and feed Tony his own in return.
, and uh, it’s nice to meet you all, officially, and in a chiller setting this time.”
“I think I still want kids.” It comes out in a rush, a blurt across their comforter, and once he’s spoken it aloud, Tony’s eyes go wide and surprised, as if he can’t believe he’s said it. “I know a lot has changed, but I keep thinking—”
Tony smirked, feeling light and easy, pleasure drunk.
A playful smack on the ass startles a laugh out of Tony before they’re both throwing on their clothes and Steve is retrieving his shield from the corner of the room.
“No, Cap,
“I can feel that that’s not true.” Steve growled deep in his chest; a natural response to an Omega’s –
Tony squeezes his fingers. “They haven’t told me much. Nat and Sam, they’re—there’s something they aren’t telling me, isn’t there? Besides the obvious, that is, because I’m sure you’ll remember that you told me this was just another mission and then I find out there were
“How would you feel about—”
Strong arms wrap around his shoulders, tugging him in and holding him tight in a crushing grip against Steve’s chest. They cling to each other, desperation and fear crackling the thin threads of their reunion. Steve presses his mouth to Tony’s ear, the side of his throat, the curve of his shoulder.
“Oh, God,” Steve whispers under his breath.
“Did he get you?” Steve asks with mock shock, plucking her hand up off the table and inspecting it closely. “Did he eat your fingers off?”
“Neither do I.” Steve admits, nose wrinkling slightly. “It doesn’t, uh, really change anything, does it?”
“JARVIS why?” Steve rasps into the quiet room, pressing his fists into his eyes. “Why did he—why would he—” His voice dies on a sob, that brings reinforcements until Steve is choking on air and the misery washes over him.
Tears blur across his vision and he’s near blind when he sees—oh god
“To be honest, I’m surprised you’ve held it together as well as you have,” Rhodey admits and that… well, that actually throws him a little bit.
At some point early on, Tony had told Bucky that his brain was like a sieve.
, as Steve felt heat rise on the skin of his cheeks and throat.
“This has to stop,” she whispers into his hair, hands firm and soothing as they spin circles over his back.
Tony will love Steve for the rest of his life. It’s not about that in the slightest.
Steve hangs the photo of all three of them, Steve, Tony and Bucky, in the room he’ll make into an art studio. Bucky is pressed between them, rolling his eyes at Tony’s peace sign, and the grin on Steve’s face feels like a distant, foreign memory now.
“Mr. Stark?” Peter’s voice is small and soft as he takes tentative steps forward and reaches out with one hand. Tony gazes down at his long, thin fingers feeling dazed and far away.
“Just tell ‘im to fuck off.” Bucky offered, unhelpfully, waving a hand in their direction.
He refused to let go of Steve’s hand.
Tony blinks, but his eyes refuse to open.
The streak of electric colours darts up Tony’s arm and onto his shoulder. The side of his face is alight and on fire. His eyes burn brighter still and when he meets Steve’s eyes, they’re terrified and wild. It’s as if he already knows he’s staring down the barrel and he’s ready to die.
Tony perches beside him, settling on the edge of the cushions with concern lingering in his features until the coughing stops. Eventually, he continues, “You can be anything here. I thought you would have figured that out already. So, what’ll it be? Depression beard Cap? Motorcycle Cap? Phil-Coulson’s-Wet-Dream Cap?”
“I’m not trying to bring Peter back. I’m not trying to—to replace him. Nothing could ever—” Tony’s voice shakes, and he swallows, hard. Steve’s aghast to find tears in Tony’s eyes, and the apologies can’t come quick enough.
“What is it?”
When it’s clear they don’t have the answers, and they aren’t going to bring anyone back, the world turns away. It’s an irony, staring in the face of Ross’ failed attempts to shackle them just months before the snap. Now, Ross is gone, and the world doesn’t care what the Avengers are doing.
“My partner. How could my own partner not give me the same time of day.”
It’s hard to decide whether or not that’s Steve’s perfect fantasy ending, or something Tony might really do and at this point, Tony has no idea. Bitterness has coloured these memories too severely in his own mind and reality now seems to give way to a shield in his chest and his arms wrapped around the Winter Soldier’s throat.
That had been a massive mistake, because now he has to sit in the chilled knowledge that Steve is working through memories with someone. It would make sense, if that’s what’s been taking up so much of his time.
Without warning, Steve dropped his grip on Tony’s arm and the suit banked to the right, plummeting a few hundred feet towards the frigid water before JARVIS leveled out him, thrusters flickering with the strain.
“You love this.” Steve drops a kiss on the side of his head and stretches out beside him, toeing off his shoes and crossing his arms behind his head. The sun laps at his socked feet and disappears where the shade starts at his knees.
Steve muffles a moan into Tony’s lips and that’s all it takes. The urgency rushes back anew and Tony wraps his legs around Steve’s waist, holding him down so he can shove up against him, desperate and needy for any sort of friction his neglected cock can have. Steve matches him the way he always had, thrust for thrust, kiss for kiss, shoving a hand underneath Tony’s thin t-shirt to explore bare skin.
mean aside from Iron Man needs to be the priority. Full stop. Even if the insignificant gooey jelly-bag inside is no longer, the team can still reap the benefits of all this firepower, right? It’ll be fine. Hopefully we’ll never have to use it.”
“I think I know why too. But you’ve come this far. Come on, Cap, just let me hear you say it.” Tony breathed back, a hand twitching at his side. “Wouldn’t want to make… assumptions.”
“I didn’t pick him over you. We’re not together; it’s not like that anymore. Tony, come on. You know that’s not what this is.”
The metaphor isn’t lost on him, as he rides the high of adrenaline of reconciliation all the way into a new Mark of the Iron Man boots. If only he could survive on this feeling alone, he’d never crave for another drop of booze again in his life.
Tony clears his throat, a familiar prickle behind his eyes as he blinks and looks away. He’s not going to fucking cry again. He’s not.
Steve pauses, searches his eyes for answers that he must find, because he leans back and takes his hand away, sadness dancing across his features. “I’m sorry.”
A few days after the cabbage rolls, Steve was ready for a new challenge. He’d been working his way up to asking Tony about one of his favourite dishes, prepared to make him something decadent and maybe Italian.
“Listen, you self-righteous prick—”
“Honey.” Steve looks up with watery eyes, and Tony swims in his vision. He gets up from his chair and crosses the few steps between them, settling in Steve’s lap with his knees on either side. “Take a breath.”
“I’m sorry,” Steve says. “You deserved to know and I should have told you sooner. I love you, Tony, and I’m so, so sorry.”
“Yes. I—Yes.”
When a letter starts with,
“Nothing.” Steve reaches out a hand towards Tony but stops, hand suspended above his on the bed. “Can I…?” Tony gives him the permission this time, and Steve takes one hand into both of his. His fingers are so laughably small in Steve’s massive palms. “You didn’t. In my mind, you did. I told myself it was fair game, because you hadn’t trusted me with Ultron, but that came after, remember. It was nothing you did. And I am so, so sorry Tony because you deserved more than all those lies. It was never about not trusting you. I didn’t trust myself, and us–you–were the collateral damage.”
Tony reaches past him, twisting in Steve’s grip before he realizes that he’s fishing for the bottle of lube. With a fresh wave of cool slick and Tony’s firm, tight grip wrapped around his cock, Steve groans, tugging Tony more fully onto his lap so he can line them up and savour Tony sinking down, inch by hot inch.
“Want what?”
Tony’s still flipping through an hour or so later when Steve arrives at the doorway of the workshop. Something about his posture must set off alarm bells because Steve hesitates in the entrance and doesn’t step inside.
Tony gives him an incredulous look. “It hurts
“So anyways,” Peter cut back in. “If you happen to find them, can you let me know? They’re kind of my favourite.”
The barn fills with the quiet rattle of Tony’s sobs. Eventually, he lets Steve tuck him back into his pants, and Steve wipes the drying spit off his chin before he leads Tony back up to the house.
Steve’s not going to stop, so Tony cuts him off and aims to finish this. “I do have an idea. I do understand. Only I wish it was that I couldn’t stop seeing you on our wedding day. Fuck, I wish I couldn’t stop thinking about dates or kisses or the first time you told me you loved me. Are you listening? I would kill for that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Tony—”
Tony hesitated, a self-deprecating smile on his lips. “I honestly don’t think I could get rid of it if I tried. Not yet anyway.”
Tony looks like a dream, a maniacal vision with his face pinched with strain from too long under the fluorescent lights and grease stains tracked up his arms despite freshly cleaned hands. Tony is entirely in his element, his left leg jerking a restless rhythm from where he’s perched on the edge of his chair, as if his body is just trying to keep up with the speed of his genius.
“Captain?”
He can hear Steve’s voice in his head like it was yesterday.
“Hi, sweetheart. How do you feel?”
“Okay, Tony.” The words are soft and gentle, and as she brushes past him on her way out the door, she settles a hand over his shoulder for a second. She doesn’t say anything more.
The hard-won trust Steve had gained shifted into something else and at first, Steve had been shocked when Tony had proposed an… unorthodox solution to the sleep disturbances.
Steve chose not to comment on how he’d effectively been voluntold he’d be cooking his own birthday dinner.
Steve had promised to accompany him to another dull gala that Tony hadn’t been able to get out of. He also remembers how bad he’d felt at the time, asking if he should be suspicious but knowing that he could trust Steve to provide that honest reassurance without batting an eye. Pushing that feeling down, telling himself that there was nothing to be jealous over, or insecure about, because his foundation with Steve was solid, and he’d never known a depth of love like this before.
Steve’s always taken care of him. Of both of them.
He can take the blame if Tony stays, solid as concrete in his arms.
Tonight, without even thinking, he stumbles across them all eating dinner together.
It’d be so easy to let Steve have that, to take it for himself.
Steve looks like he might say something more on the topic, but he rolls his shoulders and bites the words back. Instead, he says, “let’s just… try and talk about this.”
Steve sits back and bites down on the inside of his cheek. Now it’s just to two of them, him and Bucky, together on the floor in painful technicolour.
“I’m happy for you,” Natasha offers in earnest. “Whatever’s changed. I’m glad. You deserve this.”
It must be all the permission Tony needs because he gasps into Steve’s mouth and then he’s driving into Steve with purpose, letting his hips glide all the way back to bury himself to the hilt. If Tony wants him to feel every stroke of his cock inside him, he hits the mark. The slick sounds of their bodies meeting echo alongside Tony’s sharp little breaths and Steve’s hands slide down to Tony’s hips, tugging him closer, needing to feel him as deep as Tony can possibly get.
They’ve
Nebula is supporting almost all his weight, practically dragging him down the gangway. He’s so, so tired, his body rebelling against the idea that he might survive after he’s already resigned himself to death.
“Steve!”
His marriage is over.
Tony’s a mess really, or at least the parts of himself that he can see. Thick fingerprints litter his torso, darkest at the hips but spreading onto his belly and chest from when Steve had held him down and pounded into him from behind.
Steve slowly pulls his hand back, looking at it like something ugly and foul. “How can you even stand me touching you right now?”
Steve doesn’t bother smiling at his poor attempt at humour, always so black and white in his stoicism. He half collapses into the chair at Tony’s hip, dragging it closer but pausing with a hand hovering over Tony’s own on the bed to wait for permission. Tony watches in confusion as Steve slowly lowers his hand back into his lap, face a mask of pain and unrestrained desperation, but doesn’t touch him.
It appears there’s nothing more to be said, and he has a sneaking suspicion that Bucky already knows it anyway. As he’s stepping over the threshold back into the hallway, Bucky’s voice trails after him.
, Capsicle, he’s thinking about
“I’m not. Christ, Tony, how can you even think I’d—” The rest of his sentence gets lost when Tony grinds up against him and it’s all he can do not to whine. He’d forgotten how sensitive this body was, how it laps up physical contact and comes alive with desire.
“Yeah.” Steve laughs. He actually, genuinely laughs and he feels lighter than he has in years, heart brimming to overflow with love, everything Tony has ever represented in his world boiling down into this one, perfect moment. “Thank you.”
“Tony has to stay here,” Amy-Amanda said, soft but firm.
Tony dies anyway.
Tony’s arousal flooded the air thickly, bathing them all in coffee and hazelnuts as his mind exploded with
His horrified, snow-white face with its wide, betrayed eyes. Every inch of Steve’s body went cold, the release reduced to a distant memory.
“I’m tired, Steve. There’s nothing new to be said. Let’s just call it a night and we’ll hope next time isn’t as monumental of a shitshow, hm?”
“Yeah, I love you too.” Tony snaps, meeting his eye before he steps past him to the left and grips the door handle. “Now, get out of the way. I have a divorce certificate to pick up.” He crosses the threshold without looking back.
Tony holds his gaze for a beat, then looks away, face buried back into his tablet. He’s talking, a stream of speculation on what the spider kid is using to swing from the rooftop but Steve stops trying to follow.
It’s not fair, really. After all this time, and all the heartache, for them to get just a snippet of what things might be again. But then, if it hadn’t been for Strange and his apocalyptic revelation, Steve wouldn’t even be here in the first place.
If only Tony knew how right he was back then. Steve hardly knows who he is these days. The remnants of his team give him broken, pitying looks when they think he isn’t looking and he’s not Captain America now, hasn’t been for months. The shield doesn’t belong to him anymore, he couldn’t carry it even if it did.
“I don’t want to go. Please, I don’t want to go.”
But this time Tony stays with him, growing restless and propping himself up on an elbow, one arm tucking around Steve’s middle. “You want to explain to me how you got so old so quick?”
“What the fuck is that supposed to mean?”
He rides Tony until his thighs burn and Tony is cursing under him, driving up into him at a frantic pace. It’s better than it’s ever been before and Steve thinks he might never get enough of this. He can’t have this just once.
Tony Stark had breezed into his life before Steve had even known what to expect. Seeping into his pores until Steve’s nightmares had faded away, falling for Tony had been floating in a cup of thick, bitter coffee. One that burned the back of his throat and left Steve’s brain screaming for his next caffeine fix.
