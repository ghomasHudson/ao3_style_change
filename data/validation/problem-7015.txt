“I didn’t. I figured it might be a good thing to test out here before I actually made it in the real world. It was just for shits and giggles. Now it’s for real,” Tony says.
“Nope, I know that trick, I used it enough. Have some bread,” Tony directs and tries to give Steve a stern look. He’s sure it must come off more like a scowl than anything else, but Steve ignores it and smiles.
“Now let’s see if I can get a fire going,” Tony mutters. The task proves more difficult because he’s working one handed. Trying to balance the arm of the suit with his injured wrist at the same time working on it with his left hand slows his progress. He stops more than once to curse or wipe sweat away from his eyes. When he sighs and leans back, ready to give up, a large paw settles against the piece he’s working on and steadies it.
“Do you feel it?” A vibrant wire of energy links them, like an undercurrent charged and ready to come alive. “It’s always been there; we’ve always denied it. Never really tried to explore it or figure it out.”
“Yes, I think we need drink.” He pulls on his hoodie. It’s August. Even Steve’s sweating in his own hoodie. “Or two.”
before they were both pushed through it by a surprisingly strong Wong and then the whole thing shut down. They had fallen on the opposite side of the portal, in a small room that looked like a place that might have been built sometime in the middle ages.
“Could we get Spector to come out of seclusion?” Marya asks. “He was well liked by a number of betas. Even some omegas liked him.”
“Haven’t done anything yet,” Sam replied as he pulled gear out of his bedroom closet. It would amaze the average civilian how ready anyone who’d ever been to war always was. The tactical stuff Sam placed on the bed; Steve rummaged through it, picking out what they needed. Natasha hung in the door, but Steve waved her in. She tossed most of what Steve picked out and decided on the barest minimum of supplies.
“He’s not your fake boyfriend either.” She flips her hand over and clasps his hand. “He’s gone, Tony.”
She shakes her head. She scans the room, squinting her eyes into the shadowed corners, notches, and cubbies of the cave as if she’s looking for something, or someone. “I’ve stayed too long already. Tell Steve, not to come back. There’s nothing to come back. The Shield Legion is toast.”
That’s patronizing and a little comforting at the same time. Steve swallows down his snippy reply and sinks back into the shadows of the archway. “You have any ideas about what’s next?”
Steve grapples to save face and, thankfully, he finds his way. "To find out a little more about our newest citizen in town. That's part of my job."
He needs to figure out if that person in the room is actually Tony’s consciousness or Ultron. Dressing, Steve rolls his shoulders – the clothes are old fashioned, plaid and stiff with starch. This world Ultron created in his own brain hasn’t caught up with reality. Steve hasn’t worn this style of clothing since he moved to Washington D.C. and Natasha took him out for a shopping spree with what she called a ‘burn your closet down’ after party. It only means one thing – Ultron doesn’t really know him, not really. If Steve makes the next logical step along the way, then it would mean that Ultron may not be up to date on Tony either.
“Passing fancies? Did you look up that turn of phrase just so I would understand it?” Steve chuckled.
“Lord, don’t use that as your main source of anything. That’s curated by a bunch of volunteers that can essentially write whatever they damned well please. And considering entries are changed by whatever political wind is blowing, I think that there are better places to look,” Bruce said.
Blu hangs his head. His eyes awash with pain. He moves away, staggering. That’s when Tony sees it. The puncture wounds on Blu’s chest. They almost form a star like pattern. The viper bit him several times. The venom must be fast acting and in large enough doses that its strong enough to take down an adult male lion.
Clint shoves an arm in front of him to halt his progress. He stumbles and whizzes around to face his former navigator. “Nat sent me.”
“It was. You were there, you anchored me, you drew me out – to be myself,” he murmurs. It’s getting darker in the room and Tony never commanded JARVIS to turn on the lights. Tony can barely see Steve as he speaks. “It was like a thousand years a drift in a sea of stars, except I kept trying to hold onto life, yet I never could. I was able to act and move and be Bl-Blu as you call my avatar, but I always felt as if I was only an observer in a body not my own.” He laughs but it’s sound that originates from self-mocking rather than joy. “Strange, you know, I’m not really even used to this body. Been a lion most of my life.” His words fade out into a solitary sound, tuned to a silent kind of weeping.
Thor said. “Heimdall told me of your need. And, for now, I am here for you, Steven.” He clasped Steve to him in a bear hug that even made Steve look small and frail. In some ways he was fragile and Tony only cringed inwardly as Thor jostled Steve. “My brother, my friend.”
“I don’t need a teenaged kid as my omega. How the hell would that look at the Council?” Tony says. Plus the idea of knotting a kid – that is perverse. He might believe that omegas are a lower class by biology alone, but he doesn’t agree with some of the practices that alphas engage in. Without a doubt alphas have the right to knot and bond, but he doesn’t like the idea of forcing a kid.  Omega children are simple and not sophisticated, nothing like alphas or betas. They are raised to be warriors, to die for an alpha. Or they are raised to be drones, to satisfy an alpha. It is as simple as the science of their biology – and An’Tony is all about science.
“Okay, but just a tiny bit.” And he’s not joking when he says that. He pulls off a chunk that can only be the size of a golf ball and pops it in his mouth. He chews it slowly, savoring every morsel.
“Sure you did, sure you did,” Bucky says and picks up the blanket to cover him. Steve watches in silence as Bucky adjusts it. “Sleep Steve, in the morning, I’ll have a doctor and a blacksmith for you.”
Across from the large bed he rests on, there’s a chair, broad and made of rattan. The cushions are floral print, but Steve cannot make out the entire pattern because someone is watching him. Someone is sitting in the chair.
He exits the train and searches the station, finding the tunnel that leads to the blocks. With a deep breath to clear his mind, Steve heads in that direction. He can’t lie. His gland continues to ache and he’s ready for the knot. It’s embarrassing, but he really needs to get there and get this over with – he hopes that his presentation will only be two to three days, not the normal five or six he always ended up with when he was with Tony.
The tug of the bond surely announced who Tony was. Bucky was just being a shit to him. That much was clear. “Let’s not start.” Tony glanced around as a room – a small studio apartment appeared around him. From the furnishings it clearly represented a place from the late 30s.
“I think that’s obvious,” Steve said and laid his head back. It was also obvious how weak and dizzy he was. He even looked a little green around his jaw line.
The pressure of Steve’s knee against Tony’s jeans and the glide of flesh against denim clues Tony in. He reaches out and lays his hand on Steve’s knee causing him to stop talking. “You’re wearing shorts.”
When raids happened, Steve went through the motions like a robot or an automaton. He barely felt his body. His skin was numb, and his vision glossed over. He saw nearly nothing. He wished that one vampire, just one, would be strong enough, or brave enough to take down the great Captain America. Because the shield and his name meant nothing anymore. It symbolized an America that had lost its way. He lost his way.
Tony simply nods and then slips it on with no help from Steve. He’s learned over the past month or so when to help and when to stand back and wait to see if Tony wants assistance. “This will be fun,” Tony says, and he sounds anything but convinced.
Steve had looked straight at him. His eyes were sunken and bruised with the nightmare he'd suffered. His resolve though seemed to solidify like a hulking mountain between them. It was made of rock and granite and nothing Tony blasted it with could break it.
Tony shrugged away Natasha’s disapproval. Nothing to be done about it now, anyway. The truth was the truth. He opened the power drink. “At least drink this while the synthetic blood does its thing.”
Steve brandishes the spatula. “Nope. Sent it last Wednesday. Arrived just before we got here. Since I was the first one to get here, I made sure of that by the way, I tucked in the laundry room behind the dryer.”
She patted his hand with her gnarled one and said, “One does not lay down a calling. You are called. He is called. Together you will save the world, or it will burn. It is that simple.”
“I think we need to do it outside. Some space would help,” Clint said. “And I think I might have the best place.”
“Oh lord, oh fuck,” Tony says and sits on the closed toilet, and wraps his arm around those massive shoulders.
He glanced around the room. Both Thor and Bruce remained silent, obviously agreeing with her course of action. “I won’t put him in danger.”
“Name?” Tony looks at Steve with his one brow arched. He has a tendency to do that instead of furrowing his brows when confused or perplexed.
Tony troubles about it, but Steve inches their horses forward along the path. It’s steep and he needs to let his body lean with the horse. From behind him, he hears small gasps of surprise as the horse finds her footing. He knows as they proceed, that Tony will realize it was the best thing to do to let the little pony free to go back to his barn in Avenge.
Clint relaxed his struggles. Pierce nodded to the enforcer agent and then waited as Clint took the silver flask away from the man. He gave one last glare at them and stepped up to Steve again. “I don’t want to do this.”
“Really? I’m not really. I’m surprised you even made it.” He finishes tearing off leaves of lettuce.
Tony shuts down the shoulder panels and opens his hands. “I’m here for you Blu. You just have to trust me.”
“No one soul can dismiss my power in the Soul Realm. As the Soul Keeper I set the rules, I decides who moves on and who must stay and pay the dues.” The red of his skull beats a bloody crimson as he screams at Steve. “And you will pay for your sacrilege to the realm. You will pay and suffer until you pledge allegiance once again to me. I will see you as my knight again! I will see you bleed.”
“That’s not exactly a state secret,” Steve says and hooks his thumbs at his utility belt. “But this is something else.”
Steve reaches up and pets Tony’s lower belly, then plays a little with the hair. “You need me to stop you?” He tugs a little on the hair and Tony groans louder, his hips jerking a little. “That too much stimulation for you, pet?” Steve picks up Tony’s clenched fist and kisses the inside of his wrist. “It’s time for three fingers, sweet one.”
“Doesn’t seem like you want much to do with me,” Bucky said. The dark shadows under his eyes grew deeper, as if they encompassed the whole of the man.
In the coming days they would be separated by mere miles. Thousands to be sure. But Tony’s soul wrapped around Steve and like a Möbius strip Steve’s encompassed Tony’s. They were knotted together. The dark shadows of the dreamscape threatened, but together – as a pack – they had the strength and courage to fight off the unknown. Each pack member gave to the whole, strengthening the bonds and weaving together a new network of energy and light.
“So it’s the Avengers and a few from SHIELD,” Fury said. From there they had sealed his fate. He hadn’t known they picked Tony. Truly, he didn’t even realize that Tony was an alpha. It might have crossed his mind once or twice during the whole Chitauri invasion, but his body had a tendency to shift priorities during invasions and military maneuvers.
“Tony?” He nearly jumps out of his skin when he looks down to see Steve – his Steve- blinking his eyes and shifting slightly in the bed. “What happened?” He lifts up his head and then sinks back down in the pillow. “Don’t tell me.”
Steve glances at the pile of wires and the parts to the disassembled armor on the bench. “Oh, I’m sorry. I thought we were on for lunch today? Are you busy?”
Steve stretches and yawns as he wakes up. A smile crosses his face as awareness spreads through him. The prince hadn’t lied last night. He’d worked until late and then when he finished, he led Steve to his massive bed and pillaged him again. By the time Steve drifted off to sleep, his body sang, and his limbs felt numb. Now a slow ache comes over him, but it’s good and satisfaction runs through him since the prince cuddled into Steve and slept wrapped around him.
“I can take the night off, if you want,” Steve says as he touches the bureau where he put the roll of money. “I got enough for now. We can get something to eat if you want, watch a movie.”
“What did you do to me? What did you do?” he mutters and lashes at Steve, though this time it’s weak and pathetic. His eyes close as the pain takes him to unconsciousness again.
The arch of electricity crawled out like a carrion crow’s claws, scraping at both Bucky and Tony. The armor screeched in protest, but Bucky fell away, stumbling against the pain of the shock. Steve stepped in between them, warning off Bucky but at the same time trying to spot Natasha as she lurked in the wooded area around the cabin’s entrance.
“If you say so, sir,” Rumlow said and stood at ease, as if he’d been in the military. Ross assessed Steve one last time. “We’ll make sure he’s not dead.”
Steve beams. “My mom taught me. I used to do the kneading because I thought it would give me muscles.” He laughs. “Didn’t work. Always had an asthma attack or arrythmia when I did it. But I loved it.”
Memories of the vampires on the roof all those years ago paraded before his eyes as he grappled not to react to the searing pain surrounding and in his wound. He cleared his mind and thought of the many nights he spent with Tony. He loved to lie in the garden as the nightingale sang and the light breezes hit them. He recalled how they would rest on a blanket and Tony would raise a hand and outline the constellations.
“-cut into the nerve stem of the gland. That nerve stem connects to the brain.” He tries to follow the stream of information but it becomes ever more horrifying as they explain what’s happening to him. “Serum can’t seem to fix it. They’re trying. We’re trying.” And then he can hear someone crying.
“Sorry, just not used to it. Back in the day, it wasn’t polite to address someone by their first name if you didn’t know them,” Steve said, his voice stayed strong – no faltering at the mention of his lost days.
“So, that’s it? It’s over?” Steve says and he feels his body curling, slumping. His legs shake. He might fall over; he grabs a streetlamp pole. “This is it?”
“Then show me,” Tony replies. He won’t back down – not now. He can’t. He needs to break this omega before they get to the Council of Worlds.
“They didn’t destroy it – not all of it.” Steve gazed up at Tony. “I’m not giving up, Tony. I never said I was.”
“Yes, her. She’ll still be lurking around because I will appear and then disappear during the event. So, Pepper’s planned it out that there will be a plenary about the Foundation’s work before the gala. She wants me to be there, Chair it.”
In record fashion the wrist bindings, nipple clamps, and the ankle cuffs open. Steven stumbles up the small step from the pole, twisting his shoulders. “Is there another apparatus you would like instead?”
Steve keeps his eyes unfocused, tapping his implant to have it play the news directly into his auditory nerve.
“Hmm,” Steve says with a nod. “Yeah, I am. Just hungry.” He furrows his brows as he notices the book Tony has in his lap. “Braille? You know braille?”
“Not so much if the implant is there. It has a specific resonance frequency that the virus could home to if you do it right.” Tony rubs at his beard. “But really what good is this for me? I had a brain bleed because of the accident that killed the Optic chiasm.”
The shudders left him and he stood there still shaking inside. What had he done? Christ, he was fucked up. Rising and cleaning, he finished up and left the shower. He wrapped a thick towel around his waist and then went to the rack to don an expensive robe. Dropping the towel, he put on the robe. When he walked out of the bathroom, Pepper had a suitcase on the bed.
“It’s okay.” Steve thinks he should say – it’s my job – but that feels uncaring and heartless and untrue. Instead he says, “He needs it.”
Obie chuckles. "Rhodes is coming in this weekend. He'll drive some sense into you. What is it, Tony? A hot crotch got you all wrapped up in ribbons?"
“You do,” Tony said. He could have thrown a flippant remark but he didn’t. He kept his hand touching Steve, and then leaned down to meet his gaze as he opened his eyes. “You’re not alone.”
“If I was more prepared, I would have known what to do when your pal Stane came up to me, I can handle it, if I’m prepared. I’m not a member of your crew, I’m an outsider, a hooker. You should have let me be that. Then I would have been prepared.”
Tony pushed forward and brought them together in a kiss that both surprised and satisfied. Steve opened up not only his mouth but his soul’s core to Tony. Tony with his innate skills accepted the offering and their soul threads wove, slowly, intricately together. Each strand merged into a new thread of life linking them together. The kiss deepened and coiled a fire within Steve, but the physicality of it dimmed in comparison to how deftly Tony brought their souls’ energies together. Tony paused, panting for a moment.
“Why do I think this is a conspiracy against me. Are you and Nat sure you’re not super evil villains?”
Sitting up, he shifts away from the man. “It’s okay. I’m okay.” He searches around – he’s in a cave lying on a cot. The blankets are torn and filthy, the cave looks like a cross between a mechanic’s garage and a prison. “Where?”
“Tony, this isn’t going to convince me that you should be traipsing around with me across the country looking for a wayward brother and my lost deputy. It’ll be a difficult ride.”
“Clint, we worked together for years. For years!” Steve said and tried to prop himself up when the strain on his arms tugged and pulled.
Steve blinks and looks away. There’s such lost in his features that Tony feels as if Steve’s in mourning, in mourning for a death of something, or someone.
As the Silver Knight, he had no fear of his duty. He’s made a vow to protect the souls of the Realm with his life.
“So that means?” Steve spins on his heels, trying to ignore the momentary vertigo. He spots the exit Door in the distance – but there’s something terribly wrong with it. “Tony? Tony!” He points to the Door. It’s disintegrating, pixelating into fragments.
“That’s what I told him,” Cho says as she rounds Steve’s bed to tap on one of the screens. She obviously thinks Tony’s one of those guys who is going to mansplain everything to her. He hates that – but it’s probably true. In his defense, he always assumes the people in the room cannot follow him and he must explain everything to everyone. He needs to stop that with the company he currently keeps.
“After the first day or so, no. They have me working with a team. I’m part of their tactical response along with the Strike team.” He swigs some of the beer.
He nods to Pepper and Happy, and gives Rhodes a quick salute that is more honorary than required since Rhodes left the Patrol in the first year of the interim government. He offers a salute back and shifts his stance to indicate the man of the hour is disembarking. There’s a warning in Rhodes expression; as if he’s disapproving of something, or someone. For a moment, Steve thinks it is him. Rhodes always challenged him to be better to Tony.
Steve nods. He grew up in the poor section of New York City. He’s lucky his mother forced him to learn how to read and do basic math. He won’t be ashamed of his upbringing though. “I’m not ashamed of where I come from.”
The nurse whips around to look at him. “I’m getting the hourly sample Doctor Banner requested.” She has a small plastic carrier with phlebotomy supplies in it.
Steve held his tongue and his worry as Clint swooped the helicopter through the churning, threatening cloud cover. The fighter jet was lost in the distance and the thunder roared around them. “Who’s we?” Steve needed to talk otherwise he might panic.
The power of it ripped him apart. His sinews and muscles stretched and quaked through the stress. His brain begged for mercy as the new energy within him regenerated him, rebirthed him. He became something new, something horrible and bright. Something beautiful and something deadly. The surge of power lifted him. Tony opened his eyes and the people in the cell around him backed away. He stood – no, he floated a few feet above them. A hot and terrible fire blazed in his chest as he focused on his tormentors. With little knowledge of what happened to his body, Tony raised his hands when the V-Corps agents pointed their guns at him. While the bullets couldn’t kill him, they could do significant harm.
“No. I have two left feet. Peggy, my fiancé, wanted to teach me before the wedding.” He stops and the loss hits him dead center in the chest. A fist hard and cold like steel grips him and his lungs constrict. He blinks a few times, trying to chase away the tears prickling at the corners of his eyes. Clearing his throat, he says, “Sorry.”
“Well, that’s pleasant.” Now is not the time for self-pity. He needs to stay alert and help. He’s supposed to be the protector of the two of them. Get Tony to the Hub, protect and shield him. “Any ideas? Did you get a clear picture of the Hub. I mean I know this is a virtual place that Ultron can change at any time, but there must be-.”
The helicopter thumped and bumped as it hit air pockets. Steve gripped the console. “You can control this thing, right?”
The memories slot into place like building blocks, like fucking Legos. He tries to stem the flow of the ideas, the images, the memories but they fix in place and he grabs his head. Yinsen had – what happened to Yinsen? He tears at his hair and suddenly he recalls Yinsen sacrificing himself at the end of his captivity so that Tony can get away from Ten Rings.
Steve inhales and exhales. What stupid crap did he get up to last night and why didn’t Thor warn him? Bucky always told him he couldn’t hold his liquor. Lord, what kind did Thor ladle down his throat last night? Some kind of magical heavy duty mead?
Steve sets the coffee in front of Tony. “Here you go. You didn’t say what you like so I made Caramel Macchiato – hope you like it.”
“I can’t,” Steve says and touches Tony’s forehead. He’s burning hot, fever. Steve rips open his shirt and sees that the battery wires have oozing puss around them. “Look, he’s sick. It’s infected. I need help.”
“No, Cap, I don’t think so,” Fury says and goes to the desk. He calls up his own images removing Steve’s and grimaces as he does. “You’re not going to like this but you have to do it. So, just, get over it quick.”
“I am – well, technically not right now. I sent them away for a few hours. Seriously some of it is wanting face time with the prince.” Tony smiles, but his eyes are tired. “I needed some downtime.”
They climb into the shuttle with the guards in tow. Steve follows orders and sits at the co-pilot seat but keeps his focus straight head. Natasha’s right. He can’t do this. Not like this, not when he has to be with someone night and day. Maybe if it had been someone less charismatic, less sympathetic. Maybe someone like Hammer or even Stane – where Steve can just be a body and leave his brain behind in some foggy place. Steve’s been stupid, idiotic, thinking that he should care for the whole person, the whole client. It isn’t about that – it’s about a quick fuck and that’s it.
“You must be thinking of someone else. Captain Rogers, AKA Captain America, is an alpha. Everyone knows that. He doesn’t have uteri sacs for pups. He never did. He’s an alpha. He’s my alpha I should know!” Grumpy isn’t the word for Tony’s annoyance right now. He needs a doctor who knows Steve’s physiology not some quack who obviously doesn’t know shit. Where the fuck is Bruce when you need him – off smashing up AIM operatives in lower Manhattan he supposes.
Several armed men march into the room with their leader- a bald man with a cynical eye and a sharp intelligence- at the center. He spits out a command and two of the soldiers break off from the rest. One kicks Tony to his knees, the other does the same to him. Steve follows Tony’s actions and puts his hands folded behind his head.
As the rays dried his lips and the taste of blood filled his mouth, Tony squinted as the world started to blur around him. His eyes. God, his eyes! Every blink scraped the cornea raw. The glistening sun against the tarmac of the roof top baked his retinas and he swore he could feel the fine cones and rods of the back of his eyes flake off as the vitreous humor dried. He moaned as he pulled and tugged against the nails impaling him to the wooden beams. He refused to die like this. He refused to become like that thing hanging on the cross not two meters from him – still alive. It shifted at any sound he made.
“That was some time ago,” Tony said and kept his sights on the water. Ripples upset the surface of the pristine lake; it wasn’t anything but the wind touching it’s surface.
Tears blur Tony’s vision. “I can’t do this. I can’t lose you. You’re my everything.” Over the course of a few short weeks, Blu taught him devotion, loyalty, and unwavering resolve. The time in the cave only scratched the surface in comparison with what they shared. How connected and essential Blu had become to Tony.
“And you are.” His mother smiled. “You always will be. Nothing about you was ever a failure, Steven. Nothing. You always stood up. You always fought.”
Rumlow smirked and cocked an eyebrow. “You so sure you want to do it this way. Looks like he hurt you pretty damn much.”
“From what I saw, he did the right thing.” Tony saw the data dump. Although he hadn’t the time to analyze it, the clear headlines of Hydra infiltrating the main defense apparatus of the US government happened to make headlines. It was fucking trending on twitter already. There hadn’t been a need to spend anytime digging for that.
“Even out here.” The Hunter waves to the hills beyond which poppy fields grow. “In the middle of nowhere, you are well known for your actions in – what do you call it – California?”
“This isn’t a get out of the icy waters of purgatory free, Steve, this is you have to earn it and get it right this time. If you don’t the fate of the entire world, the entire human population hangs in the balance.” Fury curls his one wing in toward his body. Everyone knows the story of Nicolas Fury, the Archangel who lost his wing, sacrificed his wing to save the little girl who would become one of the greatest of their lot.
Steve slashes the air with his hand. “You have got to stop, Bucky. Stark didn’t do anything. He ended up with amnesia after saving the damned Human Space. I wanted something from him, but he wasn’t that person. If it hurt me, it was my own damned fault.”
“One day I’ll warm your cock with my mouth, the whole day through,” he whispers and slips a tongue along the thick base. Tony shudders against him, his cock weeping as he moans out his want.
“God!  He didn’t. You let him. You’re a god damned fairy,” Bucky growled out and then put the cigarette to his lips. He lit it and puffed the smoke at Steve. “You just want to die. Don’t you? They’re gonna find out, you know. The cops are gonna find out. And you know what happens to little fairy boys in prison, don’t you Stevie? They’ll fucking pass you around. You’re be a rag, a slut.” He threw up his hands. “God, maybe that’s what you want. That’s what you perverts dream about.”
In only a few minutes the door sweeps open and Happy enters. “Mer Rogers, you wanted to go and see Prince Anthony.”
“And strangely enough even after a full background check, you’ve managed to surprise me.” He touches the line of Steve’s cheek. “This – this is thoughtful but changing my schedule? That’s taking care of me with a very strategic mind. You actually ended up concentrating what I needed to do with the right people. How did you do that?”
Steve frowns. Tony’s too keyed up to sleep. It’s going to be a long night – he peers at the light sneaking in through the blinds – or day. Steve’s gotten to the point where he’s overly tired and probably won’t be able to sleep himself, especially with the hell of guilt eating away at his brain. His brain circles his absolute disgust with himself that he would masturbate to images of his boss. He wants to pound his head against the wall to knock some sense into it.
Tony kisses him completely and when he releases him, he says, “I’m not. I’m telling the truth.” They are close enough to breath on one another but far enough away that Steve can see the earnestness in the prince’s eyes. “You’re sincere, I can see it and know it in everything you do and say.” Tony tangles his legs with Steve’s and presses down on him, kissing and exploring. When he comes up for air he says, “We missed our date in the station’s observatory. Would you come with me to tomorrow night?”
It took a moment for Steven to follow direction but he did, first thinking that he was to get into a presentation position, tearing off his trousers. “No, knees but face me.” On his knees, Steven did as told. His lips were bright red and his mouth a divine sin. “Open.” Again, he did as told and Tony swooned at the power. To have someone be his and follow direction so obediently. He shivered as he took his own cock in hand, working at the swell of his knot. There was enough pre-come dripping from the head of his cock to wet him. He half-lidded his eyes and stroked himself brutally hard. “I want to know if I can whip you, if I can put you on the cross and hang you there. I want to know if you would like me to fist you while I hang you on the cross. I want to know if you would like to be trussed up for days, spider gag in mouth and dildo working your ass. I would come in and fuck your mouth anytime I want and leave you hungry for more. I want to know if you would be clamped in a chastity belt or sounded until you cried. I want to know how far you’ll go for me.”
Barnes glares at him. “Can you at least think a little about him? He’s in surgery right now. He needs you to think about him, be strong for him.” He shoves the chair Tony was sitting in away with his left arm, the gears whirl. “You think it’s easy to be different, to know people look at you differently? See you as a freak? As a disease? A sore on the human condition? Think about it, Tony? He loves you. He never, ever wanted to see that on your face.”
“Are you all right, Tony? Natasha really got to you,” Pepper said as she wrapped her arms around him. He laid his head against her and tried to feel the warmth of her embrace.  It meant the world to him; she meant everything to him. The tears prickled at his eyes and he shut them to shun the feelings – the empty, ragged need.
Tony smothers the urge to belt the omega, because what he says it true. Tony might not like it, but it’s the truth. Yet the want to punish the man rises in Tony. He blames it on his nature, but he wonders how much of it is plain and simple nurture? “Should I punish you?”
“He’s climbing the rope, and he’s gaining on us.” Tony grips him tightly. “Faster. You’re Captain America, you know.”
With a heave of his body against Tony, he gets the shield to move and then they drop, careering downward, over the bumps of snow, launching briefly and crashing back to the snow. Puffs of snow trail them and Tony grasps Steve close, the world a blur around them. At the last second, Steve leans toward the starboard side and they pitch around and the shield spins a little. Tony gasps and then shield flies down the rest of the slope only coming to a stop when Steve digs his heels into the snow causing drag.
Tony stretched back to Steve and grasped his hand. “No. Don’t worry. It’s just uncomfortable for me to think about.”
When Natasha arrived, the course of his life shifted as if a hurricane battered him and the roof had been torn off the shelter he’d been hiding in for months. Of course, he didn’t let her know how she affected him, how any of it affected him. She walked into the penthouse apartment like she owned the place. Her hair had been straightened and she wore civilian clothes. Black t-shirt with a gray blazer over it, and gray toned jeans with high glossy leather boots. Even dressed like an urbanite, there was no denying who or what she was.
“I don’t care what it’s made from – they’re going to shoot you down one day and find out it’s you. The company, what about Stane. You have evidence that he tried to sell weapons to terrorists.”
Steve fists his hands and clenches his jaw. He shakes his head, and then reaching out to Fury, hoping to appeal to his friend. He keeps his eyes averted. “You can’t ask me to do this.”
Steve blinks a few times and then inhales. That’s a mistake. The smell of bleach burns his nostrils and his bronchi constrict. He tries to exhale but his throat locks up, spasming. Immediately, he recognizes the claws ripping at his bronchi and lungs as chemical induced asthma attack. His gloved fingers come up to the helmet and fumble with the latches. He wheezes.
“Like you said it sucks,” Tony says and wants to wrap his arms around his chest. He can’t. He’s beholden to Steve for his safety.
He looks up at himself in the wide mirror plastered to the wall. He feels like he’s about to walk into another recruiting station and lie about his health as well as his residency. It’s been a long road from there to where he is now. He would never have dreamed any of it. He thought he would end up with Peggy or some other alpha. He wishes sometimes that it had been Peggy. He would have fathered her children, she would have loved him and they would have founded SHIELD together. Then he thinks of the parasite that grew within SHIELD and how it infected everyone and everything that he loved. The dream of that is gone now, along with all the ashes of his life.
“Glasses?” Tony asks and Pepper moves away. She shuffles across the floor in bare feet. “Where are your shoes?”
Shivers run through his body as he stares at the face with scars along the right side that seem almost faded, almost gone. The eyes are kind but glimmering red.  That’s wrong, the Silver Knight thinks. That’s not the right color. He knows this as clearly as he knows his purpose in life.
“I will haunt you with very chaotic and slightly perverted thoughts until you come back to your senses,” Tony said. “Listen, we’re supposed to be the Avengers, and we are the good guys. I want to be a good guy, don’t you?”
During the flight, Pepper calls him. “Can you tell me why you took a company jet for your private use?”
Tony gritted his teeth and nodded. Even his AI understood the gravity of the situation. When the lift opened on the medical floor, Tony whispered, “Thanks.” He left without further word and went directly to Steve’s room. Wong and Strange were already huddled with Bruce, Natasha, and Sam. When Tony arrived, they all quieted and stared at him.
Back breaking shoveling all the way to town sounds like loads of fun. “I’d rather break my neck sledding.”
“You don’t have to worry, Pepper. This is the first time in a long time, I think I know what I’m doing.” He plays with the pen on her desk.
“Oh, okay,” Steve says and, for one strange minute, he’s disappointed. Maybe he just wants to forget and let someone treat him shitty for a few days. He closes his eyes. Self-destructive behavior isn’t going to help him at all. “Okay, sorry.”
“Well, we need to do something. He’s not in good shape. That constant stress can’t be good for him?” Sam directs the last at Cho who only nods.
Steve should say no, but Stark holds the doctor and his blacksmith shop as a dangling carrot for the taking. Both the doctor and the blacksmith are needed if the town is going to stand a chance against Schmidt and his Red Skull gang.  He concedes, he has no other choice.
“I think you've been reading too many of those dime store novels. Bucky likes to read those penny novels, the ones you put your ad in. What the west is – is a tragedy to some, opportunity to others, and an escape for a lot of other folks.”
Bucky digs out the folded penny story novel from his breast pocket and flips through the pages, one handed and efficiently. “Here, see?”
“How? How do you wipe away decades of conditioning? I think differently. I walk into a room, I immediately know the lay of the land. Just in this simple room there are 37 different ways I can kill you. Do you understand, Steve? This isn’t just something you play with.” Bucky stood up and the brawn of his muscles and shoulders, the way the metal gears of his arm whined shadowed over everything Steve knew about him.
“I don’t know, Anthony. People have lots of motives for what they do. I don’t think that Captain Rogers would have done it maliciously. Perhaps he felt guilt, or he felt that he couldn’t fill the role adequately.”
Heading back to the Avengers ship, Steve tries to shake the feeling – but it shudders through him reminding him of those long days on Brooklyn when the dust storms would roll through, and he’d struggle to breathe. His mother’s eyes told the story then – her worry, her concern, and her hidden battle to pretend his difficulties never threw doubt into her mind about his survival. He recognized that fear in her, breaking her apart from the inside out. Even as he turns the corner toward the docks, Steve cannot figure out why this memory came unbidden to him, why it reminds him of his circumstance today. Does it mean that he’s frightened for himself or for Tony.
“Listening to a madman and not announcing yourself is the height of rudeness.” Tony swings his arm around as if to push the shade of his hallucinations away. Maybe he’s still on the side of the road and he’s conjured the lion and this misfit of a man to comfort him. Still why this guy? Why not one of his teenage crushes like Captain America.
Steve catches a glimpse of the prince’s profile and nearly gasps at his beauty. He’s only seen a few images of the prince most of them older. But here the prince is more mature and handsome. His wild dark hair and olive tinted skin with those long eyelashes sends a thrill down Steve’s spine. He’s taller than Steve, with a frame of wiry muscles and strong hands. He’s only wearing a stained tunic and pants; his feet are bare. From the grease on his arms and tunic, he’s obviously been working on some of the equipment thrown about.
Yet, he cannot leave the town at will – not with Schmidt out there, quiet but threatening every day. He sent word to Falcon and hoped to hell that Sam shows up. He also telegraphed Fury to see if there would be any possible help from the Governor. Pierce isn’t known for his charity, but he did seem suitably impressed with Steve the one time they met before Steve took the position as Sheriff. Steve’s impression of Pierce is anything but good. He was taught to respect authority both by his mother, the nuns, and the military but Pierce refuses to stop Schmidt’s gang; and some have said that the Red Skulls are just part of Pierce’s underground activity, that he wants more power, that his ultimate goal would be to end up as the Governor of the state once the territories are granted statehood or even Senator or President.
His voice seemed to echo in the small space – but it grew in strength as he spoke the words in a whisper.
Steve forced his jaw down and mauled the hand, feeling tendons give way and flesh rip. Face to face with Rumlow, just inches away from the man, Steve snarled out and jerked his head, hard and fast, releasing Rumlow from his attack. The agent stumbled backward, his eyes wild with pain. His hand mutilated, missing part of one finger and the whole little finger. Steve snarled at him, blood dripping from his mouth. Rumlow curled over his damaged hand, screeching at him. Steve grinned, letting him see his bloody teeth and then he spat out the fingers. “Wanna try again, you filthy bastard?” Drool and blood cascaded down his chin and neck. He must look worse than a vampire in a feeding frenzy.
Bruce shook his head. “No, not really. He’s still unconscious. The doctors can’t figure it out. His body is mending at the correct rate with the serum. He should be awake by now. It’s been a day-.”
Instead he knocks on the door and a young blonde woman answers. She smiles and says, "She's expecting you."
“Is it even possible?” Steve asked out of the blue as Natasha kept talking about her days in the Red Room.
The answer hurts more than it should. Why? Tony doesn’t know. Was he hoping that Steven possessed some kind of supernatural powers and could hear Tony weeping in the shower?
Morgan kisses his cheek and makes him promise that tomorrow they’ll spend time in his garage workshop on her go-kart (Steve does not approve).
Steve almost says yes, but he’s already shaking his head negatively as he realizes there’s no way he’s leaving again. He’s staying right where he is. In the corridor outside of the prince’s rooms. He slides down to the floor and sighs. He’s really fucked it all up.
After that evening and the ensuing meeting that Steve nearly flubbed his role, things started to settle down. Tony had flown in some tutors for Steve. He took a crash course in the basics of biochemistry, physiology, and statistics. The tutor was a little over the top eccentric. She is bald, wears robes, and likes to have Steve call her Ancient. It’s weird. He’s not sure he gets a lot out of the lessons and he feels like a complete idiot and stupid to boot. So the first week goes about as he expected for someone not qualified for the job.
“Okay, come on, don’t fall now,” Tony says and easiest him down the steps of the patio to the white sands. The sand is warm, but not hot so it can’t be mid-day yet. Steve glances up at the sky and sees the sun still hanging low in the eastern sky.
“It’s hard not to be when so much weight as been lifted off my shoulders. Gravity can’t keep me down,” Tony replies as they step through the threshold for the small main office. It smells like mildew and old papers. Steve steps up to the desk and rings the little bell.
“Open your mouth,” Rumlow ordered and charged the shocker. Steve offered no response; he kept his eyes dull and focused on the middle distance.  “Open your god damned mouth or I will brain you with this.” The shocker sparked and sizzled.
“Are you going to be grouchy all the way there, Sheriff. We could take a break, I could get on my knees and do something about your mood,” Tony says and smiles.
“No, it’s not just words. If I, if I’m with you like that, I’ll bond to you, you’ll bond to me. Most humans know nothing of bonds because their strictly forbidden.”
“We do when war destabilizes the whole of the galaxy. Humans and Kree are young, they don’t have the wisdom of age. They know not how to seek peace.” Odin sighs.
“You are a weird little man,” Tony says and slowly makes his way to stand by Yinsen’s side. It isn’t easy. Metal parts litter the floor of their little hovel. It reminds Tony of his father’s workshop.  “Whatcha making there, Emeril?”
He grabs a few towels and thinks maybe some ice will help. Jumping the toilet to get out of the door, he goes back to the main room to find Steve lying on the bed with a hand over his ribs and the other exploring the swelling on his face. Tony bends down to the small dormitory sized refrigerator and find no ice cubes in the confined space. “No ice cubes.”
Steve sits on the bed, staring as Pepper rummages through the closet of clothes he hung when he first arrived. She mutters to herself, obviously not happy with any of the choices. This morning started off well enough but derailed sometime around mid-day when the duchess decided it was her responsibility to ensure Steve was properly dressed and trained for the upcoming luncheon. As he watches her compare the different articles of clothing and consult JARVIS, Steve thinks about waking up in Tony’s arms.
Steve feels hands on him, hands in him and he shocks awake. No one is touching him, the cradle works and the pain pulsates at his gland. He tries to move, but cannot. They still have him tied down. His eyes feel sticky and his mouth glued shut. He hums a note and someone peers in at him. It is Doctor Cho.
That’s when one of the lens of the glasses goes from transparent to opaque and then a scene plays before him. Steven sits in the dirt with his back to the monitoring system. His clothes are folded on a bench near the pole. Blood drips down his back. Jamison and Harry are standing to the side. There are no other guards in the area. Stumbling but clutching the pole he’s just been chained to, Steven manages to get to his feet. He takes a moment, and Tony sees that he’s saying something.
“Not falling is always the tricky part, but I can try.” Tony adjusts his hold and it nearly throws Steve off balance. He compensates quickly.
“Cover up,” Steve orders, because he doesn’t need Miss Potts reprimanding him if Tony catches his death from the cold weather. Tony doesn’t protest. Steve goes to the pack horse and checks his reins, they’re tied off well on Steve’s horse, but he still worried that they will end up losing the animal if the water’s too rough. He’ll make an assessment once they get down to the river from the plateau.
He hangs up his hat and duster then heads back to the parlor but Jarvis intercepts him to bring him into the dining room. He feels immediately out of place in his soft flannel and dungarees. He’d visited the Richards on several occasions but he’d stayed on the porch or in the vestibule, with a peek at the parlor. He’d never ventured this far into the place.
Steve smiles but turns his face away from Tony to hide it. The fall back to teasing Steve warms him more than the heated plates. He keeps his mind steady, firmly placed in the idea of where they need to go, away from the possibilities and the potentials from the past. Thinking about what could have been and what has been lost helps no one. He learned that when he found himself awake in 2012 and his whole world disintegrated around him.
Tony heard Steve’s shrug in his hoodie. “Well, Jarvis didn’t like me very much when I started. He always gave me the stare of death.”
“Yeah, I do. Plus, I think you’re blood sugar is dropping and you need to eat more.” Tony reaches to the table and brings Steve’s plate over to him. “Eat.”
The words whisper in his ears, but he only hears the din of his heart throbbing deeply and rapidly in his chest. He stumbles a little as he walks forward into the open space within the maze. Bucky sits on a rock with a knife in his hand. He’s whittling something. His back is toward Steve. A step forward and Steve could reach out his hand and touch him.
“Of my hair,” Tony finishes. Before Steve’s half out of the booth, Tony catches his wrist. “What the hell was this? Why did you come to me? Why did you leave Logan?” Steve keeps his mouth clamped shut but a twitch of his jaw muscle tells Tony he’s fighting to swallow down the truth. “Bruce said you called him – when you were still with Logan.” Tony rushes because he can feel the tension in Steve’s body ratchet up. He only has seconds before Steve bolts. “Bruce said you asked questions about other realities, that he told you to talk to Richards. Is that true? What’s going on?”
It’s a challenge and Steve always rises to a challenge. “I like men.” His voice grows strong. “I like to bottom, but I can switch. I like to be held down, but not hurt. I like good choking blow job and I swallow. I also like toys but not that into sounding. Cock warming is something I’d love to do and have done in the past. I like to be used but not by a gang. Not into that. And definitely not into scat.”
“Maybe. I went to see Doctor Erskine. It was close to when we were going to preform Project Rebirth. I’d just been selected and met the team – your father was one of them. It wasn’t the first time I saw him, but it was the first time I met Howard. He intimidated the shit out of me.” Steve bites into the loaf of bread. “I went to see the doctor to talk to him about Rebirth and to figure some things out.”
“Thanks! That would be great.” He stops their progress. From the echo of the wow Steve utters, Tony surmises they’ve arrived at the garage.
“No cutting, don’t cut it off.” He’s delirious with the pain, but it doesn’t make it any easier to deal with.  With no other choice,  Steve crawls up onto the cot, and pulls Bucky down onto his chest, with his legs wrapped around him.
“I know you do,” Tony replied. The very last thing he wanted right now was to lose everything they’d started to build. He never thought they would get this far. The moment that Steve told him about Bucky and his parents remained in sharp relief in Tony’s memories. Sometimes it was hard to get around when he thought of the pack, its members, and his future.
“Yeah, it does.” Tony paused and made a few ‘hm’ noises. “You know, I think you got something there. We’re not getting our energy from the stars – they’re too far away. Son of a bitch.” Tony sat up. “You’re right. The sun is too close and that’s why it’s too much for our bodies to handle all of that energy. It’s not the same for vampires, but shit for the Divini – we just might need -.”
That puts a brilliant smile on Sam’s face. He leans down after he yanks on his shirt. He kisses Steve and says, “See you soon.” Reaching into his pocket he hands Steve a pouch of credits.
“Oh, so you did the homework this time,” Tony said and closed his arms around himself. Scratching absently at his beard, he asked, “So what’s the occasion?”
“I know you want it to make sense, but I know that there were forces beyond comprehension at play. The tesseract must be tied to some other forces, forces that change reality, that shift time and space. I don’t know. I can’t tell-.”
“We’re going to get you out of this, Steve,” Tony says even though he hasn’t figure out exactly what this is yet.
That’s all it takes, and Tony wraps his callused hand around Steve’s cock and pulls, stroking it in time with his punishing thrusts. Steve’s not sure what noises come out of him, but he’s crazy for it, crazy to finish. He arches into Tony’s strokes and his breathing hitches, his toes curl.
“Problem? I’m afraid my being blind isn’t something I’m willing to call a problem anymore,” Tony says. Steve feels Tony’s muscles tense against his hand, knowing he’s about to shove Everhart aside.
Steve clamped his other hand over Tony’s to keep it still, to trap it next to his and then he looked up and their faces were only inches apart. Tony’s breath spilled over him, smelling of coffee. Their weight together, the soul bond a pulse in the background easing them to the center point. It would take only a slight movement to touch Tony’s lips with his own. Yet to touch, to kiss, meant for Steve that he would not move over a distance of an inch, but miles and miles over a chasm filled with a churning beliefs of wrongness. He closed his eyes, and backed away. The shame heated his face. And he found that he wasn’t ashamed at the idea of it, but that he couldn’t go through with it, that his inaction hurt Tony.
Tony squeezes his hand. “Do it quickly. I can’t hold off Ross much longer. He’s going to want to know what I’m doing in Korea.”
Tony and Natasha grabbed him, keeping him away from the table. “Don’t, Steve. God! Don’t.” Tony’s voice broke, crackling into near sobs as Steve struggled. “It won’t do any good for you.”
Steve lifts his shoulder. “I don’t really know. I’m partial to Daredevil right now, I suppose because I did some of the variant covers that are offered in the current run.” Steve indicates the resume again, and then clasps his hands in his lap. It’s becoming obvious to Steve that he’s not really interested in study his resume, so Tony needs to address that little fact.
“We have to use what we have at hand. His information might be vital to whether you or I survive. Any of your coven. Don’t forget what your coven has given to you over the years, Tony. This is your first priority, not your mate.” Natasha depended on Thor, and when she did, she had a tendency to remain physically close to him. He stood right next to her now – in that shadowy spot where she tended to fold space at a moment’s notice and disappear. He wondered if she kept him there as a kind of scout – looking at other places to find out what’s happening where. “Thor, I might need you to talk with the others.”
Steve recognizes that Tony’s testing Ultron, seeing how much he knows and how much he’s guessing at – since Hawkeye’s officially retired it and Ultron seems to have missed that cue it’s hopeful that he doesn’t know everything.
Steve almost remarks that he feels like a creep but swallows his words. “I’m going to go and get my sketch pad from my room. I like to draw a little before I sleep.”
I promised a summary of the first two stories in this chapter. You will find it within the first two pages of the chapter.
Tony stares at the crimson pools as it dissolves, the air in his throat tense. He shivers in response. Blu saved him, again. The outdoors aren’t really for Tony. He finds his hands clawing the mud as he lies there frozen with fear. His heart rams in his chest. Tony swallows down the bitterness of terror and shifts his attention to Blu.
“And who might you be, Mister Magician?” Tony cut in. He looked like he didn’t have time for this crap and Steve could sympathized. But where Tony was clearly frustrated, Steve only felt another wave of overwhelming loneliness for his own time.
“Starlight.” Tony shrugged. “I have a bed that’s on a balcony. I just rest a few hours every night, right after the sun’s gone down.”
Off to the kitchen. Tony races up the stairs and slides into the kitchen only to find Steve with his face nearly pressed up against the microwave watching the popcorn bag expand. “Whoa there nelly, get your face away from that. You’ll go blind.”
The table near the door has two wooden chairs at it and Steve leads Tony to it to finish their interrupted dinner. Steve sets the table as Tony pops the drinks out of the holder and gives one to Steve and one to himself. Setting of the table entails simply putting down a napkin and then their dinner on each of the unfolded paper napkins.
“I can’t,” Tony groans and rakes his hands through Steve’s hair again, tugging at the strands. “I can’t hold on.”
A whispered wind answered him as if the penthouse was open to the night. Standing, he shivered and wanted JARVIS to close the expansive glass doors, but instead he turned, and a long hallway appeared. Everything else went to darkness like he stood on a stage and a spotlight beckoned him.
“House arrest?” Steve says and then he thinks about how Scott talked – how he relished speaking about his little girl. How bright his eyes would get and Clint would lean in and listen, adding his own thoughts and memories. “Let me think about it?”
“Jesus, Tony, no, no, that’s not what I want at all,” Steve says and manages to climb off the bed. He’s not sure how this all went sideways, but he knows he’s approaching it all wrong. He needs to rectify the situation now. He realizes how stupid he’s been when he wobbles on his feet. He stretches his wings to give him some balance but that only serves to throw him out of any sort of equilibrium and he topples to the floor. Tony rushes to him, but stops short.
Steve jerks and turns to find Stark – Tony- standing at the doorway to the building. His arms are folded and he analyzes Steve with a critical eye. Steve does nothing to hide the old scars lining his back.
His hand caresses the thickness of Steve’s cock and the man trembles beneath him. It feels real, truthful, and throws Tony further deeper and deeper into some kind of love for this stranger, this sex worker, this mystery beneath him. He sweeps a finger over the head of Steve’s cock and he jerks in response. When Tony looks up at him, his eyes are focused on the ceiling, his hands are clenched in the thin sheets of the bed. This isn’t the sex worker beneath him, this is the man in the drawings – the scrawny man that turned into the god. Tony leans down and lightly brushes his lips against Steve’s navel, then drags his tongue downward until Steve’s hot and heavy in his mouth again.
It’s time to disembark for which Steve is quietly thankful. Confronting Tony isn’t something he’s in the mood for, nor does he have the energy – not yet. When he stands, Tony’s by his side with his hand on his bicep. “I think you should take a wheelchair from the plane. It might be a better move than walking out on your own.”
As he fell away from the crashing Helicarrier he saw Bucky one last time, wide eyed, terrified, and he heard the soul pack judder in their horror. He released them, unburdening the bonds as simply as he would untie his shoes. He closed his eyes before the water hit. He sank and nothing but darkness and his bones feeling weightless and empty greeted him.  He succumbed to the greater expanse of time and space – to death itself and welcomed it. No bonds on Earth or hopes in heaven, just the shadow world of everlasting sleep.
“Everywhere,” Tony says and manages to put ice on the swelling on Steve’s cheekbone because Clint gave him a cold gel pack. He keeps his words low and his tone soothing as he asks, “Anyone helping you?”
“That’s what you hope, but your stock is bound to take a hit. You know that, it’s one of the reasons you’ve been hiding this, for what? Ten years. Just the fact that you were able to so successfully manage to hide something like being blind is an accomplishment in and of itself, but the fact that you are the major force behind your company’s advancements, that knocks it out of the park.” She barely acknowledges Steve; all her energy is focused on Tony. “So, let me help you with your little problem.”
He puts one foot in front of the other, though the act of walking seems like a formidable task. How will he even be able to defend them when he cannot take his mind off the fact that Steve’s dying – this is his corpse that Bucky is saving. He cannot even look into those beautiful, caring blue eyes again. The cage obstructs even a glimpse of them. Bucky knows, knows deep in his heart that just the ability to see might clear away the quaking from Steve, might calm him.
A fine linen cloth is placed in his hands and he wipes his mouth, and then looks up. He’s given a tin cup of water. He drinks as he sees Tony standing over him. “Tony?” His voice is rasped and it burns to talk.
“Vision said that Wanda’s almost done with the lunch. She wanted to know if you want your lunch out here or would you prefer the dining room?”  Steve asks. He’s a little more timid in his question than normal.
Steve gently removes Tony’s arm from his face. “Hey, hey. That’s not you. You already told him that’s not you. You have the choice here, Tony.”
“Well, I never said that I didn’t like the idea. I’m just not sure about heading out without some plan.  I’ve been working a little on that actually,” Tony said. While he hadn’t devoted a huge amount of time to their wayward pack members, he had to balance his equations with their nexus points as well. “I mean, when I check on the bonds through the equations-.”
“So much faith in your friend even after he betrayed you and your vampire scum?” Ross said and tilted his head. “Interesting.” He stared at his bloodstained finger. “I heard your blood is gold. Did he love to suck you dry through your cock?”
Steve lifts his chin. “Don’t do that. Don’t think this is something momentary. I wouldn’t have told you if I thought you or I would walk away.”
She smirked but Steve interrupted, “Natasha’s right. We need to hustle. So, Sam-.” He extended his hand and relaxed his thoughts, letting the Mantra fade as he grasped the other man’s forearm. Sam followed suit. It would happen in seconds, if it was to be. Steve recalled the first time he’d met Sam how he’d felt the faintest flickering spark. As he opened his Core and allowed his astral projection freedom, he experienced the resonance, full and synchronized almost immediately.
Now, that Tony is a memory and Steve must face the world and all of Human Space alone. Bucky accused him of living like a monk. “He’s not wrong,” Steve murmurs into the dark and no one answers. It’s been so long since he’s touched or been touched by anyone. He shouldn’t care, he loved and was loved in return. It should be enough.
“You think too much of me,” Tony mutters and takes his glasses to slip them on. With a tap he brings Jarwin on line. “J man, tell Jami that I want to belay that order.”
“He’s right,” Bruce says stopping Tony from denying the truth. “If you’re remembering it as well, you’re in both realities too. It’s only a matter of time before you-.”
cut from the same cloth. Growing up in the shadow of Captain America memories influenced Tony. He couldn’t deny it. At first, he’d loved Cap and tried to emulate him, but then he resented Cap and lashed out at everything and everyone who symbolized Captain America. Yet, now he found himself in a different place. A different thought process when he thought of Captain America. Maybe because he’d met Steve, started to know Steve and the persona of Captain America faded away. He began to see who Steve was and how they slotted together. Steve and Tony approached the fighting the good fight in different ways: justice, responsibility, accountability, and freedom all wrapped up into sides of the same coin. And now they were bonded together and they were part of a pack that hopefully would protect and save the world. For once, Tony wasn’t alone in his fight and then he realized it with a gasp.
“Let’s do this then,” Bruce said with a lot of confidence that the soul bonds didn’t support. He shrugged. “Sometimes I gotta act like I can do it for the big guy to keep at a distance.”
Happy motions for the security force steps to the side allowing Tony, Steve, and Everhart to meet. The reporter studies Tony much like a spider considers its prey, trapped, webbed, and ready to drain.
That’s all he says but Tony hears the unspoken words that linger in his gaze. Steven will never give him his heart, his soul, his mind. Tony’s hands tremble and he feels both the alpha rage and a simple impotency rush through him. What else doesn’t he know? What if this omega tells the truth? What has science done to them – to all of them? Yet, it isn’t science it is the alphas that somehow managed to get in control. And change everything. He places a hand on his omega’s shoulder.
Steve surveyed the rest of the group. Every member of the pack felt more like the Avengers than a close knit family, but he guessed part of being an Avenger should be like it was when he was with the Howling Commandoes. “Okay, let’s do this.”
A curl of a smile hit Steve’s lips and he bobbed his head. “Yeah, I got it.” He closed his eyes for a moment, the bond settled. When he opened his eyes again, the ruin of his features fixed itself – righted like a cubist painting slotting into place and turning into a classical one. “Okay, let’s go.”
Natasha scoffs. “You want me to figure out what Obadiah Stane is up to? He’s one of the most power people in the whole Conclave and you want me to find out what’s going on in his head.” She chuckles, kicks back in the chair, and rests her feet on her empty desk. “That’s not going to happen. He might be a shadowy figure, but he also happens to command a lot of power.”
She yanks up the voluminous sleeve to reveal a small tube of blue liquid. “Come on, Rogers, wake up.”
Steve lowers his weight onto Bucky and avoids looking at the pus sluggishly oozing from the new wound. "How did it happen? How could it get bad like that? He's only been gone a a half dozen or so hours."
“You know he was a good guy. He sat there and went over code, line by line for me. Checking it and rechecking it. I know he did it right. I made him review things so many times and read it out to me even when I could have had the computer do it for me. I just don’t get why he suddenly -.” Tony stops. “Are you going to say anything at all today? Are you even here at all?” He’s been talking non-stop about Steve for the last 15 minutes and Rhodey – fuck – hasn’t even breathed.
“Our Brother, James, is in dire shape. The arm was directly attached to nerves. They don’t have the technology to repair it,” Thor said and then turned to the nurse as if to confirm he’d reported the stasis correctly.
He mutes his words and drifts on the sounds, keeping his eyes closed so he can experience it like Tony. His hot chocolate forgotten, the food in his backpack fades as Steve listens. Over the ocean’s sounds he hears the twitter of birds and the rustle of leaves, the sway of the large pine trees, and the buzz and clatter of insects all around them. The Earth is alive not only in sight but in sound. He hones in on the breathing of the Earth, the life of it and it blossoms in his chest like a Christmas morning – so wonderous and surprising he nearly gasps in its brilliance.
Steve giggles as if Tony’s joking but then he catches the serious grimace on the prince’s face. “Really? You fly in space, you fly that machine? That Iron Man armor in combat and you don’t like heights?”
The cut of pain and sorrow in Steve’s voice when he beseeched her still troubles Tony today.  He’d demanded an explanation, but never truly received one. What their visitor had told him had been more than cryptic, it had been downright confusing as hell.
“It might be nice, after all of this, if we go back to the island. We haven’t been there for a long time. I’d like to go back. I wonder what Vision and Wanda are up to!” Steve is letting his mind wander, talking about whatever pops into his head. “I’d love to lie in the dewy grass again and listen to the ocean with you, Tony. Maybe that’s where we’ll go.”
Over the course of the rest of the time he spends in the recovery room, Steve attempts to use what little brainpower he seems to have left to jerry-rig a plan together. He doesn’t have many resources. He wonders if Sam is around and figures he isn’t, considering the fact that Steve got him in trouble as well. He’s at the mercy of Tony and, most probably, Ross. He remembers seeing Natasha on the plane, so he might be able to enlist her aid. She switched sides for him once. Maybe again she could listen to him.
She gives a little smirk. “You’re not the only one. You don’t have to carry the burden all on your own. I knew, too. I chose not to tell him.”
“Yeah, but he’s powering through it. The small amulet at his collar is a backup for the glasses. It’s not the greatest and warps the vision according to him, but it’s working to ease some of the issues.” Rhodes sighs. “Tonight is a big night for Tony. Not only should it put some of the rumors that Everhart has been spreading to rest, well, it will also launch a bunch of next tech. The plenary went well, but that was a closed session, so this – this will open everything up to scrutiny. A lot depends on this moment.”
“Apparently, he didn’t,” Natasha said. She looked him up and down. He was only in his boxer shorts – Steve was nude. “Get one of the uniforms from the V-Corp agent and put Steve on the gurney.” She marched away from him. She went to the door and consulted with Clint.
As Tony viewed the horror scene before him, the yearning for blood welled up inside of him as if his ethereal form craved the blood as well. Unmistakable. He found himself closing the distance between himself and Steve as he lay on the floor of the cell. His physical form clawed at Steve’s chest, then curled its finger bones around his arm. Steve awoke in a fugue, Tony saw the bleariness of his focus. He must have realized he was free from hanging from the ceiling, but he had no strength to move. The parasite on his chest nuzzled against him and Steve blinked several times as if trying to figure out what was going on. When he finally managed to peer down at his chest, Steve startled and attempted to scramble away but the creature, driven by the torture Tony had endured and hunger, lurched at him and struck him true. The fangs pierced Steve’s throat and sank deeply. The paralyzing agent hit, and Steve froze, his eyes open and staring at Tony’s wraith spirit, the pain clearly disturbing his expression.
“I know there isn’t one. I used to think there could be. Some benevolent creator. I hoped there was one.” She put her sandwich down and tears gathered in her eyes ran down her face as she bowed her head. “Not after this. Not after that.” She looked behind her at the bio-division building. It had a large sculpture of the helical structure of DNA (twisting in the wrong direction) in front of it. “That – what they do – what
“Hmm. Thor, no?” Steve takes out the toothbrush, spits, and then wipes his face. “I’m sorry Thor. Whatever happened last night, it can’t happen again. I’m not interested in a relationship with you.”
“We can find someone else to be the CEO. I can step back.” She chokes on the words, on her sobs. “I can be your personal assistant again. You don’t have to worry.”
Steve gulped back his words. Did it? Natasha left; he knew she was okay, but the bond that linked them together felt worn, tired, and lost. She’d gone back home to Russia the last Steve heard. What she found there couldn’t have been settling at all, or relaxing. It must have been disturbing, because she was drifting around Russia now with no purpose. Sometimes when he was chanting his Mantra and he reached out - all he felt from her was a low and steady weeping.
“I did. And that was because at the moment, I believed in those orders. If I have questions about an order, any order, I will not follow them. You don’t have to worry about that. You can trust that.”  There was little to no respect for him in this century and it was something that Steve had to get used to. The hollow ache emptied his chest.
“That, my dearheart, is your prostate.” Tony smiles and then slams into that spot again sending Steve into a crazed sob of pleasure. “It’s delightful, isn’t it. That deep spot, inside you, waiting to be touched, wanting to be touched. It’s a little bit of decadence, a little secret you can keep. When we’re in a meeting.” Tony leans down, whispering over Steve. “When we’re in a meeting and I tap on the table, you can imagine that special spot that I’m hitting.” He shoves forward again eliciting a howl from Steve. “It’s a secret between you and me. You know I can touch it, I can fuck you and this reaction is ours. It’s our alone.”
“I told Natasha not to talk to you about it, not to say anything,” Tony said. He ran his hands through his own hair, messing it. “I don’t know what happened, but you came back to life. You survived.”
“Most important thing is out there,” Clint said and swore under his breath as the doors of the elevator opened. “Fucking can’t believe it.”
Another round of appreciative applause. Steve rotates his shoulders, he’s too hot as he listens to Tony’s voice. The tone is off, like the distant howl on the wind warning of something coming. Rhodes steps away from the microphone after a bashful thank you and wave, leaving the podium to Tony again.
Steve knows Tony’s right; they have no other choice. Steve has to keep on task. Climbing the mountain, getting to the Passage is their only goal. But there’s no guarantee that whatever happens in this virtual world won’t harm them somehow – physiologically or psychologically – in the real world. Hell, people are known to bully others online for the sadistic thrill of power – only to find out that there’s real harm to it.
"I like to work with my hands, I like to create things. And truth be told I had to get away from my father's company."
When the elevator arrived, JARVIS announced Captain Rogers and then fell silent as Steve peered into the laboratory space and stepped off of the lift. His gaze traveled over the lab but hopped over to Bruce. A look of relief mixed with concern moved over his expression as he took in the state of the laboratory but also that Bruce seemed relatively calm. And himself.
“Each Passage will have a clue. I wrote the entrance so that I can see the passage into the outer rim. Each successive rim or layer will have a clue that we’ll have to find. Something will be wrong. No, that’s not it. Something with be transitional. I suspect that Ultron will use each layer to try and learn from us as well as stop us.”
After a time, Tony says, “At the start of the Council of Worlds there will be a vote. It looks like we have a strong coalition but not one to win the super majority. We need to move forward and try and bring as many into our fold as possible.”
“This, I like this,” Tony says and cannot believe how hard his heart throbs in his chest. Steven settles behind him.  He gently brings his arm around Tony, laying it on Tony’s chest. Several minutes slip by before Steven speaks.
The ship isn’t boxy or industrial like the cattle car he traveled to Prime Station on. Instead, it is curved and artistic. There are port windows that expand the entire bridge of the ship. The windows are a center piece everywhere he goes on the ship – and windows are not considered useful in ships at all. Viewers controlled by AI do the job better than any window. Yet the prince’s ship seems to use windows functionally as well since every portion of the outside of the ship can be viewed, Steve would bet. It’s jaw dropping. When they walk down the gantry toward the quarters, they pass the galley, the kitchen, and lounge.
Tony sticks out his hand and Steve clasps it. “Then yes, I trust you.” He yanks Tony into a full embrace.
“Of course.” Steve gives a short bow and then hurries away, his mind a jumble of what the prince meant to say. They’d only shared one night and one morning together – there’s nothing to dream about here. This is not a way out. Steve collects his toys and stuffs them into his bag. He needs to get his head on straight.
"You read schematics like a pro," Tony says and feels like a fool. They're about to break out of a terrorist’s stronghold, and here he is trying to compliment the six foot something Adonis - well, Adonis if you don't count the weird growths on his back.
Steve finishes up and cleans his hands, then brushes his teeth. He checks his hair, combing it and then leaves the bathroom. “We’ll I’m not an artist anymore.”
A shiver answered him and then Steve shifted, and Tony felt the hardness of his cock against his inner leg. Steve brought Tony closer and their chests touched, but all Tony could think of was Steve and how he responded, how he was turned on by Tony. It might be ridiculously foolish but it made him so fucking happy. “I want, I want to feel you Tony.”
“My data files identify it as the Caribbean Sea on Earth. It is one of the last files before the planet was abandon due to environmental catastrophe.”
“T’Challa said they have a respectable one, one that serves the palace dignitaries. He arranged a pass for it. I can go there and there shouldn’t be any issues.” He’s not looking forward to it, but he doesn’t really have a choice. If he doesn’t go to the mating blocks he thinks he might end up a little less sane. Right now, his sanity edges toward oblivion with Tony shores away and Bucky frozen and gone from him. Both untouchable.
Anger boiled over and he leapt to go after her, but Thor blocked his way. “Young Stark, leave her. She is your liege and you should respect her. You try her patience.”
He loves dealing with these foolish AI’s.  Nothing like his own. He frowns and hits the screen. “Lord An’Tony of the Stark Family. I am invoking my Right of Possession.”
Tony left the warmth of the fire and went to what amounted to the kitchen area of the cabin. It had a place to prepare food, a cupboard, and a basket with a cover. Tony rummaged around and, when he opened up the cupboard, said, “Ah! I knew it!”
The water is cool and refreshing – and clean. The first of it to splash upon his lips and his tongue tastes like sweet nectar. It’s too much as it flows and he gags and chokes. The hand on his shoulder strokes and rubs and pets him. Words are said and he’s told to rest.
JARVIS answered him by turning on the amber lamps ensconced along the walls. It truly looked like a library out of the last century and never really fit into the rest of the house. He still couldn’t to this day figure out what the hell he was thinking when he designed the place. Years ago. Another lifetime.
Stark only shrugs his shoulders and answers as he cuts into his bacon. “I only wonder if the famous Captain of the Union army represents all of the ideals of America or only select ones. Are you truly Captain America?”
Steve listened to them talking, watched as Bucky stared down at Natasha as if she might be a delicate flower he had to protect. No one ever looked at Natasha that way. No one. She wouldn’t permit it, but here she was allowing Bucky to touch her and keep her close and there was another layer of complexity he never prepared for – how was the pack supposed to deal with it? A bond that excluded the rest of the pack seemed counter to every definition of a pack.
“I can’t see why not. If you have any more questions-.” Steve flexes his hands open and closed – a movement that Tony catches out of the corner of his eyes.
Why didn’t he read that?  Their roles must dictate how they perceived the pack and the soul bonds. “Yeah?”
A gust hits them and Steve squints at the frigid air. Tony activates the helmet again without allowing him to assess the cuts and abrasions. Considering the freezing air, Steve can’t blame him.
The hot chocolate is excellent as are the sugar cookies. “I’m ridiculous. Look at me. Trying still to put on a charade. How much longer can I keep it up?”
That left them with little knowledge of what exactly they face. “Well, at least we know it isn’t when we were here before.” Steve slides off the shield and sets his bag on the floor with it. He notes that Tony’s backpack is missing.
Tony gags and coughs. He wants to say no. He needs to say no. But he can’t. He remembers the places Estane took him. He remembers how Estane laughed when Tony refused to use the men and women locked in the Stalls. He doesn’t want that for Steven. Tony licks his lips and shudders. “Activate, Iron Man punishment level one.”
“I think I know what kind of inner most confidence you’re giving to the prince. Now, unless you want some of the others here to know who you are or should I say what you are, then you’ll come with me.”
“I need to sleep,” Steve grumbled but followed Tony’s prodding. As he sat up with Tony fluffing the pillows and propping cushions around him, Steve rubbed at his eyes and smiled. “I love you.”
“Come on now,” Steve said and unbuttoned his shirt. Normally for a quick drink, Tony would go for the wrist. Steve could easily keep it hidden with his long sleeves, his uniform gloves with their embedded wooden spikes at the knuckles (though Steve had a tendency not to wear them), or his uniform jacket. Tony needed something more substantial and Steve understood it. He wrestled away his shirt and pulled off his undershirt in short order. Embracing Tony, Steve brought him to his chest. A bite at the pectoral, at the nipple tantalized and produced a full bounty of nutrients.
Fury had agreed of course. They’d decided right then and there it wasn’t a good idea for anyone to know anything about Steve. Let the beta loving public think he was a beta or even an alpha but not an omega who would want to take it up the ass. Everyone had assured Steve that the caste system of alphas, betas, and omegas was a thing of the past, but the fact still remained that the betas ruled and saw the entire idea of an alpha and omega as leader and warrior of a clan antiquated and dangerous.
Steve thinks that Tony might actually growl at him, but instead, he wraps the reins around his gloved hand and tugs the horse to follow. Steve falls in beside him and they find their way down the rocks and jagged trail.  Each and every jog and jolt hits the soreness in his shoulder, but Steve muffles his curses and keeps his pain to himself.
“Yes, then. Okay.” Jarvis studies him like he’s a pinned insect under a dissecting microscope. “You see, Captain Rogers, you must pledge the same.” He waves away Steve’s response. “Yes, yes. He had you sign a non-disclosure form. He had you go ahead and sign the contract. But you must know the enormity of what’s happened. Master Tony doesn’t allow anyone to know of his state. Not for years.”
“Yeah, I know. But Tony Stark? Did you read the papers about him? He’s all about himself. He jokes about, you know, women and stuff.”
Steve goes to the bed, disrobes quickly folding his clothes in order to get the courage up to turn around and face the stranger. He was in the army, being naked in front of other men isn’t a problem. Yet he still has to turn around. The alpha takes over.
“Well, I’m assuming Strange had a plan,” Steve said. Otherwise, Steve might lose his temper and punch Strange the next time he saw the guy.  Steve inhaled and exhaled, trying to calm his frustration. The plan had been to learn as a team, to figure out how to work as a team, not to be sectioned off with Tony. Tony – who so obviously loathed him and didn’t trust him. Steve sat on the stool next to the fireplace. He needed to reach out and show he was willing to try with Tony. He gestured for Tony to join him near the fire. “Come on, he’s not going to leave us here for too long. He must have some plan.”
"That about sums it up, doesn't it." Steve says and slams the canister shaped helmet over Tony's head. "Get ready, we won't have much time."
“Is that what you tell yourself at night? So you can fucking sleep?” Tony growled out. “And that it you’re taking about is a person. A man. For Christ’s sake.” Tony put his hands over his eyes. He didn’t want to see anything, didn’t want to face the horror show before him. Some mutant creature would have been easier to deal with. He could have called in zoologists and gotten help. But the lab had been in operation for decades. How many men had his father and then Stane done this to? To what end? Why? The implications shocked Tony. “What was the purpose? Why?” He found himself muttering but not expecting an answer. In the fugue of shock, his mind spun in endless circles. How would they ever clean up this fucking mess? How could he ever repay the man in the cage for his father’s ruthlessness? For Stane’s pitilessness.
He tells JARVIS to stop the stupid movie as he gazes at the little happy trees in the painting. “And tell Pepper to stop ordering me Hobbit artwork.”
“Like yes, I want coffee,” Tony said. His dismissal of the fact that he bubbled over with nervous energy in front of him put a little quirk in Steve’s grin. It was almost like Tony might actually
“Doesn’t seem like it,” Tony muttered and leaned onto the rail, hands clasped as he observed the wonders of the night.
“Well, your what’s right is so very wrong. And you wonder why people don’t trust you to lead the Avengers.”
“More cataclysmic than a Collapsing Event?” Tony asks and he walks over to the open doors to the patio. Steve exhales.
Tony pushes Clint out of the way and sets up the coffee machine to fill up a mug. “No, not the medical tape, the painting. Where’d it come from?”
The Archangel Fury will decide. “But I convinced the board, especially Phillips that you deserved another chance.”
Steve chuckled and closed his eyes as he sat with the tray over his lap and his lax hand on the power drink. “Certainly is weird. It’s strange that no scientist can actually figure it out. That all these years since it first appeared in the Middle Ages, people still don’t understand it.”
It had been the month after Bucky was frozen that Steve found himself in the Grand Library of the Palace. Not many were allowed entrance in the back room of the library, but T’Challa arranged for him to have a day in the library after finding him roaming the halls of the Palace with a worn out look on his face and little spring to his step.
They bring hordes of doctors to speak with him. They show him the television and ask him if he remembers things. They tell him he was a big comic book fan and he nods. That's true, he thinks. He thinks he wanted to be an artist for a comic book at one time. They encourage these parts of his scattered memory. He asks where he is and they tell him a secret military facility. They look sadly at him like he should know these things.
Pietro smiles, the light from the windows glinting off his unnaturally white hair. “Don’t worry, I’ll take good care of him.”
Tony watches him for a few minutes, absently stroking his cock, feeling the glands, the base of his knot. He plays with it for a while as Steven’s eyes are half lidded and he’s beginning to look drunk with the feeling surging through him from his gland. Tony slides his cock into Steven’s mouth, musing on how angry he was only moments ago. Now he’s in the presentation room, his omega’s trussed up, and he’s getting off. He revels in it. This is power.  This is glory. This is what it means to be a Stark and be a prime alpha. There is something to those lessons from Estane, all those years ago. He owes Oby that much.
“We bought them last night after the paparazzi snapped photos of us together. I think we fixed your issue with your boss. No one is going to think you’re sleeping with him anymore.”
“Shit,” he says and drops to his knees. How the hell can he do this and not electrocute both of them in the process. He searches the room and remembers the pile of clothes Tony pulled the shirt for him. He retrieves the cleanest one he can find and then tears it to shreds. Using strips he dunks it into the water and then begins to meticulously clean around the wires and scrubbing at the puss and inflamed tissue.
“It looked like you worked something out, on the flight back that is,” Bruce said, and the jerk had a smile a mile wide that he attempted but failed to hide with the mug. “You spent the day with him.”
The hands are steady and strong. The voice is soft and kind. He doesn’t deserve either. “Come. Let me help you into bed.”
As he’s weighing his next move, Stark, Banner, and a young woman enter the room from the other entrance through the parlor.
“Yeah, that sounds good.” But Steve couldn’t get over it – the feeling in his chest. It wasn’t disappointment or resentment. As he looked upon Tony now, the fog cleared away and he saw his life and Tony’s so differently. More than opportunity, his soul clicked into place. It had been untethered and frayed and yet now, now something incredible happened.
Over the past two month, Steve entertained a variety of different clients from the silent ones who just want to get down to business to the talkative ones who, to the shy and awkward ones, to the abrasive and short tempered ones. They all respond to him to different degrees. Some only grunt, others stay quiet, while others scream like they’re on fire.
Steve chuckled. “Hinterlands? It’s a farm. And yes, I do. I think we need to have a secluded place where we can work on the soul bonds. And then plan our next move.”
“Astral projections have energy waves. Energy waves like all waves can cancel each other out. They must synchronize perfectly to bond,” JARVIS said. “A bonding experience is rare, a soul pack rarer still. As it is, Captain Rogers might not find another person to be in his soul pack.”
Steve had read it right. They were matched. As he met Sam’s gaze, the word tumbled out of his mouth, “Companion.” He grunted as the pain shot through him and heard Sam groan in surprise of the pain. Their hands broke apart as Sam gripped his wrist in reaction to the searing through his nerves that Steve knew all too well now.  The brand burned its way onto Steve’s forearm, encircling the other brands but leaving room for others. It was the most intricate, the most encompassing of all of them. It connected to the wrist leader brand but also all of the other brands on Steve’s arm. When he looked over at Sam’s arm he saw a large loop with a weaving pattern throughout it, smaller brands that looked like Natasha’s, Bruce’s, and Peggy’s resided alongside it.
“You know I’m not sure if you’re about to throw me a welcoming party or try and shoot me dead. But that last isn’t going to work, so I’ll just ask where’s the cake,” Tony says as he lets the shoulder panels open once again and JARVIS targets the Hunter’s soldiers.
Steve nodded. He surveyed the workshop, the papers abandoned on Tony’s workbench and then said, “I have to check on Clint. He needs help. I want to help you, Tony. If you’ll let me. I’ll go to see Clint. The nurse called me this morning and told me that he was waking up. If you need me, you’ll know where to find me.”
“Sir, Captain Rogers is at the entrance to the workshop and would like to see you,” JARVIS announced.
“It won’t come out,” Rumlow stated. “It won’t.” He looked like he just snacked on puppies and hung their tails on his vest.
“He’s also a friend,” Tony says. Admitting a truth must be progress. “He’s been by my side for over a month Pepper. Every day. Right now, he’s not even really getting his every 7th day off. Sure, he takes it, but he’s still here stuck on this island with me.”
“The Passage may not be distinct, but it will there. It might be a visual queue, an auditory one. It can even be an action,” Tony said.
“Jesus fucking Christ!” Every nerve in Tony’s body vibrated with horror and anger. “What the fuck! That’s a god damned human being!” He whipped around to face Rumlow and Sawyer. “That’s a man.” It was obvious the ‘creature’ was a man since he hadn’t been afforded any clothing.
“There are some workers. Minimal staff from what we understand.” Pepper unbuckled. “They have strict instructions about who can come and who can enter.”
“You need a whole hell of a lot more courage than that. Look at me when you talk about what you like and what you’ll do.”
“Good to know.” She scribbles something on her pad. “”You know more than I thought. Though I have an idea that you’ve watched more vids than actually done things. I’m going to sign up with an easy client first. One of our best clients. He just came from the front and pinged today for a session.”
“Don’t tell me you wouldn’t have gone back to Pepper. You love her!” Steve isn’t going to have anything of this – not at all. He did what was right. He divorced himself from any hope he could be with Tony.
Steve slips them on Tony’s face. He sits there next to Tony, his expression tight, pensive. After a long pause, Steve says, “I can’t pretend to know what it feels like to not see. If I couldn’t see, I wouldn’t be able to do any of my art. And I’d be lost without that. My mom died before she got to see me graduate art school. I joined the Army partially to follow in my father’s footsteps and partially because I just couldn’t afford to feed myself anymore. I did my tours; I did my duty. I lost my fiancé in a mission. I came home. When I interviewed for this job I had less than 20 bucks to my name. I know what it means to do without. I might not have the physical issue – outside of the chemical induced asthma I got from my tours in the Army – that you do, but I do understand, a tiny bit about having less of something that this world runs on. You gave me an opportunity here, Tony. I was trying to give you one, too.” He stops and swallows hard, audibly. Even without his glasses on Tony would have heard it, seen it in his mind’s eye. “I’ll get you home and get my things. I’ll be out by the end of the day.”
Steve pushes past the prince. He’s naked as the day he was born, but that’s not going to stop him. Nothing stops him when he’s on a roll. “Yes, as in rape. I convinced him I could only blow him.” When Steve says blow, Tony blanches. “Because I wasn’t prepped to have him rip me to shreds. Well once he pulled out his dick, I grabbed hold of it, twisted and punched him in the face. I thought he was down, but I stupidly didn’t disarm him. So, he used the bully stick what you called the shock rod on me.”
“I think this conversation is over and you are dead, Iron Man. Perhaps I will take over as the Iron Man, no?” He snaps his fingers again. A man jumps out of the back of the SUV. He’s carrying a whip and a remote that must also control the collar around the lion’s neck. He cracks the whip once and the lion startles.
Bent by the wind, they slog from the cover of the trees to the open plains and the rise. The hail crashes down but the shield protects them. Steve has no issue holding the shield in place, thankfully the serum gives him the fortitude and endurance he needs. The ground beneath them gets sloppy with mud and hail as it defies all logic and forms sleets of ice. Both of them are wearing boots and Tony’s pulled out a gauntlet. He isn’t using it, yet, but it’s a good defense if they need it.
Just the emergency crews, the media, and the police. Steve took his time talking to the police. He explained what happened and discussed some of their options. He never mentioned the soul pack or the fact that he linked the Avengers to terrorists. He only told the police that the girl and her brother were being mentally manipulated by Hydra and that they were not to be harmed. The police looked perplexed but they agreed to call the Avengers if the two were taken into custody.
Steve nods quickly and turns away. As he works at the sink, he says in a weak voice, “I’m sorry to hear that. I always thought you were a great couple.”
He clears his throat and then stands up, breaking them apart. Tony’s hands feel cold. “I just, I’m really tired. Can I help you to your room?”
“Thor, take to the air. Give us a report out on their defenses. Iron Man, go with him and don’t shoot until we have an idea if there are any civilians in the area.” JARVIS indicated civilians through audible signals and Tony relayed vital statistics from his feed from JARVIS through the HUD. “Clint and Nat – go toward the west and see if you can feed the Legion toward Sam and I. We’ll be at the fork of the creek. Bruce, I need you to stay behind today. I need to see if when things escalate you can control the Hulk until we call a code green.” Bruce nodded and settled on a chair on the porch. Steve was certain he would be pacing the length of the porch over the next hour.
“No, you shouldn’t, but you will,” Fury says and starts toward the door. Steve doesn’t try and stop him, only stands shocked and still and sinking into the memories. “I’m sorry, Cap, if that means anything.”
“The worse part was – that of all of it – it was the image of you dead at my feet, the pack gone, all the souls in tatters that broke-.” He stopped, stuttering into a sob. “Tha-that broke me. Broke everything.”
“But we have all the time in the world, right? It isn’t like a ton of time is passing on the outside.”
Before Luke opens the door to the room, he turns back to Tony, Steve, and the two guards that followed them. “Listen, man, I know you want discrete, and you will get discrete. No one in my shop will tattletale about you at all. I just want to assure you that what happens in The Cage stays in The Cage.”
The massive animal settles down, sitting, while he allows Tony to run his hands over his side and flanks. It doesn’t take long to find the horrible slice across Blu’s back. The lion rumbles low in his throat but doesn’t move as Tony inspects the ugly wound. “It doesn’t look infected.”
He stumbles but takes it from her. “Uniform? What kind of uniform?” Dressing him like his part would be the height of rudeness. He’s sure that Tony wouldn’t approve of something like that at all.
“Omegas kind of creep me out.” She tugs up her hood and he chuckles a little at her. She looks ridiculous. He shrugs on the jacket but doesn’t lift the hood even after she frowns at him. She’s his friend not his mother.
He’s never had more than three, but his mind is a whirl of need and he’s heady with pleasure. “Yeah, yeah. All of it. All of it.”
Raids cleaned out the dens all the time, scatterings humans and vamps alike onto the streets or taken into custody for mixing. Willing humans went to Blood Dens for multiple reasons from curiosity to pleasure to masochism. Tony didn’t ask. Usually he found a human in the den and drank his fill. Leaving his unnamed meal in post-coital heaven and his own belly full. Walking into that fateful Blood Den, six years ago, Tony had been starving. He’d spent too long away from safety and he needed blood fast. He didn’t kill. He wouldn’t. It was a vow to Yinsen Tony refused to break. He would never kill again. Becoming part of the undead didn’t make him into a soulless creature seeking out death and destruction. Vampires had souls as much as humans did. He wasn’t going to argue the philosophical existence of souls or gods.
Looking down, Steve had trailed his fingers over the slight bulge near the thumb joint. He noticed it on both hands. “What?”
“What if he dies? Does anyone know what happens then?” Tony asked and Bruce had the good grace to pale and not to go green.
“Look who’s talking?” Tony snickers. “I mean you literally changed, had mad scientists one of which was my father experiment on you.”
“Okay.” For the first time, Steve glimpses a younger, more innocent prince before him, his eyes wide with gratitude.
He recalled how Thor told him that Loki would spend his centuries in stasis. When Tony asked what it had meant, Thor only flinched and mournfully said, “As a wraith. Do everything you can not to be condemned to the life as a wraith. Once there, you may never return.”
Tony opens his mouth as if he might refuse but then shuts it and walks beyond Steve toward the lift. It’s exactly where Steve needs to go in order to leave the ship. Tony steps aside and starts toward his own quarters. Steve hits the button, wishing for the damned lift to get there, but then before it does Tony returns.
Steve looked up where the penthouse was and then back at Thor. The idea of leaving Tony alone in a vulnerable state as he desperately sank into a well of sorrow pushed Steve toward the edge of his own despair. He’d only just came to a comfortable understanding with his sexuality and now the haunting images of the dream space shadowed him. Having it hang over his head pushed down on his shoulders until he literally felt it in his bones.
“Whoa there. You’re like a bucking horse. For Crips’ sake, calm down.” Tony looked wrecked, his lips bruised with kisses. Steve knew he must look the same, though probably more ruined and anxious and panting. He didn’t want to lose the excitement – or the courage. “You need to take a moment, Steve. We’re still a little punch drunk from that shared dream. We need to assess.”
Bruce raged up onto his knees as his forearm showed the same mark that Steve now sported in addition to the brand bracelet. It curved into concentric circles and speared through with green. Steve thought it was ironic and trite but none of that mattered as Bruce transformed – the Hulk bursting free and launching at Steve. Scrambling to his feet, Steve lurched away but the chairs and the rest of the Avengers were in the way. He toppled but the Hulk easily seized him by his neck and squeezed. Steve slammed his fist into the Hulk’s face to little affect.  It only served to cause the beast to howl and grip his fist tighter around Steve’s neck.
