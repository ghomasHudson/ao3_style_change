Which brought a decisive look to the Captain’s eyes who proceeded to approach the alien robots/machine parts. Tony next to him was starting to protest and even Richards looked a bit wary, but the man looked like he knew what he was doing, so Bruce just kept a hand on Tony’s arm and watched Steve’s back cautiously.
Of course, he was a total sweetie when it was just Steve around, acting like a bulky puppy and using Steve’s lap as his personal pillow. Plus, they had been through so much together already, Bucky probably saw him as his pack, just like how Steve considered him his brother. He knew that Bucky would always have his back and even if they were no longer in war-zone and the most Steve had to fear nowadays was probably being hit by a car crossing the road, it was still reassuring to know that there was someone with him, ‘til the end of the line and all.
In her excitement, she brought Ironteddy to show Mr Stark and his business partner, Mr Stane. Mr Stane loved Ironteddy, he marveled on how handsome the teddy looked, how tough his posture seemed, yet at the same time still so adorable kids would definitely love it.
“I still cannot believe that you were the first one to recognize WALL-E!”, grumbled Tony, who were in the middle of reading the scans on the bots. The Fantastic Four, now that the portal had disappeared and the mystery of the aliens had been solved, already went back to their headquarters (Bruce bet that Richards was still sore on the fact that Steve knew something he didn’t). “I must have watched it with Dummy a hundred times already! Why does he have such an obsession on that movie anyhow?”
Steve learned that it was not a good idea to keep Bucky away from Tony. None of their friends agreed to dog-sit for him anymore, even Phil whom he suspected had a framed photo of him in his bedroom (which kind of crept him out, but Tony was the one who told him this so he might just be yanking his chains). Bucky seemed to be nicer to Tony’s friends, but the one time he asked Pepper, Bucky spent the evening moping around her place, whining at her pitifully like a giant puppy and staring at photos of Tony on her mantelpiece like a lovelorn teenager. Pepper, a formidable lady who could crush her business rivals like paper dolls without blinking an eyelash, caved under Bucky’s deceptive innocence and brought him back to Steve’s that night right in the middle of their making out on the couch. She looked an entirely unimpressed at their wrinkled clothes but seemed guilty enough when Bucky padded into the living room and plopped down on the couch like he never left (they spent the evening cuddling glumly while Bucky reclaimed his spot on Tony’s lap, his nose wrinkling every so often and glaring at Steve like he knew what they were up do prior to his arrival).
There was a loud thump against the window as Bucky body-slammed at the door, single-mindedly trying to get inside the room. A small crack started to form in the centre of the glass, threatening to widen as Bucky ran off into the garden to gain momentum for his next crash.
Sure, they met at SHIELD Headquarters frequently, but Tony had been so busy lately that those became just quick meetings and running across one another in the corridor as he juggled between works for SHIELD, meetings at SI and time spent innovating/inventing. Tony usually stayed at his penthouse four nights a week, but when he did stay over on the weekend, Bucky would be with them every minute. The few rare dates they had, Bucky insisted on tagging along every time, climbing into the car and not budging until they gave up and took him along. At least Bucky behaved while they were out, but that also meant that they were very conscious about having an audience during their supposedly ‘alone’ time. Steve felt uncomfortable making out with Tony in the car with Bucky sitting at the back, staring at them with narrowed blue eyes. Tony used to snuggle into his side as they walked down the street, but since he had Bucky’s leash (Bucky refused to walk leashed to Steve) and Bucky had developed this habit of yanking his leash, Tony had a hard time keeping close to Steve.
Sometimes, he wished that he had never met Tony, so that Tony would never meet Bucky again. Immediately after that, he felt disgusted at himself. Because Tony, Tony was everything. Tony was the love of his life, the other side to his coin, so very different yet fundamentally the same. Tony, who lived through horrors and pains and came back stronger, who changed his way when he saw what his creations were brought to be, who now worked for the better good, investing endless time and energy and resources in SHIELD. Tony, who shared a long nightmare with Bucky, who saved both Bucky and himself in the process, who made sure that Bucky was home safe. Tony, who saw the good that was in the scruffy scary shell of a dog, who loved Bucky unquestionably like a friend, a brother in his own right. Tony, who was one of this new world, yet also shared Steve and Bucky’s world, who walked the line between light and darkness, who gave them his heart and expected nothing in return. Tony, who made Bucky a better leg and rebuild the essence of New York in Steve. Tony, his better half, his partner, his soulmate. Tony, whom he could not live without, Tony, whose rings of laughter fuelled his world.
Before Tony’s imminent arrival, Steve tried his best to make sure that Bucky would be on his best behaviour (or be as good as he possibly could, Steve stopped being so hopeful years ago). He got Bucky’s favourite treats and spoiled him with a long walk and a good hour of Frisbee at the park. He gave him extra pets and cuddles, and he even sat Bucky down for a talk (“Tony’s very important to me and I really like him a lot, so please be nice to him tomorrow, you understand me Buck?”, to which Bucky’s jaws gaped widely for a yawn and he went back to burying his nose into Steve’s shirt as he snoozed). The next morning, he put Bucky in the garden, hoping that giving Tony a tour of the house and letting his scent settle in first would help with calming Bucky down.
Mrs Stark was very sad. She thought Mr Stark would finally be happy with the teddy, how could he not, for Ironteddy was such a lovely bear. Mr Stane, after a long while sitting in silence with a frown on his face, came to the table and sat Ironteddy upright. He comforted Mrs Stark, telling her that Mr Stark was probably just tired, Ironteddy was indeed perfect in every way, he would bring the blueprint to the factory and have Ironteddy in production right away. Then he picked Ironteddy up and returned him to Mrs Stark. He patted the teddy on the head and took his leave.
Teddies were usually given to children who had an endless wealth of love for them. They hugged and kissed and had tea parties with teddies, they drooled on teddies as they slept, they sneaked teddies out to school in their knapsacks and had teddy picnics with little sandwiches and juice boxes and apples. That was where teddies got most of their love, the love which they hoarded like treasures for the days to come, the days in the future where the children grew up and no longer played with them. For those dark days, they still had the ember of love that the children once gave them, still had the memories of sunshine and warmth, even as they spent the rest of their days stuffed in a box full of other childhood toys. For a teddy, that was what called happiness.
He stumbled across the desert, dragging his tattered body and the heavy arc reactor sitting in his chest, not knowing exactly where to go. The Ten Rings was a ball of fire behind him, Mr Yinsen was dead, his chest was empty of love and his decorative repulsors now glowed with an icy blue. He did not even recognise Rhodeybear when his friend came running towards him; only after they were safe on the chopper could he register Rhodeybear’s warm brown eyes. The empty hole in his chest started to slowly fill with love, and Ironteddy wept. When Obie greeted him at the airport with a big hug, he could not help but burying his head into Obie’s familiar smell, his paws gripping tight and imagining his warm smile. He was so in shock, he did not even realise that Obie’s warm love was long gone.
And so, Ironteddy began creating again. Obie moved him and the bots to a workshop he had set up in the basement of his mansion and filled it with tools and materials of all kinds. Ironteddy no longer had to freeze and hide away, he was now free to move and hammer and weld and invent to his heart’s desire. He drew hundreds of designs and made them into perfect gadgets that Obie happily carted away and had them mass-produced. Ironteddy even got the chance to finally create JARVIS and install him all over the room. Ironteddy had never felt more free, yet somehow never more alone, for Obie was at work a lot and hardly ever visited him unless to get more creations and sprinkle him with enough love to keep him warm. Edward was never allowed in the basement and the bots gradually were insufficient to keep him healthy, for designing and using tools took a toll on a teddy bear. JARVIS, while a brilliant concept and was more alive than he ever thought possible, was still a computer program and did not know how to love. He now had all the toys and tools he could wish for, yet it was not enough still. He wanted another friend. Yet, robots did not seem to suffice.
“We tried calling you all night, he sneaked out at some point after dinner, he must have managed to open the front door. We were so worried, we thought that someone’d come in and taken him, or he’d got lost somewhere, this isn’t his neighbourhood. We looked for him for hours, we called the police, we were already on the way to your place. Thank god he’s back safely. He’s all right, isn’t he?”
Bucky just looked monstrously smug when he once more resumed his post on Tony’s left side on the bed, grinning toothily at Steve over Tony’s shoulder, and Steve felt like crushing the phone in his hand, or whacking Bucky’s snout with rolled-up newspaper.
Tony had somehow migrated back to beside Steve who had a hold on his hand and were rubbing his thumb along Tony’s hand in reassurance (Bruce usually did not make a habit of paying attention to his teammates’ PDA, but for some reasons he found it more calming to look at them than the bot-situation, which had a much higher chance of resorting in oil-shed and tattered cables). Tony’s face was a conflict of worry (for his bots, because as much as he liked to pretend otherwise Tony’s affection for his creations was genuine) and intrigue (because deep down he was still a scientist and was prone to curiosity, and this was the definition of an unpredictable scientific scenario). The whole team, too, were tensed and had subconsciously spread out to circle the bots.
The third time, Rhodeybear came back smelling of stale beer. He had accidentally stepped in a puddle of spilled beer, he said. They spent the rest of the night trying to wash Rhodeybear and get rid of the smell.
Except for Mr Stark. For it finally dawned on him one very important realisation: Ironteddy was much smarter than him. Impossibly, a teddy bear made from yarn and microfibres were the brain behind Stark Industries now, not just the toys but also the very intricate technologies. The only thing Mr Stark had to offer was his human hands which he could use to craft the invention. If Ironteddy had such hands, Mr Stark himself would become obsolete. And while the teddy was happy to let Mr Stark take all the credits, Mr Stark himself knew deep down inside that he was no more than a worker for a teddy bear. That thought humiliated and enraged him. A teddy bear he once thought was not enough, and in truth was never as good as his old Captain, was now his superior. The one thing he had always treasured, his creativity and intellect, thwarted by a stuffed toy. And so, Mr Stark gradually grew to resent Ironteddy. He started to pick fights with him for no reasons, started to make silly errors and berate Ironteddy when the creation failed. Ironteddy could also feel his love quickly draining, replaced by cold ire and blazing fury. Yet, a teddy remembered and craved love, and so he told himself,
When he carried a sleepy Tony to bed that night and Bucky jumped on the bed with them, settling happily at their feet, Steve only admonished him half-heartedly and petted his soft furry ears. Exception could be made for one day, and it was a very special day, after all.
So, when Tony came into their lives, it was like he had taken Bucky from him. Bucky, who now revolved his attention and undying devotion to Tony, saw him as another in his pack, someone soft-bellied and fragile that needed to be protected. Bucky, who remembered the horrors the two of them faced in that dim cave in Afghanistan, remembered the man who hugged him through cold nights and made him a new leg and shared the few morsels of food with him, the man who brought him home to Steve. Bucky, who saw the scars and blood on Tony and told himself, never again. Bucky, who saw Steve as a threat to Tony. Bucky, who was no longer his best mate, his second-in-command, his anchor in the world. Bucky now looked at him like a stranger while Steve helplessly let that happen because the alternative meant he would lose them both.
They should have seen this coming. Tony was a highly classified celebrity who owned Stark Industries and had access to high-tech weaponry on a daily basis. Tony, whose brilliant mind meant the creation of a miniaturised arc reactor in a cave and a new element synthesised in his basement. Tony, who had connections with SHIELD and the Army. Tony, a world-class genius, was essentially still a man with no military training and none of the protection one of his calibre should have. Tony, the most prized bargaining chip of all.
Steve, who was saved by a column nearby that blocked the ceiling coming down above him, crawled out of the ruins among a billow of dust and smoke. It took them hours to locate everyone and pulled them out. There were no fatalities, but a lot were badly injured. Colonel Rhodes got a poker machine to his head and was unconscious, Natasha had a long gash on her arm and a bigger bruise on her temple. Bucky, whose prosthetic leg was dented, limped towards Steve, blood dripping from his flank and Tony’s chip wedged between his teeth.
“And Hill’s got another pool on when you will succumb to Tony’s manly charm and bang him in one of SHIELD’s meeting rooms. There is a shocking amount of money going into that one.”
Steve plopped down on top of Tony and buried his head into the base of Tony’s neck, groaning to the increasingly loud barks from the outside. Tony only sighed and petted his hair regretfully.
Steve thought it was kind of cute at first, how protective Bucky was to Tony. It was also understandable, seeing that they had bonded over the worst of circumstances. It was way better than what he had envisioned in mind when he brought Tony home to Bucky; so, in a way, he should be grateful that Bucky had taken to Tony so well.
To be fair, Tony doted on Bucky and spoiled him rotten. With the advantage of knowing Bucky beforehand, Bucky’s scruffy appearance did not deter him the slightest and he smothered Bucky with pats and hugs and even kisses. He bought him the most fancy treats and let him nose around his workshop (Bucky loved the workshop, especially the bots whom he chased after like a puppy). He regularly did maintenance on Bucky’s leg and took over Steve’s task of rubbing the joint with soothing oil. He let Bucky climb all over him in excitement and snuggled with him in bed.
They were an all right bunch, in general. Of that, Bruce did not complain, even though Richards could be kind of a dick and Johnny Storm was just annoying at times. But Sue Storm was nice and Grimm was a decent sort. And while they did conduct extremely unsafe experiments the likes of which not even Tony was willing to (soberly) consider on a daily basis, generally they were around to help clean up the mess (which should have been their responsibility in the first place, but anyway. Guess Cap’s goodliness was getting to him).
Tony on his left was starting to squint a little. He must have picked up the music too, because he quickly glanced at Bruce with a what-the-fuck expression on his face. Bruce shrugged, helplessly.
But anyway, since no one looked like they wanted to close this portal anytime soon, Bruce now also found himself looking at it in resignation. To be fair, the portal was very well-behaved so far. The bright light emitting from the yawning gape of time and space, which was oddly calm and peaceful and not at all threatening, just kept on growing in intensity. Bruce even heard a very soft instrumental piece in the background, which bizarrely enough had a great calming effect on the Other Guy. Bruce himself though was shuddering a little from all the strange events.
One day, however, he heard people shouting outside of his workshop door. The screeching sound of machinery did not allow him to hear what they said, but it sounded like Obie was arguing with someone else. The next day, Obie asked him to go to a demonstration in Afghanistan. Our troops were based there, he said, they used a lot of our products and would like to have an expert on hand as they tried out the new missile. Who was better for the job, and besides, wasn’t your pal Rhodey there too? Maybe you could throw in a surprise visit.
Richards, to his credit, did look a bit chagrined this time, although Bruce would bet his collection of Hulk merchandises (no, he did not purchase those himself, thank you very much. They were a teamed effort between Clint’s weird sense of humor and Tony’s I-don’t-give-a-fuck-and-besides-you-look-good-in-green attitude) that the guy was already formulating the next portal in his head.
They arrived at an abandoned casino near Reno and went after the blinking signal from the chip. Bucky found it on a poker machine, caked with blood.
Ironteddy had expected to have to beg, to plea, to do horrible things for Thanos in exchange for his wish. Yet, nothing of the sort happened. Thanos just patted Ironteddy’s head with his giant purple hand, a hand so huge and savage, yet so warm and comforting, not unlike that of Mr Stark and Obie, a long long time ago. Ironteddy felt a warmth radiating from Thanos, not from love for Ironteddy, but for someone else, a love so fierce that even a normal teddy bear could feel, a love most unrequited, for the object of said love was already too far from reach.
(then there was that heartbreaking moment when Richards opened – he still swore he didn’t mean it – the portal to WALL-E universe and there was a teary goodbye when everyone hugged and Steve and Tony were absolutely devastated and the bots were inconsolable for the entire month while the Avengers just moped around the building dejectedly. Bruce would later find Steve’s sketches of all the robots, all beautifully detailed, and would walk into the common room one late night to find Tony watching repeats of all of WALL-E and EVE’s house cams and not holding back his tears. Bruce still had a photo of him with the WALL-Es in frame on his desk which never failed to bring him tears.)
If it were just any old teddy bears, they would have just accepted their sad reality and did their best to pass by their lonely days. But Ironteddy was a stubborn and smart teddy who refused to accept his fate. And he was nothing if not resourceful. He was created by the brightest of minds and that carried over in him, for there must be a time, so very distant in the past when Ironteddy was nothing more than a doodle on paper, when Mr Stark did feel some love for him. He was made to be a logical teddy, and so he asked himself, where should he get love from? Mr and Mrs Stark were of no help, Mr Jarvis and Obie were not enough to sustain him for long, there were no children or anyone else in the house and he was incapable of going outside by himself.
So, no more forced separation. Steve would try to placate Bucky’s protective instinct this time. They would go on a normal date with Bucky tagging along. Nice picnic, walk in Central Park, then back to Tony’s place. They would let Bucky stay with the bots, since Bucky adored them, and let them distract Bucky for a couple hours. JARVIS could let them know if Bucky was getting antsy. Bucky could learn to stay out of the room and in the morning, he would realise that Steve had not harmed Tony during the night, Tony would emerge a happy healthy person and Bucky really had nothing to worry about.
Silence reigned still. If this was a cartoon there would definitely be chirping crickets, but Bruce very much did not want to envision his life any more like a cartoon than it already was.
, he told himself, as he deliberately followed Captain’s paw with his. Then, all of the sudden, Captain came to a halt.
And for a while, it seemed like things were getting there. Ironteddy was quite spooked after he realised his feelings and planned to pull away from Captain before it could get worse, but Captain, in all of his red-white-blue glory, was determined to stop that from happening. When Ironteddy tried to hole up in the workshop and lose track of time by fixing a bit of armour, Captain squirmed his way in with a sketch book and giant puppy eyes, asking to hang out. Eventually, Ironteddy just gave up and let Captain do as he please. Which meant a lot of team movie nights, days out on the basketball court and prank wars all over the tower. There were also quiet nights, when Captain talked Ironteddy into snuggling with him into a fluffy blanket and watching old black-and-white movies, or nights spent on the balcony just stargazing and chatting. It did nothing to quell Ironteddy’s feelings and he found himself loving Captain more and more each day. And it seemed to him like Captain was starting to feel something too, for every now and then he caught Captain looking at him intensely or feeling their paws brushing against one another as they walked side by side around the park at night. He did not want to think about it, but sometimes he could even feel a tiny ember of love warmth radiating from Captain, a small thing that grew with each day, basking him in a warm glow and making him want to burst into joy.
Surprisingly enough, the truth did not quite impact the relationship between humans and teddies, as the teddies had long feared. Apparently, the fact that they could only be alive thanks to human’s love made them even more desirable, for it put them under the mercy of human and their whims. Humans always did love to feel superior. There were a few cases where people threw away their teddies, horrified that they were sentient, but those teddies were soon rescued and donated to orphanages, where they received even more love. Overall, people thought of them as pets, which was how teddies had always seen themselves anyway. Super smart teddies like Ironteddy was one in a billion, so there was no big ethical debates as to what owning a teddy meant.
And so Ironteddy lived in Edward’s room. It was smaller and a lot more cramped than the toy room and it was chock full of things. Edward’s clothes strewn from one end to the other of the room, his desk was full of books and pens and knick-knacks, his games and toys in various corners. Edward placed Ironteddy on the bookshelf and promptly forgot all about him. Edward, a boy of twelve, no longer desired teddy bears but he loved the bots. He adored their movements and whistles and he tied toy guns onto them and enacted alien battles with them as they moved about confusedly in this new room.
. And so he braced himself and soldiered through another day, through Mr Stark’s increasing insults and frustration.
So, so very unwillingly, he got off Tony with a sigh. Tony looked as if he wanted to risk Natasha’s wrath and pull him back down, but obviously thought better and told JARVIS to accept the call.
When Tony woke up that afternoon, Steve hugged and peppered kisses all over Tony’s face, much to the man’s amusement and fake gagging. Bucky was uncharacteristically quiet the whole while, and when Tony saw him, he patted the other side of his bed, wordlessly telling him to get into bed. Bucky walked over to the bedside, but instead of jumping up right away like he usually did, he turned and looked at Steve, as if asking for permission, the first time he had ever done such a thing. When Steve looked through Tony’s wound and was sure that a bit of jostling would not reopen them, he nodded and Bucky gingerly climbed onto the bed, then scooted over to Tony’s leg and draped his heavy head on his thigh, whimpering softly.
). Spideybear had been loved his entire life and while the two of them shared a tiny apartment in Queens and May was away at work a lot, they had never wanted for anything. Spideybear had lived his entire life always filled to the brim with love and affection, and while Ironteddy knew that was a normal life for a teddy, the concept of it was so foreign to him he could not wrap his head around it at all.
And so, Ironteddy made himself a teddy bear. It was hard work for a teddy bear, to make another teddy, for he never knew how to crochet or sew or thread. He wanted his friend to be perfect, so he spent days looking for the perfect material, the softest yarn and felt, the nicest buttons, the fluffiest microfibre. He had to hide it from Obie who would not want him to make teddies while he was supposed to make gadgets and weapons. It took him a long time, but finally his teddy bear was complete, a grey bulldozer of a bear with so many huggable pieces, who looked fierce and threatening yet still a ball of fluff underneath, not unlike Ironteddy himself. He named him Rhodeybear.
And what does that say about his life, that what he termed ‘strange’ did not encompass a freak accidental portal connecting his world to an alternative universe of god-knows-what, but instead included serene halo-like light from a portal that also hummed Pixar-esque BGM.
So apparently there was a universe in which WALL-E and EVE and the crew from the Pixar movie existed. And apparently Mr. Fantastic had accidentally calculated the coordinates for said universe and opened a portal linking Bruce’s laboratory to that. Also, said universe had deemed it appropriate to return the call by gracing them with the original WALL-E and EVE, who were now being alternatively cooed over by Thor and petted by Steve. And did he just see Black Widow taking a photo of the bots looking all wide-eyed and setting it as her phone background?
“Well, I wouldn’t mind if he was half an hour late. Bucky has the most horrible timing, I swear he has an internal clock that’s set to when Tony and I are together.”
“You two were doing things, yes? Maybe he thought Tony was in danger? Did Tony look or sound pained? Oh wait, you know what, don’t answer that, I don’t need to know what you two are up to– No Angie, we don’t need to know, I know you think that Tony’s fit, that’s between us, Angie– Anyway, sorry about your night Steve. Hope you had a good time before that at least.”)
Dummy and the gang just stood in silence at their station. WALL-E and EVE still huddled behind Steve.
The first night, Rhodeybear came back without a stitch out of place and a million stories to tell. He told Ironteddy about all the tall buildings he saw, the colourful lights, the giant billboards, the plastic bags floating on the streets, the stores with beautiful clothes inside, the drunk people singing and dancing with a teddy bear they thought they had hallucinated, the smells and sounds, all the most bizarre and disgusting and wondrous things about the city. Rhodeybear slept soundly that night to dreams of the next day while Ironteddy watched his best friend, thinking of a day when Rhodeybear would not return.
When they got married a year later, Clint took great joy in telling everyone the Bucky story and embarrassing the hell out of Steve (“Really, when you think about it, Steve was just jealous that his kid loves the step-dad more than him.”). But, while he hid his face in the crook of Tony’s neck amidst everyone’s laughter and Clint’s recollection of the shenanigans that Bucky got into in order to ruin Steve’s dates (the majority of which were not even made up), even when he grumbled as Tony’s laughter vibrated through his jaws, he could feel Tony’s warm hand drawing soothing circles on his thigh, and next to the other, Bucky lazily gnawed at his fingers, his flank pressing at Steve’s leg like a furnace, Steve could not help but smiled.
Then one day, as they were out on one of their late walks, walking so close to one another their paws kept on brushing one another, Ironteddy finally decided to act on his feelings.
He squinted at the teddy sitting on the table, he frowned and grimaced and looked at it all over. In the end, he flicked Ironteddy on the head and said,
“I agree, Man of Iron. I distinctly remember my brother spending a lot of time with our mother, and cannot help but suppose that had created the gap between him and my father and led to his downfall.”
There was a movement in the corner of Bruce’s eyes and he turned towards the bots just to see Dummy tentatively raising his crane towards EVE while making a quiet whistling sound. Butterfingers and U, who flanked his sides, were also reaching out to EVE, who at the moment looked completely perplexed.
While Tony started on another rant on the differences between scientific disciplines, Bruce took a quick glimpse at his team. For once Richards’ portal was not a bad thing and in an extremely rare case of event, everyone was actually happy (well, Tony was hyperventilating a little, but he usually did when he started talking science anyhow, and Steve was holding him, so Bruce wasn’t worried). It was rather heart-warming, even, seeing Tony’s robots and the WALL-E aliens getting along like a family. Which made Bruce think about his teammates and how much like a family they all were too. Which, for Bruce, who had spent so long running and hiding, was something precious and needed to be cherish.
And Steve turned to look incredulously at Tony, who grinned happily and spread his arms out in greeting towards Bucky, who took advantage of Steve’s distraction and loose grip, leaped forward into Tony’s arms and licked enthusiastically at his cheeks. If possible, his tail wagged even more furiously now.
Never would Steve think that he would have to fight Bucky for Tony. But, drastic time called for drastic measures. And so, one evening when they were in bed, with Tony working on his tablet, Steve reading a book with an arm around Tony’s waist and Bucky yet again snuggling along Tony’s right leg, as Bucky gave him a growl before snuggling closer to Tony, Steve glared at him and mouthed:
The fact that Ironteddy was still mobile today was only because of Obie and Mr Jarvis. Sometimes, he hated the fact that he was just a teddy bear and wished that he was a real life human, just so he could give Obie and Mr Jarvis a hug. But he could not. The only thing he could do was to greedily absorb all the love that they gave him, for it was the only thing that he ever knew.
Finally, his invention was completed. He put down the wrench and took a few steps back, admiring his creation. In a glance, it did not look like much more like a pile of scraps with bits of metal protruding out here and there. But, as Ironteddy flicked up a button at the back, the pile of metal shuddered and came to life. It spun and whistled softly and it moved its little claw up and down. Its viewfinder zoomed in and out and finally focused on Ironteddy.
Steve’s phone started ringing. Both of them ignored it, too engaged in the task of stripping one another.
(Bucky got back to his growling state after Steve was healed and attempted to go on dates with Tony alone again. Steve really started to consider putting Bucky in a box (labelled “Free for a good home. Must know first-aid” and leaving him under a bridge somewhere, but he knew that even if he left Bucky in wasteland Russia, there was a high chance that he would find his way home anyway. Plus, Bucky only had Tony’s best interest at heart which Steve had to be thankful for, although the scars on his shin tried to convince him otherwise.)
One of his earliest recollections was seeing her for the first time with one eye. She was in the middle of sewing his other eye and her face was no more than a silhouette, darkened by the bright light behind her head. He remembered the sting of the needle as it jabbed through his skin, yet it was not painful, for the threading was gentle and the hand cradling his head was warm. By the end, his vision was clear and he could see her completely. Ironteddy, then no more than a teddy bear head with pieces of his body scattered across the workstation, thought her the most beautiful person in the world. As she completed him piece by piece, he could feel her love for him growing, flowing into the empty space between his stuffing, making him feel heavy and full with love. It was a heady feeling and by the time she was done, he had never felt more alive.
“Hello, little one,” he greeted, as Ironteddy trekked up to his hut from where he left the Milano. The second time, Thanos was still imposingly large, the muscles of his arms still rolled with power, the Gauntlet firm in in left hand, one flick of his finger was enough to send Ironteddy flying. Yet, his demeanour had changed; he no longer seemed frightening and arrogant, just quiet and solemn, and he stretched out his hand as if to beckon Ironteddy over. Ironteddy knew that he was supposed to be scared still, yet somehow he was not, and so he approached him calmly, finally climbing into his hand.
(that was until WALL-E accidentally activated an Iron Man suit automatic mode, freaked out and had EVE fighting the suit, which against all odds actually lost to her.)
The plan seemed to work so far. Bucky docilely walked between them on the stroll, quietly lied on the dog bed they kept in Tony’s living room and had a grand time playing fetch with the bots in the corridor. He did not even faze when Steve pulled Tony away into the bedroom and closed the door. From inside the room they could hear Bucky’s nails clicking on the wooden floor and the whirring sound of the bots as they chased after him.
Obie lived in a mansion himself, although smaller than Mr and Mrs Stark’s, it was still massive. There was a Mr Newman who was like Mr Jarvis, just younger and harsher. There was no Mrs Obie, but unlike the Starks, Obie had a boy living with him who called him Uncle Obadiah. Ironteddy later learned that the boy’s parents had passed away and now he lived with Obie, his mother’s brother. The boy was called Edward and he was twelve. On the first day Ironteddy was brought there, Obie handed him and the bots to Edward and said,
They all ended up in the castle. Shuri, T’challa’s sister, was beyond grief when she heard of her brother’s demise. Rhodeybear was saddened upon hearing about his friend Falconteddy while Raccoon and Nebula huddled together on a couch away from the mass. Bruciebear worried his paws as he fidgeted next to Widowteddy, trading with her quick meaningful glances. Ironteddy stood by himself against a wall, not reacting to anyone around him. It suddenly dawned on him, that Rhodeybear did not know Strangeteddy. No one here cared for him or for Spideybear. No one knew of the love they shared, no one knew what they meant to Ironteddy. In the following wave of grief, they were already forgotten.
Then SHIELD fell and Captain got thrown off the Quinjet. When he was recovered, Widowteddy told him to leave the search for now, obviously Sergeant did not want to return just yet, and he relented begrudgingly.
Sudden motion from the foreign objects brought everyone out of their peaceful trance and back on high alert. Natasha tapped her fingers on to the handle of her blades and Clint drew his bow. Tony raised a hand with the repulsor on ready while Thor and Steve held onto their weapons of choice. Bruce, who was still in human form, awkwardly stood behind the group, unconsciously trying not to ruin the beautiful hero/heroine spread.
Mrs Stark brought Ironteddy to bed that night. She was an adult so she did not need to sleep with teddies, but that night she needed the comfort. She did not care whether Ironteddy became a success or not, she did not care how much money it would bring, she only saw the little creation as her perfect child, there was nothing else to improve on it and she loved it just the way it was.
On one such snowy days, Mr Jarvis came into the workshop while Ironteddy was trying his best to tighten a screw with a screwdriver. He froze when he saw Mr Jarvis came in, but Mr Jarvis just said, “I know”, and picked Ironteddy up and hugged him tight. Mr Jarvis, while always full of love, had never hugged him, it was a strangely nice feeling. Then Mr Jarvis brought him back to the toy room to the cheers of the robots, “I’ve been dusting and charging them in your absence,” and placed him among the shelves with the bots. Ironteddy did not quite know what was going on and was pretty annoyed, but as he was trying to climb down the shelf, he heard voices from the corridor, which scared him out of leaving. He sat still on the shelf with his bots, listening attentively to the cacophony of footsteps and voices on the other side of the door. He heard them moving towards the workshop and the sounds stayed in there for a long time. Then they emerged and moved down the corridor again, this time towards the toy room. Mr Jarvis opened the door, followed by a dozen people in black suit and white shirt, among whom was Obie. They looked around the room in a daze, their eyes gazing at shelves and shelves of inventions and toys with a mix of bewilderment and sadness. Then, snapped out from the trance, they moved around the room, picking up things and talking to each other in a murmur. Obie himself came towards Ironteddy and picked him up. He levelled him to his face and said to Ironteddy:
Then, Mr Stark got really drunk one night. It was after the launch of the new mobile phone, everyone had praised him to the sky on the new sleek device, much lighter and more functional than the previous model. All the while, as he accepted handshakes and clinked his wineglass with others, he was fully aware of whom the praises should be for and that gave him a bitter taste as the night dragged on. By the time he got home, he was completely inebriated, yet he still somehow found his way to the workshop. He barged into the shop to find Ironteddy looking at a framed photo on his shelf. A photo of him back in his war days, a rare snapshot of a much younger him holding the Captain teddy.
There were times when Bruce wondered whether living in the same state as the Fantastic Four was a good idea.
“Oh, forgot about them. WALL-E-verse bots, meet Dummy, Butterfingers and U. Kids, meet WALL-E and EVE, who are 90% actually WALL-E and EVE in that movie you’re all crazy for.”
DUMMY, with his rudimentary process power, could recognise and acknowledge Ironteddy as his creator. He was clumsy and naïve and more trouble than help as he bumped into various tidbits and cheerfully greeted every inanimate things he saw with funny chirps and beeps. Ironteddy had smuggled him from the workshop into the toy room as soon as he could, and since hardly anyone but Mr Jarvis came in there, there was minimal chance of DUMMY being found. DUMMY’s vocal tendency did help Ironteddy a lot too; the sound, while seemingly annoying, showed that DUMMY did care for him, even with his basic learning ability, and that to a teddy was no different from love. Ironteddy felt happy and warm next to him and they snuggled together in sleep, despite DUMMY’s pointy claws and cold metal case.
“Of course I love you, you idiot. Been in love with you for weeks now. Oh god, that was probably too soon wasn’t it…”
Ironteddy thought, and so he followed them through the portal, walking away from Pepper’s worried pleas. Back at the Sanctum, they told him all about the Infinity Stones and Thanos and how he was going to destroy the world.
“Guess it was a SHIELD thing after all”, Tony voiced his thoughts for him, albeit with a husky throaty voice that did nothing to stop his quest down south of his body.
), he drew the most beautiful sketches and he was kind to everyone. He readily soaked up all the sci-fi Ironteddy could show him and adored playing with the bots, who beeped at him excitedly whenever he stopped by. If Ironteddy thought that by getting to know the bear more, he would lose his magic, then he was sorely mistaken. Whenever he praised Captain’s drawings and received his shy smile, he found himself falling more and more in love.
Tony, who was captured and tortured for months in Afghanistan (and only now did Steve know the full story, since Tony was so sensitive about the scars on his chest he never really spoke at length about how those came to be), met Bucky when Erskine and him were also kidnapped by the Ten Rings. Why they decided to keep Bucky alive no one knew, but suffice to say the three of them grew pretty close in their captivity. When one of the guards shot Bucky’s leg for fun, Tony was the one who made him a metal leg after they had sawed the inflamed leg off. Bucky was the one who sneaked out and ran to the nearby US camp with a letter for help and led them back to the cave where Tony and Erskine were kept. During the scuffle, Erskine took a bullet that was meant for Tony and asked him to bring Bucky back to Iraq on his last breath. Tony, who had grown fond of Bucky, reluctantly arranged for Bucky’s flight back to Steve. Tony, who got used to calling Bucky ‘James’ after his best friend during their time in the cave, was in correspondence with General Phillips who kept him updated on Bucky up until his retirement with Steve.
One day, he woke up from a nap on the desk to Spideybear draping a blanket over him and reminding the bots to ‘let Dad sleep’. It made him feel warm with love for weeks.
Subtly, Thanos nodded, and Ironteddy felt a wave of relief. He leaned against the warm leather of Thanos’ shirt and let go.
Then one day, his battalion came to a village. The village was destroyed beyond repairs, houses blown up beyond recognition and their inhabitants long gone. As the soldiers rummaged through the debris for anything of use, Mr Stark came across a tattered teddy bear. It was a filthy torn thing, a dirty yellow bear, its stuffing half gone from a gaping hole on its back. The teddy was all by itself, trapped under a tree trunk, its owner, perhaps a little girl, was either dead or had already moved on. Mr Stark saw the little teddy and was at once rejoiced and despaired, for he remembered the long-lost peaceful childhood he once had, in a land that was so far away; yet, it also reminded him of his dreams back then, the burning desire to make something of use to mankind. The bear gave him an elated sense of joy, of pure sadness yet of hope. This single tattered bear, mangled and caked with dirt, was his saviour. And so Mr Stark took the bear with him and stuffed it in his backpack. At night, when they had settled down for the night, Mr Stark took pieces of cloths that he could find and patched up the bear with all the skills his mother once taught him. When they passed by a bombed town hall, he used the torn French flag to make a shirt and pants and helmet for the bear. When he found a fancy torn coat in an abandoned tailor’s shop, he took one of the big buttons and painted a shield on it. He called the teddy bear Captain and at night he held the teddy tight in his sleep. His comrades initially made fun of him, but then, when dark times came and there was nowhere to hide from the monsters in their heads, Mr Stark would lend them Captain and the bear would share with them its magic, would give them a bit of joy and hope, a bit of home, a bit of tomorrow. Captain became famous around the camp and eventually was known to all as a beacon of hope. Later, Mr Stark found another tattered bear in another village, a brown bear with an arm missing. Mr Stark took the bear along as well and eventually used some grey cloth to make the teddy a new arm. The new teddy, known as Sergeant, was now Captain’s companion as the battalion slowly made their way through the plains of Europe, chasing after the enemy’s backs.
“Well, now that you talk about it,” Bruce started, mind already listing out what rules of biology to break (as if biology follows rules at all) and how he could go about to achieve that “there was this fascinating paper just last month…“
Of course, the moment Bucky heard Tony’s car at the front, he proceeded to bark the whole neighbourhood down. No amount of shushing or scolding could quiet him down, so Steve resigned and let him in. Bucky gave him a glare when he trotted in, as if he knew exactly what Steve had in mind, then stayed plastered to Steve’s feet when he went to get the door. Steve put him on the leash just in case, with the other end firmly looped through his hand, hoping that at least if Bucky reacted violently he would be able to hold him back as Tony ran for his life. When Steve opened the door and Bucky made eye contact with Tony for the very first time, it was probably the longest five seconds of his life.
Instead, there was now Visionteddy, a patchwork teddy in green and yellow and red, with a billowing cape and a shiny gem on his forehead. Visionteddy looked more alien than Thorteddy and he glided above the ground as he moved. Yet, he sounded like JARVIS, his manner of speech resembled JARVIS’, he had JARVIS’ memories, all the ones that JARVIS had experienced during his lifetime. Logically, Ironteddy knew that Visionteddy was not JARVIS, yet his every being refused to acknowledge this and he caught himself almost asking for JARVIS as he rummaged through the ruins of his home.
And so it went for a few years. When Edward was home from school, Ironteddy sat motionlessly on the bookshelf as the boy did his homework and played with the bots and Gameboy and computer. When Edward fell asleep, Ironteddy would climb down from the shelf to cuddle the bots and taught them how to avoid bumping into Edward’s socks on the floor. When Edward was at school, Ironteddy would quietly log into his computer and learn things on the internet. That was how he learned that the Starks had passed away in a car accident, that the Stark mansion had been sold, that Stark Industries was now Stane Industries and that they dealt with weapon manufacturing now. Distantly, Ironteddy recalled drawing blueprints for missiles and guns and planes when he was still in the workshop, a vague concept to a teddy bear who had no use for such things. Obie must have found the designs and started to manufacture them.
Steve finally manned up and asked Tony out on a date at the New Year party (turned out Bruce won the pot). On the first date, he took Tony to his favourite Italian restaurant in Queens and learned that Tony spoke fluently sinful Italian. On the second date, he took Tony ice skating and realised how adorably red Tony’s nose was when he tried to smother his face in thick layers of fleece and knitted beanie. On the third date, Tony showed him his penthouse and workshop and JARVIS and the bots, and Steve pushed Tony against the elevator wall and left a constellation of love bites on his neck.
Once upon a time there was a famous toymaker named Mr Stark. He lived in a beautiful mansion with his beautiful wife Mrs Stark and together they owned the biggest and most successful toy company in America. Mr Stark, an innovative engineer with endless imaginations for the unthinkable, designed all sorts of fascinating toys for young bright minds. Mrs Stark, however, loved small, sweet things and, with her dextrous hands, sewed and knitted and embroidered the most intricately detailed and beautiful toys. As the demand for their wonderful toys rose and rose, Mrs Stark no longer personally sewed all of the dolls by hand and Mr Stark no longer crafted hexagonal puzzle cubes himself. They had a factory with workers who realised their dreams and made them come true. However, Mr Stark still designed most of the toys and Mrs Stark still made soft toy prototypes before they went into production.
The days followed, Mr Stark added a new routine to his insults. “If only you were Captain.” “Captain would have figured this long ago.” “You would never be as good as Captain.” Variations of these went on and on, and soon enough Ironteddy knew without a doubt in his heart that he was never going to be as good as Captain. That was the reason for all the insults, the threats, the times that a frustrated Mr Stark would toss him across the room, the times when he shook him so hard his stitches threatened to loosen. That was why he was no longer loved by Mr Stark. Ironteddy did not know that Mr Stark could no longer love him because of his own incompetence, because he was humiliated and shamed. Ironteddy was never to know.
Then, on one of the nights he spent wandering and exploring in Mr Stark’s workshop, he found his own blueprint in a portfolio. And it was truly his blueprint, from the bold letters IRONTEDDY on top, to the smallest details of his mask and repulsors, they were all there. Signed at the bottom of the blueprint was Mr Stark’s signature.
Steve missed having Tony’s warmth plastered on his side and he was starting to get very frustrated by Bucky’s antics. He was sure that Bucky knew exactly what he was doing and that was to keep Steve away from Tony.
It was probably the promise, or the look of anguish and determination in Steve’s eyes, or the fact that he was badly injured and could barely walk, but Bucky relented. His growl turned into a whine and he nuzzled Steve’s knee, letting him pet his head and ears. He pushed his snout into Steve’s hand and dropped the bloody chip into it, asking for a promise that Steve repeated like his life depended on it.
Ironteddy almost did not want to come back. He dreaded finding out who had perished, who had survived. He found himself wondering about Captain, then quickly chastised himself for asking so. The Milano landed on the grassy field outside of the Wakandan capital in the middle of what seemed to be a battlefield. From afar, Ironteddy saw some of the old Avengerteddies, Bruciebear and Rhodeybear and Widowbear stumbling around in a daze. And there was Captain.
Unlike Mr Stark, Obie did not dig deeper into Ironteddy’s secrets. He held Ironteddy in his arms as he held on and his body trembled with foreign emotions, he did not ask how or why Ironteddy could move. He only smoothed the ruffled yarn on his back with his large hand and waited for Ironteddy to calm down. Then, when Ironteddy no longer shook like leaf, he turned him around to face the screen full of calculations and numbers. Ironteddy, one paw still gripping Obie’s shirt, started to type on the keyboard with his free paw.
“Oh my god, Bucky’s home?! Oh thank goodness, Angie, Bucky’s gone back to Steve’s, can you please let the police know that he–“
Following the New York aftermath, the Avengerteddies all came to live in the Stark Tower with Ironteddy. Their relationship, though tentative at first, slowly grew as they became more comfortable with one another. Ironteddy particularly liked spending time with Captain, a teddy out of time, full of mysteries. How Captain had managed to survive all those years was still a big unknown. Some said that he was picked up and loved by someone during this time, even though Captain had no memories of this. Ironteddy knew better though. He knew that Mr Stark’s love was enough to sustain Captain through seventy years, even though Mr Stark himself had passed away two decades ago. And it was well-justified, too, for Mr Stark had not exaggerated and Captain was indeed the perfect teddy bear. He was handsome and wholesome, rugged yet soft, charming yet disciplined. A wonderful companion to a soldier, yet was perfect to offer comfort.
“Hey Cap, I did not educate you on the lore of Star Wars for you to go shoot my dream down like that. By the way guys, am I the only one who’s creeped out by how bizarrely correct the Pixar movie made them? I mean, they look exactly like the movie characters! This just further proves the Disney conspiracy that I’ve been saying all these years! I bet Disney has its own space team who goes to various alternative universes to steal ideas for their next franchise!”
It was impossibly easy. Tony, the wild unpredictable creature that he was, had a widely known weakness – his love for coffee. Namely, coffee from a shop opposite of Stark Tower which he swore was the best he had ever had. So, it was only a matter of time before someone took notice, planted a smoke bomb and scurried him away in the chaos. By the time the smoke was cleared and people realised that Tony was gone, he was already halfway through the States.
In Ironteddy’s wildest dreams never would he even imagine that a day would come when Mr Stark would step a foot into the toy room. Such a thing had never happened and it was so far removed from Ironteddy’s imagination that it did not even occur to him. Maybe that was why he was careless. It was night time and the household had gone to sleep, that was when Ironteddy usually turned on DUMMY and Butterfingers and U and let them roam around the shelves, their adhesive caterpillar tracks allowing them to go from shelf to shelf without falling. Ironteddy was scribbling a new design on a piece of scrap paper that he took from the workshop, only paying half-attention to the whistles and soft whirring from the robots. When Ironteddy was in an inventing binge, he hardly paid attention to much else, which was why he never heard the door creaking open, never heard the bots’ excited greetings to the strange man standing at the door, gaping at the sight of three robots clinging to his trophy shelves and a teddy bear writing calculations on the windowsill. Ironteddy did not hear the man walking in disbelief into the room, did not feel his warm breath on his back as he loomed over and looked at the blueprint, did not hear his gasp as his eyes traced the numbers. But, all of the sudden, Ironteddy felt a rush of love that made him gape and stop his writing. It was a heady, unfamiliar feeling, unlike the enduring love from Mr Jarvis, the burst of warmth from Obie, or even the soft whisper of love like Mrs Stark that one time. This was like a hurricane, a flood of excitement, of pride, the thing he had longed for all his life but had never once felt. It was heady, it was amazing, and when Ironteddy looked up, he saw Mr Stark’s smile illuminated under the moonlight, a scene that would henceforth carved itself into his memory fibres until eternity.
“Aww, look at how cute they all are. See Stark, no need to be all protective-mommy on them. They were just making friends.”
“Cut with the pretty words, Richards, we all know what happened.” Tony jumped in in the middle of Richards’ attempt to deflect. “What happened was basically you guys screwing up one of the quote-uncontrollable variables-unquote, telling yourself to hell with it and continuing anyway because apparently what’s the worst that can happen, and now we’ve got a nice old alternate-universe portal occupying half of Bruce’s lab.”
Ironteddy realised that he was in love when one evening, he suddenly woke up and found himself in the common room after a movie night. All the other teddies were in various state of sleep across the couches and sofas, leaning against pillows and burying in thick blankets. Ironteddy himself was leaning against Captain who had obligingly let him sleep on his legs. The end credit of the movie ran silently in the background and the light from the screen lit up the sharp details of Captain, the peaceful look on his face as he slept, his soft hair and round ears. Ironteddy felt a sudden bloom in his chest, a blaze of fire, seemingly consuming him whole.
Things happened in a flash. Peggy Carter died and Captain flew away for her funeral, sitting solemnly in the lap of Peggy’s niece, her dainty white hands holding onto him as he stared motionless at the wooden coffin. Then, a bomb blew up in Vienna and more people died. In the chaos that followed, it looked like Sergeant, Captain’s old pal, was the one to set the bomb up. News followed that the King of Wakanda, the only teddy cat-ruled nation in the world, was destroyed in the disaster, and that T’challa, his son, had taken up the Panther title and was on the hunt for Sergeant. Sergeant and Captain were on the run, they were caught; Sergeant’s assassin alter-ego was activated, the two of them escaped. Then Ironteddy found a tiny teddy named Spideybear who could shoot web like a spider and Hawkteddy found someone called Antteddy who could shrink to the size of an ant, and it all culminated at a German airport. Ironteddy asked Captain to stand down, once again. But it was all for nought, and a battle broke out. In the confusion that followed, they got away and Rhodeybear fell down and down.
Somehow, love crept in between them. Unlike the love he had for Captain that burned bright with passion, this was a quiet, gentle thing, like calm waves lapping at his legs when Pepper took him to Malibu for the first time. Ironteddy, no longer a stranger to the feeling, tried to shut it out as a habit and pretended it was not there, in fear that Strangeteddy would find out. He found out anyway, for on one of those endless nights he draped an arm over Ironteddy in a half-embrace as his cloak covered the both of them in a warm cocoon.
“I cannot help you, little one. The ones you love are gone forever. The Gauntlet is fair, it does not decide whom to kill. Just so happen that it was your beloved who were chosen.”
The next time he was aware of anything, Bucky was sitting in front of him, his right paw placed on his thigh, big soulful eyes looking straight into his soul. Steve ignored everyone else around him and slid down onto the floor, hugging Bucky and sobbing into his warm matted fur, feeling Bucky’s rumble travelling through his body into Steve’s chest, absorbing and sharing the agony of the one other being who also loved Tony that much, his brother who knew his pain inside and out.
In the background Tony made a whimpering sound. Bruce imagined he could hear Steve’s other hand tightening on his shield.
Perhaps it was because Ironteddy made Rhodeybear himself, for they just clicked automatically. They were fast friends the moment Rhodeybear became conscious and they seemed to understand each other without a problem. Ironteddy already loved Rhodeybear, had done so since he made his first stitch, and it was not long before Rhodeybear loved him in return. A mutual love between them kept them alive and Ironteddy had never been happier than he was before. They talked and joked and played pranks on each other, they chased the bots around like puppies, they told each other stories and cuddled together in sleep. Obie, once found out, could not even fault Ironteddy, for Rhodeybear was perfect, the perfect friend for a teddy bear. Obie did try to market Rhodeybear, but Ironteddy stopped him in time. It was selfish of him, he knew, wanting to keep Rhodeybear all to himself. But Obie relented easily enough anyway upon promises of more inventions in the near future.
“Um, guys,” Bruce said after a couple of minutes of Avengers-looking-like-an-upset-school-principal and Fantastic-Four-looking-like-teenagers-caught-smoking, “what are we going to do about this thing?”
Standing in front of him was Obie, who stared at the teddy in mid-motion with the most astonished look in his eyes.
When Steve was about three steps away from the bots, he crouched down onto their level, as if trying not to spook a pair of frightened alley cats. There was a flash of uncertainty on his face, but Steve is nothing but a determined man.
To be fair, he did not know that it was Captain standing next to him at that moment. It was a bit chaotic all around and Ironteddy was a bit busy fighting an alien teddy in green to pay more attention. But then, when they had caught Lokiteddy and had settled down on the Quinjet, Ironteddy realised,
They all blamed him for the destruction of Sokovia. They blamed him for creating Ultron, for playing god, for being reckless. The new teddy bear that joined them, a teddy who could use magic named Scarletteddy, blamed him for her family’s demise. Hawkteddy did not even look at him. Widowteddy patted him on the shoulders like she sympathised, but it just felt wrong. Hulkteddy and Thorteddy were gone, running off to who-knew-where. Visionteddy, confused by the events and conflicted by JARVIS’ memories, opted to stay with the others. Captain just shook his head and accepted his resignation, but he did not ask him to stay.
It broke Steve’s heart to know how insecure Tony was still in their relationship, despite the fact that he should be the insecure one, next to someone as brilliant as Tony. He wasted no time in settling things straight with Tony, but it still took Tony days before he believed that Steve was telling the truth.
On Earth, Captain suddenly woke up from a long nightmare. He turned around and laid his eyes on Sergeant who was lying next to him, sleeping soundly without a single clue.
At the end of the inventing binge, they had made so many new inventions, not only just toys, but engines and equipment and everything. They made a great team, too. Ironteddy designed while Mr Stark used the tools to make the design come true, with Ironteddy helping out whenever he could. Mr Stark had looked at him with so much pride by the end Ironteddy did not know what to do with it. It was a strange feeling indeed.
He could still feel Spideybear gripping at his shoulders, his quick breath, his begging eyes. He could still see Strangeteddy’s blue eyes as it burned into his, silently asking for forgiveness, for love, for everything. Distantly, he remembered seeing the Guardians disappearing as well, yet it did not register to him what had happened. He just sat there where Spideybear used to be, his paws full of ash as he watched what remained of his beloved blow away.
Bucky ended up staying with them for the rest of the week. Tony got them a beach house down in Côte d'Azur and Bucky once again claimed his spot next to Tony on the bed. At least they had a few days to themselves, Steve thought miserably, but then Bucky growled at them when he unconsciously pushed Tony down onto the folded chair in a moment of passion and Steve once more vowed to resolve the Bucky problem before he died from frustration.
“We’d better bring him inside before the neighbours think that one of us kills the other and call the cops. Again.”
The best thing that came out of this was that Rhodeybear could now go outside in broad daylight without fear. Every time he stepped out, he was treated like a celebrity, people dogging his steps and watching what a teddy would do for the day, they asked for his photos and signatures like he was a superstar. The few times that Rhodeybear could convince Ironteddy to come with them, the crowd went even wilder, so Ironteddy eventually opted to stay inside away from the mass. Gradually, Rhodeybear got bored of cruising the town with no purpose in mind and the people no longer followed him around as the sight had lost its novelty. One day, Rhodeybear came to Ironteddy and told him that he would like to join the Army. Turned out, he had come across a barrack and ventured inside and had long talks with the soldiers stationed there, had toured the place and had found meaning in what they did.
Obie sat and read as Ironteddy scrolled through the documents, making notes along the way in an attempt to explain to Obie what he meant to do. He then opened older documents containing older designs, of mechanical trains and automated machinery and sleek phones and an idea called ‘Bluetooth’. When Ironteddy finally tired himself out, he turned to look at Obie, not entirely sure what he was expecting. Mr Stark had seemed very proud at the beginning, he remembered, but he was not so proud afterwards and more upset than happy.
Like you and me, teddy bears could walk and dance and love and cry. No one had ever seen a teddy bear walk, however, for they hid it very well. Teddies knew that once humans knew that they were alive, they would no longer love them, they would become something abnormal, something incomprehensible, and that would be unacceptable. That was because teddies lived on love, they fed on the love that others unconditionally gave them, their joyful burst of energy and their happiness all came from this. Once a teddy was no longer loved, it died and left behind a teddy carcass, under human eyes seemingly no different from any other teddies, but other teddies could feel that it was no longer there, a lifeless loveless body. For centuries and centuries, ever since the first teddy was stitched together from patches of cloth, that was the way it had always been. No one knew when teddy bears became alive, no one knew how, no one knew why. Teddies did not question it either, for them there was only one ultimate truth:
As Tony droned on about Disney’s universe-jumping, much to the eye-rolling from Natasha and Bruce (and the fond look from Steve), WALL-E and EVE had managed to escape the team’s attention and had started to wander around Tony’s workshop where they had relocated them (simply because Tony knew more about what he was doing with robots than Bruce). Bruce tried to keep an eye on them, less because he deemed them dangerous (not really, if the Pixar movie was to be believed, but of course Bruce wondered how accurate it actually was as well) and more because Tony’s workshop was a constant hazard zone with too many things that could suddenly go boom or catch fire. So far the Pixar bots were doing all right, just curiously poking (WALL-E) and scanning (EVE) various objects on Tony’s benches. Once WALL-E seemed close to putting a torch into his torso compartment, but a glare from Bruce stopped him in his track.
The second time, Rhodeybear brought back an old newspaper. Ironteddy could read news on the internet, but he had never seen a newspaper in real life before and they spent the night gorging on the smell of ink and the feeling of crisp paper in their paws.
He was in one of his design binge again. He was missing Mr Jarvis something fierce that day and just wanted to see him again. Yet, alas, he could not. But, like all the problems that Ironteddy had encountered, if he could not do something, he invented something to compensate for it. And he had come up with this brilliant idea of making an AI that would be just like Mr Jarvis. So he started to write formulas and formulas for the AI, writing furiously on the keyboard. He was so absorbed in the task, he could not hear the door creaking open, or the bots sudden rapid chirpings in warning, or the shadow of a man standing behind him. Suddenly, his chair was spun around and his paws were ripped from the keyboard.
The thing was, he could not even discuss it with Tony. Despite all that happened, Tony still adored Bucky. Sure, after Steve’s attack he was more wary of him, but since Bucky was always such an angel around him, he charted it down to a singular incident in which Bucky was meant to feel threatened anyway. Plus, prior to their meeting Steve had scared him a lot about how terrible Bucky was with other people, so for Bucky to regard him as family was just too good to be true. They also had an intense history together, one that left permanent scars on both of them but also brought them together and even Steve could not question it.
And Mr Stark went on to tell Ironteddy all about Captain, how he was found and repaired, all the adventures they went on together, how he had comforted Mr Stark through it all, how devastated his loss was to him, how perfect of a teddy he was. How Ironteddy was a failed attempt to recreate Captain, how nothing could measure up to him. Mr Stark rambled on and on and kept on repeating, “You’d never be good enough.” At the end, Mr Stark finally fell asleep at the desk, clinging to the framed yellowed photograph like it was his lifeline.
There were a lot of shooting on Sergeant’s side and screaming on Captain’s. Ironteddy tried to help, he raised an arm up, aiming the repulsor at Sergeant, but Captain only glared at him and raised an arm out to block his paw from Sergeant. Then, a bullet grazed Captain’s left ear and they remembered that there was an infamous assassin standing in front of them. Sergeant dashed forward and slammed into Ironteddy, knocking him aside and he fell into a fountain nearby. By the time he was out of the water, Sergeant had abandoned his gun and was trading blows with Captain, who was on the defensive and never once tried to attack. Their movements were so fast Ironteddy could not aim at Sergeant without avoiding Captain, and so he asked JARVIS to contact the other Avengerteddies, all the while keeping an eye on the dueling pair. In no time, they heard the hissing sound of the Quinjet engine and Sergeant, after a second’s thought, abandoned the fight and ran into the bushes. Captain was primed to run after him, but he was also somewhat tattered after the fight and Ironteddy held him back, silently begging him to leave it.
So, he bit the bullet and looked on as the loves of his life getting closer to each other and felt colder by the days.
When he opened the door to a dingy cell and saw Tony chained to the wall, face a giant blooming bruise and torso painted with long slashes, the rage roared back to life. It was only by cradling Tony close in his arms and inhaling the faint scent of his hair that the furious monster in him died down to an ember. He could feel his face wet with tears, either from pain or relief, and could feel Tony wiping a bloodstained hand on his cheek, soothing him with quiet whispers, as if he was the one captured and tormented. He did not let go of Tony’s hand when the medics finally came and took him out on a stretcher. He stayed still like stone outside of the operation theatre when Tony was in surgery, was not aware of doctors and nurses rushing around him or his friends who came and sat with him.
Logically, he knew that it was Mrs Stark’s hands that made him, but Mr Stane, or Obie as he had taken to call him, must have been his designer. For why else would he be so happy and proud every time he saw Ironteddy? Ironteddy was aware that for humans, he was no different from an inanimate object, a stuffed toy for decorative purpose in a house full of grown-ups, yet every time Obie came for a visit, he would surely stop by the toy room and give Ironteddy a pat on the head. And, while Ironteddy might not understand all human emotions, he knew enough to recognise Obie as being sincere, that he was not just being nice because Mr Jarvis or Mrs Stark asked him to. The love from Obie, while not as strong as that from Mr Jarvis, was a real thing, and that built up in Ironteddy as well, a thing that he truly treasured.
(“–and I did not want you to come over because I was afraid my dog would maul you down, and I love you too much to let that happen!”
Really, with this much similarity to the movie, Bruce was very tempted to believe in Tony’s conspiracy theory.
Johannesburg hardly registered in Ironteddy’s mind. When the disaster happened there, he was getting ready for a presentation at MIT. He put on the BARF glasses and showed the world for the first time a memory as registered by a teddy bear, he showed them Mr and Mrs Stark on the day before they were gone forever. When he got out of the lecture hall, a woman told him that he was responsible for her son’s death, that he was the opposite of what a teddy bear should be, the opposite of reassurance and comfort. He came home with guilt and heavy thoughts swimming in his head. At the same time, Nigeria burned.
And Steve really, really, really wanted to continue to follow Tony’s happy trail, but the responsible part of his brain told him that SHIELD would never call unless it was something urgent, also it was always a bad idea to miss a call from Natasha and he very much would like to avoid being castrated by her the next time they met.
Things went so well, Steve was thinking of taking his vacation leave now and extending the France trip. Tony seemed amenable to the suggestion and talked about going south to Cannes, maybe Monaco, while Steve drew Tony’s face as it was illuminated under the Eiffel.
Visionteddy found Ironteddy buried under the snow, his face half-torn and his arc reactor no longer shining. Captain’s shield laid at his feet, abandoned. Later, as Dr Cho stitched up Ironteddy’s face and Pepper watched on worriedly, Ironteddy told himself,
Then he stormed away into his workshop, muttering about the perfect teddy bear, leaving Ironteddy lying on its side on the table with an arm still reaching out, as if begging Mr Stark to come back.
But then, three months passed by and he realised that he had not spent a single moment alone with Tony.
The Rogueteddies, or so the media proclaimed, were still not back to America. Last anyone saw them, they were in Scotland, or somewhere European. The Accords were not in place still since there were hardly any superteddies left, but still there were talks of it every now and then. Rhodeybear was more than capable of walking and running and jumping again, courtesy of the brace Ironteddy had made for him. Visionteddy had been learning the world and had helped a lot with getting Rhodeybear back on his feet, but he came to Ironteddy a few weeks ago, asking to be away for a while, then dropped off the radar. Ironteddy himself, now ground-bound, still designed for Stark Industries. He made many new inventions and Spideybear dropped by every few days to science with him or just to hang out with the robots. It was quiet and peaceful and in a way should be all he ever wanted. Yet Ironteddy could never forget the horror he saw in space, the giant spaceship, the darkening purple sky, the air thick with the threat to come. He knew in his fibre that it was only a matter of time before it finally came to Earth.
The next few days were utter bliss. Tony went to his meetings and tried to appear as if he was interested while Pepper passive-aggressively shot down their potential business partners’ attempt at passing some pathetically hidden clauses. Steve went to Fresnes and interrogated a bunch of what turned out to be ex-HYDRA shrimps. In the evening, they went strolling down the Seine and had dinner at swanky restaurants and kissed under the starry sky. He learned that Tony had the most sinful French accent (also because he only knew the dirty phrases) and rediscovered how gorgeous Tony was on top of him, riding him into the mattress with head thrown back and loud moans and breathy whimpers. Afterwards, Tony tucked himself underneath Steve’s arm and snuggled into his chest as Steve played with Tony’s soft locks without worrying that there was a giant dog glaring at him and flanking Tony’s other side.
He asked Sam to come over to stay with Bucky (Sam poked his ribs and waggled his eyebrows a whole lot and told Steve that Bucky was a dog from hell, but agreed to come anyway since he secretly liked to cuddle with him, the menace) and whisked Tony off for a night in town, burgers and milkshakes as Tony gesticulated a lot between bites, excited by a new line of Starkphone, while Steve dopeyly smiled at him and fed him bits of fries between sentences. They went to a bar that played live jazz where Steve took advantage of the low lights and nosed at Tony’s hair while they slowly swayed to the music. By the time they got back to the Tower, both were sufficiently feeling frisky and Steve wasted no time to pin Tony against the bedroom door, eager to tear off his shirt to get to the warm skin underneath.
One of the alien objects, which Bruce did not feel inclined to name before he knew more about their origins, started to shake quite violently. From Bruce’s vantage point, it looked nothing more than a pile of mechanical parts, with two caterpillar tracks on top of its cube-shaped rusty body. Which was quite peculiar and impractical, seeing that the tracks would make for a much better movement system. Then, with a whirr, the object suddenly flipped on itself and planted its tracks firmly onto the ground (… or, that was exactly what they were for). Then it was completely still. The other alien-thing was rice grain-like, all shiny and white with a black screen at the front and hovered about a foot from the ground.
Of course, as soon as the misunderstanding cleared up, Tony was back on his mission to infiltrate Steve’s house, only this time, Steve had no more reasons to refuse him. He tried telling Tony horror stories involving Bucky and his failed attempts of dating (with Natasha backing as proof), but Tony just beamed his large brown eyes at him and wobbled his lips, and while it looked fake as hell, Steve was still not immune to its effects.
After a couple minutes when nobody moved, Dummy let out the robot’s equivalent of a whimper (he really was Tony’s creation wasn’t he?) and tried to touch EVE again. This time, EVE let him tap his claw gently on her body. Slowly, the other bots joined in, circling around her and poking at her curiously but carefully. A few minutes later, they realised that WALL-E had peeped his eyes out of his metal body. The bots started to make excited chirpy sounds and WALL-E, spooked, scooted a bit further under the bench. Seeing this, the bots were obviously dejected and emitted a soft distressing noise, which prompted EVE to make a shushing sound of her own. She then lowered her arm under the bench towards WALL-E and called his name. WALL-E, after a long look at EVE, hesitantly took a hold of her appendage with his claw and rolled out into the open.
The next day, photos of Rhodeybear was everywhere on the front of newspapers. Journalists swarmed at the gate of the mansion, yelling for Obie, for Edward, for anyone they could see through the drawn curtains. Obie barged into the workshop that morning, face red with fury and foaming at the mouth, demanding an explanation from them. Ironteddy had never been more terrified. With shaking paws, they tried to explain what happened to Obie. Obie listened to them and paced around the workshop with quick stamping steps, brows drawn together and face scrunched in thought.
Learning from his old mistakes, Steve had everything planned out perfectly. No more big gestures this time, they would just stay in and have homemade dinner, rustic and quiet. Steve had the roast in the oven and panna cotta chilled in the fridge. After dinner, Steve would turn on some music and he could give Tony a foot massage afterwards, since Tony was always a fan of Steve’s massage. And then, once he had Tony all soft and pliant, he would carry Tony to bed and worship his body like he was meant to do. And most importantly, Bucky would be out of the house. Peggy and her wife Angie were in New York for a few weeks and were happy to let Bucky stay with them for the night (well, Angie, who missed Bucky dearly, was, while Peggy just looked at his desperate face and smirked like she knew exactly why he asked them). It would just be the two of them at home, both phones turned off for no distraction. Tony was pleasantly surprised when he saw the neatly set dinner table, complete with candles and flowers, and decided to reward him so generously he could still feel the phantom of Tony’s mouth on his dick hours later. The plan went smoothly and soon enough, he had Tony spread out like a feast on the bed, legs opened and caging Steve’s waist, three of his fingers deep inside Tony as he played with Tony’s nipples with his tongue.
Rhodeybear hugged him and told him he would stay with him, but Ironteddy just shook his head. The Avengerteddies needed a heavy-hitter on the team, now that Hulkteddy and Thorteddy and Ironteddy were gone. They needed Rhodeybear with them. Besides, he could always come for a visit.
Fifteen hours later when they piled into Tony’s IC room, Steve went and sat by Tony’s bed, holding a thin hand in his and placed his head down on the bed, consciousness quickly fading from exhaustion. He saw in the corner of his gritty eyes, Bucky standing on the other side of Tony’s head, nosing at Tony’s other hand and whined when Tony did not pet him like usual. When Steve woke up, Tony was still unconscious, the only sounds in the room were the constant beeping of the monitors and Bucky’s quiet snore as he laid at Steve’s chair, his head pillowed on Steve’s feet, warm like a blanket.
Mr Stark did not inherit the toy factory from his family; rather, he built it from the ground. Years ago, he was in the Army across the ocean fighting a seemingly endless war. He was shipped out when he was barely a man grown, like other boys his age, too old to be a child still yet too young to anticipate the horrors of war. Mr Stark, once dreamed of being an engineer, of making fast planes and big bombs, had to put his books and tools away and swung a rifle over his shoulder. War zone was no place for dreams. Mr Stark saw around him villages burning to the ground, heard his comrades' anguished cries as they bled on dark foreign soil. He felt fire on his skin and smelled rotten flesh as they marched through bloody battlefields. It was enough horror to traumatise a man over and over and Mr Stark was no exception. As the moon waxed and waned, as the clouds in the sky rolled with storm, as the screeching sound of bomber planes screamed down at him, Mr Stark fell into great despair.
