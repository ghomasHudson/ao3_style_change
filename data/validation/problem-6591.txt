Tony steps out of the room, not surprised to find Happy still guarding his post. Tony rolls his eyes.
It’s evident that Morgan missed him more than he missed her. She stares up at his smiling face with her rich, brown eyes, and reaches up with one tiny hand to explore Steve’s cheek. Steve leans into her touch, his smile growing brighter. More tears begin to spill from his eyes and roll down his face, but even that’s not enough to force Morgan’s hand away.
“What? Made up? Like I did it for money? I didn’t even know you, Tony! I knew nothing about you. I was ready to raise this baby alone before you showed up.”
Steve frowns when he realizes what Tony is referring to. “I already told you. It’s probably sympathy-”
His lab was always a distraction, his go to when he couldn’t wrap his mind around the curves life threw at him. He had Bruce to work alongside him. Sometimes they wouldn’t emerge for hours, and though some might say it was an issue, for Tony it was his time to focus on something else.
“Don’t worry about it.” Tony waves a dismissive hand and steps into the bathroom. He makes himself comfortable on the closed lid of the toilet. “How is he?”
Peter was going to have to do everything, and judging by the looks of it, he would be doing it alone.
Tears burn his eyes and he wipes at them angrily when they fall. His hormones were all over the place; every day it seemed like they were getting worse. This was all supposed to be normal, but Steve couldn’t believe that either.
It’s not long before he’s gathered what he wants to keep and items he feels content parting with. He gives up after a while and decides to join his aunt and uncle back in the living room.
By some miracle Peter makes it through the day. And by some other miracle, Flash doesn’t go looking for him. It’s both relieving and frightening all at the same time.
Steve whimpers when Tony gently helps him out of his ruined sweatpants. Tony bunches them up and tosses them in the corner of the room. The rest of the room goes ignored; Steve needs to be taken care of first.
“Hi,” Steve coos softly. Their eyes meet for the first time and Steve’s heart flutters with love and joy for the little boy in his arms. “You’re here. You’re finally here.”
“That is not something you need right now! Dammit, Steve, you’re just giving up. Why? Why now are you giving up? That’s not you!”
It’s Tony’s turn to wrap her in a hug. He holds her for a moment before letting go and placing both hands over her shoulders. “I screwed up, and I’m so so sorry. I let work and Pete’s training get in the way. I do want to hear about your day and I do want to help with science projects. I promised myself that I’d be a better father than the one I had and I blew it.”
Peter grimaces. That’s all he finds himself focusing on. Just once he’d like to have a moment to think about anything else. Just weeks before he was thinking about hanging out with Ned or the old computer he found lying around in a back alley. Now his thoughts have been tainted. His life was different now.
“You don’t know how happy I am, Steve.” Tony reaches across the table to take Steve’s hand, brushing his thumb over the wedding band he had put there two years ago. “You and Morgan mean everything to me. I can’t live without you.”
The last thing Tony expected was for Steve to want to try again. He had been sure that the loss of their son would’ve been enough to convince Steve that a baby just wasn’t going to happen. But he was wrong.
A small smile forms over Steve’s face at those words. He remembers that day and how scared and unsure he had been. He didn’t think he would’ve made it into the city and away from his abuser. He never thought in a million years that he’d run into the alpha that sired his pup.
Steve allows Tony to remove the article of clothing. His breath hitches when Tony leans forward and kisses along his neck, marking up the skin like he used to. Tony’s hand runs up the front of Steve’s shirt, exploring the soft flesh. Steve can’t help but tense up when that same hand skirts across his belly.
Morgan nods her head and Peter comes over to give her a hug. Morgan accepts the embrace. She can’t even remember the last time they hugged like this.
Peter huffs out a small laugh. “Sounds like him. But why did you keep me if you were so scared? I’m just a burden.”
“Are you alright?” Bruce is looking at him with furrowed brows. Steve waves him off again but it’s obvious the doctor isn’t buying it. “Do you want me to look you over? Maybe Jarvis can-”
“Okay,” Peter nods and he follows his dad to the door and grabs his backpack. “You don’t have to drive me. I can...swing.”
I’m feeling okay today so I got a chapter completed. It’s not very long and apologize. My brain is giving out ugh.
A choked sob escapes him at the thought. The pain was still fresh and appeared like it wasn’t going away anytime soon. It probably never would. It would always be there.
When Peter decides to venture out of the guest room, he’s greeted with silence. He pokes his head out of the room and into the hall, expecting to hear some kind of activity, but he’s left with only more silence.
“I did. He was going to release this drug into the air, one that could only affect omegas. It would brainwash them, making them easier to control and manipulate. His first target was New York. I hijacked his plane and took it down. I thought I sacrificed my life to save others, but I was wrong. I woke up almost 70 years later and found Hydra still rising into power.”
A soft bark fills the room and Dodger comes over, wagging his tail happily like he always does. “He’s not the only one,” Tony laughs and reaches out to pat Dodger’s head. “You ready for the baby, Dodge? He’s gonna be stinky and whiney, kinda like you.”
So yeah I made Bruce that kind of doctor haha. Also I think Pierce is starting to catch on....not good.
“Why the hell would I do that?” Tony doesn’t get a response. “Don’t worry okay? I’ll help you figure things out.”
Finally the door is opening up and Steve is jumping out of his chair. He speaks to the doctor, only picking up a few words. It’s difficult to focus when all he can think about is Tony. The moment he’s granted permission, he’s ready to rush through the door, only to pause and send a glance Natasha’s way.
“Your dad said the same thing and never did.” Steve chuckles and rises to his feet. “You might find it interesting.”
He needs another distraction. Something that’s going to take Steve’s memory away for good. Tony laughs at himself. Steve was never going to go away. He was always going to be there, haunting Tony for the rest of his life. Maybe Tony deserved that. He deserved that kind of pain.
Peter comes back over to watch his dad work. “What were you listening to? I heard his voice,” he says.
I finally got around to updating this one! Sorry for the delay! Enjoy some Steve and Peter bonding moments 😊
“Quit bickering, lovebirds,” Natasha teases and makes herself comfortable in the chair next to Steve. She lays one hand over the small bump. “How’s little Natasha doing?”
But then Bruce is leading him to another room and that’s when Peter starts to panic. He knows what’s about to happen next and he can’t help but start to feel uneasy. All he wants to do is go home and pretend that none of this was real.
“I won’t break this one. You’re my son and I love you. I wish I had done better, I really do. But if you want to leave then I can’t stop you. I’ll always have a place for you at the tower if you ever want to come back.”
“I want you like this. I want to see you.” Tony ducks his head down to capture Steve’s lips in another kiss.
Tony groans and releases a sigh of defeat. His eyes land on Steve and they narrow. “You gonna stand there all day or help a guy out?”
Tony tries to crawl closer to console his husband, but Steve holds out a hand to stop him. Tony backs off.
“Because…” Tony pauses and sighs. “You don’t know. I wish you’d believe me but I get it’s going to take time and trust. I screwed up really, really bad. I don’t blame you for being so hesitant. But just give me a chance to prove that I’ve changed.”
Tony turns away from Steve, settling his eyes on the baby. He’s frozen from both shock and fear. The baby should be moving, crying; but it remains lifeless in his arms. The worst comes to mind.
“You can sit down,” he says and gestures toward the sofa when Peter remains in the foyer. The kid nods and makes his way over to the living room, shrugging his backpack off and sitting down gingerly, almost as if he’s afraid of ruining the piece of furniture. Tony can’t help but roll his eyes. “Scotch?” He offers and the kid shakes his head.
“Yeah,” Steve nods and runs a hand through his sweat-damped hair. “Making the baby is the best part.”
Tony’s expression hardens. He did not want to talk about Steve right now. Or ever. At least until he was ready.
“Fuck, Tony!” Steve’s back arches off the bed and his eyes flutter shut when Tony starts to move. He trails a hand between them, taking his leaking cock into his hand and stroking it in time with Tony’s thrusts.
“You are not a burden. You are the best thing that ever happened to me, and I’ll never regret having you.”
Peter runs as fast as he can out of the tower and into the middle of the street, nearly getting hit by oncoming traffic. He stops in the middle of the road when a taxi almost collides with him. He apologizes and keeps running, ignoring the sting in his eyes.
“This is your room,” Steve points out and he sends Tony a confused look. “I can’t take this away from you.”
Bucky doesn’t mean to sneak up on his nephew, but years and years of training as not only a sniper but the world’s deadliest assassin made it hard not to. Peter jumps and yelps in surprise when Bucky knocks softly on the doorframe.
The elevator comes to a stop and the doors open. Bruce steps out first and Tony trails behind him, keeping some distance to avoid more questions.
“Steve?” Tony says softly and the small sobs Steve makes die down instantly. “Hey, you okay?” Tony asks, stepping further into the room until he’s standing near the opposite side of the bed. Steve’s back is still facing him, but Tony can see the movement of his head when he nods in response.
Steve picks himself back up just like Tony knew he would. He gets back into a normal routine and even attends briefings and leads missions. He smiles again and doesn’t hide away anymore. But deep down that ache was still there.
The sound of the elevator arriving captures their attention and they both look up right as the doors open and Steve steps out. He looks refreshed from a shower, and for a moment Tony wonders if this would be the day Steve acted like himself.
“Hey, kiddo!” Tony greets, doing his best to hide any sadness from his tone. Peter mumbles some kind of response and sluggishly moves toward the island, pulling back one of the stools and plopping down in it. Tony chuckles at his son’s behavior. Peter was never a morning person. “How’d you sleep?” Tony asks and he comes over to properly greet his son with a kiss.
“You didn’t have to wear it. But I thought you’d look amazing and...damn that color looks good on you. Let’s just skip the dinner and go straight for dessert.”
“Stop making everything about you,” Natasha finally grants Tony an answer. He rolls his eyes and scoffs, expecting her to put him down again. “Stop,” her tone is harsher and this time he glances at her. “You spent 15 years worrying about yourself and doing God knows what. We needed you. Steve needed you. But that was then and this is now. The Avengers are fine, but your son isn’t. Stop making this situation about you and focus on him. He needs you.”
“You said yourself that something like this shouldn’t have happened. It’s not your fault okay? We’re getting to bring him home soon and I promise everything is going to be fine once he’s here.”
He makes it over to his locker and quickly begins turning the lock toward the first number of the combination. He misses it and curses to himself. He takes a deep breath and waits a second for his hands to quit shaking.
“Not for long.” Steve grimaces and shifts in his seat, struggling to find a more comfortable position. Peter is pressing on his lungs, making every intake of air difficult. Steve blows out a deep breath. “I’m ready for this kiddo to get here.”
Tony appears offended. “Hey! I’m getting better at this cooking thing. I swear I worked really hard to get the french toast golden brown. Now quit judging and dig in.”
Hey everyone! I’ve decided to try and finish my WIPs and this one was on the list. I’m trying to get inspiration for all of my work and sometimes it’s difficult for me. Thank you all for being so patient and supportive! I love you all!
Tony can’t help but frown at his husband’s tone. Steve is still eyeing the clothes he’s laid out, almost as if he’s contemplating other options. He picks up the shirt and studies it for a moment before placing it back down with a sigh.
Steve didn’t know it was possible to love someone so much. He loved his mate and the bond they’ve created could never be broken. Tony was his everything. But the bond he’s created with his son didn’t compare. The love he had for that little boy was different. Steve’s heart would swell with joy every time they were near each other.
The room is instantly filled with the sounds of his son’s cries. It’s the most beautiful sound Steve has ever heard. Peter is placed on Steve’s chest and one of the nurses begins to dry him off. Bucky is the one who cuts the cord.
Steve is at the playground, disguised in one his worn baseball caps. Bucky is with him, dressed similar. Tony smiles. Some things never change.
“Hey, kiddo!” Tony greets cheerily. He doesn’t ruffle his son’s hair, knowing it’ll probably make Peter irritable. He can’t remember when the mood swings start but he doesn’t want to take any chances.
Tears flood Steve’s eyes and a few escape and stream down his face. There had been no updates since their son was taken away to be looked over. Surely they would’ve heard something by now. It didn’t take the staff long to clean Peter up and swaddle him in a blanket. But of course Peter had been monitored for the entire pregnancy. The other baby hadn’t.
“You sure you’re okay?” Tony asks. A part of him is hoping Steve would let him stay longer or they switch it up and spend the night at his place, but then Steve is nodding his head, assuring Tony that he was fine.
But no one cared about what he thought. He was just a kid. It was so easy for everyone to run over him and treat him like he was nothing. His dad had no problem doing it.
There shouldn’t be that much doubt when it comes to Tony, but Steve can’t help the way that he feels. Tony had already proved that leaving was easy for him, and there was no telling if he’d do it again. Steve wanted nothing more than for Tony to come back and they picked up where they left off. No restart. They needed a do over.
Steve grows silent, jaw clenching and eyes filling with tears. Tony’s struck a nerve. But that was his intention. He had to make Steve believe he was the issue. It was going to be Steve’s fault.
He’s having a pup. A pup Hydra wants to use and control. They would treat it like some sort of puppet. This pup, like the others, was in danger.
Steve’s eyes are full of tears, and they begin to roll down his face. Tony moves closer to console the scared omega. The alpha in him is urging him to protect Steve and keep him calm.
“Wake up, sleepyhead.” It’s Natasha’s voice and Steve rolls over, finding his friend sitting on the bed beside him, a bright smile on her face. In her arms is his son.
They were better off staying apart. At least Tony had been willing to give him space and think everything through. Peter wishes he had taken the time to do that before letting himself get so attached.
He doodles quietly in his notebook during his English class. If his teacher notices she doesn’t comment and continues with the lesson. He pauses to admire the drawing, his heart clenching at the shield he’s just sketched. He scribbles over it.
Tony steps into the room and shuts the door for privacy. He takes his original spot beside Steve, careful not to disrupt his sleeping son.
They both look up when they hear the door to the lab open. Happy appears first, followed by a very excited Peter.
“How’d it go?” Tony asks. He frowns when he takes in Steve’s battered state. “Jesus. What happened, Cap?”
Steve lets out a shaky breath and he buries his face in the crook of Tony’s neck. “You feel so good.”
Steve was still nervous about having a baby, but he was ready to love his baby with everything he had. Tony still appeared hesitant, or maybe Steve was overthinking again. Tony had already made it clear that he wanted to have a baby. He wouldn’t be pregnant right now if he didn’t. But Steve can’t help but wonder if his husband was truly joyed with the news.
Steve ends the call. He waits, hoping and praying that the phone would finally ring and Tony would be on the other line. But the call never comes, and Steve has to fight back the tears that gather in his eyes.
“Traitor,” Tony tells Dodger, then he turns to his boyfriend with a frown. “Thanks a lot, Cap. We were bonding.”
“My birthdays were…” Tony pauses for a moment to plan out his next words. He doesn’t want to mention the tower of presents, the large cake, the decorations, and the massive group of people that attended the occasion. It would come off as bragging, something Tony wouldn’t intend but it would sound that way. He decides to be honest about them. “They were...depressing.”
“Hey, it’s okay,” Steve soothes and he steps into the bathroom to comfort his son. He can’t help but grin at the mess on his son’s face. “What happened, bubba?”
Steve chuckles and curls up against Tony, his eyes falling shut. It’s not long before he’s drifting off to sleep again.
By the time all of their friends leave and he and Steve settle in their apartment, Tony is beyond drained. The nursery is full of the gifts Peter received and Steve promised he’d deal with it in the morning. Right now he’s content lying in bed with his arms wrapped around Tony.
Steve glances down at his hands again. His eyes fill with tears and he does everything he can to hold them in. He takes a deep breath to calm himself before glancing up at his friend. “I’m scared,” he admits. “I have no idea what I’m doing and Tony...he doesn’t know.”
I just want to say that I appreciate everyone who's stuck through this. I know it's rough and if it becomes too much and you can't continue, then that's okay! I still appreciate how far you did come. That's all I wanted to say :)
Peter keeps his gaze on Tony’s face, listening to the familiar voice. He only whimpers when Tony makes the mistake of pulling the bottle away too soon.
Pepper is standing at the desk and speaking with a woman Tony has never seen before. The stranger appears to be in her late twenties, maybe early thirties, and has red hair. She’s attractive, he’d give her that, but there was something about her Tony couldn’t place. He blames his uneasiness toward her on all the recent drama that’s come into his life. It was hard for him to trust people these days.
They were over. Their relationship didn’t exist and the friendship they promised each other was well on its way to never existing either. And then Peter came along and in an instant, they were pulled back to each other.
The door to the room is opening and Doctor Patterson is stepping inside. “How are you feeling, Tony?” She asks as she crosses the room to wash her hands at the sink and grab a pair of gloves.
His papa was his whole world. They might not have been a perfect family, but to Peter, his papa was perfect. He did his best to care for Peter and his friends. He sacrificed everything to keep those he cared about safe. The world looked up to Captain America. He was the world’s hero. But he was Peter’s hero too.
“It’s okay. He’s...better. I think meeting you helped. I had been worried about him. Steve was all he had.”
He blocks the sounds of their mating out. He chooses not to listen to the sounds the alpha makes. He ignores the sparks of pleasure that shoot through him.
Enough was enough. He can’t do this anymore. He can’t continue to hurt Steve in the most horrific way. He can’t continue to end these innocent lives. He was the one who was fucked up. Steve didn’t deserve this kind of abuse. Steve deserved so much better.
“I don’t want to leave again.” Peter pulls away from Bucky. “I like it here. I like living with you.”
The small whimpers she makes begin to rise in volume and Steve brings her even closer, his instincts kicking in now that she was in his arms. He manages to slip one arm free and lift his shirt, exposing his swollen chest to her. She latches on immediately and quietly nurses.
“You don’t have to tell me,” Pepper begins softly, “but if Tony’s the reason why you’re crying then him and I are going to need to have a little chat.”
“Your Papa isn’t gonna be happy that we’re waking him up,” Tony sighs. Morgan continues to voice her hunger, leaving Tony no choice but to wake Steve up. “He’ll understand. You’re the one asking for food, not me.”
Steve nods and takes another breath. His eyes wander around the space, a small smile tugging on his lips. “This is where it started.”
It doesn’t take long until Steve is succumbing to the pleasure and reaches his release. He falls completely still and waits for the alpha to finish. Alpha thrusts a few more times until he comes with a grunt, his breath hot against Steve’s ear.
There’s no sign of his papa and a wave of uneasiness washes over him, but Peter knows his papa is fine. He was Captain America.
He lowers himself down to the floor, a shiver running up his spine from the cold surface. It wasn’t an ideal place to give birth. He’d rather be somewhere warm and safe to deliver his pup. But he was forced to give birth on the cold floor like some kind of animal.
“No.” Steve shakes his head and presses himself closer to Tony, not caring if they were sweaty and messy. “It was good. I’d be willing to do it again. Those cuffs are something.”
“I know that’s wrong and I don’t mean to have those thoughts, but I just hurt so bad. I don’t know how to explain it; I don’t even know if I can try. I’m just in so much pain and I want it to go away. I want to feel like myself again.”
“Hey.” Tony interlocks their fingers and gives Steve’s hand a reassuring squeeze. “Morgan’s good. You’re not missing much.”
The apartment is quiet when Steve comes in and he figures Tony is still asleep, only to find that the master bedroom is empty. Steve frowns to himself and checks the nursery, and that’s where he finds Tony.
Steve eases off and slumps back, greedily gulping down air into his lungs. The next contraction is already approaching, robbing Steve of the break he desperately needs. He takes another deep breath and leans forward, bringing his chin down to his chest and pushing hard, groaning through gritted teeth from the intense pain.
“We are,” Tony assures and he gently pulls Steve forward. Steve follows and Tony wraps him in his arms. “I love you so much. And Morgan loves you. Don’t ever think that for a second that we don’t.”
Steve is thankful she’s here to help him place his son in the car seat. Tony had yet to emerge from the bathroom, leaving Steve to care for Peter when he needed a new diaper. While Steve changes Peter, Harley dozes off in his car seat.
He’s about ready to take a break when his phone rings. He half expects it to be Steve. They had already spoken and his mate had assured him he was fine, but maybe something had changed. Tony hoped not.
Tony nods. He had another question ready, but he’s afraid to ask it. He’s afraid to know the answer.
He can’t help but worry and listen to that voice in his head. It constantly reminded him of the screwed up relationship he had with his own father, and the childhood that was anything but happy. He vowed to be a better father, and to give his son all the love in the world. It’s what he had wanted.
Brock acts first, doing the one thing Steve never expected and firing his gun. Steve dodges the incoming bullets, but he’s not quick enough and one hits him in the arm, grazing the skin. Steve grits his teeth but doesn’t back down, determined to give Rumlow the same treatment as the other alpha.
“No!” Peter cries suddenly and rushes over, laying a hand over the weapon. “Uncle Bucky, wait! Don’t!”
“Hey, Mr. Stark? He’ll get better, right? I don’t know much about postpartum depression, but I think he’ll beat it. He’s Captain America. I mean, he can beat anything!”
“Actually,” Tony starts and he reaches into one of the bags and pulls out a twelve inch red plastic devil with black horns. “Here’s the devil and he’s going to look cute on our front door.”
It was a thought he’s had for a while, even before Steve and Peter, but now that he had a family, he was ready to give up his company and devote all of his time to his mate and son. His father had chosen work over him and Tony was not going to follow in his footsteps. He wanted to be a good mate and an even better father.
But none of those scenarios played out. Steve went into the base unaware that Tony had already planned to blow it to hell. Steve died fighting a fight that didn’t concern him in the first place.
“Darling, we’re not fighting. I think we’ve done enough of that already.” Tony smiles and brings Steve in for a kiss. Steve instantly relaxes and kisses back. “Better?” Tony asks once they break apart.
It’s Bruce who places a hand on Tony’s shoulder, and they share a sad smile. Tears prick the corners of Tony’s eye, but he doesn’t let them fall. He’d cry when he was alone and safe in his penthouse.
“Can I...ask something?” Peter asks. Tony nods, though he’s nervous about the question on Peter’s mind. “How...I mean...I sort of know how you two met but I was wondering if...never mind.”
But Peter wasn’t ready to give up. His papa always taught him to keep fighting. When the bullies would knock him down and Peter would come home crying, it was his papa comforting him and reminding him that he was strong and to never allow anyone to knock him down. His papa never backed down, especially when he was determined. And Peter was determined to have a relationship with his dad.
“Hmm?” Tony hums and turns around in his chair to face the screen. His face falls. “Forget it. I’m not doing that this year.”
“I was in heat. They always make sure I’m in heat before bringing the next alpha in. I made you do it. I asked for it.”
The change in Steve’s tone is difficult to ignore. Tony glances in his direction, reading his features carefully. The pain, though he was trying hard to conceal it, was there. Tony was sure Steve would have rid himself of some of it by now.
“I did.” Steve nods with a smile. He leans closer to peck Tony on the cheek. “Believe me I’m glad you two are closer.”
Steve allows his hand to roam curiously over the alpha’s back. He grows braver and brings his hand to Tony’s chest, breath hitching when he feels the beating of the alpha’s heart. He lays his palm against the steady beating.
“Please!” Tony cries and the video pauses, right on Steve’s smiling face. Tony stares at the image, into Steve’s eyes, wishing he could be staring into the real thing. Tony releases a choked sob and glances down, unable to watch the video. “Please, J. I can’t. It....it hurts. Please…”
Peter nods his head again and pulls away so that their eyes can meet. “I’ll give him so many kisses! I don’t like seeing Papa so sad.”
“Bedroom,” Steve murmurs and presses a kiss against Tony’s lips. His hands find their way to Tony’s belt, slipping his fingers in the loops of his jeans and tugging him forward.
The tears are streaming down her face now and she wipes angrily at them. Her family had never been perfect and she always believed that she would love them, no matter the flaws they had. But it was hard to say that now.
“Sorry. Those weren’t the orders.” Brock smirks and yanks Tony to his feet, emitting a groan from the smaller alpha. He shoves Tony forward and out of the house.
Tony sighs and glances down at the crumbs decorating his shirt and rug. “Well, that failed,” he mutters.
Steve’s belly twists into uncomfortable knots and his palms grow sweaty. He hasn’t felt this nervous in sometime. He takes a deep, slow breath to calm his nerves, but even that does very little to help.
“You did a hell of a job.” Tony glances back down at the photo, grinning widely. “I love it. I love you.”
It’s Steve’s turn to laugh. “That’s my line. But in this case you can have it. I don’t want to do this all day.”
“Your father believed you could lead the Avengers,” Nick replies. “Obviously you still have a bit of growing up to do. I figured you’d need some motivation.”
“I know.” Tony takes Steve’s hand and gives it a gentle squeeze. “We can keep trying. That is always the fun part, right?”
“What for? Hey, talk to me,” Tony urges softly when he knows Steve is shutting down. “Steve, whatever it is, you can tell me. I love you.”
“I missed you, sweetheart,” Steve tells her, his voice soft and soothing. It’s nothing like it used to be. There’s no anger or frustration in his tone; he appears happy to have her.
“As I was saying, he refused my service and prepared his own lunch. Something you don’t understand how to do.”
“I guess so.” Steve is still frowning. He picks up the glass and brings it up to his lips, taking a small sip.
Tony connects their lips again, this time deepening the kiss. He pushes Steve back until he’s lying flat on his back with Tony hovering over him. The kiss grows more heated and passionate. Steve moans softly when Tony’s tongue brushes against his lips, begging for access.
“Tony,” Steve groans and pushes Tony’s hands away. “It’s nothing. It’s not that okay? I can’t...I just can’t.”
Peter invites Ned over, not caring if he ‘forgot’ to ask permission first. He needed his best friend now more than ever.
“You’re in a good mood this morning,” Happy says when he notices the cheerful expression on Peter’s face.
There’s a moment of hesitation before Steve answers with a shake of his head. “I’m sorry,” Steve whispers. Those tears in his eyes escape and roll down his face. “I’m trying to be.”
“I don’t know what you’re so afraid of, but figure out how to deal with it,” Steve says, then he’s slamming the door on his way out.
“The truth, Tony! The truth!” Pepper exclaims, throwing her hands up in the air. Tony waits, expecting another outburst, but then she calms herself down with a deep breath and places her hands over her hips. “You should’ve told him how you really feel. Why is that so difficult for you?”
His Uncle Bruce is still on the jet. He hasn’t noticed Peter yet, too occupied with the controls and the screens he has to keep an eye on. It was the perfect distraction for Peter to sneak out.
Steve takes a deep breath and exhales slowly, his eyes shutting as he tips his head back against the seat. He forces his mind to think about something else, anything else. But all his brain can conjure up is thoughts about the alpha after him and his pup.
“Of course not,” Tony assures and takes Steve’s hand, bringing it up to his lips and kissing it. “It’ll be a group interview. Well, minus the pups.”
Tony smiles down at him. “Aw, kiddo you’re working yourself up. Why are you being a stinker, huh? I thought we made a deal?”
Tony pulls him close, bringing Steve’s head down against his chest and he threads his fingers through his hair. “You’re not fine, are you? Tell me what’s wrong.”
Two more alpha’s are rushing over and pinning him roughly against the wall. Rollins retrieves the rope and comes closer, an evil grin on his face. Steve struggles to break free from the two alpha’s holding him in place. He manages to slip one arm free and throw the alpha off of him.
Tony reads the letter over and over again, struggling to comprehend the words. He did have a son. He wants to be angry at Steve for keeping something huge like this from him, but truth be told, Steve hadn’t kept anything a secret. He tried reaching out to explain the situation and Tony blew him off every single time. It all made sense now; the phone calls and letters had been to tell Tony that he was a father.
He can hear his aunt and uncle talking as he makes his way down the hall and toward the bedroom he told himself he’d never enter again.
“Yeah.” Tony nods his head in agreement. “I’m working on it. I don’t have what you’re used to...yet.”
“Pete,” Bucky sighs and lays a hand over his nephew’s shoulder. “I’m sorry. I know you don’t want us to go, but we don’t have a choice. It’s our job to protect others. To protect you.”
The first few times aren’t so bad, but then it keeps happening. Steve feels like he’s in some kind of time loop. Just when he thinks he’ll get some sleep, Peter is waking him up and the cycle starts all over again.
“I’m a billionaire, remember? Oh right, you don’t. It’s a long sorry. Enough about me, though. What about you? You said you’re from Brooklyn. Why are you here and dressed-sorry, that’s rude.”
Peter is falling asleep, comfortable and content in his father’s arms. Tony doesn’t want to let him go just yet, and he holds him for a little longer. It’s not until Steve is dozing off does he let the nurse take Peter back to his incubator.
Peter watches as he leaves, a sad sigh escaping him. He wishes his dad would’ve stayed. Maybe they could’ve talked to his papa together.
His papa’s special day was everything but special. It had its sad moments, but there had been good ones. It wasn’t supposed to be a perfect party, it never could be without his papa, but Peter wanted it to be happy.
Oh man this chapter came out way longer than I thought! Also I did warn that this story was kinda dark and this chapter does have some dark and messed up themes. There is a rape scene in this. I didn't make it horribly graphic but it's still not a pretty scene. If that's too triggering than by all means skip it. I just wanted to give everyone a heads up!
It’s obvious his snarkiness was going to get him nowhere. The other alpha is clearly unimpressed with Tony’s behavior. The little voice in the back of Tony’s head warns him, practically begs him for once to behave, but he can’t help himself. For months he’d been dying to give this fucking asshole a piece of his mind.
“Steve?” Tony calls out to his mate, praying that Steve would look at him. But Tony’s not sure if he really wants that. He’s afraid to see how much pain his mate is truly in.
He has to pause again when his vision blurs and he’s unable to work properly. Tony sniffs and pulls back, dropping his tools on the bench with a loud clank.
“What?” Tony questions when he catches the bright smile on his husband’s face. The smile Steve wears grows and he comes closer, dropping the lube down beside Tony and placing his hand over the bump. “Ah okay. Junior is making you giddy again.”
“He was...fine. He worked hard. His company was...I don’t know. Probably more important than me. I mean he never told me he loved me. I don’t even know if he liked me.”
“Yes he does. That’s why he targeted you. This baby is supposed to be their next leader. They needed a genius, and that’s you. You’re the alpha they wanted.”
The jitters continued to make themselves known throughout Steve’s life, and he was sure the worst case was when they welcomed their sons. Becoming a parent was both a blessing and the most terrifying thing in the world.
“I-I know.” Steve sniffs and pulls away so that he can sit up and wipe away the tears that don’t stop spilling. “I’m happy. I am, but I’m scared. They don’t really know me and...and what if I can’t be a good mother. They suffered because of me and-”
There’s his pup, cradled in Bruce’s arms, and whimpering softly. Those tiny whimpers escalate and turn into a loud wail. Steve cries along with him, his heart bursting with love for the life he and Tony created.
He’s greeted with a slight breeze and the warmth of the sun. Usually he likes to be out before the sun, but with how his night was spent, he gets a late start. He’s panting heavily by the time he finishes his first lap and his face is hot and sweaty. He stops halfway through his second lap to catch his breath, his lungs burning and stomach coiling painfully. He groans and places a hand over his belly, eyes squeezing shut when the pain worsens.
He’s hard at work on his own project, something he won’t allow Tony even a small glimpse of. Ever since Steve discovered one of Tony’s old journals, he would sketch every now and then. It was an old hobby of his that he had been forced to give up, another thing Hydra had stolen from him. But now he was getting back into it. Tony made a mental note to get Steve his own art supplies instead of an old journal and a pencil.
As if on cue, the front door is opening and Steve is stepping through. Relief washes over Tony at the sight of him.
“Yep. So much stuff I didn’t even know what to do with it. Would’ve rather had affection but well...whatever.”
“I guess. But I know you’re going to blame me! I probably shouldn’t have said what I said but I just lost it. I swear I’m trying, Pep. I’m trying to be a good husband, a good father. I’m trying to be what he needs but sometimes...God, I feel like an asshole for thinking this, but sometimes it’s too much. I’d never leave him; I love him. But...it’s hard. Dealing with this is just so hard.”
The sting of Tony’s comment hasn’t gone away. It probably never will. Steve knew Tony never intended to hurt others, especially the people he loved, but that didn’t change the fact that his words were hurtful in the worst way possible. The jab spoke volumes. It spoke the truth.
“You’re gonna cum like this,” Tony pants against his ear. He moves his hips harder, making sure to hit that spot inside of Steve with each thrust.
“And I did want this party to work. I just wanted everyone to be together again. The last time we gathered like this was for the…”
More guards are waiting for him. He’s defenseless without a weapon like the ones they possess, but he has one advantage. He’s stronger than any of the alphas.
“You were sick. I remember you saying that,” Tony says. He can see the shiny appearance Steve’s eyes had taken.
“Sorry,” Peter apologizes and rushes into the building. He glances around the large lobby, taking in its professional and lavish style.
It wasn’t just his sarcastic side that Steve had fallen in love with. It was no secret that Tony usually kept to himself. The walls he had built were specifically designed to never come down, but with time, not all structures remain standing.
He’s not alone. Sam and Bucky were the first to greet him downstairs in the medical bay, followed by Bruce. Natasha had been on her way with Morgan, but Tony had advised her to stay behind. A part of him wants to see his daughter and hold her close, but the other part is torn. He knows seeing her will only crush him. She was losing Steve, too.
“They’re alive?” Tony asks in disbelief. Just hours before Steve had told him otherwise, and now he was learning that the pups Steve had thought he lost were in fact alive and under SHIELD’s care.
Steve chuckles lightly. He gently pulls on the tie until Tony is close enough for him to connect their lips. Tony was expecting a quick kiss goodbye, but instead Steve is kissing him passionately.
“Only because you made them for me.” Steve smiles and he leans over their sleeping son to press a kiss to Tony’s lips. “Are you keeping the suit?”
Bucky stares straight ahead, his jaw clenching and metal hand rolling into a fist. Alpine meows, sensing the change in his attitude and jumps off the couch to rub herself against his legs. Bucky instantly relaxes.
The moment they finished lunch and returned home, Steve was on Tony in seconds, crashing their lips together in a passionate and desperate kiss. Tony had been shocked at first. They hadn’t been intimate in some time, not that Tony was going to voice his complaints out loud, but he’d be lying if he said he didn’t miss this part of their relationship.
“Our space, sweetheart.” Tony corrects. “And I don’t care. Have you seen my lab? It’s not that great at the moment.”
A chorus of ‘yes’ fills the room and Steve rolls his eyes. He couldn’t care less what the gender of his baby was. All that mattered was that they were healthy. So far the scans had been good and none of his past health conditions decided to pop up. The baby was perfectly healthy.
“Please?” Steve turns to begging, knowing his defensive attitude will only get him in more trouble. “Please let me keep her? I’m her mother.”
“Sorry,” Tony apologizes. He had spaced the order too. Steve wasn’t the only one trying to adjust to their new life. “I can help move some of the stuff in...your place?” Tony’s not sure why he says it like a question. It was obvious the baby would be living with Steve.
The day he’s supposed to leave starts off wrong from the start. He’s physically drained despite the amount of time he spent in bed. Lately he has been falling asleep earlier. He wonders if it’s because Tony’s schedule has changed and he can’t avoid curling up with his husband. It was about time they started getting enough sleep. So then why was he still tired?
There was no doubting how Steve was going to be. Maybe a mother hen, if Tony was being honest, but Steve would show the same amount of love and adoration for their son. Of course one of them was going to have to be the hardass. They’d leave that job to Natasha.
“I’m just thinking…” Tony trails off, brows pinching together. He can’t tell Steve what he was really thinking. The last thing he wants to do is freak him out or come on too strong. Then another thought crosses his mind. “Move in with me.”
Steve nods and allows himself to be led back to the living room where everyone was gathered and enjoying themselves. Steve wants to pull Tony aside and ask him about the trip, but he holds off. Now wasn’t the time.
“I know I don’t need a bodyguard anymore-” Tony starts to say, only for Happy to scoff and roll his eyes. “I said anymore! I’m fine now. Anyway, Pep and I were thinking that you’d be great as Head of Security. It has great benefits.”
Their eyes meet and that’s when Bucky notices how dull they appear. Steve smiles weakly at his friend, then it’s faltering and his face contorts in pain. He glances down, a panicked look crossing his features at what he finds.
Tony takes his time with this part, not wanting to hurt Steve. He teases Steve’s entrance, then slowly pushes the tip of his finger inside. His eyes flicker up to Steve’s face, looking for any signs of discomfort in his features. When he finds none, he presses in a little more until his finger sinks in all the way. Steve moans and clenches down, desperate for more. Tony gives it to him and he adds another finger, using them to stretch and scissor his husband open.
“Were they in the base?” Tony asks the two agents, his eyes not moving from the little family inside the room. Sarah is crying as the physician looks her over and Steve comforts her, no doubt scenting her like he’d do with Peter.
So sorry for not updating this one in awhile! I’m trying to plan out how I want to end it and all that stuff. This has been the longest story I’ve ever written 😬
“I’m sorry,” Tony apologizes. “I’m dampening the mood huh? This was supposed to be about you and our son.”
The photo is of them a few years ago during one of their annual trips to DisneyWorld. Both are smiling brightly and wearing their Mickey Mouse hats. Peter smiles, the memory of them still fresh in his mind. They used to go every chance they got, but eventually it got harder and harder to attend the Happiest Place On Earth.
Falling in love was never supposed to have happened. They were strictly teammates and that’s all they were ever going to be. Tony Stark didn’t fall in love.
“Steve... he...he got upset again. I don’t know why. I panicked okay! He was holding her too tight and I was afraid...afraid he was going to hurt her. We had to leave.”
He rushes to his closest and pulls out an old backpack, and begins filling it with clothes and other items he might need. Ned would probably let him stay for a couple of days while Peter gets his shit together. Then of course there was his Auntie Nat or even his uncles, Bucky and Sam. But then he wonders if they’d take his parents' side.
Steve screams when sharp nails dig into his bond mark. He squirms in the alpha’s grasp, trying to break free but failing miserably.
So heads up...I’ve had this idea for a while and let me tell you it’s...it’s rough. And I know a certain someone is going to get a lot of hate, but this wasn’t supposed to be a happy story. Not everyone gets a happy ending. And if you’re fine with that then great! If not...I’m sorry. I did warn you guys a while back. 😬
Steve says goodnight and takes Morgan with him. Tony makes sure his husband is out of earshot before walking Peter toward the door.
No one questions him when he returns downstairs. It’s as if no one noticed the lack of his presence. His teammates are seated around a few sofas, laughing and drinking, completely unaware of what just happened upstairs. Steve is with them, chatting with his new friend Sam Wilson.
“Boo!” Comes a familiar voice behind him and Steve turns in his chair, smiling at the sight of his son. Peter is dressed in his Captain America helmet and in his hands is a small, plastic replica of the famous shield.
“Okay. I’ll be right there. Thanks, buddy,” Tony says, then he turns back to Steve. “We can talk later, right?”
“I just want things to go back to the way they were,” Peter sobs into his uncle’s chest. Sam holds him tightly, running his fingers through the messy brown hair. Just like Steve used to do.
The alpha chuckles. “Is that it? That doesn’t scare me. I know you won’t hurt me. You don’t have it in you.”
“I’m this close, Cap.” Tony uses his index finger and thumb to show Steve just how close he really is to leaving. Steve is smiling again and Tony frowns. “This is the part where you beg me to stay.”
“I’ll go easy on him,” Tony assures, but his words offer no reassurance and Steve quirks a brow. “I won’t yell! I’ll just...have a nice chat with him.”
The voice is back, forcing Steve to stop in his tracks and pause his dinner preparations. He grips the knife in his hand tightly, taking deep breaths to calm himself. He wasn’t going to listen. That voice was wrong.
Despite the couple of years since the passing of his father, the sadness has never fully disappeared. Some days are easier than others. Peter is proud to say that he can pull himself out of bed every morning. But there are times when even that is too difficult to do. His family is right there by his side, holding him up and providing strength when he can’t seem to muster up his own.
“Look let’s take this slow and...that doesn’t sound right. You know what I mean. I want to make things right. I fucked up and-”
“Yes.” Tony rolls his eyes and throws an arm over Peter’s shoulder, leading him further into the apartment. “Can you handle this, kiddo?”
And honestly he’s not sure how to feel about it. He was still terrified and couldn’t imagine having a baby this young, but at the same time he found himself growing attached.
“Don’t apologize. Look, let’s forget about it. I know you probably want to eat or sleep. I’ll leave you to it.”
The bed has become too uncomfortable for Steve to lie in, and after his doctor suggests he try walking around, Bucky eases him out of bed and leads him around the room. For a while Steve is able to pace around the room, one hand holding his belly for support and the other gripping onto Bucky.
Steve leans forward and with a yell, pushes one last time. He slumps back, his chest rising and falling rapidly. He musters up enough strength to lift his head, and that’s when he’s met with the most beautiful sight he’s ever seen. His daughter is held securely in Happy’s hands.
“Yeah.” Steve nods, a smile forming over his face. He was still riding the high. He had never felt so at ease before.
The penthouse no longer resembled its past self. It was usually kept pretty tidy, mostly due to the fact that Tony practically lived in his lab. He had gotten better at returning to his home to eat, shower, maybe sleep if he felt the urge, but ever since he asked Steve to move in with him, the space was drastically changing.
“It’s his kid, though,” Bucky says next. Despite being gone for weeks with SHIELD and before that brainwashed for years under Hydra’s control, he was catching on pretty quickly.
Pain erupts in Tony’s hand and he glances down, finding fingernails digging deep into the skin on his hand. Steve’s eyes are blown wide, his body writhing as he struggles to breathe.
Pepper nods, but Tony knows she can see right through him. Truth be told, he wants to take that next step with Steve. They had done everything backwards. Breaking up, having a baby, getting back together, and now moving in, wasn’t the direction Tony had envisioned them going. But now, he wouldn’t change anything.
Cold, blue eyes are settling on him now and Tony stares back, holding his ground and refusing to let this other alpha dominate him. He doesn’t even flinch when he’s released from the chains and yanked to his feet.
“How the hell was I supposed to know that you...that you loved me back? How!” Tony shouts. Luckily he’s the only one at the cemetery, and no one hears his outburst.
“I’m not done yet. I still want to keep this world safe, especially now.” Steve’s hand falls to his middle when he says this. The gesture doesn’t go ignored and Nick’s eyes land on the Captain’s belly.
But his taste for revenge hasn’t been quenched. For years the alpha in front of him hurt him in unimaginable ways. For years Steve was beaten and raped, forced to believe that he was nothing but Hydra’s toy, their puppet. He was taught that he was nothing. He wasn’t a fighter, he wasn’t strong enough. He was just a worthless omega.
“Yeah I got them. I didn’t read them because I couldn’t figure out how. I’m wishing I did. Would have saved me a trip.”
Steve rolls his eyes and then glances at the hologram of the monster that is still in his kitchen. “Did he forget that we have a 5-year-old son?”
Eventually he pulls away and wipes at his eyes, doing his best to clear up the tears. Steve smiles softly at his son, and reaches out to try and fix his messy hair.
Pierce grunts from the blow and eases off, inhaling deeply to calm himself. “Don’t fight me. I know you want this.”
“Jerk.” Bucky throws a pillow at his husband this time, hitting him perfectly in the head, causing Sam to lose his balance and fall over. That brings on a new fit of giggles.
The taste of the alcohol is overwhelming; the feeling of the forced kiss is nauseating. But Steve has no choice but to let it happen.
He curses at the thought of having to start over. He takes his time, making sure each little button is properly snapped shut. Peter is still agitated, no doubt from a late feeding schedule. Steve usually had him latched on and nursing by now.
They were ready to take that next step and start a family. Tony had been hesitant about the idea at first. He didn’t want to end up like his father or somehow even worse. It took a lot to convince him that he’d never be the type of father Howard was.
Tony sighs and turns back around to focus on his work. He jumps when arms wrap around his neck and soft lips are kissing his cheek.
“Yeah.” Tony pushes himself away from the island and steps toward Steve until they’re standing beside each other. Steve smiles softly at him and hands him the mug. “Thanks.”
“Sorry.” Ned winces from his mistake and he lowers his voice. “How do you expect to get through the rest of this year?”
“It’s not that. I guess I’m not used to…all this.” Steve gestures to the shelves. “There’s a lot of stuff these days.”
“You’ve made it this far and it’s been fine. I know it’s not ideal not having Stark but-do you want my honest input?”
Peter stirs, a small whimper escaping his lips. Steve shushes him quietly and brings him closer. Peter’s eyes flutter open for a moment before dropping shut again, then he begins to purr.
But he hesitates. His papa would drop everything and rush over, but then he’d also smother and Peter did not want to be smothered. His papa would try every home remedy in the book until giving in and driving Peter’s ass to the nearest emergency room. And that could not happen. Peter’s secret would be revealed and that was the last thing he needed.
Tony is still hesitant to jump back into a relationship with Steve. Using their son wasn’t a good enough excuse. There’s a part of him that’s worried about starting up their relationship. The fighting was an issue, but really Tony was worried about himself. He knew how much of a handful he could be, and though Steve could handle a lot, maybe one day, Steve wouldn’t be able to handle him anymore.
Tony glances over at his other two children, watching as they play on the blanket he had set down on the grass for them. Sarah has most of her stuffed animals with her, each one given their own teacup. Peter pretends to drink from his cup and then holds it out for his sister to pour him more of the invisible tea.
But even if his words weren't what Steve wanted to hear, Tony still stood by them. He was still hesitant to be in a romantic relationship with Steve. They had their moments when everything between them was good. But the bad days they had were too much.
Tony is in the nursery, sitting on the floor beside their daughter while she coos happily in her baby swing. Tony is smiling, just like he has been since the day he learned he was going to be a father.
Peter nods and switches to chewing the nail off his thumb. A knock on the door has him jumping in surprise and quickly rushing to answer it.
“Can’t,” Steve says through gritted teeth. The pressure is back, only this time it’s between his legs. On the next contraction he gives an experimental push, gasping when the baby drops lower into his pelvis. “Shit!” Steve cries, dropping to a squat and resting both hands over Tony’s shoulders as leverage.
“Hmm.” Steve frowns as he makes his way over to his son’s closet and begins going through the clothing. “And these don’t fit?” Steve holds up another pair and Peter shakes his head.
“You’re gonna go home, pal. Just stay with us okay?” Bucky replaces Natasha’s hand with his own, pressing down hard to stop the bleeding.
It’s not until they’re led to a small lounge room toward the end of the hall does James relax. He immediately lets go of his brother’s hand when he notices the table against the wall with an abundance of snacks and drinks.
“And I’ll do it again. I’m serious, Tones. You need to move on. What you’re doing isn’t going to bring Steve back. He’s gone.”
“You can use mine. You actually left a few things here and um…” Steve’s face heats up and he rubs a hand along the back of his neck. He knew he should have returned the clothing Tony left behind, but being caught up with his role as Captain of the team and not completely healing from the breakup prevented him from giving Tony all of his belongings back.
“Tony, wait,” Steve tries to defuse the situation. “I’m not trying to make this about me. Having a baby was for both of us. I thought you wanted this.”
“Then what’s going on with you?” Steve reaches across the counter for Tony’s hand. “Talk to me, Tony. You’re different.”
But Tony wasn’t like other alphas and the new position Steve has maneuvered himself in has the alpha seeing red. He growls in anger, the deep rumbling causing the omega to whine and cower.
Peter takes her hand and squeaks in surprise when she lifts him like he weighs nothing. She was a lot stronger than he gave her credit for. And not just in the sense of physical strength. His aunt has overcome a lot of hardships in her life. He knew a bit about her past and the journey she went on just to get to where she was now. She was inspiring and uplifting. Peter looked up to her. He always has.
“Come here.” Tony holds out a hand and Steve takes it. Tony pulls him forward and down for another kiss. “I love you so much,” he whispers against Steve’s lips.
Peter had started going by his superhero title now. Morgan couldn’t help but laugh when he told her he was Spider-Man. She couldn’t grasp the idea of him having the word ‘man’ in the title of his new name when he still acted like a little boy. That always started a fight between them.
His death was sudden. There had been no warnings. No one had a chance to prepare for it. Tony can only imagine what his son’s suffering through. He wonders if Peter at least got to say goodbye. Probably not. Steve wouldn’t allow him to tag along on dangerous missions. He wonders if Steve held on just long enough to say goodbye. God he hopes so.
Harley breaks away from his brother’s grasp and crawls on the bed toward Steve, his nostrils flaring as he scents the stranger.
Steve sighs harshly. “Maybe he can help. I know it’s crazy but they’re his weapons. The least he could do is help us.”
Peter spends another night with his uncles. For the most part they seemed okay, or at least better than what they’ve been. Bucky was still quiet and only opened up when Peter or Sam asked him something, but other than that he kept to himself. It was obvious he was still hurting from the loss of his best friend. Sam was too but the relationship he had with Steve didn’t compare to the one Bucky had.
It’s past dinner time when Tony finally makes it through the front door. He loosens the tie around his neck and lets it hang. He shuffles into the kitchen, opening the fridge and searching through the bit of food he does have inside. With a huff he shuts the fridge and leans against the counter.
“Great. I’m glad you figured out the reason for our separation. We’re fine. We don’t need to be together to raise a kid. Plenty of people do it this way.”
Bruce sighs. “I do agree with therapy. Clearly they’re showing signs of physical, mental, and even emotional abuse. I’m not too concerned about the gaps they have; that could be taken care of. I can recommend someone if you’d like.”
Tony returns with a calm Harley and he hands him to Steve. “He’s all bandaged and begging for you. I have to head out.”
This time he was well aware of today’s topic. Peter loved his best friend, Ned. They had been inseparable since their first day of kindergarten. Steve had been worried about his son starting school, afraid Peter would struggle to fit in just like he had. Steve had been the scrawny, sick kid and Peter was...well, a super kid.
He knew he had options. A unplanned pregnancy wasn’t the end of the world. He could put the baby up for adoption, give them a good home with loving parents. He wasn’t fit to be a parent. He could barely take care of himself at times. If it wasn’t for his parents he’d be a mess.
“Please don’t take her!” Steve tries again, only for his pleas to go ignored. Alpha grows frustrated. Like all of the times when the alpha has become angry, he takes it out on the omega. The first slap catches Steve off guard, leaving him dazed and bringing tears to his eyes. His face burns from where Alpha’s palm had struck him. “Please? Alpha, please?”
“Always.” Natasha smiles softly. Her smile quickly falters. “I didn’t say anything to him. He asked a few times but it’s not my place to tell him. He’s going to take it hard.”
Tony places one last kiss to Steve’s lips before lying back and bringing Steve down with him. He threads his fingers through the omega’s damp hair, continuing to praise him. Steve pulls back slightly, glancing down between them and frowning.
He doesn’t put up a fight. He doesn’t scream, scratch or kick. He lies completely still, letting the alpha use him however he wanted.
They make their way toward the master bedroom where Tony takes over and lays Peter down in his bassinet. Steve excuses himself to say goodnight to the rest of their children.
Steve moves through the ship, sneaking up behind the enemies he comes across and taking them down as quickly and quietly as he can. The top of the ship is cleared, and before he can move on to search for the weapons, he’s forced to stop and catch his breath when a particular hard cramp ripples through him. It’s strong enough to pull a pained gasp from his lips and one hand flies down to the spot, gently pressing against the bump he discovered earlier. It feels tighter.
Pepper sighs. She wasn’t in the mood to be interviewed again. “Natalie, send them away. Now isn’t a good time.”
Steve huffs out a laugh. “No one’s perfect. Well...maybe except him. He is the perfect alpha, but not the way Hydra wants him. He’s perfect just the way he is.”
“Lead the way.” Tony gestures with one hand and Peter takes it instead to drag him toward the elevators.
Tony watches her while she sleeps, smiling softly and heart bursting with love for her. He never knew he could love something so much. The fears and doubts he had no longer existed when she was curled up in his arms.
“Morning, honey,” Tony greets and sends Steve a warm smile. Steve returns the smile, though it’s not as bright. It almost seems forced. Tony frowns. “What’s wrong? Couldn’t sleep?”
Steve claimed he wasn’t hungry and made the decision to stay back in their apartment. Tony didn’t question it at first, figuring his husband just wanted some time to sleep in. Morgan had been fussy again and though Tony made more attempts to get up and help, he found he wasn’t as helpful as he intended to be. He could change diapers and rock her back to sleep, but Steve was still doing all the feedings, and most times Morgan refused to latch on.
“Oh my God.” Tony groans and rises to his feet, moving toward the front of the long table and resting both hands against it. “I’m not taking anything up with him. At least not yet. I wanted to tell you first.”
He knows what he needs to do, but the decision is too big and he finds himself worrying about it more than he should. There isn’t anyone he can really talk to about it. He opened up to JARVIS, only for his trusted A.I. to criticize him and the choice he was contemplating.
“Yeah.” Steve hadn’t intended for his tone to sound so concerned. He often wondered if the pup was truly going to take after him and inherit the serum. A part of him had wanted this pup to be born normal, free from any enhanced abilities. He’d mean nothing to Hydra then.
Tony takes Steve up the stairs and toward the large master bedroom. He could easily offer one of the other rooms his penthouse has, but he wants Steve comfortable.
Steve perks up at that. “Yeah?” He asks and Pepper nods. He smiles, “It’s good to be home. I was afraid I’d never come back.”
The rest of the drive is surrounded in silence. All Peter can think about is his uncle. He wonders if his Uncle Sam is okay and if the rest of the team is staying strong. The message had sounded urgent, and that terrifies Peter. He couldn’t lose another family member.
“Hey, J?” Tony calls out to his trusted A.I. “Do you have the footage of me coming home last night?”
Tony is no longer in the nursery by the time Steve emerges from the bathroom. He’s in the bedroom, bent over the bed, holding himself up on his forearms with his eyes shut.
There’s a moment of silence over the line. Peter internally panics. He wasn’t the greatest liar in the world. If he was his parents wouldn’t know he was pregnant. Happy could probably pick up on the lie Peter was telling.
“He misses you too,” Sam says and rises to his feet. “I’m not going to stop you from wanting to see him. The decision is yours okay? But make sure you come back for cake.”
“By not eating the ingredients,” Steve huffs and snatches the bag away before they all get consumed. “I see where Pete gets it from.”
A fit of giggles from the other side of the room breaks out and James pulls away, curious as to what made his brother laugh so hard. Harley is running around the alpha sitting crossed legged in the middle of the room, giggling every time the stranger reaches out to tickle him whenever he’d pass by.
“What are you doing down here?” Pepper comes closer, her eyes roaming over the array of parts and tools scattered around the workbench.
“I can’t help but notice the discomfort you’re feeling. If I may, sir, suggest seeing a medical professional.”
Thank you guys so much for the wonderful responses on this story! I'm glad you all are liking it so far! I know it's dark and poor Steve is going through a lot, but it will get better for him. For now...
“What?” Tony is taken aback from the question. He thought he had already made it clear to his son that he loved Steve. That he still loves him.
Steve relaxes almost immediately at those words. Maybe because they sound so similar to the first words Tony had said to their pups when they met.
Tony’s a little surprised to find Steve still waiting in the conference room. He doesn’t know why he thought Steve would run away again after what he’s been through, but Tony would’ve understood if Steve tried to book it. They were strangers. How could Steve trust him?
“Do you wanna trade?” Tony asks after a few moments of silence passes between them. “Unless I’m never allowed to hold my...other son. This hasn’t sunk in yet and the kid’s right there.”
“Dad?” Peter asks and approaches his dad. Tony lays down his tools and turns to greet his son with a tired smile.
It’s not just Dodger that’s smothering him. Tony had taken it upon himself to spoil Steve, and just like Dodger, he was always lingering. Steve understood, he was just as cautious about doing everything right, but there was a line there and his boyfriend and dog had started to cross it.
Sorry that this chapter was on the short side and Tony wasn’t in it. I just wanted to show what everyone else is up to and Peter’s life with them. There will be more scenes like that. But Tony will be in the next one! If that matters. I know he’s on the shit list 😂
Steve rests his head on Tony’s shoulder and continues to sob for the little boy they lost. Tony cries along with him. He cries for their son, but he also cries for his actions. He’s the one responsible for the heavy loss.
“Right. I guess I missed that part when you went off and got yourself nearly killed. We both feel taken care of,” Tony scoffs with a roll of his eyes.
The omega hisses and his back arches when Tony wraps his lips around one of his sensitive nipples. Tony peers up at him, pausing and searching for a sign that he should stop.
Steve eyes his mate, searching for any indication that Tony was lying. He can’t find one. “Okay,” he says with a smile. “And this breakfast...you did it all by yourself?”
Steve scoops his son into his arms and presses a big kiss to Peter’s cheek. The pup responds by wrapping his arms around Steve’s neck and placing his own wet kisses along Steve’s face.
He doesn’t bother reaching out to Tony again. It was clear that Tony wanted no part in another mission or their son’s life. History was repeating itself.
He locates the elevator and takes it to the top floor. He takes a moment to compose himself and think of a quick plan. He knows once Pierce is out of the picture the rest of his men would fall back. They counted on him.
“I know you want to laugh,” Steve says when he catches the grin on his husband’s face. He sighs again. “Go ahead. Just get it out.”
Tony sighs and slips his phone into his pocket. “I set up an appointment for you. Next Thursday at ten.”
When the elevator doors open, he is shoved out into another hallway. Rollins grips his arm tightly and drags him toward one of the empty rooms. It’s already been sanitized, the strong sterile scent has Steve wrinkling his nose.
Steve was just as excited, if not more. It was still scary knowing that in a few weeks he will be a father, but the idea of holding his son for the first time pushes those fears away.
It didn’t make sense. His body couldn’t possibly be as healthy as the doctor claimed. It was his body responsible for ending all of the pregnancies.
“Hmm?” Tony glances down at the bouquet. “Yeah. It’s been a while since I’ve brought anything and I figured maybe he’d…”
Tony frowns in response to the question. He opens his mouth to speak, only to shut it when he can’t properly form a response. He doesn’t understand what Steve means.
“Something…” Steve grunts again and spreads his legs wide. He bears down again. It feels right. He grips the band of his sweats with one hand and lowers them down.
Steve whines sadly and buries his nose in the crook of Tony’s neck, inhaling the comforting scent his alpha naturally gives off.
Tony smiles into the kiss. “I may or may not have done that on purpose,” he confesses once they break apart.
Steve quietly goes down stairs, stretching the t-shirt over his growing middle. He makes a mental note to ask Tony for bigger clothes.
You guys! This is the last chapter! I'm sad to see it end but I look forward to the new fics I'm working on and future stony stuff (I have a lot of ideas). These two get their happy ending with their beautiful son and I'm so happy for them! They came a long way.
It’s not until Doctor Patterson begins the ultrasound does Steve grow excited. He can’t help but lean forward and glue his eyes to the screen. He can vaguely register the conversation Tony is having with the doctor and the comparison of this machine to JARVIS’s scans. He tunes them out, his attention on the blank screen that he knows will show pictures of their baby.
“Sorry,” Steve apologizes and tenderly runs his thumb over the knuckles of Tony’s right hand. “But you’re not him. You never will be. You’re going to be a wonderful father.”
He picks up the sound of someone downstairs and he immediately rushes out of the room to investigate. He’s ready to ask JARVIS to scan the perimeter for any threats, but then he holds off when he picks up a familiar scent.
Tony tries to reach for his cock, but it’s squished between them, rubbing along his growing middle and smearing precum along the underside of it. He forgets about jerking himself off, knowing he was going to cum untouched. He just needs a little more.
Tony lets out a heavy sigh and runs a hand through his damp hair. He had already been at it for a few hours, and the progress he made so far was good, but not enough for him to cross it off the list and mark it as complete.
“I promise.” Tony cups Steve’s face in his hands and smoothes his thumb over the tear that escapes. “I won’t let him hurt you. You’re safe with me.”
“I’ve been better,” Steve says, forcing a smile to hide the fact that in reality, he wasn’t doing all that great. It wasn’t just the tenderness from the birth that was affecting him. He was still struggling to wrap his mind around the fact that he had just given birth and needed to care for a tiny, vulnerable human. It was overwhelming.
The suit never does get finished. They get distracted with other things, talking mostly. During dinner, Peter makes suggestions for his future bedroom, and Tony offers to show him the space he plans to renovate. It would be another project for them to do together. Something for them to bond over.
Before another attack can be issued, Steve is up and blocking the blows thrown at him. His shield is out of reach, but he’s fought without it before and this time was no different. He crashes his fist against his attacker's jaw, filling his ears with the crack that follows. The man screams and reaches out for his battered jaw, and with him distracted, Steve finishes him off.
“Papa?” He whispers when his papa’s face appears on the large screen across from him. The video must be around Christmas. The tower is fully decorated in twinkling lights. But it’s the sight of his papa’s smiling face is that brings a smile to his own.
But now he was breaking the promise he made to himself. He hated to admit it, but he needed Tony right now. Their son needed him.
“I used to be the same way after you were born. I thought they were going to love you more and I’d no longer be the favorite.”
Happy sighs and glances at Peter again once they reach a red light. “Listen, Pete, don’t rush things with this guy okay? Maybe he has changed, but it’s better to be careful.”
Steve chokes back a sob and wipes at his nose with the sleeve of his shirt, only to cry harder when he realizes he’s created a stain on the fabric with his tears. Now his shirt was ruined.
“James?” Steve moves toward his pup. James peers up at him, his blue eyes bright with tears. “Sweetheart, what’s wrong?”
“Daddy!” Sarah cries and rushes toward the alpha, throwing herself at him and wrapping her arms around one of his legs.
Peter frowns at his own words. Of course his dad liked him. He was his son. A father was supposed to love their son. His dad was just scared. Tony had said it himself that he was unsure of what to do and how to act. Peter just had to give him the benefit of the doubt.
“So beautiful,” he says, and reaches out to touch Steve’s chest. The omega gasps when that same hand travels lower and lingers over his belly. They had said they’d wait until the other pups were older, but Tony still can’t help but imagine his mate pregnant all over again.
The team didn’t have all the details yet, and Steve wasn’t sure how they were going to react to the news. It had been a surprise for him and he can only imagine it being the same for them.
“Well, it’s been crazy here, Tony. Not only am I working overtime, but you haven’t even called me to check in. The last time we spoke you were running away and hopping on the jet to California.”
“Stop being dramatic.” Natasha slaps him playfully on the shoulder. “Everyone loves you. Even if you can be stubborn sometimes.”
Steve doesn’t give up. Everyday he’s writing a new letter and sending it off. He waits for a response, only to receive nothing in return. It’s more pathetic than waiting for a phone call.
“I know you two weren’t together and I respect the decision you two made but...how come you didn’t come to the funeral?”
“Hey, kiddo!” Tony greets and takes his son into his lap. “I made a new thing,” he says and shows Peter his progress. “Puppies are cute, right? Papa likes puppies.”
. You never fucking asked how I was doing. It was always about you. This has always been about you!”
He crashes and lands outside of the room, gasping when the air is knocked out of him. Steve winces and tries to get up, only to slump down when his stomach erupts with pain. It’s worse than before, so strong that it brings tears to his eyes. Steve groans and rolls over onto his back, wrapping one arm around his middle.
Tony holds up a hand to silence the rambling and Peter falls quiet. “I’m gonna stop you there. I’m sure you already know the answer to most of those questions. We don’t have to go over that again.”
Steve nods, considering the idea. He wasn’t sure if he could retire yet. The world still needed saving. But then there was his son. Peter needed both of them, and the thought of leaving him for a mission made Steve consider hanging up the shield for good.
“I tried to…” Peter starts to say, only to stop himself when he realizes talking about his almost abortion in the middle of a busy hallway wasn’t the way to go. He tries to change the subject, but then he sees him and all thoughts go out the window.
He talks with Pepper again and Bruce, but it’s Happy he hasn’t gotten a chance to mingle with. He wasn’t sure why the beta was so intimidating. Usually it was the betas who were calming down distressed omegas. But Happy was different. His scent wasn’t bad, at least not really, but it lacked something.
Steve bites down on his bottom lip, hesitating for a moment. Then he says, “I want to get on heat suppressants.”
Steve shakes his head and leaves the room to attend to his upset pup. Peter is sitting up in bed, tears running down his face and clutching his puppy tightly.
“We’re not friends,” he tells the dog, getting another bark in response. Tony sighs and reaches out for the dog, gently patting his head. “Guess you’re not so bad. We’re still not friends…not yet anyway.”
“Hey, look at me. I promise. I’m not going to leave you, ever. I’ll always be here, honey. And if that voice tries to tell you otherwise, don’t listen. Call me and I’ll stay up all night with you if I have to.”
“She’s a piglet,” Tony teases. That makes Steve laugh. It’s not the gut busting laugh he’ll let slip from time to time, but one day it will be. One day he’d laugh again until he cries. Tony couldn’t wait for that day.
After Bruce gets the samples he needs, he deems them free to go and promises he’ll keep in touch. Steve doesn’t question the sample of blood he had to give, assuming it was all just part of the checkup. Tony is relieved when the omega doesn’t say anything about it.
Tony was still hesitant when it came to the pup. The results haven't come in yet and every day Tony was growing more and more anxious. He had decided he’d care for the pup despite whatever the results state. Steve was going to need someone.
A baby. He was supposedly having a baby. And with an omega he didn’t even know. They weren’t even bonded.
“Rough day?” Sam asks when he notices the frown on Peter’s face. He notices something else and his brows furrow at the logo on Peter’s sweatshirt. “MIT?”
“That’s not what I’m trying to say. If you would just listen.” Steve’s aware of the dangerous tone he’s using. His patience is being put to the test, something that always happens when he’s trying to communicate with Tony.
It’s near his bedtime when a knock on a door interrupts, and Peter yanks his earbuds out of his ears and grants permission to the person on the other side of the door to enter.
Steve chuckles and joins Tony on the bed, wrapping an arm around him and pulling him close. “You know we need a doctor,” Steve points out.
There’s a rush of guilt that floods through him when he’s allowed to see his son for the first time since he was whisked away. The tubes and wires surrounding his son only add to the guilt. This wouldn’t have happened if he would’ve known.
Tony sighs and pauses his work. “Sorry. I just couldn’t sleep. You know me, always building instead of sleeping like a normal human being.”
He had lost himself after Peter’s birth. He questioned every move he made, constantly doubting himself and his abilities to be anyone other than America’s hero. He was a father now. And that was his most important role.
Peter chuckles and searches for the white cat, frowning when he can’t find her. He’s sure she’ll show up at the foot of his bed later.
Pepper rolls her eyes and takes Harley and James by the hand while Happy takes Sarah. Tony switches with Steve and holds Peter so that Steve can climb onto the exam bed.
“Don’t be...it’s...it’s…” Tony stumbles over his own words. He’s not angry at Steve. It was obvious from Steve’s reaction that he didn’t know about the baby, but it still left Tony wondering how they missed this.
“Just do it. He’s harmless. Look at him. Do you think I’d have any trouble with him? Come on, let him go.”
“I’m sorry,” Tony whispers, one hand coming up to cup Steve’s cheek. His thumb gently swipes along the smooth skin. “I don’t want to rush you. I don’t...I don’t want to...hurt you.”
Steve takes a deep breath to steady his nerves, and once he deems himself ready to proceed, he pulls Tony in for another kiss. They take it slow, just like Steve wanted.
“I’m sorry,” Tony says. He gives up on booting up his computers and instead makes his way over to the sofas and plops down with a heavy sigh. “I’m sorry I wasn’t there.”
He directs his eyes back on the parts he can see, licking his lips at the sight of the rippling muscles of his torso. Tony finds himself reaching out a hand to touch. The omega jerks from the contact, a soft moan filling the space.
“Yeah.” Tony finds himself agreeing. It surprises both himself and Steve. For the longest time it appeared that Tony would never give the dog a chance. But he’d do anything for Steve. “Don’t get your hopes up, Cap. We’re not friends yet.”
Tony sighs and shifts in his seat. “He was...stubborn as hell. It was like I couldn’t even say anything without pissing him off. I mean, I’m not an easy person but...he was...something else.”
Tony has to fight the urge to slam on the breaks. Instead he glances in the kid’s direction, a look of disbelief on his face.
Tony hums in response and wraps his legs around Steve’s waist, urging him closer. Steve bottoms out in one thrust, causing both of them to groan. Steve gives Tony a moment to adjust before he starts to move. His movement is slow and cautious, careful not to hurt the baby. Tony grows impatient and bucks his hips.
The doctor follows his gaze and she frowns. The same concerned look Tony is wearing is now on her face. “Steve? Is everything alright?”
Steve switches on the living room light, illuminating the space and revealing his oldest pup curled up on the sofa with a blanket.
He stops when he gets to one that has Steve in it. Peter looks to be about 8 years old. His tiny arms are wrapped around Steve’s neck while they both smile for the picture. It’s the smile on Steve’s face that Tony notices a little bit more. He looked so happy.
“I mean it, Steve. You’re breathtaking. We’re so lucky to have you. I don’t think we could live without you.”
“Uncle Bruce!” Peter cries out, snapping Tony from his thoughts. Peter rushes to greet Bruce, throwing himself at him and hugging him tight. Bruce returns the embrace and whispers something Tony doesn’t catch.
Morgan decides to check on him. She uses her math homework as an excuse. She knew the material and didn’t require any assistance, but she figured it would be a good reason to get his attention.
The room has a slight chill in the air, but it’s the familiar scent that smacks Peter in the face first. He flips on the light and allows his eyes to roam over every visible inch. The first thing Peter notices is the neatly made bed, then his eyes travel to the worn out pair of sneakers lined up against the wall.
Sam sighs. “I had a feeling. You always love to eavesdrop. Okay spill it. What did you hear? All of it, or just parts?”
“Just take a test. And if not…” Tony trails off and places a hand over his belly. “We already got a bun in this oven.”
When Peter does wake up, it’s to the sensation of someone stroking his face. Peter groans and his eyes flutter open, immediately locking with familiar blue ones. His papa is staring at him, a tired smile on his face. But it’s the bruises and blood that has Peter gasping and sitting up in bed.
Tony steals a glance in the direction of the baby swing that’s been set up beside the sofa. Peter’s eyes are fluttering, the little boy struggling to fight sleep. The soothing sway of the swing would work on him soon enough. And if that didn’t work then...Tony would be screwed.
With his guard down, all it takes is a second for the man to issue another attack. But there’s no punch or kick.
“I had fun,” Steve says once they’re in the elevator. Tony smiles and reaches for Steve’s hand, intertwining their fingers. “Maybe we can make this a recurring thing.”
“You should’ve let me go,” Steve whispers. He continues to smooth his thumb over Tony’s hand, hoping the contact would be enough to coax Tony awake. There’s no response, but that doesn’t stop Steve from gently squeezing his hand. He gasps softly when Tony squeezes back.
Tears gather in Peter’s eyes, momentarily blurring the two lines staring back at him, but when he blinks and clears the tears away, the results are clear and bringing more tears and a choked sob. He grips the test tightly and sits down on the closed lid of the toilet, his body hunching forward and the sobs wrack through him.
“Where were you! I called and called and you never answered me!” Pepper cries. She hits him again, this time on the shoulder. It still hurts.
Tony rolls his eyes and shuts his lab down for the second time that night. He double checks on Peter, finding the teen sprawled out on the large bed and sleeping peacefully. Tony closes the door and makes his way toward his own bedroom.
“Hey, Pete. I didn’t know you were…” Bucky trails off and glances at his husband, searching for an explanation.
A few minutes later, he gives up and leaves the safety of the bathroom. He shuts the light off behind him and pokes his head out into the hall, looking both ways before stepping out and heading downstairs to greet his parents.
“Mama,” James says, barely above a whisper, but Steve’s enhanced hearing picks up the word. Steve nods and more tears run down his face. It’s James who comforts him this time. “Don’t cry.”
“Hush! You want this!” Pierce continues to roughly thrust inside the crying omega. He looks over his shoulder to meet the other alpha’s eyes. “Don’t be fooled. He enjoys this. Did he fight with you too?”
Steve rushes to grab the burping cloth when more than just air escapes Morgan’s mouth. Tony doesn’t even care that a bit gets on his hand. He knew babies were messy, and honestly he loved being this hands on. He loved being a dad.
Tony nods and glances down at his plate, twirling the fork in the pasta but not bothering to eat any of it. He wants to ask Steve about those bad days, but the subject was still a touchy one and the last thing he wanted to do was ruin a good meal between them.
The beta comes closer and Steve’s eyes flicker in his direction. He tries to move away, only to halt his movement when one of the other alphas points a gun at him. They won’t shoot him, Steve knows this, but he can’t help but cower in fear.
“Blue’s nice but-” Tony pauses and with his free hand, plays with the silky tie. “-red is my favorite color.”
Steve rolls his eyes and tries to push Tony away, but the alpha just brings him right back and gently kisses him on the lips.
Pepper returns a few minutes later and they start the meeting again. Steve is still hesitant and unsure about revealing who he was and the life he was forced to live, but his mate and friend assured him that he had nothing to worry about. He was safe now.
“Because I needed to talk to him. It was his party I went to. I thought maybe he’d know more about that night and-Steve, I’m sorry. I didn’t know it was him. I never would’ve invited him over if I did.”
His fingers hover over the keyboard as he contemplates sending the first message, but he holds back. He was tired of doing all the work while his dad did the bare minimum. That’s what got them in this situation in the first place. Peter had done too much, expected too much.
“Let me see,” Natasha takes the album back and goes through it, stopping every now and then to laugh and make fun of any that had Bucky in them. He’s not amused and a playful banter breaks out between them.
But being a parent had its rewarding moments. Steve never missed any milestones. He was there for Peter’s first words, his first steps, his first tooth; Steve vowed never to miss anything. He wanted to be there for his son, just like his mother had been there for him.
Peter smiles. “You know...dad was talking about a new suit upgrade and maybe...if you want...you can look at the blueprints. You always have the best ideas so I don’t know maybe-”
Tony smiles and he places another kiss to the mark on Steve’s neck. A comfortable silence falls over them. For once they’re both at ease. They don’t dwell on the threats that are outside the mansions walls. They only think about each other and the baby boy they’d be welcoming in a few months. Nothing else in the world mattered.
Bucky’s smile gets a little brighter. He glances down at the shirt and opens it up, giving Peter a glimpse at the words printed on the front: World’s Greatest Uncle
“Not always. You’re here, right?” Tony stands and pats the bodyguard on the shoulder. “Make sure we get there in one piece.”
“You really think he would’ve pulled you away from your retirement?” Natasha asks softly. “He knew you had too much to lose.”
Harley is still pouting when Morgan enters the living room. He glances up at her and smiles, showing off the gap in the front row of teeth.
Steve sobs softly into Tony’s chest, his tears wetting the hospital gown. Tony holds him close, rocking him softly like he would Peter when the pup was fussy.
“No,” Tony says with a shake of his head and his eyes fall shut. “I just need a minute. I don’t think I’ve found myself on the bathroom floor like that since last year’s New Year’s Eve party. That was a fun night.” Tony grins at the memory.
Harley wiggles again for a moment, then he’s relaxing and opening his eyes, locking them with brown ones. He frowns at the unfamiliar face staring down at him.
Tony crosses the room to get the couch. Peter is curled up under a blanket and sleeping peacefully. Tony almost doesn’t want to wake him. Tony pulls off the blanket and lifts his son with a small grunt. Peter stirs and his eyes flutter, only to shut again. He wraps his small arms around Tony’s neck.
“Did it!” Steve yanks back the collar of his shirt to expose the mark Tony had put there. “Did this mean anything or were you just feeling sorry for me?”
“Sorry.” Tony can only hope his apology sounds sincere. It must because Steve smiles up at him and brings him in for another kiss. This time Tony makes sure to be more careful around the bump between them.
Steve yawns again and works to lift his shirt so that he can nurse. Tony carefully passes him their son and Steve tries to get him in a comfortable position.
The conversation is dropped and they’re once again in silence. Peter is only able to take a couple of bites before he gives up entirely on breakfast.
“Now?” Sam has the audacity to ask. There’s still a clingy cat in the room and a teenager due home any minute.
Tony’s never scrambled so fast to grab the bottle from the nightstand. He returns with the bottle and pops the lid open, squirting a generous amount over his finger tips. Steve spreads his legs invitingly and takes his own cock in his hand, stroking himself as he watches Tony.
Dodger isn’t as clingy today. Steve doesn’t complain, though; he’s happy to have some space to himself. The couch is comfortable now that he doesn’t have to worry about sharing it with a certain someone, but after awhile he begins to miss his dog’s warmth and comfort.
He’s escorted out of the room by Rollins and led down the long corridor toward the elevator. The button for the third floor is pressed once they’re inside and the metal doors shut. Steve knows exactly where they’re taking him.
They’re forced to pull away when the door to Tony’s private room opens and they both glance up at the person lingering in the doorway. Tony recognizes her immediately.
It was safer-for both the child and himself- if his secret remained hidden. The last thing he wanted was for the world to turn against him and shun the child that was innocent. Not to mention Tony finding out through a gossip article.
They’ve gathered in the room, fitting comfortably in the large space. Natasha is the first one to smile at the sight of her nephews, but even she didn’t hesitate to gloat about her being right. Steve wasn’t surprised.
The moment he’s pointed out the life growing inside of him, his whole world shifts into focus. For once he’s not thinking about Tony and wishing for him to come back. All he could think about was his baby. The little life he was blessed to love and care for.
Steve tips his head back, letting it rest against the wall. His heart is racing and the grip he has on the knife is loosening. It almost slips through his fingers.
Rollins is on him in seconds, slamming him into the wall. The rest of the agents are crowding around him, preventing him from escaping their grasp. Brock is speaking into his comm. Then the alarm is blaring overhead.
The rain pours harder and thunder continues to rumble from the dark sky. Peter ignores all of it. But then a new sound fills his ears and he lifts his head, a flash of red and gold filling his line of vision.
Steve’s lips purse into a tight line. How the hell was he supposed to explain to the Director that he had a one night stand a few months ago? He was America’s Golden Boy. The image of himself was forever tainted.
“I did eat those chili cheese fries you were craving,” Steve points out and he crawls into bed beside Tony.
“I did get up to help,” Tony says, making sure to keep any irritation out of his tone. “You kept getting up before I did and when I did ask if you needed help-”
Despite their best efforts, they’re unable to find a costume Peter actually likes. He didn’t go for the typical pirate or ninja, and he wasn’t feeling it when Tony provided the options of vampire or werewolf. Tony even tried more cute options like pumpkins or puppies. Nothing. Nada. Peter hated all of them.
Pepper and Happy were two familiar faces, but they weren’t ones Steve was entirely comfortable around. At least not yet anyway. Their invite was more for Tony than himself, but there was still a part of Steve that wanted to get to know them a little better. They would be in his lives a lot more now since he bonded with Tony.
There’s still a part of him that’s hesitant to trust Tony. They knew nothing about each other and yet by some strange turn of events, Steve now finds himself living with the man he never thought he’d see again. The plan was never to bump into the alpha that sired his pup. All Steve wanted was to get away from Hydra and start over.
Tony chokes back a sob, the sound reaching the ears around him. He gets up quickly from the chair, grateful when he’s not followed. He stops once he reaches the elevators and he leans against the wall, releasing the emotions he’s had pent up inside. He buries his face into his hands, muffling the sobs. His body shakes, his legs can’t hold him up anymore and he slides down the wall until he’s hitting the floor.
“Yeah.” Tony doesn’t even hesitate to answer. He wanted Steve to be his omega and he was willing to take their relationship slow if it meant getting Steve at the end. His feelings for Steve were strong and getting stronger every day.
“Why won’t you let me help you? There’s other things you can try that won’t make you leave. Why can’t we try something else first?”
Steve glances down at his lap and fiddles with his fingers nervously. “You’re...an alpha,” he says quietly and peers up at Tony through long lashes. “Your job is to protect and keep me safe. I...feel that...I think. I mean, I’m still scared but your scent...it’s nice. I haven’t had a comforting scent in so long. I never thought I’d have one again.”
“Steve?” Comes the sound of Tony's voice and the omega opens his eyes. He pulls the blankets off and sits up, yawning and stretching his arms over his head. “Morning,” Tony says. He already had a steaming cup of coffee in his hand.
“What? This is a party, right? Come on, Pete. Your Pop’s would want to see you having a good time. I know I do.”
“Huh? Oh yeah,” Tony glances down quickly at his shirt before looking back up at Steve. “I think you’d benefit from it more.”
“What are you thinking?” Steve asks. He knows Tony too well; they both knew more about the other than anyone else ever could. “Talk to me.”
Bruce aids in the delivery of the afterbirth, then once Steve is cleaned up, he takes Peter to be cleaned and looked over by Jarvis. Steve is hesitant to let his son go.
“Stop!” Natasha cries out. Hot tears are streaming down her face now. The bickering among the team dies down instantly from her reaction. “Just stop,” she says a little softer now. “This isn’t what Peter wanted. And this sure as hell isn’t what Steve wanted.”
“You let your weapons get into the wrong hands. That’s what happened,” Steve snaps. He doesn’t mean to come off as harsh, but he’s in pain and he’s positive he would’ve come out with less bruises if Tony had tagged along for the mission.
After everyone leaves and it’s just the two of them again, Steve surprises Tony by remaining on the sofa instead of retreating back to their bedroom. Tony sits down beside him and pulls him close.
He was still stubborn as hell. He refuses to go to the doctor when his stomach continues to give him issues. Tony grows frustrated; Steve doesn’t blame him. It’s not until the stomach problem goes away and Steve begins to feel like himself does Tony drop it.
“I don’t know. I don’t know how he does it but he always finds an alpha and brings him to me. You were that alpha,” Steve says.
The omega rushes toward his mate, dropping down beside him and cupping his face. “Tony,” he whispers, his fingers brushing away the dark strands that have fallen in the alpha’s face.
Sleeping is still something he found himself struggling with, but being near Steve helped. Lately, he found himself curled up against the omega more than usual. Steve’s nightmares were still a thing, and though they hadn’t been as intense as past ones, he still required Tony’s comforting scent to calm him.
He hasn’t seen the city in sometime. He was usually cooped up at home to train for becoming an Avenger. The only times he really left the compound was to go to school or if he and his papa went out. He enjoyed their outings and the stories his papa would tell him.
“Hey, Pete,” Tony comes over and places a hand over his son’s back. “Papa and I need to tell you something. Go wait in the living room for us okay?”
“Wow,” Tony says and Peter peers up at him, expecting the worst. He’s surprised to find a small grin on his dad’s face. “I’m not mad by the way. Just...shocked. You don’t usually lash out, do you?”
The SUV eventually pulls up to the entrance of the tower. Tony peers out the window and curses at what he finds.
“No,” Bucky shakes his head. “I know he carried it with him wherever he went but we felt you should have it. He’d want you to.”
“I-I don’t want to. Believe me if I could I’d stay here, but I can’t. I need help, Tony,” Steve cups Tony’s face, smoothing his thumbs over each cheek. “I know you did your best, and it means so much to me, but this is something I have to do.”
The compound feels lonelier without Tony in it. They were supposed to have moved locations together, as a team, but Tony had already made up his mind that he didn’t belong. Steve should be grateful that Tony at least gave the Avengers a new home, but in reality it was just so Tony could have his tower back to himself.
“No we don’t. Get away from me,” Flash tries to get inside the car, but Peter is faster and puts himself between the flashy vehicle and his bully.
He can’t imagine not having Steve. He can’t imagine both himself and Morgan having to carry on without him. Steve was their rock, the sticky glue that kept them together. Steve needed to be in Morgan’s life, he needed to be there when she took her first step and when she said her first word. He needed to be there for her first day of school, when she graduates college, when she meets someone, when she gets married and starts her own family. Steve couldn’t miss any of that.
“F-Fri, I’m gonna need-need some medical attention here,” Tony tells the A.I., hating how his voice quivers a bit. He’s still in shock.
Steve nods and sits down, curling up with a blanket and taking a sip of his tea before replying, “Yeah. I just feel off.”
“Steve, please?” Tony begs, his vision of Steve momentarily blurred due to the tears that have gathered in them. He yanks at his restraints again. “Steve-”
“I miss you, Papa,” Peter says and traces a finger along the engraved name. He swallows the lump in his throat and continues, “I...I met dad today. I don’t know. Maybe it was stupid but you always said if I wanted to then I should. Now I’m wondering if I made a mistake. He’s…”
“I’m terrified. I thought having Dodger would help, but caring for a dog and a baby are completely different.”
Pepper glances up and waves him over. “I know you’re busy,” she says and gives him a quick glance. He hadn’t showered yet and his hair was disheveled from all the times he’s tugged at it in frustration. Building a nursery could be difficult. Pepper ignores his appearance and continues, “but this is important. I promise it won’t take too long.”
Steve was obviously ecstatic if the smile on his face and the tears in his eyes were anything to go by. They lock eyes and Tony forces another smile. Steve takes Tony’s hand, squeezing it tenderly.
“Tony, fuck, please!” Steve yanks Tony’s hair harder, bringing him closer and grinding against the alpha’s face. “Oh fuck. Gonna-gonna come!”
“Yes?” Peter says, unsurely, still confused about the glasses. “This is it? But they’re just sunglasses.”
Bucky lays a comforting hand over his shoulder and it’s enough to calm his nerves. It isn’t until Peter starts crying does Steve switch back into panic mode.
So that’s what he’s trying to do now. He was young and he still had a life worth living. He had told his papa he’d get good grades, get into a good college, and maybe-if he was lucky- find a girlfriend.
Thank you guys so much for the wonderful response! I’m so happy and excited that everyone is loving this so far! 🥰
Peter couldn’t care less about his dad. Well...maybe that wasn’t entirely true. He’d be lying if he said he didn’t think about him and wondered what it would be like if he was in his life. Maybe his life would be different, but Peter would never entertain the idea of two parents for long. He had his papa and that had been more than enough.
Steve ignores the comments and stares, his focus entirely on his husband. He places a hand over Tony’s shoulder, rubbing the spot soothingly. Tony eventually pulls away and leans back in his chair.
Those probably weren’t the right words to say but Tony’s already explained he’s bad with words. Peter doesn’t reply and instead finds interest in the bit of artwork on the walls.
Steve hums around the finger in his mouth and pulls off with a wet pop. “Come on,” Steve urges, thrusting his hips and rubbing himself against Tony’s hardening cock. Tony groans in response and ducks his head down, burying his face in the crook of Steve’s neck and inhaling the familiar scent.
Planning for a new baby was a lot harder than Steve had thought it was going to be. All he could think about was his son and what was still needed for him. They could cross out naming their son off their list of things to do, but there was still more that needed to be crossed off.
Steve doesn’t respond, too busy concentrating on breathing through the next round of contractions. They’re not as painful as the ones he experienced before the baby arrived, but they weren’t comfortable either. His body is urging him to push and with a soft grunt he bears down.
Tony wanted to believe all of those things. He saw the way Steve reacted when he opened up; he remembered the screams and the crying. How could that be made up? Unless he really was just a great manipulator.
“Oh yeah. Aching feet, feeling bloated all the time, horny as fuck, the urge to eat everything in the fridge. It’s all great stuff.”
Peter chuckles and twists open the lid of his soda. “Yeah. She’s awesome. Uncle Bucky thinks I should just focus on school but I want to be an Avenger.”
“I got it,” he hears Steve say in the darkness, followed by the bed shifting on his side. Tony blindly reaches out to stop him, but he’s not fast enough and he can already hear the soft sounds of Steve’s feet against the floor.
Coulson smiles softly and steps closer. “I just wanted to thank you, Mr. Rogers,” he says. Steve must look every bit as confused as he feels because the beta quickly adds, “Fighting for omega’s and their rights really means a lot. My mother was an omega. You’re an inspiration.”
And maybe that’s a sign that they shouldn’t be starting a family. Their jobs were demanding and dangerous. They were risking their lives everyday just to save others. But a baby, a tiny human that was part him and Tony was always on Steve’s mind. He sacrificed so much when he picked up the shield, and maybe now it was time he did something for himself.
“Dad, where are we?” Peter asks, his confusion only growing when his dad remains silent and continues to lead him away from the elevator and toward a part of the tower Peter’s never seen before.
“Sorry,” Tony quickly apologizes and leads the bottle back to his son’s lips. Peter latches on and nurses again. “I swear I’m trying okay? I don’t have any of this figured out yet, but I’ll do my best.”
“He’s not the same. He’s not...it’s like he’s not even happy that she’s here. Before she was born he had been excited, and now...now it’s like he doesn’t even care.”
“I’ll put it on the list,” Steve replies and takes out his pocket sized notebook to add it to his list. He can’t help but frown at the long list he’s created for himself. He had a lot of catching up to do and so little time to do it.
He opens it with shaky hands, his breath hitching at the sketch he finds. It’s of his suit...the one they were supposed to design together. Peter releases a small sob and carefully runs a finger over the black spider in the center of the suit.
He was going to need Steve now more than ever. He didn’t have the first clue about taking care of a baby.
The gun digging into Tony’s head is replaced with a sack, enveloping him in darkness. He struggles when strong arms are on him again and pushing him forward. A sharp pain radiates through his head and Tony falls limp.
He decides to give his son one last chance to tell them the truth. “Pete, you can talk to us. You know that, right? Anything at all.”
He pulls away and lets his lips hover over Tony’s. It’s tempting to kiss him again, but he holds back. He kisses Tony on the cheek instead and pulls back.
“Huh. I never thought about that. I mean I dressed up as Cap when I was a kid. I told you this!” Tony says when he catches the amused look on his husband’s face.
Something in Flash’s face changes. He no longer appears angry or paranoid. For the first time he seems scared and unsure. He was usually confident and full of himself. The Flash Peter saw and dealt with on a regular basis didn’t compare to the one standing in front of him now.
“So…” Tony tries again to make conversation. He kicks himself for not knowing what word should come next. It shouldn’t be this hard to talk to someone. Especially if that someone was his own son. Maybe that’s why Tony was so tongue-tied. It hadn’t fully sunk in yet.
Tony sighs. “I don’t know,” he says with a shrug and takes a drink from his cup. He directs his gaze out the window, taking in the heavy but usual traffic. “I guess I feel off about it. I should remember something, right?”
Steve gives Tony a kiss on the lips, then he’s leaving the apartment with Morgan. Tony waits until they’re gone and the door shuts before letting out a sad sigh.
Hearing his son ramble on and on about anything and everything brings a small smile to Tony’s face. The kid was bubbly and animated; it was difficult not to smile when he spoke.
Peter waves his goodbyes to the rest of the team. He doesn’t let them know he heard a bit of their conversation.
This time Peter gives in. He steps away from his bed and crosses the room to open the door. Steve smiles sadly at his son.
