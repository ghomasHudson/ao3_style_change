“ Yeah it is. These two are super soldiers. What happens if they can do a few more rounds than the average guy because of their stamina, do you know how sore my-“
“Made for my knot....such a good bitch....wanting my knot.....”
“ He said he will be back by Thursday. He’s worried about you and that... um... Winghead.”
Bruce groaned and pinched the bridge of his nose with his thumb and index finger.
“ Having friends I think will reduce the stress of you trying to get use to this place, what do you think?”
‘ What the fuck?’ Harry thought. He needed to get him home or Stark was going to kill him if Peter got hurt.
“ It’s... um.. nice to see you again. Yeah I kinda had a dentist appointment today so I was able to miss most of school, but I missed hanging out with you.”
They would get through this he knows they will.
“ Lift him up a bit, I want to play with his nipples,” Grant drawled.
“ Yes.”
Tony didn’t last long and came soon after.
“ So it is like a school just for super powered kids?”
Natasha shook her head. “ Anyway, he took it very poorly.”
“ Got it boss. Give me a moment.”
Quentin sighed and leaned down to kiss Peter on the forehead. “ Ready?” He whispered.
Wade: see you soon.
Steve continued to track him.
The other man sighed. “ Fine. Load him up. We don’t have time to clean him up. We are already running late.” With that the man walked away. Frank yanked on his collar.
“ Well you did and you broke his wrist. He’s part of the team Steve. We need Iron Man and we need Tony Stark. And more importantly he is our friend.”
The blonde sighed. “ Doesn’t mean anything. We can afford his meds, I imagine.”
Tony kissed back. He felt Steve licked his lips and he opened his mouth to allow Steve’s toNgue to enter. He felt
Tony stepped in and turned to face the door as Steve pressed the button for his floor. He turned and smiled at Tony.
“ Fine. I get. You’re getting impatient. Proceed.”
“ Wait... they’re your kids?” Tony asked.
“ Whatever, I think you are all idiots. I’m turning in. ‘Nite.” Tony groused.
What surprised Tony the most was when Loki started crying and accusing Thor of not loving him. Thor then approached the distressed Loki cautiously and explained again that he had indeed been very busy. That didn’t seem to placate Loki at all and had instead caused him to start to sob and cry out that Thor didn’t have time for him and no lo be loved him.  Dumbfounded,  Thor invited Loki to come back to the Tower.
“ Hey What the hell is going on?”
Harry: we can do whatever you want. I don’t mind. What do you like to do?
At that a tall alpha male with auburn hair strolled in with a grouchy look on his face. He had Bucky’s blue eyes and it was already apparent he was going to inherit Steve’s larger build.
So he was actually really tired, but he needed to check something first: Why The geriatric assholes were being such dicks. Steve could be a prick when he wanted to be and he could only assume that Grant wasn’t any better but this was ridiculous.
Tony sucked as he ran as the two resorted to throwing whatever shit was closest to them.
“ What? It’s an innocent question.”
Tony could feel Steve practically seethe behind him. He sighed again. He hoped his team came back soon.
“ For being a genius you really are an idiot.” He looked to his left and saw Steve. He didn’t know if it was his Steve or Hydra Steve or another Steve from another universe. He had in dark blue jeans and a white shirt. He wasn’t looking at him, but staring straight ahead.
Tony paled. He heard about them. Hell the Winter Solider kidnapped his parents when Howard Stark spoke against the Hydra regime. They were probably dead.
Tony hadn’t been back to the Shield compound after watching Steve ( he had stopped using the name Winghead to identify him) fuck his little buddy into oblivion. You know he wasn’t jealous. The merman was only just a nuisance anyway. He has better and bigger things to worry about. One being his company. Yes he still has a company to run. Can’t let that go neglected for too long.
Harry pulled it from the hanger and handed it to him. Peter slipped it on over his head. Harry really didn’t realize how much smaller he was compared to him despite the lean muscle covering his body.
Tony whined in frustration before moving his hips backwards.
Peter tried to step forward but he stumbled.

Please help me find the fanfiction!:)
At the familiar drawl, Steve twisted in the chair to look at him; unable to stop a slight smile tugging at the corner of his lips despite his frustration. Tony was a sight in the morning, hair tousled with sleep, his beard and moustache not yet shaved and combed back into their customary perfectly groomed shape, tie not yet in place and suspenders hanging loose down by his sides. It was a side of him no-one else got to see. Unfortunately, it meant Tony saw a side to Steve no-one else did too; and Tony had already figured out the cause of the early morning rage, his eyes drifting to Steve's trailing shoelaces.
'I made a bad decision,' Bucky said. 'Really bad. I hurt someone, and I gave them the worst possible advice. I was young and it was a different time, and they could have gotten into a ton of trouble, but...' he shrugged, downing the last of his own wine. 'I regretted it then and I have ever since. I wish I'd been braver. I wish I'd told them to do what made them happy. That was the biggest mistake I ever made.'
In traffic, the bus down town took forty minutes each way; and yet Sarah was still back in under two hours. Steve hadn't even moved from her bed. Everything was acting up and he'd developed another fever, so despite his tension he'd fallen asleep. When his mother woke him, she'd changed out of her fancy clothes and cleaned her face of the make up. She'd looked much more herself.
'Steve,' Tony said, knowing he shouldn't be smiling but unable to help it. He'd never seen Steve blushing like he was now. 'Don't worry, okay? It's a coincidence, it's based on
The song, the exact song started playing at a volume so high the vent was shaking. Peter cheered and went to look for a way out into the room. He'd like to see any monster standing up to
If Miss Rivers turned up here, he wouldn't be able to face her.
'No need to push, officer,' he said. 'He's going willingly. I'm Mr Stark's Shield liaison, I'll be accompanying you while you take him in.'
His heart began to beat again, only to be set racing. This was far from the first time he'd been sent out after the boy. Pietro was headstrong and jaded, which often turned into an explosive combination. Miss Maximoff had shame-facedly asked them not to tell Pietro about the liberties Stone had taken, and they had reluctantly agreed, because there was no way they wouldn't end up having to arrest the young man for murder. If Pietro was in trouble, it was probably going to be bad.
. He was
'Just don't break anything,' the teacher said, shaking his head and passing through the still open door. Tony barely heard him, already digging in the high-stacked drawers that lined one wall of the room for what he needed. It was going to work this time, he just knew it.
Tony snorted. ‘You don’t know Italians. I need the flowers to distract her, knock her off balance from her rage. Something that says
Tony had learnt from it though, determined not to miss out on any more love in his life, and when Steve had shown up he'd fallen in love quickly and completely, taking things slowly only for Peter's sake. Eventually, though, he'd confessed how he felt, he and Steve began dating, fell more in love, and now they had been married two years. It felt like things had finally come together. Tony had never been happier. Except now something was wrong with Peter. Tony's chest was starting to grow tight.
a voice in his head seemed to snicker,
Tony eyed the wounded orange sitting on the draining board. He doubted that.
'You don't need to rush off, do you?' Stark asked, leaning over to prop his elbow against Steve's seat. 'And after we were having such a good time.' He reached out with his other hand and squeezed Steve's thigh. 'I wouldn't want to leave the evening unfinished.'
Steve thought.
'All of them,' Bucky said stubbornly. 'Just some of 'em came along older than others.'
!' The blur said, and Steve realised,
'We're trying to help Mr Stark! Don't you understand?!'
Tony stopped. He hadn't actually expected an answer, and certainly not an answer like that, but he recovered quickly.
Steve frowned. 'That's a horrible thing to say, Stark.'
'Hey, hey, Spiderman. It's okay. We'll fix it. Just tell me what you mean. Voices?'
'Yes, well, inhaler, insulin and bed I think. I'll get this sent over as soon as it's properly dry. What's it called?'
He should probably help, Tony realised. But there really was something beautiful about watching Steve fight off assault after assault.
'Yeah? Like what?' Steve demanded. 'Because I can't think of it, and I'm guessing you haven't been able to either. Come on, Buck, I thought when you helped with the profile you were on board with this.'
Outside, the snow was still piled up against the door, but Tony no longer cared. All he needed was this moment, and if the snow lasted forever he wouldn't even care.
Steve suddenly snorted in amusement. 'That's what gets your sympathy? Not my dying four year old godson, no, the fact I can't get drunk?'
'Oh, come on, surely I can talk to him when you're right here.'
'Well, I think you should know my name is Steve.'
'…what.' He thought he heard Stark say faintly, but of course must have been mistaken.
Tony was back home, in Stark Tower, 48 hours after the trial had ended. He still didn't know what Shield was going to do with him.
, Steve noted, not sure why this surprised him either.
'It's alright,' Steve said, looking up from his phone. 'It looks like the snow's been blown up against the house because of the shape of the mountains, it's not as bad elsewhere. They're not forecasting any more snow for today and the temperature is meant to rise overnight; with luck we'll be out of here tomorrow.'
'You guys are so fun,' he said, happily. 'I like hearing about you, Steve. Before you were all this.' He waved at Steve, trying to somehow encompass his perfection in a single gesture. '
Steve no longer looked angry, but there was still a troubled crease of worry between his eyebrows. It was sort of cute. Tony resisted the surprisingly tender urge to kiss it smooth. Despite what Steve had said about sex being off the cards, Tony felt it was definitely still on the table. Possibly
. It was illegal, Thor would take him away, Tony would be arrested, strung up, no,
didn't believe in an old fashioned idea like him having a pre-determined one-and-only soul mate, but they didn't want to take things any further for totally unrelated reasons. Though, to be fair, perhaps they did. Perhaps they were put off by how short he was, or the way he was on so many medications he practically rattled when he walked, or maybe it was the crippling debt. Line up, ladies and gents.
'If the mother's meeting is quite finished,' an irritated voice called from the street; and the two of them immediately sprang apart. 'I've got a horse that needs shoeing sometime today.'
, losing Steve completely when he started talking about science; but his enthusiasm was contagious. By the time the waitress came and apologetically told them they were about to close, Steve was three-quarters in love already. As if he hadn't been from the moment Barnaby had chosen to shelter in his booth. They went outside and stood beneath a lamppost, neither of them wanting to go home just yet. They lapsed into silence.
full of concern, because how could Tony be mad at him if he seemed to care so much, how could he have done it if he cared -
'Urgh,' Tony groaned again. 'I'm glad they're having fun, and all, but do they have to be so loud? At least we're QUIET about it!' This last was directed at the wall. The banging only increased in frequency, followed by a thud of something breaking. 'And if that's another bed I'm not paying for any more!'
Stark looked, for a moment, genuinely taken aback. Then he smirked, moving a few paces closer to Steve. Steve fought the urge to back away. The gentleness that had been shown to Peter was gone; Stark was all predator now.
'I don't even care any more. I was all like 'don't push them, let them figure it out, it's up to them to talk to each other', but you know what,
It was still new, all of this. Steve wasn't quite sure how it had happened either; it had just seemed natural, organic. Ever since the team had reformed he and Tony had been sticking close together, maybe because they had been apart one way or another for so long. Eventually that had tipped over into them going out for dinner or the movies, just the two of them, and finally into going to bed together. To Steve it was obvious they were dating, so he was astonished to discover that Tony hadn't been sure, almost as astonished as Tony was to discover Steve considered him his boyfriend. Apparently Tony had just thought they were 'fooling around'. Steve had been in what he considered the future for decades now, far longer than he had been in his own time, and yet he still couldn't work out what the rules of dating were here. How could Tony not have realised it was a relationship?
'No, no, I'm sorry, forget -'
A little way away, Stark lay on the floor, wearing nothing but a plain cotton t-shirt and some boxers, looking somehow younger, or smaller, or in some way diminished. His skin was chalk-white, his hair mussed, his eyes closed.
'You know whose they are.'
'Me too,' Peter agreed, fervently. The doctors were being extremely thorough in their examinations. Apparently Peter doing forward rolls continuously on his bed for half an hour wasn't enough proof that he had been cured and they were stuck waiting for them to be completely satisfied before Peter could be discharged.
In his high chair Peter squawked indignantly and Tony remembered they hadn't finished breakfast. He went back to feeding Peter, carefully filling each spoonful and holding it up to his son's mouth. Behind him, Clint took the phone off speaker and left the room. When he came back, his eyes were glassy.
'I really don't,' Tony said, and something in his tone seemed to make Steve realise he was serious, because he finally met his husband's eyes, and although he flushed even darker there was understanding in his eyes.
'I was, and the best boots-boy in Brooklyn to pay for it.'
'Close. The ship is right over there.' Steve nodded over his shoulder. 'But... how did you know I was gone? You had him.' He nodded at the Skrull unconscious on the ground behind them.
'Yes. Mom insisted. And so the crippling debt.'
‘Noooo,’ Peter whined. ‘I want to go! Please!’ He was still wheezing, and now he was starting to cry.
'How about some music?' he said, leaning over and casually flipping the stereo on. They were immediately assaulted with a blare of brass instruments, half way through a note. It was unfortunate that the start of the song was cut off, and the sound quality was awful and crackled, but given the way Steve froze with his hand on the fridge door he had recognised it immediately.
Steve looked a little startled, but nodded. 'How many are you missing?'
Suddenly Steve remembered some of the messages from Stark he'd read on Peter's phone, the ones that had described the computer system he had running his home. Clearly it even ran the elevators.
'You hurt him,' Steve said. He didn't need to say anything else. He swung the shield as hard as he could, as hard as he ever had, and connected. The vibrations mixed in with the blaring music and the monster screamed, collapsing, trying to get away, but Steve wasn't going to let that happen.
'Have you listened to it?' He asked Peter.
'Stark,' Steve said urgently behind him. 'They're just hired goons. Try not to kill anyone!'
'I need-'
Peter giggled. Steve squeezed his hand. Peter squeezed back.
He was sent back to his room to pack, but he didn't go. There was only one thought in his brain.
Her face softened slightly. ‘That bad?’
was. If the shadows under his eyes were any indication, he'd probably been craving a quiet night on the couch too. But here he was, having fun simply because Steve was.
'Sick of
The labour had been obscenely quick, he said. If Steve hadn't forced them to leave when he did, the little boy would have been born at home or in the back of the car, and there was no way he would have survived. It was touch and go now. The baby's lungs and heart were not as strong as they needed to be. He was in something called an incubator, and honestly, that was where Steve lost track of what Richard was telling him, talking about a lot of medical processes he'd never heard of and didn't understand. Mary was okay, but the short labour had not been easy. She needed rest.
Their eyes met. The plants rustled in the breeze, surrounding them with their sweet scent. It was enough to knock loose one of the sweetpea blossoms on the trellis above their bench, and the flower fell with enough force to make them jump. They both laughed, but the moment was gone, and it didn't matter because – because. Steve pulled his own thoughts up short. He wasn't going to spend the rest of his life with this man, kissing him, loving him. He was going to spend the rest of his life chained to Tony Stark.
'Good,' Steve said. 'I'm so proud of you. I love you. Get some sleep, Tony.'
'Alright, I get it,' Stark said, tapping something into his phone and then setting it back down on the table. 'You know, I don't normally let my dates talk about their kids this much. Or at all. Or have kids in the first place.'
‘Peter, I said no!’
It was beautiful, much better than anything Steve could have achieved. Nestled in amongst the wrapping and a decorative layer of fern strands were carnations, lilies of the valley, peonies, dahlias and – yes, Steve reached forward and ran his fingers over it just to be sure – what was definitely a single dandelion, right in the middle. He was already smiling when he reached for the card that had been attached:
'Nah,' Bucky said. 'Remember they're doing this to make themselves look good. The more pathetic you look the better. No offence,' he added quickly, seeing Steve's scowl. He took the list, drawing an arrow and scribbling
Peter shook his head.
Steve frowned at the nickname, the stab of jealousy having the complete opposite effect than he assumed Tony had been going for. 'I'm not ready for my bath chair just yet, thank you.'
'That's great, kiddo,' Stark said, taking the opportunity. 'Glad you're feeling better. Mind if I talk to your Dad a second?'
'Doctor,' she said, and because she knew his next question would be if he should go and get a doctor, she added, 'Wouldn't help right away anyway.'
'I'm sorry, Peter,' Mr Osborn said, and he shook his head like he really was sad. 'I know Mr Stark helped you. But he just isn't what you think.'
‘He knows who I am.’
Steve was on the point of blacking out. He'd dropped the shield and was tugging at the tentacle with his bare hands, trying to pull it off, when the music started, so loud he flinched at the sound of it.
It took him a few attempts, tucking his chin into his chest and butting his head on the mattress, pushing upwards with his feet, until it finally happened. He rolled, all the way over, ending up looking at the ceiling, sprawled at the end of the bed. He beamed and turned onto his front, ready to do it again, but he had finally got his dad's attention.
‘I wasn’t-!’
'We say our prayers, and I think 'just one more day. If we can have just one more day, then it'll be enough. I'll be alright with it if I can have just one more day with him'. That's what I think, but then I think the same thing the next day, and the next day, and then you get a day like today and you realise... it is never going to be enough. We're not going to get enough.' His voice was shaking.
'It's, um, it's... Bar.' Barnaby had seemed so unsure when he had introduced himself, standing there, right next to the bar.
Steve nodded. 'Quickest route?'
There was a deathly pause.
Tony thought,
Thor was good at his job. Maybe even a little better than Steve would have liked; these days Thor had been out and come back with whatever bandit needed rounding up before Steve had even managed to holster his gun with his stiff hand. The residents of Timely, Steve had noticed, were increasingly seeking to come to Thor rather than him, and he tried desperately not to be jealous. The important thing was that justice was done and the citizens were protected, but it was a bit of a hard mouthful to swallow, feeling like a spare part in your own office.
'I'll be back in a second,' he told Peter, and followed Stark out into the corridor, having to jog to catch up with him.
. The armour could prove part of that, but the other half was going to be him, Tony Stark, looking like what a four year old imagined Tony Stark to look like. And that meant a suit. A tie. Tony couldn't fit one under the armour without creasing it, so he decided he would send it ahead to the hospital, change after he got the armour off. Looking sharp probably wouldn't hurt his chances with Captain Rogers, either, the grieving godfather with 6 feet of muscled body, a tight jaw, tight ass, tight, well, everything really. Tony was really looking forward to dinner.
'I don't think so,' Sarah shook her head. 'He seems quite nice. A lot nicer than his father, anyway. He was very keen to make sure I wasn't forcing you into this, Steve.'
'Hello, Peter. Are you awake?'
. She cleared her throat and continued, 'With not being on it. But I want to think about it, at least.'
Barnaby, under false pretences. Two, he wasn't sure how much longer he could hold up. His bones were aching with tiredness, with the bruises of two hard falls on the floor, of dancing. He'd rested up a little in the diner, but he wasn't sure how much more they would take.
and a reason for rejection in and of itself. In more recent times, however, it has become acceptable to 'advertise' an eligible son or daughter in the newspapers or online, providing it is the wealthy family that makes the first direct contact and expression of interest.
Tony began his usual routine for these situations. First, he checked his watch for the time and date. Then he realised the date wasn't much use to him as he couldn't remember when he had started the lab session, but he was too embarrassed to ask Jarvis. Either way, he saw it was just after 11AM, so he would be able to get the tea himself and not have to get Pepper to send someone out in the middle of the night and listen to her explain their different definitions of 'emergency' again. And, though the date didn't tell him much, he was pretty sure it meant that Happy wouldn't be around.
'Thanks,' Tony had said, playing with his cufflink because he had known that Steve would step forward to fix it for him and Tony sort of loved that, 'You sure you don't want to come? We could soon find you a tux.'
'Naturally.'
Steve couldn't help it. It was so damn
Steve looked at him. Stark was sitting on his bed wearing only breeches, his shirt hanging open. His skin was clear but for the dark marks from last night's love making, not a scar to be seen. The fact surprised him, but he wasn't sure why. Stark was only a blacksmith, you wouldn't expect to see scars anywhere but his hands.
Tony couldn't comment on that. To him, it was obvious that his dad would have been at anything that promised to be a good party. Plus, given the boasts in the programme about how every dime, nickel and penny would go to the war effort, the publicity probably hadn't hurt. The gala had taken place at the height of Captain America's popularity, just before the USO tour had headed over to Europe. It was no wonder, really, they had asked him to perform a song of his own.
It had been late. He hadn't been able to sleep, too excited about his work and college. He had decided to go to the lab. Yes, of course he had known it was after curfew, but he had gone anyway. He had got to the lab and found his key wasn't in there. He knew he couldn't ask for a teacher to let him in until morning, so he had gone to the library. That was why the boys in his dorm had said he wasn't in the room when the fire alarm went off. He had been in the library, and when the fire alarm had gone off he had waited until there was a reasonable flow of students and gone out with them, so he wouldn't be missed at the roll call. He'd had no idea that the lab was on fire, he hadn't known there was an actual fire at all. Miss Friday had probably thought it was him in the lab because, yes, normally it would be. But that night, it wasn't, it wasn't, it wasn't.
‘Why in the hell would I want you to message my kid, telling him who knows what, behind my back and without my permission?!’
It wasn't his fault. Tony was moving way too fast. They had too much complicated history to rush things; they were still trying to reconnect; in a lot of ways they still didn't even
They shook hands, and this time Steve even managed to smile.
'Yeah,' Steve smiled fondly. 'Got in a few hours ago. I came and said hi, but I think you were only half awake. I got a shower, checked on this little guy, then I had to go to a debrief that took half the night but-'
'And how old are you now?'
But as Steve looked out into the yard, he realised that the only other windows that faced it were offices and store rooms, their blinds tightly closed. Stark was low enough in the sky that this show was very much for Peter's eyes only.
'Get your suit and meet me at Shield,' he said.
'So?'
. His mother. His father. Even Tony, in his own life, had been in a coma in a high tech coffin for months; though Steve hadn't so much felt that, being stuck in his own mind at the time.
Steve got to the hospital early, but Peter was already awake and sitting up when he entered the room.
As soon as he was back in uniform, Steve felt better. They'd given him the access code to the chest soon after he had woken up, telling him all his personal effects that had come out of the ice with him were inside there, but as Steve knew that would only mean the uniform, the shield and his dog tags he had never opened it. Captain America had been a symbol of a different place, a different time, that had been lost to him forever. Steve had never planned to put it back on, and had felt far happier in the uniform of a standard Shield Agent, not standing out, just one of the team, no different to anyone else.
'Okay, okay. But you've still been getting all your meds since right? Your insulin and the rest?'
The next day, Steve wanted to go back to the shop, even though he knew Tony wouldn’t be there. His mom said no and headed to work.
On the next table, a young man looked absolutely mortified, throwing his phone down. Clearly he had been trying to take a picture of them on the sly and forgotten about the flash. Tony, however, seemed unperturbed. He simply carried on drinking his wine, crooking the finger of one hand at the waiter.
'And this is why you're on the couch,' Steve said, smiling gently. 'Closer proximity when you wake up and that happens.'
'He isn't here! You said he would be here!'
Sorry this took so long!! And it isn't proof read again >.< It's because a) life has been crazy, b) my laptop died and c) I continue to not be able to write fight scenes. I did my best with this, please enjoy the last full chapter!
Even though he knew he shouldn't, Steve found himself writing a profile for Bucky in his head.
'I'll come with you.'
, and he couldn't stop laughing, but when he looked at his dad to see if he was enjoying it too, he saw tears in his eyes, like he was about to cry. Peter stopped rolling immediately, the happy feeling pushed right out of his stomach by a much more familiar dread. He hated it when his dad was sad. But he wasn't dying any more, so his dad should be happy? Right?
'Let him try,' Steve had ground out, and ended the conversation.
Peter was pretending to be asleep, but only because he didn't have a plan right now. It seemed like a good idea to pretend to be asleep until he did. And to make a plan, you needed two things: goals, and facts.
'. True, there were some weird ideas involving swords and beer barrels, and a weird preoccupation with blessings, but overall it wasn't bad. Not bad at all.
Tony said nothing. The news was sinking in and the world was opening up. It was like when he had been given lab access, only better. Okay, so it wasn't MIT, but it was something. He was going to do college classes. He might even
For the first time, he had a pang of regret about destroying the SIM card in Peter's phone. He would have liked to have called Stark, to tell him that everything was fine, that Peter was finally
Peter giggled, then stretched out a tentative hand towards the helmet, enchanted by it. Then he remembered his manners and said, politely. 'Can I, is it alright if I touch it? Please?'
Steve did, and it was every bit as delicious as it looked. Stark's smirk grew, if possible, even wider; but Steve finished the starter anyway. It was too good to pass up for the sake of pride, and anyway, he had agreed to come out to dinner. That generally involved eating.
'Now it's really your turn, Barnes,' he challenged. 'Come on, we told you ours. Worst decision you ever made, go.'
Steve threw him a strange look, or probably did, because again,
'Helped?!' Steve barked. 'Listen to him! He's in pain!' And he released Tony slightly, only to slam him back, painfully, against the wall.
Well, never except in Afghanistan. Every so often, instead of bringing his food to the cell, they would march him out to a kind of mess hall, poke and prod him under heavy guard into the food line, to get his meagre portion when he got to the front. He had never been totally sure on why, but they always seemed to have an awful lot of soldiers and heavy weaponry around when it happened, so it had probably just been to remind him of his position. The thing was though, by the end he had almost looked forward to it, those rare glimpses of the outside world...
'No.'
'Alright, buddy,' Steve said, soothingly. 'It's okay, it's okay. Tell me all about it.'
they don't usually accept students before they get a high school diploma at the very least-'
‘You going to let him die without knowing who you really are?’

was meant to be the one adorably flustered, not him. He wasn't sure how the tables had turned, but he did not like it.
'Yeah?'
'Absolutely not.'
'I don't remember that last afternoon,' Tony said. 'I remember the rest. I will always remember the rest.'
Peter took the phone, but still looked unsure. 'Shouldn't we... kill it?' He asked.
'I'm fine.' Tony said. 'Last one there's a rotten Skrull.' With no further ado, he fired up the repulsors and flew away.
Steve ran a hand over his face. He should have realised. Of course Stark was exactly the sort of person Shield would be keeping a close eye on.
'I'm just gonna have to make sure you never want to leave me, soldier.' They had reached the warehouse now. Tony knew it was the right warehouse because there was a daisy that had pushed its way through a gap in the slabs outside, and it was growing and dying and rotting and then growing and dying and rotting over again. That was new. For a moment they stood and watched it.
idiot.
he typed.
They did, and Steve paused in his efforts to try and take in his surroundings. Clearly he was on the Skrulls' ship or base. He hoped it wasn't a ship. He knew how drastically his chance of escape fell once he was off the planet's surface.
'You realise that might be a little difficult to achieve, right?'
. She wanted to set him up with the red-head girl she hung around with. Well, it made sense. People were always thinking he and Pepper were a thing. It was the natural assumption.
(Switzerland was a long way away.)
It was months before Peter got out of the hospital, and as soon as he came home it was clear he was going to need a lot of care. Richard started working just a few hours a week from home. Mary gave up field work and switched to a desk job, just two days a week. Steve started slipping a little more money into his rent each month, took over the grocery shopping completely, and they didn't stop him. There were happy days, days where Peter was well, and they had fun. One day he pulled himself up on Steve's knees and started trying to walk. He was christened, and Steve made his promises as godfather, and felt so fiercely protective that he would have done anything to make Peter well; but there was nothing he could do. None of them could do anything. They just kept going, fitting their lives in as best they could around a constant string of check-ups, operations, hospital stays and appointments that first year.
He took off the helmet and plopped it onto Peter's head, the visor closed. It was far too big and fell right down to rest on Peter's shoulders, but judging from the boy's noises of amazement and wonder there was something spectacular inside it.
Steve looked back at the painting one last time, at the lines of yearning, and beauty, and joy, and pain, at all the things he couldn't have, and said, 'Hope.'
, was “Uuuuuuuuuh, lilies?”.’ The guests would laugh, and so would Tony, and Steve would blush; but Tony would squeeze his hand and Steve would smile.)
'No, no,' he said. 'We don't romanticise jealousy, Cap. That's a short cut to an unhealthy relationship.'
Steve felt his eyes watching him all the way down the hall.
'No.'
Tony snorted. 'Uh, what do you take me for? You would
'Someone will recognise me,' he said, a token protest.
'Does he work here?'
It wasn't exactly hard to track them. Peter walked down the street, following the trail of people crying or screaming, smashed-up stuff and overturned cars. Before long he caught up with the handful of Shield agents that had made it from the house and was worried they would catch him, but they didn't even notice, too busy trying to stop everyone from panicking and running into each other. Everyone was talking about 'the monster', the sighting of someone in a Captain America outfit, but no-one seemed to know what to do.
Beside him, Steve coughed. 'Urrgh, what is that? That is terrible.' Then he put the straw back in his mouth and carried on drinking.
'Four now,' his mom called from the table. 'Five. Six. Seven! Steve, you've never been so popular.'
'You scared me, popping out like that, Mr Stark,' he said cheerily. 'But then it looks like I scared you too. Work all finished, is it? Right you are, let me just put this away and I'll get out of your hair.'
and now, here Tony was, catching him in the act.
'Not every history book,' Steve said. 'I'm not in the medieval ones. Or any of the pre-1940s ones.'
He tried to go back to sleep, willing himself to escape the shame, to get better, so he could get up tomorrow, be
'No more dying?'
when a newspaper article (5) suggested domestic slaves, usually women, were being forced into Charity Marriages with white servants or less-important relatives of the family in order to keep them in the house so that their free labour could continue to be exploited.
Steve had wondered if they were dating, or interested in each other. Rhodes had corrected this notion in the strongest terms of disgust. Steve had seemed very happy, according to Rhodey.
He got to the hospital early the next morning, so early that Peter wasn't even awake yet. For a moment, Steve hung in the doorway to his room, watching him. Peter slept with his arms flung out, like he was ready to embrace the whole world. His hair was tousled on the pillow, his breathing rough and wheezing despite the tube pumping extra oxygen into his body. The precious phone was still on the pillow next to him, alongside Spinny, a cuddly spider toy that Richard had bought Mary on their first date, a trip to the zoo. Feelings were spinning in Steve's chest that he wasn't able to identify.
. You said that film
Despite what they might say when they were asked, most of the Avengers agreed that the benefits of living with Tony Stark outweighed the inconveniences. True, he could be untidy, leaving screws and bits of circuit board littered all over the place; and on the other hand screech like a Stepford Wife at coffee grounds left in the disposal or wet towels put back on the rail instead of in the wash. He kept odd hours and blasted music loudly enough to shake the whole place, and had been known more than once to use every pot and pan in the kitchen and most of the contents of the fridge just trying to make an omelette. On the other hand, though, they were living rent-free, utilities included; they had the best wifi in the city, amazing views, the best quality furniture, a pool, a roof garden, and two hot tubs. And then, at this time of year, the whole place transformed into a kind of Christmas grotto, cosy and warm, and festivity wherever you looked. To Tony, if you were going to do something, you ought to do it properly.
'Steve, are we one hundred percent sure you're not about to marry a serial killer?'
He realised then that Tony was speaking. Steve’s guilt spiral had momentarily drowned him out, and now he had no idea what Tony had lied about and no idea how to react.
The transition was gentle this time. Before it was like riding the rapids, crashing through different identities until he caught on one, but now it was like drifting in, riding a raft on a calm sea on a sunny day. Perhaps it was because he knew exactly where he was going this time. He had felt it there, throbbing with pain, ever since this experience had begun. He fiddled with the cufflinks, trying to get them done up.
He could feel the multiverse. They got it wrong so much more often than they got it right. But it was always them. They always found each other, no matter what.
'Steve,' she said, perching on one of the breakfast stools. 'I've booked another appointment with the therapist.'
He was getting into a black car with Jan and the rest of the original team line up, trying not to cry. He was rolling over to gather his wife into his arms. He was chasing after Tony, right out onto the streets of Timely, to tell him he loved him no matter who was watching. He was asking the cute barista for his number, allowing the alien to reach out and touch him so they could communicate, reaching up to get the books in the library for the hot guy on the engineering course, he was running backstage ignoring the cries for an encore in favour of seeking out the roadie he loved, he was lovingly reminding his ageing husband that they had already been married forty years when he was proposed to yet again, he was telling his king that he had saved him for reasons more than a knight's duty, he was taking Tony in his arms and kissing him, kissing him, kissing him -
He still felt guilty over even this small lie. He prided himself on his honesty, and yet, when the truth would lead to disappointing someone, it was like his brain clicked off. He’d panic and lie and get himself into a much bigger mess. He just couldn’t bear to have let people down, even though he knew, really, the lie was letting them down more.
Tony's eyebrows shot up. He resisted the urge to wolf whistle. He couldn't imagine Steve being caught in a cupboard with anyone.
The tendrils that had grown out of his suit to fit around the door did not retreat, but remained, streaming around Stark like tattered clothes. If anything, they were growing thicker, and stronger. There were more of them too, not just from his fingers, but everywhere, a seething, roiling mass of black. Stark took up most of the hall now, knocking over vases and ornaments, bumping off doorframes, and it was all Steve could do to follow along in his wake.
Tony didn't deserve it, and Jarvis deserved so much better. There was nothing Tony could do to make it up to him, but there was at least one thing he could put right.
(Even though it hadn’t happened because of Tony’s touch.)
Steve was smiling at him, which made Tony giggle more, which made Steve laugh.
ridiculous; the situation itself or the way it had come about. Because the road to this moment had started months before, when Shield had turned out to be riddled with Hydra double agents, when the helicarrier had crashed, and when Tony had visited Steve in the hospital only to be told, slowly and haltingly and so, so sorrowfully, that his parents hadn't died in an accident at all. That they had been murdered by Hydra. By the man now standing in the hall of his parent's mountain retreat, glaring at the snow piled up in the door frame as if the look alone could melt it.
Steve sighed. It hurt when Bucky did this, as if Steve hadn't been going over and over it continuously in his head, especially since meeting Barnaby. He hadn't dared let himself text. He also hadn't dared tell Bucky or Sarah that he had met his soulmate, because he knew they would force him to call the whole thing off. Because Barnaby was his soulmate, that
Mr Stark and his dad had both been at the hospital, and would know what had happened by now. Which meant that Iron Man was probably already on his way, and his dad was strong too. This guy wouldn't stand a chance. But it might take them a while to find him.
'He seems to be doing much better.'
There could be no more delays. Tony pushed through the door onto the stage and was immediately assaulted by the flashes of cameras as he came and stood before the assembled press. There had been a time when he would have been introduced by a member of staff, or the head of the organisation. Now he stood there alone, waiting for the clamour to die down.
, with a great deal of suggestion in his eyes, but Steve couldn’t think about that. Not in the workplace. Nope.
better,' Peter protested. He didn't get why his dad didn't understand. Mr Stark had fixed him, and everything Mr Stark did would work like it was meant to. But then he had been really sick, and probably dying, so maybe his dad just hadn't managed to turn off the worry part of his brain yet. He wished Mr Stark was still here, so he could explain.
'I have to- I didn't say goodbye.'
His fingers and toes were starting to hurt from clinging on for so long. And it was windy, being up so high, so he was frozen. The glass wall, too, seemed to be made from sheer ice. Peter reached, lost his grip, and scrambled to try and get it back.
'The only thing that will bother me is if you keep living half a life,' Tony answered. 'It's Christmas, Cap. Nearly New Years. It's the season for magic, miracles and fresh starts.'
'Don't sit down,' he said, not wanting the sheltering stranger to get kicked in the head, but it didn't look like Bucky was staying.
'Yes, sir.'
'You know my bank account is basically bottomless, right? I have to spend it on something.'
'Well, why don't we just put 'extensive medical history'?'
'Bar?'
But this wasn't Afghanistan. He could see the outside world through the windows just fine, and if the people around him in the queue had guns, they probably wouldn't just wave them around willy-nilly. Even in New York, it was too early for that sort of nonsense. Besides, Tony really wanted that bubble tea. And so, he shuffled into the line.
ask. But as her stomach clenched painfully again, desperation made it clear there was no other choice.
Tony could feel a headache coming on. 'Can we just skip to the part where you tell me what's happening?'
'No thank you,' he said.
'I tried to get out of it,' Tony said, desperately. 'I tried to get a deal. But he wanted to carry on and meet anyway.'
'Stark has permission to be in here, you boys don't.' Meredith jerked her head at the door. 'Get out before I give you all detention.'
stupid an idea. 'I don't exactly have a lot of choice here, Buck. We're up to our necks in debt, and it's my fault. If I don't do something, we won't even make rent.'
'I don't know,' Peggy said, and turned to him with mischief in her eyes. 'I'd suggest there's only one way to find out.'
. 'Just wrapping up.'
It was almost an hour after their last tête-à-tête in the hallway outside Peter's room. It had taken them that long to process what was happening, to coax Peter down off the wall, hear his story ('
For a moment, he actually thought he had gotten through. Stark's eyes seemed to clear, but then cloud back into confusion. He wondered again if Stark was on something, some drug Steve didn't know about, but then he blinked and the haze had gone, replaced with cocky amusement.
'He used to flirt like that with any girl that came within a fifteen foot radius.'
Tony laughed. 'Never knew you were such a pedant. So, how come it's such a big secret? If I as Captain America everyone would know about it. Worried some faceless government corporation is going to come and start running experiments on you? Because if so, I have some things to tell you about Shield, sweetpea.'
'Sorry, kid, my friend here doesn't like music,' Tony said, tapping the flight suit and wondering why he was telling Peter this. To build trust, he supposed, because Peter would need to trust him for what was going to happen next.
'It's okay,' Tony said automatically, even though he wasn't sure it was yet. 'We'll work it out. Jarvis, where is Steve?'
'Oh, Steve,' she said, reaching out for his hand; but he moved his away before she could take it. 'I'm sure it wasn't your fault. And you mustn't lose hope, not if... is this person still alive?'
Steve did know, because he felt the same way about Tony, and he had said so. Tony had kept hold of his hand, rubbing his thumb in gentle circles over Steve's skin, until he had fallen back to sleep.
Oh, no. Tony was right. And Steve had gotten it so, so wrong.
'Inhaler,' he said. Asthma, then. Punishment, probably; fate making Steve even more pathetic because he dared to complain about it. He dug out his inhaler and gave himself a couple of doses, feeling his chest begin to ease almost immediately.
'We'd better get going,' Thelma, the mother – Wanda's daughter? Pietro's? - said, and scooped the child up. 'See you soon, Uncles.' She kissed them both on the cheek, and made her way down the steps to the street. Tony looked a little bereft. He would have liked to have had children, Steve thought. He wondered if Tony regretted it.
'Midtown,' Barnaby replied. 'Do you know the Family Law Library and Legal Aid? Just opposite there.'
‘What?’
Tony looked around the cell. As it was used for those awaiting trial, not those already convicted, it wasn't as bad as it could have been. He had a bed, a chair, even a desk. And absolutely no tech, and nothing to do but think.
It was the sort of call you didn't ignore, no matter what the circumstances. Steve raced back into the room, Stark hot on his heels.
, the expression that drove Tony wild – 'Well, since you're asking, sure,' he said, and then they were laughing, and kissing, and Tony was calling him every bad name he could think of, because,
Steve pulled her into a hug.
'It's always like this with dating sites,' Bucky said in his trying-to-be-reassuring voice. 'You get a flurry of weirdos at the beginning who message every new profile, then it settles down after a while.'
'Don't apologise,' she said, desperately. 'Just tell me what's wrong.'
'I'm sorry,' he said, suddenly, and Natasha blinked at him because Steve had been great and she didn't have the least idea what he was talking about. But he carried on. 'I had no idea what it was like. I didn't want to know, I never even thought about it. But you're a member of my team, and if you have to go through this
It wasn't going to work. There was no rise and fall in Peter's chest, no change. The mask started to fog slightly as the air built up inside it. Steve stroked his hair.
'Oh, Tony, Tony, sweetheart, no, they're not... I didn't.... they're mine.'
'It's good to finally meet you in person,' Tony said, lifting Angela's hand to his lips.
'Do you want to share it with the group?'
Tony and Steve stared at the book, Steve turning over the pages in quiet and bewildered amazement. Tony had to give it to Thor, it really was the perfect wedding for them. A small, intimate and informal ceremony, with a splash of prayers to the '
Note: The song referenced (and somewhat exaggerated) here is 'I Believe in a Thing Called Love' by the Darkness, which you should all listen to if you haven't already :)
after the sun.'
'You'd better,
After a few minutes basking in the blissful cold by the door, it occurred to Tony that nobody had yet acknowledged him or come to see what he wanted. In fact, if anything, the two baristas (did you still call them baristas in a bubble tea shop?) seemed to be deliberately
Yet, he had a hunch, a gut instinct that maybe this wasn't the sort of person Stark really was, that the other man wasn't in his right mind. That 'flight suit' moved like a living thing, and it was spreading even as he watched, so that Stark was completely encased up to his chin.
'What? Steve?'
After the argument, Steve had waited in Tony's room for over an hour before giving up and leaving himself. After that, it was only another hour or so until the warning went off and the Avengers were required to assemble again. When Steve arrived, Tony was already there – wearing the armour, his face hidden. He didn't say anything to Steve.
'Thank God,' Tony had said, breathily, squeezing Steve's good hand, and Steve knew he meant it literally. He was thanking a God Steve suspected he didn't even believe in that the fever had broken. Steve had smelt the whiskey on his breath with the words, but Tony was at least not quite as deep in his cups as usual. 'Thought I'd killed you with my meddling,' Tony had said, hoarsely, and tears built in his sore eyes. 'You're my whole world, Steve, you know?'
Steve processed what he said and was immediately all business. 'What are you saying, Tony?'
Steve said nothing. He hated the chatty ones. And he was trying to think of a way to get home from, presumably, being scattered to the multiverse. Or better yet, a way to avoid it happening in the first place.
'So, out of the sky.'
Still, it wasn't so bad. He'd found he could save a lot when Peter was in hospital by simply not using any electricity. A candle was enough to get him to bed, and it was kind of nice. It reminded him of his childhood, when the supply had been unreliable at best and power cuts sometimes went on for days. The back streets of Brooklyn had not exactly been a priority during the shortages of the Depression. In any case, the best ghost stories were told by candlelight.
colours. Just… mine don’t look the same as everyone else’s. So I work by saturation levels and figure if it looks good to me, it will to other people too. It’s only a problem when…’ he trailed off, shrugging.
. But he didn't know where home was.
'No it isn't!' Steve snarled. 'It wasn't you! You don't even remember what happened!'
He could follow Steve inside, get what he wanted from him.
'They
Steve saw red. He turned, marching towards where Stark held Osborn. Obviously Stark wasn't holding tightly enough, because the bastard still had enough air to speak.
'And to the families of those that Venom, Iron Man, that I hurt or killed, often on little to no pretext: they deserved better, and so do you. My apologies are meaningless, they aren't going to undo anything, but... what I, what Iron Man did, was not justice. It wasn't fair or right, and I know nothing I can do will make that better. I just hope that my, uh, momentary arrest will offer some small comfort.'
But it had still hurt, and he hadn't been able to sleep properly, and everything was all mixed up in his head, and he knew he had heard his dad and Mr Stark talking and talking for
. Love at first sight and all that crap. And the only word he could get out, the only thing he could say to his literal
got so bad it was like it exploded out of his stomach and had made an alarm go off in his head, and Peter tried to pull away, but Mr Osborn didn't let him, holding him tight and pulling him from the room. And Peter knew he had been really stupid, because obviously Mr Osborn had been the guy in the goblin mask, and now he had Peter captured and was pulling him from the room, and there was nothing at all Peter could do about it.
'Okay, hold on.'
'Hold up, Tony. I heard back from the California Institute of Technology.'
?' He couldn't say it in public. 'Stark, you started on that
'You are intruding in the vents,' Jarvis said.

Fury nodded. 'Well then, Widow, get me some evidence. Find out what Stark has to do with this. And someone get me a status update on Peter Parker!'
'Buck!'
but he couldn't hold onto any of them, he didn't know which was his, which he was; the stone of the wash basin was cold beneath his hands, he was vomiting into it, the taste was sour and bitter in his mouth, but it wasn't his mouth, it was another Steve's mouth, and yet it
(Bucky would not mention this part, in his speech.)
'No,' Steve said, shortly, dropping into the chair next to the desk he so clearly wasn't going to be invited to use. 'I can't. Messes with my medication. Messes me up.' He decided not to mention the beer from the other night and looked pointedly at the glass in Stark's hand. Stark laughed.
'Wow.'
But there was no laws against topping and tailing in a bed as wide as Tony's. Even if sometimes, in the dark, Tony would run his toes up Steve's calves and make him shiver. There were no laws against that, either. Still, people were talking more than usual. It made him nervous, but he comforted himself with the thought that he was the only lawman in town. If Timely wanted him arrested, they'd have to get someone else in to do it and they'd surely catch wind and have time to run before that could happen.
'Shield? Why?'
'Just get the most expensive brand,' the man said. 'And chocolate.'
‘Yeah?’ Tony half smiled, thought for a moment, and then said decisively, ‘Dandelions. They’re my favourite.’
The elevator moved so quietly that Steve wasn't even sure it was moving until a moment later the doors opened and he stepped in. The doors slid shut, and Steve realised that there were no buttons. It was possible he had just walked right into Venom's trap, shut himself in a small steel box. He was about to try and force the doors when a polite, accented voice asked him 'Which floor?'
either. My dad...' he trailed off, shrugging again. 'Parents, huh?'
Sometimes being emotionally mature sucked ass. An ass apparently improved by high heeled shoes.
'Uh-huh.'
. It was hard not to take ‘girly’ as an insult when it was intended as one.
'I forgot you even had some of these,' Bucky said, scanning the list of conditions. 'Wait, do we need to mention the TIAs you had in high school?'
‘You let that monster near your kid?’
, now, and there was one way to get rid of a man it was to tell the truth. 'It's girl trouble.'
Steve nodded. Tony huffed. One of the tabloids had decided the best way to celebrate their nuptials back in the summer was to do a 'countdown' formed of interviews with Tony's old flames, everything from ex-girlfriends and boyfriends to drunken one night stands he didn't even really remember. He and Steve had talked about them. They had both agreed that it was a bad idea for either of them to read them, that the best thing to do was ignore them, not to let it ruin things. It seemed Steve hadn't been able to resist.
'Look, I don't remember anything after the summer, and I don't have time to deal with whatever this is. So unless you want to explain, drop the glaring.'
''s nice,' he muttered. 'But I have to... I lied to you.'
Steve shushed him with a wave of his hand, clearly just wanting to get his story over and done with. 'Well, in her interview, she said... she said you liked... that sort of thing.' Steve nodded at the underwear, now hanging limp from Tony's hand. 'Lingerie. So I thought... well. But it's not like I could try it on so I just ordered it online and I think I'd already changed my mind but then it came and it was way too small for me and I-'
. The question was driving him crazy, going round and round in his head, over and over again so fast it was practically a buzzing,
Tony could pin him to the wall right there and then, get what he wanted, and never see him again. He could take him and then crush his skull and watch him die. He could be on his way in ten minutes, back to his normal life.
'Yeah. So what did he make of you flirting with Santa to get him to spy on your girlfriend?'
'I won't,' Steve said, and he meant it as he finally,
'There was a hole in the garden!' Steve declared dramatically, opening his legs and letting Peter gently drop through them to the floor, making the little boy squeal in delight, laughing with a gurgle like a sink, before trying to pull himself up on Steve's knees to do it all over again. Steve laughed.
It was harder climbing up the car than it had been climbing the hospital wall. He was still a little scared, and the car wobbled, and the windows were all broken which meant he had less surface to use and there were shattered bits of glass all around. But just like his dad had always told him when he was sick and trying to do stuff, he just had to do one step at a time. Slowly, he inched his way on top of the car and balanced along the length of it. He wanted to stop when he got to the end and work out the right angle and force for his jump, but there was no time. He didn't want to be spotted, and his dad and Mr Stark needed his help now, so he didn't even stop to think before launching himself off the car and onto the fence.
in Japan and particularly
He had a crap ton of therapy. It turned out he was a bag full of issues, some of which had nothing to do with Venom at all.
Steve swallowed. 'What's going to happen to that guy?'
'Oh, great, me too,' Stark said. 'I'm a big, big, fan. What a great guy. I bet I'm higher in the fan club than your kid.'
‘Yes!’ Steve said, seizing on the idea. It sounded right. He took some blooms out of the rose bucket and placed them with the others on the counter.
'Stark!' Thor's cheery voice came, and Steve turned to see the deputy approaching. Like Tony, Thor had dressed for the occasion, looking rather dashing in a deep red coat that reached almost to his knees, his long hair pulled back. On his arm was a tall, striking woman with masses of flowing red hair and an imposing expression. She didn't smile as they came near.
Steve blinked at him. It was as if his brain had shorted out when the guy had thrown the door open like a violent gust of wind. You never got high school boys in here, at least, not on their own. Around prom there would be a few reluctant suitors dragged in by their mothers to buy corsages, but that was about it. This guy was alone. He was also, Steve couldn’t help but notice, beautiful. Stunning. Steve’s tongue tied into knots just looking at him. But the exquisitely tailored suit he was wearing was all black, meaning he must be on his way to a funeral, meaning Steve
Tony's hands balled into fists. 'You made him do it,' he said. He was certain of it, even if he didn't know the details. Somehow, Howard had forced Steve. He must have done.
He then launched into a detailed description of some complicated system of counting on his fingers where each one was worth twice the amount of the one before. Steve didn’t entirely get it, but Peter obviously did, and Steve was suitably impressed.
'Try again!'
'I'm all for the
. Tony snorted at that. Steve and Peggy had barely gotten started. Steve had married him.
'Then
They had cancelled Peter's party on the ward for this. In the end, Stark had been adamant – he was coming to see Peter, and just Peter. The more kids that were there, the more chance there was of proof of his identity coming out. So Peter had been moved to a tiny private room tucked into a corner of the hospital, looking out into the courtyard where the hospital kept the bins and took deliveries, and hardly anyone passed by in the corridor outside. True to form, Peter had not complained once. Then again, the move seemed to have tired him out; now the excitement of the gifts had faded, he was barely awake, nuzzled into Steve's side. He was wheezing, even though they were sitting still. Steve listened to his breathing, but decided no, there was no need for medical intervention just yet. He shifted slightly, making Peter sit more upright, hoping it would be enough to ease the strain on his chest. He started running his fingers gently through Peter's hair. Peter curled into him a little more.
Steve chanted in his head like a mantra. Sure, he had learnt to fly the jets – eventually – but spaceships were a bit outside of his skill set. He just needed a window.
Bucky winced. 'Can you please not make jokes about the ever present spectre of death hanging over you?' He squeezed Steve's shoulder. 'It's alright for you. You'd be dead. I'd be the one left here doing the grieving thing.'
'Okay, chipmunk,' he said, with as much cheerfulness in his voice as he could muster. 'Let's go sit on the couch. I've heard there's a risk of holes in my garden.' And if his voice trembled, Peter didn't notice.
'I'm everything he's too scared to do! I am Venom!'
in the future. There were hundreds of TV channels. You could go to restaurants and taste food from almost anywhere in the world practically on your doorstep. It seemed like every basic appliance and piece of furniture was customisable to exactly what you wanted. Everything came in twenty colours and shapes. There were entire shops that only sold coffee and yet still managed to have a menu full of options. If you went to Subway, you not only chose a sandwich, you had to choose how big you wanted it, and what bread you wanted it on, and what ingredients should go in the salad. The future was amazing.
'W-what did you do?' Steve asked, stroking Peter's hair again.
'Yeah,' Tony said, cuddling Peter closer to him. 'Don't worry, bean. I'll protect you from Papa's unsavoury ways.'
Steve huffed in exasperation and decided that if Stark wasn't going to leave, he would. He grasped the handles of the buggy again, and turned to go. He was stopped by Stark's hand on his arm.
Tony shrugged, couldn't quite meet his eye. 'You never lie to me, Steve. This bozo showed up the day after the fight saying you'd
. But for now, he would just have to keep saying no.
'Need you to look after this for me,' he said, unable to meet Bucky's eye. Bucky nodded, didn't say anything, because what was there to say? They'd all been there. He left Steve with the baby in the kitchen, took the gun, and buried it deep in his back yard. There were some things you just didn't want your kids to find.
'You are not authorised to enter,' Jarvis said again, 'Please have a nice day.'
In the meantime, please enjoy this chapter, also known as: WikketKrikket cannot write fight scenes. But as an early draft literally just said 'fight scene fight scene fight scene anyway', I hope you'll agree it's at least an improvement ;) Enjoy and thanks for reading!
The space wasn't huge, but it didn't change the fact that it was the most beautiful place Steve had ever been. Barnaby flipped a hidden switch near the doors and the place flooded with light; small footlights buried beneath plants, LEDs in the wooden walkways and trailed round the trellises. Truthfully, Steve had never been that interested in abstract art, but this garden was full of shapes; made of steel or stone or glass, all of them flowing like liquid, all of them catching the lights just right to seem alive. The plants and flowers had been perfectly chosen to compliment them, growing below and around and above and into them, the wind stirring them gently, releasing a delicate array of scents, making the whole place seem like a single breathing entity. It was possibly the most magical place he had ever been. Steve staggered onto a bench and sat, Barnaby coming to join him a moment later. Somewhere he could hear water running. There must be a pond or a waterfall tucked away someone he hadn't looked yet.
It was no good. Steve just didn't get it. Here he was, with first hand knowledge of how horrible losing part of yourself was, and his teachers were asking him to pretend to be someone who
? They were shooting string and confetti everywhere. At least the audience were watching them and not him as Steve stumbled from the stage, nearly tripping down the steps.
'Consider it done,' Tony said, and from his pleased expression Steve was oddly certain that he had already planned and made the things. 'Anything for my Clementine on his birthday.'
'Well, one hint of bad behaviour and I'll haul you back here and put you in basic science to see how quickly a marble rolls down a chute with the kindergarteners.'
‘Not everything.’
'It's lunchtime, Stark, you need to eat before you work.'
Here, Tony was dead. Dead in a way that it would probably stick this time, not in glorious but convoluted battle, where there was some hope of a loop hole or a way back, not going out in a blaze of heroism, saving the universe. Just dying, the way everyone else died. Dying as a human.
'Start with the ribbon,' Steve instructed, issuing the command in his most Captain America-y voice, so that Tony grumbled but picked up the ribbon and started trying to get it to stay in place. It was a fiddly job – Tony was a damn engineer and he couldn't get it to stay in place, the shiny ribbon sliding around on the waxy skin – but seeing Steve sitting opposite him, watching the progress, beaming, just made him go weak at the knees. He'd do anything to keep that smile on his face.
"No you're not" he looks up at him blushing,   " I-I said that out loud??" Steve smiles genuinely at him, its been a long time since he saw someone look at him like that. Before he knew it a tear escaped his eyes. Steve panics "D-Did I make you cry? I'm sorry!" The shorter waves his hands around "N-No! Its just true! I fuck up alot" "Language" Steve mumbles, "Oh....sorry...I'm just used to swearing" "Maybe it's time to get used to not swearing then" the taller smirks.
'What, seriously?' Bucky asked, and Steve pulled out his cheek to show the back of his top row of teeth, which was indeed gap free.
The principle had not believed him. Nobody believed him, even when he tried to argue that he knew what he was doing in the lab and wouldn't have caused a fire. His parents didn't believe him. Jarvis didn't believe him, and was on his way to pick him up right then. Tony was permanently and immediately excluded, and there might be a criminal investigation. Two newspapers had already phoned.
'We're a team, buddy. We look after each other.'
'Tony,' Steve said, not sure how he was going to finish the sentence, but Tony cut him off with one of his brilliant smiles that didn't quite get to his eyes.
'We don't kill, Peter, that's what makes us the good guys.'
. And tomorrow, he would get the Avengers in and explain what he had found out.
'Well, isn't this cosy?' Fury said, eyeing the pancakes. He came and put a brown folder down in front of each of them. 'Orders, boys.'
'Alright, Jarvis,' he said, as he re-entered his lab. 'We are officially on lock down. I'm about to save an orphan so I can seduce his father.'
The next day, Tony came back again, startling Steve. He’d been sitting at the counter, writing on the back of an old receipt all the lies he had told Tony
Hesitantly, Peter reached out and took his hand. Immediately the feeling of the
For once, the fight wasn't so much as fight as it was crowd control. The WW2 bomber, complete with confused Japanese fighter pilot, had been quickly followed by the horse and cart of a terrified milk man from the 20s, and then by an entire building that according to Steve had been a law firm at the turn of the 20
'I fly, you hold on,' Stark said, coming up behind him and without further ado wrapping his arms around Steve's waist. 'Damn,' he said, 'Did the serum grow everything but your hips? How do you not snap in two? You're shaped like an equilateral triangle, like, 45 degrees all over, I'm serious. The uniform suits you, by the way. Welcome back.'
'Nearly 10 dollars for two drinks,' Steve grumbled, politely declining to notice how Tony snatched the drink away from him and slurped greedily at it. Tony barely noticed his words, drinking his bubble tea like his life depended on it, which it honestly might at this point. He sort of remembered the bots bringing him sandwiches and glasses of water and many, many cups of coffee over the last 6 days, but he couldn't remember how much he had actually eaten or drunk. Not much, from the looks of things.
He ran back to the bathroom, chest heaving, and grabbed his mom's make up mirror from the side of the sink, before returning to his own room and the small mirror screwed to the back of his wardrobe door. It took a few agonising seconds to get lined up and the mirrors angled correctly, his hands shaking so badly that he dropped the make up mirror twice. Finally, he was able to see the back of his own neck and he brushed the ends of his hair away, pulled the collar of his pyjamas down, and sure enough, there was the blemish, the finger print of his soulmate, now coloured gently golden, very much alive.
'Look at him!' Pepper said, waving at Tony. 'Look at him, Steve, does he
'This!' Tony said, waving the list, annoyed beyond belief that Steve was acting like he didn't get it, like he hadn't been at least emotionally cheating -
Steve looked away, ashamed. 'It's fine,' he said. 'Go back to bed, I'll keep it down.'
At first he had thought Meredith must be one of the parents. He'd seen her impeccable dress, her thick brown hair, seen that she couldn't have been older than 35 at the absolute most, and seen how Howard immediately turned on the charm; and thought that Howard would not flirt with one of his teachers. Except he would, and he did, and the older he got the less Tony could blame him. Meredith had a strong, lilting Irish accent that came out from behind a no-nonsense smile that seemed to send all the male teachers and older guys gaga. She introduced herself as what she called 'The Head of Lower School' and which actually translated to being the one in charge of the 8-12 year olds. The kids that liked her nicknamed her 'Auntie Meredith'. The ones that didn't called 'The Babysitter'. Tony was one of the kids that liked her. She neither went all gooey about his abilities like most of the adults Tony met, nor ignored them like his Dad. Instead she called him into meeting after meeting in her office, challenged him about playing up in class, actually
'It's just, Bucky tried once and-'
that he couldn't help laughing; and once he had started he couldn't stop, and then Tony was laughing too, and they were kissing and kissing and kissing, and Steve didn't give a damn if it was cheesy, he didn't want this ever to end. Not for the rest of their lives.
Still, he made pancakes for breakfast, and that was good enough for Tony.
And then he had woken up, and felt
'Stark,' he called, over the rushing wind. 'Tell me about your flight suit.'
‘When did he show you?’ He asked.
'No,' Tony protested again, but Steve had taken him by the shoulders and was gently-but-firmly pushing him into one of the seats around the table. He was only using one hand, splayed so wide that it spilt across Tony's shoulder and collarbone, palm on Tony's chest, where Tony was sure he would be able to feel his heart starting to pound; but if Steve noticed he said nothing, instead using his free hand to deftly scoop up another orange and place it resolutely down on the chopping board, squarely in front of Tony.
'Shield assignment,' Steve said. 'They needed someone to keep an eye on you. Make sure you're alright. And... Captain America was seen on the streets of New York. I wanted to lie low a little.'
Tony thought,
'What about you?' He asked. 'I need to know who to address the thank you card to.'
In the end, though, he didn't have to. Because he'd muted Jarvis to listen to the recording, and was just hearing it for the sixth time when Steve's voice – his real life voice, not covered by crackles from seventy years ago – said, 'Tony?'
'Now!'
'Can you just help me?'
He was so turned on right now.
Tony nodded, not daring to argue. Pepper took a deep breath. 'Good. And as for
'How?' Bucky demanded. 'Steve, we've been like brothers since the day you were born. I know everyone you know; least I thought I did. So, who is he?'
After a few more notes from the instruments, Steve's voice came on the recording, smooth and sweet.
'Oh, that one's just spam. It must generate when a profile is added. Maybe they're all – oh, no, this one is genuine – Sixty-seven years old?! I don't care how rich you are, I won't – Oh! That's disgusting! No I will not 'rent' my son for a night, number three – or to you number four – this person wants to know your sperm count, guess they're desperate for kids? - This one is spam, this one is just a penis, this one wants to see
Back then, Steve had been living in a six feet square room just behind his office. It had a bed, a closet, a desk and chair, and a wash stand. Steve had thought this was quite sufficient to his wants. Tony had strongly disagreed, and one night, heavy in drink, had tried to buy him a house. Steve had been forced to lock him in a cell after all, that night, until the effects of the drink had worn off.
be, I just...' he took a deep breath. He was making a mess of this. 'But I saw plenty of worlds where I didn't have you, where I had lost you, and they were all terrible. So I'm not there yet, Tony, but that doesn't mean I'm not in this for the long haul. I'll get there. And I won't give up until I am.'
Tony hesitated, then slipped it off his finger, holding it out in the palm of his hand. 'Okay, Cap,' he said, quietly. 'But don't leave me waiting too long.'
'I'm sorry, Tony,' he said, earnestly. 'I know you like compliments, I just...' he trailed off, awkwardly, and Tony couldn't help but kiss him. Steve responded gently but briefly, so Tony pulled away. Steve couldn't meet his eyes again. 'I just don't know how to compliment men. I've never done it before. I was never much good sweet talking girls either but...' he blew out a huff of air. 'I guess I was thinking that maybe if I wrote down what I was thinking, I'd be able to find a way of, you know, translating it-'
. He hadn't given it much thought, but he had vaguely assumed they were some sort of female equivalent to a condom.
– and wrapped his arms around him as best as he could, pulling him close. For a second, Tony was stiff, but then relaxed, nuzzling his face into Steve's shoulder.
'Bastard,' Stark said. He looked at Steve, who was standing still, guarded. 'He killed my favourite teacher. Practically.' He sounded almost defensive.
'Good,' Stark said, and went back to leading the way.
But to Peter, Iron Man was a hero who saved the day, and Steve couldn't take that away from him. Not now. And while six months ago he would never have endorsed anything that perpetuated that image, if an Iron Man duvet cover from Redbubble meant Peter would sleep at night, Steve would buy him a damn Iron Man duvet cover. If a red-and-gold paint job meant Peter would let him connect the oxygen tank at night, Steve would paint it red-and-gold. Steve had been forced to learn the hard way over the last few years that principles were a luxury. He would never have considered coming to a place like this, otherwise.
'Yeah,' Bucky said, finishing heating the milk and sitting down to give it to Tim. 'Why aren't you?'
'I think it was more than that. He didn't explicitly say so, but I think he
(‘So the love of his life walked through the door,’ Bucky would say, years later, in his best man speech. ‘And Steve knows it, right? He
'I... I was thinking. What about those experiments, in the 40s? The super soldier experiments. If we could get something like the serum then-'
Tony wondered what exactly the goal was. To scare him into obedience? That seemed more likely than them pushing him into this cubbyhole and leaving him to die. They needed him to mend the suit. And yet, he couldn't get the kid's face out of his mind as he had opened the door. He had been terrified, they all had, that was why they had made their most-expendable member take the locks off. Yinsen had said there was a monster in here.
Steve thought, then,
‘Okay,’ Peter said, and Steve had no idea what he was thinking.
‘Uh, I’m sure she won’t be that mad,’ he offered, lamely, hoping the lie was something suitably minor and not that Tony had hidden a dead body somewhere.
A chapter in which my English-ness is showing... at least I don't think Christingles are really done in the US. But they're fun and a bit hookey, so I decided to have them make one :) Enjoy!
For a moment Thor was shocked, but then, what more natural than a proposal in the heat of battle? When the blood was racing, when the danger brought all passions to a fever pitch, of course the two warriors would choose this moment to make their promise. Thor let off a few celebratory bolts of lightning streak across the sky like fireworks, and then set to taking down their enemies with a renewed vigour. If he knew Stark, the post-battle revels would be particularly spectacular today, and, more importantly, Thor would finally have opportunity to bring out
'Peter.' He said.
, and told him to get dressed. When he came out from behind the screen she was gone, and Steve went home, cheeks burning, and never told anyone what had happened.
It was petty, and Steve would regret his coldness later, but just then all of him was cold. The light inside him was like a frozen lake now, clear and numb and sharp. He worked his way around the festival, breaking up a few back-alley dice games and making sure nobody was too drunk, trying not to think about Tony. He might as well have been trying not to breathe.
“ You should also make sure that he does some like stretching and exercise.”
“ Steve?” Tony asked.
Bucky smiled and approached them. “ Aaron Called, he only has an appointment for 12:30. It will conflict with the slave master’s schedule. Which would you rather go to?”
“ Take me with you next Time you leave.”
“ Please forgive your father, he is just protective.”
“ You think Richards is a quack.” Tony supplied.
“ Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed.”
Grant huffed. “ Well at least I remember the manners my mother taught me. “
Steve glared at him which just caused Barton to laugh even harder.
“ Was going for a swim.”
“ We believe that your little friend here may know them and that they may for some
Clint looked as if he were going to speak again when the door opened.
Tony rolled his eyes. Even these people thought he was impulsive.
“ We were in and out of cyro after that. And then fully reinstated in 2014.”
They both blushed and looked away. There was his answer.
Steve leaned forward and kissed him again.  Tony opened his legs and he adjusted himself and made himself comfortable between his legs. Steve wound his hand into His hair and placed his other hand on his hip, caressing it lovingly as he continued to kiss him deeply.
“ World War II. He was apart of our SHEILD program back then. He helped us win the war. There were a couple others too. I think he had a friend. An annoying little fellow who ran his trap more than he should.”
Everyone loved a good run. Who didn’t? There was a great influx of endorphins or whatever their doctors called that thing that made you happy. And it was kinda sexy to be a little sweaty. And Steve knew he looked good with a little sweat from his workout. So when he asked Tony to go run with him, the little man looked at him like he grew another head and passed.
“ Fury, What the hell?” Tony snapped.
Bucky just smiled. “ You don’t have to blush Stevie. It’s fine to ask, you just want to please your partner. That just shows that you are a caring lover.”
“ Like in bed?” Steve asked a little confused
They could not be serious.
“ Tony, my bambino, have you been eating properly? You look so thin,” Maria cooed as she tried to help Tony dress.
Tony slowly opened his eyes and gingery stood up. There in front of him, in his now destroyed living, was Thor holding Grant above the ground by his neck while Nat, Clint and Sam were holding back Steve.
Also it turned out that they at one point were able to speak. Unfortunately they grew out of practice when they returned to the water, but Peggy was quite literate and spelled out whatever she needed it say in the sand. Tony made a mental note to give her a Starkpad later so that they could communicate better.
“ Listen Nemo this is my bathtub. I’m tired and sore and I need my jacuzzi bathtub that I installed personally for stressful days such as today.”
“ Faster... oh god faster...” Tony cried.
“Tony, you need to give it back. I know you didn’t get it from our kitchen.”
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes, they had been fighting for the past fifteen minutes and it was going no where. He had gotten especially bad when Steve found out that he had met with Strange behind his back. He didn’t seem to like that fact that he sees other men other than Steve even though it is completely platonic.
“ Oh ok. How did the webbing get there?”
“ Taskforce?” Tony asked incredulously.
With that Steve ground his hips into Tony’s backside, letting him feel his erection.
“ Please...” he begged softly.
Steve sighed. “We’re a possessive species. And seeing that he has made a claim, he probably thinks and will want to show Tony that he is a better mate. He still sees Tony as unattached since I haven’t given Tony a bonding mark. He will most definitely try to impress him. Him kicking my ass was just one step into showing that he is a stronger mate and can provide him protection. He made that really clear that he was stronger.”
Looking for a Stony fic. It’s either post apocalyptic or historical. Tony lives in a cave and sets traps to protect himself. Steve captures him and has sex with him everyday and orders the rest to protect him when he is not around. There is also Natasha, Clint, Sam and Bucky. Steve also has sex with Tony anywhere he can think of including outside their shared tent on the permitted of their camp. Please let me know if this sounds familiar as I have been looking for it for a while.
Tony huffed angrily as he threw his pillow across his room. He was promised a week. But no Strange said it would take longer. He would have accused him of just trying to delay his departure if he hadn’t been so rudely transported to Strange’s lair. The man looked as if someone had beaten the shit out of him and dragged him through a pile of flaming hot coals. Tony has also noticed that his hair was emitting smoke as if he had just put a fire out. Yeah it looked like Strange wasn’t kidding when he said that it was going to be a lot tougher than he had originally thought. He said he can get the infinity stones so Tony didn’t have to worry about them but he would need more time to create a portal and with that he had sent him back to his room before he could ask any questions.
Peter gasped and grabbed onto Wade tighter. Next he felt himself falling with Wade on top of him.  Wade kissed and sucked along his neck and bit his ear when he reached it. Peter gave a soft whine. Wade licked the abused skin once before kissing it.
“ You know, if you hate me so much, why did you agree to help?”
“ Officer Grant May you please do the honors?” Steve asked.
Coulson smiled and looked at Steve. “ Steve, you can stay here if you want. We can grab your stuff and bring it here tomorrow if it makes you happy.”
“ I am on requip for my bipolar. I would like to take my pills for that.”
Steve gave him a sad smile and his eyes to began to water, a lone tear trekking down his face. “ I don’t want to but I must. You’ll make it out of here. I believe in you.”
Steve raised an eyebrow, “ Is that a hint?”
Steve playfully swatted Tony’s arm. “ Like I said no respect.”
“ Rogers.” Shoot. He knows who it is. Why would he say that?  He’s such an idiot.
Peter looked back at his work and continued to work.
Bucky gave Steve a small smirk as Tony accepted the pastry, freeing his hand to stroke Tony’s hair.
“ Tony... please”
“ You are allowing the Commander to court you. You have never been with a man before. I can tell. You want something.”
Winghead made a cooing nose and looked from the bed down at Tony.
“ He’s clean. I don’t sell diseased slaves.”
Pete rolled his eyes. “ Just someone from school.” He adjusted an equation in the hologram, watching its reaction.
Harry smiled back at Peter. “ Do you want to go?” He asked.
Tony looked around the room and noticed the red, white and blue banners hanging from the ceiling with the black wolf tearing up in his hind legs in the middle. The furniture seemed a bit antique, but well preserved. The fire place was already lit in the hearth to his left. Other than that, it was minimally decorated.He walked forward to a door on the opposite side.
“ You talked to Pepper? Does she know about...” he motioned to his wrist.
Would be safe to stay in Louisiana. She had opened the
Maybe Tony will talk to him again someday. That would be great, he really wants to be able to talk to him again.
The other teen beamed at him and smiled.
“ If they don’t want him, they can always return them.”
“ That’s the Winter Soldier and Commander Hydra”
“ I don’t know. Do you want to find out?”
Tony could have sworn if the man had a tail he would be wagging it right now.
“ Yeah. The lower doses didn’t work. Doc had to...”
He shook his head vehemently and tried to scurry  away from Tony who was securely latched onto him.
“ Jesus fuck! I’m awake! I’m awake!” Tony shouted as he tried to shake the cold water from his body that was doused on him.
Clint started to laugh, “ Man remember when he accidentally booked extra tickets for you and Rhodey to spend a week in Italy? There was no way in hell that was an accident. You don’t just accidentally spend $10,000 extra on a vacation. That man will kill to have you as a son in law.”
“ Tony He is a siren. He was trying to lure you into a relationship.”
“No!” They both snapped.
Bucky smiled. “ You won’t want that to happen darling. You would miss my dick to much.”
The brunette gave him a lopsided grin. “ Wouldn’t mind moving on ya’ honey,” He slurred.
“ Yeah. Im sure that’s gotta piss off Schmidt.”
“ Man   You’re mean when you don’t get laid,” Clint said. Everyone in the room laughed including Tony much to Steve’s chagrin.
“так же.”
Bruce blushed. “ I hate you all.”
“A Mind like his Can provide a lot of insight.” Schmidt answered.
“ Yes. You know like someone to play with. He must get lonely.”
The Commander turned an unhealthy shade of red and a stuttering mess as he tried to answer.
Grant went behind Tony and licked a dirty stripe up his neck and nipped behind his ear. “ I can have you screaming my name in seconds.”
“ It’s possible he thinks that you are in danger. “ Bruce continued.
Steve shrugged and tossed him the lube. Bucky pushed down his pants and took them off. He circled his hole with a lube finger.
“ How they get so friendly over night? Wasn’t Cap just threatening to throw Grant off the balcony the other day for eating his breakfast burrito?” Sam asked as he ignored the TV and saw the two interact amicably.
“ S-Steve?” Tony asked, a little unsure.
“ Good night asshole,” Tony said over his shoulder as he left the bathroom.
“ Slave-master! Please tell us about his friends? Tony here must have friends right?” Bucky blurted out.
Tony saw Nat bit her lip and quickly dropped the book to cover her mouth and her shoulder shook. ‘ What an ass,’ Tony thought. Tony didn’t even want to look at Steve.
Bucky rolled his eyes at him. “ Like you are any better.”
“ It means if you don’t start moving in the next 5 seconds I am going to kick your ass.”
“ Fuck you too pal,” Tony sneered. Tony’s head swing sharply to the side as the palm of a hand connected with his cheek.
“ Attracted to him as in a lover material?”
“ Language,” Sam reminded
They quickly scurried over to the bed and nestled themselves around Tony. Tony pulled the blanket up and was asleep in a matter of seconds.
Now what the fuck was this? Why did he have a memorial? Was this the future? Did everyone think he was dead? It would explain why everyone was looking at home funny. I mean if he saw a dead person walking around he would definitely freak.... Well he would throw away his liquor and then freak.
“ Is he really though? I mean he does think you are as he calls an underachieving nobody.” Clint called out.
“ Hello to you too James,” the red head said.
“Why is that agent? Winghead not warming up to you?” Tony remembered that Fury had mentioned that Coulson had tried to have Winghead interact with him.
“ Nice look Stark.”
Tony launched himself at him and tried to get the book. Steve could easily overpower him, but he always treated Tony like some fragile china doll.
She sighed and looked at Steve. “ Zemo is going lose his shit. “
The knocking continued. Tony looked at the door he barricaded.
“ He’ll be fine the minute he gets his food.”
The robot looked back at him and tilted his head with an confused and hurt expression on his face. The small file he had been using as a fan still clutched in his hand.
Clint smirked at him, “ Good job Stark, you just got us out Commander back.”
“ I thought you knew.”
“ Anthony, you are practically glowing. Either whatever broad you were with last night was phenomenal or you may have a crush. And I assume it’s the latter as  you are quite smitten and you are completely sober today.”
Tony was finally going to get some after he doesn’t know how long. He was so excited he could cry. There was nothing hat could screw-
The man bowed again before scurrying out. Steve leaned back with a scowl and ignored Bucky’s triumphant look.
Natasha turned the speaker off. “ Should we trust him?”
Tony panted as he grinded On the thing below him. He classified him as a thing as he wasn’t human, vampires were definitely not human mind you, and he was currently being a bigger pain in the ass as usually. Both figuratively and literally speaking.
“ Yes. Brucie bear is right. I am from a different universe. And the Richards in mine is a fucking nut job.”
Steve sighed and turned off the TV.
Tony just shook his head, not trusting what he would say.
“ I was just surprised they could were such things openly.” Steve tried to keep his voice calm, but he was getting more worried with the murderous look Tony was giving him.
“ I think I would be happy to see my friends again.”
“ Hey.” Steve said softly. Tony turned and saw Steve standing there a little expectantly.
Steve leaned in again and gave him another kiss before reaching in front of Tony and undoing his button and fly of his jeans. He pushed it down in one go and pushed him forward.
Tony felt someone grabbed him from behind.
“ But i Don’t wanna.”
So when Steve said ‘walk’ he meant like ‘ walk’ as I’m waking a dog. Tony had a leash attached to his collar and he was walking next to Steve.  He had taken him to the estate’s private gardens and led him aliens the cobblestone trail.
“ He would have found us someway. He told me as much.”
When steve looked at him, there was a dopey grin. He remembered him asking who taught him to eat pussy. Steve Had rather not say as he had never done that before. No omega had been worth it before. Tony had kept begging stating he wanted to sent them an edible arrangement. Steve has laughed and rolled on top of Tony, kissing him.
Fucking A, Tony just really wanted to break his sober streak and have a scotch right now.
“ Yeah.  Some of those teachers are definitely strict. I never met a calculus teacher that  Easy or nice.”
Tony pouted. “ If you can fuck as good as you blow then I will have no problem.”
“ Your happiness and safety are always a priority to me.” Tony cooed as he gently rocked Peter in his embrace.
Steve looked away, but refused to move. Grant just glared at him.
“ Schmidt said we can spend more time together as the last mission was a success. He said it was my reward.” Steve scoffed. “ I think he just likes overworking me. By the way he wants to have dinner with us on Sunday.”
“ Making you dinner. Hope you like fish. I’ll be right here if anything happens. Clint and Sam will be in the booth. Wear the ear piece and signal us if you need anything.
“ And Im pretty sure you are supposed to cut your caffeine intake.”
“Whatever. I’ll still take him. Be thankful I’m in a relatively
Yeah, he was already regretting it.
Tony smiled and told him to meet him in the theatre room as he scurried off. Steve smiled and shook his head. He was such a weird little man.
“ Is it because of who my father is? Like i know he can be an a...”
“ You know I would. And Bucky and Steve have no problem with following along. They Never had the college experience and I’m pretty sure they wouldn’t mind following you to one of those frat parties or even follow you to class.” He said nonchalantly.
“ No buts. When we get there you are going to talk to him and straighten this whole thing out but I’m telling you right now that he loves you.”
Steve kissed the top of Tony’s head before bringing a blanket around them.
And with a particularly hard thrust Steve felt his vision whitened as he came hard.
“ Did your brother take you the that brothel?” A deep voice snarled.
Harry just nodded at her.
Steve gave a casually wave of his hand. “ To Aaron’s I need to get a new coat for Tony. He’s gained some weight. I can always go pick up the slaves at a later time.”
“ Well I’m a bit of a dumb blonde so you may want to explain it a bit more for me.”
“ Harry look!”
Bucky trudged into the room yawning and plopping down on a stool. His clothes were rumpled and hair out of place. He only had one arm. Sam followed behind in running shorts and a plain shirt. Her long hair was pulled up in a ponytail. She sat next to Tony.
Steve growled at Bucky and gave him a swift kick that Bucky grabbed with his non metal arm. Bucky glared at him before pulling him off of the couch and jumping onto the newly vacated area next to Tony.
“ Do you guys mind? I kinda have company. “ Steve motioned to the Barry conscious bodies around him.
Harry didn’t waste anytime In latching onto the other nipple. He gently tugged on the nipple and lapped it with his tongue right after.  Peter moaned in response. Harry grasped the other nippled with his thumb and forefinger and began to tweak and pull at it. Peter arched his chest so that as much of his chest as possible got into Harry’s mouth. Harry grazed his teeth along the nub and Peter let out a gasp.
“ I know. It was my ass. He beated it freaking black and blue. I thought Captain America was supposed to be wholesome and saint like. That spanking was not saint like. It was like sadistic dominatrix like.”
There was no response. “ JARVIS?”
“ Ummm...”
“ Very good.” The chair turned and Tony felt his breath stop. He knew that voice.
Tony shrugged off his hold. “ Cap, it’s my decision. “ With that he undid the Hulk-reinforced bindings and gave Grant enough space to stand.
“ Steve, What are you-“
Right after that, Steve asked Bucky if it was normal to come that hard after getting a blow job.
Tony have a noncommittal hum.
“ I should have fucked you sooner.”
Steve continued to swim a distance away from the man made beach and Howard sent him an occasional glare.
He cautiously walked to it and opens the door slowly.  He looked inside and saw another fire lit. He saw a large chest of drawers to the and another door, which he assumed was the bathroom.
“ You look like your puppy just died. I didn’t know you were so close to him.” Clint continued.
“ Enough you two. You need to stop arguing like school children and actually work together.”
“I don’t like that name.”
Tony began to wash himself. Freaking Coulson and freaking Shield. Why couldn’t they take Winghead back? He was not a babysitter. He was like a per diem consultant. Yeah of course he helped out with the Avengers with his Iron Man suit, but Fury really did not consider him apart of the team even though the team was separate from Shield. Maybe he could help hem out. Since they were a separate entity from Shield he could possibly offer them residency at his tower. He does have a lot a space and he wouldn’t mind having company every once in the while as it does get lonely. Well... company that didn’t need his constant and upmost attention.
Tony sighed and nodded.
Bucky relaxed with a sigh and turned to look at Tony with a happy smile. He crawled forward, butting his head against Tony’s hand, like a dog.
“ Absolutely. Please give me a few minutes so I may find something.”
“ ahh, Nicki, nice for you to finally join us.” Tony Drawled and Fury and Maria walked in.
“ Tony?”
Sam flipped him off.
He stepped in between the two quickly, trying to placate them. “ Hey, hey. Let’s all just come down. We can be civilized and talk about this.” When the hell did he become the fucking adult?
Tony let go of Bruce and ran to Strange, list in hand and showed it to him.
“ The purpose of me suggesting Sam is so that I don’t need to be here Tony. He was trained for this kind of work. I am not. That’s why I never wen to school for it.”
Steve didn’t respond as he continued to look out the window remorsefully. Maybe Tony would be willing to talk to him if he bought some Italian food.
“ Well I guess that’s Hydra for you. They are willing to do absolutely anything to fuck the world up.”
“ You look a lot like the engineer. You know that Tony Stark guy” Sarah rambled. Tony moaned appreciatively  as she kneaded a particular knotted area in his left shoulder.
Tony glared at the two of them. Assholes.
“ Maybe later. I’m a little busy today. And you don’t have to keep hanging out with me if you don’t want to. It’s not like I’m going to kick you out.”
He whined again.
Steve stepped forward, mesmerized by the pink hole in display. He didn’t realize that he was already in between Tony’s legs.
“ It was nice. I had a lot of fun. It seemed like you did as well. I think we are very compatible.
Steve blushes and spluttered, losing his balance on the bed and toppling over, grabbing Tony securely so he wouldn’t hit the floor. Tony chuckled  mischievously  and grabbed the loose book, scurry away from Steve’s reach as he looked through the sketches. Strangely enough they were all of Tony: Tony at a gala, Tony in the lab, Tony in the Iron Man suit, Tony... looking up loving at Captain America?
“ What the fuck?” He breathed out.
“ I wasn’t born at the turn of the century.”
Nat has called Tony and told him to meet her back at SHIELD with Winghead. He had never been so ecstatic in his life to be going to SHIELD. It was finally a chance to get rid of Winghead. If not that he doesn’t like him, it’s just that he’s tired of finding Goldfish in his bed and someone constantly hogging up his tub and whining loudly until Tony fills it up with water. And there is also the part where he can’t really leave the penthouse as Winghead tried to follow after him. So yes he was very excited to go back to SHIELD and drop off Winghead at the same time.
The man told him.
“ I’m a fucking assassin. I’m sure I can manage.”
Sorry about the delay. School and work have been real busy and I am having trouble keeping you.
Steve’s face fell and Tony rolled his eyes.
“ Knowing Stark, he probably pissed him off.”
The doors to the lab open and they both looked up. “ And how are my Favorite boys doing?”
Tony made a Gagging sound as that as Steve went through some of the bags.
“ I threatened to harm them as they harmed my guards and I can’t have you running around hurting yourself . Once you have proven yourself trustworthy again, I’ll unchain you. But until that time, you will only be unchained at my discretion. “
Tony turned his head to the side to give Steve a kiss
Geez the hell he would have raised if he new a Black woman saved his ass. He was there is his army uniform with a bouquet of wildflowers in his hand.
“ Oh fuck!” He cried out. He brought his leg up and tried to grasp it. It was cramping badly. Damn it, this wasn’t the time for this.
Bucky looked down at his lap and smiled at her,” what’s got you so giggly?”
“ Much better.”
“ Fuck you asshole!”
The blonde raised an eye brow and turned to Bucky.
Fury just glared.
“ We didn’t tell him you were here, yet.” Steve said.
Tony drew out a folded piece of paper from the back pocket of his jeans and held it out toward Bruce. He took it gingerly as if he were afraid it might attack him. He opened it up and read it.
“ You didn’t answer your cell.”
“ Yeah, they are real great company all right,” Clint snarked.
“ You’re such a funny girl. You’re so cute when you laugh.” Bucky cooed.
Tony nodded and whined. He felt Bucky’s fingers enter him, stretching him wider. Bucky lulled his leg outward to stretch him wider. Tony didn’t know how long it was but he eventually felt the blunt tip of Bucky’s penis nudge his entrance. Tony lowered his hands below and tried to stretch himself further to encourage Bucky to move in faster. Steve and Bucky made sounds of disapproval and removed tony’s  hands. They said something about not wanting to rush by Tony didn’t car he wanted them in him now. Bucky slowly slid in home with a huff. Steve moves first and Bucky followed. They began to make turns and started to quicken their pace. Tony clawed at both of them. Trying to gain purchase purchase somewhere. With a loud howl Tony came and Bucky and Steve followed after a few more thrusts.
“ Tony What are those?” Howard asked. His mom and dad showed up unexpectedly with homemade Italian food and had wanted to feed the Avengers. Clint has quickly ushered his mom in as the rest set up the table, not wanting to miss Maria’s cooking.
“ Ah, Commander. It good to see you again.” Strange said politely.
“ You Better take him down there before Schmidt finds out you’ve been slacking. Skeletor is already in a pissed off mood.”
Steve hummed as he stared out the window of the tower. Tony hasn’t spoken to Steve in three weeks. He tried calling him, left him notes, he even learned how to send an email, but he never responded back. He had tried to go to his apartment as well but no one answered the door.
Tony arched his back as he panted.
Clint supplied.
Grant just nodded and pulled out, quickly fixing his pants.
“ It’s alright. This must be hard for you. But you’ve been so strong. I know you have. You are always so strong,” he whispered. Tony sobbed and held onto Rhodey’s white workout shirt even tighter.
“ Well dinner is ready!” Steve said happily as he placed a plate of food in front of Tony.
Steve pouted. “ Fine, I’ll let you go in raw, but you better make it a good fucking.”
Tony tried to clench around Steve to hold him in, but Steve just licked that sensitive spot on the make of his neck to let him let go. Tony squealed and softened up again.
Instead of cowering this time, Steve hissed.
“ You seem so confident for a virgin. I mean anyone with any experience would be able to kiss properly. Well can you...”
Tony looked at Winghead who was currently snacking on the Goldfish Tony had bought for him earlier that day. “ You win this round.”
Steve nodded.
Harry: it won some awards or something i think.
A light chuckle rang in his ear.
“ And the. You can come in right behind me and bend me over the table, having your way with me.”
Tony glared at him. Bruce was so going to owe him big time.
“ Show me a pic!”
The smaller man jumped up in surprised, startled by the King’s anger.
“ Yep, so you might as well get used to him because he is staying. And that is final.” Steve said.
Tony looked at him shocked, an eyebrow raised at the suggestion.
“ Sam stop sexually harassing our guest.”
“ Thanks a lot Clint,” Steve snapped as he glared at him before following after Tony.
“ I’ll give you a gauntlet. How about that? Will you feel safe with that?”
“ With Tony. They get along very well.”
Nat just rolled her eyes.
“ Want that one!” He said happily as he pointed to a white button up.
The elevator doors opened and Tony walked in. Steve quickly followed.
Tony stood up and glared at the merman.
“ Your friends are going at the end of the week, Bucky said it’s good for you to have people you know nearby, especially since you are older. He said that older humans have trouble acclimating. I never knew that.”
Wade leaned forward and captured his lips once again.
“ You’re such a doofus.”
Rhodey sighed. “ Sam that was not appropriate.
“ No he does not.”
“ You’re so pretty. Such a beautiful omega,” the guy whispered into Peters ear.
It was the Red Skull.
“ And you are an asshole.”
Grant looked up at him with lust filled eyes and began to kiss him. Just like Steve, the kiss was definitely inexperienced. Tony led him and started slow. No use in rushing and scaring him. He let his hands travel downwards until he was at Grants ass and slowly pressed it downward so that their cocks were rubbing against each other. Grant moaned in appreciation.
“ Did I say that out loud?”
“ Well your omega father was a whore and it’s no surprise your one as well.”
Tony crossed his arms.
“ Steve you bring some guy home without telling anyone, I think that is something we need to talk about, especially since it’s him.”
“ Hey,” he said as he bounced nervously on the balls of his feet. He had changed into a pair of khaki bots and a plaid button up. His hair was still slicked back.
“ This is very inappropriate. You are making Tony uncomfortable. It is very rude.”
Tony started to steam in pleasure when Steve began to thrust his hips upwards.
“ Should you even be working? You’re injured.”
Bucky nodded and dropped him. Steve tried to approach.
“ Stark it ceases to amaze me how much you talk.” Strange drawled. Tony glared at him.
. He felt two hands on his hips from behind. He turned his head slightly to see who it was. Peter didn’t really know the guy. He knew he was on the baseball team and that was about it. He didn’t mind and continued to dance.
“ I don’t want you to do anything like that to my friends and family.”
“ It’s for hygiene purposes too.”
“ He’s from another universe. He accidentally got sent to this one,” Schmidt replied quickly,” He’s just here for a little bit. We were giving him a tour.”
Peter shrugged. “ It’s school. It has its ups and downs.”
“ You are so tight. What a good little bitch....made to breed like this.”
Steve turned to look at him confused. And Steve motioned toward him. Steve scrunched his face and tilted his head. Tony have an exasperated sigh and rolled his eyes.
Tony raised an eyebrow. “ Why would he think that? I’ve never met him before.”
“Can I help you?” Tony asked.
“ Oh, come on. It’ll be fun. “ Tony whined.
Peter cracked open an eye and saw a familiar face.
Everyone nodded. It was strange that the two had a sudden change of heart and were more amicable toward one another.
“ Don’t be so crass dear.”
The metal man tutted. “ So horny, my little minx.”
“ You’re not hard. Bucky said that May happen. He said that when humans get older they have trouble staying hard during sex. He said there were pills for that, do you think you need some?” Steve asked softly.
“ No matter what universe, I had always loved you. Whether it was as a lover or a friend, I still loved you.”
Tony tried to clench around Steve to hold him in, but Steve just licked that sensitive spot on the make of his neck to let him let go. Tony squealed and softened up again.
Tony blinked rapidly as his eyes tried to adjust to the bright light. He put a hand over his face with block it out as he sat up. He looked around and noticed the many people walking around; some with children,  some walking dogs or having picnics. He noticed the sky was blue with a few fluffy white clouds, with the occasional bird overhead.
Hi everyone. This is another idea I wanted to try. I would love to hear you comments and feed back. Also if anyone can help me find this fic I’ve been looking for, I would greatly appreciate it. :)
“ Picking you up?” Steve asked.
“ No I didn’t...”
“ Well if you want food, you are going to help me cook. “ the blonde said.
He didn’t hear his parents he could only
Peter said huskily.
Steve sighed again and began to type. He scrolled down a bit and put his headphones on before clicking on a video.
“ What the fuck now,” Clint whined. “ I don’t want to fight anyone.”
“ What do you want?”  Tony hissed.
“ So good... you like that, huh? My sweet bitch...so tight....like ya’ made for this.... gonna... treat ya’ right....”
“ You were literally my fathers friend. Do you know how disturbing it sounds that you basically robbed the cradle and are fucking the son of your friend. That’s like the beginning of some bad porno.”
Steve rocked against him gently. Tony let out a puff of breath.  Steve rocked against him again, this time earning a soft moan. Steve began to pick up his pace. Tony grabbed one to the shoulders of not-Steve and wrapped his legs around his tapered waist.
Tony could get used to this. This was the life he had always dreamed of.
“ No way in hell.” Grant growled.
Tony looked like he was about to say something but Steve was saved when Hill walked in and began their debrief.
“ He only sang one time and it was just sad. It wasn’t very dangerous” Clint argued.
Tony was walking back to his room when he saw Pietro, Wanda and Loki huddled on the couch. Pietro had a ice pack over his right eye and Loki and Wanda seem to be fussing over him.
Steve sent him a glare.
He offered what looked like grilled seaweed.
Steve glared. “ Get the fuck up and get out.. I have company.” The man and woman shot up, scared, and grabbed their clothes as they made a bee line for the elevator.
They were watching the football game with interest with the occasional commentary as Tony munched happily in the background.
“ May I do something Tony?”
Peter pouted. “ Don’t wanna. Not comfy.”
Peter whined and tried to push Harry back down so that they could kissed.
Morgan would always scoff. Like having a dick in your mouth is any cleaner. And then there are those people who are so unenthusiastic and make it look like it’s a chore. That would piss him off so much. He just gave them the best fucking blow job of their life, they Can at least fake being enthusiastic. It wasn’t like their knot was made out of fucking gold or something. What pricks.
“ Yes?”
“Thought you didn’t like him.”
The first ball shot and Tony swung. He missed it.
“ But you said that Peggy was the last one he had sex with.”
“ Don’t worry. That was exactly what I was going to do anyway.”
“ Come one this isn’t your room,” Tony growled as he tried in vain the pull Steve off of the bed.
Tony smiled. “ I know. He just needs some boundaries. He is very intelligent and can follow instructions. I just feel like this whole situation has been overwhelming for him. Especially the part with almost being caught by Hydra and now he is just expected to trust us. I just feel bad for him.”
Peter smiled and nodded his head enthusiastically.
Steve sighed. “ I don’t want to talk about it,” he said to his sketch book.
Sam huffed. “ I didn’t feel like getting beaten with a cane.”
The man smiled. “ Well he is older than most of our slaves and his Reported behavior is rather alarming. It would be more cost effective to put him down. No one would want such an unruly pet.”
And lubricated finger press around his hole teasingly. He swirled his finger only inserting a little before pulling back out.
Tony smiled mischievously at Steve who blanched. “Why not?”
“ Why don’t you just jump in and have my way with me as well?” Tony cooed.
“ Probably. It would say 5/5 stars, would recommend to a friend.”
Steve raised an eyebrow, “ Which one is that?”
Tony gave a mirthless laugh, “ God you are such an ass.”
The elevator opened and he stepped home.” Good night Mr. Stark.”
Tony could see what she meant when Bucky was possessive. The way he held Sam and touched her, Bucky wanted everyone to know she was his.
Clint growled and ran after Bucky out the door again which swung closed behind them.
Steve leaned down a placed a kiss on his temple.
“ Yeah just like that,” Tony whimpered.
‘ Well played. Sell this sucker a few more slaves.’ Tony thought.
“ Why does he get to eat a pop tart!” Clint cried out indignantly.
“ He Wants to court Stark, and based on my limited knowledge of his kind, they are very Possessive. And this one seems to be extremely stubborn. So that’s not a great combination to being with. He says Tony helped Save him and he likes him enough to “date” him. However,  I’m his culture this allows leads to mating and the two being forever connected until death. Mermaid mate for life and form bonds with their mate that can cause them to feel each other’s feelings and emotions. They can’t read their mates minds but it’s a very intimate connection.”
Breakfast hadn’t been any better. Rhodey had made him pancakes. Steve decided that wasn’t a good enough meal so he pushed the plate away from Tony and had placed a raw fish in front of him instead.
Tony disentangled from the blanket and stood up. He knew he was going to regret this. He began to push the furniture out of the way of the door. For some reason it felt a lot heavier this morning. Either he was getting old or it got heavier over night. It was definitely the latter. Most defiantly.
“ But I don’t like them either.”
Steve nodded.
It was not even five minutes later when he saw a map appear in his HUD.
Tony still didn’t say anything.
“ God Damn it. You freaking fish fillet.” Tony growled.
Clint wrapped an arm around Tony, who had sat a little bit away from the red haired woman. “ See Nat? He loves me already.”
“ He honestly was just flopping around to get to places.”
“ Come on Coulson is here to take you home. Time to go home.”
Morgan gasped as he felt a certain tender part being touched.
“ Fine. I am very upset that I have to deal with this bull-“
“ See! I’m not seeing things. There are two of  them. I wasn’t making this shit up.” Tony cried out indignantly as the two watch the soldiers pace in their individual rooms from the CCTV feed.
Steve squeaked at the contact.
“ Would you like to go out with me?”
“ Are they though? There is obvious video footage of this Anthony Stark look alike. Is it because that he looks like the late Mr. Stark that he is being given such preferential treatment. And Mr.  and Mrs. Stark have been seen entering the Tower more frequently since the death of their son. Is this supposed to be some secret Hydra side project.”
“ Steve it’s fine. I swear.”
Steve shrugged. “ The only thing he kept telling was to stay away and that Tony was his. He kept saying ‘mine, mine, mine’. He probably followed Tony because he thinks tony came seeking him out to mate.”
“ Winghead, be nice to Nat. She tries to make sure you are nice and healthy. Don’t be rude.”  Winghead just rolled his eyes. Tony sighed and pushed Him off of his lap. He stood up and began walking to the gate. Winghead grabbed his pant leg and whined.
“ How did the Commander catch you anyway?” Bruce asked.
Peter laughed. “ Be Careful or you are going to have to explain to our parents why you caught chlamydia. “
“ Looks like daddy approved of your boyfriend.” Sam snickered. Tony just rolled his eyes and continued to watch as the mer-people looked at his dad with utter fascination with Maria at his side. Tony will give him that: he knew how to entertain an audience.
“ Director, I think you should look at this.”
Peter turned and saw Harry there.
“ What ever Captain Octopus.”
Harry: does your dad always pick you up from school.
Pepper smiled and placed her hand on Tony’s. “ I know. But I also worry for you too. He can be dangerous Tony. Please be careful.”
He placed  it back down again. The photos on the walls were all moments of the other Tony’s life, proudly presented. Him and Nat at a zoo, him and Pepper at a charity event, playing video games with Thor, cooking with Bruce.... the other Tony looked so happy. He was well loved and appreciated here.
Harry shook his head and led him to the bed. Peter sat down with a bounce and giggled. “ It’s bouncy.”
Sorry about not updating in a while. I’ve been pretty busy. Here’s a short interlude.
“ All lies, Cap. All unfounded lies.”
Steve took a seat next to Tony and Bucky on Sams other side.
When they entered Clint looked up with a raised eyebrow. “ Why is he naked? And when did he get legs?”
Tony back away from the couch. There was no way he could fight him. He was more a feral beast than that happy puppy a few minutes ago. Tony moved slowly and tried to get toward Steve but Bucky saw that and jumped, creating a barrier between Tony and Steve. He kept his eyes on Steve and growled.
“ Damn, I wanted to be the one to kiss him first,” They separated quickly and looked at Grant leaning on the door frame.
Wade: why am I not surprised.
“What? I’m curious and we have two people here with first hand experience.”
“ You didn’t even look at her!” Bucky whined.
“ We’ve watched this one already.”
Tony nodded.
Tony asked coyly.
Clint cheered as the cheese puff were tossed to him.
“ No. I meant with another guy.”
The lights overhead began flashing red and a loud siren began blaring.
Strange pushed Tony behind him. “ Stat behind me. That song is meant to harm. “
“ Tony, the answer is still no.” Grant repeated.
Harry: I think you’ll like it.
We found out he was bisexual a year ago. We didn’t care either way. He was still the same guy who drove us nuts.” Bruce gave a small chuckle
Howard looked back out into the water, “ Really?! You are going to guilt trip him with a kid? You bastard,” Howard snapped.
Winghead just ignored him and continued to eat the midnight snack he had decided to bring back to his new bed.
“ Clint when did you get here?” Tony asked.
“ Morning,” Bruce walked into the room and walked straight to the fridge to retrieve his fruit cup.
Tony turned to him and saw the blonde sulking on the chair opposite from him with his arms crossed over his chest. The man looked as if he was told that Apple pie was no longer an option in the US.
“Well I was busy running down the little bastard upstairs.”
When Steve was gone Tony turned to Bruce. “ What the hell just happened?”
Thanks for reading my fic. Here is the next chapter. Hope to hear for you soon!
Tony sighed. He was truly hopeless. He was giving his romantic rival a sand which.
Steve felt tony push him and he relented.
“ Why did Fury call us out here that so important?” Clint asked from his perch on top of a counter.
“ And then we have to make sure you have your check up. The doctor is finally back in town and just refuse to make a home visit. I swear, no one respects the crown.”
Steve smiled back and shook his head.
“.... just let me grab something and I’ll- What the fuck!” Tony and Steve turned to the front door and saw Rhodey with...
“ For Tony as a mate.”
“ Hello beautiful.”
Tony looked at him stupefied. “ What!”
“ Peter. “
“ Fuck that shit, I’m going to where Nat has to where a bikini and where I can drink alcohol before noon.”
“ It’s not rocket science.”
“ This was your idea. You wanted me to choose someone. So I’m choosing. And I’m choosing him.”
“ You put it on your head.”
“ Told you I- FUCK!”
The vampire groaned and flashed his teeth. He large hands were currently massaging the globes of Tony’s ass. He leaned forward and nipped at the exposed collar bone in front of him, making Tony winced slightly. And that was one of the reasons why he was a bigger nuisance to deal with than usual. He had been more nippy than usually, leaving bite marks and bruises littered  all over his body. “ Watch the teeth there, Dracula,”
Natasha rolled her eyes and Was going back for the speaker when Clint bested her to it, “ Were you two sexually involved?”
“ Hey”
Tony rolled his eyes as he approached.
He felt himself being embraced and he returned it.
“ Oh my god! You guys fucked!” Clint blurted out.
“ How did you know I was coming?”
“ Huh that’s interesting. You should try to see what you should do to make him do it again and get more info about it. Maybe this is something we can learn from. “
What were with these kids.
“ I wonder why.”
“ Less bat shit?”
“ Peter what are you taking about,” Steve finally spoke.
“ In his mouth?”
Bucky smiled at him and walked over to embrace the man. “ Hey there ya crazy bastard. What are you doing here?”
“ I have to take Sam to go run.”
“ Fine! Fine! See hands up,” Tony said as he threw his hands up.
“ Happy now?”
“ That heathen is still living here?” Howard asked gruffly.
Tony gave him a small smile before turning back to the three teenagers.
“ Call him that again and I swear you will regret it,” Harry growled threateningly.
Tony looked around Howard and saw two men strolling in with grocery bags.
What the actual fuck.
Clint gave him a faux innocent look, “ What I’m just curious.”
Steve looked at him nervously and gulped. “ I... uh... made too much food.... and I thought that maybe you would like some... I mean...you haven’t had anything but doughnuts and I made some fried chicken and...um... I thought might want some...”
Tony looked up at Winghead’s curious expression. Winghead dropped a tennis ball on his lap. It looked a lot like-
Pepper was about to retort when Tony places a hand on top of her’s, letting know it was ok.
Tony was on his back as a happily  chirping Bucky was on top of him, nuzzling his neck and-
“Why did you come here?”
Soft puffs of breaths tickled the back of his neck as Steve continued to stay still.
“ Move your ass,” he sneered.
Steve whined and scurried around him on his knees. Bucky looked at Tony curiously.
“ Yeah, and I can actually be Elmo,” Bucky quipped.
Maria cried out in excitement. “ Is it true Tony? Have you finally found someone? Is it Pepper. I adore her. She is perfect for you.”
“ You really don’t know who they are do you?” Clint asked.
“ Yeah for chem homework. Nothing else.”
Steve grumbled and pushed Tony closer to the bed. Bucky was already there, already naked with a bored look on his face. Steve gave Tony another shove until he flopped on the bed.
“ So does this mean you dumped Wade.”
Then like everything in his life, things had to go to shit. It started with a headache then the vomiting. Then the insomnia. Then he got diarrhea. That was absolutely miserable. Steve looked at him with a pitiful expression and asked if he was ok. He just told him he had a stomach bug. Then he started to feel different. He wasn’t happy as he was before and that’s when he realized he has been off his medication for over a week.
They were walking down a hall now.”
Steve just shrugged again. He didn’t care. He just wanted to talk to Tony again.
Steve Blushed heavily and looked away.
“ What? what Nat?” Clint continued to ask.
“ Easy there Tony.”
Morgan panted and closed his eyes. He felt his liver gently stroking his hair and he purred. He opened his eyes and turned to look at the man.
“ I think I already have. I got you were I want you. I wonder how good this body will feel under me.”
“ Well? What?”
Harry chuckled.  “ I bet you can, but you can’t even walk a straight line. You’re really drunk.”
He was supposed to get in with their regular physician last week but he had to go out of town and has not been back since, so Bucky pretend-MD from bullshit medical school was the one giving such great advice, the bastard.
“ Fuck, sounds like my time at MIT.”
Tony looked out to the water. He didn’t see Winghead anywhere. Probably sulking somewhere.
Loki glared at him.
“ Well it’s not like my so called ‘crush’ is a bad choice. “
Tony sighed. He feels like he has been doing that a lot lately. “ I don’t know what their deal is but I hope I don’t have to do another push up anytime soon.”
Tony wanted to scream. But he didn’t and he was proud. He will be patient with this idiot.
“ Want to watch a movie with me?”
Steve squealed and squirmed as he felt his prostate overstimulated. This is their third round and even super soldiers needed a break. This was going to be his fifth orgasm of the night. Iron Man hadn’t even cum once yet... well if he could cum.
“ I asked you a question.”
They both blushed and nodded before scurrying out of the room, closing the door behind them. Tony chuckled, this was going to be fun.
“ I see that you are still kicking. You may want to keep your boy on a tighter leash because it looks like he is looking else where to get a piece of ass. And usually I won’t mind but I rather that piece of ass not be my son.” Bucky hissed again, tail slapping the surface of the water.
“ Yeah,” He said as if it were obvious,” My colors are much simpler and Ive been told the colors really bring out the color of my eyes.”
Tony rolled his eyes. “ Honey bear,” he whined, “ save me please. Take me you. I don’t want to deal with this.”
“ Yep.” Clint said as he popped the ‘p.’  “ Steve was madly in love with him.”
“ What a dick.” Ned said as he bent down to help Peter collect his things.
“ What? I’m curious and you should know by now there are certain things I never learn. So how hot is he? I mean after hearing about you and Wade I have my reservations regarding your tastes but I still have hope for you.”
The guy roughly grabbed his jaw to have him face him. “ What the hell was that for you bitch,” he growled.
“ Are you for real,” Nat growled, “ You are mistreating him because of your homophobia? For fuck sakes Steve. He hasn’t done anything to you. He invites you to his home, shares his food and offers to upgrade your equipment and this is how you treat him? You know what? Fuck You.” With That Nat stormed away.
Steve sighed, “ It’s important to get an education. It opens up opportunities. And I want you guys to have the best opportunities available. And Loki your brother wants you in school so perhaps one day you can also act as an ambassador to Earth.”
“ Is this why you didn’t text me?” He asked softly.
Steve sighed as he saw Tony hold the can of cheese in a death grip in his hands as he glared at him from on top of his perch. He had taken the cheese cab from god knows where because Steve never carried that in his house. Both Howard and Maria has long since retired to bed despite it only being 7 at night. They were either exhausted from being locked up all day with Tony or they trust Steve and somehow Steve had a feeling it was the former.
Grant scoffed. “ You are the most addicting drug sugar. We are never going to get enough of you.” He came over and gave Tony a small kiss to his temple.
“ Oh?” Tony said coyly.
“What the hell happened? I could have sworn there was only one of you guys this morning. Stark you haven’t been experimenting with one of your bright ideas again have you? I thought we told you we don’t want a repeat of the Ultron fiasco.” Clint grunted out as he struggled with Steve.  “ Dude! Chill the fuck out! We are on the same team.”
“ Ya Don’t shut up do ya?” Bucky said as he gripped tightly onto Tony’s upper arm. Nat and Clint quickly followed behind him.
At this point Steve was panting heavily, looking at Tony with lust in his eye.
“Pardon my son your majesty. His mouth runs from him at times.”
1)The originally pod had thirty mermaids.
“ Just Like that baby.... beg for it....”
“ Now that is out of the way, I do need to address something important.”
Tony tried to get his feet under him but never got the chance as he was quickly dragged away and put into the common area with some of the other slaves. They were all freshly bathed and dressed in nearly translucent robes.  Tony noticed that they were all female.
“ Tony, you don’t have to pretend.” He snapped and faced him.
“ I’m just curious Stark,” Nat began,” what the hell did you do in bed that cause him to throw his back. I know of your reputation but I didn’t know you were this wild in bed.”
Sorry for the short chapter. I am currently working on a longer one. Please stay tuned and thanks for all of your support so far.
Natasha just shrugged. “ Apparently he is an amazing strategist and a good fighter.”
“ So what is it? Why are you being such a prick?”
Tony sighed. “ I guess not. “
After a while Tony found a indoor batting cage in the arcade and ran to it, though he denied the running part.
Tony cowered in the corner when he saw his father seething behind the bars of his jail cell.
Quentin gave him a sly smile. “ Oh my, I think I’ve finally corrupted you Mr. Parker.”
Well that was easy.
“ Pep, you better be careful or I’m Commandeer your boyfriend away.”
“ Wait, hold on. What happens if I don’t want a relationship.”
Steve didn’t reply.
“God Steve. Right there. Fuck... Damn.”
“ Stop being a stubborn ass and go.”
“ Then tell it to me and not your book.”
Steve gave him a deadpanned look.
“ Last week he found him face down in the pool. He’s a heavy son of a bitch when he knocked the fuck out.” Clint commented.
“ But Pete.”  Peter internally groaned.
Pepper smiled.
“ But you need access to the stones to get back. Access that the commander has.”
“ Bambino!” Tony saw a little old woman speed walking to him in her expensive heels. She was as graceful as the day she last saw her.
Winghead cooed and purred as Tony scratched behind his ear. Today was date number four. This one went better then that first, Tony didn’t make any sexual related comments and Winghead didn’t faint. Today they just had lunch ( some Italian food that Nat left out, thank god, for Winghead to scavenge and think he was independently providing for Tony. The little creature didn’t know that Nat set him up with the food and that was fine. He never needed to know because at least this time the food is edible. Tony was still able to act surprised though, to sell the small deception)  and were now cuddling.
Steve smiled. “ Will do and I guess you can go back to doing whatever.” Steve motioned to the two before walking out.
“ There we go. Don’t worry, I’ll play with you too baby,” Tony said to Grants cock, giving it a loving touch before turning back to Steve and fondeling  Grants growing erection.
“ Are you alright? He didn’t hurt you right?”
“ What the hell is that supposed to mean?” Tony growled. Yes he’s old he knows that, but not that old. What the hell was wrong with these  people... and werewolves?
“ Do you understand.”
The door opened and Tony wanted give an exasperated sigh when he saw who it was.
Bucky flopped on the couch next to him.
“ Why would I care? Bastard almost killed me.”
“ Tony, I’m going to stop you for a sec, please refrain from using inflammatory language as it won’t help with the therapy process and may escalate things.”
Peter blushed and looked down.
“ Come among James, you should come too,” Howard told Rhodey as he followed  behind Maria.
“ He  did! You should have seen it! I was there. He got so pissed when the slaver  told him that he wasn’t really meant to be sold to him.” Clint chirped.
“ Dad you are taking things out of proportions again.”
“ I take it your name is Grant?” Natasha said through the speakers.  The feed of the solider stopped pacing and looked right at the camera.
I promised my parents that I would look after my siblings since they are going out on a date this weekend.”
Maria began to cut the Tony’s food and placed the plate in front of him. Maria took her place next to him and smiled. Tony wasted no time in shoveling the food in his mouth. He let out a happy moan. This is what heaven tasted like, he was sure of it.
“ Yeah but this one is like an exclusive trip. It’s like super high profile. And there is a bunch of like those tiny hot dogs with the croissant breading.”
He heard a chucking noise and looked over to see Bucky snickering. “ Shut up,” He snapped. That only served him to laugh louder.
“ JARVIS”
“ Tony!”
“ Ow! Ease up!” The man whined again as he struggled against him.
Harry sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose. How the hell did Peter become like this? If he cracks his skull Stark would surely kill him.
“ Yeah. I’m sure you do.” War Machine states as he turned his attention to Bucky. “ All right Grunge metal if you let our boy go I won’t pummel your to a pulp.”
Tony turned and felt his mind literally short circuit. “Fuck me,” he whispered.
“ Tony what are you doing here.”
Tony glared at him but chose for once not to comment.
Well that morning when I woke up, I saw my superior, Maria,  in my room and she told me to get dressed quickly and had applied that makeup to my skin. She was kinda freaking out and that was kinda weird because she is not that type of person. I was just exhausted so I didn’t think to much of it at the time. But when I exited my room I saw that bastard again and understood why she had been freaking out so much.
5) Sharon was Peggy’s daughter.
Tony looks up. Now there is an idea. “Bruce bear-“ he started
Tony looked at the scene in front of him, a little confused.
Maria gasped. “ My lasagna!” She quickly ran out of the room and into the kitchen.
“ You will be surprised. “
Tony scoffed.  “ But something does bother me though. Nick said he was never caught by Hydra, but he knew to put his arm out for a blood pressure. I’m probably over thinking it, but I still find it-“
“ Yeah, but the man is still a fucking nut job. He is just a handful.” Sam groaned.
Tony felt someone put their arms around him and rock him comfortably. They murmured something against the crown of his head and seemed to be humming.
“ Can you imagine? Me in that maid outfit you love me to wear so much. The skirt up all the way so you can see those black panties you think I look so hot in.”
He had started yelling and cursing and calling her a nigger. I had been in the living room with the kids so I told them to hide in their bedroom and not come out until I said so. I got the spare gun that we had hidden behind the book shelf and I ran to my sister. He had a gun in her face and was yelling at her, asking her what the hell she was doing at my house and if I new there was a nigger in my house.
“ Hmmm.... I think I can think of a few ways.”
“ Look at him Howard! He is so sad. He is already reprimanded enough.” Maria exclaimed as she held Tony closer to her. She was quite protective of her child as any good mother would be. Howard wanted to smile at the act. Maria was really too good for him. He did not know how he got so lucky.
The elevator dinged and the doors opened to reveal the common room. It looked very much like the one back in his own universe but with a lot of photos of the team.
“ I like it better when you were able to get drunk. You were always such a funny drunk, especially after what those French women did.”Greg laughed as he told Bucky.
Bruce nodded.
“ I think it would be good for you to. Bucky says humans feel more pleasure during sex when they are happy. I think it would positively influence our mating.”
'Right,' he said.
'It's Michael Buble's version of
Steve looked at him. Pepper must have seen something in his expression that Tony didn't because she sighed deeply, rubbing her temples.
'My apologies sirs,' he said, 'But there is an urgent call for assistance from the NYPD.'
Despite the low number of genuine Charity Marriages, the descriptor 'Dime Marriage' remains in popular use, particularly as a derogatory term towards marriages where there is a large
'Why? Because it's not true?!' Tony took a deep breath, working his eyelids with his fingertips. 'I can't imagine being with anyone else ever again. You can. That's the bottom line here.'
underneath it. Even the way the rancher looked back and forth between them, frowning, did nothing to dent his mood as he headed back to the station. People could say what they liked as long as they never took that look off Tony's face.
Still, Tony had to admit, he had listened to the recording a few too many times to justify it merely as a desire to tease Steve. He'd never heard Steve sing before, and he'd been a little surprised by the talent he had. Even through the terrible audio quality, there was a crispness to his voice, something in the timbre, that had made Tony go a little weak at the knees; even with such hammy lyrics.
'Yep, Dada, that's me.'
'Harry?'
work. More or less. He and Yinsen had built the suit in a strictly prioritised order, knowing there was only so long they could disguise the shape of it and that eventually even the most slow terrorist in the world would realise it was too man-shaped to possibly be a missile. So they came, sooner than Tony had hoped but, if he was honest, later than they could have reasonably expected.
‘Fine.’
'I'm your new deputy,' Thor said, rummaging into the pocket of his coat before producing an envelope of somewhat crumpled papers. 'I thought Mayor Danvers would tell you.'
'Mm?' Tony said, because it really wasn't fair of Steve to expect him to make conversation when he was this relaxed, and when, by all natural laws they should have fallen into lazy kisses by now.
'I'm not,' Bucky said, his eyes fixed firmly on Steve. 'Christmas 1938. The Blue Diamond.'
He patted his leg in a beckoning motion.
But he was there. As one of the women turned for a better view, Steve saw Tony Stark sitting on the couch that ran along the walls, wearing sunglasses even in the dark room, the light in his chest casting the area around him in a ghostly blue aura. He had a blonde girl on one knee seemingly
'Steve?'
'Mr Stark,' Jarvis said, and he sounded peeved. 'I assume from this I can say 'Welcome back, sir'?'
No time for that. He nodded. 'Okay, kid, thanks. Where did you hear this? Where is it all going down?'
, he would give up every scrap of dignity and self respect he had just to keep him there. Steve wasn't a cheat. If he had done it, it had been Tony's fault, for not being attentive enough, loving enough, just not being
'What have you done now, Stone?' Steve asked, drawing his attention away from Tony as Thor shoved him in. 'Been going where you're not supposed to be again?'
He wasn't in a jail cell or a lab or even tied up or anything. In fact, he was lying on a couch made out of some super fancy material that was thick like a really furry dog, and coloured a deep red. He'd rolled onto his side, and all he could see was the back of the couch. It was kind of a nice couch, way nicer than the one he and his dad had at home. Maybe Mr Halloween was rich. However nice it was, though, it didn't stop the scary, tingling feeling in his stomach that something bad was about to happen. Peter opened his eyes all the way, and moved his head as slowly as he could.
Tony flushed. Steve looked confused, and Tony made a mental note that they should watch
'What, you want me to prove it?' Steve asked, going and collecting the bag. 'You want me to open this and show you all the sprouts?'
, Steve thought, and it was like Tony's lights were inside him too, warming him.
'What?'
'What?' Peter suddenly understood. 'Oh! Yeah!' He pulled the phone, the phone Mr Stark had given to him, the phone that Mr Stark himself had owned, out of his pocket. After a few moments of searching, he found a port on Jarvis' hardware to plug it in, and quickly pulled up the Youtube playlist.
Steve stood up, scattering the sticks of charcoal and looking thoroughly panicked. 'Oh, oh no, I'm so sorry Tony, just give me two minutes, maybe we can still make it-'
'Whereas Steve,' Bucky shot back, 'Could have a drink and a half and then he'd throw up everywhere and pass out by the bins.'
He didn't want that. When had killing people become so normal anyway? He'd been disgusted by the use of his weapons in Afghanistan. He'd made up his mind to change. Tony didn't think he'd planned to change like this. Steve needed his help.
'Where are we going?' Steve couldn't help asking. The park was almost empty, the grass and bushes frosty with snow, the Christmas lights strung along the footpath not illuminating much beyond it. Snow was starting to fall again, just a light flurry, and Steve's breath was coming in clouds in front of him.
, Tony. I need you to do this, Tony.'
‘I told you I wasn’t available. Peter is… I need to be with Peter.’
‘You’re too scattered,’ Steve tried to explain. ‘Some flowers just don’t look good together. You should start with your favourites and then build up from there with complementary kinds.’
'Will you come back?' Something in his expression made her ask. He hesitated, but nodded, so she let go and watched him walk out of the house.
'But I have powers! I can help!'
'Let me help,' Tony repeated, and Steve did, despite the burning feeling of humiliation that seared through him at having to have his shoe laces tied for him like a child. Of course, he could have just worn his calfskin boots. He always used to wear them to work, saving the shoes for trials and Sunday best. But since the incident with Fisk, since finding out that shoelaces were nearly impossible with his temperamental arm, he had worn them almost every day. Every day he didn't felt like another victory for the corrupt old mayor, who had so nearly taken everything from him.
The terrifying darkness was gone as the scene played out in his mind's eye; a meteor crashing all the way out here in the desert of planet Earth, bringing the creature with it, dropping it under the sun.
They both laughed.
'Stark?' His voice couldn't be heard over the music.
Clearly she didn't believe him. 'Sure?'
Steve smirked at him. 'I kind of like you being jealous,' he said. The teasing tone didn't reach his eyes, and Tony knew he was still hurt, but if he wanted to flirt Tony wasn't going to stop him.
'I don't know, Steve, do we?'
'Tony-'
'And it sounded like things were getting thrown around-'
. Four years ago, when I hired him.' She shot Tony a filthy look and turned back to Steve. 'Do you have any idea how hard it is to get a housekeeper for this place? One that won't complain after a party or an alien invasion or, or, the Hulk, messes the place up?! One that isn't just trying to sleep with Tony, or that Tony won't try to sleep with, or that won't, I don't know, steal his underwear for the tabloids?!'
to be gay and so, of course, Tony Stark decided to never see a man ever again!'
And so he did. At first, Thor wasn't sure. After thousands of years of making up the ledger by hand, he wasn't at all sold on the idea of a digital version. However, once Tony showed him how to save pictures and to print them, Thor was enthralled, and excused himself to his room to go and explore this whole new world in privacy.
'For some people,' Natasha said, because she didn't want to explain that it wasn't that it was a bad period, particularly, but that she just couldn't handle it. Couldn't handle any of it.
'You're turning the air blue awful early this morning,' Tony said, from somewhere behind him.
'Yes,' Yinsen said simply, and Tony didn't ask any more questions. It didn't matter. He was going to fix all of this. Other people, not enemy soldiers but innocent people were getting hurt, because of what he had made. He swore to himself that when he got home, when he got out of this, he was going to put it right. He was going to make the world better. He just had to get out first.
Steve shrugged him off, but stood, looking regretfully at his dessert. He had lost his appetite since Stark had started implying there would be more
it read, in his mother's neat handwriting.
'Excuse me,' he said, finally near enough. 'Mind if I join you?'
'Morning, Steve. How are you today?'
Steve glanced at his phone. Would Stark contact the Make-a-Wish Foundation to let them know when he was coming? Or would he tell the hospital? Was he even going to show up?
, and his dad asked six billion times if he was
Hesitantly, Tony began to feel around the walls, his fingers making sense of what his eyes couldn't. It really was just a little natural alcove that had been sealed off, his fingers finding the bend where the side met the back with only a single step forward. Only just deeper than an arm's length, then. Placing one hand flat on the right hand wall, he reached out with his left to see how far across his new prison was.
. And Tony had clung onto that, desperate to believe it was true but never really being sure, until Steve suddenly turned up at school again, looking blank. He hadn't even needed to open his mouth for Tony to understand what this meant, what had happened. Steve had been bound. Tony didn't want to believe it, but it was so obviously true that he couldn't deny it; Steve had agreed to forget. He'd given everything up, and Tony didn't know
'Thanks, sweetheart,' he said.
'Yeah.'
'Yeah, I know,' Natasha said. 'And honestly, that might be the best way for us. I don't know if I can deal with-'
‘Really? Huh, and he told me he could keep a secret.’ Stark’s voice was the picture of mild offence. Steve’s control finally shattered.
'Do you have an ulterior motive?'

The ceiling didn't tell him much. It was pretty low, and wood panelled, like in old museums. Over the back of the couch, he could see bookcases.
'Love you too, Pete.'

a promise.’ The line went dead as he hung up. Infuriated beyond words, Steve brought his fist up, about to slam it down on the phone, but remembered at the last minute that he had promised to return it to Peter, and hit the table instead. The plastic groaned in protest.
Steve sighed. He couldn't forget that, no matter what he had done, Stark was dangerous. And , from the looks of things, a little deranged.
'Your son,' Steve said, 'Will find a way to support himself. Or, at least, marry someone who knows what they are signing up for and has too much money to care.'
"Hah?! H-Hey that's not fair! You're hot!"
Tony's eyes turned into moon crescents as he smiles to himself, looking like hearts were dancing all around him. "Tony? Why you lookin' like some teenage girl?" Barnes asked, hiccuping again. "Tones?" his best friend asks genuinely confused as well. "Tony!" he claps in front of his face, making him finally snap out of it. "S-Sorry, like I said I'm sort of tired today" he laughs awkwardly, "Uh huh" Barnes responds, "Hey Tony I gotta go on the dance floor to catch some ladies, wanna join?" Stark contemplates for a while before seeing the blondie directly facing the dance area,
Tony looks down, until a voice hums to him and a large hand was placed on his cheeks, he blushed once again and the hand wiped away the tear "Please stop crying" he begs the boy. Stark looks up a him, the other blushes as well. "Hoho now you're blushing" the shorter smirks. "N-No it's just-" Stark giggles and smiles making the other red in the face and his eyes closed shut to not see the cutie in front of him. "You're too cute"
He thought as he saw Bucky going towards him smirking, "Aye Aye Aye Tony my man!"  the taller tried 'bro hugging' him only to be dodge by Stark. "Uh first of all no, second what the hell are you doing here?"
He couldn't take it, he needed to talk to the man. Fuck, how??? He's covered himself with his thoughts as someone accidentally bumped to his side, his instincts quickly kicking in, "Hey watch it" "I-I'm sorry" he looked up glaring towards his face until his fingers curled infront of his chest once again red in the face, "N-No! I'm sorry!" Rhodes looks at him, confused at how he was apologizing."It's fine uhh Stark right?" "Duh, how do you not know 'the' Stark from Stark Industries" Bucky says smugly and hiccups right after, "Sorry, just never really know about that" the blondie says looking down and scratching his neck. "So I.....I gotta go my boss sort of needs me right now" He smiles again before leaving the scene.
Leaving the 'couple' to continue having their fit over who's more gorgeous.
Anyway, he likes someone that wants to get his attention in other ways, so keep at it" the other says as he dances. He heard it all though, so he makes his dance moves bigger and moved around more, his face gets more crazier as he dances while Barnes laughs at him and leaving Rhodes embarrassed that he was his best friend. "Tones I think that's a bit too much" He tries stopping but the shorter just kept going at him. Looked like the alcohol really kicked in.

“Good work.”

Most of his words are verbal nonsense, tripping and stumbling through several topics.

He can see it behind his own shut eyes, the few strands of hair that tend to fall down against Steve’s forehead, and Tony’s tempted to brush them back with the assumption that they’re there, but he isn’t sure if Steve’s that light of a sleeper or not, so he opts not to just because he wants to stave off any awkward conversation. He does need to talk to Steve, and this is the

"I know five years doesn't seem so long in the grand scheme of things, but I know it's been pretty long for you," Steve starts, and Tony is wondering where this is going. "But losing another five years of my life has sort of shed a little light on what I should've done a long time ago."
. Tony Stark. Yes, it does sound crazy, but I'm not lying. You want proof, I can give you proof.”
The next breath he lets out is heavy in his chest. Feels like his lungs are already filling up with water, that he's going to give out soon, and all he wants is to apologize, but he feels like apologies are a waste of breath if they're going to suffocate.
At some point, Steve had picked up Tony’s love, cradled it gently in his hands. Whispered his words of love in a thousand different ways that had not been ‘I love you.’ Promised to take care of him, to see the best in him, and to encourage him to be the best he could be. Tony, so blinded by his own love and his fear, has left him floating around in No Man’s Land, but Steve, like always, pulls him out of uncertain territory and into something warm and familiar.

He hasn't slept in… huh, seventy-something hours, or maybe even longer, and the longer he stays awake, the more his brain's mental capacity begins to degrade. Tony wonders if he should head back to his tower to get some rest, but he's also, weirdly enough, concerned that he's going to miss out on Steve's sleeping beauty awakening. Tony cannot possibly sleep through that and be the last person to know. Fuck no. Absolutely not.
