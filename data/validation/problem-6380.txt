He shrugged. “I got to meet a lot of people. See a lot of stuff I wouldn’t have seen if I’d stayed here.” He took another sip. “The money was good. The benefits. And I’ll get my pension. A few more years with the Guard, and I’ll be pretty well set up for later.” He looked at his hands lying steady on the table. “There were drawbacks too,” he said, “but I’m grateful. It was the right choice.” He looked back up at Howard, into his eyes. He was watching him with great interest, a small frown between his brows. “I’ve thought about it a lot. You know? ‘Bout joining like I did. And I think it was right. I missed out on a lot of stuff, but what I’ve got now? The life I’m living now?” He shook his head a little. “I don’t know if I would appreciate it as much if I hadn’t gone without it for so long.”
home so much he could barely breathe sometimes, but if he was going to let Sergeant Rogers take over, he’d have to take that part of him too, because Sergeant Rogers did feel like this was home. Or close enough, anyway.
Tony kissed him at the door that morning. For a long time. Even though it was eight-thirty, and Tony had to be at work at nine, he took the time to indulge in a very thorough good-bye kiss, complete with tongue and roaming hands.
He liked that connection. It made him feel like part of the greater world around him. Even though he was just one man, in the context of his service to the country, he didn’t feel like one man. He felt like a link in a chain that formed the fabric of the world, and he was proud of that. Really proud.
Steve turned on his side to look into those eyes. Those brilliant, bright eyes. “What if it’s too much?”
Some of the feeling was coming back into his arms, and Tony lifted them enough to caress Steve’s sides, the ridges of his ribs, the soft skin of his hip.
’,” he said.  “Flabbergasted” was not a word he used often, but it was certainly the one that seemed to fit this particular situation.
Tony put his hand over Steve’s mouth. “Shut up, Rogers,” he said. “You’re dicking with my righteous indignation.”
He walked up to the door and touched the handle.  It was sun-warm and smooth in his hand.  He was certain when he pulled, the door would not open, but it did.  He crossed the lobby and stopped in front of the private elevator.  There were people around, but no one talked to him.  No one stopped him.
They met on the stairs, Steve halfway down, Tony halfway up.  Steve had discarded the sweater he’d had on when they went to the bowling alley, but he was still wearing his t-shirt and jeans.  Just a plain t-shirt, a soft-looking heather gray.  Tony wanted to touch it.  Wanted to run his hands all over it, but he resisted.
“I wouldn’t be sulking.  Bruce is down there,” Tony said lightly.  “He’s enthusiastic enough, but the Hulkiness of it all makes it a little rough for my taste.”
“Tony?” Steve said softly. His finger was still dancing across the small surface of that brass button.
In the elevator, he raked a hand through his hair a few times and popped a couple Altoids just in case. The rest of the ride up, he just breathed. Just closed his eyes and breathed, and by the time the door opened, he was doing okay. He was ready. As ready as he’d ever be.
“And where do you think you’re going, looking so fine?” he asked, gratified that his voice didn’t come out in a drunken slur. “‘Cause maybe you shouldn’t go. Even if you don’t get arrested, you might stop traffic, and that wouldn’t be a good thing either. We can’t have a twenty car pile-up right outside the Tower, baby.”
Across the roof, Steve ducked his head again. His hands were stuck in his pockets. That blush still warmed his cheeks.
“Your friend--Carol, is it?--let me in,” he said, coming across the patio toward Tony. He was wearing a suit. Of course he was. Even on a warm California night, Howard Stark would wear a three-piece suit. He’d probably wear one when he was dancing with the devil or playing poker with the angels in heaven.
“Do you think you could, though?”  Steve asked.  “Do you think I could get you off right here?  Right now?”
Tony blinked in mild surprise.  “Don’t mind me,” he said.  “Nebula isn’t much for chit-chat, I must have lost my manners up there.  You know, in space.  Where you left me.”  He raised an eyebrow.  “What’s your excuse?”
,” he exclaimed as Steve pressed directly against his prostate. He dug his fingers into the blankets, grabbing great handfuls, pulling them tight. “Oh, you bastard,” he sighed, and Steve laughed again.
Tony came up behind him and wrapped his arms around his waist.  He rested his head against Steve’s back for a bit, then put his chin on his shoulder.  Steve stopped washing and stood still with his hands dangling in the water, just enjoying the feeling of Tony pressed against him.
But as much as he wanted to make it fly, none of the scenarios worked out.  This was Strange’s Sanctum.  Pepper was here-willingly and comfortably.  Tony was here-reluctantly and rather
He smoothed his hand down over his abdominals, feeling the ridges of muscle under his fingers, ran his nails up Steve’s side, then paused before brushing his nipple.
Tony was standing against the far wall, sunglasses on, a bottle of water in his hand. Voss. His favorite. Steve had tossed him the bottle when he came up the stairs. He’d done it silently, but with a little smile on his lips. Tony dropped him a thank-you wink. It was a small gesture, really, making sure Tony had that water, but it was more than appreciated. He hadn’t come right out and told anyone he wasn’t drinking anymore, but Steve had noticed. Noticed, and taken it upon himself to always have something else that Tony liked. He even brought him the occasional cup of coffee. It was decaf, sure, but Tony still drank it. Because
Steve brought his thumb up to his mouth and chewed.  He still hadn’t lost the habit even though his nail was practically non-existent by now.  Tony so wanted to take his hand and hold it.  If he was holding it, Steve wouldn’t be able to chew on it.  Tony could kiss it instead.  Try and take the hurt away his way.
Tony let it happen, just watching him silently, respectfully.  He never interrupted a man so obviously working through a problem.  It was a professional courtesy.  Plus, Bruce was adorable when he worked, and adorable-Bruce was always worth a look.
Steve shuddered and turned abruptly to go back into his own apartment, thinking of that. Thinking of that flawed logic. Thinking that Brock was one-syllable, and Obadiah was four. Hmm. Funny. Funny how those names both proved and disproved Tony’s theory. At least Brock was on the right side of things. Even if he
something wrong. Like he was cheating. But he kept doing it. Tony wasn’t here. He hadn’t been here. Not for years. Steve wasn’t cheating on him. In no way could what he was doing be considered cheating--just because he still felt that way didn’t mean anything. It didn’t make it true. “But we’re both here. We’re both...interested. Can’t we skip all the bullshit between now and ‘eventually’ and just go back to your place?”
,” he whispered, stroking his sweat-damp hair.  “I’ll always love you.  It’ll always be you and me.  No matter what happens.  I’ll never love anyone the way I love you.”
When he got home, Tony got out of the car, put his most contrite face on, and went inside.  “Hi, baby,” he said, tossing his keys into the bowl by the door.
Terror slipped into Tony’s heart.  Thunder crashed again; lightning followed somewhere close, somewhere just off the road, but Tony didn’t see or hear it.
“You’ll write to me every day, do you hear me?” she said, and he nodded. “And you’ll call me at every available opportunity. Okay? No. Exceptions.”
In fact, a small part of Tony actually pitied the man. But that didn’t stop him from laughing in his face. Again. Just because he wanted to. Just for the sake of appearances. “Thin ice, huh?” he sneered, and the fact that he heard his father in his own voice made him even more sick. “You’re really dragging out all the chestnuts tonight, aren’t you? You’ve been watching too much nostalgia-tv, dad. That’s Ward Cleaver at his finest.”
He shook his head as understanding turned his blue eyes gray.  “Oh no,” he whispered.  “No.  No, no, no.”  He looked up, helpless and cold.  “I did this.”
Steve ran a quick hand through his hair, and threw the door open. “Hey,” he said, happy and puzzled at the same time.
Tony squeezed Steve's hands again. “I’m all about consent, Cap, one-hundred-percent a go for consent, but you don’t have to apologize for holding my hand ten or whatever years ago.  In fact, I’m sorry.”
Jeff watched them for a minute, smiling at the way they were smiling at each other.  “I have to go.  Jen made spaghetti casserole for dinner.  She’ll kick my ass if I’m not home to eat it.”
Tony shook his head immediately. “No, Mrs. Rogers. I want you to stay.” He looked over his shoulder. “Steve? Stay?”
“It’s good to see you,” Tony said. “Right, Morgan?” he added, giving their joined hands a little shake. She clutched him tighter and took a step behind him, looking shyly up at Steve. “Sorry,” Tony said quietly. “She’s a little shy today.”
Steve went impossibly still.  Lying atop Tony, hovering over him, his eyes burned with dark want.  His breath was heavy but controlled.  His heart beat fast and light, but he didn’t move.  “We’ve never…”
feeling a little better. Just one more thing Steve had given him. One more thing Tony owed him for. But that was for later. Right now, he just squeezed Steve tight-tight-tight, lifted his head and kissed him. “Uh-huh,” he said. “Feed me.”
They came out into the common room, and the word had never felt so right.  After the time he’d spent with Steve, this place had never felt so common.  Tony looked at his watch as the portal closed.  They had went in at eleven-fifteen.  It was now twelve twenty-three.  Tony blinked, surreality making him dizzy.  It seemed he and Steve had spent hours,
For a moment, the image of him and Tony lying together on Tony’s bed invaded his mind. The feel of him against his chest, the smell of his cologne, the sound of his little sighs of contentment as Steve ran his fingers through his hair and along the smooth muscle of his neck. It had felt so good. So comfortable and warm. So much of what Steve wanted in a relationship--in a life--with someone.
Steve ran his hand through Tony’s hair, relishing the texture between his fingers. “It won’t be forever,” he whispered, kissing him again. “I will promise you that. Just another few years, and then I’ll-” a strange look passed over his face, both relieved and endearingly worried, “-retire. I guess.”
Howard watched him for a moment. It wasn’t the probing, intense gaze teenage-Tony had been used to, though. It was just curious. Just like his voice. Just curious. Not dangerous. He nodded. “That’s okay, son,” he said, then leaned forward, elbows on the table. “Did you hear about Peterson from Payroll?”
Tony watched him go through his messages feeling a happy tug at his heart.  He was grateful, so fucking grateful to the others for sending messages, for calling--”Peter called twice, Tony, we’d better get in touch tomorrow.”--for letting Steve know they still needed him.  That was huge right now.  As much as Tony wanted Steve to himself, wanted to sequester him away from the world at large, this outpouring of love from their friends meant just as much to Steve as anything Tony could do for him.  And the very fact that he could think that with no jealousy made him all the happier.
Steve nodded, looking up at him with a trust so complete it almost took his breath away. “Okay,” he said. He grasped Tony’s cock and stroked it with a firm yet delicate touch. “I don’t want to think about it right now, though,” he said, and sat up, wrapping his arms around Tony’s waist. He kissed his mouth. Kissed his neck. Bit into his shoulder. He thrust up against Tony, and he moaned beneath him. “Don’t want to think about anything. I just-” kissing him again, tongue in his mouth, hands on his skin “-just want this. Just this right now. Okay?”
He looked up from where his toe had been drawing in the dust, and Tony was standing at the edge of the clearing. That sad look was still on his face, but now it seemed even darker--even sadder--and that made Steve want to make him feel better even more.
Tony snapped the radio off as they got closer, and the street noise rushed in to take its place, but it still seemed quiet after the screech of guitar and banging drums they’d had for the last two hours. The sun was starting to set, and the smog painted the sky red-orange. Steve looked at it. Looked at the dying sun. He wondered what the sunset would look like over the lake. Wondered what it was going to look like in the desert.
Tony stepped closer, not just piercing Steve’s personal bubble, but shattering it.  He put his hands on Steve’s arms, touched them, ran his hands over them, gripping them almost desperately.  “I want you to forgive me.”
“Maybe,” he said, “but that doesn’t change it.  He needs to be with you, and I think you need to be with him, too.  It’s important.”
“It might have been,” Steve said.  “He might have been transferred early that morning and gotten caught in crossfire.  I can’t say for sure that didn’t happen.  All I know is there were no maneuvers from
Steve and Sarah stayed where they were for a moment, Sarah on the couch, Steve standing by his bedroom door. He could still feel Tony under his hand. Still feel the warmth from his body. But it was fading. Fading.
What had he been doing in the city today, anyway? Tony wondered.  He only had two classes on Friday, one at eight-thirty am, and one at one forty-five pm.  There wasn’t enough time to get to New York and back in between them, so he’d skipped at least one, and
There were no Christmas lights here, but the porch light was on.  Tony had left it on when he locked up this morning.  He’d known it would be dark when he got home.  He hadn’t known he’d have Steve with him.  He’d hoped, but hadn’t known, and now he looked at him apprehensively, worrying, but not showing it.  Wondering if he’d gone too far bringing him here.
Bucky put his arm around her and kissed her. Neither of them cared that Steve and Clint were sitting right there watching. Neither of the two men cared either. They just exchanged a look that was equal parts amusement, embarrassment, and just plain happiness. Happy that Bucky and Nat had this. Happy that they were happy.
Tony loved him in this scenario.  Just as he loved him in all the scenarios he had pictured him in over the years, and he was sure this kid, this Blake (or Black) kid, had went away feeling almost delirious with happiness after their talk.  Tony hoped so.  If this was going where he was afraid it was going, he hoped Blake had spent the rest of his young life able to call up his lunch with Captain Steve Rogers and see it as a perfect, happy memory.
Steve unlocked the door, and they stepped inside. He tossed the keys into the little bowl they kept by the door, then just stood there. He ran a hand through his hair and heaved a huge sigh. “So?” he said finally, and the suddenness and bite to it made Tony wince. “What the fuck, Tony? What were you thinking? Punching Thad in the mouth? I thought you were kidding when you called me at first. I thought, there's no way
Suddenly, Tony cocked his head in Sam’s direction. He smiled what Steve thought was his most charming smile, and he was glad it wasn’t directed at him or he would have had to call his boss and tell him he was sick or something and couldn’t work tomorrow after all. As it was, Sam was put in the spotlight, and Steve just sat back to see how he was going to get out of this one--or if he’d even try.
He dropped to one knee next to the bed.  Strange was right.  Tony could see he’d lost weight.  With a metabolism as fast as his, it would not have taken long to lose thirty pounds.  They would have had to feed him around the clock, if they were doing it intravenously, just to give him enough calories to keep his body functioning.  Did they induce a coma while they fed him?  Strange didn’t say, but it would make sense.  An inactive body burned less fuel, making it easier to keep him alive.  Tony could ask him.  Oh, wait, no, he couldn’t.
Tony stood up and took the first aid kit back into the bathroom.  Steve did not look after him.  While Tony had been sitting so close, holding his hands, it had felt as though all the oxygen had been leached from the air between them.  Only now did it feel like it was coming back, like he could breathe again.  Had Tony felt it?  That breathless sensation that sapped the strength from his muscles and left him feeling as weak as a newborn colt in a green field?  It seemed for a moment that maybe there had been
Tony paid the kid what he’d agreed over the phone then tucked an extra fifty into the kid’s pocket and laid a finger to his own lips.  “This can stay between us, ‘kay?” he said, and the boy’s smile grew impossibly wider.
He didn’t know how long they stood there, intertwined.  All he knew was that Tony tasted like sugar-laced coffee and smelled like some spicy cologne that made him think of dark cobblestone alleys and early-morning sunrises.  He knew that when he slid his hand under Tony’s t-shirt, the skin at the small of his back was smooth and hot.  He knew that he wanted him in every way imaginable and he knew that once he had him, he’d never be able to let him go again.
Steve’s eyes shone, looking at him like he was the only thing in the world.  Or, at least the best thing.  “Yeah?  You’d want to do that?”
To those who have read my previous series: You have more right to be pissed off at me than anyone. I am so so sorry! When the idea came to have Thaddeus Ross be Steve's secret boyfriend, I was appalled at myself. I still am.
Finally, he looked at Sam squarely.  Sam raised an expectant eyebrow.  “What was it like?” Tony asked.  “Steve and I don’t talk about it much, and Nat is vague.  I think she wants to spare my feelings.  But you can tell me, Sam.  Please.”
“Really?”  Steve looked at him finally, a tiny rueful smile on his lips.  “‘Cause it seems like every time we do, we wind up like this.  Pissed off and tired.”
Steve picked up one of the sandbags and hung it in place.  He was warmed up but had not even broken a sweat yet.  It was ten o’clock.  Hours before sun-up.  Hours to just let his body do what it wanted to do.  He struck out with his fist.  Again.  Again.  He circled the bag, hitting in rabbit-quick jabs that barely made the bag quiver.  But it felt right.
Steve curled his arm tighter around him. Pietro resisted for a second, then gave in and held him. Steve put his head on his shoulder. “I know,” he whispered. “I know. You deserve better than that.”
Tony put his forehead against Steve’s chest again. “That’s perfect. Perfect. Take me to bed, Steve. Just-Just take me to bed.”
He took a few steps toward the building.  It looked like it had once held cut logs and machinery.  Tony didn’t think it held anything now.  Except the lingering scent of lumber and machine oil.  Maybe a family of raccoons or skunks.  Maybe a few ghosts, too.  There could be some of those.
“Call an ambulance!” he yelled, but the kid was already on his radio, yelling in their location, telling them there was a man down, shots had been fired, self-inflicted wound, so get here
He glanced at his watch, saw it was only 3:03, and tried to relax. They’d be here. They’d be here when they got here, and not a minute before. His mom said that. He kind of wished she was here too. And yeah, he knew that was weird, wishing his mother was here on this pseudo-date, but it would be nice. Nice to have the company. If Tony didn’t show.
Steve hooked his arm around Tony’s waist, pulling him against his chest. “And I’ve got that stupid budget for the shelter,” he said bitterly, gesturing again to the pile of papers on the table. “Trying to pull money out of politicians is like a dentist trying to pull somebody’s wisdom teeth out through their ass.”
--would not sell their fucking soul to the devil himself just to be able to listen to the sounds Steve made as he came apart.
Thanks for reading! Another nice chapter, then we'll start getting into the real meat of this thing...
His eyes were still sparkling with residual laughter but when they met Tony’s, they seemed to soften just a bit. His lips did the same, easing from that million-dollar grin to something gentler but no less captivating. Tony felt something inside his gut do a little flip-flop. Probably just indigestion. Yeah. Indigestion. It had nothing to do with that smile. Those baby blues looking at him so sweetly. Nope. Not at all.
He dragged himself out of bed and into the bathroom. He had meetings today. Stupid fucking board meetings. Budget meetings. Even a goddamn lunch meeting, which he never usually allowed, but since the guy was only in town for three hours, and his business was actually pretty necessary, and Pepper had given him an ultimatum--either go to lunch or swap her for the dinner meeting
Steve took a step backward in the water, trying to keep the same distance between them. “I’ve been busy,” he said.
“No. You don’t have to go that far,” Steve said, and put something into Tony’s palm and closed his fingers over it. He knew what it was. He could feel the regular edge, the flat metal with the raised letters spelling out Steve Rogers’s vital information, the small round beads of the chain. “See?” Steve said, eyeing him. “I told you it was silly.”
“Shh.  I know.”  Words spoken into the sweet warmth of his mouth.  “It’s okay, baby, I’ve got you, alright?  Don’t worry.”
Tony knew Steve was with someone. Knew this was just a greeting of two old friends, nothing more, but he could not help the way his hand rose and first ran through his hair, then fisted tightly into it, remembering the way it felt with a nostalgic pang in his gut.
, yeah, of course, because deep down, no child--either young or old--really believes their parents are anything but immortal, untouchable, god-like creatures, even if they know better. So, shocked, yes.
Steve shrugged one shoulder, but he looked happy. “I just dump it in and turn it on,” he said. “Same as everybody.”
After dessert--simple ice cream and chocolate sauce that was absolutely perfect, in Tony’s opinion--Tony went back into the main living area. There was a gas fireplace built into the wall, and he turned it on before flopping down onto the couch. It was soft. A lot more comfortable than it had looked when he first saw it.
“It was the opposite of funny,” Tony said, but his hands had begun to roam up Steve’s back, pulling him closer.  He shivered as Steve’s teeth closed lightly on his earlobe.  “So, this is how you win arguments?  You’re not exactly following the rules of war,
“I’ll just go get a towel,” Steve said, and returned his kiss, soft and slow. “I’ll be right back, okay? Don’t move.”
?  Together?  Don’t you realize how sickened they would be by the thought of that?  The thought of you doing...whatever it is people like you do?  How disgusted they would be to have a faggot for a son?”
Tony stopped at the mouth of the hallway, watching him watching the city as if he did it all the time.  As if he belonged here.  He
Steve nodded, but he didn't need to. Another part of his body was already letting it be known just how much Steve liked it. How much he wanted it.
“I wasn’t going to tell you this,” Rhodey said, leaning forward and planting his elbows on his knees, “but I saw him yesterday at that burger place across the lake.”
“That’s my one-year coin,” Howard said. “I’ve got a few more hanging around now, but that’s the one that means the most to me.” He smiled a strange smile, dark yet hopeful. “Well, they
Had his voice always held that note of condescension? Steve wondered. Surely not. He would have heard it before now, wouldn’t he?
“I’m sorry?” Steve asked, but she ignored him and cut her gaze to Tony.  He didn't look at her, but when she went to his side, he touched the cool blue of her hand.
Sam raised one quizzical eyebrow. A little smile played around the corners of his lips. “Were we fighting?”
Tony had not asked about Thaddeus Ross.  He had not asked even after they saw a newsfeed about him being found wandering near a hospital in Wichita, incoherent, but with a small smile on his face.  As if he were existing in a state of pure, easy quiet. He had not asked if Steve had anything to do with it. He had not asked, and Steve felt no real desire to tell him.
To that end, he walked down the hall, but stopped short of his own bedroom door.  He opened the one that used to be Steve’s, and now was no one’s, but it was the last place in the Tower they had been together.  The last place where they had made actual, physical love together, and Tony wanted to keep that memory with him, keep it close to him, to give him strength until tomorrow when he would see Steve in the flesh again.
first choice.  You’re just the consolation prize.”  He looked him over, then twisted his hand out of Tony’s grip and stood up.  He wiped his hand on his trousers as if he’d touched something dirty.
There was a considering silence between the three of them.  Sam broke it, his voice kind. “Go on.  Tell us.  We can’t afford to be embarrassed.”
Steve thought about it for a minute, his tongue creeping out of his mouth to touch his lip, thinking about sitting in Tony’s car again, having him drive fast along the streets until they got to his, no doubt, huge apartment downtown. He thought about going up in an elevator with him, going through his door. He had never been to Tony’s house before, but he’d seen enough stuff on tv about how the other half lived to know that it would be big and beautiful, full of stuff that cost more than anything Steve had probably ever even
And to prove just how okay he was, Steve wrapped his arms around Jack’s waist and bent his head into the crook of his neck, kissing the skin there, sucking on it a little in the way that Tony had always liked, running his tongue over it. He closed his eyes, trying to lose himself in the moment, in the feel of a warm, responsive body in his arms. It was different. Different from Tony. For some reason, he thought it would be the same. That it wouldn’t matter
dreams, Barton,” he muttered. “Cash and prizes. Candy, diamonds, pills, hundred dollar bills.” He glanced at Steve. His face still burned brilliantly, but Steve had bowed his head, looking at his hands now. “You know. Stark Industries stock options. Not...not anything else.”
all did. Sometimes we got on each other’s nerves, but none of us cared much when we were getting ready to go to sleep.” He fell silent, the humor leaving his voice. “It got cold out there. Sometimes...” he said, then paused as if he was going to say something else but changed his mind. “Yeah. Sometimes it got really cold.”
probably being stupid. But Tony was never late when they made plans. He’d only been late the one time, but
The woman at the desk looked up expectantly when he reached the desk. “What can I do for you?” she asked.
Tony gave his cock one final squeeze, then the warm weight of him was suddenly gone from behind Steve's back. Steve bit his tongue, biting back any protest.
to think about it. Deep down, he knew if--when--he finally did think about it, it would become apparent just how much he should
He’d tried to lift Mjolnir once.  Everyone had been there, everyone had tried, laughing, watching each other fail.  Tony and Rhodey had pulled together, Clint, Bruce, only Natasha had abstained, that cat-like smile on her face.  Then Steve had stepped up.  When he touched the leather grip, hadn’t there been a tiny jolt of electricity?  He’d chalked it up as static build-up from the rug at the time, but now he wondered.  He also wondered if it had
He said his name at four o’clock, and Steve roused immediately, coming to full wakefulness in a second. His eyes darted from place to place, taking in his surroundings, and only when he realized where he was, did he relax again a little. Neither of them spoke, but Steve kissed him deeply before getting out of bed and going into the bathroom. Tony heard the shower again, then the sounds of him brushing his teeth, a time of silence where he was probably shaving, and when he came back into the bedroom, he was already dressed.
Tony stepped closer.  That dawning look in his eyes had been replaced by something else, something hot and knowing.  “You’re killing me with that look, soldier,” he said.  “Whatever puppy dog you borrowed that from needs to be put down Old-Yeller-style ASAP.  It’s clearly a threat to national security.”
The thought was a nice one.  A picnic lunch in the middle of nowhere.  Complete isolation.  They could even have sex out here.  The chance of anyone coming upon them was pretty small, and the thought of Steve sliding into him out here was pretty good.  But there was this to get through first.  This secret meeting in the shadows with a ghost.
“Besides, all I really care about is you,” Tony said, and now he did shake him a little.  “And it’s not just ‘a couple stupid classes’.  What you’re doing, Steve...God, it’s amazing.  It literally amazes me.”
“They’re like those annoying nerdy kids in high school who knew every answer and got 110% on every quiz.  God, I
“I’m not going to defend it,” he said weakly.  “They were necessary.  I believed in them.  People had died.”
He put his arm around her and kissed her temple.  She leaned against him.  “Tell us about the doctor,” she said.
The sheriff came toward him.  He was a big man.  Barrel-chested, tall, as big as Steve used to be before the one-two punch of the hospital and The Raft.  He took his cuffs off his belt.
Steve was in the kitchen when Tony got home. He was standing at the counter, holding a wooden spoon. The smell of red wine, and beef, and carmelized onions drifted through the room and wrapped Tony up like a warm hug. He hung his jacket up, groaning a little at how nice it was.
just out of his grasp, but Tony would get him there. Steve knew he would. He knew because Tony had told him he would give him everything he wanted, and that was what he wanted. Quiet. Peace. Mercy.
He parked his car, locked it, and started into the building, still musing about Steve, his cock already stiffening a little just at the thought of him. They’d had a few more afternoons in Steve’s twin bed, and Tony thought they were the best days of his entire life. He loved the sex--really
Like an arrow through the heart.  Why was Cupid always shown with a bow and arrow?  It wasn’t cute or sweet when an arrow pierced that most vital organ.  It hurt like a motherfucker.
“You did,” Tony said. “I think the stuff you said to her the night before you left, and then being there when you
forward to it. Even if he still had his reservations, he was looking forward to it. Every moment he spent with Tony--or even thinking about him--made the reservations he had seem a little smaller. A little sillier. God, that felt good.
--in common. That hadn’t meant much when they were kids, but it meant something now. Now, it meant a lot. It meant the world.
Tony hung back, letting Steve leave the office first.  When he was gone, Tony said, "You should have told me," in a low, icy voice.
Steve took his cigarettes out of his pocket, shook one out of the pack, and put it between his lips. He’d had Tony's cock between his lips so many times. He still thought about it. Still dreamed about it. He’d loved doing it. Loved bringing Tony to the edge with his mouth and his tongue. Loved feeling Tony’s muscles jump beneath his fingers. Loved it when he came, the way he’d go rigid, then relax, everything easing at once as he fell back, spilling into Steve’s mouth, sated, drifting. His eyes finding Steve’s down the length of his body. God, there’d been so much love in them then. So much happiness. So many forevers.
Steve said nothing, just stared at him with hurt, angry eyes, then stomped out of the house.  Tony heard the Mustang growl to life then speed away.
She laid her hand against his cheek, urging him to look away from Baxter, to look at her instead, to meet her eyes and take some solace there.  “Yes, you are.  If I can let it lie for now, then you can, too.”
He closed his eyes, listening to Tony’s quiet, easy breath, feeling that same breath puff against his bare skin, and now all he could think was that it was worth it. Everything he had gone through, everything he had done, and felt. All the pain he had endured. All the times he had
A rustle, cloth--sheets maybe--and Sam’s voice, perfectly calm, perfectly in control. “Where are you?”
When Steve was pulled away, most of Tony’s heart went with him.  Soldiers threw him to the ground and locked chains around his waist that caught his hands in cuffs, his feet in manacles.
That was all very good information, but Steve still couldn't help but think the main point was being glossed over.
, was he? Willie was, and he got 660. And did you see that catch he made in the ‘54 Series? Come on. We all know you did.”
is going to put you back in the ice.  Do you hear me?  Nobody.  I will never let that happen.  Alright?  And you’re getting out of here.  You’re coming home.  If I have to blast you out of here myself, you’re coming home.  Okay?  Baby?  Okay?”
He went outside afterward. He thought it was probably bad form to smoke on the church steps, so he took it down the block a little and stood with the other knot of people who had the habit, all of them in their Sunday best, three little old ladies and two other guys, none of them speaking, all of them saving their breath to suck on their cigarettes. Steve didn’t mind the silence. In fact, he liked it. He also liked the camaraderie. Even if they didn’t know each other. Even if they were quietly killing themselves and they all knew it, at least he wasn’t doing it alone.
“Because. I didn’t. Know. You,” Tony emphasized.  “If I wanted to know something now, I’d just ask you.  I’d talk to you.”
He got out of the shower, pulled on some sweats and a t-shirt, and left the bathroom. He wasn’t really thinking about anything. Just going through the motions of bedtime rituals. It was Sunday tomorrow, so he didn’t have to get anything ready for school, but he and his mother usually did a family breakfast Sunday mornings, so he got the coffee pot ready, and set the timer for eight. Mom would be home about then, and she would want coffee with her bacon and eggs. Steve usually opted for orange juice. He wasn’t much of a coffee drinker. He didn’t like the way it made him feel. Too jittery. Too on edge. Too much for a leisurely Sunday breakfast.
Sam considered him over his own beer, drank deeply, then sat it down.  “They were rough,”  he said.  “We lived rough.  We fought hard.  We were dirty, poor, hungry, tired.”  He ran a hand over his lips, his eyes far away, thinking.  “We weren’t together all the time, and that was hard on Steve.  No matter what we were doing, or how bad off we were, it was always better when we were together, but sometimes we had to split up.  That’s when the cracks would show.  That’s when he’d withdraw.  When it was quiet at night.”
heard something. Something about Peterson and a guy from the janitorial crew. And a janitorial closet. And since he knew firsthand how uncomfortable--and how fucking
take the year to quietly contemplate what he’d done to Steve.  What it felt like to be an animal in a cage.  Maybe some time away would actually change the son of a bitch.
Tony ran his hands over Steve’s chest down to his waist, then pulled him closer. Steve let out a breath, taking the chance to nuzzle into the crook of Tony’s neck while he rubbed up and down his back with long, firm strokes.
Steve stood listening, watching Tony’s indecision, the way he bit his lip nervously, the way his shoulders tensed. Steve moved to his side, gripped his upper arms gently, and turned him slightly so he could look into his eyes. “Tony,” he said earnestly, “you don’t have to go with him.” His eyes moved to Howard, swept him stonily. Howard gazed back, and Steve looked at Tony again. “I’ll take care of you.”
,” Tony said, then immediately wrinkled his nose in a way that was both disgusted and adorable at the same time, “but I am definitely not calling you that. I’ve never seen it myself, but I don’t live under a fucking rock. I know who the guy is.” He gestured vaguely. “He’s like a puppet-guy, right?
Steve pulled himself out of Tony’s grip and stood up.  He’d always been “Cap” when Tony was in a good mood.  Later, Tony started calling him “soldier”.  Steve noticed he rarely did it when the others were around.  It was a private nickname, just between the two of them, and Steve always felt a giddy pleasure whenever Tony called him that.  It felt intimate, like something a man would say to someone who was maybe more than just a friend.  Now, tonight, he’d been “Steve”.  Just “Steve”.  And hearing that had been the best of all.  He was only “Rogers” when Tony was angry.  Or when he was making fun of him.
“Everything’s okay, honey. Everything. I’ve got you. I’m going to make sure everything’s okay.” Tony pulled back so he could look into Steve’s eyes. He looked exhausted, but better. Easier somehow. “Is that okay?” Tony asked.
“Guess that’s true,” Steve agreed, then ran a hand nervously through his hair. “Feels a little weird.”
Mickelsen held up his hand. It was manicured and maintained. “Don’t worry, son,” he said. “We just want to make sure she’s fully-rested before she goes home. We’re pretty protective of her here.”
Silence from her end, and Tony waited to see if she would speak or hang up on him.  Thirty seconds.  Thirty long-ass seconds…
Steve ducked his head.  Glanced sidelong at Tony.  “Good.  I didn’t really want to see anyone there.  Thanks.”
Tony got out and stretched.  Steve wasn’t wrong: it was definitely quiet.  Birds chirped in the surrounding trees and the breeze through the leaves seemed like the loudest sound out here.  He looked across the lake.  There were a few other houses around, but not many.  He’d had FRIDAY do back-ground checks on all the neighbors.  So far, everything looked good.  There was one guy who was evading taxes, and a Mr. from one side of the lake was spending afternoon sack-time with a Mrs. from the other side, but that was all.  Boring stuff, really.  He’d keep checking, but they should be fine here, for now.  Boring was what Steve needed.  What they both needed.
“Who’s in charge?” Tony asked, glancing around.  “I need to talk to the boss, the warden, whoever the fuck--”
.  The bravery.  The decency.  The strength.  But the more time Tony spent with him, the more he believed Howard hadn’t known him as well as he thought he had.  Tony felt sorry for him then, and that was a new sensation because he’d never felt sorry for Howard in his life.  But hearing Steve talk baseball stats with Rhodey on the Tower's rooftop deck, or listening to Bruce try to explain climate change to him, Steve’s face serious, his questions thoughtful and curious, or just seeing him nap on the couch in the common room, lying on his stomach, arms around a pillow, hair falling over his brow and shining in the sun, Tony
When he woke up the next morning, he didn’t even think about that red sports car or the kid driving it. He did his morning routine. He had a couple messages when he checked, but he didn’t listen to them. He wanted to go out for his run. He felt kind of fuzzy this morning. He always did on Monday mornings.
Steve blinked, then the frown intensified.  Tony wanted to kiss those lines between his brows, tease them away with his lips and tongue, but he resisted.  For the moment, he resisted.
He was standing outside on the fire escape, the day drawing down into dusk when the kid first pulled up. Steve was on the eighth floor, but he could still hear the growl of the engine. It rose to a jungle-cat screech as the driver gunned it once before turning it off. Steve frowned a little. He heard a baby--Mrs. Stansfield’s from the sixth floor, he assumed--start to cry. Steve sighed. Mrs. Stansfield would have to rethink keeping her windows open during the evening if
Natasha looked at him.  It was one of those Rogues-only looks that Tony hated so much.  But he let it go on, let it happen without a word, praying Natasha could convey to him how important it was that he let Wanda take care of him.  What he was talking about--doing it the right way, putting the work in--was insanity.  Everyone in the room could see it except Steve.  So, let Nat give him a look, let her tell him with her eyes the way things were.  If it got the point across, then it was worth it.  Even if watching it made Tony feel like he was drowning in his own icy waters, and for him, there was no hope of a life preserver.
“I believe you,” Steve said.  “But being with me comes with a lot of...stuff.  There are things you can have with her that you can’t have with me.  Family.  Kids.  It’s too dangerous.  We can say we’re retired, but Vision was right--it is our strength that makes people want to challenge us.”  He smiled a small, complicated smile.  “We’re stronger together.  We always have been.  Haven’t we?”
“The same thing I’m going to say to you,” she said. “Not yet. Maybe someday. But not yet. This is your time. Your time to be together. To make something together. You have never been able to have that before, but you’ve got it now, and I want you to make the most of it.” She kissed the top of his head, and he curled closer in her arms, letting the sound of her voice lull him just like it always had. “Besides, it’s not like you’re going to be that far away. It’s only a few miles. We’ll still see each other almost every day. And you’ll still have your bedroom here and the apartment downstairs for when you want to spend nights. Nothing is really going to change.”
Pietro shook his head in defeat. “I know you did,” he sighed, and ran his thumb over Steve’s high cheekbone. “But, honey, that’s the problem. Don’t you get that? I can’t be with someone who has to
Tony breathed it in. Soaked in as much of it as he could. For the first time since yesterday at the watch shop, he actually
He pushed the thought away. Pietro was happy now. And while a small part of him was still a bit shocked that Pietro was with Clint, he knew Pietro was happy.
He leaned his head back against the mirror, eyes closed, hands balled into tight fists.  His breath felt hot in his throat, tasting metallic with need.  He was painfully hard, his cock not minding Steve’s violent outburst at all, deciding, in fact, that an angry Steve was exactly what it needed.  Tony wasn’t surprised--ashamed, but not surprised.  It had been this way for a long time, coming home after missions, rushing through debrief in Fury’s office so he could get back to the Tower and take care of his raging hard-on in privacy, jerking himself while replaying the mission in his head, the fight, the smoke, the dust, the blood, and everywhere, in his head, in his ears, everywhere, was Steve, Steve, Steve.
Steve had been a little embarrassed by the flush that crept up his body at those words, and when he sucked Tony down later that evening in bed, the words pounded in his own head:
Sam rolled his eyes. “‘A little’, Steve? God.” He shook his head, and gestured down the hallway. “Go to the art room sometime,” he said to Tony. “Ms. Carter has his stuff plastered all over the walls. He’s like a superhero down there.”
“Hi,” Steve said when Tony stopped in front of him. He was leaning against the counter. The suit was a dark navy, cut close to his body, as per Tony’s instructions, with a black dress shirt underneath. The tie--blue to match his eyes--hung around his neck, but it was untied, the ends hanging loose. He was still smiling. It was Tony’s favorite one, small and soft.
Strange turned on his heel and walked away, winding through the crowded city sidewalk like he didn’t have a care in the world.  Maybe he didn’t.  Maybe he was one of the lucky people who really didn’t give a shit what people thought of him.  Tony could fake it with the best of them, but he cared.  Too much, probably.
And Steve couldn’t stand it. For some reason, he couldn’t stand it anymore. He wanted this over. He wanted this to be done. He was tired of being afraid, tired of tensing up every single time he either saw this man, or even thought about him. And he’d thought about him a lot. A lot over the years. A lot more over the last few weeks, since he and Tony had been seeing each other again. Wondering how he’d handle this meeting, how
“No,” Pepper said, pulling away from Tony’s side and going to Strange’s.  “Tony says there’s something wrong with Steve Rogers.”
Tony leaned closer. His shoulder pressed against Steve’s, and he tipped his head until his lips were close to Steve’s ear. “It’s just a house,” he said softly, and there was no trace of humor, no trace of sarcasm. All Steve heard was warmth and comfort, and he felt his muscles ease in response. Felt some of the tension leave his body.
He checked his messages, and this time, he listened to them. One was the standard update he received every morning, but the other was all about this current situation. This situation with the kid. With Tony.
“Saved ya,” Tony murmured into Steve’s back. He didn’t let go. He kept his arms around him, kept his cheek against Steve’s faded denim jacket.
Tony glanced around to make sure they were still alone, then cupped his hand around the back of Steve’s neck. The ends of his hair brushed deliciously against Tony’s wrist. “I would never get upset,” he said. “You know that, right?”
She shrugged one shoulder, but she was smiling too, a soft faraway look in her eyes.  “A little.  But it’s nice.  A nice feeling to have.”
“The honeymoon phase is finally over, huh?” he said, and wiped his eyes again. “Better watch out. She’s going to start telling you to comb your hair and tuck in your shirt next.”
Tony ran his hand through his hair. Kissed the side of his neck. “So,” he said, “in case I didn’t make it clear, you look gorgeous.”
Tony let out a breath. “Steve-” he began, but Steve shook his head and gripped Tony’s wrists firmly in his hands.
,” he insisted. “We talked about it this morning. You...we made plans. A-a date. It’s not the same.”
Behind him, Steve sighed, deep and heavy. Tony turned to look at him. His hands were shoved into his pockets, his head against the door. There were lines between his brows. Frown-lines.
Steve was silent for a moment. Tony could feel him thinking, feel the tension in his muscles, the arms holding him almost thrumming. He wanted to tell him to stop thinking. Stop thinking about whatever he was thinking about because it was scaring him, but he didn’t. Part of him--that part that still wanted him--needed to hear what he had to say. Even if it broke both their hearts, he needed to hear.
So, he washed. He washed, and sometimes afterward, he would go outside and stand on the fire escape for a little while. He watched the people moving around below him, listened to the traffic and the sirens. And sometimes he wished he was down there. He
Ross turned, dapper in a tweed top coat--the dude had style, Tony had to admit--and began to pick his way across the frozen lawn to the garage door.
Tony turned the light off and laid down on the bed, still fully clothed.  He put his hand behind his head and stared up at the ceiling, thinking about it.
“Oh yeah,” Tony agreed.  “Nick said he hit the roof.  But, technically, they were right, so they’ve got him for now.”  He shrugged and peeled a little of the label from his bottle.  “It seems like a whole ‘who’s dick is bigger’ kind of thing.”
“‘Cause I really was only saying it for Bruce’s sake. He was all flustered this afternoon, and then tonight…”
Also, I never know about putting real things in fics, but I needed a dog, and someone just happens to own the cutest dog ever, so there's that now. Welcome to my world, Dodger!
“No?” Tony asked, and Steve could tell he was trying too. Trying to get past the idea of the July that wasn’t. “You don’t want to swim with the fishes, huh? Better than sleeping with them.”
The first few moments were a frenzy of lips and teeth and tongues, as they tried to fit years into their mouths.  Steve’s arms were like steel, holding Tony in place, pinning him beneath his body.  Tony’s hands were restive, running incessantly over Steve’s hair, his face, his shoulders, touching everywhere they could reach, leaving fire in their wake.
Tony patted his leg.  “Good man,” he said.  “But all this talk about corned beef is making me hungry.”
“Hey,” Tony said, coming between the two.  They were standing close together, but Tony wedged himself in and put his hand on Steve’s chest.  “Hey, I didn’t know,” he said, looking up at Steve.  “I didn’t know he was supposed to stay away from me.  Not when I went to him in the first place.”
“I don’t think so.” He touched the smooth surface of his skin, loving the broad expanse of his back. “
Steve sat patiently waiting in his chair outside the door.  He had his hands folded in his lap, his eyes steadfastly on them as Tony entered the room.
Tony smiled at him again. This time it was a little darker. A little more flirtatious. “I’ll hold you to that,” he said. “And just so you know, coffee can’t be combined with lunch.” He held up two fingers. The nails were painted a dark shimmery blue. Steve’s stomach flip-flopped. “So that’s two you owe me.”
Tony laughed. “How the fuck do I know?” he said, pressing his lips to him again. “What do grandmas do? I never had one.”
Steve’s eyes flashed again, staring into Ross’.  Tony rolled his own in exasperation.  He turned around, keeping himself between them.  It seemed safest.  Not for himself, of course, but for both of the other two men.
“Come on,” Tony coaxed, and shook his jacket again like a kid, making Steve smile a little. “I like you. I don’t care about any of this. I don’t want you to care about any of it either, okay?”
This one's a little long. But there's a lot of ground to cover. This is the last chapter of the "high school" portion of the story. Next one will start to delve into the "adulthood" section. None of those will be as in-depth as the high school, but they'll each be an important moment for our guys.
Steve took a deep breath and let it slowly out. “I don’t really know what happened after that. I must have walked. Or maybe I ran. I don’t know. I’m pretty sure I just left my cart of groceries in the middle of the store, though. I know I didn’t pay for them, and I kind of remember just walking out the door. I-I don’t think I
see one dog off the leash. It was kind of a reddish-brown and white, not too big, but filled with an exuberant energy. It was romping around, snarfing through the underbrush, and looking like it was having as good a time as Morgan was. Tony watched it, tensing up just a bit when it saw Morgan and started bounding toward her. She saw it and a large, sunny grin broke out on her face.
Steve took a step closer, almost as if he couldn’t help it. Like he was being drawn in. “It was...better last night,” he said quietly, then touched Tony’s other hand with his own, timid in a way Tony never knew an ex-soldier could be. “You know?” Steve said. “Here? With...” He smiled through downcast lashes, and those fireworks went off again. Like D.C. on July 4th.
“Yeah. We need to keep that between us.” He ran his hands up and down the broad expanse of Steve’s back and sighed contentedly. “She’s great, by the way,” he said.
It wasn’t until he’d gone through three bags and his knuckles were a bloody ruin, that he knew he needed to apologize. Tony had been wrong to say anything about Nat, but Steve’s own hostility had come from a place not as entirely chivalrous as he’d first wanted to believe: Tony had seen Nat kissing him and Steve felt guilty.  Guilty for the act, guilty for liking it, and guilty because deep down, it felt like a betrayal.  A betrayal of Tony and Steve’s feelings for him.  Tony had probably felt that guilt and sense of betrayal coming from Steve and fed off it.  He was extremely intuitive.  Steve’s anger had fueled his own.  It was the only explanation that made any sense.
“Hey, buddy,” Steve said quietly, bending down to ruffle his fur, and laughing to himself when the dog swiped his face with his tongue. “Gross, Dodge,” he said, but it was more than fond. He scratched him behind the ears with both hands, then planted a kiss to the top of his head. “Where’s Mom?”
“That’s good.  I wanted it to be true.  So much of what I thought back then was...mixed up.  I didn’t want that to one of them.”
John turned out to be a pleasant, level-headed guy who seemed enthusiastic about what S.I. could deliver in terms of clean energy. He asked clear questions, and was very eager to talk about the details, which would have been fantastic, if it hadn’t cut so much into Tony’s evening plans.
dangerous, but then Tony would look at him with such desire in his eyes--and something else, too. Something soft and gentle--and then he wouldn’t care about the danger anymore for a while. All he cared about then was making Tony happy. Making them both happy.
“I don’t want you spending any more time with him,” Howard said with a deadly patience. “You’re done.”
Tony slid closer. He was working against Steve’s steadying hands, but it wasn’t really that difficult. “Mmm. Forest fire. Yeah. Yeah. I want that. Let’s do that instead.”
“Steve,” Tony said, and shivered when he felt the brush of Steve’s lips on the juncture of his shoulder and neck, just above the collar of his shirt.
, in Tony’s arms on that grassy little hill in Central Park, and now here he was, using a leg that had been so much useless meat, to help boost him into bed.  He was wearing that Yankees t-shirt.  His face was smooth and clean.  His nails short and healthy pink inside their beds.  Tony wanted to wrap him in his arms and never let him go.  He wanted to sit on a beach with him somewhere and drink Mai-Tais while the sun went down over the water.  He wanted to watch him tie his shoes, and hear his voice over the phone, and yell at him for not wearing his helmet when he rode his motorcycle.  But mostly he wanted this--to lie beside him in bed with the darkness kept at bay by a pane of glass and a cozy bedside lamp.
She took his hands and started backing toward the door. “Keep talking, babe,” she said. “Clint’s keeping Nick all night. So keep talking.”
Sorry.”  He pulled away fast once he realized what he was doing.  Once he realized how close he was, how tightly he was clinging to a person he was no longer allowed to cling to.  A red blush the color of bricks stained his cheeks.  “I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean to--” he flapped a hand at Tony like that explained everything.  Tony supposed it did.
Tony closed his eyes. His hand, still covered in a drooping bandage, rose and rubbed his forehead. “Baby,” he said softly. “God, baby, I’m sorry. That is not anywhere even close to where my head was at tonight.” He dropped his hand and moved closer to Steve. He reached out a tentative hand, and even though Steve had not let him touch him all night, he let him now. He let Tony brush his finger along his cheek, and then back into his hair. “Steve. Honey. I trust you completely.
He had lost the need for a drink, but he still wanted a cigarette. With Sam here though, he thought he could hold out another hour, anyway.
But Tony wasn’t in town. He was out there, at his new school, proving to the world that he was anything but mediocre.
But those were just dreams, like the ones he had of Tony soft and pliant in his arms.  Not real.  And that electricity had been a static charge released by his skin on the wood.  Nothing more.
No. He couldn’t ask that. Not that. His tongue could never form those words, so instead, he just asked, “It’s good though, right? I-I make you feel good? Don’t I?”
“Yeah,” Tony said. “Do you want to? I want to. If that’s okay? I get it if you’re mad and don’t want to, but I want to. I want to see you. I kind of need to see you. Please? Steve? Please?”
sure about that one--if anyone could afford a high-end custom toupée, it was Howard Stark--but no one came to a cancer-treatment center unless they had to.
seeing everything, translating it into color and shape and shade, and he hated himself for it. Hated himself for seeing everything as he would see it in a painting made by a meticulous, perfecting hand.
He looked up, and even though he was trying to keep his anger in check, he could feel it bubbling under the surface like lava, getting ready to explode.  “And I’m not exactly thrilled to hear my best friend and my boyfriend have been talking about me behind my back.  That smacks of betrayal, Steve.”
him. Missed teasing him, and making him laugh, and seeing his eyes light up whenever Tony came into the room. Missed talking to him. Missed just being around him. He missed him.
Despite the rain, despite the slick roads, Tony punched the gas pedal to the floor.  The sedate old Bentley groaned, but she sped up, trying to oblige his frantic request.
“Come upstairs with me,” Steve repeated, then finally slipped his arms around Tony’s waist and held him closer.  “I don’t know if I’m ready to
He lit a cigarette while he waited for the connection, thinking how crazy it was that he could pick up a phone in one part of the world, and she could answer it in another with hardly any lag at all. Back in the day, they’d probably had to do this kind of thing by letter, or telegram, or whatever. Not now. Now the news of dismemberment and death could be had at the touch of a few buttons. He didn’t know whether that was a good thing or a bad thing.
They drove home in silence as bitter as the dregs of Tony’s coffee.  When they pulled up, Tony turned the car off, got Steve’s chair out of the trunk, and wheeled it to the passenger side.
He doodled occasionally on a bit of napkin or the edge of a letter he would send to his mother, but years since he’d set up his oil paints, stuck his brushes in a cup, and really, actually worked on something real. Years since he’d done it. Years since he’d
But there wasn’t.  In fact, there were no bottles there, at all.  There were, however, a handful of bills sitting anchored under an empty glass.
Tony kissed him, swallowing his moan of pleasure when Steve spilled into his fist.  He stroked him through it, then palmed his own erection slowly until Steve opened his eyes.
And the words themselves carried weight.  Precious, perfect weight.  Was Steve really saying forever?  Was he really promising Tony his life?  God, if that were only true.
Steve closed the distance between them one last time. He pressed his lips gently to Tony's, feeling the warmth they had between them stronger than ever before. "Me too."
But he was on the phone with Billy from town who was going over the roster for the adult basketball team they had been thinking about.  Billy was of the mind high school students would be perfectly fine to have on the team as long as they were at least seventeen.  Jack, Billy’s brother-in-law, and a member of the
Steve didn't like Tony's pick.  Sure, it had been the first time they'd kissed, the first time they'd admitted their attraction to each other, but it was also the day before another anniversary, and this one was not nearly as pleasant.
Tony stood by the door. His hand was behind him, resting on the knob. Steve wasn’t sure if he’d locked it or not. He supposed it didn’t really matter. It wasn’t like they were going to fall into each other’s arms. That was over. That part of what they’d been was gone. Just looking at Tony’s desk solidified that. Looking at the photos there. The photos of his daughter. His wife. His family.
Sure, he may not have had much occasion to do it lately, but that didn’t mean he wanted to be fired from it. Or pass it on to someone else. Or watch that someone else do it. Or
She pulled out the tiny Derringer.  It had a pearl handle, the barrel, rose gold.  “Oh, it’s pretty,” she said, then looked up at Tony, horrified.  “I--” she shook her head.
Steve hung back, letting Tony go out first, letting him get out the door.  When he was sure he was out of earshot, Steve glanced up again.  “Thanks, FRIDAY.”
Steve sighed. He ran a hand through his hair, then sat down next to Tony. He leaned into him. “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
A thousand emotions ran over Steve’s face when he saw him.  Tony watched them all, named as many as he could--apprehension, fear, worry, longing.  He looked for love, but either it wasn’t there, or Steve kept it hidden.
Tony and Sam cracked up, shouting laughter at the sky.  Steve rolled his eyes, and Natasha cast a small, cat-like smile in Bruce’s direction.  Bruce’s face grew alarmingly red and he downed the rest of his beer.
I haven't abandoned this story! I've been so bogged down with work and boring adult stuff that I haven't had any time to write, and this chapter shows it. Sorry. I'm trying hard to get back into a normal routine again, so hopefully regular updates and better writing will happen:)
Tony felt his pulse quicken.  He’d been aware of the low heat in the pit of his stomach since Steve’s thumb had pressed into the jut of his hip bone, aware of it slowly building as he applied the razor to his skin.  But now, watching the deliberate, meticulous way he maneuvered it around his jaw and lips, Tony felt his arousal growing dangerously.
“Blah, blah, blah,” Bucky said loudly, then shouted over his shoulder, “Are you hearing this fucking bullshit, Rogers? I mean, Jesus Christ. This man’s gone. We need medevac.”
So, the party wasn’t as fun as it could have been--should have been--but it was still a lot more fun than he’d had lately, so Tony couldn’t complain. He hung out in the shallow end with Bruce, watching Clint and Rhodey take turns doing cannonballs into the deep water, and when he got tired of that, he tipped over Happy’s unicorn-shaped pool float and spent the next fifteen minutes staying just out of his reach before finally letting himself get caught and dunked underwater while everybody laughed.
Sarah laughed softly, then lay back. “Promise me you’ll go home after the surgery, okay? It’s not going to do you or me any good to hang around here all day long. I want you to go home. Eat. Shower. Sleep. Okay?”
“I’d be happy to talk to the Chamber of Commerce,” Tony offered, doing the head-tilt that usually sealed the deal, unconsciously.  “My friend and I will be here for at least a few months.  We should be involved in the town’s recovery.”
He took a step back now under the cold weight of those eyes, but then he stopped.  Every fiber, every molecule, every atom that lived within his skin told him to run.  These men and women were heroes.  He had no place among them and the very idea that he ever actually thought he had, defiled them.
Steve ran a hand through his own hair, looking a little like a kid.  That made Tony smile.  “In a goddamn prison,” Steve muttered.
He was still tall. Wearing a wool navy overcoat that hit him mid-thigh and just skimmed a body that was still well-muscled, but maybe a little thinner. The hair that used to be golden blonde was a little darker now, a little longer than Tony had ever seen it, touching the collar of his coat. He’d kept the beard, and even now, even in this cold, dreary, rainy afternoon, Tony longed to touch it. Longed to run his fingers over it.
Thad blew out an irritated puff of air between his pursed lips--lips Steve had kissed a multitude of times--and rolled his eyes again. “You really are something else sometimes, do you know that?” He folded his arms. Gazed at him with an eyebrow imperiously raised. “First you ignore my calls this afternoon-”
Tony slumped in his seat.  “Okay.  Look, I’m just going to say it.”  He looked Strange in the eye.  “I want Wanda to come fix this.  She can do it.  We both know she can do it.  I want her to do it.”
Tony kissed his mouth, thrilling at the feeling of so much Steve Rogers around him, with him, right in front of him, touching him with his large, steady hands, licking into his mouth with his soft, imaginative tongue.
friends.  Steve thought that might have something to do with Natasha.  That slight jealousy both he and Clint seemed to have when it came to her.  At one point or another, they had both laid claim to her, even though neither had truly owned her.  Steve didnt think any man--not even Bruce--could claim to have owned Natasha Romanov. But it had always been there, nonetheless.  That feeling of friction between them, of wanting to be the one she loved most. Now, that was gone. Now, sitting here with him, all Steve felt was comfort and understanding.  And he felt the wall he had put up crumble a little. That was good. That felt good.
She took his hand, and Bruce sat on the arm of the couch beside her..  “I know.  I believed in them, too.  It wasn’t the wrong decision, Tony.  Just, maybe not the right...framework.”
He stared out the window at the scenery rushing by. Or as much of it as he could see anyway. It was mostly just shadows looming out of the dark then disappearing again as the bus roared by, or a random building or clump of trees illuminated by an on-coming car’s headlights. However, if he craned his neck just right, he could see a tell-tale glow on the far horizon. He knew what that was. It was the sight he’d been dreaming about for the last three weeks. The sight he’d been wishing for ever since he and the rest of the folks with him--tired, hot, frustrated, and low-grade pissed off, the whole lot of them--climbed aboard the bus. That glow that was a billion bright lights illuminating the sky. That glow that was New York.
It took another twenty minutes. Just twenty. But as he drove, it felt like the air between them became pure electricity. Steve didn’t touch him anymore, and Tony was glad. He thought if Steve had touched him, he would have had to pull the car over onto the side of the road and just have him right there, and to hell with anyone who drove by.
Steve ripped Tony’s shirt open, sending a button flying, biting at his neck and linking his ankles around Tony’s knees. “You,” he said. “I want
Steve laughed. He loved this. He remembered this. This part of being in Tony’s life. It was a part they had not been able to enjoy much since they were teenagers. The sex-part they got a little. Sometimes it was
They got the tire fixed as quickly as possible, and everyone climbed back up onto the bus. It was twilight, shadows dark and lingering, crowding around them all, wrapping them up in a shroud of silent gloom. They all felt it.
Sarah was in the kitchen finishing dinner when he got to her place. He hugged her and gave her the flowers.
Tony laughed again softly. Gently. “Yes. Yes, we are.” He kissed Steve’s lips again, then brushed the fingers of one hand over his eyelids, closing them. “Stay here.”
Gina held his hand.  “It was a good move,” she said, and Tony felt worse.  Maybe he should have acted like a jerk.  Maybe it would have made it easier in the long run.
Pepper wasn’t as obvious, but as Tony spoke to the knot of people surrounding them, her lips quirked into the same expression Steve had felt on his own face--half fond, half exasperated, and pulled Tony closer to her side. When he continued to speak, gesturing expansively and spilling his drink, she finally covered his mouth with her hand. Tony gazed at her, adoring and chastised, removed her hand and kissed the palm.
If you want to stop here on this cheesy little happy ending (yeah, I know it is, sue me), please feel free to do so.  However, if you choose to continue on the rest of this ride with me, please know that several of the remaining stories in this series contain some very dark things that may be upsetting to some people.  At one point, I was so upset myself I stopped writing for two weeks.  I debated whether to post them at all, but decided if I was going to do this, I would see it through until the end.  I will do my best to tag each story appropriately to let you know what is in each one in case you want to tap out.  The ratings will also go up.  Not only for violence.  There are some nice things in here too.
“We gotta go anyway,” Steve said, digging a leash out of his pocket and clipping it to Dodger’s collar.
Steve thrashed to a stop, shocked at the sudden interruption. His eyes flew to Tony’s face, wide and wild for only the briefest second before they turned professionally blank. Tony’s heart cracked just a little. It was the way they had regarded him for the last sixteen days.
“Yeah, I promise. Just...ask me soon, okay?” he said, then sunk his teeth into Steve’s plush bottom lip. “And quit stealing my line, you bastard.”
After the movie, they went to the diner. No one would ever make the mistake of saying it was a nice place, not with its Formica table tops, vinyl booths, and fluorescent lights, but it was a
Tony let out a breath.  That had been a low blow.  “You’re right,” he said.  “I’m sorry.  I know that’s not what you meant.”
Tony huffed out a laugh and dropped his head onto Steve’s chest. When he lifted it a moment later to look into Steve’s eyes, his own were dark and solemn even as a smile played around his lips. “Yeah, baby,” he said quietly. “I promise.”
“It’s not selfish to ask for help when you need it, Steve,” he said, but he couldn’t help the way his heart fell just a little. He'd wondered since it had happened. Wondered a lot. Especially since it still would not have been too late nine months ago. They still could have made it work.
By the time they left, Dave was bowling a 200 again.  Tony was at 240 in spite of his hangover and perpetual semi.  Steve was a menace.  A foul-mouthed menace when he wanted to be, and Tony couldn’t wait to get home.
Tony fixed him with a stern gaze.  “That stays here, Sam, ‘kay?  If Pepper ever found out I said that--”
“I know.  And they’re not going to get away with it.  Doctor Baxter here has given me all the information we need, and he’s going to be very cooperative when it’s time, aren’t you, Doctor?”
Tony moved the chair into position, set the brake, then stepped back.  He watched as Steve gripped the arms and pulled himself into it.  He got hung up on the footrest, but Tony left him alone.  Steve reached down, balancing with one hand, and pulled his leg into place with a wince of pain.  He settled back and just breathed for a minute, head bowed, eyes closed.  Tony had no idea of the amount of pain that caused the wince or the deep breathing.  Steve didn’t like to talk about it, and he didn’t press.  But he knew it had to be a lot.  Excruciating for a normal man, maybe.  He found himself thanking any and all gods that Steve was not a normal man.  He did that a lot now.
Howard looked at his feet for a moment, then back up. His eyes were uncertain, almost...nervous? But that couldn’t be. Steve didn’t think there was any way that could be. Even when they’d seen each other at the hospital, Howard had been nothing but cool and collected even though he’d been suffering through chemo treatments at the time. But he didn’t look that way now.
Steve nodded, smiling.  “I wish there was something I could do for you.  For taking care of him.  And me.”
He didn’t say anything about it, but sometimes he wondered if Tony could hear it too. He wondered if that’s why Tony did it. He hoped so.
Tony shrugged.  He’d offered, but the father was insistent.  They were close to the same age.  The guy wasn’t in Tony’s league, but he didn’t look hard-up, either.  Why shouldn’t he get the check if he wanted to?
He’d cried a little then. He wasn’t a baby--he was almost twelve now!--and he knew it was stupid and he shouldn’t cry over someone he had really only known for a year, but he couldn’t help it. For that year, that long, glorious, whirlwind year, Tony Stark had been the best thing he had. The brightest spot in an otherwise dark existence where his father was dead, his mother worked too much, and Steve himself had no other friends, and no desire to try and make friends. An existence where he was angry all the time. Hurting all the time. Confused all the time. An existence where he felt something inside himself crying out for someone, something--
Tony nodded. “Yeah, baby,” he said quietly, almost horrified to realize he was close to tears. “I’m fine.”
Tony shifted, twisting so he was on his side facing him.  “No, it’s okay,” he said.  “I don’t mind telling you some of it.”  Steve was silent, listening, so Tony went on.  “I talked mostly about Howard at the start.  I know he loved me, but he didn’t like me very much.  I was always a disappointment to him.”
Just a quick note:  I am a sloppy researcher.  I usually just spend three minutes on Google, then put enough facts in to make my B.S. sound semi-believable.  Sloppy research worked for me in my Algebra 1030 class.  Sort of.  And a shout-out to my professor who gave me a pity C- when I told her I was going to have to drill a hole in my head like that guy in the movie "Pi" so I could sleep at night after all of her freaky mathematical concepts gave me nightmares.  They actually did.
He turned back to Steve.  “Hey, you wanna--” he stopped.  Steve was gone.  He was alone in the driveway.
He didn’t look up when Tony entered the room, glass in hand.  His eyes were trained on the bed, indecision spelled neatly out in his posture, the slight cock of his head.
He was doing the same now, breathing slow and deliberate, and Tony loved how he turned into a contented kitten in his hands.
Tony bent over and kissed him. It was soft, sweet. “I’m going to help you with that now, okay?” he said. “No more sleepless nights. No more nightmares. Okay?”
It was viciously hot.  And Tony was viciously hard.  He unbuttoned his jeans and took himself in hand, working his own cock fast and hard.  Steve was close, so very close, and Tony was too.  His hand moved faster, and when Steve came down his throat a moment later, Tony was not far behind.
Tony closed his eyes.  Only Steve.  Only Steve would consider a beat-down over a bully no big deal.  “How badly are you hurt?”
“Sometimes stuff like that,” he smiled nervously, ran a hand through his hair, “makes me remember how different I really am.”
, I need to get out of the pool, so will you turn around, or close your eyes or something so I can get out and put some clothes on?”
“If you’re going to kill me, would you please just do it?” Ross said, then his eyes flicked to the picture on the table.  “All I ask is that you clean up the mess.  Don’t make my wife come home to that.”
Steve gave him a distracted look, then looked at Morgan, almost as if he was just barely seeing her. “She’s so big,” he said, gently. “She’s beautiful.”
The corner of Tony’s mouth ticked upward, but the tiny smile didn’t reach his eyes. They were dark and hollow, distracted, barely even meeting Steve’s at all. “Hey.”
And then there’d been Steve.  He’d come into Tony’s life like a cannonball, all solid and stubborn and passionate.  He’d been very little like the man Howard had spoken of when he was feeling nostalgic.  Of course, that man was
"Thanks for coming to pick us up," Tony said, trying to get him to say something--anything--but Steve kept his face forward. Tony tried to think if he had ever seen him so mad, and he couldn't do it. The image of his little, pleased smile kept getting in the way. He hoped he'd get to see it again sometime soon.
Tony kissed him some more.  Steve relaxed some more.  “Your mouth says no, Steve, but your body says yes.”
“Oh, this is an old one,” Tony answered, his own breath short as wave after wave of pleasure crashed through him.  “I just had to wait for you to get better before I could show it to you.”  He stopped moving, concerned.  “Wait, you
Steve kissed Tony to soothe his feelings.  It worked.  “You’re right, Tony.  I’m sorry,” he said, and looked at him through lowered lashes.
Tony’s parents had never hung photos on the walls. They had a Picasso, and a Dali, and a painted portrait of Maria that Howard had commissioned after she died, but no family pictures. Tony stood in front of them, smiling a little at a tiny, three-year-old Steve sitting in a pile of green Christmas paper, Steve at eight standing astride a bicycle, him as a baby wrapped in a blanket, a dozen others.
“He is dangerous,” Tony agreed.  “But only to dangerous people.”  He leaned forward again.  “Does that include you, Ross?  Is that why you’re afraid of him?”
Tony nodded--he wasn’t. It hurt--and eased himself the rest of the way down into the tub. “Sure I am,” he said, ignoring the pain, knowing he’d bruise, trying as hard as he could to keep that out of his voice. He settled back with his legs dangling over the edge, and turned his head to look at Steve. “Hi.”
Tony's hand went to Steve's hair.  They had always been very physical with each other--touching, kissing whenever they could, but now it was almost like a compulsion for both of them.  Ever since Steve's admission about what was happening to him, neither one felt right if they weren't touching the other. Steve never even thought about co-dependency anymore.  Who gave a shit about buzz-words in the face of actual, impending death? All he cared about was being as close to Tony as he could, as often as he could. Tony had been right when he'd said Jeff and Jen should have had another twenty-five years.  It wasn't fair. Shuri had given him eight. An
?”  He looked up at the ceiling, imagining Steve up there, lying on his bed, all cozy beneath the covers.
His voice was quiet, his eyes moved restlessly, picking out mundane things and turning them into something fantastical.  She was silent, and he was just getting ready to ask again, when she spoke, her voice as hushed as his own.  “Captain Rogers is in the bedroom.  Be careful, boss.  He isn’t himself.”
Bucky and Gabe kept at it, both extolling the virtues of their choice for greatest player ever, but Steve let their voices fade away to a quiet hum, letting them become background noise. He took his cigarettes out of his pocket and shook one out, tapped it on the base of his thumb, then stuck it in his mouth. He patted his pocket for his lighter and lit his cigarette. He glanced down, putting his smokes away, and when he looked back up, he stopped moving.
“That wasn’t me,” Steve said, shaking his head.  He slowly rolled his hands into fists, then opened them again, watching the veins in his forearms.  “That was a different man.  A
Tony held out his hand and beckoned Steve closer with a curl of his index finger. “Maybe later,” he said. “Let’s snuggle for a while.”
“There are still threats out there, Stark,” he’d said.  “We need to neutralize them before they become too big to handle.”  His eyes had gone to Steve’s sleeping form, small in the hospital bed.  “We’re already a man down, and I don’t think Barton’s coming back.  We need you.”
“Number two,” Tony said, looking at him quickly, before glancing back at the road.  “There is literally
couldn’t be right because that smelled like pancakes, and not only was he still in bed, but Morgan didn’t even
Sarah kissed the top of his head and curled her arm around him, holding him just the way she had when he was a little boy. And maybe he should have felt strange letting her do that, but he didn’t. He loved that too. “Yes,” she said simply. “I had my man,” she said. “
Steve’s heart took an unexpected jog in his chest, thumping harder than it had while he ran, that was for sure. He cleared his throat, trying desperately to look like he was not currently engaging in some kind of internal struggle to stop himself from staring at this
. So what if he couldn’t stop thinking of home lately? So what if all he wanted was to go to the movies with Sam? Or listen to Mr. Barker tell his one stupid joke? So what if he would actually consider murder if it meant he could have one bite of his mother’s Sunday pot roast? Would contemplate slow, painful suicide to wake up in his own bed in New York just one last time?
“Come here,” Steve said, and pulled him closer, into his arms. Tony came and melted immediately against him, tucking his head under Steve’s jaw, letting him wrap his arms around him, letting him hold him close and press a kiss against his temple. “Hey,” Steve said again, running a soothing hand up Tony’s back. “Really. What’s the matter?”
He watched her and his own intuition began to add things up on a big mental chalkboard. So, later, after dinner was gone, and the leftovers were put away, and they were sitting at the table with pieces of pie and cups of hot coffee, and he asked her what was wrong, he wasn’t totally surprised when she told him.
, right at the end of the Thanos thing.  He’d nearly forgotten what it was like, what it was like to have Steve towering over him, his head bent, his back curved, his hands on him, his mouth on him.
A runner of scarlet escaped his mouth as he drew in another breath.  The silence seemed very loud as they waited for the next one.  Instead, they heard the unmistakable thunder of the Iron Man suit overhead.  It flashed across the sky, the same red as the blood staining Steve Rogers’ mouth.
. Just a fight with a bunch of losers who thought they could take over the world. Tony, Steve, Nat, and Clint took the call. There was some talk about calling Thor in, but it would have taken him longer to get the message than it would take for the other four to just take care of it, so that’s what they did. On the way there, Nat called Bruce and asked him to contact Thor anyway. They were having a barbecue on the roof as soon as they were done, and Bruce and Thor’s presence was mandatory. Tony insisted she tell him it was not only because Bruce made the best pasta salad in the Northern Hemisphere, either. Tony just missed seeing his face.
Steve opened his eyes in the dark.  Tony felt his look and opened his own.  “That’s okay, right?” Steve asked.  His face was serious, his eyes dark, those three worry-lines between his brows.
He didn’t get nervous much, but he was nervous now. He knew he had a reason to be. If there was any situation on earth that warranted a good, old-fashioned case of the butterflies, it was this one, but it still felt weird. He was Tony Stark, for Christ’s sake. He didn’t get nervous.
He got in the elevator and rode it up. School was going to be out soon. One month. He could leave now and still be fine. He’d already been accepted to MIT. He didn’t really need to finish out the year, but he would. If he hadn’t gotten with Steve then he wouldn’t have bothered, but he
Tony held his arms out to either side and spun in a slow circle.  “Free and clear,” he said.  “You?”
Now Tony was standing against the outside wall of the school, his back against the brick. School hadn’t started yet, the bell hadn’t rung, but he was there anyway. He’d been doing that a lot lately. Getting to school earlier. He never admitted to himself that he was doing it so he could watch Steve walking in from the bus stop down the street, pretending that he was walking toward
“Hey,” Steve answered, heard the hitch in his voice, cleared his throat, and tried again. “Hey. Tony. Hey.”
He shook his head as he passed the cop car on the side of the road.  Long thoughts.  Long, stupid thoughts.  He snapped the radio on, found The Beatles doing “Can’t Buy Me Love”, and sang along.
Steve pulled away, ducking his head and swiping at his cheeks with the back of his hand. “What are you doin’ here? Don’t tell me you’re visiting your dad?”
She tightened her grip and Tony was thrilled for one second that she was on his side and would never really try to hurt him.  She could have snapped him in two.
Steve picked it up, waited until Sarah’s back was turned, then dropped a quick, silent kiss to Tony’s lips. “Suck up,” he muttered, and Tony smiled at him with an evil glint in his eye.
His thoughts turned to Bucky again, his oldest friend, his dearest friend, and then to Sam and Wanda who had stood by him when no one else had.  Natasha was the only one left of his little family of rogues, and he missed her keenly.  He hoped wherever she was, she was with Clint tonight, and just like Tony and Rhodey, that was only right.  They’d been partners and friends long before she and Steve had ever even met, but the loss of her still stung.  They’d grown so close during those months on the run, and many nights had found them huddled together under a threadbare blanket or on a shitty motel bed, pressed together for warmth and comfort.
“Oh, you sweet summer child,” Tony whispered in his ear. “She’s already figured that out. She’s got me so wrapped around her little finger, I’m lucky I can do
He looked at Tony helplessly.  “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you.  I am.  If it had been anybody else, Tony,
Tony had been far from idle after he found out about Steve’s incarceration.  He’d kept up his work with the Avengers, but on the side, he’d worked on this too.
“Hello?” Tony said, and his voice was the same, amused, smooth like honey, silk in Steve’s ear. “Hello, hello, hello?” And then his laugh. Rich and sweet. “Okay. Doesn’t want to talk to me.”
Clint looked back steadily.  Understanding bloomed in Steve's heart.  He closed his eyes with the force of that understanding, and he loved Clint for it.  Might have
Steve finished off his whiskey and set the glass aside. It wasn’t his first of the night--or the fifth--but he barely felt any buzz at all. Thanks to Erskine, and Howard of course, it would probably take double the amount to make him feel anything. Usually that was a blessing, but on nights like tonight he would gladly trade a little “super-soldier” just to feel a bit tipsy.
Steve lifted his head fast, frowning at Tony in confusion. “Alone?” he asked, then smiled a little. “Stark Industries must be a helluva busy place, if they don’t even let your wife come home long enough to help with homework and bedtime.”
wanted it, but now, all these years later, part of him kind of wished he’d waited for something better to come along, and he was ecstatic that Steve had.  The idea was an old-fashioned one--like so many of Steve’s ideas--but maybe  that wasn’t such a bad thing.  Maybe waiting for a good person was an idea that should not have gone out of style in the first place.
“You’re cooking?” Steve asked. He was leaning against the doorway leading into the diner’s kitchen. He’d felt a little strange when he first told Tony about his job--it seemed a bit too close to what Howard had predicted for him as a teenager for comfort--but Tony had just told him that sounded great. That he loved diners. Loved diner-food. Loved any kind of food really. He needed food. He required it. Did this mean Steve would bring him food? He was very open to the idea of Steve being his personal food-cooker-slash-bringer.
And then when they got home, there’d be Morgan’s bedtime stuff--pajamas, teeth-brushing, a glass of water. Then another glass of water. Stories, and goodnight kisses. All that was good now.
After their bath, Tony took Steve into the bedroom. He laid him down on the bed and kissed and caressed every inch of his body until Steve was a melty puddle who could barely find enough strength within himself to turn on his side and lay his head on Tony’s stomach.
problem,” Sam shot back. Steve looked up from his book and met Sam’s eye, and then they were both laughing. That was the way it was between them. The way it had always been between them, and Steve loved that.
Steve was silent. Waiting. It felt like Nick was leaving something out of the explanation. He wasn’t sure what, but it was something. Something.
Tony jumped to his feet, tearing at his clothes, and fell into the shower.  He turned it on, already taking himself in hand.  The water spurted out of the shower head, so hot it was nearly scalding, turning his skin red.  Tony didn’t even notice.  Steam billowed around him while he pumped his cock mercilessly, hate-fucking his own fist with the sight of Steve’s blue eyes, dark with pent-up rage in his head.
“I told you I wouldn’t feel in control if my hands were completely covered.  The shield wouldn’t feel right.”
“I, uh, left my glasses in the house,” he muttered, and while his eyes might be a little less than perfect now, there was nothing wrong with his ears.  He heard Steve’s soft snort of laughter loud and clear.  He sunk his teeth into Steve’s shoulder.
Tony shook his head and sighed out a frustrated breath. He felt a little funny. Almost as if he had opened the door for--or worse, actively participated in--
“I did no such thing.  He’s an animal, Stark.  I don’t understand why none of you see that.  You, most of all.  He tried to kill you, and now I find you two here all cozied up together, playing house.  What is wrong with you?  Your father would be disgusted.”
Nat was here with him. There was that. She didn’t sit next to him--she knew he needed space sometimes. She knew because she was the same way--but when she passed him, she laid her hand on his shoulder for a moment. She didn’t say anything, but she didn’t have to. The touch itself was question enough--
She kissed the top of Nick’s head. “Steve likes kids,” she said in a voice that sounded idle, but wasn’t. “He’d like to have one someday.”
Steve nodded, but he didn’t feel better. Tony still looked sad. And Steve was starting to get desperate. He didn’t want to let Tony go home feeling bad. He didn’t have a mom anymore. Tony had told him that. Said she’d died a long time ago. Steve had lost his dad, but somehow, losing a mom seemed worse to him. Maybe just because he loved his own mom so much, and he couldn’t think of a worse thing than her dying too. She took care of him. When he was sick or feeling bad, she always took care of him. Tony didn’t have that. He didn’t talk about his father much, but Steve had seen him a couple of times--a tall guy with hard eyes and a sharp voice--and he could not imagine him sitting beside Tony’s bedside, holding his hand the way Steve’s mom did with
He smiled. It was dark, sad, nostalgic. It made Tony’s heart beat faster in spite of himself. In spite of the fact that he’d felt himself throwing up quick but impenetrable walls around his heart the second he saw Steve standing at the reception desk in the office. In spite of the way a litany of words was running through his head on a loop right this very moment. Words like
Jeff nodded and drank his beer.  He had a round, pleasant face.  He was a round, pleasant guy, and Steve could see why Tony had taken to him so well.  “Oh yeah.  He wanted to impress you, and it threw him off.  It happens.”
It was only when the bullet punched through his stomach that he realized that had been a grave mistake.
his face after he read it.  And that was in spite of his intense aversion to spitting.  Why couldn’t he leave them alone?  Ross had served his time, just the same as Steve had.  He wasn’t back in Washington yet, but he could go back any time he wanted.  True, Tony had heard his wife had taken a little sabbatical of her own.  Had moved to Iowa to be nearer to her family while Ross was in The Raft and hadn’t come back yet, even through Ross had been back for six months.  There were rumors of a divorce brewing in the Ross household.  Maybe Thaddeus had told her what he’d done.  He had to have told her something when he went to The Raft.  He couldn’t get away with the company line of bullshit when it came to his own wife.
The bed was empty when Steve woke.  He ran sleepy fingers where Nat’s body had been.  The sheets were cool to the touch, but when he pressed his face into her pillow, the ghost of her perfume remained.  She was gone, but she had left her magic behind: the bed still seemed normal-sized.  With any luck, it would stay that way for a while.
Afterward, Tony licked a little circle with the tip of his tongue.  “This is mine now, baby,” he said.  “Henceforth, nobody touches it but me, ‘kay?”
“Maybe,” Steve agreed, still speaking in that serene way that belied the way his guts were twisting. His heart was shredding. He had to do this. Howard had been right. If he didn’t do this now, he would just be being selfish. “But those other people-”
Steve grinned and stood back up. He held his hand out and Tony let him pull him to his feet. “Come on then, your highness. Let's go lay you down and see what I can do for you.”
He nodded, and followed Sam and Natasha out the front door. The booking officer gave him a little wave. "Good luck, kid," he said, and Tony couldn't help smiling a little at that.
And then they were wheeling her away, down the hallway, through doors that led to another hallway, that led to an operating room and a surgeon’s knife, and he knew nothing about what else waited for her down there. Or what was waiting for him. He sat down on a chair and put his head in his hands, trying to clear his mind. He couldn't quite do it, but he tried hard.
Tony was shaking his head, a stubborn, pained look printed on his features. “No,” he said. “No, baby, it wouldn’t be like that. I
“I’ll miss you too,” he said, trying to keep his own tears at bay. “But you’re gonna be going to your mom’s while I’m gone, and you’re going to be having so much fun you won’t even have time to miss me.”
hug. “You won’t hurt her,” Tony said into his shoulder. “Christ, Steve, you won’t hurt her. I know you won’t. You won’t hurt her, you won’t hurt
Tony laughed again. It was soft, and low, and fond. Steve had never heard anything so nice in his entire life. “I’m sorry I didn’t show today,” Tony said. “I’m so sorry.”
Steve shrugged, a little self-consciously. “I don’t know,” he muttered. “I guess I’m just starting to think about...my future, or whatever.” He laughed bitterly under his breath. “
“I don’t have to,” Steve said. “‘Cause we’re done, right? I mean, even if I hadn’t joined, we would still be done.”
“‘Kay.”  He curled his hand into Tony’s shirt.  Maybe that was silly, but it was a comfort to him.  Like a security blanket.  He wondered sometimes if maybe he and Tony were a little co-dependent.  If it was a little weird how much they seemed to need each other around.  How much they touched and kissed and thought about each other.  But then Tony would look at him and smile and then he wouldn’t wonder again for awhile.  He'd just enjoy being with him.  And besides, what was wrong with a little dependency?  “Goodnight, Tony.  I love you.”
Steve shook his head.  “I don’t know.  Nothing, I guess.  It’s not an excuse.  I’m not excusing what I did, I’m just telling you what happened.”
They sat in silence for a while.  It had been fifteen minutes forty-five minutes ago, Tony was sure.  Not that he was complaining.  Not with Steve’s heart thumping serenely in his ear, and Steve’s thumb caressing his side, and Steve’s breath in his hair.
Steve pressed his fingers into Tony’s hip, squeezing him gently but firmly. “Put Morgan to bed,” he whispered, and his voice was filled with a dark heat.
Steve took in a deep breath and sighed it out. Tony was nibbling his ear and kissing the sensitive place right beneath it, but when Steve didn’t say anything, he made a soft, inquisitive sound to prompt him.
Steve came for him again, but Tony was ready this time.  As Steve moved toward him, Tony struck out with his foot, pistoning from the hip, and drove it into Steve’s bad left leg.  A flare of sorrow shot through him--
He shuddered atop him, saying his name over and over and over again while Tony lay breathless beneath him.  Tony wanted to pull him close, but he had no strength left in his arms.  He was weak as a kitten, high on endorphins and the nearness of his best guy who would never hurt him, never lie to him, never make him wait.  The potency of that hit him, and he breathed deeply, waiting for his heart to slow down or simply explode in his chest.
possibly deserve to wake up to Tony lying on his chest, touching him in the morning sunshine? “Didn’t mean to wake you up.”
“Yeah,” Steve sighed. “Me too.” He pressed his mouth against Tony’s shoulder again, and kept it there without moving, just holding him, then, after a while, “Do you ever...think about that?” he asked in a halting way. “What it would have been like? If...we’d...made it work?”
He went out to the garage for a little while.  He’d bought a couple vintage cars to work on, but he didn’t really do anything on them.  He mostly just moved things from one place to another, then gave up and left again.  When he got into the house, he could hear the shower running.  He picked up a little, folding then re-folding their blankets and tossing them onto the couch.  Steve had continued sleeping out here and Tony had insisted on doing the same.  The big bed in the next room had yet to be slept in, had yet to be even laid upon, although Tony did sit on it sometimes in the mornings to put his shoes on.
He held back a little. He didn’t want Steve to come from just this. He was positive that Steve could go more than one round in a night, but he wanted the first one to count. He wanted it to be something that Steve would remember for the rest of his life. Even if tonight amounted to no more than just one time, he wanted to make sure that one time was good. As good as he could possibly make it. For Steve, and for himself.
Tony blinked in surprise.  He moved his thumb over Steve’s thigh, soothing him.  “Baby,” he said calmly, “it’s okay.  We’ve got this figured out.  She can do it.  She can take care of you.  And then you can come home.”
pleasure. Especially with Steve. Especially since he had never had anyone interested in giving to him before. It still boggled Tony’s mind. That anyone---
Steve hugged him tight then let him go. Tony expected to see a smile, but he was frowning instead. “Steve?”
“No,” Peterson said, looking relieved by Tony’s calm demeanor. “Just a little engine trouble, but the pilot was able to put it down safely. No one even got jostled much.”
The tension remained in Tony’s body for a moment longer, and then he eased. Steve felt him nod against his back. “Okay,” he said. “Later.”
Steve leaned close enough to press his lips against Tony’s. He’d meant to only do it once, but it turned into a few more. “Yeah,” he said, then smiled, resting his chin on Tony’s chest again. He stayed within easy kissing-distance, though. His tactical brain had calculated that distance in .5 seconds, and he used it to its full advantage. “It’s just nice hearing you are too.”
Steve laid his head on Tony’s shoulder and held onto his waist. “I guess. Still sucks, though,” he said into Tony’s neck. “I was looking forward to tonight.”
late, and it didn’t seem like he was the only one either. He listened to a few of the other soldiers talking to their own families and his heart sank a little lower with each one. When the last one, a big guy with a hard face, broke down in tears while speaking to his son, Steve stopped listening. He walked away, lighting another cigarette--his fifth of the afternoon--and thought about what he’d told Tony the night before he left.
Howard cleared his throat. It was obvious that he hadn’t thought it would be Steve opening the door for him either. He seemed just as surprised--and worried--as Steve did. “Hello, Steven,” he said, and his voice wasn’t quite as steady as it usually was. “How are you?”
“She fell down last week,” Tony said weakly. They were standing side-by-side, Tony still facing the counter, Steve away from it, their bodies overlapping just the smallest bit. Steve moved the hand that had snuck around Tony’s waist and let his thumb begin to caress him. He kept it over his shirt. Even though he desperately wanted to touch his skin, he kept it over his shirt. This wasn’t about romance. It was about comfort.
.  And his stomach hurt.  Steve looked back down at his paper.  The words swam before his eyes. He blinked and rubbed them.
Steve went to the window and looked out.  All of New York City lay at his feet.  When he was a kid, he’d never been this high up.  He’d been on the streets, in the alleys, down in the thick of it all.  He barely even saw the tall buildings and never thought about going up into one of them.  Standing here now, it felt different.  There was a beauty he hadn’t seen before, back when he was on the ground.  Maybe nothing was as beautiful when your feet were on the ground.  Or maybe now he just had more to lose.
Steve laughed quietly. “Both, I guess,” he said, and tipped his head to kiss him again. Just a short kiss. A soft one. “And for helping me. I really wouldn’t have gotten that grade without you. It’s all ‘cause of you. I’m serious.”
Steve returned his kiss, then pulled Tony against his chest, wrapping his arms around him and put his face in his neck.  He held him, just breathing him in, just being with him.  Steve still couldn’t believe that this was his life now.  He couldn’t believe that he was allowed to just
Tony kissed him soundly. “‘Kay, first off, don’t ever apologize, okay? Ever. Not for this. Not for anything to do with this. And second, I don’t care about the furniture. And third,” he wet his lips. His hand was still in Steve’s hair, still testing its texture with his fingers, still loving its silky smoothness. And now he was nervous. Afraid, almost, because third...third… “What if it wasn’t
Instead of getting irritated by that phrase--he had come to personally detest it, especially when it came out of Steve’s mouth--Tony let it go.  He understood it this time.  He had, in fact, had a  very long, very intense conversation with Nat, Bruce, and Sam about that very thing.  They all agreed not to talk about it.  Not to mention the last time they’d come up, not to push Steve into discussing, remembering, or even thinking about it if he didn’t want to.  Tony didn’t know if that was healthy or not.  He didn’t give a shit if it was healthy or not.  He just wanted his guy to have a nice weekend.
Tony reached down and picked Steve’s hand up from where it lay on the bed. “Mmm,” he hummed, looking at it. “This looks good on you.”
“It’s for you,” Tony said, and his voice and the ring were suddenly the only things in Steve’s world. “‘Cause I love you. ‘Cause I want you to marry me.”
They stood up together and before she could leave, Steve cupped the back of her head and kissed her mouth.  It was brief and soft and weighed his heart with loss, but he had to do it.  She returned his kiss.  Her lips tasted of good-bye.
Steve slid his arms around Tony’s waist.  “Come on,” he said, nuzzling the base of Tony’s throat.  “It was a little funny.”
Tony sighed harshly, squeezed him again, then let him go. “Okay,” he said briskly. “Okay. Go to work. You’re going to be late.”
ridiculous?  Perhaps the news about Steve was too much, but what about just calling her?  Just talking to her?  He missed her, missed her poised, polished, steady presence.  Would it be cruel to call her after leaving her to be with Steve?  He didn’t want to be cruel, but…
Steve avoided him the rest of the time they were at Jen's.  At the door, Jen gave Steve a long, tight hug, then turned him aside where Bobby did the same, clinging to him like a koala, then stepped back finally to let Jasmine kiss his cheek and tell him thank you for helping.  She gave him another loaf of banana bread, and Steve thanked her.
it.  But look at me.  Even after the serum’s done its job, I’ll never have the mobility I had before.  Shuri and Doctor Strange were very kind but very honest.”  He blinked, but the tears still formed.  They shone like diamonds in the moon’s soft glow.  “It’s over.”
Nat and Bruce were the most frequent.  They lived in the city, and it was easiest for them.  Peter lived here too, but he didn’t come much anymore.  Tony had put a restriction on his access during one of his more lucid moments.  The kid did
; Tony didn’t even pretend to reach for the check--paid and they left.  She laid down a fifty for the tip, hoping that would soothe at least some of the hurt feelings.
was doing when Steve wasn’t there.  Even in the midst of a coffee-and-science binge, part of him was waiting for Steve to come get him and pull him out of it.  Sure, he had a lot of work to do, and he was pissed when Steve
but not real, regular glasses like these. His brain tried to tell him how much he liked it, but Steve shut it up quickly, shoving it away into a metaphorical room in the back of his head filled with files it could look at and go through instead of thinking of Tony and his glasses--
Ps...theres a note that keeps showing up after this one.  It's from about chapter 2, but I can't seem to get rid of it. Just ignore it for now. I've tried figuring it out, but I am not the sharpest kid sometimes and can't do it. Sorry!
“Steve,” he said, his voice on edge.  “I’m here.  Okay?  It’s me.  I need you to look me in the eye and know that it’s me.”
Tony laughed again.  Tears were in his eyes, but these were good ones.  These ones he could handle.  “Can I be there, do you think?  When he tries to walk the first time?”  He put his head in his hand, grinning and weeping in the Tower kitchen.  “I’d love to see that.  I’d love to see
He laughed again and hugged her. Christ, she was too much like him for comfort. He loved it. “What do you say we go for a walk, huh?”
Tony shrugged.  He was standing against the counter, bare feet crossed at the ankle, wearing sweats and a black tank top.  His hair was clean and smooth.  He’d put on a little weight since he’d come back.  He looked almost the same as he had before the snap.  Before Siberia.  He was eating a bowl of cereal, and it was all so familiar, so Tony, it was infuriating.
For two years, Tony had not been the one sharing his bed and sharing his life.  It had been Natasha, Sam, and Wanda who had been there for that.  Nat, Sam, and Wanda who had been with him, ate dinner with him, talked to him, laughed with him, bandaged his wounds after combat, helped him with his uniform when he was too sore to do it alone.
“Okay,” Tony said, unfolding the paper. “But this had better be some Shakespeare-level romance, Steve, or I’m going to-”
The stars were shining down, bright in the darkness.  Tony had been afraid when they moved out here, that he wouldn’t be able to be out here alone after dark.  Not after Titan.  Not with all those stars.  But, actually, he found it quite peaceful.
“Ten years, Pietro,” Steve said. And his hands were clenched tight then too. Tight, tight, tight. “That has been my life for ten years. Do you want me to just throw that away? Is that what you want?”
Steve slipped his hand into Tony’s, smiling when it closed easily over his. “Just on the beach though, ‘kay?” he said. “I didn’t bring any spray paint.”
Steve coughed, his eyes going wide.  Tony didn’t notice.  He was pulling on his scuffed leather jacket, checking his pockets for sunglasses and credit cards.
“Then I accept your terms.” He looked back down at his paper, his eyes moving across it as he read. “Tony.”
Tony straddled Steve’s hips, one hand still covering his mouth, the other holding his arm down. “Be on my side, Captain,” he said--and it wasn’t his fault if it came out low and sultry--“and I’ll make all your dreams come true.”
Rhodey’s face twisted in sad disgust.  “Go on.  Get inside.  You look like shit, and you smell worse.  Thank god the paparazzi’s finally given up on you.”
There was no door at the top of the stairs, no walls, just a railing made up of a log as a crossbeam and clear-varnished pine branches as spindles.  They’d kept it that way even after Steve moved up there.  Privacy?  What did he need privacy for?  Steve Rogers was an open book.  Tony heard him moving up there, the rustle of his clothing, the squeak of the mattress as he sat down on it.
Tony held his hands up.  “You know, I really don’t think I want to hear about what you were doing.  Just do it somewhere else, huh?  For the sake of everyone?  We eat in here.”
But right now, he was sipping his water, thinking about how good it tasted, how cool it was going down his throat. How soothing after the fight this afternoon. How much he was enjoying it. How nice it was that Steve had gotten it for him. How nice Steve was in general. How nice it was that they were friends. How nice Steve looked tonight with the sun glinting on his hair, turning the blond into gold. How nice it was when he threw his head back and laughed like he was doing now at something Natasha had said. How much he wished it was something that
He went to the side of the bed and sat down. Tony’s lashes lay smoothly against cheeks that were flushed pink with sleep. His lips parted slightly. Curled up, his dark hair such a contrast to the white sheets surrounding him, Steve thought he had never in his entire life seen anything more perfect, and his adoration for him pounded through his veins, making him weak.
Tony kissed him fervently back, eyes closed, hands in his hair, tongue deep in his mouth.  He wished fleetingly, cruelly, that Steve was not stuck in this chair.  He hated himself for it, but couldn’t help it, couldn’t help the desire to have Steve’s strong thigh thrust between his own, supporting him while he ground against it.
The meeting broke up after that, but Steve hardly noticed.  He reached into his pocket and took out his compass.  Peggy looked up at him from inside.  He ran his thumb tenderly along the curve of her face.  He wished to god she was here now.
Tony went to the door, only spilling a drop or two on the floor as he lurched.  He felt like a sailor on shore for the first time in months.  He missed the knob twice, then found it and turned it.
“Hey,” Tony said, and he moved closer, grasping Steve’s wrist lightly.  “Hey, come on, don’t do that.  It’s okay.  It’s not your fault.”
out of him.  Tony was fading.  He could feel it, the strength leaving his body.  Weakly, his hand scrabbled on the wooden floor and closed over something heavy.  He brought it around, using every ounce of muscle he had left, and brought the flashlight down against Steve’s temple.
Steve climbed into bed and laid down next to him again. He kissed his shoulder. His neck. Then lay back on the pillow. “I’m glad you came here tonight.”
“Seriously?” Steve asked, and Tony could not even begin to decipher the look on his face or tone of his voice.
Ross glanced at the other two men just as Steve had done.  The sick twist of his lips said he had come to the same conclusion.
Now, a tiny flare of jealousy flashed through Tony’s heart.  He stomped it out quickly, but a spark remained, especially when Steve caught Sam’s eye and beckoned him forward.  Sam went, his own eyes tearful, and dropped to one knee beside the chair.  Steve loosed one arm from Nat’s waist and pulled Sam to him, clutching him close.
“Don’t sell yourself short, soldier,” Tony said, starting the engine.  “Ninety percent of the people in this city would probably die to nail you.”
--distilling down to only the feeling of Tony. Just Tony. Him and nothing else. He breathed, and when he came, his breath stopped. And it wasn’t like an explosion. It was like a revelation.
Steve tilted Tony’s face up to his so he could look him in the eye.  Icy blues met warm, liquid brown.  “I love you,” he said. “I love you so much I can’t breathe, I can’t move, I can’t--god, I can’t do anything.”  He shook his head helplessly.  “You’re all I think about.  You’re everything I ever...You’re everything, Tony.  You’re just--you’re everything.”
“You’re right,” Tony said.  He brushed his fingers through the beard that covered Steve’s cheek.  “We don’t joke about that stuff anymore, do we?”
“Good,” he said, and kissed him again, their mouths moving in perfect tandem, both giving and taking, using and being used. Steve held him tightly, pinning him between the sink and his own body. Tony could feel the counter digging into his back, but he didn’t care. He liked it. Liked that little bit of pain. Especially if it meant Steve was pressing so tightly against him, so tightly he could feel the hardness growing between them.
Tony could see his sanity flitting around in the metaphorical rafters, and he made a grab for it. He caught it too. Just barely. Just by the tail. But he held onto it with a vicious strength. “Have, um,” he began, then cleared his throat and started again. “Have you done this before?”
Josh tightened his grip on Tony. He was holding him in a death-clutch now, but Steve still didn’t mind. His brain was ticking away, showing him how pale Josh was, how hostile his eyes were. Josh was angry. Josh was jealous. Josh was trying to
