'It's ridiculous in this day and age to suggest a woman's behaviour is due to her decision whether or not to have a child,' Doctor Laura Atkins tells us. 'It's the sort of attitude we'd expect a man of the Captain's era to have- and that I'm fairly convinced he does.'
Tony,
Sorry, but no can do on the friends front. This place is enough of a target as it is, being Avengers HQ and all, without letting people know we actually stay here long-term or telling people ‘what it is like inside the tower’. All of us maintain other addresses and we tend to flit in and out a bit. I’m sure your friends are great, but they don’t exactly have security clearance. I can offer you a beach house party or something?
And Steve would be fine without a war, as long as there was still people to save from burning buildings or whatever.
You are really paranoid do you know that? If Loki was planning anything else he would have done it at the the Prom. And Mr Osbourne? He wants to ruin your reputation right? I'm not sure how attacking me would accomplish that. Anyway he probably figures I'm still at the Prom along with his Son, so I doubt he is about to make a move that would endanger Harry as well.
NATASHA: Shh, shh. I know it hurts, baby.
We’re on our way back now. As far as we can tell, Hydra is gone, and we have Loki’s pixie stick. You know, the one your little psychopathic best buddy used to MIND CONTROL people. As if we haven’t had enough of that lately. Anyway, I’m gonna run some tests with Bruce, see what we can find out.
I'm sorry about ruining the surprise. Will it keep until I get home? I will be back eventually, I promise. Miss you.
I'm not sure Spiderman would listen to me, I mean I just take his picture, it isn't like we are friends or anything.
Of course, that doesn’t exactly go with the Captain America brand and he’s not a fan of modern media invasion, so we’re keeping it private for now. That cool with you?
You’re the kind of person that invites strangers into your home for a glass of water, aren’t you? Listen, I’m sure Spiderman is a stand-up guy that is hero-ing for all the right reasons, but until we know for sure don’t rely on him. I tried talking to him again yesterday, but he ran off and disappeared. Seems kind of suspicious that he’d try to hide if he isn’t doing anything wrong.
As to the other things, I think it's pointless us arguing over it anymore when we obviously aren't going to agree. You do what you feel you need to, and I'll do the same.
Penny,
Natasha. xxxx
If Loki kills you its sorta your own fault
P.S. I may not be a dad but hey, if you ever need money/favours hit me up. I have assets coming out of my ass :P
OH I'LL LET THEM KNOW MY F%^&ING COMMENTS!!!!!!
Am I a monster now?
Also, you have a lot to learn about burgers.
It measures your vitals and if they are at dangerous levels it’ll activate. You can also do it manually by saying ‘Tango Sierra’. It sends a signal to the nearest hero with an Avengers ID and/or any cops that are around.
I won’t die if you don’t.
We can keep it a secret if you want, but you are banking on the press not finding out on their own. They'll be watching us like hawks till this is done, trying to sniff out any scent of scandal. It probably won't be long before someone finds out about the name change.
P.P.P.P.S. Fort Awesome is on my land, that makes it my property.
As for Bruce, yes he is amazing. Send him fanmail. Send him lots of fanmail. The guy needs a serious ego boost. For someone who can turn into a huge green slamming machine he doesn’t have much confidence. He’s also a vegetarian, because he’s super touchy feely like that. He once got mad at me for borrowing his Bunsen burner to fry bacon, seriously.
Cap thinks Spiderman's a Girl? Really? It doesn't seem that way to me. I mean I guess his voice is a little high but there doesn't really seem to be enough in the chest area for it to be a girl. Maybe his voice just hasn't broken or something yet?
See you tomorrow.
Penny
Jarvis is as interested in your health as I am. He won't be that easy to persuade. Anyway, give him some credit, he isn't going to do it while you're in mid-air or something.
Look it is just for now, to let people know we are serious with this act! We'll start the ball rolling with trials soon enough, and I'm sure they'll let most people go as long as they agree to register or stop super-heroing.
Apologies for another late update. Starting tomorrow, I'm going to do my best to keep to a Sat-Tues-Thurs schedule. Happy new year everyone!
Penny.
I saw the news about you turning yourself in.
Penny.
So, guess who showed up here looking for you? Well, amongst the dozens of others who didn't know you've left the state? Your little friend Eugene, aka 'Flash'. Turns out he's a big Spidey fan and seems to think that makes up for all the crap he pulled. He's not the brightest bulb in the box, is he? I asked him how many minutes he had left to save the world and he didn't get it AT ALL. What do they teach in schools these days?
The kidnapper contacted me. She sent a letter to Sam's, he read it to me over the phone. I haven't actually seen it, I can't risk meeting him in person right now. He's bringing it over to the mansion. Scan it, analyse it, tell me where it came from. Tell me where James is.
I think when he turned into Cap it was an illusion, but when he is Lucy he actually physically changes into a female....maybe? I don't know, I'll have to ask him when we go on our date :P
Penny,
I've honestly never thought about myself being a Mother...and if you aren't here i'm not sure I can do it. Steve I can barely look after myself! What if I lose it because I'm working too much, or not eating enough. And what about drinking!? I'm basically an alcoholic, how am I going to last nine months without you knocking the bottle out of my hand!?
Penny
Dear Penelope,
The only reason I’m not home right now is because Cap is being an asshole and saying we have to take out this one last base first. And don’t think I don’t know you’re deliberately avoiding my calls! You think you can just casually drop in ‘Oh, Loki showed up and he knows I’m Spiderman lol’?! I knew he was up to something! The second Thor takes his eyes off him he slithers back. Do you know where Loki is now? Does he know where you are?
Dear Penelope,
Tony,
Well I think that went well, didn't you? The crowd totally loved me, but then who doesn't ;P
Tony,
Guilty
I didn't tell you about Spiderman because I wasn't really sure if he would go through with it until the day. We've been talking on and off the past week or so. Turn out he is one of my young interns, who knew?
(Also he was not born on 4th July. That was a lie made up by the USO tours as part of the Captain America brand. His birthday is in, like, November. I was crushed.)
Of course.

Oh yeah, Peter woke up and we're on a greyhound bus back towards the border. I admit I haven't quite worked out how we're going to get past border control without passports, but if you got us in we should be able to get out. Besides, no-one is going to look too close at a guy in a wheelchair, right?
The Make-a-Wish Foundation
Dear Steve,
Oh I sort of assumed you knew all the other heroes. He isn't in the Avengers or anything, but he has been taking down muggers and stuff in New York. He seems pretty cool. The Daily Bugle hates him though.
Sooo anyway, Steve is really competitive huh? I guess that is what makes him a good Avengers. He didn't try to trick me while we were playing, but he did nudge me off the sofa a few times when I was about to win. He said It was accident, but now i'm not so sure.
Second, if you just want to hand the guy over to the police, why not let us help? The more people that are looking, the easier it will be, right?
Dear Dr Atkins,
There isn't much about me to tell really. I'm pretty good at science, but i'm not really your level. I mean I've won the science fair a few times, but that is only at Midtown High, it isn't exactly a  level of competition.
As for Steve, he turns down interviews that are about him. He’ll do appearances if it’s for a good cause. He was the key speaker for a gala dinner for veterans last month, and I’ll be honest, he did a good job. He had them eating out of the palm of his hand. Only thing is, I caught him in the bathroom five minutes later and he was shaking like a leaf. He’s a pretty shy guy when you get down to it. He always says Cap is the symbol and all, and he has to live up to that. I guess if he had a secret identity it would take off some of the pressure he likes to put on himself.
Things we disagree on:
We are learning from our mistakes! That's why things are changing! You are the one stuck in the past...
It isn't his dick! I don't know what it is. He was about to give it to me when Ultron attacked, but he hasn't mentioned it since.
Natasha,
I told you May was stressing out! I told you telling her about Loki would only make it worse!
Natasha.
What happened with Loki?
Steve,
Tony,
Natasha.
Please come home.
You're having a baby?
It wasn't Loki's fault I was kidnapped, it was mine! I let Harry into the Tower and I took him down to the cells! All Loki did was give us a bit of space, and then do his best to save me! He was misguided but at least he tried...
Loki has been a perfect gentleman, so you can stop worrying. I know you weren't that keen on leaving him with me after the party, but he told me Thor had words with him about being on his best behaviour or Mew-near? (Seriously how the hell do you spell the hammer's name?) wouldn't be happy.
Tony,
I don't know what I'll spend the money you gave me on...I've never really had money before. I guess I could do with a new camera, but that's about it.
Look he is just in my class, it isn't like I have to talk to him. There are load of kids I don't talk to. Honestly I'm not all that popular, Loki will probably just ignore me like everyone else. Plus, he is sort of hot now, so I imagine Liz Allen or one of the other cheerleaders will get their claws into him and then he'll have to give me a wide berth. So it is fine, I don't have to transfer.
Natasha,
I've drunk a little before, but I don't really see the appeal. Alcohol just tastes kind of gross to me...
You're right about the PR though. Look, next time one of my guys calls for back-up I'll let you know. We can have a team up, right? Show we're all on the side of good, even if we disagree about exactly what form it should take. Just like you and me. Maybe they'll even believe I haven't left you then.
I don’t have a Cap voice. I am Cap, it’s my voice.
Osbourne
They were just doing their jobs! They were doing what we are
Natasha,
Anyway, Steve is going to sweet talk May, so get used to the idea of a robot/magic roomie.
Maybe we could do something small for my Birthday closer to the time, like go get dinner or something.
Fine, ask Harry about his dad’s super secret cabinet. I bet you he’s never seen inside it. Second, if this Eugene is that bad, if Harry was actually your friend he wouldn’t invite him to the parties. I told you, he’s probably just like his father. An Osbourne is an Osbourne is an Osbourne, and slime is hereditary.
P.S Oh right, I got a picture of Spiderman and Cap the other day. Did he say anything?
P.S Well now he knows that Spiderman isn't a terminally ill, maybe he'll leave her be and you guys can get back to your Disney movies.
Dear Mr Stark,
Natasha.
P.S I'm not sure what kind of business rivalry you have with his Dad, but Harry is my friend and I trust him.
P.S. It occurs to me now that Cap may have put two and two together. You’d be worried too if you thought a terminal cancer kid was out playing superhero, right?
Natasaha
Okay, scan is done, so I’m going back to the lab. Do you mind swinging by sometime for a few more tests? We met some enhanced humans out in Europe-probably and it’s a bit too similar to what Osbourne was up to for my liking.
H. Corbett
I text Sam to ask him to book us in with the marriage counsellor. I wonder if we'll be the first case where neither of the people really think seeing a counsellor is a good idea? But we have to do something. I guess even if we go to one session and it does no good and we hate it, at least we'll both have taken steps to try and put things right. I mean, let's be honest, we haven't done great trying to fix this ourselves. Even since we got James back and you got me out, all we've really done is fight. I mean, I'm sitting in here and you're sitting in there and we're e-mailing each other because we can't trust ourselves to talk without yelling. Maybe we do need help from someone.
I'm up! I'm up! Where are you?! Where is my son?! Who the £%£& is SIN?!
I couldn't force Harry to stay in Asgard, it wouldn't have been right, and you can't keep him prison either.
Sin is also your therapist, but I guess you got that. What is this century's obsession with spilling all their personal business to strangers?! You could have talked to me.

It's been too long. They must have a plan beyond just taking him, what they were going to do once they had him, and they must be onto that step by now. It doesn't bear thinking about.
Stealth mission it is then. I'll book us a room under a fake name, you just concentrate on getting there tomorrow night ;)
I love you.
We’ll get Loki either way. I don’t mind if it takes a bit longer if it means we can keep you safe. Look, I haven’t been a dad to you and I’m not asking to be, but I at least have to make sure you’re okay.
Orders from the top-
You can't just send your lawyers away! I didn't send them to get you off on a technicality, I sent them to make sure you aren't given a harsher punishment just so they could make an example of you! I'm sending them back.
Penny.
You know all the guys think you are awesome right? You just aren't as popular with the girls because well...you are literally old enough to be their fathers. :P
I prefer to mask my lack of confidence behind jokes and witty comebacks. The only reason I talk so much when I'm fighting is because I'm terrified.
Maybe you should just quit wanting to yell at me when it is past 1am on a school night!
Tony,
Speaking of talking too much. Prom was...eventful. Mainly because Loki showed up and spiked the Punch with some sort of truth potion. So yeah he knows I'm Spiderman now, and basically everyone in the school is mad at someone else because they said something they should have been keeping a secret.
But...I think maybe the mask guy might have worked out who I am too. I mean I kicked him really hard, what other explanation could there be for that? I don't know...maybe he'll just think i'm a mutant or something.
Since the introduction of the SHRA, there has been no shortage of criticism. Even following the arrest of Steve Stark, the most prolific and vocal opponent of the act, the voice of disagreement has not been quieted. Many famous heroes continue to operate in secret, evading the forces of law and order that aim to bring them to justice. This is even true of those already convicted for non-registration, many of whom are suspected of having given false information to the registry in order to be released from their initial life-sentence jail terms. Most then go on to return to their life of vigilantism with re-offence rates estimated at 87% for super-humans convicted of non-registration.
I won't let the clone back out there. I don't even want to look at that thing! But I won't destroy it...i can't...
I guess you really don't open any of your own mail. I mentioned it in the first letter, my Mom died when I was a kid, my Step Dad too.  There was a plane crash when I was Seven. My parents left me with my Aunt and Uncle and just...never came back. I've lived with my Aunt May and Uncle Ben since then...but it is just me and Aunt May now. Uncle Ben was murdered about a year ago...
Did you have to show up in the suit?! I told you Mary Jane lived near by, she saw you! Now she is asking questions and after the Loki thing...I'm not sure how much longer you being my Dad is going to remain a secret.
Natasha,
P.S. Sending someone over to fit you up with solar panels and a Stark generator. Bye bye bills :)

It has to do with me because the press will make everything to do with me, and they will inevitably be outside your prom to analyse your dress, your car, your date, etc. etc. And if you don’t go, they’ll say it was because of me and all the trauma of finding out I’m your father, blah blah blah. (Also, I just realised we haven’t done a Star Wars spoof yet. I’m disappointed in us. We could make a Vine. Let’s make a Vine.)
Sam got out I think. Can't find Peter. Can't really move, or shout, but can't see him in phone light.
What? It’s on? Oh, uh, okay. So Tony’s asked me to record a special message and, uh, here it is. [pause] Hey Hitle- wait, is this a message to Hitler?

Time to bring in Norman Osbourne. (Pro tip for if you ever decide to aid a fascist science organisation with very-illegal human modification experiments- Don’t slap your damn logo on everything.) Throw him in the holding cell in the tower and
But never mind that. What is this Lucy like? I hope she isn't a bad influence, Penelope! At least not worse than me....
P.P.S When do you finish for the summer anyway? I’m getting further with Ultron but I could kind of use an intern. You can still work on the body heat generators in you want, but if you’re going to be free soon I thought I’d give you first dibs.
P.S That is a pretty rude joke for you Steve Stark, I approve ;P
A big thank you to everyone who has commented. I will try to reply to you at some point over the next few days, when I will not be working overtime! :)
Will you send me a picture? I want to see the bump.
An early update today because Blackthorn and I are about to go away for a hen weekend. But you know, you have to make sure you update before you go XD
Steve,
...No, only kidding. But from the next chapter we will be jumping forward in time by several months, but more on that next time. Merry Christmas everyone!
Steve,
P.S. We aren't kicking Steve out the suite are we? I don't want to take his bed if he needs it...
There’s a reason I didn’t want Harry to know about us. You know that means his dad knows, right? Which means this will hit the papers sooner or later, and the fact it hasn’t yet means Osbourne is up to something. Which is probably also why he’s disappeared. So yeah, better invest in some sun glasses and a hoodie, kid, there’s a media storm blowing in.
(Actually I threw it out because it is gross, but it would really help me out if you pretended you ate it. Thanks.)
Cap is on Wanda duty. Funnily enough, she’s still not keen on me; and if Cho can’t get Speedy Gonzales back from the edge it’s probably only going to get worse. Besides which, Cap’s got that whole human-experiment deal to bond over with them.
Steve.
Think you can stop me? Then come find me.
I've been visiting May at least. She's doing okay.
Tony,
Steve xxxx
That guy deserved it! There were kids in that Bank he was trying to hold hostage! Okay maybe I was a little hard on him, but maybe a couple broken ribs will teach him a lesson! Anyway the car I threw him into came off much worse, you might need to pay for that.
About Loki- don’t worry, we’re dealing with it. Just tell us if you see him, okay?
They're high schoolers. Public high schoolers at that. If there's one thing we can guess pretty safely, it's that they will totally care you are Spiderman. Sorry to burst your bubble.
Did you think about names yet?
I will continue my research into Dr Atkins and let you know if I discover anything of use.
I hope he is okay...I wonder why no has heard from him. Maybe I should talk to Thor.
I don't know anything about the cabinet, it just looked like a weird black metal cupboard with a lock and some black out glass. I only even looked at it because Flash and his neanderthal friends were trying to crack it open. Harry probably let them try so they wouldn't think to go searching for a wine cellar.
Things we agree on:
Natasha xxx
You know he bought his Aunt too right? I think maybe the press have been giving her a little trouble, showing up at all hours. Peter seems to think she'll be able to get some rest here, since the security is much stricter.
I saw the papers, I had to come...he's so small. Is he okay?
I've spoken to the lawyers. They think because of James being kidnapped, they can get you off for breaking out.
P.S What did he say? He is probably just trying to antagonise you.

STARK: Yes.
"Boss, I think you're havin' a panic attack," Friday says. "Can you focus on your breathing? Count with me—"
Under the faceplate, Tony opens his eyes. The most sophisticated heads-up display in the world greets him. Beyond the smart overlay and through the lenses he sees himself—taller and stronger, gleaming and invincible. Iron Man doesn't have bags under his eyes. Iron Man's eyes have been replaced with something better.
"How do you know?"
Lila brightens. She's a thing to behold, making connections at speeds that must leave her classmates in the dust; Tony wonders if she's noticed how lonely it is at the front of the pack. "Yeah? What kind of interests?"
Only one copy of the footage exists. In it, Tony enters the room, sits down, takes off his helmet, and cradles it in his hands. He spends twenty-seven minutes staring into the blank eyes of the Iron Man. He spends the minute after that sniveling, and the minute after that standing. Once upright, he leans over the body on the table and tells it one thing before replacing his helmet and exiting. The whole affair takes slightly less than half an hour. Friday has the only recording.
BOWMAN: [
"Tony—"
"What about her?" Tony plays dumb. Whatever happened to Hill happened recently enough that Dugan just got wind of it.
Critically acclaimed documentary maker Jackson Norriss was found dead in his cabin retreat early Monday morning.
Meanwhile, Iron Man. Tony Stark exists at the other end of the spectrum. In the years since the public revelation of Iron Man's identity, Stark Industries has stuck to the story that Tony Stark is no more than a man in a can, but rumors of self-modification have plagued Stark since the beginning of his career. Those rumors were confirmed recently when news outlets obtained partial medical records from Stark's recent hospital stay (for, of course, undisclosed reasons) and connected them to a talk he gave a few months prior on what he called the Extremis enhancile. Even discounting the shortcut of the armor, Stark is no longer human—if he ever was in the first place.

BIRCH: What about you, Steve?
"Sir." There's a fraction of a second of hesitation during which Tony can imagine Gomez gathering his nerve, and then the guy says, "Anything I can help with?"
STARK: It's a chronic condition. You don't cure it, you learn to manage it.
"Sir," Agent Gomez had asked, "is this okay?" And Tony, as reassuring as he could possibly be from the cold remove of the ice beneath which he shook, had said yes.
"Maybe that's the problem," Steve says. "You think too much."
"What do they want?" He's already looking for an access point into the helicarrier's computer node.
"And what about the political side?" Hill asks. "The public's still divided. If the Act gets repealed as quickly as it passed, we'll be dead in the water."
be too emotionally compromised to effectively dispatch his duties. There is only one positive indication of this assessment (noted in our prior communication, although again I must stress that this is observational only and that nobody has eyes on the Director of SHIELD at all times), but there are a number of negative indications that may offer additional evidence. This is another conversation better had in person.
says Hill.
"Contact Director Hill," Iron Man tells him. "I have some new information that might interest her. And follow up with Colonel Layton about that joint training exercise." Alpha Team in particular still needs work; they've having trouble integrating Iron Man into their tactics. Danvers' strike force, on the other hand, is currently their most valuable asset by an order of magnitude—
"This is because of Extremis?"
It shatters. Steve twists to the side. Tony deploys a localized flood of dry water that smothers the flames on the worker's leg, scoops the man up in an improvised hold that causes him to scream in animal pain, and heads for higher ground. Before he punches through the roof, he makes the mistake of looking down. Cap's lips are pulled back from his teeth.

That's the realization in Boynton's eyes: that he is powerful but not unassailably powerful, that he can't cheat his way out of everything. Tony has been in rooms with mirrors before. He knows that cast of features.

"I wouldn't do that."
Tony Stark, CEO of Stark Industries and co-chair of the Avengers, shocked America on Thursday morning when he came out in favor of the proposed Superhhuman Registration Act. The bill is currently under review by the Senate Homeland Security Subcommittee on Regulatory Affairs and Federal Management and may go to vote as early as next month. If passed, the act will require all extra-legal peacekeepers to register their private identity with the government in exchange for a federal stipend and benefits.
At 6:03:36, Tony overrides the safety limitations on the RT core's power output, flips the armor's containment field so the discharge is internal rather than external, and prepares to trigger the venting procedure. He does all this from inside his head, with his great big brain, because his manual controls have been hijacked by a brilliant, damaged kid and because he's locked inside the one thing that has always saved him. Under those circumstances, electrocution's not a bad way to go.
"And don't touch anything you don't recognize," Rhodey adds. "Wait, scratch that—"
BOWMAN: That's the next stage. When I can consistently achieve more stable results, we'll broaden our criteria.
JK: Tony.
"Happy," he calls. Hap turns around, raises his eyebrows. "If you caught me doing something I shouldn't," Tony says. "Something… terrible. If I lost control. Would you stop me?"
"If you weren't so focused on getting your own way, you'd have thought through the consequences of putting the names of every single costumed hero in one place. It's shortsighted. It's dangerous, Stark "—every part of Tony throbs in time with the driving beat of his pulse through the bruised flesh of his side—"when you better than anyone know how easy it is to steal that information."
"They were holed up in a cave, really," she says. "The mountains there are riddled with them, and the organization that held Stark had enlarged the natural structure to make a fortified base. Stark and Yinsen were held near the back of the base behind a steel door."
"Done," Friday says. "Doctor Richards wants to discuss integrated rehabilitation programs while you tour Wonderland—"
It was raining when they laid Steve Rogers to rest. Maybe this time it'll stick. We've thought him dead before, and he took us by surprise. I hope he gets his rest this time, though. He deserves it. He may not have had a good death, but he had a good life—not a perfect life, but if St. Peter doesn't punch Cap's pass through the gates of heaven, then the poor sorry sons of bitches he left behind don't have any hope at all. We're still stuck out here in the rain, but you can take comfort in this: if Steve Rogers were here, he'd be arguing and shivering and soaked through and miserable right alongside the rest of us, too.
TS: And when we reformed, we decided we'd head it up together.

Carol's voice: "You know why you're an idiot, Tony?" He comes around just enough to realize that she's cradling him in a bridal carry. "You left a helicarrier full of your people parked six miles above Omaha. What the hell made you think we wouldn't help?"
"How'd you fix it?"
Dear Penelope,
Penny.
Penny,
Great, I'll let Aunt May know you'll come. You shouldn't have to worry about her, she is pretty accepting of everyone :)
Tony,
I'm glad you're looking after yourself and the baby. Really, I'm glad you're thinking of it. But not everyone would- or could- just stop. I mean, look at Spiderman. He's just a kid. He has plenty of excuses to not do the right thing, but he does, because he feels like he has the powers for a reason. And maybe when you're so smart, you have a responsibility to do what you can to help too. Maybe not in the suit right now, but what about when the baby is born? You aren't planning on being Ironwoman again?
Penny
She Hulk said it best- there is no avoiding it. This chase is a waste of taxpayer time and money, and will only make the end result worse for the errant Captain if he persists in evading capture. That's why we to are joining the cry, urging #confesscap. You owe those you pretend to represent nothing less.
Penny,

Loki is back is Asgard now, so you can take off the whole lock down thing.
NATASHA: Not your trial. The others, the people who have been captured.
Okay okay, I promise i'll be careful around Osborn. I'll make sure he never works out I'm Spiderman. I don't think he suspects me since he still think Spiderman is a guy. I mean I'm his Son's best friend, it wouldn't have been hard for him to trick me into a trap if he did suspect it was me under the mask.
Natasha.
This act is doing nothing but ruin lives, including ours.
Plus didn't all the research at the base get deleted? Osbourne would have been starting from square one if he'd managed to keep Wanda hostage.
You two look so cosy right now, I might just join you.
Florida is too hot. It is night. Why is it still hot! The Sun is in China right now!!
Or maybe it really is just a ransom. Or revenge. I've pissed off so many people lately I don't even know where to start.
So you really would have let me help? Like, as part of the Avengers? Okay...I'll take care of the tower. I was thinking maybe I could borrow you Lab to work on some tech? I had a couple ideas on how to improve the web shooters.

Anyway, you know you’re saying Spiderman’s reasons are still essentially selfish, right? She doesn’t have to be the only one going after this guy either. If she comes by the tower, we won’t try and uncover her identity. We just want to help.
Kind of hard to be whoever I want when the papers are putting out a pretty clear imagine. I assume you saw them this morning? Looks like Harry went to the papers after all. Though all the articles say is 'a source'.
Penny,
You did look after him. You just needed me to be there to look after you...
And why does that person have to be you?! You've done enough, let someone else handle things from here! Come home...
Sexy sexy Natasha :P
Cap has spoken to Spiderman again and it is definitely a girl under there; and just a kid from what he can tell. Definitely too young for this game, we’re not even sure she’s in high school. He’s asked me to help him track her down, make sure she’s safe. Of course, he’s conflicted about it as a betrayal of trust and ‘she has a secret identity for a reason and if she wanted us to know she would tell us’, but we are definitely dealing with a minor so, like I keep telling him, that gives us some responsibility. So look, when you next see her, tell her to use that big science-y brain of hers and see sense. I know of a school for people like her, and an old friend of mine that can train her up if she still wants to do the whole hero shtick. At the moment all she’s going to do is get killed, and I bet her family would miss her. Just tell her, okay?
(See the end of the chapter for
Steve,
You got him to say it?! How on earth did you get him to let you record him saying that? You know if you put that on the internet it would probably go viral in hours right? Did you ever explain the dick thing? It is kind of adorable he didn't realise XD. Thank you, I enjoyed that.
So why am I avoiding Captain America? He wouldn't tell me what happened when I asked, just got annoyed that you asked me to avoid him. You know if you are going to put me into the middle of a fight between you two I'd like to know what is going on.
Penny,
Well, tell Spiderman I hope she reconsiders. If she has a problem, she can go to the police, or swing by Avengers tower. She’ll be much more able to help if she gets proper training first. Right now she just has Captain America chasing around trying to find her and make sure she’s safe and not getting killed. I know you like hearing stories about the domestic life of Steven Rogers, but until this is sorted there won’t be any more- the dude is like never home. He missed the last two movie nights, and I don’t think I can take much more of Clint singing ‘How Does She Know You Love Her?’ while we wait for him to catch up.
A Revenge trip makes it sound like Spiderman is planning to hurt the guy when she finds him. That isn't right, she just wants him brought to justice. That guy killed an innocent man, it isn't fair that he gets to stay free, and Spiderman is the only one doing anything to try and catch him! If she does nothing then he could end up hurting someone else.
You are gonna be mad. You are going to be really mad, but you know what? I don't care! Cause i'm mad! I'm mad at you! For being so...pig headed and putting your feelings on this stupid act above your family again and again! You could just register, but nooo Captain America doesn't back down! Well you know what you aren't Captain America any more, you are Steve Rogers and you have a son to think about! So no, you don't get to stay in jail and be the martyr.
Oh, are you working on something new or is it business stuff?
Penny,
Dear Penny,
Dear Mr Stark.
Dear Mr Stark,
Do you need me to do anything to help set up for the party? Or should I just stay out the way and let your staff set up?
Steve, we've already tried to control this on our own. The Avengers failed. We let people run around unchecked and because of that children died. Children died because a group of fame hungry assholes tried to play hero for a fucking TV show!
I've been looking into it, but who ever broke in was good. They knew exactly how to get in and out without leaving any clues. If I didn't know any better I'd swear it was Antman who broke in! (I checked, Scott was with his Daughter in Florida at the time).
Speaking of, we'll be letting Harry go on Saturday, so buckle down. He signed a gag but I think he's going to blow your cover. Now might be a good time to change your name if you can, before you start the new school.
Did you see they’re showing some documentary about my Dad at the weekend? Just to say, don’t believe a word of it. He was a good business man but a crappy father, and I think they’re going to try and make it look like the other way around; not to mention make out that he and Cap were bff. Just don’t go watching it expecting it to be a true insight into your family history or anything.
I told you, I don't want to leave Aunt May to go to school, I'm not sure she'd cope on her own.
I bet red suits you too. You need to be flashier! You know, the old Razzle Dazzle and all. The only way to get confident is to fake it until it’s real.
I'm guessing she was the one who told you I was going to see Harry? Sorry I left out the Asgard part, but I knew she wouldn't let me go if she knew Loki was coming along...
I love you. See you soon.
Well, at least you made a friend. Just be careful she's not another fan in disguise. Or, in fact, a super villain in disguise, because it's not like this is even going to stay in your school. Pretty soon everyone is going to know that Spiderman is out in Florida, miles away from anyone that could actually help if someone was gunning for her, which, you know, is soooooooo unlikely now the world knows you are a) Spiderman and b) one of the richest heiresses in the world. So things are strained with May right now? Is that because by taking you away she's basically painted a huge target on your back and isolated you from any support? Because that's why I'm pissed at her.
That includes you. May’s insisting you go home, but we’ll work something out. Stay safe.
I kind of always liked the idea of Maria for a girl, after my Mom...maybe we could use one and have the other as the middle name.
So Lucy's the confidant kind, huh? Maybe she'll rub off on you :P
You really think I give the press photos like that?! You are meant to be coming home to me remember. Why would I destroy your reputation!?!
We reached out to Steve Stark, formerly Steve Rogers, aka Captain America, for comment. Stark, who now lives with his wife in a modest house in the suburbs, re-iterated his continuing opposition to enforced registration, but said he did not feel he could offer personal comment on Nomad as he no longer 'keeps up with superhuman affairs' and is instead 'focusing on his personal and family life'. He listed his interests as cooking, gardening and watching

Steve xxx
STEVE: I know. What's his name?
Tony,
I told you I don't like them talk about you like that! You aren't a bad guy Steve, in fact you are better than most. They don't get to talk bad about you.
Love you,
And how dare you criticize me for needing a break, you self righteous bastard. I left him with someone I could trust, or at least I someone I thought I could.
I doubt Cap will let me film me beating him in an arm wrestle. Maybe I can film the match agaisnt Thor, but i'm pretty sure that guy is going to win. I don't think Relative strength of a Spider is going to match up against the power of a God somehow...
Okay I couldn't understand a lot of that, your hand writing gets pretty bad when you are drunk apparently, so you might want to re-write some of it when you are sober if it was important.
I told you. Every other paternity test came back negative. And I’d be pretty hypocritical to be mad at you messing up.
I'm not withdrawing anything. Things need to change Steve, and I'm sick of having this argument with you! People died Steve, Children died! And you just want to put your head in the sand and carry on.
Look, you can’t stay pissed at me for showing up at your house. I showed you the letter, what was I meant to do? You need to be really careful if he’s intercepting your mail; and if he knows about how we’re related. Maybe you and your aunt should come stay in the tower for a while. Then I promise we can hang out when neither of us are in suits.
But we don't have to have them if you don't want to. I hear there's a pill for that these days.
I really wanted to wait until you were home to tell you this, but the press are hanging around and it won't be long until they notice...
When Steve is done with him, Tony sits up and takes the washcloth from him. “Let me.” Slowly, with careful strokes he cleans up the mess from Steve’s abdomen, taking his hands and cleaning those too, paying attention to every digit.
"Game time!" Clint announces out of nowhere, and Steve perks up. He loves games, and he grins at Tony.
"Look, Terminator. There's no way in the seven realms you'll find the same treatment here as with those Hydra snakes. No restraints, no pain, no panic," Tony counts on his fingers.
STEVE: If I did you'd have to arrest me. Put me in your lovely prison.
He said when Thor showed up, he ran off because he wasn't sure his brother would approve of him having knocked out some kid to use as a bargaining chip.
I'm not not going to the Prom because I can't afford a dress, I'm not going because Proms are stupid and boring when you don't have a date.
Natasha,
Do you think maybe he was mad because you insulted his piano playing?
'It just didn't add up,' Norman Skyers confides. 'We've seen before how keen Ms Stark is to keep her armour out of government and military control. I just kept asking “What changed?”.'
Penny
They are right about your hair cut though :P
to do, they were protecting civilians! And instead of helping them, your side shows up, beats them up, arrests them, and takes them to some prison in the Negative Zone that I
Penny
P.S Thanks, but it was.
Don't worry, I haven't told him anything about me being your kid. I think he knows there is something up, besides from me just being your intern, but he hasn't asked too many questions yet.
Every year the Make a Wish Foundation helps hundreds of young people like you to make their dreams come true. We are writing to you today to ask you and parent or guardian to fill out the following registration form or to let us know that you are opting out of the scheme. Under normal circumstances, this would have been done at the onset of treatment, so please return it as soon as you can. The full terms and conditions are enclosed and if you have any further questions your Oncologist will be only too happy to help.
Natasha.
And yes I'm talking to the school about uping security. I've been talking to the head of education anyway about getting some protection installed in schools, you know since...the incident. Midtown will be our pilot school before we roll it out across the country.
I'm trying to get in contact with Doctor Strange, maybe he can undo whatever Sin did to me...
Message me when you are up.
That does sound pretty terrible...but Harry isn't like that. Anyway, it isn't like I talk to his Dad much, he is hardly ever around. Running the company keeps him really busy I guess. I think I've only seen him about three times this year.
NATASHA: Fine!
Natasha.
right. You and Cap and Thor can be optimists all you like, Steve can make as many ‘I don’t like it but he deserves a second chance’ speeches as he likes, Thor can lecture me on this mystic mumbo-jumbo until the cows come home, but you are
Penny,
You remember you are on house arrest right? And even if you weren't do you really think Shield are going to give up the clone without a fight? I thought the plan was to stay out of prison from now on?
Thank you for the money by the way. I know Aunt May was worrying about paying for college. It does feel a little weird to take money from you when we've never met though...
I was studying with Harry and this guy with a green mask burst through the window. He threw some kind of weird gas bomb at us, and I guess it was knock out gas because I started to get really dizzy. Anyway when he went to grab me I kicked him really hard in the face...but I guess it was too hard because he went flying back through the window. Luckily he had this glider thing so he didn't fall to his death, but Harry was still conscious and when we got outside he asked me how the hell I did that and...I sort of told him I was spiderman.
P.P.P.S. Knock yourself out in the lab. It was pretty much run by Jarvis though, so you may need to order new equipment. Get whatever you need.
I trust the matter is now closed. However, if you have any further questions regarding the contents of this letter or other legal implications, please do not hesitate to contact myself. Enquiries of non-legal nature should be directed to Ms Pepper Potts, personal assistant to Mr Stark.
Dear Mr Stark,
Well?
P.S. Your son has his mother's smile.
Iron Man stickers are awesome. I’m glad to know you have such good taste.
Penny,
I promise I'll visit as soon as they let me. I can't believe they've bared you from having visitors until after the trial! You didn't need anyone's help to break out last time, so why do they think you'll need someone now. Idiots!
It is probably just something private. Want me to ask Harry?
Not Guilty
Don't bother asking the Parkers where I am. I haven't told anyone. So feel free to go home at any time. I won't be there.
Tell me you didn't know about this. Give me something.
Harry asked me if I wanted to go to Prom with him, which is pretty unusual. I'm 90% sure his Dad told him to ask, so I turned him down. Honestly he seemed relieved, probably because I know he already had a date lined up and probably didn't want to tell the poor girl he'd 'changed his mind'.
Yeah, kid, I am going to
Tony,
No-one else on my team trusts you any more. If they don't think I've left you already, they think I should. They're calling you a traitor. I don't know how many more noses I can break defending you. I don't want to think badly of you. You can't be on board with this. I know you thought registration was for the best, but this is out of hand. Please, tell me they're just using your tech. Tell me this life-time, imprisonment without trial is nothing to do with you. But if it is, don't lie to me.
Steve xxx
Dear Mr Stark,
And I need you.
However, if inside sources in the court are to be believed, Rogers is likely indeed to be proven 'very, very guilty'; as on top of the existing charges for which he was standing trial, he is now wanted for escaping imprisonment- an action that carries a minimum of a fifteen year sentence purely on it's own. Jennifer Walters, lawyer to much of the superhuman population and hero 'She Hulk' in her own right, gave us the following blunt statement:
I asked him why he didn't just go get The Avengers, and he said that he wasn't sure you'd trust him. He thought if he got me out first, you'd trust him when he told you the location of the Twins, plus he'd 'get to play the hero for once'.
However, if anything can send a man running back home with his tail between his legs, surely it is the news of his wife moving on. And if Natasha Stark's suspiciously round stomach is anything to go by, that is just what the billionaire tycoon has done. Stark has not been seen in the Ironwoman armour for several weeks now, fuelling suspicions- and if you look at her stomach, increasingly visible behind her oh-so-kitsch t-shirts and flattering dresses, you'll probably agree. Stark Industries is refusing to comment, which, as we all know, is almost as good as a straight-out admission.
I was hoping maybe we could meet up? Talk or something...I don't know....
You can't call because I don't want any smart-ass journalist hacking your voicemail for gossip! Stark email is un-hackable, as long as you've changed your password from Freedom123 that is >:P
P.S Fine, but I'm not really showing just yet. It'll be a while until I get fat.
NB: You're tellin' me.
He also used to be funny. Now he's only tired.
Dugan's telling the truth, but if Tony had to lay money, he'd lay money on Maria Hill, who is every bit as much a bastard as Fury. They won't stop looking for her; his personal regard for her aside, Tony never wanted and never asked to be made director precisely because he's aware of his tendency to abuse positions of power when he manages to seize them. Agreeing to work for SHIELD at all was a too-late overture, a desperate grasp at a check-and-balance system that never really did much to balance him in the first place. And more importantly, Hill was far more suited to the position. Tony had never had any intention of taking the job from someone who executed her duties with such extreme competence.
A few years ago I was allowed to go through a box of old photographs for a story I was doing on Avengers Mansion. There was a candid in there of Carol Danvers and Wanda Maximoff sitting on a kitchen counter sharing a carton of ice cream. I showed the picture to Carol. "Wanda and I were always getting caught eating out of the carton," she said. "Steve took that picture, and then he blew it up and gave us each a copy for Christmas." I told her I was surprised that Cap, a noted cartoonist, hadn't sketched them. "I said that, too," she replied. "And he said that by the time he finished drawing us, the ice cream would've melted."
"Fight what?" Tony says. "The system? The entire U.S. government? The president? The people? How do you think that's going to end for you? You aren't going to win this. Actually—huh. I'm not sure what's worse: that you're delusional enough to think you
Hill scoffs. "Spoken like a CEO."
One evening in late fall they'd been listening to Leonard Cohen while waiting for some cider to heat, and Steve had stopped with his head cocked to listen. "Oh," he'd said, and Tony had understood and felt echoed in his bones the familiarity of it. The lyric stayed with him:
"I didn't ask for this job." Just the facts, sir.
"Rhodes, it's
It's dark by the time he makes it back to the Tower. The drive did him no favors; he thought about contingency plans and about incentive and about Maya. Friday had been quiet, but every now and then the speakers would crackle with artificial distortion—letting him know that she was there, that she was listening. Hard to believe that she'd once been one of his problem children, but she'd had growing pains the same as any other person. He'd taken her off the workforce and given her a few years to grow up, and now she's brilliant and fathomless. He wishes he could say the same.
"No," Steve agrees. "Of course not."
VP: He always said, "Pep, don't let me end up like that. You tell me to quit, I quit, and if I get to the point where you're feedin' me mush 'cause I don't have the brains left to feed myself, you let me go." He never wanted this. He would've… he'd hate—
Senator John Boynton (D-NY) introduced the Superhuman Registration Act to the 109th U.S. Congress. It passed through both the House and Senate with unprecedented speed, and the president signed the bill into law in the early days of summer. Mere hours after it passed, Steve Rogers, in one of his usual iconic displays, announced his decision to resist Registration and go underground. Neither the announcement nor the resistance were peaceful.
After midnight, when Tony has finished a preliminary inspection and conferred with the fire captain, they'll all go home together: Tony and Carol, Jess and Jenn, Jan and Steve. Clint tries to convince the rest of them to stop for pizza on the way back. Hank carefully scoops up a moth with a bent wing and carries it back to the quinjet with cupped hands.  The Vision, in one of his curiously old-fashioned gestures, offers Wanda a hand to help her up the plane's ramp. Steve claps Tony on the shoulder as he passes and asks if he's heard from Rhodey lately. Tony takes off his helmet and follows. There is no Registration Act, because none is required.
. What Friday doesn't understand is the sheer astonishing juxtaposition of being a worthless piece of crap while sober and knowing with complete assurance that the world revolves around you when intoxicated. She doesn't understand that.
Here's how he solved the problem: mounted amongst all that machinery is a block of metal. Every time Rhodey fires, certain mechanisms sheer off a nanometric fragment of that block, and then specialized repulsors accelerate the fragment to a lethal velocity. Rhodey can adjust the size of the fragment, or the speed of it. Tony hasn't found much use for it in his own iteration of the Iron Man, but that doesn't mean there aren't other practical applications—what if he used the same concept to propel, oh, a temporary paralysis agent, or chaff, or some other kind of countermeasure?
TS: What else is out that way?
And Tony can't not follow, can he? Is anyone here really paying him any attention? (Sure they are; he makes for a good show.) Out in the hall, Boynton is blubbering. Tony steps forward, inserts himself into the scene.
On a personal note, I can only write in utmost support of Registration, or rather in support of the programs that have been passed alongside it. Had I been allowed to register my identity and received the care and support that are provided to those entered into the registry, countless lives might have been saved. Early detection is crucial, particularly in treatable cases like mine. I have hope that fair enforcement of Registration, and vigilance and compassion on the part of its administrators, will avert a great deal of further suffering.
DAEDALUS: You really think we're that close?
So tell me, Stark: why am I doing this?"
Tony skirts the edge of one of his fabricating units and comes up behind her. "My first attempt," he says. "It's pretty much defenseless—almost no weaponry. That was a problem."
He can't sleep on the plane. He can't even have Friday, at least during liftoff, although once they're in the air he slips his earbud back in his ear and slumps against his armrest. Having a window seat almost makes up for the indignity of being forced to sit in coach.
"Yeah. On my way," Tony says, and she follows Cap out of the kitchen. Her position doesn't escape her. She's just behind Stevie's shoulder. Watching, always watching, Stevie's back.
and until you're using those abilities to go out in the street and fight bad guys. In which case we're asking you to adhere to the same safety and procedural standards as any other first responder, which I think we can all agree is more than fair. There in the back—hit me.
"Yeah," Tony says. "That sounds about right."
Happy blows out a sigh between his teeth. "You know something, boss."
"The second one. Somethin's off."
What if Steve is right?
He doesn't feel hope when his ID card crackles to life again. He feels nothing at all when Steve's voice says, "All right, Stark. I'm giving you one chance." He doesn't feel hope; he doesn't feel anything. This is Tony Stark 2.0; he is not yet perfect, but under certain conditions of deprivation, he comes dangerously close.
Boynton doesn't say anything. The lines of his face pull tight—around his mouth, at the corners of his eyes, behind which sit the
Of course, Mr. Stark's commitment to extreme methodology isn't necessarily indicative of abnormality. He is, after all, a visionary, and visionaries often appear unstable to the eyes of the common man. However, taken as a whole alongside his publicly-admitted alcoholism, his sometimes manic behavior, and possible comorbid conditions like (again, this is nothing more than an informal estimate) anxiety, depression, and what may be a trauma disorder, we begin to see a picture that indicates a casual disregard for his own well-being.
Finally they had torn away the armor from his waist down, waiting for Tony to relax each piece into their hands as their fingers ran along the knobs of his ankles and the creases behind his knees and the soft insides of his thighs. He could still feel each part in his head, the connection made possible by Extremis so seamless it was like he still wore the Iron Man even as they yanked off his greaves and boots. He had put the armor on lockdown before, once upon a time when a kid named Mordred had found a backdoor into Tony's brain and used him like a weapon; as a preventative, Tony had shut the armor away from himself and set Friday to watch it. This was nothing like that. They weren't inside him. He could feel each piece of the armor as they'd grasped it and peeled it off.  He still wore the undersheath.
STARK: Does there need to be more?
"It's been weeks. I can't smell, but I've got a vivid imagination." He imagines that if he weren't hovering a couple of miles over the Upper Bay, one of her holograms would shimmer into life beside him—one of the human ones, maybe the woman with the asymmetric haircut or maybe one of her favorite celebrities. She used to do Einstein a lot, because she thought it was funny and because she liked the accent. Since she no longer has enough control over Iron Man to activate his projectors, he remains alone.
SR: Bill Mauldin just rolled over in his grave. Hey—
like, in some entrenched part of himself that he can't excise. In reality, even older iterations of the armor had automated processes that let them continue fighting if he lost consciousness. It can't have been more than ten seconds. His arms are braced in front of him while Rogers batters at him, over and over again, with his shield.
He came out a couple of years ago, when he started working closely with the Department of Defense. Maintaining a secret identity was childish, particularly when Tony Stark was a high-profile target in his own right. And it was good for the company—the people who didn't write Iron Man off as one more rich-guy adrenaline-junkie adventure took a second look at Stark Industries' employment policies, their charitable contributions, their green-energy initiatives, and decided that maybe Tony Stark wasn't a total waste of space after all. Discounting his patents. People always love Tony's patents.
Earlier I said that 'they' stripped him of his shield and 'they' handcuffed him instead of affording him the dignity he deserved, which was disingenuous bullshit of the kind Steve Rogers abhorred. Every journalist who chooses Steve Rogers as a subject encounters this problem sooner or later, because you can't write about one without eventually writing about the other. 'They' didn't strip Cap of his shield. Tony Stark did.
All the pain, all the suffering, all the blood and angry words—all for what? And you know, at the end, all he really wants is for it to be over.
He goes with scotch, neat, in a rocks glass although he neglects to add the ice. Why water down good scotch? Dad drank it straight. Tony drinks it straight. Mom was always more into bourbon or gin. He opens the bottle of scotch and pours it into a crystal rocks glass; the crystal is clear, sharp, beautiful, the scotch is gold, sharp, smooth. It's the smell that gets to him. Talisker 18, from the Isle of Skye—he had his first glass of it on his fifteenth birthday, and the smell takes him smack back to that age, when he never slept and ran on fumes and ideas for bettering the world. The truth is that it doesn't matter that he's drinking decent scotch. He'd drink boxed wine. He'd drink Everclear. He wouldn't water it down. Stark men don't.
"Good for them." Steve wasn't big on public appearances that focused on him, but he'd only ever sung the praises of Erskine, who was by all accounts not only a talented biochemist but a good man, which is more than Tony can claim on his bad days. Biochemistry's never been one of his pet interests.
"Boss?"
TS: Ha ha. Look, I've been busy lately—
"Sure thing," he says. "You'll let me pay for her college, though, right? Give me that at least."
gave a pop-up concert late last night in Central Park. The light show went on for almost forty minutes before the police finally arrived to shut her down. Gotta love a lady with a best-selling album who still gives free performances in the middle of NYC.
TS: That isn't my fault.
All he has to do is fall.
He didn't plan on saying that.
"I'm sure," Tony says. "Someone else needs the background here. We've got it, she wants it. Call it a contingency."
He sets down the glass of whisky with a tender care and doesn't spill a drop. "Have you talked to him lately? He misses you. It's sad. I once knew an orphan who looked less like a kicked puppy than he does these days."
Tony chuckles a little and comes over to sit on the side of Steve’s bed. Steve wishes he could see Tony’s eyes crinkle up the way they always do when he smiles at Steve, but he stays looking up. “You alright?”
It’s always like this with him. Tony tries to say something sweet in response and Steve says something totally disarming back. So sure of the fact that Tony loves him. Somehow that’s terrifying and comforting at the same time, being so transparent. He thinks Steve can probably see through anyone, though.
Steve just holds his hand out and Tony looks at him playfully incredulous. “Really! You need my help! Old man.”
“Makes it real.”
“Alright,” Tony murmurs. “You’re okay. You’re gonna be okay.”
“You’re welcome. You okay?”
Steve sits up and pats the spot next to him for Tony to sit down on.
“And he’s in bed? Is he okay?”
Tony opens the door slowly and takes a slow step inside, unsure of what he’s going to find. Steve turns over from his side to his back, facing up at the ceiling.
“I came up to see if you wanted to get dinner together tonight. Are you okay?”
“What? How late is it?”
“Come sit up. You’re okay. You gonna throw up?” Steve nods and takes a shallow, small breath. His shoulders are hunched, and Tony’s never seen him like this. “Okay, come on. Let’s go to the bathroom.”
“I’m not though,” he interrupts. “I have an eidetic memory now.”
“Okay,” Tony says, standing up and tidying his desk up a bit. “Take me to him, J,” he says as he walks to the elevator.
“I’m supposed to…” Steve starts. “I’m supposed to be perfect.” His voice cracks and his face crumbles and Tony’s other hand reaches out to hold him. “How could I forget her?”
“A little, but it’s still early to eat.”
Steve just laughs. “Everything? Do you have ninety years to listen?”
He slides over on the edge of the bed to give Steve room to throw his legs over and stand and then gets up and follows behind him. Tony stands in the threshold of the bathroom door, unsure whether or not to follow Steve in until Steve drops heavily to his knees in front of the toilet, like his strings have been cut. Tony squats down next to him and rubs a hand up his back. Steve’s breath leaves him in a rush.
“It is four PM, Sir.”
“We can order anyway. If you’re hungry now you can eat, or you can wait. But between your super soldier metabolism and the fact that you just threw up everything you ate today, you should eat if you’re hungry.”
Steve laughs wetly and nods.
“I know you will.”
“Can we talk about how you said you have an eidetic memory?”
Tony groans as he stands up and twists his spine. “This is the real reason I don’t drink anymore, so I don’t have to spend time on bathroom floors.”
Tony stretches his arms above his head and cracks his back as the workshop around him goes dark. “What’s going on in the outside world, buddy? Who’s around?”
I would spend my whole life listening to you talk about nothing, Tony thinks.
Tony orders for both of them, knowing what Steve likes and that he wouldn’t order as much as he needs to eat, and throws on a movie he knows Steve hasn’t seen yet but that doesn’t require much attention if he doesn’t feel up to watching.
“Thanks for taking care of me,” he murmurs, leaning his head on Tony’s shoulder.
“Yeah,” Steve says on a shallow exhale.
He can hear the elevator approach and stop at his floor, so he doesn’t jump when JARVIS announces Tony’s presence at his door.
Steve’s throat moves strangely, and Tony realizes what it is after a second, he looks like he’s going to be sick. Tony watches him for a second, and when it happens again and Steve clenches his jaw, Tony speaks up.
“What’s going on?” Tony asks softly.
“About your mom?”
“Natasha and Clint are at Shield. Dr. Banner is still at the biomedical conference.”
“Thanks,” he whispers.
“Oh, honey.”
Not yet. But soon.
“In his bedroom.”
“I miss my mom,” he murmurs. Tony’s heart clenches and he squeezes Steve’s hand in time. “I can’t remember her voice anymore.” His voice doesn’t crack, but only because it’s barely a whisper.
“Yeah, yeah.” Steve firmly doesn’t let go of Tony’s hand and Tony always tries hard to keep this thought out of his head, but he loves Steve. It’s not something he can get rid of, he doesn’t know how to stop. He just loves him. There’s nothing he can do. He just holds Steve’s hand back just as tight.
Steve nods. He’s still quiet and subdued, not back up to his normal self yet.
“You’re a human being. And you did not forget her. You still remember being with her, and how much you love her, and how much she loves you. One little piece of her gone isn’t everything about her gone.”
“You still feel sick?”
He hears Tony’s footsteps walk from his front door to his bedroom door and stop outside it. If he strains his ears, he can hear the hum of the reactor and the soft beat of his heart.
“Don’t. It’s okay.” Steve breathes. “You wanna get up off the floor?”
Steve nods up at the ceiling and then turns his face to Tony.
“That’s the first time I said that. I just realized it, earlier, but that’s the first time I said it.”
Tony fills the glass next to the sink and brings it back over to Steve.
“I know, baby. I won’t tell you it’s okay, because she’s your mom, and you can miss her, you’re gonna miss her no matter what I say or what I do for you, but you’re going to be okay. You’re gonna be alright. I promise.”
“I really liked the sound of her voice.”
“No. Sometimes, but not every day. I mean every time.”
“I’m not sure. His vital signs are regular, but this is abnormal behavior for him.”
The weight of Steve’s head resting on his shoulder is heaven. How such a simple thing can be so heavenly, Tony’ll never know. He doesn’t think something so simple has ever brought him this much pleasure in his life. It’s in the way Steve’s fine hair brushes against the column of his neck. The way he can smell Steve’s coconut shampoo.
“Steve. You’re a human being. You’re a human being who let a mad scientist pump him full of drugs, but you’re still a human being with human memory.”
"He used to go to the gym every day, you know, and there were… Boxers are often forced into retirement because of too many blows to the head. It's an early form of dementia. Punch-drunk, they call it."
"Business?" Steve echoes. "Seems like you've had a lot of business lately." That's Steve all over: relentless in a way Tony appreciates, because Steve has expectations, because Steve never cuts Tony any breaks and because Tony doesn't deserve to be cut breaks. Behind Steve, in the kitchen, Carol has one arm hooked over the back of her chair as she slouches flirtatiously in Rhodey's direction. It's working; Rhodey's looking at her like he looked at the repulsor-accelerated canon Tony welded to the War Machine last month, like he can't wait to find out all the ways she fires.
"Not the Raft?"
"But I came anyway," Tony agrees.
"Explain to me how unmasking is supposed to counter that, though," Tony says. "You want to come after the Avengers, fine. We're the big guns. We've got a target painted on our back and everyone knows it. How many of us maintain a private identity? Almost none. Registration hurts the little guys—the people who go out and stop robbers or pushers or street gangs."
In his entire life, Tony has encountered maybe half a dozen others. Reed's one. Maya Hansen is another. Maya's moral failings are dangerously obvious, though; they all know that there are circumstances under which the end justifies the means, but Maya had taken that shortcut more readily than she should've, and she'd done it in a way that had utterly abused Tony's faith in her. For that reason, she's currently serving out a twenty-year term in a woman's prison in upstate New York. Tony learned ruthlessness at the feet of a master.

ROGERS: At this point, I don't think there's anything we haven't talked about.
STARK: Is this a bet?
"You didn't hear what I said to him. Don't know what I was thinking, laying an ultimatum on him—I should know by now that only gets him desperate."
The laugh that comes out of Tony is less amused and more startled. "There's a lot of people who would disagree with you."
"Which means we can feed them false information," Hill says. "Lay a trap—"
DAEDALUS: A super-soldier biological compiler. I remember.
"Retaliation with extreme prejudice," he predicts. "Harsher sanctions, less forgiving sentences, more suspicion of those affiliated with the super-powered community no matter their political stance. We'd have control wrested from us. SHIELD has a long history of affiliation with extra-legals. They'd be pushed out in favor of an independent task force of enforcers… no, you're right. We have to bring them in."
CB: The gym I can see. You're all in astonishingly good shape.
"Sitrep!" he snaps.
To return to a favorite example: look at Captain America and Iron Man. While Cap's enhancement procedure means he is technically classified as a metahuman, Dr. Erskine's notes on the process (at least the parts that aren't redacted) indicate that the super-soldier serum only raised Steve Rogers's abilities to the peak of human potential, not past it. Actually, there's an argument to be made that Rogers's skill at martial arts and not the serum itself is what actually qualifies him for the metahuman label. If you need a moment of silence to contemplate a man who through practice and willpower alone can make himself capable of fighting alongside a god, feel free to take it.
He picks up the earpiece and carefully fits it over the ear that wasn't ripped off. The cartilage feels like tissue paper under his thick, deadened fingers.
It always works. Tony, in the end, is not a futurist but a defeatist.
DAEDALUS: If you say so.
TS: Besides that.
He builds a What If.
In the current microcosm, though, he's still a work-in-progress—"art is never finished, only abandoned" is a motto Tony lives by, and if his art is a weapon, at least he's in good company. He'll never make anything else as gorgeous as the Iron Man, and he'll do what he has to do to make sure the flesh and blood inside the suit are able to keep pace. In the meantime, though, he's still a work-in-progress. He still needs to sleep. He slips off while he's thinking of things to tell Steve, between one breath and the next, and for the first time in days, his dreams are safe and untroubled. It might be luck that all's right with the world. Tony prefers to think that it's good engineering.
"You could… what?" Iron Man says. "Take me off the playing field?"
"Why does SI make consumer products?" Lila wants to know. "It is… or
STARK: Favorite Avenger? It's cheating if I say Iron Man, isn't it? Then I'll go with Captain America. Nobody can get mad at you for picking Cap—he's everyone's favorite. Don't tell War Machine I said that. Yep, go ahead.
She needs to stop. "Does it ever bother you that you can't see it?"
Thirty thousand days ago, he got into this business because he wanted to help people. He wanted all kinds of other things, too, because he's always been a creature of unprejudiced want, but that was the base of it, underneath the thirst for atonement and betterment and recognition and redemption: he wanted to help people. And now he can't even do that; he's alone in the dark in an empty room with his demons pouring out of the bottle.
Now it's all logistics, and Tony excels at logistics. For him the paramount concern will always be application, not
Rhodey's right. It isn't fair to put that on her. She's a kid. He'll give her a couple of new supercomputers instead—she always gets a kick out of that, likes seeing if she can reverse-engineer the hardware.
The fifth blow cracks his faceplate open. One of his cheekbones gives way. If Rogers keeps this up, he's going to cave Iron Man's head in.
And how did theory pass into application?
That Dr. Yinsen was able to survive for three months in such mean conditions is a testament not only to his strength of character but also to his resourcefulness. He was carrying out humanitarian work in a small village when it came under attack from Ten Rings; a local informant identified him to the leaders of the terrorist cell, and he was taken captive to serve his jailers in whatever way they deemed necessary. Shortly thereafter, Stark was captured from the convoy carrying him from a U.S. Army forward operating base to the testing ground for one of his more recent weapons contracts. Details about what happened next are hard to come by; most of the reports on Stark's captivity remain top-secret.
If you watched the footage, you'd see Tony take his helmet off. You'd see him try not to breathe, try not to think, because thinking is what got him here. Thinking is the root of this whole fucking mess. Knowledge is the bait for the trap of the cage that he built himself. It's the anchor. It's the chain. And now he's stuck with the memory of something that used to blaze in his chest: a star made dense by grief and forewarning, a supernova collapse fueled by despair that crushes itself into nothing, nothing, nothing. He's left with nothing when that fuel runs out. There's a dense, black knot that sits behind the bone curve of his ribs which act as an event horizon beyond which no light can escape.
None of it compares. There is nothing in the world that beats flying.
"I am afraid of it," said the King, and this time it was his voice which sounded strange. "I thought, in the night time, that perhaps it was aiming too high. If people reach perfection they vanish, you know. It may mean the end of the Table. Supposing somebody were to find God?"
SR: Higher risk, higher reward.
They crash into the conference room together, grappling, until Steve manages to get Tony in some kind of hold that makes him incredibly, exactly aware of how delicate the bones in his wrist and elbow are. A little more force in one direction, and Tony will become double-jointed against his body's will. He mule-kicks blindly, catches Steve off-guard enough to scramble away—past the crumbled outer wall and the empty window frame and out into the garden.
