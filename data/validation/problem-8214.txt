Tony managed not to wince, but it took effort. "Because Steve wants nothing more than to go to a party with me," he said.
Doom.  It seemed more intelligent than the others.  It certainly sounded like him, but then, they all did.
The spear in her hand crumbled to dust, the chunk of melted slag that had once been a narrow, wicked-looking spear-head hitting the ground with a dull clang.
Hyde staggered forward a step and fell to one knee, and Steve rolled to his feet and slammed his shield into the other man's jaw in the same motion, using the momentum of his own upward movement to add power to the blow.
Steve, Tony decided, was cute when he was being idealistic. When he wasn't being infuriating because his ideals were blinding him to the only practical course of action.
"I can make coffee," Tony defended. He lifted his coffee mug and took a pointed sip, trying to pretend immunity to the way Steve's hair and eyelashes gleamed gold in the candlelight.
Tony let Steve tilt his chin up, let Steve lift the goggles he'd forgotten he was still wearing up to set them on his forehead, made himself meet those clear, blue eyes.
"Oh, don't do that," Jan said. "Just call me and we'll meet in the monitor room."
Part of him didn’t want to let Tony go, superstitiously afraid that his hands against the hole in Tony’s side were the only thing keeping him from bleeding out, but the paramedics could do more than he could.  Steve let Bucky pull him to his feet and out of the way, and watched as the SHIELD medics took Tony away from him.
"It was always your body," Steve objected. The scars had proved that, and the other details that had still been the same, like the line of his profile and the feel of his hair. His hair would feel the same as a man, wouldn't it? Steve wondered if he would ever get the chance not find out. "It was just... different."
Strange raised an eyebrow again, but thankfully let it go at that. Steve felt a brief flash of relief that he wasn't pushing further - everyone knew about the trial, and Hank nearly being sent to jail after being used as a pawn by Egghead, but the exact nature of what had happened between Hank and Jan was Jan's secret to tell, and not something Steve would have been comfortable sharing with anyone outside the Avengers. Even most of the current team didn't know exactly why their marriage had ended, just that it had.
"Put the guns down or I'll do worse to them," Wanda said.
Steve was still awake, of course. He was waiting for Tony in the kitchen, where he had washed and put away all the dishes from dinner and cleaned up every trace of Barnes's blood.
The flight back to Stark Tower was uneventful, if even colder than before. By the time they were over Times Square, Jan had lost all feeling in her fingers and toes. Hank was either treating her winter gloves and boots with Pym particles tonight, or he was sleeping in his lab. Which would probably be a more effective threat if he didn't frequently do that anyway, because he'd worked on something non-stop until he crashed.
Their voices followed him down the hall.
"You what?" Sam stared at her. He been working with Steve for years, Tony reflected, but moments like this made it obvious that he hadn't been on the Avengers for very long. The sheer amount of property damage they often caused took some time get used to - there were New York City officials and members of SI's board who still weren't used to it.
"Sure," Steve told her, his gaze still on Tony and the woman in the red dress.  "One water with lemon coming up."
There were no guards inside, and the security cameras were easily disabled. SHIELD would have detected her presence the moment the first one went offline, but that was all right. Let them come; by the time their agents arrived, Sin and her men would be long gone.
Tony hit the mat hard enough to knock the breath out of his lungs. Then he simply lay there for a moment, staring up at the ceiling and gasping in air. The workout room in the Avengers Tower had high, white, very basic ceilings, nothing like the decorative plasterwork the Mansion had had.
"Are you implying that you weren't man enough for Bethany?"
"So," he stammered, feeling his entire face flush with heat, "um, how
Tony, unsurprisingly, didn't answer. "You should go upstairs," Hank told Jan. "I'll be busy down here for a while." He didn't have time for any of this. He had a poison to analyze, and a paper for the
Beside him, Clint made frustrated noise.  "I can't get through to Wanda.  Or the Helicarrier.  Or Thor.  Where the heck is he?"
been getting better.
It wasn't really that funny, but Jan found herself laughing anyway. "Since when has being a superhero ever been glamorous?"
"Apparently because you don't trust me," Tony snapped back.
"Take it from a successful lab experiment," Steve said, laying one hand on Tony's shoulder. "It doesn't look that bad."
"About what?"
With a torrent of magic pouring through him, Strange did not feel the pain of the wound in his side, but when he glanced down, the silver handle of a leatherman was standing incongruously out from his side, surrounded by a dark patch of blood.
Tony slammed the hammer down again, then again, letting the noise drown out any further words. Can't hear you, Steve.
Bucky frowned down at the note in his hand, the paper white against stainless steel fingers. The black SHIELD uniform had finally stopped making him look like a stranger, but Steve would never grow entirely used to that metal arm, or lose the faint twinge of guilt he felt whenever he saw it.
There was so much of it, raw and pure and completely free of Chthon's touch, and the feel of it pouring into her was something beyond pain, making every nerve in her body sing.   She could no longer hear Chthon's voice, could no longer hear anything.
"I'm being stupid, aren't I?" Tony said ruefully, and Steve could hear the smile in his voice.
He twisted in his seat, looking up at Steve, and Steve was suddenly very aware that Tony's hand on his wrist was delicate, feminine. That there were breasts under that sweater, the faint swell of them very visible from this angle. He even smelled different, in some subtle way Steve couldn't quite define. Like a woman.
"Tony, what the hell? What's wrong?"
To be honest, it had been, but Steve hadn't thought- "I wanted to give you the benefit of the doubt, God knows why."
"Stabbed?" Tony's eyebrows arched. "I thought he'd been fried by magical feedback."
aloud, considering that Tony had drunk at the question, too.
When Hank was on a roll, he didn't need any input from anyone else in the room in order to keep going. After a while, Clint didn't even bother to make interested noises. Unless he actually fell asleep, Hank wasn't likely to notice.
Tony fired his jet boots and took off. Wanda's old teacher might be protected against her former student's magic, but that didn't necessarily mean that whatever sorcerous defenses she had would stand up against repulsor blasts.
Without her powers, she was essentially unarmed, and taking on Doombots barehanded only worked if you were Carol or She-Hulk.  And Chthon...
"I still can't believe you don't know how to cook." Steve was resting his chin on his hand, looking at Tony with an irritating mix of affection and amusement.
Jan looked up from where she had been busily slapping out the still-smoldering embers in Wanda's skirt. "And she's coming here?"
"I didn't
stab you in the back. Then you're left rotting in jail for their crimes, or trying to talk them out of cloning dead Initiative members as science projects."
"Let me guess. One of the poisoning victims?"
Technically, he'd agreed to take a day
"Just  so you know," Tony said, his tone conversational, "if you ever do that  with Jan in public again, Hank and I will begin plotting your demise.   It will involve poisonous insects and lasers."
Steve nodded. "You didn't seem surprised," he said again. "You were already thinking about how to keep their mission from being compromised while all I could think about was getting Bucky to stop bleeding. How many missions like this did you help clean up while you were running SHIELD?"
Three more targets to go, and SHIELD's supply of LMDs would be cut off. Without his army of duplicates to hide behind, Fury would have to come out of his hole and fight his enemies in person. When he did, Sin would be waiting for him.
Hank winced.  “I wasn’t.  I just… panicked.”
She almost pointed out that he'd been the one to form the alliance in the first place, but daddy didn't like it when she talked back.
Pepper was back in New York, holding down the fort in his absence. So was Happy. Rhodey? Rhodey had flown him out here; he could fly Tony to some place where he could get medical attention. Except that he would be no better prepared to deal with whatever this was than Tony was, and it was entirely possible that he might bleed to death internally in transit, leaving Rhodey with Tony's dead body on his hands, which would be an entirely unfair thing to do to someone.
He was breathing.  Steve felt dizzy with relief as he pried Tony’s breastplate loose.  As long as Tony was still alive, they could fix him.  Maybe it hadn’t been that bad.  The spear might have just grazed him, the magic knocking him out, or-
"I didn't have a choice," Tony said, feeling mildly defensive. "They were going to hurt each other. Someone had to do something."
"I believe the Avengers have something you desire."
"That's... it was a little like that, yeah."
common red ants, not
The Avengers were the only real family he had. It wasn't fair for things to go this wrong, this quickly.
Over the comlink, she could hear a loud thud, followed by Steve swearing.
Feeling hurt was silly, Steve told himself. He had known about the baby's existence for less than five minutes; he couldn't possibly have any emotional attachment to it already. And of course Tony didn't want to marry him. They'd barely been together a month. They hadn't told the rest of the team about it, hadn't even spent the night together yet, one of them always slipping away back to their own bed before morning to avoid the inevitable explanations that would follow if one of them was seen leaving the other's room early in the morning.
"I suspected that you were avoiding me, but I didn't think you'd actually tell Pepper not to let me in." Steve sounded slightly hurt.
"I should," Peter started, "I mean, um..." He wasn't an Avenger anymore, but Cap, Tony, and the others had been his teammates for a while there.
"That part of my life is over, Hank," she said firmly. "But... the next time you guys need help out on the West Coast, give me a call. You may not be my husband anymore, but you're still my teammate."
Tony’s fingers had curled around his, squeezing hard enough to make it plain that he wasn’t joking about the pain.   Wanda had slipped out at some point in the past few moments, quietly enough that Steve wasn’t sure Tony had even known she was there.
He saw only snatches of what was going on around them, afraid to look away from Tony for more than a moment.  Carol and Thor were restraining Doom, one of them holding each of his arms.  Jan was kneeling by Clint, who was sitting up, one arm wrapped around his ribs, and trying to wave her off toward Wanda.  Sam was on his knees, too, head bent, cradling Redwing in his arms.  Strange was still unconscious, his balled up cloak supporting his head, and Wong was crouched beside Wanda.
"They fixed my heart. Of course I funded their renovation." He was starting to worry, though, that maybe they hadn't fixed it completely, or that his transformation had somehow undone part of the surgical repairs. Or it might be nothing so exotic as that - he had inflicted a hell of a lot of abuse on his body over the past year. "If I can get Brooks Brothers and Armani tailored to fit me, you ought to be able to get someone to make you gloves," he added. "Do they have to be silk?"
"The Mansion doesn't have anyone in it right now but Steve and me," Tony interrupted. "You can even have your old room, if you don't mind some construction noises and the near total lack of furniture."
When she’d brought Simon back, it had been because she loved him, both for himself and for the ways in which he was a reflection of Vision, and because he loved her.  And possibly because he hadn’t truly been dead, just disembodied or turned into pure energy or… something.  No one had ever been particularly clear on that part.
Loki's smile was cold now, revealing teeth just a fraction too sharp to belong to anything human. "No, I merely had hoped that you would choose to follow the wisest course available to you. My aid is not a thing to be dismissed lightly. We were brothers once; does none of that bond remain?"
The plane came to a stop just as she completed the thought, and a blandly pleasant female voice crackled over the intercom, telling passengers that the plane had completed taxiing, and they were now permitted to unfasten their seat belts and proceed to the exits.
Sam nodded, putting his hands on his knees and visibly forcing himself to his feet.  Steve felt a pang of guilt; Sam was injured, if only minorly, and had probably needed the sleep Steve had interrupted.
was the one who was using him, wanted the spear in Doom's hands to further her own agenda, not his. The portions of Strange's spell aimed directly at thwarting Doom would overlook her presence, leaving Doom only the task of finding a spell that would allow a person with no magical abilities to remove the spear from its hiding place and carry it out to him. Then, he could use its power to demolish Strange for his interference.
Steve narrowed his eyes, his gaze never leaving the center of Tony's body mass, and said, with dignity, "I decided to forgive you long before I started sleeping with you."
"I didn't even know she was here," Steve said.
Tony raised his eyebrows, but sat in the chair without comment. Chivalry seemed to be engraved in Steve's genetic code, and protesting that he wasn't actually a woman only worked for a few minutes until Steve forgot himself again and did something like hold a door open for him. "So, the two of you are working together now? Should I be scared?"
Tony had had the workmen he'd hired mimic the original building plan and even decoration wherever possible, but the kitchen in the mostly reconstructed Avengers Mansion still didn't look quite like the old one. The table was brand new, missing the scars and dents where Thor had hammered tankards down on it, the scratch marks in the veneer where an eight-year-old Cassie Lang had tried to carve her initials in it, the stains in the wood from years of hard use. The floor, walls, and appliances were all pristine, and the spot over the table where one of Steve's pen and ink sketches had once hung was bare. But the warm – and dim – glow of the candles covered a multitude of sins, and with Steve across the table from him, it was almost possible to pretend that the mansion had never been destroyed at all.
Chthon could have done while he was in there, if he had felt like it. He should probably feel more traumatized. He'd been... rape was much too strong a word for it. He'd been
Sharon met his gaze, her eyes solemn; Steve suspected that she, too, was remembering listening to Bucky wheeze while the snake venom shut down his lungs. "So will we," she said, and it had the sound of a promise.
Steve made a face.  "Don't borrow trouble.  We've got enough already."
"The news crews are gone," Sam said, as Steve pulled the door open. "And the Wasp says the landscapers are on their way."
Tony struggled to get up, struggled to
"One of the differences between you and me is that you actually think about these things," Hank informed Tony.
"Take my word for it," Jan said. "It was intimidating."
He'd wait until Tony finally dragged himself out of his lab and came back up here. Then he would apologize.
Jan wanted to say.
Iron Man and the Wasp did not know what dangers they courted when they urged him to accept her aid.
"What the hell were you thinking, Hawkeye? She's powerful enough to reshape the world, and she's crazy. And she hates us!"
"Yeah, well, I'm kicking your manly ass tomorrow." Clint jabbed a finger at him. "Cap wants you and Wanda back in unarmed combat practice."
"Everyone's so big, and so loud," Jan sniffed, her voice just audible from where Steve knelt by Tony. "Help me, Clint. I'm scared."
"Just hit it with a repulsor beam!" she yelled.
Steve was grinning back now. "Oh, that wasn't showing off," he said, and threw himself into a back handspring to dodge Tony's next blow. "That was," he finished, now on the opposite side of the room. "We should do this more often," he added, as he braced himself for Tony's next attack. "I've missed this."
“Most people have no difficulty not getting killed,” Steve said mildly.
Steve gave Tony a look, which Tony didn't appear to notice. By this point, he'd probably forgotten that his lab was supposed to be off limits for the day. "Have fun," Steve sighed, giving up. He turned to Rhodey. "I'll walk you out."
It was silly, but just like that, Peter felt better prepared to tackle whatever work needed to be done on Hank's antidote. No matter how crazy his life had been lately, at least he still had his family, and as long as he had them, nothing could be that bad.
"Yes." Cap said flatly, speaking over him. "We're relatives."
Reality altering powers were something Sam preferred not to think about too hard — the broader implications were too disturbing. One little nudge at reality, and your entire life could be rewritten, huge chunks of your past erased or replaced. Powers could be given to you or taken away again, just like that. One wish spoken by the wrong person could change who you
Sam had been on edge, too, throwing himself into the practice with a little too much enthusiasm. Because of the John Donne manuscript, probably. He and Wanda were both uneasy about it, and they still hadn't managed to get Strange on the phone.
They swept each floor as they went up, a quick walk-through to ensure that people were actually evacuating and that nobody was being overlooked. The first and second floors were nearly empty, the third floor entirely so, and as they climbed the flights of stairs between floors, they passed a good two dozen people going down. Some of them looked relieved upon seeing Sam and Steve. More of them went wide-eyed and started to hurry down the steps faster.
"I've always wanted to be able to do that," Tony said, sitting across Steve's hips and smirking down at him. "You're right; it is fun." Then his eyes narrowed. "Did you let me do that on purpose?" he demanded, leaning forward menacingly and setting one arm across Steve's throat.
"We need those monitor lines to stay in place," Dr. Brackett countered. "Two of the victims have already died of heart failure brought on by the stress of whatever this is, and your relative," he stressed the word ever so slightly, "has a history of heart problems."
Daytime tv was sort of mind-numbing, even with the insane number of channels Tony’s television had.  Clint shifted slightly on the couch, trying to find an angle to lean back against the couch arm that would put the least amount of pressure on the bruises on his back.  It was, unsurprisingly, the one that put the most strain on his cracked ribs.
"Come then," Thor rumbled.  "We are ready for you."
needed to get away from it. She was breathing the stuff in right now, had been for at least five minutes, and she had no idea what it was.
Zemo and Mr. Hyde stood flanking her, Zemo brandishing his stupid glue gun. Atlas loomed behind the three of them, and the Wrecker, crowbar in hand, stood beside him, tapping the enchanted length of metal against his palm as if already anticipating the feel of it slamming into Tony's armor again.
The air was cool against his skin — he had not bothered to turn on the heat in the hotel room, since by Latverian standards the weather was still warm — and the feel of it made his face itch, as if he could actually sense Loki's eyes moving over his scars.
Luckily for Carol and Sam, Tony had gotten to back to the Tower just in time to drop off his bags, change into a suit that wasn't wrinkled, and dash out the door for the Meridian. They had made it with seconds to spare, only to find that Byrne was apparently running late.
"You forget who you speak to," Doom said, in tones of freezing menace. "You would accomplish nothing on your own, and amusing as it would be to see you fail and come crawling back, it would waste time." It was a calculated risk, all but daring her to leave, but the reminder of her own pathetic helplessness might work in his favor.
"She doesn't think we can trust her," Wanda said, "probably because we can't. She doesn't understand how much more dangerous Chthon is. She's never really faced him; I think she's thinking of him as just another magical being, like Morgan Le Fay or the embodiments of chaos and order that we ran into a few years ago. Something limited, human. Something that can be defeated." She took a bite of her sandwich, chewing it without enthusiasm, as if she were eating mostly out of a sense of duty.
If this  had still been the old Avengers, that would have gotten him a five  minute lecture on the importance of good nutrition from Thor, who had  not only been proud of being both barbaric and heathen, but had also  been a doctor in his civilian guise.  Well, that, or Hank McCoy would  have told him that people who skipped breakfast were however many times  more likely to die young than people who didn't.
"Where are the others?" Jan asked.  She was crouched on the floor of her prison, peering down at whatever Hank was trying to do to the circuitry and mechanisms inside the thing's wide base.  "Maybe they'll rescue us."
That was when Clint lost it and finally started laughing.
Just because he said it, Steve reminded himself, didn't mean he meant anything serious by it. They were friends as well as lovers. People loved their friends. Just because what he felt was a lot bigger and more complicated than simple friendship-with-benefits didn't mean that was what Tony felt, or meant.
Steve had taught her how to fight, had been the first person other than Pietro to care about her opinion enough to ask her what
There ought to be some way to increase the armor's ability to absorb kinetic force. Steve's shield's ability to do the same was an inherent property of vibranium and thus not replicable, but there were other things he could do. Force shields were too much of an energy drain, but maybe...
"No problem," Peter said, and went to find the hospital's lab. MJ and Aunt May would understand when he was late.
Tony closed his laptop with a click, pushing it away, and rubbed at his face again, this time with both hands, digging his fingers into his temples in little circular motions. "I'll send Pepper an email," he said, the words muffled. "I'm supposed to come in for a meeting with the design team for the Boeing thing first thing tomorrow morning, and Fury wants to talk to me about something or other, and she's getting deluged with calls and emails from reporters who want an interview; Sally Floyd's left her six voicemails this week. And I'm getting nowhere with this." He waved a hand at the laptop. "I know I can increase the power output by another fifteen percent, but I can't
Zemo was shouting something at Steve, his faint German accent making him sound like the villain from a bad World war Two movie. Tony tuned him out, refusing to let himself look back to make sure that Steve was holding his own. He would be. He always did.
"Actually, two weeks out of the past month he was in another dimension with Clea. Some kind of demonic entity was trying to breach the barriers between the dimensions and consume all life on earth." Wanda had pulled her torn gloves off by this point and draped them over the arm of her chair. The pink and red of her tights and cape were the brightest colors in the room, standing out vividly against the white walls and white tile floor; wearing her Scarlet Witch costume apparently made it easier for her to concentrate on magic.
She'd been so irrationally terrified... It had gotten better once she was larger, but it hadn't gone away until several hours after they'd started dosing her with Hank's antidote. After she'd cried all over Clint and thrown a screaming fit at the sight of Hank.
Steve swallowed, his throat suddenly so tight that it hurt.  “You nearly died.”  His voice grated, low and hoarse.  “Your heart stopped on the operating table.  They- they got it started again, but-“
It hadn't even occurred to Steve that he would still be doing it. Not intentionally, anyway. He'd sworn he was getting better. He
"This is where you should be, Wilson.  On your knees, begging forgiveness."
The name he had called her was not hers, and, she realized abruptly, she had no idea who he was.
"Maybe he's – she's," Tony corrected himself, "maybe she's not here to fight. Maybe she's just here to taunt us."
"Hank," Tony pointed out, "when you work on things for days on end without taking breaks, they tend to gain sentience and try to kill you."
— but the sick lurch in his stomach now was worse.
Sharon shook her head, a wisp of blonde hair that had escaped her tight ponytail falling into her face. "Does it really matter if it's her or him? Our people are just as dead either way. And either way, she won't stop until we capture her or kill her."
What happened when you had internal injuries while pregnant? Did that even make a difference? If he was bleeding into his abdominal cavity, that was dangerous and life-threatening regardless of what other physical abnormalities he was suffering.
Steve caught Tony's gaze, eyebrows raised in a silent question.
The more recent versions of the armor were more powerful and offered more protection, but there were times when he missed the flexible metal he'd used in the earlier designs. The arms and legs of the armor had been cast in single pieces then, with no need for joints, and it had simplified the construction considerably. It had also made the suit lighter, which meant that it had
hit you with it."
Technically, he could have just bought them in bulk from a sports supply store or bow hunting catalog, but Clint preferred to make them to his own specifications. Plus, even online, it was hard to find a supplier that would dye the fletching the right shade of purple.
Doom staggered back, swearing in Latverian, and Steve started to smile.  He couldn't see what Strange and Carol were doing, but from the sound of the curses he could hear Loki hissing, it was effective.
Everyone stared at him.  Steve and  Tony, who had reached the table just as Peter was finishing his last  sentence, were also staring at him.
Barnes eyed Steve and Tony's rumpled clothing, and Tony's disheveled hair, and then his gaze went to the plates, glasses, and candles on the table, and the empty bottle that sat in the center. "Sparkling cider?" he snorted at Steve, slumping forward a little to rest one elbow on the edge of the table. "You couldn't even buy your fella real champagne?"
the title read.
"It's a very small number," Tony confirmed. "It just doesn't happen."
"Thanks," Steve said. "Sorry we woke you up."
But this man -- all of these people -- were innocent civilians who had been exposed to the same toxin as she had, and if she tried anything, she could hurt one of them, and as off-balance as she was right now, she might not even realize it, might really hurt one of the people she was supposed to be protecting.
"She was possessed?" Steve's eyebrows shot up, and then his jaw tightened. "For how long?"
. It's theoretically possible. It has to be possible."
"You do realize it makes you look like Gilligan?" Clint called after him.
"Only nearly. Sorry to have disappointed you."
It was really remarkable that the three of them hadn't killed... well, more people than they actually had. Including themselves.
He would, Steve told himself. He had to. For now, he just had to have faith, trust in the fact that Tony was strong enough not to be broken by this. Steve sighed, and let his shoulders sag. He barely even noticed when Carol left the room.
At first glance, Wall Street looked perfectly normal, right down to the dozens of pedestrians clogging the sidewalk, everything from business-suited lawyers, to Japanese tourists, to teenagers in those ugly jeans that came pre-worn and paint-stained. Then the glass on the top floor window of one the buildings shattered outward, and a woman burst through it to fall screaming towards the street.
As soon as he saw the way the fabric of his tunic clung wetly to his skin, he could feel the warmth of the blood soaking into it, but the knife itself might as well have been stuck into someone else entirely.
to finish.
"It's safer this way," Hank was telling Wanda. "You get to keep your control over your own mind, and keep Chthon out of it."
Steve saw his hand come up, and raised his shield to cover himself, but he might as well not have bothered.  Doom's energy blast hit Tony dead on, a steady stream of blue-white fire that sent flickers of light crawling over the surface of his armor.
"Later," Tony said, holding up a hand to cut Steve off. He grabbed the back of the couch and shoved himself to his feet, half expecting the dizziness to get worse when he stood, and relieved to find that it didn't. He stretched carefully, feeling his spine pop, and triggered the underarmor, the liquid metal a spreading warmth over his skin that almost immediately cooled to room temperature. "Someone's broken into the museum, first floor, and taken out the security cameras in the special exhibit area. They've killed at least one guard already. With," he pulled the footage back up, enhanced it, "a very familiar-looking knife."
His only answer was silence; Thor was leaving it up to him.
"He should not be allowed to escape punishment for his crimes simply because he rules a country." Thor tossed the paper aside in disgust; it landed on the end table with the front page facing up, one of the
"And you
Dead like Steve had been. Dead like Bill Foster. The words hung in the air, no one needing to say them. Hank, she knew, could hear them anyway; he dropped his gaze to the tabletop, and fell silent.
Steve froze. Putting an arm around Tony had felt so natural; he hadn't stopped to think about what he was doing, what he was revealing.
"I read your interview," she repeated. "I want to apologize for the autopsy reports. I would never have left them on your desk like that if I'd known."
"Past evidence says that you do," Steve returned, annoyed now. "Drop the SHIELD links. I told Bucky they could call me if they needed back-up."
"Don was very specific about keeping you away from the armor right now," he reminded him.
Sex wasn't something Tony was ashamed of. Failure, or what he perceived as failure, was.
To ordinary eyes, the inside of the cathedral must have looked entirely normal, the stone wall and polished wooden pews glowing warmly in the dim light. The tiny brass number plates that marked each pew gleamed brightly, and the heavy gold embroidery on the green altar cloth blazed in the candlelight. Chthon's presence did not exist on the physical plane – it would not tarnish the brass candlestick holders or stain the altar screen or heavy wooden crucifix.
He dropped the data connection, feeling his muscles relax slightly as the pain vanished, leaving only the residual ache from yesterday, and forced himself to take a deep breath. His heart felt like it was fluttering in his chest when he disconnected, a lurching sensation that he couldn't help comparing to the way his cybernetic heart had stuttered when nearly out of power.
The whole thing happened in seconds, too swiftly for Jan or Carol to intervene.
"I can't!" She couldn't see Tony's face -- he'd summoned his armor as soon as they'd realized the air was contaminated -- but he sounded as desperate as she felt. "There's too many people. I could hurt someone!"
"I heard nothing," Thor interrupted.  "I would not act so dishonorably as to conceal such information from you, no matter how many other concerns you had."  His eyes went to Tony's limp body, and Steve felt a sick tightness in his throat.
Steve glanced back over his shoulder at Wanda and Clint, to find them moving to guard the team's flanks without needing to be told. He didn't need to check where Sam was; he'd been in enough tight situations with him to know which way he would move.
Sam turned to look at him. "What?"
"A lot. All we ever do is talk about you." Hank didn't rise to the bait, so Clint went on, "I was worried. I thought maybe there was something wrong with him. And it wasn't like he was going to tell us; we wouldn't have found out until he passed out on the Senate floor or fell out of the sky during a fight or something."
His armor was dead again.  It must have shorted out when the billboards blew.  Steve fumbled with almost invisible metal latches, trying to find the manual releases, because Tony would be pissed as hell if he used his shield to smash them open again.  It felt like hours before he felt the first catch come loose.
Tony didn't actually roll his eyes, but some quirk of facial expression implied the motion anyway. "Steve, not everyone enjoys art museums just because you think they should. Do you really think Hank would be here if it weren't an exhibit on debunked, pseudo-magical proto-chemistry?"
"We could do that," Steve said. "Yes. Let's do that."
"I thought we were going to stop talking about sex," Tony observed.
"Agatha
"I'm glad he didn't," Tony said. His voice had its old, familiar timber, the husky mezzo-soprano Steve had finally grown used to gone for good. "Hell, I ought to be thanking him. You have no idea how wonderful it is to have my own body back."
MJ's eyes widened slightly, and she took Peter by the arm and pulled him away from the nurses' station, out of earshot. "How bad is it?" she asked, voice low.
Wanda frowned, looking up from her interlaced fingers to study Thor intently. "And Loki just assumed that once female, you would be willing to produce a child with him?"
Redwing banked sharply to the left, letting out a steam whistle scream of displeasure, and the planter crashed into a store window.
“-thought of something less stupidly dangerous?”
Hell, he’d been looking forward to getting Tony to relax. Only, of course, Tony wasn't there. It probably hadn't been fair to take his disappointment out on Clint, but when Clint had offered him a leering grin over the breakfast table (a good half an hour after Tony had been due to arrive) and asked if Steve had any "plans" for when Tony got back, the retort that Clint was just jealous because he was still single had been out of Steve's mouth before he realize d that he sounded incredibly immature. Clint had informed him that he wasn't jealous, and that he if he wanted a girlfriend, he could go out and find one, and more easily than Steve could have, too. Then Hank had started laughing, and Sam, traitor that he was, had announced that Clint was right, and things had gone downhill from there.
When he got back to the living room, Hank and Jan were gone -- presumably to bed -- and Clint was stretched out on the couch, completely limp and already snoring. Tony was still sitting where Steve had left him, looking more dazed than he had just a few minutes ago.
Tony stood motionless, his face still under Steve's hands, expression unreadable.
"Oh," Tony said, quietly. "I thought you were just being noble."
"That's over twenty kilograms less than the average for this type of plant," Tony went on, pointing out something else DeFalco probably already knew. "And our highly advanced water filtration system allows us to remove all trace elements from the hot water we pump up from the aquifer, which means that our only industrial byproduct is one hundred percent pure H2O, which can be repurposed for other uses. Well, and the arsenic, mercury, and antimony we filter out of it. Right now we're using the antimony in alloys for several of the electronic circuits we assemble at our main plant and storing the rest, but our engineers are working on a way to reuse those, too."
"While I was a woman!"
Steve had missed that, he realized. Tony had only given in when his suggestion had been officially voted down by half the team. He hadn't just conceded and agreed to go along with whatever Steve wanted. He'd visibly flinched at Thor's anger, and the accusation that his poor decisions had cost lives, but he'd looked the rest of them straight in the eyes and argued his point, without apologies.
It made a grab for her, and Wanda ducked under its arm and inside its guard, shoving a fist-full of raw chaos energy into its metal faceplate.
"Just knocked out," Steve said, willing it to be true.  Wait.  "Sin?" He glanced at Tony then back to where Sam leaned against the door frame.  "Is she still in the house?"  He should have thought to check whether the mansion was clear before it even occurred to him to call SHIELD in.  What was wrong with him?
"Clint." Wanda laid her right hand on his arm, and Clint's flow of words instantly dried up. "It's all right."
“Some place I don’t have to wear a tuxedo or a suit and tie,” he told Tony.
Sam hadn't been there for the last time they had fought Chthon, or the time before that. Steve had done his best to brief him on what had happened each time, but he wasn't sure how well he understood the link between Wanda and Chthon himself.
Stopping Doom from turning half of Lower Manhattan into a flood basin as part of some dark ritual sacrifice - Steve still wasn't clear to whom, or what exactly Doom had intended to gain from it - had taken the entire day. Namor had grudgingly lent a hand, mostly because the resultant underwater earthquake when half of Manhattan caved into a vast sinkhole would have caused secondary tremors as far away as Atlantis. But as much as Steve enjoyed working with Namor occasionally, his presence tended to be as much a hindrance as a help. All these years later, and he still hadn't grasped how to work with a team.
"I've got it." Steve took a deep breath, hoping his minor miracle was still working, and commanded the armor to return itself to Tony's briefcase. Luck was still with him; the pieces floated up into the air and repacked themselves neatly into the metal case.
"I..." Don looked awkward for a moment, frowning down at the curved needle in his right hand as if he was hoping it would answer for him. Awkwardness was not something Clint had ever previously associated with him. "I was in town on family business, and I heard about the mass poisoning. I used to work here, once upon a time, so I thought I should come here and help out."
She was standing by a glass display case when they reached her, staring down at an old, leather bound book that had been carefully propped open to show an elaborate print of the symbols of the zodiac. The red leather of the cover and binding had faded to a rusty brown, and the pages were faded and worn.
Ben was regarding them seriously now, his eyes moving between them as if watching for some visible sign of their relationship. He looked much the same as he had the last time Tony had seen him, at the press conference after the SHRA's repeal; graying hair, glasses that he presumably wore by choice, since he could easily have replaced them with contacts, with the kind of good-quality wool trench-coat that lasted for years draped over one arm.
Tony claimed to be able to remember parts of his life in the alternate universe Reed Richard's kid had created. Wanda could remember bits and pieces of Magneto's mutant-dominated alternate reality. Sam had had two sets of memories long before either of those.
Tony closed his eyes and shoved his hands into his hair, fingers pressing hard at his temples — it eased the remainder of the headache, at least until he stopped. Of course Doom hadn't simply given up after they'd thwarted his attempt to grab the spear last spring. He was Victor von Doom. He'd spent his entire adult life attempting to punish Reed Richards for getting better grades than he had in grad school, and earning a PhD two months sooner than he had. He never gave up when he could hold a grudge, and he would have had the resources to know about the John Dee manuscript well before the exhibit had publicly opened. Hell, the museum probably would give diplomats from the Latverian embassy tours of it, if they asked nicely. In fact...
“She’s dead?”  That was… she wasn’t sure how she felt about that.  Just moments ago she had been sincerely wishing the other woman dead, but-  they were supposed to stop criminals and monsters, not kill them.  Not unless there was no other option.
Clint's gun made a barely audible whining sound as he fired it, the momentary flash of illumination showed Doom silhouetted against the darkness of the hallway, his armor a blaze of reflections and his dark green cloak leeched of color.  He dodged sideways, faster than anybody wearing that much armor ought to be able to, and Clint's energy bolt burned a chunk out of his cloak rather than catching him squarely in the center of his breastplate.
Just for that, Tony added extra force to the punch he threw at Steve's shoulder. Steve turned to deflect some of the force of the blow, but didn't manage to block it, and Tony felt a glow of satisfied accomplishment for a moment, before Steve launched a kick at his face.
"I didn't think I had too," she said dryly.  "They were practically sharing a room.  Not to mention clothing."
"The other two don't matter, Wilson," Sin shouted.  "I'm here for you and Rogers.  You'll pay for what you did to my father."
It wasn't alive, unlike the real Venom and Carnage symbiotes, but a byproduct of the toxin, which contained protein compounds from one of the symbiotes as well as a cocktail of biological and chemical agents. It was a nasty piece of work, originally designed by Doom as a contact poison and refined by A.I.M. into a more easily controllable airborne compound that entered the body via the respiratory tract.
"They're not here," Wanda said, stiffly. "Cap and Tony are both out."
Ouch. Jan winced, and laid a hand on Thor's arm, hoping the gesture conveyed her sympathy. Loki had been carrying out a vendetta against Thor for years, longer than any of the rest of them had been alive, but this was the most personal attack she had heard of yet.
"Listen to me," Tony went on, shaking his head. "You'd think I'd be used to this by now."
Tony said something to her, and she laughed and flicked a piece of hair back over her shoulder.
She wanted to let Chthon possess him, use his body as a shell to house a demon. Burn his intellect and soul out of him and leave just an empty doll behind for Chthon to-
"What would I do without my regular collection of bruises from being thrown into the mat?" Still grinning, Tony came at Steve, who sidestepped him easily. He blocked all but one of the flurry of blows Steve aimed at him, even managing to land one of his own in return.
"What did he mean, 'the other two are unimportant?'" Clint asked, folding his arms across his chest.  The gun he still held in his right hand made the motion awkward.
"Dugan, actually."
And now, it was now eight o'clock at night and no one had eaten dinner yet. And since it was Jarvis's day off, it was Steve and Jan's responsibility to make dinner.
"Jan took care of him."
"Thank you," Cap said. He sounded as if he meant it.
Don slapped a hand against the wall to steady himself, his cane coming within inches of hitting Clint in the shin. "Sorry," he blurted out. "I didn't know you were there."
"The incredibly disturbing bleeding has stopped," Tony said, in a monotone. "Please tell me that means this is over, I'm no longer pregnant, and we can never discuss this again."
"What?" Tony blinked at her, unsure what to make of this. "Why? Have they introduced some alien computer virus into the Extremis?"
Both of them had been watching Tony, too, just waiting for him to start drinking again. It was probably not a coincidence that Carol had refused to leave him alone after Steve's funeral, or that Sal had made a habit of checking on him every hour or so when he'd locked himself in one of the Helicarrier's tech labs.
"It's killing Simon," Carol said, finally, and Jan relaxed inwardly at the change of subject. "He still loves her, you know. More as a friend than anything else, but... he loves her. I know he wants to talk to her, but I think he still blames her for Vision dying and feels guilty for it. Simon doesn't like emotional confrontation." She smiled a little, just for a moment. "I think Jessica and I wore him out sometimes, honestly." Then the smile faded, and she added, quietly, "I don't know if he's afraid that she isn't really Wanda anymore, or that she is."
"Bold words for a man with no powers wielding an unfamiliar weapon," it sneered.
There was a moment of awkward silence, and Steve was contemplating shoving the cat off his chest and getting up rather than risking another nightmare when Sam spoke again.
All right, Tony
"Rape," she said, very quietly. Naming it made it worse, somehow, made it sound dirtier, more pathetic. "You call it rape. Of both of you," she added, quickly, when Clint swallowed hard and took a half-step backward. "That's sick." Jessica had been afraid to sleep, during those first weeks Carol had known her, afraid of what would happen to her in her dreams. Jessica, who was afraid of almost nothing. No wonder Wanda was willing to work with Loki if necessary to keep Chthon away from her. "That's... that thing is
"That's not always true," Wanda said, a little defensively.  Considering that Strange had all but written her off completely as crazy and beyond help a little over a year ago, it was awfully forgiving off her, probably moreso than Tony would have been.  The fact that he'd apologized and helped her when she'd escaped Chthon must have gone a long way.
Clint knew that feeling far better than he wanted to, both the guilt he could see in her face and the way memories you didn't want stayed on constant repeat in your head. After a long moment of silence, he offered, "I used to dream about seeing Bobbi get... burned."
Hank cleared his throat, and said, the words slightly awkward, "I wish I'd known about that when it was happening. You tried to help me – you were one of the only ones, actually." He looked away, down at the equipment he'd just finished adjusting, badly cut hair falling into his face again. "I owe you for that."
"I have it under control," Tony said, the words muffled by his fingers. "I told you, it's a side effect of the Extremis. I damaged it fighting the Mandarin."
Bored, and stuck in Avengers tower with nothing to do while Cap, Sam, Thor, and Carol got to handle all the meetings with SHIELD, the clean-up work with the city, getting the mansion cleaned up and repaired, and anything else remotely productive.
"Good art should be accessible to the average person. If it's a form of social protest, people should be able to understand what you're using it to say without needing you to explain it to them." He sounded really pompous, didn't he, Steve thought, wincing a little.
If someone had asked him, three days ago, if he would allow Strange and Wanda to change him back if the price for it was losing Steve, he would have told them no.
Sam raised his eyebrows. "Didn't Cap tell you to go get stitches for that?"
The need to act swiftly was an irritant in the back of his mind, continually running up against the need to handle Sin with care, and curb her bloodthirst and anarchistic tendencies. Yet one more indignity to make Strange pay for, given that it was his spell that made her presence necessary.
"I'll miss the chance to ask Councilman Englehart some probing questions about his pigeon population control legislation." Sam glanced over at the man again, eyes narrowing slightly; under the joking tone was a thread of something more serious.
Thank God Redwing still insisted on sleeping outside, away from what he thought of as 'the owl-book.'  He was a larger target than Jan was.
"I used my old override code." There was a strange note in Steve's voice.
"That... wasn't what I was worried about. Well, until just now." The possibility of 'coming back wrong' hadn't even occurred to him. Clint shook the thought off; it was better to not to wonder exactly how Wanda had brought him back, especially since she herself couldn't tell him. "I was kicking the cat out of Tony's work room and found this." He fished the crumpled and ragged-edged piece of paper out of his pocket, and held it out to Don. "It's some kind of prescription scrip. Is it something we should be concerned about?"
Tony nodded absently in acknowledgement, already accessing SHIELD's files on the current Lemurian political situation – both men had belonged to a radical faction that wanted to depose the current Empress and set up a separatist theocracy in her place – and shuffling through satellite newsfeeds one by one. Cracking the new encryption on SHIIELD's data and getting around their firewall took more effort than he had anticipated; he'd gotten used to having all of SHIELD's files at his fingertips, before he'd had to hand control of the organization back over to Fury. He didn't regret resigning as Director at all, but there were times when being locked out of SHIELD's databases once again were inconvenient. "The police are on the scene in the Upper East Side now," he said. "We probably have about six hours before the news reaches Lemuria. Was Barnes bleeding when you left the scene?"
"What time is it in New York?" Clint asked Hank. "Nevermind, I don't care. I'm calling Cap
That was an exaggeration, but unfortunately, not much of one. "That's not the point," Tony said. "The point is that I can pay other people to cook for me."
"Which, of course, you did," Hank put in, without looking up from where he was absently playing with the bandage on his sprained wrist. He had injured the wrist escaping from Kang's guards, and his costume had been so badly burned and torn that he, too, had had to change into the extra clothes he kept around in his lab. Hank's "lab accident clothes" featured an Empire State University t-shirt and a much-abused white lab coat, and the dark circles of exhaustion under his eyes completed what Tony had once described as "the graduate student look."
"Pym, I cannot believe you left me alone with the teenagers to play secretary." James Rhodes' voice was sharp and clear, but with the faint electronic hum in the background that meant he was using the War Machine armor's headset and mike rather than a telephone.
"Good job today," Steve told her. "We couldn't have taken Kang down if you hadn't disrupted his energy shield for us."
Steve blanched. "I hadn't thought of that." He was still staring at the door Tony had disappeared through, his jaw set.
"I'm just glad the restaurant is still there." Don's voice, vaguely Midwestern and always deeper than Clint remembered it as — probably because everything sounded high-pitched compared to Thor's rumbling bass. "I think it's been four years since the last time I ate there." He and Jarvis turned the corner, and only a quick side-step on Clint's part kept them from running straight into him.
"I don't do casual sex with women - with people." Steve ran one hand up Tony's back, hooking his fingers under the elastic of the sports bra and pulling it upward. Tony raised his arms, letting Steve pulled the bra up and over his head, revealing two small, round breasts. They were pale, with hard, dark nipples, the skin between them a spider web of scar tissue - the same familiar ragged mess of scars Steve had seen before when sparring with Tony, and that one, memorable time when a supervillain had made his armor disintegrate. Proof, if he needed any more, that this was really Tony, was the same person who'd been his friend for years. The same person he'd wanted for years. "It didn't work with Rachel," he went on, knowing he was babbling, a she traced the line of one scar with a fingertip, following it outward from Tony's heart over the curve of his breast to where it ended, just above the nipple. It was slightly different in texture from the soft skin surrounding it, and paler, the end of the scar partially bisecting the dark aureole. "I'm not good at it. Sex means something, Tony. We can't just-"
"How thoroughly, um, feminine are you? Could you pass a DNA test?"
"It was on the news." Tony's voice was low, even. "I thought you knew."
The constant stream of disasters in Manhattan hadn't stopped. If anything, it seemed to be spreading — there had been a three-alarm fire in Brooklyn yesterday, apparently caused by a single dropped cigarette, and a woman in Chelsea had stabbed her husband and two dinner guests to death with a kitchen knife, before turning it on herself. Disasters, accidents, and a wave of violent crimes, all frustratingly completely beyond their ability to stop. Half the time, there wasn't even anything Steve could try to do to help.
When superheroes couldn't trust themselves, it was impossible to expect the public to trust them, especially after disasters like Stamford. Proving they were safe, non-threatening, willing to follow the rules... had not been a very good solution, but it had been better than proving everyone's fears right would have been. Had been.
"Just leave me alone," Jan said, her voice muffled.
Agatha smiled gently at her. "I know it has, dear. I summoned him." She was standing now, one hand on Wanda's arm - when had she moved? "Sit back down and finish your tea. You're perfectly safe. I've made certain of it."
Rhodey tossed the feathers away from him. The cat launched itself at them with a clumsy speed that Steve had learned by this point was born of insanity. "After Gyrich, Gauntlet, and Justice, stopping crazy people from jumping out tenth-story windows is a vacation," Rhodey said, cat dealt with.
“It healed as soon as I turned into Thor.”
“Whatever we fought, it wasn’t Sin anymore.”  Had she still been in there somewhere, the way Luhkin had still been trapped inside the Red Skull’s stolen body, or had Chthon killed her when he took possession of her?
"It took you that long?" Luke said.  "The rest of us figured it out two days after we joined the team."
"I heard," Hank's voice came through sharply. "I'm contacting everyone as we speak. Falcon, Carol, Hawkeye, War Machine. Where should I tell them to go?"
Don stepped forward before he could, taking Tony by the arm and leading him away from the quinjet, asking Hank a series of questions that were mostly inaudible from where Steve was standing.
The air pressure dropped perceptibly, and Hank heard thunder rumbling in the distance, just at the border of audible sound. "Be silent, little man." Thor's voice was low, the flat words said quietly, but with enough intensity to make the test tubes neatly arrayed in their rack to Hank's left rattle. "Or I will forget all that I owe to the Avengers and deal with you as I would a warrior of Asgard who had acted thus." His eyes were narrow flickers of blue, and his hair seemed to float in a nonexistent wind for a moment, and Hank fought the urge to literally shrink down into the floor.
"What do you mean, not binding?" Steve demanded, and Tony had to look away from the expression on his face. He was doing this for Steve's own good, he reminded himself, giving him a graceful out now, without the humiliation of trying to make it work and failing. "Nothing's changed!"
The worst part about deep bruises and broken bones was how long they took to heal.  He wasn’t even seriously hurt, not like Tony was, but he was going to be stuck doing nothing for nearly as long, while his archery got rusty.  It could be worse – he could have broken his collarbone or sprained something; nothing took longer to heal than a bad sprain – but it was still a pain.
There was a tentative knock on the door. Steve glanced up, and found Carol and Rhodey hovering in the doorway. Carol was still in her Ms. Marvel costume, but Rhodey had lost the War Machine armor. The hospital personnel probably frowned on visitors who wore shoulder canons.
Jan rolled onto her side, facing away from him, and started crying quietly.
Hank opened his eyes, his hands coming away from his face.  “That’s… good,” he said tiredly.
Wanda rubbed the cat's other ear, carefully, then smiled when he leaned his head into her hand. "The book will be gone soon, kitty," she told him. "I won't let it hurt you." She paused for a second, stroking the six-toed foot splayed against Steve's scale-mail. "I'm glad
"That
"He needs an ambulance, too," Tony added.  He gestured vaguely in Sam's direction, then closed his eyes and turned his face into Steve's stomach.
"This isn't a comedy. I'm not writing Galaxy Quest, Clint."
"It massively stimulates adrenaline production," Hank was saying, "There's a whole cocktail of endocrine and hormonal chemicals in this thing. The symptoms are familiar, but I don't-- whatever AIM's done with it, it's so complicated that I can't place it. I hate being so damned useless!"
They landed on the bed hard, with Tony on top, and Steve spared a moment to be grateful that they had tested its structural integrity thoroughly. A less well-built piece of furniture wouldn't have taken kindly to having four hundred pounds abruptly dropped on top of it.
"It was over a year ago. I don't know why seeing him tonight shook me so much. I ought to be focusing on the positive; apparently it's really easy to talk people into setting up business meetings with you or settling lawsuits out of court when you're wearing a moderately revealing dress." He shook his head, smiling wryly, and it struck Steve once again how different Tony's facial expressions looked without the mustache or goatee to hide or emphasize them. The smile didn't reach his eyes. "I suppose there had to be some consolation for having this done to my body."
"She said I did the right thing." Tony's voice was quiet, and his gaze was fixed firmly on his hands. "I don't remember most of it. Ben Urich was there, I think. I don't know. That entire week is sort of a blank. She probably thinks I owed her one; there were things she could have printed that she kept quiet about."
