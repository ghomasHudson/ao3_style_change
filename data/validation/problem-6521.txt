"But I signed. You are paying me an absurd amount of money and making me breakfast. I don't care about people taking my picture. I don't care about people taking my picture when I'm standing next to you, either."
“It is not a life-altering choice. You’ve been to my place, you like the bathtub, so I’ll get you a mattress that feels like a rock and you will never want to leave.”
"This is the most real anything has felt in months. Don't say you want to change it just because we are a bit rough around the edges."
"We were friends for a very long time. It, um, the relationship we shoulda had wasn't the sort of thing that was tolerated."
“I was worried about you, then I saw the photographs of you online. Tony Stark is not what I would’ve expected, but you have never been predictable in the traditional sense. I had to ask Sam if it was real because I couldn’t reach you.”
"Oh!" The kid's eyes lit up. "Because he's brilliant. He does everything, invents things that would take a thousand people ten more years to think up. Tony Stark is like the sun and everything else in the world of technology revolves around him.”
“No. Nat will show up when she wants to. I’ll turn around on the street and she’s just there, like she never left. Sam only gets a couple weeks of vacation each year and he won’t spend all of it coming here to see my sorry ass.”
“You know, I think I might have set the bar too high with you, Steve.” Pepper sighed. “Maybe I should’ve gotten someone a bit more …” She shook her head. “Average.”
Steve nodded and greeted Happy with, "Hello." He gestured to the limousine in front of his apartment and asked, "Is this how Mr. Stark usually picks up his dates?"
Tony sat up, patted Steve on the arm, and replied, “You’ll get there. We will get there together, right?”
Tony led them over to the couch, but the reporter pulled up an armchair. Tony bristled at the idea of someone making themselves at home in his penthouse and Steve shot him a look that said,
He took a deep breath and told himself, “You don’t need to look good. He is contractually obligated to date you for another eleven months.” He hadn’t seen Tony in eight days.
"Can't even go a day without me, Stark?" Steve pulled lightly on Tony's lapels then smoothed them out. He tilted his head down a bit to press his lips against Tony's cheek. "I missed you too."
Steve could change it a bit. He could run out and buy new sheets or maybe some curtains. Peggy mentioned once that “curtains make you feel like you own the place.” However, Steve couldn’t do anything about the square footage or make himself stop dreaming about the hot water at Tony’s. After about ninety seconds of consideration, Steve decided to leave his apartment as it was.
Tony grimaced. Steve didn't really know what to call it; the metal ring about four inches in diameter giving off a neon blue light.
“James would always tell me, ‘I wanna see you more often, балерина, you’re too pretty to be a ghost.’ I keep thinking he must have felt so alone.”
"I don't know about that, there's another photo here of you kissing him good-bye out front of his skyscraper. Because he's a billionaire who has a skyscraper."
He stayed in his apartment the next day and only turned on the TV for noise. Steve cleaned for awhile, and when that was done he had a sandwich delivered. Wednesday slowly wasted away and the only thing that kept him moving was knowing he had somewhere to be on Thursday.
At that moment, Steve recognized these people were his first test. They all believed this relationship was real. Hell, they probably thought it was more than seven days old. Tony looked at him with desperate eyes and silently begged Steve to convince them this relationship was legit. New strategy, then. He needed to improvise. Steve couldn't learn to act in the next fifteen seconds, but he could let his guard down. Perhaps tonight he could allow himself to like Tony the way he wanted to.
“Don’t tell me what Bucky would’ve wanted!” Steve half-shouted. “I know what he would have wanted. He wanted me to catch him and I didn’t.”
Steve clicked the red icon to hang up and sagged against the wall. He closed his eyes and replayed the conversation in his head.
Tony disappeared into the workshop on Tuesday. He came up for a meeting on Wednesday and when Steve tried to approach him, Tony held up one hand.
Any negative thoughts about his not-feelings for Tony were pushed aside the moment Steve opened the bathroom door. Again, a room without personality but a bathtub that looked to be over six feet long. He'd intended to take a shower to wash off the day, but he hadn't taken a bath in God only knew how long. (Truth be told, he knew exactly how long because in late 2008 he took Peggy to a place up in Norway to see the Northern Lights. Their cabin had a massive sunken tub and suffice it to say that was a very memorable bath.)
"I have my VA therapy on Saturdays. After those meetings I'm not much for talking. Or walking. Or doing much of anything."
"So you're not ..." Steve didn't have the words to finish the question so he rephrased. "In the past few days I've only heard about women. Never any men."
"I don't know," Tony admitted. "No cause for much hand-holding in my relationships. Also very little cause for clothes."
There weren’t any high notes to hit, nothing Steve couldn’t handle. And it summed up everything quite well. The feeling inside Steve’s stomach was a little funny. There was a freedom in it, now, being able to look at a man and admit he was handsome. Tony was so much of everything Steve hadn’t been allowed to want, part of him was still afraid to take it.
"What gives you the right to know?!" Steve stood up and tossed his pizza slice into the box as rage warmed him from tip to toe. "This is a business deal, Stark, I am not a project for you to study or a problem that needs to be fixed. This is my life and I don't want you or Miss Potts or anyone else digging into it!"
“That’s true.” Steve laughed. “My dad died in the army, so I always had a bitterness toward the idea of being a soldier. I wanted to be an art teacher, never really considered the military until Bucky went in. Even then, I was too small until I was nineteen. The moment I stepped into basic, everyone wanted me in a box. I let them keep me there because I thought I was fighting for something better. Something good.”
“There is something I want to talk to you about.” Tony said, cutting Steve off. He paused, and right before he was about to say something, he changed his mind. “How did you manage to bake a lasagna in that tiny oven?”
Had he been waiting by the phone? Had Tony been sitting there in his room, wanting to call Steve? He blushed at the thought. Tony looked a wreck, sitting on the floor, button-down undone down to his stomach with his back resting against the side of the bed.
“He was my friend, too,” snapped Peggy. “I knew him, and he took a risk that cost him his life. You have to allow him the dignity of that choice, and the last thing he would have wanted was for you to stop living your life. He would hate knowing we lost our chance. The universe has given you another one and James would want you to give it your best shot.”
Steve closed his eyes and let his arms rest on the edges of the tub. As the water rose, he listened to the water pouring from the faucet. The steadiness of it numbed him and he sank a bit deeper into the warmth as the water rose to the top of his thighs. All the tension of the past few months began to ebb.
"You are a presumptuous asshole, Steve." Tony crossed his arms and leaned further back in his chair. "Everyone loses people they love, but you haven't asked who I lost or what happened to me in Afghanistan."
Steve stared at the door and wondered why. When had he decided to stop being himself? The obvious answer was that he stopped being Captain America when Bucky died. But as Steve sat there in Tony Stark’s God-only-knew-how-many-millions-this-cost penthouse, that answer didn’t feel right. Any man would’ve cried after losing his childhood best friend. Any man would mourn a lost love. But when had he stopped? Maybe that was the problem: Steve never stopped reliving that heartbreak.
"First off, all those women were from a New Year's Eve party. I couldn't tell you what we did because, well ... I am in this situation for a reason. While they're real shit for doing it, the board isn't wrong that I have problems. Not that they care
There was just enough time for Steve to brace himself before he received a hug so tight his ribs threatened to crack. His toes dangled a good two inches above the ground as he wrapped his arms around Thor's shoulders and gave him a friendly pat on the back. He croaked out,
Banner shrugged and adjusted his glasses as he said, "It's positive," which sent Tony into a fit of giggles. Steve didn't know what to do with himself, so he plastered a half-assed smile on his face and tried not to fidget in the loafers he hadn't broken in. There was a lot of science talk Steve didn't bother listening to, instead electing to observe what he could see of the party. As Tony said, it was all mingling and handshaking with uppity finger food.
Steve shrugged and Tony walked away. Tension came off him in waves and it was reassuring, not being the only one who hated this setup. He didn't bother picking up the menu because he hadn't been lying to Mr. Stark; the burger and fries was always good. He sat in the booth, alone, for ten minutes. Steve smiled at their waitress when she brought out the drinks: two waters and one chocolate milkshake.
"How the hell would you know?! How could you possibly understand what it feels like? I could have saved the person I cared about most in the goddamn world, but I was not
"But this is different. You would be pretending to be in a relationship that will involve very real emotions. It sounds like something you would rather fight because fighting is a safety net. I believe you think that if you fight it, then maybe what you feel isn't real at all."
"We were together for years. More years than most people have before one of them gets down on a knee, but Peggy's English and I'm stationed here. Was, I mean. I
Tony drunk dialing halfway across the world like, "I love you and your shitty apartment and your shitty toolbox and your shitty t-shirts and your stupidly perfect teeth."
But none of those responses felt right. Steve wanted them to feel right. Tony Stark was one of the most interesting people Steve had ever met. And he was so fucking tired of being bored.
Thursday wasn’t bad. Steve went to Thorapy alone because Tony had a meeting. There were a lot of meetings in Tony’s world. He did manage to meet Steve for lunch before returning to the boardroom. They spent the evening in the workshop, where Steve watched Tony through a myriad of blue holograms and went through all of the paperwork that built up while Tony was away. He sorted everything into three piles: Sign This, Read This, and Burn This.
"'Impulsive' was the word they used. It's a nice way for them to say I didn't care whether I lived or died. I threw myself into our ops, always took the riskiest approach and nearly got men killed in the process. I only met Sam because my stupid ass got trapped and he is Air Force pararescue."
“So I did my lecture thing yesterday, you know. Because it’s what I’m here to do. Lecture. Tell people things about things that I know. I know things.
“He asked if I was going to see you again, and I told him yes. That was a week ago, and I haven’t heard from him since. It happens sometimes, and I’ve been rather busy.”
Natasha. But if he expected Tony to keep their arrangement under wraps, then Steve felt he needed to do the same.
“I don’t know, and I am tired of not knowing. I never got to know how that would work and I think about it all the time. What if we had just …” Steve shrugged. “What if we had tried? It haunts me. I don’t want to spend the rest of my life thinking, ‘What if I had given Tony a shot?’ I made that mistake once and it’s ruined me for a long time.”
"I am sorry, Tony. I told you that I wouldn't leave unless you asked me to, so this is me not leaving."
Steve’s phone buzzed for the third time. He rolled his eyes and pulled it out, wondering who could possibly be texting him. His closest friends were there at the table, and it was too late for Peggy to be texting. He apologized then looked at his phone to see two text messages.
“Steve!” Tony folded a brochure in half and stuffed it in his back pocket. “I was making conversation. You know.” He winked at the receptionist.
Tony had a half-dazed smile on his face as they walked downstairs. Steve locked the door behind them then fiddled with the key ring until he found the one with the green rubber lining at the top. He made it down to the landing and unlocked the mailbox. He was surprised to find a thick envelope inside. Steve pulled it out to see not one, but
“But she’s my employee. Happy’s an employee. Rhodey’s away all the time. I’m so lonely, Steve. Then you show up, looking like a fucking model. I haven’t gotten to see you with your shirt off yet, but I’m sure you’ve got great abs. I’ve gotten to see you every day and I love seeing you. I love spending time with you, fixing up your shitty apartment. It’s great in all its shittiness. You make me feel less alone, and now that I don’t have you around I feel even lonelier than before.”
“Even thinking about a learning curve makes me nervous. I have to remind myself all the time that it’s okay to want you. That it is
They focused on his quote about dating Tony, saying how Tony understood his grief and made Steve feel less alone. All the sappy bits Steve was happy to focus on, and not one mention of Tony’s drinking. Not one. It was all about Steve, actually, and that was what made this uncomfortable. He didn’t want to stand behind Tony, but he also didn’t want to stand in front of him. They were meant to be partners in this, side by side.
"It isn't just about the cameras, it is about what people choose to see in the photos. It is about what they say after looking at us together."
If it was anyone else, Steve would have hung up the phone. But Nat knew enough to warrant the question.
“I worked so hard to find you and he messes it up a month in? God, he’s done it this time. I will hang him upside-down from Dum-E by his ankles until he apologizes.”
“And I messed that up pretty badly.” Tony frowned then said, “Then I have to help. What will make this place feel like home to you?”
“He’s never had anyone he could trust to love him like that.” Nat nodded. “I understand what it’s like. You need to take it slow and all you can do is not let him push you away.”
“Tony Stark’s a cheap date?” Contessa Valentina Allegra de la Fontaine raised a perfectly-shaped eyebrow. “That’s a first.”
"Just making the rounds, you know," Tony said with an insincere smile. "It's a bit stuffy in here. Steve, this is Norman Osborn, Justin Hammer, Aldrich Killian, and Dr. Simon Gilbert."
“Tony doesn’t believe in pauses. With me and Buck, for so many years there were these pauses in the middle of conversations because we couldn’t say something. Long, agonizing silences where everyone could
Steve Rogers realized he would do very dangerous things for a nice shower. Dating Tony Stark was definitely on that list. Steve didn’t even need a fancy apartment, just one with a decent shower and a safe place for his bike. He toweled off and dressed before pulling half of a leftover sandwich from the fridge. Steve watched it spin around in the microwave and his mouth practically watered at the smell. He hadn't eaten a full meal since lunch the previous day, and that deli down the block made the best subs in Brooklyn.
Steve placed his phone on the nightstand and made sure to plug it in before unbuttoning his jeans. He wiggled out of the pants, folded them, and placed them in the second drawer of the bedside table. Steve unclasped his watch and laid it next to his phone. He dove beneath the blankets, pressed the side of his face into a too-thin pillow, and fell asleep the moment he closed his eyes.
The open duffel bag on the bed taunted him with its emptiness. Steve Rogers had seen war. He killed people, led more than a dozen ops, and still carried shrapnel in his left forearm. But he was not sure how to handle this.
Tony grumbled something unintelligible, so Steve tugged on his arm. He swatted Steve's hand away, so Steve tugged on his pajama pants. He dodged the pillow Tony threw his way as Jarvis said,
Natasha placed her phone on the table so both Steve and Sam could see the screen. It was a picture of Nat and a man with his arm around her shoulders and Nat’s arm across his back. She was blonde in the photo, so it must have been relatively recent. The man was a bit older with short blond hair and a very intense look on his face.
She smiled at him and sighed, "God, you are perfect for this." She placed a business card on the table. "If you're interested, come to my office at noon. I never get a lunch break anyway, might as well schedule the inevitable interruption myself."
and controlling the flow of information is a significant part of my job. They will not find anything we don't want them to find."
"I kissed him once, on a dare. It lasted so long that everyone knew what we were by the time it was over. I think we both knew that moment was the only time we'd hold each other like that. And then ..."
“I love you, too. I would fight anyone anywhere for you, just name the time and place. Daniel knows this, and he has accepted it. You will always be in my life.
“No, but you do see him for who he is. I worry what happens when you begin finding things you don’t like.”
Tony was wearing his own sort of billionaire camouflage. He wore a navy cable knit sweater and matching navy beanie with a khaki-colored puffball on top. He was wearing his glasses and an unbuttoned khaki trench coat. He looked good like that.
Tony was bad. Not the worst singer Steve had ever heard, that honor went firmly to Dum-Dum Dugan, but he was really bad. Steve laughed as he got to the chorus, and his heart did a little flip because anybody would’ve been happy to be serenaded by someone as confident, as charismatic as Tony.
“Why is it I’m always the one kissing you, Stark?” teased Steve. He couldn’t even keep a straight face. “Maybe you should kiss me.”
Steve stared into his closet and wondered what, exactly, he was supposed to wear. His closet was about as tall as the refrigerator and half as wide. There were a few button-downs, Army t-shirts, dark-colored hoodies, and a few leather jackets he collected over the years.
Steve obliged her, satisfied that Tony Stark posed no actual threat. He doubted Mr. Stark could even make it from the couch to the office door. Then again, if the papers were to be believed, Tony Stark could build a weapon with one hand, a rusty nail, and a flashlight.
"I can do this, be the public boyfriend you need me to be. But you will have to get used to me being a bit scared of all this."
He didn't believe it. Tony Stark didn't seem like the kind of man to toss women out of bed and demand they leave. Quite the opposite, Tony seemed to be the person who would jump away at the first opportunity. Tony Stark was a commitment-phobe, not a dick who forced women out of his bed at first light.
“I have no control over the outcome. None. Whether the surgery is a success or a failure; I have no impact on it. I have to trust other people to keep me alive, when all everyone has ever done is try to kidnap me, kill me, use me, frame me for illegal weapons sales—”
Tony said his life was insane. He told Steve what would happen when they stepped out of the limo and onto the red carpet, "More cameras than you've ever seen and too many questions you won't want to answer." But he was still surprised when he followed Tony out of the car and was blinded by flashbulbs. Steve could barely make out a few reporters through the din of voices.
"Do you paint over a Monet? Do you Photoshop a sunset? Mr. Stark only ever needs something to reduce shine and conceal the circles underneath his eyes. This is the easiest gig I get, and I can't fix gorgeous so I will leave you as you are."
"It's not the sort of thing you ask about," Steve answered. "If you wanted to tell me, you'd tell me."
Well, he might be a dick. Steve couldn't say for sure after knowing him for all of an hour and five minutes, but he had always been adept at reading people. Stark was more than the man presented in that article, so Steve placed it out of mind.
"Take my advice and run as far away from this man as you can. He's already ruined his own life; don't let him drag you down, too."
"Ohmahgawd," he grumbled through a mouthful. He fell backward into another free chair and said, "You have no idea how much I needed this."
Tony laughed. An honest-to-God, bent at the waist, guffaw kind of laugh that Steve didn't think he was capable of. Tony wiped his eyes and sighed like that was exactly the levity he needed.
"Because I like you. I'll admit I am bored off my ass and you are the most interesting thing to happen to me in God only knows how long. But in the three days people have begun to associate me with you, they tell me things."
“I can do it!” Pepper insisted, “I know the restaurants he likes, his favorite gifts, all the basics. Give me one minute to pull up his schedule—”
"Damn." Rhodes shook his head in disbelief, unable to wipe the smile off his face. "As soon as I heard Tony had a boyfriend, I had an entire interrogation planned; but you're
Steve used to hate this place. He was so small he'd get lost in a crowd and Bucky got worried sick, like a mom who lost her five-year-old at Coney Island. But now he could simply blend into the throngs of people; tourists, businessmen with more than one stick shoved up their ass, people heading off to visit family, people coming back from visiting family ... Steve didn't fit into any of those categories but it was nice to, for a moment, feel as if he could. He glanced at his watch to see he had fifteen minutes before his date, and it was only a five-minute walk away. He pulled out his phone to double-check the address.
“What am I supposed to do with this? I lost the first person I loved to war. I lost the second to grief. And now, if I go as deep into this as I want to … I could lose you, too. I won’t survive that.”
"We tried to work out the logistics of it. Of marriage, a family one day ... Then Bucky died and I became a different person."
Satisfied that Happy wasn’t listening in (And would never let on if he did.), Steve turned so his shoulder was pressed against the seat and he was face-to-face with Tony.
What was the proper attire for a first date? He hadn't dated in so long, and he showed up to his first date with Peggy in combat boots. What the hell was he thinking about, anyhow? There was no protocol for the first date with his billionaire boyfriend. Let alone his billionaire
Which is how he ended up at lunch with Colonel Rhodes somewhere in Chelsea. The place was very quaint and homey, the perfect spot to swap war stories. The most important part of it all was how Rhodes spoke about Tony. It was how Steve spoke about Sam, how Bucky spoke about Steve, true friendship that comes from years together in the trenches. Steve answered all Rhodes's questions honestly and enthusiastically because it felt real. He was having lunch with his boyfriend's best friend.
Steve laughed and wrapped his arms around Tony's shoulders to pull him close. Later he would lie and say he got caught up in the moment, but Steve knew exactly what he was doing when he gently kissed Tony on the forehead.
He was hyperaware of Tony's touch. They were talking in front of people, holding hands in front of people, and Steve leaned into him when he extended a hand to Dr. Banner.
“We are taking things slow. I don’t want him to spend money on a relationship until he is certain about it.”
“Thank you for saying so, but that wasn’t my question. I was asking how you knew I was, um, not straight.”
"You can try to take everything from him, and perhaps you'll succeed. But I promise there will never be a company with your name on it." Steve stepped away and took Tony's hand in his. "Have a nice night, gentlemen."
“Yes.” Pepper smiled sadly. “I did. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. I watched him do impossibly dangerous things, then we broke up and he got kidnapped by terrorists. He burned himself with a blowtorch? Just the average Thursday. Do I love him? Yes. As a girlfriend? Absolutely not.”
“Steve just got an invitation to your wedding,” replied Tony, “and he is sending in his RSVP. Including his very attractive plus-one.”
Steve finally finds that Vanity Fair article everyone keeps talking about, and his relationship to Tony ends before it even begins.
Steve grimaced and agreed, "I have been so bored the past three months. Brooklyn is all I have left of Bucky, but I see him everywhere. Then I met Tony, who is almost as lonely as I am, and I jumped in headfirst. I thought this is my guy, this is the guy who is going to help me get over Bucky. Then he called me out, said I don't actually want to move on. Which isn't true ... Except that it is." Steve ran a hand over his face and groaned. "I don't know."
“That was so unfair for you to steal my thunder like that,” he teased. “That was really sweet, Steve. I was hoping for ‘I Want Your Sex’ by George Michael, but that was good, too.”
Tony ordered the largest bucket and grabbed two chairs for them at the back. He handed the bucket to Steve, who began throwing bits of popcorn for Tony to catch in his mouth. Steve said,
He whispered to himself, "What the hell ...?" Then sipped some more of his drink. As he slurped the dregs at the bottom of the plastic cup, he glanced down at the business card on the table. It was vague, purposefully so. It had her name, Pepper Potts, and the address 200 Park Avenue.
A half hour later, the limo came to a stop on a familiar street. Steve could see Tony walking down from the end of the block, the same block where Steve had Thorapy each Thursday. At least, Steve was fairly certain that was Tony walking toward them. Happy opened the door moments later. Tony looked in, caught one glimpse of Steve, then stepped backward.
As he waited for the signal to change, Steve watched people walk right by Tony without noticing he was there. Tony glanced over every few seconds, waiting, almost hoping for someone to see him. Like he couldn’t stand to be alone. He was wearing a violet zip-up hoodie and thick-rimmed black glasses, and Steve’s heart did a little flip. Tony was such a nerd, but he rarely looked it. That moment was true Tony Stark and Steve hoped he would see it more often.
Most of the questions were like that, softballs he and Tony did not need to think about. Steve only answered when asked a direct question, leaving most of the detailed work to Tony. Then there was,
"Of course." Jarvis paused for a very long time as the elevator climbed past the fortieth floor. "You will go straight and make a left at the end of the hall."
“One for every day of the week,” he answered. Steve nodded toward his bedroom door and said, “Just there, on the left.”
“There is a conference in Germany where I’m scheduled to give a lecture. Then there are a few lectures I want to attend, as well. Did you know there are people making biodegradable plastic from cactus juice?”
“I’m just thinking, will it be the same for me? Riley and I hid for so long, I want to know what it’s like to love someone without hiding it.”
“Any man who is lucky enough to have a boyfriend who looks like you and is as loyal as you are, he won’t care what your apartment looks like. Especially since he’s got a pretty nice one of his own.”
"That sounds nice," Steve said, smiling. He nodded as he introduced Carol. "This is Major Danvers. Carol, this is Tony Stark."
Drinking, then. Steve felt incredibly shitty, knowing he'd driven Tony back to that point. It made Steve more determined than ever to make it right.
He didn’t take the bait and the frown didn’t leave Steve’s face. He watched as Tony made the purchases and briefly wondered whether that came out of his paycheck. He should’ve paid more attention to that contract. Tony paused to take photos with people when they asked, and Steve politely declined the request to be included. If a photo came out and he wasn’t smiling the right way, next thing he knew there would be a dozen articles about how there was trouble in Stark paradise.
Tony obliged him and haphazardly tossed the wrench onto the table. Steve pulled up his photos, clicked the one he wanted, and handed the phone to Tony.
"Good. Great. Fantastic. I should have made this our first date," Tony said. "Maybe we would have seen each other differently and you would have wanted to make this real."
“Yes.” Sam grinned and turned toward Tony with an amused glint in his eyes. “Yes, I am a guest of Mr. Stark.” He offered his hand. “I’ve heard a lot about you.”
"If you think Tony would need my help to kick your ass," Steve said, "you have greatly misread the situation."
"It meant everything to me." Steve pressed himself up to lean back on his elbows. "But I've been hiding my entire goddamn life; I don't need to do it anymore."
Tony giggled and Steve's heart melted. It was too easy to pretend with him, but wasn't this what he had been hired to do?
"Should Tony meet that three-month checkpoint, it would be another nine months before he is finally taken off probation. This is a yearlong commitment and I was originally intending to give you $50,000 per month, totaling $600,000. However, if you would like me to increase that to a million I would be more than willing to do so."
"If you'll permit it, we have a few questions. The article will be very short, and this shouldn't take more than twenty minutes."
Steve stepped into the water when it was barely warm enough not to chill him to the bone. The water pressure was awful and he grimaced against the cold spray. Steve managed to shampoo and condition his hair before the water scalded him. He hissed in pain then turned the knob to the right; the water chilled immediately. Steve half-fell onto the shower wall and sighed. He scrubbed off the sweat and grime, but parts of the run lingered. His privacy had disappeared. He pressed his forehead into the wall and asked himself, was it worth it?
"Captain Rogers, you're a new thing. You're not someone he picked up at a club or an event; if Miss Potts saw something in you then you've gotta be special. But Tony doesn't let people in because he's afraid of losing them, so he pushes the people he loves away. The more he cares, the harder he pushes and he is gonna hate how much he likes you."
Steve admitted, “I can't afford the sort of places you’re probably used to. You haven't paid me yet, and I don’t want to take advantage of whatever sort of partnership this is.”
“Look, Cap, if you and Barnes ever want to taste the rainbow, the Howling Commandos are pro-Skittles. That’s all I’m saying.”
“Bonnie Tyler?” Sam reasoned, “Are we talking ‘Holding Out for a Hero’ or ‘Total Eclipse of the Heart?’”
"You know what?" He stood up and shoved his hands in his pockets. In the only lie Steve would ever tell Tony, he said, "I don't think I care."
Tony gave him a sarcastic, “Hah hah, no, I want to see your closet. I have a bet going with Pep about how many size-small t-shirts you have.”
“Anyway, having an electromagnet hovering over your heart nonstop for three years messes with things. I had a heart attack and there is a pretty high likelihood it will happen again.”
“Mr. Stark has a meeting in Chelsea, and it should take an hour. I can swing by to pick you up while he’s there.”
"I haven't been with him long enough to know him like I oughta to answer that question. But I can say I like it when he laughs. I like that he can make something out of nothing and if he's hungry he can stuff an entire slice of pizza in his mouth. I hate people taking my picture and being in the public eye, but it's a concession I am willing to make."
Steve shrugged and said, “I have my pension. This first month has been enough to pay someone to clean my apartment and buy out my lease. I’ll also go shopping for clothes that are more appropriate and … Well, there is something I would like your help with.”
Steve stepped back inside and slammed the door shut. They had his address. They knew where he lived. There were other people in the building whose lives would be altered by this development. He thought there would be a reprieve, a moment to breathe before decisions had to be made about his living situation. Outside of the lock on the front door and the lock on his apartment door, there was no security. Was Steve putting fellow residents in harm’s way? What the hell did the photographers want, anyway? Photos of him weren’t worth much unless he was with Tony.
He steered them toward the diner door and asked, "Yeah, Tony, pancakes or a milkshake?" Steve looked back to see the photographers hadn't missed a beat. "This place has a great burger and fries ..."
"I was gonna take the subway," Steve said with a sigh. He looked around at everyone who had paused their journeys to stare at him, or maybe stare at the limo blocking traffic. "I'm not the limousine sorta person."
“I don’t think this is meant to be home. It’s a place to regroup, to think, but if I’m still here two years from now, if I am still stuck this far in the past, then I don't think there is much hope for me.”
“Mhmm. It says as the Libra moon you are inclined to need a partner to feel complete.” He handed the book back to Steve. “Fitting.”
It was too fucking weird. Tony smiled like he was sixteen and Steve just agreed to take him to prom. Steve shouldn't have let it happen, he had let his guard down too far, but that smile made him feel something he hadn't felt since before he lost Bucky. Something he used to feel
And he did; walked down the hall and into her massive office. His apartment could have fit in there two times over. There was a large couch on his left with a lump of messy blankets on one end, but Miss Potts beckoned him over to the conference table on the right. There was a glass table opposite the door, with a chair and floor-to-ceiling glass windows behind it. The Manhattan skyline was there to be viewed in all its glory and it took Steve's breath away. No matter how many painful memories it held, this city would always be his home. Steve sat in the chair, spine straight, shifting so he could have a view of the door in his peripheral.
“If you heard my joints pop in the morning, you’d know I’m old enough to be a myth. I feel like Achilles if he had Tylenol.”
“I paid for our first date, I paid for our second date, and now he’s taken me out for karaoke. Maybe he’ll pay for popcorn.”
"In the three months you have been out of the military, you have not made any meaningful connections here in New York."
"Well, watch out," one of them warned. "This guy who's comin' has stolen plenty of ladies away from their dates."
"Bring you out of the 1940s is what I'm gonna do," one of the technicians replied. There was humor in his voice, so Steve relaxed a bit.
“This was meant to be a contractual obligation to keep Tony out of trouble. It didn’t matter if you were interested in him. In fact, it would be far easier on both of you if you weren’t. But I hoped you might be. You’re a legend in the military, and it takes someone with that sort of know-how to simultaneously let Tony be who he is while keeping him from wanting to do something stupid. He likes you a lot, Steve. If you like him, then maybe I was right that this will make him happy.”
Not even Jarvis's unfeeling voice could soften the blow. Tuesday morning meant all this had transpired since Tuesday afternoon. It didn't take Tony Stark's intellect to determine what brought this on. Steve asked,
complicated and messy. You said you didn't want to hide anymore, but that is exactly what you're doing. You're hiding yourself away from me, from your feelings toward me, and I am selfish enough to not want you to do that."
Steve rolled his eyes and Tony dragged himself back up onto the bed. He flipped over and smashed his face into his pillow. The evening had gone rather well ... How had it ended up like this?
"No, hey, man, no, it's really cool, though." This girl couldn't be any more than twenty and she stumbled all over her words. "I'm majoring in computational and applied math at NYU so Tony Stark is basically my hero."
something. Then with a million dollars I can get myself a decent apartment and a few more shirts then maybe fix up the venue where my VA group meets. One of my group members, Carol, her girlfriend wants to move up here to New York but can’t afford to right now. Perhaps this money can fix that problem. That's one of the things I like about you, Mr. Stark. I hear that you fix things."
“If you had given me a moment to process what you said, I would have told you the only thing scarier than the thought of losing you is the idea that you will go through this alone.”
The line went dead and Steve plugged the charger back into his phone. He was asleep the moment his head hit the pillow.
"It is impressive that you are able to hide so well, Steve. That will come in handy with the press. Eventually you will be asked to comment on your relationship and you'll be noncommittal."
“Good, then. I need to figure out where and when, but … I want to do it. It’s actually really nice to have someone supporting my choices for once. It’s new and I don’t know how to feel about it, so tell me what you were going to say.”
at them, was always a dark secret. When I wanted to know what something felt like, I sure as hell couldn’t ask anyone to touch me the way I wanted them to. Tony
"Only if you tell me about how the Howling Commandos managed to overtake a HYDRA tank with nothing but a grenade and a flashlight."
“Quite well, quite well,” she replied, voice hoarse from years of smoking. “People’ve been comin’ in here, talkin’ about you.”
"Why the hell would a man who looks like you, has a military pedigree, and what appears to be real red-blooded all-American baseball-loving apple pie-eating morals; why would you want to help someone like me?"
"I remember." Steve ran his thumb along the side of Tony's palm. "The short answer is that an op went very, very wrong."
was calling it. Steve’s whirlwind “romance” with a billionaire tech mogul. Monday was filled with Tony Stark. Tuesday had been all about Tony Stark and then Steve left. On Wednesday ... Well, Steve hadn't meant to type "tony stark" into Google, his fingers did it of their own volition. He stared at five different photos of his own face plastered on the phone screen beneath headlines like, "Tony Two-Dates" and "Another One Bites the Dust.” Steve rolled his eyes; it had been a dumbass move to walk out the front door. He barreled right through the photographers and hailed the first cab he saw.
“We have only been doing this for about a month, so there are a lot of things we have to learn about each other.” Steve revealed, “He’s got an ex-boyfriend no one talks about. They tell me to Google it, and that feels invasive. I should wait for Tony to tell me, right?”
The Contessa winked and replied, “Just an incurable gossip. Don’t mind me. Besides, I think your billionaire boy toy is about to show you just how terrible a singer he is.”
can send stocks plummeting, so they want him to prove he can give the company some stability. That begins in his personal life, because apparently the board believes they have authority over what Tony does in those matters. I need someone who can present a great public image while keeping him in check."
Neither Steve nor Tony knows what's fake and what's real between them. I got a lot of personal satisfaction from writing Steve tell a bunch of homophobes their existence is a waste of oxygen. Anywho, I am working on another Stony fic as well, so I am not certain when the next update will be published but I hope to have it up soon! Happiness yet to come.
Tony laughed and everything settled back into their easy camaraderie. Steve allowed himself to be led over to a group of men who oozed the sort of overblown cockiness he'd often seen in men with more power than they were worth. Parting the circle was like walking into a wall of cologne and Steve backed away to wipe his eyes.
“I’ll keep it with me.” Steve was walking away from the only solace he had since he left the army. He looked over his shoulder at his tiny apartment building and sighed. Moving on, step number one. That didn’t mean he was willing to let go of what little things he still had, even for a moment.
“Right, before you do, I made a decision.” Tony absentmindedly flipped through the pages. “I am going to give it a try. Removing the shrapnel, I mean.”
Steve blushed and before he knew it, Tony had pulled him down by the collar of his t-shirt into a lazy morning kiss. It was nice and slow, as if they had all the time in the world. Steve placed his hand on the nape of Tony’s neck, begging him to come closer.
Tony took Steve's left hand in his and slid a watch onto Steve's wrist. He folded the clasp shut then turned Steve's hand over so he could see the face. Steve glanced at it and all the breath left his body when he read "Rolex" at the top.
People were clapping. Steve blushed even harder and placed the microphone back on the stand. He went downstairs without much fuss and Tony met him halfway.
"It is my dream to work for him," she admitted, "but he might not even have a company by the time I graduate, if that
He was so lost in his memories he nearly jumped out of his chair when a woman slipped into the seat across from him.
“Here!” Tony grabbed one of the nearby papers with a bright post-it with FOR STEVE written on it. Tony handed it to Steve and said, “This is the revised contract with your stipulations and everything. I signed it, now we’re just waiting on you.”
Steve looked down at Tony to see actual hearts in his eyes. He smiled as the light changed and they made their way across the street.
After the cab reached the end of the block, Steve turned around to see Tony still standing there, hands stuffed in his pockets, watching Steve ride away. And even though Steve knew he shouldn’t, he Googled his own name. It was headline after punny headline, laughing at him choosing a cheesy karaoke song. There was a lot of information contained in some of the articles. Namely a quote that seemed to get brought up over and over again:
Steve glanced over at him, hair sticking up, hoodie discarded somewhere on Steve’s bedroom floor. The collar of his t-shirt was stretched out a bit from where he’d spent the day tugging on it. Steve turned off the shower and said,
"My goal for the week is to allow myself to consider what life can be like without the memory of Bucky clouding every moment."
“I notice. The first time you kissed me, you had a real smile. I’ve been working toward another one, but you’re very,” Tony knitted his eyebrows together and frowned. “
Steve answered, "Nobody. The army had lotsa different names for it, none of 'em nice." He took a deep, shaky breath before he continued. "My ma knew I was before I did. I mighta been thirteen when she asked if I looked at Bucky a little differently than I looked at other boys. Nobody said anything back then; it wasn't something people talked about, but I knew I wasn't gay. I told my ma that I looked at Buck the way I looked at girls and she said that was okay."
"That reminds me, Rogers, before this," he gestured to the space between them with his hand holding a second slice of pizza, "goes any further, we need to talk."
, then remove the shrapnel which has, apparently gotten closer to my heart instead of further away. Because nothing is ever that fucking easy. I don’t like the idea of someone messing around in my chest, Steve. It worked out the first time, I don’t think I’m lucky enough for it to work twice.”
Steve read over the documents and it seemed fairly simple. There was some tight legal language that insisted he keep Mr. Stark out of trouble and on the straight-and-narrow to the extent he could.
“He’s an archer.” Nat pulled out her phone and pulled up a picture. “Trick shots and impossible accuracy. Obviously a cover for something.”
"That is the real reason you're angry. You wanted a date free of cameras and people got pictures anyway."
“God, it’s so good to see you,” Steve said as he wrapped his arms around Sam’s shoulders. “So fucking good to see you.”
That made Steve pause for a moment. He pulled out his remaining earbud and turned to face the kid full-on.
Tony’s eyes went wide and he blinked. He blinked again. He opened his mouth to say something, but no words came out. Tony Stark, speechless? Steve hadn’t known him long enough to understand what that meant. It was either really good or very bad.
"You signed up because Tony Stark was interesting. You said so ten minutes ago, so maybe you wanted to help yourself, too. And that is fine, taking advantage of the opportunity presented to you, so consider that Stark may have been doing the same thing. Perhaps this was his way of opening up to you."
Steve backed up and pulled Tony with him, far enough to open the bathroom door and sidle them both out. Steve hoped he wasn’t blushing too hard, because it was very real to him, too. That line in the sand between “for the cameras” and “for us” kept getting thinner.
"We could skip the whole thing." Tony wrapped his free arm around Steve's waist and pulled himself closer. "Just you, me, and some Mario Kart."
Tony flipped up his welding helmet and walked over to the table when Steve was finished. He nudged Steve with his shoulder.
“Logistics. There was an entire ocean between our futures; she wanted something in England, I wanted something here in New York. When Bucky died, I had to cope with everything and she couldn’t help. I was dragging her down with me, so we ended it together. We went through all the possible scenarios and none of them made us happy. I lost Bucky and I lost Peggy, then lost a lot of myself in the aftermath.”
“I don’t really care where your life is heading, Steve, I care about what happens to Tony. When people leave, I am the one who has to pick up the pieces of him then figure out how they go together. He is my best friend and I have to look out for him. So …” Rhodey grimaced. “I know him well enough to see he will trip over himself and fall in love with you. It’s what he does, and you’re … You, Steve. You’re you. Whatever Pepper thinks she’s doing, there is a reason she didn’t tell me.”
Now, it is up to you to find a way to be happy. Perhaps you can make Tony Stark happy along the way.”
He peeled his clothes off and turned the shower to the hottest setting. The building was so old that the warm water took three minutes to make its way up to his apartment. Steve leaned against the doorframe and listened to the sound of water droplets hitting the shower floor. There were so many questions for Tony to answer. Steve supposed he could ask Miss Potts, but that wasn't his choice, was it? Tony was meant to be his boyfriend, so he would go to Tony with his questions.
"I knew your boss was Mr. Stark, but I didn’t realize …” Steve shook his head. “Please tell me what is going on."
“You know, I never thought about what it would be like to kiss Bucky. If I let myself think about it, I woulda done it. The first time I kissed Tony, it felt right.”
"I don't think you should lose that," Tony said, his voice jarringly soft. "When you haven't got anything else, hope is a nice thing to have."
Steve rarely slept in a shirt. What if, in the morning, he went out for a glass of orange juice and ran into Tony? What if there were cameras in the penthouse? Surely someone as tech-savvy as Tony Stark had cameras and Steve's abs would be in full view on film. The goal of this date was to prove he was not available for lecherous activity, so he reluctantly grabbed a grey t-shirt from the drawer. It would have to do.
of women leaving the tower in their taxis, visibly rumpled from the previous night's activities. Was that how Steve would end up? Nothing but a wrinkled t-shirt and yesterday's jeans as he made his way down to the subway?
“I had the same reaction when I saw Nat for the first time. She’s so beautiful it kind of punches you in the face. Then she
"Since I'm making you part of my life," Tony said, "I'd like to understand yours. If you're willing, there is nothing planned for me Tuesday night or Wednesday, and I'd like to see what your life is like."
She smiled that sad smile again and admitted, “When you’re with Tony as long as I was, you see how much he deserves in a partner. I still feel guilty that I couldn’t give it to him. I hope you can.”
"Anyway, I've only got ten minutes of lunch left and I expect nine of them to be you telling me how you ended up on a date with Tony fucking Stark."
"Of everything I can give you, of course you would be most impressed by the water pressure. Anyway, I was thinking that tomorrow—"
Then there were the bigger goals. Darcy Lewis was the only one of them who hadn't served. She was in a war zone working for a senator when the SUV in front of them hit an IED. This was the week she would finally get back on the subway after a year of walking eleven blocks to work. Major Danvers was finally going to ask her girlfriend to move to New York. She hoped Maria would move to the city with her daughter when the school year ended. Then it was Steve's turn ...
“Back in January, I got a call from a surgeon in California who is confident she can remove the shrapnel from my chest. It would eliminate the need for the arc reactor and it might prevent another heart attack.”
They ended things because it was the only way for them to be happy in the future. Not the present. Steve spent weeks afterward crying himself to sleep, and everyone in the barracks looked the other way. The once-great Captain America was nothing more than a shell of the man he once was. A shadow of the greatness everyone expected. Steve was tired of not living up to expectations, both others’ and his own.
"Man, haven't you been listening? It's lunchtime." Sam shot back in the half-chiding, half-fond way he did when Steve interrupted a story. "So the guy comes over and shows me a picture on his phone and I laugh, saying, 'Nah, man, I ain't got a picture of Tony Stark in my bunk.' Then he tells me, 'No, the other guy.' So I look a little closer at this photo of some blond guy with his arm around Tony Stark's shoulders, walking into that shitty diner you used to drag me to in Midtown."
A button-down or a t-shirt? Steve groaned as he scanned his options: white or grey or black button-down, army t-shirts, and a lilac cashmere sweater Peggy made him buy. A purchase that certainly paid dividends; every time he wore it, she ended up taking the sweater off. The cashmere sweater would certainly send the wrong signal, so Steve settled on the puke-green ARMY t-shirt and threw a black leather jacket on top.
Nat said, “Sam’s hitting on a man over there. You see him? Louis Vuitton briefcase, turtleneck under a blazer, and about five other red flags.”
Yet they walk out the front door of this building that I fucking built and tell the world I am a liability.”
“Hey,” he’d said, “I’m not asking shit and you’re not telling shit. All I’m gonna say is we know what we know, and there isn’t a single one of us who would say anything about it. You’re our leader. Barnes is our teammate. We want you both on this team and we want you to
Tony assured him, “He can’t hear you. He’s probably listening to someone analyze the latest episode of
“There is that, but it takes a couple minutes for the water to warm and it leaks out from the head.” Before Tony could make a joke, Steve held up a hand to stop him. “I was in the army; I heard every possible response to that.”
"I apologize, Mr. Rogers, I haven’t fully explained the job. You don’t need to babysit Tony; I want you to be his boyfriend."
"Technically I am not allowed to reveal information about Mr. Stark's personal life," Happy said. "However, I will say no, this is not generally my function. Would I say that makes you unique? Yes. Now, feel free to—"
“I had a ring for her, you know. As soon as we figured out where we were going to live and what our life would look like, I was going to ask her to marry me. That life, the one she’s living? I wanted that to be with me. Now she’s moved on, and I’m still
"Because he's trying to hide from the world, too. I did that for a whole decade, I don't want to watch somebody else go through it. Not when I could help him."
“Hmm.” Steve grimaced. “He’s certainly something. He’s actually coming over today, for the first time, and ...”
Tony flipped back around and sat cross-legged on the bed. He tugged at the blanket for a bit then folded it through his fingers as he answered.
Steve didn't feel the need to answer questions because Tony didn't. He flashed a dazzling smile and tucked himself into Steve's side. He flashed a peace sign, smiled up at Steve, and his hand moved down the curve of Steve's spine to rest right at the top of his ass. If Steve leaned into it a bit, neither of them mentioned it. They turned toward each other upon request, then moved into different positions while Steve stared into the wall of light in front of him. It felt like a half hour, but it was only two minutes before the faceless photographers had enough shots of him at every angle.
A reporter stepped forward to say, "We are documenting your evening for a feature in People magazine.
“Steve.” Tony leaned forward and placed one hand on Steve’s knee. “You don’t need to be afraid to tell me anything.”
Steve thought about it. Tony offered to tear up the contract and that surprised him more than anything else. He didn't like the idea of forcing Steve into this; the situation didn't sit well with either of them. But the way he listened when Steve spoke about losing Bucky, he said, "I know more about that than I'd care to." Then changed the subject when it became too personal, too dark.
“I really like him.” Steve spun the water glass between his fingers. “He drunk dialed me from Germany last week and said all sorts of nice things. He said I make him feel less alone. He does the same for me.”
Steve closed the distance between them and pressed a quick, chaste kiss against Tony’s lips. He pulled back just a bit and whispered,
Rhodes pointed at Steve and said, "This guy is a legend. He single-handedly saved forty soldiers from terrorists holding them hostage in Austria, of all places."
“Exceeding my wildest expectations, you are coming to my wedding with your hot boyfriend. Do you want to tell me about him?”
"They were expecting me to take to either subterfuge or abstinence, and never considered I might find a boyfriend. Now it is us against them, a war via the press. If we look like a real couple, breaking barriers, that sort of thing, we win."
“So you won’t see me for awhile, is what I’m saying. I leave tomorrow and get back the following … Whatever day is ten days after that.”
As Steve hoped he would, Tony hopped over the arm of the couch and toed off his shoes. He pulled his legs underneath him and offered his hand.
“You promised to be the best relationship I’ve ever had,” Tony cautioned, “so … Can you live up to the hype?”
Tony turned and tossed a beanbag at him. Steve caught it then tossed it into the hole at the top of the board. The corner of Tony’s mouth quirked up for just a moment before he said,
"I know that and you know that, but to most people there isn't a difference. For thirty-two years I've been Steve; I've been Captain Rogers for more than a decade. Part of me is terrified to put that aside to make 'Tony Stark's boyfriend' the headline of my obituary."
Tony huffed, pulled the beanie further down his forehead, and plopped onto the seat next to Steve. Happy closed the door and the car was rolling along ten seconds later. Tony nodded to the suitcase and asked,
Steve's instinct was to toss the card in the garbage. She knew too much about him and someone with the resources to know that much knew more than they let on. “I know everything I need to know.” Those sealed government files weren’t as secure as Steve would have hoped. The people with the resources to find that information wouldn’t give up easily. But … Steve didn't have anything else to do. He picked up the card and flipped it over to reveal a plain white background with, “Worth your time,” written in neat, thin penmanship on the back. Again, no more information than was absolutely necessary.
“Because I know you. You have a good heart, Steve. Stop isolating it. Tell him what you are afraid to tell him.”
He walked out of the room and toward the front door, asking Carol when she planned to speak to Maria. He gave her his cell phone number, since his life wasn't Fort Knox anymore, and asked her to text. He held the door open for Carol then stopped when he noticed his boyfriend standing at the foot of the stairs.
"Shit, I probably shouldn't have ... Right after your session ... You said it was hard and I just dropped that on you."
It took twenty-five minutes to get from Thor's office to Midtown. Steve checked his watch every two minutes, hoping to God that Tony wasn't busy. Once they arrived, he hopped out of the taxi and straight into the best burger place he knew within walking distance of Stark Tower.
It was almost comical, a dozen heads simultaneously swiveling around to look at him. Steve smiled and waved at Tony, who was frozen to his seat. He glared at Steve, who deserved it. For his part, Steve shrugged and nodded down at the boxes between his hands. After a few tense moments of eye contact, Tony shot out of his chair and opened the door with a smile that did not reach his eyes.
“I mean … Something normal?” Tony pulled off his helmet and wondered, “What do you like to get on your birthday?”
Steve sighed heavily and sank lower into the chair. He hated this, hated talking about any of this like it was normal. Liking men wasn’t normal for him. Or, well, it
"Dating a soldier is one thing, but a war hero is something else. Rhodey said you should’ve gotten the Medal of Honor. How did Pepper not know?"
"I get the feeling your background check on me was a bit more thorough than you’re letting on, Miss Potts."
“This trip was booked months ago, and generally I would have a few days on either end for …” Tony grimaced. “Well.”
“Of course I knew, but it’s like the first time you get shot at in a warzone. You know it’s gonna happen; doesn’t change your reaction when it does.”
He pressed the call button and it rang three times before it clicked. Steve’s heart nearly fell out his ass when he heard the sleepy voice on the other end.
"It wasn’t like everything shifted into place overnight. It wasn’t as if everyone woke up the next morning suddenly alright with things they hadn’t supported the day before.”
He kept his head down on the way back. Not that he wanted to be rude, but he was so invested in his routine that any interruption threw off the whole day. And he was not happy taking selfies while his hair was sweat-slick and stuck to his forehead. Steve wandered into a bookstore about a half mile from his apartment because he had questions that couldn't wait. He scanned the magazine racks until he spotted the issue of
Steve walked downstairs and out his front door. No sooner had the door closed than Tony nearly knocked him down, he hugged him so hard. He pulled Steve down into a teeth-clacking kiss and kept kissing him until they found a rhythm. Tony’s hands were everywhere; the hem of Steve’s sweater, his back pocket, his collar … Steve could hear people stopping, snapping pictures, but he didn’t care. Tony was finally there in his arms. He stepped back and placed his hands on Tony’s shoulders.
Steve wriggled free of his grasp and Tony sighed. He gestured toward their guests with a glass of what smelled like scotch.
“That would only make things less convenient. It’s not like the people in my building have easy lives. I don’t want to make it worse.”
Tony walked inside and began shuffling through everything. Steve winced when he landed on Bucky’s jacket at the back. Two separate parts of his life collided: the love he couldn’t have, and the potential for something just as good. Different, but good. Tony plopped onto Steve’s bed with no care for the quilt and spread himself out like a starfish, taking care to keep his shoes over the edge.
. The funniest thing is, I don’t like cats. I never wanted a cat. We never saw the same future, could barely figure out the present, and I don’t know why I loved him so much. Even if James walked through the front door right now and sat down at this table, I don’t think I would want us to pick up where we left off. I feel guilty about that, more than anything, and now …”
"Sometimes I don't think you know," Tony replied. "But you're hiding something from me. Pep won't tell me, so it has to be big."
“You do!” Steve pulled the pan out of the oven. “My ma taught me to cook when I was little. When you’re as tiny a kid as I was, you have to find innovative ways to impress girls. My first date, I was a senior in high school, and a girl agreed to go to the movies with me because I promised to bring cookies. I baked them from scratch and everyone sorta knew I had the best cookies for three blocks in any direction.”
Steve blushed. He’d heard that once or twice before, but it never ceased to amaze him that he actually ended up with Peggy. Let alone that anyone could ever think he was on her level.
Tony nodded and Steve put his hand on Tony's neck. It was different from how he touched Bucky; it was freer,
Steve spent the next hour being tossed from one technician to another. He chose a blueberry-colored suit from their selection and a bright blue pullover to go underneath. It seemed casual but was made of the nicest fabric Steve had ever touched. Everything fit perfectly, but those sorts of moments in Tony's world no longer surprised him. He shook that uncomfortable thought from his head and stepped into a pair of brown loafers. The stylist gave his hair more volume. No tie, but they did give him some nice cufflinks. Steve glimpsed himself in a mirror and thought he looked good. When he asked the makeup artist why she was packing up, she laughed.
“I can either risk one of the most invasive heart procedures anyone has ever performed, or I live my life in fear of having another heart attack.”
Steve rolled his eyes and stuffed his phone in his pocket. So that was what Tony’s world thought of them. He shouldn’t have been surprised; Pepper specifically chose him because Steve represented the straight and narrow lifestyle.
"Now you are here with your face on every media network you've ever heard of, holding hands with one of the most famous men in the world. No matter how good you were at hiding, there is no concealing this relationship. One that you knew would involve cameras."
"Yes," Tony untangled himself from Steve's pants, "I should." He turned away and opened the door to the conference room.
"These people are here to help you get ready for tonight's benefit. They always take hours on me." He paused to sip from his glass. "Don't think they have nearly as much to do for you."
Steve kissed him. No cameras, no people, no reason other than he wanted to. He could feel Tony smiling against his lips and pulled him closer. Tony broke away to say,
“I’m just happy you finally kissed me,” Steve teased. He took Tony’s hand and led him inside. “Suppose my address will be everywhere tomorrow.”
The elevator doors opened to reveal the familiar hustle and bustle of the Stark Tower lobby. Steve caught sight of Sam in his Air Force t-shirt and a thick jacket, conversing with one of the businessmen on the other side of the room. Halfway to him, Steve realized it wasn’t a conversation so much as it was a “
Friday morning, Steve walked into the living area around nine. Tony, who looked like he hadn’t slept since at least Tuesday, offered Steve a lazy smile.
“I like art, and I lost a lot of love for it after my ma died. Kids look at everything with fresh eyes and so much enthusiasm, like they can’t even believe all the colors that exist. I’d show them ten different types of yellow and it blew their minds. Or I would demonstrate what you can do with three pencils and the right kind of paper. It’s hard
Steve tossed the magazine in the recycling bin but thought about it all the way back to his apartment. He trudged up the stairs and somehow made it inside. There were pictures.
"I like Tony's better," Steve admitted. He needed to change the subject. Think, Rogers. Think! “How did you meet Tony?”
“No, Happy is not a fucking carpool, Steve! You can’t call him up when you feel like it and expect him to be there.”
because everyone knew what we’d tried to hide from. I’ve never touched a man the way I want to touch you, and I am afraid I might do it wrong.”
“I’ve just been thinking about getting back out there again when I’m home. If you meet any more billionaires, hook me up.”
"Alright, let's make a deal. No matter how sideways this goes, I won't lie to you and you won't lie to me."
. You see things for what they can be, and sometimes people need help to make sense out of chaos.” Steve paused before adding, “You’re good-looking, too. It helps.”
"You get that look on your face when you're thinking about something you are afraid to be happy about."
Tony pulled out his phone and a familiar English voice filled the room, giving Tony directions to a place three blocks over. Steve asked,
you, and afraid of what it would mean if I really let you into my life. You didn’t let me say any of that; you stole my lasagna and left.”
“I realized that Tony was trying to push me away, decided I wasn’t going to let him, and then I brought him a cheeseburger. Food really works with him. We went out for karaoke and that video made its way onto the internet. Everything fell into place afterward. Tony met me after my VA group then met me after therapy. He started showing me what life could be like with him.”
"Purple heart, wounded in action three times and you're a fucking moron who kept going back to the fight."
“I wanted to know his birthday, and he turns forty at the end of the month. What does he normally do?”
Bucky would say, "Hell no!" He had pulled Steve out of one too many risky adventures. Sam would say, "If you get free food out of it, what's the harm?" And Peggy would tell him to live his life to the fullest. Steve's ma always said he should do what he could to help people. Steve turned around to look at Tony Stark and saw a man who needed more help than he realized.
He looked so vulnerable. For all his billions, his skyscraper, and his infamy ... Tony Stark needed someone to detach him from all that.
"Never found the body." Steve scrunched up his nose and forced back tears that were reserved for the focus group and his therapist. "The army has him listed as MIA. I hate the hope that comes along with it."
Sam hummed, trying to keep himself from saying something he’d regret. He didn't say anything for several seconds so Steve listened to him breathe. He felt more at home on the phone with Sam than he did any other time in his apartment. Sam was his best friend, the one person in the world he trusted with conversations like this.
“If I go to the internet for information about Tony, doesn’t that put me on the same level as everyone else? What if what I find isn’t accurate and I go through the next weeks of our relationship with a false idea of Tony’s past? No, I won’t Google it. I want him to trust me enough to tell me.”
The room felt bigger than it was. A large, half-circle couch dominated the center of the room. Steve took note of a coffee table and a few scattered chairs, then the work desk shoved toward the right side of the room like an afterthought. A well-stocked bar ran along the back of the room, but it was the floor-to-ceiling windows that took Steve's breath away.
Steve looked at Tony and saw someone who had built a wall around his life and only allowed the world to peek at what he wanted them to see. Tony sighed and ran a hand across his face.
at Bucky. He hadn’t started to grow, yet, but Bucky was a bit older and it was little things at first. It was easier for him to pull bigger kids off’a Steve mid-fight. Then they turned fifteen, and when Bucky was kissing his girlfriend Steve wished he could trade places with either one of them. By the time Bucky died, Steve had already mapped out the taut lines of his shoulders and the curves of his lips. He could read the humor and pain in Bucky’s eyes and knew exactly how his hands would rest on Bucky’s waist. He’d thought about it a hundred times.
“My world is all about utilitarianism. If you can use someone, you’re nice to them. People say what they need to say to get something from you. True or not. Truth is malleable to people here. I have meeting after meeting every fucking day, and I spend half that time wondering how anyone ever buys the bullshit they try to sell me. While the Board of Directors had valid concerns about the alcohol, it never impacted my ability to perform.
He rifled through his dresser drawers. No to the button-downs. All his t-shirts looked the same. He needed a shirt that said, “I’m worth the wait.” He grabbed the cashmere sweater and pulled it over his head, careful not to mess up his hair. He sat at the kitchen table and pressed the video call button before he could think any longer.
magazine has these photographs of us in Tony’s penthouse and I feel uncomfortable that the world knows what it looks like.”
